<text>Alan Erwin Ball (born May 13, 1957) is an American writer and director for film and television. Ball is best known for writing the screenplay for the dramedy film &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He also created the HBO drama series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; (2001–2005) and &quot;True Blood&quot; (2008–2014), and served as an executive producer on the Cinemax action drama series &quot;Banshee&quot; (2013–2016). He wrote and directed the films &quot;Towelhead&quot; (2007) and &quot;Uncle Frank&quot; (2020).

==Early life==
Ball was born in Marietta, Georgia to Frank and Mary Ball, both of whom were aircraft inspectors. His older sister, Mary Ann, was killed in a car accident when Ball was 13; he was in the passenger seat at the time. He attended Marietta High School in Marietta, Georgia and went to college at the University of Georgia and Florida State University. Ball graduated from Florida State in 1980 with a degree in theater arts. 

After college, Ball began work as a playwright at the General Nonsense Theater Company in Sarasota, Florida.

==Career==
Ball broke into television as a writer and story editor on the sitcoms &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot; and &quot;Cybill&quot;.

Ball wrote two film scripts that ended up in development hell prior to &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999). He won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;American Beauty&quot;. He has written two further films: &quot;Towelhead&quot; (2007) and &quot;Uncle Frank&quot; (2020), the latter of which he also produced and directed. He is also the creator, writer and executive producer of the HBO drama series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;True Blood&quot;. Ball was the showrunner for &quot;True Blood&quot; for its first five seasons.

In 2010, Ball began work on a television adaptation of the crime noir novel &quot;The Mystic Arts of Erasing All Signs of Death&quot; by Charlie Huston, to be titled &quot;All Signs of Death&quot;. In December 2010, after several months of pre-production, HBO cancelled production.

Ball was one of the executive producers of the Cinemax series &quot;Banshee&quot;.

In July 2016, it was announced that Ball&#x27;s family drama &quot;Here and Now&quot; had been ordered to series by HBO. Starring Tim Robbins and Holly Hunter, the show was cancelled in April 2018 after one ten-episode season.

==Personal life==
Ball has discussed his Buddhist faith in numerous interviews, noting how it has influenced his filmmaking. In an interview with Amazon.com, Ball commented on the plastic bag scene in &quot;American Beauty&quot;, stating: &quot;I had an encounter with a plastic bag! And I didn&#x27;t have a video camera, like Ricky does... There&#x27;s a Buddhist notion of the miraculous within the mundane, and I think we certainly live in a culture that encourages us not to look for that.&quot; Ball also discussed how his Buddhism shaped themes in &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;True Blood&quot;.

Ball is gay and has been called &quot;a strong voice for [the] LGBT community&quot;. In 2008, he made &quot;Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual list of the 100 most impressive gay men and women.

==Accolades==

<doc id="899023" wikidata="Q2986784" url="?curid=899023" title="Commission on Presidential Debates">
<text>The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) is a nonprofit corporation established in 1987 under the joint sponsorship of the Democratic and Republican political parties in the United States. The CPD sponsors and produces debates for U.S. presidential and vice-presidential candidates and undertakes research and educational activities relating to the debates. Between 1988 and 2020, the CPD organized all general election presidential debates. 
In 2024, the campaigns of the major-party presumptive presidential candidates, Democratic incumbent Joe Biden and Republican former president Donald Trump, circumvented the CPD and committed to two debates outside the CPD&#x27;s purview. When Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee after the first debate, she and Trump maintained the commitment to the second debate outside the CPD&#x27;s purview.

== History ==
=== Debates before the CPD ===
The first televised presidential debates were held between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy during the 1960 campaign. No general election debates were held in 1964, and Nixon refused to participate in any debate in 1968 and 1972. Beginning with the 1976 election, the League of Women Voters sponsored the televised Gerald Ford–Jimmy Carter debates, followed by the John B. Anderson–Ronald Reagan and Carter–Reagan debates for the 1980 election, and the Reagan–Walter Mondale in 1984.

=== Formation ===
After studying the election process in 1985, the bipartisan National Commission on Elections recommended &quot;[t]urning over the sponsorship of presidential debates to the two major parties&quot;. The CPD was established in 1987 by the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican Parties to &quot;take control of the presidential debates&quot;. The commission was staffed by members from the two parties and chaired by the heads of the Democratic and Republican parties, Paul G. Kirk and Frank Fahrenkopf. At a 1987 press conference announcing the commission&#x27;s creation, Fahrenkopf said that the commission was not likely to include third-party candidates in debates, and Kirk said he personally believed they should be excluded from the debates.

In 1988, the League of Women Voters withdrew its sponsorship of the presidential debates after the George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis campaigns secretly agreed to a &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; that would decide which candidates could participate in the debates, which individuals would be panelists (and therefore able to ask questions), and the height of the lecterns. The league rejected the demands and released a statement saying that it was withdrawing support for the debates because &quot;the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter.&quot;

=== Debate format and venues ===
The CPD sponsored the debates in every presidential election from 1988 through 2020. Debates ran 90 minutes long, with no commercial interruptions.

Of the 33 debates conducted under its sponsorship, 30 were held on college or university campuses. Washington University in St. Louis hosted more presidential and vice-presidential debates than any other institution.

===2024 presidential election===
In January 2022, the Republican National Committee (RNC) warned the CPD that it planned to amend the Rules of the Republican Party to prohibit Republican presidential nominees from attending CPD-sponsored debates. The RNC unanimously passed the amendment to quit to CPD in April 2022.

In November 2023, the CPD announced its plans for debate dates and sites for the 2024 presidential election, with three presidential debates (to be held on September 16, October 1, and October 9) and one vice presidential debate (to be held September 25). However, the campaigns of both President Joe Biden and his challenger, former president Donald Trump, criticized the CPD&#x27;s plans, including over format and timing (&quot;i.e.&quot;, concerns that the debates would be held too late in the campaign season).

In May 2024, the Biden and Trump campaigns struck a deal to circumvent the CPD and participate in two debates (on CNN on June 27 and ABC on September 10), breaking a longstanding tradition of debates organized under the auspices of the CPD, throwing the future of the CPD into doubt. On June 24, 2024, the CPD announced that it was &quot;regrettably&quot; releasing the sites it had selected for its 2024 debates from their contracts, adding that &quot;CPD stands ready to sponsor 2024 debates should circumstances change.&quot;

== Leadership and funding==
The commission is a nonprofit organization, led by a bipartisan board of directors. It has 501(c)(3) status.

As of 2024, the co-chairs of the Commission were Frank Fahrenkopf (a former chairman of the Republican National Committee) and Antonia Hernández. Fahrenkopf has been co-chair since the CPD was established. The other co-chair was originally Paul G. Kirk, Jr., who served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Kirk stepped down from the CPD in 2009, and was replaced as co-chair by Michael D. McCurry. McCurry stepped down as co-chair in January 2017, and was replaced by Dorothy S. Ridings, a past executive of the Council on Foundations and League of Women Voters. Kirk and Ridings hold the title Co-Chair Emeriti. Kenneth Wollack, former president of the National Democratic Institute, was appointed as a third co-chair in 2019. Hernandez, formerly a CPD vice-chair, was selected as co-chair in 2022. 

As of 2024, the Commission&#x27;s board consists of eight members: Roy Blunt (former Republican senator from Missouri), Charles Gibson (a longtime television journalist, formerly of ABC News), John Griffen (managing director of Allen &amp; Co.); the Reverend John I. Jenkins (the president of the University of Notre Dame), Monica C. Lozano (the president and CEO of the College Futures Foundation), Richard D. Parsons (a cable executive), Rajiv J. Shah (the president of the Rockefeller Foundation and former administrator of USAID), and Olympia Snowe (former Republican senator from Maine). 

Past board members include John C. Danforth (former Republican senator from Missouri), Yvonne Hao (an investor and businesswoman), Jane Harman (a former Democratic congresswoman who later became director of the Woodrow Wilson Center) and Newton N. Minow (a former member of the Federal Communications Commission during the John F. Kennedy administration). Other past board members include Shirley M. Tilghman, Richard Moe, Kay Orr, Leon E. Panetta, Mitch Daniels, and  Caroline B. Kennedy.

Janet H. Brown has served as the CPD&#x27;s executive director since the commission was established in 1987.

The commission&#x27;s debates are sponsored by private contributions from foundations and corporations as well as fees from hosting institutions.

== Complaints from third parties ==

Third parties have often criticized exclusion of their candidates from debates, due to the CPD&#x27;s rule (established in 2000) that candidates must garner at least 15% support across five national polls to be invited to the national debates. The last candidate from outside the two major parties to participate in a CPD-sponsored debate was Ross Perot, who polled sufficiently high in his 1992 presidential campaign to debate George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton in all three debates; Perot&#x27;s running mate, James Stockdale, also participated in the vice presidential debate. When Perot ran again in 1996, the CPD declined to invite him to the debates, finding that the Reform Party candidate had no &quot;realistic chance to win&quot; the election.

Multiple lawsuits have been filed by third-party candidates challenging the CPD&#x27;s policy of requiring a candidate to have 15% support in national polls to be included in presidential debates; all have been rejected by the courts.

In October 2004, Libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik and Green Party candidate David Cobb were arrested while protesting against CPD for excluding third-party candidates from the nationally televised debates in St. Louis, Missouri. In October 2012, Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein and vice-presidential nominee Cheri Honkala were arrested for disorderly conduct while trying to take part in the second presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.

<doc id="899026" wikidata="Q2496566" url="?curid=899026" title="Function-level programming">
<text>In computer science, function-level programming refers to one of the two contrasting programming paradigms identified by John Backus in his work on programs as mathematical objects, the other being value-level programming.

In his 1977 Turing Award lecture, Backus set forth what he considered to be the need to switch to a different philosophy in programming language design:
Programming languages appear to be in trouble. Each successive language incorporates, with a little cleaning up, all the features of its predecessors plus a few more. [...] Each new language claims new and fashionable features... but the plain fact is that few languages make programming sufficiently cheaper or more reliable to justify the cost of producing and learning to use them.

He designed FP to be the first programming language to specifically support the function-level programming style.

A &quot;function-level&quot; program is variable-free (cf. &quot;point-free&quot; programming), since program variables, which are essential in value-level definitions, are not needed in function-level programs.

== Introduction ==
In the function-level style of programming, a program is built directly from programs that are given at the outset, by combining them with program-forming operations or functionals. Thus, in contrast with the value-level approach that applies the given programs to values to form a &quot;succession of values&quot; culminating in the desired result value, the function-level approach applies program-forming operations to the given programs to form a &quot;succession of programs&quot; culminating in the desired result program.

As a result, the function-level approach to programming invites study of the &quot;space of programs under program-forming operations&quot;, looking to derive useful algebraic properties of these program-forming operations. The function-level approach offers the possibility of making the set of programs a mathematical space by emphasizing the algebraic properties of the program-forming operations over the &quot;space of programs&quot;.

Another potential advantage of the function-level view is the ability to use only strict functions and thereby have bottom-up semantics, which are the simplest kind of all. Yet another is the existence of function-level definitions that are not the &quot;lifted&quot; (that is, &quot;lifted&quot; from a lower value-level to a higher function-level) image of any existing value-level one: these (often terse) function-level definitions represent a more powerful style of programming not available at the value-level.

==Contrast to functional programming==
When Backus studied and publicized his function-level style of programming, his message was mostly misunderstood as supporting the traditional functional programming style languages instead of his own FP and its successor FL.

Backus calls functional programming applicative programming; his function-level programming is a particular, constrained type.

A key distinction from functional languages is that Backus&#x27; language has the following hierarchy of types:
* atoms
* functions, which take atoms to atoms
* Higher-order functions (which he calls &quot;functional forms&quot;), which take one or two functions to functions
...and the only way to generate new functions is to use one of the functional forms, which are fixed: you cannot build your own functional form (at least not within FP; you can within FFP (Formal FP)).

This restriction means that functions in FP are a module (generated by the built-in functions) over the algebra of functional forms, and are thus algebraically tractable. For instance, the general question of equality of two functions is equivalent to the halting problem, and is undecidable, but equality of two functions in FP is just equality in the algebra, and thus (Backus imagines) easier.

Even today, many users of lambda style languages often misinterpret Backus&#x27; function-level approach as a restrictive variant of the lambda style, which is a &quot;de facto&quot; value-level style. In fact, Backus would not have disagreed with the &#x27;restrictive&#x27; accusation: he argued that it was &quot;precisely&quot; due to such restrictions that a well-formed mathematical space could arise, in a manner analogous to the way structured programming limits programming to a &quot;restricted&quot; version of all the control-flow possibilities available in plain, unrestricted unstructured programs.

The value-free style of FP is closely related to the equational logic of a cartesian-closed category.

==Example languages==

The canonical function-level programming language is FP. Others include FL, and J.

<text>Deshabandu Marvan Samson Atapattu (, , born 22 November 1970) is a Sri Lankan cricket coach, commentator and former cricketer who played for 17 years for Sri Lanka. Considered one of the most technically sound batsman in his era, Atapattu has scored six double centuries in Test cricket for Sri Lanka, irrespective of five ducks in his first six innings. Atapattu also captained the Sri Lankan team which won the 2004 Asia Cup. He was a part of the Sri Lankan squad which won the 1996 Cricket World Cup.

He has previously coached the Canada and Singapore national cricket teams. From April 2014 to September 2015, he was the head coach of Sri Lankan Cricket Team.

==Early life==
Marvan Atapattu started his cricket career as a teenager at Mahinda College, Galle, where Major G. W. S. de Silva was his first cricket coach. Then he moved to Ananda College, Colombo, where he was subsequently coached by P. W. Perera.

==International career==

Making his Test debut in November 1990 just after his 20th birthday, Atapattu&#x27;s first six innings yielded five ducks and a 1, and he was the first Sri Lankan batsman to be dismissed for a pair on debut. After this difficult start in his first three matches, he did not score above 29 in his next 11 innings, before hitting his first Test century in his 10th match, against India, seven years after his debut. He has 22 Test-match career ducks and four pairs (two ducks in a single Test), both records for a top-order batsman.

He made his One-Day International debut against India at Nagpur. He was appointed as captain of the one-day team in April 2003. He registered his highest Test score of 249 against Zimbabwe in 2004, sharing a 438-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara for the second wicket. Atapattu scored a century in the first innings of the Second Test during his team&#x27;s tour of Australia in 2004 in Cairns, Queensland. His third century in five innings, he made 133. A &quot;determin[ed]&quot; Atapattu, ESPNcricinfo wrote, &quot;pull[ed] authoritatively ... tuck[ed] in neatly behind the ball.&quot; He finished the two-match series scoring 156 runs at an average of 39.00 and was the top-scorer for his side.

Atapattu was a skilful fielder with an accurate throw. A report prepared by ESPNcricinfo in late 2005 showed that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the second highest number of run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the seventh-highest success rate. He was controversially left out of the squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, and as a result, asked for his removal from the list of Sri Lanka contracted players. Atapattu was to miss the 2007–08 tour of Australia, but was added to the squad after the intervention of Sri Lankan Sports Minister Gamini Lokuge. Atapattu played solidly in the First Test, but subsequently angrily labelled the selectors: &quot;A set of muppets, basically, headed by a joker,&quot; at a post-stumps press conference.

After Sri Lanka lost the series 2–0, Atapattu announced his international retirement after the second Test at Hobart. He finished with 5,502 Test runs at an average of 39.02 in 90 Tests with a One-day International average of 37.57 after hitting 8,529 runs in 268 matches. Atapattu scored six double centuries and sixteen centuries in his Test cricket career. He has scored centuries against all Test-playing nations.

===International centuries===

Atapattu scored his first test century in 1997, seven year after his debut, against India, and in that cricket match he made 108 runs as the match was played at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali.

His highest Test score of 249 came against Zimbabwe in 2004 at Bulawayo. His score of 127 in 2005 against New Zealand was his last Test century. As of August 2015, Atapattu is sixth in the list of most double hundreds scored in Test matches.

Atapattu scored his first ODI century in 1997 when he scored 118 in 2-run victory against India at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. At Lord&#x27;s in 1998, Atapattu scored 132 not out against England, his highest score in this format of the game. He also scored two centuries in the 2003 Cricket World Cup: against Zimbabwe he scored 103 not out and against South Africa, only the 19th tied ODI in cricket history, he made 124. He was selected as man of the match on both occasions. His innings of 111 against Pakistan in 2004 was his last ODI century.

== Coaching career ==
In 2009, Atapattu had a coaching stint with the Fingara Cricket Academy, a coaching facility in Sri Lanka. He had a short stint as Canada&#x27;s batting coach in early 2009, subsequently helping them qualify for the 2011 World Cup. In 2010, he was named as head coach of the Singaporean cricket team for a one-year period, which was his first full-time assignment of a coach of a national side. His first task was World Cricket League Division 5 in Nepal where the team finished third in the group stage and remained in division 5 for 2012 World League.

In April 2011, after the World Cup, Atapattu was named as the batting coach of Sri Lankan national team and joined interim coach Stuart Law, Champaka Ramanayake and Ruwan Kalpage for the tour of England. Meanwhile, he was considered for the head coach job of the team, which eventually went to Paul Farbrace, in 2013. Atapattu was promoted to the post of an assistant coach. Following Farbrace&#x27;s early unexpected exit in 2014, he was appointed as interim head coach of the team. During this period, Sri Lanka won its first Test series in England in 16 years, with a 1–0 win in its 2014 tour. He officially took over as head coach in September 2014, and was the team&#x27;s first local coach in 15 years. A 5–2 ODI series win during England&#x27;s 2014 tour of Sri Lanka was the only series win for Sri Lanka after he formally took over. After consecutive Test series defeats against India and Pakistan, he resigned in September 2015.

<doc id="899037" wikidata="Q7649445" url="?curid=899037" title="Sussex Golden Ginger Ale">
<text>Sussex Golden Ginger Ale is a &quot;golden&quot; ginger ale originally bottled in the town of Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada. It is produced by Canada Dry Motts, a subsidiary of Keurig Dr Pepper. The beverage is retailed in Canada&#x27;s Maritime Provinces and northern areas in the state of Maine.

Ginger ales generally come in two varieties: golden ginger ale, which is dark-coloured and more strongly flavoured; and dry ginger ale, which is more common today. Dry ginger ale was developed during Prohibition when ginger ale was used as a mixer for alcoholic beverages, which made the stronger flavour of the golden variety undesirable. Dry ginger ale quickly became more popular than golden, and today golden ginger ales like Sussex are an uncommon and usually regional drink.

== Variants ==
Other soft drinks with the Sussex name have been Sussex Pale Dry Ginger Ale, Sussex Red Oval Ginger Ale, Sussex Old English Ginger Beer and Sussex Cola.

== Brand ownership ==
The brand has had various owners, including Sussex Mineral Spring Co., Sussex Ginger Ale Ltd., Maritime Beverages Ltd., Great Pacific Industries Inc., Canadian 7up, and Crush Canada Inc. Sussex Golden Ginger Ale is now owned by Keurig Dr Pepper (formerly the Dr Pepper Snapple Group).

<doc id="899042" wikidata="Q4838481" url="?curid=899042" title="Babyland">
<text>Babyland was an American performance-based independent electronic junk punk band from Los Angeles, California, featuring Dan Gatto performing vocals and electronics and Michael Smith on percussion. The band released six studio albums before disbanding in 2009: &quot;You Suck Crap&quot; (1992), &quot;A Total Letdown&quot; (1994), &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now&quot; (1995), &quot;Outlive Your Enemies&quot; (1998), &quot;The Finger&quot; (2004), &quot;Cavecraft&quot; (2008).

==History==
Babyland was formed in 1989 by vocalist and programmer Dan Gatto and percussionist Michael Smith out of Los Angeles, California. They were advocates of the DIY punk ethic and part of the musical underground culture and well regarded in Industrial music, punk rock, indie rock and electronic music communities. Gatto and Smith met while in college, their first collaboration being a project for a musical culture class. The duo created an audio-visual work for the class which provided the seed for starting the band.

In 1991, the band released their debut EP &quot;1991&quot; and later that year the single &quot;Reality Under Smrow-Toh&quot; on the Los Angeles Punk rock label Flipside. In 1992 the song &quot;Mindfuck&quot; was provided to the If It Moves... compilation &quot;The Cyberflesh Conspiracy&quot; and the following year the band produced a cover of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Burning Up&quot; for the &quot;Shut Up Kitty: A Cyber-Based Covers Compilation&quot; by Re-Constriction Records.

Recordings prior to 1996 continued to be released by Flipside, including the band&#x27;s first three albums: &quot;You Suck Crap&quot; (1992), &quot;A Total Letdown&quot; (1994) and &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now&quot; (1995). These albums were positively received by critics, with &quot;Alternative Press&quot; crediting the band with embodying &quot;all the confusion, resentment, anger, and frustration felt by an entire generation.&quot; The band released their fourth studio album &quot;Outlive Your Enemies&quot; on Mattress Recordings in 1998. The band also participated in several of Flipside&#x27;s Mojave Desert events. Subsequent material has been released by the band&#x27;s own label, Mattress.

The fifth full-length &quot;The Finger&quot; and a compilation of earlier songs &quot;Decade One&quot; was released in Europe by dependent. Most recently, a deal with Metropolis Records has resulted in the wider commercial release of the sixth album &quot;Cavecraft&quot;. A post to the band&#x27;s Myspace site on October 9, 2009, confirmed the long-lived group&#x27;s breakup. In 2013 the live album &quot;LIVE EXECUTION&quot; was released and documented a live performance made on January 1, 2009, at The Smell in Los Angeles.

==Live performances==
Known for their live performances, Babyland shared the stage with bands such as The Offspring, Ethyl Meatplow, Grotus, Legendary Pink Dots, Dystopia, Foetus, Add N to (X), Nitzer Ebb, VNV Nation, and Psychic TV. Most of their live performances occurred in underground locations that have included places like LA&#x27;s Jabberjaw, Kontrol Faktory, The Smell, Long Beach&#x27;s Bogart&#x27;s and 924 Gilman in Berkeley. Many of their shows integrated a canonical industrial music ethic that involved building sets with items like scaffolding and functional televisions, which the band destroyed with hand and power tools over the course of the show.

==Other projects==
In between recording for Babyland, vocalist Dan Gatto formed Recliner with Vampire Rodents composer Daniel Vahnke and produced the song&#x27;s &quot;Trilobite&quot; and &quot;Nosedive&quot;, which appeared on the 1993 compilation &quot;Rivet Head Culture&quot;. Both compositions appeared on Vampire Rodents&#x27; third studio album &quot;Lullaby Land&quot; later that year. Another collaboration by Recliner was recorded and titled &quot;Zygote&quot;, released on the 1994 compilation &quot;Scavengers in the Matrix&quot; and later on Vampire Rodents&#x27; fourth album &quot;Clockseed&quot; in 1995. In 2012 vocalist Dan Gatto released a synthpop project called &quot;Continues&quot;.

<doc id="899044" wikidata="Q932728" url="?curid=899044" title="Peshmerga">
<text>The Peshmerga () are the internal security forces of Kurdistan Region. According to the Constitution of Iraq, regional governments are responsible for &quot;the establishment and organization of the internal security forces for the region such as police, security forces, and guards of the region&quot;. Other Kurdish security agencies include the Zêrevanî (gendarmerie), Asayish (security and counterterrorism service), and the &quot;Parastin û Zanyarî&quot; (intelligence agency). The Peshmerga&#x27;s history dates back to the 18th century, when they began as a tribal paramilitary border guard under the Ottoman Turks and the Safavid kurds. By the 19th century, they had evolved into a disciplined and well-trained guerrilla force.

Formally, the Peshmerga are under the command of the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs of the Kurdistan Regional Government. In practice, however, the Peshmerga&#x27;s structure is largely divided and controlled separately by the two Iraqi Kurdish political parties: the Democratic Party of Kurdistan and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Though unifying and integrating the Peshmerga has been on the Kurdistan Region&#x27;s public agenda since 1992, the individual forces remain divided due to factionalism, which has proved to be a major stumbling block.

Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Peshmerga played a key role in helping the United States on the mission to capture deposed Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. In 2004, they captured Saudi-born Pakistani terrorist Hassan Ghul, who was operating for al-Qaeda in Iraq. Ghul was turned over to American intelligence officers shortly afterwards, and revealed the identity of several key al-Qaeda figures during his interrogation, which eventually led to the killing of Osama bin Laden in a covert American military operation in Pakistan in 2011. One year later, in 2012, Ghul was assassinated by an American drone strike in northwestern Pakistan.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Peshmerga&quot; can be translated to &quot;to stand in front of death&quot;, and Valentine states it was first used by Qazi Muhammad in the short-lived Mahabad Republic (1946–47). The word is understandable to Persian speakers.

== History ==
The Kurdish warrior tradition of rebellion has existed for thousands of years along with aspirations for independence, and early Kurdish warriors fought against the various Persian empires, the Ottoman Empire and the British Empire.

Historically the Peshmerga existed only as guerrilla organizations, but under the self-declared Republic of Mahabad (1946–1947), the Peshmerga led by Mustafa Barzani became the official army of the republic. After the fall of the republic and the execution of head of state Qazi Muhammad, Peshmerga forces reemerged as guerrilla organizations that would go on to fight the Iranian and Iraqi governments for the remainder of the century.

In Iraq, most of these Peshmerga were led by Mustafa Barzani of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. In 1975 the Peshmerga were defeated in the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War. Jalal Talabani, a leading member of the KDP, left the same year to revitalize the resistance and founded the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. This event created the baseline for the political discontent between the KDP and PUK that divides Peshmerga forces and much of Kurdish society in Kurdistan.

After Mustafa Barzani&#x27;s death in 1979, his son Masoud Barzani took his position. As tension increased between KDP and PUK, most Peshmerga fought to keep a region under their own party&#x27;s control while also fighting off Iraqi Army incursions. Following the First Persian Gulf War, Iraqi Kurdistan saw the Kurdish Civil War between the two major parties, the KDP and the PUK, and Peshmerga forces were used to fight each other. The civil war officially ended in September 1998 when Barzani and Talabani signed the Washington Agreement establishing a formal peace treaty. In the agreement, the parties agreed to share revenue and power, deny the use of northern Iraq to the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK), and not allow Iraqi troops into the Kurdish regions. By then, around 5,000 had been killed on both sides, and many more had been evicted for being on the wrong side. In the years after, tension remained high, but both parties moved towards each other, and in 2003 they both took part in the overthrowing of the Baathist regime as part of the Iraq War. Unlike other militia forces, the Peshmerga were never prohibited by Iraqi law.
 In 2014, the Peshmerga withdrew from the Nineveh Plains which was said by the locals as being a contributing factor of the quick Islamic State victory in the invasion, and the widespread massacre of Yazidis, who were rendered defenseless.

==Structure and capabilities==

The Peshmerga are mostly divided among forces loyal to the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and those loyal to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), while other, minor Kurdish parties such as the Kurdistan Socialist Democratic Party also have their own small Peshmerga units. The KDP and PUK do not disclose information about the composition of their forces with government or media. Thus there is no reliable number of how many Peshmerga fighters exist. Media outlets have speculated that there are between 150,000 and 200,000 Peshmerga, but this number is highly disputed. Peshmerga have divided Kurdistan Region into a KDP-governed &quot;yellow&quot; zone covering Dohuk Governorate and Erbil Governorate and a PUK-governed &quot;green&quot; zone covering Sulaymaniyah Governorate and Halabja Governorate. Each zone has its own branch of Peshmerga with their own governing institutions that do not coordinate with the other branch.

As a result of the split nature of the Peshmerga forces, there is no central command center in charge of the entire force, and Peshmerga units instead follow separate military hierarchies depending on political allegiance. Multiple unification and depoliticizing efforts of the Peshmerga have been made since 1992. But so far all deadlines have been missed, reforms have been watered down, and most of the Peshmerga are still under the influence of the KDP and the PUK, who also maintain their separate Peshmerga forces. Following the events of the Iraqi Civil War in 2014, the United States and several Europe nations pressured the PUK and KDP to set up mixed brigades of Peshmerga as a condition for aid and funding. The PUK and KDP united 12 to 14 brigades under the Regional Guard Brigades, which were then placed under the command of the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs. However, officers continue to report to and take orders from their party leaders who also control the deployment of forces loyal to them and appoint front-line and sector commanders.

Both the KDP and the PUK rely heavily on irregulars in times of conflict to increase their ranks. However, both maintain several professional military brigades. The following units have been identified within the Peshmerga force:
Due to limited funding and the vast size of the Peshmerga forces, the KRG planned to downsize its forces from large numbers of low-quality forces to a smaller but much more effective and well-trained force. Consequently, in 2009, the KRG and Baghdad engaged in discussions about incorporating parts of the Peshmerga forces into the Iraqi Army in what would be the 15th and 16th Iraqi Army divisions. However, after increasing tension between Erbil and Baghdad regarding the disputed areas, the transfer was largely put on hold. Some Peshmerga were already transferred but reportedly deserted again, and there are allegations that former Peshmerga forces remained loyal to the KRG rather than their Iraqi chain of command; regardless, thousands of members of the 80 Unit of KDP and the 70 Unit of PUK are based in Baghdad, and they have good cooperation with other Iraqi forces in Baghdad.

The Peshmerga forces are secular with a Muslim majority and Assyrian and Yazidi units.

Peshmerga forces largely rely on old arms captured from battles. The Peshmerga captured stockpiles of weapons during the 1991 Iraqi uprisings. Several stockpiles of weapons were captured from the old Iraqi Army during the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, in which Peshmerga forces were active. Following the retreat of the new Iraqi Army during the June 2014 Islamic State offensive, Peshmerga forces reportedly again managed to get hold of weapons left behind by the Army. Since August 2014, Peshmerga forces have also captured weapons from the Islamic State. In 2015, for the first time, Peshmerga soldiers received urban warfare and military intelligence training from foreign trainers, the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve.

The Peshmerga arsenal is limited and confined by restrictions because the Kurdish Region has to purchase arms through the Iraqi government. Due to disputes between the KRG and the Iraqi government, arms flows from Baghdad to Kurdistan Region have been almost nonexistent, as Baghdad fears Kurdish aspirations for independence. After the Islamic State offensive of August 2014, multiple governments armed the Peshmerga with light arms, night goggles, and ammunition. However, Kurdish officials and Peshmerga stressed that they were not receiving enough and Baghdad was blocking arms from reaching the KRG, emphasizing the need for weapons to be sent directly and not through Baghdad. Despite this, the United States has maintained that the government of Iraq is responsible for the security of Iraqi Kurdistan and that Baghdad must approve all military aid.

The Peshmerga lack a proper medical corps and communication units. This became apparent during the Islamic State offensive in 2014 where the Peshmerga found itself lacking ambulances and frontline field hospitals, forcing wounded fighters to walk back to safety. There is also a lack of communication tools, as Peshmerga commanders are forced to use civilian cellphones to communicate with each other. Under the guidance of the US-led coalition the Peshmerga started to standardize its weapons systems, replacing Soviet-era weapons with NATO firearms.

==Issues==
Peshmerga has been accused of corruption, partisanship, nepotism and fraud. Peshmerga is accused of listing
&quot;ghost employees&quot; who do not exist or do not show up for work but receive a salary. Those setting up such a scam split the salary of these employees.

In addition the KDP and PUK have used the Peshmerga to exert a monopoly on the use of force within their zones. In 2011 KDP Peshmerga fired on anti-government protesters in Sulaymaniyah, and the PUK later used its own security forces to break up these protests, leading to criticism from all of the opposition parties in the parliament. In 2014 the KDP used its Peshmerga to stop ministers from the Gorran Movement to enter Erbil and attend parliament.

Outside of Kurdistan Region the Peshmerga has been criticized for using force to exert control of local Arab, Yazidi and Assyrian communities, particularly after taking control of areas officially outside of Kurdistan Region during the Iraqi Civil War.

==Role of women==

Women have played a significant role in the Peshmerga since its foundation. The Kurdish Zand tribe was known for allowing women in military roles. During the Iraqi–Kurdish conflict the majority of women served within the Peshmerga in supporting roles such as building camps, taking care of the wounded, and carrying munitions and messages. Several women brigades served on the front lines. Margaret George Malik was an iconic Assyrian guerilla fighter who was given a leading position in important battles such as the battle of Zawita Valley. The PUK started recruiting women during the Kurdish Civil War. Women were given a 45-day basic training that included parade drills and basic marksmanship with various rifles, mortars, and RPGs.

In the months leading up to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, the United States launched Operation Viking Hammer which dealt a huge blow to Islamic terrorist groups in Iraqi Kurdistan and uncovered a chemical weapons facility. The PUK later confirmed that female Kurdish fighters had participated in the operation.

The modern Peshmerga is almost entirely made up of men, while having at least 600 women in their ranks. In the KDP, these Peshmerga women have been refused access to the frontline and are mostly used in logistics and management positions, but PUK Peshmerga women are deployed in the front lines and are actively engaged in combat.

<text>Dan Gatto (born Dan Merrick Gatto; September 21, 1970) is an American musician best recognized as the vocalist for synth punk band Babyland. He also collaborated with Vampire Rodents composer Daniel Vahnke on a project called Recliner. After Babyland dissolved in 2009, Gatto founded Continues as an outlet for his solo work.

==Biography==
Gatto was born on September 21, 1970, and raised in the San Francisco Bay area. He became passionate about music at the age of twelve when he discovered The Human League&#x27;s &quot;Dare&quot; album. By fifteen he had begun to compose electronic music and in 1989 formed the synth punk group Babyland with percussionist Michael Smith. They released six full-length albums between 1992 and 2008: &quot;You Suck Crap&quot;, &quot;A Total Letdown&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now&quot;, &quot;Outlive Your Enemies&quot;, &quot;The Finger&quot; and &quot;Cavecraft&quot;.
 In 1992, Gatto met Daniel Vahnke, vocalist and composer for Vampire Rodents, and together they started the project Recliner. They collaborated on three songs together, &quot;Trilobite&quot;, &quot;Noise Dive&quot; and Zygote, all of which appear on Vampire Rodents&#x27; &quot;Lullaby Land&quot; and &quot;Clockseed&quot; albums. In 2009, Michael Smith announced that he had become dissatisfied with the direction Babyland had headed and the duo parted ways in October of that year. Still eager to pursue music, Gatto began composing under the moniker Continues and released a self-titled solo album under the name in 2012.

<text>In computing, Fudgets is a graphical user interface toolkit for the functional programming language Haskell and the X Window System. Fudgets makes it easy to create client–server model applications that communicate via the Internet.

Most of the work on Fudgets was done in 1991-1996 by Thomas Hallgren and Magnus Carlsson.

The authors claim that many of the advantages of Fudgets come from it being programmed in a lazy functional programming language.

The main entity of toolkit is fudget (implemented on low level through stream processors) which has its own input and output. Fudgets can be composed in parallel or sequence, yielding new fudget which can be used in code as any other fudget.

== Example ==

factorialF = stdoutF &gt;==&lt; mapF (show . factorial . read) &gt;==&lt; stdinF
factorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer
factorial n = product [1..n]
The code is self-describing considering that codice_1 is sequential fudget plumbing and codice_2 is fudget that takes a function of one argument and makes a fudget which output is input applied to that function. Fudget composition must be read from right to left, as a simple function composition. Now you can simply write:

main = fudlogue factorialF
compile and run. For every given integer value it will print its factorial.

<doc id="899058" wikidata="Q831940" url="?curid=899058" title="Operating expense">
<text>An operating expense (opex) is an ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system. Its counterpart, a &quot;capital expenditure&quot; (capex), is the cost of developing or providing non-consumable parts for the product or system. For example, the purchase of a photocopier involves capex, and the annual paper, toner, power and maintenance costs represents opex. For larger systems like businesses, opex may also include the cost of workers and facility expenses such as rent and utilities.

==Overview==
In business, an operating expense is a day-to-day expense such as sales and administration, or research &amp; development, as opposed to production. In short, this is the money the business spends in order to turn inventory into throughput.

On an income statement, &quot;operating expenses&quot; is the sum of a business&#x27;s operating expenses for a period of time, such as a month or year.

In throughput accounting, the cost accounting aspect of the theory of constraints (TOC), operating expense is the money spent turning inventory into throughput. In TOC, operating expense is limited to costs that vary strictly with the quantity produced, like raw materials and purchased components. Everything else is a fixed cost, including labour (unless there is a regular and significant chance that workers will not work a full-time week when they report on their first day).

In a real estate context, operating expenses include costs associated with the operation and maintenance of an income-producing property.

Operating expenses include:
* salary and wages
* accounting expenses
* license fees
* maintenance and repairs, such as snow removal, trash removal, janitorial service, pest control, and lawn care
* advertising
* office expenses
* supplies
* attorney fees and legal fees
* utilities, such as telephone
* insurance
* property management, including a resident manager
* property taxes
* travel and vehicle expenses
:Travel expenses are defined as those incurred in the event of travel required for professional purposes.
::For this purpose, “travel” is defined as the simultaneous absence from the residence and from the regular place of employment. It is prompted by professional or company purposes and likely does not concern the traveler’s private life, or concerns it only to a small degree. Travel expenses include travel costs and fares, accommodation expenses, and so-called additional expenses for meals.

<text>Harbance Singh (Herb)Dhaliwal, PC (born 12 December 1952) is a Canadian politician and businessman.

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1993 election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Vancouver South.

Prime Minister Jean Chrétien recommended Dhaliwal&#x27;s appointment to Cabinet (the first Indian-Canadian to become a federal cabinet minister) in 1997 as Minister of Revenue. In 1999, he became Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, and in 2002 he was appointed Minister of Natural Resources and Minister with political responsibility for British Columbia.

Dhaliwal was a firm supporter of Chrétien against Paul Martin&#x27;s attempt to force the Liberal leader to retire. As a result, Martin&#x27;s campaign team targeted Dhaliwal and successfully took over his riding association. Dhaliwal publicly denounced Martin&#x27;s campaign team for this and criticized them for restricting access to Liberal Party membership forms. 
When Chrétien announced his resignation, Dhaliwal briefly considered running in the 2003 Liberal leadership campaign, but decided against it. Several months later, he endorsed Martin for leader and said he would be willing to serve in a Martin cabinet. However, on 3 December 2003, he announced that he would not be running for re-election.

== Business ==
After graduating from the University of British Columbia with a Bachelor of Commerce degree, he started a maintenance company out of his basement. He is a top level executive of Dynamic Facility Services Ltd. He became a self-made millionaire with diversified business interests including transportation, maintenance and real estate development.

Dhaliwal is chairman of National Green Biomed Ltd., a medical marijuana producer that donated $1 million in 2015 for health research into medical cannabis at the University of British Columbia. He spoke about decriminalization of cannabis by the Justin Trudeau federal government.

== Return to politics ==
In September 2024, Dhaliwal attempted to register a new provincial political party named the &quot;New Liberal Party of BC&quot;, in order to replace BC United, which suspended its campaign in the month prior, as a centrist option for voters, according to himself. Yet, Elections BC refused the name of the new political party, citing confusion as a reason.
== Personal life ==
Born in India at Chaheru, Distt. Kapurthala Punjab in 1952, Dhaliwal&#x27;s family emigrated to Vancouver when he was six. He attended John Oliver Secondary School, graduating in 1972.

Dhaliwal is married to Amrit Kaur. He has two daughters and a son.

<text>Hardy Cross (1885–1959) was an American structural engineer and the developer of the moment distribution method for structural analysis of statically indeterminate structures. The method was in general use from c. 1935 until c. 1960 when it was gradually superseded by other methods.

==Early life==
Cross was born in Nansemond County, Virginia, to Virginia planter Thomas Hardy Cross and his wife Eleanor Elizabeth Wright. He had an elder brother, Tom Peete Cross, who would later become a Celtic studies scholar. Both studied at Norfolk Academy. Then he attended Hampden-Sydney College where he earned both B.A. and B.S. degrees. He obtained a BS in civil engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1908, and then joined the bridge department of the Missouri Pacific Railroad in St. Louis, where he remained for a year, after which he returned to Norfolk Academy in 1909. After a year of graduate study at Harvard he was awarded the MCE degree in 1911. Hardy Cross developed the moment distribution method while working at University of Illinois.

==Career==
Cross next became an assistant professor of civil engineering at Brown University, where he taught for seven years. After a brief return to general engineering practice, he accepted a position as professor of structural engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in 1921. At the University of Illinois Hardy Cross developed his moment distribution method. He left Illinois in 1937 to become the chair of the civil engineering department at Yale University, a position from which he retired in 1953.

Accurate structural analysis of statically indeterminate beams and frames could be performed by hand using the moment distribution method. In this method, the fixed-end moments in the framing members are gradually distributed to adjacent members in a number of steps such that the system eventually reaches its natural equilibrium configuration. However the method was still an approximation but it could be solved to be very close to the actual solution.

The Hardy Cross method is essentially the Jacobi iterative scheme applied to the displacement formulation of structural analysis.

Today the &quot;moment distribution&quot; method is no longer commonly used because computers have changed the way engineers evaluate structures, and moment distribution programs are seldom created nowadays. Today&#x27;s structural analysis software is based on the flexibility method, direct stiffness method or finite element methods (FEM).

Another Hardy Cross method is also famous for modeling flows in complex water supply networks. Until recent decades, it was the most common method for solving such problems.

He received numerous honors. Among these were an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University, the Lamme Medal of the American Society for Engineering Education (1944), the Wason Medal for Most Meritorious Paper of the American Concrete Institute (1935), and the Gold Medal of the Institution of Structural Engineers of Great Britain (1959).

== Hardy Cross Method ==

Hardy Cross&#x27;s description of his method follows: &quot;Moment Distribution. The method of moment distribution is this: 
# Imagine all joints in the structure held so that they cannot rotate and compute the moments at the ends of the members for this condition;
# at each joint distribute the unbalanced fixed-end moment among the connecting members in proportion to the constant for each member defined as &quot;stiffness&quot;;
# multiply the moment distributed to each member at a joint by the carry-over factor at the end of the member and set this product at the other end of the member;
# distribute these moments just &quot;carried over&quot;;
# repeat the process until the moments to be carried over are small enough to be neglected; and
# add all moments – fixed-end moments, distributed moments, moments carried over – at each end of each member to obtain the true moment at the end.&quot;
[Cross 1949:2]

<doc id="899064" wikidata="Q2233484" url="?curid=899064" title="Culture of Cambodia">
<text>Throughout Cambodia&#x27;s long history, religion has been a major source of cultural inspiration. Over nearly two millennia, Cambodians have developed a unique Cambodian culture and belief system from the syncreticism of indigenous animistic beliefs and the Indian religions of Buddhism and Hinduism. Cambodia&#x27;s achievements in art, architectures, music, and dance from the 9th and 14th century have had a great influence on many neighboring kingdoms, namely Thailand and Laos. The effect of Khmer culture can still be seen today in those countries, as they share many close characteristics with current-day Cambodia. The Tai borrowed from the Khmer many elements of Indianized Khmer culture, including royal ceremonies, customs followed at the court, and especially the Indian epic Ramayana, which influenced not only literature but also classical dance. Even in modern Thai culture the legacy of ancient Khmer culture is still evident.

==History==
The Golden Age of Cambodia was between the 9th and 14th centuries, during the Angkor period, during which it was a powerful and prosperous empire that flourished and dominated almost all of inland Southeast Asia. Angkor eventually collapsed after much intensive in-fighting between royalty and constant warring with its increasingly powerful neighbors, notably Siam and Dai Viet. Many temples from this period like Bayon and Angkor Wat remain today, scattered throughout Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam as a reminder of the grandeur of Khmer arts and culture.

==Architecture and housing==

The Angkorian architects and sculptors created temples that mapped the cosmic world in stone. Khmer decorations drew inspiration from religion, and mythical creatures from Hinduism and Buddhism were carved on walls. Temples were built in accordance to the rule of ancient Khmer architecture that dictated that a basic temple layout include a central shrine, a courtyard, an enclosing wall, and a moat. Khmer motifs use many creatures from Buddhist and Hindu mythology, like the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh, use motifs such as the garuda, a mythical bird in Hinduism. 

The architecture of Cambodia developed in stages under the Khmer Empire from the 9th to the 15th century, preserved in many buildings of the Angkor temple. The remains of secular architecture from this time are rare, as only religious buildings were made of stone. The architecture of the Angkor period used specific structural features and styles, which are one of the main methods used to date the temples, along with inscriptions.

In modern rural Cambodia, the nuclear family typically lives in a rectangular house that may vary in size from four by six meters to six by ten meters. It is constructed of a wooden frame with gabled thatch roof and walls of woven bamboo. Khmer houses are typically raised as much as three meters on stilts for protection from annual floods. Two ladders or wooden staircases provide access to the house.

A steep thatch roof overhanging the house walls protects the interior from rain. Typically a house contains three rooms separated by partitions of woven bamboo. The front room serves as a living room used to receive visitors, the next room is the parents&#x27; bedroom, and the third is for unmarried daughters. Sons sleep anywhere they can find space. Family members and neighbors work together to build the house, and a house-raising ceremony is held upon its completion.

The houses of poorer persons may contain only a single large room. Food is prepared in a separate kitchen located near the house but usually behind it. Toilet facilities consist of simple pits in the ground, located away from the house, that are covered up when filled. Any livestock is kept below the house. Chinese and Vietnamese houses in Cambodian towns and villages are typically built directly on the ground and have earthen, cement, or tile floors, depending upon the economic status of the owner. Urban housing and commercial buildings may be of brick, masonry, or wood.
&lt;br&gt;
==Religion==
Cambodia is predominantly Buddhist with 80% of the population being Theravada Buddhist, 1% Christian and the majority of the remaining population follow Islam, atheism, or animism.

Buddhism has existed in Cambodia since at least the 5th century CE. Theravada Buddhism has been the Cambodian state religion since the 13th century CE (excepting the Khmer Rouge period), and is currently estimated to be the faith of 90% of the population. A smaller number of Cambodians, mostly of Vietnamese and Chinese descent, practice Mahayana Buddhism. The main orders of Buddhism practiced in Cambodia are Dhammayuttika Nikaya and Maha Nikaya.
Islam is the religion of a majority of the Cham and Malay ethnic minorities (both also known under the umbrella term &quot;Khmer Islam&quot;) in Cambodia. According to Po Dharma, there were 150,000 to 200,000 Muslims in Cambodia as late as 1975. Persecution under the Khmer Rouge eroded their numbers, however, and by the late 1980s they probably had not regained their former strength. All of the Cham Muslims are Sunnis of the Shafi&#x27;i school. Po Dharma divides the Muslim Cham in Cambodia into a traditionalist branch and an orthodox branch.

Christianity was introduced into Cambodia by Roman Catholic missionaries in 1660. It made little headway at first, particularly among Khmer Buddhists. In 1972 there were probably about 20,000 Christians in Cambodia, most of whom were Roman Catholics. According to Vatican statistics, in 1953, members of the Roman Catholic Church in Cambodia numbered 120,000, making it at that time the second largest religion in the country.

In April 1970, just before repatriation, estimates indicate that about 50,000 Catholics were Vietnamese. Many of the Catholics remaining in Cambodia in 1972 were Europeans—chiefly French. American Protestant missionary activity increased in Cambodia, especially among some of the hill tribes and among the Cham, after the establishment of the Khmer Republic. The 1962 census, which reported 2,000 Protestants in Cambodia, remains the most recent statistic for the group.

Observers reported that in 1980 there were more registered Khmer Christians among the refugees in camps in Thailand than in all of Cambodia before 1970. Kiernan notes that, until June 1980, five weekly Protestant services were held in Phnom Penh by a Khmer pastor, but that they had been reduced to a single weekly service after police harassment. There are around 21,300 Catholics in Cambodia which represents only 0.15% of the total population. There are no dioceses, but there are three territorial jurisdictions - one Apostolic Vicariate and two Apostolic Prefectures.
Highland tribal groups, most with their own local religious systems, probably number fewer than 100,000 persons. The Khmer Loeu have been loosely described as animists, but most tribal groups have their own pantheon of local spirits. In general they see their world filled with various invisible spirits (often called yang), some benevolent, others malevolent. They associate spirits with rice, soil, water, fire, stones, paths, and so forth. Sorcerers or specialists in each village contact these spirits and prescribe ways to appease them.

In times of crisis or change, animal sacrifices may be made to placate the anger of the spirits. Illness is often believed to be caused by evil spirits or sorcerers. Some tribes have special medicine men or shamans who treat the sick. In addition to belief in spirits, villagers believe in taboos on many objects or practices. Among the Khmer Loeu, the Rhade and Jarai groups have a well-developed hierarchy of spirits with a supreme ruler at its head.

==Ways of life==
===Birth and death rituals===
The birth of a child is a happy event for the family. According to traditional beliefs, however, confinement and childbirth expose the family, and especially the mother and the child to harm from the spirit world. A woman who dies in childbirth—crosses the river (&quot;chhlâng tónlé&quot;) in Khmer is believed to become an evil spirit. In traditional Khmer society, a pregnant woman respects a number of food taboos and avoids certain situations. These traditions remain in practice in rural Cambodia, but they have become weakened in urban areas.

Death is not viewed with the great outpouring of grief common to Western society; it is viewed as the end of one life and as the beginning of another life that one hopes will be better. Buddhist Khmer usually are cremated, and their ashes are deposited in a stupa in the temple compound. A corpse is washed, dressed, and placed in a coffin, which may be decorated with flowers and with a photograph of the deceased. White pennant-shaped flags, called &quot;white crocodile flags,&quot; outside a house indicate that someone in that household has died.

A funeral procession consisting of an achar, Buddhist monks, members of the family, and other mourners accompanies the coffin to the crematorium. The spouse and the children show mourning by shaving their heads and by wearing white clothing. Relics such as teeth or pieces of bone are prized by the survivors, and they are often worn on gold chains as amulets.

===Childhood and adolescence===

A Cambodian child may be nursed until two to four years of age. Up to the age of three or four, the child is given considerable physical affection and freedom. Children around five years of age also may be expected to help look after younger siblings. Children&#x27;s games emphasize socialization or skill rather than winning and losing.

Normally, children start school when they reach the age of 6 years old. By the time they reach this age, they are familiar with the society&#x27;s norms of politeness, obedience, and respect toward their elders and toward Buddhist monks. The father at this time begins his permanent retreat into a relatively remote, authoritarian role. By age ten, a girl is expected to help her mother in basic household tasks; a boy knows how to care for the family&#x27;s livestock and can do farm work under the supervision of older males. Adolescent children usually play with members of the same sex. During his teens, a boy may become a temple servant and go on to serve a time as a novice monk, which is a great honor for the parents.

In pre-communist days, parents exerted complete authority over their children until the children were married, and the parents continued to maintain some control well into the marriage. Age difference is strictly recognized with polite vocabulary and special generational terms for &quot;you&quot;.

===Courtship, marriage, and divorce===

In Cambodia, premarital sex is deplored. The choice of a spouse is a complex one for the young male, and it may involve not only his parents and his friends, as well as those of the young woman, but also a matchmaker and a &quot;haora&quot; (a Khmer &quot;fortuneteller&quot; versed in Indian astrology). In theory, a girl may veto the spouse her parents have chosen for her. Courtship patterns differ between rural and urban Khmer; marriage as a culmination of romantic love is a notion that exists to a much greater extent in larger cities.

A man usually marries between the ages of nineteen and twenty-five, a girl between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two. After a spouse has been selected, each family investigates the other to make sure its child is marrying into a good family. In rural areas, there is a form of bride-service; that is, the young man may take a vow to serve his prospective father-in-law for a period of time. By tradition, the youngest daughter and her spouse are expected to live with and care for her ageing parents and their land.

The traditional wedding is a long and colorful affair. Formerly it lasted three days, but in the 1980s it more commonly lasted a day and a half. Buddhist priests offer a short sermon and recite prayers of blessing. Parts of the ceremony involve ritual hair cutting, tying cotton threads soaked in holy water around the bride&#x27;s and groom&#x27;s wrists, and passing a candle around a circle of happily married and respected couples to bless the union. After the wedding, a banquet is held. Newlyweds traditionally move in with the wife&#x27;s parents and may live with them up to a year, until they can build a new house nearby.

The majority of married Cambodian couples do not obtain legal marriage documents. Marriage is seen more as a social institution, regulated by societal pressures, expectations and norms, than a legal matter. This practice continues today. All that is necessary for a couple to be considered married by the community is to have a ceremony, after which a party is often held for family, friends and well-wishers to celebrate. This is how the overwhelming majority of Cambodian couples marry. Whether these traditional marriages are considered legal contracts by the government and courts is unclear. Therefore, when a couple separate, they likewise need not obtain divorce documents.

Divorce is legal and relatively easy to obtain, but not common. Divorced persons are viewed with some disapproval. Each spouse retains whatever property he or she brought into the marriage, and jointly-acquired property is divided equally. Divorced persons may remarry, but the woman must wait 300 days according to article 9 of Marriage and Family Law. Custody of minor children is usually given to the mother, and both parents continue to have an obligation to contribute financially toward the rearing and education of the child.
The divorced male doesn&#x27;t have a waiting period before he can remarry.

The consequences of the social upheaval caused by the Cambodian Civil War is still being felt. At present there is variation in tradition from province to province. In Siem Reap, it is widely understood, for example, that the man takes the first-born child upon separation. Men who leave their families typically do not support their other children, especially when they leave one woman for another woman. The new woman and her family will not accept children from a previous relationship. This is also an important source of the 70% or so of non orphans living in fake orphanages around cities in Cambodia which are tourist focal points.

===Social organization===

Khmer culture is very hierarchical. The greater a person&#x27;s age, the greater the level of respect that must be granted to them. Cambodians are addressed with a hierarchical title corresponding to their seniority before the name. When a married couple becomes too old to support themselves, they may invite the youngest child&#x27;s family to move in and to take over running the household. At this stage in their lives, they enjoy a position of high status.

The individual Khmer is surrounded by a small inner circle of family and friends who constitute his or her closest associates, those he would approach first for help. The nuclear family, consisting of a husband and a wife and their unmarried children, is the most important kin group. Within this unit are the strongest emotional ties, the assurance of aid in the event of trouble, economic cooperation in labor, sharing of produce and income, and contribution as a unit to ceremonial obligations. In rural communities, neighbors—who are often also kin—may be important, too.

Fictive child-parent, sibling, and close friend relationships Cambodia transcend kinship boundaries and serve to strengthen interpersonal and interfamily ties. Beyond this close circle are more distant relatives and casual friends. In rural Cambodia, the strongest ties a Khmer may develop—besides those to the nuclear family and to close friends—are those to other members of the local community. A strong feeling of pride—for the village, for the district, and province—usually characterizes Cambodian community life.

Legally, the husband is the head of the Khmer family, but the wife has considerable authority, especially in family economics. The husband is responsible for providing shelter and food for his family; the wife is generally in charge of the family budget, and she serves as the major ethical and religious model for the children, especially the daughters. Both husbands and wives are responsible for domestic economic tasks.

===Customs===
In Khmer culture a person&#x27;s head is believed to contain the person&#x27;s soul—therefore making it taboo to touch or point one&#x27;s feet at it. It is also considered to be extremely disrespectful to use the feet to point out a person, or to sit or sleep with the soles of the feet pointing at a person, as the feet are the lowest part of the body and are considered to be impure.

When greeting people or to show respect in Cambodia people do the &quot;sampeah&quot; gesture, identical to the Indian namaste and Thai wai.

Customary Cambodian teachings are laid out in verse form in long works from the 14th to 18th centuries collectively called &quot;Chhbap&quot; (&quot;rules&quot; or &quot;codes&quot;). These were traditionally learned by rote. Works such as the &quot;Chhbap Pros&quot; (&quot;Boy&#x27;s Code&quot;), &quot;Chhbap Srey&quot; (&quot;Girl&#x27;s Code&quot;) and &quot;Chhbap Peak Chas&quot; (&quot;Code of Ancient Words&quot;) gave such advice as: a person that does not wake up before sunrise is lazy; a child must tell parents or elders where they go and what time they will return home; always close doors gently, otherwise a bad temper will be assumed; sit in a chair with the legs straight down and not crossed (crossing the legs is a mark of an impolite person); and always let the other person do more talking.

In Cambodia it is not polite to make eye contact with someone who is older or someone who is considered a superior.

==Clothing==

Clothing in Cambodia is one of the most important aspects of the culture. Cambodian fashion differs according to ethnic group and social class. Khmer people traditionally wear a checkered scarf called a &quot;Krama&quot;. The &quot;krama&quot; is what distinctly separates the Khmer (Cambodians) from their neighbors the Thai, the Vietnamese, and the Laotians. The scarf is used for many purposes including for style, protection from the sun, an aid (for the feet) when climbing trees, a hammock for infants, a towel, or as a &quot;sarong&quot;. A &quot;krama&quot; can also be easily shaped into a small child&#x27;s doll for play. Under the Khmer Rouge, krama of various patterns were part of standard clothing.

The long-popular traditional garment known as the &quot;Sampot&quot;, is an Indian-influenced costume which Cambodians have worn since the Funan era. Historically, Khmer clothing has changed depending on the time period and religion. From the Funan era to the Angkor Era, there was a strong Hindu influence in Cambodian fashion which favored wearing Sampots over the lower body and oftentimes nothing from the waist up except jewelry including bracelets and collars such as the &quot;Sarong Kor&quot;, a symbol of Hinduism.

As Buddhism began to replace Hinduism, Khmer people started wearing the blouse, shirt and trousers of Khmer style. Khmer people, both common and royal, stopped wearing the Hindu-style collars and began to adopt beautiful decorated shawls such as &quot;Sbai&quot; instead. This new clothing style was popular in the Udong period. In fact, a Khmer lady habitually chooses the right colour for her Sampot or blouse, both to please herself and to follow the costume of good luck.

Some Cambodians still wear a religious style of clothing. Some Khmer men and women wear a Buddha pendant on a necklace. There are different pendants for different uses; some are meant for protection from evil spirits, some are meant to bring good luck.

Otherwise, in the notable class people in Cambodia, especially the royal caste, have adapted a well known dress as well as expensive fashion style. &quot;Sampot&quot; is still well recognized among the royalty. Since the Udong period, most royalty have retained their dressing habits. Female royalty created the most attractive fashion. The lady always wears a traditional cape called &quot;sbai&quot; or &quot;rabai kanorng&quot;, which is draped over the left shoulder, leaving the right shoulder bare. Rarely was the cape worn over the right shoulder. The sbai or rabai kanorng would have been sumptuously fashioned in the old days in threads of genuine gold or silver. The cape in the old days would have hung down to the hem of the Sampot.
Dancers wear a collar known as &quot;Sarong Kor&quot; around their necks. Importantly, they wear a unique skirt called &quot;Sampot sara-bhap&quot; (lamé), made from silk inter-woven with gold or silver threads, forming elaborate and intricate designs that shimmer as the dancers move. This is held in place with a bejewelled belt. A multitude of jewellery is also worn by the female dancers. These include earrings, several pairs of bangles, a garland of flowers in the form of a bracelet, bracelets, anklets and an armlet that is worn on the right. Several body chains cross over the body like a sash. A circular or diamond-shaped pendant is worn around the neck.

There are several different types of worn by female royalty. The typical that are worn are much similar to those of male royalty. Some crowns are just like tiaras where at the back of the hair is let loose, cascading down the back. Other have a few accessories such as earpieces that would sit above the ear and help hold the in place while a comb at the back is just an added accessory. Flowers are also worn on the in the same style, but the hanging garlands of flowers are worn on the left and the bouquet is worn on the right. The best example of these royal clothes is illustrated by Khmer classical dance costumes, which are an adaptation of the royalty costume.

==Cuisine==

Due to the sustained historic interaction and shared influences, Cambodian cuisine has many similarities with its neighbouring Southeast Asian cuisines of Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Cambodian cuisine is known for using fish sauce in soups, stir-fried cuisine, and as dippings. 
The Chinese influence can be noted in the common &quot;chha&quot; (, Stir frying) and in the use of many variations of rice noodles. In Chinese-Cambodian cuisine, a popular dish is a &quot;pork broth rice noodle soup&quot;, called &quot;kuy tieu&quot; (). Indian influenced dishes include many types of curry known as &quot;kari&quot; () that call for dried spices such as star anise, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg and fennel as well as local ingredients like lemongrass, garlic, kaffir lime leaves, shallots and galangal that give dishes a distinctive Cambodian flavor.
&quot;Banh chaew&quot; (), the Khmer version of the Vietnamese &quot;bánh xèo&quot;, is also a popular dish.

Khmer cuisine is noted for the use of prahok (ប្រហុក), a type of fermented fish paste, in many dishes as a distinctive flavoring. When prahok is not used, it is likely to be &quot;kapǐ&quot; (កាពិ) instead, a kind of fermented shrimp paste. Coconut milk is the main ingredient of many Khmer curries and desserts. Cambodians prefer either jasmine rice or sticky (glutinous) rice. The latter is used more in dessert dishes with fruits such as durian while jasmine rice is eaten with meals. Almost every meal is eaten with a bowl of rice. Typically, Cambodians eat their meals with at least three or four separate dishes.

Regional Cambodian cuisine offers some unique dishes influenced by the traditions of local ethnic groups. In Kampot and Kep, known for its Stir-fried crab with Kampot peppercorn (, &quot;kdam chha mrech Kampot&quot;). This dish is prepared with a local crab fried with the black pepper from area pepper fields. Kula people, an ethnic group of Pailin Province, originated Kola noodles (, &quot;mee Kola&quot;), a vegetarian rice stick noodle dish. In southeastern Cambodia, the influence of Vietnamese cuisine are strong, evidenced by &quot;bánh tráng&quot; which is ubiquitous in southeastern Cambodia but virtually unknown elsewhere. The region between Siem Reap and Kampong Thom, an area with many Chinese Cambodians, displays Khmer versions of many Chinese dishes.

==Arts and literature==
===Visual arts===
The history of visual arts in Cambodia stretches back centuries to ancient crafts; Khmer art reached its peak during the Angkor period. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile weaving such as Cambodian mats, silversmithing, stone carving, lacquerware, ceramics, wat murals, and kite-making. Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the Khmer Rouge. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

===Music===

Especially in the 60s and 70s, the &#x27;big two&#x27; duet of Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Serey Sothea had been a large hit in the country. However, after their deaths, new music stars have tried to bring back the music. Cambodian music has undergone heavy Westernization.

The Cambodian pinpeat ensemble is traditionally heard on feast days in the pagodas. It is also a court ensemble used to accompany classical dance for ritual occasions or theatrical events. The pinpeat is primarily made up of percussion instruments: the roneat ek (lead xylophone), roneat thung (low bamboo xylophone), kong vong touch and kong vong thom (small and large sets of tuned gongs), sampho (two-sided drum), skor thom (two large drums), and sralai (quadruple-reed instrument).

===Dance===
Cambodian dance can be divided into three main categories: classical dance, folk dances, and vernacular dances.

Khmer classical dance is a form of Cambodian dance originally performed only for royalty. The dances have many elements in common with Thai classical dance. During the mid-20th century, it was introduced to the public, where it now remains a celebrated icon of Khmer culture, often being performed during public events, holidays, and for tourists visiting Cambodia. Khmer classical dance is famous for its use of the hands and feet to express emotion; there are 4,000 different gestures in this type of dance. Khmer classical dance, also known as the royal ballet of Cambodia, has been selected as one of UNESCO&#x27;s Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
Khmer folk dances, which are performed for audiences, are fast-paced. The movements and gestures are not as stylized as Khmer classical dance. Folk dancers wear clothes of the people they are portraying such as Chams, hill tribes, farmers, and peasants. The folk dance music is played by a mahori orchestra. A popular folk dance is the Cambodian coconut dance which is a dance performance involving coconuts with male and female dancers. The dance originated around 1960 from Romeas Haek District in Svay Rieng Province.

Cambodian vernacular dances (or social dances) are those danced at social gatherings. Such dances include &quot;Romvong&quot;, &quot;Rom Kbach&quot;, &quot;Rom Saravan,&quot; and &quot;Lam Leav&quot;. Some of these dances have been influenced by the traditional dances of Laos. Other dances, such as &quot;Rom Kbach&quot;, borrow heavily from the classical dance of the royal court. Other social dances from around the world have influenced Cambodian social culture including the cha-cha, the bolero and the Madison.

===Literature===
A testimony of the antiquity of the Khmer language are the multitude of epigraphic inscriptions on stone. The first written proof that has allowed the history of the Khmer Kingdom to be reconstructed are those inscriptions. These writings on columns, stelae and walls throw light on the royal lineages, religious edicts, territorial conquests and internal organization of the kingdom.

Following the stone inscriptions, some of the oldest Khmer documents are translations and commentaries of the Pali Buddhist texts of the Tripitaka. They were written by the monks on palmyra palm leaves and kept in various monasteries throughout the country.

The Reamker (, &quot;Rama&#x27;s Fame&quot;) is the Cambodian version of the Ramayana, the famous Indian epic. The Reamker is composed in rhymed verses and is staged in sections that are adapted to dance movements interpreted by Khmer artists. The Reamker is the most ubiquitous form of traditional Cambodian theatre.

Cambodia had a rich and varied traditional oral literature. There are many legends, tales and songs of very ancient origin that were not put into writing until the arrival of the Europeans. One of the most representative of these tales was the story of Vorvong and Sorvong (Vorvong and Saurivong), a long story about two Khmer princes that was first put into writing by Auguste Pavie. This French civil servant claimed that he had obtained the story from old Uncle Nip in Somrontong District. This story was put into writing in Battambang. In 2006 the Vorvong and Sorvong story was enacted in dance form by the Royal Ballet of Cambodia.

&quot;Tum Teav&quot;, which has been compared to Shakespeare&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet, is probably the most well-known indigenous story, based on a poem first written by a Khmer monk named Sam. A tragic love story set during the Lovek era, it has been told throughout Cambodia since at least the middle of the 19th century. The story has been portrayed in many forms including oral, historical, literary, theatre, and film adaptions. &quot;Tum Teav&quot; also has played a role in Cambodia&#x27;s education, appearing as a topic for the 12th-grade Khmer language examination several times. Although a translation into French had already been made by Étienne Aymonier in 1880, Tum Teav was popularized abroad when writer George Chigas translated the 1915 literary version by the venerable Buddhist monk Preah Botumthera Som or Padumatthera Som, known also as Som, one of the best writers in the Khmer language.
Some talented members of Khmer royalty such as King Ang Duong (1841–1860) and King Thommaracha II (1629–1634) have produced lasting works of literature as well. King Thomaracha wrote a highly esteemed poem for younger Cambodians. The prolific King Ang Duong is most famous for his novel &quot;Kakey&quot;, inspired from a Jataka tale about an unfaithful woman. While not written as a work of instruction, &quot;Kakey&quot; is often used as an example to teach young Khmer girls about the importance of fidelity.

===Shadow Theatre===

Nang Sbek (shadow theatre) (or Lakhaon Nang Sbek; Khmer) is closely related to the Nang Yai of Thailand, Wayang and Indonesia like the islands of Java and Bali, thus implying that Nang Sbek may have an Indonesian origin many centuries ago. Nang Sbek is also a dying art form and may disappear because of the decline in popularity due to the introduction of modern entertainment. Before the spread of modern entertainment such as movies, videos and television the Khmer enjoyed and watched shadow theatre apart from the other sources of entertainment available during that time.
There are three kinds of shadow theatre in Cambodia:

* Nang Sbek Thom is an art that involves mime, song, music as well as dance and narration to the accompaniment of the Pinpeat orchestra. It most often features the Reamker.
* Nang Sbek Toch also called &quot;Nang Kalun&quot; and sometimes called &quot;Ayang&quot; (small shadow theatre) uses smaller puppets and a wide range of stories.
* Sbek Paor (coloured puppet theatre) uses coloured leather puppets.

===Film===
Cinema in Cambodia began in the 1950s; King Norodom Sihanouk himself was an avid film enthusiast. Many films were being screened in theaters throughout the country by the 1960s, which are regarded as the &quot;golden age&quot;. After a decline during the Khmer Rouge regime, competition from video and television has meant that the Cambodian film industry is relatively weak today.

==Sports and Games==
Cambodia has increasingly become involved in sports over the last 30 years. Football is popular as are martial arts, pradal serey (Khmer kick boxing), volleyball, dragon boat racing and Khmer traditional wrestling. Many sports are celebrated during holidays.

Bokator is a traditional Cambodian martial art that dates back over a thousand years. It involves a variety of strikes, kicks, throws, and ground fighting techniques, often inspired by animal movements. It has been added to UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2022.

Dragon boat racing is a popular sport in Cambodia. The largest sporting event in the country is the boat races at the Bon Om Touk festival.

Pradal serey, or traditional Khmer kickboxing, is a popular sport in Cambodia. It is a combat sport involving clinching and striking. Matches are between young athletic people.

Khmer traditional wrestling is yet another popular Cambodian sport. A wrestling match consists of three rounds, which may be won by forcing an opponent to his back. Traditional matches are held during the Khmer New Year and other Cambodian holidays.
Ox cart racing is a sport in Cambodia that takes place during the Khmer New Year. It is done to preserve Cambodian culture.

Football was brought to Cambodia by the French. The Cambodian Football Federation is the governing body of football in Cambodia, controlling the Cambodian national football team. It was founded in 1933, and has been a member of FIFA since 1953, and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) since 1957. The Cambodian League is the highest level of professional football in the country.

Cambodians play a local version of chess called Ouk Chatrang. Another version of chess called Ouk-Khmer (Hill&#x27;s version) was thought to have been played in Cambodia.

<text>A nautical almanac is a publication describing the positions of a selection of celestial bodies for the purpose of enabling navigators to use celestial navigation to determine the position of their ship while at sea. The Almanac specifies for each whole hour of the year the position on the Earth&#x27;s surface (in declination and Greenwich hour angle) at which the Sun, Moon, planets, and First Point of Aries is directly overhead. The positions of 57 selected stars are specified relative to the First Point of Aries.

In Great Britain, &quot;The Nautical Almanac&quot; has been published annually by HM Nautical Almanac Office, ever since the first edition was published in 1767.
In the United States, a nautical almanac has been published annually by the US Naval Observatory since 1852. It was originally titled &quot;American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac&quot;. Since 1958, the USNO and HMNAO have jointly published a unified nautical almanac, &quot;The Astronomical Almanac&quot; for use by the navies of both countries. Almanac data is now available online from the US Naval Observatory.
Also commercial almanacs were produced that combined other information. A good example would be Brown&#x27;s, which commenced in 1877, and is still produced annually, its early 20th-century subtitle being &quot;Harbour and Dock Guide and Advertiser and Daily Tide Tables&quot;. This combination of trade advertising, and information &quot;by permission... of the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty&quot; provided a useful compendium of information. More recent editions have kept up with the changes in technology: the 1924 edition, for instance, had extensive advertisements for coaling stations. Meanwhile, the Reeds Nautical Almanac, published by Adlard Coles Nautical, has been in print since 1932, and in 1944 was used by landing craft involved in the Normandy landings.

The &quot;Air Almanac&quot; of the United States and Great Britain tabulates celestial coordinates for 10-minute intervals for use in aerial navigation. The Sokkia Corporation&#x27;s annual &quot;Celestial Observation Handbook and Ephemeris&quot; tabulated daily celestial coordinates (to a tenth of an arcsecond) for the Sun and nine stars; it was last published for 2008.

To find the position of a ship or aircraft by celestial navigation, the navigator measures with a sextant the apparent height of a celestial body above the horizon, and notes the time from a marine chronometer. That height is compared with the height predicted for a trial position; the arcminutes of height difference is how many nautical miles the position line is from the trial position.

<doc id="899082" wikidata="Q991932" url="?curid=899082" title="Truss (medicine)">
<text>In medicine, a truss is a kind of surgical appliance, particularly one used for hernia patients. A truss provides support for the herniated area, using a pad and belt arrangement to hold it in the correct position, just when it is put on before moving from bed.

Of historical interest, a variety of trusses are listed in the Snowden &amp; Brother&#x27;s catalog of the American Civil War era.

Early versions of the hernia truss were daunting contraptions made from leather and steel with metal springs. The 19th century Eggleston&#x27;s Truss from Chicago was described as follows:

&quot;Eggleston&#x27;s Truss has a pad different from all others. It is cup-shaped, with a self-adjusting ball in the centre, and adapts itself to all positions of the body, while the ball in the cup presses back the intestines just as a person does with the finger. With light pressure the hernia is held securely day and night, and a radical cure is certain. It is easy, durable and cheap.&quot;

Later developments resulted in the Cluthe truss, described in Cluthe&#x27;s Advice to the Ruptured, first published in 1912. This book also describes dozens of hernia cases which appeared to be cured by this relatively primitive truss. Such testimonials are no longer considered to be scientific evidence.

Currently most doctors and surgeons do not prescribe trusses. Even some of today&#x27;s trusses use metal springs to apply pressure to the hernia, via a pad which can be quite hard, and usually bulges into the hernia. This inward bulging prevents the edges of the hernia from coming together and could, in theory, enlarge the hernia. Many trusses also do not fit well. It is difficult to design a truss which keeps the pad permanently in contact with the hernia. Unless a truss can achieve this purpose, the hernia may continue to enlarge.

External devices such as a truss to maintain reduction of the hernia without repairing the underlying defect can be used to avoid surgical risks, mainly chronic pain risk.

<text>In geometry, a cissoid () is a plane curve generated from two given curves , and a point (the pole). Let be a variable line passing through and intersecting at and at . Let be the point on so that formula_1 (There are actually two such points but is chosen so that is in the same direction from as is from .) Then the locus of such points is defined to be the cissoid of the curves , relative to .

Slightly different but essentially equivalent definitions are used by different authors. For example, may be defined to be the point so that formula_2 This is equivalent to the other definition if is replaced by its reflection through . Or may be defined as the midpoint of and ; this produces the curve generated by the previous curve scaled by a factor of 1/2.

==Equations==
If and are given in polar coordinates by formula_3 and formula_4 respectively, then the equation formula_5 describes the cissoid of and relative to the origin. However, because a point may be represented in multiple ways in polar coordinates, there may be other branches of the cissoid which have a different equation. Specifically, is also given by 
:formula_6
So the cissoid is actually the union of the curves given by the equations 
:formula_7
It can be determined on an individual basis depending on the periods of and , which of these equations can be eliminated due to duplication.
For example, let and both be the ellipse
:formula_8
The first branch of the cissoid is given by 
:formula_9
which is simply the origin. The ellipse is also given by 
:formula_10
so a second branch of the cissoid is given by
:formula_11
which is an oval shaped curve.

If each and are given by the parametric equations
:formula_12
and
:formula_13
then the cissoid relative to the origin is given by 
:formula_14

==Specific cases==
When is a circle with center then the cissoid is conchoid of .

When and are parallel lines then the cissoid is a third line parallel to the given lines.

===Hyperbolas===
Let and be two non-parallel lines and let be the origin. Let the polar equations of and be 
:formula_15
and
:formula_16
By rotation through angle formula_17 we can assume that formula_18 Then the cissoid of and relative to the origin is given by
:formula_19
Combining constants gives
:formula_20
which in Cartesian coordinates is
:formula_21
This is a hyperbola passing through the origin. So the cissoid of two non-parallel lines is a hyperbola containing the pole. A similar derivation show that, conversely, any hyperbola is the cissoid of two non-parallel lines relative to any point on it.

===Cissoids of Zahradnik===
A cissoid of Zahradnik (named after Karel Zahradnik) is defined as the cissoid of a conic section and a line relative to any point on the conic. This is a broad family of rational cubic curves containing several well-known examples. Specifically:
* The Trisectrix of Maclaurin given by
::formula_22
:is the cissoid of the circle formula_23 and the line formula_24 relative to the origin.

* The right strophoid
::formula_25
:is the cissoid of the circle formula_23 and the line formula_27 relative to the origin.

* The cissoid of Diocles
::formula_28
:is the cissoid of the circle formula_23 and the line formula_30 relative to the origin. This is, in fact, the curve for which the family is named and some authors refer to this as simply as cissoid.

* The cissoid of the circle formula_23 and the line formula_32 where is a parameter, is called a Conchoid of de Sluze. (These curves are not actually conchoids.) This family includes the previous examples.
*The folium of Descartes
::formula_33
:is the cissoid of the ellipse formula_34 and the line formula_35 relative to the origin. To see this, note that the line can be written
::formula_36
:and the ellipse can be written
::formula_37
:So the cissoid is given by
::formula_38
:which is a parametric form of the folium.

<doc id="899095" wikidata="Q7332962" url="?curid=899095" title="Riding association">
<text>An electoral district association (), commonly known as a riding association () or constituency association, is the basic unit of a political party at the level of the electoral district (&quot;riding&quot;) in Canadian politics. Major political parties attempt to have a riding association in each constituency, although usually these associations are more active in ridings where the party has an elected Member of Parliament or has a reasonable chance of electing an MP in the future, and less active in ridings where the party&#x27;s prospects have historically been poor.

Most riding associations have an elected executive and attempt to have activities for local party members at regular intervals. At a minimum, riding associations hold an annual general meeting to elect the executive and meetings to elect delegates to national and regional party policy conventions. Riding associations are most active during election campaigns when they participate, along with the party&#x27;s national or regional campaign teams, in organizing the riding&#x27;s election campaign. In addition, the party constitution usually allows each riding association to hold a nomination meeting, which selects the party&#x27;s local candidate. However, some party constitutions allow the leader to bypass the riding association and appoint a candidate of his or her choosing, although virtually all parties maintain limits on the number of ridings where the leader may do so.

The other time when riding associations are most active are in the lead up to leadership conventions. Riding associations were more important in this aspect in the past, when they would elect supporters of a particular leadership candidate to participate as delegates at a leadership convention. Many parties, however, have moved away from the delegated system of electing a leader to a one member, one vote system in which all party members vote by ballot.

However, as the riding association remains the prime point of contact between members and the party they remain important for leadership candidates in their attempt to gain support, and prospective leadership candidates will often attempt to win control of a riding association&#x27;s executive when it is elected at the annual general meeting even if a leadership election is not anticipated for several years.

Riding associations also exist at the provincial level and operate in the same manner.

<doc id="899096" wikidata="Q240691" url="?curid=899096" title="Retained earnings">
<text>The retained earnings (also known as plowback) of a corporation is the accumulated net income of the corporation that is retained by the corporation at a particular point in time, such as at the end of the reporting period. At the end of that period, the net income (or net loss) at that point is transferred from the Profit and Loss Account to the retained earnings account. If the balance of the retained earnings account is negative it may be called accumulated losses, retained losses, accumulated deficit, or similar terminology.

Any part of a credit balance in the account can be capitalised, by the issue of bonus shares, and the balance is available for distribution of dividends to shareholders, and the residue is carried forward into the next period. Some laws, including those of most states in the United States require that dividends be only paid out of the positive balance of the retained earnings account at the time that payment is to be made. This protects creditors from a company being liquidated through dividends. A few states, however, allow payment of dividends to continue to increase a corporation’s accumulated deficit. This is known as a liquidating dividend or liquidating cash dividend.

In accounting, the retained earnings at the end of one accounting period are the opening retained earnings in the next period, to which is added the net income or net loss for that period and from which is deducted the bonus shares issued in the year and dividends paid in that period.

If a company is publicly held, the balance of retained earnings account that is negatively referred to as &quot;accumulated deficit&quot; may appear in the Accountant&#x27;s Opinion in what is called the &quot;Ongoing Concern&quot; statement located at the end of required SEC financial reporting at the end of each quarter.

Retained earnings are reported in the shareholders&#x27; equity section of the corporation&#x27;s balance sheet. Corporations with net accumulated losses may refer to negative shareholders&#x27; equity as positive &quot;shareholders&#x27; deficit&quot;. A report of the movements in retained earnings is presented along with other comprehensive income and changes in share capital in the statement of changes in equity.

Due to the nature of double-entry accrual accounting, retained earnings do not represent surplus cash available to a company. Rather, they represent how the company has managed its profits (i.e. whether it has distributed them as dividends or reinvested them in the business). When reinvested, those retained earnings are reflected as increases in assets (which could include cash) or reductions to liabilities on the balance sheet.

==Stockholders&#x27; equity ==
When total assets are greater than total liabilities, stockholders have a positive equity (positive book value). Conversely, when total liabilities are greater than total assets, stockholders have a negative stockholders&#x27; equity (negative book value) — also sometimes called stockholders&#x27; deficit. A stockholders&#x27; deficit does not mean that stockholders owe money to the corporation as they own only its net assets and are not accountable for its liabilities, though it is one of the definitions of insolvency. This means that the value of the assets of the company must rise above its liabilities before the stockholders hold positive equity value in the company.

:Retained earnings = opening retained earnings + current year net profit from p&amp;l a/c – dividends paid in the current year

==Tax implications==
A company is normally subject to a company tax on the net income of the company in a financial year. The amount added to retained earnings is generally the after tax net income. In most cases in most jurisdictions no tax is payable on the accumulated earnings retained by a company. However, this creates a potential for tax avoidance, because the corporate tax rate is usually lower than the higher marginal rates for some individual taxpayers. Higher income taxpayers could &quot;park&quot; income inside a private company instead of being paid out as a dividend and then taxed at the individual rates. To remove this tax benefit, some jurisdictions impose an &quot;undistributed profits tax&quot; on retained earnings of private companies, usually at the highest individual marginal tax rate.

The issue of bonus shares, even if funded out of retained earnings, will in most jurisdictions not be treated as a dividend distribution and not taxed in the hands of the shareholder.

Retaining earnings by a company increases the company&#x27;s shareholder equity, which increases the value of each shareholder&#x27;s shareholding. This increases the share price, which may result in a capital gains tax liability when the shares are disposed of.

The decision of whether a corporation should retain net income or have it paid out as dividends depends on several factors including, but not limited to:

*Tax treatment of dividends, and
*Funds required for reinvestment in the corporation (called retention).

A number of factors affect the decision of the amount of profit that a corporation should retain, including:
*Quantum of net profit.
*Age of the business enterprise
*Dividend policy of the corporation
*Future plan regarding modernization and expansion.

<text>The University of Zagreb (, ) is a public research university in Zagreb, Croatia. It is the largest Croatian university and one of the oldest continuously operating universities in Europe. The University of Zagreb and the University North are the only public universities operating in Northern and Central Croatia.

The history of the University began on September 23, 1669, when the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I issued a decree granting the establishment of the &quot;Jesuit Academy of the Royal Free City of Zagreb&quot;. The decree was accepted at the Council of the Croatian Kingdom on November 3, 1671. The Academy was run by the Jesuits for more than a century until the order was dissolved by Pope Clement XIV in 1773. In 1776, Empress Maria Theresa issued a decree founding the &quot;Royal Academy of Science&quot; which succeeded the previous Jesuit Academy. Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer proposed the founding of a University to the Croatian Parliament in 1861. Emperor Franz Joseph signed the decree on the establishment of the University of Zagreb in 1869. The Act of Founding was passed by the Parliament in 1874, and was ratified by the Emperor on January 5, 1874. On October 19, 1874, the &quot;Royal University of Franz Joseph I&quot; was officially opened.

The University is composed of 29 faculties, 3 art academies and 1 university center with more than 70,000 students.

==History==

===Academy===

The beginnings of the later university date back to 23 September 1669 when Emperor and King Leopold I Habsburg issued a decree granting the establishment of the Jesuit Academy of the Royal Free City of Zagreb. According to that document the study of philosophy in Zagreb acquired a formal and legal status as &quot;Neoacademia Zagrabiensis&quot; and officially became a public institution of higher education.
The academy was run by the Jesuits for more than a century until the order was dissolved by Pope Clement XIV in 1773. Under a new leadership in 1772 the academy enrolled a total of 200 students.

In 1776 Empress and Queen Maria Theresa issued a decree founding the Royal Academy of Science (). It consisted of three studies or faculties of philosophy, theology, and law. The former political-cameral studies became part of the newly established faculty of law, and thus were integrated into the academy. Each of the faculties of the Royal Academy of Sciences had several chairs teaching one or several courses. During the Austro-Turkish War of 1788–1791 and following the Austrian occupation of Belgrade on 8 October 1789 the Royal Academy requested to be granted the university status with the following argumentation:
The academy in Zagreb remained until 1874, despite numerous organizational changes, the focal institution of higher education in Croatia, educating most of the members of the Croatian intelligentsia.

===University===


Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer in 1861 proposed to the Croatian Parliament the founding of a university at Zagreb. During his visit in 1869, the Emperor Franz Joseph signed the decree on the establishment of the University of Zagreb. Five years later, the Parliament passed the Act of Founding, which was ratified by the Emperor on 5 January 1874. On 19 October 1874, a ceremony was held in the name of the founding of the &quot;Royal University of Franz Joseph I in Zagreb&quot;, making it the third university in the Hungarian realm of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

In 1874 the University had four faculties:
* Law (&quot;Pravno-državoslovni fakultet&quot;)
* Theology (&quot;Bogoslovni fakultet&quot;)
* Philosophy (&quot;Mudroslovni fakultet&quot;)
* Medicine (&quot;Liječnički fakultet&quot;)

The Faculty of Medicine was not put into function in 1874; it had to wait until 1917. The Faculty of Philosophy served as the general scientific faculty. Since 1876 it had geology, botany, physics, mathematics, and chemistry; since 1877 zoology; since 1882 pharmacy; since 1883 geography.

In 1860, the Royal Agriculture and Forestry College was founded in Križevci. In 1898, the Academy of Forestry (&quot;Šumarska akademija&quot;) was founded as part of the Faculty of Philosophy, which encompassed all technical studies. In 1919, this school became the Faculty of Husbandry and Forestry.

In 1919, the School of Technology (&quot;Tehnička visoka škola&quot;) was founded, which was transformed into a university faculty in 1926. Also in 1919 the School of Veterinary Medicine (&quot;Veterinarska visoka škola&quot;) was founded; it transformed into a university faculty in 1925. From 1920 to 1924 shortly existed Faculty of Eastern Orthodox Theology.

In the Faculty of Philosophy, major reorganization ensued in the 1920s, as mathematics, pharmacy and other sciences started to split off, first with the creation of separate mathematics and pharmaceutical departments in 1928, when the faculty was renamed into its current name &quot;Filozofski fakultet&quot;.

In 1926, the university was composed of seven faculties:
* Theology (&quot;Bogoslovni fakultet&quot;)
* Law (&quot;Pravnički fakultet&quot;)
* Medicine (&quot;Liječnički fakultet&quot;)
* Philosophy (&quot;Mudroslovni fakultet&quot;)
** Philosophy dept. (&quot;Filozofski odjel&quot;)
** Pharmacy dept. (&quot;Farmaceutski odjel&quot;)
* Husbandry and Forestry (&quot;Gospodarsko-šumarski fakultet&quot;)
* Veterinary Medicine (&quot;Veterinarski fakultet&quot;)
* Technology (&quot;Tehnički fakultet&quot;)
** Construction dept. (&quot;Građevni odsjek&quot;)
** Engineering dept. (&quot;Strojarski odsjek&quot;)
** Chemical engineering dept. (&quot;Kemijsko-inženjerski odsjek&quot;)

On 26 August 1936 a group of Macedonian students belonging to the MANAPO signed the &quot;Political Declaration&quot;, an illegal document requesting political and social emancipation of Macedonians in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

During the Independent State of Croatia (1941–1945), the university was known as the &quot;Croatian University&quot; (Hrvatsko sveučilište).

The individual departments of the Faculty of Philosophy became separate faculties in 1942, 1946 when the Faculty of Sciences was formed, and finally in 1963.

In 1956, the Faculty of Technology was divided into four faculties:
* Architecture-Construction-Geodesy (&quot;Arhitektonsko-građevinsko-geodetski fakultet&quot;)
* Electrical engineering (&quot;Elektrotehnički fakultet&quot;)
* Mechanical engineering-Shipbuilding (&quot;Strojarsko-brodograđevni fakultet&quot;)
* Chemistry-Food technology-Mining (&quot;Tehnološki fakultet&quot;)

These eventually split up into the current layout.

In 1999., the University decided to implement European Credit Transfer System – ECTS. When Croatia signed to be a part of The Bologna declaration, all of the universities in Croatia adopted this system of easily readable and comparable degrees.

University offers 160 undergraduate programmes (ba/bsc), 22 integrated undergraduate-graduate programmes, 9 vocational undergraduate programmes, 174 graduate programmes (ma/msc), 1 vocational graduate programme, 72 doctoral programmes (PhD) and 165 specialist postgraduate programmes.

===Philosophy and Religious Sciences===

Faculty of Philosophy and Religious Sciences (FFRZ) is a part of the University of Zagreb, Croatia It remains a work of the Society of Jesus and traces its origins to 1662.

FFRZ in Zagreb began as a Jesuit school of philosophy on 6 November 1662 with the establishment of the Philosophy Department at Zagreb College, which would become the University of Zagreb.

The Faculty of Philosophy of the Society of Jesus (FFDI) closed in 1773 due to the suppression of the Society of Jesus, and the Jesuit philosophy school in Zagreb did not reopen until 1937, when it offered a three-year course leading to the licentiate in philosophy, as it does today.

On 31 July 1989 the Congregation for Catholic Education of the Holy See decreed that the Faculty of Philosophy could confer the baccalaureate, licentiate, and doctorate in philosophy.

With a decision of 7 October 1992, the Ministry of Science and Technology entered FFDI into the register as a Scientific Research Organization in philosophy and it became a part of the Croatian Studies Department of the University of Zagreb.

On 8 December 2016, the Senate of the University of Zagreb determined that FFDI would become a faculty and equal component of the University under the title Faculty of Philosophy and Religious Sciences (FFRZ).

Undergraduates may major in Philosophy and Religious Sciences, Philosophy, or Philosophy and Latin Language. Graduate students may major in Philosophy or Religious Science. FFRZ also offers post-graduate studies.

FFRZ has a formal relationship with Laudato TV to &quot;work together to promote and implement educational, cultural and scientific activities in the Christian and humanistic atmosphere&quot;.
In 2017 there were two current research studies at the Faculty of Philosophy and Religious Sciences:
* Practical ethics and commitment to the common good in times of crisis. Is there a place for virtue in Croatian society?
* Christian philosophy within the Croatian philosophy of the 20th century.
On 5 May 2017 a symposium was held on &quot;Religions and Migration: Displaced Persons and Refugees&quot;.

The faculty is led by a chancellor and his deputy along with a dean and vice-dean. The chancellor is Arturo Sosa, General Superior of the Society of Jesus based in Rome. His deputy is Dalibor Renić, Provincial Superior of the Croatian Province of the Society of Jesus based in Zagreb. The dean is Prof. Ivan Koprek, The Faculty Council is composed of all regular and extraordinary professors and the Faculty Conference includes all current lecturers, student representatives, and faculty officials.

<text>The instantaneous Earth–Moon distance, or distance to the Moon, is the distance from the center of Earth to the center of the Moon. In contrast, the Lunar distance (LD or formula_1), or Earth–Moon characteristic distance, is a unit of measure in astronomy. More technically, it is the semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit. The average lunar distance is approximately , or 1.28 light-seconds; this is roughly 30 times Earth&#x27;s diameter. Around 389 lunar distances make up an astronomical unit (roughly the distance from Earth to the Sun).

Lunar distance is commonly used to express the distance to near-Earth object encounters. Lunar semi-major axis is an important astronomical datum. It has implications for testing gravitational theories such as general relativity and for refining other astronomical values, such as the mass, radius, and rotation of Earth. The measurement is also useful in measuring the lunar radius, as well as the distance to the Sun.

Millimeter-precision measurements of the lunar distance are made by measuring the time taken for laser light to travel between stations on Earth and retroreflectors placed on the Moon. The precision of the range measurements determines the semi-major axis to a few decimeters. The Moon is spiraling away from Earth at an average rate of per year, as detected by the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment.

==Value==

Because of the influence of the Sun and other perturbations, the Moon&#x27;s orbit around the Earth is not a precise ellipse. Nevertheless, different methods have been used to define a semi-major axis. Ernest William Brown provided a formula for the parallax of the Moon as viewed from opposite sides of the Earth, involving trigonometric terms. This is equivalent to a formula for the inverse of the distance, and the average value of this is the inverse of . On the other hand, the time-averaged distance (rather than the inverse of the average inverse distance) between the centers of Earth and the Moon is . One can also model the orbit as an ellipse that is constantly changing, and in this case one can find a formula for the semi-major axis, again involving trigonometric terms. The average value by this method is 383,397 km.

The actual distance varies over the course of the orbit of the Moon. Values at closest approach (perigee) or at farthest (apogee) are rarer the more extreme they are. The graph at right shows the distribution of perigee and apogee over six thousand years.

Jean Meeus gives the following extreme values for 1500 BC to AD 8000:

* greatest distance: 406 719.97 km on January 7, AD 2266
* smallest distance: 356 352.93 km on November 13, 1054 BC

*An AU is Lunar distances.
*A lightyear is 24,611,700 Lunar distances.
*Geostationary Earth Orbit is from Earth center, or LD LD (or LDEO)


== Variation ==

The instantaneous lunar distance is constantly changing. The actual distance between the Moon and Earth can change as quickly as , or more than in just 6 hours, due to its non-circular orbit. There are other effects that also influence the lunar distance. Some factors are listed in the sections below.

=== Perturbations and eccentricity ===
The distance to the Moon can be measured to an accuracy of over a 1-hour sampling period, which results in an overall uncertainty of a decimeter for the semi-major axis. However, due to its elliptical orbit with varying eccentricity, the instantaneous distance varies with monthly periodicity. Furthermore, the distance is perturbed by the gravitational effects of various astronomical bodies – most significantly the Sun and less so Venus and Jupiter. Other forces responsible for minute perturbations are: gravitational attraction to other planets in the Solar System and to asteroids; tidal forces; and relativistic effects. The effect of radiation pressure from the Sun contributes an amount of ± to the lunar distance.

Although the instantaneous uncertainty is a few millimeters, the measured lunar distance can change by more than from the mean value throughout a typical month. These perturbations are well understood and the lunar distance can be accurately modeled over thousands of years.


=== Tidal dissipation ===
Through the action of tidal forces, the angular momentum of Earth&#x27;s rotation is slowly being transferred to the Moon&#x27;s orbit. The result is that Earth&#x27;s rate of spin is gradually decreasing (at a rate of ), and the lunar orbit is gradually expanding. The rate of recession is . However, it is believed that this rate has recently increased, as a rate of would imply that the Moon is only 1.5 billion years old, whereas scientific consensus supports an age of about 4 billion years. It is also believed that this anomalously high rate of recession may continue to accelerate.

Theoretically, the lunar distance will continue to increase until the Earth and Moon become tidally locked, as are Pluto and Charon. This would occur when the duration of the lunar orbital period equals the rotational period of Earth, which is estimated to be 47 Earth days. The two bodies would then be at equilibrium, and no further rotational energy would be exchanged. However, models predict that 50 billion years would be required to achieve this configuration, which is significantly longer than the expected lifetime of the Solar System.

=== Orbital history ===
Laser measurements show that the average lunar distance is increasing, which implies that the Moon was closer in the past, and that Earth&#x27;s days were shorter. Fossil studies of mollusk shells from the Campanian era (80 million years ago) show that there were 372 days (of 23 h 33 min) per year during that time, which implies that the lunar distance was about (383,000 km or 238,000 mi). There is geological evidence that the average lunar distance was about (332,000 km or 205,000 mi) during the Precambrian Era; 2500 million years BP.

The widely accepted giant impact hypothesis states that the Moon was created as a result of a catastrophic impact between Earth and another planet, resulting in a re-accumulation of fragments at an initial distance of (24,000 km or 15,000 mi). This theory assumes the initial impact to have occurred 4.5 billion years ago.

== History of measurement ==
Until the late 1950s most measurements of lunar distance were based on optical angular measurements: the earliest accurate measurement was by Aristarchus of Samos, and later Hipparchus in the 2nd century BC. The space age marked a turning point when the precision of this value was much improved. During the 1950s and 1960s, there were experiments using radar, lasers, and spacecraft, conducted with the benefit of computer processing and modeling.

Some historically significant or otherwise interesting methods of determining the lunar distance:

=== Eclipses ===
The earliest account of attempts to measure the lunar distance using an eclipse were by Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus in 270 BC. He exploited observations of a lunar eclipse combined with knowledge of Earth&#x27;s radius and an understanding that the Sun is much further than the Moon. By observing the duration of an eclipse, which is about 4 hours, and comparing that to the orbital period of the moon (28 days), the circumference of the moon&#x27;s orbit was determined.

Later, in 129 BC, Hipparchus performed a calculation based on observing a solar eclipse from two separate locations. In one location, the eclipse was complete, but in another, the sun was partially visible. Using trigonometry, his calculations produced a result of . This method later found its way into the work of Ptolemy, who produced a result of ( or ) at its farthest point.

=== Parallax ===
Early methods involved measuring the angle between the Moon and a chosen reference point from multiple locations, simultaneously. The synchronization can be coordinated by making measurements at a pre-determined time, or during an event which is observable to all parties. Before accurate mechanical chronometers, the synchronization event was typically a lunar eclipse, occultation, or the moment when the Moon crossed the meridian (if the observers shared the same longitude). This measurement technique is known as lunar parallax.

For increased accuracy, the measured angle can be adjusted to account for refraction and distortion of light passing through the atmosphere.

=== Meridian crossing ===
An expedition by French astronomer A.C.D. Crommelin observed lunar meridian transits on the same night from two different locations. Careful measurements from 1905 to 1910 measured the angle of elevation at the moment when a specific lunar crater (Mösting A) crossed the local meridian, from stations at Greenwich and at Cape of Good Hope. A distance was calculated with an uncertainty of , and this remained the definitive lunar distance value for the next half century.

=== Occultations ===
By recording the instant when the Moon occults a background star, (or similarly, measuring the angle between the Moon and a background star at a predetermined moment) the lunar distance can be determined, as long as the measurements are taken from multiple locations of known separation.

Astronomers O&#x27;Keefe and Anderson calculated the lunar distance by observing four occultations from nine locations in 1952. They calculated a semi-major axis of ( ± ). This value was refined in 1962 by Irene Fischer, who incorporated updated geodetic data to produce a value of ( ± ).

=== Radar ===
The distance to the moon was directly measured by means of radar first in 1946 as part of Project Diana.

Later, an experiment was conducted in 1957 at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory that used the echo from radar signals to determine the Earth-Moon distance. Radar pulses lasting were broadcast from a diameter radio dish. After the radio waves echoed off the surface of the Moon, the return signal was detected and the delay time measured. From that measurement, the distance could be calculated. In practice, however, the signal-to-noise ratio was so low that an accurate measurement could not be reliably produced.

The experiment was repeated in 1958 at the Royal Radar Establishment, in England. Radar pulses lasting were transmitted with a peak power of 2 megawatts, at a repetition rate of 260 pulses per second. After the radio waves echoed off the surface of the Moon, the return signal was detected and the delay time measured. Multiple signals were added together to obtain a reliable signal by superimposing oscilloscope traces onto photographic film. From the measurements, the distance was calculated with an uncertainty of .

These initial experiments were intended to be proof-of-concept experiments and only lasted one day. Follow-on experiments lasting one month produced a semi-major axis of ( ± ), which was the most precise measurement of the lunar distance at the time.

=== Laser ranging ===

An experiment which measured the round-trip time of flight of laser pulses reflected directly off the surface of the Moon was performed in 1962, by a team from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a Soviet team at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory.

During the Apollo missions in 1969, astronauts placed retroreflectors on the surface of the Moon for the purpose of refining the accuracy and precision of this technique. The measurements are ongoing and involve multiple laser facilities. The instantaneous precision of the Lunar Laser Ranging experiments can achieve small millimeter resolution, and is the most reliable method of determining the lunar distance. The semi-major axis is determined to be 384,399.0 km.

=== Amateur astronomers and citizen scientists ===

Due to the modern accessibility of accurate timing devices, high resolution digital cameras, GPS receivers, powerful computers and near-instantaneous communication, it has become possible for amateur astronomers to make high accuracy measurements of the lunar distance.

On May 23, 2007, digital photographs of the Moon during a near-occultation of Regulus were taken from two locations, in Greece and England. By measuring the parallax between the Moon and the chosen background star, the lunar distance was calculated.

A more ambitious project called the &quot;Aristarchus Campaign&quot; was conducted during the lunar eclipse of 15 April 2014. During this event, participants were invited to record a series of five digital photographs from moonrise until culmination (the point of greatest altitude).

The method took advantage of the fact that the Moon is actually closest to an observer when it is at its highest point in the sky, compared to when it is on the horizon. Although it appears that the Moon is biggest when it is near the horizon, the opposite is true. This phenomenon is known as the Moon illusion. The reason for the difference in distance is that the distance from the center of the Moon to the center of the Earth is nearly constant throughout the night, but an observer on the surface of Earth is actually 1 Earth radius from the center of Earth. This offset brings them closest to the Moon when it is overhead.

Modern cameras have achieved a resolution capable of capturing the Moon with enough precision to detect and measure this tiny variation in apparent size. The results of this experiment were calculated as LD = . The accepted value for that night was , which implied a accuracy. The benefit of this method is that the only measuring equipment needed is a modern digital camera (equipped with an accurate clock, and a GPS receiver).

Other experimental methods of measuring the lunar distance that can be performed by amateur astronomers involve:
* Taking pictures of the Moon before it enters the penumbra and after it is completely eclipsed.
* Measuring, as precisely as possible, the time of the eclipse contacts. 
* Taking good pictures of the partial eclipse when the shape and size of the Earth shadow are clearly visible. 
* Taking a picture of the Moon including, in the same field of view, Spica and Mars – from various locations.

== Calculations ==
The collection of tables that describe the moon&#x27;s position is called lunar ephemeris. Modern methods compute the ephemeris using equations which accommodate for the known perturbation effects. These include gravitational forces of the Earth, Sun, and other planets, and also minor variation due to tidal forces, relativistic effects, and changes within the solar system.

The formula for ephemeris ELP2000, by Chapront and Touzé for the distance in kilometers begins with the terms:

:formula_2
Where formula_3 is the mean anomaly (more or less how moon has moved from perigee) and formula_4 is the mean elongation (more or less how far it has moved from conjunction with the Sun at new moon). They can be calculated from

G = 134.963 411 38° + 13.064 992 953 630°/d · t

D = 297.850 204 20° + 12.190 749 117 502°/d · t

where t is the time (in days) since January 1, 2000 (see Epoch (astronomy)).
This shows that the smallest perigee occurs at either new moon or full moon (ca ), as does the greatest apogee (ca ), whereas the greatest perigee will be around half-moon (ca ), as will be the smallest apogee (ca ). The exact values will be slightly different due to other terms. Twice in every full moon cycle of about 411 days there will be a minimal perigee and a maximal apogee, separated by two weeks, and a maximal perigee and a minimal apogee, also separated by two weeks.

<doc id="899150" wikidata="Q7892641" url="?curid=899150" title="2004 United States presidential debates">
<text>The 2004 United States presidential debates were a series of debates held during the 2004 presidential election. 

The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), a bipartisan organization formed in 1987, organized four debates among the major party candidates, sponsored three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate. Only Republican nominee George W. Bush and Democratic nominee John Kerry met the criteria for inclusion in the debates, and thus were the only two to appear in the debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The CPD-sponsored vice presidential debate took place between their respective vice presidential running mates, Dick Cheney and John Edwards.

An alternative was proposed by the Citizens&#x27; Debate Commission, but was not carried out. There were several third-party candidate debates also held independently from the CPD-sponsored debates. The debates were the latest in a series of presidential debates first held during the 1960 presidential election and held every four years since the 1976 election.

Post-debate polls generally suggested that the 2004 presidential debates were a positive factor for John Kerry&#x27;s candidacy, as CNN/USA Today/Gallup immediate post-debate polls showed that Kerry clearly won the first and third debates in the eyes of the American television audience, and he tied with Bush in the second. In the follow-up polls taken days after the first two debates, Kerry&#x27;s perceived positive performance in the debates increased, so that the public then saw Kerry, rather than Bush, as the winner of all three debates.

==Participant selection==
According to the Commission on Presidential Debates, the predetermined criteria for selecting candidates to participate in its 2004 presidential debates are based on evidence of eligibility as defined in Article Two of the United States Constitution), evidence of ballot access, and evidence of electoral support based on national public opinion polls.

Participants must have appeared on enough state ballots to have at least a mathematical chance of securing the Electoral College majority needed to win the election. While several third-party candidates met the eligibility and ballot access criteria, none had the support of at least 15 percent of the national electorate based on the average of five selected national public opinion polling organizations. The criteria also specified that invitations to the CPD&#x27;s vice-presidential debate would be extended to the running mates of the candidates participating in the first presidential debate.

Only President George W. Bush and U.S. Senator John Kerry met the CPD selection criteria for any of the presidential debates. As a result, only Vice President Dick Cheney and Senator John Edwards met the criteria for the vice presidential debate.

On October 1, 2004, the Arizona Libertarian Party (AZLP) filed suit against the Commission on Presidential Debates and Arizona State University in the Superior Court of Arizona for Maricopa County regarding the staging of the third presidential debate. They contested that the debate, to be held on the grounds of and partially funded by a state university, constituted an illegal in kind campaign donation because it excluded Michael Badnarik, the Libertarian candidate. (Only Bush, Kerry, and Badnarik had ballot access in Arizona.) In the complaint the Arizona Libertarian Party alleged that ASU was &quot;making a donation to two individual campaigns [Bush and Kerry] through the Commission on Presidential Debates as a conduit, in violation of the Arizona Constitution&#x27;s prohibition on making gifts or donations to individuals or corporations.&quot;

Superior Court Judge F. Pendleton Gaines III issued an order to show cause for the president of ASU and for the director of the CPD to appear in court for a hearing on October 12, a day before the scheduled debate. Gaines denied a restraining order on the grounds of laches and that there was a sufficient public purpose for the debate, but also ruled that the AZLP could continue to pursue damages for any violations to their constitutional rights.

The Arizona debate nonetheless proceeded on October 13.

On October 8, at the second debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Badnarik and another third-party nominee, Green candidate David Cobb, were arrested in a civil disobedience action after crossing a police line outside the debate venue to protest their exclusion from the debate. Badnarik said he was attempting to serve the order to show cause; both candidates were released after being ticketed for trespassing and refusing a reasonable order from a policeman.

==Presidential debates memorandum of understanding==
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Bush 2004 campaign and the Kerry 2004 campaign, covering in minute detail all aspects of the presidential candidate debates held between the two candidates was created. It was 32 pages long and dated September 20, 2004.

The Citizens&#x27; Debate Commission (CDC) and others were instrumental in getting the campaigns to publish the MOU in advance of the debates. One of the commissioners of the CDC, George Farah, has written about the earlier debate MOUs in the 2004 tome &quot;No Debate: How the Republican and Democratic Parties Secretly Control the Presidential Debates&quot;.

== Debate schedule ==

Originally, the CPD specified that the first debate would be focused on domestic policy and the third focused on foreign policy. Those terms were changed in an announcement by the CPD on September 24, after it had reviewed the terms of the MOU. The CPD agreed that foreign affairs and homeland security would be the primary topic for the first debate and domestic and economic policy will be the &quot;primary&quot; topic of the third debate. More broadly, it also agreed to make a &quot;good faith effort&quot; to accommodate the rest of the terms of the MOU.

The September 24 announcement, which was released in the format of a copy of a letter sent to the two campaigns, also noted CPD&#x27;s pleasure at the willingness of the two campaigns to participate in the second, &quot;town meeting&quot;-style debate, yet was ambiguous about just what had been agreed to.

Originally, the CPD had announced that questions for the second debate would come from undecided voters selected by the Gallup Organization from the standard metropolitan statistical area surrounding the host city. This had been the policy followed for the 1992, 1996, and 2000 debates. But the September 24 letter to the two candidates did not comment on this; instead, it noted that campaign representatives can discuss participant selection methodology with Dr. Frank Newport of Gallup in order to resolve any open issues. One such issue was that the MOU specified that half the questions be asked by &quot;soft Kerry supporters&quot; and half by &quot;soft Bush supporters,&quot; though what is meant by those terms was not made clear.

==Format==
For 2004, each debate lasted ninety minutes, included a live audience, had no opening statements, could have included follow-up questions from the moderator and ended with closing statements of two minutes.

== September 30: First presidential debate (University of Miami) ==

The first presidential debate between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry, took place on Thursday, September 30, 2004, in the Convocation Center of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.

The debate was moderated by Jim Lehrer of PBS&#x27; &quot;The NewsHour&quot; posed nine questions for each candidate.

===Post-debate poll===
62.5 million people tuned into the debates, an increase of just over 35 percent from 2000.

===Controversies===
====Bush&#x27;s suit bulge====
A bulge in the back of Bush&#x27;s suit jacket during this debate triggered rumors that he was &quot;wired&quot; with a radio receiver, presumably to receive instructions from his strategists. Contributing to the rumors was the perception that, at one point, Bush stated &quot;Let me finish&quot; in response to no apparent interruption and when he still had time on the clock, and some long pauses by Bush before he began answering a question. Others dismissed these accusations, saying that the &quot;Let me finish&quot; was a response to a gesture that Lehrer made, and the pauses were a result of Bush gathering his thoughts before responding.

White House officials initially claimed that the bulge was a &quot;wrinkle in the fabric,&quot; and that Bush was not wearing a bullet-proof vest, as many conjectured. Bush&#x27;s tailor later said that the bulge was nothing more than a pucker along the jacket&#x27;s back seam, according to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;. After the election, unidentified sources in the Secret Service told &quot;The Hill&quot; that Bush was wearing a bullet-proof vest and that campaign handlers had not admitted it earlier for security reasons.

In 2020, NBC News referred to the 2004 microphone earpiece allegations as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and likened the allegations to unfounded right-wing claims that Hillary Clinton wore a microphone in a 2016 debate, or that Joe Biden wore an earpiece in a 2020 debate.

====&quot;You forgot Poland&quot;====

During the debate John Kerry accused Bush of having failed to gain international support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying &quot;... when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States. That&#x27;s not a grand coalition. We can do better.&quot; Bush, who had used Poland earlier in the debate as an example of the international presence in Iraq, replied by saying &quot;Well, actually, he forgot Poland. And now there&#x27;s 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops.&quot; Paraphrased as &quot;You forgot Poland&quot;, the term became a popular catchphrase among Bush detractors, who saw it as a humorously petty rebuttal of Kerry&#x27;s original point.

== October 5: Vice presidential debate (Case Western Reserve University) ==
===Venue===
The only vice presidential debate between Vice President Dick Cheney and Senator John Edwards took place on Tuesday, October 5, 2004, at the Veale Center at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. The debate attracted a large audience; 43.6 million people tuned in, nearly as many as had watched the presidential debates in 2000.

The debate was moderated by Gwen Ifill of the PBS, who posed a total of 20 questions to the candidates.

===Notable exchanges===
Though the debate largely focused on the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the economy and gay marriage, media coverage focused on a few key exchanges between the two candidates. Cheney told Edwards, referring to his absenteeism, that &quot;the first time I met you was tonight.&quot; And Edwards pointedly referred to Cheney&#x27;s lesbian daughter Mary, asking whether Cheney was &quot;...willing to talk about the fact that [Cheney and his wife Lynne] have a gay daughter?&quot;

===Post-debate poll===
CBS News interviewed a nationally representative sample of 178 uncommitted debate-watchers. The sample was of voters who are either undecided about whom to vote for or who have a weak preference that could be changed. Of the group 41 percent said Edwards won the debate, 28 said Cheney won, and 31 percent thought it was a tie. Both uncommitted men and uncommitted women preferred Edwards. A separate poll of 1000 likely voters found that 43 percent believed Cheney won while 37 percent felt Edwards did better. Moreover, after the debate 47 percent said that Cheney was &quot;very qualified&quot; to assume the responsibilities of president (a seven percent rise), while only 25 percent said the same of Edwards (no change).

==October 8: Second presidential debate (Washington University in St. Louis)==
=== Venue ===
The second presidential debate between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry took place on Friday, October 8, 2004, at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. 

The town hall style debate was moderated by Charles Gibson of ABC, which consisted of prospective voters reading questions preselected by Gibson to the candidates.

=== Analysis ===
Bush attempted to deflect criticism of what was described as his scowling demeanor during the first debate, joking at one point about one of Kerry&#x27;s remarks, &quot;That answer almost made me want to scowl&quot;.

When asked about possible appointments to the Supreme Court, Bush replied he would not pick the type of judge who would support the Dred Scott decision. Because that case dealt with slavery, abolished in the United States almost 150 years earlier, commentators such as Timothy Noah thought Bush&#x27;s comment was aimed at anti-abortion voters who see &quot;Dred Scott&quot; as code for &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Noah believed Bush was saying he would appoint Justices who opposed legal abortion.

==October 13: Third presidential debate (Arizona State University)==
===Venue===
The third and final presidential debate between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry took place on Wednesday, October 13, 2004, in the Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona.

The debate was moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS, who posed 20 total questions to the candidates.

==Third-party candidate debates==
*January 29 — Former Green Party presidential nomination candidate and independent vice-presidential candidate Peter Camejo debated Normon Solomon at the Crest Theatre in downtown Sacramento, regarding what direction the Green Party should take in 2004. Camejo supported Ralph Nader, even as an independent candidate, and hoped that Nader could be persuaded to run with the Green Party. Solomon said that Nader should not run, and that the Greens should work to defeat George W. Bush. The debate was a benefit for listener-sponsored KVMR.
*August 31 — Michael Badnarik (Libertarian) and David Cobb (Green) debated in New York City. George W. Bush (Republican), John Kerry (Democrat), and Ralph Nader (independent) were invited to debate, but none of them accepted. The debate was moderated by Rob Richie, executive director of the Center for Voting and Democracy, and Walter Kane, a reporter for Channel 12 News. C-SPAN televised the debate on September 6.
*September 30 — Michael Badnarik (Libertarian) and David Cobb (Green) debated at 5 p.m. in Miami, across the street from the Bush-Kerry debate, which began at 9 p.m. Unlike Bush and Kerry, Badnarik and Cobb took unscripted questions from the audience and from correspondents. The event was carried live by Pacifica Radio, and broadcast later by PBS Television.
*October 6 — Michael Badnarik (Libertarian), Walt Brown (Socialist), David Cobb (Green), and Michael Peroutka (Constitution) debated at 8 p.m. at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. The format of this event was similar to that of the September 30 debate: opening statements, questions from the audience, and closing statements. However, the debate was slightly shorter than the prior two third-party debates, at about 80 minutes total. Time was split between four candidates rather than two, and most of the questions came from Cornell undergraduate and graduate students.
*October 7 — Vice-Presidential debate conducted by &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; featuring Pat LaMarche (Green), Peter Camejo (Independent Ralph Nader&#x27;s running mate), and Richard Campagna (Libertarian).
*October 7 — Michael Badnarik (Libertarian) and David Cobb (Green) at the University of Texas at Austin at 11:30 a.m.
*October 15 — Walt Brown (Socialist), David Cobb (Green), Charles Jay (Personal Choice Party), Gary Nolan (radio host) standing in for Michael Badnarik (Libertarian), former presidential candidate Deirdre Griswold standing in for John Parker (Workers World Party), former presidential candidate Jerry White standing in for Bill Van Auken (Socialist Equality Party) at East Tennessee State University. The debate was released on DVD.

<text>In statics and structural mechanics, a structure is statically indeterminate when the equilibrium equations force and moment equilibrium conditions are insufficient for determining the internal forces and reactions on that structure.

== Mathematics ==
Based on Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, the equilibrium equations available for a two-dimensional body are:

:formula_1 the vectorial sum of the forces acting on the body equals zero. This translates to:
::formula_2 the sum of the horizontal components of the forces equals zero;
::formula_3 the sum of the vertical components of forces equals zero;
:formula_4 the sum of the moments (about an arbitrary point) of all forces equals zero.
In the beam construction on the right, the four unknown reactions are , , , and . The equilibrium equations are:

: formula_5

Since there are four unknown forces (or variables) (, , , and ) but only three equilibrium equations, this system of simultaneous equations does not have a unique solution. The structure is therefore classified as &quot;statically indeterminate&quot;. 

To solve statically indeterminate systems (determine the various moment and force reactions within it), one considers the material properties and compatibility in deformations.

==Statically determinate==
If the support at is removed, the reaction cannot occur, and the system becomes statically determinate (or isostatic). Note that the system is &quot;completely constrained&quot; here.
The system becomes an exact constraint kinematic coupling.
The solution to the problem is:

:formula_6

If, in addition, the support at is changed to a roller support, the number of reactions are reduced to three (without ), but the beam can now be moved horizontally; the system becomes &quot;unstable&quot; or &quot;partly constrained&quot;—a mechanism rather than a structure. In order to distinguish between this and the situation when a system under equilibrium is perturbed and becomes unstable, it is preferable to use the phrase &quot;partly constrained&quot; here. In this case, the two unknowns and can be determined by resolving the vertical force equation and the moment equation simultaneously. The solution yields the same results as previously obtained. However, it is not possible to satisfy the horizontal force equation unless .

== Statical determinacy ==
Descriptively, a statically determinate structure can be defined as a structure where, if it is possible to find internal actions in equilibrium with external loads, those internal actions are unique. The structure has no possible states of self-stress, i.e. internal forces in equilibrium with zero external loads are not possible. Statical indeterminacy, however, is the existence of a non-trivial (non-zero) solution to the homogeneous system of equilibrium equations. It indicates the possibility of self-stress (stress in the absence of an external load) that may be induced by mechanical or thermal action.

Mathematically, this requires a stiffness matrix to have full rank.

A statically indeterminate structure can only be analyzed by including further information like material properties and deflections. Numerically, this can be achieved by using matrix structural analyses, finite element method (FEM) or the moment distribution method (Hardy Cross) .

Practically, a structure is called &#x27;statically overdetermined&#x27; when it comprises more mechanical constraints like walls, columns or bolts than absolutely necessary for stability.

<text>Qazi Habibul Bashar (; born 17 August 1972) is a retired Bangladeshi cricketer and the former captain of the Bangladesh cricket team. Under the managership of Dav Whatmore, he has been found to be the most successful captain to lead the Bangladesh team to overcome several milestones. The first test victory of Bangladesh came under his hands in 2005 against Zimbabwe. Under Habibul Bashar&#x27;s captaincy, Bangladesh have beaten Australia, India, South Africa and Sri Lanka in limited overs matches. Habibul Bashar is currently one of the chief selectors of BCB, along with Abdur Razzak and Minhajul Abedin.

==Early career==
In 1989, Habibul Bashar played for the Bangladesh Under-19 team in the U-19 Asia Cup. Through the 1990s he played his domestic cricket for Biman Bangladesh Airlines. His ODI debut came at the 1995 Asia Cup against Sri Lanka. He missed the 1997 ICC Trophy, in which Bangladesh were the champions but did play in the Asia Cup of that year. He was also left out of the 1999 World Cup squad. After the World Cup he again entered the team and with Eddie Barlow&#x27;s inspiration he got the chance to play more.

Keeping up with the traditional inconsistency with announcing the side, Habibul Bashar was again out of the team for Bangladesh&#x27;s inaugural test. His consistent performance before the test drew the attention of the press and after heavy criticism from them he was finally included in the side. Habibul Bashar made the first fifty in the history of Bangladesh Test cricket to prove his ability.

==Career story==
Habibul Bashar was one of Bangladesh&#x27;s leading batsmen. He was the captain of Bangladesh from January 2004 to June 2007, during this time he led the team to some notable successes. When Zimbabwe toured Bangladesh in January 2005, Bangladesh recorded their first Test match win, their first Test series win, and their first One Day International series win. In June 2005, Bangladesh beat the world champions Australia in a One Day International in Cardiff. In April 2006, they came close to beating Australia in a Test match, taking a first-innings lead of 158, eventually losing by three wickets. Bangladesh lost the ODI series with Zimbabwe in August 2006 by 3–2, but beat them in the last qualifying match of the Champions Trophy. Thanks to these efforts, Bangladesh are currently above Zimbabwe in the LG ICC ODI rankings, and showing that they are improving by the match.

Habibul Bashar had a disappointing 2007 World Cup as a batsman, with an average of only 13.12 and a highest score of 32. In spite of this, Bangladesh performed relatively well. Following a 1–0 test series defeat to India, Habibul Bashar resigned as ODI captain but wanted to remain part of the ODI team. However, despite stating that he wanted to continue to be test captain, Habibul Bashar was removed from this position on 2 June 2007 and replaced by Mohammad Ashraful who also took over as ODI captain.
On 14 September, he announced his retirement from international cricket. Then he became the captain of the Dhaka Warriors side in ICL.At the end of 2009 he retired from ICL and came back at the mainstream of Bangladesh cricket. He has retired from all forms of professional cricket after playing the 2009/10 season. Currently he is playing in the local weekend cricket tournament for The Josephite Warriors. Bashar was also a national Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF in Bangladesh. On 20 January 2022, Habibul Bashar joined Asia Lions along with Mohammad Rafique in Legends League Cricket.

<doc id="899161" wikidata="Q3348287" url="?curid=899161" title="Javed Omar">
<text>Mohammad Javed Omar Belim (born 25 November 1976), known in the early days of his career by the nickname Gullu is a former Bangladeshi cricketer who has played Tests and ODI cricket since 1995, and a former captain in both formats. He retired from the game after a friendly domestic match on January 3, 2014.

==Career==
On his Test debut in April 2001, he carried his bat for 85 not out becoming only the third player in history to achieve this on debut. He is the second person in the history to carry the bat through entire innings in both forms of cricket. Moreover, he is one of the twenty two cricketers in the history of 137 years of test cricket who scored half centuries in both innings of a test as a debutant. The opener has gained a reputation for being able to occupy the crease as his Test strike rate of 36 shows. On 28 August 2003, Jawed scored his maiden Test century against Pakistan.

During the second Test between Bangladesh and India in May 2007 he achieved the very rare feat of grabbing a king pair as he got out to the bowling of Zaheer Khan in the first ball of both innings of the Test Match.

==Early years==
Still in his early teens, Jawed toured England during the summer of 1989 with the Bangladesh U-19 side.
Later that year, he played in the Asian U-19 cup in Afghanistan and scored 55 in the match against Pakistan.

The transformation from the youth team to the national side, however, took a bit of time, and it was not until the 1994–95 season that he got his chance in the national colours. This delay was partly because during the period 90–94 Bangladesh was mainly involved with One-Day Cricket while Jawed&#x27;s batting technique is always more suitable for the longer version. Jawed was part of the team that won the ICC Trophy in 1997. However, he spent most of the tournament as a reserve player, as the coach Gordon Greenidge decided to push hard hitting middle-order bat Naimur Rahman to the opening position.

<text>Faisal Hossain (born 26 October 1978) is a Bangladeshi former cricketer. He played international cricket for Bangladesh in 2004, one Test match and four One Day Internationals without establishing himself in the side. After poor performances at international level, Hossain drifted out of the international squad. He represented Chittagong Division in Bangladesh&#x27;s domestic competition. Although primarily a batsman, Hossain was a part-time left arm spin bowler. He is currently active as a cricket coach.

==Career==
Hossain made his One Day International (ODI) debut against the West Indies on 18 May 2004, scoring 17 runs at number five. He played three more ODIs, the last on 29 July 2004 against Pakistan where he scored 17 which remained his highest score.

He made his Test debut on 28 May 2004 against West Indies, batting at number six where scored 5 and 2.

Although he was drafted in as cover for the injured captain, Habibul Bashar, in the ICC Champions Trophy in August 2004, Hossain did not play another international match.

Hossain&#x27;s bowling action came under scrutiny in 2007 and was under suspicion of throwing. He was allowed to bowl in competitive cricket under supervision, but faced a life ban after his action was reported again. He has not bowled since the 2007/08 season. 
In the 2008 English cricket season, Hossain represented Chislehurst and West Kent Cricket Club in the Kent Cricket League in England.

In December 2008, Hossain was recalled to the Bangladesh squad to face Sri Lanka at home four years after playing his last Test. At the time of his selection, Hossain was a prolific run-scorer in Bangladesh&#x27;s 2008/09 first-class competition. He scored 983 runs at an average of 70.56. Playing for the Chittagong Division, he scored bulk of runs for his side which also contains experienced national team players like Aftab Ahmed, Nafees Iqbal, Tamim Iqbal, Talha Jubair and Nazimuddin. After another successful season in 2009–10 where he was the 2nd highest run scorer in the domestic league in four-day matches, he got into the one-day side again for Bangladesh&#x27;s tour to England. He went on to play 2 one-day matches and scored his highest score (26*) in ODI cricket. He was involved in an incident when he was bowling in the 1st ODI. A crafty left-arm spinner, he was bowling to Ian Bell and beat him with his flight. Wicketkeeper and then vice-captain of Bangladesh Mushfiqur Rahim also missed the flight of the ball and the ball went through his helmet grills and stuck him in the nose. Rahim missed the remainder of the series due to the injury. However, he was dropped for the 2nd one-day which Bangladesh won, beating England by 5 runs. Bangladesh went on to lose the series 2–1.
His next assignment was against Ireland where he came to bat at No.8 and scored an unbeaten 8*. Bangladesh, down 1–0 against Ireland, came back well and drew the series 1–1. After the England tour, Hossain was dropped from the Bangladesh setup. He went back to domestic cricket and kept on scoring runs. In the 2010–11, he was one of the most consistent performers in the league and earned a place in the Bangladesh A side which will tour South Africa in January 2012.

<text>Mohammad Ashraful (; born 7 July 1984) is a Bangladeshi cricketer, who has represented the Bangladesh men&#x27;s national team.

Between 2007 and 2009, Ashraful captained his country in 13 Tests, and 38 One Day Internationals (ODIs), out of which Bangladesh won eight. Ashraful has scored the fastest fifty in Test and ODI for any Bangladeshi cricketer.

Ashraful also played domestic cricket for the Dhaka Division cricket team in Bangladesh&#x27;s domestic one-day and first-class competitions, captaining both sides on occasion.

In 2014 the Bangladesh Cricket Board banned him for eight years after he was found guilty of match fixing. The ban was later reduced to 5 years with 2 years suspended. At the end of the suspension, Ashraful returned to playing domestic cricket.

==Domestic and T20 franchise cricket career==

=== Debut Season 2000-01 ===
Ashraful made his debut on 22 November 2000, playing for the Dhaka Metropolis cricket team. He opened the batting, scoring 41 and 6; Ashraful also claimed five wickets for 59 runs in the first innings with his leg-spin bowling. Three days later Ashraful made his list A debut, again playing for Dhaka Metropolis. Opening the batting, he scored 22 and took two wickets as his team won the match. Ashraful scored his maiden first-class century in his second match, making 101 against the Khulna cricket team. The seven wickets Ashraful took for 99 runs in a match against Chittagong Division in January 2001 remain his best bowling figures. Over the course of the 2000–01 season, he played ten first-class matches – scoring 585 runs at an average of 30.78, including two centuries, and taking 39 wickets at an average of 25.48, including three five-wicket hauls. He also played nine list A matches, scoring 85 runs and taking four wickets.

In November 2006, he set a league record score of 263, against Chittagong Division for Bangladeshi first-class cricket – although this record has since been broken by Raqibul Hasan.

Sonargaon Cricketers, a team in the Dhaka Premier League for the 2005–06 season, signed Ashraful and Mohammad Rafique. The team lost four of its first five games and sought a change of leadership in an attempt to improve its results. He later played for Rainhill CC in a local cricket league in England.

=== 2008-09 Season ===
On 6 February 2009, Ashraful took part in the player auction for the 2009 Indian Premier League. The Mumbai Indians bought him for his base price of US$75,000, but he only played one game and scored just 2 runs.

=== 2011-12 Season ===
He returned to domestic cricket in 2011, scoring a century for Dhaka Division in the opening match of the National Cricket League. Dhaka won the one-day competition, and Ashraful, who was the second-highest run-getter with 331 runs, also claimed 7 wickets in 7 matches, and was named player of the tournament.

For the 2011–12 season, the National Cricket League of Bangladesh was expanded from six first-class teams to eight. Dhaka Metropolis and Rangpur Division were the new teams, with Ashraful captaining the former. Although he scored his first first-class century in over a year during the competition, Ashraful was dropped from the ODI squad to face Pakistan in December.

During a match in the Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League in January 2012, Ashraful was involved in an incident with Tamim Iqbal. This led to the latter being banned for one match and fined.

=== 2017-18 Season ===
He was the leading run-scorer for Kala Bagan Krira Chakra in the 2017–18 Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League, with 665 runs in 13 matches.
He was scheduled to play for Minister Group Rajshahi in Bangabandhu T20 cup.

===Bangladesh Premier League===

====Dhaka Gladiators====
The Bangladesh Cricket Board founded the six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament that was to be held in February of that year. The BCB made Ashraful the &#x27;icon player&#x27; for the Dhaka Gladiators. Dhaka won the tournament, and in twelve matches Ashraful scored a total of 258 runs, with an average of 28.66, making him the BPL&#x27;s second highest run-scorer amongst Bangladeshi batsmen.

During the 2013 Bangladesh Premier League, Ashraful scored 358 runs in 14 matches, with an average of 29.83 per match. He also scored a century (103* off 58) against the Khulna Royal Bengals.

==International career==

===Debut===
Ashraful made his ODI debut against Zimbabwe on 11 April 2001, where he scored only 9 runs and Bangladesh lost the match by 36 runs. He took his first international wicket in the match, that of Andy Flower.

Ashraful made his Test debut on 6 September 2001 against Sri Lanka. He scored highest in each inning, and although Bangladesh slumped to an innings defeat, Ashraful scored 114, becoming the youngest player to score a Test century, breaking Mushtaq Mohammad&#x27;s record. As a result, he was named man of the match. He was the second Bangladeshi player to score a Test century on debut after Aminul Islam Bulbul in 2000 during Bangladesh&#x27;s first Test match. Trevor Chappell, a former coach of Bangladesh&#x27;s national side, commented that: &quot;his determination, commitment and attention to detail would put a mature and an established person to shame. The manner he concentrates on his batting made me believe that the lad is destined to have a long cricketing journey.&quot; Following Ashraful&#x27;s debut century, however, a prolonged string of poor performances resulted in him being dropped from the national team.

===2003 - 2005. Patchy form===
Ashraful performed poorly in his first World Cup, the 2003 Cricket World Cup, scoring 71 runs at an average of 14.20, with Bangladesh being eliminated during the group stage.

In February and March 2004, Bangladesh toured Zimbabwe. At the time, Zimbabwe was without many of their senior players, but the home team still won the Test series 1–0 and the ODI series 2–1. The solitary ODI victory was Bangladesh&#x27;s first international win since defeating Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup; Ashraful scored 51 runs from 32 balls in the match and was named man of the match. Ashraful played with his team against India in December 2004 and scored his second century, 158 not out, claiming the record for the highest individual Test score by a Bangladeshi. India&#x27;s team captain, Sourav Ganguly, described the innings as one of the best Test innings he had seen.

In May and June 2005, Bangladesh toured England for a two-Test series against the hosts and a triangular ODI tournament with England and Australia. Although they won just one ODI out of six, their solitary victory against Australia was described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;the biggest upset in one-day international history&quot;. Ashraful scored 100, which rendered his team victorious, and was named Man of the Match. He scored two more half-centuries in the series, finishing with 259 runs at an average of 43.16, making him third-highest run scorer in the series.

===2006 - 2007. Patchy form continues===
In 2006 he scored his third century, with 136 runs during the first test against Sri Lanka. Ashraful was selected for the Asian squad in the inaugural Afro-Asia Cup. With bowler Mashrafe Mortaza, he was one of two Bangladeshi players in the 15-man squad. Ashraful played in two of the matches, but failed to score a run.

The opening match of the two-Test series against Sri Lanka in February and March 2006 was played at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium, the first international match hosted at that stadium. He scored 136 runs in the first innings, his third Test century; he received the man of the match award, although Sri Lanka won by eight wickets. Bangladesh lost the second Test by ten wickets, with Ashraful managing 37 runs in the match and claiming the wicket of Mahela Jayawardene. Sri Lanka eventually won the series 2–0.

The West Indies hosted the 2007 Cricket World Cup in March and April; Ashraful was included in the 15-man squad led by Habibul Bashar. Bangladesh made it to the second stage of the competition and finished seventh place. Along the way, the team tried to knock India out of the tournament. Ashraful scored 87 runs from 83 balls against South Africa in the course of Bangladesh&#x27;s 67-run victory. His innings was the highest score by a Bangladeshi player in the World Cup and he was named man of the match for his performance. With 216 runs from 9 matches at an average of 36, Ashraful was Bangladesh&#x27;s highest run-scorer in the tournament.

===Captaincy (2007–2009)===

Shortly after the World Cup, India toured Bangladesh for two Test matches and three ODIs. During the second Test, which Bangladesh lost by multiple innings and 239 runs, Ashraful scored the fastest half-century in Test cricket history in terms of time (taking 27 minutes), which was also the second-fastest in terms of balls faced (scored off 26 balls). Aside from the 67 innings he scored in one of the fastest half-centuries in Test cricket history, Ashraful managed only five more runs in the series; in two ODIs, he scored 41 runs. After defeats in both series, Habibul Bashar stepped down as Bangladesh&#x27;s captain; Mohammad Ashraful was appointed the team captain on 2 June 2007. At the time, he had played 35 Tests and 101 ODIs and had some experience with captaincy at the domestic level. Aged 22, he was the second-youngest international captain at the time.

Ashraful and Mortaza took on these roles from the start of the Sri Lanka tour in June 2007. Coach Dav Whatmore had declined to extend his contract and Shaun Williams took over as coach on a temporary basis. Bangladesh lost all three Tests in terms of innings. In the second Test, they registered their lowest score in innings (62). Ashraful scored the most runs (218) for Bangladesh at an average of 43. In the second Test, Ashraful and wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim scored 191 combined for the sixth wicket, and Ashraful scored 129 &quot;not out&quot;. Bangladesh also lost the three-match ODI series that followed 3–0. In September 2007, South Africa hosted the ICC World Twenty20. Victory against the West Indies in the first round was enough to ensure Bangladesh&#x27;s progression to the second round, although they failed to win any of the other matches. In the match against the West Indies, Ashraful scored a record-breaking half-century, with 20  ball deliveries. At the time, it was the fastest T20I half-century in terms of balls faced. He held the record for six days before it was broken by Yuvraj Singh in a match against England.

During the first Test match of South Africa&#x27;s 2007–08 tour, Ashraful dismissed AB de Villiers in an unusual fashion: after the ball left his hand it bounced twice, at which point de Villiers attempted to hit the ball but instead sent it straight up. Ashraful caught the ball and, despite de Villiers standing his ground, umpire Steve Bucknor confirmed the dismissal. The dismissal was legal per Section 6 of Law 24 of the Laws of Cricket, which states the ball must bounce &quot;more&quot; than twice or roll along the ground to be deemed a no-ball.

After an extended run of poor form and Bangladesh&#x27;s first-round exit in the 2009 World Twenty20, Ashraful was dismissed as captain in June 2009. He was replaced by Mashrafe Mortaza for the tour of the West Indies, with Shakib Al Hasan as vice-captain. It was hoped that Ashraful could improve his performance in the international game following his dismissal as captain.

Ashraful later captained Bangladesh&#x27;s team again at the 2010 Asian Games in late November. They played Afghanistan in the final; Bangladesh won by five wickets, securing the country&#x27;s first gold medal at the Asian Games.

===Post-captaincy (2009–present)===

Ashraful was dropped when England toured Bangladesh in February and March 2010. He was recalled for Bangladesh&#x27;s tour of England two months later. He struggled in June&#x27;s 2010 Asia Cup, and was subsequently dropped; he was recalled for the ODI leg of the England tour due to injuries to the squad. After a poor run of form, Ashraful was dropped from the ODI series against New Zealand in October 2010. Though he was out of the squad, the following month when the BCB announced its central contracts for the coming year Ashraful was one of six players given the highest level of contract (A+).

The West Indies toured Bangladesh in October, but after scoring just two runs, Ashraful was dropped from the Test squad.

Shortly after winning the Asian Games in 2010, Ashraful was recalled to Bangladesh&#x27;s full squad for the five-match ODI series against Zimbabwe in December. Though they lost the first match, Bangladesh went on to win the next three, with one called off due to rain, and defeated Zimbabwe 3–1. Ashraful played one match, scoring six runs.

He was included in Bangladesh&#x27;s 15-man squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup, co-hosted by Bangladesh along with India and Sri Lanka. In three matches, Ashraful scored only 18 runs and was dropped from the squad for the three-match ODI series against Australia that followed.

===In and out of the team===
In April he captained Bangladesh A on a tour of South Africa and his performance, including striking a one-day century, earned him a recall to the senior squad to face Zimbabwe in August. In the one-off Test, Ashraful scored the most runs for his team with a total of 112, including a half-century, even though Bangladesh was defeated. Bangladesh lost the following ODI series against Zimbabwe 3–2. Bangladesh&#x27;s batsmen struggled early in the series, and Ashraful scored 23 runs during three matches.

He was retained for the Test side for the Pakistan series in 2012, but was dropped after the first Test, in which he scored only one run. When the BCB announced its central contracts for 2012, Ashraful&#x27;s A+ contract was not renewed.
In October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Chittagong Vikings team, following the draft for the 2018–19 Bangladesh Premier League.

==Controversies==
In March 2008, Ashraful slapped a fan who called him &quot;rubbish&quot; while he was training at an indoor stadium in Dhaka. This took place at a time when Ashraful was being heavily criticised in the media for his poor performance and questionable tactics on the field as captain. The BCB fined him 25% of his salary for the month of March 2008 for violating the Code of Conduct. He later apologised for the incident.

===Spot-fixing controversy===
Mohammad Ashraful admitted to spot-fixing during the 2013 Bangladesh Premier League. The Bangladesh Cricket Board suspended him from the game temporarily until the ICC&#x27;s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit submitted its report on its investigations into the fixing. The alleged fixing involved a match between the Dhaka Gladiators and the Chittagong Vikings during the second edition of the BPL on 2 February 2013. The then-28-year-old Ashraful was allegedly paid about $12,800 to lose the match, but the cheque he was given later bounced, according to the local media. He was also allegedly involved in fixing another match 10 days later, against the Barisal Burners, which his team lost by seven wickets. In June 2014, the Bangladesh Cricket Board found him responsible and banned him for eight years, which was later reduced to five years (with two years suspended).

In August 2016, Ashraful&#x27;s ban was partially lifted, allowing him to play in domestic cricket in Bangladesh. He became eligible to play in international fixtures in 2018. In 2022, Ashraful played for Lullington Park Cricket Club in the Derbyshire County Cricket League.

<doc id="899167" wikidata="Q1898464" url="?curid=899167" title="Naval aviation">
<text>Naval aviation / Aeronaval is the application of military air power by navies, whether from warships that embark aircraft, or land bases.
It often involves &quot;navalised aircraft&quot;, specifically designed for naval use.
Seaborne aviation encompasses similar activities not restricted to navies, including marines and coast guards, such as in U.S. naval aviators.

Naval aviation units are typically projected to a position nearer the target by way of an aircraft carrier. Carrier-based aircraft must be sturdy enough to withstand the demands of carrier operations. They must be able to launch in a short distance and be sturdy and flexible enough to come to a sudden stop on a pitching flight deck; they typically have robust folding mechanisms that allow higher numbers of them to be stored in below-decks hangars and small spaces on flight decks. These aircraft are designed for many purposes, including air-to-air combat, surface attack, submarine attack, search and rescue, matériel transport, weather observation, reconnaissance and wide area command and control duties.

Naval helicopters can be used for many of the same missions as fixed-wing aircraft while operating from aircraft carriers, helicopter carriers, destroyers and frigates.

==History==
===Establishment===

Early experiments on the use of kites for naval reconnaissance took place in 1903 at Woolwich Common for the Admiralty. Samuel Franklin Cody demonstrated the capabilities of his 8-foot-long black kite and it was proposed for use as either a mechanism to hold up wires for wireless communications or as a manned reconnaissance device that would give the viewer the advantage of considerable height.

In 1908 Prime Minister H. H. Asquith approved the formation of an &quot;Aerial Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence&quot; to investigate the potential for naval aviation. In 1909 this body accepted the proposal of Captain Reginald Bacon made to the First Sea Lord Sir John Fisher that rigid airships should be constructed for the Royal Navy to be used for reconnaissance. This resulted in the construction of &quot;Mayfly&quot; in 1909, the first air component of the navy to become operational, and the genesis of modern naval aviation.

The first pilots for the Royal Navy were transferred from the Royal Aero Club in June 1910 along with two aircraft with which to train new pilots, and an airfield at Eastchurch became the Naval Flying School, the first such facility in the world. Two hundred applications were received, and four were accepted: Lieutenant C R Samson, Lieutenant A M Longmore, Lieutenant A Gregory and Captain E L Gerrard, RMLI.

The French also established a naval aviation capability in 1910 with the establishment of the Service Aeronautique and the first flight training schools.

U.S. naval aviation began with pioneer aviator Glenn Curtiss who contracted with the United States Navy to demonstrate that airplanes could take off from and land aboard ships at sea. One of his pilots, Eugene Ely, took off from the cruiser anchored off the Virginia coast in November 1910. Two months later Ely landed aboard another cruiser, , in San Francisco Bay, proving the concept of shipboard operations. However, the platforms erected on those vessels were temporary measures. The U.S. Navy and Glenn Curtiss experienced two firsts during January 1911. On 27 January, Curtiss flew the first seaplane from the water at San Diego Bay and the next day U.S. Navy Lt. Theodore G. Ellyson, a student at the nearby Curtiss School, took off in a Curtiss &quot;grass cutter&quot; plane to become the first naval aviator.

$25,000 was appropriated for the Bureau of Navigation (United States Navy) to purchase three airplanes and in the spring of 1911 four additional officers were trained as pilots by the Wright brothers and Curtiss. A camp with a primitive landing field was established on the Severn River at Greenbury Point, near Annapolis, Maryland. The vision of the aerial fleet was for scouting. Each aircraft would have a pilot and observer. The observer would use the wireless radio technology to report on enemy ships. Some thoughts were given to deliver counterattacks on hostile aircraft using &quot;explosives or other means&quot;. Using airplanes to bomb ships was seen as largely impractical at the time. CAPT Washington Irving Chambers felt it was much easier to defend against airplanes than mines or torpedoes. The wireless radio was cumbersome (greater than 50 pounds), but the technology was improving. Experiments were underway for the first ICS (pilot to observer comms) using headsets, as well as connecting the observer to the radio. The navy tested both telephones and voice tubes for ICS. As of August 1911, Italy was the only other navy known to be adapting hydroplanes for naval use.

The group expanded with the addition of six aviators in 1912 and five in 1913, from both the Navy and Marine Corps, and conducted maneuvers with the Fleet from the battleship , designated as the Navy&#x27;s aviation ship. Meanwhile, Captain Henry C. Mustin successfully tested the concept of the catapult launch in August 1912, and in 1915 made the first catapult launching from a ship underway. The first permanent naval air station was established at Pensacola, Florida, in January 1914 with Mustin as its commanding officer. On April 24 of that year, and for a period of approximately 45 days afterward, five floatplanes and flying boats flown by ten aviators operated from &quot;Mississippi&quot; and the cruiser &quot;Birmingham&quot; off Veracruz and Tampico, Mexico, respectively, conducting reconnaissance for troops ashore in the wake of the Tampico Affair.
In January 1912, the British battleship took part in aircraft experiments at Sheerness. She was fitted for flying off aircraft with a downward-sloping runway which was installed on her foredeck, running over her forward gun turret from her forebridge to her bow and equipped with rails to guide the aircraft. The Gnome-engined Short Improved S.27 &quot;S.38&quot;, pusher seaplane piloted by Lieutenant Charles Samson become the first British aircraft to take-off from a ship while at anchor in the River Medway, on 10 January 1912. &quot;Africa&quot; then transferred her flight equipment to her sister ship .

In May 1912, with Commander Samson again flying the &quot;S.38&quot;, the first ever instance of an aircraft to take off from a ship which was under way occurred. &quot;Hibernia&quot; steamed at at the Royal Fleet Review in Weymouth Bay, England. &quot;Hibernia&quot; then transferred her aviation equipment to battleship . Based on these experiments, the Royal Navy concluded that aircraft were useful aboard ship for spotting and other purposes, but that interference with the firing of guns caused by the runway built over the foredeck and the danger and impracticality of recovering seaplanes that alighted in the water in anything but calm weather more than offset the desirability of having airplanes aboard. In 1912, the nascent naval air detachment in the United Kingdom was amalgamated to form the Royal Flying Corps and in 1913 a seaplane base on the Isle of Grain, an airship base at Kingsnorth and eight new airfields were approved for construction. The first aircraft participation in naval manoeuvres took place in 1913 with the cruiser converted into a seaplane carrier. In 1914, naval aviation was split again, and became the Royal Naval Air Service. However, shipboard naval aviation had begun in the Royal Navy, and would become a major part of fleet operations by 1917.

Other early operators of seaplanes were Germany, within its &quot;Marine-Fliegerabteilung&quot; naval aviation units within the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;, and Russia. In May 1913 Germany established a naval zeppelin detachment in Berlin-Johannisthal and an airplane squadron in Putzig (Puck, Poland). The Japanese established the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, modelled on the RNAS, in 1913. On 24 January 1913 came the first wartime naval aviation interservice cooperation mission. Greek pilots on a seaplane observed and drew a diagram of the positions of the Turkish fleet against which they dropped four bombs. This event was widely commented upon in the press, both Greek and international.

===World War I===

At the outbreak of war the Royal Naval Air Service had 93 aircraft, six airships, two balloons and 727 personnel, making it larger than the Royal Flying Corps. The main roles of the RNAS were fleet reconnaissance, patrolling coasts for enemy ships and submarines, attacking enemy coastal territory and defending Britain from enemy air-raids, along with deployment along the Western Front. In 1914 the first aerial torpedo was dropped in trials performed in a Short &quot;Folder&quot; by Lieutenant (later Air Chief Marshal Sir) Arthur Longmore, and in August 1915, a Short Type 184 piloted by Flight Commander Charles Edmonds from sank a Turkish supply ship in the Sea of Marmara with a , torpedo.

The first strike from a seaplane carrier against a land target as well as a sea target took place in September 1914 when the Imperial Japanese Navy carrier conducted ship-launched air raids from Kiaochow Bay during the Battle of Tsingtao in China. The four Maurice Farman seaplanes bombarded German-held land targets (communication centers and command centers) and damaged a German minelayer in the Tsingtao peninsula from September until 6 November 1914, when the Germans surrendered. One Japanese plane was credited being shot down by the German aviator Gunther Plüschow in an Etrich Taube, using his pistol.

On the Western front the first naval air raid occurred on 25 December 1914 when twelve seaplanes from , and (cross-channel steamers converted into seaplane carriers) attacked the Zeppelin base at Cuxhaven. The raid was not a complete success, owing to sub-optimal weather conditions, including fog and low cloud, but the raid was able to conclusively demonstrate the feasibility of air-to-land strikes from a naval platform. Two German airships were destroyed at the Tøndern base on July 19, 1918, by seven Sopwith Camels launched from the carrier .

In August 1914 Germany operated 20 planes and one Zeppelin, another 15 planes were confiscated. They operated from bases in Germany and Flanders (Belgium). On 19 August 1918 several British torpedo boats were sunk by 10 German planes near Heligoland. These are considered as the first naval units solely destroyed by airplanes. During the war the German &quot;Marineflieger&quot; claimed the destruction of 270 enemy planes, 6 balloons, 2 airships, 1 Russian destroyer, 4 merchant ships, 3 submarines, 4 torpedo boats and 12 vehicles, for the loss of 170 German sea and land planes as well as 9 vehicles. Notable Marineflieger aces were Gotthard Sachsenberg (31 victories), Alexander Zenzes (18 victories), Friedrich Christiansen (13 victories, 1 airship and 1 submarine), Karl Meyer (8 victories), Karl Scharon (8 victories), and Hans Goerth (7 victories).

===Development of the aircraft carrier===

The need for a more mobile strike capacity led to the development of the aircraft carrier - the backbone of modern naval aviation. was the first purpose-built seaplane carrier and was also arguably the first modern aircraft carrier. She was originally laid down as a merchant ship, but was converted on the building stocks to be a hybrid airplane/seaplane carrier with a launch platform and the capacity to hold up to four wheeled aircraft. Launched on 5 September 1914, she served in the Dardanelles campaign and throughout World War I.

During World War I the Royal Navy also used HMS &quot;Furious&quot; to experiment with the use of wheeled aircraft on ships. This ship was reconstructed three times between 1915 and 1925: first, while still under construction, it was modified to receive a flight deck on the fore-deck; in 1917 it was reconstructed with separate flight decks fore and aft of the superstructure; then finally, after the war, it was heavily reconstructed with a three-quarter length main flight deck, and a lower-level take-off only flight deck on the fore-deck.

On 2 August 1917, Squadron Commander E.H. Dunning, Royal Navy, landed his Sopwith Pup aircraft on &quot;Furious&quot; in Scapa Flow, Orkney, becoming the first person &quot;to land&quot; a plane on a moving ship. He was killed five days later during another landing on &quot;Furious&quot;.

 was converted from an ocean liner and became the first example of what is now the standard pattern of aircraft carrier, with a full-length flight deck that allowed wheeled aircraft to take off and land. After commissioning, the ship was heavily involved for several years in the development of the optimum design for other aircraft carriers. &quot;Argus&quot; also evaluated various types of arresting gear, general procedures needed to operate a number of aircraft in concert, and fleet tactics.

The Tondern raid, a British bombing raid against the Imperial German Navy&#x27;s airship base at Tønder, Denmark was the first attack in history made by aircraft flying from a carrier flight deck, with seven Sopwith Camels launched from HMS &quot;Furious&quot;. For the loss of one man, the British destroyed two German zeppelins, L.54 and L.60 and a captive balloon.

===Interwar period===
Genuine aircraft carriers did not emerge beyond Britain until the early 1920s.

The Japanese (1921) was the world&#x27;s first purpose-built aircraft carrier, although the initial plans and laying down for (1924) had begun earlier. Both &quot;Hōshō&quot; and &quot;Hermes&quot; initially boasted the two most distinctive features of a modern aircraft carrier: a full-length flight deck and a starboard-side control tower island. Both continued to be adjusted in the light of further experimentation and experience, however: &quot;Hōshō&quot; even opted to remove its island entirely in favor of a less obstructed flight deck and improved pilot visibility. Instead, Japanese carriers opted to control their flight operations from a platform extending from the side of the flight deck.

In the United States, Admiral William Benson attempted to entirely dissolve the USN&#x27;s Naval Aeronautics program in 1919. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Roosevelt and others succeeded in maintaining it, but the service continued to support battleship-based doctrines. To counter Billy Mitchell&#x27;s campaign to establish a separate Department of Aeronautics, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels ordered a rigged test against in 1920 which reached the conclusion that &quot;the entire experiment pointed to the improbability of a modern battleship being either destroyed or completely put out of action by aerial bombs.&quot; Investigation by the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; that discovered the rigging led to Congressional resolutions compelling more honest studies. The sinking of involved violating the Navy&#x27;s rules of engagement but completely vindicated Mitchell to the public. Some men, such as Captain (soon Rear Admiral) William A. Moffett, saw the publicity stunt as a means to increase funding and support for the Navy&#x27;s aircraft carrier projects. Moffett was sure that he had to move decisively in order to avoid having his fleet air arm fall into the hands of a proposed combined Land/Sea Air Force which took care of &quot;all&quot; the United States&#x27;s airpower needs. (That very fate had befallen the two air services of the United Kingdom in 1918: the Royal Flying Corps had been combined with the Royal Naval Air Service to become the Royal Air Force, a condition which would remain until 1937.) Moffett supervised the development of naval air tactics throughout the &#x27;20s. The first aircraft carrier entered the U.S. fleet with the conversion of the collier USS &quot;Jupiter&quot; and its recommissioning as in 1922.

Many British naval vessels carried float planes, seaplanes or amphibians for reconnaissance and spotting: two to four on battleships or battlecruisers and one on cruisers. The aircraft, a Fairey Seafox or later a Supermarine Walrus, were catapult-launched, and landed on the sea alongside for recovery by crane. Several submarine aircraft carriers were built by Japan, each carrying one floatplane, which did not prove effective in war. The French Navy built one large submarine, , which also carried one floatplane, and was also not effective in war.

===World War II===

World War II saw the emergence of naval aviation as the decisive element in the war at sea. The principal users were Japan, United States (both with Pacific interests to protect) and Britain. Germany, the Soviet Union, France and Italy had a lesser involvement. Soviet Naval Aviation was mostly organised as land-based coastal defense force (apart from some scout floatplanes it consisted almost exclusively of land-based types also used by its air arms).

During the course of the war, seaborne aircraft were used in fleet actions at sea (Midway, ), strikes against naval units in port (Taranto, Pearl Harbor), support of ground forces (Okinawa, Allied invasion of Italy) and anti-submarine warfare (the Battle of the Atlantic). Carrier-based aircraft were specialised as dive bombers, torpedo bombers, and fighters. Surface-based aircraft such as the PBY Catalina helped finding submarines and surface fleets.

In World War II the aircraft carrier replaced the battleship as the most powerful naval offensive weapons system as battles between fleets were increasingly fought out of gun range by aircraft. The Japanese , the heaviest battleship ever built, was first turned back by light escort carrier aircraft and later sunk lacking its own air cover.

During the Doolittle Raid of 1942, 16 Army medium bombers were launched from the carrier &quot;Hornet&quot; on one-way missions to bomb Japan. All were lost to fuel exhaustion after bombing their targets and the experiment was not repeated. Smaller carriers were built in large numbers to escort slow cargo convoys or supplement fast carriers. Aircraft for observation or light raids were also carried by battleships and cruisers, while blimps were used to search for attack submarines.

Experience showed that there was a need for widespread use of aircraft which could not be met quickly enough by building new fleet aircraft carriers. This was particularly true in the North Atlantic, where convoys were highly vulnerable to U-boat attack. The British authorities used unorthodox, temporary, but effective means of giving air protection such as CAM ships and merchant aircraft carriers, merchant ships modified to carry a small number of aircraft. The solution to the problem were large numbers of mass-produced merchant hulls converted into escort aircraft carriers (also known as &quot;jeep carriers&quot;). These basic vessels, unsuited to fleet action by their capacity, speed and vulnerability, nevertheless provided air cover where it was needed.

The Royal Navy had observed the impact of naval aviation and, obliged to prioritise their use of resources, abandoned battleships as the mainstay of the fleet. was therefore the last British battleship and her sisters were cancelled. The United States had already instigated a large construction programme (which was also cut short) but these large ships were mainly used as anti-aircraft batteries or for shore bombardment.

Other actions involving naval aviation included:
* Battle of the Atlantic, aircraft carried by low-cost escort carriers were used for antisubmarine patrol, defense, and attack.
* At the start of the Pacific War in 1941, Japanese carrier-based aircraft sank many US warships during the attack on Pearl Harbor and land-based aircraft sank two large British warships. Engagements between Japanese and American naval fleets were then conducted largely or entirely by aircraft - examples include the battles of Coral Sea, Midway, Bismarck Sea and Philippine Sea.
* Battle of Leyte Gulf, with the first appearance of kamikazes, perhaps the largest naval battle in history. Japan&#x27;s last carriers and pilots are deliberately sacrificed, a battleship is sunk by aircraft.
* Operation Ten-Go demonstrated U.S. air supremacy in the Pacific theater by this stage in the war and the vulnerability of surface ships without air cover to aerial attack.

===Post-war developments===

Jet aircraft were used on aircraft carriers after the War. The first jet landing on a carrier was made by Lt Cdr Eric &#x27;Winkle&#x27; Brown who landed on in the specially modified de Havilland Vampire (registration LZ551/G) on 3 December 1945. Following the introduction of angled flight decks, jets were regularly operating from carriers by the mid-1950s.

An important development of the early 1950s was the British invention of the angled flight deck by Capt D.R.F. Campbell RN in conjunction with Lewis Boddington of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. The runway was canted at an angle of a few degrees from the longitudinal axis of the ship. If an aircraft missed the arrestor cables (referred to as a &quot;bolter&quot;), the pilot only needed to increase engine power to maximum to get airborne again, and would not hit the parked aircraft because the angled deck pointed out over the sea. The angled flight deck was first tested on , by painting angled deck markings onto the centerline flight deck for touch and go landings. The modern steam-powered catapult, powered by steam from a ship&#x27;s boilers or reactors, was invented by Commander C.C. Mitchell of the Royal Naval Reserve. It was widely adopted following trials on between 1950 and 1952 which showed it to be more powerful and reliable than the hydraulic catapults which had been introduced in the 1940s. The first Optical Landing System, the Mirror Landing Aid was invented by Lieutenant Commander H. C. N. Goodhart RN. The first trials of a mirror landing sight were conducted on HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; in 1952.

The US Navy built the first aircraft carrier to be powered by nuclear reactors. was powered by eight nuclear reactors and was the second surface warship (after ) to be powered in this way. The post-war years also saw the development of the helicopter, with a variety of useful roles and mission capability aboard aircraft carriers and other naval ships. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United Kingdom and the United States converted some older carriers into Commando Carriers or Landing Platform Helicopters (LPH); seagoing helicopter airfields like . To mitigate the expensive connotations of the term &quot;aircraft carrier&quot;, the carriers were originally designated as &quot;through deck cruisers&quot; and were initially to operate as helicopter-only craft escort carriers.

The arrival of the Sea Harrier VTOL/STOVL fast jet meant that the Invincible-class could carry fixed-wing aircraft, despite their short flight decks. The British also introduced the ski-jump ramp as an alternative to contemporary catapult systems. As the Royal Navy retired or sold the last of its World War II-era carriers, they were replaced with smaller ships designed to operate helicopters and the V/STOVL Sea Harrier jet. The ski-jump gave the Harriers an enhanced STOVL capability, allowing them to take off with heavier payloads.

In 2013, the US Navy completed the first successful catapult launch and arrested landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aboard an aircraft carrier. After a decade of research and planning, the US Navy has been testing the integration of UAVs with carrier-based forces since 2013, using the experimental Northrop Grumman X-47B, and is working to procure a fleet of carrier-based UAVs, referred to as the Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) system.

==Roles==

Naval aviation forces primarily perform naval roles at sea. However, they are also used for other tasks which vary between states. Common roles for such forces include:
===Fleet air defense===
Carrier-based naval aviation provides a country&#x27;s seagoing forces with air cover over areas that may not be reachable by land-based aircraft, giving them a considerable advantage over navies composed primarily of surface combatants.

===Strategic projection===
Naval aviation also provides countries with the opportunity to deploy military aircraft over land and sea, without the need for air bases on land.

===Mine countermeasures===
Aircraft may be used to conduct naval mine clearance, the aircraft tows a sled through the water but is itself at a significant distance from the water, hopefully putting itself out of harm&#x27;s way. Aircraft include the MH-53E and AW101.

===Anti-surface warfare===
Aircraft operated by navies are also used in the anti-surface warfare (ASUW or ASuW) role, to attack enemy ships and other, surface combatants. This is generally conducted using air-launched anti-ship missiles.

===Amphibious warfare===
Naval aviation is also used as part of amphibious warfare. Aircraft based on naval ships provide support to marines and other forces performing amphibious landings. Ship-based aircraft may also be used to support amphibious forces as they move inland.

===Maritime patrol===
Naval aircraft are used for various maritime patrol missions, such as reconnaissance, search and rescue, and maritime law enforcement.
===Vertical replenishment===
Vertical replenishment (VERTREP) is a method of supplying naval vessels at sea, by helicopter. This means moving cargo and supplies from supply ships to the flight decks of other naval vessels using naval helicopters.

===Anti-submarine warfare===
During the Cold War, the navies of NATO faced a significant threat from Soviet submarine forces, specifically Soviet Navy SSN and SSGN assets. This resulted in the development and deployment of light aircraft carriers with major anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities by European NATO navies. One of the most effective weapons against submarines is the ASW helicopter, several of which could be based on these light ships. These carriers are typically around 20,000 tons displacement and carry a mix of ASW helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. Land-based maritime patrol aircraft are also useful in this role, since they can operate independently of aircraft carriers.

===Disaster relief===
Naval aircraft are used to airlift supplies, insert specialized personnel (e.g. medical staff, relief workers), and evacuate persons in distress in the aftermath of natural disasters. Naval aircraft are vital in cases where traditional infrastructure to provide relief are destroyed or overtaxed in the wake of a disaster, such as when a region&#x27;s airport is destroyed or overcrowded and the region cannot be effectively accessed by road or helicopter. The capability of ships to provide clean, fresh water which can be transported by helicopter to affected areas is also valuable. Naval aircraft played an important part in providing relief in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake and Typhoon Haiyan.

<doc id="899168" wikidata="Q3345598" url="?curid=899168" title="Mohammad Rafique (cricketer)">
<text>Mohammed Rafique (, born 5 September 1970) is a Bangladeshi cricket coach and former cricketer. He was the first Bangladeshi bowler to take 100 wickets in both formats, Test matches and ODI matches.

Rafique is known for his contribution to Bangladesh Cricket. He played for the World XI in the Super Series against Australia in 2005 and the Asia XI for the exhibition series against Africa XI in 2007. He was named captain of Bangladesh Legends cricket team in 2020-21 Road Safety World Series. On 20 January 2022, Rafique joined Asia Lions along with Habibul Bashar in Legends League Cricket, where he took 2 wickets against India Maharajas.

==Domestic career==
He started his career as a left arm seamer with the 2nd Division side, Bangladesh Sporting, in 1985. In 1988, he joined Bangladesh Biman cricket team. There, under the influence of the Pakistani allrounder Wasim Haider he converted to slow orthodox spin bowling.

In December 1994, he played for the Bangladesh team in the 2nd SAARC cricket tournament where he took three wickets and conceded twenty five runs, (3/25) in Bangladesh&#x27;s win against India &quot;A&quot;.

He was a member of the Bangladesh team that won the 1997 ICC Trophy. Overall, in 9 matches, he took 19 wickets at an average of 10.68 runs per over. His best 4/25 came in the semi-final against Scotland. With his spinning partner Enamul Haque Moni, he took 12 wickets in the tournament. In the final against Kenya he had scored valuable 26 runs of 15 deliveries.
Rafique was banned with 13 professional players for ten years from all forms of cricket by the Bangladesh Cricket Board following his enrollment in the Indian Cricket League (ICL) in August 2008, but renounced his ties with the ICL a year later and has since been accepted back into the fold. He is still playing first-class cricket for Dhaka Division and recently starred in the Big Boss T20 Premier League with a match-winning performance for Abahani Limited in the final.

==International career==
A slow-left-arm orthodox bowler, Rafique was one of the few Bangladeshi players in the ICC bowler rankings&#x27; top fifty. He became a permanent feature in the national team and was a household name in Bangladesh. He achieved the double honours of taking 100 wickets and scoring 1000 runs in both formats.

The one of the most senior players in the Bangladesh team, Rafique was better known for his abilities in ODIs early in his career. He was nevertheless selected to play in Bangladesh&#x27;s inaugural Test against India, and showed his promise with three wickets.

His career was almost derailed soon afterwards, when he was reported to the ICC for a suspect action. He was tardy in taking remedial action, and was out of the national team until 2002, when he was picked for the home series against South Africa. His return to cricket was promising, with a six-wicket haul in the second Test against South Africa. He was the highest wicket-taker for Bangladesh in the home Test series against India, and the second highest during the away tour of Zimbabwe.

Rafique is also known as a handy, hard-hitting lower-order batsman. His 77 runs versus Kenya in May 1998 at Hyderabad was instrumental in Bangladesh&#x27;s first ever ODI win against Kenya. With the ball, he took three wickets for fifty six runs (3/56), and was adjudged the man of the match. He also scored a Test century against the West Indies in Bangladesh&#x27;s drawn Test. Also he scored 65 runs against Australia in 2005–6, including six sixes.

He was instrumental in steering Bangladesh to a series whitewash against the Kenyans, and recorded his best match figures in Tests against Australia in a match they only narrowly lost. Rafique had a successful 2007 World Cup, taking eight wickets and helping Bangladesh to win games against India and South Africa.

Rafique announced his international retirement on 7 February 2008. Bangladesh&#x27;s home series against South Africa was his last for the national team. He became the first Bangladeshi to ever take the milestone of 100 test wickets by having Robin Peterson caught at first slip by Junaid Siddique on 1 March during the second test. Out of 53 players who have scored 1,000 runs and taken 100 wickets in Test cricket, Rafique was the first to have represented Bangladesh.

<text>Darlene &quot;Dar&quot; Heatherington (born 1963) is a former Canadian politician who was forced to resign her city council seat in Lethbridge, Alberta in 2004 after being convicted of public mischief.

==Reports==

On May 3, 2003, Heatherington first made Canadian and international headlines when she disappeared from a conference in Great Falls, Montana. Three days later, she was found in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleging that she had been abducted and raped. Police found her report to be inconsistent and lacking evidence, and she eventually recanted. She was charged with filing a false report to police but pleaded not guilty. She continues to allege that the incident happened as reported and that the police coerced her into recanting her original statement.

Previously, Heatherington had filed reports with Lethbridge police that she was being stalked. She was receiving sexually explicit letters from her stalker, but her reports often did not match police surveillance evidence. On June 10, 2003, she was charged with public mischief after police concluded that the stalker did not exist and that Heatherington was likely writing the letters herself. On September 8, she pleaded not guilty to those charges as well.

==Charges and sentencing==

On June 29, 2004, Heatherington was found guilty of public mischief. Although required by law to resign her council seat following her conviction, Heatherington initially refused to do so. As a result, Lethbridge city council initiated the process of having her removed through the Alberta Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench. On August 9, 2004, Heatherington announced her resignation effective September 10, indicating that she would be using her time to prove her innocence. Two days later, Lethbridge City Council was able to force Heatherington to resign immediately.

On September 10, Heatherington received a 20-month conditional sentence, consisting of eight months of house arrest followed by 10 months of curfew, and 100 hours of community service and counselling.

==Post-trial==

On February 3, 2005, Heatherington was found guilty of violating the terms of her house arrest sentence, although this conviction did not result in any jail time.

On July 27, Heatherington and her husband filed separately for bankruptcy, both citing Heatherington&#x27;s ongoing legal battle. On August 16, Heatherington dropped her appeal of the mischief charge. Her lawyer stated that Heatherington could no longer afford to proceed, despite earlier claims that the bankruptcy would not affect her appeal.

On November 15, 2005, Heatherington&#x27;s sentence was reduced to one year from twenty months, by order of the Alberta Court of Appeal.

<text>Manjural Islam Rana (4 May 1984 – 16 March 2007), also known as Qazi Manjural Islam, was a Bangladeshi cricketer who played six Tests and 25 One Day Internationals for Bangladesh. Born in Khulna, he was a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler. He played for Khulna Division at domestic level and made his One Day International (ODI) debut in November 2003 against England. Three months later, Rana played his first Test against Zimbabwe. On 16 March 2007, he died of severe head injuries sustained in a road traffic accident at the age of 22.

==Cricket career==

===Early career===
Rana made his first-class debut on 22 November 2000, playing for Khulna Division against Barisal Division. His first wicket was that of Towhid Hossain, bowled, but he did not bat in the match. In his next first-class match, against Dhaka Metropolis for Khulna, Rana batted for the first time; he scored 8 and 18 not out. In the match, 19 other players made their first-class debut as this was the first match for both Khulna and Dhaka in Bangladesh&#x27;s new National Cricket League. Rana made his one-day debut the same month; on 25 November 2000, he played for Khulna against Barisal Division. He scored 22 runs in the match and took three wickets for 20 runs. Once again, Rana was one of 20 people to debut in the match in the new Ispahani Mirzapore Tea One-Day League. In his first season with Khulna, Rana played 10 first-class matches, scoring 299 runs at 24.91 and taking 35 wickets at 20.14. He also played the same number of one-day matches, scoring 70 runs at 11.66 and taking 10 wickets at 26.00.

In the 2001–02 season, Rana played just two first-class and two one-day matches, with little success compared to the previous year. He experienced more success in 2002–03, playing in six first-class and one-day matches respectively. Rana scored 390 runs at 48.75 in the former, including four half-centuries. He took 27 wickets at 20.00 with the ball and in the latter one-day matches, Rana scored 28 runs at 5.60 and took 18 wickets at 9.55. During the 2003 English cricket season, he represented the Old Mid-Whitgiftians in the Surrey Championship. Rana was chosen to be part of the Bangladesh A squad that toured Pakistan in 2003–04.

===International breakthrough===
Between 30 January 2003 and 8 February 2005, Rana played no domestic cricket. Rana made his ODI debut against England in Chittagong on 7 November 2003, in the first match of a three-match ODI series. Filling in for fellow spinner Mohammad Rafique, he dismissed Michael Vaughan with just his third ball of the match and became the first Bangladeshi to take a wicket in his first international over. Rana played in all three matches as Bangladesh lost the series 3–0; the wicket in his first over of international cricket was his only one of the series and he scored 46 runs at an average of 23.00.

In December 2003, Rana was part of the Bangladesh A squad that toured in Pakistan, playing in both the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Patron&#x27;s Cup and the PCB Patron&#x27;s Trophy. Rana made his Test debut on 19 February 2004, playing against Zimbabwe as part of Bangladesh&#x27;s tour of the country. He bowled 20.2 overs in the match, taking two wickets for 66 runs. His first Test wicket was that of Sean Ervine, caught by Tapash Baisya. Rana batted twice in the match, making scores of 35 not out and 32. Bangladesh lost the match by 183 runs and Rana stayed in the team for the second match. He batted once, scoring 39 and bowled just six overs in a match curtailed by the weather. The result of the Test was a draw, ensuring Bangladesh lost the series 1–0 to Zimbabwe. Rana finished the series as Bangladesh&#x27;s leading batsman, with the most runs (105) and the highest batting average (52.50) for the team.

In April 2004, Rana was given a &quot;rookie contract&quot; with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB); the six-month contract provided him with a basic salary, lower than that of senior players. When Bangladesh toured the West Indies in May–June 2004, he took 3/21 in 10 overs in an ODI in Kingstown, Saint Vincent. In the match, Rana opened the batting and ran out the West Indian wicket-keeper Ridley Jacobs as Bangladesh lost by one wicket. He played in all the matches of the three-match series and topped the batting averages for Bangladesh, with 40 runs at an average of 40.00. He also took five wickets at 14.00, putting him second in Bangladesh&#x27;s bowling averages. On the same tour, Rana played his third Test match for Bangladesh. In the match, which the West Indies won by an innings and 99 runs, Rana made scores of 7 and 35, taking no wickets while conceding 100 runs.

===Dropped from the Test team===
When Zimbabwe toured Bangladesh in January 2005, Rana was twice man of the match in the ODI series. In the fourth match of the series, he took his career-best figures of 4/34. He played in four matches of the five match series, scoring 37 runs at 18.50 and taking 9 wickets at 15.22, finishing as Bangladesh&#x27;s lead wicket-taker for the series.

Although he would later represent Khulna in first-class matches, Rana&#x27;s last one-day match for them was on 9 March 2006.

===Return to domestic cricket===
After playing his last ODI in March 2006, Rana played four more one-day matches, all for Bangladesh A. At the same time, he continued to represent Khulna Division in first-class cricket. In the Bangladesh 2006–07 cricket season, Rana played 10 first-class matches, in which he scored 571 runs at 35.68, made two centuries and took 34 wickets at 18.85. The 10 first-class matches included one fixture in which he represented Bangladesh A against Zimbabwe A. The last match Rana played was a first-class match against Dhaka Division. He captained his side in the match, which Khulna lost, although he took 9 wickets in the match.

==Death==
Two months before his death, Rana was involved in a motorcycle crash from which he emerged unharmed. Aged 22, Rana died in an accident on 16 March 2007 in Dumuria Upazila, Khulna, while the Bangladesh cricket team were in the Caribbean for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The accident happened when his motorcycle collided with a microbus and then hit an electrical pole at the side of the road. Sajjadul Hasan, who was a cricketer for Khulna Division, was also killed in the accident. The then Bangladesh captain, Habibul Bashar, said &quot;It&#x27;s shocking news for all of us, he was a friend and a team-mate. The boys are very upset.&quot;

Prior to their first World Cup match, the Bangladesh team declared that they would play in memory of Rana and held a one-minute silence in his memory before the start of play. They wore black arm bands during the match, in which they picked up an unexpected five-wicket victory over India. Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar dedicated the win to Rana. At the end of the match he walked around the ground, holding a picture of Rana and acknowledged the Bangladeshi spectators. Rana&#x27;s death at the age of 22 years, 316 days makes him the youngest ever Test cricketer to die. Additionally, he and Bashar formerly held the record for the highest fourth-wicket partnership for Bangladesh in Tests when on 4 June 2004, they posted a 120-run stand against the West Indies cricket team.

In 2009, the BCB set up a welfare trust for current and former players, as well as staff and officials associated with it. As part of the scheme, all the proceeds from the ticket sales for the first ODI between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in 2009 were given to Rana&#x27;s family.

On 4 May 2021, Bangladesh Cricket Board received backlash and criticism for its bizarre tweet by mentioning Manjural Islam Rana as the youngest ever Test cricketer to die at the age of 22 on his birthday anniversary.

Kandambi made his One Day International debut batting at six against Zimbabwe in 2004, but lasted four balls before he was caught behind off Mluleki Nkala for a duck. His next three performances brought him a total of 23 runs, and although he was on the team that won the 2004 Asia Cup, his performances was not enough for him to be selected to the 2004 Champions Trophy immediately following the Asia Cup, as he was replaced by Dilhara Fernando.

In 2008 he returned to Zimbabwe tour and scored a crucial 40 in a low-scoring game to set up the victory. After that series he joined the Pakistan tour of Sri Lanka and scored 59 runs against Pakistan in the 2nd ODI match which resulted in a win for Sri Lanka in that series.

==Domestic career==
The inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), an eight-team domestic twenty20 competition, was held in 2008. Maharoof was bought by the Delhi Daredevils for $225,000. He took 15 wickets in the tournament at an average of 16.60, making him the equal ninth-highest wicket-taker in competition. While playing for in the IPL in 2008, Maharoof was teammates with Australia seam bowler Glenn McGrath; according to Marahroof, McGrath helped him with his bowling variations, making a &quot;huge difference&quot;, and introduced more control to his slower ball. For his performances in 2008, he was named in the ESPNcricinfo IPL XI.

On 17 March 2011, it was announced that Maharoof would be joining Lancashire County Cricket Club for the entire English cricket season. He joined Lancashire with the intention of forcing his way back into Sri Lanka&#x27;s Test team. He made his first-class debut for the club on 20 April, taking the place of injured captain and bowler Glen Chapple. Batting at number eight Maharoof scored a century and took two wickets in the match as Lancashire won by an innings and 20 runs; it was just the seventh time a player had scored a century in their maiden first-class match with Lancashire.

After the second Test, Maharoof returned to play for Lancashire. Towards the end of June he was forced to miss a County Championship due to a stiff back. A few days later he took his 50th T20 wicket when he dismissed Martin Guptill in Lancashire&#x27;s 10-wicket win against Derbyshire, and in the process helped dismiss Derbyshire for their lowest total in the format. Maharoof was due to leave in mid-June to participate in the inaugural season of the Sri Lanka Premier League, planning to return to Lancashire in August, however the tournament was postponed until 2012. In the last match of the season, Lancashire won the County Championship for the first time since 1950 when they shared the title.

On his return to Sri Lanka, Maharoof finished as the leading run scorer in the 2011–12 Premier Limited Overs Tournament, a domestic competition. His team, the Nondescripts, won the Tier A title for the first time in five years and Maharoof was the competition&#x27;s leading run-scorer. In the final Maharoof scored 52 runs while opening the batting and dismissed Sachithra Senanayake to claim his 200th wicket in list A matches. His strong performances for the Nondescripts team led to a recall to the ODI squad for the 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series with India and Australia.
He captained Kathmandu Kings XI in Everest Premier League 2017 held in Nepal.

==International career==
===Debut years===
In April and May 2004, Maharoof was part of the Sri Lanka team that toured Zimbabwe for five ODIs and two Tests. Two players, including Maharoof, made their ODI debut in the third match of the series while three of the Sri Lankan regulars were rested. He took three wickets as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 35, the lowest score in ODI history. In the final two matches of the series, Maharoof took another wickets, finishing the series with five at an average of 16.60. On the same tour, Maharoof made his Test debut. Across the two matches, he scored 40 runs from one innings and took four wickets at an average of just under 40.

Sri Lanka hosted the Indian Oil Cup in July and August 2005; it was a tournament involving the hosts, India, and the West Indies. Ahead of the tournament Chaminda Vaas, one of Sri Lanka&#x27;s senior seam bowlers, sustained an injury and Maharoof was responsible for opening the bowling with Dilhara Lokuhettige. Maharoof produced one of the most economical bowling displays in ODI history, conceding nine-rune from ten overs against the West Indies for which he was named Man of the Match. He was reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for excessive appealing in the match as he began celebrating a dismissal before the batsman had been given out by the umpire.

===Permanent in the squad===
When Bangladesh toured for two Tests and three ODIs in August and September that year, Maharoof was against selected in Sri Lanka&#x27;s squad, allowing senior players to be rested for some of the matches. Although he didn&#x27;t play in either of the Tests, in the two ODIs Maharoof played he took six wickets at an average of 9.00, finishing equal with Tillakaratne Dilshan as leading wicket-taker in the series. The Sri Lanka coach at the time, Tom Moody, praised Maharoof&#x27;s bowling, saying &quot;Maharoof bowled superbly well in the Indian Oil series and has shown [against Bangladesh] that he going to be a more valuable bowler going into the future&quot;.

When Sri Lanka toured Indian in October to December 2005 for three Tests and seven ODIs, Maharoof was included in the squad. He played in six of the seven ODIs, taking six wickets at an average of 39.33 and scoring 60 runs from five innings. Sri Lanka lost the series and the captain at the time, Kumar Sangakkara, described the experience as &quot;a learning trip&quot; for Maharoof, noting that he had bowled well at times. Maharoof played a single Test on the tour, taking three wickets for 77 runs and scoring just six runs. In the qualifying round of the 2006 Champions Trophy, he picked up the best bowling analysis in the history of the tournament (6–14), which is also the ninth best analysis in all ODIs. That was against the defending champions West Indies, and was Maharoof&#x27;s first five wicket haul in ODIs.

Maharoof took his maiden first-class five-wicket haul in November 2006 in a match for Bloomfield against Ragam which ended in a draw. His 7 wickets for 73 runs beat his previous best bowling figures in first-class cricket of 4/12.

Maharoof took 4/23 against Bermuda to start the 2007 World Cup and became the first Sri Lankan to take a 4 wicket haul on his World Cup debut. On 7 October 2007 Maharoof took his 100th wicket in his 75th ODI; at the time he was the fastest Sri Lankan to reach the landmark, beating Muttiah Muralitharan by one match, however this record was later taken by fast bowler Lasith Malinga in 2010 who reached 100 wickets in 68 matches.

After the inaugural IPL in 2008, Maharoff joined the Sri Lanka squad in preparation for the 2008 Asia Cup, however an abdominal strain prevented him from taking part.

For his performances in 2008, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.

===Back to form===
On 22 June 2010 Maharoof took his first hat-trick in One day International against India in Asia Cup 2010. The cup&#x27;s final against India was his last match until early 2012. The auction for the 2011 IPL was held in January that year, and although Maharoof was available he was not signed by a team.

Sri Lanka embarked on a tour of England in May. Five players selected in the squad chose to participate in the IPL instead of Sri Lanka&#x27;s first warm-up match, and consequentially Maharoof was drafted in to provide cover until they arrived. Initially called up for a single tour match, Maharoof was added to the Test squad when seam bowlers Dilhara Fernando and Nuwan Pradeep sustained injuries. Having played in the first two Tests, Maharoof was left out of Sri Lanka&#x27;s squad for the ODI leg of the tour. Stuart Law, the team&#x27;s coach, explained that &quot;He hasn&#x27;t quite set the world on fire but he hasn&#x27;t done a lot wrong. It just hasn&#x27;t worked for him at this stage.&quot; His last ODI was the final of the Asia Cup in June 2010.

===Return===
Maharoof was included to the ODI squad for tour against England and Ireland in 2016, after 4 years in international arena. After 2008, he played his first T20I against England on 5 July 2016, where 72 T20Is were missed by Maharoof for Sri Lanka, before appearing in this match.

==Honors==
The Castrol Asian Cricket Awards were held for the first time in June 2008, and Maharoof was named best ODI Asian bowler. Although selected to tour Pakistan for three ODIs and two Tests in January to March 2009, Maharoof sustained a groin injury and was ruled out of the Tests.

==Playing style==
When it comes to batting, Maharoof has described himself as &quot;more of a hard hitter than a technician&quot;, and as of February 2012 his batting strike rate (85.24) is the fourth highest amongst Sri Lankans in ODIs. In the opinion of Kumar Sangakkara, he has &quot;the technique and the shots to be an excellent No. 7 batsman [at international level]&quot;. Maharoof has a sound batting technique and is able to adapt to many different scenarios. He is mostly known as a player who can score quick runs down the order, but he can also bat a more patient innings, especially if the top batting order collapses.

He bowls at speeds of up to and concentrates on accuracy rather than pace because pitches in Sri Lanka are generally slow. Sangakkara has also noted that Maharoof is able to swing the ball, complementing his accuracy. Under the advice of then Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody, in 2006 Maharoof altered his bowling action slightly so that his front arm was coming down straight in delivery. Of Sri Lankan players who have bowled at least 2,000 balls in Tests, Maharoof&#x27;s strike rate of one wicket every 117.6 deliveries per wicket is third worst behind Asoka de Silva (291.0) and Arjuna Ranatunga (148.3). Maharoof has been more successful in the opposition&#x27;s first innings in Tests, taking 20 of his 25 wickets under such circumstances at a strike of 107.7, which increases to 157.2 in the second.

<doc id="899183" wikidata="Q852068" url="?curid=899183" title="Monolith (Space Odyssey)">
<text>In Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; series, Monoliths are machines in black cuboids whose sides extend in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (12 : 22 : 32) built by an unseen extraterrestrial species whom Clarke dubbed the Firstborn and who he suggests are the earliest highly intelligent species to evolve in the Milky Way. 
In the series of novels (and the films based on these), three Monoliths are discovered in the Solar System by australopithecines and their human descendants. The characters&#x27; responses to their discoveries drive the plot of the series and influence its fictional history, particularly by encouraging humanity to progress with technological development.

The first monolith appears at the beginning of the story, four million years before the present era. It is discovered by a group of australopithecines and triggers a shift in evolution, starting with the ability to use tools and weaponry. It is later revealed that thousands of other Monoliths exist elsewhere in the galaxy.

==Origins==

The species that built the Monoliths is never described in detail, but some knowledge of its existence is given to Dave Bowman after he is transported by the star-gate to the &quot;cosmic zoo&quot;, as detailed in the 1968 novel &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and its 1982 sequel, &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot;. The existence of this species is only hypothesized by the rest of humanity, but it is obvious because the Monolith was immediately identified as an artefact of non-human origin.

The species that built the Monoliths developed interstellar travel millions or perhaps billions of years before the present time. In the novels, Clarke refers to them as the &quot;Firstborn&quot;, since they were quite possibly the first sapient species to possess a significant capability of interstellar travel. Members of this species explored the universe in the search of knowledge, especially knowledge about other intelligent species.

While these early explorers discovered that life was quite common, they observed that intelligent life was often stunted in its development, or else died out prematurely. Hence, they set about fostering it. Though not at all morphologically similar to humans, the Firstborn were nonetheless creatures of &quot;flesh and blood&quot;, and like humans, were originally mortal.

However, the evolutionary development projects they began would by their nature require very long time spans to complete, far longer than the lives of their creators. Therefore, the aliens created increasingly complex automated machines to oversee and carry out their projects over the eons. When they encountered a living world that had features in favour of the evolution of intelligent life, they left behind the Monoliths as remote observers that were also capable of taking a variety of actions according to their creators&#x27; wishes. One such planet, encountered when it was still quite young, was Earth. They also observed Jupiter and its watery moon, Europa. The decaying ecology of Mars was also visited, but passed over in favour of more fruitful locations like Earth. The Firstborn left behind three Monoliths to observe and enact their plan to encourage hominids to pursue technology and space travel.

As described in Clarke&#x27;s novel, the Firstborn discovered later how to transfer their consciousness into computers, and thus they became thinking machines. In the end, they surpassed even this achievement, and were able to transfer entirely from physical to noncorporeal forms—the &quot;Lords of the Galaxy&quot;—immortal and capable of travelling at great speeds. The Firstborn had abandoned physical form, but their creations, the Monoliths, remained, and continued to carry out their original assignments.

== Tycho Magnetic Anomalies ==

The term &quot;Tycho Magnetic Anomaly&quot; is something of a misnomer when referring to &quot;TMA-0&quot; and &quot;TMA-2&quot;, since neither of these is found on the Moon (let alone in Tycho Crater) and neither one of them emits any significant magnetic field, as described in the novel &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot;. (The characters in some of the novels do refer to this anomalous nomenclature quizzically.) In the novel, the Russian crewmen of the spaceship &quot;Alexei Leonov&quot; refer to TMA-2 as &quot;Zagadka&quot; (from the Russian word for &quot;enigma&quot;, &quot;mystery&quot;, or &quot;riddle&quot;).

===Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-1===
The name &quot;Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-1&quot; (also known as TMA-1) refers to the strong magnetic field found somewhere in the lunar Crater Tycho by an American scientific satellite. Astronauts find that this magnetic anomaly is caused by an alien Monolith buried about 15 meters below the surface. In the novel, when the Monolith is excavated and examined, it is found to be a black cuboid whose sides extend in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (12 : 22 : 32). Its measurements are given in the novel as ; actually a ratio of 1:4:8.8. The monolith is sitting on a platform of the same material above undisturbed rock. Clarke suggests that the sequence or ratio extends past the three known spatial dimensions into much higher dimensions.

TMA-1 was dug up during the lunar night but, after sunrise and its exposure to direct sunlight, TMA-1 emits a single powerful burst of energy, interpreted as radio waves – aimed at Iapetus (a moon of Saturn) in the novel or Jupiter in the motion picture. (The subsequent novels follow the continuity of the film, placing all of the activity around Jupiter.) Its powerful magnetic field disappears immediately. In the novel, some scientists speculate that its magnetic field came from large electric currents, circulating in a system of superconductors for millions of years as an energy-storage mechanism. All of that electric power was expended in the one signal aimed at what would be discovered to be TMA-2.

===Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-2===
An identical object (except in size) was found later, orbiting Jupiter (or on a moon of Saturn in the first novel, although this was changed to Jupiter in the sequel, &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot;). This object was dubbed &quot;TMA-2&quot;, a term that the book calls &quot;doubly inappropriate&quot;: it had no magnetic field, and was millions of miles from Tycho. (TMA-2 was often referred to as &quot;Big Brother&quot; due to David Bowman&#x27;s comments on its larger size.) TMA-2 acted as a Star Gate and transported Dave Bowman across the galaxy in 2001 and brought his consciousness back again in 2010, at which time it duplicated itself over a million times to transform Jupiter into a star. Afterwards, TMA-2 became the home for the digitized minds of Bowman and HAL and supposedly moved to Europa to watch over the evolution of life there. In &quot;2061: Odyssey Three&quot;, it is implied that TMA-2 is the monolith found resting on its side on Europa because it has the same size (2 kilometers long) and contains the digitized minds of Dave Bowman and HAL; however, no character refers to it as TMA-2 or Big Brother, instead christening it &quot;The Great Wall&quot;. In &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot;, the author changes the description of the Europan monolith to be 20 kilometers long, so it is unclear whether TMA-2 changed size or it is actually a different monolith. In any case, HAL and Bowman infect that monolith with a computer virus after it is learned that its superiors are sending an order to destroy humanity. As a result of the virus, TMA-0, TMA-1, and TMA-2/The Great Wall disappear from the Solar System.

===Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-0===
In the year 2513, the first Monolith to be encountered by humankind&#x27;s prehistoric evolutionary predecessors (the ones featured in the first novel) was found in Olduvai Gorge, buried in ancient rock, and retroactively dubbed &quot;TMA-0&quot;.

== Other Monoliths ==

Other than the Monoliths bearing TMA labels, there are many other Monoliths that are seen in the series. In two instances, millions of Monoliths are generated for a limited time. In the first, in &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot;, millions of Monoliths are generated to transform Jupiter into a star, subsequently named Lucifer. In the second, in &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot;, millions of monoliths are generated to block both the Earth and human-settled Ganymede from their primary star in an attempt to destroy the humans. Other specific monoliths are described below.

===The Great Wall===
A large Monolith is found resting on its side on Europa in the &quot;2061&quot; novel. It is nicknamed the Great Wall after the Great Wall of China due to its horizontal orientation. It is believed to be watching over the Europans in a manner similar to what TMA-0 did on Earth in the first book. The &quot;2061&quot; novel implies that this Monolith is TMA-2 from the previous novel, but the characters never refer to it as TMA-2 or &quot;Big Brother.&quot; It is described as being the same size as TMA-2 and is the home to the digitized minds of Bowman and HAL just as TMA-2 was at the end of the last novel. However, the &quot;3001&quot; novel changes the description of the Great Wall to be 20 kilometers long, so it is unclear whether this monolith is the same as TMA-2 or not. In &quot;2061&quot;, Bowman and HAL describe how it was knocked on its side and possibly damaged by the impact of Mount Zeus, a vast diamond shard from Jupiter&#x27;s core that struck Europa&#x27;s surface some time following Jupiter&#x27;s transformation. But in &quot;3001,&quot; the monolith on its side is described as having a purpose to protect the evolving Europans. (Arthur C. Clarke admitted to changing some concepts each time he wrote another sequel novel so it is not possible to fully reconcile TMA-2 and The Great Wall.)

===Minilith===
A small Monolith appears before Heywood Floyd in 2061 on board the &quot;Galaxy&quot; spacecraft. He nicknames it &quot;Minilith&quot; for its small size compared to other observed Monoliths. At the end of the book it is explained that Halman used the Minilith to replicate Heywood Floyd&#x27;s consciousness to help him uncover the Monolith&#x27;s operations.

===Superior Monolith===
In the &quot;3001&quot; novel, it is realized that back in the early 22nd century, TMA-2 broadcast a status report message to a point 450 light years away and is just now receiving instructions in return. Although unseen, this is assumed to be another monolith which is in charge of the monoliths in the Solar System. In other words, TMA-2 was reporting to its Superior.

==Appearance and capabilities==

In both films, all the Monoliths are black, extremely flat, non-reflective rectangular solids. In the first novel, the monolith on the African savannah was transparent and &quot;it was not easy to see except when the morning sun glinted on its edges&quot;, but became less transparent when active and was described as a crystal. Also, the final monolith is described as a transparent crystal that becomes less transparent when active.

In the novels and in the films, the dimensions of the monoliths are in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (the squares of the first three positive integers). These dimensions are the main source of debate about the simple external design of the Monoliths. It is suggested in the &quot;2001&quot; novel that this number series does not stop at three dimensions.

The Monoliths come in several different sizes: TMA-0 and TMA-1 are both about 11 feet long, TMA-2 is two kilometers long, and the &quot;minilith&quot; is smaller than TMA-1. The Great Wall Monolith is described as being two kilometers long in the &quot;2061&quot; novel but 20 kilometers long in the &quot;3001&quot; novel. Monoliths may be able to assume any size, because in &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot;, the Star Child, created from the astronaut Dave Bowman, cryptically notes that the Monolith is actually one size – &quot;as large as necessary&quot;.

The Monoliths are extremely long-lived and reliable machines, able to survive for millions of years buried in the ground or resisting meteorite impacts and radiation in space with no apparent damage. The two Monoliths recovered and examined by humans are virtually indestructible and impenetrable, resisting all attempts to analyze their composition or internal structure right up to the end of the series. Dr. Heywood Floyd proposes they have some sort of force shield, an impression he gets from touching it; this hypothesis is later accepted as probable because the Monoliths resist destructive testing beyond the theoretical limits of material strength. However, they are not completely indestructible: The Great Wall Monolith (perhaps the same as TMA-2) was knocked on its side and suffered from damage caused by a giant meteorite of solid diamond that collided with Europa in &quot;2061: Odyssey Three&quot;. In the final book, &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot;, all three Monoliths known to humankind are deactivated by being infected with a powerful computer virus.

While it is unclear what the composition of the Monoliths is, they clearly have mass, which is about the only observation that can be made. In the novel &quot;2010&quot;, the crewmen of the spaceship &quot;Alexei Leonov&quot; measure the mass of TMA-2 and find that it has a density slightly higher than that of air. The masses of TMA-0 and TMA-1 are never revealed by Clarke.

In &quot;2001&quot;, TMA-2 opens up a stargate that takes Dave Bowman on a trip across the universe at faster-than-light speeds, and with as much acceleration as the creators of the stargate wish. In &quot;2010&quot; and again in &quot;3001&quot;, TMA-2 teleports itself.

TMA-2 replicates itself by a form of symmetrical binary fission and exponential growth to create thousands or millions of identical Monoliths in just a matter of days. In &quot;2010&quot;, the many units act to increase the density of Jupiter until stellar ignition is carried out, converting the planet into a miniature star. In &quot;3001&quot;, millions of copies of TMA-2 assemble themselves into two megastructure disks that attempt to block the Sun from Earth and Lucifer from its colonies in the Jovian system.

The Monoliths are clearly described in the novels as controlled by an internal computer, like Von Neumann machines. In &quot;2061&quot;, the consciousness of Dave Bowman, HAL-9000, and Dr. Floyd become incorporated as computer programs in TMA-2 as their new home. TMA-2 then observes the development of the Europans and guards them from any interplanetary (i.e. human) interference.

Both TMA-1 and TMA-2 produce occasional, powerful, directional radio transmissions. TMA-2 sends a radio transmission towards a star system about 450 light years away in the 22nd century. However, only TMA-1 ever exhibited any strong magnetic fields.

==Actions==

The TMA-2 Monolith had judged that it would be desirable to nurture the primitive Europans by preventing the eventual freezing of their moon, and to keep humanity separated from them. TMA-2 thus converted Jupiter into a new star (dubbed &quot;Lucifer&quot;, meaning &quot;light-bringer&quot;) to warm Europa into more habitable conditions – at the cost of exterminating the Jovians, ocean-like creatures who swam through the upper atmosphere of Jupiter. The Jovians were judged too primitive, as due to their environment they had no hope of ever developing to become an advanced civilization. 

TMA-2 also apparently decided, in the early 21st century, that humanity was a failed species and that it was possibly necessary to destroy them. Apparently the TMA-2 Monolith was allowed to destroy primitive species at its own discretion, but needed the authorisation of a &quot;superior&quot; to destroy an advanced spaceflight-capable civilisation such as humanity. This &quot;superior&quot; was a Monolith located in a distant star system, but even the Monoliths were limited by the speed of light in their interstellar communications. Thus it took 450 years for the message sent by TMA-2 to reach its &quot;superior&quot;, which then sent a message giving permission to destroy humanity, which took another 450 years to return to the Sol system in the year 3001. Due to the efforts of Frank Poole and the Europa team on Earth, the ascended Dave Bowman and AI HAL (now fused as one being &quot;Halman&quot; in the Monolith&#x27;s computational matrix) were able to introduce a subtle computer virus into TMA-2 which destroyed it before it could render the human race extinct.

The Firstborn did not appear to have abandoned all interest in the evolutionary experiments overseen by the ancient Monoliths. The Monoliths&#x27; communications are said to be limited by the speed of light, but Dave Bowman is sent on an interstellar journey at the end of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, and Bowman is apparently transformed into the Star Child, not by the Monoliths, but by the Firstborn (both Kubrick and Clarke have similarly stated that Bowman was transformed by non-corporeal aliens, not the Monoliths). They also subsequently transform HAL in 2010, to give Bowman a companion. The epilogue to &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot; reveals that the Firstborn had been monitoring humanity&#x27;s final confrontation with the Monoliths in the Sol system, but chose not to intervene, likely considering it a test of mankind&#x27;s abilities - either they would find a way to stop the Monoliths and thus prove their worth, or fail and prove the Monoliths&#x27; point. Unlike the TMA-2 Monolith, whose judgment of humanity was based on its social progress by the year 2001, the Firstborn considered the more peaceful and responsible humanity of the year 3001 worthy of survival, or at least not a threat to the Europans. Their assessment seems to prove true, as subsequently Frank Poole and the other humans land on Europa and attempt to start peaceful relations with the primitive native Europs.

==Europa==

When TMA-2 transformed Jupiter into the new star &quot;Lucifer&quot;, it warmed Europa to nearly the average temperature of Earth, melting the ice sheets which once covered the moon - and giving an evolutionary boost to indigenous life-forms which had existed in the oceans hidden beneath. This is directly compared to how the original TMA-0 gave pre-human apes an evolutionary nudge on the path towards sapience. The near-sapient life-forms on Europa are dubbed &quot;Europs&quot; by humans.

Due to the branching storylines of each book, the third novel ends with a flash-forward 20,000 years into the future, with the Europs developing a basic civilization without outside contact from humanity. The fourth and final novel, &quot;3001&quot;, altered this to end with the revived Frank Poole making first contact with the Europs and attempting to begin peaceful relations. 

Physically, Europs are described as looking like &quot;a small, leafless bush, with no obvious sense organs or means of communication&quot;. They walk on half a dozen slender trunks, which divide into hundreds of twigs, which divide again - making them very dexterous, and potential tool-users. Prior to the Monoliths&#x27; interference, they evolved as filter-feeders on the frozen seas under the moon&#x27;s ice, using their twig-arms to strain for plankton. They were hunted by predators, one notable species of which is described as &quot;like a flying carpet, but as big as a football field&quot;, dredging the ocean floor. In response, the Europs gradually evolved to build basic shelters for themselves on the ocean floor - comparable to Earth cephalopods using shells as &quot;tools&quot; in the form of protection. The Monolith&#x27;s warming of the moon spurred the Europs to become amphibious, migrating on land where they construct basic ice-igloos, as an advance over their underwater hovels. The Europs still need to return to water to feed, but now have total protection from aquatic predators while they sleep in their land-based shelters. 

Because life in Europa&#x27;s oceans evolved around thermal vents that received no sunlight, the Europs&#x27; biochemistry is based on sulfur respiration. This is much less energy efficient than the Terran biosphere&#x27;s oxygen-based respiration, resulting in the Europs being very slow: it&#x27;s remarked that &quot;even a sloth could outrun a Europ&quot;. This limit on energy efficiency also results in Europs being much smaller than humans. Overall, without the protection of the Monoliths, the Europs could have easily been wiped out by humanity with little effort. 

One area of pre-sapient activity observed among the Europs by 3001 is that they are fascinated by metal artefacts from crashed human spaceships and probes - as they have no counterpart in their raw state under the oceans. Whenever the Europs find abandoned human machinery (or the crashed ship &quot;Tsien&quot;) they strip all the metal from them, and pile it in heaps, frequently rearranging the pieces. Frank Poole speculatively compares this to the &quot;Cargo cult&quot; phenomenon on Earth in the twentieth century, and cites it as a spark of curiosity that shows an advance from pure animal instinct. At the end of the final novel, when Frank Poole approaches the Europs for first contact, he carries a large, shiny copper wire as a peace offering to them.

==Design==
The first design for the Monolith for the &quot;2001&quot; film was a tetrahedral pyramid. This was taken from the 1951 short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot; that the first story was based on.
A London firm was approached to provide a plexiglass pyramid, and due to construction constraints they recommended a flat slab shape. Kubrick approved, but was disappointed with the glassy appearance of the prop on set, leading art director Anthony Masters to suggest making the monolith black. The rejected acrylic monolith can be seen in St Katherine Dock, London, where it was hung in 1977 to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s silver jubilee.
Interestingly, the aspect ratio of the monolith (9:4) is the same as the rectangular holes in a standard Hollerith Twelve-Row Computer Punched Card (0.126:0.056).

==Replicas==
Replicas have been displayed in some places as a tribute to the movie:

* A black bronze monolith of roughly the same size as the original (about 5m tall) was erected in 1973 on the campus of the University of Hawaii at Mānoa and has been standing ever since.

* During the Dutch Hackers at Large conference in 2001, a replica monolith was erected. 

* In Kerbal Space Program, players can find several monoliths scattered around the kerbolar system.
* Similar looking monoliths on the moon and Mars in the game Space Engineers.

* In 2016, a replica appeared at the NASA Ames Research Center.
* In June 2020, a tall wooden replica was found in the main courtyard of the École normale supérieure (ENS) University in Paris.
* On October 2023, an ultra black (low reflectivity) 1:4:9 monolith replica appeared during the European Space Research and Technology Centre open day in the squash court. It has since been installed in the Winter garden at ESTEC.
* In the 2014 film &quot;Interstellar&quot;, directed by Christopher Nolan, two robots named TARS and CASE accompany four NASA astronauts on their journey in the search of a new home for humanity. The robots have a striking resemblance to the monoliths.
* In &quot;Spore&quot;, players can use monoliths to increase the intelligence of creatures on other planets, allowing them to progress into the Space stage.

<text>Imran Farhat (Punjabi:عمران فرحت}}}}, born 20 May 1982) is a Pakistani cricket coach and former cricketer who played for Pakistan national cricket team between 2001 and 2013. He usually opened the batting in most of his international innings. In January 2021, he retired from cricket, following the group stage of the 2020–21 Pakistan Cup.

==Personal life==
His brother Humayun Farhat has also played International cricket for Pakistan.

He&#x27;s the son-in-law of former Pakistani Test batsman Mohammad Ilyas.

He is an alumnus of the Beaconhouse School System.

==Cricket career==
===Domestic career===
Farhat made his senior debut aged 15 in a one-day match for Karachi City against Malaysia, together with three other players who went on to play Test cricket (Taufeeq Umar, Bazid Khan and Kamran Akmal).

He continued to score heavily in the domestic competitions and a century in a practice game against the visiting Indian team was rewarded with a place in the squad to take on India in the Test series in 2006.

In the 2012–13 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, Farhat scored 303 runs for Lahore Ravi against Peshawar. He was the leading run-scorer for Habib Bank Limited in the 2017–18 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, with 494 runs in ten matches. He was also the leading run-scorer for Habib Bank Limited in the 2018–19 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, with 744 runs in eleven matches.

In September 2019, he was named in Balochistan&#x27;s squad for the 2019–20 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy tournament. In January 2021, he was named as the captain of Balochistan for the 2020–21 Pakistan Cup.

===International career===
Three years later, in February 2001, Farhat made his One Day International debut, against New Zealand in Auckland, scoring 20 runs in a chase of 150 to win. After the tour of New Zealand, where Farhat played three Tests and three ODIs, he was sent back to domestic cricket before returning against Australia in the third Test of the 2002–03 series, where he made 30 and 22 in an innings defeat. However, he was retained for the home two-Test series against South Africa in 2003–04, where he scored 235 runs including a maiden Test century in a 1–0 series win, second behind fellow opener Taufeeq Umar.

A month later, Farhat played in an ODI-only series against New Zealand, which Pakistan won 5–0, and Farhat made three fifties along with his second international century, ending with 348 runs at a batting average of 69.60, once again the second-highest number of runs – this time behind Yasir Hameed. The season was rounded off with another century, this time against India, where he made 101 to help Pakistan gain a 202-run first-innings lead and eventually won the match by nine wickets. However, Farhat tallied 81 runs in the other two matches, which Pakistan lost to lose the series 1–2.

Farhat was less impressive the following season, however, and in four Tests, two against Sri Lanka and two against Australia, he only passed fifty twice, ending the season with 199 runs at 24.87 before the selectors left him out for the third Test of the series with Australia.

In September 2004, just before the 2004–2005 season, he had been dropped from the ODI side following the 2004 Champions Trophy, as he had failed to pass 40 with any of his last ten innings, and that included 38 not out against the non-Test nation of Kenya, 20 against ODI debutants Hong Kong and 24 against Bangladesh.

He returned to Test cricket in style against India, with an important half century in the deciding third Test at Karachi. He scored a brilliant unbeaten century in the final test against New Zealand in 2009.

==Coaching career==
In February 2021, he began to undertake level 2 coaching courses with the Pakistan Cricket Board.

In September 2022, he was appointed batting coach to the Bahawalpur Royals squad for the inaugural season of the Pakistan Junior League.

In November 2022, he began to undertake level 3 coaching courses with the PCB.

In February 2023, he was appointed batting coach to the Afghanistan team.

<text>Yasir Hameed Qureshi (Urdu: یاسر حمید قریشی) (born 28 February 1978) is a former Pakistani cricketer, who played 25 Tests and 56 ODIs for Pakistan. He scored two centuries (i.e., 100 runs or more in an innings) on his Test debut against Bangladesh, becoming only the second player to do so just after Lawrence Rowe.

==Personal life==
Born in Peshawar, he&#x27;s originally from Kukmang, Abbottabad District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

==Cricket career==
===Domestic career===
In September 2007, Yasir Hameed played a major role in defeating Australia A in a comprehensive 3–0 defeat while representing Pakistan A. He scored two centuries out of the three matches and was given good support by Naved Latif and Taufeeq Umar while the bowlers also did well in the series.

He was the leading run-scorer for Federally Administered Tribal Areas in the 2017–18 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, with 459 runs in seven matches.

===International career===
During his first thirty One Day International innings, he scored more runs than any other batsman, as well as scoring four successive opening partnerships of 100 or more with Imran Farhat, a unique achievement. He scored first 1000 ODI runs in just 22 matches, fastest in Asia and third fastest in world.

He was then left out of the squad because of a dip in form. He came back in the final ODI in the Bank Alfalah Series against England in 2005/6, scored 57 but was again ignored only to return against West Indies in the fourth match in November 2006, where he scored 71 runs from 118 balls. He has not played international cricket since August 2010.

In 2003 on his Test debut, he scored 170 runs in Karachi. This is the highest score by a Pakistani on debut. He also scored 105 in the second innings of the same match.

He played 22 further Tests before losing his place in the side following Pakistan&#x27;s unsuccessful tour of India in 2007. He was recalled nearly 18 months later for Pakistan&#x27;s two-match series against Australia, played in England owing to the security situation in Pakistan where he played two test matches against England and he was again dropped from the national side.

== Post-retirement ==

=== Coaching career ===
In February 2021, he began to undertake coaching courses with the Pakistan Cricket Board.

=== Cricket administration ===
In February 2023, he became a member of Haroon Rasheed&#x27;s national selection committee.

<text>Imran Nazir () (born 16 December 1981) is a Pakistani former cricketer who played for the Pakistan national cricket team between 1999 and 2012 and was widely known to be a hard hitting opening batter.

==Domestic career==
In 2008, Nazir signed for the Indian Cricket League and played for the Lahore Badshahs. He scored 111 runs not out, off just 44 deliveries, against the Hyderabad Heroes in the third of the best of three finals of the tournament and helped his team achieve victory. After signing up for the Indian Cricket League, his chances of ever playing again for Pakistan looked slim. However, on 2 February 2009, a Pakistani court suspended the ban on Indian Cricket League players, which paved the way for Nazir to make a return to international cricket.

Since then, he has played two National T20 cups. He was selected for the Hong Kong Sixes tournament 2010 in Hong Kong as a member of the Pakistani squad. The final match, which was in Pakistan&#x27;s favour, was lost due to Imran Nazir&#x27;s bowling. 46 runs were required from the last 8-ball over but Imran Nazir gave away 48 runs in 7 balls.

In Twenty20 games he has a bowling average of 1.00 and in his 8 deliveries he has 3 wickets a strike rate of less than 3. He has also played for Dhaka Dynamites in Bangladesh&#x27;s NCL T20 Bangladesh.
He has played for Dhaka Gladiators in Bangladesh Premier League (BPL). He has played 7 matches in BPL and has scored 207 runs with an average of 41.4 runs per game. He has a strike rate of 150. His highest score is 58 and he has scored 2 half centuries in this tournament and has hit twenty one 4s and nine 6s. He has played for Lahore Qalandars in 2018 Abu Dhabi T20 Trophy.

==International career==
Nazir made his debut in Test cricket in March 1999 against Sri Lanka at Lahore in Pakistan, and his One Day International debut against the same opposition at Visakhapatnam in India. He played in 8 Test matches between 1999–2002 and secured a spot in the Pakistan squad since 2002. He also played in One Day International arena, but he could never cement his place in the squad. The emergence of several Pakistan opening batsmen such as Imran Farhat, Mohammad Hafeez, Yasir Hameed, Taufeeq Umar, and Salman Butt kept him out of the national side. However, he displayed excellent cricketing performances in first-class cricket.

Nazir made his return to the national team in the second One Day International against South Africa in February 2007 during Pakistan&#x27;s tour of South Africa. He impressed the Pakistan national selectors with his innings of 57 runs from just 39 deliveries, though he struggled to score runs during the rest of the tournament.

Nazir was named in Pakistan&#x27;s squad for the 2007 World Cup. He scored 160 runs against Zimbabwe in Pakistan&#x27;s last match during the 2007 Cricket World Cup, after being knocked out by Ireland.

It was the second highest score by a Pakistani batter and the eighth highest score by any batter in World Cup history and his 8 sixes equalled the World Cup record of Australian batter, Ricky Ponting. It was also the highest runs he scored in List A cricket.

Having severed ties with the Indian Cricket League, Nazir was recalled to the One Day International and Twenty20 squads for Pakistan&#x27;s tour of Sri Lanka in August 2009. In November 2009, he scored 58 from 38 balls in a Twenty20 against New Zealand claiming the man of the match award. However, after scores of 4 and 2 against England in early 2010 he was dropped from the side for the World Twenty20.

Nazir was recalled to the Pakistan team in September 2012 for the Twenty20 series against Australia and the following ICC World Twenty20 which was held in Sri Lanka. He scored 153 runs in 6 matches with a reasonable average of 25.50 and with a strike rate of 150.00 which included a match winning innings of 72 against Bangladesh. Nazir played his last international cricket in October 2012.

==Charity work==
In May 2011, Nazir made a surprise guest appearance at a charity cricket match at Luton Town Football Club between a football legends team and Luton Pakistanis CC. The event was staged to promote community cohesion in the town, as well as raise money for a cancer charity.

==Personal life==
Imran Nazir has one brother (Mushtaq Nazir) . He is married to Amber Hafeez. His wedding was held in 2009. Imran Nazir has said that his elder brother was his cricketing idol during his childhood.

Nazir suffered a joint problem which had him bedridden for four and a half years. &quot;I couldn’t use my hands. I was unable to fully bend my fingers, there was stiffness. If I was to bend my arm, there was a locking of the elbow joint Every joint in my body ached. I couldn’t get up, I couldn’t lie down, I couldn’t sleep&quot;, said Nazir. He was able to resume playing cricket in 2018 after receiving stem cell therapy and platelet-rich plasma therapy.

<doc id="899188" wikidata="Q3518507" url="?curid=899188" title="Shoaib Malik">
<text>Shoaib Malik (Punjabi, (; born 1 February 1982) is a Pakistani cricketer who played for the Pakistan national cricket team and currently plays for Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League (PSL). He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2007 to 2009. He made his One-Day International debut in 1999 against the West Indies and his Test debut in 2001 against Bangladesh.

== Early and personal life ==

=== Family background ===
Malik was born into a middle-class Punjabi Rajput family in Sialkot.

His father Malik Faqueer Hussain, a modest shopkeeper who sold local footwear and supported his son&#x27;s passion for cricket, died of throat cancer in 2006.

His brother Adeel Malik and nephew Mohammad Huraira are also cricketers.

=== Relationships ===
Malik was married in 2002 to Ayesha Siddiqui which ended in divorce on 7 April 2010. 

Malik reportedly dated Indian actress Sayali Bhagat, whom he met in 2008 when he was supposed to make his Bollywood debut, but they eventually separated when he announced his engagement to Indian tennis player Sania Mirza. Writing in 2008 for &quot;CricInfo&quot;, Andrew McGlashan called Bhagat his &quot;real-life girlfriend.&quot; Both Malik and Bhagat, however, denied such reports, calling them publicity stunts to market their under-production film.

On 12 April 2010 he married Sania Mirza in a traditional Hyderabadi Muslim wedding ceremony at the Taj Krishna Hotel in Hyderabad, India, followed by Pakistani wedding customs. Their walima ceremony was held in Shoaib&#x27;s native Sialkot, Pakistan. Their wedding received media and online attention across the world. The couple announced their pregnancy via social media on 23 April 2018. Their first child, a boy, was born on 30 October 2018. In January of 2024 Mirza&#x27;s family announced that she had gotten a divorce from Malik a few months prior.

On 19 January 2024, Shoaib married Pakistani TV actress Sana Javed in a private Nikah ceremony at her home in Karachi.

== Early career ==
He first played tape ball cricket in the streets as a child. He began playing cricket seriously in 1994 when he attended one of Imran Khan&#x27;s travelling coaching clinics in Sialkot at the age of 12. He began as a batsman, and developed his bowling later. He used to get in trouble with his family for playing cricket, as they wanted him to focus on his education. In 1996, Malik attended trials for the U-15 World Cup. He was selected in the squad for his bowling.

In May 2001, Malik&#x27;s bowling action was inspected. The PCB group of bowling advisers concluded that his stock off-spinner was legal, although his delivery going the other way was not. He was encouraged to concentrate on his off-spin and to practice bowling his other delivery without bending his arm. In a One Day International (ODI) match against England in June 2001, Malik suffered a fractured right shoulder after falling awkwardly while attempting to take a catch.

Malik was approached by Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in July 2003 to act as a replacement for Ian Harvey, who was on international duty with Australia. John Bracewell, the club&#x27;s director of cricket, commented that he was &quot;excited by the prospect of signing an international spinning all-rounder to replace Ian during the Cheltenham Festival and the C&amp;G semi-finals. He will add a new and refreshing dimension to the sq­uad ... which is in keeping with our playing philosophy to both win and entertain&quot;. He sufficiently impressed in two County Championship and three one-day matches that resulted in renewing of his contract for the 2004 season. Mark Alleyne, the club&#x27;s head coach, remarked that &quot;Shoaib did very well for us last year in the short time he was with us and fitted in very well. He is a gifted all-rounder who is worthy of a place in either discipline and as a 21-year-old, he can only get better and I am really pleased at having him in my squad­&quot;. Over the course of his two seasons at Gloucestershire, Malik played eight first-class matches, scoring 214 runs at an average of 17.83 with two fifties and taking 15 wickets at an average of 45.06, with best bowling figures of 3/76. He also played twelve one-day matches, scoring 345 runs at an average of 43.12 with three fifties and taking 10 wickets at an average of 47.60, with best bowling figures of 3/28.

In October 2004, Malik was reported to the International Cricket Council (ICC) for having a &quot;potentially flawed bowling action&quot;; eight months later, his action was cleared. In the intervening period, Malik was used mainly as a batsman. He was fined Rs10,000 and was also given a one-Test ban by the Pakistan Cricket Board after admitting to deliberately losing a Twenty20 match for the Sialkot Stallions against Karachi Zebras to knock Lahore Eagles out of the 2004–05 ABN-AMRO Twenty-20 Cup. The inquiry concluded that the incident &quot;damaged Pakistan&#x27;s cricketing image and had shown disrespect to the crowd&quot;, but that &quot;his actions were not part of any match-fixing with no financial implications, but were an immature attempt to express his disappointment at earlier decisions in the competition that he felt went against his side&quot;. PCB also declared the match void and Karachi Zebras were denied a place in the triangular phase of the ABN Amro Twenty20 Cup despite initially winning their Pool ‘B’ fixture against Sialkot Stallions.

During his Test career, Malik has batted at 5 different positions and has the unusual record of batting at every position except 11th in ODIs. Pakistan&#x27;s problems in finding a reliable opening pair have led to Malik being used as an opener in Test and ODI matches. In Test cricket, he made a big impression with his match-saving innings against Sri Lanka in 2006, during which he batted for the whole day and finished with 148 runs not out. His bowling has been effective at times, especially in one-day cricket where his best bowling figures are four wickets for 19 runs (4/19) in addition to many 3-wicket hauls.

On the international stage Malik struggled in England. In 12 ODIs across four tours between 2001 and 2006 he scored 98 runs at an average of 8.16, with just two scores above 20, far below his career ODI average of 34.35. Of players who have played at least eight ODIs in England, Malik&#x27;s is the furthest below his overall average.

His knock of 128 against India at Centurion in 2009 was later nominated to be one of the Best ODI Batting Performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo.

==Pakistan captaincy==

Following Inzamam-ul-Haq&#x27;s resignation as Pakistan captain after the 2007 World Cup, Malik was put forward as one of the names for the captaincy along with Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf. After Younus Khan&#x27;s rejection, Malik was the popular choice as a younger player and was seen to represent a fresh start after the Inzamam era.

He was named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo for the 2007 T20I World Cup.

Pakistan&#x27;s coach, Bob Woolmer, was a strong advocate of Malik&#x27;s case to become captain; in Woolmer&#x27;s opinion Malik was &quot;the sharpest tactical tack among his group ... a real presence on the field&quot;. Former skipper Imran Khan also backed Malik for the role, stating &quot;He appears to have a good cricket brain and could turn out to be a very good choice for Pakistan cricket&quot;. Malik was appointed captain on 19 April 2007 by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), his experience considering his relatively young age and consistent performances were cited as other reasons for his appointment. At the age of just 25, he was Pakistan&#x27;s fourth youngest captain.

In Malik&#x27;s first series as captain, Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka 2–1 in an ODI series in Abu Dhabi. His next assignments were home Test and ODI series against South Africa, which Pakistan lost 1–0 and 3–2 respectively. 3–2 was the score in favour of India when Pakistan subsequently played an ODI series against their arch-rivals. Malik hit 89 and took three wickets in the final match, which Pakistan won by 31 runs.

Malik&#x27;s captaincy lasted two years. A report by the coach and manager criticised his leadership, claiming that Malik was &quot;a loner, aloof and involved in his own little world, which is OK but not when the team required a fully committed captain  We do not see any meaningful communication between players and captain other than his five-minute talk during the team meeting&quot;. Younis Khan took over as captain on 27 January 2009 after a poor performance against Sri Lanka saw Malik step down. In his two-year tenure as captain, Malik led his country in three Tests, losing two and drawing one, and 36 ODIs, of which Pakistan won 24, and 17 T20Is, winning 12.

When Pakistan were touring South Africa in December 2018-February 2019, Sarfraz Ahmed, the current captain banned for under ICC for racist comments on SA player Andile Phehlukwayo, Malik had taken charge for his limited overs till that tour 2 ODIs and 3 T20Is. He also took charge of Pakistan&#x27;s limited over team in the absence of Sarfraz Ahmed who was rested for the ODI series against Australia March 2019.

==Post-captaincy==
In March 2010, Malik was given a one-year ban from the national team by the PCB, who charged him for infighting within the team. It was part of a dramatic cull of players after Pakistan&#x27;s winless tour of Australia, resulting in the fining or banning of seven players. Two months later Lancashire County Cricket Club approached Malik to play for them during Twenty20 Cup in England and the opportunity to play with a club of Lancashire&#x27;s reputation was too good to pass up&quot;. On 29 May 2010, Malik&#x27;s ban was overturned and his Rs 2 million fine halved. He was subsequently named in the MSL 2019 squad, and as a result, Malik pulled out of his contract with Lancashire. Pakistan did not make the final of the four-team tournament, and Malik played in two matches, scoring only 47 runs. Mailk was in Pakistan&#x27;s squad to play Australia and England in England in June–August 2010, but was dropped from the side. A regular in the ODI side, over the previously 12 months he had averaged around 30 with the bat in ODIs, and excluding one score over 50, his batting average hovered around 20. Mohsin Khan, Pakistan&#x27;s chairman of selectors, cited Malik&#x27;s poor recent form as the reason for dropping him. After Malik&#x27;s comeback to international cricket in 2015, he was an integral part of the Pakistan squad who were crowned champions of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 by defeating arch-rivals India in the final.

In April 2018, he was named in the Rest of the World XI squad for the one-off T20I against the West Indies, to be played at Lord&#x27;s on 31 May 2018. In August 2018, he was one of thirty-three players to be awarded a central contract for the 2018–19 season by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).

In October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Comilla Victorians team, following the draft for the 2018–19 Bangladesh Premier League.

In April 2019, he was named in Pakistan&#x27;s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. He had a horrible World Cup campaign, with only 8 runs from 3 matches, with two golden ducks, and took only 1 wicket with the ball, and was even dropped from the team. Following the Cricket World Cup, Shoaib retired from ODI cricket.

In June 2020, he was named in a 29-man squad for Pakistan&#x27;s tour to England during the COVID-19 pandemic.

He was named in Pakistan&#x27;s squad for the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup, where he scored the tournament&#x27;s joint-fastest fifty.

==Playing style==
According to ESPNcricinfo&#x27;s Osman Samiuddin:
Malik is regarded as a flexible player. He is capable of hitting big shots but is also capable of rotating the strike with good placement. He has a strike rate of 80.4 runs per 100 balls, which compares favourably to players such as Rahul Dravid and Inzamam ul-Haq. His most brazen display of &quot;power hitting&quot; came in 2003 against South Africa when he scored 82 from 41 balls. As is required of most modern players, he also has displayed good defensive batting at times.

==T20 franchise cricket==

=== IPL career ===
Shoaib Malik was signed by Delhi Daredevils, and played in the inaugural season of the IPL. He could only score 52 runs in 7 matches and picked up 2 wickets in the tournament. He did not play in the 2nd edition of IPL (or any edition since then) due to the tense atmosphere after the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

===Pakistan Super League===
Shoaib Malik was appointed the captain of the Karachi Kings in the first PSL tournament. His team under his captaincy won only two matches in the whole tournament which also affected his own performance. In the last match, he handed over the captaincy to Ravi Bopara and appeared as a player in the match. He was retained by the kings for the second season. He had a much better season compared to the first one, as he scored runs in crucial matches and ended the season as third highest-runs scorer for his side, scoring 202 runs in 10 innings. In third season, he joined new PSL franchise Multan Sultans as their captain. He led his team well during the first part of the tournament but couldn&#x27;t maintain the form when it mattered the most, as a result finished the tournament at 5th place. He had a good tournament with bat as well, scoring 224 runs across 8 innings with a strike rate of 124.44. As a result of the termination of the Multan Sultans franchise before the fourth season of the PSL due to fee-payment issues, the PCB created a new team up for bidding, temporarily named as The Sixth Team, of which Malik was assigned the role of captain. After being demoted from Platinum category to Diamond Category and after being released by Multan Sultans, Shoaib Malik was picked by Peshawar Zalmi in the 2020 Pakistan Super League players draft and will play in the 2020 Pakistan Super League representing Peshawar Zalmi as an all-rounder.

=== Caribbean Premier League career ===
Shoaib Malik was part of Barbados Tridents from 2013 to 2017 and played for them in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th edition of Caribbean Premier League. He was signed by Guyana Amazon Warriors for the sixth edition of CPL. He was also given the captaincy of Guyana Amazon Warriors. He was retained by the franchise for the seventh edition of CPL. He was supposed to play in the eighth edition of CPL as well but he was named in Pakistan&#x27;s squad for their tour of England and therefore missed the CPL 2020. In May 2021, he returned to Guyana Amazon Warriors again for the 9th season of Caribbean Premier League.

===Other leagues===
In 2013, he was signed by Hobart Hurricanes for the 2013–14 Big Bash League season. He was retained by Hobart Hurricanes for the 2014–15 Big Bash League season. He was also part of the Hobart Hurricanes to participate in the 2014 CLT20.

In 2014, he was signed by Warwickshire for a six-match deal for the 2014 T20 Blast.

In 2015, Malik played for Comilla Victorians in the third season of Bangladesh Premier League. In 2016, he was signed by Chittagong Vikings for the fourth edition of Bangladesh Premier League. He was drafted back into the squad by Comilla Victorians for the fifth and sixth edition of Bangladesh Premier League. He was then signed by Rajshahi Royals for the seventh edition of the Bangladesh Premier League.

In June 2019, he was selected to play for the Vancouver Knights franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. In November 2019, he was selected to play for Rajshahi Royals in the 2019-20 Bangladesh Premier League. In October 2020, he was drafted by the Jaffna Stallions for the inaugural edition of the Lanka Premier League.

In November 2021, he was selected to play for the Jaffna Kings following the players&#x27; draft for the 2021 Lanka Premier League. In July 2022, he was signed by the Jaffna Kings for the third edition of the Lanka Premier League.

==Beyond cricket==
===Business===
In 2021 he turned to entrepreneurship by launching his own signature perfume, &quot;All Rounder&quot;.

===Acting===
He made his acting debut in 2022 with cameo appearances in the webseries &quot;Baarwan Khiladi&quot; and in the movie &quot;Chakkar&quot;, and expects to get more seriously involved in the field in the near future.

===Hosting===
While he has appeared on different TV shows over the years, mainly as a cricket analyst, in 2022 he himself became a host through ARY Digital&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimate Muqabla&quot;, an adventure-action reality game show with the contestants being celebrities performing different thrilling tasks in Thailand.

<doc id="899190" wikidata="Q1441484" url="?curid=899190" title="Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater">
<text>Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater (21 May 1736 – 8 March 1803), known as Lord Francis Egerton until 1748, was a British nobleman from the Egerton family. He was the youngest son of the 1st Duke. He did not marry, and the dukedom expired with him, although the earldom was inherited by a cousin, Lieutenant-General John Egerton.

A pioneer of canal construction, he is famed as the &quot;father of British inland navigation&quot;, who commissioned the Bridgewater Canal—often said to be the first true canal in Britain, and the modern world. The canal was built for him by his agent John Gilbert with advice from James Brindley to service his coal mines at Worsley, in Lancashire.

==Life==
Bridgewater, the younger son of Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater, was born on 21 May 1736. Upon the death of their father in 1745, his elder brother inherited the title to become John Egerton, 2nd Duke of Bridgewater. He died only three years later, and Francis succeeded to the dukedom at the age of twelve, becoming 3rd Duke of Bridgewater and 6th Earl of Bridgewater.

As a child Francis was sickly and of such unpromising intellectual capacity that at one time the idea of cutting the entail was seriously entertained by his mother. Despite this, after some education, Francis began to exhibit business acumen and developed several business interests in North-West England.

Shortly after attaining his majority he became engaged to the society beauty the Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, but her refusal to give up the acquaintance of her sister, Lady Coventry, led to the breaking off of the match. Thereupon the Duke broke up his London establishment, and retired to his estate at Worsley where he devoted himself to the making of canals.

===Canals===
The Bridgewater Canal from Worsley to Manchester which he constructed to transport coal obtained on his estates is usually cited as the first modern British canal as opposed to a river navigation—although the Sankey Canal is a rival to this claim, projected as a &quot;navigation&quot;, but built as a true canal. The construction of Bridgewater&#x27;s canal, with its aqueduct across the River Irwell, was carried out by James Brindley, the celebrated engineer.

The completion of his first canal led the duke to undertake a more ambitious work. In 1762 he obtained parliamentary powers to provide an improved waterway between Liverpool and Manchester by means of a canal. The difficulties encountered in its execution were still more formidable than those of the Worsley canal, involving carrying it across Sale Moor Moss. But the genius of John Gilbert, his agent and Brindley, his engineer, proved superior to all obstacles although at one period the duke&#x27;s financial resources were almost exhausted, the work was carried to a triumphant conclusion.

Both canals were completed by the time Bridgewater was thirty-six years of age, and the remainder of his life was spent in extending them and in improving his estates. During the latter years of his life he derived a princely income from the success of his enterprise. Although a supporter of Pitt&#x27;s administration, he took no prominent part in politics.

===Wealth===

The duke accumulated great wealth through his canal and coal interests. His annual income was said to have exceeded £80,000. The family owned other estates: Belton House, a small Sussex estate and the Old House and, 6,000 acres (24 km2) at Ashridge. On leaving his Brackley and Worsley estates, the duke had an annual income in taxes and duties of £75,000 (estimated in 1997 as £2,360,000). The father of the first duke had bought Cleveland House in St James, London, which was rebuilt to the designs of Sir Charles Barry in 1840 and renamed Bridgewater House in 1854 for Lord Ellesmere, heir of the 3rd Duke.

With the Bridgewater fortune exceeding £2,000,000, the duke, the richest nobleman in England, set about rebuilding Ashridge. He began to pull the old buildings down, but he died before his plans could be completed, leaving his heir with nothing but rubble. He was the leading member of the syndicate which purchased and partly resold the famous Orleans Collection, from the banker Jeremiah Harman in 1789.

He acquired an art collection valued at £150,000 (estimated in 1997 about £4.75 million). In 1798 he purchased en bloc sixty-four Italian and French paintings including Raphael, Titian, Annibale Carracci and Nicolas Poussin. Notable were several old master paintings including &quot;Diana and Actaeon&quot; and &quot;Diana and Callisto&quot;. It was inherited by his heir, 1st Duke of Sutherland. Most of his purchases are still held by the Egerton family.

==Legacy and memorials==
The duke died unmarried on 8 March 1803, and the ducal title became extinct although the Earldom of Bridgewater passed to a cousin, Lieutenant-General John Egerton, who became 7th Earl). The 3rd Duke of Bridgewater was buried in the Egerton family vault in the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Little Gaddesden, close to Ashridge.

By his will the duke devised his canals and estates on trust, under which his nephew, the 2nd Marquess of Stafford (afterwards 1st Duke of Sutherland), became the first beneficiary, and next his son Lord Francis Leveson-Gower (afterwards 1st Earl of Ellesmere) and his issue. In order that the trust should last as long as possible, an extraordinary use was made of the legal rule that property may be settled for the duration of lives in being and twenty-one years after. The legatees were a great number of persons connected with the duke and their living issue, plus all peers who had taken their seats in the House of Lords on or before the duke&#x27;s decease. The last of the peers died in 1857, but one of the commoners survived till 19 October 1883, and so the trust did not expire until 19 October 1903, when the whole property passed to the undivided control of Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere. The canals had by then been transferred to the Bridgewater Navigation Company in 1872, by whom they were sold in 1887 to the Manchester Ship Canal Company.

The duke is commemorated in a number of locations around Britain. A marble wall monument in Little Gaddesden Church is dedicated to his memory, and on the nearby Ashridge Estate, the Bridgewater Monument was erected in 1832 &#x27;in honour of Francis, Third duke of Bridgewater, &quot;Father of Inland Navigation&quot;&#x27;. The Bridgewater Canal in North West England, still in existence today, bears the Duke&#x27;s name.

In the 1830s, the possibility was discussed of raising a memorial to the Canal Duke in Manchester, but at the time public statuary was relatively unknown outside London. Illustrations exist of unrealised 1836 proposal by William Fairbairn to build a &quot;Bridgewater Crescent&quot; at the eastern end of Piccadilly in Manchester, to be adorned with a statue of the Duke of Bridgewater. To date, no statue has been erected in Manchester to commemorate the Canal Duke.

A 1788 portrait drawing of the Duke of Bridgewater by William Marshall Craig was engraved by Edward Scriven in 1835; prints are held in the National Portrait Gallery, London and the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh. Two Wax medallion portraits of the Duke by Peter Rouw dating from 1803 are held at the National Portrait Gallery and at Tatton Hall in Cheshire.

Francis Egerton is depicted in one of &quot;The Manchester Murals&quot; painted by Ford Madox Brown between 1879 and 1893. &quot;The Opening of the Bridgewater Canal A.D. 1761&quot; shows the Duke of Bridgewater standing on a barge decorated with flags of his coat of arms, alongside engineer James Brindley, observing the launch of the first coal barges on his new canal.

In 1905, Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere erected a fountain in Worsley Green, Salford, in memory of the Duke of Bridgewater, after a former factory built by the duke there was demolished. In 1996, a new concert hall named after the duke was opened in Manchester, the Bridgewater Hall — although the hall is actually situated next to the adjoining Rochdale Canal.

==Ancestry==

Scroop, 1st Duke of Bridgewater (1681–1745), the son of the 2nd Earl of Bridgewater, was created a duke in 1720. He was the great-grandson of John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater (. 1617; . 1649), whose name is associated with the production of Milton&#x27;s &quot;Comus&quot; and the latter was the son of Sir Thomas Egerton (1540–1617), Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Lord Keeper and James I&#x27;s Lord Chancellor, who was created Baron Ellesmere in 1603 and Viscount Brackley in 1616.

<doc id="899194" wikidata="Q3414986" url="?curid=899194" title="R v Morgentaler">
<text>R v Morgentaler, [1988] 1 SCR 30 was a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada which held that the abortion provision in the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; was unconstitutional because it violated women&#x27;s rights under section 7 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; (&quot;Charter&quot;) to security of the person. Since this ruling, there have been no criminal laws regulating abortion in Canada.

== Background ==
Prior to this ruling, section 251(4) of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, allowed for abortions to be performed solely at accredited hospitals with the proper certification of approval from the hospital&#x27;s Therapeutic Abortion Committee.

Three doctors, Henry Morgentaler, Leslie Frank Smoling and Robert Scott, set up an abortion clinic in Toronto for the purpose of performing abortions on women who had not received certification from the Therapeutic Abortion Committee, as required under subsection 251(4) of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. By doing so, they were attempting to bring public attention to their cause, claiming a woman should have complete control over the decision on whether to have an abortion.

Morgentaler had previously challenged the abortion law at the Supreme Court in the pre-&quot;Charter&quot; case of &quot;Morgentaler v R&quot;, in which the court denied having the judicial authority to strike down the law.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario found in favour of the government. On appeal, the main issue put before the court was whether section 251 violated section 7 of the &quot;Charter&quot;. A secondary issue put to the court was whether the creation of anti-abortion law was &quot;ultra vires&quot; (&quot;outside the power&quot;) of the federal government&#x27;s authority to create law.

== Ruling ==
The court ruled five to two that the law violated section 7 and could not be saved under section 1. Morgentaler&#x27;s previous acquittal was restored.

There were three different opinions given by the five judges in the majority on the main issue. They agreed that the appeal should be allowed and the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; provision was unconstitutional. However, there was no majority decision on the reasons for that outcome, so there was not a clear precedent on the legal basis for the decision.

On the issue of jury nullification, the Court unanimously held that defence counsel&#x27;s argument at trial, asking the jury not to apply the law, was improper. On that point, there was a clear legal precedent.

=== Dickson ===
Perhaps the most prominent opinion in the majority was that of Chief Justice Brian Dickson, with Justice Antonio Lamer concurring. Dickson began by examining section 7. He found that section 251 forced some women to carry a fetus irrespective of her own &quot;priorities and aspirations&quot;. This was a clear infringement of security of person. He found a further violation due to the delay created by the mandatory certification procedure which put the women at higher risk of physical harm and caused harm to their psychological integrity.

In his section 7 analysis, Dickson examined whether the violation accorded with the principles of fundamental justice. He found that it did not because the excessive requirements prevented smaller hospitals from providing such services thus preventing many women from even applying for certification. Moreover, he found that the administrative system failed to provide adequate evaluation criteria which allowed the committees to grant or deny therapeutic abortions arbitrarily.

Dickson found that the violation could not be justified under section 1, focusing on the means chosen by the government to achieve its objectives. In the end, the law failed on every step of the proportionality test. First, he found the administrative process was often unfair and arbitrary. Second, the resultant impairment of the women&#x27;s rights was beyond what was necessary to evaluate their case. Third, the effect of the impairment far outweighed the importance of the law&#x27;s objective.

=== Beetz ===
Justice Jean Beetz, joined by Justice Willard Estey, wrote a second opinion finding the abortion law invalid. In it, Beetz noted that by adopting section 251(4), the government acknowledged that the interest of the state to protect the woman is greater than its interest to protect the fetus when &quot;the continuation of the pregnancy of such female person would or would be likely to endanger her life or health&quot;. Beetz&#x27;s reasoning closely resembled that of the Chief Justice. He found a violation of section 7 as the procedural requirements of section 251 were &quot;manifestly unfair&quot;.

Beetz&#x27;s reasoning in the section 1 analysis was also similar to that of Dickson. He found that the objective had no rational connection to the means, meaning the law could not be justified. He also speculated that if the government were to enact a new abortion law, this law would require a higher degree of danger to the woman in the later months rather than the early months for an abortion to be allowed. In this case, it could be sufficiently justifiable under section 1.

In examining whether the law was &quot;ultra vires&quot;, Beetz examined sections 91 and 96 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. He decided that the law was within the power of the federal government on account that the committee was not given any power over any provincial jurisdiction under section 91 nor did it function in any sort of judicial manner under section 96.

=== Wilson ===
Justice Bertha Wilson wrote her own concurring opinion taking a significantly different approach. She held that section 251 violates two rights: liberty and security of person. She emphasized how section 251 violated a woman&#x27;s personal autonomy by preventing her from making decisions affecting her and her fetus&#x27; life. To Wilson, a woman&#x27;s decision to abort her fetus is one that is so profound on so many levels it goes beyond being a medical decision and becomes a social and ethical one as well. By removing the women&#x27;s ability to make the decision and giving it to a committee would be a clear violation of their liberty and security of person. Wilson scathingly noted the state is effectively taking control of a woman&#x27;s capacity to reproduce.

Wilson went on to agree with the other judges that section 251 (prohibiting the performance of an abortion except under certain circumstances) is procedurally unfair, adding that the violation of section 7 also has the effect of violating section 2(a) of the &quot;Charter&quot; (freedom of conscience) in that the requirements for a woman to be permitted to obtain an abortion legally (or for a doctor to legally perform one) were in many cases so onerous or effectively impossible that they were &quot;resulting in a failure to comply with the principles of fundamental justice&quot;. The decision to abort is primarily a moral one, she noted, and therefore by preventing her from doing so, the decision violates a woman&#x27;s right to conscientiously-held beliefs. With the abortion law, the government was supporting one conscientiously-held belief at the expense of another, and in effect, was treating women as a means to an end and depriving them of their &quot;essential humanity&quot;.

Wilson also stated that

In her analysis of section 1, Wilson noted the value placed on the fetus is proportional to its stage of gestation and the legislation must take that into account. However, here, the law cannot be justified because it takes the decision-making power away from the woman absolutely and therefore cannot pass the proportionality test.

==Dissent==
A dissent was written by Justice William McIntyre, with Justice Gérard La Forest concurring. McIntyre found that there was no right to an abortion under section 7 nor under other laws. His argument was based on the role of judicial review and how the courts must not go about creating rights not explicitly found in the &quot;Charter&quot; nor interpret &quot;Charter&quot; rights to protect interests that the rights were not initially intending to protect. He said that nowhere in any constitutional texts, history or philosophies is there support for any such rights. Furthermore, there is no societal consensus that these interests should be protected either.

Even if a right could be found, said McIntyre, the case would not have been sufficient to prove a violation. The provisions of section 251(4) cannot be said to be &quot;manifestly unfair&quot; on the basis that some women do not have access. The problems with administrative procedure are external to the legislation and cannot be the basis of a violation.

==Aftermath==
When the decision was announced, it was sometimes reported to be more broad than it was; the decision did not declare a constitutional right to abortion nor &quot;freedom of choice&quot;.

The Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made two attempts to pass a new abortion law. The first proposal, in the spring of 1988, did not pass the House of Commons. The second attempt, introduced by the Minister of Justice as Bill C-43 in late 1989, would be defeated on a tie vote by the time it came to third reading in Senate on January 31, 1991, leaving Canada without criminal legislation governing abortion.

, Parliament had not acted to replace the abortion law, meaning Canada does not criminalize abortion. Provinces have taken action to restrict access to abortion in various ways that do not involve criminal law.

The case has often since been compared to the American decision &quot;Roe v Wade&quot;. However, &quot;Morgentaler&quot; is actually much closer in terms of the issues to the decision (also in 1973) of the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Doe v Bolton&quot; 410 U.S. 179, than to those in &quot;Roe&quot;.

At the 25th anniversary of the decision in early 2013, and upon Morgentaler&#x27;s death three months later, the extent and nature of &quot;Morgentaler&quot; was discussed in the media.

<text>Guardian (James Jacob &quot;Jim&quot; Harper and Mal Duncan) are DC Comics superheroes introduced in April 1942 by writer/artist Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby.

Guardian resembles the earlier Kirby and Simon character Captain America (first published 13 months earlier by Marvel Comics), as he had no super powers and carried an indestructible shield. When Kirby returned to DC in 1970, he eventually re-established the character as a supporting one in the &quot;Superman&quot; franchise: as a clone of Jim Harper who was head of security for Project Cadmus.

In the Arrowverse series &quot;Supergirl&quot;, [[Guardian (DC Comics)|James Olsen]], portrayed by Mehcad Brooks, became the superhero Guardian. Additionally, James Harper appeared in the first season as a marine colonel portrayed by Eddie McClintock. In the sixth season, Olsen’s sister Kelly Olsen (portrayed by Azie Tesfai) became known as the Golden Guardian.

== Publication history ==
He first appeared in &quot;Star-Spangled Comics&quot; #7 (April 1942) and was created by Jack Kirby and Joe Simon.

==Fictional character biography==
===Jim Harper===

Jim Harper is a police officer in Metropolis&#x27; Suicide Slum who becomes a vigilante to catch crooks that the law could not prosecute, describing himself as guarding society from criminals. He was trained by ex-boxer Joe Morgan, who also trained Wildcat and Atom. He doesn&#x27;t have superpowers, but he carries a bulletproof shield.

He is aided by a group of boys known as the Newsboy Legion, to whom he is, literally, a guardian, having volunteered to take them in rather than allowing them to be sent to prison; he does so on the grounds that they are good kids who just needed a chance. The Legion grows up to become the heads of the Cadmus Project, subsequently saving Harper&#x27;s life by transferring his mind into a younger clone of himself.

It is later revealed that Jim Harper is the great-uncle of Roy Harper, who becomes Green Arrow&#x27;s sidekick under the name of &quot;Speedy&quot;.

Other relatives include his niece Roberta &quot;Famous Bobby&quot; Harper, who is briefly a member of the second Newsboy Legion and Jamie Harper, his grandniece working for the Gotham City police. She works as Robin&#x27;s personal contact in the GCPD, similar to the role Commissioner James Gordon plays for Batman. After helping Robin and Jason Bard expose two dirty cops in the GCPD, Jamie becomes Detective Specialist and transfers to the Metropolis Science Police.

===Golden Guardian===
In &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen #135&quot; (January 1971), Jack Kirby reintroduces the boys of the now grown-up Newsboy Legion as supporting characters connected with the DNA Project (later Project Cadmus), a genetics research laboratory. One of the Project&#x27;s experiments is a clone of the late Jim Harper, who takes up his predecessor&#x27;s role, and becomes the Project&#x27;s Head of Security as the Golden Guardian. Post-Crisis this character is simply known as the Guardian.

Harper remains Cadmus&#x27; Head of Security even after the former Newsboys leave. Eventually, he too is killed, although another clone is created and rapidly aged to adulthood, retaining all his predecessor&#x27;s memories. This Guardian disappears along with the rest of Cadmus following an altercation with Amanda Waller and President Luthor, and his whereabouts are unknown.

==== Post-Infinite Crisis ====
Following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the Guardian clone&#x27;s backstory was retconned. As Dubbilex explains to Jimmy Olsen, Jim Harper was not killed in the line of duty, but shot by Cadmus&#x27; first head of security, , upon discovering the clone was already being created.

It is also revealed that the original Guardian clone had left Cadmus early on, and was now living in the town of Warpath on the Mexican border, where he assisted Greg Saunders. Subsequent appearances of the Guardian were new clones, each of which died within a year.

The original Guardian clone has decided to move to Metropolis with Gwen, his adopted daughter (in fact, an adolescent female clone of himself that he rescued), during the storyline.

Science Police team leaders DuBarry and Daniels, along with several prison guards, are killed during the events of when a team of Kandorians led by Commander Gor assault Stryker&#x27;s Island and demand custody of Parasite. The Science Police Control &#x27;Rachel&#x27; tasks Guardian to act as a liaison between the Metropolis Police Department and a coalition of superheroes in bringing justice for the fallen science police officers and prison guards. After the Kandorians leave Earth, Guardian is appointed Field Commander of the Science Police, as replacement for DuBarry and Daniels, due in part to his cloned memories of Jim Harper as a police officer and Guardian as a superhero. He is asked by Superman to help Mon-El, offering him a job with the Science Police and mentoring him on how to be a hero.

The issues of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; published during the &quot;One Year Later&quot; event reveals that Harper has a grandniece, Jamie, formerly a detective of Gotham City Police Department and an associate of Robin III.

The Guardian later travels to the JLA Watchtower to warn the Justice League after finding a teleportation device in Metropolis. While on the Watchtower, the heroes are attacked by Prometheus, who blinds the Guardian. In the aftermath of the attack, Guardian and Mon-El are recruited by Kimiyo Hoshi to join the Justice League. On his first and only mission with the team, the Guardian helps battle Doctor Impossible&#x27;s gang of villains. After a mere three issues, the Guardian was written out of the book due to writer James Robinson&#x27;s desire to work with a smaller cast.

Following the events of &quot;War of the Supermen&quot;, Harper abandons his role as the Guardian and takes Jamie (now pregnant with Mon-El&#x27;s child) off to an unknown destination.

===Mal Duncan===

In &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #44 (November 1976), Mal Duncan becomes Guardian, wearing the original&#x27;s outfit and an exoskeleton with strength augmenting abilities. The two Guardians finally meet in &quot;Superman Family&quot; #s 191-193 (Sept 78-Feb 79), when Mal helps rescue the Harper clone from Adam, an evil clone created using genetic material from both Harper and Dubbilex who have taken control of the DNA Project.

The &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; removes Duncan&#x27;s career as Guardian.

===Jake Jordan===

In 2005, Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Seven Soldiers&quot; megaseries introduced a new character based on the original Guardian, Manhattan Guardian.

==Powers and abilities==
The Guardian possesses exceptional combat and tactical skills. He was trained in many forms of fighting, and excelled at gymnastics, thinking quickly on his feet, and deduction. His only weapons are his golden helmet and shield. Guardian often used a customized motorcycle equipped with autopilot and a set of video cameras filming from various angles and recorded on videodisc.

The Harper clone possesses enhanced strength and reflexes, and an accelerated healing factor. The Harper clone&#x27;s exact strength level is unknown but has demonstrated the ability to hurt Superboy (who he trained in hand-to-hand combat) and Kryptonians from Kandor. As an agent of Cadmus, Jim Harper also has access to the wondrous Whiz Wagon. The Hairies (a super-advanced tribe of techno-wizards, originally genetic creations of Donovan, who left Cadmus) built the Whiz Wagon to handle every situation. It can adapt to every terrain, fly, and even go underwater. The Wagon can be remote controlled or pre-programmed and is equipped with a set of powerful weapons and various gadgets.

==Other versions==
* In the Frank Miller graphic novel &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot;, the Guardian is one of the superheroes killed by Dick Grayson. It is implied that he had a daughter with Lois Lane named Lana Harper-Lane, a television reporter.
* The Guardian&#x27;s golden shield survives to the alternative future of the 853rd century; it is kept by that timeline&#x27;s Batman.
* A bearded version of Guardian exists on the post-Flashpoint Earth-23 as a member of a predominantly African American Justice League.
* The Guardian makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the final issue of &quot;The Golden Age&quot;. He is one of many heroes who tries and fails to fight the villainous Dynaman.

==In other media==
===Television===
====Animation====

The Jim Harper and Mal Duncan incarnations of Guardian appear in &quot;Young Justice&quot;.
* Jim Harper (voiced by Crispin Freeman) is a clone of Roy Harper created by the Light to serve their needs. Through programming and hypnosis, Jim operates as a superhero who believes he is Roy&#x27;s uncle while also working for Project Cadmus. After learning of his true nature, Jim spends the second season searching for Roy and taking part in an intervention for fellow clone, Red Arrow, before retiring the Guardian identity. In the third season, &quot;Outsiders&quot;, Jim forms a familial relationship with Red Arrow and Roy.
* Mal Duncan (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson), a member of the Team, becomes the Guardian in the second season episode &quot;Cornered&quot; and continues to use the identity for the rest of the season.

====Live-action====

Several incarnations of Guardian appear in media set in the Arrowverse:
* James Harper appears in the &quot;Supergirl&quot; episode &quot;Manhunter&quot;, portrayed by Eddie McClintock. This version is a colonel in the United States Marine Corps.
* With Winn Schott&#x27;s help, James Olsen (portrayed by Mehcad Brooks) became Guardian in the second and third seasons of &quot;Supergirl&quot;.
** An alternate reality variant of James Olsen / Guardian appears in &quot;Crisis on Earth-X&quot;. This version is a member of the Freedom Fighters from Earth-X who wears a costume patterned after the American flag. He is tasked with protecting a temporal gateway from the New Reichsmen, but is killed by Nazi Führer Oliver Queen.
* In the sixth season of &quot;Supergirl&quot;, James&#x27; sister Kelly (portrayed by Azie Tesfu) becomes the new Guardian.

===Film===
A character inspired by Guardian named Nathan Hardy appears in &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, portrayed by Christopher Meloni. He is a member of the United States Air Force who goes by the call sign &quot;Guardian&quot;.

===Miscellaneous===
The Mal Duncan incarnation of Guardian makes non-speaking appearances in &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot; as a student of Super Hero High.

<doc id="899197" wikidata="Q1104016" url="?curid=899197" title="Coarray Fortran">
<text>Coarray Fortran (CAF), formerly known as F--, started as an extension of Fortran 95/2003 for parallel processing created by Robert Numrich and John Reid in the 1990s. The Fortran 2008 standard (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010) now includes coarrays (spelled without hyphen), as decided at the May 2005 meeting of the ISO Fortran Committee; the syntax in the Fortran 2008 standard is slightly different from the original CAF proposal.

A CAF program is interpreted as if it were replicated a number of times and all copies were executed asynchronously. Each copy has its own set of data objects and is termed an &quot;image&quot;. The array syntax of Fortran is extended with additional trailing subscripts in square brackets to provide a concise representation of references to data that is spread across images.

The CAF extension was implemented in some Fortran compilers such as those from Cray (since release 3.1). Since the inclusion of coarrays in the Fortran 2008 standard, the number of implementations is growing. The first open-source compiler which implemented coarrays as specified in the Fortran 2008 standard for Linux architectures is G95. Currently, GNU Fortran provides wide coverage of Fortran&#x27;s coarray features in single- and multi-image configuration (the latter based on the OpenCoarrays library). Another implementation of coarrays and related parallel extensions from Fortran 2008 is available in the OpenUH compiler (a branch of Open64) developed at the University of Houston.

==Implementation in compilers==
CAF is often implemented on top of a Message Passing Interface (MPI) library for portability. Some implementations, such as the ones available in the GNU Fortran and OpenUH compilers, may run on top of other low-level layers (for example, GASNet) designed for supporting partitioned global address space languages.

==Examples==
A simple example is given below. CAF is used in CGPACK, an open source package for simulating polycrystalline materials developed at the University of Bristol.
program Hello_World
 implicit none
 integer :: i ! Local variable
 character(len=20) :: name[*] ! scalar coarray, one &quot;name&quot; for each image.
 ! Note: &quot;name&quot; is the local variable while &quot;name[&lt;index&gt;]&quot; accesses the
 ! variable in a specific image; &quot;name[this_image()]&quot; is the same as &quot;name&quot;.

 ! Interact with the user on Image 1; execution for all others pass by.
 if (this_image() == 1) then 
 write(*,&#x27;(a)&#x27;,advance=&#x27;no&#x27;) &#x27;Enter your name: &#x27;
 read(*,&#x27;(a)&#x27;) name

 ! Distribute information to other images
 do i = 2, num_images()
 name[i] = name
 end do
 end if

 sync all ! Barrier to make sure the data have arrived.

 ! I/O from all images, executing in any order, but each record written is intact. 
 write(*,&#x27;(3a,i0)&#x27;) &#x27;Hello &#x27;,trim(name),&#x27; from image &#x27;, this_image()
end program Hello_world
The program above scales poorly because the loop that distributes information executes sequentially. Writing scalable programs often requires a sophisticated understanding of parallel algorithms, a detailed knowledge of the underlying network characteristics, and special tuning for application characteristics such as the size of data transfers. For most application developers, letting the compiler or runtime library decide the best algorithm proves more robust and high-performing. Fortran 2018 will offer collective communication subroutines that empower compiler and runtime library teams to encapsulate efficient parallel algorithms for collective communication and distributed computation in a set of collective subroutines. These subroutines and other new parallel programming features are summarized in a technical specification that the Fortran standards committee has voted to incorporate into Fortran 2018. These enable the user to write a more efficient version of the above algorithm
program Hello_World
 implicit none
 character(len=20) :: name[*] ! scalar coarray, one &quot;name&quot; for each image.
 ! Note: &quot;name&quot; is the local variable while &quot;name[&lt;index&gt;]&quot; accesses the
 ! variable in a specific image; &quot;name[this_image()]&quot; is the same as &quot;name&quot;.

 ! Interact with the user on Image 1; execution for all others pass by.
 if (this_image() == 1) then 
 write(*,&#x27;(a)&#x27;,advance=&#x27;no&#x27;) &#x27;Enter your name: &#x27;
 read(*,&#x27;(a)&#x27;) name
 end if
 ! Distribute information to all images
 call co_broadcast(name,source_image=1)

 ! I/O from all images, executing in any order, but each record written is intact. 
 write(*,&#x27;(3a,i0)&#x27;) &#x27;Hello &#x27;,trim(name),&#x27; from image &#x27;, this_image()
end program Hello_world
where the lack of explicit synchronization offers the potential for higher performance due to less coordination between the images. Furthermore, TS 18508 guarantees that &quot;A transfer from an image cannot occur before the collective subroutine has been invoked on that image.&quot; This implies some partial synchronization inside co_broadcast, but could be higher performing than the &quot;sync all&quot; in the prior example. TS 18508 also incorporates several other new features that address issues targeted by the CAF 2.0 effort described below. Examples include teams of images and events.

==An alternate perspective==
In 2011, Rice University pursued an alternate vision of coarray extensions for the Fortran language. Their perspective is that the Fortran 2008 standard committee&#x27;s design choices were shaped more by the desire to introduce as few modifications to the language as possible than to assemble the best set of extensions to support parallel programming. In their view, both Numrich and Reid&#x27;s original design and the coarray extensions proposed for Fortran 2008 suffer from the following shortcomings:

* There is no support for processor subsets; for instance, coarrays must be allocated over all images.
* The coarray extensions lack any notion of global pointers, which are essential for creating and manipulating any kind of linked data structure.
* Reliance on named critical sections for mutual exclusion hinders scalable parallelism by associating mutual exclusion with code regions rather than data objects.
* Fortran 2008&#x27;s sync images statement does not provide a safe synchronization space. As a result, synchronization operations in user&#x27;s code that are pending when a library call is made can interfere with synchronization in the library call.
* There are no mechanisms to avoid or tolerate latency when manipulating data on remote images.
* There is no support for collective communication.

To address these shortcomings, the Rice University group is developing a clean-slate redesign of the Coarray Fortran programming model. Rice&#x27;s new design for Coarray Fortran, which they call Coarray Fortran 2.0, is an expressive set of coarray-based extensions to Fortran designed to provide a productive parallel programming model. Compared to Fortran 2008, Rice&#x27;s new coarray-based language extensions include some additional features:

* process subsets known as teams, which support coarrays, collective communication, and relative indexing of process images for pair-wise operations,
* topologies, which augment teams with a logical communication structure,
* dynamic allocation/deallocation of coarrays and other shared data,
* team-based coarray allocation and deallocation,
* global pointers in support of dynamic data structures,
* support for latency hiding and avoidance, and
** asynchronous copies,
** asynchronous collective operations, and
** function shipping.
* enhanced support for synchronization for fine-grain control over program execution.
** safe and scalable support for mutual exclusion, including locks and lock sets,
** events, which provide a safe space for point-to-point synchronization,
** , which forces local completion of asynchronous operations,
** finish, a barrier-like SPMD construct that forces completion of asynchronous operations across a team,

<text>Umar Gul (Urdu: , ) (born 15 October 1982) is a Pakistani cricket coach and former cricketer who is the current bowling consultant of Peshawar Zalmi and interim bowling coach of the Pakistan national cricket team. Gul was a member of the Pakistan team that won the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, being the highest wicket taker of the tournament, along with being the runner-up of the 2007 tournament, in which he was also the highest wicket taker.

He played all three formats of the game as a right arm fast medium bowler for the Pakistani cricket team.

Umar Gul was the second-highest wicket-taker in Twenty20 International cricket, with 74 dismissals, behind Saeed Ajmal. He won the Twenty20 International Performance of the Year 2013.

On 16 October 2020, after the final group-stage match of the 2020–21 National T20 Cup, Gul retired from all forms of cricket following a career that spanned twenty years.

== Personal life ==
Gul was born on 15 October 1982 in Peshawar, Pakistan in a middle-class family and frequently played tape ball cricket. He was encouraged by his friends to become an international cricketer as they saw his excellent bowling.

In October 2010, Gul married to a Dubai-based doctor. His daughter, Rehab Umar, was born in May 2012. In the same month, Pakistan Army Commandos mistakenly raided Umar Gul&#x27;s house in Peshawar and arrested his brother Meeraj Gul on the charge of hiding a wanted militant. However, the commandos later on apologized to Meeraj. Gul has two daughters and one son.

His nephew is cricketer Abbas Afridi.

==Domestic career==
In February 2008, Gul signed with the Indian Premier League and was drafted by Shahrukh Khan&#x27;s Kolkata Knight Riders franchise for US$150,000. He played in six matches, taking 12 wickets at an average of 15.33, including a player of the match award in Kolkata&#x27;s final game in which Gul took 4–23 and scored 24 runs from 11 balls.

In December 2008, Gul signed with the Western Warriors to compete in the Australian domestic 2008–09 KFC Twenty20 Big Bash tournament. He performed very well in his debut match for the Warriors, taking 4 wickets for 15 runs in a losing side. He was among the most successful bowlers in the competition. Despite not being available for the entire tournament, he finished second top wicket-taker with 12 wickets.

In July 2014, he played for the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord&#x27;s.

Gul had signed a one-year contract with Gloucestershire to play in 2007, but the Pakistan Cricket Board failed to give them their permission.

In April 2018, he was named in Baluchistan&#x27;s squad for the 2018 Pakistan Cup. In March 2019, he was named as the captain of Sindh&#x27;s squad for the 2019 Pakistan Cup. In September 2019, he was named in the Balochistan squad for the 2019–20 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy tournament.

==International career==
===Early years===
Gul was first called up for the team in April 2003, playing four one-day matches at the Cherry Blossom Sharjah Cup against Zimbabwe, Kenya and Sri Lanka, where he took four wickets, and he was in and out of the one-day team after that tournament. However, he played the whole of the 2003 home series against Bangladesh, making his Test debut and taking 15 wickets in the three Tests, and took the second-most wickets of any Pakistani bowler in the series, behind Shabbir Ahmed with 17. However, Shoaib Akhtar, who took 13 in third place, only played two of the Tests.

Gul was retained for the ODIs against Bangladesh, taking a List A best five for 17 in nine overs in the third match, and ended with 11 wickets in the 5–0 series win. However, he could still not command a regular spot, playing three of Pakistan&#x27;s nine next ODIs before finally getting dropped after one for 36 against New Zealand.

===Test cricket===
He was recalled and played two Tests after that taking four wickets in a drawn Test against New Zealand before coming in as replacement for Shabbir Ahmed in the second Test of the three-Test series against India. After coming on as first-change bowler, Gul dismissed Virender Sehwag in his second over, and then bowled unchanged for 12 overs either side of lunch to take five Indian top order wickets – including Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, who both had Test batting averages above 50, as did Sehwag. Gul finished with five for 31 in his spell, earning him commendation from ESPNcricinfo journalist Dileep Premachandran, who praised his &quot;control of line and length&quot;, and he was also named Man of the Match despite conceding runs at five an over in the second innings in a nine-wicket win.

After a length injury lay-off, which kept him out of international cricket for nearly two years, Gul returned to the Pakistan fold in 2006. Firstly with quiet away series against Sri Lanka then followed by a tour to England in 2006. Gul was quickly made the lead bowler in the side due to the injuries to other front line bowlers. Gul to 18 wickets in four tests, justifying the selectors faith in him.

Later in 2006, against West Indies at home, Gul had perhaps his most successful test series. He took 16 wickets in 3 tests, including notable spells of reverse swing bowling. He was responsible for breaking Ramnaresh Sarwan&#x27;s toe with a dipping yorker.

In February 2009, Gul recorded his best test figures in the Pakistan team, taking 6 for 135 on a flat pitch. In July 2010, Pakistan faced England at Trent Bridge and were 147/9 in their first innings. Gul scored 30* before the day was called off due to bad light. He returned the next day with Mohammad Asif and batted with intent to add another 35 runs in five overs. This saw Pakistan avoid the follow-on against England and therefore survive an innings defeat.

Gul then suffered a hamstring injury in the second test when he was touring England in 2010 he was ruled out for three weeks that meant he would miss the remaining two tests. However Gul managed to recover and became fit enough to play in the fourth test However they decided to rest Gul for the final test match despite the fact that he had recovered quicker than expected.

His next chance to play test cricket came against South Africa in November 2010 when he took 3 wickets in a first innings and triggered a South African collapse of 380 on a flat wicket. He took the crucial wicket with an excellent inswinger against AB de Villiers.

=== Twenty20 Internationals===
With injuries limiting Gul&#x27;s test cricket participation, he made a distinct change to his bowling set-up, making a focus on bowling in the late overs of T20. He got his opportunity with the absence of Shoaib Akhtar and Abdul Razzaq in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 held in South Africa. He bowled from the 13th over onwards and finished the tournament with 13 wickets, becoming the leading wicket taker ahead of Shahid Afridi and RP Singh.
In the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, he performed well, earning the mantle from at least one pundit of &quot;the outstanding seam bowler of the World Twenty20&quot;. His five-wicket haul for just six runs, when Pakistan defeated New Zealand, won especial acclaim. The spell made him the first bowler in history to take a five wickets in a Twenty20 international, and he held the record of best T20 bowling figure until 8 August 2011, when surpassed by Ajantha Mendis (6/16). Mutterings were made about a possible correlation between ball tampering and the exorbitant amounts of reverse swing he was able to extract, but he denied them categorically: &quot;whenever an Asian bowler performs and uses the reverse-swing, the Western cricketing countries raise the issue of ball-tampering against them.&quot; The spell was voted as the best T20I bowling performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo. He was named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo for the 2009 T20I World Cup.

His spell was of 4 for 8 against Australia at Dubai was also nominated to be one of the Best T20I Bowling Performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo.

He was also part of the Pakistan team that lifted the trophy at Lord&#x27;s while also finishing as the leading wicket taker of the tournament for the second consecutive time. He gained a lot of wickets bowled, in particular with late reverse swinging yorkers, which dip late to slide under the bat and leave little room for batsmen to maneuver the ball. Consequently, he has also an excellent economy rate in this format of the game.

Internationally, Gul has taken 47 wickets in 32 games at an average of 14.65. He is the second leading wicket-taker in Twenty20 Internationals behind teammate Shahid Afridi.

=== One Day Internationals ===
Gul appeared in all three of Pakistan&#x27;s group matches in the 2007 World Cup taking four wickets with an economy rate of 3.13, only Shane Bond of those to deliver 100 balls was more economical. He also appeared in all of Pakistan&#x27;s matches at the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 taking 3/15 off 4 overs in the semi-final victory over New Zealand. He took three wickets in the final to finish as the tournament&#x27;s leading wicket-taker.

For his performances in 2009 and 2011, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC. His spell of 6 for 42 against England at The Oval in 2010 was voted as the best ODI bowling performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo.

In January 2016, Gul was suspended from international cricket for a doping offense. Gul was recalled into the ODI squad on 9 August 2016 for the England and Ireland tour.

===Injuries===
However, Gul was then ruled out of the third Test with a back injury which kept him out of cricket for an entire year. He returned to play two games at the 2004–05 Faysal Bank T20 Cup, and played some matches for Pakistan A and a Pakistan XI in warm-up games before the Test matches against England the following season, but he was not selected for the matches and has instead played three matches with Peshawar at the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy.

Shortly after making a six-month come-back from a shoulder injury in July 2010 Gul picked up a hamstring injury against England in August but it wasn&#x27;t too serious and he only missed the two Test matches.

== Batting-skills ==
Despite being a bowler, Gul can perform well as a lower order batsman and has proved his ability as a quick.run-picker His finest moment with the bat came in a test match against England in August 2010 when Pakistan were at 103/7 and Gul came into bat at 8. He scored 29 off 30 deliveries, and when play ended that day, two more wickets had fallen and the team were at 148/9. Pakistan needed 11 more runs to avoid the follow-on, and Gul then came in with his number 10 partner Mohammad Asif. Gul scored 34 runs in just 11 deliveries however his partner Mohammad Asif was run out at the other end and Gul ended on 65 not out.

== Coaching career ==
In April 2022, Gul was appointed as bowling consultant by the Afghanistan national cricket team for a training camp which lasted 15 days. In May 2022, he was given a permanent contract as the bowling coach of Afghanistan with his contract lasting until the end of 2022. On 15 March 2023, Gul was appointed the interim bowling coach of the Pakistani cricket team for the Afghanistan series.

<text>Vusimuzi &quot;Vusi&quot; Sibanda (born 10 October 1983) is a Zimbabwean cricketer. He has played international cricket for the Zimbabwe in all three formats of the game. He also played for Midlands in the Logan Cup.

==Early career==
Sibanda is a right-handed opening batsman who showed potential as a teenager, graduating from the Zimbabwe Cricket Academy and being fast-tracked into the national team.

He grew up in Highfields, Harare, was spotted early on by developmental coaches, and earned a scholarship to Churchill Boys High. He plays domestic cricket for Mid West Rhinos.

==International career==
He made his One Day International (ODI) debut in 2003 against the West Indies and made 58. Sibanda however struggled at international level from there on in, not scoring another half century for 18 innings, making at one stage 3 consecutive ducks.

In May 2005 his place in the national team came under threat by the imminent return of the &#x27;rebel&#x27; Zimbabwean cricketers who had earlier walked out on the team in a dispute with Zimbabwe Cricket. The return was unsuccessful and Sibanda again became a regular at the top of the order for Zimbabwe, making his maiden ODI hundred in 2006 against Bermuda in the Caribbean Tri Nations Tournament.

He made a return to international cricket (although he denied ever retiring) for the Africa XI in the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup. He played in two of the three ODIs, scoring 80 runs at an average of 40.00. Although Sibanda was not playing initially in the 2011 Cricket World Cup an injury to Sean Williams meant a call-up for him. He scored 61 off 57 balls in an innings that included 7 fours. Zimbabwe reached 308/6.

Sibanda was included to the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 for Zimbabwe as the opening batsman with skipper Hamilton Masakadza. He scored his maiden T20I fifty of 59 from 54 balls against Hong Kong on 8 March 2016, during first match of group B in qualifying round. Zimbabwe won the match by 14 runs and Sibanda won man of the match award as well.

<text>Trevor Raymond Gripper (born 28 December 1975) is a former Zimbabwean cricketer. He was born in 1975 in Salisbury (now Harare).

Gripper was an opening batsman, who once spent four hours 23 minutes inching his way to 28 in a match against England A. However, his off-spin bowling has also proved useful, and in first-class cricket he may fairly be considered an all-rounder, with his batting average above 33 and his bowling average below 32.

Gripper made his first-class debut for a Matabeleland Invitation XI during Worcestershire&#x27;s 1996/97 tour of Zimbabwe, by scoring 45. However, he did not play another match at that level until the aforementioned game against England A in February 1999.

Gripper made his Test match debut in October 1999 against Australia at Harare; the selectors&#x27; decision was somewhat surprising since at the time Gripper had still not recorded a first-class century. He made 60 in the second innings. His maiden Test hundred came against Bangladesh in 2001, as Zimbabwe piled up 542/7 declared.

Although only taking six wickets in his Test career, he was notable as the bowler who dismissed Matthew Hayden for 380 runs (second highest runs scored in a Test match) in the first Test between Australia and Zimbabwe at Perth in October 2003. 

He played domestic cricket for Matabeleland, Manicaland and Mashonaland, and it was for the latter that he made his highest first-class score - 234 against Manicaland, this performance brought him a recall to the Zimbabwe team for the 2003/04 tour of Australia.

He also played two seasons for Cranleigh Cricket Club in Surrey (1999 and 2004) totalling over 1,400 1st XI runs and 68 wickets.

<doc id="899213" wikidata="Q7193063" url="?curid=899213" title="Steve Tikolo">
<text>Stephen Ogonji Tikolo (born 25 June 1971) is a former Kenya international cricketer, and a former One Day International captain. Widely regarded as the greatest Kenyan cricketer ever, Tikolo has scored the most runs and taken the second most wickets for the team in One Day Internationals. As captain, he led Kenya to the semi-final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

Tikolo has coached a number of international teams since the conclusion of his playing career, including Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria and Tanzania.

==Family==
Tikolo came from a cricketing family with his oldest brother Tom being a former captain of Kenya while his other brother David Tikolo played in the 1996 Cricket World Cup.

== Domestic career ==

Tikolo is a right-handed middle order batsman and right-arm off-spin bowler. Tikolo has previously represented Border in South African domestic cricket and has also spent time playing in England and Bangladesh. Most recently he has been playing club cricket in England and in Kenya he plays for Swamibapa Cricket Club in Nairobi.

In 2005 Tikolo was signed by Haverigg to play cricket in England.

In 2008 Tikolo was selected as captain of The Eastern Aces in Kenya&#x27;s Domestic Tournament, the Sahara Elite League

==International career==
In 1996 Cricket World Cup, Tikolo made his ODI debut for Kenya. Coming in at 3 for his maiden innings Tikolo made 65 against India. Tikolo went on to play a couple more impressive innings in the World Cup, top scoring for his side with 29 in their historic victory over the West Indies at Pune and 96 against Sri Lanka at Kandy.

Tikolo further enhanced his reputation as Kenya&#x27;s premier batsman with 147 against Bangladesh in the 1997 ICC Trophy final. The innings gave them official ODI status and booked Kenya&#x27;s place in England for the 1999 Cricket World Cup. It was another successful World Cup for Tikolo as he made a pair of 50s against India and England.

In 2002 Tikolo was named the new Kenyan captain and led from the front in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with innings of 93 and 69.

Tikolo led the Kenyan national side during their run to the semi-finals of the 2003 Cricket World Cup. This was a huge feat for a country that had not even been granted Test status, which is still rated as the best performance by Kenya in the international arena.

After a poor 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, Tikolo quit as captain and instead led a players&#x27; strike in protest against internal politics. The strike forced a new regime and he returned as captain.

In 2007 he became the first player from a non Test playing country to appear in 100 ODI games and score 2,500 ODI runs.

His last appearance as captain was the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier, where Kenya secured place for the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

In August 2010, months after walking out on the team and indicating he would not play international cricket again, Tikolo announced his availability for the 2011 World Cup. He announced his retirement after the World Cup but returned aged 42 when he was recalled for 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in UAE.

Tikolo has also represented an Africa XI against an Asia XI. Tikolo&#x27;s dominance of Kenyan cricket, is well highlighted that as of January 2007 he possessed six of the nine highest scores by a Kenyan batsman in ODI cricket. Tikolo has made three ODI centuries; 106* against Bangladesh, 111 against Bermuda and 102 against Zimbabwe. He has been dismissed in the 90s on three occasions.

== Coaching career ==

In July 2012 it was announced that Tikolo had been appointed the batting coach of the Ugandan national team but in May 2013, he was coach of Kenya national under-19 cricket team and his first assignment was at the ICC under-19 World Cup Africa qualifiers. During that tenure, Uganda won the T20 African Premier League and qualified for the World Cricket League Division II.

He was named interim coach of Kenya national cricket team when he replaced Robin Brown as head coach after Kenya&#x27;s failure to qualify for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20.

In May 2016, Tikolo was appointed as head coach of the Uganda national cricket team ahead of the 2017 World Cricket League Division Three. He departed as coach in 2019. In February 2020, Tikolo was named as the new head coach for the Tanzania national cricket team on a 3-year deal.

In October 2022, Tikolo was unveiled as the new head coach and high performance manager of the Nigeria national cricket team. His initial contract will run for 2 years.

In television, Scott was a main cast member on the Fox series &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (2018–2019) and &quot;Welcome to Flatch&quot; (2022–2023). He also reprised his film voice role as Crash in two &quot;Ice Age&quot; television specials: &quot;A Mammoth Christmas&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Great Egg-Scapade&quot; (2016).

== Early life ==
Scott was born and raised in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, the son of Patricia Anne Simons and William Frank Scott. Scott&#x27;s father died in 2007. He is the youngest of his seven siblings. He graduated from Park High School, where he was part of the varsity football and basketball teams. He has attended University of Wisconsin and Glendale Community College. Scott dedicated himself to acting and relocated to Los Angeles.

==Career==

=== 1996–2013: Breakthrough with &quot;American Pie&quot; films ===
Early in his career, Scott worked at The Home Depot and the Los Angeles Zoo to support himself between acting jobs. He also featured in the Aerosmith music video &quot;Hole in my Soul&quot;. In 1996, Scott made his first on-screen appearance as Moondoggie on The WB&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot; in the episode &quot;Beach Party.&quot; Scott landed the role of Steve Stifler in the comedy film &quot;American Pie&quot; (1999). Scott has revealed that he was paid $8,000 for his supporting role in the first film. &quot;American Pie&quot; grossed over $235 million at the worldwide box office. Scott reprised his role as Steve Stifler in the film&#x27;s three sequels, &quot;American Pie 2&quot; (2001), &quot;American Wedding&quot; (2003), and &quot;American Reunion&quot; (2012). Scott received a reported $5 million salary and a percentage of the profits for his performance in &quot;American Reunion&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that the &quot;American Pie&quot; films have grossed $989.5 million at the worldwide box office, became a pop culture phenomenon and made several cast members famous. Scott won two Teen Choice Awards for Choice Sleazebag as a result of playing Steve Stifler in &quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, and MTV Movie Award for Best Dance Sequence for &quot;American Wedding&quot;. He also shared an MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss with Jason Biggs for their kiss in &quot;American Pie 2&quot;.

Scott&#x27;s fear of typecasting led him to play different types of characters post-&quot;American Pie&quot;, such as a hapless nerd in the horror film &quot;Final Destination&quot; (2000) and a friendly stoner in &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot; (2000). &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot; was a box office success and has managed to achieve a cult status. The film earned $73.2 million worldwide against a $13 million budget. He also appeared in films &quot;Road Trip&quot; (2000), &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001), &quot;Evolution&quot; (2001), &quot;Stark Raving Mad&quot; (2002) and &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; (2003). He played Peppers in &quot;Old School&quot; (2003), which was a moderate box office success and has gained a massive cult following over the years. Scott portrayed Bo Duke in &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (2005), which was also financially successful, but received negative reviews from critics. The film eventually collected $111 million worldwide. He was nominated for MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Team with Jessica Simpson and Johnny Knoxville for their roles in &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. Scott hosted the MTV Movie Awards 2003 with Justin Timberlake.

Scott landed a lead role as a police officer in &quot;Southland Tales&quot; (2007), where he reunited with Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, with whom he had previously worked in &quot;The Rundown&quot; (2003). The two performed several skits, including scenes from &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, which are on &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; DVD. He has also hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and appeared as a guest co-host on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;. Scott appeared as John Farley in &quot;Mr. Woodcock&quot; (2007) and as Jeff Nichols in &quot;&quot; (2007). His next film, &quot;Role Models&quot; (2008) was a commercial success and grossed over $92 million at the box office worldwide. The film was met with positive reviews and was selected as one of the best films of 2008 by Canadian newspaper &quot;Eye Weekly&quot;.
He voiced the character Crash in &quot;Ice Age: The Meltdown&quot; and reprised his role in its sequel &quot;Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs&quot; (2009) and &quot;Ice Age: Continental Drift&quot; (2012). 

He appeared in the action-comedy film &quot;Cop Out&quot; (2010) alongside Bruce Willis, Tracy Morgan and Kevin Pollak. To prepare for his role in &quot;Cop Out&quot;, Scott gained weight and stopped working out for six months. In 2011, Scott starred in the Canadian sports comedy film &quot;Goon&quot; as Doug &#x27;The Thug&#x27; Glatt. The film was a critical success and made $6.7 million at the worldwide box office. In 2012, he starred in &quot;Movie 43&quot; in the segment &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;. In April 2012, Scott received an honorary medal from Trinity College&#x27;s Philosophical Society. In October 2013, Scott guest-starred in an episode of the FX television series &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;, playing Mac&#x27;s cousin named Country Mac.

=== 2014–present: Continued film work and transition to television ===
Scott expressed his interest to shift from comedic roles into more serious roles and portrayed Ted Morgan in the comedy-drama film, &quot;Just Before I Go&quot; (2015). &quot;It was rewarding to play pretty much the antithesis of what I&#x27;ve done in the past. To get a chance to play a totally different character—because he&#x27;s just a good, average, relatable guy going through obviously an awful moment in his life—was great,&quot; Scott told &quot;Variety&quot;. He reprised his roles as Crash in &quot;Ice Age: Collision Course&quot; (2016) and as Doug &#x27;The Thug&#x27; Glatt in &quot;&quot; (2017). Scott made a cameo appearance as a Vermont State Trooper in the 2018 film sequel, &quot;Super Troopers 2.&quot;

Scott portrayed the lead role of Evan in horror film &quot;Bloodline&quot; (2018). Executive producer of &quot;Bloodline&quot; Emma Tammi praised Scott&#x27;s performance and acting skills by saying: &quot;He has an amazing theater background and is a very versatile actor, and I don&#x27;t think most of the world has seen that yet. He was excited to approach this character in a way that would surprise people, and he really nails it.&quot; In May 2018, it was announced that Scott was cast as the new series lead in Fox&#x27;s &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; as a new character named Wesley Cole, replacing Clayne Crawford as Martin Riggs, who was fired amidst reports of bad behavior and incidents of hostility. Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised Scott&#x27;s addition to the cast and called his performance &quot;charming&quot;. On May 10, 2019, Fox canceled the show after three seasons. Scott portrayed abusive stepfather Martin in the coming-of-age road film &quot;Already Gone&quot; (2019), which was executive produced by Keanu Reeves.

In February 2020, Scott landed the role of Father Joe in the Fox comedy series &quot;Welcome to Flatch&quot; (2022–2023), written by Jenny Bicks and based on the British television series &quot;This Country&quot;. The show&#x27;s second and final season&#x27;s series finale aired on February 2, 2023. The series was canceled after two seasons. From June to July 2023, Scott and his &quot;American Pie&quot; co-star Jason Biggs appeared in food delivery company DoorDash&#x27;s &quot;Summer of DashPass&quot; campaign, including a television commercial. Scott appeared in the beginning of the action comedy film &quot;Jackpot!&quot; (2024), where he portrayed a lottery winner, who must fend off people trying to kill him in a future version of California.

==Personal life==
In interviews, Scott rarely talks about his personal life, and he has described himself as &quot;a private guy&quot;.

Media outlets reported that Scott dated former Victoria&#x27;s Secret fashion model Deanna Miller from 2005 to 2008.

In March 2012, Scott confirmed that he had proposed on Valentine&#x27;s Day and became engaged to fashion model Lindsay Frimodt. In January 2013, &quot;Us Weekly&quot; reported that this engagement had ended and that the two had split, but would remain friends.

He married interior designer Olivia Korenberg on September 2, 2019. The couple have one daughter, born in June 2020. On February 13, 2024, Scott filed for divorce, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; as the reason for their split. Scott requested joint legal and physical custody of their daughter.

<text>Robin Orr Blair, CVO, WS (born 1 January 1940), former Lord Lyon King of Arms of Scotland, is a retired solicitor, and was a partner with Dundas &amp; Wilson CS and later with Turcan Connell. From 1988 until his appointment as Lord Lyon, he held the post of Purse Bearer to the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. He is a member of the Royal Company of Archers.

He was appointed Lord Lyon by Queen Elizabeth II on 9 February 2001 following a recommendation from Scotland&#x27;s First Minister Henry McLeish. The role had been publicly advertised beforehand, for the first time in 700 years, and the selection process was overseen, also for the first time, by the Scottish Executive. 

On 19 February 2007, he became the Honorary President of the Scottish Genealogy Society upon the retirement after many years of Sir Malcolm Innes of Edingight, who had preceded him as Lord Lyon.

In August 2007, Blair intimated his resignation as Lord Lyon. In 2008 his successor, David Sellar, was appointed.

Already a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO), he was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

<doc id="899223" wikidata="Q412050" url="?curid=899223" title="Prostacyclin">
<text>Prostacyclin (also called prostaglandin I2 or PGI2) is a prostaglandin member of the eicosanoid family of lipid molecules. It inhibits platelet activation and is also an effective vasodilator.

When used as a drug, it is also known as epoprostenol. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

== Function ==
Prostacyclin chiefly prevents formation of the platelet plug involved in primary hemostasis (a part of blood clot formation). It does this by inhibiting platelet activation. It is also an effective vasodilator. Prostacyclin&#x27;s interactions contrast with those of thromboxane (TXA2), another eicosanoid. Both molecules are derived from arachidonic acid, and work together with opposite platelet aggregatory effects. These strongly suggest a mechanism of cardiovascular homeostasis between these two hormones in relation to vascular damage.

==Medical uses==
It is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), pulmonary fibrosis, as well as atherosclerosis. Prostacyclins are given to people with class III or class IV PAH.

==Degradation==
Prostacyclin, which has a half-life of 42 seconds, is broken down into 6-keto-PGF1, which is a much weaker vasodilator. 
A way to stabilize prostacyclin in its active form, especially during drug delivery, is to prepare prostacyclin in alkaline buffer. Even at physiological pH, prostacyclin can rapidly form the inactive hydration product 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α.

==Mechanism==
As mentioned above, prostacyclin (PGI2) is released by healthy endothelial cells and performs its function through a paracrine signaling cascade that involves G protein-coupled receptors on nearby platelets and endothelial cells. The platelet Gs protein-coupled receptor (prostacyclin receptor) is activated when it binds to PGI2. This activation, in turn, signals adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP. cAMP goes on to inhibit any undue platelet activation (in order to promote circulation) and also counteracts any increase in cytosolic calcium levels that would result from thromboxane A2 (TXA2) binding (leading to platelet activation and subsequent coagulation). PGI2 also binds to endothelial prostacyclin receptors, and in the same manner, raises cAMP levels in the cytosol. This cAMP then goes on to activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then continues the cascade by promoting the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain kinase, which inhibits it and leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. It can be noted that PGI2 and TXA2 work as physiological antagonists.

==Members==
==Pharmacology==

Synthetic prostacyclin analogues (iloprost, cisaprost) are used intravenously, subcutaneously or by inhalation:
* as a vasodilator in severe Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon or ischemia of a limb;
* in pulmonary hypertension.
* in primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH)

The production of prostacyclin is inhibited by the action of NSAIDs on cyclooxygenase enzymes COX1 and COX2. These convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the immediate precursor of prostacyclin. Since thromboxane (an eicosanoid stimulator of platelet aggregation) is also downstream of COX enzymes, one might think that the effect of NSAIDs would act to balance. However, prostacyclin concentrations recover much faster than thromboxane levels, so aspirin administration initially has little to no effect but eventually prevents platelet aggregation (the effect of prostaglandins predominates as they are regenerated). This is explained by understanding the cells that produce each molecule, TXA2 and PGI2. Since PGI2 is primarily produced in a nucleated endothelial cell, the COX inhibition by NSAID can be overcome with time by increased COX gene activation and subsequent production of more COX enzymes to catalyze the formation of PGI2. In contrast, TXA2 is released primarily by anucleated platelets, which are unable to respond to NSAID COX inhibition with additional transcription of the COX gene because they lack DNA material necessary to perform such a task. This allows NSAIDs to result in PGI2 dominance that promotes circulation and retards thrombosis.

In patients with pulmonary hypertension, inhaled epoprostenol reduces pulmonary pressure, and improves right ventricular stroke volume in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A dose of 60 μg is hemodynamically safe, and its effect is completely reversed after 25 minutes. No evidence of platelet dysfunction or an increase in surgical bleeding after administration of inhaled epoprostenol has been found. The drug has been known to cause flushing, headaches and hypotension.

==Synthesis==
===Biosynthesis===
 Prostacyclin is produced in endothelial cells, which line the walls of arteries and veins, from prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) by the action of the enzyme prostacyclin synthase. Although prostacyclin is considered an independent mediator, it is called PGI2 (prostaglandin I2) in eicosanoid nomenclature, and is a member of the prostanoids (together with the prostaglandins and thromboxane). PGI2, derived primarily from COX-2 in humans, is the major arachidonate metabolite released from the vascular endothelium. This is a controversial point, some assign COX 1 as the major prostacyclin producing cyclooxygenase in the endothelial cells of the blood vessels.

The series-3 prostaglandin PGH3 also follows the prostacyclin synthase pathway, yielding another prostacyclin, PGI3. The unqualified term &#x27;prostacyclin&#x27; usually refers to PGI2. PGI2 is derived from the ω-6 arachidonic acid. PGI3 is derived from the ω-3 EPA.

===Artificial synthesis===

Prostacyclin can be synthesized from the methyl ester of prostaglandin F2α. After its synthesis, the drug is reconstituted in saline and glycerin.

Because prostacyclin is so chemically labile, quantitation of their inactive metabolites, rather than the active compounds, is used to assess their rate of synthesis.

==History==

During the 1960s, a UK research team, headed by Professor John Vane, began to explore the role of prostaglandins in anaphylaxis and respiratory diseases. Working with a team from the Royal College of Surgeons, Vane discovered that aspirin and other oral anti-inflammatory drugs work by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. This critical finding opened the door to a broader understanding of the role of prostaglandins in the body.

A team at The Wellcome Foundation led by Salvador Moncada had identified a lipid mediator they called &quot;PG-X,&quot; which inhibits platelet aggregation. PG-X, later known as prostacyclin, is 30 times more potent than any other then-known anti-aggregatory agent. They did this while searching for an enzyme that generates a fellow unstable prostanoid, Thromboxane A2

In 1976, Vane and fellow researchers Salvador Moncada, Ryszard Gryglewski, and Stuart Bunting published the first paper on prostacyclin in &quot;Nature&quot;. The collaboration produced a synthesized molecule, which was named epoprostenol. But, as with native prostacyclin, the epoprostenol molecule is unstable in solution and prone to rapid degradation. This presented a challenge for both in vitro experiments and clinical applications.

To overcome this challenge, the research team that discovered prostacyclin continued the research. The research team synthesized nearly 1,000 analogues.

<text>Donald Leroy Bren (born May 11, 1932) is an American billionaire businessman. He is the chairman and owner of the Irvine Company, a U.S. real estate development corporation. With a net worth of $18 billion, he ranks number 104 on the 2024 Forbes Billionaires List.

==Early life==
Bren is the son of Marion Newbert and Milton Bren. His Jewish father Milton was a naval officer, talent agent, and movie producer. His mother Marion, who is of partial Irish descent, was a civic leader. Following their divorce in 1948, Bren&#x27;s father remarried Academy Award-winning actress Claire Trevor in the same year. His mother later got remarried to steel businessman Earle M. Jorgensen in 1953.

Bren was graduated from the University of Washington with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration and economics. While at the University of Washington, Bren became a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He failed to qualify for the 1956 Olympic ski team following an injury. After college, he served as an officer in the United States Marine Corps.

==Career==
In 1958, Bren began his business career by starting the Bren Company to build homes. In 1963, he and two others started the Mission Viejo Company (MVC), which purchased 10,000 acres to develop the city of Mission Viejo, California. He was President of MVC from 1963 to 1967. International Paper bought the Bren Co. for $34 million in 1970. They sold it back to Bren for $22 million in 1972 due to the recession. 

In 1977, Bren joined a group of investors to purchase the 146-year-old Irvine Company. He became the largest shareholder of the consortium, owning 34.3% of the company, and the vice-chair of the board. In 1983, as the majority owner of the firm, he was elected chairman of the board. By 1996, he bought out the remaining shares to become the sole owner.

&quot;OC Weekly&quot; wrote in 2005 that Bren &quot;wields more power than Howard Hughes ever did, probably as much as any man in America over a concentrated region—determining not only how people live and shop but who governs them.&quot; In 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote &quot;[s]imply put, Orange County looks like Orange County...because of the influence of [Donald Bren].&quot; In a 2011 interview, Bren summarized his real estate investment strategy: &quot;What I learned was that when you hold property over the long term, you&#x27;re able to create better values and you have something tangible to show for it.&quot; &quot;Forbes&quot;, in its 2019 edition of &quot;The 400 Richest Americans&quot;, ranked Bren as the wealthiest real estate developer in the US and 32nd &quot;Richest American&quot; with an estimated net worth of $17 billion.

It is believed that the Irvine Company owns more than 120 million ft² of real estate – the majority of which is in Southern California. The company&#x27;s holdings include several hotels, marinas, golf courses, 550 office buildings, 125 apartment complexes and more than 40 shopping centers. He currently also owns a 97% stake in the MetLife Building in Manhattan.

==Philanthropy==
In 2008, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; named Bren one of the top ten philanthropists in the nation. His contributions to various causes such as education, conservation and research exceeded $1 billion. In 2023, his lifetime contributions reached $2.1 billion.

Bren was honored in the 2010 National Philanthropy Day of Orange County with the &quot;Donald Bren Legacy of Giving Award&quot;. At that time, he said, &quot;I do try to bring the same level of attention to both my philanthropic and business ventures.&quot;

===Education===
Bren has donated over $200 million to support programs in K-12 public schools and higher education institutions in Southern California.

His contributions have benefited the University of California, Irvine, University of California, Santa Barbara, and Chapman University. The University of California recognised that Bren &quot;has contributed more to support endowed chairs than any other single donor in UC&#x27;s history.&quot; He had done so privately and through the Donald Bren Charitable Trust. At UC Irvine, his patronage was honored with the naming of the Bren Events Center, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences and Donald Bren Hall after him. Its Claire Trevor School of the Arts was named after his stepmother. UC Santa Barbara named Bren Hall and the Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management, a graduate school, after him in recognition of his donation to &quot;enhance and strengthen the school&#x27;s core interdisciplinary programs, personnel, and special activities.&quot; UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Henry T. Yang said, &quot;Bren&#x27;s vision for developing a peerless, world-leading institution offering an interdisciplinary program of environmental science, management, and policy has been a tremendous source of inspiration and leadership for the Bren School.&quot;

In August 2007, Bren pledged $20 million to the recently established UC Irvine School of Law. The purpose was to establish an endowment to help recruit and support a nationally recognized dean and 11 distinguished law scholars, and provide the dean with discretionary start-up funding. In recognition of the gift, the school was initially named the &quot;UC Irvine Donald Bren School of Law&quot;. In 2008, it was agreed that the school would no longer bear his name to be similar or parallel to other UC schools.

As a trustee at the California Institute of Technology, Bren supported new faculty as Bren Scholars and endowed five Bren Professorships.

In 2003, Bren donated $1 million to the Marine Corps University in Quantico, Virginia. It was used to endow two academic chairs on ethics and leadership, and on innovation and transformation.

Bren also supported after-school services for K-12 students in Southern California through THINK Together. His contribution in 2001 helped the after-school program expand its services to 40 schools in the Santa Ana district. This would benefit more than 10,000 students over 10 years.

Bren donated $25 million in 2000 and $20 million in 2006 to the Irvine Unified School District. Tim Shaw, former chief executive officer of the Irvine Public Schools Foundation, commented that the gift &quot;seeded the strong public support of elementary arts, music and science instruction.&quot;

===Conservation===
&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; ranked Bren as 9th in its &quot;Green Rich List&quot; in March 2009. This lists the 100 wealthiest people, who have either invested in green technology/business or made large contributions to environmental causes. It was due to his $20 million in donations to UC Santa Barbara&#x27;s School of Environmental Science.

In 30 years, Bren donated of land for parks, greenways, recreation and wilderness preserves. This fulfills his plans and commitment to preserve more than 50-percent of historic Irvine Ranch of . of it were designated as the Irvine Ranch National Natural Landmark. During the 2006 ceremony at Crystal Cove State Park to celebrate this, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said, &quot;it is really a spectacular gift that [Bren&#x27;s] given to [California]. Donald Bren is...the ultimate of generosity. Not only what he contributes to the environment, but what he contributes continuously to the community, if it is in education, if it is in arts, if it is music, if it is the environment, the tens of millions of dollars he&#x27;s invested in the environment, to protect the environment. He&#x27;s an extraordinary man.&quot;

In 2008, the state of California also designated the land as the first California Natural Landmark because of the land&#x27;s ecological value. The protected land, once a part of Irvine Ranch, is operated by The Irvine Ranch Conservancy. In June 2010, Bren completed his pledge to set aside more than 50,000 acres (202.3km2) of the original 93,000-acre ranch as open space by designating 20,000 acres (81 km2) to Orange County, California, as an open-space and parklands gift. This was the largest donation of private property to public ownership in Orange County history. That year, he was recognized for donating more than 20,000 acres of pristine wilderness to Orange County, asking only that it remain open space forever. In August 2014, the Irvine Company announced plans to donate and preserve 2,500 additional acres of land previously approved for housing, bringing the preserved lands of the Irvine Ranch to 60%.

Gale Norton, former U.S. Secretary of the Interior, speaking about Bren&#x27;s history of land donations, said, &quot;The Irvine Ranch illustrates what cooperative conservation is all about. A conservation-minded corporate citizen is working hand-in-hand with federal and state agencies, The Nature Conservancy, local communities, private citizens and other partners to thoughtfully and purposefully create an environment where both people and wildlife can thrive.&quot;

===Research===
In 2007, Bren made a $2.5 million commitment to the Burnham Institute for Medical Research in La Jolla, California. The contribution established The Donald Bren Presidential Chair and the money donated was used to support research conducted by the Institute such as cancer, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and childhood diseases among others.

In a 2011 interview, Bren indicated that solar energy is one of the areas he is exploring for a future philanthropic gift. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s my view that solar energy may be the ultimate solution for energy for most of the world. I believe, based on what little I know about it, that there is a possibility of a breakthrough.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
In 2006 the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; named Bren as both the most powerful and wealthiest person in Southern California, and the &quot;Orange County Business Journal&quot; named him &quot;Businessperson of the Year&quot; based on the company&#x27;s office expansion, new building construction, and Bren being recognized for his conservation efforts by the federal government. In 2011 the Urban Land Institute awarded Bren its first Vanguard Award, calling him &quot;one of the most consequential developers in American history.&quot; In 2014 he was named on OC Register&#x27;s list of the 100 most influential people in Orange County.

In 2004 Bren received the University of California Presidential Medal, the University&#x27;s highest honor, because of his financial support throughout the years which at the time was more than $43 million. During the award ceremony, former UC President, Robert Dynes said, &quot;[Bren&#x27;s] passionate philanthropy and commitment to educational excellence have helped strengthen the university.&quot;

In 1998, Bren received the Marine Corps University Foundation&#x27;s Semper Fidelis Award, which recognises a distinguished American leader whose commitment to personal and professional excellence embodies those qualities of leadership and character uniquely associated with the United States Marine Corps. Past award recipients include former President George H.W. Bush and former Secretary of State George P. Schultz. The Foundation also presented Bren with its most prestigious award in 2003, the General Leonard F. Chapman Medallion named in honor of the 24th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps.

Bren serves on the board of trustees at Caltech and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He was elected a Fellow with the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences in 2007 in the category of Business, Corporate and Philanthropic Leadership.

==Personal life==
Bren has been married three times. His first marriage was to Diane Bren, and they had three children. His first son, Cary Bren, born 1959, served as president of Orange County home builder California Pacific Homes. His second son, Steve Bren, born 1960, was a former professional auto racing driver and real estate developer.

Bren&#x27;s second marriage was to Mardelle Bren in 1977. They had one daughter, Ashley Bren, born 1968.

In May 1998, Bren, an Episcopalian, married Brigitte Muller, an entertainment lawyer born in La Jolla, California, in a church ceremony at the All Saints Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills, California. He and his wife reside in Newport Beach, California. They had a son in 2003.
Bren also has three children by two former companions.

Bren keeps a low public profile and as he explains, &quot;I&#x27;m not a public official. I&#x27;m a businessman, I&#x27;m a builder, I&#x27;m a planner... And if I feel that I&#x27;ve done the job well, that&#x27;s the satisfaction I get, not from doing interviews or being more public.&quot; &quot;OC Weekly&quot; described Bren in 2005 as &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s least public billionaires&quot;, who guards his privacy &quot;jealously&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that year canceled a pending article discussing how the fictional Caleb Nichol of the popular television show &quot;The O.C.&quot; was based on Bren, allegedly because the Irvine Company threatened to withdraw advertising. The &quot;Times&quot; denied the allegation and stated that the story was canceled for timing reasons.

==Politics==
Bren supported Republican Pete Wilson&#x27;s Senate and gubernatorial campaigns, and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, whom he calls &quot;a great senator for California.&quot;

Since the availability of FEC records in 1980, Donald Bren, has contributed tens of thousands of dollars each year to GOP causes. In May 2016, he made contributions to Donald Trump. Bren has donated at least $135,000 to the California Republican Party.

<text>Williamsford is a village on the North Saugeen River in Grey County, Ontario, Canada (Chatsworth Township). It has a general store, Pie Company, post office, bookstore and restaurant housed in a historic grain mill. A small dam controls the North Saugeen River. It has several churches, and a community cemetery. It is located on Highway 6 between Durham and Owen Sound.

The village of Williamsford was first surveyed in 1858 comprising 400 acres in preparation for a railway which was to run from Toronto to Owen Sound. Each township was to contribute $40,000 to its construction. The post office was built in 1847 and the general store was built in the late 1800s.

== Recreation ==
At the south end of the village sits the community centre grounds. The grounds contain a playground, a baseball diamond and a newly built curling rink. The curling rink which was completed in 2010 consists of a lounge and two rinks.

The community was previously served by a hockey arena with the original attached curling rink. The arena was planned in 1954 and opened officially in 1956 and was torn down in 2008.

==Transportation==

Ontario Highway 6 passes through the Williamsford.

<doc id="899236" wikidata="Q1548946" url="?curid=899236" title="Irukandji syndrome">
<text>Irukandji syndrome is a condition that results from envenomation by certain box jellyfish. In rare instances the sting may result in cardiac arrest and death. The most common jellyfish involved is the &quot;Carukia barnesi&quot;, a species of Irukandji jellyfish. Those stung may experience severe or even excruciating pain.

The syndrome was given its name in 1952 by Hugo Flecker, after the Aboriginal Irukandji people who live in Palm Cove, north of Cairns, Queensland, Australia, where stings are common.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most stings occur during the summer wet season in October–May in North Queensland, with different seasonal patterns elsewhere. Because the jellyfish are very small, the venom is only injected through the tips of the nematocysts (the cnidocysts) rather than the entire lengths; as a result the sting may barely be noticed at first. It has been described as feeling like little more than a mosquito bite. The symptoms, however, gradually become apparent and then more and more intense in the subsequent 5 to 120 minutes (30 minutes on average). Irukandji syndrome includes an array of systemic symptoms, including severe headache, backache, muscle pains, chest and abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, sweating, anxiety, hypertension, tachycardia, and pulmonary edema. Symptoms generally improve in four to 30 hours, but may take up to two weeks to resolve completely.

===Toxicity===
When properly treated, a single sting is almost never fatal; however, two people in Australia are believed to have died from Irukandji stings, which has greatly increased public awareness of Irukandji syndrome. It is unknown how many other deaths from Irukandji syndrome have been wrongly attributed to other causes.

==Pathophysiology==
The exact mechanism of action of the venom is unknown, but catecholamine excess may be an underlying mechanism in severe cases. Animal studies appear to confirm a relationship between envenoming and an increase in circulating noradrenaline and adrenaline.

==Treatment==
Similar to other box jellyfish stings, first aid consists of flushing the area with vinegar to neutralize the tentacle stinging apparatus. As no antivenom is available, treatment is largely supportive, with analgesia being the mainstay of management. Nitroglycerin, a common drug used for cardiac conditions, is utilised by medical personnel to minimise the risk of pulmonary edema and to reduce hypertension. Antihistamines may be of benefit for pain relief, but most cases require intravenous opioid analgesia. Fentanyl or morphine are usually chosen. Pethidine (meperidine, brand name Demerol in the US) should be avoided, as large doses are often required for pain relief and in this situation significant adverse effects from the pethidine metabolite norpethidine may occur.

Magnesium sulfate (epsom salts) has been proposed as a treatment for Irukandji syndrome after being apparently successfully used in one case. Early evidence suggested a benefit; however, according to a later report, a series of three patients failed to show any improvement with magnesium; the author emphasized the experimental status of this treatment. Some preliminary laboratory experiments using the venom extracted from &quot;Malo maxima&quot; (the &#x27;Broome Irukandji&#x27;) on rat cardiovascular tissue &quot;in vitro&quot; has suggested that magnesium does in fact block many of the actions of this venom.

==Epidemiology==
Reports of Irukandji syndrome have come from Australia, the United States (Hawaii and Florida), the French Antilles, Bonaire, the Caribbean, Timor Leste and Papua New Guinea. Cubozoan species other than &quot;Carukia barnesi&quot; are presumed to be responsible for envenomations outside Australia.

==History==
In 1961 Jack Barnes confirmed the cause of the then mysterious Irukandji syndrome was a sting from a small box jellyfish: the Irukandji jellyfish, which can fire venom-filled stingers out of its body and into passing victims. To prove that the jellyfish was the cause of the syndrome, he captured one and deliberately stung himself, his 9-year-old son and a local lifeguard, then observed the resulting symptoms. Other cubozoans possibly can cause Irukandji syndrome; those positively identified include&quot; Carukia barnesi&quot;, , &quot;Alatina alata&quot;, &quot;Malo maxima&quot;, &quot;Malo kingi&quot;, &quot;Carybdea xaymacana&quot;, &quot;Keesingia gigas&quot;, an as-yet unnamed &quot;fire jelly&quot;, and another unnamed species.

==Culture and society==
A 2005 Discovery Channel program, &quot;Killer Jellyfish&quot;, portrayed the severity of the pain from an Irukandji jellyfish sting when two Australian researchers (Jamie Seymour and Teresa Carrette) were stung. Another program aired on the Discovery Channel, &quot;Stings, Fangs and Spines&quot;, featured a 20-minute spot on Irukandji syndrome. In the segment, a young Australian woman was stung and developed a severe case.

A 2007 fictional &quot;Sea Patrol&quot; episode (S1, E4) involves two crew members of HMAS &quot;Hammersley&quot; being stung by an Irukandji jellyfish.

On the television program &quot;Super Animal&quot;, a woman compared her experience with Irukandji syndrome to the pain of childbirth.

Steve Backshall reports with accounts from victims of Irukandji stings on his ITV wildlife series &quot;Fierce&quot; in 2016.

<text>Arash Miresmaeili (, born 3 March 1981) is an Iranian judoka. He now serves as the President of the Iranian Judo Federation.

==World Judo Championships==
He won the gold medal in two World Judo Championships, the first one in 2001 in Munich, Germany, and the second in 2003 in Osaka, Japan. He also won bronze medal in the 2005 World Judo Championships in Cairo, Egypt and 2007 World Judo Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

==Athens Olympic Games; controversy==
Arash Miresmaili was the favorite for the gold medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he was the flag bearer for Iran at the opening ceremonies.

Slated to fight Israeli judoka competitor Ehud Vaks in the first round, Miresmaili was disqualified from competing because he was above the permissible weight limit for his class. He was more than two kilos - four pounds - over the 66-kilogram weight limit. It was claimed that Miresmaili deliberately set out to be disqualified, rather than compete against an Israeli, which was understood from Miresmaili&#x27;s comments: &quot;Although I have trained for months and was in good shape I refused to fight my Israeli opponent to sympathize with the suffering of the people of Palestine and I do not feel upset at all.&quot;

Judo officials questioned how such an experienced two-time world champion competitor could have made such a basic error.

There was precedent for Miresmaeili&#x27;s actions in the sport of judo. At the 2001 World Judo Championships, Iranian Mahed Malekmohammdi refused to face Israeli judoka Yoel Razvozov. Similarly, Iranian judoka Masoud Haji Akhoundzade pulled out of a bout against Israeli lightweight Zvi Shafran.

An Iran National Olympic Committee spokesman said it was Iran&#x27;s &quot;general policy&quot; to avoid competing against Israeli athletes and that Miresmaeili had just followed Iran&#x27;s protocol. Comments from Iranian officials and politicians supported this understanding. The Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted then-Iranian President Mohammad Khatami as saying that Miresmaeili&#x27;s actions would be &quot;recorded in the history of Iranian glories&quot; and that the nation considered him to be &quot;the champion of the 2004 Olympic Games.&quot; Iranian Olympic team chairman Nassrollah Sajadi told the Shargh newspaper that the government should give the athlete $115,000 for his action, the amount the Iranian government awards gold medal winning athletes. Then-mayor of Tehran and former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that though Miresmaeili &quot;did not get a gold medal, he earned eternal honor by his refusal&quot;. Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel, the speaker of Iran&#x27;s parliament, congratulated Miresmaeili, calling his refusal to compete a &quot;brave decision,&quot; and saying that &quot;Your disqualification because of supporting Palestine would promote your position in the heart of Muslims.&quot;

Vaks said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think they (Iran) have the right not to acknowledge us. Israel is a democracy, and Iran isn&#x27;t. But sport is linked to politics... Maybe the next Olympics will be better.&quot;

On August 18, 2004, the International Judo Federation (IJF), which had set up a commission to investigate whether Miresmaeili deliberately missed weight so he would not have to face Vaks, concluded he had no intention to avoid competing against an Israeli. After a hearing which included the president of Iran&#x27;s judo federation, the commission concluded that Miresmaeili said he had no pre-planned intentions for not competing and that &quot;he made no statement of any sort to any press,&quot; according to an IJF statement. The only issue that remained was that Miresmaeili was overweight on the weigh-in day, the IJF said, and as it has no rule for penalizing overweight athletes, it decided not to take any action against him.

On September 8, 2004, Iran&#x27;s official press agency announced the government had given Miresmaili $125,000, the same amount awarded to Iran&#x27;s two Athens gold medalists.

== Denial of entry to the election of Iran&#x27;s Judo Federation ==
In the summer of 2009, before the controversial Iranian presidential elections, Miresmaeili chose to support the candidacy of Mohsen Rezaee, one of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s rivals.

Rezaei appointed Miresmaeili as his campaign chief for the Sports Committee. After being appointed, during a press conference, Miresmaeili stated that if Rezaee were elected as president, there would be no more place for Iranian sports officials appointed for political purposes, as opposed to their knowledge and capabilities. His backing of Rezaee and his remarks did not sit well with the conservative backers of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the Iranian Sports Federation and elsewhere. They also drew immediate and harsh condemnation from the former Chief of Iran&#x27;s Sports Federation, Mohammed Aliabadi.

Since then, the effort to punish and sideline Miresmaeili went as far as denying him entry to an election event of Iran&#x27;s Judo Federation held on Jan 2, 2009. Miresmaeili tried very hard to gain entry into the event, and was denied entry by the security guards. This angered Miresmaeili to the point where he called a press conference that day, during which he stated that he was very sorry for sports in Iran and that he was officially done with the Iranian Judo, but that they could not kill his love for Judo.

==As the President of the Iranian Judo Federation==

In 2019, Miresmaili was elected President of the Iranian Judo Federation for a four-year term by receiving 32 out of 43 votes.

Sorted in this Opus/WoO/Anh order, duplicate entries (those listed initially under more than one genre) are moved to the bottom of the list with the unused genre headers.

The majority of Scriabin&#x27;s works have opus numbers. His work can be divided into three (somewhat arbitrary) periods, based on increasing atonality: early, 1883–1902 (Opp. 1–29); middle, 1903–1909 (Opp. 30–58); and late, 1910–1915 (Opp. 59–74). The development of Scriabin&#x27;s style can be traced in his ten published sonatas for piano. The first four are in the Romantic style. Initially the music is reminiscent of Chopin, but Scriabin&#x27;s unique voice, present from the beginning, becomes fully present even in these early pieces. With the fourth and fifth sonatas, Scriabin explored more complex, chromatic harmonies. Each of the following sonatas are often highly dissonant and have a new form of tonality that some describe as atonal and others describe as simply different from conventional tonality. &quot;Vers la flamme&quot; was intended to be the eleventh sonata, but he was forced to publish it early due to financial concerns. Most of Scriabin&#x27;s sonatas consist of only a single movement; the first and third are the only ones with multiple movements typical of the sonata form.

<doc id="899253" wikidata="Q1474061" url="?curid=899253" title="FP (programming language)">
<text>FP (short for &quot;functional programming&quot;) is a programming language created by John Backus to support the function-level programming paradigm. It allows building programs from a set of generally useful primitives and avoiding named variables (a style also called tacit programming or &quot;point free&quot;). It was heavily influenced by APL developed by Kenneth E. Iverson in the early 1960s.

The FP language was introduced in Backus&#x27;s 1977 Turing Award paper, &quot;Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?&quot;, subtitled &quot;a functional style and its algebra of programs.&quot; The paper sparked interest in functional programming research, eventually leading to modern functional languages, which are largely founded on the lambda calculus paradigm, and not the function-level paradigm Backus had hoped. In his Turing award paper, Backus described how the FP style is different:

FP itself never found much use outside of academia. In the 1980s Backus created a successor language, FL as an internal project at IBM Research.

== Overview ==

The values that FP programs map into one another comprise a set which is closed under sequence formation:

 if x1...,xn are values, then the sequence 〈x1...,xn〉 is also a value

These values can be built from any set of atoms: booleans, integers, reals, characters, etc.:
 boolean : {T, F}
 integer : {0,1,2...,∞}
 character : {&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;b&#x27;,&#x27;c&#x27;...}
 symbol : {x,y...}

⊥ is the undefined value, or bottom. Sequences are &quot;bottom-preserving&quot;:

 〈x1...,⊥...,xn〉 = ⊥

FP programs are &quot;functions&quot; f that each map a single &quot;value&quot; x into another:

 f:x represents the value that results from applying the function f 
 to the value x

Functions are either primitive (i.e., provided with the FP environment) or are built from the primitives by program-forming operations (also called functionals).

An example of primitive function is constant, which transforms a value x into the constant-valued function x̄. Functions are strict:
 f:⊥ = ⊥

Another example of a primitive function is the selector function family, denoted by 1,2... where:
 i:〈x1...,xn〉 = xi if 1 ≤ i ≤ n
 = ⊥ otherwise

==Functionals==

In contrast to primitive functions, functionals operate on other functions. For example, some functions have a &quot;unit&quot; value, such as 0 for &quot;addition&quot; and 1 for &quot;multiplication&quot;. The functional unit produces such a value when applied to a function f that has one:
 unit + = 0
 unit × = 1
 unit foo = ⊥

These are the core functionals of FP:

 composition f∘g where f∘g:x = f:(g:x)

 construction [f1...,fn] where [f1...,fn]:x = 〈f1:x...,fn:x〉

 condition (h ⇒ f;g) where (h ⇒ f;g):x = f:x if h:x = T
 = g:x if h:x = F
 = ⊥ otherwise

 apply-to-all &quot;αf where &quot;αf:〈x1...,xn〉 = 〈f:x1...,f:xn〉

 insert-right /f where /f:〈x〉 = x
 and /f:〈x1,x2...,xn〉 = f:〈x1,/f:〈x2...,xn〉〉
 and /f:〈 〉 = unit f

 insert-left \f where \f:〈x〉 = x
 and \f:〈x1,x2...,xn〉 = f:〈\f:〈x1...,xn-1〉,xn〉
 and \f:〈 〉 = unit f

==Equational functions==

In addition to being constructed from primitives by functionals, a function may be defined recursively by an equation, the simplest kind being:
 f ≡ &quot;E&quot;f
where &quot;E&quot;f is an expression built from primitives, other defined functions, and the function symbol f itself, using functionals.

==FP84==
FP84 is an extension of FP to include infinite sequences, programmer-defined combining forms (analogous to those that Backus himself added to FL, his successor to FP), and lazy evaluation. Unlike FFP, another one of Backus&#x27; own variations on FP, FP84 makes a clear distinction between objects and functions: i.e., the latter are no longer represented by sequences of the former. FP84&#x27;s extensions are accomplished by removing the FP restriction that sequence construction be applied only to &quot;non&quot;-⊥ objects: in FP84 the entire universe of expressions (including those whose meaning is ⊥) is closed under sequence construction.

FP84&#x27;s semantics are embodied in an underlying algebra of programs, a set of function-level equalities that may be used to manipulate and reason about programs.

<doc id="899255" wikidata="Q500460" url="?curid=899255" title="Evolution (2001 film)">
<text>Evolution is a 2001 American science fiction comedy film directed by Ivan Reitman and written by David Diamond and David Weissman, based on a story by Don Jakoby. The film stars David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Seann William Scott, Julianne Moore, and Ted Levine in lead roles.

The plot follows college professor Ira Kane (Duchovny) and geologist Harry Block (Jones) as they investigate a meteor crash in Arizona, only to discover that it harbors rapidly evolving extraterrestrial life forms.

&quot;Evolution&quot; was released on June 8, 2001, by DreamWorks Pictures in the United States and Columbia Pictures internationally.

An animated series, &quot;&quot;, was later developed and aired shortly after the film’s release.

==Plot==
Late one night, a large meteor crashes in the Arizona desert, witnessed by aspiring firefighter Wayne Grey. The next morning, college professors Ira Kane and Harry Block investigate the crash site, discovering that the meteor has landed in a cave and secretes a strange blue liquid. Upon further study, they find that the meteor harbors extraterrestrial microorganisms that evolve rapidly, condensing millions of years of evolution into mere hours.

Over the next few days, the organisms evolve into fungi, flatworms, and aquatic creatures, despite being unable to breathe oxygen. As the U.S. Army takes control of the site, Ira and Harry attempt to continue their research with the help of Brigadier General Russell Woodman and epidemiologist Dr. Allison Reed. However, the Army soon shuts them out, prompting Ira to go to court, where he reveals that he was discharged from the Army after an anthrax vaccine experiment went wrong, causing severe side effects in 140,000 soldiers.

Frustrated by the Army’s takeover, Ira and Harry infiltrate the base to collect a new sample, only to find that the cave now harbors a full-fledged alien ecosystem, complete with tropical plants and animals. The situation escalates when a large reptilian creature kills the owner of a local country club, and other alien creatures begin attacking residents of nearby areas. The creatures, though unable to survive in Earth’s oxygen-rich environment, are rapidly evolving to adapt.

As the alien attacks become public, Governor Lewis demands answers, and Dr. Reed calculates that the alien organisms could overrun the U.S. within two months. Despite opposition, General Woodman authorizes a napalm strike to destroy the meteor and its surrounding ecosystem. However, Ira realizes that heat accelerates the aliens&#x27; evolution, and the napalm strike only causes the alien life forms to fuse into a gigantic amoeba-like creature.

In a desperate attempt to stop the creature, Ira theorizes that selenium, toxic to nitrogen-based life forms, could kill the aliens. With the help of his students, Ira discovers that selenium sulfide, the active ingredient in Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, could be their solution. Armed with a fire truck filled with shampoo, the team heads to the creature just as it begins to multiply into two. The team manages to inject the creature with the shampoo, causing it to implode.

With the alien threat neutralized, Governor Lewis declares Ira, Harry, Wayne, and Allison as heroes. Wayne is finally made a full firefighter, and Ira and Allison begin a romantic relationship, while the town returns to normal.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Evolution&quot; was based on a story by Don Jakoby. Director Ivan Reitman loved the script but saw potential in transforming it into a successful comedy, describing it as a &quot;modern-day successor to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984).&quot; Reitman hired writers David Diamond and David Weissman to rewrite much of Jakoby&#x27;s script, incorporating elements from another screenplay by Todd Phillips and Scot Armstrong about three friends hunting aliens. Initially, Jakoby was upset by the tonal shift, but Diamond and Weissman worked closely with him to ensure the final product was something he was happy with. The original script ended with a &quot;battle of wits&quot; between humans and an ultra-intelligent alien species, but this was replaced with the more action-packed climax seen in the final film.

Reitman had worked with David Duchovny on &quot;Beethoven&quot; (1992), where David Duchovny had a small role, and envisioned him as the lead for &quot;Evolution&quot;, recognizing his ability to handle comedy. Duchovny discussed a role in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005) with George Lucas, but turned it down in part due to his schedule shooting this movie. He sought to distance himself from his iconic &quot;The X-Files&quot; character and saw this comedic alien film as an opportunity to transition into different roles. Seann William Scott was cast after impressing Reitman with his performance in &quot;Road Trip&quot; (2000), another film Reitman produced. Scott beat out Jerry Trainor, who was given a smaller role. Michael J. Fox was also offered a lead role but declined due to his ongoing battle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

===Filming===
Shooting for &quot;Evolution&quot; took place from October 19, 2000, to February 7, 2001, in Page, Arizona, and around the Greater Los Angeles area, particularly in the Santa Clarita, California region. Scenes set at the fictional Glen Canyon Community College were filmed at California State University, Fullerton. The shopping mall sequences were shot at Hawthorne Plaza in Hawthorne, California. The first scene filmed was the monster attack on two elderly women. Studio filming occurred at Downey Studios and Raleigh Studios.

===Visual effects===
Tippett Studio was tasked with designing over 18 distinct alien creatures for &quot;Evolution&quot;, ensuring each had a unique appearance. Sony Pictures Imageworks handled the CGI animation for several key sequences, including the alien flatworm and the leech alien from the pool, which was designed by Peter Konig. They also created the animation for the alien mosquito moving inside Harry&#x27;s body. Additional visual effects were provided by Pacific Data Images. Studio ADI was responsible for designing the primate-like alien creatures featured in the film.

==Music==
The film&#x27;s music score was composed by John Powell, conducted by Gavin Greenaway, and performed by the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra. A soundtrack album was released on June 12, 2001 and is available on Varèse Sarabande.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Evolution&quot; holds an approval rating of 44% based on 140 reviews, with an average score of 4.90/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Director Reitman tries to remake &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, but his efforts are largely unsuccessful because the movie has too many comedic misfires.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40 based on 32 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of B+ on an A to F scale.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a consistently amusing action romp.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s not good, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as bad as most recent comedies; it has real laughs, but it misses just as many real opportunities.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The movie itself evolves in reverse, starting life as a moderately clever grab bag of high-concept noodling and half-witty badinage before descending into the primordial ooze of explosions and elaborate lower-intestinal gags.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Evolution&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on December 26, 2001. The film later received a Blu-ray release in the United States on November 23, 2021, by Paramount Home Entertainment. A separate Blu-ray release of the Columbia Pictures version was made available in the United Kingdom on April 22, 2024, through 88 Films.

==Television series==

&quot;Evolution&quot; was adapted into an animated series titled &quot;&quot;, which aired on Fox Kids from 2001 to 2002. The series loosely followed the film&#x27;s premise, expanding on the storyline with new characters and alien creatures, but aimed at a younger audience.

<text>John Popper (born March 29, 1967) is an American musician and songwriter, known as the co-founder, lead vocalist, and frontman of the rock band Blues Traveler.

==Early life==
Popper was born on March 29, 1967, in Cleveland, Ohio. His father was a Hungarian immigrant who left Budapest in 1948. Popper has stated that he is a distant relative of David Popper, a 19th-century Bohemian cellist.

Popper was raised in Stamford, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. He attended Davenport Ridge School, Stamford Catholic High School (now Trinity Catholic High School), and Princeton High School, from which he graduated in 1986. He took lessons on the piano, the cello, and the guitar, but none of those instruments appealed to him, and he hated being forced to practice.

He originally wanted to become a comedian, finding he could use humor to make friends and avoid bullies, but when he and a friend performed a routine as the Blues Brothers, he found that he enjoyed musical performance. From there, he took up the harmonica. Popper played trumpet in the Princeton High School Studio Jazz Band and convinced the teacher to let him play harmonica instead, after an in-class solo on the song &quot;She Blinded Me with Science.&quot;

He formed several garage bands with friends in Princeton, New Jersey, one of which evolved into Blues Traveler in 1987. After graduating from high school, the group&#x27;s members all moved to New York City, where Popper enrolled in the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, along with two of his bandmates as well as high school friend Chris Barron. Popper attended for three years but devoted himself to the band full-time once they signed a record contract, in 1990.

==Career==
===Blues Traveler===
Popper is a founding member of Blues Traveler, serving as the band&#x27;s frontman with lead vocals and harmonica. For some songs, he forgoes the harmonica in favor of guitar, most often a 12-string acoustic. In addition, Popper has played the tin whistle on some recordings.

A prolific songwriter, he has composed the majority of the lyrics and music of Blues Traveler&#x27;s songs.

The band grew a following with its extensive touring, sometimes with over 300 dates a year, and gained a reputation in the jam band scene of the 1990s. Blues Traveler crossed over into mainstream pop/rock radio success with their 1994 album, &quot;four&quot;, which garnered the group extensive media exposure. The Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1996 was awarded to &quot;Run-Around&quot;, a song that Popper composed. In 2021, Blues Traveler&#x27;s album &quot;Traveler&#x27;s Blues&quot; was nominated by the Recording Academy for &quot;Best Traditional Blues Album&quot; for the 2022 GRAMMY Awards.

===Solo work===
In 1990, Popper began to perform occasional solo concerts in addition to touring with Blues Traveler. Several songs that originated as Popper&#x27;s solo pieces have become part of Blues Traveler&#x27;s repertoire, and vice versa.

Bolstered by Blues Traveler&#x27;s mainstream success, Popper released a solo album, &quot;Zygote&quot;, in 1999, and toured in support of it with his own John Popper Band. The album was produced by Terry Manning, and the backing band consisted of longtime friends Dave Ares, Crugie Riccio, and Rob Clores of Cycomotogoat, with drummer Carter Beauford of Dave Matthews Band. The album&#x27;s release came less than three months after Popper&#x27;s heart surgery, and only days after the death of Bobby Sheehan, Popper&#x27;s bandmate and best friend. The subsequent tour was canceled midway due to poor ticket sales, and Popper instead took the time to focus on his health.

In 2017 and 2018, Popper began to play solo acoustic performances across the United States. He is often accompanied by Blues Traveler keyboardist Ben Wilson and performs songs that span both Blues Traveler and his solo catalog.

===Side projects===
In 1992, Popper conceived the HORDE Festival as a venue to gain exposure for up-and-coming independent musicians. It ran until 1998.

Popper was a part of a one-time studio band brought together in 1997 by New York drummer/songwriter Solomon Deniro. Other players included Trey Gunn, Bernie Worrell, Marc Ribot, and Vernon Reid. The group&#x27;s only recordings were released as the album &quot;Gimme Gimme&quot;, under the name the Devotees. The same recording was re-released by Deniro in 2001, under the title &quot;Solomon&quot;.

Popper took over in 1998 as frontman of jam-band supergroup Frogwings, which then released the live album &quot;Croakin&#x27; at Toad&#x27;s&quot;.

Popper later formed a rock/jazz/hip hop fusion group called the John Popper Project with DJ Logic, which released an album in 2006 and performs occasionally. He also performs on the 2008 album &quot;Jason Miles: Global Noize: A Prayer for the Planet&quot;.

Popper&#x27;s latest side project is John Popper &amp; the Duskray Troubadours, which plays Americana roots music. The group&#x27;s self-titled debut from 429 Records was released in March 2011 and was produced by band member Jono Manson, who co-wrote much of the material. The first single, &quot;Something Sweet&quot;, written by Manson and Bruce Donnola, was released February 7, 2011, on iTunes. Mason and Popper conceived the project after Popper says he was &quot;running out of ideas&quot; for Blues Traveler before they took a short break.

==Acting and media appearances==
Popper has provided narration for art projects produced by his friends, including &quot;Das Clown&quot;, an award-winning short film in slideshow style that was screened at the Sundance Film Festival.

In 2016, Popper, along with the rest of Blues Traveler, made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Meddler&quot;.

In 2018, Popper appeared in the &quot;Fully Vested&quot; episode of &quot;Pawn Stars&quot;.

==Personal life==
On November 23, 2015, Popper and his then-wife Jordan Auleb had their first child, a daughter; the couple divorced in 2018.

In 1999, he suffered a near-fatal heart attack brought on by years of compulsive overeating (he had been diagnosed with diabetes a few years earlier). Doctors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center performed an emergency angioplasty, which saved Popper&#x27;s life; he had 95% arterial blockage. Popper later underwent gastric bypass surgery and lost a significant amount of weight.

Popper has a tattoo across his chest that says &quot;I WANT TO BE BRAVE&quot;, written backwards.

In August 2016, he announced a pending surgical procedure to repair collapsed vertebrae in his neck, necessitating the postponement and cancellation of some Blues Traveler shows.

===Weapons collecting===
Popper is an avid collector of weaponry, including firearms, swords, and a working $10,000 American Civil War cannon. He cites a fascination with their aesthetic of being &quot;life-savingly efficient&quot; machines. Popper is a supporter of Second Amendment rights and once appeared on an MTV-sponsored roundtable discussion on gun control, which included panelists from the Law Enforcement Alliance of America and Harvard&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government. He carries weapons in any state where it is allowed, even when onstage. On his 2003 &quot;Daily Show&quot; appearance, he stated that he decided to move away from New Jersey because of the state&#x27;s tight gun laws.

===Politics===
Popper endorsed George W. Bush in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. In November 2008, Popper said, regarding Barack Obama, &quot;this is the first time I&#x27;ve voted for a Democrat, ever.&quot; Popper was a supporter of Ron Paul during the 2012 U.S. presidential election and participated in phone-banking at Paul&#x27;s New Hampshire campaign headquarters. He also played a short set during Paul&#x27;s &quot;We are the Future Rally&quot;, an alternative convention for Paul supporters that was held in Tampa the day before the 2012 Republican National Convention.

Popper (with and without Blues Traveler) has played at conventions, fundraisers, and ceremonies for both Republican and Democratic politicians.

Popper has said, &quot;I was a bleeding-heart liberal, until I got a job,&quot; and describes himself as &quot;a libertarian who is a Republican when pushed&quot;. The singer summed up his political position by saying, &quot;I believe in freedom for markets and freedom for individuals, so I guess that makes me a libertarian.&quot;

Popper has toured with the USO, both with Blues Traveler and solo. 

===Religion===
Popper was raised Catholic, and for a time attended Stamford Catholic High School in Connecticut. However, he does not actively practice in his adult life. He has described himself as a &quot;recovering Catholic&quot;. He wrote the song &quot;Trina Magna&quot; as an exploration of his religious views.

===Legal trouble===
In 2003, Popper was arrested for possession of marijuana. He was arrested again on March 6, 2007, near Ritzville, Washington, by the Washington State Patrol. He was the passenger in his own vehicle, which was stopped for speeding, and was found to be in the possession of a small amount of marijuana and weapons. Popper was released the same night. The vehicle had a stash of hidden compartments, which contained four rifles, nine handguns, a switchblade knife, a Taser, a set of brass knuckles, and night vision goggles. The vehicle was temporarily seized.

No charges were filed for the weapons, as they were all registered and securely locked away, and Popper was licensed to carry them, with the exception of the brass knuckles and switchblade knife, which he agreed to surrender. A deal was reached that allowed the marijuana charge to be dropped if Popper remained free of further drug infractions for one year and attended eight hours of drug counseling. Popper and the driver had been driving back to Washington from Austin, Texas, and Popper likes to visit gun ranges during long trips.

===Online controversy===
Popper is also known as an avid Twitter user and has caused some controversy on the platform. He also has publicly posted the home address and information of a particular Twitter user who often made jokes at his expense. Popper also drew attention for arguing with a bot named &quot;assbott&quot;, which had become well-known during the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump; it was the co-creator of this bot that Popper doxed in July 2017.

===Autobiography===
On March 29, 2016, Da Capo Press released Popper&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Suck and Blow: And Other Stories I&#x27;m Not Supposed to Tell&quot;, written by Popper with the help of &quot;Relix&quot; co-editor-in-chief Dean Budnick. In the book, among band exploits and a variety of topics, Popper discusses the group&#x27;s rebound from the death of bassist Bobby Sheehan, the creation of the H.O.R.D.E. tour, his relationship with Bill Graham, and his personal battle with being overweight.

==Equipment==
Popper has expressed a preference for the Hohner Special 20 diatonic harmonica, calling them &quot;the Porsche of harmonicas.&quot; 

He has developed some equipment innovations to accommodate his use of harmonicas during performances. Because each individual diatonic harmonica is tuned to one particular key, he fashioned belts with enough pockets to hold harmonicas in all twelve keys (plus extras) and wore them as a bandolier, or slung over his neck. He switches keys multiple times within one song, and this arrangement has allowed him to quickly trade one harmonica for another without looking. In 2002, he stopped using the belts, as they no longer fit him properly due to his weight loss. One such belt later sold for $2,700 on the History Channel series &quot;Pawn Stars&quot;. He now carries his harmonicas in a small black attaché case. He uses a special microphone with switches that change the audio effect of the harmonica as it is played through an amplifier, similar to a guitar effects pedal. Popper was inspired by Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s guitar playing to make his instrument sound however he wanted.

<text>Bishopston is a suburb of the city of Bristol in south west England. Bishopston is around Gloucester Road (A38), the main northern arterial road in the city and Bishop Road.

Bishopston is named after the bishop of the local diocese who controversially sold off the church&#x27;s land to private developers in the early 19th century. The sale was even raised as an issue in the House of Commons. The parish of Bishopston was then created in July 1862 with a population of 1300 and expanding to 9140 in the 1901 census. In the 2001 census Bishopston registered a resident population of 11,996. The district is part of the Bristol built-up area, having been swallowed by the growing city, running directly into the surrounding districts of Redland, Ashley Down, Horfield and Henleaze.

The area has a relatively large student population, with 21% of the over-16 population in education compared to 8.4% in Bristol and 5.1% in England and Wales.

Some of the location filming for the cult BBC sitcom &quot;The Young Ones&quot; was done in Codrington Road and elsewhere. The external shots for the famous &quot;bank-robbing&quot; scene in the last episode were filmed outside the now closed Bristol North Swimming Baths on Gloucester Road.

Bishopston was the home of two Nobel Prize–winning physicists. In 1933 Paul Dirac, who attended the Bishop Road Primary School, just a few hundred metres from where he lived on Monk Road, won the prize after his contributions to quantum mechanics. In 1950 Cecil Frank Powell won the prestigious award for contributions to Physics (specifically, for his development of the photographic method of studying nuclear processes and his discoveries regarding mesons made with this method). Bishopston was home to television presenter Adam Hart-Davis and psychologist Susan Blackmore.

The famous film star Cary Grant (real name Archibald Alexander Leach) attended Bishop Road School in Bishopston. As a child he lived nearby in Hughenden Road next to Horfield Common, where there is a blue plaque to commemorate him.

Bishopston has two primary schools, St. Bonaventure&#x27;s Catholic Primary School which served the huge Italian Irish and South American Catholic community and Bishop Road Primary School COE which was a secondary school up until the mid-1980s and served children of the Anglican faith and drew in children from the Asian and Jamaican community in St Paul&#x27;s and Montpellier.

The main artery, Gloucester Road, is a traditional local High Street, and well used by local residents. In addition to the independently run shops such as Scoopaway, La Ruca, Gardener&#x27;s Patch and Harvest, recent years have seen several supermarket chains opening stores in the area, as well as a number of cafés, restaurants, and pubs. This, together with the range of fairly traded and local goods available, has made it popular with ecologically minded shoppers.

Bishopston is home to Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, located off Nevil Road. The ground&#x27;s capacity has been increased to hold international cricket matches.

The David Thomas Memorial church, in neighbouring St Andrews, was erected between 1879 and 1881 but was demolished in 1987, destroying most of a Gothic fantasy by Stuart Coleman. The building still retains a thin octagonal spire and west front but the massive halls, apse and rib vaults have now gone, and have been replaced by flats by Stride Treglown.

==Politics==
For elections to Bristol City Council, it is split between the electoral wards of Redland and Bishopston and Ashley Down. The boundary between the two wards runs along Gloucester Road and then the southern perimeters of HMP Bristol and the playing fields of Bishop Road Primary and Redland Green School, with areas to the southwest in Redland ward.

For elections to the UK Parliament, Redland ward is in Bristol Central constituency, and the Bishopston and Ashley Down ward is in Bristol North West constituency.

Before boundary changes in 2016, Bishopston was itself an electoral ward.

==Education==
Bishopston is the location of Bishop Road Primary School, which opened in 1900, and is the largest primary school in Bristol, notable for having educated Cary Grant and Paul Dirac.

<text>Pukerua Bay is a small seaside suburb at the southern end of the Kāpiti Coast, New Zealand. In local government terms it is the northernmost suburb of Porirua City, in the Wellington Region. It is 12 km north of the Porirua City Centre on State Highway 59, and 30 km north of central Wellington. In Māori, the words &quot;puke rua&quot; literally mean &quot;two hills&quot; but it is not clear to which hills the name refers.

==Geography==

The majority of Pukerua Bay is situated in a saddle between hills, about 60-90m above sea level, offering sea views (and views of Kapiti Island and occasionally Mounts Taranaki and Ruapehu to the north) from many houses. The Kaikoura range on the South Island including Mt Tapuae-o-Uenuku can be seen from some places at the southern end of the township. The coast around Pukerua Bay is fairly steep, with only a few houses nestled in a row behind the two sandy beach areas. The surrounding hills are mainly farm land used for sheep and cattle grazing, providing a rural backdrop to the east and west. The area to the south, along , turns into Taupō Swamp towards Plimmerton.

Pukerua Bay&#x27;s main residential areas are along Rawhiti Road, west of SH 59, the central clifftop, Sea Vista Drive east of SH 59 and the beach frontage extending east (Brendan Beach) and west of Beach Road. There is a pedestrian bridge over SH 59 near Wairaka Road&#x27;s Kindergarten and pre-school and the school&#x27;s back entrance (the main entrance is on Rawhiti Road).

There are two walks between Pukerua Bay and Plimmerton (5 km south), one around the rocky coast, and one inland (part of a longer cycleway) parallel to the railway. The inland route is pre-European – it was traditionally known as &quot;te taua tapu&quot; (the sacred war-party). The cycleway is known as Te Ara Harakeke (the flax road). The coastal route goes past Marble Arch (Te Ana Puta) to Wairaka Rock on an uninhabited part of Pukerua Bay, the only mainland home of Whitaker&#x27;s skink (&quot;Oligosoma whitakeri&quot;), an icon of the bay. According to legend, the rock is the petrified wife of culture hero Haunui-a-Nanaia, who pursued her from Māhia Peninsula, naming places on the way including Manawatū, Ōhau and Turakina.

The escarpment track between Pukerua Bay and Paekākāriki is exposed and prone to slips from significant rain events affecting SH 59 north of Pukerua Bay. The coastal road was closed three times within a year in 2022.

The waters around Pukerua Bay, from a point north halfway to Paekākāriki to Wairaka Point south of Pukerua Bay, are currently protected by a &quot;rāhui&quot;.

==History==

The earliest people known to have lived in the area around Pukerua Bay were the Ngāti Ira Māori tribe and later the Muaūpoko, who built Waimapihi Pā near today&#x27;s seaward end of Rawhiti Road. Pukerua Bay was on the main road for Māori travellers going north or south. About 1822, it was invaded from Kapiti Island by Te Rauparaha and his Ngāti Toa people. According to oral tradition, the Muaūpoko people fled up the gorge of the Waimapihi stream (on the Ohariu Fault line), abandoning their treasures on the way.

The land blocks originally surveyed (Wairaka in the west, Waimapihi and Pukerua in the east) were sold to settlers from Europe for farming in the late 19th century. Charles Gray was the first resident to subdivide and sell residential sections in Pukerua Bay, in the early 20th century.

Pukerua Bay&#x27;s development history is curious because the railway went through it (1886) for years before there was good road access (1940), so it grew at first on the waterfront as a weekend destination. The original railway station was named &quot;Pukerua&quot; until it was changed briefly to Waimapihi in the 1920s and then to &quot;Pukerua &quot;Bay&quot;&quot; to avoid confusion with &quot;Pukerau&quot; in the South Island.

By the end of the 1920s, Pukerua Bay numbered 100 houses, a small school on land donated by Charles Gray, and a few small stores. Electricity was put through from Plimmerton to Pukerua Bay in 1927 and in 1928 the track between Plimmerton and Pukerua Bay was formed into a narrow road. The beach remained the main attraction for weekend visitors from Wellington (by steam train) as there was still no road bridge at Paremata until 1935 and no highway until the Centennial Highway was completed in 1940.

Most of the clifftop development dates from after World War II and Pukerua Bay has its own branch of the Returned Services Association. Pukerua Bay experienced significant growth in the 1950s and 1960s, being connected to Wellington via the Kapiti Line (which was double-tracked to Pukerua Bay and electrified to Paekakariki in 1940) and accessible from north and south via State Highway 1 (which ran through Pukerua Bay at the time). In 1973, Pukerua Bay joined Porirua City Council to get the issues of water and sewerage connection addressed.

Growth continued in the 1970s with the Sea Vista Drive subdivision and soon the fact that the SH 1 route, with increasing traffic, was going through the middle of Pukerua Bay became an issue. In 1989, an over-bridge over the SH 1 route was opened, after continued lobbying by local residents, which included continually walking across the pedestrian crossing to hold up traffic.

The SH 1 route through Pukerua Bay was renumbered on 7 December 2021, due to SH 1 being shifted to the Transmission Gully Motorway.

Pukerua Bay&#x27;s skatepark was rebuilt in 2009 in a collaborative venture between the Porirua City Council, the Residents Association, and PKBSK8 Inc. Funding was also provided by the Caversham Foundation and the Mana Community Grants Foundation. The park is adjacent to the Pukerua Bay railway station, and replaces an old asphalt bowl which the City Council claims was the only purpose-built skatepark in the Southern Hemisphere when it opened in 1976.

A popular 10-kilometre walkway, the Escarpment Track, constructed as part of the national Te Araroa Trail, links Pukerua Bay with Paekākāriki. The walk features views to Kapiti Island.

<text>The clavier à lumières (&quot;keyboard with lights&quot;), or tastiera per luce, as it appears in the score, was a musical instrument invented by Alexander Scriabin for use in his work &quot;&quot;. Only one version of this instrument was constructed, for the performance of &quot;Prometheus: Poem of Fire&quot; in New York City in 1915. The instrument was supposed to be a keyboard, with notes corresponding to colors as given by Scriabin&#x27;s synesthetic system, specified in the score. However, numerous synesthesia researchers have cast doubt on the claim that Scriabin was a synesthete.

The &quot;Luce&quot; part is notated on a treble staff with two parts, one proceeding on the circle of fifths during the piece, the other following the tonal centre of the music.

== Overview ==
Scriabin assigned the following colors to the following key areas:


When the notes are ordered by the circle of fifths, the colours are in order of a spectrum, which leads numerous synesthesia researchers to argue that he did not experience the physiological condition of synesthesia. Additionally, it has been argued that Scriabin&#x27;s color associations were influenced by his theosophic readings and based on Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Optics&quot; quoted by Louis Bertrand Castel:

Scriabin was a friend of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, who was a synesthete. Scriabin&#x27;s assignments of colours to keys was not the same as Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s perceptions, which is not an indication that Scriabin was not a synesthete as all synesthetes perceive different associations. Scriabin was also heavily influenced by Theosophy, which had its own different system of associating colors and pitches (in essence going up the visible spectrum from C to B chromatically, rather than by fifths).

<text>Cornelius the First (died April 3, 2013) was a black rhinoceros at the Granby Zoo in Granby, Quebec, Canada. 

==Political candidature==
Cornelius was the nominal leader of the federal political party, the Rhinoceros Party of Canada from 1965 to 1993. The party attracted a considerable number of votes in Canadian elections 1979, 1980 and 1984, sometimes even coming in second place in some ridings, but never elected a candidate to the House of Commons of Canada.

The Party was inspired by Cacareco, a rhinoceros at the São Paulo zoo in Brazil, which was a candidate for the 1958 city council elections with the intention of protesting against political corruption. Electoral officials did not accept Cacareco&#x27;s candidacy, but he eventually won 100,000 votes, more than any other party in that election (which was also marked by rampant absenteeism). Today, the term &quot;Voto Cacareco&quot; (Cacareco vote) is commonly used to describe protest votes in Brazil.

During the Canadian federal election of 1984, the party made a major part of their platform declaring war on Belgium because a Belgian cartoon character, &quot;Tintin&quot;, killed a rhinoceros in one of the early works of the comics series. The party offered to call off the threatened Belgium-Canada war if Belgium delivered a case of mussels and a case of Belgian beer to Rhinoceros &quot;Hindquarters&quot; in Montreal (the Belgian Embassy in Ottawa went through with it).

==United States==
The Granby Zoo eventually traded Cornelius to the San Diego Zoo in exchange for a giraffe. The San Diego Zoo loaned him to the Caldwell Zoo, where he fathered an offspring on January 6, 2003.

==Death==
Cornelius died on April 3, 2013, at the Caldwell Zoo. A news report indicated he &quot;was suffering from pneumonia and mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was present in his lungs&quot;.

<text>Consolidated Edison, Inc., commonly known as Con Edison (stylized as conEdison) or ConEd, is one of the largest investor-owned energy companies in the United States, with approximately $12 billion in annual revenues as of 2017, and over $62 billion in assets. The company provides a wide range of energy-related products and services to its customers through its subsidiaries:
*Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (CECONY), a regulated utility providing electric and gas service in New York City and Westchester County, New York, and steam service in the borough of Manhattan;
*Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc., a regulated utility serving customers in a area in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey; and, 
*Con Edison Transmission, Inc., which invests in electric and natural gas transmission projects.

In 2015, electric revenues accounted for 70.35% of consolidated sales (70.55% in 2014); gas revenues 13.61% (14.96% in 2014); steam revenues 5.01% (4.86% in 2014); and non-utility revenues of 11.02% (9.63% in 2014).

==History==


In March 1823, Con Edison&#x27;s earliest corporate predecessor, the New York Gas Light Company, was founded by a consortium of New York City investors. A year later, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Due to the Board of Aldermen&#x27;s authority to grant franchises in the City of New York in the early to mid-19th century, interaction with Tammany Hall was required to expand the business. By William M. Tweed&#x27;s reign in the late 1860s as the boss of Tammany Hall, the power to authorize franchises lay with the County Board of Supervisors, of which Tweed had been a member. By 1871, Tweed was a member of the board of the Harlem Gas Light Company, a precursor to the Consolidated Edison Company. In 1884, six gas companies combined into the Consolidated Gas Company.

In 1901, the Consolidated Gas Company bought Edison Illuminating Company, which had been founded by Thomas Edison in 1880, first supplying electricity to 59 customers in a area in lower Manhattan. After the &quot;war of currents&quot;, more than 30 companies were generating and distributing electricity in New York City and Westchester County. But by 1920 there were far fewer, and Consolidated Gas&#x27;s electricity arm, now called the New York Edison Company, was the leader. In 1936, with electric sales far outstripping gas sales, the company incorporated and the name was changed to Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. 

The New York Steam Company began providing service in Lower Manhattan in 1882. Con Edison bought it in 1954, and now operates the largest commercial steam system in the world, providing steam service to nearly 1,600 commercial and residential establishments in Manhattan from Battery Park to 96th Street.

Consolidated Edison acquired or merged with more than a dozen companies between 1936 and 1960. Con Edison today is the result of acquisitions, dissolutions, and mergers of more than 170 individual electric, gas, and steam companies.

Consolidated Edison acquired land on the Hudson River in Buchanan, NY, in 1954 for the Indian Point nuclear power plant. The first reactor (Indian Point 1) began generating power on September 16, 1962. The reactor was shut down on October 31, 1974, because the emergency core cooling system did not meet regulatory requirements. The company built two more reactors at Indian Point during the 1970s: Indian Point 2 and 3. Indian Point 3 was sold to the New York Power Authority in 1975. Entergy acquired Indian Point 2 in November 2000, nine months after a steam generator leak. With the sale of Indian Point 2, the last power plant it owned, Consolidated Edison, Inc. became primarily an energy distributor.

On January 1, 1998, following the deregulation of the utility industry in New York State, a holding company, Consolidated Edison, Inc., was formed. It is one of the nation&#x27;s largest investor-owned energy companies, with approximately $13 billion in annual revenues and $47 billion in assets. The company provides a wide range of energy-related products and services to its customers through two regulated utility subsidiaries and three competitive energy businesses. Under several corporate names, the company has been traded on the NYSE without interruption since 1824—longer than any other NYSE stock. Its largest subsidiary, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., provides electric, gas, and steam service to more than 3 million customers in New York City and Westchester County, New York, an area of with a population of nearly 9 million. Also in 1998, Consolidated Edison, Inc. acquired Orange &amp; Rockland Utilities, which is operated separately.

Con Edison had invested $3 billion in solar and wind projects. In September 2017 it was announced that the company would invest $1.25 billion in &quot;renewable energy production facilities over the next three years.&quot;

The company&#x27;s &quot;renewable portfolio&quot; contained more than 1.5 gigawatts of operating capacity. Seventy-five percent of that capacity came from solar energy. Clean energy accounted for around eight percent of the company&#x27;s earnings, as of fall 2017. Con Edison sold its clean energy business to RWE in 2023.

==Systems==

=== Clean energy ===

To support electric vehicles, Con Edison partnered with the company FleetCarma to provide $500 in rewards to owners of electric vehicles in New York City and Westchester County, New York. Through this program, Con Edison pays customers to charge their vehicles when energy demand is low.

===Electrical===
The Con Edison electrical transmission system utilizes voltages of 138 kilovolts (kV), 345 kV, and 500 kV. The company has two 345 kV interconnections with upstate New York that enable it to import power from Hydro-Québec in Canada and one 345 kV interconnection each with Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&amp;G) in New Jersey and Long Island. Con Edison&#x27;s connection with Hydro-Québec is via a series of transmission lines owned by the New York Power Authority and neighboring utilities; a more direct connection via the Champlain Hudson Power Express HVDC line is expected to come online in 2025.

Con Edison is also interconnected with PSE&amp;G via the Branchburg-Ramapo 500 kV line. Con Ed&#x27;s distribution voltages are 33 kV, 27 kV, 13 kV, and 4 kV.

The of underground cable in the Con Edison system could wrap around the Earth 3.6 times. Nearly of overhead electric wires complement the underground system—enough cable to stretch between New York and Los Angeles 13 times.

===Gas===
The Con Edison gas system has nearly of pipes—if laid end to end, long enough to reach Paris and back to New York City, and serves Westchester County, the Bronx, Manhattan, and parts of Queens. Gas service in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the rest of Queens is provided by National Grid USA&#x27;s New York City operations, except the Rockaway peninsula, which is serviced by National Grid&#x27;s Long Island operations. The average volume of gas that travels through Con Edison&#x27;s gas system annually could fill the Empire State Building nearly 6,100 times.

===Steam===

Con Edison produces 30 billion pounds of steam each year through its seven power plants which boil water to before distributing it to hundreds of buildings in the New York City steam system, which is the biggest district steam system in the world. Steam traveling through the system is used to heat and cool some of New York&#x27;s most famous addresses, including the United Nations complex, the Empire State Building, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

===Metering===
The Smart Meter Project was awarded to Aclara Smart Grid Solutions (electric) and the majority of the rollout was completed in 2022 with several thousand meters still needing to be changed in 2023 due to customer access issues. ConEd utilized Aclara&#x27;s metering products for field installation. Over five million electric and gas meters were replaced in this project. Lime green-colored seals were used on electric meters to indicate that the meter was changed by a contractor.

==Programs and resources==
ConEd offers a variety of programs and resources for its customers and stakeholders, organized in such categories as, &quot;For Renters&quot;, &quot;For Residential Owners&quot;, &quot;For Small &amp; Medium Businesses&quot;, &quot;For Commercial &amp; Industrial&quot;, &quot;Business Partners&quot;, &quot;Investors&quot;, &quot;Community Affairs&quot;, and &quot;Municipalities&quot;. Examples of such resources include:
* CONCERN Program, which offers eligible customers a specially trained representative and advice about government aid programs, safety tips, and ways to save money on one&#x27;s energy bill
* Quarterly Billing Plan, which allows senior citizens, whose Con Edison bills are less than $420 a year, to receive bills once every three months (in March, June, September, and December), rather than once a month
* &quot;SPOTLIGHT&quot;, Con Edison&#x27;s newsletter

==Community partnerships==
Con Edison contributes substantial funding and volunteer hours to many non-profit organizations and learning centers including New York Botanical Garden, Hudson Valley Groundworks Science Barge, Teatown Reservation, Jay Heritage Center, and the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum.

==Major accidents and incidents==
* 1977: All of New York City, with the exception of the Rockaways - which get their power from the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCo) - was blacked out overnight on July 13 and 14, due to lightning strikes on a number of sub-stations and the resulting failures of interconnects in the power grid.
* 1989: A steam pipe explosion in Gramercy Park killed three, injured 24, and required the evacuation of a damaged apartment building due to high levels of asbestos in the air. Workers had failed to drain water from the pipe before turning the steam on. The utility also eventually pleaded guilty to lying about the absence of asbestos contamination, and paid a $2 million fine.
* 2001: The Con Edison electricity substation at 7 World Trade Center was destroyed on September 11th as a result of the collapse of Numbers 1 and 2 World Trade Center following a terrorist attack by Muslim extremists against the United States.
* 2004: In Manhattan, stray voltage killed East Village resident Jodie Lane and her dog when she stepped on a service box that wasn&#x27;t properly insulated. The corner of East 11th Street and 1st Avenue, where the incident occurred, was given the alternate name of Jodie Lane Place in 2005.
* 2006: After the blackout in Queens, the company was criticized by public officials for a poor record in the restoration of service to its customers.
* 2007: On July 18, an explosion occurred in midtown Manhattan near Grand Central Terminal when an 83-year-old Con Edison steam pipe failed, resulting in one death, over 40 injuries, as well as subway and surface disruptions.
* 2007: The day before Thanksgiving, an explosion critically burned Queens resident Kunta Oza when an 80-year-old cast iron gas main ruptured. Oza died on Thanksgiving Day, and her family later settled with Con Edison for $3.75 million.
* 2009: Another gas explosion claimed a life in Queens while Con Edison personnel were on the scene. There was a leak in a manhole and a fault in an electrical feeder at the same time. The fault in the feeder caused the explosion due to the sparks being generated. When the mechanic opened the manhole more oxygen entered and the explosion took place. Due to that event, Con Edison has changed its procedure on outside gas leak calls.
* 2012: 
** On October 29, flooding from Hurricane Sandy caused a transformer explosion at a Con-Ed plant on New York City&#x27;s East Side.
** During the storm, Con Edison used social media to get outage and restoration information out to customers. The company&#x27;s Twitter account gained an extra 16,000 followers during the storm. 
** Con Edison&#x27;s subsidiary, Orange &amp; Rockland Utilities, was criticized for its response to Hurricane Sandy. Some customers experienced a loss of electrical power for 11 days.
* 2014: On March 12, two apartment buildings exploded in East Harlem after a reported Con Edison gas leak. Eight people were killed in the massive explosion that reduced the conjoining buildings to rubble.
* 2018: After 9 p.m. on December 27, a transformer short-circuit at a ConEd power plant in Astoria, Queens shut down La Guardia Airport for several hours - until it switched to back-up generators - caused extensive delays on the #7 subway line, and an outage on Rikers Island, until it, too, reverted to back-up equipment. The incident caused a large portion of the sky in the surrounding area to be lit up by blue light that was caused by arc flashes, in which light-emitting atoms of excited gas, called plasma, are projected into the air. The arc flashes probably lasted only a few minutes, but because of meteorological conditions which caused them to be refracted, they were seen across a large portion of the New York City metropolitan area. There was no explosion or fire connected to the electrical surge, and no reported injuries. The New York Police Department reported that 911 calls increased from 500 in the half-hour before the event to over 3,200 in the 30 minutes afterwards. ConEd is investigating the cause of the surge in equipment that was intended to monitor voltage in the electrical sub-station, but suspects that the problem was a malfunctioning of its relay system. The lights were nicknamed the &quot;Astoria Borealis&quot; on Twitter.
*2019: On the night of July 13 a significant portion of Manhattan saw a blackout due to a Consolidated Edison cable that burnt out in a transformer on West End Avenue. The blackout, which lasted for about three hours, shut down a number of subway stations, much of the West Side from the 40s to 72nd Street, parts of Times Square and Rockefeller Center, and other areas, resulting in an estimated 73,000 customers losing power. The outage fell on the anniversary of the 1977 blackout, where most of the city lost power.
*2020: During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, 170 Con Edison employees tested positive for COVID-19 and three died. Consolidated Edison said they would not shut off service due to non-payment related to the health crisis and would waive any new late-payment charges for customers.

==Bribery prosecution==
On January 14, 2009, eleven Con Edison supervisors were arrested for demanding more than $1 million in kickbacks related to work done by a construction company that was repairing the Midtown steam pipe eruption of 2007. According to federal prosecutors, the employees had approved payment for work that was unnecessary or not performed and promised faster payment for some work performed by the construction company in exchange for the bribes. The FBI had two retired Con Edison employees and the president of the construction company wear recording devices that recorded the suspects demanding bribes of between $1000 and $5000. Later that year Con Edison sued Brendan Maher, one of the construction supervisors who was arrested and later admitted to taking bribes that the utility company claimed amounted to $10,000.

In April 2016, Con Edison agreed to pay over $171 million, about 1.5% of its annual revenue, back to its customers in compensation for harm resulting from the bribery. The Public Service Commission had found that Con Edison failed to supervise the employees. Con Edison admitted no wrongdoing.

==Honors and criticism==
● In March 2002, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine named the company as one of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Admired Companies&quot; in the publication&#x27;s newest corporate ranking survey. In 2003, Con Edison ranked second on the top ten list for electric and gas utilities.

● In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign released a report criticizing ConEd for spending $1.8 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $127 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $4.2 billion, and increasing executive pay by 82% to $17.4 million in 2010 for its top five executives.

● In 2014, Con Edison was named the #1 utility and #16 overall among corporations, in &quot;Newsweek″s&quot; Green Rankings, and one of the 50 best companies for Latinas by &quot;Latina Style Magazine&quot;. In its &quot;Best of the Best&quot; issue in 2015, &quot;Hispanic Network Magazine&quot; named the company a top employer among energy, gas, and oil companies. Con Edison was also selected as one of the top regional utilities by &quot;DiversityInc&quot; magazine in 2014. In 2016, the company was listed among America&#x27;s best large employers by &quot;Forbes&quot;.

● In February 2021, The Energy and Policy Institute criticized Con Edison for touting clean energy while investing in Gas Infrastructure. This is unclean fracked gas. (Fracked gas is methane gas produced by hydraulic fracturing.) The article explained,
&quot;A recent analysis of utility executive compensation by the Energy and Policy Institute found that Con Edison’s executive compensation policies include renewable energy growth as components of broader goals, but do not reward executives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

==Stop tags==
When a New York City contractor is unable to repair a reported nonfunctioning or malfunctioning street light, traffic light or pedestrian Walk/Don&#x27;t Walk light because of a failure in the power to the affected unit, a stop tag is assigned by &quot;Con Ed&quot;. When a caller to NYC&#x27;s 311 asks for followup information about a reported outage, they&#x27;re told the &quot;stop tag&quot; number, and told to call &quot;Con Ed&quot; at 800-752-6633 (800-75-CON-ED).

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that it can take over two years for some repairs. Sometimes an entire fixture must be removed, repaired, then returned. Other times the streets must be torn up to replace underground wiring. Temporary fixes, using what was described as &quot;nothing more than overhead extension cords&quot; (called &quot;Shunts&quot;) at times are left in place for an extended period. In 2017 Con Ed committed to repair &quot;at least 90% ... within 90 days.&quot;

==Adaptive re-use of former Con Ed buildings==
A former Con Edison building on West 53rd Street in Manhattan was converted first into the studio for the television game show &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, and later into a recording studio called &quot;Power Station&quot; because of its Edison history. In 1996, the studio was renamed Avatar Studios and then in 2017 back to &quot;Power Station&quot;.

In 1978, Con Edison sold the Excelsior Power Company Building, a former substation on Gold Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District. It was renovated into an apartment building, and became a New York City designated landmark in 2016.

<text>Antoine-Denis Chaudet (; 3 March 1763 – 19 April 1810) was a French sculptor who worked in the neoclassical style. He was born and died in Paris.

==Life and work==
He began his artistic training as a student of Jean-Baptiste Stouf at the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. In 1784 his bas-relief, &quot;Joseph Sold into Slavery by His Brothers&quot;, was awarded the Prix-de-Rome. This enabled him to study at the French Academy in Rome, where he spent four years studying ancient sculpture. 

On his return to France in 1789, he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. In 1801 he took part in illustrating an edition of the collected works of Jean Racine, published by Firmin Didot. Most of these were Biblical scenes. Around that same time, he married one of his students, Jeanne-Elisabeth Gabiou. He also collaborated with Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine and Charles Percier on architectural projects. 

In 1805, he became a member of the Institute of France. In February 1810, he took the post of Professor-Rector at the École des Beaux-Arts, replacing Louis-Jean-François Lagrenée, who had died several years before. He died himself, only two months later. He was interred at the Montparnasse Cemetery. The Louvre holds collections of his sketches and manuscript notes.

In 1812, Napoleon transported Chaudet&#x27;s marble statue of him to Moscow, to install it in a prominent place there. It is currently on display at the .

<text>The Piano Sonata No. 9, Op. 68, commonly known as the &quot;Black Mass&quot; Sonata, is one of the late piano sonatas composed by Alexander Scriabin. The work was written around 1912–1913. Although its nickname was not invented by Scriabin (unlike the nickname &quot;White Mass&quot; given to his Seventh Sonata), he approved of it.

== Structure and content ==
The ninth sonata is a single movement. It typically lasts 8–10 minutes, and is marked as follows:

: Moderato quasi andante – Molto meno vivo – Allegro molto – Alla marcia – Allegro – Presto – Tempo primo

Like Scriabin&#x27;s other late works, the piece is highly chromatic. The &quot;Black Mass&quot; Sonata is particularly dissonant because many of its themes are based around an interval of a minor ninth, one of the most unstable sounds. Its marking &#x27;legendaire&#x27; exactly captures the sense of distant mysterious wailing which grows in force and menace. The opening theme is constantly transformed, from the early trill arpeggio&#x27;s sounding unsettling and then completely shifting, eventually tumbling in rapid cascades into a grotesque march. Scriabin builds a continuous structure of mounting complexity and tension, and pursues the combination of themes with unusual tenacity, eventually reaching a climax as harsh as anything in his music. The piece ends with the original theme reinstated.

Like Scriabin&#x27;s other sonatas, it is both technically and musically highly demanding for the pianist, sometimes extending to three staves as opposed to the standard two used in piano music.

== Recordings ==
One of Scriabin&#x27;s better-known works, the ninth sonata has been recorded and performed extensively, notably by Vladimir Horowitz, Vladimir Sofronitsky, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Sviatoslav Richter, Andrej Hoteev, Garrick Ohlsson, Burkard Schliessmann and Pietro Scarpini.

<text>The Piano Sonata No. 7, Op. 64, subtitled Messe Blanche (White Mass), was written by Alexander Scriabin in 1911. As one of the late piano sonatas of Scriabin&#x27;s career, the music is highly chromatic and almost atonal. George Perle says that, &quot;the primary set upon which the &quot;Seventh Sonata&quot; is based,&quot; is, in linear order as spelled by Scriabin, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, and that the mystic chord may be derived from the quartal spelling of this set (with D and without G).

==Background==
The &quot;White Mass&quot; is closely related to its predecessor, the sixth sonata. Both works were written in 1911–12 and have structurally and stylistically more in common than any other pair of Scriabin sonatas. Scriabin reportedly feared the sixth sonata, considering the work to be corrupted by demonic forces and going so far as to refuse to play the work in public. Scriabin composed his seventh sonata as an exorcism against the darkness of the sixth sonata, subtitling the work &quot;White Mass&quot; in order to reflect its celestial nature. He intended the mood of the piece to be ecstatic, evoking images of winged flight, voluptuous rapture and overwhelming forces.

The composer was especially fond of the piece, probably due to its messianic context and perfected structure, which features more contrast, rhythmic and dynamic, than most of his work. Like the second sonata however, the &quot;White Mass&quot; gave him a great deal of trouble during its composition. 

The &quot;White Mass Sonata&quot; is not structurally directly related to Scriabin&#x27;s ninth sonata, which was composed in 1912–13 and would later earn the nickname &quot;Black Mass Sonata&quot;.

==Structure and content==

The piece consists of a single movement, lasting around 10–13 minutes, and is marked &quot;Allegro,&quot; although the &quot;Allegro&quot; marking was added later by the publisher. The original tempo marking in Scriabin&#x27;s hand at the top of the autograph score is &quot;Prophétique.&quot; Additional markings provide clues to the different moods Scriabin intended to convey throughout the work, such as &quot;mystérieusement sonore&quot; (mysteriously sonorous), or &quot;avec une sombre majesté&quot; (with a dark majesty). Like the sixth, the seventh sonata is full of violent contrasts, complex counterpoint, advanced tritonal harmonies, and rippling, incandescent arpeggios. The theme marked &quot;avec une céleste volupté&quot; (with a heavenly voluptuousness) melodically presents a harmony that recurs throughout the sonata. Another recurring harmony is presented by the theme marked &quot;étincelant&quot; (sparkling). Passages throughout the sonata imitate lightning, clouds of perfume, and distant bells. The chords imitating the ringing of bells were a favourite of Scriabin&#x27;s, and they provide another harmony that recurs throughout the work (two minor thirds separated by a minor sixth). According to Leonid Sabaneyev, when Scriabin himself played these chords, the ringing sounded from near and afar at the same time; a part of them sounded very real, while another sounded like an echo. There is also a significant five-octave arpeggiated chord at the end, representing a flash of blinding light. The music that follows surges upward in register until the end of the sonata where it dissipates, representing &quot;enervation and nonexistence after the act of love.&quot;

==Performance history==

The White Mass sonata is one of Scriabin&#x27;s most advanced works. Notable Scriabin masters such as Vladimir Horowitz and Vladimir Sofronitsky did not play or record the piece. However, Sviatoslav Richter performed it a number of times throughout his career, and played it on tours as late as 1994.
