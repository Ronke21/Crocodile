<text>The Piano Sonata No. 8, Op. 66, by Alexander Scriabin, was composed between 1912 and 1913. As one of Scriabin&#x27;s late piano sonatas, the eighth sonata features non-tertian harmony, though is arguably less dissonant than some of his other late works. Like Scriabin&#x27;s other late piano sonatas, the eighth sonata reflects the composer&#x27;s mystical interests. Scriabin saw some parts of this sonata, which, like the sixth sonata, he never performed in public, as &quot;the most tragic episode of my creative work&quot;.

==Structure and content==
The eighth sonata consists of a single movement, and performances range from 10 minutes (Michael Ponti) to 18 1/2 minutes (Vladimir Stoupel).

#Lento - Allegro agitato

This work is regarded as one of Scriabin&#x27;s most difficult pieces. It is the longest of Scriabin&#x27;s sonatas by pages, and many passages are written on three and four staves to a system, as opposed to the typical two staves, to accommodate the complex counterpoint and large intervallic spaces. The character of the eighth sonata is perhaps consciously less extreme than that of the Sixth and Seventh, with fewer aggressive dissonances than the former and climaxes that do not explode with the extreme reckless energy of the latter.

The eighth sonata begins with almost disquieting placidity as a series of muted bell-like chords are sounded. This languid episode deciduates quite quickly into passages of agitated energy. There are none of the characteristic instructions common in Scriabin&#x27;s other late sonatas. The furthest he goes is the word &quot;Tragique&quot; to indicate moments of distressed apathy and futility. In other respects, this is one of Scriabin&#x27;s more formally experimental sonatas. It is rather episodic, with passages appearing at times to be sewn together almost arbitrarily, like the &quot;presto&quot; section which begins with staccato chords &#x27;bouncing away&#x27; from the previous theme. There are definite moments of serenity (indeed this is the prevailing mood of the sonata), but a large portion of the music seems urgent and fervid. The composer Boris Asafiev argued that the themes in the piece represent natural elements 

Like his sixth sonata, Scriabin never performed this sonata in public. He considered parts of it &quot;the most tragic episode of my creative work&quot;, and described its harmony as &quot;drawn from nature, as if it had existed before&quot;. Stravinsky described the piece as &quot;incomparable.&quot;

<text>The Ohio Rhineland () is a German cultural region of Ohio. It was named by Rhinelanders and other Germans who settled the area in the mid-19th century. They named the canal &quot;the Rhine&quot; in reference to the river Rhine in Germany, and the newly settled area north of the canal as &quot;Over the Rhine&quot;.

An early reference to the canal as &quot;the Rhine&quot; appears in the 1853 book &quot;White, Red, Black&quot;, in which traveler Ferenc Pulszky wrote, &quot;The Germans live all together across the Miami Canal, which is, therefore, here jocosely called the &#x27;Rhine.&#x27; &quot; In 1875 writer Daniel J. Kenny referred to the area exclusively as &quot;Over the Rhine.&quot; He noted, &quot;Germans and Americans alike love to call the district &#x27;Over the Rhine.&#x27; &quot;

The Miami and Erie Canal was a canal that ran from Cincinnati to Toledo, Ohio, creating a water route between the Ohio River and Lake Erie. Construction on the canal began in 1825 and was completed in 1845 at a cost to the state government of $8 million ($ million in ). At its peak, it included 19 aqueducts, three guard locks, 103 canal locks, multiple feeder canals, and a few man-made water reservoirs. The canal climbed above Lake Erie and above the Ohio River to reach a topographical peak called the Loramie Summit, which extended between New Bremen, Ohio to lock 1-S in Lockington, north of Piqua, Ohio. Boats up to 80 feet long were towed along the canal by mules, horses, or oxen walking on a prepared towpath along the bank, at a rate of four to five miles per hour.

Due to competition from railroads, which began to be built in the area in the 1850s, the commercial use of the canal gradually declined during the late 19th century. It was permanently abandoned for commercial use in 1913 after a historic flood in Ohio severely damaged it. Only a small fraction of the canal survives today, along with its towpath and locks.

==History==

When Ohio became a state in 1803, transportation to and within the state was difficult; settlers largely moved themselves and their goods on rivers and Lake Erie, for most roads were poor. In addition, Ohio was geographically separated from the East Coast by the barrier of the Appalachian Mountains. This made life difficult for early citizens because goods from the Atlantic Coast and Europe were difficult to obtain and often very expensive due to transportation costs. For the same reasons, it was difficult for Ohio businessmen and farmers to sell their products to markets outside the state. Some entrepreneurs began to ship goods from Ohio down the Ohio River to New Orleans, by sailing ship and keelboats, but the journey was long and costly. Even after steamboats arrived, it was difficult to return vessels upriver.

High shipping costs severely limited trade and population growth in the state, especially in areas far from natural waterways such as Lake Erie or the Ohio River, which bounded the state on the north and south, respectively.

To overcome these obstacles, many people, including George Washington and several other politicians, expressed early support for a national canal system to connect many of the country&#x27;s waterways. In 1807, Senator Thomas Worthington of Ohio (who later became governor) asked the Secretary of the Treasury for funds to improve roads and build canals in Ohio, yet did not have much success. At the time, many prominent leaders in the Democratic Republican Party believed that such improvements should be built not by the national government but by the individual states. The United States Congress approved national canal legislation in 1817, 1822, and 1830, but each bill was vetoed by the sitting president.

Consequently, the burden of building canals passed to the states. The Erie Canal in New York proved to be an early success after it was completed in 1825. The Ohio House and Senate had worked for two decades to pass legislation authorizing a canal, gaining success with the Act of February 4, 1825, which finally approved the construction of the Ohio canal system. The canal was largely state-funded, using money acquired from selling off land near where the canals were to be dug. The state government planned and built two canals in the state: the Miami and Erie Canal, from Cincinnati to Toledo, connecting the Ohio River and Lake Erie; and the Ohio and Erie Canal, which connected Cleveland, another lake port, to Portsmouth, Ohio, on the Ohio River. This system provided the interior of Ohio with new travel routes that effectively extended to the major Atlantic port of New York City, as merchants could ship goods through Lake Erie, the Erie Canal, and the Hudson River to New York.

===Construction===

Because Ohio is not entirely flat, the system of locks had to be designed to act as a staircase so boats could navigate the difference in elevation. To supply water for the canal, manmade reservoirs such as Grand Lake St. Marys and Lake Loramie in Shelby County were constructed, along with several feeder canals. Indian Lake in Logan County was greatly enlarged to provide a steadier supply of water for the Sidney feeder canal.

Branch canals were built to serve as extensions from the main canal. The Warren County Canal, was a branch canal constructed from the Miami and Erie Canal at Middletown to Lebanon. This branch was opened in 1840, but remained in operation less than 15 years before being abandoned. A short branch, the Sidney or Port Jefferson feeder canal ran up the Miami Valley from Lockington through Sidney to a dam just upstream from Port Jefferson.

The following list includes measurement standards for the canal, although these varied by region of the state.
* water depth.
* wide at water level.
* wide towpath in addition to mandated outer slopes.
* All slopes are horizontal to . perpendicular.
* The canal could accommodate boats up to long and wide. &lt;

===Decline and abandonment===
The Miami and Erie never proved to be as profitable as the state government had hoped, as within several years of being completed to Lake Erie it had to compete with railroads. These offered greater speed and capacity for both passengers and goods. Factors limiting the canal&#x27;s success included the lower population and level of economic development in Ohio, compared to that of New York when its canal was completed. Second, while New York had one canal that was located at the bottleneck of Great Lakes trade, Ohio had two canals, which spread usage too thinly. Third, was the expense of building and maintaining the canals. While the Erie Canal was 363 miles in length, with an elevation change of 700 feet, the combined length of Ohio&#x27;s canals was 557 miles, with an elevation change of 2,096 feet. Compared to operations of the Erie Canal, the Ohio canal system had less trade and fewer passengers, while it had to operate over a longer length, and at a greater expense.

The canal was completed just before most of the railroads in Ohio were built, and it had to compete directly with railroads for the remainder of its operation. Due to the canal freezing over in the winter, as well as the slowness of the boats, the canal was less practical than railroads, especially for perishable goods and passenger traffic. Although the canal services were often cheaper than the railroads, particularly for bulk cargoes such as grain and salted pork, the canal had largely ceased to operate by 1906. The catastrophic Great Dayton Flood of 1913 and the subsequent flood control measures constructed by the Miami Conservancy District destroyed much of the canal infrastructure along the southern portion of the route, where it paralleled the Great Miami River. The canal was permanently abandoned. What was not destroyed was no longer maintained, and slowly many of the remaining locks and sections of canal were destroyed, with the open canal filled in.

Much of the original towpath was redeveloped as the right-of-way for the Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad, an electric interurban streetcar that operated until 1938. Part of the right-of-way was converted to the Wright-Lockland Highway (now part of Interstate 75). From 1920 to 1925, six million dollars was spent to use the bed of the canal to build a downtown subway in Cincinnati. The surface was later paved over to form Central Parkway, as funds ran out before the Cincinnati Subway could be completed. In the central and northern regions, a large portion of the canal was destroyed when it was filled in to create parts of I-75, U.S. Route 24, and State Route 25. Some smaller portions of right-of-way have been converted to bike trails for recreational and local commuting use.

===Legacy===

Although urban development has destroyed most vestiges of the canal, some locks and sections of the waterway have survived. One of the original locks (#17) is located in the Carillon Historical Park in Dayton. An unrestored but complete lock (#15) is located just off Main Street (State Route 571) in Tipp City. Remains of the Excello lock are located in the Butler County &quot;Excello Locks Park&quot; near the intersection of State Route 73 and South Hamilton Middletown Road in Lemon Township. The massive west abutment of the Old Nine-mile Aqueduct over the Great Miami River is still present approximately upstream of the Taylorsville Dam east of Vandalia (Montgomery County). The abutment terminates a fairly intact canal segment that extends at least north to Tipp City. This segment includes an intact concrete weir near the abandoned Vandalia water treatment plant (aka &quot;Tadmore Station&quot;) and a ruined lock (#16, &quot;Picayune&quot;) about halfway to Tipp City along Canal Road.

On the canal&#x27;s southern end, a drained section is located in St. Bernard, Ohio&#x27;s Ludlow Park, where the canal bed is still visible. The canal remains in water (and navigable for canoes or kayaks) in the rural region between Delphos and St. Marys, Ohio. South of St. Mary&#x27;s, it has degraded to form a shallow ditch in most places, with some ruined locks remaining. From north to south along State Route 66, sections of the original canal are visible in Delphos, at a small historic park located at the Deep Cut in Spencerville, Lock Two (a hamlet mostly consisting of period brick buildings), New Bremen, Minster, Fort Loramie, and Piqua. The Miami and Erie Canal Deep Cut was designated in 1964 as a U.S. National Historic Landmark near Spencerville. The Piqua Historical Area features a replica canal boat and other related items.

Anthony Wayne Trail (part of U.S. Route 24 and State Route 25) in and around Toledo, originally named Canal Boulevard, was built on the canal right-of-way, and various relics of the canal survive along the corridor.

Much of the canal corridor continues as a prosperous manufacturing area; today Interstate 75 and railroads provide the chief transportation means. An historical reenactment of the Miami-Erie canal days is held during summer and early fall months at Providence Metropark along the Maumee River just west of Toledo near Grand Rapids. Historical actors dress and act as if it is 1876 during the months of May–October. Two mules pull the canal boat titled &quot;The Volunteer,&quot; while workers man the tiller and provide commentary to the passengers. Providence Metroparks boasts using original lock 44 as part of the tour. That lock is the only working lock in the state of Ohio. The northern portion of the towpath (from Fort Loramie to Delphos and beyond) is used as a hiking trail.

<text>William Lindsay White (June 17, 1900 – July 26, 1973) was an American journalist, foreign correspondent, and writer. He succeeded his father, William Allen White, as editor and publisher of the &quot;Emporia Gazette&quot; in 1944. Among White&#x27;s most noteworthy books are &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; (1942) and &quot;Lost Boundaries&quot; (1948), which was adapted into the film &quot;Lost Boundaries&quot; in 1949.

==Early life==
William Lindsay White was the only son of William Allen and Sallie White, born in Emporia, Kansas on June 17, 1900. He had a younger sister, Mary, who was killed in a horse-riding accident at the age of 16 in May 1921. White grew up in Emporia, and worked as a teenager as a reporter for the &quot;Gazette&quot;. He attended the nearby University of Kansas, and then transferred to and graduated from Harvard College in 1924. He participated in the theatrical activities of the Hasty Pudding Club while at Harvard, co-authoring the book and lyrics of the organization&#x27;s 1924 show.

The elder White groomed his only surviving child for work in journalism, hoping for his son to succeed him as editor of the &quot;Emporia Gazette&quot;. He took his 18-year-old son to France to witness the signing of the Treaty of Versailles ending World War I. William Allen White eventually persuaded his son to return to Emporia. Shortly before his father&#x27;s death in 1944, William Lindsay White took over the &quot;Emporia Gazette&quot;.

White attended Harvard and there picked up an English accent. Upon his return to Emporia, he wore a monocle and was one of the best-dressed men in the nation

==Career==
He served as associate publisher of the &quot;Gazette&quot; in the early 1930s. White worked for the &quot;Washington Post&quot; in 1935 and for &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in 1937. In 1939 he became a war correspondent for the Columbia Broadcasting System and a consortium of 40 newspapers. The National Headliners Club awarded him its prize for best European broadcast of the year for his editorial &quot;The Last Christmas Tree&quot; from the Mannerheim Line in Finland in 1940. He reported from London in 1940 and 1941 for the North American Newspaper Association and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. In 1942 he became roving editor for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

As editor and publisher of the &quot;Emporia Gazette&quot; beginning in 1944, White fought many battles with the city. When the old courthouse needed repairs, the city decided to build a new one instead. White led a campaign to repair the old courthouse and lost. He later angered the local chamber of commerce by opposing tax breaks for companies that relocated to Emporia. He opposed urban renewal schemes that benefited real estate interests and merchants in downtown Emporia rather than the poor in need of housing.

White was also a radio correspondent for CBS News, sometimes filling in for Edward R. Murrow. For most of his later career, William Lindsay White was Roving Editor for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and published numerous articles in that magazine.

White was also actively involved in politics. He served in the Kansas House of Representatives in 1931 and 1932. White also drummed up support for Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s run for the Presidency in 1952 and supported his friend Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidential campaign. When Bob Dole first ran for the United States Senate, White threw a dinner party at the Broadview Hotel and invited most of the Eastern Kansas Republican leaders. The dinner was pivotal to the success of Dole&#x27;s first campaign.

He wrote 14 books during the course of his career, beginning in 1938 with &quot;What People Said&quot; (1938), which examined the Kansas bond scandal. In 1944, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described three of his earliest titles as best-sellers: &quot;They Were Expendable&quot;, &quot;Queens Die Proudly&quot;, and &quot;Journey for Margaret&quot;. All were based on his experience as a war correspondent. Three of his books were adapted into feature Hollywood films: &quot;They Were Expendable&quot;, &quot;Journey for Margaret&quot;, and &quot;Lost Boundaries&quot;, based on the true story of Dr. Albert C. Johnston and his African Americans family passing as white in New England. &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; was a Book of the Month Club selection, as well.

He served for a time as an overseer of Harvard. He was elected to the board of the American Civil Liberties Union in 1950. He became an officer of a group formed to aid Russian refugees in 1951, the American Committee for Freedom for the Peoples of the U.S.S.R.

==Personal life==
White&#x27;s wife Kathrine was born in Cawker City, Kansas, and worked on the editorial staff at &quot;Time&quot; magazine before her marriage. The couple wed on April 29, 1931, in St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The couple maintained a residence in Emporia, and a brownstone in New York City in which they lived for half the year.

White died of cancer in 1973 in Newman Memorial County Hospital in Emporia. His widow and a daughter survived him. Just before his death, the Emporia city commission renamed the 1940 Civic Auditorium in his honor.

==Legacy==
After White&#x27;s death, a memorial fund was established in his name to plant more trees in Emporia. By the turn of the century, more than 300 trees had been planted with money from this fund. There is also a bronze bust and a sample of his writing in White Memorial Park at Sixth Avenue and Merchant Street in Emporia.

<doc id="899341" wikidata="Q7401986" url="?curid=899341" title="Saint Patrick's Church (Dubuque, Iowa)">
<text>Saint Patrick&#x27;s Church is a Catholic parish in the Archdiocese of Dubuque, and is located at 15th and Iowa Streets, Dubuque, Iowa, United States. The church and rectory were included as contributing properties in the Jackson Park Historic District that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. St. Patrick&#x27;s Church is located two blocks away from St. Mary&#x27;s Church. The reason for the close proximity of the two parishes was that St. Mary was originally built for service to German families of Dubuque, and St. Patrick&#x27;s provided services for the Irish settlers to Dubuque.

==History==

The parish was founded in 1852 as a mission of St. Raphael Cathedral. The parish buildings were built on land that Bishop Mathias Loras had purchased when it was offered for sale by the Federal government. Originally, a wood-frame building was used as a church building, and was located at what is now the front of the rectory. The first church was dedicated by Bishop Loras in 1853. St. Patrick&#x27;s became an independent parish five years later when the Rev. Patrick McCabe was assigned as the first resident pastor. The cornerstone of the present brick church was laid in 1877, and the building dedicated on August 15, 1878. In 1928, the Rev. J.J. Hanley remodeled and enlarged the church.

St. Patrick Church was originally built for service to the Irish settlers of Dubuque and while the parish has maintained a healthy respect for its Irish heritage over its many years of service, the parish now specializes in service to the Hispanic residents of Dubuque. The parish offers a Spanish Mass on Sundays, and the offices of Hispanic ministry are also located at the parish. From 1995 to 2008 a pastoral administrator led the St. Patrick&#x27;s congregation. During that same time, from 1999 to 2010, St. Patrick&#x27;s was clustered with St. Mary&#x27;s Parish. St. Mary&#x27;s closed in May 2010 and St. Patrick&#x27;s was clustered with St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral at that time.

==Architecture==

St. Patrick&#x27;s Church was designed by Dubuque architect John Keenan in the Gothic Revival style. It is a brick structure built on a Dubuque stone foundation. It features a central tower that is capped with a crown. The main entrance has been altered in subsequent years, but it fits in with the older structure. The church building is seven bays long with the seventh bay on the south end forming a sort of transept. The bays are divided by brick buttresses and each bay contains a paired lancet window. The interior is divided into three naves.

The rectory was built in the 1880s to the rear of the church. It is a three-story brick residence capped with a mansard roof. The original porch has been replaced with a single-story addition. Other additions have also been added on the west side of the house.

A school building, no longer extant, was built immediately west of the church. It was replaced by a three-story structure in 1951 on the corner of West 15th and Main Streets. The parish sold the building in 2006. It is not considered an historic structure.

==Schools==
St. Patrick&#x27;s Parish had a parochial school for boys established after 1870, while girls attended St. Joseph Academy. St. Patrick&#x27;s School merged with St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic School to form Downtown Catholic School in 1982. The organization Holy Family Catholic Schools took control of Downtown Catholic and other Dubuque-area Catholic schools in 2001. Downtown Catholic and Sacred Heart – Holy Trinity School became St. Francis School in 2002, and St. Francis closed in 2004. Four Oaks Family and Children Services bought the school building in 2006.

<text>Georges de La Tour (13 March 1593 – 30 January 1652) was a French Baroque painter, who spent most of his working life in the Duchy of Lorraine, which was temporarily absorbed into France between 1641 and 1648. He painted mostly religious chiaroscuro scenes lit by candlelight.

==Personal life==

Georges de La Tour was born in the town of Vic-sur-Seille in the Diocese of Metz, which was technically part of the Holy Roman Empire, but had been ruled by France since 1552. Baptism documentation revealed that he was the son of Jean de La Tour, a baker, and Sybille de La Tour, née Molian. It has been suggested that Sybille came from a partly noble family. His parents had seven children in all, with Georges being the second-born. 

La Tour&#x27;s educational background remains somewhat unclear, but it is assumed that he traveled either to Italy or the Netherlands early in his career. He may possibly have trained under Jacques Bellange in Nancy, the capital of Lorraine, although their styles are very different. His paintings reflect the Baroque naturalism of Caravaggio, but this probably reached him through the Dutch &quot;Caravaggisti&quot; of the Utrecht School and other Northern (French and Dutch) contemporaries. In particular, La Tour is often compared to the Dutch painter Hendrick Terbrugghen. 

In 1617 he married Diane Le Nerf, from a minor noble family, and in 1620 he established his studio in her quiet provincial home-town of Lunéville, part of the independent Duchy of Lorraine which was occupied by France, during his lifetime, in the period 1641–1648. He painted mainly religious and some genre scenes. He was given the title &quot;Painter to the King&quot; (of France) in 1638, and he also worked for the Dukes of Lorraine in 1623–4, but the local bourgeoisie provided his main market, and he achieved a certain affluence. He is not recorded in Lunéville between 1639 and 1642, and may have traveled again; Anthony Blunt detected the influence of Gerrit van Honthorst in his paintings after this point. He was involved in a Franciscan-led religious revival in Lorraine, and over the course of his career he moved to painting almost entirely religious subjects, but in treatments with influence from &quot;genre&quot; painting. 

Georges de La Tour and his family died in 1652 in an epidemic in Lunéville. His son Étienne (1621–1692) was his pupil.

La Tour&#x27;s early work shows influences from Caravaggio, probably via his Dutch followers, and the genre scenes of cheats—as in &quot;The Fortune Teller&quot;—and fighting beggars clearly derive from the Dutch Caravaggisti, and probably also his fellow-Lorrainer, Jacques Bellange. These are believed to date from relatively early in his career. 

La Tour is best known for the nocturnal light effects which he developed much further than his artistic predecessors had done, and transferred their use in the genre subjects in the paintings of the Dutch &quot;Caravaggisti&quot; to religious painting in his. Unlike Caravaggio his religious paintings lack dramatic effects. He painted these in a second phase of his style, perhaps beginning in the 1640s, using chiaroscuro, careful geometrical compositions, and very simplified painting of forms. His work moves during his career towards greater simplicity and stillness—taking from Caravaggio very different qualities than Jusepe de Ribera and his Tenebrist followers did. 
 
He often painted several variations on the same subjects, and his surviving output is relatively small. His son Étienne was his pupil, and distinguishing between their work in versions of La Tour&#x27;s compositions is difficult. The version of the &quot;Education of the Virgin&quot; in the Frick Collection in New York is an example, as the Museum itself admits. Another group of paintings (example left), of great skill but claimed to be different in style to those of La Tour, have been attributed to an unknown &quot;Hurdy-gurdy Master&quot;. All show older male figures (one group in Malibu includes a female), mostly solitary, either beggars or saints.

After his death at Lunéville in 1652, La Tour&#x27;s work was forgotten until rediscovered in 1915 by Hermann Voss, a German art historian who would later become head of Hitler&#x27;s Führermuseum; some of La Tour&#x27;s work had in fact been confused with Vermeer, when the Dutch artist underwent his own rediscovery in the nineteenth century.

<text>The Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) was the U.S. Navy&#x27;s material-support organization for naval aviation from 1921 to 1959. The bureau had &quot;cognizance&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, responsibility) for the design, procurement, and support of naval aircraft and related systems. Aerial weapons, however, were under the cognizance of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd).

==Origins==

The USN&#x27;s first attempt for naval aviation began in 1908 when it conducted observations of the Wright Brothers aircraft at Fort Myer.

==First tests and Naval Aviation Corps==

The first test of an aircraft from naval vessel was in 1910 when a Curtiss Model D flown by Eugene Burton Ely took off from the USS Birmingham (CL-2) and again on USS Pennsylvania (ACR-4) in early 1911. These tests were enough for the USN to establish naval aviation units in the summer of 1911. The purchase of the first naval aircraft in May 1911 and passage of naval appropriations act in August 1916 lead to the establishment of the Naval Reserve Flying Corps, which would train and deploy air corps for World War I.

==Formal Organization of Naval Aviation==

Congress established BuAer in 1921 in order to create a single organizational home for naval aviation. Prior to 1921, cognizance for aviation had been divided among various Navy bureaus and other organizations. The first Chief of BuAer was Rear Admiral William A. Moffett (1869–1933), a Medal of Honor recipient and battleship commander who had long supported the development of naval aviation. He served as bureau chief from 1921 until his death in 1933, in the crash of the airship &quot;USS Akron&quot; (ZRS-4). Working closely with RADM Moffett, CAPT Henry C. Mustin (1874–1923) served as BuAer&#x27;s first Assistant Chief helping lead naval aviation to the forefront of American military strength.

A talented administrator, Moffett ensured the continued independence of naval aviation during the 1920s, when Army Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell and others sought to merge all U.S. military aviation into a single, independent air force. Upon Moffett&#x27;s death, he was succeeded as Chief of the Bureau by Rear Admiral Ernest J. King, a future Fleet Admiral and Chief of Naval Operations during World War II. Other important bureau chiefs included Rear Admiral John S. McCain Sr., the grandfather of U.S. Senator John S. McCain III (R-Ariz.).

During the 1930s, BuAer presided over rapid technological change in naval aircraft. The bureau&#x27;s policy was to limit its own production, in order to support the civilian aircraft industry. BuAer used the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a facility for building small numbers of prototype aircraft.

==World War II and the postwar period==
World War II brought immense changes as well. BuAer was forced to expand rapidly in order to comply with the nation&#x27;s defense needs. By the war&#x27;s end, the bureau had developed an administrative structure that oversaw thousands of personnel, and the procurement and maintenance of tens of thousands of aircraft. In 1943, the Navy established the position of Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, or DCNO(Air), a move which relieved some of BuAer&#x27;s responsibility for Fleet operations. RADM McCain, now promoted to vice admiral, was the first to fill the position.

BuAer downsized after the war, but continued its focus on aeronautical research and development. But as naval technology became increasingly complex, it became clear that the Navy&#x27;s material organization was insufficient. In particular, the Navy needed better integration of aerial weapons with naval aircraft. There was also the question of &quot;pilotless aircraft&quot; (the ancestors of the late 20th century&#x27;s Unmanned Aerial Vehicles); BuAer considered these to be aircraft, while BuOrd saw them as guided missiles.

To fix the problem, in 1959 the Navy merged BuAer and BuOrd to create the Bureau of Naval Weapons (BuWeps). This was only a temporary solution, however, and in 1966 the Navy undertook a wholesale revision of its material organization. The bureau system, which had existed since the 1840s, was replaced with the &quot;Systems Commands&quot; (SYSCOMs). BuWeps was replaced with the current Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR).

<doc id="899350" wikidata="Q46999010" url="?curid=899350" title="Grand Lake St. Marys State Park">
<text>Grand Lake St. Marys State Park is a public recreation area located on Grand Lake in Mercer and Auglaize counties, Ohio. Grand Lake is the largest inland lake in Ohio in terms of area, but is shallow, with an average depth of only . The state park is open for year-round recreation, including boating, fishing, swimming and hunting. The park consists of the lake and park facilities scattered all around the shore intermingled with private property and a facility operated by Wright State University. It is west of St. Marys, and southeast of Celina, southwest of Lima in the northwestern part of the state.

==History==
Grand Lake St. Marys was constructed in the early 19th century as a reservoir for the Miami and Erie Canal, which connected the Ohio River with Lake Erie. At one time the lake was the world&#x27;s largest man-made lake. The canal system thrived for about thirty years in the mid-to-late 19th century before it was replaced by the railroads. In the 1890s oil was discovered in the area, and oil derricks were set up in the lake sometime around 1891. This made Grand Lake the location for the first off shore oil drilling to take place. The lake became one of Ohio&#x27;s first state parks in 1949 with recreational facilities built in the following years.

===Names===
The official geographic name of the lake is Grand Lake. The United States Geological Survey Board of Geographic Names disapproved a proposal to change the name &quot;Grand Lake&quot; to &quot;Grand Lake-Saint Marys&quot;, which is the name given on state maps and documents. The 1920 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica shows the name as Lake Mercer on the map of Ohio in the article on Ohio. &quot;Lake St. Marys&quot; was a name introduced in the early 1900s and wasn&#x27;t popular with Celina residents. The body of water has also been referred to as &quot;Grand Reservoir&quot; and &quot;Lake Celina&quot; among other names.

==Ecology==
The land on which Grand Lake St. Marys is located was once part of a forest that stretched from the Appalachian Mountains in Pennsylvania to the prairie in Illinois. Much of the forest was cleared by pioneer farmers as the area was settled in the years following the Northwest Indian War. The forests have been replaced by farmland with fields of wheat, soybeans, and corn.

Grand Lake St. Marys was once a swampy prairie. When the lake was constructed in the early 19th century, the prairie was flooded. Now the shore of the lake includes woodlands, wetlands and prairie ecosystems that are surrounded by residential development and farms.

Several outlier stands of eastern hemlock are present around the lake, and these are the westernmost natural stands in Ohio.

The park is located along a major migration route for migratory birds. Commonly seen waterfowl include, geese, loons, ducks, grebes, and swans. Wading birds found in the marshy areas of the park include egrets and herons. American white pelicans have been spotted every year in the park for almost a decade. Historically, these birds bred in the western United States and Canada, but appear to be expanding their range east. White pelican nests were found for the first time on Lake Erie in 2019. Other birds found at the park include cormorants, red-tailed hawks, ospreys, owls such as; great horned owls, barred owls, screech owls, saw-whet owls, and very rarely, snowy owls. The once endangered bald eagle has returned to the area, and there are several nests located around the lake. The most commonly found mammals in the park are cottontail rabbits, mink, fox squirrels, white-tailed deer, eastern coyote, beaver, muskrat, and raccoons.

==Environmental concerns and restoration efforts==
Due to the increasingly high levels of lake pollution, E. coli bacteria, and related algae levels, Grand Lake could be dying off as a destination lake and is considered by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to be &quot;impaired&quot; due to &quot;stream channelization, drainage tiles, loss of floodplains and streamside vegetation, manure runoff and untreated sewage flowing from failing home septic systems and small communities without any wastewater collection or treatment.&quot;

Runoff from farmland is one of the greatest problems. Nutrients of livestock waste and natural and chemical fertilizers are laden with phosphorus and nitrogen. These elements upset the natural balance of the lake and increase the growth of blue-green algae. The algae is a cyanobacterium, with Planktothrix being a particularly prevalent and problematic species. The bacteria produce toxic peptides that can be harmful to plants and animals. Humans are also affected by the toxins. Microcystin can harm the liver and cause other health problems including mild rashes and sneezing and even severe gastrointestinal ailments. Agriculture runoff is not the only source of pollution in the lake. Industrial and commercial drainage contribute to the problem as does drainage from out of date septic tanks and municipal sewage systems. 

Heavy deposits of silt into the lake also contribute to the degradation of the lake. Development of homes along the shore has reduced the number of native plants that helped to strengthen the shore and reduce erosion. Development has also increased the level of phosphates entering the lake by over fertilization of lawns. These excess phosphates directly contribute to plant growth, including the algae in the lake. The native flora that has been reduced served as a filter to keep the excess nutrients out of the water. 

==Recreation==
Grand Lake St. Marys State Park is open for year-round recreation, including boating, hunting, fishing, swimming and picnicking. The campground has 216 sites of which 135 are equipped with electricity. Facilities include modern restroom facilities, a laundry and a dump station. Pets are permitted.

Grand Lake St. Marys is open to boating, fishing, swimming and water skiing. Boats with unlimited horsepower are permitted on the lake. The state maintains nine launch ramps providing access to the lake. A no-wake zone has been established around the lake&#x27;s of shore. Boats are prohibited from entering a wildlife refuge on the southwest corner of the lake.

The lake is open to fishing year-round. Common game fish include warm water fish such as crappie, bass, yellow perch, and bluegill. Hunting is permitted in designated zones. Grand Lake St. Mary&#x27;s provides a habitat for a variety of waterfowl. The state owns seventy duck blinds spread throughout the designated hunting zones.

There are four public swimming beaches as well as other swimming areas provided for boaters, although as of 2010 the water was deemed unsafe for swimming. Lake health has improved dramatically over the last several years There are several picnic areas and picnic shelters.

The camp store loans games, fishing and sporting equipment to registered campers. Bike rentals are available at the campground. The park also has a miniature golf course, along with basketball and volleyball courts, horseshoe pits, playground equipment, and a recently added swimming pool.
St. Marys Fish Hatchery, located on the lake&#x27;s eastern shore is operated by the ODNR Division of Wildlife. The hatchery raises saugeye, walleye, channel catfish and bass for stocking in the public fishing waters of the state.

The Grand Lake St. Marys Seaplane Base also operates on the lake and serves as Ohio&#x27;s only airport for seaplanes.

<doc id="899355" wikidata="Q2866046" url="?curid=899355" title="Universal Entertainment">
<text>formerly known as and Universal, is a Japanese manufacturer of pachinko, slot machines, arcade games and other gaming products, and a publisher of video games. Aruze possesses licenses to both manufacture and distribute casino machines in the American states of Nevada, Mississippi and New Jersey. The company&#x27;s corporate headquarters are in Tokyo. Aruze is also the licence holder of the video game franchise &quot;Shadow Hearts&quot;. Up until February 18, 2012, the company owned approximately 21% of Wynn Resorts. On November 1, 2009, Aruze Corporation changed its name to Universal Entertainment Corporation due to financial difficulties.

==Universal==
Universal Lease Co., Ltd was established in December 1969. It later changed its name to Universal Ltd in Japan. Universal Distributing Company opened as an american subsidiary to sell video games direct to operators, and was later named Universal USA.

They initially earned success with arcade video games that cloned popular arcade games. &quot;Scratch&quot; (1977) was a &quot;Breakout&quot; clone that became the third highest-earning arcade video game of 1977 in Japan, just below &quot;Speed Race DX&quot; and &quot;Breakout&quot;. &quot;Scratch&quot; was again Japan&#x27;s fourth highest-earning arcade video game of 1978. &quot;Cosmic Monsters&quot; (1978) was a &quot;Space Invaders&quot; clone that became Japan&#x27;s sixth highest-earning arcade video game the same year.

Universal eventually moved away from clones and began producing original arcade games. (1978) was a sit-down arcade racing game that used a 16-bit central processing unit (CPU), for which it was advertised as the world&#x27;s first 16-bit game; it was among Japan&#x27;s top twenty highest-earning arcade video games of 1978.

Universal followed with the hugely influential platform game &quot;Space Panic&quot; (1980) and the maze game &quot;Lady Bug&quot; (1981). Universal&#x27;s greatest hit game was &quot;Mr. Do!&quot; (1982), which spawned three sequels in the eventual Mr. Do series: &quot;Mr. Do&#x27;s Castle&quot;, &quot;Mr. Do&#x27;s Wild Ride&quot; and &quot;Do Run Run&quot;. Cashing-in on the success of laserdisc video games, Universal released &quot;Super Don Quix-ote&quot; in 1984, on a new standardized laserdisc video game system they called the Universal System 1. A new game was planned every six months for the Universal System 1, including an unreleased laserdisc adventure game based on &quot;Mr. Do!&quot;, but the company stopped producing arcade games in 1985, and &quot;Super Don Quix-ote&quot; ended up being the only game released for the system. Universal Distributing of Nevada (UDN) was established to begin selling Universal&#x27;s first slot machines direct to the gaming industry.

Several Universal titles were designed by Kazutoshi Ueda, most notably &quot;Mr. Do!&quot; (1982). He later left Universal and went on to work at Tehkan (now Tecmo), then became a co-founder of Atlus, where he worked on the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series. Ueda&#x27;s work at Universal inspired the game design style of Tehkan&#x27;s Michitaka Tsuruta, who went on to create &quot;Guzzler&quot; (1983), &quot;Bomb Jack&quot; (1984), &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Key&quot; (1986), and the &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; game series.

In January 2005, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Aruze. Aruze Corporation changed its company name to Universal Entertainment Corporation effective November 1, 2009.

On February 2, 2023, Aruze Gaming filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.

==Relationship with SNK==

In 2000, Aruze bought out SNK Corporation, maker of the Neo Geo. In exchange for the use of SNK&#x27;s popular characters on their pachinko and slot machines, and a few games for the Neo-Geo, Aruze promised financial backing for the failing SNK. Instead Aruze instituted a program to liquidate SNK&#x27;s assets and cut costs. This included licensing out popular IP to other companies (such as &quot;Metal Slug&quot; series, &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series and &quot;Sengoku&quot; series), closing underperforming divisions, discontinuing distribution outside Japan, ending support for the Neo Geo arcade platform and selling off warehoused inventory. By 2001 it was clear to many SNK&#x27;s employees that Aruze was not planning to preserve SNK and was simply going to let the company implode after liquidating most of its useful assets. So Eikichi Kawasaki and many other executives from SNK left to form Playmore in August 1, 2001. Over this period many rank and file employees left to join other arcade developers or form their own companies.

In November 1, 2001, Aruze announced that its subsidiary, SNK to file for bankruptcy by the Osaka District Court on October 30, 2001 and all of its assets went up for bidding. Kawasaki&#x27;s Playmore stepped in and bought up most of the auctioned assets and set itself up to re-enter the video game market as the successor to SNK. Playmore also acquired some of the companies formed by ex-SNK employees, namely Brezzasoft and Noise Factory, to jumpstart development of more titles for the Neo Geo arcade system. Playmore quickly went about re-establishing themselves in the market; they opened new branches in North America and Europe, announced development of new titles for the Neo Geo arcade system, started developing games for console and portable systems for the first time in years and re-established distribution channels to sell inventory for the Neo Geo home and pocket systems. To further establish themselves as a reborn SNK they officially changed their name to SNK Playmore in 2003.

In October 2002, Aruze was sued by Playmore founder Eikichi Kawasaki for copyright infringement over SNK&#x27;s intellectual properties, claiming their use was unauthorized by Playmore. In January 2004, a preliminary decision was handed down by the Osaka District Court favoring SNK Playmore and was awarded 5.64 billion yen (US$57,627,468) in damages.

<text>USS &quot;McKee&quot; (DD-87) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns.
They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;McKee&quot;, the second ship named for Hugh W. McKee, was laid down 29 October 1917 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, launched 23 March 1918, sponsored by Mrs. J. Tynan, and commissioned 7 September 1918. Following a west coast shakedown, &quot;McKee&quot; sailed from Mare Island 13 September 1918, transited the Panama Canal the 27th, and reported for duty with Destroyer Flotilla 5 at New York 2 October. In this late phase of World War I, short coastal sailings preceded her departure from Hampton Roads 28 October as a convoy escort. Upon her arrival in the Azores 5 November she was assigned to a returning convoy and entered New York Harbor 2 December. Early in 1919 she steamed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for fleet exercises from 26 January to 4 April. A number of voyages from Key West, Florida, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, kept her crew well trained prior to her reporting Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 13 December to be placed in reduced commission.

From July 1921, &quot;McKee&quot; based first at Newport, Rhode Island, then at Charleston, South Carolina, and in the aftermath of the Washington Disarmament Conference proceeded to Philadelphia in April 1922. Decommissioning 16 June 1922, she was struck from the Navy list 7 January 1936 and sold to Boston Iron &amp; Metal Company, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland, for scrapping.

<doc id="899360" wikidata="Q61848" url="?curid=899360" title="Karl Blossfeldt">
<text>Karl Blossfeldt (13 June 18659 December 1932) was a German photographer and sculptor. He is best known for his close-up photographs of plants and living things, published in 1929 as &quot;Urformen der Kunst&quot;. He was inspired, as was his father, by nature and the ways in which plants grow.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and career ===
Karl Blossfeldt was born on 13 June 1865 in Schielo, near the Harz Mountains (present-day Germany). He began his career as a sculptor before extending his artistic horizons to other pursuits. In 1881, Blossfeldt began an apprenticeship, when he was 16 years old, training as an iron caster at the Art Ironworks and Foundry in Mägdesprung Germany.

After spending three years as an apprentice, Blossfeldt transitioned to studying illustration at Kunstgewerbemuseum&#x27;s education department in Berlin. During this time, Blossfeldt received a scholarship opportunity to study under Moritz Meurer. He began working for Moritz Meurer, a decorative artist and professor of ornament and design, in 1890. He traveled, along with other assistants, around Europe and North Africa photographing botanical specimens for Moritz Meurer to use as reference photos for his artwork. It was while studying under Moritz Meurer that Blossfeldt began his initial experimentation with the field of photography. Blossfeldt continued working for Moritz Meurer until 1896.

After working for Meurer, Blossfeldt began his teaching career in 1898 when he was appointed for a teaching post at the Institute of Royal Arts Museum. Blossfeldt was eventually appointed a fulltime position at Kunstgewerbeschule in 1899 where he taught “Modeling from Plants” for 31 years. Among his contacts at the Berlin Arts and Crafts School was Heinz Warneke.

=== Photography career ===
Blossfeldt’s photography career began when he was photographing botanical specimens for Moritz Meurer. Blossfeldt later continued to develop his skillset, and his collection of photographs, while he was working as a professor. The photographs he took for Moritz Meurer and during his teaching years were used as reference photographs for his personal work and for his teaching purposes. He kept a detailed log of the common and scientific names of every specimen that he photographed, and eventually produced roughly 6,000 photographs.

It wasn&#x27;t until Blossfeldt was in his 60s that his photographs began to receive recognition for their artistic value, as opposed to their functionality as references. This recognition began in 1925 when art gallerist Karl Neirendorf first began representing Blossfeldt. With the help of Niernedorf, Blossfeldt&#x27;s first monograph &quot;Urformen der Kunst&quot; was published in 1928. &quot;Urformen der Kunst&quot; gained overnight success and recognition. This segued into Blossfedlt&#x27;s rise in fame that eventually lead to his second publication &quot;Wundergarten der Natur&quot;. Despite Blossfeldt&#x27;s lack of professional training his work as a photographer, photography is what he is best known for.

=== Death ===
He died in Berlin aged 67 on 9 December 1932.

== Photography technique and style ==

=== Key features and inspiration sources ===

Blossfeldt&#x27;s photographs gained popularity due to his unique artistic style, which set him apart from other notable photographers at the time. Blossfeldt&#x27;s focused and magnified photos were in stark contrast to the purposefully blurry images most photographers were producing at the time. There were many characteristics of Blossfeldt&#x27;s photographs that made them easily distinguishable; one being Blossfeldt&#x27;s use of nature as his subject. Blossfeldt spent large amounts of time in nature in his youth which was a large source of inspiration. Blossfeldt held a deep appreciation for the scientific accuracy of his photographs as well as for nature so he rarely altered his natural subjects. He stated that “The plant must be valued as a totally artistic and architectural structure.” Blossfeldt also maintained a detailed log of both the common and Latin names of his plant subjects.

He focused on the naturally reoccurring geometric structures found in his natural subjects. Blossfeldt&#x27;s emphasis on geometric patterns in nature can be linked back to the beginning of his career, and formal training, as a sculptor. His time spent as an iron craftsman led to his appreciation for patterns that resemble those he worked with during that time.
=== Artistic technique ===
While Blossfeldt&#x27;s choice in subject and style was in part an artistic decision, it was also due to the functionality of his work as reference photos for other artists and students, which ultimately greatly influenced his technique. To capture effective reference photos, Blossfeldt needed to ensure that the subjects themselves were as clear and focused as possible. To aid in achieving this goal, Blossfeldt utilized solid color, grey or white, backgrounds to provide contrast which highlighted the patterns and symmetry of the plants that Blossfeldt was aiming to capture. In order to capture the intricate detail of his plant subjects, Blossfeldt developed a series of home-made camera lenses that allowed him to magnify his plant subjects by thirty times, producing unprecedented detail. This technique reflected his enduring interest in the repetitive patterns found in nature&#x27;s textures and forms.

== Legacy ==

=== Lasting influence ===
Blossfeldt inspired many other photographers, such as Bernd and Hilla Becher, whose photographs of industrial architecture drew inspiration from Blossfeldt&#x27;s snapshots of nature&#x27;s geometrical features. His pictures attracted wider attention through the support of gallerist Karl Nierendorf, who sponsored a show of Blossfeldt&#x27;s pictures paired with African sculptures at his gallery in 1926. Nierendorf also helped to produce the first edition of Blossdeldt&#x27;s monograph &quot;Urformen der Kunst&quot; (Art forms in nature), in 1929. The publication of his working collages in 2001 threw into question the legitimacy of his association with New Objectivity, as his methods were shown to differ from those of other artists in the movement. With this said, Karl Blossfeldt continues to be regarded as a pioneer of close-up photography who received great praise from many notable figures in the art world.

Karl Blossfeldt is regarded as a pioneer of close-up photography who received great praise from many notable figures in the art world. Swiftly regarded as a seminal book on photography, Blossfeldt&#x27;s objective and finely detailed imagery was praised by Walter Benjamin, who declared that Blossfeldt &quot;has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world&quot;. Benjamin compared Blossfeldt to Moholy-Nagy and the pioneers of New Objectivity. He also ranked Blossfeldts achievements alongside the great photographers August Sander and Eugène Atget. The Surrealists also championed him, and Georges Bataille included his images in the periodical &quot;Documents&quot; in 1929. Blossfeldt continues to receive praise, even after his death, with his 2001 &quot;Urformen der Kunst&quot; included in &quot;The Book of 101 Books&quot; as one of the seminal photographic books of the twentieth century.

<doc id="899361" wikidata="Q2318968" url="?curid=899361" title="Richard M. Sherman">
<text>Richard Morton Sherman (June 12, 1928 – May 25, 2024) was an American songwriter who specialized in musical films with his brother Robert B. Sherman. According to the official Walt Disney Company website and independent fact checkers, &quot;The Sherman Brothers were responsible for more motion picture musical song scores than any other songwriting team in film history.&quot;

Some of the Sherman Brothers&#x27; best known songs were incorporated into live action and animation musical films including &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;, &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot;, &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;, &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot;, and &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;.

Their best known work is &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot;, written for the theme park attraction of the same name. According to &quot;Time&quot;, it may be the most publicly performed song in history.

==Early life==
Richard Morton Sherman was born on June 12, 1928, in New York City to Russian Jewish immigrants, Rosa (Dancis) and Al Sherman. Sherman and his older brother Robert eventually followed in their songwriting father&#x27;s footsteps to form a long-lasting songwriting partnership.

Following seven years of frequent cross-country moves, the Sherman family finally settled down in Beverly Hills, California in 1937. During Richard&#x27;s years at Beverly Hills High School, he fell in love with music and studied piano, flute and piccolo. At his 1946 high school graduation, Sherman and classmate André Previn played a musical duet with Previn on piano and Sherman on flute. Coincidentally, both would go on to win Academy Awards for music in 1964, with Previn winning for Scoring of Music – Adaptation or Treatment for &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, while the Sherman Brothers won for Music Score – Substantially Original for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, as well as a second for Best Original Song for &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot;.

===Army service and education===
In 1953, Sherman was drafted into U.S. Army, being assigned to the Army Band and glee club. Serving as musical conductor for both groups from 1953 until his honorable discharge in 1955, he was stationed solely in the United States during his time in the service. During this time, his brother Robert worked with other songwriters.

As a student at Bard College, Sherman majored in music, writing numerous sonatas and &quot;art songs&quot;.

==Career==
Within two years of graduating, Sherman and his brother Robert began writing songs together on a challenge from their father, Al Sherman, a successful popular songwriter in the &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; days (&quot;No! No! A Thousand Times No!!&quot;, &quot;You Gotta Be a Football Hero&quot;).

In 1958, Sherman&#x27;s brother Robert founded the music publishing company, Music World Corporation, which later worked with Disney&#x27;s BMI publishing arm, Wonderland Music Company. That same year, the Sherman Brothers had their first Top Ten hit with &quot;Tall Paul&quot;, which was sung by Annette Funicello. The success of this song attracted the attention of Walt Disney who eventually hired the Sherman Brothers as Staff Songwriters for Walt Disney Studios. While at Disney, the Sherman Brothers wrote what is perhaps their most recognized song: &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World (After All)&quot; for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Starting with this movie, and continuing through several subsequent Disney movies, the Sherman Brothers collaborated with noted arranger-conductor Irwin Kostal.

In 1965, the Sherman brothers won 2 Academy Awards for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; – Best Original Score, which included &quot;Feed The Birds&quot;, &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot;; and Best Original Song, &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot;. Since &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;″ premiere, Robert B. Sherman subsequently earned 9 Academy Award nominations, 2 Grammy Awards, 4 Grammy Award nominations and 23 gold and platinum albums.

Robert and Richard Sherman worked directly for Walt Disney until Disney&#x27;s death in 1966. After leaving the company, the brothers worked freelance as songwriters on scores of motion pictures, television shows, theme park exhibits and stage musicals.

Their first non-Disney assignment came with Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s motion picture production &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; in 1968 which garnered the brothers their third Academy Award Nomination. In 1973, the Sherman Brothers made history by becoming the only Americans ever to win First Prize at the Moscow Film Festival for &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; for which they also authored the screenplay.

&quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; was picked to be the Royal Command Performance for 1976 and was attended by Queen Elizabeth. A modern musical adaptation of the classic Cinderella story, Slipper also features both song-score and screenplay by the Sherman Brothers. That same year the Sherman Brothers received their star on the Hollywood &quot;Walk of Fame&quot; directly across from Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater.

Their numerous other Disney and non-Disney top box office film credits include &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970), &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961), &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1998), &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (1973), &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (1977), &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot; (1972), &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971) and &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures In Slumberland&quot; (1992).

Outside the motion picture realm, their Tony-nominated &quot;Over Here!&quot; (1974) was the biggest-grossing original Broadway Musical of that year. The Sherman Brothers have also written numerous top-selling songs, including &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen&quot;, which holds the distinction of reaching Billboard&#x27;s Top Ten twice; first with Johnny Burnette in 1960 and then with Ringo Starr fourteen years later. Other top-ten hits include, &quot;Pineapple Princess&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot; and more.

In 2000, the Sherman brothers wrote the song score for Disney&#x27;s blockbuster film: &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; (2000). This film marked the brothers&#x27; first major motion picture for the Disney company in over 28 years.

In 2002, the stage musical &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; premiered in London. It was the most successful stage show ever produced at the London Palladium, boasting the longest run in that century-old theatre&#x27;s history. In early 2005 a second Chitty company premiered on Broadway (New York City) at the Foxwoods Theatre (then the Hilton Theatre). The Sherman Brothers wrote an additional six songs specifically for the new stage productions.

In 2003, four Sherman brothers&#x27; musicals ranked in the &quot;Top 10 Favorite Children&#x27;s Films of All Time&quot; in a (British) nationwide poll reported by the BBC. &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967) ranked at #7, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) ranked at #8, &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970) ranked at #9 and &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968) topped the list at #1.

A new Disney and Cameron Mackintosh production of &quot;Mary Poppins: The Stage Musical&quot; made its world premiere at the Prince Edward Theatre in December 2004 and features the Sherman Brothers classic songs.

In June 2005, Richard M. Sherman was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame with his brother. &quot;Chitty&quot; opened on Broadway in 2005 and commenced its first full UK tour in December 2005 with subsequent tours and/or tour dates in each year since. &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; opened on Broadway in 2006.

Recently, Sherman once again collaborated with Disney in three of its live-action films, having rewritten the song &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You&quot; for Jon Favreau&#x27;s 2016 remake of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. As the film featured the song&#x27;s performer, King Louie, as a &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;, Sherman rewrote it to fit the character&#x27;s depiction. He also wrote three new songs for the 2018 film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;, titled &quot;Goodbye Farewell&quot;, &quot;Busy Doing Nothing&quot;, and &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;, the last two performed by Sherman. Sherman also acted as a music consultant for &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. Sherman also wrote new songs for the upcoming musical stage adaptation of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

By May 2023, a feature film development deal on the Sherman Brothers&#x27; animation musical &quot;Inkas the Ramferinkas&quot; was announced.

==Personal life==
In the late 1940s, while Richard was attending Bard college, he was briefly married to Corrine Newman. They had one child, Lynda. In 1957, Richard married Ursula Elizabeth Gluck; the couple had two children, Gregory Vincent and Victoria Lynn. Sherman had six grandchildren.

Following Robert Sherman&#x27;s relocation from Beverly Hills to London, England, the brothers continued to collaborate musically. They credited the ability to do so long-distance to technology via fax, e-mail, and the low-cost international telephone service. Both brothers frequently traveled between Los Angeles, New York, and London working together on various musical plays until Robert&#x27;s death in 2012.

Although the brothers always continued collaborating on music, they often had major disputes and their families hardly knew one another. While attending public premieres, they and their families would sit on opposite sides of the theater and when their father died they held two separate &quot;shivas&quot;.

Richard and Elizabeth were married for over 67 years, until his death. They lived in Beverly Hills, California. He died of &quot;age-related illness&quot; at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, on May 25, 2024, at the age of 95, just 18 days before his 96th birthday.

<text>Robert Bernard Sherman (December 19, 1925 – March 6, 2012) was an American songwriter, best known for his work in musical films with his brother, Richard M. Sherman. The Sherman brothers produced more motion picture song scores than any other songwriting team in film history. Some of their songs were incorporated into live action and animation musical films including &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;, &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot;, and &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;. Their best-known work is &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World (After All)&quot; possibly the most-performed song (in public) in history.

==Early life==
Robert Bernard Sherman was born on December 19, 1925, in New York City to Russian Jewish immigrants Rosa (Dancis) and Al Sherman. Al Sherman, a songwriter, paid for his son&#x27;s hospital delivery costs with a royalty check that arrived that day for the song &quot;Save Your Sorrow&quot;. His brother and songwriting partner, Richard, was born in 1928. Sherman&#x27;s father was a well-known Tin Pan Alley songwriter.

In his youth, Sherman excelled in violin, piano, painting and poetry. Following seven years of cross-country moves, the Shermans settled down in Beverly Hills, California. Some of the primary schools Sherman attended in Manhattan included PS 241 and the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, and in California, the El Rodeo School.
At Beverly Hills High School, Sherman wrote and produced radio and stage programs for which he won much acclaim. At age 16, Sherman wrote &quot;Armistice and Dedication Day&quot;, a stage play showing how American life was changed following the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. The play yielded thousands of dollars for war bonds and earned a special citation from the War Department.

==World War II==
In 1943, Sherman obtained permission from his parents to join the army at age 17. Sherman was awarded the Purple Heart medal after being shot in the knee on April 12, 1945, an injury which forced him to walk with a cane for the rest of his life.
On April 29, 1945, Sherman was among the first soldiers who entered the Dachau concentration camp.
Other medals received by Sherman for service in the war were the Bronze Star Medal, the Combat Infantryman Badge, two Battle Stars for his European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, an American Campaign Medal, a World War II Victory Medal, and a Good Conduct Medal, and several Army Weapons Qualifications badges.

While recuperating from his knee injury in Taunton and Bournemouth in England, Sherman became familiar with the United Kingdom and its culture.

==Awards and decorations==
During World War II, Robert B. Sherman received these awards:

==Education==
Upon his return to the United States, Sherman attended Bard College in upstate New York where he majored in English literature and painting. Sherman served as editor-in-chief of Bard College&#x27;s campus newspaper, &quot;The Bardian&quot;. At Bard, Sherman completed his first two novels, &quot;The Best Estate&quot; and &quot;Music, Candy and Painted Eggs.&quot; He graduated in 1949.

On May 12, 1990, Sherman received an honorary doctorate from Lincoln College.

==Songwriting career==
Sherman and his brother, Richard, began writing songs together on a challenge from their father, Al Sherman, who was a Tin Pan Alley songwriter (&quot;No! No! A Thousand Times No!!&quot;, &quot;You Gotta Be a Football Hero&quot;).

In 1958, Sherman founded the music publishing company, Music World Corporation, which later worked with Disney&#x27;s BMI publishing arm, Wonderland Music Company. That same year, the Sherman brothers had their first Top 10 hit with &quot;Tall Paul&quot;, sung by Annette Funicello. The success of this song attracted the attention of Walt Disney, who hired the Sherman Brothers as staff songwriters for Walt Disney Studios. While at Disney, the Sherman Brothers wrote their most-recognized song, &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World (After All)&quot; for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

In 1965, the Sherman brothers won two Academy Awards for &quot;Mary Poppins,&quot; Best Original Score and Best Original Song, &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot;. Since &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;″ premiere, Sherman earned nine Academy Award nominations, two Grammy Awards, four Grammy Award nominations and 23 gold and platinum albums. Starting with this movie, and continuing through several subsequent Disney movies, the Sherman Brothers collaborated with noted arranger-conductor Irwin Kostal.

Robert and Richard Sherman worked for Walt Disney until Disney&#x27;s death in 1966. After leaving the company, the brothers worked freelance as songwriters on scores of motion pictures, television shows, theme park exhibits and stage musicals.

Their first non-Disney assignment was in 1968 in Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s motion picture &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,&quot; which garnered the brothers their third Academy Award nomination. In 1973, the Sherman brothers made history by becoming the only Americans ever to win first prize at the Moscow Film Festival for &quot;Tom Sawyer,&quot; for which they authored the screenplay.

In 1976, &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; was picked to be the Royal Command Performance of the year, attended by Queen Elizabeth. A musical adaptation of Cinderella, &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; features both song, score and screenplay by the Sherman brothers. That same year the Sherman brothers received a star on the Hollywood &quot;Walk of Fame&quot; across from Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater.

Other box office film credits for the Sherman brothers include &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970), &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961), &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1998), &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (1973), &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (1977), &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot; (1972), &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971) and &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures In Slumberland&quot; (1992).

In 1974, the Sherman brothers&#x27; Tony-nominated &quot;Over Here!&quot; (1974) was the highest-grossing original Broadway musical of that year. The Sherman brothers wrote popular songs, including &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen&quot;, which reached Billboard&#x27;s Top 10 twice, with Johnny Burnette in 1960 and with Ringo Starr 14 years later, &quot;Pineapple Princess&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot;.

In 2000, the Sherman brothers wrote the score for Disney&#x27;s blockbuster film &quot;The Tigger Movie,&quot; their first major motion picture for Disney in more than 28 years.

In 2002, the stage musical &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; became the most successful stage show produced at the London Palladium. In 2005, it premiered on Broadway at the Foxwoods Theatre (then the Hilton Theatre). The Sherman brothers wrote an additional six songs for the new stage productions.

In 2002, Sherman moved from Beverly Hills to London, England, where he continued to write and paint. In 2003, four Sherman brothers&#x27; musicals ranked in the &quot;Top 10 Favorite Children&#x27;s Films of All Time&quot; in a British poll reported by the BBC. &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967) ranked at No. 7, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) ranked at No. 8, &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970) ranked at No. 9 and &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968) ranked at No. 1.

A Disney and Cameron Mackintosh production of &quot;Mary Poppins: The Stage Musical&quot; that premiered at the Prince Edward Theatre in December 2004 featured the Sherman brothers&#x27; classic songs.

In June 2005, Sherman was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame with his brother, Richard. Also in June 2005, a tribute was paid to Sherman at the Théâtre de Vevey in Vevey, Switzerland by the Ballet Romand.

In 2006, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; opened on Broadway and embarked on a world tour beginning in Göteborg, Sweden in 2008.

&quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; embarked on a tour of 29 cities in the U.S., ending in 2009.

==Personal life==

===Marriage and family===
Sherman married Ilse Louise Hayes in Elkton, Maryland in 1948; the marriage was annulled in South Norwalk, Connecticut in 1950.

Sherman then married Joyce Ruth Sasner in California in 1953. Their first child, Laurie (b. 1955) was followed by Jeffrey (b. 1957), Andrea (1960-2019) and Robert (b. 1968).

After Sherman&#x27;s 2002 relocation to London, he and his brother, Richard, continued to collaborate on various musical plays, as well as a feature, animated, film musicals which incorporates their original story, song score and screenplay. The brothers traveled between Los Angeles, New York and London to facilitate their work.

Sherman died in London on March 6, 2012. His wife preceded him in death by 11 years. A public memorial service and funeral was held for Sherman on March 9, 2012, at Hillside Memorial Park and Mortuary in Culver City.

===Painting and other artistry===

A lesser-known aspect of Sherman&#x27;s life was his painting, which he had done since 1941 and kept private, except from his family and friends, until 2002. Sherman studied painting while attending Bard College, receiving a double degree in both Painting and English Literature. Sherman worked in various visual arts media, including clay and metal sculpture, but his focus was oil painting throughout the 1940s-1960s, when he switched to acrylics.

In April 2002, an exhibition of Sherman&#x27;s paintings was held in London, England, at Thompsons&#x27; Gallery on Marylebone High Street. This marked the first public exhibition of his paintings since he started painting in 1941. Sherman exhibited his paintings in Florida and California. A series of Limited Edition Giclées of Sherman&#x27;s art were published on canvas and paper.

Sherman&#x27;s paintings that have appeared at the various exhibitions include &quot;On Route 9G&quot; (c. 1949), &quot;Self Portrait&quot; (1970), &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1970), &quot;Moses&quot; (1977), &quot;Carousel In The Country&quot; (1982), &quot;From the Dining Room&quot; (1982), &quot;Sacrifice&quot; (1983), &quot;Florid Window&quot; (1984), &quot;Geisha&quot; (1986), &quot;Fine Four Fendered Friend&quot; (2002), and &quot;Park Lane&quot; (2003). On March 4, 2007, Sherman and his son, Robbie, donated limited edition prints of &quot;Moses&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice&quot; to the Giffnock Synagogue in Glasgow, Scotland. Sherman worked in metal sculpture, wrote poetry and short stories from an early age.

<text>Maurice Quentin de La Tour (; 5 September 1704 – 17 February 1788) was a French painter who worked primarily with pastels in the Rococo style. Among his most famous subjects were Voltaire, Rousseau, Louis XV and the Madame de Pompadour.

==Biography==
Maurice Quentin de La Tour was born in Saint-Quentin, the third son of a musician, François de La Tour. François was from Laon and he was the son of a master mason, Jean de La Tour, of Laon and Saint-Quentin, who died in 1674. François de La Tour apparently was successively a trumpet-player for the rifle regiment of the Duc du Maine, and musician to the master of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin. He is popularly said to have disapproved of his son taking up the arts, but there is nothing to support this. According to François Marandet in 2002, an apprenticeship was arranged for the young Maurice, with a painter named Dupouch, from 12 October 1719, but it is not known when this contract was terminated. Little is known of de La Tour&#x27;s background until, when barely nineteen, he went to Paris indefinitely, fleeing an indiscretion concerning his cousin, Anne Bougier; by this age he was claiming painting as his profession. After travelling briefly to England in 1725, he returned to Paris in 1727, where he was encouraged to begin working as a portraitist in pastels. His earliest known portrait, which is attested only by an engraving made in 1731 by Langlois, was a portrait of Voltaire.

In 1737, at the Paris Salon, de La Tour exhibited the portraits of &quot;Madame Boucher&quot;, the wife of the painter François Boucher, and &quot;l&#x27;Auteur qui rit&quot; or &quot;Self-Portrait, Laughing&quot; (musée du Louvre), the first of a series of 150 portraits that served as one of the glories of the Paris Salon for the next 36 years. Nevertheless, the painter Joseph Ducreux claimed to be his only student (although this is unlikely). On 25 May 1737, de La Tour was officially recognised (&quot;agréé&quot;) by the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, and soon attracted the attention of the French court. According to Jeffares, he had an apartment in the Palais du Louvre in 1745. By the late 1760s, his portraiture of the royal family had ceased. De La Tour was popularly perceived as endowing his portrait subjects with a distinctive charm and intelligence, while his delicate but sure touch with the pastel medium rendered a pleasing softness to their features.

Contemporary accounts describe de La Tour&#x27;s nature as lively, good-humoured, but eccentric. In many of his self-portraits he depicts himself smiling out from the frame towards the viewer; Laura Cumming states of de La Tour that &quot;where other artists make heavy weather of portraying themselves, he takes the task lightly and seems to have produced more glad-faced self-portraits than any other artist&quot;. However, being of an excessively nervous disposition (which eventually descended into dementia), and an exacting practitioner, he has also been described as over-engineering his work, to the point of spoiling it.

As de La Tour&#x27;s wealth increased from his commissions, so did his philanthropy: he founded a school for drawing in his native Saint-Quentin and donated towards impoverished women in confinement and disabled and ageing artisans and artists. He was also advisor and benefactor to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris, and the Academy of Sciences and &quot;Belles Lettres&quot; of Amiens. Eventually confined to his home and to the care of his brother, Jean-François, because of encroaching mental illness, he retired at the age of 80 to Saint-Quentin, where he died intestate at the age of 83 (he had revoked earlier wills). Jean-François (d. 1807), &quot;chevalier de l&#x27;ordre royal militaire de Saint-Louis&quot;, was the natural heir to his estate.

<doc id="899371" wikidata="Q364941" url="?curid=899371" title="Matt Burke (rugby union, born 1973)">
<text>Matthew Coleman Burke (born 26 March 1973) is an Australian former international rugby union player and sport presenter on Sydney&#x27;s &quot;10 News First&quot;.

Burke was a goalkicker and regular try-scorer for the Wallabies who contributed to the team&#x27;s victories in the 1999 Rugby World Cup, multiple Bledisloe Cups and Australia&#x27;s sole test series win against the British &amp; Irish Lions in 2001.

When he retired from international rugby in 2004 he was the leading points scorer in the multinational Super Rugby Competition. He is the most-capped fullback and the second highest scorer for Australia in Test rugby.

==Early life==
Burke grew up in Carlingford, New South Wales, and attended at St Gerard Majella Catholic Primary School, Carlingford and St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Hunters Hill. He was selected for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1990 and toured with the teams to the United States and Ireland. He played his club rugby with Eastwood and maintained his association with the club throughout his career.

==Rugby career==
Burke progressed to the Australian Under 21s team in 1992 and 1993 at the same time as playing at the Hong Kong Sevens in 1992 and the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1993. He made his Test debut in 1993 when he played in the third Test against the South African Springboks.

===Bledisloe Cup and early Wallabies years===
In the national team for two years as the starting fullback and goal-kicker, Burke gained early attention for scoring arguably one of the most impressive tries in Bledisloe Cup history during the second match of the 1996 tournament, held on 27 July at Brisbane&#x27;s Lang Park. After gathering a low pass from felled teammate Richard Tombs (from a standing start from his own 22-metre line), Burke dodged a total of six defenders culminating with a &#x27;dummy pass&#x27; to another teammate Ben Tune – allowing him to cover approximately 75 metres to score a try. The try put Australia ahead 16–9 at half time. Whilst the All Blacks would win with a last minute try to Frank Bunce – this game is particularly remembered for Burke&#x27;s try.

In 1997, Burke was excluded from the Wallabies by a groin strain suffered during the domestic season and he was temporarily replaced by Stephen Larkham; then also a goal-kicking fullback. However he returned in time for the first Bledisloe Cup match in 1998, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground where he scored all 24 (2 tries, 1 conversion and 4 penalties) of the Wallabies points against New Zealand. It is an individual point-scoring world record against the All Blacks – which still stands. Australia had not beaten the All Blacks for four years in a single game up to that point and this heralded not only an Australian comeback, but an unprecedented five-year domination of the tournament.

===Goal-kicking and shoulder injury===
Burke was considered one of the finest test goal-kickers of his day – second, perhaps, to contemporary rival New Zealand kicker Andrew Mehrtens. At a time before it became common in test rugby, Burke was one of the few goal-kickers able to take successful penalty attempts from beyond the half-way line. Yet he was known to have clusters of missed goal-kicking attempts. In the third match of the 1998 Bledisloe Cup, he missed three straightforward kicking attempts in the first half – before being relieved of kicking duties under instruction from Australian Captain John Eales in the second half (being in fact relieved of the goal-kicking by Eales himself). In the dying minutes of that particular march, he gained some measure of redemption by scoring a match-winning try but was also afflicted by a serious shoulder injury – sidelining him for the better part of the next year.

===Rugby World Cup 1999===
After undergoing surgery on the affected shoulder, Burke delayed his comeback to the domestic Rugby season, in an attempt to right himself for the 1999 Rugby World Cup. As a result, Burke faced some criticism for NSW&#x27;s subsequent poor performance in the Super 12 competition that year and also caused tension between himself and NSW Coach Matt Williams. At test level, he was being relieved by emerging rival Chris Latham, at the fullback position. Despite making it back in the squad in time to contribute to the 1999 Rugby World Cup victory, it has been speculated that this injury affected his counter-attacking playing style and future fitness.

As part of the campaign to &quot;Bring back Bill&quot;, as the starting Wallaby fullback and primary goal-kicker in the 1999 Rugby World Cup, he scored the majority of Australia&#x27;s points in the last two games to help secure victory – 24 points against in the Rugby World Cup semi-final and 25 points against in the grand final. Earlier in 1999, in an echo of the previous year at the MCG, he individually kicked 23 (1 conversion and 7 penalties) points against the All Blacks at Stadium Australia.

===Selection battles with Chris Latham===
After the 1999 World Cup, Burke had become plagued by ongoing injuries which were severely limiting his recovery and return to form. While his goal kicking and fairly regular try-scoring had saved Australia in many games; his injuries would soon take their toll. Queensland Reds fullback Chris Latham was soon competing with him for Wallabies selection and Latham was the favoured Australian fullback in the 2000 Bledisloe Cup. This began the twilight phase of Burke&#x27;s career where he was switched between various back-line positions before intermittently being recalled to starting fullback. Latham, who had performed strongly at Super Rugby level began his test career with many costly defensive errors at fullback in 2000 and 2001– which initially helped to preserve Burke&#x27;s place at the number 15 jersey.

===Lions series 2001===
Burke regained his starting fullback position for the Wallabies in the second test of the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, after Latham was dropped for a poor performance in the first game of the series. This was Burke&#x27;s first start in the number 15 jersey since the 1999 Rugby World Cup and he ended-up playing a starring role in the Australian comeback in the final two games. In the deciding third game, both sides drew on tries and conversions but his five penalties against three by future Newcastle Falcons teammate Jonny Wilkinson left the hosts 29–23 winners at Sydney&#x27;s Stadium Australia. To date, it is the only Australian series victory over the combined multi-nation British Lions. He was also part of the Wallabies team which beat the New Zealand All-blacks for the first time in 2001 at their traditional stronghold at Carisbrook, Dunedin.

===Positional switch to outside centre===
Burke was made to switch positions when playing for the Wallabies for most of the remainder of his career – at first to wing, and then to outside centre during a period of continual experimentation with the Wallabies back-line. This was initially done to accommodate both Chris Latham at test level, and for newly converted former professional rugby league footballer Mat Rogers at the state level for the NSW Waratahs (Rogers later playing fullback for the Wallabies as well while Latham was either benched or playing at wing). Burke was considered versatile enough to satisfactorily fulfill these roles whilst now primarily considered a specialist kicker. Many commentators said that he was restricted from playing more freely in a counter-attacking role, while not in his favoured fullback position. Burke himself has stated that he always considered himself a fullback and that the decision to switch him to outside centre was a mistake.

Complicating matters for national selectors, the Australian National Rugby Team now became saturated with a flurry of traded National Rugby League &#x27;convert&#x27; players ready to replace ageing back-line first generation professional players such as Burke (Rugby Union was only made a professional sport in 1996). Burke was otherwise retained as vice-captain and goal-kicker for the 2002 season. That year, he famously kicked a penalty after full-time to win the Bledisloe Cup in windy conditions at Stadium Australia – one of the last times his influence was crucial to the outcome of a match (and incidentally, the last time Australia held the Bledisloe Cup as of 2024).

===Rugby World Cup 2003===
In 2003 he was given back the starting fullback position, one last time – but ultimately did not perform well enough to retain it. Midway through the 2003 Rugby World Cup he was axed from the starting line-up following a narrow pool win over Ireland (17–16); a match in which he was substituted after 64 minutes. He was replaced by former professional rugby league footballer Mat Rogers, which drew mixed reactions and he would be relegated to the bench for the rest of his test career. By this time Mat Rogers was already the starting goal-kicker (after being brought on the field as a substitute in the world cup pool game against Namibia, Burke was signaled that Rogers was to continue as primary kicker by the coaching staff after attempting to take the ball from him for an attempt at goal) and he, along with Chris Latham, had finally emerged as the two preferred fullbacks. Future wallabies captain Stirling Mortlock had also simultaneously become the leading outside centre. Further diminishing the ageing Burke&#x27;s place on the team was the fact that there were now at least four other recognised goal-kickers in the team – Mortlock, Rogers, Matt Giteau and Elton Flatley – who all admirably performed as replacements to Burke. However Australia, to date, has never again had a regular goal kicker with a similar tenure.

===Final year with the Waratahs===
In 2004, any hope of rekindling his international career was over when he was controversially &quot;completely&quot; dropped from his state team, the NSW Waratahs. While he was injured early in that Super 12 season – he still managed to score 62 points from his first six games; placing him ahead of Andrew Mehrtens in the all-time points lead of the Super 12 (now Super Rugby) competition. Yet &#x27;inconsistent performance&#x27; was cited as the key reason behind the axing. Others have speculated his age as the reason for Burke&#x27;s dumping – this is questionable considering NSW simultaneously attempted to &#x27;convert&#x27; footballer Andrew Johns from rival code league, despite Johns&#x27; and Burke&#x27;s similar ages. NSW Coach (and former NSW and Australian teammate) Ewen McKenzie&#x27;s decision to drop Burke drew ire from many in the union fraternity, including Phil Kearns and Simon Poidevin, who accused McKenzie of disloyalty and being shortsighted.

In a sign of continued bad blood between the two, McKenzie would later ridicule suggestions that Burke would be recalled to the Australian Wallabies in 2007 (see below); describing it as return of the &quot;superannuation crew&quot;. Burke responded by deriding McKenzie&#x27;s apparent &quot;ignorance of British Club Football&quot; – where he was playing at that time. However, Burke would later endorse McKenzie for Wallabies coach prior to his appointment in late 2013.

Despite his expected retirement, Australian Coach Eddie Jones described Burke&#x27;s axing from the NSW squad as an &quot;independent event&quot; – indicating some use for Burke at test level. Indeed, Burke did appear intermittently as a substitute in various roles, including fullback, for the Wallabies in the 2004 season. He played his last international test for the Wallabies on 21 August 2004 against South Africa, coming off the bench for the final six minutes – where he missed a penalty attempt (Australia lost 23 – 19). In 2006, in his last international appearance, he was starting fullback for the World XV Rugby team against the South African Springboks for their first 2006 game – contributing 17 points (5 pen, 1 con) in their 27 to 30 points loss.

===Playing in England===
After losing his Super Rugby playing contract with the NSW Waratahs, Burke was offered contracts by eight different clubs – including other teams in the Super Rugby competition. Interested teams reportedly included the Queensland Reds and teams in New Zealand, South Africa, Italy, France and England. Wallaby coach Eddie Jones also kept the door open for further test duty depending on the availability/fitness of certain players for the Wallabies tour of the UK in late 2004, but Burke contradicted this statement by confirming his retirement and stating it was unlikely that he would play test rugby again.

Burke joined the Newcastle Falcons in the English Premiership. Here he has played alongside former English rival Jonny Wilkinson (his opposite kicker in Lions tour of Australia). He has also won the &#x27;Player of the Year&#x27; at the Falcons and was named as captain of the side. In February 2007, he obtained a British passport (while retaining Australian citizenship), qualifying through his England-born mother. His main reason for doing so was Guinness Premiership regulations prohibiting teams from having more than one non-European Union citizen on the field at any time. This enabled the Falcons to play him at the same time as New Zealand prop Joe McDonnell.

In 2007, there was again brief speculation that Burke would return as starting fullback for the Wallabies in the Tri-nations and Bledisloe Cup tournament; which would lead up to the world cup. Chris Latham was recovering from knee reconstruction and Mat Rogers had since returned to Rugby League. He was even formally approached by new Wallabies coach John Connolly regarding his availability for that season. Burke rejected this, citing commitments to his Newcastle side in the UK – but did state he would consider another approach regarding the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Burke was not ultimately approached, as Latham had sufficiently recovered. Had Burke come back to play for Australia – it would have set a new precedent as the ARU have stood firm in only considering Australia-based talent for Test selection since the game went professional in 1996.

===Retirement===
In May 2008 Burke announced his immediate retirement from playing after failing to recover from a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his knee suffered the previous October.

==Legacy in the game==
Owing to Matt Burke&#x27;s lasting impact in the New South Wales jersey, the Waratahs&#x27; Player of the Year is now awarded the &quot;Matt Burke Trophy&quot;. 

In addition to being a leading fullback and playing with the Wallabies for over a decade, Burke&#x27;s third year as New South Wales Waratahs captain saw him become the first player in the history of Waratah rugby to play over 100 games.

Burke is still Australia&#x27;s most capped fullback, having played 54 of his 81 Tests in that position. After breaking 1000 career points for NSW in 2003, he has scored 878 Test points for Australia. In Bledisloe Cup contests, he still holds the individual record for total test points against New Zealand (176 points in 17 Tests).

Burke was voted starting fullback in the &quot;Wallaby Team of the Decade&quot; which celebrated the first ten years of professional rugby union, spanning 1996 to 2005.

==Post-rugby sports and media career==
Since his retirement, Burke has opened a sports business that specialises in skills sessions for children. In early 2013, Burke joined Network Ten&#x27;s coverage of the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, and is an expert commentator for Australia&#x27;s coverage of the 2013 Rugby Championship.

In October 2013, Burke was appointed as sport presenter on &quot;10 News First&quot; in Sydney, after Brad McEwan moved to Melbourne to present sport for &quot;10 News First&quot;. Between September 2020 and September 2024, Burke also presented sport on the Brisbane bulletin, following a major restructure of 10&#x27;s news brand.

In October 2024, it was announced that Burke would depart Network 10 at the end of the year.

<text>In topology, a topological space formula_1 is called a compactly generated space or k-space if its topology is determined by compact spaces in a manner made precise below. There is in fact no commonly agreed upon definition for such spaces, as different authors use variations of the definition that are not exactly equivalent to each other. Also some authors include some separation axiom (like Hausdorff space or weak Hausdorff space) in the definition of one or both terms, and others don&#x27;t.

In the simplest definition, a &quot;compactly generated space&quot; is a space that is coherent with the family of its compact subspaces, meaning that for every set formula_2 formula_3 is open in formula_1 if and only if formula_5 is open in formula_6 for every compact subspace formula_7 Other definitions use a family of continuous maps from compact spaces to formula_1 and declare formula_1 to be compactly generated if its topology coincides with the final topology with respect to this family of maps. And other variations of the definition replace compact spaces with compact Hausdorff spaces.

Compactly generated spaces were developed to remedy some of the shortcomings of the category of topological spaces. In particular, under some of the definitions, they form a cartesian closed category while still containing the typical spaces of interest, which makes them convenient for use in algebraic topology.

==Definitions==

===General framework for the definitions===

Let formula_10 be a topological space, where formula_11 is the topology, that is, the collection of all open sets in formula_12

There are multiple (non-equivalent) definitions of &quot;compactly generated space&quot; or &quot;k-space&quot; in the literature. These definitions share a common structure, starting with a suitably specified family formula_13 of continuous maps from some compact spaces to formula_12 The various definitions differ in their choice of the family formula_15 as detailed below.

The final topology formula_16 on formula_1 with respect to the family formula_13 is called the k-ification of formula_19 Since all the functions in formula_13 were continuous into formula_21 the k-ification of formula_11 is finer than (or equal to) the original topology formula_11. The open sets in the k-ification are called the &#x27; in formula_24 they are the sets formula_25 such that formula_26 is open in formula_6 for every formula_28 in formula_29 Similarly, the &#x27; in formula_1 are the closed sets in its k-ification, with a corresponding characterization. In the space formula_31 every open set is k-open and every closed set is k-closed. The space formula_1 together with the new topology formula_16 is usually denoted formula_34

The space formula_1 is called compactly generated or a k-space (with respect to the family formula_13) if its topology is determined by all maps in formula_13, in the sense that the topology on formula_1 is equal to its k-ification; equivalently, if every k-open set is open in formula_31 or if every k-closed set is closed in formula_24 or in short, if formula_41

As for the different choices for the family formula_13, one can take all the inclusions maps from certain subspaces of formula_31 for example all compact subspaces, or all compact Hausdorff subspaces. This corresponds to choosing a set formula_44 of subspaces of formula_12 The space formula_1 is then &quot;compactly generated&quot; exactly when its topology is coherent with that family of subspaces; namely, a set formula_47 is open (resp. closed) in formula_1 exactly when the intersection formula_49 is open (resp. closed) in formula_6 for every formula_51 Another choice is to take the family of all continuous maps from arbitrary spaces of a certain type into formula_31 for example all such maps from arbitrary compact spaces, or from arbitrary compact Hausdorff spaces.

These different choices for the family of continuous maps into formula_1 lead to different definitions of &quot;compactly generated space&quot;. Additionally, some authors require formula_1 to satisfy a separation axiom (like Hausdorff or weak Hausdorff) as part of the definition, while others don&#x27;t. The definitions in this article will not comprise any such separation axiom.

As an additional general note, a sufficient condition that can be useful to show that a space formula_1 is compactly generated (with respect to formula_13) is to find a subfamily formula_57 such that formula_1 is compactly generated with respect to formula_59 For coherent spaces, that corresponds to showing that the space is coherent with a subfamily of the family of subspaces. For example, this provides one way to show that locally compact spaces are compactly generated.

Below are some of the more commonly used definitions in more detail, in increasing order of specificity.

For Hausdorff spaces, all three definitions are equivalent. So the terminology is unambiguous and refers to a compactly generated space (in any of the definitions) that is also Hausdorff.

===Definition 1===

Informally, a space whose topology is determined by its compact subspaces, or equivalently in this case, by all continuous maps from arbitrary compact spaces.

A topological space formula_1 is called compactly-generated or a k-space if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:

:(1) The topology on formula_1 is coherent with the family of its compact subspaces; namely, it satisfies the property:
::a set formula_47 is open (resp. closed) in formula_1 exactly when the intersection formula_49 is open (resp. closed) in formula_6 for every compact subspace formula_66
:(2) The topology on formula_1 coincides with the final topology with respect to the family of all continuous maps formula_28 from all compact spaces formula_69
:(3) formula_1 is a quotient space of a topological sum of compact spaces.
:(4) formula_1 is a quotient space of a weakly locally compact space.

As explained in the final topology article, condition (2) is well-defined, even though the family of continuous maps from arbitrary compact spaces is not a set but a proper class.

The equivalence between conditions (1) and (2) follows from the fact that every inclusion from a subspace is a continuous map; and on the other hand, every continuous map formula_28 from a compact space formula_6 has a compact image formula_74 and thus factors through the inclusion of the compact subspace formula_74 into formula_12

===Definition 2===

Informally, a space whose topology is determined by all continuous maps from arbitrary compact Hausdorff spaces.

A topological space formula_1 is called compactly-generated or a k-space if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:

:(1) The topology on formula_1 coincides with the final topology with respect to the family of all continuous maps formula_28 from all compact Hausdorff spaces formula_69 In other words, it satisfies the condition:
::a set formula_47 is open (resp. closed) in formula_1 exactly when formula_83 is open (resp. closed) in formula_6 for every compact Hausdorff space formula_6 and every continuous map formula_86
:(2) formula_1 is a quotient space of a topological sum of compact Hausdorff spaces.
:(3) formula_1 is a quotient space of a locally compact Hausdorff space.

As explained in the final topology article, condition (1) is well-defined, even though the family of continuous maps from arbitrary compact Hausdorff spaces is not a set but a proper class.

Every space satisfying Definition 2 also satisfies Definition 1. The converse is not true. For example, the one-point compactification of the Arens-Fort space is compact and hence satisfies Definition 1, but it does not satisfies Definition 2.

Definition 2 is the one more commonly used in algebraic topology. This definition is often paired with the weak Hausdorff property to form the category CGWH of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces.

===Definition 3===

Informally, a space whose topology is determined by its compact Hausdorff subspaces.

A topological space formula_1 is called compactly-generated or a k-space if its topology is coherent with the family of its compact Hausdorff subspaces; namely, it satisfies the property:
:a set formula_47 is open (resp. closed) in formula_1 exactly when the intersection formula_49 is open (resp. closed) in formula_6 for every compact Hausdorff subspace formula_66

Every space satisfying Definition 3 also satisfies Definition 2. The converse is not true. For example, the Sierpiński space formula_95 with topology formula_96 does not satisfy Definition 3, because its compact Hausdorff subspaces are the singletons formula_97 and formula_98, and the coherent topology they induce would be the discrete topology instead. On the other hand, it satisfies Definition 2 because it is homeomorphic to the quotient space of the compact interval formula_99 obtained by identifying all the points in formula_100

By itself, Definition 3 is not quite as useful as the other two definitions as it lacks some of the properties implied by the others. For example, every quotient space of a space satisfying Definition 1 or Definition 2 is a space of the same kind. But that does not hold for Definition 3.

However, for weak Hausdorff spaces Definitions 2 and 3 are equivalent. Thus the category CGWH can also be defined by pairing the weak Hausdorff property with Definition 3, which may be easier to state and work with than Definition 2.

==Motivation==

Compactly generated spaces were originally called k-spaces, after the German word &quot;kompakt&quot;. They were studied by Hurewicz, and can be found in General Topology by Kelley, Topology by Dugundji, Rational Homotopy Theory by Félix, Halperin, and Thomas.

The motivation for their deeper study came in the 1960s from well known deficiencies of the usual category of topological spaces. This fails to be a cartesian closed category, the usual cartesian product of identification maps is not always an identification map, and the usual product of CW-complexes need not be a CW-complex. By contrast, the category of simplicial sets had many convenient properties, including being cartesian closed. The history of the study of repairing this situation is given in the article on the &quot;n&quot;Lab on convenient categories of spaces.

The first suggestion (1962) to remedy this situation was to restrict oneself to the full subcategory of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces, which is in fact cartesian closed. These ideas extend on the de Vries duality theorem. A definition of the exponential object is given below. Another suggestion (1964) was to consider the usual Hausdorff spaces but use functions continuous on compact subsets.

These ideas generalize to the non-Hausdorff case; i.e. with a different definition of compactly generated spaces. This is useful since identification spaces of Hausdorff spaces need not be Hausdorff.

In modern-day algebraic topology, this property is most commonly coupled with the weak Hausdorff property, so that one works in the category CGWH of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces.

==Examples==

As explained in the Definitions section, there is no universally accepted definition in the literature for compactly generated spaces; but Definitions 1, 2, 3 from that section are some of the more commonly used. In order to express results in a more concise way, this section will make use of the abbreviations CG-1, CG-2, CG-3 to denote each of the three definitions unambiguously. This is summarized in the table below (see the Definitions section for other equivalent conditions for each).

For Hausdorff spaces the properties CG-1, CG-2, CG-3 are equivalent. Such spaces can be called &quot;compactly generated Hausdorff&quot; without ambiguity.

Every CG-3 space is CG-2 and every CG-2 space is CG-1. The converse implications do not hold in general, as shown by some of the examples below.

For weak Hausdorff spaces the properties CG-2 and CG-3 are equivalent.

Sequential spaces are CG-2. This includes first countable spaces, Alexandrov-discrete spaces, finite spaces.

Every CG-3 space is a T1 space (because given a singleton formula_101 its intersection with every compact Hausdorff subspace formula_102 is the empty set or a single point, which is closed in formula_103 hence the singleton is closed in formula_1). Finite T1 spaces have the discrete topology. So among the finite spaces, which are all CG-2, the CG-3 spaces are the ones with the discrete topology. Any finite non-discrete space, like the Sierpiński space, is an example of CG-2 space that is not CG-3.

Compact spaces and weakly locally compact spaces are CG-1, but not necessarily CG-2 (see examples below).

Compactly generated Hausdorff spaces include the Hausdorff version of the various classes of spaces mentioned above as CG-1 or CG-2, namely Hausdorff sequential spaces, Hausdorff first countable spaces, locally compact Hausdorff spaces, etc. In particular, metric spaces and topological manifolds are compactly generated. CW complexes are also Hausdorff compactly generated.

To provide examples of spaces that are not compactly generated, it is useful to examine &quot;anticompact&quot; spaces, that is, spaces whose compact subspaces are all finite. If a space formula_1 is anticompact and T1, every compact subspace of formula_1 has the discrete topology and the corresponding k-ification of formula_1 is the discrete topology. Therefore, any anticompact T1 non-discrete space is not CG-1. Examples include:
* The cocountable topology on an uncountable space.
* The one-point Lindelöfication of an uncountable discrete space (also called Fortissimo space).
* The Arens-Fort space.
* The Appert space.
* The &quot;Single ultrafilter topology&quot;.

Other examples of (Hausdorff) spaces that are not compactly generated include:
* The product of uncountably many copies of formula_108 (each with the usual Euclidean topology).
* The product of uncountably many copies of formula_109 (each with the discrete topology).

For examples of spaces that are CG-1 and not CG-2, one can start with any space formula_110 that is not CG-1 (for example the Arens-Fort space or an uncountable product of copies of formula_108) and let formula_1 be the one-point compactification of formula_113 The space formula_1 is compact, hence CG-1. But it is not CG-2 because open subspaces inherit the CG-2 property and formula_110 is an open subspace of formula_1 that is not CG-2.

==Properties==

(See the Examples section for the meaning of the abbreviations CG-1, CG-2, CG-3.)

===Subspaces===

Subspaces of a compactly generated space are not compactly generated in general, even in the Hausdorff case. For example, the ordinal space formula_117 where formula_118 is the first uncountable ordinal is compact Hausdorff, hence compactly generated. Its subspace with all limit ordinals except formula_118 removed is isomorphic to the Fortissimo space, which is not compactly generated (as mentioned in the Examples section, it is anticompact and non-discrete). Another example is the Arens space, which is sequential Hausdorff, hence compactly generated. It contains as a subspace the Arens-Fort space, which is not compactly generated.

In a CG-1 space, every closed set is CG-1. The same does not hold for open sets. For instance, as shown in the Examples section, there are many spaces that are not CG-1, but they are open in their one-point compactification, which is CG-1.

In a CG-2 space formula_31 every closed set is CG-2; and so is every open set (because there is a quotient map formula_121 for some locally compact Hausdorff space formula_110 and for an open set formula_25 the restriction of formula_124 to formula_125 is also a quotient map on a locally compact Hausdorff space). The same is true more generally for every locally closed set, that is, the intersection of an open set and a closed set.

In a CG-3 space, every closed set is CG-3.

===Quotients===

The disjoint union formula_126 of a family formula_127 of topological spaces is CG-1 if and only if each space formula_128 is CG-1. The corresponding statements also hold for CG-2 and CG-3.

A quotient space of a CG-1 space is CG-1. In particular, every quotient space of a weakly locally compact space is CG-1. Conversely, every CG-1 space formula_1 is the quotient space of a weakly locally compact space, which can be taken as the disjoint union of the compact subspaces of formula_12

A quotient space of a CG-2 space is CG-2. In particular, every quotient space of a locally compact Hausdorff space is CG-2. Conversely, every CG-2 space is the quotient space of a locally compact Hausdorff space.

A quotient space of a CG-3 space is not CG-3 in general. In fact, every CG-2 space is a quotient space of a CG-3 space (namely, some locally compact Hausdorff space); but there are CG-2 spaces that are not CG-3. For a concrete example, the Sierpiński space is not CG-3, but is homeomorphic to the quotient of the compact interval formula_99 obtained by identifying formula_132 to a point.

More generally, any final topology on a set induced by a family of functions from CG-1 spaces is also CG-1. And the same holds for CG-2. This follows by combining the results above for disjoint unions and quotient spaces, together with the behavior of final topologies under composition of functions.

A wedge sum of CG-1 spaces is CG-1. The same holds for CG-2. This is also an application of the results above for disjoint unions and quotient spaces.

===Products===

The product of two compactly generated spaces need not be compactly generated, even if both spaces are Hausdorff and sequential. For example, the space formula_133 with the subspace topology from the real line is first countable; the space formula_134 with the quotient topology from the real line with the positive integers identified to a point is sequential. Both spaces are compactly generated Hausdorff, but their product formula_135 is not compactly generated.

However, in some cases the product of two compactly generated spaces is compactly generated:
* The product of two first countable spaces is first countable, hence CG-2.
* The product of a CG-1 space and a locally compact space is CG-1. (Here, &quot;locally compact&quot; is in the sense of condition (3) in the corresponding article, namely each point has a local base of compact neighborhoods.)
* The product of a CG-2 space and a locally compact Hausdorff space is CG-2.

When working in a category of compactly generated spaces (like all CG-1 spaces or all CG-2 spaces), the usual product topology on formula_135 is not compactly generated in general, so cannot serve as a categorical product. But its k-ification formula_137 does belong to the expected category and is the categorical product.

===Continuity of functions===

The continuous functions on compactly generated spaces are those that behave well on compact subsets. More precisely, let formula_138 be a function from a topological space to another and suppose the domain formula_1 is compactly generated according to one of the definitions in this article. Since compactly generated spaces are defined in terms of a final topology, one can express the continuity of formula_140 in terms of the continuity of the composition of formula_140 with the various maps in the family used to define the final topology. The specifics are as follows.

If formula_1 is CG-1, the function formula_140 is continuous if and only if the restriction formula_144 is continuous for each compact formula_66

If formula_1 is CG-2, the function formula_140 is continuous if and only if the composition formula_148 is continuous for each compact Hausdorff space formula_6 and continuous map formula_150

If formula_1 is CG-3, the function formula_140 is continuous if and only if the restriction formula_144 is continuous for each compact Hausdorff formula_66

===Miscellaneous===

For topological spaces formula_1 and formula_156 let formula_157 denote the space of all continuous maps from formula_1 to formula_110 topologized by the compact-open topology. If formula_1 is CG-1, the path components in formula_157 are precisely the homotopy equivalence classes.

==K-ification==

Given any topological space formula_1 we can define a possibly finer topology on formula_1 that is compactly generated, sometimes called the of the topology. Let formula_164 denote the family of compact subsets of formula_12 We define the new topology on formula_1 by declaring a subset formula_3 to be closed if and only if formula_168 is closed in formula_169 for each index formula_170 Denote this new space by formula_34 One can show that the compact subsets of formula_172 and formula_1 coincide, and the induced topologies on compact subsets are the same. It follows that formula_172 is compactly generated. If formula_1 was compactly generated to start with then formula_176 Otherwise the topology on formula_172 is strictly finer than formula_1 (i.e., there are more open sets).

This construction is functorial. We denote formula_179 the full subcategory of formula_180 with objects the compactly generated spaces, and formula_181 the full subcategory of formula_179 with objects the Hausdorff spaces. The functor from formula_180 to formula_179 that takes formula_1 to formula_172 is right adjoint to the inclusion functor formula_187

The exponential object in formula_181 is given by formula_189 where formula_190 is the space of continuous maps from formula_1 to formula_110 with the compact-open topology.

These ideas can be generalized to the non-Hausdorff case. This is useful since identification spaces of Hausdorff spaces need not be Hausdorff.

<text>A prosumer is an individual who both consumes and produces. The term is a portmanteau of the words &quot;producer&quot; and &quot;consumer&quot;. Research has identified six types of prosumers: DIY prosumers, self-service prosumers, customizing prosumers, collaborative prosumers, monetised prosumers, and economic prosumers.

The terms &quot;prosumer&quot; and &quot;prosumption&quot; were coined in 1980 by Alvin Toffler, an American futurist, and were widely used by many technology writers of the time. Technological breakthroughs and a rise in user participation blurs the line between production and consumption activities, with the consumer becoming a prosumer.

==Definitions and contexts==

Prosumers have been defined as &quot;individuals who consume and produce value, either for self-consumption or consumption by others, and can receive implicit or explicit incentives from organizations involved in the exchange.&quot;

The term has since come to refer to a person using commons-based peer production.

In the digital and online world, &quot;prosumer&quot; is used to describe 21st-century online buyers because not only are they consumers of products, but they are able to produce their own products such as, customised handbags, jewellery with initials, jumpers with team logos, etc.

In the field of renewable energy, prosumers are households or organisations which at times produce surplus fuel or energy and feed it into a national (or local) distribution network; whilst at other times (when their fuel or energy requirements outstrip their own production of it) they consume that same fuel or energy from that grid. This is widely done by households by means of PV panels on their roofs generating electricity. Such households may additionally make use of battery storage to increase their share of self-consumed PV electricity, referred to as prosumage in the literature. It is also done by businesses which produce biogas and feed it into a gas network while using gas from the same network at other times or in other places. The European Union&#x27;s Nobel Grid project, which is part of their Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, uses the term in this way, for example.

The sharing economy is another context where individuals can act as prosumers. For example, in the sharing economy, individuals can be providers (e.g., Airbnb hosts, Uber drivers) and consumers (e.g., Airbnb guests, and Uber passengers). Prosumers are one avenue to grow the sharing economy.

Scholars have connected prosumer culture to the concept of McDonaldization, as advanced by sociologist George Ritzer. Referring to the business model of McDonald&#x27;s, which has emphasized efficiency for management while getting customers to invest more effort and time themselves (such as by cleaning up after themselves in restaurants), McDonaldization gets prosumers to perform more work without paying them for their labor.

== Origins and development ==
The blurring of the roles of consumers and producers has its origins in the cooperative self-help movements that sprang up during various economic crises, e.g. the Great Depression of the 1930s. Marshall McLuhan and Barrington Nevitt suggested in their 1972 book &quot;Take Today&quot;, (p. 4) that with electric technology, the consumer would become a producer. In the 1980 book, &quot;The Third Wave&quot;, futurologist Alvin Toffler coined the term &quot;prosumer&quot; when he predicted that the role of producers and consumers would begin to blur and merge (even though he described it in his book &quot;Future Shock&quot; from 1970). Toffler envisioned a highly saturated marketplace as mass production of standardized products began to satisfy basic consumer demands. To continue growing profit, businesses would initiate a process of mass customization, that is the mass production of highly customized products.

However, to reach a high degree of customization, consumers would have to take part in the production process especially in specifying design requirements. In a sense, this is merely an extension or broadening of the kind of relationship that many affluent clients have had with professionals like architects for many decades. However, in many cases architectural clients are not the only or even primary end-consumers.

Toffler has extended these and many other ideas well into the 21st century. Along with more recently published works such as &quot;Revolutionary Wealth&quot; (2006), one can recognize and assess both the concept and fact of the &quot;prosumer&quot; as it is seen and felt on a worldwide scale. That these concepts are having a global impact and reach, however, can be measured in part by noting in particular, Toffler&#x27;s popularity in China. Discussing some of these issues with Newt Gingrich on C-SPAN&#x27;s &quot;After Words&quot; program in June 2006, Toffler mentioned that &quot;The Third Wave&quot; is the second ranked bestseller of all time in China, just behind a work by Mao Zedong.

Don Tapscott reintroduced the concept in his 1995 book &quot;The Digital Economy.&quot;, and his 2006 book &quot;Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything&quot; with Anthony D. Williams. George Ritzer and Nathan Jurgenson, in a widely cited article, claimed that prosumption had become a salient characteristic of Web 2.0. Prosumers create value for companies without receiving wages.

Toffler&#x27;s Prosumption was well described and expanded in economic terms by Philip Kotler, who saw them as a new challenge for marketers. Kotler anticipated that people will also want to play larger role in designing certain goods and services they consume, furthermore modern computers will permit them to do it. He also described several forces that would lead to more prosumption like activities, and to more sustainable lifestyles, that topic was further developed by Tomasz Szymusiak in 2013 and 2015 in two marketing books.

Technological breakthrough has fastened the development of prosumption. With the help of additive manufacturing techniques, for example, co-creation takes place at different production stages: design, manufacturing and distribution stages. It also takes place between individual customers, leading to co-design communities. Similarly, mass customisation is often associated with the production of tailored goods or services on a large scale production. This increase in participation has flourished following the increasing popularity of Web 2.0 technologies, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Flickr.

In July 2020, an academic description reported on the nature and rise of the &quot;robot prosumer&quot;, derived from modern-day technology and related participatory culture, that, in turn, was substantially predicted earlier by science fiction writers.

== Criticism ==
Prosumer capitalism has been criticized as promoting &quot;new forms of exploitation through unpaid work gamified as fun&quot;.

== Examples ==

Identifiable trends and movements outside of the mainstream economy which have adopted prosumer terminology and techniques include:
*a &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; (DIY) approach as a means of economic self-sufficiency or simply as a way to survive on diminished income
*the open source software movement creates software on their own, prime example is the successful operating system Linux which now dominates the server domain
*Fablab movement, self-fabrication capabilities especially 3D printing
*the voluntary simplicity movement that seeks personal, social, and environmental goals through prosumer activities such as:
**growing one&#x27;s own food
**repairing clothing and appliances rather than buying new items
**playing musical instruments rather than listening to recorded music
*use of new media-creation and distribution technologies to foster independent, open, non-profit, &quot;consumer-to-consumer&quot; media and cultures (see Wikipedia, Indymedia, most of Creative Commons); many involved in independent media reject mass culture generated by concentrated corporate media

<text>The afro is a hair style created by combing out natural growth of afro-textured hair, or specifically styled with chemical curling products by individuals with naturally curly or straight hair. The hairstyle can be created by combing the hair away from the scalp, dispersing a distinctive curl pattern, and forming the hair into a rounded shape, much like a cloud or puff ball.

For people with wavy or straight hair, the hair style is created with the help of permanent hair structure-changing creams or gels and/or other solidifying liquids to temporarily hold the hair in place. Particularly popular in the African American community of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the hairstyle is often shaped and maintained with the assistance of a wide-toothed comb colloquially known as an Afro pick.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Afro&quot; is derived from the term &quot;Afro American&quot;. The hairstyle is also referred to by some as a &quot;natural hairstyle&quot;. In most cases the hair is left untreated by relaxers or straightening chemicals and is instead allowed to express its natural curl or kinkiness.

== History in the United States ==
=== African-American hairstyles prior to the 1960s ===

During the history of slavery in the United States, most African Americans styled their hair in an attempt to mimic the styles of the predominantly white society in which they lived. Afro-textured hair, characterized by its tight kinks, has been described as being kinky, coarse, cottony, nappy, or woolly. These characteristics represented the antithesis of the European American standard of beauty, and led to a negative view of kinky hair. As a result, the practice of straightening gained popularity among African Americans.

The process of straightening the hair often involved applying caustic substances, such as relaxers containing lye, which needed to be applied by an experienced hairstylist so as to avoid burning the scalp and ears. Those who chose not to artificially treat their hair would often opt to style it into tight braids or cornrows. With all of these hairstyling methods, one ran the risk of damaging the hair shaft, sometimes resulting in hair loss.

=== 1960s and 1970s ===

The effect of the Civil Rights Movement brought a renewed sense of identity to the African–American community, which also resulted in a redefinition of personal style that included an appreciation of black beauty and aesthetics, as embodied by the &quot;Black is beautiful&quot; movement. This cultural movement marked a return to more natural, untreated hairstyles. The afro became a powerful political symbol which reflected black pride and a rejection of notions of assimilation and integration—not unlike the long and untreated hair sported by the mainly White hippies.

To some African Americans, the afro also represented a reconstitutive link to West Africa and Central Africa. However, some critics have suggested that the afro hairstyle is not particularly African: In his book &quot;Welcome to the Jungle: New Positions in Black Cultural Studies&quot;, cultural critic Kobena Mercer argued that the contemporary African society of the mid-20th century did not consider either hairstyle to denote any particular &quot;Africanness&quot;; conversely, some Africans felt that these styles signified &quot;First-worldness&quot;.

Similarly, Brackette F. Williams stated in her book &quot;Stains on My Name, War in My Veins: Guyana and the Politics of Cultural Struggle&quot; that African nationalists were irritated by the afro&#x27;s adoption by African Americans as a symbol of their African heritage; they saw this trend as an example of Western arrogance.
The afro was adopted by both men and women and was a hairstyle that was easier to maintain by oneself, without requiring frequent and sometimes costly visits to the hairstylist as was often experienced by people who chose to braid, straighten or relax their hair. Due to the kinky pattern prominent in Afro-textured hair, as it grows longer it has a tendency to extend outward from the head, resulting in a domelike hairstyle which is easily molded and sculpted into the desired shape. While the afro was a much less invasive and time-consuming hairstyle choice for many African Americans, some chose to achieve a more voluminous version of the afro by backcombing or teasing the hair, a practice that can result in damage to the hair and scalp.

In the mid-1960s, the afro hairstyle began in a fairly tightly coiffed form, such as the hairstyle that became popular among members of the Black Panther Party. As the 1960s progressed towards the 1970s, popular hairstyles, both within and outside of the African-American community, became longer and longer. As a result, the late 1960s/early 1970s saw an expansion in the overall size of afros. Some of the entertainers and sociopolitical figures of the time known for wearing larger afros include political activist Angela Davis, actress Pam Grier, rock musician Jimi Hendrix, singer Miriam Makeba, and the members of the musical groups the Jackson 5 and the Supremes.

In contrast, the afro&#x27;s popularity among African Americans had already started to wane by the early 1970s; the introduction of the hairstyle to the mainstream and its adoption by people of non-African descent caused the afro to lose its radical, political edge. The 1970s saw an increase in the popularity of braided hairstyles such as cornrows among both sexes of African Americans.

=== 1990s and 2000s ===

The afro saw some resurgence in both the 1990s and the 2000s. These afros would take varied forms, some incorporating elements such as braids, beads or twists, as well as various sizes, from close-cropped natural hairstyles all the way to expansive afro wigs.
Some African Americans who have been known for wearing afros or afro wigs during these two decades include NBA basketball players Ben Wallace, Kobe Bryant, and Michael Beasley, as well as musicians Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, Macy Gray, Ludacris, Questlove, Cindy Blackman, Wiz Khalifa, and Lenny Kravitz. Beyoncé also donned a large afro wig for her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in the 2002 film &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;.

On July 3, 2019, California became the first U.S. state to prohibit discrimination over natural hair. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the CROWN Act into law, banning employers and schools from discriminating against hairstyles such as afros, braids, twists, and dreadlocks. Likewise, later in 2019 Assembly Bill 07797 became law in New York state; it &quot;prohibits race discrimination based on natural hair or hairstyles.&quot;

Aevin Dugas from Gonzales, Louisiana, USA, set a new Guinness World Record on 11 September 2022, for the largest female afro, which measures 165 cm (5.41 ft) in circumference, 25 cm (9.84 in) in height, and 26 cm (10.24 in) in width. She has broken the Guinness World Record for the largest afro three times, including in 2010 and 2021. Dugas says she began growing her afro in 1999 and learned how to style and cut it herself after an unsuccessful trip to a professional hairstylist. She states that she broke the record to personally advocate for the beauty of natural hair and to encourage self-love.

== Similar styles internationally ==
A &quot;Jewfro&quot; (portmanteau of the words Jew and afro) or (rarely) &quot;Isro&quot; (portmanteau of the words Israel and afro) refers to an afro when worn by Jews. The term has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s when many prominent figures were described as sporting the hairstyle. In 1970, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called college football star Scott Marcus a flower child with &quot;golden brown hair ... in ringlets around his head in what he calls a Jewish afro style&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in a 1971 article on Harvard University&#x27;s &quot;hairy&quot; basketball team, wrote that Captain Brian Newmark &quot;hasn&#x27;t had a haircut since last May, and his friends have suggested his hairdo is a first cousin to the Afro, the style that is popular with blacks. In the case of the Jewish junior from Brooklyn, though, the bushy dark hair that is piled high on his head has been called an &quot;Isro&quot;.&quot; Novelist Judith Rossner was described in a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; profile as the &quot;grown-up Wunderkind with an open, oval face framed by a Jewish Afro.&quot;

The Hadendoa Beja of northeastern Africa were nicknamed &quot;Fuzzy-Wuzzies&quot; by British troops during the Mahdist War due to their large and mop-like hairstyles, which they shaped by applying butter or mutton fat. In Somalia, some young men of the nomadic and sedentary communities would grow their hair long and carefully comb it into rather large bushes, which they would then hold in place with ghee. This elaborate hairstyle was quite distinct from another coiffure found among other Somalis, who would instead grow long and fluff out their fine, straight hair and place a chewing stick and comb in the center.

Variations of the afro have been worn by one or both sexes in the many disparate cultures of the African continent. Due to the hairstyle&#x27;s links to members of the civil rights and Black Power movements, the afro was seen by several outside cultures as a dangerous symbol of political unrest, including Tanzania where the Afro was banned in the 1970s because it was seen as a symbol of neocolonialism and as part of a &quot;cultural invasion&quot; from the United States. In the 1950s and 1960s, South African women were also known to wear their hair in an afro-type style.

The afro did not rise to the same level of popularity among the Afro-Caribbean community as it did in the United States, in part because of the popularity of dreadlocks, which played an important role in the Rastafari movement. Not unlike the afro&#x27;s significance among the members of the American Black Power movement, dreadlocks symbolized black pride and empowerment among the Rastafari of the Caribbean.

== Tools ==

The long, wide teeth of the &quot;afro pick&quot; or afro comb were designed to dig down to the scalp, allowing the hair to be stretched out from the roots into a desired style or shape using a picking motion.

<doc id="899395" wikidata="Q7046933" url="?curid=899395" title="Noel Estrada">
<text>Noel Epinanio Estrada Suárez (June 4, 1918 – December 1, 1979) was a Puerto Rican composer. He was the author of &quot;En mi Viejo San Juan&quot;, a song &quot;widely known around the world&quot;.

==Early years==
Estrada was born in the town of Isabela, Puerto Rico where he received his primary education. During the Great Depression, many Puerto Ricans either emigrated to the mainland United States (mainly to the northeastern coast area) or joined the armed forces, with the hope of improving their economic situation. At the outbreak of World War II, Estrada joined and served in the United States Army. Being away from his homeland for the first time in his life would in the future serve him as inspiration when composing the bolero &quot;En mi viejo San Juan&quot;. In his youth, he joined Fi Sigma Alfa fraternity. He also completed a Bachelor in Business Administration from the University of Puerto Rico. 

==Musical compositions==
Estrada became a government employee after being honorably discharged from the Army. He was a protocol official for the State Department. It was during the 1940s and 1950s that he wrote and interpreted his songs in Puerto Rico and in the U.S.

Among the many songs which he wrote were the following: &quot;El Romance del Cafetal&quot; (Romance of the coffee field); &quot;Verde Navidad&quot; (Green Christmas); &quot;El Amor del Jíbaro&quot; (The poor farmers Love); &quot;Pobre Amor&quot; (Poor Love); &quot;Pedacito de Borinquen&quot; (A piece of Puerto Rico); &quot;Amor del Alma&quot; (Love of the Soul); &quot;Lo Nuestro Termino&quot; (Our love is Finished); &quot;Llévame a Ver a Jesús&quot; (Take Me to see Jesus&quot;); etcetera. However, it was &quot;En mi Viejo San Juan&quot; (In my Old San Juan) that would bring Estrada international acclaim.

==&quot;En Mi Viejo San Juan&quot;==
Estrada composed &quot;En mi Viejo San Juan&quot; in the 1940s, in New York City. It is Estrada&#x27;s most popular composition, and is considered a second national anthem by many Puerto Ricans, especially those who live abroad. The City of San Juan honored Estrada as an adopted citizen and would later adopt the song as its official city anthem.

==Later years==
Estrada&#x27;s composition &quot;Mi romantico San Juan&quot; (My romantic San Juan) won a first prize in the &quot;Festival of the Puerto Rican Composer&quot;. In 1966, the City of San Juan honored Estrada by declaring him its adopted son.

Noel Estrada died in the City of San Juan in 1979. He was buried at Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery. San Juan and the town of Isabela have honored Estrada&#x27;s memory by naming streets and a school after him.

<doc id="899406" wikidata="Q7877705" url="?curid=899406" title="The Strong Arms of the Ma">
<text>&quot;The Strong Arms of the Ma&quot; is the ninth episode of the fourteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 2, 2003. It is the 300th episode to be broadcast; though &quot;Barting Over&quot; is indicated on-screen to be the 300th episode, it is actually the 302nd. In the episode, Marge develops agoraphobia in response to a traumatic mugging and overcomes the fear through exercise and bodybuilding, which leads to her taking anabolic steroids and experiencing a change in personality.

Carolyn Omine wrote the episode, and Pete Michels directed. Pamela Reed guest starred as recurring character Ruth Powers.

==Plot==
The Simpson family goes to Rainier Wolfcastle&#x27;s bankruptcy garage sale. Homer asks Rainier if he has anything that will increase in value when he dies, and is shown an old weight-lifting set, complete with dumbbells and bench press, which he ends up buying. While loading the car with the family&#x27;s various purchases, Homer fails to leave the room for himself, forcing Marge to drive back home by herself while Homer is carried back by Rainier. On the way home, Marge and the kids discover that Maggie has soiled her diaper. Marge pulls into the Kwik-E-Mart, and changes Maggie in the restroom. As she is leaving the store, a shady character accosts her and threatens her with a gun. Finding only diapers in Marge&#x27;s purse, he grabs Marge&#x27;s pearl necklace and runs off. Marge, stunned, walks to her car in a daze and breaks down crying at the wheel in front of her kids.

The next day, they inform the police and Chief Wiggum declares he will investigate immediately. Later, as Marge is about to leave the house, Homer gives her pepper spray and some tips on how to handle an attacker. She pulls up to the Kwik-E-Mart, but she snaps when Ralph greets her. She pepper-sprays him on impulse and, feeling guilty, drives back home where she feels safe. When she reaches home, Bart tells her she is parked over the mailman. Marge cannot bring herself to cross the threshold of her house to help the mailman. Dr. Hibbert diagnoses Marge with agoraphobia. Homer and the kids try their best over the next few days to encourage her to go outside, but to no avail. Eventually, she moves into the basement. There, feeling a bit safer, she prepares breakfast for the family and sets up a bed for herself. One day, when she is alone at home, she eyes Rainier Wolfcastle&#x27;s weight-lifting set and decides to use it to pass the time. In two weeks, she builds herself up and gets well-defined abdominal muscles, much to Homer&#x27;s delight. She dashes out to the garden to get some lemons and, realizing that she is not afraid anymore, starts running around town. She runs into her mugger; even though the mugger is not aggressive against Marge, she assaults him and beats him up in revenge. The cops arrive and arrest the crook, and Marge starts exercising even more. One day, as she jogs by an open-air gym at the beach, she runs into Ruth Powers, her old neighbor. Ruth is also very muscular, and tells Marge that she owes it all to anabolic steroids. She talks Marge into using them, and also advises Marge to enter a women&#x27;s bodybuilding contest. Using the steroids, Marge exercises harder than ever, becoming very muscular and estrogen-depleted, which results in a short temper and violent behavior. Homer, seeing these changes, finds himself less attracted to her. When Homer refuses Marge&#x27;s sexual advances the night before the contest, she callously ignores his worries and then proceeds to pin him down and rapes him, before leaving him completely sore and exhausted to take care of the kids the next morning.

That night, the family attends the Iron Maiden Fitness Pageant to see the women&#x27;s bodybuilding final. Marge wins second place, which irritates her when she overhears her family&#x27;s unhappy conversation in the audience. Later that night, at Moe&#x27;s, Marge boasts to all the male attendees about her performance at the competition. Homer then tells her he is proud of her ability to bulk up but not lose her femininity. Marge is angered by that, saying that was the reason she came in second place. She then tells everyone at the bar that she intends to up her usage of drugs, and flies into an uncontrollable rage and trashes the bar. Homer confronts his wife as she prepares to hurl Lenny at him. Terrified, Homer tells Marge that he misses the sweet, feminine woman he married. Marge, horrified with what she has done, apologizes, drops Lenny, and leaves with Homer. In order to cover the costs of repairing his bar, Moe sets fire to it to receive insurance money; however, Carl points out that the place has not been insured yet.

Later, at the Simpson house, Marge burns the weight set in the furnace as the episode ends. Homer asks if Marge is ready for a &quot;real workout&quot; which turns out to be a request to wax the car, after which he gets beaten by Marge until he says that he was just kidding.

==Production==
In her original pitch for the episode, Carolyn Omine had Homer being the one to get mugged, becoming agoraphobic as a result. Staff writer Al Jean had the idea of Marge becoming a bodybuilder after going through these events, so it was changed from Homer to Marge. Omine was initially concerned that while Homer being mugged is humorous, Marge being mugged is serious, and later acknowledged that it turned into a &quot;rare serious moment that was kinda cool&quot;. The episode had many light moments to balance this out. Jean thought that showing Marge threatened and vulnerable was a great emotional moment that had not been done on the show before. He notes that the attacker ripping off her pearl necklace makes her seem &quot;naked&quot; and that it changes her.

Jean noted that when characters go very off model, it can cause issues. He noted that some were thrown off by the Marge-on-steroids look and said Marge probably should not have gotten as muscular as she did. The idea behind the design was that Marge, wanting to never be weak again, ends up overcompensating to become super aggressive and overpowering. Omine said that these things, plus her becoming less likable and off-model, was a negative combination.

==Themes==
&quot;Strong Arms of the Ma&quot; addresses the issue of steroid rage. After becoming addicted to the drug, Marge has a moment of realization, claiming &quot;steroids have turned me into everything I hate&quot;. While the authors of &quot;The Psychology of the Simpsons: D&#x27;oh!&quot; do not condone the &quot;violent destruction&quot; of Marge in the episode, they reason that both the in-universe characters and the real-world audience attribute Marge&#x27;s behavior to the drugs and not an &quot;innately mean personality&quot;. They argue that Marge was not &quot;herself&quot;. Mood changes and aggression are both documented side effects of &quot;prolonged steroid use&quot;.

==Cultural references==
The episode title is a reference to the common phrase &quot;the long arm of the law&quot;. The way that Marge defends herself against her mugger is an homage to a scene in the film &quot;The Godfather&quot; in which Sonny Corleone beats up Carlo Rizzi. In the bar scene where Marge looks upon her destruction, Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Adagio for strings&quot; – also used in the film &quot;Platoon&quot; – plays in the background.

A reference to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; season one episode eight &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; is seen in the scene where Marge runs over the mailman and he has enough time to read a magazine but his glasses break. &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; theme plays after.

The sequence where Homer loads the car is a direct parody of Tetris, including the Type A music from the Game Boy version and the game over music from the Nintendo Entertainment System version.

Marge and the rest of the female bodybuilders depicted are shown with physiques of professional female bodybuilders, even though the Iron Maiden Fitness Pageant is an amateur bodybuilding contest. Their physiques are based on in real life professional female bodybuilders, with bodybuilder #17 resembling Iris Kyle. Much like in real life, steroids are assumed to be necessity for competing in bodybuilding, both amateur and professional. Marge is shown doing a most muscular pose in Moe&#x27;s.

==Reception==
Reviewing this season, DVD Verdict said, &quot;There are some real clinkers this season. Both &#x27;Large Marge&#x27; and &#x27;Strong Arms of the Ma&#x27; prove that writing good episodes about Marge seem to be out of the question by this point.&quot;

Cinema.com describes the premise as &quot;Marge becomes agoraphobic (yes, only for one episode) after being mugged on the street and rather strangely decides that the best thing to do is take up weight lifting. It’s just a silly as it sounds. Another dud of an episode.

DVD Talk said, &quot;What&#x27;s encouraging is that the 300th episode, whether it&#x27;s ‘Barting Over’ or ‘Strong Arms of the Ma,’ is simply a number to the writers and producers of The Simpsons at this point, rather than a finish line. As of this writing, the show is knocking on the doorstep of 500 and doesn&#x27;t appear to be slowing down at the moment, and it&#x27;s slight changes in focus for the show&#x27;s seasons that make it worth appreciating, and this one is no different.&quot;

<doc id="899407" wikidata="Q327465" url="?curid=899407" title="Imperial Regalia of Japan">
<text>The are the imperial regalia of Japan and consist of the sword , the mirror , and the jewel . They represent the three primary virtues: valour (the sword), wisdom (the mirror), and benevolence (the jewel). The actual historical status of these legendary treasures is unknown as they are intentionally kept from public view to symbolize authority.

Representations of the regalia are used in masakaki in many Shinto rituals.

==Legend==
According to legend, these treasures were brought to Earth by Ninigi-no-Mikoto, legendary ancestor of the Japanese imperial line, when his grandmother, the sun goddess Amaterasu, sent him to pacify Japan. These treasures were eventually said to be passed down to Emperor Jimmu, who was the first Emperor of Japan and Ninigi&#x27;s great-grandson. Traditionally, they were a symbol of the emperor&#x27;s divinity as a descendant of Amaterasu, confirming his legitimacy as paramount ruler of Japan. When Amaterasu hid in a cave from her brother Susanoo-no-Mikoto, thus plunging the world in darkness, the goddess Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto hung the mirror and jewels outside the cave and lured her out of hiding. Upon emerging from the cave, Amaterasu was so startled by her reflection in the mirror that it gave the gods an opportunity to extract her. Susanoo later presented the sword Kusanagi to Amaterasu as a token of apology; he had obtained it from the body of an eight-headed serpent, Yamata no Orochi.

At the conclusion of the Genpei War in 1185, the six-year-old Emperor Antoku and the Regalia were under the control of the Taira clan. They were present when the Taira were defeated by the rival Minamoto clan at the Battle of Dan-no-ura, which was fought on boats in the shallow Kanmon Straits. Although there are some medieval texts relating to the loss of the sword, which variously contended that a replica was forged afterwards, or that the lost sword itself was a replica, or even that the sword was returned to land by supernatural forces; replicas of the sword and mirror were actually made as early as the 9th century, and the original sword is considered entrusted to Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya. The importance of the Imperial Regalia to Japan is evident from the declarations made by Emperor Hirohito to Kōichi Kido on 25 and 31 July 1945 at the end of World War II, when he ordered the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan to protect them &quot;at all costs&quot;.

==Role==

Since 690, the presentation of these items to the Emperor by the priests at the shrine has been a central element of the enthronement ceremony. This ceremony is not public, and these items are by tradition seen only by the Emperor and certain priests. While their actual locations are not confirmed, it is commonly thought that the sword is located at the Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya, the jewel is located at the Three Palace Sanctuaries in Kōkyo (the Imperial Palace in Tokyo), and the mirror is located at the Ise Grand Shrine in Mie Prefecture. Their first post-World War II enthronement appearance occurred during the accession and enthronement of Akihito in 1989 and 1990. Aside from their presence during the abdication of Akihito on 30 April 2019, their latest appearance occurred during the enthronement of Emperor Naruhito. He formally took possession of the regalia in a brief ceremony on 1 May 2019. The items themselves were never revealed during these public occasions as they remained shrouded from view in packages or boxes.

When these items are not being used for their ceremonial purpose, their supposed locations are kept off limits to the public. Mikael Adolphson, a professor at Cambridge University, stated that this hidden strategy &quot;adds mystique, and thus, authority, to the objects.&quot; He went on to say that Shinto religious tradition is &quot;especially protective&quot; of its symbols. There is a general reluctance in Japan to allow a historical analysis of the regalia as such an assessment could potentially &quot;de-mythologize&quot; the items.

Scholars consider the imperial regalia to represent the fusion of Japan&#x27;s ancient indigenous groups with new arrivals. The three treasures are a symbol that the emperor should unite the ethnic groups without discrimination.

==Cultural references==

* The phrase &quot;Three Sacred Treasures&quot; is retrospectively applied to durable goods of modern Japan. During a policy address in 2003, then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said that during the mid-1950s and mid-1960s, the &quot;three sacred treasures&quot; for durable goods were the washing machine, refrigerator, and the black and white television, and the automobile, air conditioner, and color television set from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s.

* In &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood&quot;, the Primal Susano was contained in three treasures sacred to the tortoise-like Kojin of the Ruby Sea; the sword Ame no Murakumo, the mirror Yata-no-Kagami, and the gem Yasakani-no-Magatama. When the three treasures were brought together, Susano was restored and challenged the player to battle.
* In &quot;Noragami&quot;, the shinkis, i.e. spirits that gods use for various tasks and purposes, of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu are called &quot;three sacred treasures&quot;; they are named &quot;Mikagami&quot; (the mirror), &quot;Mitama&quot; (the magatama jewel), and &quot;Mitsurugi&quot; (the sword).
* In &quot;Ōkami&quot;, Amaterasu uses three types of divine instruments based on the three sacred treasures: Reflectors (the mirror), Rosaries (the jewels), and Glaives (the sword).
* In &quot;Naruto&quot;, Orochimaru uses the &quot;Kusanagi Blade&quot; against the third hokage. Itachi is seen using attacks utilizing Yasakani beads and the &quot;Yata Mirror.&quot; Itachi also uses the &quot;Totsuka Blade&quot; which is said to be a variant of the Kusanagi Blade.
* In Kid Icarus, Pit uses the &quot;Three Sacred Treasures&quot; to beat Medusa. They are the &quot;Arrow of Light&quot;, the &quot;Mirror Shield&quot;, and the &quot;Wings of Pegasus&quot;.
* In the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game, the &quot;Mikanko&quot; archetype features cards referencing the three sacred treasures: &quot;Ha-Re the Sword&quot;, &quot;Ni-Ni the Mirror&quot; and &quot;Hu-Li the Jewel&quot;, all of which have names deriving from descendants of the sun goddess Amaterasu, in which a fourth card, &quot;Ohime the Manifested&quot;, appears to represent.

<text>The Miami Conservancy District is a river management agency operating in Southwest Ohio to control flooding of the Great Miami River and its tributaries. It was organized in 1915 following the catastrophic Great Dayton Flood of the Great Miami River in March 1913, which hit Dayton, Ohio particularly hard. Designed by Arthur Ernest Morgan, the Miami Conservancy District built levees, straightened the river channel throughout the Miami Valley, and built five dry dams on various tributaries to control flooding. The district and its projects are unusual in that they were funded almost entirely by local tax initiatives, unlike similar projects elsewhere which were funded by the federal government and coordinated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

==Historical perspective==

The 1913 flood has been ascribed in part to the 1912 eruption of Mount Katmai and its daughter volcano Novarupta in Alaska. In one of the greatest recorded volcanic events, Novarupta emitted enough fine ash into the atmosphere to block sunlight and cool the climate of the Northern Hemisphere that winter.

The success of the Miami Conservancy District helped to inspire the development of the much larger Tennessee Valley Authority during the Great Depression. The district was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1972.

==Dams==

The district manages five dry dams. They are hydraulic fill dams constructed from 1919 to 1922 using fill trestles.

===Englewood Dam===

Located near Englewood, Englewood dam is the largest of the dams maintained by the district. It regulates the flow of the Stillwater River into the Great Miami River. It consists of of earth, is high and stretches . U.S. Route 40 crosses the top of the dam. The dam can contain of flood water over . It was constructed in 1919 and consists of as much earth as the Great Pyramid of Giza.

===Germantown Dam===
Located near Germantown, Germantown Dam regulates the flow of Twin Creek into the Great Miami River. It consists of of earth, is high and wide. The dam can contain of flood water over (12 km²). It was constructed in 1920.

===Huffman Dam===

Located near Fairborn, Huffman Dam regulates the flow of the Mad River into the Great Miami River. It consists of of earth, is high and spans . The dam can contain of flood water over .

===Lockington Dam===

Located north of Piqua outside the village of Lockington, Lockington dam regulates the flow of Loramie Creek into the Great Miami River. It consists of of earth, is high and spans . The dam can contain of flood water over (15 km²). It was constructed in 1919.

===Taylorsville Dam===

Located near Vandalia, Taylorsville Dam regulates the Great Miami River. It consists of of earth, is high and spans . When full, the dam would inundate (39 km²). It was constructed in 1919. US 40 also runs across this dam.

==Recreation==
The Miami Conservancy District (MCD) actively promotes and develops recreational amenities throughout the Great Miami River Watershed. MCD owns and/or maintains an extensive recreation trail system (nearly 34 miles) throughout Montgomery County. The trail system is part of a network of 340 miles of multi-use, paved path that connect Dayton east to Xenia and near Chillicothe and London, south to Franklin, west to near Greenville, and north to Piqua.

MCD maintains several boat ramps to encourage recreation on the Great Miami River Watershed waterways. MCD also offers river recreation maps to the Great Miami, Mad and Stillwater rivers which make up the national and state-designated Great Miami River Watershed Water Trail – the largest water trail system in Ohio. The trail collectively offers 291 miles of waterway accessible to recreational boaters, fishermen and wildlife watchers.

Low dams: MCD owns three low dams. Only Two-mile Dam in Hamilton is part of the flood protection system. The other low dams create a pool of water upstream of each dam for recreation, including boating and fishing. The cities of Hamilton, West Carrollton, and Moraine pay an assessment for MCD to maintain the recreational dams.

RiverWalk: The Dayton RiverWalk runs along the levee-top between the Main Street Bridge and the Monument Avenue (Dayton View) Bridge on each side of the Great Miami River. The total length of the lighted, crushed gravel walkway loop, including the two bridges, is about 1 mile. The walkway is easily accessible from the end of either bridge.

All of these projects were constructed and are maintained by funds separate from flood protection or groundwater assessments. Assessments to cities – as well as grants and other revenue sources – pay for the construction and maintenance of MCD recreation amenities.

<text>Onești (; ), formerly known as Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, is a city in Bacău County, Romania, with a population of 34,005 inhabitants as of 2021. It is situated in the historical region of Moldavia.

Administratively, the villages of Slobozia and Borzești form part of Onești.

==History==

The locality was documentary attested as a village on 14 December 1458. In 1952, the communist authorities decided to build a large petrochemical industrial platform (Borzești Petrochemical Plant) and a new related city in the area of Onești and Borzești villages. Borzești, according to legend, was the birthplace of Stephen III of Moldavia. It is the site of the Borzești Church, which was built on his orders in 1493–1494.

At the death of the Communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej in March 1965, Onești was renamed &quot;Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej&quot;, but the name was changed back in 1990 shortly after the Romanian Revolution.

Above the borough Malu, on the right-hand side of the river Cașin, were discovered archaeological fragments from a settlement dating from the Neolithic.

==Geography==
Onești is located in the Tazlău-Cașin Depression of the Eastern Carpathians at an average altitude of . It lies at the confluence of the rivers Trotuș, Cașin, Oituz, and Tazlău, some southwest of the county capital, Bacău. The city is crossed by the European road E574 and by the national roads DN11A and DN12A that connect it to Bucharest, to the northern part of the country, and to Transylvania. Rail connections are made through the Căile Ferate Române network, and the proposed A13 Brașov–Bacău Motorway will link the city to the rest of Romania&#x27;s highway network as a second connection to the country&#x27;s major cities.

==Demographics==

At the 2011 census, Onești had 39,172 inhabitants, of which 90.29% were Romanians, 1.39% Roma, 0.53% Hungarians, and 0.13% Greeks. At the 2021 census, the city had a population of 34,005; of those, 79.75% were Romanians, and for 19.77% the ethnicity was not known.

==Economy==
Borzești is a neighborhood in the southeast of Onești, under separate administration until 1968. The Borzești Petrochemical Plant is located there.

==Culture==
Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of the city, whose inhabitants are predominantly Romanian Orthodox. St. Nicholas Day, 6 December, is the municipal day of Onești.

Popular tourist attractions are Perchiu Hill and the Hero Cross from atop the aforementioned hill, the Municipal History Museum, a steel monument dedicated to the Romanian national poet Mihai Eminescu, and the city park.

<doc id="899417" wikidata="Q61530" url="?curid=899417" title="August Sander">
<text>August Sander (17 November 1876 – 20 April 1964) was a German portrait and documentary photographer. His first book &quot;Face of our Time&quot; (German: &quot;Antlitz der Zeit&quot;) was published in 1929. Sander has been described as &quot;the most important German portrait photographer of the early twentieth century&quot;. Sander&#x27;s work includes landscape, nature, architecture, and street photography, but he is best known for his portraits, as exemplified by his series &quot;People of the 20th Century&quot;. In this series, he aims to show a cross-section of society during the Weimar Republic.

==Early life==
Sander was born on 17 November 1876, in Herdorf, the son of a carpenter working in the mining industry. He had six siblings.

==Career==
While working at the local Herdorf iron-ore mine, Sander first learned about photography by assisting a photographer from Siegen who was also working for the mining company. With financial support from his uncle, he bought photographic equipment and set up his own darkroom.

Sander spent his military service (1897–1899) as an assistant to Georg Jung of Trier; they worked throughout Germany including in Berlin, Magdeburg, Halle, Leipzig and Dresden. In 1901, he started working for &quot;Photographische Kunstanstalt Grei&quot;f photo studio in Linz, Austria-Hungary, becoming a partner in 1902, and then sole-owner. In the late 1940s he joined the Upper Austrian Art Society. Sander left Linz at the end of 1909 or 1910 and set up a new studio at Dürener Strasse 201 in the Lindenthal district of Cologne. 

In 1911, Sander began with the first series of portraits for his work &quot;&quot;. In this series, he aims to show a cross-section of society during the Weimar Republic. The series is divided into seven sections: The Farmer, The Skilled Tradesman, Woman, Classes and Professions, The Artists, The City, and The Last People (homeless persons, veterans, etc.).

In the early 1920s, he came in contact with the Cologne Progressives, a radical group of artists linked to the workers&#x27; movement, which, as Wieland Schmied put it, &quot;sought to combine constructivism and objectivity, geometry and object, the general and the particular, avant-garde conviction and political engagement, and which perhaps approximated most to the forward looking of New Objectivity [...] &quot;. In 1927, Sander and writer Ludwig Mathar travelled through Sardinia for three months, where he took around 500 photographs. However, a planned book detailing his travels was not completed.

Sander&#x27;s &quot;Face of our Time&quot; was published in 1929. It contains a selection of 60 portraits from his series &quot;People of the 20th Century&quot;, and is introduced by an essay by Alfred Döblin titled &quot;On Faces, Pictures, and their Truth&quot;. Under the Nazi regime, his work and personal life were greatly constrained. Sander&#x27;s 1929 book &quot;Face of our Time&quot; was seized in 1936 and the photographic plates destroyed.

Around 1942, during World War II, he left Cologne and moved to the small village of Kuchhausen, in the Westerwald region; this allowed him to save the most important part of his body of work. His Cologne studio was destroyed in a 1944 bombing raid, but tens of thousands of negatives, which he had left behind in a basement near his former apartment in the city, survived the war. to negatives in this basement were then destroyed in a 1946 fire. That same year, Sander began his postwar photographic documentation of the city. He also tried to record the mass rape of German women by Red Army soldiers in the Soviet occupation zone.

In 1953, Sander sold a portfolio of 408 photographs of Cologne, taken between 1920 and 1939, to the Kölnisches Stadtmuseum. These would be posthumously published in book format in 1988, under the title &quot;Köln wie es war&quot; (Cologne as it was).

In 1962, 80 photographs from the &quot;People of the 20th Century&quot; project were published in book format, under the name &quot;Deutschenspiegel. Menschen des 20. Jahrhunderts&quot; (German Mirror. People of the 20th Century).

==Personal life and death==
Sander married Anna Seitenmacher in 1902. They gave birth to Erich (son, born in 1903) and Gunther (son, born in 1907), and twins in 1911, Sigrid and Helmut; only Sigrid survived. Anna died on 27 May 1957, in Kuchhausen, Germany.

Erich, who was a member of the left wing Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (SAP), was arrested by Nazis in 1934 and sentenced to 10 years in prison, where he died of an untreated ruptured appendix in 1944, shortly before the end of his sentence.


Sander died in Cologne of a stroke on 20 April 1964. He was buried next to his son Erich in Cologne&#x27;s Melaten Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In 1984, Sander was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

In Wim Wenders&#x27; 1987 film (&quot;Wings of Desire&quot;), the character Homer (played by Curt Bois) studies the portraits of &quot;People of the 20th Century&quot; (1980 edition) while visiting a library.

In 2008, the Mercury crater Sander was named after him.

The highest price reached by one of his photographs was when &quot;Bricklayer&quot; sold by $ at Sotheby&#x27;s New York, on 11 December 2014.

===Ownership rights===
In 1992, Gerd Sander, August&#x27;s grandson, sold the archive to German nonprofit art foundation SK Stiftung Kultur. It is on display at Die Photographische Sammlung/SK Stiftung Kultur.

In 2017, Julian Sander, Gerd&#x27;s son, claimed to represent August&#x27;s estate, and issued a press release stating that the archive would now be housed by Hauser &amp; Wirth. The claim has been disputed by SK Stiftung Kultur, and the ownership dispute is still ongoing.

In 2022, Julian Sander made available non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of the entire archive of Sander negatives on NFT platform OpenSea. Buying a Sander NFT was free apart from initial upload fees. However for all resale transactions thereon, via a smart contract Julian Sander would receive 7.5% of the resale cost and photographer Alejandro Cartagena&#x27;s Fellowship Trust would receive 2.5%. All NFTs in the collection were claimed and, within a few weeks, over 400 ETH was traded in secondary sales on OpenSea. Soon and without warning, the archive was delisted from OpenSea because SK Stiftung Kultur claimed that as it owns the copyright to Sander&#x27;s work until 2034, the NFT collection is thus in violation of copyright law. Julian Sander argues that the doctrine of fair use allows him to publish the images in such commercial settings.

<text>A dry dam is a dam constructed for the purpose of flood control. Dry dams typically contain no gates or turbines, and are intended to allow the channel to flow freely during normal conditions. During periods of intense rainfall that would otherwise cause floods, the dam holds back the excess water, releasing it downstream at a controlled rate.

Development of dry dams was pioneered by the Miami Conservancy District which built five such dams on tributaries to the Great Miami River to prevent flooding of the Miami Valley and Dayton, Ohio.

<text>Records and firsts in spaceflight are broadly divided into crewed and uncrewed categories. Records involving animal spaceflight have also been noted in earlier experimental flights, typically to establish the feasibility of sending humans to outer space.

The notion of &quot;firsts&quot; in spaceflight follows a long tradition of firsts in aviation, but is also closely tied to the Space Race. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union and the United States competed to be the first countries to accomplish various feats. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial orbital satellite. In 1961, Soviet Vostok 1 cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to enter space and orbit the Earth, and in 1969 American Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the Moon. No human has traveled beyond low Earth orbit since 1972, when the Apollo program ended.

During the 1970s, the Soviet Union directed its energies to human habitation of space stations of increasingly long durations. In the 1980s, the United States began launching its Space Shuttles, which carried larger crews and thus could increase the number of people in space at a given time. Following their first mission of détente on the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the Soviet Union and the United States again collaborated with each other on the Shuttle-Mir initiative, efforts which led to the International Space Station (ISS), which has been continuously inhabited by humans for over 20 years.

Other firsts in spaceflight involve demographics, private enterprise, and distance. Dozens of countries have sent at least one traveler to space. In 1963, Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space, aboard Vostok 6. In the early 21st century, private companies joined government agencies in crewed spaceflight: in 2004, the sub-orbital spaceplane SpaceShipOne became the first privately funded crewed craft to enter space; in 2020, SpaceX&#x27;s Dragon 2 became the first privately developed crewed vehicle to reach orbit when it ferried a crew to the ISS. As of , the uncrewed probe &quot;Voyager 1&quot; is the most distant artificial object from the Earth, part of a small class of vehicles that are leaving the Solar System.

== First independent suborbital and orbital human spaceflight by country ==
==Human spaceflight firsts==

Note: Some space records are disputed as a result of ambiguities surrounding the border of space. Most records follow the FAI definition of the space border which the FAI sets at an altitude of 100 km (62.14 mi). By contrast, US agencies define the border of space at 50 mi (80.47 km).

==Duration records==
===Total human spaceflight time by country===
===Most time in space===
The record for most time in space is held by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who has spent 1110 days, 14 hours, 57 minutes in space over five missions. He broke the record of Gennady Padalka on 4 February 2024 at 07:30:08 UTC during his fifth spaceflight aboard Soyuz MS-24/25 for a one year long-duration mission on the ISS. He later became the first person to stay 900, 1,000, and 1,100 days in space on 25 February 2024, 4 June 2024, and 12 September 2024 respectively. Gennady Padalka is currently second, having spent 878 days in space. He himself had broken the all-time duration record on 28 June 2015 when he surpassed the previous record holder, cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who spent 803 days, 9 hours and 39 minutes (about 2.2 years) during six spaceflights on Soyuz, the Space Shuttle, Mir, and the International Space Station.

===Ten longest human spaceflights===


===Longest single flight by a woman===
NASA astronaut Christina Koch holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman (328 days), returning on February 6, 2020. During Expedition 61, she surpassed NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson&#x27;s 289 days from 2016-2017.

===Longest continuous occupation of space===
An international partnership consisting of Russia, the United States, Canada, Japan, and the member states of the European Space Agency have jointly maintained a continuous human presence in space since 31 October 2000 when Soyuz TM-31 was launched. Two days later, it docked with the International Space Station. Since then space has been continuously occupied for .

===Longest continuous occupation of a spacecraft===
The International Space Station has been continuously occupied by a Russian and US crew member since 2 November 2000 (). It broke the record of 9 years and 358 days of the Soviet/Russian Space Station Mir on 23 October 2010.

===Longest solo flight===
Valery Bykovsky flew solo for 4 days, 23 hours in Vostok 5 from 14 to 19 June 1963. The flight set a space endurance record which was broken in 1965 by the (non-solo) Gemini 5 flight. The Apollo program included long solo spaceflight, and during the Apollo 16 mission, Ken Mattingly orbited solo around the Moon for more than 3 days and 9 hours.

===Longest time on the lunar surface===
Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt of the Apollo 17 mission stayed for 74 hours 59 minutes and 40 seconds (over 3 days) on the lunar surface after they landed on 11 December 1972. They performed three EVAs (extra-vehicular activity) totaling 22 hours 3 minutes, 57 seconds. As Apollo commanders were the first to leave the LM and the last to get back in, Cernan&#x27;s EVA time was slightly longer.

===Longest time in lunar orbit===
Ronald Evans of Apollo 17 mission stayed in lunar orbit for 6 days and 4 hours (148 hours) along with five mice. For the solo portion of a flight around the Moon, Ken Mattingly on Apollo 16 spent 1 hour 38 minutes longer than Evans&#x27; solo duration.

==Speed and altitude records==

===Farthest humans from Earth===
The Apollo 13 crew (Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert), while passing over the far side of the Moon at an altitude of from the lunar surface, were from Earth. This record-breaking distance was reached at 00:21 UTC on 15 April 1970.

===Highest altitude for crewed non-lunar mission===
Polaris Dawn crew Jared Isaacman, Scott Poteet, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon fired their Crew Dragon Resilience&#x27;s Draco thrusters on 11 September 2024 at 00:27 UTC, at 15 hours and 4 minutes after liftoff and achieved a record apogee altitude of .

===Fastest===

The Apollo 10 crew (Thomas Stafford, John W. Young and Eugene Cernan) achieved the highest speed relative to Earth ever attained by humans: 39,897 kilometers per hour (11,082 meters per second or 24,791 miles per hour, about 32 times the speed of sound and 0.0037% of the speed of light). The record was set 26 May 1969.

The record for uncrewed spacecraft is held by the Parker Solar Probe at 191.7 km/s, about 1/1600 (or 0.064%) the speed of light, relative to the Sun. This speed was first reached in December 2024.

* Woman: Peggy Whitson (aged ), on Axiom Mission 2 on 21 May 2023 (9 days, 5 hours and 27 minutes).

=== Spacewalk ===

==== Youngest ====
* Man – Alexei Leonov (aged ), during Voskhod 2.
* Woman – Sarah Gillis, (aged ), during Polaris Dawn.

==== Oldest ====
* Man – Michael Barratt (aged ), during ISS Expedition 71.
* Woman – Peggy Whitson (aged ), during ISS Expedition 72.

==Spacewalk records==
===Most spacewalks (number and duration)===
Both of these are the record for the largest total number of spacewalks by a male and a female, and the most cumulative time spent on spacewalks by a male and a female.
* Man – Anatoly Solovyev, 16 spacewalks for a total time of 82 hours, 21 minutes.
* Woman (number) – Peggy Whitson, 10 spacewalks for a total time of 60 hours, 21 minutes.
* Woman (cumulative time) – Sunita Williams, 9 spacewalks for a total time of 62 hours, and 6 minutes.

===Most spacewalks during a single mission===
* 7: Anatoly Solovyev, during Expedition 24 on the Soviet/Russian space station Mir, in 1997–98. (Two were internal &quot;spacewalks&quot; inside a depressurized module.)
* 7: Andrew Morgan, during his first spaceflight on board the ISS for Expedition 60/61/62 in 2019–2020, he spent 45 hours and 48 minutes outside the station.

===Longest spacewalks===
* Man – Cai Xuzhe and Song Lingdong, 9 hours 6 minutes, during the Shenzhou 19 mission on 17 December 2024, as they installed space debris protection devices on the exterior of the Tiangong Space Station.
* Woman – Susan Helms, 8 hours 56 minutes, along with James Voss on an ISS assembly mission during Shuttle mission STS-102 on 11 March 2001. The spacewalkers were delayed early in their excursion when a device to help hold an astronaut&#x27;s feet to the shuttle&#x27;s robot arm became untethered, and Voss had to retrieve a spare from storage on the exterior of the station&#x27;s &quot;Unity&quot; module. After about six hours of work, the pair reentered Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s airlock.

===Greatest distance from a spacecraft during a spacewalk===
*All-time (and while on a planetary body): 7.6 kilometers (4.7 miles, 25,029 feet), Apollo 17, Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt, EVA-2, December 12, 1972. During their second of three moonwalks, Cernan and Schmitt rode the Lunar Roving Vehicle to geological station 2, Nansen Crater, at the foot of the South Massif. As all spacewalks not occurring on a planetary body (the Moon) have involved short maximum distances from the spacecraft (see below), this remains the furthest distance that humans have traveled away from the safety of a pressurizable spacecraft, during an EVA of any type.
*Orbital flight: about 100 meters (or 330 feet), Bruce McCandless, STS-41-B, February 7, 1984. With the exception of six Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) sorties in 1984 and a test of the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) in 1994, all other orbital spacewalks have involved a safety tether, anchoring the spacefarer to the spacecraft at a short distance. Among the former untethered spacewalks, Bruce McCandless&#x27; first test of the MMU established an orbital EVA distance record from a spacecraft which remained unbroken by later untethered EVAs.

== Animal records ==
===First animals in space===
The first animals to enter space were fruit flies launched by the United States in 1947 aboard a V-2 rocket to an altitude of . They were also the first animals to safely return from space. Albert II, a rhesus monkey, became the first mammal in space aboard a U.S. V-2 rocket on June 14, 1949, and died on reentry due to a parachute failure. The first dogs in space were launched 22 July 1951 aboard a Soviet R-1V. &quot;Tsygin&quot; and &quot;Dezik&quot; reached a height of and safely parachuted back to Earth. This flight preceded the first American canine space mission by two weeks.

===First animal in orbit===
Laika was a Soviet female canine launched on 3 November 1957 on Sputnik 2. The technology to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so there was no expectation for survival. She died several hours into flight. Belka and Strelka became the first canines to safely return to Earth from orbit on 19 August 1960.

===First Hominidae in space===
On 31 January 1961, through NASA&#x27;s Mercury-Redstone 2 mission the chimpanzee Ham became the first great ape in space.

===Longest canine single flight===
Soviet space dogs (, &quot;Light Wind&quot;) and (, &quot;Ember&quot;) were launched on 22 February 1966 on board Cosmos 110 and spent 22 days in orbit before landing on 16 March.

===First animals beyond low Earth orbit===
An assortment of animals including a pair of Russian tortoises, as well as wine flies and mealworms flew around the Moon with a number of other biological specimens including seeds and bacteria on a circumlunar mission aboard the Soviet Zond 5 spacecraft on 18 September 1968. It had been launched by a Proton-K rocket on 14 September.

Zond 5 came within of the Moon and then successfully returned to Earth, the first spacecraft in history to return safely to Earth from the Moon.

<doc id="899428" wikidata="Q1746040" url="?curid=899428" title="Piano Sonata No. 4 (Scriabin)">
<text>The Piano Sonata No. 4 in F-sharp major, Op. 30, was written by Alexander Scriabin around 1903 and first published in 1904. It consists of two movements, &quot;Andante&quot; and &quot;Prestissimo volando&quot;, and is one of Scriabin&#x27;s shortest piano sonatas (a typical performance takes about 8 minutes). The sonata is generally considered to be the beginning of Scriabin&#x27;s middle period due to the newly mystical sonorities and tonal ambiguity of the first movement. It remains one of the most performed of Scriabin&#x27;s sonatas.

== Stylistic traits ==

The sonata is written in a post-Romantic style, similar to Scriabin&#x27;s other works of the time. The first movement, expressive and calm, is monothematic (based on a single theme). The second movement, celebratory and climactic, starts &quot;attacca&quot; right after the &quot;Andante&quot; movement.

A more Romantic idea is the use of cyclic form in restating the &quot;Andante’s&quot; main theme (&quot;dolcissimo&quot;) as the ecstatic climax of the &quot;Prestissimo volando&quot; movement (&quot;Focosamente&quot;, &quot;giubiloso&quot;). This outlay appears closely related to the last two movements from the 3rd sonata, also linked by an &quot;attacca&quot;, where the climax of the finale likewise restates the lyrical &quot;Andante&quot; theme of the third movement. Russian composers such as Tchaikovsky or Rachmaninoff often restated the lyric theme of the finale movement as climactic coda (for example in the piano concertos). Scriabin instead returns to the &#x27;slow&#x27; movement&#x27;s theme, and this may have led to further experiments with a condensation of form in the single-movement 5th sonata where the climax (&quot;estatico&quot;) is again a restatement of the &quot;Languido&quot; theme (&quot;dolcissimo&quot;).

== Background ==
Scriabin wrote a poem after composing this sonata that explains its meaning:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;In a light mist, transparent vapor
Lost afar and yet distinct
A star gleams softly.

How beautiful! The bluish mystery
Of her glow
Beckons me, cradles me.

O bring me to thee, far distant star!
Bathe me in trembling rays
Sweet light!

Sharp desire, voluptuous and crazed yet sweet
Endlessly with no other goal than longing
I would desire

But no! I vault in joyous leap
Freely I take wing.

Mad dance, godlike play!
Intoxicating, shining one!

It is toward thee, adored star
My flight guides me.

Mad dance, godlike play!
Intoxicating, shining one!

Toward thee, created freely for me
To serve the end
My flight of liberation!

In this play
Sheer caprice
In moments I forget thee
In the maelstrom that carries me
I veer from thy glimmering rays.

In the intensity of desire
Thou fadest
O distant goal.

But ever thou shinest
As I forever desire thee!

Thou expandest, Star!
Now thou art a Sun
Flamboyant Sun! Sun of Triumph!

Approaching thee by my desire for thee
I lave myself in thy changing waves
O joyous god.

I swallow thee
Sea of light.

My self-of-light
I engulf thee!&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The Shuffle Demons are a Canadian jazz fusion band from Toronto.

==Early career==
The band were formed in 1984 by saxophonist Richard Underhill in collaboration with a variety of Toronto-area jazz musicians including Mike Murley, Dave Parker and Stich Wynston. They performed as buskers in the Toronto area before recording the full-length album &quot;Streetniks&quot;, which was released in 1986.

The band had a surprise Top 40 hit in Canada with their 1986 single &quot;Spadina Bus&quot;. The song referred to the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s Spadina Avenue bus in Toronto. The album became the best-selling independent release in Canadian music history as of that time, and was a Juno Award nominee for Best Jazz Album at the Juno Awards of 1987.

&quot;Spadina Bus&quot; was also later used as the theme to CITY-TV&#x27;s show &quot;Speakers&#x27; Corner&quot;.

The Shuffle Demons released four more albums over the next seven years. They never scored another mainstream pop hit, although the video &quot;Get Out of My House, Roach&quot; received considerable airplay on MuchMusic. They retained a devoted following on the jazz scene, however.

In 1987, they appeared on the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram&#x27;s Elephant Show&quot; during season four.

==Later career and breakup==
The group played jazz, folk, world and rock festivals from Halifax to Vancouver and from Italy to Estonia from 1986 – 1997, touring across Canada 15 times and through Europe 15 times. The Shuffle Demons featured a fusion of hard bop and rap combined with exotic costumes and a no-holds-barred performance style. Over the course of 15 European tours they were a hit at several Jazz festivals including the North Sea Jazz, Molde Jazz, London’s Outside In Jazz festival, the Edinburgh Jazz festival, the Sfinks festival, Jazz a Vienne, and FiESTa Internationale in Estonia.

Murley and Vivian left the band in 1989, and were replaced by Perry White and George Koller. Koller left in 1993, and was replaced by Mike Milligan. The following year, Wynston and White left the band, and were replaced by Eric St. Laurent and Greg Smith.

Parker left in 1995. The band subsequently broke up in 1997.

==Reformation and international touring==
Underhill, Parker, White, Wynston, Koller and Milligan reformed the band in 2004, releasing a new greatest hits CD to coincide with their reunion tour. During the tour, the band also coordinated a successful attempt at a world record for the largest number of people playing saxophone simultaneously. The official Guinness Book of Records count is 900 participants, all playing the theme from &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;.

The Shuffle Demons continue to tour and performed at festivals in India, China and Europe in 2006 and in Thailand, South Korea and the USA in 2010 with great success. In the summer of 2011, the band performed at the Rochester, NY and Kingston, ON Jazz Festivals, as well as touring Australia and New Zealand.

In 2012, &quot;Clusterfunk&quot;, their first album of new material in seventeen years, was released. It was recorded and mixed between January and September of the previous year, at Canterbury Music and Inception Sound, both located in Toronto.

<text>Francis Perrin (17 August 1901 – 4 July 1992) was a French physicist,
who worked on nuclear physics, fission and neutrinos. He was the high-commissioner Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique (Atomic Energy Commission, CEA) in France and a collaborator of CERN. He was involved in the development of nuclear weapons for France and the cooperation with Israel on nuclear research.

He was the son of Physics Nobel laureate Jean Perrin and the brother-in-law of Pierre Victor Auger. 
== Physicist ==
Francis Perrin was born in Paris and attended École Normale Supérieure in Paris. In 1928 he obtained a doctorate in mathematical sciences from the faculté des sciences of Paris, based upon a thesis on Brownian motion and became a faculty member of Collège de France. In 1933, in connection with the neutrino, Francis Perrin estimated that &quot;the mass must be null—or at least small compared to the mass of the electron&quot;. Subsequently, he worked at the Collège de France on the fission of uranium. With Frédéric Joliot and his group, he established in 1939 the possibility of nuclear chain reactions and nuclear energy production.

He was professor at the Collège de France in the chair of Atomic and Molecular Physics from 1946 to 1972. He was the French high-commissioner for atomic energy from 1951 to 1970. 

Perrin actively supported the project for a European nuclear research centre, and was a signatory for France to the Convention establishing the CERN Provisional Council in February 1952 in Geneva. He was elected vice-president of this council, and remained French delegate on the CERN Council until 1972.

== Nuclear High-Commissioner ==

Named High-Commissioner of the Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique (Atomic Energy Commission, CEA) in 1951—to replace Frédéric Joliot-Curie dismissed because he was opposed to military research—, Francis Perrin joined a lobby of about a dozen people, composed of politicians like Chaban-Delmas, Bourguès-Maunoury and Félix Gaillard, of military officers, like the generals Ailleret, Gallois, and Crépin, of technocrats like Pierre Guillaumat and Raoul Dautry or of scientists like Yves Rocard and Bertrand Goldschmidt, who revealed themselves to be extremely effective. This lobby imposed on successive governments of the Fourth Republic an intensive research program to permit France to deploy nuclear weapons without any real political control from outside France. Secret departments were made up within the CEA to implement this policy as of 1954. General Charles de Gaulle was informed of the work during his &quot;Crossing of the Desert&quot; (1953/58), in particular by Chaban-Delmas. When de Gaulle returned to power in 1958, the progress of the work was such that the date of the first nuclear test was already fixed at 1960.

In 1986 he stated publicly that in 1949 Israeli scientists were invited to the Saclay Nuclear Research Centre, this cooperation leading to a joint effort including sharing of knowledge between French and Israeli scientists especially those with knowledge from the Manhattan Project.

== Personal life ==
Francis Perrin married Colette Auger, the sister of the physicist Pierre Auger. Francis Perrin was the president of Union des Athées (Union of Atheists) after his resignation from the French atomic energy commission.

A French research laboratory, associating the Atomic Energy Comissariat and the National Centre for Scientific Research, was named after him.

<doc id="899439" wikidata="Q3554084" url="?curid=899439" title="Miami Valley">
<text>The Miami Valley is the land area surrounding the Great Miami River in southwest Ohio, USA, and includes the Little Miami, Mad, and Stillwater rivers as well. Geographically, it includes Dayton, Springfield, Middletown, Hamilton, and other communities. The name is derived from the Miami Indians.

Commonly, however, it refers to the economic and cultural-social region centered on the Greater Dayton area. Middletown and Hamilton both fall under the economic and cultural-social influence of Cincinnati and thus are not commonly included in this sense. Institutions and enterprises in the Dayton area, such as Miami Valley Career Technology Center, Miami Valley Hospital, Miami Valley Young Marines, Miami Valley Council of the Boy Scouts of America and Miami Valley Storytellers illustrate local usage.

==History==
During the mid-twentieth century, among the largest employers in the Valley were Procter &amp; Gamble in Cincinnati, Champion Paper and Fiber in Hamilton, Armco in Middletown, and National Cash Register in Dayton.

==Counties and cities==
Local television stations WDTN, ThinkTV (WPTD and WPTO), WHIO-TV, WKEF and WRGT include the following counties and cities in the cultural Miami Valley:
*Montgomery County (Dayton)
*Greene County (Xenia)
*Preble County (Eaton)
*Clark County (Springfield)
*Miami County (Troy)
*Darke County (Greenville)
*Champaign County (Urbana)
*Shelby County (Sidney)
*Logan County (Bellefontaine)
*Butler County (Hamilton)
*Warren County (Lebanon)
*Wayne County, Indiana (Richmond)
*Mercer County (Celina)
*Auglaize County (Wapakoneta)

Additionally, WHIO includes the following locations in its news and weather coverage:
*Clinton County (Wilmington)
*Union County, Indiana (Liberty)
*Randolph County, Indiana (Winchester)

==Transportation==
===Transit===
*Butler County Regional Transit Authority - Primarily serves Hamilton, Middletown and Oxford
*Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority
*Greene CATS Public Transit - Serves Xenia
*Rose View Transit - Serves Richmond, IN
*Springfield City Area Transit

===Major highways===
*Interstate 75 - Runs north to south along the valley and through downtown Dayton.
*Interstate 70 - Traverses the valley from east to west.
*Interstate 71 - Runs north to south along the eastern half of the Miami Valley.
*Interstate 675 - Bypasses Dayton from I-75 south of the city to I-70 east of it.
*U.S. Route 35 - Runs east to west through the Dayton metro area.
*U.S. Route 68 - Runs north to south through farmlands in the eastern Miami Valley.
*U.S. Route 127 - Runs north to south through several cities and rural communities in the western Miami Valley.
*Ohio State Route 129 - Connects Hamilton to I-75.
*Ohio State Route 49 - Forms a bypass west of Dayton and continues north into Darke County.

==Demographics==

As Greater Cincinnati grows northward through Butler County, it could conceivably merge with Greater Dayton by 2030, thereby virtually erasing any boundary between the two current Combined Statistical Areas (CSA). As a result, the US Census Bureau could begin reporting the Cincinnati and Dayton metropolitan areas as one by that time, though it would be up to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to make the merger decision. The new Cincinnati–Dayton metropolitan area would be comparable in size to that of the Orlando–Deltona–Daytona Beach, FL CSA and place it within the top 20 most populous metros in the US, with a population of nearly 3.0 million.

<text>The Dartmouth Skiway is a ski area in the northeastern United States, in Lyme, New Hampshire. Located about twenty minutes northeast of Dartmouth College, it has thirty trails from easiest (green circle) to most difficult (black diamond) on over of skiable area.

== The mountain ==

The Dartmouth Skiway has a lift-served summit elevation of above sea level and a base elevation of , yielding a vertical drop of . Its longest trail is . There are three lifts which serve the trails at the skiway, including the Winslow Mountain Quad, the Holt&#x27;s Ledge Double, and the Magic Carpet Beginner Lift. These lifts give the ski area an uphill capacity of 3,300 skiers per hour.

Snowmaking covers about seventy percent of the area with over fifteen snowguns. There is a terrain park located on the Winslow side. The Dartmouth Skiway Ski and Snowboard School has a staff of over 35 instructors. The slopes are patrolled by the Dartmouth Ski Patrol, a joint community and student first aid volunteer organization. The Dartmouth Ski Team hosts the alpine skiing events of the Dartmouth Winter Carnival there annually.

== History ==

Descended from an earlier, smaller operation on nearby Oak Hill in Hanover, the Dartmouth Skiway opened in 1957 with a Pomalift on one peak. For the 1960–61 season, a T-bar was also erected for a novice slope. In 1968, a new trail pod was opened with a double chairlift, located across the street on Winslow Ledge.

In the 1970s and 1980s, many improvements were made to the area, including replacing the Pomalift with a Hall double chairlift and snowmaking installation. In the next ten years a CTEC quad chairlift was installed and the new McLane Family Lodge was constructed, replacing the previous one. Like many other New England ski resorts, it hosts events and functions in the off-season.

Dartmouth Skiway hosted the NCAA Skiing Championships in 1958 and 2003.

<doc id="899442" wikidata="Q496266" url="?curid=899442" title="Charade (1963 film)">
<text>Charade is a 1963 American romantic screwball comedy mystery film produced and directed by Stanley Donen, written by Peter Stone and Marc Behm, and starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. The cast also features Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, Dominique Minot, Ned Glass and Jacques Marin. It spans three genres: suspense thriller, romance and comedy.

&quot;Charade&quot; was praised by critics for its screenplay and the chemistry between Grant and Hepburn. It has been called &quot;the best Hitchcock movie Hitchcock never made&quot;. It was filmed on location in Paris and contains animated titles by Maurice Binder. Henry Mancini&#x27;s score features the popular theme song &quot;Charade&quot;.

In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

While on holiday in the French Alps, Regina &quot;Reggie&quot; Lampert, an American expatriate working as a simultaneous interpreter, tells her friend Sylvie that she is divorcing her husband Charles. She also meets Peter Joshua, a charming American.

On her return to Paris, she finds her apartment stripped bare. A police inspector says that Charles auctioned off their belongings, then was murdered after leaving Paris. Reggie is given Charles&#x27;s small travel bag containing a letter addressed to her, a ship ticket to Venezuela, four passports in multiple names and nationalities, and miscellaneous personal items. At Charles&#x27;s sparsely attended funeral, three men show up to view the body. One sticks a pin into the corpse to confirm Charles is dead. Another uses a hand mirror to see if he is breathing.

Reggie is summoned to meet CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholomew at the American Embassy. She learns that the three men are Herman Scobie, Leopold W. Gideon and Tex Panthollow. During World War II, they, Charles, and Carson Dyle were assigned by the OSS to deliver $250,000 ($ million in current dollars) in gold to the French Resistance, but instead stole it. Carson was wounded in a German ambush and left behind. Charles double-crossed the others, taking all the gold. The three survivors are after the missing money, as is the U.S. government. Hamilton insists that Reggie has it, even if she does not know what or where it is—and that she is in great danger.

Peter finds Reggie and helps her move into a hotel. The three criminals separately threaten her, each convinced that she knows where the money is. Herman shocks her by claiming that Peter is in cahoots with them, after which Peter says that he is Carson Dyle&#x27;s brother Alexander and is trying to bring the others to justice, believing they killed Carson. As the hunt for the money continues, Herman and Leopold are murdered. Hamilton tells Reggie that Carson Dyle had no brother. When she confronts Alexander, he says that he is Adam Canfield, a professional thief. Although frustrated by his dishonesty, Reggie still trusts him.

Reggie and Adam go to an outdoor market, the location of Charles&#x27;s last known appointment. Spotting Tex, Adam follows him. At the stamp-selling booths, Adam and Tex each realize that Charles bought some extremely valuable stamps and affixed them to the envelope in his travel bag. Both men race to Reggie&#x27;s hotel room, but discover that the stamps are missing from the envelope. Reggie, who gave the stamps to Sylvie&#x27;s young son Jean-Louis, suddenly realizes their significance. She and Sylvie find Jean-Louis, but he has already traded the stamps to a dealer. They find the dealer, who says that the rare stamps are worth $250,000; he returns them to Reggie.
Reggie returns to the hotel and finds Tex&#x27;s body; Tex managed to write the name &quot;Dyle&quot; on the floor before dying. Convinced that Adam is the murderer, Reggie telephones Hamilton, who says to meet him at the Colonnade at the Palais-Royal. Adam sees her and gives chase. At the Colonnade, Reggie is caught in the open between the two men. Adam claims that Hamilton is Carson Dyle; surviving the German ambush, he became obsessed with revenge and reclaiming the treasure. Reggie runs into an empty theater and hides in the prompt box. Carson is about to shoot her, but Adam activates a trapdoor under him, sending him crashing to the floor far beneath him.

The next day, Reggie and Adam go to the embassy to turn over the stamps, but Adam declines to go in. Inside, Reggie discovers that Adam is Brian Cruikshank, a U.S. Treasury agent responsible for recovering stolen government property. With his true identity now revealed, he proposes marriage to Reggie. She says that she hopes that they have lots of boys so that they can name them all after him.

==Production==

=== Writing and casting ===
When screenwriters Peter Stone and Marc Behm submitted their script &quot;The Unsuspecting Wife&quot; around Hollywood, they were unable to sell it. Stone then turned it into a novel, retitled &quot;Charade&quot;, which found a publisher and was serialized in &quot;Redbook&quot; magazine. The serial caught the attention of the same Hollywood companies that had passed on it earlier. The film rights were quickly sold to producer/director Stanley Donen. Stone then wrote the final shooting script, tailored to Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, with Behm receiving story co-credit.

At the end of the film, Hepburn lists Grant&#x27;s aliases, concluding, &quot;I hope we have a lot of boys and we can name them all after you&quot;. In the Criterion Collection&#x27;s 1999 commentary, Stone laments the fact that the music swells to mask his &quot;best closing line&quot;. Donen tells him that he can say it now and get his own back.

Cary Grant, who turned 59 years during filming, was sensitive about the 25-year age difference between Audrey Hepburn (33 at the time of filming) and himself, and was uncomfortable with their romantic interplay. To address his concerns, the filmmakers agreed to add dialogue that has Grant&#x27;s character comment on his age and Regina being portrayed as the pursuer.

=== Filming ===
Production began in Paris on October 22, 1962. About half the film was shot on location, with interiors being filmed at Studios de Boulogne. The scenes in which Grant and Hepburn first meet were shot in January 1963 in a ski resort in Megève, in the French Alps. Hepburn had just filmed &quot;Paris When It Sizzles&quot; the previous summer in a number of the same locations in Paris, but difficulties with the earlier production caused it to be released four months after &quot;Charade&quot;.

When the film was released at Christmas time 1963, Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s line, &quot;At any moment we could be assassinated&quot;, was overdubbed with, &quot;At any moment we could be eliminated&quot;, due to the recent assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Official video releases of the film have since restored the original dialogue, although some public domain copies of the original release still carry the dubbed line.

==Release==
The film was slated for a Christmas release, but Universal consented to a one-time advance screening at the Palace Theatre in Washington, D.C., which was a benefit to raise money to help low-income children stay in school. Singer Ella Fitzgerald performed and, according to &quot;Jet&quot; magazine, $50,000 was raised (equivalent to almost a half-million dollars in 2023).

== Reception ==

&quot;Charade&quot; received positive reviews from contemporaries, as well as from 21st-century critics. At Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The consensus reads: &quot;A globetrotting caper that prizes its idiosyncratic pieces over the general puzzle, &quot;Charade&quot; is a delightful romp with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s sparkling chemistry at the center of some perfectly orchestrated mayhem.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In a review published on January 6, 1964, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther criticized the film for its &quot;grisly touches&quot; and &quot;gruesome violence&quot;, but also praised it for its screenplay, with its &quot;sudden twists, shocking gags, eccentric arrangements, and occasionally bright and brittle lines&quot;, as well as Donen&#x27;s direction, said to be halfway between the 1930s screwball comedy and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; by Alfred Hitchcock, which also starred Grant.

In a &quot;Time Out&quot; review, the film was rated positively, with the assertion that it is a &quot;mammoth audience teaser [...] Grant imparts his ineffable charm, Kennedy (with metal hand) provides comic brutality, while Hepburn is elegantly fraught&quot;.

While reviewing the Blu-ray version of the film, Chris Cabin of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave the film a three-and-a-half rating out of five, calling it a &quot;high-end, kitschy whodunit&quot; and writing that it is a &quot;riotous and chaotic take on the spy thriller, essentially, but it structurally resembles Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;&quot;, as well as describing it as &quot;some sort of miraculous entertainment&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
==Public-domain status==

The film includes a notice reading &quot;MCMLXIII BY UNIVERSAL PICTURES COMPANY, INC. and STANLEY DONEN FILMS, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED&quot;, but omits the word, &quot;Copyright&quot;, &quot;Copr.&quot; and the symbol &quot;©&quot;. Before 1978, U.S. law required works to include those words and symbols to be copyrighted. Because Universal failed to properly display the copyright notice, the film entered into the public domain in the United States immediately upon its release. As a result, copies from film prints of varying quality have been widely available on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray, in addition to official releases of the film from Universal, as well as The Criterion Collection. The film is also available for free viewing on YouTube and free download at the Internet Archive. However, although the film is in the public domain, the original music remains under copyright if used outside the context of the film.

<doc id="899452" wikidata="Q388738" url="?curid=899452" title="Lanchester's laws">
<text>Lanchester&#x27;s laws are mathematical formulas for calculating the relative strengths of military forces. The Lanchester equations are differential equations describing the time dependence of two armies&#x27; strengths A and B as a function of time, with the function depending only on A and B.

In 1915 and 1916 during World War I, M. Osipov and Frederick Lanchester independently devised a series of differential equations to demonstrate the power relationships between opposing forces. Among these are what is known as &quot;Lanchester&#x27;s linear law&quot; (for ancient combat) and &quot;Lanchester&#x27;s square law&quot; (for modern combat with long-range weapons such as firearms).

As of 2017 modified variations of the Lanchester equations continue to form the basis of analysis in many of the US Army’s combat simulations, and in 2016 a RAND Corporation report examined by these laws the probable outcome in the event of a Russian invasion into the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

== Lanchester&#x27;s linear law ==
For ancient combat, between phalanxes of soldiers with spears for example, one soldier could only ever fight exactly one other soldier at a time. If each soldier kills, and is killed by, exactly one other, then the number of soldiers remaining at the end of the battle is simply the difference between the larger army and the smaller, assuming identical weapons.

The linear law also applies to unaimed fire into an enemy-occupied area. The rate of attrition depends on the density of the available targets in the target area as well as the number of weapons shooting. If two forces, occupying the same land area and using the same weapons, shoot randomly into the same target area, they will both suffer the same rate and number of casualties, until the smaller force is eventually eliminated: the greater probability of any one shot hitting the larger force is balanced by the greater number of shots directed at the smaller force.

== Lanchester&#x27;s square law ==
Lanchester&#x27;s square law is also known as the N-square law.

=== Description ===
With firearms engaging each other directly with aimed shooting from a distance, they can attack multiple targets and can receive fire from multiple directions. The rate of attrition now depends only on the number of weapons shooting. Lanchester determined that the power of such a force is proportional not to the number of units it has, but to the square of the number of units. This is known as Lanchester&#x27;s square law.

More precisely, the law specifies the casualties a shooting force will inflict over a period of time, relative to those inflicted by the opposing force. In its basic form, the law is only useful to predict outcomes and casualties by attrition. It does not apply to whole armies, where tactical deployment means not all troops will be engaged all the time. It only works where each unit (soldier, ship, etc.) can kill only one equivalent unit at a time. For this reason, the law does not apply to machine guns, artillery with unguided munitions, or nuclear weapons. The law requires an assumption that casualties accumulate over time: it does not work in situations in which opposing troops kill each other instantly, either by shooting simultaneously or by one side getting off the first shot and inflicting multiple casualties.

Note that Lanchester&#x27;s square law does not apply to technological force, only numerical force; so it requires an N-squared-fold increase in quality to compensate for an N-fold decrease in quantity.

=== Example equations ===
Suppose that two armies, Red and Blue, are engaging each other in combat. Red is shooting a continuous stream of bullets at Blue. Meanwhile, Blue is shooting a continuous stream of bullets at Red.

Let symbol &quot;A&quot; represent the number of soldiers in the Red force. Each one has &quot;offensive firepower α&quot;, which is the number of enemy soldiers it can incapacitate (e.g., kill or injure) per unit time. Likewise, Blue has &quot;B&quot; soldiers, each with offensive firepower &quot;β&quot;.

Lanchester&#x27;s square law calculates the number of soldiers lost on each side using the following pair of equations. Here, &quot;dA/dt&quot; represents the rate at which the number of Red soldiers is changing at a particular instant. A negative value indicates the loss of soldiers. Similarly, &quot;dB/dt&quot; represents the rate of change of the number of Blue soldiers.

:formula_1
:formula_2

The solution to these equations shows that:

* If &quot;α&quot;=&quot;β&quot;, i.e. the two sides have equal firepower, the side with more soldiers at the beginning of the battle will win;
* If &quot;A&quot;=&quot;B&quot;, i.e. the two sides have equal numbers of soldiers, the side with greater firepower will win;
* If &quot;A&quot;&gt;&quot;B&quot; and &quot;α&quot;&gt;&quot;β&quot;, then Red will win, while if &quot;A&quot;&lt;&quot;B&quot; and &quot;α&quot;&lt;&quot;β&quot;, Blue will win;
* If &quot;A&quot;&gt;&quot;B&quot; but &quot;α&quot;&lt;&quot;β&quot;, or &quot;A&quot;&lt;&quot;B&quot; but &quot;α&quot;&gt;&quot;β&quot;, the winning side will depend on whether the ratio of &quot;β&quot;/&quot;α&quot; is greater or less than the square of the ratio of &quot;A&quot;/&quot;B&quot;. Thus, if numbers and firepower are unequal in opposite directions, a superiority in firepower equal to the square of the inferiority in numbers is required for victory; or, to put it another way, the effectiveness of the army rises proportionate to the square of the number of people in it, but only linearly with their fighting ability.

The first three of these conclusions are obvious. The final one is the origin of the name &quot;square law&quot;.

=== Relation to the salvo combat model ===
Lanchester&#x27;s equations are related to the more recent salvo combat model equations, with two main differences.

First, Lanchester&#x27;s original equations form a continuous time model, whereas the basic salvo equations form a discrete time model. In a gun battle, bullets or shells are typically fired in large quantities. Each round has a relatively low chance of hitting its target, and does a relatively small amount of damage. Therefore, Lanchester&#x27;s equations model gunfire as a stream of firepower that continuously weakens the enemy force over time.

By comparison, cruise missiles typically are fired in relatively small quantities. Each one has a high probability of hitting its target, and carries a relatively powerful warhead. Therefore, it makes more sense to model them as a discrete pulse (or salvo) of firepower in a discrete time model.

Second, Lanchester&#x27;s equations include only offensive firepower, whereas the salvo equations also include defensive firepower. Given their small size and large number, it is not practical to intercept bullets and shells in a gun battle. By comparison, cruise missiles can be intercepted (shot down) by surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns. Therefore, missile combat models include those active defenses.

== Lanchester&#x27;s law in use ==
Lanchester&#x27;s laws have been used to model historical battles for research purposes. Examples include Pickett&#x27;s Charge of Confederate infantry against Union infantry during the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg, the 1940 Battle of Britain between the British and German air forces, and the Battle of Kursk.

In modern warfare, to take into account that to some extent both linear and the square apply often, an exponent of 1.5 is used. Lanchester&#x27;s laws have also been used to model guerrilla warfare. The laws have also been applied to repeat battles with a range of inter-battle reinforcement strategies.

Attempts have been made to apply Lanchester&#x27;s laws to conflicts between animal groups. Examples include tests with chimpanzees and ants. The chimpanzee application was relatively successful. A study of Australian meat ants and Argentine ants confirmed the square law, but a study of fire ants did not confirm the square law.

===Helmbold Parameters===

The Helmbold Parameters offer precise numerical indices, grounded in historical data, for quickly and accurately comparing battles in terms of bitterness and the degree of advantage held by each side. While their definition is modeled after a solution of the Lanchester Square Law&#x27;s differential equations, their numerical values are based entirely on the initial and final strengths of the opponents and in no way depend upon the validity of Lanchester&#x27;s Square Law as a model of attrition during the course of a battle.

The solution of Lanchester&#x27;s Square Law used here can be written as:

formula_3

Where:
* formula_4 is the time since the battle began
* formula_5 and formula_6 are the surviving fractions of the attacker&#x27;s and defender&#x27;s forces at time formula_4
* formula_8 is the Helmbold intensity parameter
* formula_9 is the Helmbold defender&#x27;s advantage parameter
* formula_10 is the duration of the battle
* formula_11 is the Helmbold bitterness parameter.

If the initial and final strengths of the two sides are known it is possible to solve for the parameters formula_12, formula_13, formula_9, and formula_11. If the battle duration formula_10 is also known, then it is possible to solve for formula_8.

If, as is normally the case, formula_11 is small enough that the hyperbolic functions can, without any significant error, be replaced by their series expansion up to terms in the first power of formula_11, and if abbreviations adopted for the casualty fractions are formula_20 and formula_21, then the approximate relations that hold include formula_22 and formula_23. That formula_11 is a kind of &quot;average&quot; (specifically, the geometric mean) of the casualty fractions justifies using it as an index of the bitterness of the battle.

Statistical work prefers natural logarithms of the Helmbold Parameters. They are noted formula_25, formula_26, and formula_27.

==Major findings==

See Helmbold (2021):
# The Helmbold parameters formula_26 and formula_25 are statistically independent, i.e., they measure distinct features of a battle.
#The probability that the defender wins, formula_30, is related to the defender&#x27;s advantage parameter via the logistic function, formula_31, with formula_32. This logistic function is almost exactly skew-symmetric about formula_33, rising from formula_34 at formula_35, through formula_36 at formula_33, to formula_38 at formula_39. Because the probability of victory depends on the Helmbold advantage parameter rather than the force ratio, it is clear that force ratio is an inferior and untrustworthy predictor of victory in battle.
# While the defender&#x27;s advantage varies widely from one battle to the next, on average it has been practically constant since 1600 CE.
# Most of the other battle parameters (specifically the initial force strengths, initial force ratios, casualty numbers, casualty exchange ratios, battle durations, and distances advanced by the attacker) have changed so slowly since 1600 CE that only the most acute observers would be likely to notice any change over their nominal 50-year military career.
# Bitterness (formula_26), casualty fractions (formula_41 and formula_42 in the above notation), and intensity (formula_27) also changed slowly before 1939 CE. But since then they have followed a startlingly steeper declining curve.

Some observers have noticed a similar post-WWII decline in casualties at the level of wars instead of battles.

<text>Roger Fenton (28 March 1819 – 8 August 1869) was a British photographer, noted as one of the first war photographers.

Fenton was born into a Lancashire merchant family. After graduating from London with an arts degree, he became interested in painting. After seeing examples of the new technology of photography at the Great Exhibition in 1851, he became keenly interested in this new technique. Within a year, he began exhibiting his own photographs. 

He became a leading British photographer and was instrumental in founding the Photographic Society (later the Royal Photographic Society). In 1854, he was commissioned to document events occurring in Crimea, where he became one of a small group of photographers to produce images of the final stages of the Crimean War.

==Early life==
Fenton was born in Crimble Hall, Heywood, Lancashire, on 28 March 1819. His grandfather was a wealthy cotton manufacturer and banker, whilst his father, John, was a banker and from 1832 a member of parliament. Fenton was the fourth of seven children by his father&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Apedaile, his first wife. His father remarried after her death and had 10 more children by his second wife. 

In 1840 Fenton graduated with a &quot;first class&quot; Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of London, having read English, mathematics, Greek and Latin. In 1841, he began to read law at University College, London, evidently sporadically as he did not qualify as a solicitor until 1847. He had also become interested in studying painting. In Yorkshire in 1843 Fenton married Grace Elizabeth Maynard, presumably after his first sojourn in Paris (his passport was issued in 1842), where he may briefly have studied painting in the studio of Paul Delaroche. When he registered as a copyist in the Louvre in 1844, he named his teacher as Michel Martin Drolling, a history and portrait painter who taught at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, but Fenton&#x27;s name does not appear in the school records. 

By 1847 Fenton had returned to London, where he continued to study painting under the tutelage of history painter Charles Lucy. They became friends and, starting in 1850, the two men served on the board of the North London School of Drawing and Modelling. In 1849, 1850 and 1851 Fenton exhibited paintings in the annual exhibitions of the Royal Academy.
==Established in London==
Fenton visited the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park in London in 1851 and was impressed by the photography on display there. He visited Paris to learn the waxed paper calotype process, most likely from Gustave Le Gray, who had modified the methods employed by William Henry Fox Talbot, its inventor. By 1852 Fenton had photographs exhibited in Britain. He travelled to photograph Kiev, Moscow and St. Petersburg, and also photographed views and architecture around Britain. 
In 1853 the British Museum commissioned Fenton to record some of its collection of rare historical artefacts. He established an open-air studio on the museum&#x27;s roof. Museum staff manhandled the items into the daylight and dusted them with chalk (to avoid reflections) for his procedures. These were unpaid commissions, but Fenton was allowed to sell the prints on his own account, eventually setting up a shop at the museum entrance.

Queen Victoria commissioned Fenton to produce a series of royal portraits in 1854. As well as formal studio portraits, he made informal &quot;tableaux vivants&quot; of the queen at Balmoral, Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace.
===Royal Photographic Society===

In 1852, in collaboration with commercial photographer Antoine Claudet, Fenton published a manifesto: &quot;Proposal for the Formation of a Photographic Society&quot;. In 1853 he became a founder and first secretary of the London Photographic Society. It later became the Royal Photographic Society under the patronage of Prince Albert. In 1980, the RPS instituted the ‘Fenton Medal’ awarded to three or four members of the RPS each year, to acknowledge those members’ extraordinary service to the Society. 

==Crimean War==

It is likely that in autumn 1854, as the Crimean War grabbed the attention of the British public, that some powerful friends and patrons – among them Prince Albert and Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State for War – urged Fenton to go to the Crimea to record events. The London print publisher Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons became his commercial sponsor. The resulting photographs may have been intended to offset the general unpopularity of the war among the British people, and to counteract the occasionally critical reporting of correspondent William Howard Russell of &quot;The Times&quot;. The photographs were to be converted into woodblocks for printing and published in the less critical &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;. 

Fenton set off aboard HMS &quot;Hecla&quot; in February, landed at Balaklava on 8 March and remained there until 22 June. Fenton took Marcus Sparling as his photographic assistant, a servant known as William, and a large horse-drawn van of equipment.

Due to the size and cumbersome nature of his photographic equipment, Fenton was limited in his choice of motifs. Because the photographic material of his time needed long exposures, he was able to produce only photographs of stationary objects, mostly posed pictures. He avoided taking pictures of dead, injured or mutilated soldiers. His images of people included a woman working as a vivandière. 

Fenton photographed the landscape, including an area near to where the Charge of the Light Brigade took place. This event was made famous by Tennyson in his poem of the same name. Fenton&#x27;s photograph does not show the actual site of the charge, which took place in a long, broad valley several miles to the south-east. In letters home soldiers had called the original valley &quot;The Valley of Death&quot;, and Tennyson&#x27;s poem used the same phrase. 

In September 1855 Thomas Agnew put Fenton&#x27;s photograph on show in London, as one of a series of eleven collectively titled &quot;Panorama of the Plateau of Sebastopol in Eleven Parts&quot;. He titled it as &quot;The Valley of the Shadow of Death&quot;, with a deliberate evocation of Psalm 23.

In 2007 American film-maker Errol Morris went to Sevastopol to identify the site of this &quot;first iconic photograph of war&quot;. He identified the small valley, shown on a later map as &quot;The Valley of the Shadow of Death&quot;, as the place where Fenton had taken his photograph (see right). Fenton had taken two pictures of this area, one with several cannonballs on the road, the other with an empty road. Opinions had differed concerning which one was taken first, but Morris spotted evidence that the photo without the cannonballs was taken first. He remains uncertain about why balls were moved onto the road in the second picture: perhaps, he notes, Fenton deliberately placed them there to enhance the image. The alternative is that soldiers were gathering cannonballs for reuse and they threw down balls from higher up the hill onto the road and ditch for collection later. Art historians, such as Nigel Spivey of Cambridge University, identify the images as from the nearby Woronzoff Road. In June 1855 illustrator and war correspondent William Simpson produced a watercolour of the Woronzoff Road, with a view downhill. It has cannonballs placed similarly to those shown by Fenton; Simpson&#x27;s publisher too used the title &quot;The Valley of the Shadow of Death&quot;. This is the location accepted by the local tour guides.

Despite undergoing summer high temperatures, breaking several ribs in a fall, suffering from cholera (the effects of which contributed to his early death) and becoming depressed at the carnage he witnessed at Sevastopol, in all Fenton managed to make more than 350 usable large-format negatives. An exhibition of 312 prints was soon on show in London, and at various places across the nation in the months that followed. Fenton also showed them to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and to Emperor Napoleon III in Paris. Nevertheless, he was disappointed at sales being less than he expected.

==Post Crimea==
Despite the lack of commercial success for his Crimean photographs, Fenton later travelled widely over Britain to record landscapes and still life images. As time passed, photography became more accessible to the general public. Many people sought to profit from selling quick portraits to common people. It is likely that Fenton, from a wealthy background, disdained &#x27;trade&#x27; photographers, but he still wanted to profit from the art by taking exclusive images and selling them at good prices. This led to conflict with those of his fellow photographers who genuinely needed to make money from photography and were willing to &#x27;cheapen their art&#x27; (as Fenton saw it). He also was in conflict with the Photographic Society, who believed that no photographer should soil himself with the &#x27;sin&#x27; of exploiting his talent commercially in any manner.

Amongst Fenton&#x27;s photographic subjects from this period are the City of Westminster, including The Palace of Westminster nearing completion in 1857. His are almost certainly the earliest images of the building, and the only photographs showing the incomplete Clock Tower.

==Later life==
In 1858 Fenton made studio genre studies based on romantically imaginative ideas of Muslim life, such as &quot;Seated Odalisque&quot;, using friends and models who were not always convincing in their roles. Although he became well known for his Crimean War photography, his photographic career lasted little more than a decade. In 1862 he sold his equipment and abandoned the profession entirely, returning to the practice of law as a barrister. Although almost forgotten by the time of his death seven years later, he was later formally recognised by art historians for his pioneering work and artistic endeavour.

In 1862 the organising committee for the International Exhibition in London announced its plans to place photography, not with the other fine arts as had been done in the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition only five years earlier, but in the section reserved for machinery, tools and instruments; they classified photography as a craft, for tradesmen. For Fenton and many of his colleagues, this was conclusive proof of photography&#x27;s diminished status, and the pioneers drifted away.

Three of Fenton&#x27;s children died in this decade: Josephine (d.1850). Ann (d.1855) and Anthony (d.1861); they are buried on the west side of Highgate Cemetery in a plot adjoining the grave of Christina Rossetti and Elizabeth Siddal. 

Fenton moved with his remaining family from Albert Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park to Potters Bar, Middlesex, perhaps for healthier air. He died there at age 50 on 8 August 1869 after a week-long illness. His wife died in 1886. Their graves in the local churchyard were destroyed in 1969 when the Potters Bar church was deconsecrated and demolished.

In 2005, 90 of Fenton&#x27;s images were included in a special exhibition devoted to this &quot;most important nineteenth-century photographer&quot; at the Tate Britain gallery, London. In 2007, Fenton was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

<doc id="899456" wikidata="Q707755" url="?curid=899456" title="Roger Donaldson">
<text>Roger Lindsey Donaldson (born 15 November 1945) is an Australian and New Zealand film director, screenwriter, and producer. His 1977 debut film, &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;, is considered landmark work of New Zealand cinema, as one of the country’s first films to attract large-scale critical and commercial success. He has subsequently directed 17 feature films, working in Hollywood and the United Kingdom, as well as his native country.

Donaldson’s best-known films include the historical drama &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984), the neo-noir &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1987), the romantic comedy &quot;Cocktail&quot; (1988), the Cuban Missile Crisis docudrama &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; (2000), the science-fiction horror film &quot;Species&quot; (1995), the disaster film &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot; (1997), the Burt Munro biopic &quot;The World&#x27;s Fastest Indian&quot; (2005), and the historical thriller &quot;The Bank Job&quot; (2008). 

Donaldson has worked twice each with actors Kevin Costner, Pierce Brosnan, Anthony Hopkins and Michael Madsen. He is a recipient of three New Zealand Film and Television Awards. He is also an AACTA Award and Palme d’Or nominee. At the 2018 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Donaldson was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to film.

==Life and career==
Donaldson was born in Ballarat, Victoria, where he attended Ballarat High School. In 1965 he emigrated to New Zealand, where he established a small still photography business and began making advertisements. Donaldson was also directing documentaries, including an adventure series featuring Everest-conquering New Zealander, Sir Edmund Hillary, as well as his first ventures into drama. Donaldson and actor/director Ian Mune collaborated on a number of projects for television, including anthology series &quot;Winners and Losers&quot;, based on short stories by New Zealand authors.

In 1976, Donaldson directed and produced his first feature, &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;. The film starred Mune and Sam Neill as two men fighting for their lives in a totalitarian New Zealand. He followed it with &quot;Smash Palace&quot;, starring Bruno Lawrence as a man who kidnaps his daughter after his marriage disintegrates.

Donaldson&#x27;s international break came when producer Dino de Laurentiis invited him to direct an adaptation of &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, after &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; director David Lean left the project. The film, released as &quot;The Bounty&quot;, starred Anthony Hopkins as William Bligh and Mel Gibson as mutineer Fletcher Christian. Donaldson was nominated for a Golden Palm at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival for the film.

Donaldson went on to direct many popular and successful movies. His breakthrough American hit was the thriller &quot;No Way Out&quot;, starring Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman. &quot;Cocktail&quot;, starring Bryan Brown and Tom Cruise, was panned by critics but did very well at the box office, based largely on Cruise&#x27;s starpower. The volcano disaster movie &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot;, starring Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton, helped restore Donaldson&#x27;s status after a string of less successful films. &quot;Thirteen Days&quot;, a political thriller starring Kevin Costner, adapted &quot;The Kennedy Tapes&quot;, a book by Ernest R. May and Philip Zelikow, which was a detailed account of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He also directed science fiction tale &quot;Species&quot;, and in 2003, the Al Pacino and Colin Farrell film &quot;The Recruit&quot;. Donaldson wrote and directed &quot;The World&#x27;s Fastest Indian&quot;, which released in 2005. The film starred Anthony Hopkins and depicted Burt Munro&#x27;s successful attempts at motorcycle speed records at Bonneville Salt Flats in the 1950s.

His son Chris is a sprinter who has represented New Zealand at the Olympic level in 100m and 200m events. His daughter India is also a filmmaker. Her debut feature &quot;Good One&quot; made its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, and also screened at the Cannes Film Festival.

In the 2018 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Donaldson was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to film.

<text>Theodore J. Kooser (born April 25, 1939) is an American poet. He won the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry in 2005. He served as Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress from 2004 to 2006. Kooser was one of the first poets laureate selected from the Great Plains, and is known for his conversational style of poetry.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ted Kooser was born in Ames, Iowa, on April 25, 1939. Growing up, Kooser attended Ames Public Schools for elementary and middle school. When Kooser arrived at Ames High School, his interest diverted from the library, and it went to cars. He joined the Nightcrawlers Car Club and became secretary of the group in 1956. His motivation for writing in high school can be in part credited to one of his teachers, Mary McNally, who encouraged him to continue writing essays and poems that reflected his life.

=== Education ===
Kooser graduated from Ames High School with a class of 175 students and enrolled at Iowa State University, the alma mater of his uncles. He began writing short nonfiction stories for the Iowa State student literary magazine. He also joined the Iowa State Writer’s Round Table, which he credits for fine-tuning his writing skills; Iowa Senator Tom Harkin was also a part of the group. In 1961, Kooser moved to Marshalltown, Iowa, to student teach English classes. The following year he graduated with a BS in English education from Iowa State University and moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to live with his parents. He was offered a graduate readership opportunity at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and in 1963, he and his wife moved to Lincoln, Nebraska. After winning the Vreeland Award for poetry in 1964, he soon after lost his graduate readership from the University for his poor GPA. In 1967, he received his MA from Nebraska.

===Career===
After earning his MA, Kooser worked at Bankers Life Nebraska. He eventually went on to work for Lincoln Benefit Life (a subsidiary of Allstate), an insurance company, for 35 years before retiring as vice president at the age of 60. He wrote for an hour and a half before work every morning, and by the time he retired, Kooser had published seven books of poetry. Kooser taught as a Presidential Professor in the English department of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and is currently a Professor Emeritus.

On August 12, 2004, he was named Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry by the Librarian of Congress to serve a term from October 2004 through May 2005. 

In April 2005, Theodore J. Kooser was appointed to serve a second term as Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry. During that same week, Kooser received the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his book &quot;Delights &amp; Shadows&quot; (Copper Canyon Press, 2004). Edward Hirsch wrote: &quot;There is a sense of quiet amazement at the core of all Kooser’s work, but it especially seems to animate his new collection of poems, &quot;Delights &amp; Shadows&quot;.&quot;

Kooser&#x27;s most recent books are &quot;Kindest Regards: New and Selected Poems&quot; and &quot;Red Stilts&quot; (2020).

He founded and hosted the newspaper project &quot;American Life in Poetry&quot;. In 2020, Kooser chose Kwame Dawes, a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, to be his successor as of January 1, 2021. Kooser also edits the Ted Kooser Contemporary Poetry series published by the University of Nebraska Press.

=== Midwest Poetry Renaissance ===
Ted Kooser was part of the Midwest Poetry Renaissance in the 1960s and 1970s. The Midwest Poetry Renaissance drew on elements of Rural America through a five-state swath of the Great Plains region. Poets of the Midwest were respected among artists throughout the country due to being informed of larger societal forces, such as the distrust of a media-driven culture.

More small presses opened up in that time, and Midwestern poets began publishing more work. Warren Woessner regards the catalyst of the MPR to be the anthology Heartland in 1967. The movement began to develop after that point, along with the works of Ted and other poets such as Victor Contoski, Mak Vinz, David Steinglass, Gary Gildner, James Hazard, Greg Kuzma, Judith Minty, and Kathy Weigner (as well as many others) who exemplified the rural subject matter and conversational tone. Most of the poets were in their twenties or early thirties and published their first books.

Ted was in his late twenties and thirties during the decade the Midwest Poetry Renaissance occurred. He published his first book through the University of Nebraska Press at age 30, titled “Official Entry Blank.” Ted’s first full-length book was already out of print by the early 1970s, at which time he became more of a small press poet like many other poets in the Midwest. Ted continued to receive publication of individual poems within anthologies and published several more books in small presses. He also began to edit &quot;The New Salt Creek Reader&quot;, which had six anthologies by 1974.

According to Warren Woessner, a poet during the Midwest Poetry Renaissance, the movement ended in 1975 with the publication of Heartland II.

=== Poetic Style ===
Ted Kooser is known for his conversational style of poetry that is accessible to a nonliterary public. Critic Dana Gioia, in his book &quot;Can Poetry Matter?&quot;, describes Kooser’s style as &quot;drawn from common speech, with subject matter common to the Midwest.&quot; Kooser&#x27;s early and contemporary work involves both troubles for Midwesterners, and observations from everyday life. Recurring themes include love, family, place, and time, but he does not consider himself a regional poet.

== Personal life ==
Kooser lives on an acreage near the village of Garland, Nebraska. Kooser has served on the Lincoln Library Board. He was founding president of The Nebraska Literary Heritage Association.

Kooser is married to Kathleen Rutledge, former editor of the &quot;Lincoln Journal Star&quot;. They have one son and two grandchildren.

<doc id="899464" wikidata="Q3294620" url="?curid=899464" title="Leslie Stevens">
<text>Leslie Clark Stevens IV (February 3, 1924 – April 24, 1998) was an American producer, writer, and director. He created two television series for the ABC network, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; (1963–1965) and &quot;Stoney Burke&quot; (1962–63), and &quot;Search&quot; (1972–73) for NBC. Stevens was the director of the horror film &quot;Incubus&quot; (1966), which stars William Shatner, and was the second film to use the Esperanto language. He wrote an early work of New Age philosophy, &quot;&quot; (1970).

==Biography==
Stevens was born in Washington, D.C. His interest in science was sparked when he studied for the United States Naval Academy at the behest of his father, Leslie Clark Stevens III, an admiral in the United States Navy. But the Broadway theater intrigued him more than a military career, and he headed for New York as a fledgling writer.
He sold his play &quot;The Mechanical Rat&quot;, to Orson Welles&#x27;s Mercury Theatre and ran away from home to join the troupe before being returned home by truant officers.

During World War II, he repudiated family tradition by serving in the United States Army Air Forces, becoming a captain at the age of 20. He attended Yale&#x27;s Drama Department following the war.

His first play &quot;Bullfight&quot; starring Hurd Hatfield opened off Broadway in 1954. It was followed by &quot;The Champagne Complex&quot; the following year. His play &quot;The Lovers&quot; (1956), starring Joanne Woodward, was later filmed as &quot;The War Lord&quot; (1965). He wrote the Broadway comedy &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot; (1956), which he adapted to the screen, and produced, as a starring vehicle for Susan Hayward, which was released in 1961. He wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;The Left Handed Gun&quot; (1958) directed by Arthur Penn and starring Paul Newman. Other films which Stevens produced, and directed and wrote included &quot;Hero&#x27;s Island&quot; (1962) starring James Mason, and &quot;Private Property&quot; (1960) starring Corey Allen, Warren Oates and his then-wife Kate Manx. He also directed the feature film &quot;Incubus&quot; (1966), which was filmed entirely in the constructed language Esperanto.

Through Daystar Productions, Stevens created the television series &quot;Stoney Burke&quot;, followed by &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; which he supervised as executive producer and wrote or directed a handful of episodes, including the pilot &quot;The Galaxy Being&quot; in which Stevens supplied the voice of the extraterrestrial. His longest-lasting relationship was film composer Dominic Frontiere, who served many years working with Daystar Productions as production executive.

Stevens was writer, director and executive producer of the pilot film and major episodes of &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; and &quot;McCloud &quot;and wrote and produced installments for the series &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; and &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; (which he co-developed with Glen A. Larson). He also produced the first-season Tony Franciosa episodes of &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; and the short-lived 1972–73 NBC science fiction series &quot;Search&quot;. Although only credited as supervising producer of &quot;Saga of a Star-World&quot; (the 1978 pilot episode of the Larson-produced &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;), director Alan J. Levi has alleged that &quot;Stevens wrote the original script. Leslie was one of my best friends. I do know that Leslie had told me at one time way before he ever got into the script that he had this great idea for a script that he was going to take to Glen Larson and talk about.&quot;

Stevens coined the term &quot;bottle show&quot; for an episode made in very little time at very little cost, &quot;as in pulling an episode right out of a bottle like a genie&quot;.

Stevens also wrote for the revival show of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; between 1996 and 1997.

Stevens&#x27;s contributions to the New Age Movement, and its relationships to &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; are discussed in the book &quot;Taoism for Dummies &quot;(John Wiley and Sons Canada, 2013).

Stevens died from complications of an emergency angioplasty in 1998 in Los Angeles, California at the age of 74.

<doc id="899469" wikidata="Q1172504" url="?curid=899469" title="Battle of Château-Thierry (1918)">
<text>The Battle of Château-Thierry was fought on July 1, 1918 and was one of the first actions of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) under General John J. Pershing. It was a battle in World War I as part of the Second Battle of the Marne, initially prompted by a German Spring Offensive. German and local actions at Château-Thierry recommenced on May 31 to July 22, 1918, against the AEF, an American Expeditionary Force, consisting of troops from both the United States Army and Marine Corps units. These units from the 2nd US Division were the newest troops on the front in France and just barely out of training.

The AEF counter-offensive combat action at Château-Thierry was relatively brief starting on July 1, 1918 and lasting for less than a week and was part of the allied effort to push back the recent German advance. American forces had linked up with their French allies at the Marne River on June 3, 1918 and had forced the Germans back across the river. This set the stage for the action at Château-Thierry and at the Battle of Belleau Wood. However, the later action raged for another three weeks.

== Background ==
Despite the revolution in Russia, fortune seemed to favor the Allies with the arrival of the Americans in France. However, these troops needed time to train before they could be combat effective. Recognizing the window of opportunity, General Ludendorff consolidated the manpower freed up from the Eastern Front to conduct Operation Michael in order to split the Allies&#x27; lines. The successes of the German stormtrooper infiltration tactics earned Germany approximately 40 miles of territory. But the offensive lost momentum when it surpassed its supply lines.

From the arrival of the first American troops in France, General John Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force, had refused to hand over his divisions to either British or French commanders, insisting on keeping them together as one army. Regular Army Buffalo Soldiers, African American (&quot;colored&quot;) troops led by mainly white officers, of the four regiments of the 92nd and the 93rd infantry divisions, fought only under French command for the duration of the war, although experienced Black non-commissioned officers(NCOs) were often provided to other segregated volunteer units under American command – such as the 317th Engineer Battalion. 

Although he was determined to keep American troops under American command, in the face of the success of the German onslaught, Pershing relented and sent a portion of his army to assist the French in blocking the German advance in May 1918.

== Prelude ==

Looking to expel British forces from Flanders, Ludendorff sought to divert the Allies&#x27; French reserves away from the region. In his Operation Blucher, Ludendorff aimed some of his forces at the Chemin des Dames and took the French Sixth Army by surprise. Driving on, the Germans were soon at the Marne River, situated under 50 miles from Paris. With Marshal Ferdinand Foch unable to acquire British assistance, General Pershing&#x27;s chief of operation, Colonel Fox Conner, recognized the gravity of the situation and ordered the 3rd Division to block them.

The 3rd Division occupied the main bridge on the south bank of the Marne River that led in Château-Thierry on 31 May 1918 as the French 10th Colonial Division rendezvoused with them from the north bank. The Americans positioned their machine guns to cover the French retreat, and had a unit led by Lt. John Bissell situated north of the second bridge. The French spent the night adding explosives to the bridges to destroy them. Early the following morning, 1 June, the Germans advanced into Château-Thierry from the north, forcing the French to the main bridge, which they defended with the support of American machine-gun fire. The French succeeded in destroying the bridge as the Americans kept up their fire on the Germans.
Lt. Bissell&#x27;s group was still on the north side of the Marne. They worked their way back to the secondary bridge in-between American machine-gun fire and made it across, along with a group of Germans that were captured shortly afterwards.
From the north of the Marne on 2 June, the Germans engaged in heavy artillery and sniper fire against the Allies. They made an attempt to take the remaining bridge but were forced to end the assault as the casualties rose.

==Counter-Offensive action==
On the morning of 1 July 1918, the combined French and American forces, under the overall direction of Allied Generalissimo Ferdinand Foch, launched a general counter-assault on a wide front between Fontenoy and Château-Thierry, the first Allied offensive in the area in over a year. The American army played a role fighting for the regions around Soissons and Château-Thierry, in collaboration with predominantly French forces. The 3rd Brigade of the 2nd US Division led the attack on the strategic town of Vaux. The Allies had managed to keep their plans a secret, and their attack took the Germans by surprise. The troops went &quot;Over the Top&quot; without a preparatory artillery bombardment, but instead followed closely behind a synchronized rolling barrage. The assaults penetrated German lines and individual American units exercised initiative and continued fighting despite being nominally behind enemy lines. The town of Vaux was in American hands by the end of the day. 

==Memorials==

After World War I, a memorial was built on Hill 204, 2 miles (3 km.) west of the town for which it is named. The Château-Thierry Monument, designed by Paul P. Cret of Philadelphia, was constructed by the American Battle Monuments Commission &quot;to commemorate the sacrifices and achievements of American and French fighting men in the region, and the friendship and cooperation of French and American forces during World War I.&quot;

There is also a monument in front of the Bronx County Courthouse in New York City that was presented by the American Legion on 11 November 1940. The monument consists of the &quot;Keystone from an arch of the old bridge at Château-Thierry,&quot; which the monument notes was &quot;Gloriously and successfully defended by American troops.&quot;

The first Filipino to die in World War I was Private Tomas Mateo Claudio who served with the U.S. Army as part of the American Expeditionary Forces to Europe. He died in the Battle of Chateau Thierry in France on 29 June 1918. The Tomas Claudio Memorial College in Morong Rizal, Philippines, which was founded in 1950, was named in his honor.

==In Literature==
Walter Charles Robert&#x27;s 1937 play &quot;Red Harvest&quot; is set at American Red Cross Hospital 111, a field hospital in Jouy-sur-Morin, during the Battle of Château-Thierry. Based on the diary of an American Red Cross nurse at the battle, the hospital staff experiences air raids and shell fire while attempting to the save the lives of wounded soldiers, many of them difficult surgical cases.

A chapter in Ken Follett&#x27;s 2010 historical novel &quot;Fall of Giants&quot; is devoted to The Battle of Château-Thierry, depicted alternately from the point of view of a German character and an American one. Follett&#x27;s account emphasizes the fact that the Americans were freshly arrived and for most of them this was the first experience of combat - yet they stood well the &quot;baptism of fire&quot; and were able to confront the far more experienced German troops.

<doc id="899470" wikidata="Q8018391" url="?curid=899470" title="William Shew">
<text>William Shew (1820–1903) was a prominent American photographer in the 19th century. He made a name for himself as a Daguerrotype portrait artist in the United States. He maintained a mobile studio in a wagon that he called his &quot;Daguerrotype Saloon.&quot;

Shew was born near Watertown, New York on 23 March 1820. He studied daguerrotype photography with Samuel F. B. Morse, as did his brothers Truman, Jacob, and Myron. All four of the Shew brothers worked for photographer John Plumbe, who opened studios in various cities; William Shew worked in Plumbe&#x27;s Boston studio from 1841 to 1844 before setting up his own daguerreian case manufacturing business, William Shew and Company, and pursuing studio work in partnership with daguerreotypist Marsena Cannon. In this period, Shew was a member of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society.
In 1851, Shew followed his brother Jacob to California and set up a studio in San Francisco; he became well known for his portrait work. He was recruited by John Wesley Jones to take daguerreotypes of California for Jones&#x27;s planned &quot;Great Pantoscope of California, the Rocky Mountains, Salt Lake City, Nebraska and Kansas.&quot; In 1851, he set up the &quot;Moveable Daguerreotype Saloon&quot; on Dupont Street, later moving it to a lot on Washington Street, opposite the &quot;Alta California&quot; newspaper office. He later occupied studios in more orthodox addresses along Clay, Montgomery, and Kearny streets. He is presumed the author of a July 1854 article &quot;Photography&quot; in &quot;The Pioneer, or, California Monthly Magazine&quot; in which he commented on the current state of photographic art and daguerreotype studios.

When Japan&#x27;s first diplomatic mission to the United States arrived in San Francisco in 1860, a young Yukichi Fukuzawa, then part of the embassy staff, sat for a photo in Shew&#x27;s studio, in what would become one of the most famous photographs in early Japanese history as it also featured Shew&#x27;s daughter Theodora, one of the first photographs of a Caucasian woman seen in Japan.

Shew was active in local political and social groups in the 1850s and 1860s, holding the first San Francisco Free-Soil Convention at his rooms on the Plaza (8 October 1852); he served briefly on the Board of Education and hosted meetings of the Temperance Society. He was the most successful of the Shew brothers in photography; Truman died young (1848), Jacob suffered financial losses and committed suicide in 1879, and Myron worked in a variety of jobs including photography, manufacturing, and merchandising.

Shew was married twice. In 1847 he married Elizabeth Marie Studley (1819-1889) in Boston; their daughter Theodora Alice was born in 1848. After Elizabeth&#x27;s death from typhoid in 1889, Shew and Annie Katherine Haven (1849-1930) were married in San Francisco in 1891. Shew died in San Francisco on 5 February 1903.

<doc id="899472" wikidata="Q279574" url="?curid=899472" title="Piano Sonata No. 5 (Scriabin)">
<text>The Piano Sonata No. 5, Op. 53, is a work written by Alexander Scriabin in 1907. This was his first sonata to be written in one movement, a format he retained from then on. A typical performance lasts from 11 to 12 minutes. The work is considered to be one of Scriabin&#x27;s most difficult compositions, both technically and musically.

==Composition==

After finishing his symphonic poem &quot;Le Poème de l&#x27;Extase&quot;, Op.54, Scriabin did not feel comfortable living in Paris. In early September 1907 he wrote: 
Life is fearfully expensive, and the climate is rotten. The air in the areas where we could find an apartment big enough for us at a reasonable price is frightful ... you cannot make any noise. You have to wear house slippers after 10 at night.

Scriabin decided to go to live in Lausanne with his pregnant wife Tatyana, since he found the place to be cheaper, quieter, and healthier, and only 7 hours away from Paris. Also, he had his music being printed there, as he had recently broken his long-term partnership with publisher M.P. Belaieff due to financial discrepancies.

In his new peaceful household in &quot;Edifice C Place de la Harpe&quot;, Scriabin could play the piano without fear of complaints from neighbours, and soon began to compose again, alongside the revisions he was making to the score of &quot;Le Poème&quot;. On 8 December, Tatyana wrote to a friend:

We go out a little, having caught up on our sleep. We begin to look normal again. Sasha even has begun to compose – 5th Sonata!!! I cannot believe my ears. It is incredible! That sonata pours from him like a fountain. Everything you have heard up to now is as nothing. You cannot even tell it is a sonata. Nothing compares to it. He has played it through several times, and all he has to do is to write it down ...

In late December, Scriabin wrote to Morozova about the imminent completion of his new work:
The Poem of Ecstasy took much of my strength and taxed my patience. ... Today I have almost finished my 5th Sonata. It is a big poem for piano and I deem it the best composition I have ever written. I do not know by what miracle I accomplished it ...

Although the actual writing took only six days, from 8 to 14 December 1907, some ideas had been conceived much earlier. The initial nine bars of the first theme of the exposition, &quot;Presto con allegrezza&quot; (mm. 47 ff.), can be found in a notebook from 1905 to 1906, when Scriabin was in Chicago. Another notebook from 1906 contains the &quot;Imperioso&quot; theme (mm. 96 ff.), while elements from the &quot;Meno vivo&quot; (mm. 120 ff.) can also be made out, as well as sketched-out passages for a few other sections.

Scriabin included an epigraph to this piano sonata, extracted from his essay &quot;Le Poème de l&#x27;Extase&quot;:
&lt;poem lang=&quot;ru&quot; style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;Original Russian text
Я к жизни призываю вас, скрытые стремленья!
Вы, утонувшие в темных глубинах
Духа творящего, вы, боязливые
Жизни зародыши, вам дерзновенье приношу!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem lang=&quot;fr&quot; style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;Original French translation
Je vous appelle à la vie, ô forces mysterieuses!
Noyées dans les obscures profondeurs
De l&#x27;esprit créateur, craintives
Ebauches de vie, à vous j&#x27;apporte l&#x27;audace!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;English translation
I call you to life, O mysterious forces!&quot;
Drowned in the obscure depths&quot;
Of the creative spirit, timid&quot;
Shadows of life, to you I bring audacity!&lt;/poem&gt;

Five months after its completion, Scriabin published the work himself in Lausanne, producing an edition with 300 copies. He later gave the autograph as a present to his pupil Alfred La Liberté. In 1971 the pianist&#x27;s widow gave the manuscript, along with various other documents, to the Scriabin Museum.

The work was premiered on 18 November 1908 in Moscow by pianist Mark Meitschik.

==Structure==
The piece is written in sonata form with an introduction. The structure of the work is described in the table below:

==Harmonic language==

According to Samson, unlike his later sonatas, the sonata-form of this work still has some meaning to the work&#x27;s tonal structure. That means the sonata is arguably in F-sharp major (owing to the initial key signature of six sharps), but the sonata could also be said to be atonal due to its lack of a definite tonal center.

The work does not contain any perfect cadence, nor any consonant chord.

The work features one of the strange occurrences of the complete mystic chord spelled in fourths (mm. 264 and 268). Jim Samson points out that it fits in well with Scriabin&#x27;s predominantly dominant quality sonorities and harmony as it may take on a dominant quality on C or F. This tritone relationship between possible resolutions is important to Scriabin&#x27;s harmonic language, and it is a property shared by the French sixth (also prominent in his work).

The piece also contains an incipient instance of the mystic chord which helps illuminate its origins in tonal language; first appearing at m. 122, the set [0 2 4 6 T] is presented as a dominant chord with its flat fifth in the bass, later revealed to be an extended appoggiatura to the tonic (m. 134), over which the same notes form a major 13th chord in root position. Compare this presentation with the &#x27;mature&#x27; mystic chord, [0 1 3 5 7 9].

==Recordings==
This is Scriabin&#x27;s most recorded sonata. Pianist Sviatoslav Richter described it as the most difficult piece in the entire piano repertory.

Notable recordings include those by Alexei Sultanov, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Vladimir Horowitz, Sviatoslav Richter, Vladimir Sofronitsky, Michael Ponti, Samuil Feinberg, Glenn Gould, Garrick Ohlsson, Marc-André Hamelin, Bernd Glemser, Maria Lettberg, Igor Zhukov and Pietro Scarpini.

<text>The acre-foot is a non-SI unit of volume equal to about commonly used in the United States in reference to large-scale water resources, such as reservoirs, aqueducts, canals, sewer flow capacity, irrigation water, and river flows.

An acre-foot equals approximately an eight-lane swimming pool, long, wide and deep.

==Definitions==
As the name suggests, an acre-foot is defined as the volume of one acre of surface area to a depth of one foot.

Since an acre is defined as a chain by a furlong (i.e. ), an acre-foot is .

There has been two definitions of the acre-foot (differing by about 0.0006%), using either the international foot (0.3048 m) or a U.S. survey foot (exactly meters since 1893). On December 31, 2022, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Geodetic Survey, and the United States Department of Commerce deprecated use of the US survey foot and recommended conversion to either the meter or the international foot.

==Application==
As a rule of thumb in US water management, one acre-foot is taken to be the planned annual water usage of a suburban family household. In some areas of the desert Southwest, where water conservation is followed and often enforced, a typical family uses only about of water per year. One acre-foot/year is approximately .

The acre-foot per year has been used historically in the US in many water-management agreements, for example the Colorado River Compact, which divides among seven western US states.

Water reservoir capacities in the US are commonly given in thousands of acre-feet, abbreviated TAF or KAF.

In most other countries except the US, the metric system is in common use and water volumes are normally expressed in liter, cubic meter or cubic kilometer. One acre-foot is approximately equivalent to 1.233 megaliters. Large bodies of water may be measured in cubic kilometers (1,000,000,000 m, or 1000 gigaliter), with 1 million acre-feet approximately equalling 1.233 km.

<doc id="899479" wikidata="Q129705" url="?curid=899479" title="Mount Timpanogos">
<text>Mount Timpanogos, often referred to as Timp, is the second-highest mountain in Utah&#x27;s Wasatch Range. Timpanogos rises to an elevation of above sea level in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. With of topographic prominence, Timpanogos is the 47th-most prominent mountain in the contiguous United States.

The mountain towers about over Utah Valley, including the cities of Lehi, Provo, Orem, Pleasant Grove, American Fork, Lindon and others. The exposed massif of the mountain is made up entirely of limestone and dolomite from the Pennsylvanian period, and is about 300 million years old. Heavy winter snowfall is characteristic of this portion of the Wasatch Range, and avalanche activity is common in winter and spring. The mountain is also home to Timpanogos Cave National Monument, a series of decorated caves in the north end of the mountain that have guided ranger tours open daily to the public during the warmer months.

== Etymology ==

The word Timpanogos comes from the Timpanogos tribe who lived in the surrounding valleys from AD 1400. The name translates as &quot;rock&quot; (&quot;tumpi-&quot;), and &quot;water mouth&quot; or &quot;canyon&quot; (&quot;panogos&quot;).

== Glacial activity ==

Mount Timpanogos displays many examples of various glacial processes and the sculpting power of moving ice. Ice Age glaciers mantled the peak until relatively recently and dramatically shaped the mountain into an Alpine tableau of knife-edge ridges and yawning, U-shaped amphitheaters. A remnant of these glaciers persists in the deeply recessed hanging valley below the main summit. Timpanogos Glacier is a rock-covered mass found on a long, north-facing slope and usually has patches of snow the entire year. Although an above-ground cirque glacier was present before the Dust Bowl Drought of the 1930s, no glacial ice is visible today. However, in 1994, a large crevasse opened up, revealing that there still is a glacier buried beneath the talus. Flowing water can occasionally be heard beneath the rocks. Emerald Lake, a small proglacial lake at the bottom of the cirque, often exhibits a blue color, indicating that the glacier is probably still moving, although perhaps too slowly to be noticeable. The locally unique ice is a relic of the region&#x27;s formerly colder climate and has long been a major attraction to hikers and climbers on the mountain, who often slide down its permanent snowfield as a shorter descent route. Its precise classification remains the subject of ongoing debate, whether &quot;real&quot; or not.

==Hiking==

Mount Timpanogos is one of Utah&#x27;s most popular hiking/climbing destinations and is climbed year-round. Winter climbing requires advanced mountaineering ability. In spring, undercutting of deeply drifted snow by streams creates a hazard that has proven fatal on several occasions. Climbers can fall through the undermined snow or more into the icy stream underneath.
Although it is a round-trip hike, with almost of elevation gain, Timpangos&#x27;s summit is one of the most frequently visited in the Rocky Mountains. There are two main trails to the top: the first starts at Aspen Grove with a trailhead elevation of , and the second starts at the Timpooneke campground in American Fork Canyon at . The two trails are nearly the same length. Hikers on the trails climb through montane forest, subalpine and alpine zones. The hike is marked by waterfalls, conifers, rocky slopes and ridges, mountain goats, and a small lake, Emerald Lake, at . A short diversion will lead hikers past the remains of a North American B-25 Mitchell which crashed on the mountain in 1955 due to poor visibility during a flight from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, and Hill Air Force Base in Utah. All five crew members died. Other climbing routes exist on the mountain, but they are more technically demanding and require special skills and mountaineering gear.
 
Prior to 1970, an annual Provo event called the &quot;Timp Hike&quot; sent thousands of people up the mountain&#x27;s slopes. From 1911 to 1970 this one-day event (which took place generally on the third or fourth weekend in July) attracted thousands of people to the mountain. It also created the need for infrastructure, such as the stone shelter built in 1959 near Emerald Lake and a smaller metal shack on the summit (this was used as an observation deck complete with brass rods etched with notches aligned with various landmarks). The hike caused environmental damage to the mountain, and was finally canceled to help preserve the delicate mountain ecosystem. Despite the presence of the existing structures, the mountain was designated a wilderness area by the U.S. Congress in 1984.
== Geology ==

The rock which forms the visible surface of Mount Timpanogos is primarily limestone, composed of compacted sediment laid down onto an ancient seafloor over millions of years during the late Carboniferous Period (roughly 300 million years ago). Older rock exists beneath the limestone on the surface. The limestone was subsequently lifted high above sea level and the mountain itself became prominent as the Western valley sank due to basin and range faulting. The most contemporary features of the mountain were formed through recent glacial and water erosion.
== Climate ==
== Hazards ==
Since 1982 the Timpanogos Emergency Response Team (&quot;TERT&quot;) has been established on the mountain on weekends to provide first aid, rescue and communication.

The Timpanogos Glacier is one of the major sources of injury or death to hikers on Timpanogos, particularly when some attempt to &quot;glissade&quot; (or slide rapidly) down the snowfield&#x27;s surface with the assistance of a shovel or other device to save time descending. There have been many cases of injuries from buried rocks under the snow as well. There have been numerous life flight rescues on the mountain, often caused by this activity. The frequency of these rescues, however, greatly diminished once TERT was established.

==Folklore==
In the early 1900s Eugene Lusk &quot;Timp&quot; Roberts, a professor at Brigham Young University, initiated an annual hike and pageant intended to &quot;sell Timpanogos to the world.&quot; One way was to craft his take on native people&#x27;s folklore. Some observers believe the ridgeline of Mount Timpanogos superficially resembles a sleeping woman. Roberts wrote his folk tale of the maiden Utahna and her sacrifice to her gods with this as the launch point, with one version the basis for a ballet.

<text>The &quot;A&quot; Device is a miniature bronze inch letter &quot;A&quot; which comes with and without serifs, that is authorized for wear by the United States Armed Forces as a medal and ribbon device for two military awards. It is added to overseas service ribbons to indicate the theatre of action.

The Arctic &quot;A&quot; Device (with serifs), if authorized, may be attached to the center of the Air Force Overseas Ribbon - Short Tour, for service beginning February 10, 2002. If an oak leaf cluster is also authorized for wear on the ribbon, the &quot;A&quot; device is worn to the wearer&#x27;s right of any oak leaf clusters on the ribbon.

The Atlantic &quot;A&quot; Device (without serifs), if authorized, may be attached to the center of the suspension and service ribbon of the American Defense Service Medal for service from June 22 to December 7, 1941. The &quot;A&quot; device is worn in lieu of any authorized inch bronze star that is worn on the medal and service ribbon.

== History ==

The &quot;A&quot; Device is only authorized for the currently in use Air Force Overseas Ribbon - Short Tour, and the American Defense Service Medal which is no longer in use. The two representations of the &quot;A&quot; device are different. The Arctic Device has serifs while the Atlantic Device (&quot;Axis Device&quot;) does not have &quot;feet&quot; (sans-serif).

=== Atlantic Device (World War II) ===
The American Defense Service Medal was the first military award to use the &quot;A&quot; device which was named the &quot;Atlantic Device&quot; (sometimes was referred to as the &quot;Axis Device&quot;). The &quot;A&quot; device was authorized for wear (in lieu of a inch bronze star that was worn in lieu of a service clasp on the award) on the medal and service ribbon by any member of the United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, or United States Coast Guard who served on certain vessels in the Atlantic Ocean between June 22 and December 7, 1941 which engaged in armed conflict, or potential armed conflict, with Axis forces in the Atlantic (naval forces of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Kriegsmarine). Such personnel were awarded the American Defense Service Medal with the &quot;Atlantic Device&quot; (Atlantic Fleet service), the intent being to recognize those who had participated in the &quot;undeclared war&quot; when the U.S. was assisting Britain with war convoys and German U-boat interdiction.

=== Arctic Device (USAF) ===

The &quot;A&quot; device became obsolete after the Second World War and did not appear again until the year 2002 (authorized on February 10, 2002). At that time, the United States Air Force declared that the &quot;A&quot; device, now known as the &quot;Arctic Device&quot;, would be authorized for wear for those who had received the Air Force Overseas Ribbon - Short Tour, for tours of duty north of the Arctic Circle.

As of February 8, 2007, only those airmen and guardians who were assigned to Pituffik Space Base (north-west Greenland) qualify for the &quot;A&quot; (Arctic) device. Although portions of Alaska are within the Arctic Circle, there are no American military bases within that region. The &quot;A&quot; is worn on the center of the ribbon except when worn with oak leaf clusters. Whenever oak leaf clusters are authorized for wear on the ribbon, the &quot;A&quot; is placed to the wearer&#x27;s right of the oak leaf clusters on the ribbon. Only one &quot;A&quot; device may be worn on the ribbon.

<doc id="899481" wikidata="Q6811204" url="?curid=899481" title="Melancthon Taylor Woolsey">
<text>Melancthon Taylor Woolsey (1782 – 18 May 1838) was an officer in the United States Navy during the War of 1812 and battles on the Great Lakes. He supervised warship construction at Navy Point in Sackets Harbor, New York, and later had a full career in the Navy.

==Early life==
Woolsey was born near Plattsburgh, New York. He was a son of Melancthon Lloyd Woolsey (1758–1819), a Maj.-Gen. of the New York Militia during the Revolutionary War and Alida ( Livingston) Woolsey (1758–1843), a daughter of the Rev. Henry Gilbert Livingston (a grandson of Robert Livingston, 1st Lord of Livingston Manor).

His paternal grandparents were Col. Melancthon Taylor Woolsey and Rebecca Lloyd. Through his father he was a descendant of George Jarvis Woolsey, an emigrant from England who was one of the earliest settlers of New Amsterdam and married Rebecca Cornell (a daughter of Thomas Cornell), Through his mother, he was a descendant of the Livingston, Schuyler, and Van Rensselaer families.

==Career==
After studying law for a time, Woolsey entered the Navy as a midshipman on April 9, 1800. His first assignment was the frigate , on which he made a cruise to the West Indies in 1800 and 1801. He served briefly in the First Barbary War just before its end in 1805. In 1807, the newly promoted Woolsey received orders to Washington, D.C., where he developed a code of signals for the Navy.

From there, he was ordered to the shores of Lake Ontario in 1808 to supervise the construction of . Given the increase of tensions with Britain, the US Navy established a shipyard for warships and rapidly built eleven ships at the facility, employing 3,000 men at the yard, many recruited from New York City. At the same time, Woolsey received a concurrent assignment as the commanding officer of the shore facilities located there. When the United States declared war on Britain in 1812, he was still in command of &quot;Oneida&quot; and the shore station at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor. On July 19, 1812, a British squadron of five ships appeared. Woolsey attempted to escape to open water with &quot;Oneida&quot;, but the British squadron sealed off that avenue. Instead, he returned to Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, landed half his battery, and after a sharp two-hour exchange the British squadron broke off the engagement and sailed for Kingston.

Early in October, Commodore Isaac Chauncey arrived on the scene and assumed overall command of American naval activities on the Great Lakes. Woolsey stayed on as second in command and remained commanding officer of &quot;Oneida&quot;. During the fall of 1812, Woolsey concentrated upon the construction, purchase, and outfitting of additional war vessels. Throughout the entire war, a construction race caused naval dominance on Lake Ontario to alternate between the British and Americans. Woolsey enabled America to grab the lead in the fall of 1812 by acquiring eight schooners to augment &quot;Oneida&quot; and the three-gun . On November 8, he commanded &quot;Oneida&quot; when the 19-gun warship and four of the newly acquired schooners encountered —a large, 24-gun, ship-rigged sloop-of-war off Kingston and chased her into that port. Later, they followed her in and subjected her to bombardment. In May 1813, Woolsey commanded &quot;Oneida&quot; as her guns supported the capture of York (Toronto) and the assault on Fort George.

Woolsey was promoted to master commandant in July 1813 and, by August, was in the new schooner . Late in September 1813, he commanded his ship in a running fight between the American lake flotilla and British Commodore James Lucas Yeo&#x27;s force. That series of skirmishes resulted in another period of American dominance of Lake Ontario. On 5 October, his ship participated in the capture of the British cutter HMS &quot;Drummond&quot; and the sloops-of-war , HMS &quot;Mary Ann&quot;, and HMS &quot;Lady Gore&quot; off False Duck Island.

In May 1814, after a winter of feverish preparation for the third summer of campaigning, Woolsey went to the supply depot at Oswego to pick up guns, cables, and other supplies needed at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor. While he was there, a British squadron appeared off Oswego. By spreading false intelligence about his destination, Woolsey was able to take advantage of a dark night and make good his escape. The British learned of Woolsey&#x27;s deception and sought to overtake him, which they did at Sandy Creek. Woolsey had prepared an ambush in concert with Major Daniel Appling and his 150-man contingent of the United States Rifle Regiment. A landing force sent by the British squadron was attacked by Appling&#x27;s riflemen and 200 Indian allies. Woolsey, in turn, brought his guns to bear on the squadron itself. The Americans defeated the landing force, killing 10, wounding 52, and capturing the rest. Woolsey proceeded to Sackett&#x27;s Harbor with his ordnance and supplies. Soon thereafter, he assumed command of the new brig, , and retained that command until the end of the war in 1815.

===Later life===
Woolsey left Sacketts Harbor in 1824 to assume command of the frigate, . He took it on a West Indies cruise until June 1827.

Late in 1827, he took command of the navy yard at Pensacola, Florida and moved his family there. He held the position until 1831. Between 1832 and 1834, Woolsey served as Commodore in command of the Brazilian Station.

His last active duty took him to the Chesapeake Bay, where he supervised surveys from 1836 until his health began to decline in 1837.

==Personal life==
After the war, Master Commandant Woolsey remained in command of the naval station at Sacketts Harbor. In 1816, he was promoted to captain and likely married Susan Cornelia Treadwell of Long Island, New York that year. Together, they were the parents of:

* Melancthon Brooks Woolsey (1817–1874), who married Mary Louisa Morrison, a daughter of Joseph Morrison of Baltimore. 
* James Treadwell Woolsey (1820–1894).
* Alida Livingston Woolsey (1822–1859), who married Rev. Isaac Pierson Stryker; their son, M. Woolsey Stryker, became a Presbyterian minister and President of Hamilton College.
* Robert Henry Woolsey (1824–1886), who married Mary Ann Bush in 1869.
* Susan Cornelia Woolsey (b. 1828), who married Russel W. R. Freeman in 1855.
* Mary Elizabeth Woolsey (b. 1831), who married Samuel H. Cary; after his death she married Rev. Francis Windsor Brathwaite.
* Richard Lansing Woolsey (1835–1910), who married Caroline Heming.
* Henry Livingston Woolsey

Commodore Woolsey died May 18, 1838, at Utica, New York.

==Honors==
The United States Navy named two destroyers in his honor: and commemorating both him and his son, Commodore Melancthon Brooks Woolsey.

<doc id="899491" wikidata="Q5204080" url="?curid=899491" title="D3DX">
<text>In computing, D3DX (Direct3D Extension) is a high level API library which is written to supplement Microsoft&#x27;s Direct3D graphics API. The D3DX library was introduced in Direct3D 7, and subsequently was improved in Direct3D 9. It provides classes for common calculations on vectors, matrices and colors, calculating look-at and projection matrices, spline interpolations, and several more complicated tasks, such as compiling or assembling shaders used for 3D graphic programming, compressed skeletal animation storage and matrix stacks. There are several functions that provide complex operations over 3D meshes like tangent-space computation, mesh simplification, precomputed radiance transfer, optimizing for vertex cache friendliness and strip reordering, and generators for 3D text meshes. 2D features include classes for drawing screen-space lines, text and sprite based particle systems. Spatial functions include various intersection routines, conversion from/to barycentric coordinates and bounding box and sphere generators.

The D3DX library contains pre-written routines for doing things common to most 2D/3D applications, such as games. Since the Direct3D API is relatively low-level, using the D3DX library is usually much simpler.

In 2012, Microsoft announced that D3DX 9, D3DX 10, and D3DX 11 would be deprecated in the Windows 8 SDK, along with other development frameworks such as XNA. Shader effects, texture management, geometry optimizations and mesh models are available as separate sources published through GitHub. The mathematical constructs of D3DX, like vectors and matrices, would be consolidated with XNAMath into a DirectXMath and spherical harmonics math is provided as separate source.

==Interfaces==
The D3DX library follows the COM object-oriented programming model. Functionality is accessed using C++-like interfaces.

===ID3DXEffect===
The interface is used for compiling and binding FX shaders (). It supports automatic mapping of named shader parameters to hardware constant registers, parameter pools, mapping textures to available samplers, specifying &#x27;techniques&#x27; and modifying render states.

===ID3DXFont===
The interface can be used to draw 2D text. See also D3DXCreateText that creates 3D meshes of text.

===ID3DXLine===
The interface can be used for drawing anti-aliased screen-space lines with pattern.

===ID3DXMesh===
The interface is used for storage of meshes and mesh optimization for vertex cache friendliness and strip reordering. Some functions in D3DX operate on this interface. An example is D3DXComputeTangentFrame for creating a tangent-space frame for effects like normal and parallax mapping. A descendant of this class is ID3DXPMesh that can do geometry simplification.

===ID3DXPRTEngine===
It is used for Precomputed Radiance Transfer - a technique similar to spherical harmonics lighting that is used for precomputed global illumination and soft ambient lighting.

===ID3DXSprite===
The interface is a C++ class used for drawing a 2D image to the screen known as a sprite in computer graphics. In DirectX 7 this was typically done using the DirectDraw API, which is deprecated.

The programmer typically needs only to call the ID3DXSprite object&#x27;s Begin() method to set up the render state and world transform for 2D drawing, call the Draw() method to add textures to the list to be drawn and finally call the End() method to draw the images to the screen and restore the original graphics state.

A common criticism of the D3DXSprite was that it was slow but this issue has been addressed as of Direct3D 9.

==Functions==

===D3DXComputeTangentFrame===
It computes the tangent-space frame of a mesh that is used for effects like normal/bump mapping, parallax mapping and anisotropic lighting models. It handles vertices at tangent-space discontinuities by making duplicates, thus solving the hairy ball problem. It doesn&#x27;t handle reversed UV winding of faces so models with mirrored texture mapping may run into lighting troubles because of this.

==Direct3D10==

The D3DX10 utility library for Direct3D 10 was similar to the D3DX for Direct3D 9 in functionality, and included the same D3DXMath library and Block Compression (BC1-BC5) software codecs. The key differences were that Effects for Direct3D 10 was made an OS component, the HLSL compiler was moved to a distinct D3DCompile DLL, and the texture image load &amp; save code utilized the Windows Imaging Component. As a consequence of the shift to using WIC, D3DX10 did not support Truevision TGA, RGBE image format, or Portable PixMap file formats which were supported by D3DX. D3DX10 also did not include the UVAtlas isochart texture atlasing or Precomputed Radiance Transfer APIs.

All versions of D3DX10 are deprecated per Microsoft Docs.

==Direct3D11==

The D3DX11 utility library for Direct3D 11 was a trimmed down version of D3DX10. It included texture image load &amp; save code using WIC, and the Block Compression (BC1-BC7) software codecs, but little else.

All versions of D3DX11 are deprecated per Microsoft Docs.

Most functionality from D3DX9, D3DX10, and D3DX11 has been moved to open source projects for Direct3D 11 or later: DirectXMath, DirectX Tool Kit, DirectXTex, DirectXMesh, and UVAtlas. There are also open source versions of DXUT and the Effects (FX11) runtime available.

==Direct3D12==

There is no DLL-based D3DX12 utility library. There is, however, a D3DX12 utility header (all inline C++ code) for some basic helpers for Direct3D 12 documented on Microsoft Docs and is published on GitHub. It does not include functionality such as math, sprites, font rendering, 3D shapes, meshes, or texture loading. There is a DirectX Tool Kit for Direct3D 12 which provides the missing functionality.

<doc id="899492" wikidata="Q106522115" url="?curid=899492" title="Swamp pop">
<text>Swamp pop is a music genre indigenous to the Acadiana region of south Louisiana and an adjoining section of southeast Texas. Created in the 1950s by young Cajuns and Creoles, it combines New Orleans–style rhythm and blues, country and western, and traditional French Louisiana musical influences. Although a fairly obscure genre, swamp pop maintains a large audience in its south Louisiana and southeast Texas homeland, and it has acquired a small but passionate cult following in the United Kingdom, and Northern Europe

== Characteristics ==

The swamp pop sound is typified by highly emotional, lovelorn lyrics, tripleting honky-tonk pianos, undulating bass lines, bellowing horn sections, and a strong rhythm and blues backbeat. It is exemplified by slow ballads such as Cookie and his Cupcakes&#x27; &quot;Mathilda&quot; (recorded 1958), considered as the unofficial swamp pop anthem. But the genre has also produced many upbeat compositions, such as Bobby Charles&#x27; &quot;See You Later, Alligator&quot; (1955), popularly covered by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets.

During the genre&#x27;s heyday (1958–1964), several swamp pop songs appeared on national U.S. record charts. These included Jimmy Clanton&#x27;s &quot;Just A Dream&quot; (1958), Warren Storm&#x27;s &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Song&quot; (1958), Phil Phillips&#x27; &quot;Sea Of Love&quot; (1959), Rod Bernard&#x27;s &quot;This Should Go On Forever&quot; (1959), Joe Barry&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Fool to Care&quot; (1960), and Dale &amp; Grace&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Leaving It Up to You&quot; (1963).

In swamp pop&#x27;s south Louisiana–southeast Texas birthplace, fans regarded many songs that never became national hits as classics. These include Johnnie Allan&#x27;s &quot;Lonely Days, Lonely Nights&quot; (1958), Buck Rogers&#x27; &quot;Crazy Baby&quot; (1959), Randy and the Rockets&#x27; &quot;Let&#x27;s Do the Cajun Twist&quot; (1962), T. K. Hulin&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Fool Anymore&quot; (1963), and Clint West&#x27;s &quot;Big Blue Diamond&quot; (1965), among numerous others.

== Roots and early history ==
The musicians who went on to birth swamp pop listened to (and often performed) traditional Cajun music and Creole music (which later developed into zydeco) as children, as well as popular country and western (hillbilly) songs by musicians including Bob Wills, Moon Mullican, and Hank Williams. However, as with other American youth in the mid-1950s, they discovered the alluring new sounds of rock and roll and rhythm and blues musicians such as Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Fats Domino. As a result, these teenaged Cajuns and Creoles shifted away from Louisiana French folk compositions including &quot;Jolie Blonde&quot;, &quot;Allons a Lafayette&quot;, and &quot;Les flammes d&#x27;enfer&quot;, in favor of singing rock and roll and rhythm and blues compositions in English. At the same time, they switched from folk instruments such as the accordion, fiddle, and iron triangle to modern ones including as the electric guitar and bass, upright piano, saxophone, and drumming trap set.
By the late 1950s, swamp pop musicians had developed their own distinct sound and repertoires. They performed to receptive crowds in local dancehalls encompassing the Southern Club in Opelousas, Landry&#x27;s Palladium in Lafayette, the OST Club in Rayne, and the Green Lantern in Lawtell. In addition, they released recordings on local record labels, such as Floyd Soileau&#x27;s Jin label of Ville Platte, Eddie Shuler&#x27;s Goldband of Lake Charles, Carol Rachou&#x27;s La Louisianne of Lafayette, Huey P. Meaux&#x27;s Crazy Cajun label of Houston, and a number of labels owned by J. D. Miller of Crowley, Louisiana (who also recorded swamp pop tunes for larger national labels, such as Ernie Young&#x27;s Excello Records label of Nashville).

Swamp pop musicians often adopted Anglo-American stage names that masked their Cajun surnames. John Allen Guillot, for example, became Johnnie Allan, Robert Charles Guidry became Bobby Charles, Joe Barrios adopted Joe Barry, Elwood Dugas became Bobby Page, and Terry Gene DeRouen was billed as Gene Terry. Some of these musicians changed their names because they were ashamed of their rural French heritage — a feeling shared at the time by a segment of the Cajun population. But economics motivated most swamp pop musicians: They wanted to sell records not only in southern Louisiana and southeast Texas, but beyond, where the pronunciation of ethnic surnames sauch as Guillot, Barrios, and DeRouen eluded record promoters, disc jockeys, and consumers.

Despite its obvious rock and roll and rhythm and blues influences, swamp pop was not devoid of folk characteristics. For example, Bobby Page and the Riff Raffs recorded &quot;Hippy-Ti-Yo&quot;, a bilingual rock and roll version of the traditional Cajun French song &quot;Hip et Taiaut&quot; and Rod Bernard did the same with &quot;Allons danser Colinda&quot;, another folk composition. Joe Barry re-recorded his swamp pop hit &quot;I&#x27;m A Fool To Care&quot; in French under the title &quot;Je suis bête pour t&#x27;aimer&quot;. Randy and the Rockets issued &quot;Let&#x27;s Do The Cajun Twist&quot;, an English remake of the Cajun French favorite &quot;Allons a Lafayette&quot;.

==Legacy==
From 1950s to 1960s, swamp pop songs have appeared in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40. While swamp pop drew heavily on New Orleans rhythm and blues, it reciprocated by making a detectable impact on songs including Lloyd Price&#x27;s &quot;Stagger Lee&quot;(number 1, 1959), and Clarence &quot;Frogman&quot; Henry&#x27;s &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Know Why) But I Do&quot; (number 4, 1961) (Bobby Charles compositions). Swamp pop also left its imprint on the related but distinct genre known as &quot;swamp blues&quot;, including Slim Harpo&#x27;s &quot;Rainin&#x27; in My Heart&quot;. Bobby Charles released the album &quot;Bobby Charles&quot; (1972) that included &quot;Small Town Talk&quot;.

Leon Russell, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Dale Hawkins, Tony Joe White, John Fogerty and Creedence Clearwater Revival were influenced by swamp pop. Swamp pop&#x27;s impact on popular music is heard in the Rolling Stones&#x27; cover of Barbara Lynn&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ll Lose a Good Thing&quot; and &quot;Oh Baby (We Got A Good Thing Goin&#x27;)&quot;, the Honeydrippers&#x27; rendition of Phil Phillips&#x27; &quot;Sea of Love&quot;, Elvis Presley&#x27;s cover of Lloyd Price&#x27;s &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;, and even The Beatles&#x27; swamp-inspired &quot;Oh! Darling&quot;.

Swamp pop influenced Tejano music, particularly the recordings of Freddy Fender&#x27;s early swampy songs &quot;Before the Next Teardrop Falls&quot; and &quot;Wasted Days and Wasted Nights&quot; in 1975. South Louisiana and southeast Texas audiences generally consider Fender a full-fledged swamp pop musician.

Although swamp pop began a slow decline with the onslaught of the mid-1960s British Invasion, the genre continues to draw devoted fans to south Louisiana and southeast Texas festivals and nightclubs. Some younger non-swamp musicians, such as Cajun artist Zachary Richard and C. C. Adcock, have acknowledged a strong swamp pop influence.

<text>Rassilon is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. In the backstory of the programme, he was the founder of Time Lord society on the planet Gallifrey and its first leader, as Lord High President. After the original television series ended in 1989, Rassilon&#x27;s character and history were developed in books and other media.

==Character history==
Within the universe of the television series, there are many contradictory legends about Rassilon. It is known that he developed the technology for time travel that made his people lords of time in the distant past together with his colleague Omega. Omega, a stellar engineer, was presumed killed by the supernova that created the black hole later known as the Eye of Harmony, and Rassilon harnessed the nucleus of the black hole to provide the energy that powers time travel. Rassilon then took control of Gallifrey and became the first and, to date, only Lord High President, his successors taking the title Lord President. The official history is that he was a benevolent ruler who ruled his people wisely. However, there are other accounts which paint Rassilon as a cruel dictator. The first mention of Rassilon is in the Fourth Doctor serial &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;.

Rassilon&#x27;s contributions to Time Lord culture and society were immense, and his name both reverberates and is honoured throughout Time Lord history. The Rassilon Imprimatur is the name given to the symbiotic nucleus of Time Lords&#x27; cell structures that allows them to withstand the molecular stresses of time travel and grants them a link to their TARDIS time machines.

Several other Time Lord artifacts named after him have a technological function, in addition to their ceremonial roles:
* The Sash of Rassilon allows the wearer to be in close proximity to the singularity that is the Eye of Harmony, providing protection from the Eye&#x27;s gravitational and energy forces, and preventing the wearer from being drawn across the event horizon of the captured black hole. Use of the Sash in this way is cited as having a regenerative effect upon the wearer.
* The Crown of Rassilon (or matrix circlet) gives full access to the Matrix, providing a direct mental link to the computer network that serves as the repository of all Time Lord knowledge and their personality prints, captured at death in the Amplified Panatropic Computer (A.P.C net) that is a subsidiary part of the Matrix itself.
* The Key of Rassilon allows physical access to the Matrix, for maintenance of this &#x27;micro-universe&#x27; repository of Time Lord knowledge. Confusingly, this is a separate artifact from the so-called Great Key of Rassilon, that provides direct tapping of the near limitless energies of the Eye of Harmony, and is cited as a vital component part of the demat gun (a weapon of mass destruction); it is also hinted that this &#x27;key&#x27; is essential to accessing the other relative dimensions in time, in &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;.
* The Rod of Rassilon (referred to as &quot;the Great Key&quot; in the Book of the Old Time in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;) allows the user to physically access the containment/control apparatus of the Eye of Harmony itself, that was historically hidden beneath the Panopticon central dais.
* The Coronet of Rassilon gives the user the ability to amplify and to project their own will to dominate others, but its effects can be defeated, if recognised, by a co-ordinated resistance of many minds.
* The Harp of Rassilon is a musical key that unlocks a secret room within the High Council chambers. This hidden compartment held the controls for the Time Scoop—a rudimentary &quot;time corridor&quot; technology, used presumably before time travel was perfected by Rassilon after the installation of the Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey.
* The Ring of Rassilon ostensibly grants the wearer immortality, but seemingly is keyed to Rassilon&#x27;s DNA only, so that any other seizing the artifact is locked in perpetual imprisonment as a stone carving relief on Rassilon&#x27;s bier.
* The Black Scrolls of Rassilon are parchment documents containing forbidden knowledge from the Dark Time, not recorded in the Matrix.
Rassilon is also given credit, variously, for TARDIS technology; the living metal and super-weapon validium; and the defensive Quantum Force Field and Transduction Barriers that protected Gallifrey. How much of this is true and how much of it is propaganda is not certain. However, it is established that a TARDIS derives its power primarily from the Eye of Harmony.

The Tomb or Tower of Rassilon, also known as the Dark Tower, stands in the middle of the Death Zone—a blasted, barren plain—on Gallifrey. The Death Zone was used, in a period of Gallifrey&#x27;s history known as the Dark Time, as an arena that pitted warriors of various alien species and times (captured by the use of a device called the Time Scoop) against each other in gladiatorial games, although the Second Doctor tells the Brigadier that Rassilon put a stop to the games (&quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, 1983). It was rumoured that Rassilon, who lived during this time, had been deposed by Time Lords rebelling against his rule. It was also claimed Rassilon had discovered the secret of immortality and was still alive in the Tower, sleeping. The quest to reach Rassilon&#x27;s tomb and the secret, blocked by a series of deadly obstacles, is referred to as &quot;The Game of Rassilon&quot;.

===&quot;The Five Doctors&quot;===

In &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, Lord President Borusa wants Rassilon&#x27;s secret for himself, describing Rassilon&#x27;s immortality as &quot;perpetual bodily regeneration&quot;. Borusa uses the Time Scoop to transport the Doctor in the majority of his incarnations (along with various companions) to the Death Zone, using them to clear the way to the Tower. The First Doctor deduced from the riddle &quot;This is the Game of Rassilon; to lose is to win and he who wins shall lose&quot; that the Game was a trap to get rid of Time Lords who might be a danger to their race. Borusa is granted immortality by being transformed into a living statue. Rassilon subsequently returned the first three Doctors to their proper places in time and space and freed the Fourth Doctor from the time eddy in which he had been trapped. In that story, Rassilon (played by Richard Mathews) appears as a disembodied image floating above his own sepulchre, but the nature of this apparition is not explained.

People with major involvement in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin off media and in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, when asked in &quot;The Essential Doctor Who&quot; magazine, were divided over whether the image of Rassilon seen in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; is actually alive or an artificial intelligence or if he had ever died prior to &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;. According to &quot;DWM&quot; editor Tom Spilsbury, it hadn&#x27;t occurred to him before that he was anything other than being alive, and that &quot;it might come down to semantics over what being alive means&quot;. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; scriptwriter Gareth Roberts believed that Rassilon is dead and the face that appears is &quot;a clever AI&quot;. Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies believed that Rassilon is &quot;clearly alive&quot;, with his big face in the story being &quot;A projection from the Matrix. A mental life extending beyond the body&#x27;s death.&quot; Spin-off writer George Mann believed that Rassilon &quot;was&quot; dead, but the Time Lords had figured out a way of &quot;resurrecting dead people in extreme circumstances&quot;, doing &quot;something horrible and timey wimey&quot;. Spin-off writer and &quot;DWM&quot; columnist Jacqueline Rayner described his condition as &quot;a permanent sleep which is pretty much indistinguishable from death&quot;, and that &quot;He&#x27;s immortal, but he has no awareness,&quot; and when the trap inside the Tomb of Rassilon is triggered, &quot;he becomes semi-aware so he can oversee or judge what&#x27;s going on, before going back into his eternal sleep again&quot;. &quot;DWM&quot; deputy editor Peter Ware believed that Rassilon is dead by the time of &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, and his dead mind is speaking from the Matrix to the Doctors and Borusa. He mentions the line from the episode &quot;Hell Bent&quot; (2015)—&quot;Rassilon the resurrected&quot;, as further proof that he had died. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; scriptwriter Mark Gatiss quipped that Rassilon is &quot;biding his time until he regenerates into [actor] Daniel Craig&quot;. Head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat, who also wrote &quot;Hell Bent&quot;, understood that Rassilon was &quot;alive, but in &#x27;eternal sleep&#x27;&quot;, having got up from his eternal sleep to participate in the Time War, &quot;And got killed. And resurrected. Because that happened a lot in the Time War.&quot; According to scriptwriter Terrance Dicks, who wrote &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, Rassilon has &quot;gone to a higher plane where he&#x27;s a benevolent being who can, if he feels it&#x27;s a big enough crisis, intervene&quot;.

=== Revived series ===
Rassilon (portrayed by Timothy Dalton) appears as the villainous mastermind of &quot;The End of Time&quot;, the two-part finale of the series&#x27; 2009 Specials. Though referred to by name by the Tenth Doctor, Dalton is credited as the &#x27;Narrator / Lord President&#x27; with Russell T Davies confirming his name in a &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot; episode.

During the Time War, Rassilon became ruthless and determined to avoid death at any cost, motivating his formulating of the &quot;Final Sanction&quot; which would destroy all creation while elevating himself and the Time Lords into beings of pure consciousness. The Doctor in his War Doctor incarnation learned of this and decided to end the war using the Gallifreyan superweapon called &quot;the Moment&quot;. With the prophecy deciphered that the Doctor would destroy Gallifrey to end the Time War, and told he would die on that day, Rassilon refuses to accept his fate and killed his advisor for speaking out against his plans.

Anticipating Gallifrey&#x27;s complete annihilation in &quot;The End of Time&quot; (2009–10), Rassilon attempted to break the planet out of the Time Lock implemented in the latter phases of the Time War to block creative attacks involving time travel, placing a drumbeat (actually the heartbeat of Gallifreyian twin-hearts) in the mind of the Master when he was a child. As a result, Rassilon is the cause of the Master&#x27;s insanity and indirectly responsible for the Time Lord&#x27;s actions. When the Master turned all of humanity into copies of himself, the now-amplified drum beat acts as a signal that, with a White Point Star diamond (a diamond unique to the planet, Gallifrey), allows Rassilon and Gallifrey to escape the Time Lock. Destroying the White Point Star, the Doctor severs the link between Gallifrey and Earth. Rassilon&#x27;s attempts to kill the Doctor in revenge are blocked by the Master, vengeful owing to his manipulation by Rassilon, who then follows him and the other Time Lords into the last day of the Time War.

In &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013), the Time Lords are revealed not to have been destroyed at the Time War&#x27;s conclusion; all incarnations of the Doctor united and used their TARDISes to send Gallifrey into a pocket dimension. In &quot;Hell Bent&quot; (2015), the Twelfth Doctor arrives on Gallifrey and learns that a regenerated Rassilon was responsible for his imprisonment and torture for four and a half billion years, as well as indirectly responsible for the death of his companion, Clara. On arriving on Gallifrey, he leads a military revolt against Rassilon, deposes him, and sends him into exile. Timothy Dalton was asked to reprise the role for the episode, but was replaced by Donald Sumpter as a regenerated Rassilon when he became unavailable for filming.

==Other appearances==
Rassilon&#x27;s rise to power was explored in the Virgin New Adventures&quot;. It is revealed in the novel that Ancient Gallifrey was ruled by the Pythia, who controlled the population through prophecies and superstition. Rassilon, whose followers believed in science and rationality, led a revolution against the Pythia, eventually causing her to kill herself, and send her followers to the planet Karn. However, before she died she cursed Rassilon and all future Time Lords to sterility. Rassilon&#x27;s unborn daughter was one of the deaths. In later New Adventures we are introduced to the concept of the genetic Looms, from which new Time Lords were created. This leads to Rassilon becoming part of a ruling triumvirate with Omega and a mysterious figure called the Other. Together they rebuilt Gallifrey and re-ordered the universe along rational and scientific lines, outlawing superstition and banishing magic. The later novel &quot;Lungbarrow&quot; shows Rassilon becoming increasingly tyrannical and violently crushing resistance to his reforms, which ultimately leads to the Other breaking with him and throwing himself into the genetic looms, leading to his later apparent reincarnation as the Doctor.

In the last three stories of Alan Moore&#x27;s run on &quot;Doctor Who Monthly&quot; we see the first Time War in Time Lord history, where the Order of the Black Sun make a pre-emptive strike on the Gallifreyans&#x27; experiments with time travel. In the first story, &quot;Star Death&quot; (&quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; #47), we see Rassilon gaining the equipment to control time travel thanks to the failed initial attack. In the DWM comic strips, Rassilon is shown existing in the Matrix as part of a council of &quot;Higher Evolutionaries&quot; acting as the guardians of Time (&quot;The Tides of Time&quot; Part 2, DWM #62, among others).

In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions, Rassilon is voiced by Don Warrington. He is shown to continue to exist in the Matrix. According to audio plays, Rassilon developed the power of regeneration from the Vampires, who were apparently peaceful until the Time Lords attacked them. He transforms the Doctor into his assassin—a being of pure anti-time that identifies itself as Zagreus—to defeat the Divergents, a race who would have evolved to surpass the Time Lords if reality had progressed as it should have, only for his plans to fail when the Doctor proclaims that he does not kill and Zagreus refuses to be Rassilon&#x27;s puppet.

At the end of &quot;Zagreus&quot;, the Doctor is exiled to the Divergents&#x27; universe, having previously cast Rassilon into that reality to end his actions but unable to return to his universe as he was still contaminated by anti-time. He eventually tracks down Rassilon in that universe, and discovers that he has been manipulating an entity called the Kro&#x27;Ka to observe and control the Doctor and Charley&#x27;s actions. At the end of the events of &quot;The Next Life&quot;, the Doctor and his companions escape the timeless Divergent universe—Rassilon having previously filtered the Zagreus energies out of the Doctor upon his arrival in this universe without the Doctor&#x27;s knowledge—but Rassilon and the Kro&#x27;Ka remain trapped in a permanent loop.

Rassilon&#x27;s next audio appearance comes in &quot;Desperate Measures&quot;, concluding the ninth series of Big Finish Productions spin-off &quot;Gallifrey&quot;. During the Time War the Time Lord Valerian (David Sibley) becomes a host through whom Rassilon is resurrected to lead Gallifrey. These events will lead into the tenth series of the spin-off where the part will be played by Terrence Hardiman. This season ends with Romana attempting to arrange an assassination to stop his dictatorship, ending with Rassilon beginning to regenerate. The series ends on a cliffhanger as he uses his regeneration as a propaganda opportunity.

In &quot;Doctor Who: The Adventure Games&quot;, Rassilon&#x27;s Final Sanction is mentioned when Amy Pond looked at a Time Lord Staff that the Eleventh Doctor kept in his study.

Rassilon features in the War Doctor novel &quot;Engines of War&quot; by George Mann, which looks at the events that led to the War Doctor&#x27;s decision to use the Moment, including the discovery that Rassilon has resurrected Borusa as a possibility engine to help him decide what actions he should take during the war.

Rassilon returns to Gallifrey in the Titan Comics 2016 multi-Doctor event story &quot;Supremacy of the Cybermen&quot;, which depicts the last Cybermen at the end of the universe forming an alliance with Rassilon with the goal of conquering Gallifrey and using Time Lord energy to regenerate the universe into one under Cyber-control. Although Rassilon&#x27;s insight allows the Cybermen to conquer history and defeat all of the past Doctors, the Twelfth Doctor is able to convince Rassilon to help him after the Cybermen betray Rassilon, the two turning the Cybermens&#x27; equipment against them so that the universe is &#x27;regenerated&#x27; to a point before the Cybermen conquered Gallifrey. Although the Twelfth Doctor is the only one shown to remember these events, he is shown speculating that Rassilon may also remember the horrors of what he did.

In the subsequent Titan Comics special &quot;The Lost Dimension&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor briefly accidentally travels back to ancient Gallifrey where he assists Rassilon in a testflight of the very first Tardis.

<text>Melancthon Brooks Woolsey (11 August 1817 – 2 October 1874) was an officer in the United States Navy during and after the American Civil War. He was commodore of the South Atlantic Station in the 1870s.

==Biography==

Woolsey was the first son of Commodore Melancthon Taylor Woolsey and Susan C. Treadwell; he was born at Sacketts Harbor, New York. His brother James Treadwell Woolsey was born about 1820. M.B. Woolsey entered the Navy as a midshipman on 24 September 1832. After duty at sea and a tour at the Naval School, Woolsey became a midshipman on 16 July 1840.

Woolsey was a descendant of George (Joris) Woolsey, one of the earliest settlers of New Amsterdam, and Thomas Cornell (settler)

He progressed through the rank of master to that of lieutenant by 1847. He was placed on the reserve list as lieutenant by the retiring board in September 1855. Lt. Woolsey was called back to active duty in 1861 as a result of the American Civil War.

Assigned initially to the receiving ship at New York, Woolsey assumed command of the steamer &quot;Ellen&quot; by late 1861 and began patrol duty with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. During that tour, his ship fought Confederate forces on three separate occasions. In May 1862, he engaged Fort Pemberton at Wapper Creek, South Carolina. On 1 June, his ship repelled a Confederate cavalry attack at Secessionville. Three days later, he commanded &quot;Ellen&quot; during the attack on James Island.

In July 1862, he was promoted to commander and placed in command of the sloop &quot;Vandalia&quot;. That duty lasted until early 1863, at which time he was transferred to command of the steamer &quot;Princess Royal&quot;. That ship was assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron and patrolled the coasts of Louisiana and Texas. On 28 June 1863, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; helped to defend the town of Donaldsonville, Louisiana, against a determined Southern attack, and Comdr. Woolsey received high commendation from his superiors for his ship&#x27;s contribution to the successful defense of the town. He remained with the blockade through the end of the war and, by July 1866, saw his name returned to the active list in the rank of captain.

Following the Civil War, Capt. Woolsey commanded the sloop-of-war &quot;Pawnee&quot; on the South Atlantic Station in 1867 and 1868. In 1869, he took command of the South Atlantic Station flagship &quot;Guerriere&quot;. In 1871, Woolsey was promoted to commodore, probably as flag officer in charge of the South Atlantic Station. His last tour of duty came in March 1873, when he took over as commandant of the navy yard at Pensacola, Florida.

Commodore Woolsey received orders detaching him from command of the navy yard in the summer of 1874. At the time, an epidemic of yellow fever raged at Pensacola, and he deemed it necessary to remain at his post to prevent panic. He contracted the highly infectious disease and died at Pensacola in the summer of 1874.

==Honors==
* The first USS &quot;Woolsey&quot; (Destroyer No. 77) was named in honor of his father.
* The second USS &quot;Woolsey&quot; (DD-437) commemorated both him and his father.

<doc id="899503" wikidata="Q688711" url="?curid=899503" title="Pippin (musical)">
<text>Pippin is a 1972 musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Roger O. Hirson. Bob Fosse, who directed the original Broadway production, also contributed to the libretto. The musical uses the premise of a mysterious performance troupe, led by the Leading Player, to tell the story of Pippin, a young prince on his search for meaning and significance. The fourth wall is broken numerous times during most traditional productions.

The protagonist, Pippin, and his father, Charlemagne, are characters derived from two historical figures of the early Middle Ages, though the plot is fictional and presents no historical accuracy regarding either. The show was partially financed by Motown Records. As of January 2024, the original run of &quot;Pippin&quot; is the 37th longest-running Broadway show.

Ben Vereen and Patina Miller won Tony Awards for their portrayals of the Leading Player in the original Broadway production and the 2013 revival, respectively, making them the first actors to win Tonys for Best Leading Actor and Best Leading Actress in a Musical, for the same role.

== Background ==
&quot;Pippin&quot; was originally conceived as a student musical, &quot;Pippin, Pippin&quot;, performed by Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Scotch&#x27;n&#x27;Soda theatre troupe. Stephen Schwartz collaborated with Ron Strauss, but when Schwartz decided to develop the show further, Strauss left the project. Schwartz has said that not a single line or note from Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s &quot;Pippin&quot; made it into the final version.

==Synopsis==
=== Act 1 ===
This musical begins with the Leading Player of a traveling performance and the accompanying Players inviting the audience to witness their show, breaking the fourth wall (&quot;Magic to Do&quot;). They begin telling the story of Pippin (who they say is being portrayed by a new actor making his stage debut), the first son of King Charlemagne. Addressing the Players as if they are the professors at his college graduation, Pippin sings of his wish for fulfillment, believing he must find his purpose in life (&quot;Corner of the Sky&quot;). Pippin returns home to the castle and estate of his father. Charlemagne and Pippin don&#x27;t get a chance to communicate often, as they are constantly interrupted by nobles, soldiers, and courtiers vying for Charlemagne&#x27;s attention (&quot;Welcome Home&quot;). Pippin also meets with his ambitious stepmother Fastrada, and her dim-witted son Lewis. Charlemagne and Lewis are planning on going into battle against the Visigoths soon, and Pippin begs his father to take him along as a soldier to prove himself. Charlemagne reluctantly agrees and proceeds to explain the battle plan to his men (&quot;War is a Science&quot;), interrupted repeatedly by an over-enthusiastic Pippin.

The Players express the battle through song and dance, with the Leading Player and two lead dancers in the middle (performing Bob Fosse&#x27;s famous &quot;Manson Trio&quot;) whilst depictions of violence and dismemberment occur behind them (&quot;Glory&quot;). Charlemagne declares victory, and leads his army off to the next battle, eager for more glory. A disillusioned Pippin has a cynical discussion with the severed head of an enemy soldier, recognizing the futility of battle. He flees to the countryside as the Leading Player sings of the pleasures of a free and easy life (&quot;Simple Joys&quot;). There, Berthe, his paternal grandmother, exiled by Fastrada, tells Pippin to stop worrying about his future, and rather to enjoy the pleasures and comforts of the present (&quot;No Time at All&quot;). Pippin takes this advice to heart and searches for more lighthearted pastimes. He begins to enjoy many meaningless sexual encounters, but it soon becomes overwhelming and Pippin forces all the women away (&quot;With You&quot;), discovering that relationships without love leave you feeling &quot;empty and vacant&quot;.

The Leading Player enters and talks with the now exhausted Pippin, suggesting that fulfillment can be found in fighting against his father&#x27;s tyrannical ways. He agrees, and becomes the leader of a revolution against his father. Fastrada learns of Pippin&#x27;s plan, and she takes advantage of it by devising a plan of her own— if Pippin either successfully kills Charlemagne, or fails and is arrested for treason, Lewis will be next in line for the throne either way. She manipulates Charlemagne into going to his annual prayer early, and she tells Pippin that he will be at the chapel unarmed (&quot;Spread a Little Sunshine&quot;). At the royal chapel at Arles, Pippin confronts his father, who justifies his cruelty and tyranny as being necessary tools to achieve peace and prosperity for the realm. He dismissively tells Pippin to do what he must. Pippin assassinates his father, and the people bow to their new king, rejoicing that the tyranny has come to an end (&quot;Morning Glow&quot;). The Leading Player mentions to the audience that they will break for now, but to expect a thoroughly thrilling finale.

=== Act 2 ===
As king, Pippin brings peace to the land by giving to the poor, eradicating taxes, ending the military, and peacefully settling foreign disputes. However, this soon falls apart, as Pippin is forced to go back on many of his promises, reverting to the tyrannical ways of his father. At Pippin&#x27;s request, the Leading Player revives Charlemagne, who takes the throne back, and Pippin is left discouraged, as his life is still unfulfilled. The Leading Player counsels him to keep going down his life&#x27;s path (&quot;On the Right Track&quot;), but after experimenting with art and religion, Pippin falls into monumental despair and collapses on the floor.

Widowed farm-owner Catherine finds him on the street and is attracted by the arch of his foot (&quot;And There He Was&quot;), and when Pippin comes to, she introduces herself (&quot;Kind of Woman&quot;). From the start, it is clear that the Leading Player is concerned with Catherine&#x27;s acting ability and actual attraction to Pippin — after all, she is but a player playing a part in the Leading Player&#x27;s yet-to-be-unfolded plan. Catherine has Pippin help as a farmhand on her estate. At first, Pippin thinks himself above such things (&quot;Extraordinary&quot;), but after comforting her son, Theo, on the sickness and eventual death of his pet duck (&quot;Prayer for a Duck&quot;), he warms up to Catherine and finds himself attracted to her (&quot;Love Song&quot;). However, as time goes by, Pippin realizes he&#x27;s grown too comfortable in monotony, and leaves the estate to continue searching for his true purpose. Catherine is heartbroken and reflects on him, spontaneously beginning a song that was not initially in the script, much to the Leading Player&#x27;s anger and surprise (&quot;I Guess I&#x27;ll Miss the Man&quot;).

All alone on a stage, Pippin is surrounded by the Leading Player and the various Players. They tell him that the only fulfilling thing is their one perfect act, the Finale, in which Pippin will light himself on fire and &quot;become one with the flame&quot;, implying that he will die in the process. They compare him to the sun, convincing him to sacrifice his life for one burst of glory, Just when he is about to do it, he realizes that there has to be something other than death and chooses not to follow through. Catherine and Theo enter, defying the script, and stand beside Pippin. He sings to her, realizing that his purpose was never in magic or spectacle, but rather to live an ordinary life (&quot;Finale&quot;/&quot;Magic Shows and Miracles&quot;). The furious Leading Player throws a fit, calling off the show and telling the rest of the Players and the orchestra to pack up, leaving Pippin, Catherine, and Theo alone on the empty stage without sets, lights or costumes. Alone and abandoned by the troupe, Catherine asks Pippin how he feels. Pippin answers, &quot;Trapped...but happy—which isn&#x27;t too bad for the end of a musical comedy.&quot;

===Extended ending===
The &quot;Theo ending&quot; was originally conceived in 1998 by Mitch Sebastian, and is included in all newer productions of &quot;Pippin&quot;, including the 2013 Broadway revival. After the Players shun Pippin for not performing the grand finale, and he avers his contentment with a simple life with Catherine, Theo remains alone on stage and sings a verse of &quot;Corner of the Sky&quot;, after which the Leading Player and the Players return, backed by the &quot;Magic to Do&quot; melody, implying that the existential crisis at the heart of the play is part of a cycle and will now continue, but with Theo as the Players&#x27; replacement for Pippin. Current productions vary between the two possible endings, though Schwartz himself has expressed his preference for the newer ending. This is also the ending used in most licensed versions of the musical. 

Notes
==Musical numbers==
Though &quot;Pippin&quot; is written to be performed in one act and its single-arc structure does not easily accommodate an intermission, many performances are broken into two acts. In the two-act version currently licensed by Musical Theatre International, the intermission comes after &quot;Morning Glow&quot;, with an Act I finale – an abridged version of &quot;Magic to Do&quot; – inserted after Charles&#x27; murder. As with the new ending, the intermission can be added at the director&#x27;s discretion without additional permission required. The 2013 Broadway revival is performed with an intermission.

In the original 1972 production, Fosse planned to use Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s songs &quot;Marking Time&quot; and &quot;Just Between the Two of Us&quot;, but before the show opened on Broadway the songs were replaced with &quot;Extraordinary&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot; respectively. The songs &quot;Spread a Little Sunshine&quot; and &quot;On the Right Track&quot; were added to the show during its rehearsal period at the request of Bob Fosse. &quot;And There He Was&quot; was cut from the show before it made it to Broadway, but was incorporated into all future revisions.

==Productions==

===Original Broadway production===
The show premiered at the Imperial Theater on October 23, 1972, and ran for 1,944 performances before closing on June 12, 1977. It was directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse. The original cast was led by Ben Vereen as Leading Player, John Rubinstein as Pippin, Eric Berry as Charlemagne, Leland Palmer as Fastrada, Christopher Chadman as Lewis, Irene Ryan as Berthe, Jill Clayburgh as Catherine, and Shane Nickerson as Theo.

Clive Barnes commented for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;It is a commonplace set to rock music, and I must say I found most of the music somewhat characterless...It is nevertheless consistently tuneful and contains a few rock ballads that could prove memorable.&quot; Advertising for the Broadway production broke new ground with the first TV commercial that actually showed scenes from a Broadway show. The 60-second commercial showed Ben Vereen and two chorus dancers, Candy Brown and Pamela Sousa, in the instrumental dance sequence from &quot;Glory&quot;. The commercial ended with the tagline, &quot;You can see the other 119 minutes of Pippin live at the Imperial Theatre, without commercial interruption.&quot;

Musical theatre scholar Scott Miller said in his 1996 book, &quot;From Assassins to West Side Story&quot;, &quot;&quot;Pippin&quot; is a largely under-appreciated musical with a great deal more substance to it than many people realize...Because of its 1970s pop style score and a somewhat emasculated licensed version for amateur productions, which is very different from the original Broadway production, the show now has a reputation for being merely cute and harmlessly naughty; but if done the way director Bob Fosse envisioned it, the show is surreal and disturbing.&quot; Fosse introduced &quot;quasi-Brechtian elements&quot; to empower audiences. Brecht&#x27;s &#x27;distancing effect&#x27; breaks the illusion of reality to encourage analysis of the play&#x27;s meaning. The ambiguity of Pippin&#x27;s &quot;trapped, but happy&quot; line forces spectators to confront the frustrations of ordinary life as well as the fruitlessness of Pippin&#x27;s attempt at revolution. Distancing empowers the spectator to think, and moreover to decide for themselves.

=== Original West End production ===
The show opened in the West End at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre on October 30, 1973, and ran for 85 performances. Louise Quick, Fosse&#x27;s personal assistant, and Gene Foote, an original cast member, co-directed this production with Fosse&#x27;s original staging and choreography. The cast included Northern Calloway as the Leading Player, Paul Jones as Pippin, John Turner as Charlemagne, Diane Langton as Fastrada, Elisabeth Welch as Berthe, and Patricia Hodge as Catherine.

=== National tours ===
The first US tour opened on September 20, 1974, at the Scranton Cultural Center. The production starred Irving Lee as the Leading Player, Barry Williams as Pippin, I. M. Hobson as Charlemagne, Louisa Flanigan as Fastrada, Adam Grammis as Lewis, Dortha Duckworth as Berthe, Carol Fox Prescott as Catherine, and Eric Brown as Theo. The production closed at The Playhouse on Rodney Square in Wilmington, Delaware, on April 5, 1975.

A second tour starring Michael Rupert as Pippin, Larry Riley as the Leading Player, Eric Berry as Charles (reprising his role from the original Broadway cast), and Thelma Carpenter as Berthe opened at the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera on August 2, 1977. The tour closed at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion back in Los Angeles on August 26, 1978.

A third tour began opened on October 7, 2006, at the Eisenhower Hall Theatre in West Point, New York. The cast was led by Andre Ward as the Leading Player, Joshua Park as Pippin, Micky Dolenz as Charlemagne, Shannon Lewis as Fastrada, James Royce Edwards as Lewis, Teal Wicks as Catherine, and Jason Blaines as Theo. The production ended its run on January 15, 2007, at the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The fourth US tour (the 2013 Broadway revival version) launched in September 2014, at the Buell Theatre in Denver, Colorado, with Sasha Allen as Leading Player, Kyle Selig as Pippin, John Rubinstein as Charles, Sabrina Harper as Fastrada, Kristine Reese as Catherine, and Lucie Arnaz as Berthe. Selig was placed on vocal rest just one week before the tour was scheduled to open and was replaced by Matthew James Thomas. Despite being said to be on a medical leave of absence, Selig never rejoined the touring company; but instead, when Thomas left the production, he was replaced by Kyle Dean Massey. Andrea Martin reprised her role as Berthe for the last two weeks of the San Francisco engagement and the entire Los Angeles engagement of the tour. In Dallas in summer of 2015 the role of Berthe was played by Adrienne Barbeau and Pippin by Sam Lips. Gabrielle McClinton (who performed the role on Broadway as Tony Award Winner Patina Miller&#x27;s understudy) replaced Sasha Allen as Leading Player on July 29, 2015, in Chicago, and Brian Flores replaced Sam Lips as Pippin.

=== Broadway revival ===
A new production was developed for the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The production was directed by Diane Paulus, with choreography by Chet Walker, scenic design by Scott Pask, costume design by Dominique Lemieux, lighting design by Kenneth Posner, sound design by Clive Goodwin, orchestrations by Larry Hochman, music supervision by Nadia DiGiallonardo, and music direction by Charlie Alterman. This production integrates illusions by Paul Kieve and circus acts created by Gypsy Snider and performed by the Montreal-based troupe &quot;Les 7 Doigts de la Main&quot;. The cast was led by Matthew James Thomas as the title prince, Patina Miller as Leading Player, Andrea Martin as Berthe, Rachel Bay Jones as Catherine, Erik Altemus as Lewis, Terrence Mann as King Charles, Charlotte d&#x27;Amboise as Fastrada and Andrew Cekala as Theo. The players were Gregory Arsenal, Lolita Costet, Colin Cunliffe, Andrew Fitch, Orion Griffiths, Viktoria Grimmy, Olga Karmansky, Bethany Moore, Stephanie Pope, Philip Rosenberg, Yannick Thomas, Molly Tynes, and Anthony Wayne. Miller was nervous to take on the role of the Leading Player, re-creating a character originated by the highly acclaimed Vereen. However, the challenge presented by such a role, and the representational power of the gender-blind casting, outweighed the apprehension. &quot;I know there are people who wonder why the Leading Player has to be a woman this time, but one of the great things about revivals is to be able to do things in a new and exciting way&quot;, Miller said. Composer Stephen Schwartz was present to oversee the sitzprobe. The production omits the first act number &quot;Welcome Home&quot;. The A.R.T. production opened on December 5, 2012, and ran through January 20, 2013.

The production transferred to Broadway beginning with previews on March 23, 2013, at the Music Box Theatre, followed by an opening on April 25. The same cast that performed at the A.R.T. transferred to the Broadway production. Diane Paulus again directed, with circus choreography and acrobatics by Chet Walker and Gypsy Snider. This revival won four categories at the 67th Tony Awards out of 10 nominations, including Best Revival, Best Leading Actress for Miller, Best Featured Actress for Martin, and Best Direction for Paulus. On April 1, 2014, the roles of Pippin and Leading Player were taken over by Kyle Dean Massey and Ciara Renée, respectively. The role of Berthe was taken over by Tovah Feldshuh, Annie Potts, and then Priscilla Lopez. On June 19, 2014 John Rubinstein, the original Pippin in 1972, replaced Terrence Mann in the role of Charles. From September 2, 2014, through September 21, 2014, the role of Berthe was played again by Andrea Martin, who won the Tony for her portrayal of Berthe in 2013. In September 2014, Carly Hughes replaced Ciara Renee as the Leading Player. In November, Josh Kaufman, winner of the sixth season of U.S. television series &quot;The Voice&quot;, took over the role of Pippin from Kyle Dean Massey.

The Broadway revival closed on January 4, 2015.

=== Other productions ===
The original Australian production (a replica of the Broadway production) opened in February 1974 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Melbourne. It starred John Farnham as Pippin, with Ronne Arnold as the Leading Player, Colleen Hewett as Catherine, Nancye Hayes as Fastrada, David Ravenswood as Charles and Jenny Howard as Berthe. The production transferred to Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Sydney in August 1974. A cast album was released and it reached 60th on the Australian charts according to the Kent Music Report.

Following an 8-month suspension of theatrical performances due to the global coronavirus pandemic, &quot;Pippin&quot; was the first major musical to open in Australia, produced by the Gordon Frost Organisation at the Lyric Theatre in Sydney. Previews began 24 November with an official opening on 3 December 2020, and a planned closing on January 31, 2021. The production reproduces the 2014 Broadway revival and is directed by Diane Paulus. It stars Ainsley Melham as the title character and Gabrielle McClinton, reprising her Broadway role as Leading Player. The cast also includes: Simon Burke as Charlemagne, Lucy Maunder as Catherine, Leslie Bell as Fastrada, Euan Doidge as Lewis and Kerri-Anne Kennerley as Berthe. Theo is alternated between Ryan Yates, George Halahan-Cantwell, Andrew Alexander and William Wheeler. The production was criticized for failing to cast a local woman of colour as the Leading Player.

In 1974, &quot;Pippin&quot; made its Spanish-language debut at Teatro de los Insurgentes in Mexico City. It was produced by Mexican pop singer Julissa, who also played Catherine. Also in the cast were Burt Rodríguez as Leading Player, Héctor Ortiz as Pippin, Guillermo Rivas as Charles, Anita Blanch as Berthe, and Jacqueline Voltaire as Fastrada. A cast album was released by Discos Gas.

On June 10, 1975, the musical made its African debut at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was produced by musical duo Des and Dawn Lindberg and starred Sammy Brown as Leading Player, Hal Watters as Pippin, Robin Dolton as Charles, Andre Haddingh as Catherine, Jo-Ann Pezarro as Fastrada, and Bess Finney as Berthe. A cast recording was released by Satbel later in 1975.

In 1986, a production of &quot;Pippin&quot; toured throughout the US, directed by Ben Vereen. Vereen also reprised his original role of the Leading Player. The production was choreographed by Kathryn Doby, who was also in the original production. The cast featured: Sam Scalamoni (Pippin), Betty Ann Grove (Berthe), Ginger Prince (Fastrada), Rae Norman (Catherine), and Ed Dixon (Charles).

In June 2000, the Paper Mill Playhouse in Milburn, New Jersey, staged a revival with director Robert Johanson, choreographer, set design Michael Anania, costume design by Gene Meyer and Gregg Barnes, lighting design Kirk Bookman, and orchestrations by David Siegel. The cast starred Jim Newman (Lead Player), Ed Dixon (Charlemagne), Jack Noseworthy (Pippin), Natascia Diaz (Catherine), Sara Gettelfinger (Fastrada), Davis Kirby (Lewis), and Charlotte Rae (Berthe).

In 2004, the first major New York revisitation of the show was featured as the second annual World AIDS Day Concert presented by Jamie McGonnigal. It featured Michael Arden as Pippin, Laura Benanti as Catherine, Julia Murney as Fastrada, Terrence Mann as Charlemagne, Charles Busch as Berthe, and the role of the Leading Player was split up among five actors including Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Darius de Haas, Billy Porter, Kate Shindle and a surprise guest appearance by Ben Vereen, making his first New York stage appearance in over a decade.

In 2005, the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, New York, staged a production starring BD Wong (Leading Player), Stephanie Pope (Fastrada), Anastasia Barzee (Catherine) and James Stanek (Pippin). The production ran from August 9, 2005, through September 4, 2005.

East West Players (EWP) produced a diverse and inclusive version of the musical featuring a cast with all artists of color as a part of their 42nd season under the artistic direction of Tim Dang. At the time, &quot;Pippin&quot; was the highest grossing production ever produced by EWP in their 50-year history (later surpassed by &quot;Allegiance&quot; in 2018). Stephen Schwartz had reached out to Tim Dang on multiple occasions prior to the show&#x27;s run, playfully noting that EWP had a penchant for hosting the works of Stephen Sondheim while &quot;never [doing Schwartz&#x27;s] work -- the other SS.&quot; From this interaction, a new version of the musical was conceived.

As with other interpretations of this musical, the music and aesthetics of EWP&#x27;s iteration were a vast departure from the original. Both aspects of the production were heavily inspired by the animated works of Shinichirō Watanabe, who is most well known for his work on the Japanese anime series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; and &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot;; as such, the production incorporated aesthetic aspects of both anime and hip-hop. The set, designed by Alan Muraoka, was constructed in the image of a dance club with characters sporting vibrantly colored costumes and slicked neon hairstyles. Dang saw this blend of cultural elements as a reflection of the youth at the time:A lot of the younger audiences, the younger performers, don&#x27;t want to be defined by race anymore. They&#x27;re not necessarily Asian anymore, or African American or Latino. They&#x27;re this urban, metropolitan, cosmopolitan kind of generation.The show was produced in Los Angeles at the Mark Taper Forum, from January 15, 2009, through March 15, 2009, in a radically different form. The play&#x27;s setting was changed to reflect a modern tone and was subtly modified to include deaf actors using American Sign Language. The production was choreographed and directed by Jeff Calhoun for actors from both the Deaf West Theatre Company and the Center Theatre Group. The title character was played by Tyrone Giordano and was voiced by actor Michael Arden. The Leading Player was played by Ty Taylor. The rest of the cast included Troy Kotsur as Charles (who was voiced by Dan Callaway), Sara Gettelfinger as Fastrada, Harriet Harris as Berthe, and Melissa van der Schyff as Catherine. Nicolas Conway and José F. Lopez Jr. alternated as the role of Theo (and they were voiced by Bryan Terrell Clark). &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that the duality was required by the situation, but effectively showcased the character&#x27;s &quot;lack of a fixed self&quot; in an exciting new fashion.

The Menier Chocolate Factory opened a revival of &quot;Pippin&quot; on November 22, 2011. The cast was made up of Frances Ruffelle, Ian Kelsey, Matt Rawle, Carly Bawden, Ben Bunce, Louise Gold, Bob Harms, Harry Hepple, Holly James, Anabel Kutay, David McMullan, Stuart Neal, David Page, and Kate Tydman. The creative team was led by director/choreographer Mitch Sebastian.

The Kansas City Repertory Theatre produced and performed a version of &quot;Pippin&quot; that opened on September 14, 2012, and closed on October 7, 2012. The score was adapted to reflect a punk-rock style by Curtis Moore. The cast included Wallace Smith as the Leading Player, Claybourne Elder as Pippin, John Hickok as Charles, Katie Kalahurka as Fastrada/Ensemble, Sam Cordes as Lewis, Mary Testa as Berthe, Katie Gilchrist as Catherine/Ensemble, and Utah Boggs as Theo. The ensemble was made up of Jennie Greenberry and Gil Perez-Abraham Jr.

The creative team was headed by Director Eric Rosen, Production Stage Manager Samantha Greene, Music Director/Orchestrator/Arranger Curtis Moore, Choreography Chase Brock, Scenic Design Jack Magaw, Costumes Alison Heryer, Lighting Design Jason Lyons, and Sound Design Zachary Williamson.

A Spanish-language version of &quot;Pippin&quot;, produced by the Lily Alvarez Sierra Company in Caracas, Venezuela, directed by César Sierra, opened on December 12, 2013. The cast featured Ruthsy Fuentes as the Leading Player, Wilfredo Parra as Pippin, Anthony LoRusso as Charlemagne, Marielena González as Fastrada, Orlando Alfonzo and Gerardo Lugo shared the role of Lewis, Violeta Alemán as Berthe, and Rebeca Herrera Martinez as Catherine.

In August 2017, a scaled down production opened at the Hope Mill Theatre in Manchester. It featured a ten-person cast and a scaled down set to focus more on the story. This production transferred in late February 2018 to the Southwark Playhouse in London for a limited run. The production starred Jonathan Carlton as Pippin and Genevieve Nicole as Leading Player.

A Japanese-language version of Pippin, produced by Fuji-Television, Kyodo-Tokyo and Watanabe-Entertainment in Tokyo, directed by Diane Paulus, opened on June 10, 2019. It then commenced a tour in July in Nagaoya, Osaka and Shizuoka. The cast featured Yu Shirota as Pippin, Crystal Kay as the Leading Player, Kiyotaka Imai as Charlemagne, Hiromu Kiriya as Fastrada, Ryosuke Okada as Lewis, Mie Nakao and Beverly Maeda shared the role of Berthe, Emma Miyazawa as Catherine, and Jian Kawai &amp; Seishiro Higurashi shared the role of Theo.

== Film adaptations and recordings ==

=== Cast recordings ===
In 1972, a cast recording of the original Broadway production was released on LP by Motown Records. It was the label&#x27;s first musical cast recording and featured the entire original cast. In 2000, it remastered and released on CD by Decca Broadway. This version featured The Supremes&#x27; cover of &quot;I Guess I&#x27;ll Miss the Man&quot;, The Jackson 5&#x27;s cover of &quot;Corner of the Sky&quot;, and Michael Jackson&#x27;s cover of &quot;Morning Glow&quot; as bonus tracks.

A cast recording was made for the Australian premiere, starring John Farnham and Colleen Hewett in 1973. It was released on LP and later CD by EMI.

The first non-English cast album was made for the 1974 Mexico City production produced by and starring Julissa. Also featured were Hector Ortiz as Pippin, Burt Rodríguez as Leading Player, Guillermo Rivas as Charles, Jacqueline Voltaire as Fastrada, and Anita Blanch as Berthe. The recording was released by Discos Gas on LP in 1974.

A 2013 revival cast recording was released on CD by Ghostlight Records on April 29, 2013. This version included four karaoke tracks as bonus tracks. A competition was held to find 700 fans of the show to sing the section of &quot;No Time at All&quot; where Berthe invites the audience to sing along with her.

Additional cast albums were released for the 1975 Johannesburg production and the 2014 Poznań production. Los Angeles Harbor College also recorded and released a cast album of their production in 1980.

===1981 filmed production===
In 1981, a stage production of &quot;Pippin&quot; was videotaped for Canadian television. The stage production was directed by Kathryn Doby, Bob Fosse&#x27;s dance captain for the original Broadway production, and David Sheehan directed the video. Ben Vereen returned for the role of Leading Player, while William Katt played the role of Pippin. However, this version was a truncated adaptation and several sections of the play were cut. Originally, Catherine sings &quot;I Guess I&#x27;ll Miss the Man&quot; after Pippin departs, but this song does not appear in the video.

The cast included:
* Ben Vereen as Leading Player
* William Katt as Pippin
* Leslie Denniston as Catherine
* Benjamin Rayson as Charlemagne
* Martha Raye as Berthe
* Chita Rivera as Fastrada
* Christopher Chadman as Lewis

===Proposed feature film===
In 2003, Miramax acquired the feature film rights for &quot;Pippin&quot;, following the success of the film adaptation of the musical &quot;Chicago&quot;.

It was announced in April 2013 that The Weinstein Company has set director/screenwriter James Ponsoldt to pen and adapt the film. In December 2014, Craig Zadan announced that his next project with coproducer Neil Meron would be &quot;Pippin&quot;, to be produced for The Weinstein Company. In April 2018, the film rights quietly reverted to Schwartz following The Weinstein Company&#x27;s bankruptcy filing with the project being shopped to other studios.

<text>WFXT (channel 25) is a television station in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, affiliated with the Fox network and owned by Cox Media Group. Its studios are located on Fox Drive (near the Boston-Providence Turnpike) in Dedham, and its transmitter is located on Cabot Street in Needham. WFXT is the largest Fox affiliate by market size that is not owned and operated by the network, although it was previously owned by Fox on two occasions (1987–1990 and 1995–2014).

== History ==

=== Early years (1977–1986) ===
The station first signed on the air on October 10, 1977, as WXNE-TV (standing for &quot;Christ (X) in New England&quot;); originally operating as an independent station, it was founded by the then–Portsmouth, Virginia–based Christian Broadcasting Network. After being awarded a construction permit to build the station from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in June 1972, CBN targeted the new channel 25 to begin operations within one year. However, various delays in obtaining both a studio and transmitter location resulted in a wait of over five years for the station to finally sign-on. WXNE-TV&#x27;s early programming format was targeted at a family audience, consisting of older syndicated reruns and a decent amount of religious programming—including CBN&#x27;s flagship show, &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, hosted by the ministry&#x27;s founder Pat Robertson. Religious programs ran for about six hours a day during the week, and throughout the day on Sundays. The station also carried the daily and Sunday Mass from the Boston Catholic Television Center. Secular programming consisted of westerns, older movies, family-oriented drama series, old film shorts, and classic television series. For several years under CBN ownership, Tim Robertson served as the station&#x27;s program director, appointed by his father, Pat Robertson.

The station began adding more cartoons, made-for-TV movies, and off-network sitcoms and family dramas during the early 1980s. Most notably, in 1980, WXNE took over production of the weekday bowling program &quot;Candlepins for Cash&quot;, which had just been canceled by CBS affiliate WNAC-TV (channel 7, now WHDH) after seven seasons. With new host Rico Petrocelli, the show moved production from WNAC-TV&#x27;s studios, in bowling lanes that were built in the basement of the facility, to the now-defunct Wal-Lex Lanes in Waltham. After only a few months as host, Petrocelli was ousted in favor of the program&#x27;s original host when it aired on WNAC-TV, Bob Gamere, who remained on &quot;Candlepins&quot; until it ended its run on channel 25 in 1983. During this time, the station rebranded itself as &quot;Boston 25&quot;, as it converted into a true independent. While the station was carried only on cable providers in the Greater Boston market, WXNE-TV held a solid third place among the area&#x27;s independent stations, behind the longer-established WSBK-TV (channel 38) and WLVI-TV (channel 56), and sixth in the ratings among the market&#x27;s commercial television stations.

In April 1986, WXNE and the other two CBN-owned stations—KXTX-TV in Dallas and WYAH-TV (now WGNT) in Portsmouth—were put up for sale. That August, News Corporation announced that it would purchase channel 25, with plans to make it an owned-and-operated station of its Fox Broadcasting Company. Fox had been in preliminary negotiations to secure an affiliation with either WSBK or WLVI, but ended its pursuit of both outlets. Until the sale was completed, channel 25, upon the Fox network&#x27;s startup on October 9, 1986, did not air the network&#x27;s inaugural program and what was then its lone offering, &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;, a late-night talk show that aired opposite &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on NBC. The outgoing CBN ownership believed that the program did not fit its strict content guidelines. Fox instead contracted Boston radio station WMRE (1510 AM, now WMEX) to carry the audio portion of &quot;The Late Show&quot; in the interim.

=== As WFXT (1987–present) ===
When the sale to News Corporation was completed on December 31, 1986, WXNE-TV, renamed WFXT on January 19, 1987, became the seventh Fox-owned property and the first to be acquired separately from News Corporation&#x27;s 1986 purchase of Metromedia&#x27;s six television stations that served as the foundation for the new network. Besides adding &quot;The Late Show&quot; to the schedule, airings of &quot;The 700 Club&quot; were cut to once a day, and the daily broadcast of the Roman Catholic Mass was moved to an earlier timeslot. The station also began airing the syndicated, Fox-produced tabloid magazine &quot;A Current Affair&quot; on weeknights; WFXT was the second station, after producing station and Fox flagship WNYW in New York City, to air the program. WXNE staff announcer Chris Clausen had already been let go in late 1986 (promptly joining WNEV-TV in January 1987) in favor of the services of Fox affiliate voiceover Beau Weaver, who would remain with both the station and Fox Television Stations for over a decade. The station&#x27;s schedule, however, was largely unchanged at the outset, aside from the removal of several older sitcoms that soon resurfaced on WQTV (channel 68, now WBPX-TV). The Sunday evening religious program block was finally discontinued on April 5, 1987, when Fox launched its prime time lineup, which initially aired only on Sundays before expanding to Saturdays that July (as such, WFXT is the only Boston television station that has never changed its network affiliation, as it has been with Fox since the network&#x27;s prime time expansion; it wasn&#x27;t until 1993 that Fox had programming on all seven days of the week).

Over the next few years, WFXT, for the most part was unable to acquire the better syndicated programs and continued to only acquire shows that WSBK, WLVI, and the market&#x27;s network affiliates passed on. In addition to Fox programming, most of the shows added to WFXT&#x27;s schedule were low-budget, first-run syndicated programs and cartoons. However, in 1988, the station did manage to buy two popular weekday syndicated shows away from WNEV—&quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; (the then-current John Davidson version) and &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;—when the CBS affiliate phased them off its schedule, due to other programming commitments. WFXT aired &quot;Squares&quot; through its 1989 cancellation; it carried &quot;ET&quot; weeknights at 7 p.m., as the lead-in to &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, until selling the show back to WHDH-TV (the former WNEV) in 1990. WFXT has again aired &quot;ET&quot; since 2015.

==== Sale to the Boston Celtics ====
As the FCC prohibited the common ownership of a television station and a newspaper in the same market, in purchasing channel 25, News Corporation had to apply for and was granted a temporary waiver in order to retain WFXT and the newspaper it had also published, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;. On April 21, 1988, Rupert Murdoch, who had earlier stated his intention to retain the &quot;Herald&quot;, announced that WFXT would be put up for sale. In 1989, Fox proposed placing WFXT in a trust company as it sought to find a buyer willing to meet its $35 million asking price; on April 26, the FCC ruled that the trust would be required to sever all of the station&#x27;s ties to Fox, including the network affiliation. That September, Fox agreed to sell the station to the Boston Celtics&#x27; ownership group for $20 million; the sale was completed on May 11, 1990. As part of the deal, News Corporation was given the opportunity to eventually buy back a 37.5-percent stake in the station. The Celtics made WFXT the NBA team&#x27;s flagship station starting with the 1990–91 season, following the expiration of its existing contract with WLVI-TV. The station also gained a radio sister station, as the Celtics also purchased WEEI (then at 590 AM, now WEZE; now at 850 AM) at the same time.

The Celtics did not have the financial means to compete as a broadcaster. Nonetheless, under Celtics ownership, WFXT finally began to acquire stronger programming, becoming a serious competitor to WSBK and WLVI for the first time. In 1990, among securing the rights to several new, high-profile rerun syndication packages, WFXT managed to buy rights to &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, reruns of which had been airing on WCVB-TV (channel 5) for the past two years. WCVB, which had lost a lot of money airing &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; in weekend blocks only, retained a small portion of the show&#x27;s syndication rights for weekends and occasional airings in prime time (in the event that they chose to preempt an ABC network program). WFXT, meanwhile, began airing &quot;Cosby Show&quot; reruns on weekdays in the fall of 1990; aside from a couple of years off between 1994 and 1996, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; would remain a staple of WFXT&#x27;s schedule for well over a decade.

==== Return to Fox ownership ====
By 1992, WFXT was carried on many cable providers in areas of New England where there was no locally-based Fox affiliate station. Locally, however, the station was still rated in third place (though not as distant as the CBN or early Fox days), behind WSBK and WLVI. Still, for a while under the Celtics&#x27; watch, WFXT was perceived to be in danger of losing its Fox affiliation. As early as March 1993, Fox was again considering the purchase of a Boston television station, even though News Corporation still owned the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, and entered into preliminary discussions with Boston Celtics Communications about reacquiring WFXT; the Celtics subsequently said, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), that Fox had warned the company that it could pull its affiliation from the station if it were to acquire another property in the market. By this point, Fox held a 25-percent convertible interest in WFXT, and indicated it was seeking to expand this interest. That October, Fox obtained a 10-year option to repurchase the station as early as 1995, and immediately announced that it would not seek a waiver to own both channel 25 and the &quot;Herald&quot;; News Corporation sold the newspaper to its publisher, Pat Purcell, in February 1994, clearing the way for a potential purchase of WFXT. The Celtics also moved their games off their own station, shifting the team&#x27;s over-the-air broadcast rights to WSBK-TV in a five-year deal that began with the 1993–94 season; this move followed WFXT&#x27;s increasing difficulty in scheduling Celtics telecasts around the Fox lineup.

WFXT&#x27;s Fox affiliation again came into question in 1994, in the wake of the network&#x27;s affiliation deal with twelve New World Communications stations, when reports emerged that then-CBS affiliate WHDH-TV was considering a switch to Fox. After Westinghouse Broadcasting signed a deal that July to affiliate all of its stations, including WBZ-TV (channel 4), with CBS, WHDH was given the opportunity to choose between Fox and the NBC affiliation being vacated by WBZ; it elected to sign with NBC in August 1994, keeping Fox on WFXT. On October 5, 1994, Fox announced it would exercise its purchase option and buy WFXT. That November, the deal, as well as Fox&#x27;s concurrent purchase of WTXF in Philadelphia, encountered objections from NBC, alleging that Fox&#x27;s interest in SF Broadcasting, in connection with the Boston and Philadelphia purchases, would put Fox over the FCC&#x27;s twelve-station ownership limit; NBC subsequently filed a separate petition concerning Fox&#x27;s ties to the then-Australian-based News Corporation. NBC withdrew its petitions on February 17, 1995, allowing Fox to retake control of channel 25 on July 7.

As the 1990s progressed, WFXT began phasing in more talk and reality programs. It continued running cartoons (including the Fox Kids block) each weekday—later becoming the last station in the market that had run a morning children&#x27;s program block—and sitcoms during the evening hours. WFXT served as the television flagship of the Boston Red Sox for three seasons from 2000 to 2002 (before that and since then, WFXT only carried Red Sox games that were televised by Fox itself, including games from its four World Series victories in 2004, 2007, 2013, and 2018).

In the fall of 2001, WPXT (which served as the over-the-air Fox affiliate for the Portland area since the network launched) disaffiliated from Fox due to a payment dispute between Pegasus Broadcasting (the station&#x27;s owner at the time) and the network. This left Portland and the entire state of Maine without a Fox affiliate until then-Pax TV affiliate WMPX-TV switched to the network in April 2003; during this time, WFXT served as the default Fox affiliate for the New Hampshire side of the Portland market, while Foxnet provided the network&#x27;s programming throughout Maine.

At one point in 2006, the station was &quot;tentatively planning&quot; to carry programming from News Corporation-owned MyNetworkTV (a sister network to Fox) on weekdays from 1 to 3 p.m. if the new network was unable to find an affiliate in the Boston market. On July 21, 2006, News Corporation announced that Derry, New Hampshire–based WZMY-TV (channel 50, now WWJE-DT) would become the market&#x27;s MyNetworkTV affiliate when the network began operations on September 5, 2006. Channel 50 ended its affiliation with MyNetworkTV in September 2011, shortly after changing call letters to WBIN-TV; WSBK (a CBS-owned sister station to WBZ-TV that had shunned the network at its formation) took over the affiliation at that time. Before MyNetworkTV became a programming service consisting solely of reruns, WFXT occasionally promoted that network&#x27;s programming.

On October 12, 2007, Comcast began blacking out Fox prime time and sports programming from WFXT on its systems in Bristol County due to an invocation of the FCC&#x27;s network non-duplication rule by WNAC-TV, the Fox affiliate in Providence, Rhode Island, leaving only channel 25&#x27;s syndicated programs and newscasts available in that area. On July 31, 2008, Charter Communications&#x27; system in Westport also became subject to the blackouts, this contributed to WFXT&#x27;s eventual removal from that system on September 23, 2008.

==== Trade to Cox Media Group ====
On June 24, 2014, Fox announced that it would trade WFXT and Memphis sister station WHBQ-TV to the Cox Media Group, in exchange for the San Francisco duopoly of Fox affiliate KTVU and independent station KICU-TV. The trade was completed on October 8, 2014. Following this deal, CBS-owned WBZ-TV and Telemundo-owned WNEU briefly became the only network O&amp;O stations in the Boston area (prior to the launch of NBC Boston in January 2017), and also made WFXT the largest Fox affiliate not owned by the network (prior to the completion of the swap, KTVU held that title). In November 2014, shortly after the closure of the sale, WFXT was briefly pulled from Verizon FiOS in the Boston area for a week due to a discrepancy in contract negotiations.

On October 27, 2015, WFXT dropped the Fox O&amp;O-style branding and introduced a new logo and on-air appearance; the logo was criticized by some viewers for its simplified appearance—omitting the standard Fox network logo in favor of an italicized Helvetica logotype—and received national attention when Larry Potash, anchor of the &quot;Morning News&quot; on WGN-TV in Chicago, criticized the change as a move by station-hired consultants to help bring in viewers who defected from WFXT&#x27;s newscasts following the departure of longtime evening anchor Maria Stephanos earlier that year (Stephanos would join WCVB-TV in 2016). Prior to Super Bowl LI in February 2017, the station began downplaying the Fox name from its overall branding; this was reflected in a promo that aired prior to and during the game (which itself used the same music, tagline, and overall format as a 2014 image promotion made by Australia&#x27;s Seven Network) that referred to the news operation as &quot;25 News&quot;.

On April 13, 2017, the station announced that it would rebrand its newscasts as &quot;Boston 25 News&quot; on April 24, 2017; from then on, the &quot;Fox 25&quot; branding was retained as a generalized identity restricted to WFXT&#x27;s entertainment programming and station promotions (the move followed a similar split branding structure that Cox Media Group employed when it operated KTVU as a Fox affiliate between 1986 and 2014, in which references to the Fox network were omitted from use within that station&#x27;s local news programs). General manager Tom Raponi told &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that the change was made to eliminate a perception that WFXT&#x27;s newscasts leaned conservative, which the station attributed to an internal survey taken in 2015 in which 41% of Boston area news viewers that were polled associated its newscasts with the national Fox News Channel, rather than its sister broadcast network (as an affiliate of the Fox Broadcasting Company, WFXT&#x27;s only association with Fox News is through a compulsory content arrangement with Fox News Edge, which supplies national and international news footage, and reports from FNC correspondents to Fox stations for potential but not mandatory inclusion in their local newscasts). In February 2018, the station dropped the &quot;Fox 25&quot; branding entirely and began referring to itself as &quot;Boston 25&quot; full time, including in promotions for syndicated and Fox network programming, making WFXT one of only a handful of Fox affiliates that does not use &quot;Fox&quot; in its branding.

====Sale to Apollo Global Management====
In February 2019, it was announced that Apollo Global Management would acquire Cox Media Group and Northwest Broadcasting&#x27;s stations. Although the group planned to operate under the name Terrier Media, it was later announced in June 2019 that Apollo would also acquire Cox&#x27;s radio and advertising businesses, and retain the Cox Media Group name. The sale was completed on December 17, 2019.

====Canceled sale to Standard General====
On February 22, 2022, as part of Standard General&#x27;s acquisition of Tegna Inc., as well as Cox Media Group&#x27;s acquisition of the four Standard Media television stations, along with WFAA, KMPX, KVUE, KHOU and KTBU, Cox announced that it would sell WFXT to an affiliate of Standard General. The deal was canceled on May 22, 2023.

== Programming ==
===Sports programming===
Through the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot;, WFXT typically airs two New England Patriots games a year, usually when the team plays host to an NFC team at Gillette Stadium. However, the institution of the NFL&#x27;s new &#x27;cross-flex&#x27; rules in 2014 (in which Patriots games involving an AFC opponent are moved from WBZ-TV), along with Fox&#x27;s broadcasting rights to &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; starting in 2018, has given the station more opportunities to air regular season Patriots games. The station has aired five of the Patriots&#x27; Super Bowl appearances (XXXI, XXXVI, XXXIX, XLII and LI), including the team&#x27;s championship victories (XXXVI, XXXIX, and LI).

The station also airs any Boston Red Sox games that are part of Fox&#x27;s Major League Baseball telecasts. Owing to Fox&#x27;s exclusive coverage of the World Series since 2000, WFXT has carried every Red Sox championship in the television era (2004, 2007, 2013, and 2018). It also served as the team&#x27;s primary over-the-air broadcaster for three seasons from 2000 to 2002 as the flagship station of the &quot;Fox 25 Red Sox Television Network&quot;. WFXT also carried a package of weekday afternoon Red Sox spring training games, produced by NESN, in 2018 and 2019. As mentioned above, it carried Celtics games under the team&#x27;s ownership in the early 1990s.

When Fox held the NHL&#x27;s U.S. over-the-air broadcast contract from 1995 to 1999, any games involving the Boston Bruins that were selected to air on the &quot;NHL on Fox&quot; were aired on WFXT.

=== News operation ===
WFXT presently broadcasts 64 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 10 hours each weekday, 5 hours on Saturdays and 6 hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to locally produced newscasts, it was the largest newscast output of any station in the Boston market and in New England until January 1, 2017, when WHDH-TV lost their NBC affiliation and became a news-intensive independent outlet by increasing their weekly news output to over 70 hours. During weather segments, the station utilizes live National Weather Service radar data originating from a radar site at the NWS Weather Forecast Office in Norton.

One of the few productive moves that WFXT made under the ownership of the Boston Celtics was entering into a news share agreement with regional cable news channel New England Cable News (NECN) to produce a prime time newscast at 10 p.m., which debuted on September 7, 1993. The half-hour &quot;Fox 25 News at 10&quot; was initially anchored by Heather Kahn, with Tim Kelley on weather. Kahn lasted a year in this role before she was hired by ABC affiliate WCVB-TV (channel 5); Lila Orbach replaced her as anchor. In September 1994, NECN began to produce a half-hour midday newscast at 12:30 p.m. for channel 25, which was subsequently canceled.

In September 1995, WFXT announced that the contract with NECN would not be renewed, with the final broadcast airing on October 1. The next day, NECN moved the newscast to WSBK, which was more willing to commit to a longer-term deal with the channel, as channel 25 was planning to eventually replace the NECN production with its own news operation. For the next year, the only news programming on WFXT consisted primarily of national updates supplied by Fox News that aired during the day. During this time, Fox Television Stations created an in-house news department for the station, culminating on September 9, 1996, with the launch of a new 10 p.m. broadcast, initially branded as &quot;Fox News Boston&quot; before reviving the &quot;Fox 25 News&quot; title the following year. The 10 p.m. newscast has aired as an hour-long program since its inception, originally airing in the format on Monday through Saturday nights, while the Sunday edition aired for a half-hour in order to accommodate a sports highlight program, &quot;Sports Sunday on Fox&quot;; &quot;Sports Sunday&quot; ended its run on May 16, 2004, with the Sunday edition of the 10 p.m. newscast expanding to an hour the following week.

Over the next decade, channel 25 gradually expanded its news operation. On June 4, 2001, WFXT added a 4:30 p.m. newscast (making it the first Fox-owned station to have produced a newscast during the 4 p.m. hour) that was anchored by Jodi Applegate and was targeted at a female audience. By September 2002, the program had moved to 5 p.m., and on September 22, 2003, it was expanded to an hour and began using the same anchors and a similar format as the 10 p.m. broadcast, as Applegate became co-anchor, along with former WHDH-TV sports director Gene Lavanchy, of a three-hour weekday morning newscast from 6 to 9 a.m. that launched the same day. One year later, Applegate left WFXT to become co-anchor of &quot;Good Day New York&quot; on then-sister station WNYW and was replaced by former WHDH and WBZ-TV anchor Kim Carrigan. Concurrent with the debut of the morning newscast, WFXT unveiled a newsroom similar to that of WHDH, which also serves as the station&#x27;s news set; it remains in use to this day. Channel 25 also opened a news bureau on Beacon Hill near the State House in downtown Boston, which serves as an interview location for Massachusetts lawmakers as well as a home base for weekday morning commentator Doug &quot;V.B.&quot; Goudie.

The station debuted an hour-long Sunday morning newscast at 9 a.m. on September 12, 2004; the program was canceled in July 2009. On May 19, 2009, WFXT and the CBS-owned duopoly of WBZ-TV/WSBK-TV entered into a Local News Service agreement, which allows the stations to share local news footage, along with a helicopter for traffic reports and breaking news. The helicopter originally used as part of the sharing agreement (which WFXT and WBZ/WSBK stopped using in 2013) was involved in a crash that killed two people in Seattle on March 18, 2014, while on loan by Helicopters, Inc. for use by KOMO-TV during technical upgrades to that station&#x27;s own helicopter. On June 14, 2009, starting with its 10 p.m. newscast, WFXT became the last station in the Boston market at the time to begin broadcasting its newscasts in high definition (NBC owned-and-operated station WBTS-LD signed on in HD on January 1, 2017).

WFXT launched a Sunday through Friday 11 p.m. newscast on November 5, 2007; the weekday morning newscast has also expanded since its launch, and has aired from 4 to 10 a.m. since July 9, 2012. The 5 p.m. newscast, which consistently placed fourth in its timeslot, was discontinued in favor of a half-hour 6 p.m. newscast on September 14, 2009. That program was expanded to one hour with the launch of an additional half-hour newscast at 6:30 p.m. on March 14, 2011, which competes against the national network newscasts airing in the timeslot on WBZ, WHDH and WCVB. On July 7, 2012, WFXT expanded the 6 p.m. newscast to Saturday and Sunday evenings; as is common with Fox stations that carry early evening newscasts on weekends, the newscast may be subject to delay or preemption due to network sports telecasts overrunning into the timeslot. On October 7, 2013, WFXT relaunched its 5 p.m. newscast after a four-year hiatus.

Under Cox ownership, a number of significant changes began to occur within WFXT&#x27;s news department. On November 13, 2014, Doug Goudie, who was well known for his commentary segments during the station&#x27;s morning show, was released from the station; he stated that his presence did not align with Cox&#x27;s &quot;philosophy&quot;, since they &quot;aren&#x27;t big on opinions.&quot; The removal of &quot;V.B.&quot; came as part of a retooling of the &quot;Morning News&quot; into a conventional newscast, rather than a morning show emphasizing light talk and interview segments (such as Goudie&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Hitters&quot;). The station restored the weekend morning newscasts in September 2015. The station would also focus less on hard news in favor of a slightly softer format with an abundance of human interest stories, which the station&#x27;s website termed as &quot;uplifting&quot; stories.

In September 2021, the station laid off several staffers, including sports director Tom Leyden, as part of a series of cuts that also saw the cancellation of WFXT&#x27;s 4 p.m. newscast (which had launched in 2016) and its Saturday evening newscasts. The cuts followed a period, following Apollo Global Management&#x27;s acquisition of Cox Media Group, of reduced investment in the station (with an unnamed staffer telling the &quot;Boston Business Journal&quot; that half of the station&#x27;s staff had turned over since 2019), as well as a cyberattack against Cox that June.

WFXT airs half-hour &quot;In Depth&quot; news specials at 10:30 p.m. on Fridays. These are compilations of special reports often unified by a single theme.

== Technical information ==
=== Subchannels ===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

The Fox subchannel is offered in ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) format from the transmitter of WUNI.
=== Analog-to-digital conversion ===
WFXT&#x27;s analog signal began malfunctioning on November 1, 2008, as a result of a failing transmission line, forcing the station to reduce its power. By December 9, 2008, the transmission line had deteriorated to the point that the station&#x27;s effective radiated power was reduced to levels where viewers could then only receive the station via cable, satellite or its digital signal in most areas. The station then began to state that the possibility existed that its analog signal might have to be shut down ahead of the analog-to-digital transition deadline for full-power stations, which at that time was scheduled for February 17, 2009. In the end, the station&#x27;s analog signal remained on the air even after that date (a result of the transition being delayed to June 12, 2009). However, due to the continued failure of the transmission line (to the extent that the station estimated its analog signal was only reaching 3% of its former coverage area, with no signal at all at the station&#x27;s Dedham studios), WFXT shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 25, on February 27, 2009, becoming the second English-language major network station in Boston to exclusively transmit a digital signal (WZMY terminated its analog signal in December 2008) and the only Fox-owned station to shut down its analog signal prior to the new June 12 transition date. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 31, using virtual channel 25.

Many Boston area residents complained about poor reception from WFXT&#x27;s digital signal compared to the market&#x27;s other major television stations. This was due to the fact that the transmitter previously operated at a reduced power output of 78 kilowatts from an antenna mounted below one of the tines of the Candelabra tower in Needham. WFXT&#x27;s vice president of engineering Bill Holbrook stated publicly that the digital signal would not reach full power until August 2009, when installation of a new antenna and transmitter was expected to be completed. However, the signal upgrades were completed in April 2009, giving WFXT a signal considered to be on par with the Boston market&#x27;s other full-power stations. The new antenna and transmission feedline had been replaced two weeks earlier. The license to cover was filed on April 23, 2009.

<text>250px|thumb|Historic Marker which reads:
Gila River Indian Reservation was a reservation established in 1859 by the United States government in New Mexico Territory, to set aside the lands of the Akimel O’odham (Pima) and the Piipaash (Maricopa) people along the Gila River, in what is now Pinal County, Arizona. The self-government of the reservation as the Gila River Indian Community was established by Congress in 1939.

==History==
The Pima Villages and some of their lands were included in the Gila River Indian Reservation in 1859. An Indian Agency was established at Casa Blanca with Silas St. John, (station agent of the Butterfield Overland Mail at Casa Blanca Station), appointed on February 18, 1859, as Special Agent for the Pima and Maricopa Indians. Agent St. John also conducted a census of the villages later that year.

<text>Bishan Singh Bedi (25 September 1946 – 23 October 2023) was an Indian cricketer who was primarily a slow left-arm orthodox bowler. He played Test cricket for India from 1966 to 1979 and formed part of the famous Indian spin quartet. He played a total of 67 Tests and took 266 wickets. He also captained the national side in 22 Test matches. Bedi wore a colourful patka and was always known for his outspoken and forthright views on cricketing matters. He was awarded the Padma Shri award in 1970 and the C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004.

== Playing career ==
In Indian domestic cricket, Bedi first played for Northern Punjab when only fifteen, having taken up cricket only two years previously, a particularly late age for this sport. He moved to Delhi in 1968–69 and in the 1974–75 season of the Ranji Trophy, he took a record 64 wickets. Bedi also represented Northamptonshire in English county cricket for many years. He finished his career with 1560 wickets in first-class cricket — more than any other Indian cricketer.

His bowling has been described as graceful, even beautiful, and full of guile and artistry. He was an expert in flighting the ball, and was capable of making it hold back or hurry forward and added subtle variations of spin. His action was so relaxed and coordinated that he was able to bowl all day with rhythm and control, a great asset to any captain. He had several very successful Test series:
* India vs Australia 1969–70: 21 wickets at the average of 20.57
* India vs England 1972–73: 25 wickets at the average of 25.28
* India in the West Indies 1975–1976 : 18 wickets at the average of 25.33
* India vs New Zealand 1976–77: 22 wickets at the average of 13.18
* India vs England 1976–77: 25 wickets at the average of 22.96
* India in Australia 1977–78: 31 wickets at the average of 23.87

His best Test bowling was 7/98 against Australia at Calcutta in 1969–70, and his best match figures 10/194 at Perth in 1977–78, also against Australia. His best first class bowling was 7/5 for Delhi vs Jammu and Kashmir at New Delhi 1974–75. Although his batting was poor he hit a boundary off the second last ball in the Gillette Cup Semi Final for Northamptonshire vs Hampshire, winning the match by two wickets. His highest score of 50 not out, his only half century at Test level, was scored against New Zealand in Kanpur in 1976.

Bedi was appointed captain of India in 1976, succeeding Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi. His first Test victory as captain was against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in the 3rd Test of the 1976 series in which India scored a then-record 406 in the fourth innings. This was followed up by a 2–0 series victory over New Zealand at home. However, after successive Test series losses to England (3–1 at home), Australia (3–2 away) and Pakistan (2–0 away), he was replaced as captain by Sunil Gavaskar in 1979.

Bedi is second to Lance Gibbs in terms of maiden overs per test, 16.35 against 16.62. He bowled 4.2 maiden overs per wicket as against 4.24 by Gibbs.

In 2008, Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack named Bedi as one of the five best cricketers to have not been selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.

== Controversies ==
As captain of India, Bedi was involved in some controversies. Following India&#x27;s record-breaking run-chase in the 3rd Test of the 1976 series against the West Indies, the West Indies opted for an aggressive four-man fast bowler attack for the 4th Test. Bedi objected to their tactics of bowling beamers because they could not get Indian batsmen out, and declared the Indian first innings closed early after two players were forced to retire hurt. Subsequently, five players were absent hurt in the second innings of the match.

In England&#x27;s tour of India in 1976–77 he accused John Lever of using Vaseline to illegally polish the ball in the Third Test at Madras. Lever wore Vaseline strips on his forehead to keep the sweat out of his eyes; he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing.

In November 1978, he became the first captain to concede an international cricket match. In a One Day International against Pakistan at Sahiwal (Pakistan), India with 8 wickets in hand, required 23 runs from 14 balls. Bedi, however, recalled the batsmen from the crease and conceded the match in protest at the bowling of Sarfraz Nawaz who had bowled 4 bouncers in succession with not one being called wide by the umpires.

=== Coaching ===
In 1990, after he had managed a tour where India had played poorly, he threatened to dump the entire team in the sea on the return journey.

=== Opinions on modern-day cricket ===
Bedi expressed strong opinions on many aspects of modern-day cricket and was described as &quot;being jealous of modern-day great spinners&quot;. In particular, he was a vehement critic of the bowling action of Muttiah Muralitharan (&quot;if Murali doesn&#x27;t chuck, then show me how to bowl&quot;) which he bluntly referred to as cheating and likened to a javelin throw and shot putting, saying that Muralitharan would &quot;complete 1000 Test wickets but they would count as mere run-outs in my eyes&quot;. He took a very dim view of chucking, which he called &quot;a bigger threat than bribing and betting&quot; and claimed in 2004 that many bowlers on the subcontinent chuck, calling Muralitharan a &quot;Sri Lankan bandit closing in on a dream artist called Shane Warne&quot;. He had stated, though, that he has nothing personal against Muralitharan, although Muralitharan had threatened to sue him. He levelled the same criticisms against his countryman Harbhajan Singh. Regarding suspect actions in cricket, he said &quot;When a bowler is chucking, he&#x27;s referred to panels and the home cricket board. Why not do the same for a wide or no-ball, then?&quot;. He had accused one-day cricket, modern cricket bats and small grounds of causing a decline in classical spin bowling in India.

Bedi also attacked Sunil Gavaskar, calling him &quot;a destructive influence&quot;. He said to Australian coach John Buchanan &quot;Tell us, John, have you made this Australian team great, or have they made you?&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
Bedi was born on 25 September 1946, in Amritsar in then British India.

His son Angad Bedi (born 1983) is an Indian actor and former model, and his daughter-in-law Neha Dhupia is a well known Bollywood actress.

He said that he had always washed his own clothes, calling it &quot;the best exercise for your shoulders and fingers&quot;, when pointing out that spin bowling requires suppleness of limbs.

Bedi died in New Delhi on 23 October 2023, at the age of 77.

==Records==
Bedi held the world record for the most economical bowling figures in a 60-over ODI match amongst the bowlers who had completed their quota of overs (12 overs). In the 1975 World Cup, when the bowlers were allowed to deliver 12 overs, Bedi finished with 12–8–6–1 (overs-maidens-runs-wickets) against East Africa at Headingley.

==Accolades==
Bedi was awarded the Padma Shri in 1970.

In 2004, Bedi, along with Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Srinivas Venkatraghavan and Erapalli Prasanna, collectively known as the Indian spin quartet, were named as winners of the C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

<doc id="899519" wikidata="Q2381771" url="?curid=899519" title="American Public Media">
<text>American Public Media (APM) is an American company that produces and distributes public radio programs in the United States, the second largest company of its type after NPR. Its non-profit parent, American Public Media Group, also owns and operates radio stations in Minnesota and California. Its station brands include Minnesota Public Radio and Southern California Public Radio. Based in St. Paul, Minnesota, APM is best known for distribution of the national financial news program &quot;Marketplace&quot;.

== Historical ties to Public Radio International ==
Formerly, much of American Public Media&#x27;s programming content was distributed by Public Radio International, which itself was named &quot;American Public Radio&quot;, or APR, until July 1, 1994. APR was formed by four stations—the Minnesota Public Radio network, WGBH in Boston, WNYC in New York, and KUSC in Los Angeles—to distribute &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;. PRI owns and produces numerous programs today, but still also distributes diverse programming from many sources. In contrast, APM, which was founded in 2004, predominantly distributes content that it owns and produces itself; exceptions include &quot;The Story with Dick Gordon&quot; (which ended production in October 2013), the distribution to US stations of the BBC World Service, and the BBC Proms broadcasts from Royal Albert Hall in London.

The split happened as MPR and PRI began seeing each other more as potential competitors after MPR lost the partnership to WGBH to produce &quot;The World&quot;, and MPR purchased PRI-distributed &quot;Marketplace&quot; for its own distribution channels.

== APM Reports==
APM Reports is the investigative journalism unit of APM, based in St. Paul, Minnesota. Established in November 2015, APM Reports&#x27; journalists are drawn from Minnesota Public Radio and the former American RadioWorks. It produces documentary as well as investigative journalism. In 2019, APM Reports journalists Madeleine Baran and Samara Freemark received a Polk Award for season 2 of &quot;In the Dark&quot;, their investigation into the case of Curtis Flowers, who was tried six times for a quadruple murder in Winona, Mississippi in 1996. This was the first Polk Award given to a podcast. The &quot;In the Dark&quot; journalists also won two Peabody Awards, in 2016 and 2020, for the first and second seasons of &quot;In the Dark&quot;. In 2023, the APM Reports educational team, with journalist Emily Hanford, won a Edward R. Murrow Award (Radio Television Digital News Association) for &quot;Sold a Story: How Teaching Kids to Read Went So Wrong&quot;.

== APM Research Lab ==
APM Research Lab is the research and data journalism unit of American Public Media. The Lab was established in 2017 under the leadership of American Public Media Group&#x27;s CEO Jon McTaggart and EVP Dave Kansas with the hiring of its inaugural Managing Partner, Craig Helmstetter. The Lab was created to further strengthen APM&#x27;s commitment to factual information as indicated by the tagline &quot;bringing facts into focus.&quot; The unit has conducted several research projects in collaboration with newsrooms within the American Public Media Group and beyond, including partnerships with Marketplace, Minnesota Public Radio News, and PBS/Frontline and the Texas Newsroom.

In 2020 the Lab began publishing a project called Color of Coronavirus that tracks deaths due to COVID-19 by race and ethnicity in each U.S. state as well as the nation as a whole. This project has been cited hundreds of times, including by The Guardian, The Atlantic, Newsweek, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Journal of the American Medical Association.

==Classical South Florida==
Until July 2015, APM operated Classical South Florida (WMLV-FM 89.7), which was sold to Educational Media Foundation, a California-based religious broadcasting company that airs contemporary Christian music; it now brands itself as a K-Love station.

== Programs distributed==
APM also distributes:
* &quot;BBC World Service&quot;
* &quot;Classical 24&quot;
* &quot;Composers Datebook&quot;
* &quot;The Daily&quot;
* &quot;Marketplace&quot; and companion programs

* &quot;On Point&quot;
* &quot;Performance Today&quot;
* &quot;Pipedreams&quot;
* &quot;The Splendid Table&quot;
* &quot;SymphonyCast&quot;
Several specials are also distributed by APM on a less frequent basis, including a number of Christmas programs, &quot;Giving Thanks&quot; at Thanksgiving, and the &quot;BBC Proms&quot;.

== People ==
* Madeleine Baran, host and lead reporter of &quot;In The Dark&quot;
* Lynne Rossetto Kasper, former host of &quot;The Splendid Table&quot;
*Francis Lam, host of &quot;The Splendid Table&quot;

<doc id="899524" wikidata="Q3519811" url="?curid=899524" title="Lala Amarnath">
<text>Lala Amarnath Bhardwaj (11 September 1911 – 5 August 2000) was an Indian cricketer. He is considered to be the father figure of Indian cricket. He scored the first ever century for India in Test Cricket in 1933. He was independent India&#x27;s first cricket captain and captained India in their first Test series win against Pakistan in 1952.

He played only three Test Matches before World War II (India played no official Test matches during the war). During this time he amassed around 10,000 runs with 30 hundreds in first-class cricket which included teams from Australia and England. After the war, he played another 21 Test Matches for India. He later became the chairman of the Senior Selection Committee, BCCI and was also a commentator and expert. His proteges include Chandu Borde, M.L. Jaisimha, and Jasu Patel who played for India. His sons Surinder and Mohinder Amarnath also became Test players for India. His grandson Digvijay is also a current first-class player. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1991. Amarnath received the inaugural C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, the highest honour bestowed by BCCI on a former player.

==Early life==

Amarnath was born in an impoverished Punjabi-speaking Brahmin family of Kapurthala, Punjab. Recognizing his talent in Lahore, a Muslim cricketing household adopted Amarnath. He played his debut match against England in 1933 on the Bombay Gymkhana grounds in South Bombay. Amarnath also played for the Hindus in the Bombay Quadrangular. Aside from being a batsman, Lala Amarnath was also a bowler, the only one to dismiss Donald Bradman hit wicket.

==Test career ==

In 1933&#x27;s England&#x27;s tour of India, Lala Amarnath was leading run-scorer. In the series he created history by scoring first ever Test 100 by an Indian batsman at Bombay.

Amarnath was controversially sent back from the 1936 tour of England by the captain, the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram, for &quot;indiscipline&quot;. Amarnath and others allege it was due to politics. Vizzy, the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram, was named the captain for Indian cricket team for the 1936 tour of England, a post that he secured after lobbying and manipulation. Some of the senior players in the squad, including Lala Amarnath, C. K. Nayudu and Vijay Merchant, were critical of Vizzy&#x27;s playing abilities and captaincy, and the team was split between those who supported and criticised the captain. During India&#x27;s match against Minor Counties at Lord&#x27;s Lala Amarnath had been nursing a back injury during the game. Vizzy had Amarnath&#x27;s pad up but did not put him in to bat as a succession of other batsmen were sent in ahead of him, which prevented Amarnath from resting his injury. Amarnath was finally put in to bat at the end of the day. Visibly angry after returning to the dressing room, he threw his kit into his bag and muttered in Punjabi, &quot;I know what is transpiring&quot;. Vizzy took this as an affront and conspired with team manager Major Jack Brittain-Jones to have Lala Amarnath sent back from the tour without playing the first test match. It is also alleged that in the first test against the England, Vizzy offered Mushtaq Ali a gold watch to run out Vijay Merchant.

==Captain and manager==

Lala Amarnath was the captain of the Indian team that toured Australia in 1947-1948. When the Partition of India took place in August 1947, Amarnath and his family had to flee the city to escape a Muslim mob. He lived in Patiala in the Indian state of Punjab till 1957, when he moved to the capital, Delhi. Lala Amarnath had received his education at Aligarh Muslim University. Amarnath is widely respected for reaching out to bridge the divide between players and fans of India and Pakistan, caused by political tensions between the two countries. Under his leadership, India won its first-ever Test against Pakistan in Delhi in 1952 and went on to win the series 2–1. Amarnath also managed the team when it toured Pakistan in 1954-55.

==Family and legacy==

His sons Mohinder and Surinder also played cricket for India and another son Rajinder played first-class cricket while his grandson Digvijay is also a first-class player. Throughout his twilight years, Amarnath was considered a living legend of Indian cricket.

Mohinder played the role of his father in the 2021 sports drama &quot;83&quot;, while Mohinder himself was portrayed by Saqib Saleem. Both of them had previously shared screen space in the 2016 action comedy &quot;Dishoom&quot;.

<doc id="899530" wikidata="Q7059435" url="?curid=899530" title="Northgate, Seattle">
<text>Northgate is a neighborhood in north Seattle, Washington, named for and surrounding Northgate Mall, the first covered mall in the United States.
Its north-south principal arterials are Roosevelt Way NE and Aurora Avenue N (SR 99), and its east-west principal arterials are NE Northgate Way and 130th Street. Minor arterials are College Way-Meridian Avenue N, 1st, 5th, and 15th avenues NE. Interstate 5 runs through the district. Besides the eponymous mall, the most characteristic distinctions of the area are North Seattle College (NSC) and the south fork of the Thornton Creek watershed and Seattle Kraken Iceplex center.

==History==
===Prehistory===

What is now Northgate has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE—10,000 years ago). The &quot;Dkhw’Duw’Absh&quot;, People of the Inside and &quot;Xacuabš&quot;, People of the Large Lake, Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish native people had used the &quot;Liq&#x27;tid&quot; Springs area as a spiritual health spa. They harvested cranberries from the &quot;Slo’q `qed&quot; (&quot;SLOQ-qed&quot;, bald head), an 85 acre (34 ha) marsh and bog at what is now the NSCC car park, Interstate 5 interchange, and Northgate Mall. Large open areas for game habitat and foraging (anthropogenic grasslands) were maintained in what are now these neighborhoods by selective burning every few years. Today the Native American descendants are represented by the Duwamish tribe.

===Development===

The Northgate area has been subject to a large amount of residential and commercial development in the last few years, and many huge projects are underway. The height limits in the area have been increased to 85&#x27; to allow for further population growth.

In 2009 the Northgate Mall was remodeled and added dozens more retail shops. In 2006, a new park, library, and community center opened in the Northgate neighborhood across 5th Ave NE from Northgate Mall. These are part of the city&#x27;s plan to accelerate development in Northgate.

While there is much commerce in the area, hotel development has been limited with only the Hotel Nexus, previously a Ramada Inn, being the only upscale hotel in the area. The many motels lining Aurora Avenue are further northwest than the Northgate neighborhood.

Dense mixed-use development is expected to be constructed adjacent to Northgate station on Link light rail, which opened in October 2021 as the terminus of the Northgate Link Extension. Northgate is also home to the headquarters and team practice facility of the Seattle Kraken which began play in October 2021.

==Neighborhoods==
Northgate neighborhoods are (north to south):
* Haller Lake
* Pinehurst
* Licton Springs or North College Park
* Maple Leaf

==Places of Interest==
The Idriss Mosque in Pinehurst has architecture unique to Seattle. An octagonal dome and a symbolic minaret, both sheathed in copper and capped with crescent moons, red brick walls banded with buff brick and tall glass-block windows topped with concrete lintels in the shape of Moorish arches distinguish the first mosque in Seattle (1981) and the first mosque west of the Mississippi River to be built in a Middle Eastern design.

==Mall==

The Northgate Mall, opened in 1950, is the oldest, first regional historic shopping center called a mall, though there are 3 other shopping centers in the United States which predate it. At the time of its opening, it was located outside of the Seattle city limits, though this is no longer the case. It is located in the Maple Leaf neighborhood of Northgate.

Surrounding Northgate Mall are many strip malls and the &quot;Northgate North&quot; shopping center which features a Best Buy and a two-story Target.

<text>In philately a reprint is a new printing of a postage stamp from the original plates. A reprint is to be distinguished from a new print which is not printed from the original medium. A reprint may or may not be valid as postage.

== Background ==
While it is common for a postal service to order print-runs as stocks are diminished by the public, it is also the usual practice to only use a given design for a small period of time so as to discourage forgery, and then to destroy the printing plates.

Sometimes the authorities keep the plates on hand, and reuse them later. The reasons have included:
* Problems with a new design, resulting in a sudden need for additional stamps
* Additional copies for stamp collectors
* Souvenirs for stamp shows, government meetings, etc. (these are often printed on cards rather than stamp paper)

== Identifying reprints ==
As reprints are produced from the original plates, it can be very difficult to distinguish them from the original printing. Frequently subtle details matter, such the type of paper, type of gum, or color shades. Reprints often appear fresh and bright compared to the originals.

== Official reprints ==
In a few cases, the postal authorities have produced official reproductions, copies of an existing design created on new plates. A notable example of this occurred in 1875 in the United States, where all stamps issued to date were reproduced or reprinted with the intention of making them more readily available to collectors. (The actual numbers printed were small, and so most of the reissues are now rarer and more expensive than the originals they resemble.) In 1962, to prevent people profiting from the issue of an invert stamp error, the United States Post Office Department intentionally reprinted 40,270,000 copies the yellow Dag Hammarskjöld invert stamp.

== Unofficial reprints ==
Unofficial or illegitimate reprints also exist, being produced by private printers who were contracted to print stamps, but retained the plates for their own use. The classic example is the Seebeck reprints of Latin American stamps produced in great numbers around the end of the 19th century.

<doc id="899539" wikidata="Q7437332" url="?curid=899539" title="Scott Styris">
<text>Scott Bernardo Styris (born 10 July 1975) is a New Zealand cricket commentator and former cricketer, who played all formats of the game. An allrounder, Styris played as an aggressive right-handed middle order batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler. Styris was a member of the New Zealand team that won the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy.

Educated at Fairfield Intermediate and Hamilton Boys&#x27; High School, Styris has represented Auckland and Northern Districts since 1994/95. Styris has played for Hamilton in the Hawke Cup.

==Domestic career==
Domestically Styris played for Northern Districts and for Auckland

In 2005 he signed with Middlesex and stayed with them for the 2006 season as well where he deputised for the country captain Ben Hutton in several matches. He received his county cap during the 2006 season. He signed a 2-month contract at Durham County Cricket Club from 1 June 2007. He was bought to play for the IPL 2009 champions Deccan Chargers, which is a Hyderabad based Indian Premier League franchise. In 2010 Styris played for Essex County Cricket Club in the Friends Provident t20 competition and returned to the club for the 2011 season. In 2012 while playing for Sussex County Cricket Club, Styris scored the equal third-fastest T20 century (37 balls) in the quarter finals of the 2012 Friends Life t20 competition. It won the 2012 Walter Lawrence Trophy.

==International career==
Styris made his debut for New Zealand in a One Day International at Rajkot in 1999/2000. His maiden wicket was that of Sachin Tendulkar, one of 3 wickets for the match.

He had to wait until mid-2002 to play his first Test Match, against the West Indies at Grenada. His debut had almost come at Karachi 2 months earlier but the match was abandoned due to bomb blasts near the team hotel. In the Test at Grenada he batted at number 8 and top scored with 107. When it was New Zealand&#x27;s time to bowl Styris came on and took 2 for 88. The first of his wickets was that of Brian Lara which gave him impressive maiden scalps in both formats of the game. He made an unbeaten 69 in the second innings to complete a dream debut but missed out on the man of the match award which went to Chris Gayle who scored a double hundred.

In the ODI series after the Tests he continued his form but this time with the ball, taking 6 for 25 at Trinidad. This broke the record for best One Day International bowling figures by a New Zealander. At Mohali in 2003/04 against India he scored his second Test hundred with 119, one of 4 New Zealander&#x27;s to make a century in the innings. Soon after he made his career best Test score of 170 against South Africa in Auckland, his innings taking just 220 balls.

In June 2004 New Zealand toured England and Styris impressed at Nottingham, making 108. He scored his fifth Test hundred at Auckland against the West Indies, an unbeaten 103 helping his side to win the Test. When New Zealand chased what was then an ODI record of 322 in 2005/06 against Australia at Christchurch, Styris contributed 101.
He then suffered a back injury missed out on the Sri Lanka series of December 2006. Making his return in the latter stages of the Commonwealth Bank series in Australia and then in the Chappell Hadlee series at home, Styris had done enough to be included New Zealand&#x27;s World Cup squad.

Styris started the tournament with the man of the match award in a win over England at St Lucia. Chasing 210 for victory, Styris made an unbeaten 87 to guide his side home. His pugnacious batting style and distinctive gait led to former England captain Nasser Hussain referring to him as a &quot;street fighter&quot; from the commentary booth during the game.
He made another half century in the game against Kenya and made 80 not out in a successful run chase against the home side. In the Super Eight stage the New Zealanders played Sri Lanka and Styris top-scored with 111 not out. The century came off 152 balls. It was his second ever World Cup century; he scored one in 2003.

Shortly after the world cup Styris&#x27; form dropped of contributing to injuries and not enough practice due to the injuries. He then participated in a test series against South Africa in 2007 but was dropped from the test squad.

He then continued to participate in ODI&#x27;s and took part when the English cricket team were touring New Zealand in January to February 2008 and the Subsequent Return tour he participated well in both series with the bat but not much with the ball.

Styris, aged 35 and competing for a competitive medium pace all-rounder slot with Grant Elliott, was selected for the Tri-series in Sri Lanka August 2010 he scored 88 runs in the first ODI. He completed his comeback by showing a bowling performance in the next match against Sri Lanka when he took the wicket of Kumar Sangakkara However, after the tournament he suffered a back stress fracture during training and missed the series against Bangladesh and India.

== Personal life ==
In 2010, Styris married former Miss New Zealand runner-up and former trampolinist Nicky Styris (née Walker). She went on to become TV3/Newshub sports presenter.

<text>201 Penelope is a large main belt asteroid that was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa on August 7, 1879, in Pola. The asteroid is named after Penelope, the wife of Odysseus in Homer&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. It is orbiting the Sun at a distance of with an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.18 and a period of . The orbital plane is tilted at an angle of 5.8° to the plane of the ecliptic.

Based upon the spectra of this object, it is classified as a M-type asteroid, indicating it may be metallic in composition. It may be the remnant of the core of a larger, differentiated asteroid. Near infrared absorption features indicate the presence of variable amounts of low-iron, low-calcium orthopyroxenes on the surface. Trace amounts of water is detected with a mass fraction of about 0.13–0.15 wt%. It has an estimated size of around 88 km. With a rotation period of 3.74 hours, it is the fastest rotating asteroid larger than 50 km in diameter.

<doc id="899541" wikidata="Q1145315" url="?curid=899541" title="Flaying">
<text>Flaying is a method of slow and painful torture and/or execution in which skin is removed from the body. Generally, an attempt is made to keep the removed portion of skin intact.

==Scope==
A dead animal may be flayed when preparing it to be used as human food, or for its hide or fur. This is more commonly called skinning.

Flaying of humans is used as a method of torture or execution, depending on how much of the skin is removed. This is often referred to as flaying alive. There are also records of people flayed after death, generally as a means of debasing the corpse of a prominent enemy or criminal, sometimes related to religious beliefs (e.g., to deny an afterlife); sometimes the skin is used, again for deterrence, esoteric/ritualistic purposes, etc. (e.g., scalping).

==Causes of death==
Dermatologist Ernst G. Jung notes that the typical causes of death due to flaying are shock, critical loss of blood or other body fluids, hypothermia, or infections, and that the actual death is estimated to occur from a few hours up to a few days after the flaying. Hypothermia is possible, as skin provides natural insulation and is essential for maintaining body temperature.

==History==

=== Assyrian tradition ===

Ernst G. Jung, in his &quot;Kleine Kulturgeschichte der Haut&quot; (&quot;A short cultural history of the skin&quot;), provides an essay in which he outlines the Neo-Assyrian tradition of flaying human beings. Already from the times of Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883–859 BC), the practice is displayed and commemorated in both carvings and official royal edicts. The carvings show that the actual flaying process might begin at various places on the body, such as at the crus (lower leg), the thighs, or the buttocks.

In their royal edicts, the Neo-Assyrian kings seem to gloat over the terrible fate they imposed upon their captives, and that flaying seems, in particular, to be the fate meted out to rebel leaders. Jung provides some examples of this triumphant rhetoric. From Ashurnasirpal II:

The Rassam cylinder in the British Museum describes this: 

=== Other examples ===
Searing or cutting the flesh from the body was sometimes used as part of the public execution of traitors in medieval Europe. A similar mode of execution was used as late as the early 18th century in France; one such episode is graphically recounted in the opening chapter of Michel Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; (1979).

In 1303, the treasury of Westminster Abbey was robbed while holding a large sum of money belonging to King Edward I. After the arrest and interrogation of 48 monks, three of them, including the subprior and sacrist, were found guilty of the robbery and flayed. Their skin was attached to three doors as a warning against robbers of church and state. At St Michael &amp; All Angels Church in Copford in Essex, England, it is claimed that human skin was found attached to an old door, though evidence seems elusive.

In Chinese history, Sun Hao, Fu Sheng and Gao Heng were known for removing skin from people&#x27;s faces. The Hongwu Emperor flayed many servants, officials and rebels. Hai Rui suggested that his emperor flay corrupt officials. The Zhengde Emperor flayed six rebels, and Zhang Xianzhong also flayed many people. Lu Xun said the Ming dynasty was begun and ended by flaying.

==Examples and depictions of flayings==
===Artistic===

* One of the plastinated exhibits in Body Worlds includes an entire posthumously flayed skin, and many of the other exhibits have had their skin removed.

===Mythological===
* In Greek mythology, Marsyas, a satyr, was flayed alive after losing a musical contest to Apollo.
* Also according to Greek mythology, Aloeus is said to have had his wife flayed.
* The Giant Asterius was flayed alive by the goddess Athena.
* In Aztec mythology, Xipe Totec is the flayed god of death and rebirth. Captured enemy warriors were flayed annually as sacrifices to him.

===Historical===
* According to Herodotus, Sisamnes, a corrupt judge under Cambyses II of Persia, was flayed for accepting a bribe. 
* The Talmud discusses how Rabbi Akiva was flayed alive by the Romans for publicly teaching the Torah.
* Catholic and Orthodox tradition holds that Saint Bartholomew was flayed before being crucified.
* In 202 AD, Saint Charalambos was reportedly tortured mercilessly aged 113 during the reign of Septimius Severus. The torturers lacerated his body with iron hooks and scraped all the skin from his body.
*In 260 AD, the Roman emperor Valerian was seized during a parley by Shapur I, king of Persia, at Edessa. According to some accounts he was flayed alive.
* Mani, founding prophet of Manichaeism, was said to have been flayed or beheaded (c. 275).
* Vasak Mamikonyan, commander-in-chief of the Armenian army during the reign of Arshak II, king of Armenia, was flayed alive on the order of Shapur II, after he, along with Arsaces, was captured and imprisoned by the Persian king. His skin was then filled with hay and put before Arsaces to further mock and psychologically torture the imprisoned Armenian king. (c. 367).
* Totila is said to have ordered the bishop of Perugia, Herculanus, to be flayed when he captured that city in 549.
* In 991 AD, during a Viking raid in England, a Danish Viking is said to have been flayed by London locals for ransacking a church. Alleged human skin found on a local church door has, for many years, been considered as proof for this legend, but a deeper analysis made during the production of the 2001 BBC documentary, &quot;Blood of the Vikings&quot;, came to the conclusion that the preserved skin came from a cow hide and was part of a 19th-century hoax.
* Pierre Basile was flayed alive and all defenders of the chateau hanged on 6 April 1199, by order of the mercenary leader Mercadier, for shooting and killing King Richard I of England with a crossbow at the siege of Châlus, in March 1199.
* In 1314, the brothers Aunay, who were lovers of the daughters-in-law of king Philip IV of France, were flayed alive, then castrated and beheaded, and their bodies were exposed on a gibbet (&quot;Tour de Nesle Affair&quot;). The extreme severity of their punishment was due to the &quot;lèse majesté&quot; nature of the crime. 
* In 1323, the Mexica tribe asked for Yaocihuatl, daughter of Achicometl, ruler of Culhuacan in marriage. Unknown to him, she was sacrificed, with the priest appearing during the festival dinner wearing her skin as part of the ritual.
* In 1404 or 1417, the Hurufi Imad ud-Din Nesîmî, an Islamic poet of Turkic extraction, was flayed alive, apparently on orders of a Timurid governor, and for heresy.
*In 1490, Krokodeilas Kladas who led a revolt in the Morea was flayed alive by the Ottomans when caught in battle.
*In August 1571, Marco Antonio Bragadin, a defeated Venetian commander, was flayed to death by the Ottomans, causing enormous outrage in Venice and perhaps inspiring Titian&#x27;s &quot;Flaying of Marsyas&quot;.
* In September 1611, Dionysios the Philosopher (or Dionysios Skylosophos) was flayed alive by the Ottomans after a failed revolt in Ioannina. His skin was filled with hay and was paraded.
*In 1657, the Polish Jesuit martyr, Andrew Bobola, was burned, half strangled, partly flayed alive, and killed by a sabre stroke by Eastern Orthodox Cossacks.
* In 1771, Daskalogiannis, a Cretan rebel against the Ottoman Empire, was flayed alive, and it is said that he suffered in dignified silence.
* In the United States, Nat Turner, leader of a rebellion against slavery in Virginia, was hanged on November 11, 1831. His body was then flayed, his skin being used to make purses as souvenirs.
* In Marcel Ophuls&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Hôtel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie&quot;, the daughter of a French Resistance leader claims her father was tortured, including being flayed, by Klaus Barbie during his time at Lyon in 1942–1944.
* In 1957, a victim of Ed Gein was found &quot;dressed out like a deer&quot;. Gein appears to have been influenced by the then-current stories about the Nazis collecting body parts in order to make lampshades and other items. His story fueled the inspiration of the fictional characters Norman Bates (in &quot;Psycho&quot;), Jame Gumb &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; (&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;), and Leatherface (&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;).
* On June 23, 2023, a video was uploaded to the Internet by Cártel Del Noreste, which depicted a rival cartel member having his entire head flayed, his tongue pulled out of his throat, and heart being ripped out of his chest. The video, which is known as the &quot;Zacatecas Flaying&quot; or &quot;Red Skull&quot; video, was first uploaded to WhatsApp, before later being reupload to sites like Twitter and Reddit.

<text>Andre the Giant Has a Posse is a street art campaign based on a design by Shepard Fairey created in 1989 while Shepard attended the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island. Distributed by the skater community and graffiti artists, the stickers featuring an image of André the Giant began showing up in many cities across the United States. At the time, Fairey declared the campaign to be &quot;an experiment in phenomenology&quot;. Over time, the artwork has been reused in a number of ways and has become worldwide. Fairey also altered the work stylistically and semantically into OBEY Giant.

==History==

Fairey and fellow Rhode Island School of Design student Ryan Lesser, along with Blaize Blouin, Alfred Hawkins and Mike Mongo created paper and vinyl stickers and posters with an image of the wrestler André the Giant and the text &quot;ANDRE THE GIANT HAS A POSSE 7′ 4″, 520 lb&quot;, (&quot;7′ 4″, 520 lbs&quot;—2.24 m, 236 kg—famously being Andre the Giant&#x27;s billed height and weight) as an in-joke directed at hip hop and subculture, and then began clandestinely and aggressively propagating and posting them in Providence, Rhode Island, and over the rest of the Eastern United States.

In an interview with &quot;Format&quot; magazine in 2008, Fairey said: &quot;The Andre the Giant sticker was just a spontaneous, happy accident. I was teaching a friend how to make stencils in the summer of 1989, and I looked for a picture to use in the newspaper, and there just happened to be an ad for wrestling with André the Giant and I told him that he should make a stencil of it. He said &#x27;Nah, I’m not making a stencil of that, that’s stupid!&#x27; but I thought it was funny so I made the stencil and I made a few stickers and the group of guys I was hanging out with always called each other The Posse, so it said Andre the Giant Has a Posse, and it was sort of appropriated from hip-hop slang – Public Enemy, N.W.A and Ice-T were all using the word.&quot;

By the early 1990s, tens of thousands of paper and then vinyl stickers were photocopied and hand-silkscreened and put in visible places throughout the world.

&quot;Andre the Giant Has a Posse&quot; is also the title of a 1995 documentary short by Helen Stickler, which was the first documentary to feature Shepard Fairey and chronicle his influential street art campaign. The film screened worldwide, most notably in the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. In 2003, Village Voice film critic Ed Halter described the film as: &quot;legendary&quot; and &quot;a canonical study of a Gen-X media manipulation. One of the keenest examinations of &#x27;90s underground culture&quot;.

The threat of a lawsuit from Titan Sports, Inc. in 1994 spurred Fairey to stop using the trademarked name André the Giant, and to create a more iconic image of the wrestler&#x27;s face, now most often with the equally iconic branding OBEY. The &quot;OBEY&quot; slogan was not only a parody of propaganda, but also a direct homage to the &quot;OBEY&quot; signs found in the cult film, &quot;They Live&quot; (1988), starring Roddy Piper. About &quot;OBEY&quot;, &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; art critic Robert L. Pincus said: &quot;[Fairey&#x27;s work] was a reaction against earlier political art, since it delivered no clear message. Still, &#x27;Obey&#x27; was suggestively antiauthoritarian.&quot; &quot;Following the example set by gallery art, some street art is more about the concept than the art,&quot; writes &quot;The Walrus&quot; contributor Nick Mount. &quot;&#x27;Fuck Bush&#x27; isn’t an aesthetic; it’s an ethic. Shepard Fairey’s Obey Giant stickers and Akay&#x27;s Akayism posters are clever children of Duchamp, ironic conceptual art.&quot;

== Appropriation and fair use ==
Graphic designer Baxter Orr did his own take on Fairey&#x27;s work: a piece called Protect, with the iconic Obey Giant face covered by a SARS (respiratory) mask. He started selling prints, marked as his own work, through his website. On April 23, 2008, Orr received a signed cease-and-desist order from Fairey&#x27;s attorneys, telling him to pull Protect from sale because they alleged it violated Fairey&#x27;s trademark. Fairey threatened to sue, calling the designer a &quot;bottom feeder&quot; and &quot;parasite&quot;.

==Parodies==
The original &quot;Andre the Giant Has a Posse&quot; sticker format has been widely imitated for humorous effect over many years. In these parody stickers, the image of André the Giant has been replaced with a similarly stylized black-and-white photo of some other person or character, along with the new figure&#x27;s height and weight.

For example, the parody sticker &quot;Tattoo the Midget Has a Bigger Posse&quot; features the image of Hervé Villechaize portraying the character Tattoo from &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. Colin Purrington&#x27;s &quot;Charles Darwin Has a Posse&quot; stickers, featuring a black-and-white photo of Charles Darwin, promote the theory of evolution. During the 2000 presidential campaign in the United States, &quot;Ralph Nader Has a Posse&quot; showed up on college campuses. Numerous other parody stickers can be found featuring different popular culture figures, including the &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; character Strong Mad.

These parody stickers are a further extension of the original &quot;joke&quot;, and thus are most likely to be found in locations where the original André the Giant iconography is already familiar, such as SoHo, Manhattan, or South Street, Philadelphia. An unusual occurrence of a parody sticker was at the particle physics laboratory Fermilab where the director of the lab, Pier Oddone, was the subject of the sticker.

Tenacious D produced stickers with the slogan &quot;Obey the D&quot; and stylized images of their members, Jack Black and Kyle Gass, over their initials. Guitar Hero II features a &quot;Vlad Has a Posse&quot; sticker on various loading screens throughout the game. Electronic Frontier Foundation created a sticker with the words &quot;Fair Use Has a Posse&quot; on it. &quot;Joey Deacon Has a Posse&quot; parody stencils have appeared in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Jack Has a Posse&quot; stickers have appeared in the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego, California, in July 2011 during the Esri International User Conference held at the nearby San Diego Convention Center. The stickers carry an image of US businessman Jack Dangermond, founder of Esri.

ThinkGeek produced a T-shirt with the slogan &quot;Fezzik Has a Posse&quot; in March 2012, in reference to André the Giant&#x27;s role as Fezzik in the movie &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987) and the &quot;Andre the Giant Has a Posse&quot; street art campaign.

The cover of the April 2017 issue of Harper&#x27;s Magazine features a photo of a protester with a sign parodying the &quot;Obey&quot; poster with a stylized portrait of President Donald Trump and the slogan &quot;Disobey&quot;.

<doc id="899548" wikidata="Q8007204" url="?curid=899548" title="William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple">
<text>William Francis Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple, PC (13 December 1811 – 16 October 1888), known as William Cowper (pronounced &quot;Cooper&quot;) before 1869 and as William Cowper-Temple between 1869 and 1880, was a British Liberal statesman.

==Background and education==
Born at Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, Cowper was the second son of Peter Cowper, 5th Earl Cowper, and the Hon. Emily Lamb (since his mother had several lovers there is some doubt about his true paternity). He was the younger brother of George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper and nephew of Prime Minister Lord Melbourne. His father died in 1837 and in 1839 his mother married another prime minister, Lord Palmerston, who became Cowper&#x27;s stepfather. He was educated at Eton. After entering the Royal Horse Guards in 1830, he was promoted Captain five years later, eventually attaining the rank of brevet Major in 1852.

==Political career==
In 1835, Cowper was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Hertford, a seat he held for the next thirty-three years, and became private secretary to his uncle Prime Minister Lord Melbourne. He was appointed a Groom in Waiting in 1837, and in 1841 served for three months as a Lord of the Treasury under Melbourne, only resuming office five years later as a Lord of the Admiralty when the Whigs returned to power under Lord John Russell. He again held this post under Lord Aberdeen from 1852 to 1855, and in the latter year was made Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department by his stepfather Lord Palmerston when he became prime minister. In August that same year he was appointed President of the Board of Health, and sworn of the Privy Council. Four years later he became Vice-President of the Board of Trade and Paymaster General, only serving for a year before Palmerston appointed him First Commissioner of Works.

In 1866, on the fall of Lord Russell&#x27;s government, Cowper left office for good. Two years later he was returned to Parliament for Hampshire South, and held this seat until 1880.

Cowper-Temple was involved in the 1870 Education Act which set up Board Schools (state primary schools, run by elected local school boards) throughout England. He was responsible for the Cowper-Temple clause, an amendment which became Section 14 of the Act. In order to overcome the concerns of Nonconformists that their children might be taught Anglican doctrine, the clause proposed that religious teaching in the new state schools be non-denominational, which in practice meant learning the Bible and a few hymns. Section 7 of the Act also gave parents the right to withdraw their children from any religious instruction provided in board schools, and to withdraw their children at that or other times to attend any other religious instruction of their choice.

When his mother died in 1869, he inherited a number of estates under his stepfather&#x27;s will, and so took that year under Royal licence the additional surname of Temple. The properties included a 10,000-acre estate on Sligo&#x27;s Mullaghmore peninsula with its unfinished Classiebawn Castle, commissioned by his stepfather, which he completed by 1874. In 1880 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Mount Temple, of Mount Temple in the County of Sligo. This was a revival of the junior title held by the Viscounts Palmerston, which had become extinct along with the viscountcy on his stepfather&#x27;s death in 1865.

Apart from his political career Lord Mount Temple organized ecumenical conferences at Broadlands. One of the regular speakers there was George MacDonald.

==Personal life==

Lord Mount Temple was twice married. He married first Harriet Alicia, daughter of Daniel Gurney, in 1843. After her early death the same year, he married second, in 1848, Georgina Tollemache, daughter of Admiral John Richard Delap Tollemache, and a sister of the 1st Baron Tollemache. Both marriages were childless. He died on 16 October 1888, aged 76, at his home of Broadlands, Hampshire, and was buried at nearby Romsey. His peerage became extinct on his death. Lady Mount Temple died in October 1901, aged 79.

His estates (excluding Shelley House, Chelsea, lived in and inherited by his wife) had already passed to or were inherited by his nephew, the Rt. Hon. Evelyn Ashley, the second son of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. His probate was sworn the next year at ; and his wife&#x27;s in 1903 at £8863.

==Legacy==
The Canadian Pacific passenger SS Mount Temple, launched in 1901, was named for him. The British rock band The Cooper Temple Clause were also named after him.

<doc id="899552" wikidata="Q37808" url="?curid=899552" title="Fila Brasileiro">
<text>The Fila Brasileiro () is a Brazilian breed of large working dog of mastiff type.

It is used as a guard dog, for cattle herding and for big-game hunting; it may also be kept as a companion dog or pet. In the eighteenth century, when slavery was still legal in Brazil, the Fila Brasileiro was used to return escaped slaves to their owners.

== Etymology ==
The verb &quot;filar&quot; in Portuguese literally means &quot;to hold, arrest, grab&quot;. So &quot;cão de fila&quot; (fila dog) or &quot;cão de filar&quot; suggests that it is a catch dog, a dog that &quot;bites and does not loosen its grip&quot;. A similar name is also found in two Portuguese dog breeds: the Cão de Fila de São Miguel and the extinct Cão de Fila da Terceira.

==History==
The Fila Brasileiro is thought to descend from European dogs brought to Brazil during the Colonial period, with little or no influence from indigenous South American dogs from the Pre-Cabraline era.

The Fila Brasileiro were bred and raised primarily on large plantations and cattle farms where they originated. In addition to cattle, jaguars, and other animals, these dogs were taught to chase down fugitive slaves.

The first written standard of the breed was edited in 1946. The Paulistas were responsible for organizing a planned breeding program and opening a stud book to register dogs. Dr. Paulo Santos Cruz began to systematically breed the Fila Brasileiro and also contributed to setting the CAFIB standard.

== Appearance ==

In Brazil the breed has two main standards imposed by two distinct clubs, the Confederação Brasileira de Cinofilia, affiliated to FCI, and the Clube de Aprimoramento do Fila Brasileiro. The CAFIB standard was constructed based on the ancient phenotype of the breed. But the current CBKC/FCI standard is the best known internationally.

The Fila Brasileiro is a breed of mastiff with large bones and loose skin. According to the international breed standard, dogs should stand between at the withers and weigh no less than ; bitches are slightly smaller, standing some and weighing at least . They have a rectangular build and though they are massive, their natural agility is apparent. The head is big and heavy with a deep muzzle. The ears are large, thick, tapered and either droop or fold back exposing the interior, depending on the dog&#x27;s mood. The neck and back are well muscled and the chest is broad and deep. Unlike the vast majority of canines, the croup is higher than the withers. The legs are heavily boned. The skin is very distinctive of the breed, as it is thick and loose all over the body, mainly in the region around the neck. The thick skin forms pronounced dewlaps. In many individuals, the dewlaps proceed to the chest and abdomen. Some dogs show a fold at the side of the head and also at the withers descending to the shoulders. The coat is short and dense and the texture is normally smooth and soft. Their colours vary from solid, brindle, mouse-grey, patched, dappled, or black and tan. They are almost never white. Typical colours are fawn, black and brindle. Brindles of a basic color may have the stripes of either less or with very strong intensity. Sometimes a black mask is present.

The coat of the Fila Brasileiro is smooth and short. Black, fawns (red, apricot, or dark), and brindled (fawn, black, or brown brindle) colors are permitted, except mouse-grey, black and tan, blue, dappled and solid white. White markings, not exceeding 1/4 of the coat surface area, are permitted on the feet, the chest and the tip of the tail in the FCI standard.

The CAFIB standard does not accept black, mouse-grey, black and tan, blue, or dappled coats, as it considers them as a sign of crossbreeding; on the other hand, it accepts dogs with large white markings on any part of the body.

== Standards==
In Brazil, the Fila Brasileiro can be bred within three different standards proposed by three separate clubs. The standard imposed by the CBKC (a club affiliated to the FCI) is the most popular in the world, but it is by far the most distant from the appearance of the old dogs of four decades ago.

The other two standards are from CAFIB (Fila Brasileiro&#x27;s Enhancement Club) and AMFIBRA (World Association of Dog Breeders of Fila Brasileiro), respectively. Both are based on the first breed standard elaborated by Paulo Santos Cruz, the man who is considered the &quot;father of the breed&quot;. However, the CAFIB standard is the most popular of the two. But both clubs (CAFIB and AMFIBRA) present themselves with the aim to preserve the pure Fila with the closest appearance of the old dogs.

This big difference between the three standards is mainly due to an accusation of a scandal of crossbreeding at the dogs registered by the CBKC in the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s and, consequently, the many changes made in the CBKC standard probable to include dogs with characteristics of foreign breeds, such as the English Mastiff, Great Dane and Neapolitan Mastiff.

Paulo Santos Cruz himself, who even participated in the formation of the CAFIB for these same reasons and even presided over the club, published an article in 1979 explaining how to differentiate a pure Fila from a mixed one.

==Legal status==

In Fiji, the United Kingdom, Norway, Australia, Hong Kong and Cyprus, it is illegal to own any of these dogs without specific exemption from a court. In Turkey, it is illegal to own and breed a Fila Brasileiro. It is automatically classified as a dangerous dog in Trinidad and Tobago, meaning they cannot be imported and males must be neutered.

<doc id="899553" wikidata="Q7105749" url="?curid=899553" title="Osborn, Ohio">
<text>Osborn was a town located near the Haddix Road-Ohio 235 intersection at the northern edge of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in what is now the flood-prone basin of the Huffman Dam in the U.S. state of Ohio.

Osborn was named after the superintendent of the railroad named E.F. Osborn. The previously unnamed town allowed the railroad to be built through it after the nearby town of Fairfield refused the plan of the railway to go through there. Nearly the entire town of Osborn, along with the railroad, were relocated two miles away during construction of the Huffman dam to a site east of and adjacent to Fairfield, Ohio, in 1921. This was necessary because of the Miami Valley Flood Control Project and the Miami Conservancy District that was begun after the Great Dayton Flood (Dayton, Ohio) of March 1913.

Many of the original houses of old Osborn still stand in Fairborn, Ohio, in the &quot;Osborn Historic District&quot;. On January 1, 1950, Osborn and the neighboring town of Fairfield were merged as Fairborn. The first business to depict the name of the new city was the large vertical sign of the Fairborn Theatre.

The old Osborn cemetery lies within the boundary of Wright-Patterson, near the north end of the main flight line, which used to be part of the town. During the building of the longer runway to accommodate the large B-36 Bombers in the 1940s, the old streets of Osborn were still visible on the ground near the airstrip.

<doc id="899555" wikidata="Q7271259" url="?curid=899555" title="Quentin Durgens, M.P.">
<text>Quentin Durgens, M.P. is a Canadian dramatic television series, which aired on CBC Television from 1965 to 1969. It was one of the first hour-long drama series produced by the CBC, and helped to establish Gordon Pinsent as a major star in Canada. Created by George Robertson, the series first aired in 1965 under the title Mr. Member of Parliament, as a short-run series within the CBC&#x27;s drama anthology &quot;The Serial&quot;. It was spun off into a standalone series and retitled &quot;Quentin Durgens, M.P.&quot; in its second season.

== Plot ==

Set in Ottawa, Ontario and the fictional community of Moose Falls, the series starred Pinsent as Quentin Durgens, an idealistic young lawyer who wins election as a Member of Parliament, succeeding his father in a by-election after his father&#x27;s death in office. Durgens was a backbench member of the governing party in the House of Commons, but had a maverick streak and aspired to do the right thing even if it wasn&#x27;t politically expedient. Some of the storylines within the series were fictionalized depictions of real-life events in Canadian politics, and the series incorporated some documentary filmmaking techniques inspired by the National Film Board.

== Production ==
Alan Macnaughton, the retiring Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, and David Vivian Currie, the incumbent Sergeant-at-Arms, served as script consultants to ensure that Canadian political process was accurately depicted.

The series was frequently compared in the Canadian press to &quot;Slattery&#x27;s People&quot;, an American series about a state legislator which aired on CBS in the 1964–65 season.

The cast also included Suzanne Lévesque, Budd Knapp, Cec Linder, Ovila Légaré and Chris Wiggins.

<doc id="899563" wikidata="Q1284465" url="?curid=899563" title="Charles Conder">
<text>Charles Edward Conder (24 October 1868 – 9 February 1909) was an English-born painter, lithographer and designer. He emigrated to Australia and was a key figure in the Heidelberg School, arguably the beginning of a distinctively Australian tradition in Western art.

==Biography==
===Birth and early years===
Conder was born in Tottenham, Middlesex, the second son, of six children, of James Conder, civil engineer and Mary Ann Ayres. He spent several years as a young child in India until the death of his mother (aged 31 years) on 14 May 1873 in Bombay, when Charles was four; he was then sent back to England and attended a number of schools including a boarding school at Eastbourne, which he attended from 1877. He left school at 15, and his very religious, non-artistic father, against Charles&#x27;s natural artistic inclinations, decided that he should follow in his footsteps as a civil engineer.

===Australia===
In 1884, at the age of 16, he was sent to Sydney, Australia, where he worked for his uncle, a land surveyor for the New South Wales government. However he disliked the work, much preferring to draw the landscape rather than survey it. In 1886, he left the job and became an artist for the &quot;Illustrated Sydney News&quot;, where he was in the company of other artists such as Albert Henry Fullwood, Frank Mahony and Benjamin Edwin Minns. He also joined the Art Society of New South Wales, attended the painting classes of Alfred James Daplyn, and went on &quot;plein air&quot; painting excursions with Julian Ashton.

Regarded as perhaps his greatest Sydney painting, &quot;Departure of the Orient – Circular Quay&quot; (1888) was the culmination of Conder&#x27;s new mastery of form and brushwork. A dockside scene, it depicts the bustling harbour and ferry berths at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove at the moment when the &quot;Orient&quot; has cast off for her voyage to England. It was quickly purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, making it the first of Conder&#x27;s works to enter a public collection.

====Heidelberg School====
In Sydney in 1888, Conder met and painted with &quot;plein airist&quot; Tom Roberts, then visiting from Melbourne. Later that year, Conder moved to Melbourne to join Roberts and his circle of friends, including painter Arthur Streeton. The trio shared studios and frequently painted together &quot;en plein air&quot; at artists&#x27; camps in rural localities around Melbourne, first at Box Hill and, from late 1888, in Heidelberg. They came to be regarded as the core members of the Heidelberg School movement. 
In August 1889, Conder, Streeton, Roberts, Frederick McCubbin and Charles Douglas Richardson staged the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition in Melbourne, establishing themselves as exponents of an Australian variant of impressionism. Conder contributed 46 &quot;impressions&quot; to the show and designed the Symbolist and Art Nouveau-inspired catalogue.

Short of cash, the attractive Conder apparently paid off his landlady by sexual means, catching syphilis in the process, which was to plague the later years of his life. During his two years in Melbourne, Conder produced a number of famous Heidelberg School works, including &quot;Under The Southern Sun&quot;. This painting clearly shows the burning sunlight and desolation that can be inflicted by an Australian drought. While other Heidelberg School artists, born and raised in Australia, imbued many of their works with nationalist sentiments, Conder, a believer in the credo of art for art&#x27;s sake, instead tended to focus on everyday scenes and the pursuit of leisure.
In Melbourne, Conder rekindled his association with G. P. Nerli, an itinerant Italian painter and the bearer of new European influences who has been credited with shaping Conder&#x27;s development. The extent of the influence has been debated, but the fact of it is undeniable. Like Conder, Nerli was a bon-vivant whose appreciation of the &#x27;dam fine&#x27; &#x27;Melbourne girls&#x27; survives in a letter to a mutual friend, Percy Spence.

Conder was a fun-loving man who painted with an often humorous touch. While staying with Tom Roberts in his famous Grosvenor Chambers studio, he painted &quot;A holiday at Mentone&quot; (1888), which shows men and women at the beach relaxing while clothed from head to foot–the men in suits and hats; the ladies in long, girdled dresses with boots and pretty hats. The man and woman at the front of the painting face away from each other, yet possibly are interested in each other, each watching the other from the corner of their eye. The mood is one of simple elegance and with a relaxed feel, as in the background people are strolling along the beach into the distance. The composition of the painting has possibly been borrowed from a work by Whistler in which a bridge similarly transects the picture.

During his Melbourne residence, Conder stayed with Roberts at his Grosvenor Chambers studio, then moved into Gordon Chambers with Streeton and Richardson. In March 1890, in the lead up to the Victorian Artists&#x27; Society&#x27;s Winter exhibition, the trio staged a show at their Gordon Chambers studio, featuring Heidelberg and &quot;up country&quot; landscapes.

===European avant-garde===

Conder left Australia in 1890, and spent the rest of his life in Europe, at first in Britain, then France for extended periods. He moved to Paris and studied at the Académie Julian, where he befriended several avant-garde artists, including Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who painted his portrait and featured him in at least two of his Moulin Rouge works. Conder became linked to the aesthetic movement, mixing with the likes of Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley. He was also the subject of portraits by William Rothenstein, William Orpen, Jacques-Emile Blanche and Augustus John.

In 1895, Conder designed a room within the art gallery Maison de l&#x27;Art Nouveau, which opened that year in Paris. Later in 1895, he visited Dieppe, socialising among the artistic community and the English families with their attractive daughters, as described by Simona Pakenham in her study of the English people there in the century before World War I. His friends remembered him as &quot; a sick man, unable to face reality&quot;. In spite of drunken spells, disreputable company and sporadic output, Conder&#x27;s powers as an artist won him acclaim. He made a specialty of painting on silk, relatively easy on silk fans, but he excelled on one occasion when he painted a series of white silk gowns worn by Alexandra Thaulow, wife of Norwegian painter Frits Thaulow, while she stood on a table, the gowns becoming &quot;coloured like a field of flowers&quot;. One of his painted fans inspired &quot;The Sanguine Fan&quot;, a 1917 ballet by Edward Elgar.

In Dieppe, Conder met Aubrey Beardsley, but they did not like each other. He continued to paint, but his output was severely affected by the continual poor health, including paralysis and a bout of delirium tremens.

He married a wealthy widow, Stella Maris Belford (née MacAdams) at The British Embassy Paris on 5 December 1901, giving him financial security. His later works are not nearly as well regarded critically as his earlier Australian paintings.

===Later life and death===

He spent the last year of his life in a sanatorium, and died in Holloway Sanatorium of &quot;general paresis of the insane&quot;, in modern terms tertiary syphilis. In death, Conder&#x27;s work was rated highly by many notable artists, such as Pissarro and Degas.

The Canberra suburb of Conder, established in 1991, was named after him. Satirist Barry Humphries was a major aficionado and collector of the artist, and at one time had the world&#x27;s largest private collection of Conder&#x27;s work.

<text>KPBS (channel 15) is a PBS member television station in San Diego, California, United States. Owned by San Diego State University (SDSU) as part of KPBS Public Media, it is a sister station to NPR member KPBS-FM (89.5). The two outlets share studios at the Conrad Prebys Media Complex at Copley Center on Campanile Drive on the SDSU campus. The TV station&#x27;s transmitter is located on San Miguel Mountain in southwestern San Diego County.

==History==
In 1960, San Diego State College (now San Diego State University) applied for a license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate a non-commercial educational television station to serve San Diego. The station first signed on the air on June 12, 1967, as KEBS-TV. The station was originally a member of National Educational Television (NET) before becoming a member of PBS when it launched in October 1970, at which time the station changed its call letters to KPBS-TV. Despite the calls, which mimic the callsign schemes used by stations owned by ABC, NBC, and CBS in New York City and Los Angeles, it is not an owned-and-operated station (nor is similarly-named WPBS in Watertown, New York), as PBS cannot own or operate any of its member stations or regional member networks due to the service&#x27;s local and non-profit nature. The KPBS call sign reflects the station&#x27;s affiliation and programming, but not any special status within PBS.

KPBS started broadcasting digital television on November 21, 2001. On June 12, 2009, the station turned off its analog signal over UHF channel 15 in accordance with the federal mandate for transitioning television broadcast from analog to digital. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 30. 

On January 1, 2011, when Los Angeles&#x27; longtime PBS station KCET ended its membership, KPBS began to be carried on cable providers in the Bakersfield market, alongside fellow PBS stations KVCR-DT in San Bernardino and KVPT in Fresno. It is also one of three PBS member stations that serve the Palm Springs market, alongside KVCR-DT and KOCE-TV in Huntington Beach (which succeeded KCET as Los Angeles&#x27; primary PBS member station).

By the middle of the 2010s, KPBS experienced budgetary constraints and erosion of viewership. The locally produced current affairs show &quot;Full Focus&quot; attracted less than one percent of the potential audience. One of the ways to increase viewership was to increase the number of subchannels as other public TV stations had done.

On March 26, 2019, the digital signal has been moved to UHF channel 19 as a result of spectrum reallocation. 

==News programming==
KPBS produces a nightly half-hour news program on weeknights titled &quot;KPBS Evening Edition&quot;, a self-contained television newscast that is an extension of the &quot;Midday Edition&quot; newscast aired by its radio sister. KPBS&#x27; news department is editorially independent from the station&#x27;s management, San Diego State University and corporate underwriters and donors. The station&#x27;s investigative reports are conducted in collaboration with the nonprofit newsgathering organization Investigative Newsource, which shares a newsroom with KPBS television and radio at the Campanile Drive studios.

The station collaborates on breaking news coverage and shares news video with the local ABC affiliate KGTV (channel 10).

==Subchannels==
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
The initial lineup consisted of two multiplexed channels: the main high definition channel in 720p and the standard definition channel in 480i, the latter used for DTV simulcast of analog channel 15. In 2006, an SD sub-channel was added, carrying content from Create. That same year, the main HD channel was switched from 720p to 1080i. Later that year, KPBS dropped the simulcast of analog channel 15 and implemented statistical multiplexing.

In 2007, KPBS replaced Create with V-me, a 24/7 Spanish-language public television channel.

In January 2017, V-me ended its multicast service for public television, transitioning to commercial cable. KPBS, along with many other PBS affiliates, replaced V-me with the PBS Kids multicast channel. KPBS relaunched Create subchannel and added one more subchannel, KPBS2. John Decker, director of programming at KPBS in San Diego, explained that multicasts such as PBS Kids, Create, World, and locally developed programming &quot;give public TV an opportunity to increase value and thus loyalty among viewers&quot; as well as &quot;allow KPBS to expand its universe&quot;.

Simultaneously with the 2017 lineup change, KPBS switched its HD format from 1080i to 720p and changed aspect ratio of SD channels from 4:3 to 16:9. Image quality degradation, caused by sharing of available bandwidth over four multiplexed channels, was noticed by viewers.

<text>Wojeck is a Canadian dramatic television series, which aired on CBC Television from 1966 to 1968. It was arguably the first successful drama series on English Canadian television, and was the first TV series anywhere to regularly feature and focus on forensic pathology in the investigation of crime. Consequently, &quot;Wojeck&quot; has been hailed as an early forerunner of several successful shows that later explored the same genre, including &quot;The Expert&quot; (1968–76), &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; (1976–83), &quot;&quot; (2000–15), and &quot;Bones&quot; (2005–2017), among many others.

The de facto pilot for the show, produced in Canada by the CBC and featuring the entire cast of the series, aired as an episode of &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot; titled &quot;Tell Them the Streets Are Dancing&quot; (broadcast March 17, 1966).

== Characters and plot==
Similar to &quot;Route 66&quot; or &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Wojeck&quot; followed the &quot;semi-anthology&quot; format of often building the stories around the guest actors, rather than the regular cast. Still, the main four characters are at the centre of the show overall, and Wojeck&#x27;s investigations generally drive the stories forward.

* Dr. Stefan &quot;Steve&quot; Wojeck is a crusading Toronto coroner who regularly fights moral injustices raised by the deaths he investigates. He often tackles tough and controversial issues. The character is Catholic, with Polish heritage.

* Steve&#x27;s wife Marty Wojeck is frequently his sounding board at home. A former nurse, Marty looks after their two school-age children (who are often discussed, but very seldom seen on-camera). 

* Crown Attorney Arnie Bateman is often, though not always, a force for trying to find a compromise between Wojeck&#x27;s sometimes nearly-obsessive desire for justice and the practical realities of the justice system. This frequently puts Wojeck and Bateman at odds professionally, with Bateman finding Wojeck&#x27;s &quot;tilting at windmills&quot; approach unhelpful and unsustainable, and a frustrated Wojeck finding Bateman cowardly or hypocritical. Nevertheless, they are (usually) able to put their differences aside in their personal lives and are shown to be good friends outside of work.

* Police Sergeant Byron James is also a work colleague and friend of Wojeck&#x27;s, who is assigned specifically to the Coroner&#x27;s Office as an investigator. Their relationship is noticeably less fraught than that of Wojeck and Bateman, with the quietly determined police sergeantlike Wojeckintent on seeing criminal activity punished appropriately.

&quot;Wojeck&quot; was noted for its issue-driven stories, exploring topics that had rarely been directly confronted in television drama to that time, whether in Canada or elsewhere. Episodes of &quot;Wojeck&quot; deal frankly with abortion, homosexuality, drug addiction, systemic corporate and government corruption, negligence of the elderly, and other issues that were otherwise almost completely absent from TV programming of the era.

== Main cast ==
* John Vernon as Steve Wojeck
* Patricia Collins as Marty Wojeck
* Ted Follows as Crown Attorney Arnold (Arnie) Bateman
* Carl Banas as Sgt. Bryon James

== Production ==
The show was inspired by the career of Dr. Morton Shulman. Unusually for the time, episodes were shot almost entirely on location using hand-held cameras, giving the show a semi-documentary feel. The first season (1966) was filmed in black and white, while season two (1968) was shot in colour.

&quot;Wojeck&quot; also notably took a &quot;rep company&quot; approach to guest casting, with some guest stars appearing multiple times in different roles over the brief 20-episode run. Cec Linder starred in four episodes as four different characters, Robert Goodier played three characters over four episodes, and many, many actors appeared in three episodes playing three different characters. Margot Kidder (then billed as Margaret Kidder) appeared in only one episode (season 2&#x27;s &quot;After All, Who&#x27;s Art Morrison?&quot;), but it was her on-screen acting debut.

Although it was one of the highest-rated shows on Canadian television in its time, only 20 episodes of &quot;Wojeck&quot; were made, because series star Vernon was lured to Hollywood by the promise of more money and more consistent work than the CBC could offer. (Even after &quot;Wojeck&quot;&#x27;s success, the CBC could not promise Vernon the show would return in 1969, as they had to wait for a year-end budget allocation.) Vernon only returned to the role once, for a TV movie &quot;Wojeck: Out of the Fire&quot; (1992).

==Episodes==
===&quot;Bob Hope Presents The Chrysler Theatre&quot; (1966)===

* Seen in advance of the series. Though not conceived as such, it was a &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;pilot&quot; for the subsequent TV series.
===Series 1 (1966)===
*All series 1 episodes are in black &amp; white.

===Series 2 (1968)===
*All series 2 episodes are in colour.

===Special (1992)===

*This production was created as a stand-alone, feature-length special. Originally shot in 1990 (and directed by original series director Daryl Duke), the production initially fell apart before completion due to a number of factors including weather-related shooting problems, and network dissatisfaction with the completed scenes. The script was extensively rewritten and reshot two years later by a different writer and director, though some footage from 1990 was retained. John Vernon, Patricia Collins and Ted Follows returned from the original series; Carl Banas did not. Duration: approximately 89 minutes.

== Forensic pathology theme ==
&quot;Wojeck&quot; was the first TV series to feature forensic pathology in the investigation of crime. This became the central theme of several other TV mystery-suspense dramas, beginning with the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Expert&quot; in 1968. Other programs include:
* &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, USA, 1976
* &quot;Silent Witness&quot;, UK (BBC), 1996
* &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot;, Canada (CBC), 1998
* &quot;Waking The Dead&quot;, UK (BBC), 2000
* &quot;&quot;, U.S. (CBS), 2000; and two spinoffs + a revival, including:
** &quot;&quot;, U.S. (CBS), 2002
** &quot;&quot;, U.S. (CBS), 2004
** &quot;&quot;, U.S. (CBS), 2021
* &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, U.S. (NBC), 2001
* &quot;Bones&quot;, U.S. (Fox), 2005
* &quot;RIS Delitti Imperfetti&quot;, Italy (Canale 5), 2005
* &quot;R.I.S, police scientifique&quot;, France (TF1), 2006
* &quot;Post Mortem&quot;, Germany (RTL), 2007
* &quot;R. I. S. – Die Sprache der Toten&quot;, Germany (Sat.1), 2007
* &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot;, U.S. (TNT), 2010
* &quot;Body of Proof&quot;, U.S. (ABC), 2011
* &quot;The Coroner&quot; UK, (BBC), 2015
* &quot;Coroner&quot;, Canada, (CBC), 2019

== Awards ==

* At the 19th Canadian Film Awards in 1967, Episode 1, &quot;The Last Man in the World&quot;, tied for Best Film for TV. Cinematographer Grahame Woods won the award for Best Black-and-White Cinematography and Ron Kelly won for Best Director.

* In 2002, &quot;Wojeck&quot; became a MasterWorks honouree by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada.

<text>Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) was a governmental agency in Taiwan which operated Taiwan Railway from 1948 to 2023. It managed, maintained, and operated conventional passenger and freight railway services on of track. Passenger traffic in 2018 was 231,267,955.

On 1 January 2024, Taiwan Railway Administration became a state-owned corporation, Taiwan Railway Corporation. The agency&#x27;s headquarters was at Taipei Main Station in Zhongzheng District, Taipei at the time of dissolution, the site which became the headquarter of the new company.

==History==

The railway between Keelung and Hsinchu was completed during the Qing era in 1893. In 1895, the Qing Empire ceded Formosa (Taiwan) to the Empire of Japan after the First Sino-Japanese War. The line was about in length but in a poor condition when the Japanese arrived. The railway was rebuilt and expanded under the of the Government-General of Taiwan during Japanese rule. 

Following the surrender of Japan in the aftermath of World War II, TRA was founded as a government organisation that falls under transport office of Taiwan Provincial Government in 1948. In 1998, it was transferred to the Ministry of Transportation and Communication (MOTC) of the central government and employed around 13,500 people (4,700 in transportation and 7,700 in maintenance titles) and directly operated some 682 route miles of 3’6” (1,067 mm) gauge railways. Three mainlines form a complete circle around the island. TRA&#x27;s West Coast line and Badu-Hualien section feature mostly double-track, electrification, modern colour light and cab signalling, overrun protection, and centralized traffic control (CTC). South-link line, east coast Taitung (converted from 762 mm gauge), and three “tourist” branches are non-electrified single-track with passing sidings.

=== Corporatization of TRA ===
Because of the several hundred-billions TWD of liabilities, and the legal person type of TRA is considered a block for elasticity operations of railway systems, there were several campaigns and groups set up that aim to take privatization and corporatization actions for TRA since 1990s. In May 2022 the Legislative Yuan approved the &quot;Act for Establishment of State-owned Taiwan Railway Co., Ltd.&quot; The legislation provided that TRA will transit to a state-owned railway company, set up a fund to handle debts of TRA, retain its employees, and consider raising salaries by 3~5%. TRA was incorporated as Taiwan Railway Corporation on January 1, 2024.

<doc id="899578" wikidata="Q2135836" url="?curid=899578" title="Recruit (company)">
<text>, also known as RGF (an acronym for Recruit Global Family) outside Japan, is a human resources holding company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan.

The company was founded by Hiromasa Ezoe, then an educational psychology student at the University of Tokyo, as &quot;Daigaku Shimbun Koukokusha&quot; (大学新聞広告社, University Newspaper Advertisement Company) in 1960. It was a spin-off from &quot;the Todai Shimbun&quot; (the University of Tokyo&#x27;s main student newspaper). 

In FY 2021, it reported sales of 2,872 billion Yen and revenue of 297 billion Yen, with 55.5% of its sales generated overseas. Its flagship world-wide services include the job search engine Indeed and the employer review site Glassdoor. The company is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core 30 indices. As of March 2024, the company has the 13th largest market capitalisation in the country of 11.4 trillion Yen.

==Overview==
Founded by Hiromasa Ezoe, Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. primarily offers staffing, promotional media, human resource media, and IT solutions. In recent years, the company has focused on IT-driven business sectors. It holds business competitions within the company that all employees can participate in, fostering a corporate culture that encourages freely initiating new ventures. Popular terms such as &quot;freeter (フリーター, freelancing part-timers)&quot;, &quot;employment ice age (就職氷河期)&quot;, and &quot;gaten-kei (ガテン系, meaning blue-collar jobs)&quot; have originated from information magazines it has published.

Following the Recruit scandal in 1988, which was regarded as one of the largest post-war scandals in Japan, the company faced a loss of credibility, adversity worsened further by the burst of the bubble economy. This led to the manifestation of bad assets issues with subsidiaries such as Recruit Cosmos (real estate) and First Finance (financial services). The entire group found itself in a difficult situation. In June 1992, its shares were transferred to the major supermarket chain Daiei, placing it under the Daiei Group. However, due to deteriorating performance within the Daiei Group, Recruit Holdings separated around the year 2000. At the time when it joined the Daiei Group, Daiei adopted a stance of being a &quot;silent shareholder&quot; without assuming any debts. Consequently, under Kunio Takagi from Daiei, Recruit managed to settle approximately 1.4 trillion yen in interest-bearing debt from the bubble era&#x27;s real estate and non-bank business failures by the fiscal year ending in March 1994 by itself. Currently, Recruit operates independently of any corporate group, maintaining neutrality in the service industry while expanding its business operations.

=== Jalan.net ===
Recruit operates Jalan.net, an online travel agency. The service launched on November 11, 2000. As of 2019, Jalan.net listed around 28,000 accommodations in Japan. In April 2019, Jalan.net introduced partial compensation to lodging facilities for no-shows in collaboration with an insurance company.
