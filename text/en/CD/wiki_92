<text>Eugène Ney Terre&#x27;Blanche (, 31 January 1941 – 3 April 2010) was an Afrikaner nationalist who founded and led the neo-Nazi (AWB; &#x27;Afrikaner Resistance Movement&#x27;). Prior to founding the AWB, he served as a South African Police officer, was a farmer, and was a Herstigte Nasionale Party (&#x27;Reconstituted National Party&#x27;) candidate for local office in the Transvaal. He was a major figure in the right-wing backlash against the collapse of apartheid. His beliefs and philosophy have continued to be influential amongst white supremacists in South Africa and across the world.

==Background==
Terre&#x27;Blanche&#x27;s grandfather fought as a Cape Rebel for the Boer cause in the Second Boer War, while his father was a lieutenant colonel in the South African Defence Force and a leader of the local Commando.

The progenitor of the Terre&#x27;Blanche name (translatable as either &#x27;white land&#x27; or &#x27;white earth&#x27; in French) in the region was a French Huguenot refugee, Estienne Terre&#x27;Blanche from Toulon (Provence), who arrived at the Cape in 1704, fleeing anti-Protestant persecution in France. The Terre&#x27;Blanche name has generally retained its original spelling though other spellings include Terre Blanche, Terblanche and Terblans.

Born on a farm in the Transvaal town of Ventersdorp on 31 January 1941, Terre&#x27;Blanche attended Laerskool Ventersdorp and Hoër Volkskool in Potchefstroom, matriculating in 1962. While in school, he gave early expression to his political leanings by founding the cultural organisation &quot;Jong Afrikanerharte&quot; (Young Afrikaner Hearts).

He joined the South African Police, and was initially deployed in South West Africa (now Namibia), which had been given to South Africa under a League of Nations Trust mandate after World War I. Upon returning to South Africa, he became a Warrant Officer in the Special Guard Unit, which was assigned to members of the Cabinet.

Under Terre&#x27;Blanche, the AWB swore to use violence to preserve minority rule, opposing any concessions offered to the African National Congress – an organisation AWB supporters repeatedly branded as Marxist terrorists – and gaining notoriety for storming the Kempton Park Trade Centre during bilateral negotiations in 1993. AWB loyalists also clashed with South African security forces at the Battle of Ventersdorp, a bloody skirmish in 1991 where police opened fire on a white crowd for the first time since the Rand Rebellion, leaving three AWB members dead. Immediately prior to South Africa&#x27;s first non-racial election, Terre&#x27;Blanche&#x27;s followers were linked to a number of bombings and assassinations targeting the South African Communist Party; armed AWB commandos participated in the crisis in Bophuthatswana in 1994.

Terre&#x27;Blanche spent three years in a Rooigrond prison for assaulting a petrol station attendant and for the attempted murder of a black security guard around 1996. He was released in June 2004. On 3 April 2010, he was hacked and beaten to death on his Ventersdorp farm, by two of his black employees.

==Political career==

===Herstigte Nasionale Party===
During the late 1960s, Terre&#x27;Blanche increasingly opposed what he called the &quot;liberal policies&quot; of B. J. Vorster, then Prime Minister of South Africa. After four years of service in the South African Police, he resigned to pursue a career in politics, running unsuccessfully for local office in Heidelberg as a member of the far-right Herstigte Nasionale Party.

===Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging===
Disillusioned with the established avenues for political participation, Terre&#x27;Blanche founded the (AWB) in Heidelberg with six other individuals in 1973. Initially a secret society, the AWB first appeared on the public scene after its members were charged and fined in connection with the tarring and feathering of Floors van Jaarsveld, a professor of history who had publicly voiced the opinion that the Day of the Vow, a religious public holiday in remembrance of the Battle of Blood River, was nothing more than a secular event with hardly any real reference point in history. Although Terre&#x27;Blanche would later express his regrets regarding the incident when testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he suggested that his convictions relating to the sanctity of the Day of the Vow might make his actions more understandable. In the years that followed, Terre&#x27;Blanche&#x27;s speeches at public gatherings often evoked the Battle of Blood River, and his oratorical skills earned him much support among the white right wing in South Africa; the AWB claimed 70,000 members at its height. In September 1977, Johannesburg newspaper &quot;The World&quot; reported that Terre&#x27;Blanche had been investigated on charges of bestiality involving a number of African bushpigs.

Throughout the 1980s, Terre&#x27;Blanche continued to present himself and the AWB as an alternative to both the National Party-led government and the Conservative Party, and he remained staunchly opposed to the reform policies of P. W. Botha to establish additional, albeit still separate, parliamentary chambers for non-whites, and to grant suffrage to Coloureds and South Africans of Indian origin. The organisation&#x27;s strongest support was found in the rural communities of South Africa&#x27;s North, with comparably few supporters in urban areas where his following was largely limited to middle and lower-income Afrikaners.

====End of apartheid====

Terre&#x27;Blanche viewed the end of apartheid as a surrender to communism, and threatened full-scale civil war if President F. W. de Klerk handed power to Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress. When De Klerk addressed a meeting in Terre&#x27;Blanche&#x27;s hometown of Ventersdorp in 1991, Terre&#x27;Blanche led a protest, and the Battle of Ventersdorp ensued between the AWB and the police, with a number of people killed. Terre&#x27;Blanche claimed that it was only when he stood between the police and the AWB and demanded a ceasefire that the shooting ended. Terre&#x27;Blanche accused President de Klerk of instigating the riot for political gain.

In an attempt to disrupt the negotiation process in 1993, Terre&#x27;Blanche led an armed invasion of the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park while negotiations to end apartheid were in progress. After a memorandum of grievances was presented to National Party minister Roelf Meyer and Dawie de Villiers and after an agreement that no arrests would be made, the AWB withdrew from the premises. That evening several identified AWB leaders were arrested and their wives were incarcerated in Soweto, separately from their husbands. Vlakplaas General Krappies Engelbrecht was appointed to launch an investigation.

Terre&#x27;Blanche claimed he and President Lucas Mangope of the predominantly ethnic Tswana Homeland of Bophuthatswana came to a &quot;mutual agreement&quot; on 17 February 1992 to aid each other in the &quot;event of a communist threat&quot;. On 4 March 1994 Mangope announced that Bophutatswana would not participate in the South African general election in an effort to maintain Bophutatswana&#x27;s independence from the Republic of South Africa. Bophuthatswana&#x27;s minister of justice, Godfrey Mothibe tried in vain to convince Mangope to participate in the election, but then accused the ANC of orchestrating the revolt, which was helped by the stance taken by South Africa&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Pik Botha. Thousands of ANC supporters were bussed in from outside Bophuthatswana to support the popular uprising. Terre&#x27;Blanche claimed a conspiracy by citing a &quot;three-step plan&quot; by the ANC in an effort to destabilise Bophuthatswana, which included ANC infiltration of the Bophuthatswana police and military. However, ANC candidate for the North West Province, Popo Molefe claimed the ANC was merely supporting the people of Bophuthatswana after it became clear that their political freedoms were limited. 

The AWB were subsequently defeated while invading Bophuthatswana to prop up the autocratic leader of the Bantustan in 1994 and Terre&#x27;Blanche did not follow up on his earlier threats of war.

Terre&#x27;Blanche claimed he had personally communicated with Mangope on 10 March 1994, prior to mobilising his men to protect the capital Mmabatho against looting and unrest. Officers of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force initially received the AWB militia with &quot;great joy and surprise&quot;. (Vuur en Verraad, Arthur Kemp) The AWB militia assembled in an airport hangar in Mmabatho, where they were to be provided with rations and firearms. Terre&#x27;Blanche ordered his men to remove their AWB badges upon the request of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force. While contained at the hangar, an unidentified and independent faction carrying the AWB emblems started shooting indiscriminately at the public. Terre&#x27;Blanche concluded that the South African intelligence services may have set up the shooting in order to discredit the AWB, since the media broadcast footage of the individuals&#x27; emblems, but did not publicise their identity. The Bophuthatswana police systematically began to remove the media from strategic locations, and the initial hospitality shown to the AWB militia was replaced by contempt. When Bophuthatswana fell into complete anarchy, the AWB withdrew.

===1991 documentary and libel case===
Terre&#x27;Blanche was the subject of the television documentary &quot;The Leader, His Driver and the Driver&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1991), directed by British filmmaker Nick Broomfield. Broomfield&#x27;s documentary claimed Terre&#x27;Blanche had an affair with Jani Allan, the journalist who had interviewed him for South Africa&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times&quot;; an assertion she disputed as well as her portrayal in the documentary. This provoked a scandal in the AWB. In July 1989, Cornelius Lottering, a member of the breakaway Orde van die Dood group, orchestrated a failed assassination attempt on Allan&#x27;s life by placing a bomb outside her Sandton apartment.

This led to Allan taking libel proceedings against the documentary broadcaster Channel 4 in 1992 in the London&#x27;s High Court. During the court hearings, several transcripts of their alleged sexual relationship appeared in the South African and British press. Terre&#x27;Blanche submitted a sworn statement to the London court denying he had had an affair with Allan. In a rare interview with the Afrikaans Sunday newspaper &quot;Die Rapport&quot;, his wife Martie Terre&#x27;Blanche denounced the rumours. Although the judge found that Channel 4&#x27;s allegations had not defamed Allan, he did not rule on whether or not there had been an affair. The South African business newspaper &quot;Financial Mail&quot; published a lead story on 6 August detailing the theory that F.W. de Klerk had orchestrated the libel case to discredit Terre&#x27;Blanche and the far right movement in South Africa. Allan has continued to dismiss the claims.

===Amnesty===
Following the end of apartheid, Terre&#x27;Blanche and his supporters sought amnesty for the storming of the World Trade Centre, the &#x27;Battle of Ventersdorp&#x27;, and other acts.
Amnesty was granted by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

===Later years===
In 2004, Terre&#x27;Blanche was voted No. 25 in SABC3&#x27;s &quot;Great South Africans&quot;, a list of 100 South African personalities. Controversy over the list led the SABC to cancel the television series.

Terre&#x27;Blanche was much ridiculed after he was filmed falling off his horse during a parade in Pretoria. After his murder, the state-owned SABC said on the evening news that he would be remembered &quot;as a failed horseman&quot;. Terre&#x27;Blanche claimed the media only showed part of the fall and explained that unedited footage of the incident would show that the horse had slipped. He accused the media of double standards in reporting when praising Mbhazima Shilowa when he fell from his horse but immediately remounted.

Broomsfield&#x27;s sequel to his 1991 documentary, &quot;His Big White Self&quot;, was first broadcast in February 2006. Terre&#x27;Blanche was also interviewed by Louis Theroux in episode 3.3 &quot;Boer Separatists&quot; of the BBC series &quot;Louis Theroux&#x27;s Weird Weekends&quot;, and was characterized during the episode by Theroux speaking to a former follower of Terre&#x27;Blanche as &quot;very hostile, deeply racist&quot;.

In March 2008, the AWB announced the re-activation of the political party for &#x27;populist&#x27; reasons, citing the encouragement of the public. Reasons for the return have been attributed principally to attacks on commercial farmers and ethnic Boers, the electricity crisis, corruption across government departments and rampant crime. Throughout April 2008, Terre&#x27;Blanche was to be the speaker at several AWB rallies, encompassing Vryburg, Middelburg, Mpumalanga and Pretoria.

He had been calling for a &quot;free Afrikaner republic&quot;, and vowed to take his campaign to the United Nations&#x27; International Court of Justice in The Hague in a bid to secure this. He favoured large tracts of land that he claimed had been purchased from the ethnic Swazis in the eastern portion of the South African Republic, from the Zulus in northern Natal, and others, as well as largely uninhabited portions of the interior that had been settled by the Voortrekkers. In June 2008, it was announced that the AWB Youth Wing would be launched and Terre&#x27;Blanche was to be its founding member.

In a video interview in 2008, he voiced his objection to a proposal to change the Springbok emblem of the South Africa national rugby union team (Springboks). He stated that the Springbok emblem could be replaced with an impala or kudu for sports teams representing the new Afrikaner republic.

In September 2009, he addressed a three-day convention attended by 300 Afrikaners which was intended to develop a strategy for &quot;Boer liberation&quot;. Terre&#x27;Blanche reinforced earlier claims for land in Northern Natal and the Eastern Transvaal. In October 2009 several right-wing groups led by Terre&#x27;Blanche outlined their future plans at a Ventersdorp meeting. In an interview with the &quot;Mail and Guardian&quot; he said he wanted to unite 23 organisations under one umbrella, in order to take, as he had vowed, the fight of &quot;the free Afrikaner&quot; to the International Court of Justice.

In an interview with the &quot;Mail and Guardian&quot;, he stated that he would publish his biography, &quot;Blouberge van Nimmer&quot; (&quot;The Blue Mountains of Long Ago&quot;), in December 2009. The biography was ready for press at the time of his death and published under the name &quot;My Storie&quot;, as told to author Amos van der Merwe. A complaint was lodged in December 2009 with the South African Human Rights Commission regarding inflammatory comments he was alleged to have made.

==Conviction and prison sentence==
On 17 June 2001, Terre&#x27;Blanche was sentenced to six years in prison, of which he served three years, for assaulting John Ndzima, a petrol station worker, and the attempted murder of Paul Motshabi, a security guard, in 1996. Terre&#x27;Blanche denied both accusations.
One of only three whites in the Rooigrond prison near Mafikeng, during his time in prison he claimed to have become a born-again Christian and to have moderated many of his racist views.

===Assault on Ndzima===
The assault on Ndzima occurred after a confrontation over Ndzima&#x27;s testimony against two white boys who had broken into a pharmacy in Ventersdorp. Terre&#x27;Blanche said that he merely argued with Ndzima after the burglary, questioning Ndzima&#x27;s claims to have seen the burglars. According to Terre&#x27;Blanche, during the argument his dog broke loose and chased Ndzima. Terre&#x27;Blanche asked the state prosecution to explain why there was no blood on his overall after the alleged assault. He claimed that a bogus case had been built against him in order to &quot;bury the conservative element of Afrikaner-nationalism in the shallow grave of injustice&quot;. The court rejected his claims, concluding that Terre&#x27;Blanche had assaulted Ndzima as retribution for testifying against whites. Terre&#x27;Blanche later said that his defence attorney had resigned as a member of the ultra-conservative white Conservative Party&#x27;s Volksraad and joined the ANC shortly after the conclusion of the court case.

===Attempted murder of Motshabi===
Security Guard Paul Motshabi was permanently disabled when he was beaten by Terre&#x27;Blanche in 1996. He was crippled and intellectually impaired by brain damage sustained in the attack, and his wife left him. He was one of 16 victims of violence in the South Africa&#x27;s North West who received new houses as part of the national government&#x27;s campaign to mark 16 days of activism against violence against women and children.

Terre&#x27;Blanche also maintained his innocence in the Motshabi case, stating that he had discovered Motshabi already beaten in a park while patrolling Ventersdorp, after which he took him to hospital. Although he was not present when the alleged attack happened, Gabriel Kgosimang, an ex-employee of Terre&#x27;Blanche, testified that his former employer had repeatedly beaten Motshabi over the head, upper body, neck and shoulders after he crashed into him with his vehicle. The official medical report only cites a single hit to the head.

Motshabi passed away due to natural causes on 23 August 2017, aged 48.

===Subsequent disputes===
Terre&#x27;Blanche was released on 11 June 2004. The AWB website continued to claim that these accusations, along with other scandals involving him, were fabricated by the &quot;Black Government and the left wing media&quot;. Terre&#x27;Blanche subsequently claimed that a policeman had identified the real attackers of Motshabi. The names were supposedly contained in a sealed envelope and kept in safekeeping with instructions given that this information would be released in case something &quot;unnatural&quot; should happen to him. Despite the murder of Terre&#x27;Blanche, no names have been released.

==Poetry==
Prior to the 1994 non-racial elections, Terre&#x27;Blanche&#x27;s Afrikaans-language works were on the state syllabus of Natal schools. Upon his release from jail, he quoted Wordsworth&#x27;s poem &quot;I Wandered Lonely As a Cloud&quot;. He had previously released a CD of his poetry collection and later a DVD. The DVD was named &quot;Inktrane&quot;, which is directly translated to English as &quot;ink tears&quot;.

==Murder==
Terre&#x27;Blanche, who had lived in relative obscurity since the decline of his organisation, was murdered on his farm &quot;Villana&quot;, just outside Ventersdorp, on 3 April 2010. He was beaten and hacked to death with pipes and &quot;panga&quot; machetes whilst napping. His body was found on his bed with severe facial and head injuries. His murder has been categorised as a typical and notable case of South African farm attacks.

South African President Jacob Zuma, who followed up an overnight statement with a televised address, called for calm and for &quot;responsible leadership&quot; following the murder, describing it as a &quot;terrible deed;&quot; and described the murderer as &quot;cowardly.&quot; Zuma&#x27;s words were echoed by the AWB and organisations including AfriForum and Solidarity. Minister of Police Nathi Mthethwa, Commissioner of police Bheki Cele and other high ranking police officials and politicians visited Terre&#x27;Blanche&#x27;s family in Ventersdorp the morning after the murder to express sympathy with the family.

Two males, Chris Mahlangu, aged 28, and Patrick Ndlovu, aged 15, were arrested. Both were employees at Terre&#x27;Blanche&#x27;s farm. They were both charged with murder, and one was released on bail. Terre&#x27;Blanche&#x27;s daughter Bea told the media that the two workers had not been paid for March because her father could not get his banking in order before the Easter weekend, and that an arrangement had been made to pay them after the weekend. She stated that he had enjoyed a good relationship with his employees, which had been strengthened by their work with animals on the farm.

===Aftermath===
Chris Mahlangu&#x27;s announcement to other farm workers that he was &quot;now their boss&quot; fuelled suspicions that the murder was politically motivated. The murder took place amid a racial controversy in South Africa involving the singing of a song by African National Congress Youth League leader Julius Malema, which includes the lyrics &quot;Shoot the Boer&quot; (&quot;Dubul&#x27; ibhunu&quot;). The ANC, which had previously defended its right to sing the song, announced that it would consider a moratorium on the singing of the song, following the murder, in the interests of national cohesion. Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille said that the murder would &quot;inflame tensions&quot; in South Africa. Malema denied the song had anything to do with the murder, and defended his singing of it, saying he was &quot;ready to die&quot;, and that he was not scared of Boers, in reference to threats that Terre&#x27;Blanche would be avenged. ANC leaders later announced a temporary ban on the singing of the song.

Thousands attended Terre&#x27;Blanche&#x27;s funeral, held at noon on 9 April 2010 at Ventersdorp&#x27;s Protestant Church. Later the same day, he was buried on his farm.

===Court case===
The two suspects appeared in court in Ventersdorp on 6 April 2010 amid racially charged scenes, and were charged with murder, robbery and &quot;crimen injuria&quot;, for injuring the dignity of Terre&#x27;Blanche by leaving his trousers pulled down after killing him. The AWB retracted earlier calls to avenge the murder as Zuma appealed for peace. Nevertheless, members of the ANC supported the accused by turning up at the court in huge numbers, and singing revolutionary songs. Terre&#x27;Blanche&#x27;s supporters also turned up at the court, singing the former South African national anthem, &quot;Die Stem van Suid Afrika&quot;.

On 22 May 2012, 29-year-old Chris Mahlangu was found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. 18-year-old Patrick Ndlovu, the other man accused in the case, was acquitted of murder due to a lack of forensic evidence, though he was found guilty of breaking-in. They had both pleaded not guilty, and declined to testify. Protesters from both sides were gathered outside the court when the verdict was read. Judge John Horn ruled that there was no evidence that Mahlangu had been acting in self-defence, and that the murder had been committed for financial reasons. Although Mahlangu claimed that he had been raped, Horn declared that if that was the case he should have raised it immediately, which he had not done. He also claimed that he had been acting in retaliation because he had been living in an &quot;appalling condition ... not fit for human habitation,&quot; as well as having experienced child exploitation on the farm.

==In popular culture==
In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s 1992 science fiction novel &quot;The Guns of the South&quot;, Eugene Terre&#x27;Blanche is fictionalised as the minor character Eugen Blankaard, whose name is a literal Afrikaans translation. This character, a historian of AWB, does not appear directly, but his writings are read by other characters. A poster of Terre&#x27;Blanche appears in the 1992 Australian drama &quot;Romper Stomper&quot;, about a neo-Nazi group in suburban Melbourne.

Terre&#x27;Blanche is the subject of two Nick Broomfield documentaries: &quot;The Leader, His Driver, and the Driver&#x27;s Wife&quot; and &quot;His Big White Self&quot;.

Louis Theroux interviewed Terre&#x27;Blanche in 2000 as part of his &quot;Weird Weekends&quot; documentary on the Boers.

<text>Conrad Joseph Gozzo (February 6, 1922October 8, 1964) was an American trumpet player. He was a member of the NBC Hollywood staff orchestra at the time of his death.

== Early life ==

Gozzo was born in New Britain, Connecticut on February 6, 1922, to Mildred Katz and Jimmy Gozzo. Son of Sicilian parents from Canicattini Bagni (SR). His father played trumpet, and Gozzo began learning the instrument around the age of 5. He played in his junior and senior high school bands, but left school in 1938 or 1939 at the recommendation of Isham Jones to join bandleader and clarinetist Tommy Reynolds in Boston, Massachusetts.

== Career ==

Gozzo was quickly noted for his exceptional technical ability and style. He played under Reynolds for nine months, leaving to play with Red Norvo in November 1939; he played under Norvo until February 1941, but with a brief interlude playing with trumpeter Johnnie Davis. He had a brief tenure with the orchestra of Bob Chester, with whom he first recorded; then performed and recorded with Claude Thornhill&#x27;s band. There he met vocalist Betty Claire, who he married in late 1941. Thornhill&#x27;s band dissolved in October 1942.

Gozzo briefly worked with Benny Goodman, then enlisted in the U.S. Navy in mid-November 1942, where clarinetist Artie Shaw had formed a band, the Rangers No. 501. They were first assigned to San Francisco and left for Hawaii in late December. They toured in the South Pacific, the U.K. and the mainland U.S. until being discharged in October 1945. Gozzo briefly rejoined Goodman along with fellow trumpet players from Shaw&#x27;s band.

Gozzo, lead trumpeter on the Glen Gray, Stan Kenton, and Harry James &quot;remakes&quot;, and in Dan Terry&#x27;s 1954 Columbia sessions, recorded extensively with arrangers Van Alexander, Nelson Riddle, Billy May, Ray Conniff, Jerry Fielding and Shorty Rogers, and also with performers Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. He played first trumpet on all of the recordings of composer Henry Mancini. He performed on many major live television shows broadcast on the NBC network, including the &quot;Dinah Shore Show&quot; (1955 through 1964). He also performed on motion picture soundtracks including &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot;, &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. He played on the Ella Fitzgerald two-record set on Verve, &quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Harold Arlen Songbook.&quot;

Gozzo&#x27;s nicknames were &quot;Goz&quot; and &quot;Gopher&quot;, due to his resemblance to a gopher when viewed from the front while he was playing. He was considered by his colleagues as being an exceptionally strong trumpeter with a well-developed range and tonal quality. For most of his recording career, he played a Besson Meha trumpet with a custom Bert Herrick mouthpiece. Occasionally, he played a Chicago Benge or a LeBlanc Gozzo model trumpet.

In March 1955, Gozzo released his own album, &quot;Goz the Great!&quot;, signed with RCA Victor and played by &quot;Conrad Gozzo and his Orchestra&quot;, directed by Billy May. Three of the twelve tracks were written together by Gozzo and May. The album was not particularly successful and was reviewed as mediocre.

== Death and legacy ==
Gozzo died on October 8, 1964, of liver disease at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California. On November 15, 1964, a fundraising concert for his widow was held at the Hollywood Palladium, featuring singers Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee and Dinah Shore.

&quot;A Trumpeter&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (1957) by Tutti Camarata originally featured Gozzo, and was performed on November 19, 1989, in New Britain for the 25th anniversary of his death. Jazz composer Sammy Nestico dedicated &quot;Portrait of a Trumpet&quot; to Gozzo.

<doc id="901254" wikidata="Q177570" url="?curid=901254" title="Maltodextrin">
<text>Maltodextrin is a name shared by two different families of chemicals. Both families are glucose polymers (also called &quot;dextrose polymers&quot; or &quot;dextrins&quot;), but have little chemical or nutritional similarity.

The digestible maltodextrins (or simply &quot;maltodextrins&quot;) are manufactured as white solids derived from chemical processing of plant starches. They are used as food additives, which are digested rapidly, providing glucose as food energy. They are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for food and beverage manufacturing in numerous products. Due to their rapid production of glucose, digestible maltodextrins are potential risks for people with diabetes.

The digestion-resistant maltodextrins (also called resistant maltodextrins) are defined as nutritional food additives due to their ability upon fermentation in the colon to yield short-chain fatty acids, which contribute to gastrointestinal health. Digestion-resistant maltodextrins are also white solids resulting from the chemical processing of plant starches, but are processed using methods specifically to be resistant to digestion. They are used as ingredients in many consumer products, such as low-calorie sweeteners, and are considered GRAS.

Consumers may find the shared name for different maltodextrin food additives to be confusing.

==Definition==
Digestible maltodextrins are well-defined chemically, understood, and documented. By contrast, digestion-resistant maltodextrins being the newer and more complex chemical family are less defined chemically, researched and documented.

Maltodextrins are classified by a dextrose equivalent (DE), a number between 3 and 20 that corresponds to the number of free chain ends in a certain sample. A lower DE value means the polymer chains are longer (contain more glucose units) whereas a higher DE value means the chains are shorter. This is an inverse concept compared with the degree of polymerization of the chain. A high-DE maltodextrin is sweeter, more soluble, and has lower heat resistance. Above DE 20, the European Union&#x27;s CN code calls it glucose syrup; at DE 10 or lower, the customs CN code nomenclature classifies maltodextrins as dextrins.

===Digestible maltodextrin===
Maltodextrins consist of -glucose units connected in chains of variable length. The glucose units are primarily linked with α(1→4) glycosidic bonds, like those seen in the linear derivative of glycogen (after the removal of α1,6- branching). Commercial maltodextrin is typically composed of a mixture of chains that vary from three to 17 glucose units long. Properties of maltodextrin, such as sweetness, viscosity, and texture, can be manipulated during manufacturing by altering the extent of starch hydrolysis.

Maltodextrins are digested into glucose units, contributing a food energy value of 4 calories per gram (or 16 kiloJoules per gram). Maltodextrin manufacturing produces a high-purity product with microbiological safety, making it applicable to varied food, beverage, sports, and baked products.

===Digestion-resistant maltodextrin===
Digestion-resistant maltodextrins are a chemical family much larger than the family of digestible maltodextrins. A definition of a digestion-resistant maltodextrin is: &quot;Resistant maltodextrin/dextrin is a glucose oligosaccharide. Resistant maltodextrin and dextrin products are composed of non-digestible oligosaccharides of glucose molecules that are joined by digestible linkages and non-digestible α-1,2 and α-1,3 linkages.&quot; The chemical is of greater structural complexity than a digestible maltodextrin. The two families of maltodextrins have little in common chemically or nutritionally.

Names used to identify digestion-resistant maltodextrin as an ingredient in foods for regulatory purposes include &quot;soluble fiber&quot;, &quot;resistant dextrin&quot;, or &quot;dextrin&quot;. Names may include the food starch used to fabricate the ingredient.

The chemical family has had a history of changes in classification. As of 2023, a digestion-resistant maltodextrin is considered a resistant dextrin and a resistant starch of type 5. Another study contrasted resistant dextrins and resistant maltodextrins, finding them to differ chemically and functionally. In that study, the final maltodextrin product required further processing of the resistant dextrin. The chemical family is effectively defined by the food starch and the manufacturing process, both of which may vary according to manufacturing preferences.

The digestion-resistant maltodextrin ingredient has several properties exploited in food or beverage manufacturing: it is a low-moisture (5% water), free-flowing, fine white powder that disperses readily in water; it is clear in solution with low viscosity; it is odorless, slightly acidic, and has a bland flavor; it is 90% dietary fiber. The average molecular mass of the digestion-resistant maltodextrin molecule is 2,000 daltons.

Digestion-resistant maltodextrin is a soluble (fermentable) dietary fiber with numerous non-starch glycosidic bonds, allowing it to pass through the digestive tract unchanged in physical properties without undergoing digestion, supplying no food energy. In the colon, it is a prebiotic fiber fermented by gut microbiota, resulting in the formation of short-chain fatty acids contributing to gastrointestinal health.

== History ==
After development of food ingredients from starch sources around 1950, digestible maltodextrins were first produced between 1967 and 1973. Digestion-resistant maltodextrins were developed in the 1990s from studies of starch nutrition, leading to the definition of resistant starch. This was accompanied by the detection of digestion-resistant components in food products and manufacturing methods. Some sources typically referred to digestible maltodextrin when describing maltodextrin without further definition of which maltodextrin was used.

==Manufacturing==
===Digestible maltodextrin production===
Maltodextrin can be enzymatically derived from any starch, such as corn, potato, rice or cassava. In the United States, this starch is usually corn; in Europe, it is common to use wheat. A food starch is boiled. The resulting paste is treated with a combination of acid and enzymes to produce maltodextrins.

===Digestion-resistant maltodextrin production===
Digestion-resistant maltodextrins are manufactured by a process superficially similar to that for digestible maltodextrins. A food starch is exposed to a combination of heat, acid and enzymes before purification. Part of the process deliberately resembles human digestion thus, the result is digestion-resistant by design. Neither the food starch source nor the process is standardized. 

A list of 14 preparation methods included three to four different methods, including microwave heating. Similar methods differed in detail, possibly because methods are optimized for the plant starch source. One study provided a detailed description of a laboratory method for producing digestion-resistant maltodextrins, combining several of the listed preparation methods.

A step in one method of preparing digestion-resistant maltodextrins is roasting the plant starch in acid conditions. The process breaks the starch molecules into small units, which then recombine with different, more digestion-resistant bonds. Enzymes can be used to break starches apart as an alternative to roasting.

A 2023 review found that use of different starch sources and different manufacturing techniques may produce digestion-resistant maltodextrins with varied properties, concluding that manufacturing methods for digestion-resistant maltodextrin lacked standardization. Another 2023 review of methods examined digestion-resistant maltodextrins from three different starch sources (potato, cassava, and sweet potato) using identical manufacturing techniques. The resulting digestion-resistant maltodextrins were measured to have small physical and chemical differences, such as in formation of dextrin crystals and surface porosity, digestion resistance (80-85%), thermal stabilities, solubility, and formation of pastes. The significance of such differences to the quality of processed foods and health is unknown. A third 2023 study showed maltodextrin digestion rates to be a function of molecular structure.

==Food uses==
In the European Union, wheat-derived maltodextrin is exempt from wheat allergen labeling, as set out in Annex II of EC Regulation No 1169/2011. In the United States, however, it is not exempt from allergen declaration per the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, and its effect on a voluntary gluten-free claim must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis per the applicable FDA policy.

===Digestible maltodextrin===

Maltodextrin has varied applications for food and beverage processing, including medical food, baby food, hospital food, and sports supplement products. It is also used as a substitute for lactose.

Maltodextrin is used to improve the texture and mouthfeel of food and beverage products, such as potato chips and &quot;light&quot; peanut butter to reduce the fat content. It is an effective flavorant, bulking agent, and sugar substitute.

Maltodextrin is easily digestible and can provide a quick source of food energy. Due to its rapid absorption, maltodextrin is used by athletes as an ingredient in sports drinks or recovery supplements to replenish glycogen stores and enhance performance during prolonged exercise. It can be taken as a dietary supplement in powder form, gel packets, energy drinks or oral rinse. Maltodextrin has a high glycemic index of 110, compared to glucose (100) and table sugar (80).

In the United States, maltodextrin is considered a safe ingredient (GRAS) for food manufacturing.

===Digestion-resistant maltodextrin===
Digestion-resistant maltodextrin is included among other sources as &quot;functional fiber&quot;, meaning its use in foods may provide improved function of the gastrointestinal system. The low molecular weight, low viscosity, high water solubility, and resistance to enzymatic activity allow digestion-resistant maltodextrin to avoid digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. Such properties may be advantageous to add digestion-resistant maltodextrin as a source of fermentable dietary fiber in food manufacturing, while maintaining the sensory qualities of processed foods.

Digestion-resistant maltodextrins, as prebiotic dietary fiber, are additives used in processed foods primarily as bulking agents or with the intent to confer a health effect. The characteristics of digestion-resistant maltodextrins allow them to be added to diverse kinds of food products, such as beverages, dairy products, and desserts.

They are also relatively low-calorie, colorless, odorless and tasteless. They are nontoxic, chemically stable, and nonreactive with other food ingredients over the range of temperatures required for food preparation and storage.

In Europe, the United States, and Canada, industrial digestion-resistant maltodextrin is recognized as a safe ingredient for food manufacturing.

==Health research==
===Digestible maltodextrin===

Due to its liberation of glucose molecules when digested, maltodextrin can cause a rapid increase in blood sugar levels when consumed in large quantities, especially for individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance. As maltodextrin is quickly digested and absorbed, excessive consumption may contribute to weight gain, impaired insulin sensitivity, and elevated blood lipids, if not balanced with an appropriate lifestyle or diet.

===Digestion-resistant maltodextrin===
Digestion-resistant maltodextrin is a fermentable dietary fiber under research for its potential to lower the risk of hypoglycemia, obesity, and associated disorders of metabolic syndrome. While traversing the colon, digestion-resistant maltodextrin is a substrate for producing short-chain fatty acids the main energy source of cells lining the colon, thereby contributing to health of the gastrointestinal system. Consumption of foods containing digestion-resistant maltodextrin increases the frequency and volume of bowel movements, potentially relieving constipation.

Reviews have concluded that digestion-resistant maltodextrin is classified as a type 5 resistant starch (RS5), a prebiotic dietary fiber having properties that may improve management of diabetes and other disorders of metabolic syndrome. Consumption of food or beverage products containing fermentable dietary fibers, such as digestion-resistant maltodextrin, may cause abdominal discomfort, bloating, and flatulence.

===Health claim regulation===

In 2014, a scientific panel for the European Food Safety Authority concluded that manufactured foods containing a commercial digestion-resistant dextrin were eligible for a health claim of reducing post-meal blood glucose levels.

In 2017, Health Canada included digestion-resistant maltodextrin among manufactured sources of dietary fiber having desirable physiological effects eligible for product labeling.

In 2018, the United States FDA issued an industry guidance document stating that foods made with digestion-resistant maltodextrin could be advertised as providing a health benefit from fermentable dietary fiber.

==Other uses==
Maltodextrin is used to coat pills and tablets, and to formulate powders, in the manufacturing of prescription drugs and dietary supplement products. It is also used as a horticultural insecticide both in the field and in greenhouses. Having no biochemical action, its efficacy is based upon spraying a dilute solution upon the pest insects, whereupon the solution dries, blocks insect spiracles, and causes death by asphyxiation.

<doc id="901258" wikidata="Q2561154" url="?curid=901258" title="Paixhans gun">
<text>The Paixhans gun (French: &quot;Canon Paixhans&quot;, ) was the first naval gun designed to fire explosive shells. It was developed by the French general Henri-Joseph Paixhans in 1822–1823. The design furthered the evolution of naval artillery into the modern age. Its use presaged the end of wood as the preferred material in naval warships, and the rise of the ironclad.

Explosive shells had been used in ground warfare and against stationary targets, but not in high-velocity, flat-trajectory guns due to safety concerns. Henri-Joseph Paixhans developed a delaying mechanism that allowed explosive shells to be safely fired in high-powered guns, first demonstrated in trials in 1824. The French Navy adopted the first Paixhans guns in 1841, and the weapons eventually saw use in the 1840s by France, Britain, Russia, and the United States. The guns&#x27; effectiveness in naval combat was demonstrated in battles such as Veracruz in 1838, Campeche in 1843, and Sinop in 1853.

Although the idea was innovative, metallurgy at the time had not advanced enough for safe operation, leading to catastrophic failures in naval guns. Further developments by John A. Dahlgren and Thomas Jackson Rodman improved the weapon for both solid shot and shell use.

==Background==
Explosive shells had long been in use in ground warfare (in howitzers and mortars) and on bomb vessels against stationary targets, but they were fired only at high angles and with relatively low velocities. The shells of that time were inherently dangerous to handle, and no method had been found to safely fire the explosive shells with the high power and flatter trajectory of a high-velocity gun.

However, before the advent of radar and modern optical controlled firing, high trajectories were not practical for ship-to-ship combat. Such combat essentially required flat-trajectory guns in order to have a reasonable chance of hitting the target. Therefore, ship-to-ship combat had consisted for centuries of encounters between flat-trajectory cannons using inert cannonballs, which could inflict only local damage, even on wooden hulls.

==Mechanism==
Paixhans advocated using flat-trajectory shell guns against warships in 1822 in his &quot;Nouvelle force maritime et artillerie&quot;.

Paixhans developed a delaying mechanism that, for the first time, allowed shells to be fired safely in high-powered flat-trajectory guns. The effect of explosive shells lodging into wooden hulls and then detonating was potentially devastating. Henri-Joseph Paixhans first demonstrated this in trials against the two-decker &quot;Pacificateur&quot; in 1824, in which he successfully broke up the ship. Two prototype Paixhans guns had been cast in 1823 and 1824 for this test. Paixhans reported the results in &quot;Experiences faites sur une arme nouvelle&quot;. The shells had a fuze that ignited automatically when the gun was fired; they lodged in the wooden hull of the target, and exploded a moment later:

The first Paixhans guns for the French Navy were made in 1841. The barrel of the guns weighed about (), and proved accurate to about (). In the 1840s, France, Britain, Russia, and the United States adopted the new naval guns.

The effect of the guns in an operational context was first demonstrated during the actions at Veracruz in 1838, at Campeche in 1843, Eckernförde in 1849 during the Danish–Prussian War, and especially at the Battle of Sinop in 1853 during the Crimean War. The Naval Battle of Campeche made history because it was the first time both sides used explosive shells and the only time sailing ships defeated steamers.

According to the &quot;Penny Cyclopaedia&quot; (1858):


==Development==
While the idea was notable in the advance of artillery, metallurgy had not advanced to the level needed for safe operation. The naval guns of this type were known for catastrophic failures: the chambers would burst in use. The long shells and large blackpowder charges needed to propel the shells put a stress on cast-iron cannon that often could not be contained. Further work by John A. Dahlgren, and Thomas Jackson Rodman improved the weapon to use both solid shot and shell safely.

==Adoption==
===France===

In 1827, the French navy ordered fifty large guns on the Paixhans model from the arsenals at Ruelle and at Indret near Nantes. The gun chosen, the &quot;canon-obusier de 80&quot;, was so called because it was of the bore diameter which would have fired an 80-pound solid shot. The gun barrel weighed and the bore was of diameter and long, firing a shell weighing . The guns were produced slowly and were tested afloat through the 1830s.

They formed a small part of the armament on larger ships, with only two or four guns being carried, although on smaller, experimental steam vessels they, and the much larger &quot;canon-obusier de 150&quot; of bore, were proportionately more important. The paddle steamer &quot;Météore&quot;, for example, carried three &quot;canon-obusier de 80&quot; pieces and six small carronades in 1833. Alongside the large guns which Paixhans had called for, the French navy also used a smaller shell gun, of the same bore as its standard solid shot-firing 30 pounder guns and carronades, in larger numbers with first rate ships carrying over 30 of these guns.

===United States===
The United States Navy adopted the design, and equipped several ships with 8-inch guns of 63 and 55 cwt. in 1845, and later a 10-inch shell gun of 86 cwt. Paixhans guns were used on USS &quot;Constitution&quot; (four Paixhans guns) in 1842, under the command of Foxhall A. Parker, Sr., USS &quot;Constellation&quot; in 1854, and were also installed on the USS &quot;Mississippi&quot; (10 Paixhans guns), and USS &quot;Susquehanna&quot; (six Paixhans guns) during Commodore Perry&#x27;s mission to open Japan in 1853.

The Dahlgren gun was developed by John A. Dahlgren in 1846, with advantages over Paixhans guns:


===Russia===
The Russian Navy was the first to use the guns extensively in combat. At the Battle of Sinop in 1853, Russian ships attacked and annihilated a Turkish fleet with their Paixhans explosive shell guns. The shells penetrated deep inside the wooden planking of Turkish ships, exploding and igniting the hulls. The defeat was instrumental in convincing the naval powers of the shell&#x27;s efficacy, and hastened the development of the ironclad to counter it.

<doc id="901260" wikidata="Q1037840" url="?curid=901260" title="Close-packing of equal spheres">
<text>In geometry, close-packing of equal [[sphere]]s is a dense arrangement of congruent spheres in an infinite, regular arrangement (or lattice). Carl Friedrich Gauss proved that the highest average density – that is, the greatest fraction of space occupied by spheres – that can be achieved by a lattice packing is
:formula_1.
The same packing density can also be achieved by alternate stackings of the same close-packed planes of spheres, including structures that are aperiodic in the stacking direction. The Kepler conjecture states that this is the highest density that can be achieved by any arrangement of spheres, either regular or irregular. This conjecture was proven by T. C. Hales. Highest density is known only for 1, 2, 3, 8, and 24 dimensions.

Many crystal structures are based on a close-packing of a single kind of atom, or a close-packing of large ions with smaller ions filling the spaces between them. The cubic and hexagonal arrangements are very close to one another in energy, and it may be difficult to predict which form will be preferred from first principles.

==FCC and HCP lattices==
There are two simple regular lattices that achieve this highest average density. They are called face-centered cubic (FCC) (also called cubic close packed) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP), based on their symmetry. Both are based upon sheets of spheres arranged at the vertices of a triangular tiling; they differ in how the sheets are stacked upon one another. The FCC lattice is also known to mathematicians as that generated by the A3 root system.

=== Cannonball problem ===
The problem of close-packing of spheres was first mathematically analyzed by Thomas Harriot around 1587, after a question on piling cannonballs on ships was posed to him by Sir Walter Raleigh on their expedition to America. 
Cannonballs were usually piled in a rectangular or triangular wooden frame, forming a three-sided or four-sided pyramid. Both arrangements produce a face-centered cubic lattice – with different orientation to the ground. Hexagonal close-packing would result in a six-sided pyramid with a hexagonal base. 
The cannonball problem asks which flat square arrangements of cannonballs can be stacked into a square pyramid. Édouard Lucas formulated the problem as the Diophantine equation formula_2 or formula_3 and conjectured that the only solutions are formula_4 and formula_5. Here formula_6 is the number of layers in the pyramidal stacking arrangement and formula_7 is the number of cannonballs along an edge in the flat square arrangement.
=== Positioning and spacing ===
In both the FCC and HCP arrangements each sphere has twelve neighbors. For every sphere there is one gap surrounded by six spheres (octahedral) and two smaller gaps surrounded by four spheres (tetrahedral). The distances to the centers of these gaps from the centers of the surrounding spheres is for the tetrahedral, and for the octahedral, when the sphere radius is 1.

Relative to a reference layer with positioning A, two more positionings B and C are possible. Every sequence of A, B, and C without immediate repetition of the same one is possible and gives an equally dense packing for spheres of a given radius.

The most regular ones are
*FCC = ABC ABC ABC... (every third layer is the same)
*HCP = AB AB AB AB... (every other layer is the same).

There is an uncountably infinite number of disordered arrangements of planes (e.g. ABCACBABABAC...) that are sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;Barlow packings&quot;, after crystallographer William Barlow.

In close-packing, the center-to-center spacing of spheres in the &quot;xy&quot; plane is a simple honeycomb-like tessellation with a pitch (distance between sphere centers) of one sphere diameter. The distance between sphere centers, projected on the &quot;z&quot; (vertical) axis, is:

:formula_8

where &quot;d&quot; is the diameter of a sphere; this follows from the tetrahedral arrangement of close-packed spheres.

The coordination number of HCP and FCC is 12 and their atomic packing factors (APFs) are equal to the number mentioned above, 0.74.




==Lattice generation==
When forming any sphere-packing lattice, the first fact to notice is that whenever two spheres touch a straight line may be drawn from the center of one sphere to the center of the other intersecting the point of contact. The distance between the centers along the shortest path namely that straight line will therefore be &quot;r&quot;1 + &quot;r&quot;2 where &quot;r&quot;1 is the radius of the first sphere and &quot;r&quot;2 is the radius of the second. In close packing all of the spheres share a common radius, &quot;r&quot;. Therefore, two centers would simply have a distance 2&quot;r&quot;.

===Simple HCP lattice===
To form an A-B-A-B-... hexagonal close packing of spheres, the coordinate points of the lattice will be the spheres&#x27; centers. Suppose, the goal is to fill a box with spheres according to HCP. The box would be placed on the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot;-&quot;z&quot; coordinate space.

First form a row of spheres. The centers will all lie on a straight line. Their &quot;x&quot;-coordinate will vary by 2&quot;r&quot; since the distance between each center of the spheres are touching is 2&quot;r&quot;. The &quot;y&quot;-coordinate and z-coordinate will be the same. For simplicity, say that the balls are the first row and that their &quot;y&quot;- and &quot;z&quot;-coordinates are simply &quot;r&quot;, so that their surfaces rest on the zero-planes. Coordinates of the centers of the first row will look like (2&quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot;), (4&quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot;), (6&quot;r&quot; ,&quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot;), (8&quot;r&quot; ,&quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot;), ... .

Now, form the next row of spheres. Again, the centers will all lie on a straight line with &quot;x&quot;-coordinate differences of 2&quot;r&quot;, but there will be a shift of distance &quot;r&quot; in the &quot;x&quot;-direction so that the center of every sphere in this row aligns with the &quot;x&quot;-coordinate of where two spheres touch in the first row. This allows the spheres of the new row to slide in closer to the first row until all spheres in the new row are touching two spheres of the first row. Since the new spheres &quot;touch&quot; two spheres, their centers form an equilateral triangle with those two neighbors&#x27; centers. The side lengths are all 2&quot;r&quot;, so the height or &quot;y&quot;-coordinate difference between the rows is &quot;r&quot;. Thus, this row will have coordinates like this:

: formula_9

The first sphere of this row only touches one sphere in the original row, but its location follows suit with the rest of the row.

The next row follows this pattern of shifting the &quot;x&quot;-coordinate by &quot;r&quot; and the &quot;y&quot;-coordinate by . Add rows until reaching the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; maximum borders of the box.

In an A-B-A-B-... stacking pattern, the odd numbered &quot;planes&quot; of spheres will have exactly the same coordinates save for a pitch difference in the &quot;z&quot;-coordinates and the even numbered &quot;planes&quot; of spheres will share the same &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-coordinates. Both types of planes are formed using the pattern mentioned above, but the starting place for the &quot;first&quot; row&#x27;s first sphere will be different.

Using the plane described precisely above as plane #1, the A plane, place a sphere on top of this plane so that it lies touching three spheres in the A-plane. The three spheres are all already touching each other, forming an equilateral triangle, and since they all touch the new sphere, the four centers form a regular tetrahedron. All of the sides are equal to 2&quot;r&quot; because all of the sides are formed by two spheres touching. The height of which or the &quot;z&quot;-coordinate difference between the two &quot;planes&quot; is . This, combined with the offsets in the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;-coordinates gives the centers of the first row in the B plane:

: formula_10

The second row&#x27;s coordinates follow the pattern first described above and are:

: formula_11

The difference to the next plane, the A plane, is again in the &quot;z&quot;-direction and a shift in the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; to match those &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-coordinates of the first A plane.

In general, the coordinates of sphere centers can be written as:

: formula_12

where &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are indices starting at 0 for the &quot;x&quot;-, &quot;y&quot;- and &quot;z&quot;-coordinates.

==Miller indices==
Crystallographic features of HCP systems, such as vectors and atomic plane families, can be described using a four-value Miller index notation ( &quot;hkil&quot; ) in which the third index &quot;i&quot; denotes a degenerate but convenient component which is equal to −&quot;h&quot; − &quot;k&quot;. The &quot;h&quot;, &quot;i&quot; and &quot;k&quot; index directions are separated by 120°, and are thus not orthogonal; the &quot;l&quot; component is mutually perpendicular to the &quot;h&quot;, &quot;i&quot; and &quot;k&quot; index directions.

== Filling the remaining space ==
The FCC and HCP packings are the densest known packings of equal spheres with the highest symmetry (smallest repeat units).
Denser sphere packings are known, but they involve unequal sphere packing.
A packing density of 1, filling space completely, requires non-spherical shapes, such as honeycombs.

Replacing each contact point between two spheres with an edge connecting the centers of the touching spheres produces tetrahedrons and octahedrons of equal edge lengths.
The FCC arrangement produces the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb.
The HCP arrangement produces the gyrated tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb.
If, instead, every sphere is augmented with the points in space that are closer to it than to any other sphere, the duals of these honeycombs are produced: the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb for FCC, and the trapezo-rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb for HCP.

Spherical bubbles appear in soapy water in a FCC or HCP arrangement when the water in the gaps between the bubbles drains out. This pattern also approaches the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb or trapezo-rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb. However, such FCC or HCP foams of very small liquid content are unstable, as they do not satisfy Plateau&#x27;s laws. The Kelvin foam and the Weaire–Phelan foam are more stable, having smaller interfacial energy in the limit of a very small liquid content.

There are two types of interstitial holes left by hcp and fcc conformations; tetrahedral and octahedral void. Four spheres surround the tetrahedral hole with three spheres being in one layer and one sphere from the next layer. Six spheres surround an octahedral voids with three spheres coming from one layer and three spheres coming from the next layer. Structures of many simple chemical compounds, for instance, are often described in terms of small atoms occupying tetrahedral or octahedral holes in closed-packed systems that are formed from larger atoms.

Layered structures are formed by alternating empty and filled octahedral planes. Two octahedral layers usually allow for four structural arrangements that can either be filled by an hpc of fcc packing systems. In filling tetrahedral holes a complete filling leads to fcc field array. In unit cells, hole filling can sometimes lead to polyhedral arrays with a mix of hcp and fcc layering.

<doc id="901267" wikidata="Q727653" url="?curid=901267" title="Théophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne">
<text>Théophile Malo Corret de la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne (; 23 November 174328 June 1800) was a French officer named by Napoleon as the &quot;first grenadier of France&quot;. He was also a celtomaniac antiquarian who introduced the words &quot;dolmen&quot; and &quot;menhir&quot; into general archaeological usage.

== Career ==

He was the son of a lawyer named Corret, and was certainly baptised and perhaps born at Carhaix-Plouguer in Brittany, though nearby Saint-Hernin where his father had a position is one of a number of other places in the area put forward as his place of birth. His desire for a military career being strongly marked, he was enabled by the not uncommon device of producing a certificate of nobility signed by his friends, first to be nominally enlisted in the Maison du Roi, and soon afterwards to receive a commission in the line, under the name of Corret de Kerbaufret. Four years after joining, in 1771, he assumed with the help of a letter from the Duke of Bouillon the surname of La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, claiming descent from an illegitimate half-brother of the great Marshal Henri de la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne, one of Louis XIV&#x27;s leading commanders. Many years of routine service with his regiment were broken only by his participation as a volunteer in the Duke de Crillon&#x27;s Franco-Spanish expedition to Menorca in 1781. This led to an offer of promotion into the Spanish army, but he refused to change his allegiance.

In 1784 he was promoted captain, and in 1791 he received the Cross of St. Louis. In the early part of the French Revolution his patriotism was still more conspicuously displayed in his resolute opposition to the proposals of many of his brother officers in the Angoumois regiment to emigrate rather than to swear to the constitution, and he fought in the revolutionary army in the French Revolutionary Wars, refusing promotion beyond the grade of captain. In 1792 his lifelong interest in numismatics and questions of language was shown by a work which he published on the Bretons. At this time he was serving under Montesquiou in the Alps, and although there was only outpost fighting he distinguished himself by his courage and audacity, qualities which were displayed in more serious fighting in the Pyrenees the next year. He declined well-earned promotion to colonel, and, being broken in health and compelled, owing to the loss of his teeth, to live on milk, he left the army in 1795.

On his return by sea to Brittany he was captured by the English and held prisoner for two years. When released, he settled at Passy and published &quot;Origines gauloises&quot; (1796). In 1797, on the appeal of an old friend whose son had been taken as a conscript, he volunteered as the youth&#x27;s substitute, and served on the Rhine (1797) and in Switzerland (1798–1799) as a captain. In recognition of his singular bravery and modesty Corret obtained a decree from Napoleon naming him the &quot;first grenadier of France&quot; (27 April 1800). This led him to volunteer again, and he was killed in action at the Battle of Neuburg on 27 June 1800.

== Memory ==

La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne&#x27;s almost legendary courage had captivated the imagination of the French soldier, and his memory was not allowed to die. It was customary for the French troops and their allies of the Rhine Confederation under Napoleon to march at attention when passing his burial place on the battlefield. His heart was long carried by the grenadier company of his regiment, the 46th. After being in the possession of Giuseppe Garibaldi for many years, it was finally deposited in the keeping of the city of Paris in 1883.

In 1800 Napoleon ordered, &quot;His name is to be kept on the pay list and roll of his company. It will be called at all parades and a non-commissioned officer will reply, &quot; &#x27;Mort au champ d&#x27;honneur.&#x27; &quot;&quot; This custom, with little variation, is still observed in the 46th regiment on all occasions when the color is taken on parade. However, in early 1809, Napoleon himself put this tradition to an end. &quot;What regiment has not had a general, a colonel, or finally, a brave man killed at its head? I have tolerated this singularity long enough&quot; (Nap. Corr., vol 18, No. 14727). The urn was collected by the War Minister, showing that Napoleon preferred to celebrate the men who died to affirm his dynasty and build his Empire, rather than an individual whose association with the French Revolution was unmistakable.

<text>Busselton is a city in the South West region of the state of Western Australia approximately south-west of Perth. Busselton has a long history as a popular holiday destination for Western Australians; however, the closure of the Busselton Port in 1972 and the contemporaneous establishment of the nearby Margaret River wine region have seen tourism become the dominant source of investment and development, supplemented by services and retail. The city is best known for the Busselton Jetty, the longest wooden jetty in the Southern Hemisphere.

==History==
===Pre European settlement and 19th century===
Before white settlement in 1832, and for at least 40,000 years, the Busselton area was home to the Noongar Aboriginal people from the Wardandi and Bibulman language/ancestral groups. The colonisation of Western Australia in 1829 had a major impact on the life of the Noongar people. Many towns in the Busselton area, such as Wonnerup, Yallingup and Carbunup River, still hold their original Noongar names. The Wonnerup massacre of Wardandi Noongar people by European settlers occurred in the vicinity of Wonnerup in 1841.

The early history of European exploration of the Busselton area focused on the French expedition of 1801 which brought Nicholas Baudin, with his ships &quot;Géographe&quot; and &quot;Naturaliste&quot;, to the coast of Western Australia. Baudin named Geographe Bay and Cape Naturaliste after his vessels, and named the river Vasse after a sailor, Thomas Vasse, who was lost as he went overboard and was believed to have drowned.

Busselton was one of the earliest settlements in Western Australia. It was first settled by the Bussell family, George Layman, and the Chapman brothers, who relocated there from their location on the Blackwood River. John Garrett Bussell first visited Busselton in December 1831, describing the land as follows: &quot;The country as we advanced improved rapidly; the ground on which we trod was a vivid green, unsullied with burnt sticks and blackened grass trees&quot;. Bussell was granted land in the area in July 1832 and the settlers moved there in April 1834. The Bussells established a cattle station which they named Cattle Chosen, which quickly became one of the most prosperous stations in the colony, and as a result, nearly all of the settlers at Augusta relocated to the area within a few years. A number of settlers established themselves at Wonnerup, and eventually a contingent of troops was stationed there under Lieutenant Henry Bunbury. It was originally intended to locate the townsite at Wonnerup, but the area was low-lying and marshy, and Bunbury considered it unsuitable for a townsite. The present area was then recommended by the Surveyor General, John Septimus Roe.

The present name of Busselton derives from the Bussell family. It was first officially used in June 1835. The Bussells, who were not consulted about the name, preferred the name Capel after a relative in England, Capel Carter, but the name Busselton was retained. A town named Capel was later established to the north of Busselton. The name &quot;The Vasse&quot; was also used for the district interchangeably with &quot;Busselton&quot; until the end of the 19th century. The townsite was planned and surveyed in 1836 by Bunbury and in 1839, by which time it had a population of 77, it was laid out by surveyor Henry Ommaney. This was followed by the opening of the post office in 1842 and St Mary&#x27;s Church in 1845. In 1847, the town was officially gazetted as Busselton, and the first government-assisted school was opened there in 1848. In the early days of the settlement, and for some time afterwards, the area was visited by whaling ships from the US, France, and England. The Americans in particular traded with the settlers, who gained vital supplies such as iron, flour, and clothing in exchange for fresh food; there was also a trade in smuggled rum and tobacco. The American whalers delivered mail to England via the US, providing an alternative to infrequent government schooners. Visits from foreign whalers declined in the 1860s due to the introduction of fossil fuels to replace whale oil, but a nearby whaling group in what is now part of the Meelup Regional Park, the Castle Bay Whaling Company, survived until 1872.

Being in close proximity to the tall timber country, Busselton soon established itself as a leading port. In 1850, timber was being exported and the small town prospered. Jetties for this purpose were built at Wonnerup, Busselton, and Quindalup. Of these, only the Busselton Jetty remains. During the 1850s, Busselton began to receive convicts who were beginning to arrive in Western Australia; they particularly helped with the timber industry. Western Australia&#x27;s first railway line, the Ballaarat tramline, was built just north of Busselton at Lockville in 1871, the original engine being known as the Ballaarat steam engine. The privately owned line was used for the transport of timber to the Wonnerup jetty across the Ballaarat Bridge. By the 1880s Busselton had a regular mail and passenger coach service from Perth and Bunbury and, in 1894, a passenger rail service commenced between Busselton and Bunbury on the South Western Railway via Boyanup; it operated until 1985.

===Federation to present day===
By the early 20th century, Busselton had become well known as a resort town, aided by the railway along with the 1890s Western Australian gold rushes, which greatly increased the state&#x27;s population and prosperity. Caves in the area of what is now the Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park including Yallingup Cave (now Ngilgi Cave) had been discovered and developed, and the strip of coastline between Cape Yallingup and Cape Naturaliste had become popular for camping and seaside holidays. The 1913 &quot;Cyclopedia of Western Australia&quot; stated:Busselton which has come to be known as the sanatorium of Western Australia lies within the shelter of Geographe Bay some 30 miles south of Bunbury. Up to some 20 years ago, it was merely a charming country village, with grass-grown streets where arum lilies rioted in profusion. ... Its cool temperate climate, excellent beach and well-established bathing facilities have made it one of the favourite summer resorts. If to these we add the caves reached daily by motor service from the town and, in addition to the scenery, this excellent boating, bathing and fishing, Busselton can probably claim to be the most favoured haunt of the holiday seeker.Busselton began to grow significantly when the Group Settlement Scheme brought people to the area between 1923 and 1926; nine of the first sixteen groups were organised in the Busselton area. In about 1927, the Flinders Bay branch railway was developed, which connected Busselton to Flinders Bay; it was closed around 1957. In the 1930s, agricultural prices dropped due to the Great Depression, causing many people to leave the area. During World War II, 476 Busselton-born men signed up for service; 20 in the Royal Australian Navy, 110 in the Royal Australian Air Force, and 346 in the Australian Army. The names of the fallen are displayed on the town&#x27;s war memorial alongside those of World War I in St Marys Park. During the war, Busselton was home to an Air Force training base; remains of the base can still be seen today from the Busselton Bypass Road. A Royal Australian Air Force P-51 Mustang fighter was given the nickname &quot;Busselton&quot; in honour of the people of Busselton and their support of War Loan fundraising activities.

In the 1950s many facilities for holiday-makers were built west of Busselton and the 1960s saw the beginnings of the professional fishing industry and, in particular, the Margaret River wine region, which greatly increased tourist numbers in and around Busselton. The Busselton port closed in 1972. From the 1970s Busselton began growing particularly as a tourism centre and retirement location. By 1996 it had become one of the fastest-growing areas in Western Australia. In 2012, the Shire of Busselton gained city status.

==Geography==
Busselton is in the South West region of Western Australia, about south-west of Perth. The city is composed of a city centre along with the suburbs of Abbey, Ambergate, Bovell, Broadwater, Geographe, Kealy, Vasse, West Busselton, and Yalyalup. It is bordered by Geographe Bay to the north, with urban development traditionally being concentrated on the bay, extending from Abbey in the west to Geographe in the east. Urban development south of this area has traditionally been obstructed by wetlands and estuaries; however, since the 1980s, development has taken place to the south of these waterway systems. The Vasse River flows through the city to the Vasse-Wonnerup Estuary; reserves adjoining this estuary to the north form Busselton&#x27;s eastern border. The city&#x27;s western border is formed by The corner of Caves Road and Bussell Highway. Caves Road leads to the nearby town of Dunsborough, which is separated from Busselton by a green belt, notably including the Locke Estate, known locally as the &quot;Holy Mile&quot;. Busselton&#x27;s nearest city is Bunbury which is north-east of Busselton.

=== Climate ===
Busselton has a borderline warm/hot summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;/&quot;Csa&quot;), depending on the recording station used, as the warmest months have mean temperatures around , the cut-off mark between these two climate types. The Bureau of Meteorology has had three major temperature-recording sites in Busselton: the Busselton Shire office, with temperatures recorded from 1900 to 1975 and rainfall from 1877 to the present, Busselton Town near The Busselton District Hospital site on Mill Road in West Busselton (recording from 1998 to 2011), and the Busselton Margaret River Airport, east of the Busselton Shire station (recording since 1997). Wind observations have been made at Busselton Jetty since 1997, and temperature observations have been made in the general area at Ludlow, Jarrahwood, and Cape Naturaliste. Summers are generally warm to hot with afternoon sea breezes, with average daily maxima of at the shire station and at the airport station, and a winter that delivers cooler temperatures of and wetter weather. The annual average rainfall at the Busselton Shire station is , with the wettest period being from May to September.

The 2021 Australian census recorded Busselton&#x27;s population as 27,233, 67.0% of the population of the City of Busselton local government area, which was 40,640. The 2021 census also recorded Busselton&#x27;s median age as 45, higher than the national average of 38. Australian-born residents made up 75.9% of Busselton&#x27;s population, followed by those born in England (7.8%), New Zealand (2.3%), South Africa (1.1%), Scotland (0.7%), and the Philippines (0.5%). English was the only language spoken at home by 89.5% of residents, with the next most common languages being Afrikaans and German (0.5%), Italian and Hazaragi (0.3%), and French (0.2%). The most common industry for employed people in Busselton was listed as &quot;accommodation&quot; at 3.7%, compared to the national average of 0.9%; others were cafes and restaurants&quot; (3.6%), &quot;supermarket and grocery stores&quot; (3.5%), &quot;iron ore mining&quot; on a fly-in fly-out basis (3.2%), and &quot;hospitals (except psychiatric hospitals)&quot; (3.2%).

At the 2021 census the combined population of the Busselton East and Busselton West statistical areas was 28651.
It has been estimated that by 2050 Busselton&#x27;s population will be between 50,000 and 70,000, with the local government area containing between 70,000 and 100,000 people.

==== Busselton Jetty ====
Busselton is home to the longest wooden jetty (pier) in the Southern Hemisphere, stretching out to sea. Construction of the jetty began in 1864 and it was continually extended until the 1960s, when it reached its current length. It was closed to shipping in 1972, and maintenance was discontinued for a time. Following major damage caused by Cyclone Alby in 1978 and a fire in 1999, it was restored and improved. Since 2003, the jetty has offered visitors a tourist train ride, an underwater observatory, and an interpretive centre.

==== Wonnerup House ====
The current Wonnerup House was built in 1859 by the Layman family (original settlers). The original building built between 1837 and 1841 was destroyed by fire in 1858. The complex also includes the dairy and kitchen, which antedate the main house (and survived the fire of 1858 because they were separate buildings). Over the road are the Teacher&#x27;s House (1885) and School (1873). Since 1973, the National Trust of Australia has operated the property as a museum open to the public.

====Old Butter Factory/Busselton Museum====
The Old Butter Factory was built in 1918 by the government Department of Agriculture to replace a previous privately owned dairy, Western Australia&#x27;s first butter factory and creamery, that was established in 1898. In 1926 the factory was sold to South-West Dairy Produce Co-operative, which was later renamed &quot;Sunny West&quot; and merged into Wesfarmers. The factory also operated as an ice works for local residents and fishermen before the widespread availability of mechanical refrigeration. It ceased butter-making operations in 1952 and became a cream depot and dried milk plant, then a truck depot. In 1974 it was sold to the Shire of Busselton, which leased most of the building to the Busselton Historical Society; they opened the Busselton Museum there in 1975. It was listed on the state&#x27;s Register of Heritage Places in 2002. In March 2018, the building was heavily damaged by fire. the outside areas were re-opened in January 2019 and the rest of the building was opened in December 2020.

==== St Mary&#x27;s (Church of England) ====

St Mary&#x27;s (Church of England), built in 1844–1845,
is allegedly the oldest stone church in Western Australia. John Molloy and John Garrett Bussell were the main forces behind the construction of the church. The church was not consecrated until 1848 and a clergyman was not attracted to the region for another decade. Alongside the church is a graveyard; some of the graves date back to 1841 – before the building of the church.

==== Ithaca (Villa Carlotta) ====
Ithaca (formerly known as Villa Carlotta) is located at 110 Adelaide St, Busselton, and was built by Frank Backhouse in 1896. Ithaca is listed on the state&#x27;s Register of Heritage Places in recognition of its significant historical and community values. Ithaca has a two-storey tower and was originally built as a private residence; in 1904, Ithaca was acquired by Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions for use as a Catholic convent. Subsequently, it has been a school and a hotel, and now is a motel.

==== Weld Hall ====
Weld Hall located on the corner of Queen and Adelaide St was built in 1881. In August 2001, the Western Australian government announced that Weld Hall had been listed on the Register of Heritage Places in recognition of its significant historical and cultural value to the local community. The hall is a single-storey brick building with a galvanised roof, and is constructed in a simplified Victorian Italianate style; it is one of the oldest remaining structures in the town.

==== Augusta-Busselton Heritage Trail ====
The trail retraces the Pioneer Route from Augusta to Busselton taken by the original settlers in the 1800s. It is over 100 km long, starting at the jetty and finishing in Augusta.

<text>Marília () is a Brazilian municipality in the midwestern region of the state of São Paulo. Its distance from the state capital São Paulo is by highway, by railway and in a straight line. It is located at an altitude of 675 meters. The population is 240,590 (2020 est.) in an area of 1170 km2.

The municipality is emerging as an educational hub in São Paulo, with four public technical and higher education institutions (Unesp, Famema, Univesp and Fatec) and private institutions such as Unimar, Faef, Univem and Anhanguera. In 2017, 74 undergraduate courses were offered, with administration and pedagogy being the most offered. Marília has an average of one university student for every 18 inhabitants. The municipality also has the rural scientific research unit Agência Paulista de Tecnologia dos Agronegócios/APTA Regional de Marília).

==History==
In 1923, Antônio Pereira da Silva and his son José Pereira da Silva were the pioneers of the region, cleared land next to Feio and Peixe rivers. This land was named Alto Cafezal, or &quot;High Coffee Plantation&quot;.

A city of Araraquara region deputy at the time, Bento de Abreu Sampaio Vidal held in 1926 a parcel of their assets.

In 1927, Colonel José Brás or Jose&#x27; da Silva Nogueira whose family origin in Itapetininga, arrived in Marilia. His family held 40% of the farm land named Bonfim, and the process of urbanization began with the allotment of this farm.

Companhia Paulista Railway had been advancing its tracks from São Paulo to get to the town of Lácio, and in accordance with its plan, the roads that were being opened at the branch were named in alphabetical order. The next branch should have its name beginning with the letter &quot;M.&quot; &quot;Maratona&quot;, &quot;Mogúncio&quot; and &quot;Macau&quot; were suggested, but Vidal was not satisfied with them. So, in one of his trips to Europe by ship, as he read Tomás Antônio Gonzaga&#x27;s &quot;Marília de Dirceu&quot;, he chose the name Marília from the poetry book.

The city of Marília was created with this name by State Law No. 2161 on December 22, 1926, but remained as a borough of Cafelândia. In 1928, Marília was raised to the status of municipality by State Law No. 2320 of December 24. Its anniversary is celebrated on April 4, 1929.

At first, the economy of Marília was based on the cultivation of coffee, being replaced by cotton. The financial success originated from this latter crop led to the installation of the first two industries in the city (two cottonseed oil) in the mid-1930s. With the expansion of the industrialization in São Paulo state, rail and highways were also built, thereby linking Marilia to various regions of the state of São Paulo and northern Paraná.

In the 1940s the city established itself as a development of the West Paulista, when there was a large and growing urban population.

In the 1970s, there was a new industrial cycle in the city with the installation of new industries, specially food processing and welding. With the subsequent installation of several university courses, Marília attracted more people to the region, which accelerated the development of the city as a commercial &amp; industrial hub.

Marília today has approximately 50 food industries in the area and it is known as the &quot;National Capital of Food Processing.&quot;

<text>George Bassett Clark (February 14, 1827 – December 20, 1891) was an American instrument maker and astronomer.

Born in Lowell, Massachusetts and educated at Phillips Academy, Andover, he was the son of Alvan Clark, part of a family of refracting telescope makers in the 19th century. In 1846, George Bassett Clark joined his father and brother at the family&#x27;s telescope works in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The firm, Alvan Clark &amp; Sons, made many of the record-breaking refracting instruments, including the still-largest refracting telescope at the Yerkes Observatory, gaining &quot;worldwide fame and distribution&quot;, wrote one author on astronomy in 1899. Clark was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1878.

<text>Times Square Church is an interdenominational congregation located at the Mark Hellinger Theatre on 237 West 51st Street in the Theater District of Manhattan in New York City. Times Square Church was founded by Pastor David Wilkerson in 1987 and bought the Mark Hellinger Theatre in 1991.

==Church history==
The Times Square Church was founded by David Wilkerson in 1987. At the time, Times Square was known as a center of X-rated films, strip clubs, prostitution, and drug addiction. Wilkerson opened the church in response to what he described as &quot;the physically destitute and spiritually dead people&quot; he saw among the pimps, runaways and crack dealers who populated the area. The Times Square Church briefly held its services at Town Hall on 43rd Street in Manhattan and then in the Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street.

In 1989 the church leased the former Mark Hellinger Theatre. Times Square Church purchased the building from the Nederlander Organization for an undisclosed amount in 1991. At the time, the value of the building was estimated to be between $15 million–$18 million. Upon its purchase, Pastor Donald W. Wilkerson, brother of David Wilkerson and one of the church leaders, declared that the theater would not be altered, saying &quot;The theater is landmarked and it will remain the same.&quot; The church was described as an evangelical pentecostal church headed by three pastors: David Wilkerson, his brother, Donald Wilkerson, and Robert Phillips. The theater is still the church&#x27;s current location on 51st Street.

In 2001, David Wilkerson entrusted the senior pastorate to Carter Conlon, formerly an evangelical pastor from eastern Canada and associate pastor at Times Square Church from 1994-2001. There are also visiting ministers and missionaries who come to preach from all over the world. The church places an emphasis on prayer and even has a &quot;prayer during preaching ministry&quot;. There are also high school and young adults programs to teach the truth and love in the Word of God.

From 2007 to 2009 the church organized an event called &quot;Prayer in the Square&quot;, a prayer rally which took place in Times Square.

On May 5, 2020, Tim Dilena became Senior Pastor, the third since the church’s founding. He had a lifelong association with founding pastor David Wilkerson and has regularly preached at the church for many years.

==Building==


The Mark Hellinger Theatre was originally built by Warner Bros. in 1930 as a movie palace, the Warner Hollywood Theatre, which was later converted to a Broadway venue. It has 1,603 seats. Notable Broadway musicals that have played at the theater include &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, and the Katharine Hepburn musical &quot;Coco&quot;.

<doc id="901291" wikidata="Q423971" url="?curid=901291" title="Sodium benzoate">
<text>Sodium benzoate also known as benzoate of soda is the sodium salt of benzoic acid, widely used as a food preservative (with an E number of E211) and a pickling agent. It appears as a white crystalline chemical with the formula C6H5COONa.

==Production==
Sodium benzoate is commonly produced by the neutralization of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with benzoic acid (C6H5COOH), which is itself produced commercially by partial oxidation of toluene with oxygen.

== Reactions ==
Sodium benzoate can be decarboxylated with strong base and heat, yielding benzene:

==Natural occurrence==
Sodium benzoate is not a naturally occurring substance. However many foods are natural sources of benzoic acid, its salts, and its esters. Fruits and vegetables can be rich sources, particularly berries such as cranberry and bilberry. Other sources include seafood, such as prawns, and dairy products.

==Uses==
===As a preservative===
Sodium benzoate can act as a food preservative. It is most widely used in acidic foods such as salad dressings (for example acetic acid in vinegar), carbonated drinks (carbonic acid), jams and fruit juices (citric acid), pickles (acetic acid), condiments, and frozen yogurt toppings. It is also used as a preservative in medicines and cosmetics. Under these conditions it is converted into benzoic acid (E210), which is bacteriostatic and fungistatic. Benzoic acid is generally not used directly due to its poor water solubility.
Concentration as a food preservative is limited by the FDA in the U.S. to 0.1% by weight. Sodium benzoate is also allowed as an animal food additive at up to 0.1%, per the Association of American Feed Control Officials.
Sodium benzoate has been replaced by potassium sorbate in the majority of soft drinks in the United Kingdom.

In the 19th century, sodium benzoate as a food ingredient was investigated by Harvey W. Wiley with his &#x27;Poison Squad&#x27; as part of the US Department of Agriculture. This led to the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, a key event in the early history of food regulation in the United States.

===In pharmaceuticals===
Sodium benzoate is used as a treatment for urea cycle disorders due to its ability to bind amino acids. This leads to excretion of these amino acids and a decrease in ammonia levels. Recent research shows that sodium benzoate may be beneficial as an add-on therapy (1 gram/day) in schizophrenia. Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores dropped by 21% compared to placebo.

Sodium benzoate, along with phenylbutyrate, is used to treat hyperammonemia.

Sodium benzoate, along with caffeine, is used to treat postdural puncture headache, respiratory depression associated with overdosage of narcotics, and with ergotamine to treat vascular headache.

===Other uses===
Sodium benzoate is also used in fireworks as a fuel in whistle mix, a powder that emits a whistling noise when compressed into a tube and ignited.

==Mechanism of food preservation==
The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the intracellular pH falls to 5 or lower, the anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase decreases sharply, which inhibits the growth and survival of microorganisms that cause food spoilage.

==Health and safety==

In the United States, sodium benzoate is designated as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration. The International Programme on Chemical Safety found no adverse effects in humans at doses of 647–825 mg/kg of body weight per day.

Cats have a significantly lower tolerance against benzoic acid and its salts than rats and mice.

The human body rapidly clears sodium benzoate by combining it with glycine to form hippuric acid which is then excreted. The metabolic pathway for this begins with the conversion of benzoate by butyrate-CoA ligase into an intermediate product, benzoyl-CoA, which is then metabolized by glycine &quot;N&quot;-acyltransferase into hippuric acid.

===Association with benzene in soft drinks and pepper sauces===

In combination with ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300), sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate may form benzene. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration tested 100 beverages available in the United States that contained both ascorbic acid and benzoate. Four had benzene levels that were above the 5 ppb Maximum Contaminant Level set by the Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water. Most of the beverages that tested above the limit have been reformulated and subsequently tested below the safety limit. Heat, light and shelf life can increase the rate at which benzene is formed. Hot peppers naturally contain vitamin C (&quot;nearly as much as in one orange&quot;) so the observation about beverages applies to pepper sauces containing sodium benzoate, like Texas Pete.

===ADHD and hyperactivity===
Research published, including in 2007 for the UK&#x27;s Food Standards Agency (FSA) suggests that certain artificial colors, when paired with sodium benzoate, may be linked to hyperactive behavior and other ADHD symptoms. The results were inconsistent regarding sodium benzoate, so the FSA recommended further study. The Food Standards Agency concluded that the observed increases in hyperactive behavior, if real, were more likely to be linked to the artificial colors than to sodium benzoate. The report&#x27;s author, Jim Stevenson from Southampton University, said: &quot;The results suggest that consumption of certain mixtures of artificial food colours and sodium benzoate preservative are associated with increases in hyperactive behaviour in children. . . . Many other influences are at work but this at least is one a child can avoid.&quot;

<text>Fort McPherson was a U.S. Army military base located in Atlanta, Georgia, bordering the northern edge of the city of East Point, Georgia. It was the headquarters for the U.S. Army Installation Management Command, Southeast Region; the U.S. Army Forces Command; the U.S. Army Reserve Command; the U.S. Army Central. Situated on and located four miles (6 km) southwest of the center of Atlanta, Fort McPherson has history as an army post dating back to 1867.

== History ==

Named after Major General James Birdseye McPherson, the fort was founded by the U.S. Army in September 1867 on the grounds where Spelman College is now located. During the Reconstruction Era, between 1867 and 1881, it was named the &quot;McPherson Barracks&quot;, and served as a post for U.S. troops in Atlanta, garrisoning elements of the 2nd, 16th and 18th U.S. Infantry Regiments and the 5th Artillery during their mission to enforce U.S. regulations after the American Civil War. 

With the end of Reconstruction, the barracks were closed and sold off in 1881, though the site continued to be used during summers by U.S. troops stationed in Florida. In 1885, the land was again purchased by the Army at which to station ten Army companies.

During World War I, Fort McPherson was used as a camp for Imperial German Navy prisoners of war and as a training site for the Active Army and Georgia National Guard. A rifle range was operated along the ridge where current Stanton road now exists. The deploying officers and NCOs surveyed the local Civil War entrenchments parallel to the railroad along Utoy Creek to learn about trench warfare.

During the General Textile Workers Strike in 1934, the fort was used as a detention center to hold picketers who had been arrested while striking at a cotton mill in Newnan, Georgia.

Fort McPherson&#x27;s nearest Army neighbor, and its sub-post, was Fort Gillem, previously established as the Atlanta Army Depot in 1941, is located in Forest Park, Georgia, approximately 11 miles to the southeast. Fort Gillem was a logistical support base, housing some Army, Department of Defense, and other government agencies. Those units include the First Army, the U.S. Army and Air Force Exchange Distribution Center, the Military Entrance Processing Station, and the U.S. Army Second Recruiting Brigade. Fort Gillem was also the host to the only crime lab of the U.S. Army. Fort McPherson and Fort Gillem shared most common services. Since the closure of Fort McPherson, Fort Gillem has been reduced to the Gillem Enclave partnership with Fort Gordon, both due to the 2005 BRAC commission.

In 2007, 2,453 active duty soldiers and 3,784 civilian employees were at both forts, with a total active duty and civilian employee payroll of $529,874,972.

With only 102 family quarters and 272 single soldier billets at Fort McPherson, and 10 family quarters at Fort Gillem, the active duty military and Department of the Army civilian employees lived in civilian housing in the surrounding Fulton, DeKalb, Clayton, Fayette, and Henry Counties.

Other important users of the fort facilities were the 98,700 or more Atlanta area military and naval retirees and their family members. These residents live mostly in Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb, Clayton, Fayette, Gwinnett, and Henry counties.

=== Transportation ===

For urban mass transit, Fort McPherson was mostly served by the Lakewood/Fort McPherson MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority) station.

=== After closure ===

On June 26, 2015, Fort Mac LRA became the owner of 145 acres of property on the former Fort McPherson in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. Fort Mac LRA is responsible for ensuring quality reuse and redevelopment of 145 acres on the former Army post. The Fort Mac LRA board of directors are nominated by the Mayor of Atlanta, the Fulton County Commission or the Governor. In June 2015, 330 acres of Fort McPherson was purchased by actor/producer Tyler Perry to be the new home of Tyler Perry Studios.

== 2005 Base realignment and closure (BRAC) ==

As a result of the BRAC 2005 recommendation, Fort McPherson was closed down September 15, 2011, and Fort Gillem reduced to a military enclave.

=== Units relocated ===

The following units were relocated in the late 2010s from Fort McPherson: the Headquarters of the U.S. Army Forces Command and the Headquarters of the U.S. Army Reserve Command, were moved to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The Headquarters, U.S. Army Central, was moved to Shaw Air Force Base, Sumter, South Carolina. The Installation Management Command, Southeast Region and the U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command, Southeastern Region were moved to Fort Eustis, Virginia. The Army Contracting Agency, Southern Region Office, was moved to Fort Sam Houston, Texas.

The following Fort Gillem units were relocated in the late 2010s: Headquarters, First Army, to Rock Island Arsenal, Ill.; 2nd Recruiting Brigade to Redstone Arsenal, Ala.; the 52nd Ordnance Group (EOD) to Fort Campbell, Ky.; the 81st Regional Readiness Command Equipment Concentration Site to Fort Benning, Ga.; and the U.S. Army Central Headquarters support office to Shaw Air Force Base, S.C. The Army and Air Force Exchange Service Atlanta Distribution Center will cease operations and the Federal Emergency Management Agency will move off the installation.

Fort Gillem became a contiguous enclave for the Georgia Army National Guard, the remainder of the 81st RRC units, the Criminal Investigation Division Forensics Laboratory and the Navy&#x27;s Reserve Intelligence Area 14, which relocated from Naval Air Station Atlanta. Units have requested discretionary moves into the enclave, included the Atlanta Fraud Residence Agency, the Southeastern Fraud Field Office, the South East Regional Storage Management Office and the Civil Support Readiness Group-East.

=== Forest Park/Fort Gillem Redevelopment ===
The Forest Park/Fort Gillem Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) primary development objectives were to stimulate economic growth, create a high-value redevelopment plan; improve education, quality of life, and the perception of the area and ensure one community. The redevelopment plan adopted was primarily light industrial and logistical, with a smattering of commercial, residential, and retail space.

=== McPherson Redevelopment ===
The McPherson Planning Local Redevelopment Authority (MPLRA) was the entity authorized by the Department of Defense after 2005 to develop a plan for what was to become of Fort McPherson after the base was closed. It was a multijurisdictional body representing surrounding communities impacted by the base closure. It bought the land for about $30 million. The MPLRA executive board approved a reuse plan in September 2007 with a science and technology park and a mix of shops, residences and office space:

* An employment district of approximately , envisioned as a biomedical research park. The research park would be anchored by state investment and contain Georgia University system components. It is ultimately planned to include approximately of office and lab space and more than 1,900 units of high-density residential space. The research park will be developed by a task force that includes the University System Board of Regents, local governmental entities and private partners.
* A mixed-use, high-density retail area about in size. This high-density area is seen as a &quot;Main Street&quot; development with a mid-rise residential area, a hotel, public plazas and street-level retail, restaurants, offices, and grocery stores.
* A historic district covering approximately . Most of the buildings in this area are already on the National Register of Historic Places. This district centers on the existing parade ground and is expected to be developed for mixed use, but with a historical cultural theme. Within the historic district, Staff Row would be preserved and used for single-family residential or other complementary uses.
* Other areas will be home for up to 4,600 units of residential housing, a balanced mix of market rate, high-end housing, affordable housing, and housing for the formerly homeless or families at risk of homelessness.
* Approximately would be set aside for green space. This would connect to the historic area to create a public-oriented Linear Park centerpiece that wraps around the entire property from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) station on the north to the MARTA station on the south. Together with the residential districts, this green space would replace an area dominated by a golf course and include a space of approximately to be used for special events and festivals.
* The Department of Defense transferred 10 acres of land and six buildings of Fort McPherson to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. The Atlanta VA Fort McPherson campus provides services to the Atlanta veterans community such as the Fort McPherson VA Clinic, VA Domiciliary Residential Rehab Treatment Program, Healthcare for Homeless Veterans HCHV, Community Resource and Referral Center CRRC.

In August 2014, a plan to sell a large portion of McPherson to filmmaker Tyler Perry became public. State Senator Vincent Fort and residents called for more transparency.

== Units ==

=== Installation Management Command, Southeast Region ===

The Installation Management Command, Southeast Region (IMCOM-SE), is located in Building 171 at Fort McPherson and has the
function of managing Army installations in the southeastern United States and Puerto Rico. IMCOM-SE provides all base operations, public works and family support programs, ensuring the readiness of Soldiers, Families and military units. It has more than 15,000 employees across the southeast and manages a $2.2 billion annual operating budget.

The region is responsible for, delivering to standard, all facets of installation support, including care of Soldiers and Families; morale, welfare and recreation; education services, food and laundry; religious support; force protection; fire and emergency services; public works; environmental; residential housing; and execution of DoD base realignment.

The IMCOM-SE team includes Anniston Army Depot, Ala.; Blue Grass Army Depot, Ky.; Fort Moore, Ga.; Fort Bragg, N.C.; Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico; Fort Campbell, Ky.; Fort Eisenhower, Ga.; Fort Jackson, S.C.; Fort Knox, Ky.; Fort McPherson, Ga.; Fort Novosel, Ala.; Fort Stewart, Ga.; Holston Army Ammunition Plant, Tenn.; Milan Army Ammunition Plant, Tenn.; Mississippi Army Ammunition Plant, Miss.; Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point, N.C.; Redstone Arsenal, Ala.; and the U.S. Army Garrison, Miami, Fla.

The region supports the senior mission commander on each installation by relieving him or her of the requirement to oversee day-to-day garrison operations. The region exercises installation management, provides for public safety, provides for sound stewardship of resources, executes community and Family support services and programs and maintains and improves installation infrastructure.

IMCOM-SE is one of six regions under the Installation Management Command, which is headquartered at Arlington, Va. IMCOM was first organized as the Installation Management Agency in 2002. In 2006, IMCOM was activated as a three-star command that includes the former Installation Management Agency, the former Community and Family Support Center and the former Army Environmental Center under a single command as a direct reporting unit.

=== U.S. Army Forces Command ===
U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) is the largest command in the U.S. Army and the Army&#x27;s Force Provider to combatant commanders worldwide. FORSCOM combines the contributions of more than 750,000 Army National Guard, Army Reserve and active component Soldiers with those of more than 2,400 Army civilians to form a seamless, winning force that operates as a team across services, components and units. FORSCOM provides relevant and ready land power worldwide, in defense of the nation, at home and abroad.

Headquartered at Fort McPherson, FORSCOM trains, mobilizes, deploys, sustains, transforms and reconstitutes combat-ready Army forces capable of responding rapidly to crises worldwide. Using the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process, FORSCOM tailors the resources and training of its units to meet the specific and ever-changing requirements of combatant commanders and, when directed, those of U.S. civil authorities. These requirements can range from fighting the war on terrorism to providing relief to natural disaster victims.

FORSCOM reports through two chains of command; as an army command responsible directly to the chief of staff of the Army for the readiness, manning, equipping, training, mobilization and deployment of assigned forces, and as an Army Service Component Command, reporting to Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Va. In this role, FORSCOM provides Army forces to the joint war fight. FORSCOM units also participate in multinational exercises to build confidence among U.S. allies and friends.

The active component of FORSCOM has nearly 200,000 Soldiers stationed nationwide. This number includes three Army corps—I Corps at Fort Lewis, Wash.; III Corps at Fort Cavazos, Texas; and XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, N.C. FORSCOM also has eight divisions, multiple brigade combat teams and a full range of other combat, combat support and combat service support units.

First Army at Fort Gillem reports to FORSCOM. It is responsible for the training, readiness, mobilization and deployment support for Army National Guard and Army Reserve units in FORSCOM. It also executes FORSCOM missions within the continental United States and Puerto Rico. Army Reserve units are part of the federal force and make their primary contribution to FORSCOM&#x27;s combat power by providing support specialties such as medical, civil affairs, public affairs, transportation, maintenance and supply. As such, the Reserve accounts for about 45 percent of the Army&#x27;s total combat service support strength and about 30 percent of the total combat support units. Many Reserve units are designated to deploy early for contingency operations worldwide.

The Army National Guard provides FORSCOM a balanced force of eight National Guard combat divisions, 32 separate brigades and extensive supporting units. The current FORSCOM Army National Guard strength is about 350,000 Soldiers. Mobilizing the Army National Guard into active federal service would bring the total strength of FORSCOM to nearly two-thirds of the Army&#x27;s combat ground forces.

=== U.S. Army Reserve Command ===
The U.S. Army Reserve Command (USARC) has approximately 191,000 U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers and 10,000 DA civilian employees. It commands all U.S. Army Reserve conventional forces in the continental U.S. and Puerto Rico. Units in the Army Reserve have a warfight focus on combat support and combat service support missions for the Total Army and include medical, legal, civil affairs, chemical warfare, transportation, engineering and military police.

The USARC was established in October 1990 as a major subordinate command of the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM). In September 1998, the USARC moved from leased facilities into their headquarters building on Fort McPherson. In 2007, the USARC transferred from reporting to FORSCOM to reporting directly to DA. Approximately 900 civilians, contractors and Soldiers work at the headquarters.

The USARC provides command, control and support for all Army Reserve troop units in the continental United States. The USARC also ensures the readiness of its force and prepares more than 2,000 Troop Program Units under its command to mobilize in support of joint war-fighting contingencies and operations other than war. Since Sept. 11, 2001, the Army Reserve has mobilized approximately 185,000 Soldiers in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Missions throughout the world where Army Reserve Soldiers are currently providing support include Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, the Balkans and Africa.

The Chief, Army Reserve, Washington, D.C., also serves as the commanding general of the U.S. Army Reserve Command. Since 2003, the Army Reserve has taken an aggressive approach to transitioning the force from a strategic environment to an operational force. With BRAC initiatives and transformation, proposed changes will make the Army Reserve more deployable and functional in order to serve America&#x27;s military needs in the 21st century. Units will be functionally aligned forces that will not only benefit the Army Reserve, but the total military in terms of readiness and responsiveness to operational requirements.

Within the United States, Army Reserve Soldiers are actively involved in the homeland defense antiterrorism effort while continuing to provide support to military and federal agencies following natural and man-made disasters. USARC&#x27;s focus is on training, readiness, mobilization support and providing federal military assistance to other federal agencies.

=== U.S. Army Central ===
U.S. Army Central (USARCENT) is committed to supporting the objectives of US Central Command (CENTCOM) in some of the most volatile regions of the globe-the Middle East and South and Central Asia. In 1998, CENTCOM assumed responsibility for Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, in turn broadening USARCENT&#x27;s mission in this very important region of the world.

Assigned as the Army component to CENTCOM, USARCENT is the only Army-level headquarters in the force structure today manned and ready to provide the CENTCOM with a fully deployable, warfighting command and control headquarters anywhere in the world. USARCENT is capable of commanding ground combat forces operating as a joint task force, a coalition joint task force or as an army echelon-above-corps headquarters.

During wartime, USARCENT becomes the Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC), responsible for commanding all forces involved in ground operations in its area of responsibility.

Since USARCENT beginning as the Third Army in 1918, it has played major roles in America&#x27;s military history, serving in World Wars I and II, the Persian Gulf War and now the war on terrorism in Afghanistan, Iraq and other parts of the region. Over and over, USARCENT has demonstrated its determination, capabilities and flexibility to deter aggression in different parts of the world.

USARCENT does not have a fixed force structure of assigned units. Instead, it has a central reservoir composed of both active and reserve units based throughout the United States from which it may draw forces tailored to specific situations. In short, USARCENT continually customizes packages geared to sustain operation in the region 365 days a year in support of our national security objectives and obligations, filling a vital defense need and complementing USARCENT&#x27;s rich heritage and proud traditions.

Under the leadership of Gen. George S. Patton Jr., the 3rd Army participated in eight major operations in World War II, fighting through France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Austria. After performing Army-of-occupation duty following Germany&#x27;s surrender, Third Army returned to Atlanta in March 1947. Later that year, it moved to Fort McPherson, where it remained until it inactivated Oct. 1, 1973. In December 1982, Third Army was reactivated in Atlanta and assumed its current mission.

Third Army deployed to Saudi Arabia in August 1990 to assume its role as the senior Army headquarters under CENTCOM. At the peak of the build-up, the Third Army command oversaw more than 338,000 coalition forces, including 303,000 U.S. Army soldiers plus British and French ground forces. It was responsible for deploying, receiving and sustaining all Army forces deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1990 and 1991. The headquarters developed the initial defensive plan for Saudi Arabia, and later the offensive ground plan. Following the war, Third Army supervised the relief effort to restore life support facilities in Kuwait and provided protection for Iraqi refugees in southern Iraq.

USARCENT plans and executes an intensive schedule of joint and combined exercises in countries throughout the region, including the &quot;Intrinsic Action&quot; series in Kuwait and the &quot;Bright Star&quot; series in Egypt. Also, the headquarters manages the pre-positioned equipment program in this region to sustain a rapid response to future crisis.

Immediately following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in September 2001, USARCENT began preparing for future operations - the United States invasion of Afghanistan. The command was also heavily involved in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the following Iraq War.

=== Army Ground Forces Band ===
The 214th Army Band (The Army Ground Forces Band) was organized in 1845 in Texas as the 4th Infantry Regiment Band. Its heritage, which includes 26 campaign streamers and two awards of the French Croix de Guerre, spans the Mexican War, the American Civil War, the Spanish–American War, the Philippine–American War and both World Wars.

During the Battle of Monterrey, Mexico, the band captured and turned an artillery battery against the enemy. To commemorate this distinguished service, President Zachary Taylor authorized the band to wear red piping on the uniform, making it the only Army band to receive a combat distinction from a president of the United States.

The band fought with the victorious Third Division, which spearheaded the Battle of the Marne in July 1918. Having served in Alaska during World War II, the band participated in the Aleutian Islands operation in May 1943. Following World War II, the 4th Infantry Regiment Band was re-designated the 214th Army Band. Since 1945, this organization has been stationed in Fort Lewis, Washington; Fort Hood, Texas; Fort Meade, Maryland; Fort Richardson, Arkansas; Fort McPherson, Georgia; and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The unit was reassigned as the band for Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces Command, Fort McPherson, in 1973. Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh Jr. conferred the special designation &quot;The Army Ground Forces Band&quot; in 1985. It was inactivated in 2016.

U.S. Army Forces Command is charged with the combat readiness of active and reserve component Army units and the Army Ground Forces Band has been designated as the &quot;Musical Ambassador of the American Combat Soldier.&quot; The mission of the Army Ground Forces Band is to fulfill the requirements of U.S. Army Forces Command at local, national, and international events by providing musical support for military, state, recruiting and civil functions, formal concerts, and recreational activities. The Army Ground Forces Band consists of a variety of musical ensembles, including the marching band, the concert band, the Jazz Guardians, the Old Flint River Dixieland Band, the rock band &quot;The Loose Cannons,&quot; and various ceremonial and chamber ensembles.

=== First Army ===
First Army is the senior military activity at Fort Gillem. First Army is one of two Continental U.S. Armies in U.S. Army Forces Command. Headquarters, First Army, is staffed by a specialized team of active Army, active Guard and Reserve Soldiers and DA civilian employees. It has an integrated command structure that includes more than 10,000 Active and Reserve Component (RC) Soldiers.

First Army&#x27;s area of operations includes 27 states east of the Mississippi River (including Minnesota), two territories (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and the District of Columbia. Its customer base involves support to more than 350,000 RC Soldiers.

First Army&#x27;s mission centers around the three core functions of training and readiness: support, mobilization of RC forces and homeland defense.

First Army enhances the combat readiness of RC Soldiers and units by providing training and readiness support. It facilitates the RC units&#x27; ability to execute missions throughout the full spectrum of military operations. This is done by providing observer/controller trainers and maintaining direct contact with RC units.

First Army plans, prepares and executes the mobilization and deployment of RC units to provide combat-ready forces to war fighting combatant commanders. It supports presidential reserve call-ups (such as Bosnia, Kosovo and Kuwait) as well as full and partial mobilizations (such as support of homeland defense (HLD)). In fulfilling this responsibility, First Army has mobilized more than 110,000 Army National Guard and Army Reserve troops for Operations Enduring Freedom, Noble Eagle and Iraqi Freedom since the September 11 attacks in 2001.

First Army conducts HLD in support of national objectives, as directed. This means First Army is the regional DoD planning agent for military support to civil authorities during a response to natural or manmade disasters. This mission directly supports the Federal Response Plan during disaster relief operations. Normally led by the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate and the Federal Emergency Management Agency and joined by 27 federal agencies, including the American Red Cross, First Army Soldiers and civilian employees are proud of their mission to assist American families during times of crisis. The size of the First Army (and military) response depends upon the magnitude of the event requiring military support.

First U.S Army also performs two missions that, while not core functions, are significant in their importance to the Army: management of the Civilian Aides to the Secretary of the Army program and support to the National Boy Scout Jamboree.

First Army serves as the higher headquarters for three reserve divisions (training support (TS)): the 85th Division (TS), headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois; the 78th Division (TS), headquartered in Edison, New Jersey; and the 87th Division (TS), headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. The two important missions of training and readiness support and mobilization of RC Soldiers are accomplished through these three divisions.

First Army was formed in France on Aug. 10, 1918, with Gen. John J. Pershing commanding. As America&#x27;s first numbered Army, First Army engaged in two major operations: the reduction of the St. Mihiel Salient, east of Verdun, and the Meuse-Argonne offensive, west of Verdun. After World War I and a short period of occupation in Europe, First Army was inactivated in 1919. It was reactivated at Fort Jay, N.Y., in 1933.

On D-Day, June 6, 1944, with Gen. Omar N. Bradley commanding, First Army troops landed on Omaha and Utah beaches in Normandy. First Army established an impressive record of &quot;firsts&quot; in World War II: First on the beaches of Normandy, first to break out of the Normandy beachhead, first to enter Paris, first to break through the Siegfried Line, first to cross the Rhine River and first to meet the Russians. After World War II, First Army headquarters was located on Governors Island, New York. On January 1, 1966, First and Second Armies merged and First Army headquarters moved to Fort Meade, Maryland. In 1973, First Army transitioned from an active Army-oriented organization to one dedicated to improving the readiness of reserve components. In 1983, another reorganization took place. Second Army was reactivated at Fort Gillem and assumed responsibility for reserve component matters in seven states and two territories formerly assigned to First Army. In 1991, Fourth U.S. Army was inactivated and its seven Midwestern states became part of First Army. In 1995, First and Second Armies were once again consolidated and First Army moved to Fort Gillem.

=== 52nd Ordnance Group (EOD) ===
The wartime mission of the 52nd Ordnance Group (EOD) is to conduct force protection operations to defeat or lessen effects of conventional, unconventional (nuclear, biological, chemical or improvised explosive device) and terrorist munitions within its area of operations. Further, the group deploys, redeploys and assumes command and control of up to six ordnance battalions in a theater of operations, supporting the theater commander.

At Fort Gillem, the group headquarters commands and controls four battalion headquarters and 39 companies geographically separated throughout the United States. The group also runs the U.S. Army Very Important Persons Protective Service Agency, responsible for joint service coordination and tasking of EOD support to the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. State Department.

=== Military Entrance Processing Station ===
The Atlanta Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) is one of a network of 65 MEPS located nationwide and in Puerto Rico. The United States Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) is a joint DoD agency staffed with personnel from all military services that reports directly to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy. Although it is a separate DoD agency, USMEPCOM comprises two geographical sectors and staffed with personnel from all military services. The mission of USMEPCOM and the Atlanta MEPS is to process individuals for enlistment or induction into the armed services based on DoD-approved peacetime and mobilization standards. The Atlanta MEPS performs state-of-the-art testing, medical evaluation and processing for individuals wishing to enter military service. The three primary areas to be considered in determining an applicant&#x27;s qualifications for enlistment are aptitude for military service, physical qualifications and background evaluation screening.

For reasons ranging from adventurism to educational benefits, almost 7,000 young men and women from the Atlanta area were qualified for entry into the five military services through the Atlanta MEPS in fiscal year 2007. In most cases, the term of enlistment in the military service includes specialized job training. When these young men and women complete their service obligation, they return to their local community with valuable skills, disciplined work ethics and on-the-job experience.

The current location for the Atlanta MEPS was designed and built specifically for use by the MEPS. With an approximate construction cost of $3.7 million, groundbreaking for the new facility was held August 14, 1997. Personnel from the MEPS began processing applicants from this facility August 30, 1999. The normal tour of duty for military personnel assigned to the station is three years. All personnel assigned to the MEPS have the primary mission of assisting each branch of the military in processing personnel for duty in the U.S. Armed Forces.

The Atlanta MEPS has enlistment responsibility for 95 counties in Georgia, including 316 high schools and five strategically located Military Examination Test (MET) sites. Aside from the MEPS located at Fort Gillem, the five MET sites in the state of Georgia area offer aptitude testing to applicants near their homes, which eliminates unnecessary applicant travel. Those sites are located in Athens, Columbus, Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Macon and Robins Air Force Base.

As with any business, the Atlanta MEPS has considerable operating overhead which directly benefits the local business community. The Atlanta MEPS&#x27; paid contracts and services during the fiscal year 2007 were more than $4 million.

=== Headquarters, 3d Military Police Group (CID) ===
The 3d Military Police Group (Criminal Investigation Division)(3d MP Group (CID)) is a tactical headquarters located at Fort Gillem. The mission of the 3d MP Group (CID) and its four organic battalions is to provide a full range of criminal investigative support and services for commanders, installations and other areas of Army interest in the 28 states east of the Mississippi, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Central and South America and the Caribbean. It also is responsible for providing criminal investigative support to all Army interests within the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) area of responsibility (AOR).

USCENTCOM&#x27;s AOR comprises the 25 countries in Southwest Asia (Northern Red Sea Region, South and Central Asia, Arabian Peninsula, Iraq and the Horn of Africa). Investigative support to this operational theater includes: criminal investigations of felony crimes, logistical security, criminal intelligence assessments, personal security protection for DoD officials and visiting foreign dignitaries, force protection and safeguarding of critical resources in peacetime, combat and contingency operations. The group also works with other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and uses the latest equipment, systems and investigative techniques.

The 3d MP Group (CID) is organized into a command group and seven staff divisions, including personnel and administration, operations, logistics, resource management, staff judge advocate, information management and Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment.

The group exercises command and control of 35 subordinate units. These units support key Army field elements, including: XVIII Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, N.C.; the 101st Air Assault Division|101st Air Assault Division (Light), Fort Campbell, Ky.; the Third Infantry Division, Fort Stewart; the 10th Mountain Division (Light), Fort Drum, N.Y.; and Third Army (ARCENT). The 3d MP Group (CID) is also responsible for providing support for various major commands in their area, including: DA, U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Southern Command, U.S. Joint Forces Command and U.S. Special Operations Command.

=== U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory ===
The US Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIL) provides forensic laboratory services to DoD investigative agencies and other federal law enforcement agencies.

USACIL also operates an army school to train forensic laboratory examiners and manages the U.S. Criminal Investigation Command criminalistics program.

USACIL is the DoD forensic laboratory with the most extensive range of capabilities to support all defense criminal investigation organizations worldwide. The laboratory is equipped for analysis in multiple forensic disciplines. USACIL performs forensic analysis in support of criminal investigations in the laboratory, at crime scenes or deployed into combat theaters. USACIL examiners routinely present expert testimony in criminal trials around the globe.

From 2007–2011, the lab underwent scrutiny for a series of instances of personnel misconduct and allegations of poor investigative work.

=== Southeastern Army Reserve Intelligence Support Center ===
The Southeastern Army Reserve Intelligence Support Center (Language Lab) at Fort Gillem provides battle-focused intelligence training support to improve reserve component technical intelligence skills, proficiency and readiness.

The center augments the total force&#x27;s intelligence and linguistic capabilities and supports multi-service reserve component intelligence personnel and units in satisfying requirements of warfighters and national intelligence agencies.

=== United States Army 2nd Recruiting Brigade ===
The U.S. Army 2nd Recruiting Brigade, headquartered at Fort Gillem, directs the efforts of nine recruiting battalions located throughout the southeastern United States. The battalions under the U.S. Army 2nd Recruiting Brigade are located in Smyrna, Ga.; Columbia, S.C.; Jackson, Miss.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Miami, Fla.; Tampa, Fla.; Montgomery, Ala.; Nashville, Tenn.; and Raleigh, N.C.

Headquarters functions include command management, administration, operations, liaison, program budget and accounting logistics, advertising and public affairs for operation of the brigade headquarters and its recruiting battalions.

=== Atlanta Distribution Center – Army and Air Force Exchange Service ===
The Army and Air Force Exchange Service Atlanta Distribution Center (ADC) mission is twofold: to receive, store and distribute retail, cost, food and expense merchandise to primary customers in the Southeastern United States and to receive, store and distribute specialized merchandise—music, video, jewelry, military clothing, catalog, books and magazines—to customers worldwide.

The ADC completed construction of a facility next to four existing buildings at Fort
Gillem in the spring of 1999, making it one of the most modern facilities of its kind.

=== U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine ===
The U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM) mission is to provide worldwide health promotion and preventive medicine leadership and services to identify, assess and counter environmental, occupational and disease threats to the health, fitness and readiness of America&#x27;s Army, the Army community and the Army civilian workforce. The unit&#x27;s lineage can be traced back over 50 years to the Army Industrial Hygiene Laboratory, established at the beginning of World War II and, under the direct jurisdiction of The Army Surgeon General, conducted occupational health surveys of Army-operated industrial plants, arsenals and depots. These surveys were aimed at identifying and eliminating occupational health hazards within the DoD&#x27;s industrial production base and proved to be of great benefit to the nation&#x27;s war effort.

The more than 1,000-person USACHPPM team is a linchpin of medical support to combat forces and of the military managed-care system. It provides worldwide scientific expertise and services in clinical and field preventive medicine, environmental and occupational health, health promotion and wellness, epidemiology and disease surveillance, toxicology and related laboratory sciences. Professional disciplines represented include chemists, physicists, engineers, physicians, optometrists, epidemiologists, audiologists, nurses, industrial hygienists, toxicologists and entomologists, as well as sub-specialties within these professions.

The USACHPPM headquarters is located at the South Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. Five regional subordinate commands are located at Fort George G. Meade, Md.; Fort Lewis, Wash.; Landstuhl, Germany; Camp Zama, Japan; and Fort McPherson, Ga.

Located in Building 180 on Fort McPherson, USACHPPM-South is responsible for providing preventive medicine services and training to the southeast region of the continental U.S. The unit consists of five divisions: entomological sciences, field preventive medicine, industrial hygiene, quality management support and environmental health engineering. USACHPPM-South can request additional support in other, more specialized areas from its headquarters to support its regional customers.

USACHPPM-South is in the process of relocating to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and expects to complete this move by September 30, 2009. At Fort Sam Houston, USACHPPM-South will continue to provide &quot;cutting edge&quot; public health services to all DoD entities (both active and reserve components) in the southeast region of the continental United States.

== History of Fort McPherson ==

=== Origins ===

Situated on and located four miles (6 km) southwest of the center of Atlanta, Fort McPherson is rich in military tradition as an army post dating back to 1867. It was during that year that a post was established in west Atlanta on the grounds where Spelman College is now located. Between the years 1867 and 1881, the post was garrisoned in turn by elements of the 2nd, 16th and 18th U.S. Infantry Regiments and the 5th Artillery. Their mission was to enforce Union regulations during the reconstruction period following the Civil War.

In October 1881, Secretary of War Robert T. Lincoln directed that the lease of the site be surrendered and the buildings sold at public auction. In compliance with this directive, McPherson Barracks was abandoned by U.S. troops Dec. 8, 1881. Part of the site was purchased by the American Baptist Missionary Society for use by the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary, which later became Spelman College. The U.S. Treasury realized $17,264.40 from the sale of the buildings. March 3, 1885, Congress passed the Sundry Civil Bill, which contained an initial sum of $15,000 for the purchase of land and the erection of a 10-company post. The task of site selection went to Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock, commanding general of the Division of the Atlantic. Five tracts of land amounting to were purchased in September 1885. Capt. Joshua W. Jacobs, assistant quartermaster, was responsible for developing and implementing the first master plan for the post.

That same year, Maj. Gen. John A. Schofield, chief of staff, suggested the new post be formally named in honor of Maj. Gen. James Birdseye McPherson. During the Civil War, McPherson participated in the Battles of Jackson and Vicksburg earning promotion to brigadier general. In 1864 he was in command of one of the Three Armies under the Major General William T. Sherman&#x27;s Military Division of the Mississippi. He was killed while on a reconnaissance patrol during the Battle of Atlanta July 22, 1864. He is the highest-ranking officer to have been killed by position in the history of the United States, He commanded the Union Army of the Tennessee. US Army Engineers built a monument to him on the site he was killed in 1888, in East Atlanta and maintained to this day by the Sons of Union Veterans of the American Civil War, SUVCW.

During the Spanish–American War, Fort McPherson served as a general hospital and as a recruit training center for nearly 20,000 men. Barracks were filled to overflowing and emergency tents were set up. It later became a prisoner of war (POW) facility, and by the end of July 1898, 16 Spanish Army prisoners were incarcerated in what is now the Post Chapel.

=== World War I ===

During World War I, Fort McPherson was selected to be an internment camp for German POWs; a base hospital, General Hospital No. 6; and the site of an officers&#x27; training camp.

Immediately to the west of the post, across Campbellton Road, a war prison barracks was established to confine German POWs. The prison camp reached a peak population of 1,411 in July 1918.

The secretary of war directed that the permanent barracks of Fort McPherson be made available for general or base hospital use June 23, 1917. The command of the post was turned over to the ranking medical officer and Fort McPherson transformed itself into a general hospital with a capacity of nearly 2,400 beds. It is estimated that more than 10,000 patients were admitted from August 1917 until December 1918.

Fort McPherson served as the headquarters for the IV Corps Area from 1920 until 1923 and 1927 until 1934. In the 1930s, the post hospital was greatly expanded to serve as a rehabilitation center and the post served as the headquarters for District B of the Civilian Conservation Corps.

=== World War II ===
With the passage of the 1940 Selective Service Act and the outbreak of World War II, Fort McPherson activities were greatly expanded. In addition to serving as a general depot, a reception center was established to process thousands of men for entry into the service and the post again served as a major hospital center.

In August 1945, as World War II ended, the United States War Department reversed the flow of work at the induction center. Fort McPherson became a separation center for almost 200,000 Soldiers and processed countless others for reassignment.

=== Historic buildings ===
The historic district of the post sits on of land. The 40 buildings that comprise the historic district are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Some of those buildings and their histories are:

==== Hodges Hall ====
Hodges Hall, (Building 65) the post headquarters, was built in 1904 as a double barracks at a cost of $55,000. It has a distinctive horseshoe shape and is a departure from the interval between the other barracks. This building is named in honor of Gen. Courtney Hodges, commander of Third United States Army and First United States Army during World War II. Today, this facility houses the offices of the garrison commander and staff.

==== Troop Row ====
Construction of Troop Row began in 1889 at the east end with Building 56. All of the buildings are double barracks except Building 60, in the center, which is a triple barracks. The average cost of these buildings was $26,000. The Audie Murphy Barracks Complex opened in 1998, replacing the use of the barracks. The Troop Row barracks have been converted to office space.

==== Post Chapel ====
The chapel(Building 42) was built between 1886 and 1889 as the post guardhouse. During the Spanish–American War, this building served as a place of confinement for 16 POWs. In 1921, pews, 11 stained-glass windows and four stained-glass transoms were
added to the structure when it was converted into a chapel.

==== Hospital ====
The original post hospital, General Hospital No. 6 (Buildings 170 and 171 ), was built between 1886 and 1889 at a cost of $11,414. During World War I, the hospital was so important that the senior ranking medical officer commanded the post. Between August 1917 and December 1918, more than 10,000 Soldiers were admitted. During both world wars, many of the surrounding buildings, including Troop Row, were used as hospital wards. In 1977, the hospital became a clinic and the majority of the building was converted to administrative space. In January 1998, the Lawrence Joel United States Army Health and Dental Clinic was dedicated and opened in Building 125. Building 170 and 171 house Installation Management Command, Southeast Region, headquarters.

==== Public safety ====
Construction was completed on Buildings 100,101 and 102 in 1898, 1893 and 1889, respectively. The first two were storehouses for the commissary and the quartermaster, while Building 102 was the post bakery. The bakery contained three rooms and two ovens to bake bread. At one time, tokens were used, evidently as a means of ration control. These small tokens were redeemable for one loaf of bread. Today, these buildings are used by the Office of Public Safety, which houses the Chief, Directorate of Emergency Services and his staff.

==== Chapel Center ====
Construction was completed on this facility (Building 51) in 1893 at a reported cost of $13,000. The main floor provided rooms for the officer and sergeant of the guard, the noncommissioned officers of the guard force and the members of the guard itself. Space was also provided for a prison room, with two cages for prisoners, six single cells for garrison prisoners and water closets for both the prisoners and the guards. This one-story brick building was the guardhouse and the post prison. In 1949, it was converted to the Central Telephone Exchange for the post. Today, it houses the post chaplain and staff.

==== Print Plant ====
This building (Building 50) was built in 1918 as the post firehouse. It had a capacity of one truck and seven beds. The brickwork covering the old vehicle entrance in the front can still be seen under the small portico. In 1941, it was converted into the post office and used in that capacity until December 2002.

==== Recreation Center ====
Built in 1918 by the Red Cross as a convalescent center for hospital patients, this building (Building 46) was built in the shape of a Maltese cross. In 1919, the building was taken over by the Army and converted into a service club. Today, it is used as office space, a meeting area and more.

==== Pershing Hall ====
The original and present-day bachelor officers&#x27; quarters (Building 16) was completed in 1904. This facility was originally given the number 16 to incorporate the structure with the numbering system for the 19 sets of quarters on Staff Row, numbered 1 through 20, which is the reason why there is no number 16 on Staff Row. This building was named in honor of General of the Armies of the United States John &quot;Blackjack&quot; Pershing. During his career, Pershing served as the commander-in-chief of the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I and later as the Army chief of staff.

==== Van Horn Hall ====
Completed in 1889 as the original post headquarters, this two-story structure (Building 41) contained office space for the commander, adjutant, sergeant major, clerks, library, mail and court martial room. In 1891, the first rental of a telephone line to Atlanta for $12.50 a month was authorized. In 1893, $17 was approved for material and labor to install electric bells and connections in the building to facilitate communication and the transaction of business in the headquarters. Thus, the first known &quot;intercom&quot; system was installed on post. This building was named in honor of Brig. Gen. Robert O. Van Horn, who served as post commander from January 1934 until August 1940. This six-and-a-half-year period is the longest post commander&#x27;s tour in the installation&#x27;s history. In 1957, the building became office space for the staff judge advocate.

==== Staff Row ====

Staff Row consists of 19 officer quarters — four single-family residences and 15 duplexes. These quarters were built from 1891 until 1910 at an average cost of $15,000. The original concept for Staff Row was to build homes for the officers of an artillery regiment with 10 batteries. At full strength, such a unit would be authorized a colonel, a lieutenant colonel, three majors, 10 captains, 20 first lieutenants and 10 second lieutenants. The final home built on Staff Row in 1910 is currently the residence of the post commander. The small lot required that Quarters 18 also be a single-family unit.

==== Hedekin Field ====
Staff Row faces the post parade ground, Hedekin Field. Originally a polo field, it is named in honor of Capt. David Drew Hedekin, an avid polo player who commanded Headquarters Company here from 1936 through 1938. Hedekin was fatally injured while playing in a polo tournament at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, July 17, 1938. He died there July 20, 1938. A monument to Capt. Hedekin is located on the edge of the parade field across from Quarters 10. Today, Hedekin Field is the site of colorful parades, retirement ceremonies and other special celebrations.

==== Quarters 10 ====
Quarters 10 is the centerpiece of Staff Row. Completed in 1892, the three-story home has -high ceilings on the first floor, -high ceilings on the second, and semicircular front windows in the turret. In 1925, Gen. Douglas MacArthur was assigned to Fort McPherson as post commander. Since his wife refused to live in the quarters, they rented an apartment downtown near the Fox Theatre. The MacArthurs left after having spent 89 days at Fort McPherson, when he was reassigned to Baltimore. A sleeping porch was added to the back of the quarters in 1935 for President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s visits while he was en route to Warm Springs, Georgia.
==== Other structures ====
For a short time, German POWs were held on Troop Row. In June 1917, they constructed the war prison barracks located just west of the post between Campbellton Road and Venetian Drive. By June 1919, 1,346 prisoners were interned at Fort McPherson. Many homes located west of the post were later built on the cement slab foundations left behind after the prison barracks were torn down in late 1919. The oldest structure still in use at Fort McPherson is located on Miller Drive.

Quarters 532 was built in 1887 at a cost of $2,470. The single-family dwelling has of space. It was originally the residence of the civilian post engineer, a plumber, who was in charge of operating the water pump station. Chief Warrant Officer Ulie H. Jeffers, chief field clerk, lived in these quarters from 1923 through 1950. This period of 27 years probably established a record for the continuous occupancy of a set of Army quarters by one individual. The home was later inhabited by the commander, Intelligence Support Element Ft. McPherson (513th MI Bde), Army Captain Steven S. Walsky and family; and appropriately, finally by Chief Warrant Officer Clyde Green, the last Vietnam War draftee to remain on active duty (retired in 2010).

<text>Rancagua () is a city and commune in central Chile and part of the Rancagua conurbation. It is the capital of the Cachapoal Province and of the O&#x27;Higgins Region, located south of the national capital of Santiago.

It was originally named Santa Cruz de Triana by Spanish colonists. In 2012, its population was 232,211. The main economic activities range from mining, tourism, agriculture, timber, food production and services to minor industrial activities. The city also serves as the administrative and legal center of the region.

Together with Machalí and Gultro, it forms the Rancagua conurbation. After Curicó, Talca and Concepción, it is one of the most important and densely populated cities of the south central zone of Chile.

==History==
===Foundation period===

The Rancagua Valley was occupied by the local Picunche. They fell briefly under the control of the Inca Empire in the 15th century. Its remains in structures can still be found near the city today. Through their civil engineering, the Inca accomplished expeditions to the south of their empire.

Rancagua was founded by Spanish explorer José Antonio Manso de Velasco, who founded several cities in the central area of Chile. The settlement was first called Villa Santa Cruz de Triana.

The city is notable in Chilean history as the scene of the Disaster of Rancagua of 1814, when Chilean forces fighting for independence from Spain were defeated. This marked the beginning of the period known as the &quot;Reconquista&quot; (Reconquest), an attempt by Spain to regain control of Chile.

===Today===

In recent years the city has become one of the most attractive cultural and tourist centers in the O&#x27;Higgins Region, largely because of the vineyards that have been developed in the area. Rancagua also offers sports centers and easy access to smaller villages and towns.

Other visitors are attracted to the archeological sites, such as Pukara de La Compañia and the nearby Rio Cipreses nature reserve. Both can be visited by private vehicle or with local tour companies.

The city is connected to the capital, Santiago, by the Panamerican Highway (Chile Route 5). In addition, the Metrotren connects the metro service in Santiago to Rancagua by train.

Rancagua is home of the University of Rancagua (in Spanish), the first private university to be established in the O&#x27;Higgins Region.

The region is known for &quot;El Teniente&quot; in the nearby Andes mountain range: it is the &quot;largest underground copper mine in the world.&quot; It is located about to the east of the city. El Teniente is a division of the state-owned mining enterprise, Codelco.

The city&#x27;s Braden Copper Stadium, named for the American company that developed the mine through the first half of the 20th century, was one of the four venues of the 1962 FIFA World Cup. More recently, it houses the O&#x27;Higgins professional football (soccer) club, one of the leading teams in Chilean professional football. Every year, the National Championship of Chilean rodeo is held in the Medialuna Monumental de Rancagua. In 2015, the city hosted the 2015 Copa América, receiving two matches of the tournament.

==Demographics==

The population of Rancagua is primarily either of Spanish descent or mestizo, with a particularly strong Basque influence. There are also residents of German, Croatian, Italian, Greek, Levantine Arab, Swiss, French, English or Irish ancestry living in the city. Indigenous Mapuche workers migrate from the south and there are also some Roma gypsies.

In addition, there has been increasing immigration to the city from neighbouring South American countries such as Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Rancagua spans an area of and has 214,344 inhabitants (104,879 men and 109,465 women). Of these, 206,971 (96.6%) lived in urban areas and 7,373 (3.4%) in rural areas. The population grew by 14.4% (27,020 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.

==Administration==
As a commune, Rancagua is a third-level administrative division of Chile, administered by a municipal council and headed by an alcalde, who is directly elected by the people for a four-year term.

==Culture==

This area is known as the &quot;huaso province&quot; after the name of the Chilean cowboy, the &quot;huaso.&quot; The population is a mixture of both European (including Argentine immigrants) and indigenous races and cultures. The region has a homogeneous culture known as &quot;Chileanidad&quot; and a mestizo influence is evident.

Rancagua and the Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Region was settled by Spaniards (notably Andalusian, Basque, Aragonese and Navarrese) and other Europeans. French and Italian families established agriculture, including the important wine industry: the Wine Route is one of the main tourist attractions of the Colchagua valley. Breweries can be found as well, the legacy of German and Swiss immigration. Livestock development and herding was especially influenced by British, Greek and Yugoslavian settlers.

Because the city is relatively close to Santiago, there has led to a growing urban influence in the local culture. Rancagua is fast becoming a suburb of Santiago&#x27;s upper-class professional workforce.

===Festivals===

==Transportation==
Meanwhile all of the city is readily accessible by walking;
Public Transport is provided by Trans O&#x27;Higgins by six lines of busses, and nine private taxi lines operate inside the urban radius.

== Mining - El Teniente ==
Situated 44 km east of Rancagua and 75 km south of the capital, Santiago, El Teniente claims to be the largest underground copper mine in the world (see below). The El Teniente orebody has been known and worked on a small scale for many years. In the 16th century it became the property of the Jesuits as it was located on their Hacienda de la Compañia de Jesús. They operated a small mine known as the Socavón de los Jesuitas. Following their expulsion, the hacienda was acquired in 1768 by Don Mateo de Toro y Zambrano y Ureta. Between 1819 and 1823 his heirs restarted and enlarged the workings, bringing in a mining engineer to help. However, these and subsequent attempts to establish anything more than a small scale mine failed for lack of capital and the property was eventually bought by the American, William Braden, for approximately US$100,000. The same year Braden formed Rancagua Mines, which became the Braden Copper Company, in association with old colleagues from ASARCO, including Barton Sewell.

Work started on establishing a mine in 1905 after Government permission had been acquired but progress was slow because of difficulty of access and a hard winter climate. A small gravity plant was soon erected but it was not until 1912 that a flotation plant was erected at Sewell. Control passed to Kennecott in 1915 and it ran the mine until nationalization in 1971.

==Climate==
Rancagua has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;), with clearly marked seasons. Summers are generally extremely dry, with cool mornings and hot afternoons, while winters are mild with cold mornings and occasional periods of heavy rainfall that averages around each year – almost all of which occurs during a handful of storms between May and August. In some years there can be a little snow.

==Sports==
The sport in the city is varied including football, basketball and hockey. The city&#x27;s most famous football club is O&#x27;Higgins, who currently plays in the first category of Chilean soccer, the Primera División de Chile. O&#x27;Higgins had great past glories, with the help of El Teniente they became one of the leading teams of Chile during the 1970s, participating on several occasions in the Copa Libertadores, their best performance being a semifinal appearance. In 2013, they won the Primera División de Chile for the first time, followed by a win in the Supercopa de Chile in 2014. Amongst other football clubs in the city are Tomás Greig and Enfoque, both of which play in the Tercera División de Chile.

Since 2015 the Autódromo Internacional de Codegua in the neighboring commune of Codegua held the &quot;Chile Grand Prix&quot; in the Superbike World Championship, the circuit was supposed to also host a race in the 2016 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, although those plans were cancelled.

===Stadiums and arenas===

<doc id="901305" wikidata="Q188260" url="?curid=901305" title="Sodium amide">
<text>Sodium amide, commonly called sodamide (systematic name sodium azanide), is the inorganic compound with the formula . It is a salt composed of the sodium cation and the azanide anion. This solid, which is dangerously reactive toward water, is white, but commercial samples are typically gray due to the presence of small quantities of metallic iron from the manufacturing process. Such impurities do not usually affect the utility of the reagent. conducts electricity in the fused state, its conductance being similar to that of NaOH in a similar state. has been widely employed as a strong base in organic synthesis.

==Preparation and structure==
Sodium amide can be prepared by the reaction of sodium with ammonia gas, but it is usually prepared by the reaction in liquid ammonia using iron(III) nitrate as a catalyst. The reaction is fastest at the boiling point of the ammonia, c. −33 °C. An electride, , is formed as a reaction intermediate.

 is a salt-like material and as such, crystallizes as an infinite polymer. The geometry about sodium is tetrahedral. In ammonia, forms conductive solutions, consistent with the presence of and ions.

==Uses==
Sodium amide is mainly used as a strong base in organic chemistry, often suspended (it is insoluble) in liquid ammonia solution. One of the main advantages to the use of sodium amide is its relatively low nucleophilicity. In the industrial production of indigo, sodium amide is a component of the highly basic mixture that induces cyclisation of &quot;N&quot;-phenylglycine. The reaction produces ammonia, which is recycled typically.
===Dehydrohalogenation===
Sodium amide is a standard base for dehydrohalogenations. It induces the loss of two equivalents of hydrogen bromide from a vicinal dibromoalkane to give a carbon–carbon triple bond, as in a preparation of phenylacetylene.
Usually two equivalents of sodium amide yields the desired alkyne. Three equivalents are necessary in the preparation of a terminal alkynes because the terminal CH of the resulting alkyne protonates an equivalent amount of base.

Hydrogen chloride and ethanol can also be eliminated in this way, as in the preparation of 1-ethoxy-1-butyne.

===Cyclization reactions===
Where there is no β-hydrogen to be eliminated, cyclic compounds may be formed, as in the preparation of methylenecyclopropane below.

Cyclopropenes, aziridines
and cyclobutanes may be formed in a similar manner.

===Deprotonation of carbon and nitrogen acids===
Carbon acids which can be deprotonated by sodium amide in liquid ammonia include terminal alkynes,
methyl ketones,
cyclohexanone, phenylacetic acid and its derivatives
and diphenylmethane. Acetylacetone loses two protons to form a dianion. Sodium amide will also deprotonate indole and piperidine.

===Related non-nucleophilic bases===
It is however poorly soluble in solvents other than ammonia. Its use has been superseded by the related reagents sodium hydride, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (NaHMDS), and lithium diisopropylamide (LDA).

===Other reactions===
*Rearrangement with orthodeprotonation
*Oxirane synthesis
*Indole synthesis
*Chichibabin reaction

==Safety==
Sodium amide is a common reagent with a long history of laboratory use. It can decompose violently on contact with water, producing ammonia and sodium hydroxide:

When burned in oxygen, it will give oxides of sodium (which react with the produced water, giving sodium hydroxide) along with nitrogen oxides:
:

In the presence of limited quantities of air and moisture, such as in a poorly closed container, explosive mixtures of peroxides may form. This is accompanied by a yellowing or browning of the solid. As such, sodium amide is to be stored in a tightly closed container, under an atmosphere of an inert gas. Sodium amide samples which are yellow or brown in color represent explosion risks.

The first Winnipeg folk festival was held August 9 - 11, 1974 at Birds Hill Provincial Park. The free concert was staged with funding from the Centennial Committee and the CBC. The event depended on the collective work of many local volunteers so the organizers developed an organizational structure that embodied their philosophy that everyone contributing was a significant participant. Subsequent events built on the foundation of this initial idea creating a model that heavily influenced the operation of other similar festivals in Canada, particularly the Vancouver Folk Music Festival and the Edmonton Folk Festival.

Performers at the first festival included:

<text>The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) is a United States information and referral center in support of polar and cryospheric research. NSIDC archives and distributes digital and analog snow and ice data and also maintains information about snow cover, avalanches, glaciers, ice sheets, freshwater ice, sea ice, ground ice, permafrost, atmospheric ice, paleoglaciology, and ice cores.

NSIDC is part of the University of Colorado Boulder Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), and is affiliated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information through a cooperative agreement. NSIDC serves as one of twelve Distributed Active Archive Centers funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to archive and distribute data from NASA&#x27;s past and current satellites and field measurement programs. NSIDC also supports the National Science Foundation through the Exchange For Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic (ELOKA) and other scientific research grants. NSIDC is also a member of the ICSU World Data System. Mark Serreze is the director of NSIDC.

==History==
The World Data Center (WDC) for Glaciology, Boulder, a data center responsible for archiving all available glaciological information, was established at the American Geographical Society under Dr. William O. Field, Director, in 1957. Between 1971 and 1976 it was operated by the U.S. Geological Survey, Glaciology Project Office, under the direction of Dr. Mark F. Meier.

In 1976, responsibility for the WDC for Glaciology was transferred to NOAA, Environmental Data and Information Service (EDIS), and the center moved to the University of Colorado at Boulder under the direction of Professor Roger G. Barry. In 1982, NOAA created the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) as a means to expand the WDC holdings and as a place to archive data from some NOAA programs. In the 1980s and 1990s, support to NSIDC widened with NASA funding for the Snow and Ice Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) and NSF funding to manage selected Arctic and Antarctic data and metadata.

==International interactions==
International science and data management programs facilitate the free exchange of data and accelerate research aimed at understanding the role of the cryosphere in the Earth system. NSIDC contributes to a number of international programs. Most of these programs, only a few of which are mentioned here, fall under the aegis of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).

NSIDC scientists participate in International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), International Association of Cryospheric Sciences (IACS), and in activities of the International Permafrost Association (IPA), the Global Digital Sea Ice Data Bank (GDSIDB), and the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), including Climate and Cryosphere (CliC), Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX), the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). Former NSIDC Director, Roger G. Barry, was co-Vice Chair of the WCRP CliC Scientific Steering Group until 2005, and was a member of the GCOS/Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) Terrestrial Observation Panel for Climate through 2007.

==Research==
Researchers at NSIDC investigate the dynamics of Antarctic ice shelves, new techniques for the remote sensing of snow and freeze/thaw cycle of soils, the role of snow in hydrologic modeling, linkages between changes in sea ice extent and weather patterns, large-scale shifts in polar climate, river and lake ice, and the distribution and characteristics of seasonally and permanently frozen ground. In-house scientists pursue their work as part of the CIRES Cryospheric and Polar Process Division, 
University of Colorado Boulder.

NSIDC also monitors Arctic and Antarctic sea ice in near real time, and regularly posts sea ice extent data and analysis on its Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis page.

==Local and traditional knowledge==
A research project of the NSIDC is the Exchange For Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic or ELOKA. It is a collaborative international effort that was launched during the 2007–2009 International Polar Year. ELOKA facilitates the collection, preservation, exchange, and use of local observations and knowledge of the Arctic. Data management and user support are provided by ELOKA while it fosters collaboration between resident Arctic experts and visiting researchers. By working together, Arctic residents and researchers have made significant contributions to our understanding of the Arctic and recent changes to it. A key challenge of local and traditional knowledge (LTK) research and community-based monitoring is having an effective and appropriate means of recording, storing, and managing data and information. There is also the issue of finding an effective means of making such data available to Arctic residents and researchers, as well as other interested groups such as teachers, students, and decision makers. Without a network and data management system to support LTK and community-based research, a number of problems have arisen. ELOKA aims to fill this gap.

==Data==
In February 2025, data from the NSIDC showed total global sea ice extent to be at an all-time low.

<doc id="901356" wikidata="Q2608920" url="?curid=901356" title="Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis">
<text>Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis, also known as the Tallis Fantasia, is a one-movement work for string orchestra by Ralph Vaughan Williams. The theme is by the 16th-century English composer Thomas Tallis. The Fantasia was first performed at Gloucester Cathedral as part of the 1910 Three Choirs Festival, and has entered the orchestral repertoire, with frequent concert performances and recordings by conductors and orchestras in various countries.

==Background and first performance==
Vaughan Williams did not achieve wide recognition early in his career as a composer, but by 1910, in his late thirties, he was gaining a reputation. In that year the Three Choirs Festival commissioned a work from him, to be premiered in Gloucester Cathedral; this represented a considerable boost to his standing. He composed what his biographer James Day calls &quot;unquestionably the first work by Vaughan Williams that is recognizably and unmistakably his and no one else&#x27;s&quot;. It is based on a tune by the 16th-century English composer Thomas Tallis, which Vaughan Williams had come across while editing the &quot;English Hymnal&quot;, published in 1906.
Vaughan Williams conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the first performance of the Fantasia, as the first part of a concert in Gloucester Cathedral on 6 September 1910, followed by Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, conducted by its composer.

==Music==

===Theme===
Like several of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s other works, the Fantasia draws on the music of the English Renaissance. Tallis&#x27;s tune is in the Phrygian mode, characterised by intervals of a flat second, third, sixth and seventh; the pattern is reproduced by playing the white notes of the piano starting on E.

Tallis&#x27;s theme was one of nine tunes he wrote for the Psalter of 1567 of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Matthew Parker. It was a setting of Parker&#x27;s metrical version of Psalm 2, which in the King James Bible version begins, &quot;Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?&quot;, and is rendered by Parker as &quot;Why fumeth in sight: The Gentils spite, In fury raging stout? Why taketh in hond: the people fond, Vayne things to bring about?&quot;. The tune is in Double Common Metre (D.C.M. or C.M.D.).

According to his biographer Michael Kennedy, Vaughan Williams came to associate Tallis&#x27;s theme with John Bunyan&#x27;s Christian allegory, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, a subject with which the composer had a lifelong fascination; he used the tune in 1906 in incidental music he composed for a stage version of the book. For the Hymnal, he adapted the tune as a setting of Joseph Addison&#x27;s hymn &quot;When rising from the bed of death&quot;.

===Fantasia===
The term &quot;fantasia&quot;, according to Frank Howes in his study of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s works, referred to the 16th-century forerunner of the fugue &quot;in that a thread of theme was enunciated and taken up by other parts, then dropped in favour of another akin to it which was similarly treated&quot;. Vaughan Williams&#x27;s fantasia draws on but does not strictly follow this precept, containing sections in which the material is interrelated, although with little wholly imitative writing, and antiphony in preference to contrapuntal echoing of themes.
The Fantasia is scored for double string orchestra with string quartet, employing antiphony between the three contributory ensembles. Orchestra I is the main body of strings; Orchestra II is smaller. The published score does not stipulate the number of players in Orchestra I; Orchestra II consists of two first violins, two seconds, two violas, two cellos and one double bass The composer&#x27;s metronome marking indicates a playing time of 11½ minutes, but in recorded performances the duration has varied between 12m 40s (Dimitri Mitropoulos, 1958) and 18m 12s (Leonard Bernstein, 1976), with a more typical time of between 15 and 16½ minutes.

The piece is structured with an introduction, opening statement of the themes (Tallis’ original hymn melody broken up into its four constituent phrases and interspersed with a “swaying chord” motif), four episodes (exploring different variations of those themes and different voicings across the three ensembles), and then a restatement of the themes and a coda.

The Introduction begins in B-flat major with all three groups playing together, ppp molto sostenuto for two bars of time before moving to and the low strings plucking hints of the first two phrases of the Tallis theme interspersed with the bowed sway motif. Kennedy describes the introduction as “a hauntingly poetic introduction before we hear its first full statement in Tallis&#x27;s four-part harmonisation&quot;. Howes comments that &quot;a phrase of swaying chords&quot; after the initial statement of the theme &quot;acts as a kind of recurrent refrain&quot; throughout the main body of the piece.

In the Opening Statement of the full theme, beginning in the 15th bar, the two orchestras and solo quartet come together. The first two Tallis phrases and sway motif are played on all second violins, violas and celli continuing into a section in Phrygian mode for the third and fourth phrases of Tallis’ theme. The first violins join for a restatement of the fourth phrase. In the 30th bar the time signature changes back to and the music rises to a climax. Schwarts says “There&#x27;s much octave double-stopping (each string player sounds two notes at once), a higher dynamic, and an appassionato marking after all!” The statement ends dying away in section dying with a texture reminiscent of the opening two bars.

In the First Episode the two orchestras divide, the key switches to C major and the time signature (but not the pulse of the music) changes rapidly. The section uses the second and third Tallis phrases alternating with the sway motif.

The solo viola leads off the Second Episode with a variation on the third Tallis phrase in E phrygian marked Poco più animato. The other three members of the quartet join, followed by the two orchestras, while “the string quartet continues its polyphonic meditation”.

The Third Episode explores the sway motif. The quartet and orchestra 1 play together, contrasting with orchestra 2, and moving poco a poco animando to a crescendo to fortissimo. The climax is in . This dies down to a pianissimo &quot;afterglow&quot;.

In the Fourth and shortest episode, marked molto adagio, the sway motif is fragmented. Schwartz describes it as the &quot;deep heart&#x27;s core of the entire piece - a miracle of the imagination”.

The music reverts to the original time and key for the Restatement. The themes return once again plucked on the low strings then taken up by solo violin and viola, while the reunited orchestras provide a “featherbed of sound”.

In Howes&#x27;s analysis, &quot;by way of coda the solo violin soars [and] The work ends on a chord of G major&quot;.

Kennedy observes:
Vaughan Williams revised the work twice: first in January 1913 (for the first London performance), and then again in April 1919, making it more concise each time, taking a total of about two minutes off the original 1910 playing time.

==Reception==
The premiere of the Fantasia received a generally warm welcome, with a few exceptions: Herbert Brewer, the Gloucester cathedral organist, described it as &quot;a queer, mad work by an odd fellow from Chelsea&quot;. The &quot;Musical Times&quot; reviewer said, &quot;It is a grave work, exhibiting power and much charm of the contemplative kind, but it appears over long for the subject-matter&quot;. Other reviews were more enthusiastic. The reviewer in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; praised Vaughan Williams&#x27;s mastery of string effect and added that although the work might not appeal to some because of its &quot;seeming austerity&quot;, it was &quot;extremely beautiful to such as have ears for the best music of all ages&quot;. In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Samuel Langford wrote, &quot;The melody is modal and antique in flavour, while the harmonies are as exotic as those of Debussy … The work marks out the composer as one who has got quite out of the ruts of the commonplace&quot;. In &quot;The Times&quot;, J. A. Fuller Maitland also commented on ancient and Debussian echoes, and observed:

In 1954 Howes wrote:

Listeners of the British classical music radio station Classic FM have regularly voted the piece into the top five of the station&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;, an annual poll of the most popular classical music works.

==Recordings==
Although the BBC first broadcast the Fantasia in 1926, and again over the following decade, conducted by the composer and Arturo Toscanini, it was not until 1936 that the work was recorded for the gramophone. The fledgling Decca company recorded it with Boyd Neel conducting his orchestra under the supervision of the composer in January 1936, a set described by &quot;The Gramophone&quot; as one of the outstanding records of the year. Since then there have been more than fifty recordings by orchestras and conductors from various countries.

<doc id="901361" wikidata="Q2475725" url="?curid=901361" title="Alstonia">
<text>Alstonia is a widespread genus of evergreen trees and shrubs, of the family Apocynaceae. It was named by Robert Brown in 1811, after Charles Alston (1685–1760), professor of botany at Edinburgh from 1716 to 1760.

The type species &quot;Alstonia scholaris&quot; (L.) R.Br. was originally named &quot;Echites scholaris&quot; by Linnaeus in 1767.

==Description==
&quot;Alstonia&quot; consists of about 40–60 species (according to different authors) native to tropical and subtropical Africa, Central America, Southeast Asia, Polynesia and Australia, with most species in the Malesian region.

These trees can grow very large, such as &quot;Alstonia pneumatophora&quot;, recorded with a height of 60 m and a diameter of more than 2 m. &quot;Alstonia longifolia&quot; is the only species growing in Central America (mainly shrubs, but also trees 20 m high).

The leathery, sessile, simple leaves are elliptical, ovate, linear or lanceolate and wedge-shaped at the base. The leaf blade is dorsiventral, medium-sized to large and disposed oppositely or in a whorl and with entire margin. The leaf venation is pinnate, with numerous veins ending in a marginal vein. Phyllotaxy is whorled i.e. two or more leaves arises at a node and form a whorl .

The inflorescence is terminal or axillary, consisting of thyrsiform cymes or compound umbels. The small, more or less fragrant flowers are white, yellow, pink or green and funnel-shaped, growing on a pedicel and subtended by bracts. They consist of 5 petals and 5 sepals, arranged in four whorls. The fertile flowers are hermaphrodite. The gamosepalous green sepals consist of ovate lobes, and are distributed in one whorl. The annular disk is hypogynous. The five gamesepalous petals have oblong or ovate lobes and are disposed in one whorl. The corolla lobes overlapping to the left (such as &quot;A. rostrata&quot;) or to the right (such as &quot;A. macrophylla&quot;) in the bud. The ovary has 2 separate follicles with glabrous or ciliate, oblong seeds that develop into deep blue podlike, schizocarp fruit, between 7–40 cm long. The plants contain a milky latex, rich in poisonous alkaloids. Fijians use the latex of &quot;A. costata&quot; (&quot;saurua&quot;, &quot;sorua&quot;) as a form of chewing gum. The &quot;Alstonia macrophylla&quot; is commonly known in Sri Lanka as &#x27;Havari nuga&#x27; or the &#x27;wig banyan&#x27; because of its distinct flower that looks like a woman&#x27;s long wig.

&quot;Alstonia&quot; trees are used in traditional medicine. 

Many &quot;Alstonia&quot; species are harvested for timber, called &quot;pule&quot; or &quot;pulai&quot; in Indonesia and Malaysia. Trees from the section &quot;Alstonia&quot; produce lightweight timber, while those from the sections &quot;Monuraspermum&quot; and &quot;Dissuraspermum&quot; produce heavy timber.

&quot;Alstonia&quot; trees are widespread and mostly not endangered. However a few species are very rare, such as &quot;A. annamensis&quot;, &quot;A. beatricis&quot;, &quot;A. breviloba&quot;, &quot;A. stenophylla&quot; and &quot;A. guangxiensis&quot;.

==Species==
&quot;Alstonia&quot; has five distinct sections, each a monophyletic group; &quot;Alstonia&quot;, &quot;Blaberopus&quot;, &quot;Tonduzia&quot;, &quot;Monuraspermum&quot;, &quot;Dissuraspermum&quot;.

<doc id="901369" wikidata="Q1664842" url="?curid=901369" title="Pet peeve">
<text>A pet peeve, pet aversion, or pet hate is a minor annoyance that an individual finds particularly irritating to a greater degree than the norm.

==Origin of the concept==
The noun &quot;peeve&quot;, meaning an annoyance, is believed to have originated in the United States early in the twentieth century, derived by back-formation from the adjective &quot;peevish&quot;, meaning &quot;ornery or ill-tempered&quot;, which dates from the late 14th-century.

The term &quot;pet peeve&quot; was introduced to a wide readership in the single-panel comic strip &quot;The Little Pet Peeve&quot; in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; during the period 1916–1920. The strip was created by cartoonist Frank King, who also created the long-running &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; strip. King&#x27;s &quot;little pet peeves&quot; were humorous critiques of generally thoughtless behaviors and nuisance frustrations. Examples included people reading the inter-titles in silent films aloud, cracking an egg only to smell that it&#x27;s gone rotten, back-seat drivers, and rugs that keep catching the bottom of the door and bunching up. King&#x27;s readers submitted topics, including theater goers who unwrap candy in crinkly paper during a live performance, and (from a 12-year-old boy) having his mother come in to sweep when he has the pieces of a building toy spread out on the floor.

==Current usage and examples==
Pet peeves often involve specific behaviors of someone close, such as a spouse or significant other. These behaviors may involve disrespect, manners, personal hygiene, relationships, and family issues. A key aspect of a pet peeve is that it may well seem acceptable or insignificant to others, while the person is likewise not bothered by things that might upset others. For example, a supervisor may have a pet peeve about people leaving the lid up on the copier, when others interrupt when speaking, or their subordinates having messy desks.

<doc id="901372" wikidata="Q2143805" url="?curid=901372" title="Thompson River">
<text>The Thompson River is the largest tributary of the Fraser River, flowing through the south-central portion of British Columbia, Canada. The Thompson River has two main branches, the South Thompson River and the North Thompson River. The river is home to several varieties of Pacific salmon and trout. The area&#x27;s geological history was heavily influenced by glaciation, and the several large glacial lakes have filled the river valley over the last 12,000 years. Archaeological evidence shows human habitation in the watershed dating back at least 8,300 years. The Thompson was named by Fraser River explorer, Simon Fraser, in honour of his friend, Columbia Basin explorer David Thompson. Recreational use of the river includes whitewater rafting and angling.

==Geography==
===South Thompson River===
The South Thompson originates at the outlet of Little Shuswap Lake at the town of Chase and flows approximately southwest through a wide valley to Kamloops where it joins the North Thompson. Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway and the mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway parallel the river. Little Shuswap Lake is fed by the Little River, which drains Shuswap Lake, which is fed by several rivers and creeks.

===North Thompson River===

The North Thompson originates at the toe of the Thompson Glacier in the Cariboo Mountains west of the community of Valemount and flows generally south towards Kamloops and the confluence with the South Thompson. For most of its length, the river is paralleled by Highway 5, and the Canadian National Railway (both of which cross the river a couple times). The North Thompson passes by several small communities, the most notable being Blue River, Clearwater &amp; Barriere.

The North Thompson picks up the Clearwater River at the town of Clearwater. The Clearwater, the North Thompson&#x27;s largest tributary, drains much of Wells Gray Provincial Park.

A notable feature along the North Thompson is &quot;Little Hells Gate&quot;, a mini-replica of the much larger rapid on the Fraser downstream from the mouth of the Thompson. About upstream from the small town of Avola, the river is forced through a narrow chute only about wide creating a rapid that resembles the Fraser&#x27;s famous rapid.

===Mainstream===

At Kamloops, the combined Thompson River flows from the confluence of the North and South Thompson Rivers before reaching Kamloops Lake, which is roughly in length, ending at the town of Savona. From there it flows in a meandering course westwards through a broad valley area. At Ashcroft, the Thompson Canyon begins and the river turns southwestward to its confluence with the Fraser. The river is paralleled by the Trans-Canada Highway, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railway.

From Ashcroft to Lytton, the river is completely confined within Thompson Canyon, making for spectacular scenery. The Thompson River joins the Fraser River in Lytton. There is a striking stretch of dark black cliffside just downstream from Ashcroft and visible from the Logan Lake-Ashcroft highway is officially named the Black Canyon. Just below the town of Spences Bridge was the site of a major rail disaster in the early 20th century. Communities along this section are Bighorn, Shaw Springs, and Goldpan.

== Geology ==
The Thompson River valley has existed in some form for at least 50 million years; however, for much of its history, it did not drain to the southwest into the Pacific Ocean as it does today. Geologists believe water from the river flowed northward, through the Cariboo region, eventually entering what is the modern-day Peace River drainage basin and ending up in the Arctic Ocean. This flow direction is estimated to have ended approximately 2 million years ago, as the Pleistocene era of heavy glaciation began.

=== Glacial lakes ===
During the era of massive glaciers in the Thompson River valley, water from the area likely drained eastward, through the Shuswap Lake area into what is now the Columbia River drainage. This flow direction was influenced by large ice buildups in the Thompson valley, which created extensive glacial lakes. Two large glacial lakes, Glacial Lake Thompson and Glacial Lake Deadman, occupied much of the modern river&#x27;s course from 13,000 BCE to 10,000 BCE. These deep, narrow, ribbon-shaped lakes held large volumes of water; Glacial Lake Thompson held nearly at its highest point. The lake stretched from Spences Bridge in the west to the eastern reaches of Shuswap Lake, as well as far up the northern reaches of the North Thompson river valley. The last large glacial lake, Lake Deadman, was drained by a catastrophic ice dam failure, called a &quot;jökulhlaup,&quot; in about 10,000 BCE. This event released as much as of water southwest into the Fraser River system, possibly depositing sediments as far away as the Salish Sea, more than away. From this point, the Thompson waters stopped flowing eastward into the Columbia River system, and the river became a tributary of the Fraser.

=== Landslides ===

Because of large deposits of glacial silt, sand, and gravel in the lower Thompson River valley, large landslides are common. The area downstream from the town of Ashcroft is prone to landslide events; eight major events between 1880 and 1982 have been recorded. Several of them have obstructed the river, and caused large, temporary lakes. An 1880 slide caused the formation of a short-lived lake over 14 kilometers long with a maximum depth of 18 meters. These slides have caused major damage to the rail lines and farming operations in the river valley. Heavy irrigation has been blamed for some of the events.

== History ==

=== Aboriginal peoples ===

The Interior region of British Columbia was first populated after the retreat of the continental ice sheets of the last ice age. The ice moved out of the Thompson River region approximately 11,000 BCE, and migration by the ancestors of the Nlaka&#x27;pamux and Secwepemc people is thought to have occurred soon after. Some of the older archaeological sites on the lower Thompson include the Drynoch Slide site, near Spences Bridge, with artifacts dating to about 7350 BCE, and the Landels site, near Ashcroft, which dates to older than 8000 BCE. Archaeologists theorize early settlers lived in small groups, beginning with nomadic bands hunting ungulates on the plateaus around the river, who then established more permanent dwellings along the river benches as their fishing techniques developed.

The South Thompson has the watershed&#x27;s oldest dated evidence of human habitation, at the Gore site near Pritchard. The human remains date to 8250 BCE, and bone analysis suggests the person was a hunter with small amounts of his protein coming from salmon. Archaeological investigation in the North Thompson has been sparse, but artifacts near Bridge Lake to the west of the river have been dated to 3000 BCE, while pieces found near the tributary Clearwater River are possibly as old as 6000 to 7000 BCE.

=== European exploration and settlement ===
Explorer of the Fraser River and North West Company employee Simon Fraser named the river, after passing its mouth on the Fraser in 1808. He named the river after his colleague, David Thompson, who had mapped much of western Canada and was at the time exploring the Columbia River basin to the east. Thompson never visited the river that bears his name. The first documented traverse of the Thompson from Kamloops to Lytton was by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company governor George Simpson in 1828. More Europeans entered the Thompson River valley in the early to mid 1800s, drawn by the fur trade and small gold rushes. Others started farming on the fertile benches of the river, and a North West Company trading fort at the confluence of the North and South rivers became the city of Kamloops, now the largest human population center in the watershed.

== Ecology ==

The Thompson River supports 24 fish species, including two considered endangered. It also hosts carp, which are not native to the watershed. The river is home to large populations of Pacific salmon, including coho, sockeye, pink and chinook. Through its tributary, the Adams River, the Thompson has one of the largest sockeye salmon runs in the world. Pink salmon spawn mostly below Kamloops Lake, while coho spawning beds are found in 40 of the Thompson watershed&#x27;s streams and rivers. Coastal rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus&quot;), including an anadromous variety called steelhead, are found in the river along with a local strain the Kamloops rainbow trout which occurs in Kamloops Lake at the Thompson River headwaters and other nearby lakes. Other fish species include round whitefish, largescale sucker, bridgelip sucker, northern pikeminnow, longnose dace, and slimy sculpin.

Several bird species are found in Thompson River environments, including osprey, merganser, wood ducks, and American dippers. Golden eagles are found near the confluence with the Fraser, and Bald eagles congregate on the river during the salmon run. Trumpeter swans use the South Thompson on their migratory route. Rattlesnakes are found in the dry sagebrush regions of the lower river. Aquatic insects found in the river system are dominated by three groups: mayflies, midges, and caddisflies. Many of these species emerge with the spring snowmelt, which greatly increases the volume of flow on the river.

== Conservation and recreation ==
The Thompson River and its two branches are mostly unprotected through parks or reserves. Small sections of the river are within provincial parks, including Steelhead, Juniper, Goldpan, and North Thompson Provincial Parks. Some of its tributaries, such as the Clearwater, are more protected through large parks like Wells Gray. However, unlike major river systems to the north and east like the Columbia and Nechako, the Thompson has no hydroelectric dams or major man-made water diversions. Under the British Columbia Fish Protection Act of 1997, the Thompson cannot be considered for future dam construction.

Conservation of the Thompson&#x27;s fisheries, especially its salmon population, has been a focus of provincial, federal, and international bodies, such as the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and the Pacific Salmon Commission.
===Angling===
From the 1950s through the early 1990s the Thompson River was considered one of the premier steelhead angling destinations in North America. The river hosted large runs of both summer and winter run anadromous coastal rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus&quot;). In the late 1980s the runs were estimated at over 10,000 fish. The river attracted anglers from around the world seeking powerful Thompson River steelhead. In 1982, the average male winter run Thompson River steelhead was . By the late 1990s, steelhead populations began to decline due to a wide variety of adverse environmental conditions and overfishing by commercial and First Nations gill netters. In 2016, annual steelhead numbers entering the Thompson were estimated to be less than 400 fish. Low numbers have prompted conservation organizations and sportsman&#x27;s associations to petition Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), for Canada&#x27;s Species At Risk Act (SARA) protections. The river is subject to catch and release angling only for steelhead and has severely restricted seasons to protect the wild stocks of remaining steelhead.

=== Whitewater rafting ===
The rapids of the lower Thompson are used for recreational whitewater rafting. The first commercial rafting operation on the river began in the 1970s, based out of Spences Bridge. Notable whitewater features on the lower river include the Frog, named for a frog-shaped rock formation, and the Jaws of Death, named by CPR engineers. Rapids on the river reach up to Class 5 on the International Scale of River Difficulty.

<doc id="901374" wikidata="Q696965" url="?curid=901374" title="The Twelve Kingdoms">
<text>is a series of fantasy novels written by Japanese author Fuyumi Ono and illustrated by Akihiro Yamada. The first entry in the series called &quot;The Twelve Kingdoms: Sea of Shadow&quot; was published by Kodansha in Japan in 1992; the last Kodansha volume was released in 2001. In 2012, the series was resumed under the Shinchō Bunko line from Shinchosha. Shinchosha has also begun reprinting the older volumes with new cover and interior art from Akihiro Yamada. The first new publication of the series in six years was released in 2019. 

An English-language translation was produced and distributed by Tokyopop. The first four volumes were released between March 2007 and November 2010, before the license reverted back to Kodansha. 

On November 20, 2024, Seven Seas Entertainment announced that they had acquired the license to publish a new translation of the series in English, with the first volume scheduled for release in July 2025.

It was adapted into an anime television series by Pierrot in 2002, which aired on Japan&#x27;s NHK from April 2002 to August 2003. The series was licensed and distributed by Media Blasters in the United States at the time of its initial Japanese broadcast. As of 2019, Discotek Media held the license to the series.

==Plot==

Yoko Nakajima, an unhappy high school student, is one day suddenly faced with a strange man who swears allegiance to her. After a battle with demon-like beasts, he then takes her to another world along with two of her classmates. There, her appearance has changed and she can understand the language, though her classmates cannot. Their status as &quot;Kaikyaku&quot; (people who come from Earth) makes them hunted fugitives, so they wander the land of the 12 countries, simply trying to survive and figure out the reason they were brought to this world.

===Setting===
&quot;The Twelve Kingdoms&quot; tells several stories from the world of the Twelve Kingdoms. It is located on a group of several islands in another dimension accessible from our world through portals created from naturally-occurring magic (though the other way around is normally impossible). The portals occur in the ocean waters of Japan and China, and ever so often will end up dragging someone from our world from those waters to the kingdoms&#x27; islands, and/or on rare occasion, pulling an unborn child from the kingdoms into our world, causing them to be born there. On the islands, magic works and societies similar to those of classical Japan and China exist. While the inhabitants of the kingdoms are aware of the existence of our world as the lands of Hourai (Japan) and Kunlun (China), the reverse is not true for any inhabitants of our world. The inhabitants of the kingdoms speak a different language than the languages of our world, both of which can be learned by either side. Only through extraordinary circumstances can the two worlds affect each other to a certain extent.

In this world, there are a total of thirteen lands. At the center of the world lies the Koukai (the Yellow Sea) and Five Mountains where the Gods communicate their will to the Twelve Kingdoms of the world. Each of the Twelve Kingdoms possesses their own ruler and its own Kirin, a divine creature which embodies the will of heaven and is entrusted to choose a kingdom&#x27;s ruler by Tentei: Emperor of Heaven. The Kirin serves as the ruler&#x27;s aide. The ruler will have immortal life as long as they keep the kingdom healthy and their heads are not severed from their body. If the ruler&#x27;s Kirin dies or is killed, the ruler will die within a year.

The Koukai, known as the Yellow Sea, is surrounded by four inland seas: the Black Sea in the north, the Blue Sea to the east, the Red Sea in the south, and the White Sea to the west. Eight of the Twelve Kingdoms (Kei, En, Ryu, Kyou, Han, Sai, Sou, and Kou) border at least one of these four seas, extending from the center like the petals of a flower. The remaining four kingdoms (Tai, Hou, Ren, and Shun) are not part of the central mainland and are isolated by the (Void Sea) which surrounds the lands of the Twelve Kingdoms.

==Publication==
There are seven novels in the &quot;Twelve Kingdoms&quot; series, plus two short story collections. The novels are illustrated by Akihiro Yamada. Some of the novels have been published in two or more volume editions such that the total number of volumes is sixteen (as originally released in Japan).

Before she started work on &quot;Twelve Kingdoms&quot;, Fuyumi Ono wrote (Kodansha: September 1991, ; Shinchosha reprint: July 2012, ), a horror novel about a boy from another world. She later worked certain events from this novel into the &quot;Twelve Kingdoms&quot; series. Short stories set in the various kingdoms include , , , and ; these stories have been collected into one volume, &quot;Kasho no Yume&quot;. One short story, , published in 1997, accompanied the drama CD for &quot;Higashi no Wadatsumi, Nishi no Sōkai&quot; and remains uncollected elsewhere. In February 2008, the new &quot;Twelve Kingdoms&quot; short story, was published in Shinchosha&#x27;s &quot;Yomyom&quot; magazine, followed by in September 2009. &quot;Hisho no Tori&quot; and &quot;Rakushou no Goku&quot; were later collected into a volume of short stories titled &quot;Hisho no Tori&quot;, along with two new previously unpublished stories in 2013.

===U.S. release===
====Tokyopop====
In 2006, U.S. publisher Tokyopop acquired the rights to publish the novels under its &quot;Pop Fiction&quot; imprint. The first book was released in March 2007. Only the first four books were released before the license expired.

====Seven Seas Entertainment====
In 2024, Seven Seas Entertainment announced that they had acquired the license to publish the novels with a new translation under their “Airship” imprint. The first volume is scheduled for release in July 2025.

==Media==
===Anime===
The anime adaptation by studio Pierrot aired from April 9, 2002, to August 30, 2003, in Japan on NHK for forty-five episodes. The opening theme is &quot;Juunigenmukyoku&quot; by Kunihiko Ryo while the ending theme is &quot;Getsumei-Fuuei&quot; by Mika Arisaka. The anime series has been released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States by Media Blasters, which are now out of print. The license was transferred to Discotek Media, who released the complete series on Blu-ray in 2019.

===Animanga===
Kodansha printed a fifteen-volume &quot;animanga&quot; series in 2002–2004 by combining images from the anime series with printed dialogue and sound effects. It has been released only in Japanese.

===Video games===
Konami has released in Japan two games based on &quot;Twelve Kingdoms&quot;, both produced by Takashi Shimomichi. They are &quot;Juuni Kokuki: Guren no Shirube Koujin no Michi&quot; and &quot;Juuni Kokuki: Kakukakutaru Oudou Kouryoku no Uka&quot;. Both games contain footage from the anime and many stills of the characters are used during conversation and during battle. The games are sprite-based, with small sprites used on-screen and larger, highly animated sprites used during battle.

Juuni Kokuki: Guren no Shirube Koujin no Michi was released for PlayStation 2 on August 28, 2003. It follows Yoko&#x27;s journey to becoming Empress of Kei. While classified as an RPG, it is often described as an adventure game. The game was re-released in Konami&#x27;s The Best lineup on June 9, 2004. Yoko is capable of summoning Keiki&#x27;s Shirei into battle as well as having additional party members.

Juuni Kokuki: Kakukakutaru Oudou Kouryoku no Uka was released for PlayStation 2 on April 4, 2004, and is a sequel to the first game, continuing with Yoko&#x27;s problems after she becomes the monarch of Kei. Game data from the first game can be loaded into the second. This game contains more RPG elements than the first with party-/menu-based battles becoming standard. Many of the event scenes are pulled from the novels but there are also scenes made just for the game.

==Reception==
By March 2020, the novel series had over 12 million copies in circulation.

Costello (1895), &quot;The Siwash, their life, legends and tales&quot;, the Duwamish used the name &quot;Sunh-a-do&quot; for the Olympian Mountains (or Coast Range in Costello 1895); besides its unclear origin, some references misuse this name for the Native American name of the mountain. Spanish explorer Juan Pérez named the mountain &quot;Cerro Nevado de Santa Rosalía&quot; (&quot;Snowy Peak of Saint Rosalia&quot;) in 1774. This is said to be the first time a European named a geographic feature in what is now Washington state. On July 4, 1788, British explorer John Meares gave the mountain its present name.

In 1890 an expedition, led by US Army officer Joseph P. O&#x27;Neil, reached the summit, of what is today presumed to have been the southern peak.

On March 2, 1909, Mount Olympus National Monument was proclaimed by President Theodore Roosevelt. On June 28, 1938, it was designated a national park by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1976 the Olympic National Park became an International Biosphere Reserve. In 1981 it was designated a World Heritage Site. In 1988 Congress designated 95% of the park as the Olympic Wilderness.

==Climate==
The peak of Mount Olympus has a tundra climate (ET) with extremely heavy precipitation from October to April and heavy precipitation from May to September. A large part of this precipitation falls as snow. The west peak is the wettest place in mainland USA.

<doc id="901378" wikidata="Q716294" url="?curid=901378" title="José Vicente Rangel">
<text>José Vicente Rangel Vale (10 July 1929 – 18 December 2020) was a Venezuelan politician and journalist. He ran for president three times in the 1970s and 1980s and later supported Hugo Chávez. He served under Chávez as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1999 to 2001, as Minister of Defense from 2001 to 2002, and as the vice president from 2002 to 2007.

==Political activism==

Born in Caracas, he returned to Venezuela following the downfall of the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez in 1958 and was elected to the Congress that same year, representing the Democratic Republican Union (&quot;Unión Republicana Democrática,&quot; URD). In addition to his political activities, he worked as a lawyer and journalist. He also made presidential bids on three occasions: in the 1973 presidential election and 1978 presidential election as candidate of &quot;MAS – Movimiento al Socialismo&quot; (Movement for Socialism), and in the 1983 presidential election as candidate of &quot;MEP – Movimiento Electoral del Pueblo&quot;.

==Journalist==
In 1990, Rangel re-entered journalism, contributing to a range of newspapers as a columnist (including &quot;El Universal&quot;, &quot;Panorama&quot;, &quot;El Informador&quot;, &quot;La Tarde&quot;, &quot;El Regional&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;). In the 1960s he was editor of the weekly &quot;Qué Pasa en Venezuela&quot; (1960–67) and of the dailies &quot;La Razón&quot; and &quot;Clarín&quot;.

Rangel played a role in the 1993 impeachment of President Carlos Andrés Pérez, being the first to publish (in November 1992) the corruption allegations which would ultimately be endorsed by the Supreme Court. On 20 May 1993, the Supreme Court considered the accusation valid, and the National Congress removed Pérez from office. He was imprisoned and sentenced to two years of prison in May 1994 for malversation of funds of the so-called secret fund. For many years he has held a political opinion show on Televen called &quot;José Vicente Hoy&quot;.

==Political career==
Hugo Chávez chose Rangel to serve as his Minister of Foreign Affairs when he took office as president in February 1999. Rangel served in that position until early February 2001, when Chávez instead appointed him as Minister of Defence, replacing General Ismael Hurtado. Rangel was the first civilian to serve as Defense Minister in decades.

After a little more than a year as Minister of Defense, Rangel became vice-president in May 2002, replacing Diosdado Cabello. On 3 January 2007, Chávez announced that Rangel would be replaced as vice president by Jorge Rodríguez. Chávez said that the decision was &quot;not easy&quot;, and that he regarded Rangel &quot;with the same respect and affection as a son would a father&quot;, but did not explain the reasoning behind the decision. At the swearing in ceremony for the new cabinet on 8 January, Rangel said that he was leaving the government, but not the revolution. He and Rodríguez exchanged praise, with the latter saying that Rangel was the first person he had ever voted for, in the 1983 election.

==Personal life and death==
Rangel was the author of &quot;Expediente Negro&quot;, an investigation of human rights violations in Venezuela in the 1960s and 1970s. His son, José Vicente Rangel Ávalos, has also been involved in Venezuelan politics, having been mayor of the Sucre District in Caracas. Rangel died of cardiac arrest on 18 December 2020. He was 91 years old.

<doc id="901382" wikidata="Q900638" url="?curid=901382" title="Interaction picture">
<text>In quantum mechanics, the interaction picture (also known as the interaction representation or Dirac picture after Paul Dirac, who introduced it) is an intermediate representation between the Schrödinger picture and the Heisenberg picture. Whereas in the other two pictures either the state vector or the operators carry time dependence, in the interaction picture both carry part of the time dependence of observables. The interaction picture is useful in dealing with changes to the wave functions and observables due to interactions. Most field-theoretical calculations use the interaction representation because they construct the solution to the many-body Schrödinger equation as the solution to the free-particle problem plus some unknown interaction parts.

Equations that include operators acting at different times, which hold in the interaction picture, don&#x27;t necessarily hold in the Schrödinger or the Heisenberg picture. This is because time-dependent unitary transformations relate operators in one picture to the analogous operators in the others.

The interaction picture is a special case of unitary transformation applied to the Hamiltonian and state vectors.

==Definition==

Operators and state vectors in the interaction picture are related by a change of basis (unitary transformation) to those same operators and state vectors in the Schrödinger picture.

To switch into the interaction picture, we divide the Schrödinger picture Hamiltonian into two parts:
 + H_{1,\text{S}}.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}
Any possible choice of parts will yield a valid interaction picture; but in order for the interaction picture to be useful in simplifying the analysis of a problem, the parts will typically be chosen so that &quot;H&quot;0,S is well understood and exactly solvable, while &quot;H&quot;1,S contains some harder-to-analyze perturbation to this system.

If the Hamiltonian has &quot;explicit time-dependence&quot; (for example, if the quantum system interacts with an applied external electric field that varies in time), it will usually be advantageous to include the explicitly time-dependent terms with &quot;H&quot;1,S, leaving &quot;H&quot;0,S time-independent: + H_{1,\text{S}}(t).&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}We proceed assuming that this is the case. If there &quot;is&quot; a context in which it makes sense to have &quot;H&quot;0,S be time-dependent, then one can proceed by replacing formula_1 by the corresponding time-evolution operator in the definitions below.

===State vectors===

Let formula_2 be the time-dependent state vector in the Schrödinger picture. A state vector in the interaction picture, formula_3, is defined with an additional time-dependent unitary transformation.
 t / \hbar} | \psi_\text{S}(t) \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}

===Operators===

An operator in the interaction picture is defined as
 t / \hbar} A_\text{S}(t) \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} H_{0,\text{S}} t / \hbar}.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}
Note that &quot;A&quot;S(&quot;t&quot;) will typically not depend on and can be rewritten as just &quot;A&quot;S. It only depends on if the operator has &quot;explicit time dependence&quot;, for example, due to its dependence on an applied external time-varying electric field. Another instance of explicit time dependence may occur when &quot;A&quot;S(&quot;t&quot;) is a density matrix (see below).

====Hamiltonian operator====

For the operator formula_4 itself, the interaction picture and Schrödinger picture coincide:
:formula_5
This is easily seen through the fact that operators commute with differentiable functions of themselves. This particular operator then can be called formula_4 without ambiguity.

For the perturbation Hamiltonian formula_7, however,
:formula_8
where the interaction-picture perturbation Hamiltonian becomes a time-dependent Hamiltonian, unless [&quot;H&quot;1,S, &quot;H&quot;0,S] = 0.

It is possible to obtain the interaction picture for a time-dependent Hamiltonian &quot;H&quot;0,S(&quot;t&quot;) as well, but the exponentials need to be replaced by the unitary propagator for the evolution generated by &quot;H&quot;0,S(&quot;t&quot;), or more explicitly with a time-ordered exponential integral.

====Density matrix====

The density matrix can be shown to transform to the interaction picture in the same way as any other operator. In particular, let and be the density matrices in the interaction picture and the Schrödinger picture respectively. If there is probability to be in the physical state |&quot;ψ&quot;&quot;n&quot;⟩, then
:formula_9

===Time-evolution===

====Time-evolution of states====

Transforming the Schrödinger equation into the interaction picture gives

:formula_10

which states that in the interaction picture, a quantum state is evolved by the interaction part of the Hamiltonian as expressed in the interaction picture. A proof is given in Fetter and Walecka.

====Time-evolution of operators====

If the operator &quot;A&quot;S is time-independent (i.e., does not have &quot;explicit time dependence&quot;; see above), then the corresponding time evolution for &quot;A&quot;I(&quot;t&quot;) is given by
:formula_11

In the interaction picture the operators evolve in time like the operators in the Heisenberg picture with the Hamiltonian .

====Time-evolution of the density matrix====

The evolution of the density matrix in the interaction picture is

:formula_12

in consistency with the Schrödinger equation in the interaction picture.

==Expectation values==

For a general operator formula_13, the expectation value in the interaction picture is given by

:formula_14

Using the density-matrix expression for expectation value, we will get

:formula_15

==Schwinger–Tomonaga equation==
The term interaction representation was invented by Schwinger.
In this new mixed representation the state vector is no longer constant in general, but it is constant if there is no coupling between fields. The change of representation leads directly to the Tomonaga–Schwinger equation:
:formula_16
:formula_17
Where the Hamiltonian in this case is the QED interaction Hamiltonian, but it can also be a generic interaction, and formula_18 is a spacelike surface that is passing through the point formula_19. The derivative formally represents a variation over that surface given formula_19 fixed. It is difficult to give a precise mathematical formal interpretation of this equation.

This approach is called the &#x27;differential&#x27; and &#x27;field&#x27; approach by Schwinger, as opposed to the &#x27;integral&#x27; and &#x27;particle&#x27; approach of the Feynman diagrams.

The core idea is that if the interaction has a small coupling constant (i.e. in the case of electromagnetism of the order of the fine structure constant) successive perturbative terms will be powers of the coupling constant and therefore smaller.

== Use ==

The purpose of the interaction picture is to shunt all the time dependence due to &quot;H&quot;0 onto the operators, thus allowing them to evolve freely, and leaving only &quot;H&quot;1,I to control the time-evolution of the state vectors.

The interaction picture is convenient when considering the effect of a small interaction term, &quot;H&quot;1,S, being added to the Hamiltonian of a solved system, &quot;H&quot;0,S. By utilizing the interaction picture, one can use time-dependent perturbation theory to find the effect of &quot;H&quot;1,I, e.g., in the derivation of Fermi&#x27;s golden rule, or the Dyson series in quantum field theory: in 1947, Shin&#x27;ichirō Tomonaga and Julian Schwinger appreciated that covariant perturbation theory could be formulated elegantly in the interaction picture, since field operators can evolve in time as free fields, even in the presence of interactions, now treated perturbatively in such a Dyson series.

<text>The Blessed and the Damned is a double CD best of compilation album by American heavy metal band Iced Earth. The CD-booklet can be reversed, to show either angels or demons on the cover. The booklet also includes Jon Schaffer&#x27;s comments on previous albums and his life. Even though the CD was released after &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot;, the biography in the booklet makes no mention of it. This is probably because Iced Earth left their record label Century Media Records prior to &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot;, and signed with SPV. In turn, Century Media released this compilation album.

<text>31 minutos (English: &quot;31 minutes&quot;) is a Chilean comedy television series and a children&#x27;s music virtual band created by the production company Aplaplac (owned by Álvaro Díaz, Pedro Peirano and Juan Manuel Egaña) that was first broadcast March 15, 2003 on Televisión Nacional de Chile (TVN). The program is a parody of , a controversial news program broadcast on the same channel throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Its format as a current affairs news program led by host Tulio Triviño frames a variety of unexpected and humorous events involving various members of the news team. The show features both explicit and implicit educational messages alongside content simply designed to show ridiculous and funny situations.

In its first period, the series had three seasons, from 2003 to 2005, in addition to a participation for the 2003 Chilean Telethon and a Christmas special that same year. On March 27, 2008, the series was taken to the cinema under the title of &quot;31 minutos, la película&quot;.

After the third season and for the next nine years the series had no new episodes. In 2012, the production company Aplaplac confirmed that the series would return to television with a fourth season, which was released on October 4, 2014 through TVN, and its last original episode was broadcast on the night of December 27, 2014. During its run, the series received universal acclaim from critics and viewers alike, with praise directed to its clever humour, soundtrack, accessibility towards children about complex issues and helping to revitalize the Chilean puppetry tradition.

From 2004 to 2007, it was broadcast throughout Latin America by Nickelodeon and from 2015, it began to be broadcast by Cartoon Network. It also broadcasts in Mexico on Canal Once and Once Niños, and its most recent season is available in the Netflix Latin America catalog.

&quot;31 minutos&quot; has performed throughout Chile and Mexico, making the program a musical band. On their tours they perform the songs broadcast on the program and their musical works outside of it.

== History ==

=== Origins and foundation of Aplaplac ===

The origins of &quot;31 minutos&quot; date back to 1990, when its creators Álvaro Díaz and Pedro Peirano entered the Universidad de Chile to study journalism and met each other for the first time. At first, Díaz did not meet with Peirano nor was he interested in talking to him, but they got together to do some academic work, which led both of them to realize that they shared the same sense of humor and to become friends. The two met again in 1995, when they produced programs such as &quot;Plan Z&quot; and &quot;El Factor Humano&quot; for the Chilean television channel Rock &amp; Pop. But, contrary to their expectations, neither production prospered. In addition, the channel ceased broadcasting on December 1, 1999, leaving both Peirano and Diaz unemployed.

To get out of this situation, they founded the production company Aplaplac together with Juan Manuel Egaña. Initially, Aplaplac developed two programs: &quot;Sangre, sudor y lágrimas&quot; (Blood, Sweat and Tears), —a human-interest program bought by the sports channel PSN—, and &quot;Mira tú&quot; (Look at You), a cultural program produced with funds from the Consejo Nacional de Televisión in 2001 and broadcast by Televisión Nacional de Chile in 2002.

&quot;Mira tú&quot; stood out for its quality and became the production company&#x27;s letter of introduction, therefore Díaz, Peirano and Egaña applied for a second time to a CNTV competition fund in 2002, this time in the children&#x27;s television category. The project presented was entitled &quot;El gabinete del Doctor Mojado&quot; (The Wet Doctor&#x27;s Cabinet), and in it a fish was conducting a television program from a fishbowl. In one of its segments, a puppet reported on what was happening with the excrements in the treatment plants. Aplaplac won the contest and obtained funds to produce 21 episodes that would be broadcast on Televisión Nacional de Chile. The idea evolved into a puppet and marionette news show called &quot;31 minutos&quot; -—a name that originated from the contest rules, which mentioned that the projects had to last half an hour—.

At the same time, Peirano worked at the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, where he met the artist Rodrigo Salinas, who -together with the artists Daniel Castro and Matias Iglesis- formed the art collective La nueva gráfica chilena. Peirano invited them to be part of the production team for 31 minutos, leaving Salinas and Castro as scriptwriters —along with Díaz and Peirano—, Iglesis as art director —establishing the visual identity of the program and its characters— and Juan Manuel Egaña as executive producer of Aplaplac and &quot;31 minutos&quot;. Due to requirements from TVN, a stable female character had to be included in the episodes. The actress and comedian Alejandra Dueñas —known from La nueva gráfica chilena— later joined the team, giving life to Patana&#x27;s character.

The conviction of their creators at the beginning was to make a type of television program that they would have liked to see as children. They were fully aware that minors no longer consumed only programs that were aimed at a child audience and, based on that, came to the idea that a satire of the news had to be made. The idea also arose of inventing songs and presenting them in a musical classification. To that end, Peirano —who shared friendship with the members of the Chilean funk rock group Chancho en Piedra— introduced Pablo Ilabaca —guitarist of that band—, who brought with him a compact disc of tracks without lyrics, with which he didn&#x27;t know what to do. The first instrumental Díaz and Peirano heard was the one that later became the central theme of &quot;31 minutos&quot;, of which they quickly became fond. The rest of the tracks were used for the soundtrack of the episodes, along with other songs invented by the team. Ilabaca remained as the music producer for &quot;31 minutos&quot;, giving rise to the Ranking Top segment, of which the character Policarpo Avendaño —interpreted by Daniel Castro— is in charge.

=== Success and internationalization ===
&quot;31 minutos&quot; made its debut on March 15, 2003. Its first episodes marked 6 points of screen rating, but as time went on it began to popularize and increase its audience to an average of 14 points. Initially it was a news show of interest to children, however, as the program progressed in its first season, it went from being a parody of news to becoming a character comedy. In view of the popularity achieved by the program in 2003, the creators agreed to produce a second and third season, this time with funds from the channel.

Part of the program&#x27;s success lies in its script and characters, with hidden references to Chile&#x27;s social reality. It has also been successful among young and adult audiences: the double entendre that it handles is manifested, for example, in the fact that the puppets are ironic imitations of real Chilean television characters, and recall events or television events that characterized Chile in the 1970s and 1980s.

The commercial success of the program was reflected in the appearance of several products based on it. On July 8, 2003, a studio album called &quot;31 minutos&quot; was released, with the songs that were part of the musical classification of the first season of the program. It naturally sold out all its copies in less than a day and came to sell more than 200,000 copies. Not only was an album released, but on July 28, 2004, there was a release of &quot;31 canciones de amor y una canción de Guaripolo&quot;, which included the songs of the second season. The name of the album refers to the book &quot;Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada&quot; by Pablo Neruda. Its premiere took place in the Paseo Ahumada in Santiago and, despite not surpassing the phenomenon achieved by its predecessor, in one week it sold 20,000 copies and achieved the position of platinum record. The songs of the third season were compiled in the album &quot;Ratoncitos&quot; -in which the musician Angelo Pierattini-, which was awarded a gold record a few days after its release. In addition to the records with the songs of the program, near Christmas 2003 the home videos &quot;Lo mejor de 31 minutos&quot; and &quot;Los Policarpo Top Top Top Awards&quot; were released, which together sold more than 35,000 records. This fact made them the best selling local DVDs in the history of Chile.

The popularity obtained with the program has led its characters to be part of publicity and propagandistic campaigns in Chile. For example, Tulio and Bodoque appeared in commercial messages on the transport system of Santiago de Chile, Transantiago, to educate people on how to behave on the buses. In 2010, UNICEF released a commercial entitled &quot;Rearmemos la vida de niños y niñas&quot; (Let&#x27;s revive the lives of children) with the aim of raising morale after the 2010 Chile earthquake. These ads show Tulio talking about the fear he feels from the tremors, but his friends from the news encourage him by telling him that together everything is better and that it is normal to feel fear. Another ad with UNICEF was about short films showing musical numbers in which Patana gives Tulio advice on how to prevent influenza. In addition, since 2015, Mario Hugo has been the face of the Santiago Metropolitan Regional Government&#x27;s campaign entitled &quot;Cuidado con el perro&quot; (Be careful with your dog), which calls for sterilization, responsible ownership and care of dogs in public spaces.

The second season of &quot;31 minutos&quot; made its debut on March 20, 2004 on Televisión Nacional de Chile, and simultaneously the program began to be known in other countries. On June 9, 2004, Nickelodeon&#x27;s Latin American signal bought the first two seasons of the series, and premiered them on September 17 of the same year. The network broadcast the episodes until 2007. Thanks to Nickelodeon&#x27;s children&#x27;s audience, the program became internationalized, with good reception in countries such as Mexico and Brazil —where it was dubbed into Portuguese— On June 19, 2005, the third season began to be broadcast on TVN, consisting of only 15 episodes.

Mexico was the first country other than Chile to broadcast the series on open television when it premiered in 2006 on Canal 11. Thanks to Canal 11&#x27;s broadcasting, in 2007 the EMI label released the album &quot;31 minutos&quot; for the first time in Mexico. Both events made &quot;31 minutos&quot; a popular hit in the country. Ro Velázquez —a member of the Mexican group Liquits— came up with the idea of producing a tribute album for the program in which fanatical artists chose their favorite song to record in their own way. The project became official with the release of &quot;La regla primordial&quot; —from the album &quot;Ratoncitos&quot;— versioned by Tepetokio (a duo formed by Mexican singer Rubén Albarrán and his wife Psykini) as a single. The tribute was named &quot;Yo nunca vi televisión&quot; and was published in December 2009 under the label Terricolas imbéciles. In it, fourteen Chilean and Mexican artists performed some songs from the first three albums of &quot;31 minutos&quot;. Yo nunca vi televisión was distributed in Mexico and the southern United States, and sold about 5,000 copies in its first weeks. In addition to its physical version, it was uploaded to the iTunes store for downloading.

=== Theater plays and concerts ===
At the end of 2010, &quot;31 minutos&quot; performed a play called &quot;Resucitando una estrella&quot; (&quot;Resuscitating a Star&quot;). The plot revolved around a television talent show, where Tulio Triviño and other characters were looking for the best old-fashioned artist to give them the chance to be again. These performances began as a tour of southern Chile to bring joy to people in the localities most devastated by the earthquake of February 27 that year, but some time later the play arrived in Mexico, in 2012.On March 31, 2012 they performed at the Lollapalooza Chile festival. Juan Manuel Egaña received an invitation and, together with Felipe Ilabaca —bass player of Chancho en Piedra—, convinced Díaz and Peirano to participate —who, at first, considered the event as a humorous one— It was such an impact that the band (composed by the musicians Pablo Ilabaca on the electric guitar, Felipe Ilabaca on the bass, Camilo Salinas on the keyboards and Pedropiedra on the drums, together with the voice actors of the program) scheduled four presentations for July in the Movistar Arena of Santiago. These events were very well attended and popular, in addition to being released on a live album called &quot;Gira Mundial&quot; —under the label Feria Music—. In the second half of 2012 the Organizing Committee of the 2013 Viña del Mar International Song Festival confirmed &quot;31 minutos&quot; as one of the national artists for the journey. They performed on February 27, 2013, being the first puppet group to set foot in the Quinta Vergara. In more than an hour and a half of presentation they achieved a show that was praised by the press and applauded by the audience present, which gave them the 4 maximum awards of the evening. They also achieved the maximum position of tune of the 2013 edition of the festival: 53 points of screen share. Coinciding with the same day of the presentation, the company Amnesia Games developed a game of &quot;31 minutos&quot; for cellular phones in alliance with the producer Aplaplac and the telephone company Claro Chile. The game stood out in the stores of Windows Phone and Amazon and managed to position itself in the first places of the App Store.

In view of the success achieved at the festival, they decided to play the stages again, but this time with &quot;Radio Guaripolo&quot;, a show directed by Alvaro Diaz and written by Pedro Peirano, which officially opened at the Teatro Municipal de Las Condes. In it, Guaripolo owns a radio station, where he plays pranks on the phone to the rest of the characters of &quot;31 minutos&quot;. One of the most important events of this production was the premiere of the song &quot;Mi mamá me lo teje todo&quot;, which would later be part of the soundtrack of the fourth season.

=== Fourth season and present ===
In addition, after nine years of absence, &quot;31 minutos&quot; announced its return to television, according to an interview given by Aplaplac to the Chilean newspaper La Tercera. The fourth season began its recordings in 2013 and was broadcast on TVN. In addition, the program again won a fund from the CNTV to finance it. The team underwent restructuring, such as the change of Juan Manuel Egaña —who became Manager of Management and Development of Chilevisión— to Alejandra Neumann in the executive production of Aplaplac and the series, and the performance of Juanín, who although dubbed by Salinas did not participate as a puppeteer in the recordings, so the actor Héctor Velozo had to take his place. Salinas only brought his characters to life live in the presentation at the 2013 Viña del Mar Festival.

This season&#x27;s premiere was on October 4, 2014, viewed for the first time in HD (16:9) format. The first episode marked 9.3 points of screen share, but was surpassed by the program &quot;Morandé con compañía&quot; of the Chilean television channel Mega —which obtained more than 15—. It ended the night of December 27, 2014 after a cycle of twelve episodes. Despite the low results it obtained on Televisión Nacional de Chile, from October 2015 it was bought and transmitted by the Cartoon Network signal to Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, and then began to be broadcast to all of Latin America by Boomerang. On January 5, 2020 it was added to Netflix Latin America.

During the premiere of the fourth season&#x27;s chapters, &quot;31 minutos&quot; adapted their 2003 Christmas special to a montage entitled &quot;Calurosa Navidad&quot;, with which they performed during the month of December at the Centro de las Artes 660 in Las Condes. The program had already established itself as a band, and Díaz and Peirano decided to focus their future on touring and live concerts. During 2015, they prepared a play based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, which was presented in January 2016 as part of the Santiago a Mil International Festival. It was then shown at venues such as the Teatro Municipal de Las Condes in April 2016 and the Teatro Oriente de Providencia in July of the same year. It again participated in the 2017 version of the Santiago a Mil International Festival.

On September 12, 2015, Aplaplac independently released the album &quot;Arwrarwrirwrarwro&quot; —where the songs of the fourth season are located—. The album had a pre-sale in Mexico, in July of the same year, during a presentation of &quot;Radio Guaripolo&quot;. Pablo Ilabaca and Álvaro Díaz were in charge of its production, but it had the support of Felipe Ilabaca, Camilo Salinas and Pedropiedra in the instruments.

On the other hand, &quot;Radio Guaripolo&quot; performed for the last time at the Festival Osorno de la Leche y la Carne, on January 30, 2016. For the tour in Mexico 2016, Aplaplac released &quot;Tremendo Tulio Tour&quot;, a parody of the tributes of artists for their careers, where they give one to Tulio Triviño. The success of the tour led them to play live for the first time in Argentina and Colombia. The first performance took place at the Usina del Arte in Buenos Aires on April 21, 2018. This was the last show in which Pedropiedra participated as drummer for &quot;31 minutos&quot;, so Leonardo Corvalán —drummer for Chancho en Piedra— took his place. The second was at the Festival Rock al Paque in Bogotá on June 30, 2019, with three performances on the same day.

In January 2019, a fifth studio album was confirmed, without relying on the music of a season. To promote it, the first single was &quot;Ritmo sideral&quot;, released on October 11, 2019. It was followed by &quot;Perro chico&quot; and &quot;Lucía, la sandía&quot;, which appeared on November 22, 2019 and January 17, 2020, respectively. On November 20, 2019, the organizers of the Mexican festival Vive Latino released the line-up for its 21st edition, where it highlighted &quot;31 minutos&quot; with a double performance, on March 14 and 15, 2020 with a special show. They named the show &quot;Yo nunca vi televisión&quot; —like the homonymous song on the first album of &quot;31 minutos—&quot;, and in it they recreated the format of a newscast —like in the TV series— and played a repertoire of songs of which &quot;Ritmo sideral&quot; and &quot;Perro chico&quot; were part. During February 2020 a tour in Mexico was scheduled in which &quot;Yo nunca vi televisión&quot; was to perform during March in the cities of San Luis Potosí, Guadalajara and Mérida, but to prevent contagion from the COVID-19 pandemic it was decided to reschedule the dates for October of the following year. Of the original presentations, &quot;31 minutos&quot; could only be presented on both days at the Vive Latino festival. The crisis caused by this disease was the reason for &quot;31 minutos&quot; to join for the third time with UNICEF to launch the &quot;Cuarentena 31&quot; campaign, with the aim of addressing issues that affect children during confinement. The capsules were broadcast on Cartoon Network and Boomerang Latinoamécica, and on July 29, 2020, a song entitled &quot;Primavera&quot; was launched to encourage people in the midst of the health crisis. On September 1, 2020, UNICEF named &quot;31 minutos&quot; as Goodwill Ambassadors for UNICEF Chile.

Díaz and Peirano have stated on multiple occasions that it is not possible to make a fifth season for Chilean television, because this is not a format where the program can remain —adding to this the high costs of production—. The reinvention through tours, new songs and records has been key to the validity of the franchise. In any case, none of them have ruled out the possibility of making it on streaming platforms, according to the interest of these.

== Characters ==
&quot;31 minutos&quot; is conducted by Tulio Triviño Tufillo, a millionaire gray chimpanzee who is self-centered, but ignorant and short on understanding. He is the best friend of Juan Carlos Bodoque, a red rabbit. He is the program&#x27;s star journalist and is in charge of the environmental section &quot;La Nota Verde&quot;. He is moody, bohemian, witty, an occasional poet, a womanizer, but above all, a great gambler addicted to horse racing and betting at the hippodrome. Juanín Juan Harry is the studio&#x27;s general producer, but on the other hand the only survivor of his species, the Juanines. He loves his work and everyone is aware that he is the one who does everything. Policarpo Avendaño is the entertainment commentator, owner of the music segment &quot;Ranking Top&quot;. Mario Hugo is an absent-minded reporter, owner of many dogs. He is madly in love with Patana Tufillo, a young intern journalist, who is also Tulio&#x27;s niece. This team is joined by Calcetín con Rombos Man, the superhero defender of children&#x27;s rights, and Guaripolo, who calls himself the &quot;favorite character of kids of &quot;31 minutos&quot;&quot;, although nobody knows him.

== Dub ==
Despite being mostly broadcast in Latin American countries in their original language, &quot;31 minutos&quot; has been dubbed for broadcast in other countries. The first two seasons of the program were dubbed into Portuguese by Nickelodeon under the studio Álamo for broadcast in Brazil during 2004 and 2007, and later season four in the studio Unidub (with the same actors) for Netflix Brazil.  A pilot dubbed into Spanish from Europe was shown to Spanish channels in 2004, however, it was not until 2008 that the series was broadcast in Spain through the VeoTV channel, but with its original audio. A fragment of episode fifteen of the second season (Hielito) was also shown in Holland as a segment within another show, and its dubbing was done by the comedian Niels van der Laan, who played all the characters.
== Film ==
 Since the success of their first season, Diaz and Peirano had a much larger project in mind, a film of &quot;31 minutos&quot;. This began to be developed after the completion of the third season&#x27;s production.  The incidental music was provided by Pablo Ilabaca and Angelo Pierattini —who had already worked together on the album of the third season &quot;Ratoncitos&quot;—. The recordings began in Chile in October 2006 and ended in the summer of 2007 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil —where the production company Total Entertainment joined in to provide the cinematic experience that Aplaplac did not have—. However, the post-production and sound process delayed the film, with things like a telephone casting to choose the voices of Tulio, Bodoque, and Juanín in their childhood. In September 2007, Peirano went to review the co-production in Spain. Because he was not carrying cash, he was not allowed into the country, which he was able to enter only after the intervention of the Chilean embassy.

Finally the series was brought to the big screen under the name of &quot;31 minutos, la película&quot;, and was released in Chile on March 27, 2008, in Mexico on October 16, 2009 and in Brazil on August 3, 2012. With this film the series was given a temporary end. In total, 210,000 spectators attended to see the film in Chile. Despite being praised, it did not collect what it cost to produce it, which led Aplaplac into an economic crisis for two years, and its members had to work on other projects. In addition, they were affected by a robbery at the production company&#x27;s offices.

== Spin-offs ==

Aplaplac has produced several mini-series with the characters of &quot;31 minutos&quot;. As a project for the National Museum of Dentistry of the University of Chile, the production company made a four-episode web series called &quot;Las muelas de Guaripolo&quot;, in which this character appears teaching the public information about dental hygiene and its history. Together with Las muelas de Guaripolo, in 2017, &quot;31 minutos&quot; in collaboration with the Ministry of Health of Chile made the web series &quot;La nube de humo&quot;. This mini-series consists of three chapters of four to five minutes and deals with how Juan Carlos Bodoque —already retired from journalism— decides to fall into Ramona&#x27;s requests to do a report on air pollution in Chile.

On July 11, 2009, &quot;Las vacaciones de Tulio, Patana y el pequeño Tim&quot; premiered on TVN. The program —which consists of 12 episodes— is designed as a spin-off of &quot;31 minutos&quot;, that is, a production derived from some of its characters; and the one chosen was precisely Tulio Triviño, the self-centered news anchor who now moves to his lavish summer cabin with his niece Patana and Tim, a friend of hers. The stay is boring, so Tulio entertains his little companions by telling them stories, and so each chapter begins. It is worth mentioning that Juan Carlos Bodoque is also present in Tulio&#x27;s stories giving ecological advice.

<doc id="901393" wikidata="Q7195812" url="?curid=901393" title="Pingry School">
<text>The Pingry School is a coeducational, independent, college preparatory country day school in New Jersey, with a Lower School (K–5) campus in the Short Hills neighborhood of Millburn, a Middle (6–8) and Upper School (9–12) campus in the Basking Ridge section of Bernards Township, and a campus for experiential learning in Pottersville. The school was founded in 1861 by John F. Pingry. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.

== Student body ==
The school currently enrolls 1,129 students; 288 at Short Hills and 841 at Basking Ridge; 270 in the Middle School and 571 in the Upper School. Students come from 100 area communities in twelve counties and over 90 municipalities in New Jersey.

As of the 2017–18 school year, the middle and upper schools had an enrollment of 841 students and 118 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 7.1:1. The school&#x27;s student body was 48.5% (408) White, 22.0% (185) two or more races, 18.1% (152) Asian, 9.0% (76) Black and 2.1% (18) Hispanic.

In 2022, the SAT and ACT scores for the middle 50% of students were 1290-1540 and 30-34, respectively.

The school claims an acceptance rate across all of its grades of 12%.

==Awards and recognition==
Niche ranks Pingry 1st on its list of 2023 Best Private K-12 Schools in New Jersey and 2nd on its list of Best College Prep Private High Schools in New Jersey. Over the years, Pingry has been frequently ranked by Niche in the top 3 in New Jersey and in the top 1% nationally.

== History ==
Pingry School was founded by John Francis Pingry, a Presbyterian minister, in 1861 to provide both scholastic training and moral education for boys. The outbreak of the American Civil War that year caused enrollment to dry up at the Pingry Select School for Boys, an academy Pingry had founded in 1854 in Roseville. After learning that the only professional educator in Elizabeth, New Jersey, had decided to enlist in the Union Army, Pingry moved to Elizabeth in 1861 where he founded the Pingry School. Although Pingry gave talks on Proverbs and used the Bible for instructional purposes, the school has never been affiliated with any church or denomination.

The school moved from the Elizabeth schoolhouse to the Parker Road campus in 1893. After Pingry&#x27;s death in 1893, several headmasters with relatively short tenures held his position.

C. Mitchell Froelicher was headmaster from 1917 to 1920. He was succeeded by Charles Bertram Newton who focused on the Country Day School philosophy and served until 1936. From 1936 to 1961, E. Laurence Springer was headmaster, and his tenure was the longest in Pingry&#x27;s history. He oversaw the 1953 move from Elizabeth to Hillside, New Jersey, and a new facility constructed at a cost of $1.6 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

Early in the 1970s, Pingry began the transition to a coeducational school. The first female students, who graduated in 1976, were succeeded by other young women who today represent half the student body. Pingry grew with its 1974 merger with the Short Hills Country Day School to become a school with grades from kindergarten through grade 12. In this period of about twenty years, David C. Wilson and H. Wescott Cunningham each served as headmaster.|date=January 2025}}

In 1983, the school moved to Martinsville, a rural area in the Watchung and Somerset Hills. The campuses are approximately 25 minutes apart, and both are located near the New York metropolitan area, which continues to provide many outside resources to supplement the classroom. The old campus in Hillside is now used as a campus of Kean University. In 2013, the Martinsville location was renamed to &quot;Basking Ridge&quot; in an effort to make it easier to locate the campus using automated mapping tools.

In 1987, John Hanly became headmaster. He served until 2000. Today, the Hanly Lecture on Ethics and Morality holds his name. John Neiswender became headmaster after Hanly, and served until 2005. Nathaniel Conard was headmaster from July 2005 to mid-2019. In late 2018, the school announced that Matt Levinson, of University Prep in Seattle, would be Head of School after Conard retired in mid-2019. Since Pingry&#x27;s day, there have been 16 headmasters.

In April 2020, the school received an unspecified amount in federally backed small business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The school received scrutiny over this loan, which was meant to protect small and private businesses. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted that the schools should return the money, but Levinson stated they were keeping it, despite having an $80-million-plus endowment, due to the &quot;significant challenges to our ability to serve our community&quot; caused by the pandemic.

In February 2021, Purnell School announced that it would cease operations upon the completion of the 2020-2021 academic year. Later that year, Pingry School paid $5 million for the campus in Pottersville in Somerset County, which will be used as an extension of its existing campuses.

== Athletics ==
The Pingry School Big Blue competes in the Skyland Conference, which is comprised of public and private high schools in Essex, Morris, and Somerset counties in west central New Jersey, and operates under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association. Pingry is also a member of the New Jersey Independent School Athletic Association. Prior to the NJSIAA&#x27;s 2010 realignment, the school had previously participated in the Colonial Hills Conference which included public and private high schools covering Essex County, Morris County and Somerset County in west Central Jersey. With 435 students in grades 10-12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2019–20 school year as Non-Public A for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 381 to 1,454 students in that grade range (equivalent to Group I for public schools). The school was classified by the NJSIAA as Non-Public Group B (equivalent to Group I/II for public schools) for football for 2024–2026, which included schools with 140 to 686 students.

The school offers 33 varsity teams, with a total of over 70 teams covering seventh to twelfth grade. Many of the school&#x27;s athletes have been recognized as athletic scholars, and many have gone on to play for college teams.

== Sexual abuse scandal ==

=== Initial allegations ===

On March 29, 2016, The Pingry School sent a letter to &quot;parents of current students, the entire alumni and school trustees&quot; informing them that the School had &quot;recently learned from a few of our alumni that students were sexually abused by Thad Alton, an employee of Short Hills Country Day School from 1972 to 1974 and, following the merger of the two institutions, an employee of the Pingry School from 1974 to 1978.&quot; The letter stated that Pingry had hired a security firm to conduct an investigation on behalf of the school. The letter was signed by Headmaster Nathaniel E. Conard and Jeffrey N. Edwards, chair of the board of trustees.

At that time, Crew Janci LLP, &quot;a law firm that specializes in suing schools and youth organizations for their negligent handling of sexual abuse[,] announced it has been investigating Alton&#x27;s tenure at Pingry for over a year.&quot; Crew Janci LLP&#x27;s investigation on behalf of the victims was &quot;credited with persuading the 166-year-old [Pingry] school to launch its own investigation[.]&quot; Crew Janci&#x27;s website made clear that its investigation on behalf of the victims would continue, despite the announcement of the Pingry School&#x27;s commissioning of an investigation.

On April 1, 2016, &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; revealed court documents indicating that Alton had previously been convicted for his sexual abuse of Pingry students. The spokesperson for the Pingry School was quoted as responding to this information by saying: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid such a conviction is news to us&quot; and that &quot;[i]t wasn&#x27;t until recently that the [Pingry] school&#x27;s current administration knew anything about this situation in the &#x27;70s, which prompted us to act[.]&quot;

A news article published on April 8, 2016, detailed how Alton moved from Pingry School in 1978 to The Peck School, &quot;10 miles away in Morristown.&quot; The Peck School sent a letter to its alumni explaining &quot;that Alton had nothing but &#x27;positive job references&#x27; when he was hired, fresh from six years at the Short Hills Country Day School, which merged with Pingry.&quot;

After leaving the Peck School in 1979, Alton continued on as an educator at Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York until he was arrested in December 1989 in relation to his sexual abuse of more than 50 children.

On April 27, 2016, &quot;The Star- Ledger&quot; ran a report of interviews with several of the victims. Then, on April 28, &quot;Pingry Survivors&quot; – a group of individuals who were sexually abused as children while at Pingry— posted an open letter to the &quot;Pingry Community.&quot;

In their open letter, the Pingry Survivors stated their goals as follows: &quot;(1) For the Pingry Community to learn the whole truth about the extent of the problem of child sexual abuse at the Pingry School – including a complete and accurate disclosure about the School&#x27;s response at the time of the abuse (and since); (2) For The Pingry School to hear, understand, and acknowledge the suffering of each victim and to make meaningful amends; and, (3) For The Pingry School to dedicate itself to ensuring that this history can never be repeated (including an independent review of policies, practices, and culture, as well as implementation of meaningful changes).&quot; The Pingry Survivors went on to say that they &quot;hope that we and the current Pingry School leadership – with the support of the greater Pingry Community – can find a path forward that is collaborative and allows for true healing and reconciliation.&quot;

=== Outcome ===

During the year following Pingry&#x27;s announcement of its investigation in March 2016, the school&#x27;s child sexual abuse scandal was mentioned in multiple national media reports on private schools with pervasive sexual abuse in their pasts, including &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

On March 28, 2017, The Pingry School released a letter announcing that it had concluded its &quot;independent investigation into the sexual abuse allegations and circumstances surrounding Thad Alton&#x27;s tenure.&quot; The school posted a &quot;Report to the Pingry Community&quot; on a website other than its official page called &quot;www.pingryresponse.org.&quot; It is unclear whether the school received a more comprehensive investigative report. The &quot;Report to the Pingry Community&quot; substantiated 27 victims of child sexual abuse by Alton, as well as abuse by other former Pingry faculty and staff.

The school announced that their investigator&#x27;s report &quot;affirms the abuse by former Pingry teacher and assistant Lower School principal Thad Alton. Pingry&#x27;s investigative report revealed that at least one &quot;school board member learned of Alton&#x27;s activities in 1979,&quot; but that the Pingry School &quot;never shared the information with its faculty, alumni or the family of its students.&quot;

The school acknowledged in its letter that &quot;the culture, structure, and policies of the school... allowed such atrocities to occur in the past.&quot; The school asserted:

&quot;[W]e are deeply sorry for the pain the survivors have suffered, and are grateful to them for coming forward. In our commitment to ongoing efforts to fully understand and address these troubling events in Pingry&#x27;s past, we will be engaging with survivors to learn how we can best support them. Our hope is to heal as a community and continue to foster the culture of safety and well-being that our students deserve. This healing requires our continued partnership, collaboration, and candor.&quot;

In the days after the release of the Pingry School&#x27;s report, victims of abuse at Pingry went to the media with their stories about the abuse and the impact it had on their lives. In some of those media reports, the &quot;Pingry Survivors&quot; group asserted &quot;their school knew what was going on&quot; with the abuse at the time it was occurring.

Alton has never been criminally prosecuted for his sexual abuse of most of the Pingry victims. He lives in Manhattan and is a registered sex offender in the State of New York.

On December 4, 2017, an article appeared on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; detailing Pingry&#x27;s attempts to invoke to statute of limitations to avoid compensating former students who were victims of sexual abuse at the school.

<text>Memoirs of a Geisha is a historical fiction novel by American author Arthur Golden, published in 1997. The novel, told in first person perspective, tells the story of Nitta Sayuri and the many trials she faces on the path to becoming and working as a geisha in Kyoto, Japan, before, during and after World War II.

In 2005, a film adaptation was released, directed by Rob Marshall and starring Zhang Ziyi in the lead role.

==Plot summary==

In 1929, nine year-old Sakamoto Chiyo and her sister are sold by their father to work within the entertainment districts of Kyoto. They are taken from their home in a coastal fishing village known as Yoroido and travel to Kyoto by train. Chiyo is taken to the Nitta (geisha boarding house) in Gion to become a geisha, but her sister is taken to a brothel within Kyoto&#x27;s pleasure district.

Chiyo is introduced to Auntie, Mother, and Granny. Both Auntie and Mother are strict, though Auntie is kinder to Chiyo, whereas Mother is driven by money and business. Chiyo is also introduced to Hatsumomo, the premier geisha of the , its primary earner, and one of the most famous geisha of Gion, and Pumpkin, another maid at the okiya. Hatsumomo dislikes Chiyo and goes out of her way to torment her. When Chiyo fails an attempt to run away with her sister, Mother refuses to continue investing in Chiyo&#x27;s future as a geisha.

A few years later, Chiyo is given money and a handkerchief in the street by a kind stranger known to Chiyo as the Chairman. Soon afterwards, Pumpkin prepares to make her debut as a and the &quot;younger sister&quot; of Hatsumomo, whilst Chiyo remains a maid. Mameha, another famous geisha in Gion, persuades a reluctant Mother to reinvest in Chiyo&#x27;s training, with Mameha acting as Chiyo&#x27;s mentor and &quot;older sister&quot;.

Chiyo becomes an apprentice geisha with the given name of Sayuri, and is reacquainted with Chairman Iwamura, his closest friend and business partner Nobu, and a number of other prominent men. As Sayuri gains popularity, Hatsumomo tries to hurt Sayuri&#x27;s reputation and career in the hopes of Mother adopting Pumpkin as her heir instead.

Mameha orchestrates a bidding war for Sayuri&#x27;s and uses the record-breaking payment for Sayuri&#x27;s to cover all of her debts. Mother adopts Sayuri, and Hatsumomo begins a downward spiral into alcoholism before being thrown out of the .

In 1944, geisha districts are ordered to close due to the ongoing war, and Sayuri desperately asks Nobu for help to avoid being conscripted into factory work. He sends Sayuri far north to live with his old friend, Arashino, where she stays for much of the war.

At the end of the war, Nobu visits Sayuri, asking that she return to Gion. Sayuri finds Pumpkin working in a new ; despite hoping to rekindle their friendship, Pumpkin later sabotages Sayuri&#x27;s plan to scare Nobu off from proposing to be her , as revenge for taking her place in the adoption so many years ago.

A few days after her plan fails, Sayuri is summoned to meet the Chairman at a teahouse. She confesses that she has worked for years to become close to the Chairman. The Chairman admits that he has always known she was the girl he met on the street, and confesses his feelings for her as well, but felt he owed Nobu – his oldest and closest friend – the chance to be with Sayuri out of kindness. He also admits to having asked Mameha to train Sayuri.

Sayuri peacefully retires from geisha work when the Chairman becomes her . Sayuri relocates to New York City and opens her own small tea house for entertaining Japanese men on business in the United States. The Chairman remains her until his death.

==References to actual locations==
Much of the novel is set in the popular geisha district of Gion in Kyoto, and contains references to actual places frequented by geisha and their patrons, such as the Ichiriki Ochaya. Part of the story is also set in the Amami Islands, and Sayuri narrates the story from her suite in the Waldorf towers in New York City.

==Lawsuit==
After the Japanese edition of the novel was published, Arthur Golden was sued for breach of contract and defamation of character by Mineko Iwasaki, a retired geisha he had interviewed for background information while writing the novel. The plaintiff asserted that Golden had agreed to protect her anonymity if she told him about her life as a geisha, due to the traditional code of silence about their clients. However, Golden listed Iwasaki as a source in his acknowledgments for the novel, causing her to face a serious backlash, to the point of death threats. In his defense, Golden countered that he had tapes of his conversations with Iwasaki. Eventually, in 2003, Golden&#x27;s publisher settled with Iwasaki out of court for an undisclosed sum of money.

Iwasaki later went on to write an autobiography, which shows a very different picture of 20th century geisha life from the one shown in Golden&#x27;s novel. The book was published as &quot;Geisha, A Life&quot; in the US and &quot;Geisha of Gion&quot; in the UK.

==Film version==

In 2005, film director Rob Marshall made a film version of the novel. It stars two Chinese actresses, Zhang Ziyi as Sayuri and Gong Li as Hatsumomo; Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh as Mameha; and four Japanese actors, Ken Watanabe as the Chairman, Koji Yakusho as Nobu, Suzuka Ohgo as Sayuri&#x27;s childhood incarnation Chiyo, and Youki Kudoh as the adult Pumpkin.

Filming was primarily done in California, and in some locations in Kyoto, including Kiyomizu-dera and Fushimi Inari-taisha. It was nominated for and won numerous awards, including nominations for six Academy Awards, winning three: Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Costume Design.

<text>Tan-Tan () is a city in Tan-Tan Province in the region of Guelmim-Oued Noun in southwestern Morocco. It is a desert town with a population (2014 census) of 73,209. It is the largest city in the province and second largest city in the region after the capital Guelmim. It is located on the banks of the wadi Oued Ben khelil, which flows into the Draa River north of the town. The Draa River at is the longest in Morocco and flows into the Atlantic Ocean soon after the confluence with the wadi. The town also has an airport, Tan Tan Plage Blanche Airport.

== Etymology ==
The popular origin of the name is an example of onomatopoeia. The name comes from the well called &quot;Ḥāṣī Ṭānṭān&quot; literally &quot;well of Tan-Tan&quot;, which representatives of most Sahrawi tribes like the Reguibat, Laaroussien and the Ait Lahcin of the Tekna would camp around. The well is called this because when buckets were lowered into the water into it would make the sound &quot;ṭān-ṬĀN&quot; when they hit it.

==History==

The quartz figurine Venus of Tan-Tan was found in a river terrace deposit on the north bank of the Draa River. Dated between 200,000 and 500,000 BCE, it is considered one of the oldest human-form sculptures in the world, although its formation may actually be natural.

==Port==
The nearby port, known as Tan-Tan Plage in French; Port of Tan-Tan in English; and El Ouatia, al-Watiyah or الوطية in Arabic is about west of Tan-Tan on the Atlantic Ocean. With a population in 2004 of 6,294 it is the second-largest settlement in the province and ninth-largest in the region. Both Tan-Tan and Tan-Tan Plage are on Morocco&#x27;s main highway, the N1.

==Climate==
Tan-Tan has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). While usually strongly moderated by the cold offshore Canary Current, occasional easterly winds from the Sahara Desert interior bring exceptionally hot temperatures to the maritime areas of southern Morocco. These winds being frequent in autumn and seasonal lag from warming sea temperatures cause October afternoons to average warmer than the July counterparts. The varying timing of the hot inland winds causes a vast difference between the individual monthly mean maxima and the many months in which brief temperatures above may occur. Even the coldest winter nights remain well above freezing due to the Atlantic influence.

==History==

In May 1685, the Crown hetman and Kraków Voivode Feliks Kazimierz Potocki purchased land along the Bug River. In 1692, he founded a city on the lands of the village Novyi Dvir (, ) and named it &quot;Krystynopol&quot; after his wife Krystyna Lubomirska (the suffix &quot;-pol&quot; derives from Greek &quot;polis&quot;). Potocki made the city his family center. He died here on 22 September 1702. His grandson Franciszek Salezy Potocki built a palace and in 1763 founded a monastery of Basilians (barocco church of Saint George; prior to 1946 – a place of miracles with wondrous icon of the Mother of God). Among the landmarks of the city is Count Potocki&#x27;s palace, constructed by the order of Feliks Kazimierz Potocki after 1692. The city, as Krystynopol, was part of the Polish Kingdom in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1772, when it was incorporated into the Habsburg Empire.

In the 19th century, the &quot;Apostolus Christinopolitanus&quot; and famous chronicle from 1763 to 1779 were kept in the city. The Catholic order of Myrrh-Bearing Sisters was founded by Fr. Yulian Datsii in 1910, with the purpose of gathering funds to build a home for orphans and the poor. The first members of the congregation vowed to build two buildings: one for the people and one for the congregation. In 1913 the first convent arose, where 15 sisters lived.

During the interwar period, it belonged to the Second Polish Republic, and between 1945 and 1951 was part of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. It passed from Poland to the Ukrainian SSR after the territorial exchange in 1951 and had its name changed from Krystynopil () to Chervonohrad, after the color red ().

A local newspaper is published in the city since June 1962. On 1 August 1990, Chervonohrad became the first city in the Soviet Union where a monument to Vladimir Lenin was removed.

Until 18 July 2020, Chervonohrad was designated as a city of oblast significance and belonged to Chervonohrad Municipality. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Lviv Oblast to seven, Chervonohrad Municipality was merged into newly established Chervonohrad Raion. Before being abolished, Chervonohrad Municipality also included the city of Sosnivka (until 2019) and the urban type settlement of Hirnyk.

In August 2023, Ukrainian Institute of National Memory decided that the name of the city did not meet the law &quot;On the Condemnation and Prohibition of Propaganda of Russian Imperial Policy in Ukraine and the Decolonization of Toponymy&quot;, meaning that Chervonohrad will be renamed. On 20 March 2024, the Committee of the Verkhovna Rada on issues of organization of state power, local self-government, regional development and urban planning decided to propose the name Sheptytskyi, in the name of Andrey Sheptytsky, a metropolitan archbishop who taught in the local monastery.

On 19 September 2024, the Verkhovna Rada voted to rename Chervonohrad to Sheptytskyi.

==Krystynopol Jews==

Presently, there are 11–100 Jews residing in Sheptytskyi. The earliest known Jewish community dates back to 1740. In 1931 the Jewish population was 2,200. The Jewish cemetery dates from 18th century with the last known Hasidic burial in 1941. Krystynopol Jews were deported to the Belzec extermination camp in September, 1942. The Jewish surname and rabbinical family Kristinopoler / Kristianpoller stem from the city&#x27;s former name, Krystynopol. Jewish immigrants to America from this city founded the Krystenopoler Synagogue and First Krystenopoler Sick Benevolent Association Brith Isaac in New York. The Jewish cemetery is located in the town center, in Shevska Street.

<doc id="901411" wikidata="Q157706" url="?curid=901411" title="Althaea (plant)">
<text>Althaea is a genus of herbaceous perennial plants native to Europe, North Africa and western Asia. It includes &quot;Althaea officinalis&quot;, also known as the marshmallow plant, whence the fluffy confection got its name. They are found on the banks of rivers and in salt marshes, preferring moist, sandy soils. The stems grow to 1–2 m tall, and flower in mid summer. The leaves are palmately lobed with 3–7 lobes. &quot;Althaea&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Bucculatrix quadrigemina&quot;. 

==Species==
The genus formerly included a number of additional species now treated in the genus &quot;Alcea&quot; (hollyhocks).

, &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; accepts the following species:
*&quot;Althaea armeniaca&quot; 
*&quot;Althaea bertramii&quot; 
*&quot;Althaea cannabina&quot; 
*&quot;Althaea damascena&quot; 
*&quot;Althaea hiri&quot; 
*&quot;Althaea octaviae&quot; 
*&quot;Althaea officinalis&quot; 
*&quot;Althaea oppenheimii&quot; 
*&quot;Althaea villosa&quot; 

==Chemical constituents==
The root contains starch (37%), mucilage (11%), pectin (11%), flavonoids, phenolic acids, sucrose, and asparagine.

==Uses==
The traditional medicinal uses of the plant are reflected in the name of the genus, which comes from the Greek &quot;althainein&quot;, meaning &quot;to heal&quot;.

The flowers and young leaves can be eaten, and are often added to salads or are boiled and fried. The roots and stem also secrete mucilage, which is used to soften the skin, and is used in cosmetic treatments.

The Roman poet Horace refers to his own diet in his Odes, which he describes as very simple: &quot;As for me, olives, endives, and smooth mallows provide sustenance.&quot;

The root has been used since Egyptian antiquity in a honey-sweetened confection useful in the treatment of sore throat. 

The root&#x27;s emulsifying property is used for cleaning Persian carpets in the Middle East. It is regarded as the best method to preserve the vibrancy of vegetable dyes used in coloring the carpet&#x27;s wool.

<doc id="901412" wikidata="Q942049" url="?curid=901412" title="The Philosophy of Composition">
<text>&quot;The Philosophy of Composition&quot; is an 1846 essay written by American writer Edgar Allan Poe that elucidates a theory about how good writers write when they write well. He concludes that length, &quot;unity of effect&quot; and a logical method are important considerations for good writing. He also makes the assertion that &quot;the death... of a beautiful woman&quot; is &quot;unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world&quot;. Poe uses the composition of his own poem &quot;The Raven&quot; as an example. The essay first appeared in the April 1846 issue of &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It is uncertain if it is an authentic portrayal of Poe&#x27;s own method.

==Poe&#x27;s philosophy of composition==
Generally, the essay introduces three of Poe&#x27;s theories regarding literature. The author recounts this idealized process by which he says he wrote his most famous poem, &quot;The Raven&quot;, to illustrate the theory, which is in deliberate contrast to the &quot;spontaneous creation&quot; explanation put forth, for example, by Coleridge as an explanation for his poem &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;. Poe&#x27;s explanation of the process of writing is so rigidly logical, however, that some have suggested the essay was meant as a satire or hoax.

The three central elements of Poe&#x27;s philosophy of composition are:

===Length===
Poe believed that all literary works should be short. He writes, &quot;[...] there is a distinct limit, as regards length, to all works of literary art — the limit of a single sitting [...]&quot; He especially emphasized this &quot;rule&quot; with regard to poetry, but also noted that the short story is superior to the novel for this reason.

===Method===
Poe dismissed the notion of artistic intuition and argued that writing is methodical and analytical, not spontaneous. He writes that no other author has yet admitted this because most writers would &quot;positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes at the fully matured fancies discarded in despair at the cautious selections and rejections&quot;.

===&quot;Unity of effect&quot;===
The essay states Poe&#x27;s conviction that a work of fiction should be written only after the author has decided how it is to end and which emotional response, or &quot;effect&quot;, he wishes to create, commonly known as the &quot;unity of effect&quot;. Once this effect has been determined, the writer should decide all other matters pertaining to the composition of the work, including tone, theme, setting, characters, conflict, and plot. In this case, Poe logically decides on &quot;the death... of a beautiful woman&quot; as it &quot;is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover.&quot; Some commentators have taken this to imply that pure poetry can only be attained by the eradication of female beauty. Biographers and critics have often suggested that Poe&#x27;s obsession with this theme stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his mother Eliza Poe, his foster mother Frances Allan and, later, his wife Virginia.

==&quot;The Raven&quot;==

In the essay, Poe traces the logical progression of his creation of &quot;The Raven&quot; as an attempt to compose &quot;a poem that should suit at once the popular and the critical taste.&quot; He claims that he considered every aspect of the poem. For example, he purposely set the poem on a tempestuous evening, causing the raven to seek shelter. He purposefully chose a pallid bust to contrast with the dark plume of the bird. The bust was of Pallas in order to evoke the notion of scholar, to match with the presumed student narrator poring over his &quot;volume[s] of forgotten lore.&quot; No aspect of the poem was an accident, he claims, but is based on total control by the author.

Even the term &quot;Nevermore,&quot; he says, is based on logic following the &quot;unity of effect.&quot; The sounds in the vowels in particular, he writes, have more meaning than the definition of the word itself. He had previously used words like &quot;Lenore&quot; for the same effect.

The raven itself, Poe says, is meant to become symbolic by the end of the poem. As he wrote, &quot;The reader begins now to regard the Raven as emblematical—but it is not until the very last line of the very last stanza, that the intention of making him emblematical of &quot;Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance&quot; is permitted directly to be seen.&quot; This may imply an autobiographical significance to the poem, alluding to the many people in Poe&#x27;s life who had died.

==Reception==
It is uncertain if Poe really followed the method he describes in &quot;The Philosophy of Composition.&quot; T. S. Eliot wrote that &quot;[i]t is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method.&quot; Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as, &quot;a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization than literary criticism.&quot;

It is apparent, however, that many French literary figures and composers believed that Poe composed &quot;The Raven&quot; in the manner depicted in &quot;The Philosophy of Composition.&quot; Maurice Ravel, in a July 1931 interview, stated that &quot;the finest treatise on composition, in my opinion, and the one which in any case had the greatest influence upon me was [Poe&#x27;s] &quot;Philosophy of Composition... I am convinced that Poe indeed wrote his poem &quot;The Raven&quot; in the way that he indicated.&quot; Charles Baudelaire believed that the &quot;unity of impression, the totality of effect&quot; described by Poe endowed a composition with &quot;a very special superiority.&quot;

==Publication history==
George Rex Graham, a friend and former employer of Poe, declined Poe&#x27;s offer to be the first to print &quot;The Raven&quot;. Graham said he did not like the poem but offered $15 as a charity. Graham made up for his poor decision by publishing &quot;The Philosophy of Composition&quot; in the April 1846 issue of &quot;Graham&#x27;s American Monthly Magazine of Literature and Art&quot;.

<text>Alien vs. Predator (stylized as AVP: Alien vs. Predator) is a 2004 science fiction action horror film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, and starring Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Lance Henriksen, Ewen Bremner, Colin Salmon, and Tommy Flanagan. It is the first film installment of the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; franchise, the fifth film in the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise and third film of the &quot;Predator&quot; franchise, adapting a crossover bringing together the eponymous creatures of the &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot; series, a concept which originated in a 1989 comic book written by Randy Stradley and Chris Warner. Anderson wrote the story, with the creators of the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise, Dan O&#x27;Bannon and Ronald Shusett receiving additional story credit due to the incorporation of elements from the &quot;Alien&quot; series, and Anderson and Shane Salerno adapted the story into a screenplay. Their writing was influenced by Aztec mythology, the comic book series, and the writings of Erich von Däniken. In the film, scientists are caught in the crossfire of an ancient battle between Aliens and Predators as they attempt to escape a bygone pyramid.

&quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; was theatrically released on 13 August 2004. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, but grossed $177.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $60–70 million. A direct sequel, &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot;, was released in 2007.

==Plot==

A Predator ship arrives on Earth and uses a heating device to melt a hole in Antarctic ice. Meanwhile, a satellite detects the heat bloom beneath Bouvetøya, an island about off the coast of Antarctica. Wealthy industrialist Charles Weyland discovers through thermal imaging that there is a pyramid buried beneath the ice. He assembles a team of experts to investigate, including archaeologists, linguists, mercenaries, and a mountaineering guide named Lex Woods. Terminally ill, Weyland desires to claim the discovery in his name.

When the team arrives at the abandoned whaling station, they find a newly made tunnel running directly from the ice’s surface toward the pyramid beneath. The team descends the tunnel and begins to explore the pyramid, soon finding evidence of an ancient civilization and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons that all have ruptured rib cages.

Meanwhile, three Predators ⁠— Scar, Celtic, and Chopper ⁠— arrive and kill the remaining team members on the surface. They make their way down to the pyramid and arrive just as the team unwittingly activates the structure and is trapped within it. The Xenomorph Queen awakens from cryogenic stasis and begins to produce eggs. When the eggs hatch, several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Xenomorphs. The humans take possession of the Predator&#x27;s blasters, and conflict erupts between the Predators, Xenomorphs, and humans. Celtic and Chopper are killed by a Xenomorph (known as Grid), and Weyland buys Lex and Italian archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa enough time to escape from Scar, giving his life in the process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and a Xenomorph before unmasking and marking himself with the acidic blood of the facehugger. After Lex and Sebastian leave, another facehugger attacks Scar.

Through translation of the pyramid&#x27;s hieroglyphs, Lex and Sebastian learn that the Predators have been visiting Earth for millennia. They taught the early human civilization how to build pyramids and were worshipped as gods. Once a century, they visit Earth to take part in a rite of passage by which several humans sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Xenomorphs, creating the &quot;ultimate prey&quot; for the Predators to hunt. As a fail-safe, if overwhelmed, the Predators would activate a self-destruct device to eliminate the Xenomorphs. They deduce that the Predators lured them into the pyramid to use as a sacrifice.

Lex and Sebastian decide that the Predators must be allowed to succeed so that the Xenomorphs do not escape to the surface. Sebastian is captured by a Xenomorph, and Lex returns the blaster to Scar. Grid and the other Xenomorphs attack, but are eventually called away by the Queen, whilst Lex manages to kill a Xenomorph that attacked her. Impressed, Scar uses parts of a dead Xenomorph to fashion weapons for Lex, and the two form an alliance. Lex finds Sebastian, who has become the host of a Xenomorph. She mercy kills him at his request, and Scar kills the infant Xenomorph. 

Meanwhile, the Xenomorphs free the Queen by using her acid blood to melt her restraints, allowing her to break free. Scar activates and detaches a bomb in his wrist module before fleeing with Lex for the tunnel as the Grid and the other Xenomorphs give chase. Lex and Scar reach the surface as the bomb explodes, destroying the pyramid and wiping out the Xenomorphs. After escaping the blast, Scar uses Xenomorph blood to mark Lex&#x27;s cheek as a sign of respect. Suddenly, a still alive Xenomorph Queen emerges from the ice and attacks the pair. After a lengthy battle, they hook the Queen&#x27;s chains to a water tank, but Scar is impaled by the Queen&#x27;s tail. Lex dislodges the water tank, which falls off a cliff and into the ocean, dragging the Queen with it towards the ocean floor. Scar dies from his wounds shortly after. 

A Predator spaceship appears, and its crew retrieves its fallen comrade. An elder Predator sees the hunter scar on Lex&#x27;s face and presents her with a spear as a gift as the spaceship departs. Lex walks over to a snowcat and leaves the area. On the Predator spaceship, Scar&#x27;s body lies at rest when a Predalien chestburster erupts from his chest.

==Production==
===Fifth &quot;Alien&quot; film and sequel===
Before 20th Century Fox gave &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; the greenlight, &quot;Aliens&quot; writer/director James Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth &quot;Alien&quot; film. &quot;Alien&quot; director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating &quot;I think it would be a lot of fun, but the most important thing is to get the story right.&quot; In a 2002 interview, Scott&#x27;s concept for a story was &quot;to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created&quot;; this project eventually became Scott&#x27;s film &quot;Prometheus&quot; (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, Cameron believed the film would &quot;kill the validity of the franchise&quot; and ceased work on his story, &quot;To me, that was &quot;Frankenstein Meets Werewolf&quot;. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it.&quot; After viewing &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, Cameron remarked that &quot;it was actually pretty good. I think of the five &quot;Alien&quot; films, I&#x27;d rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot.&quot; Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, &quot;No. I couldn&#x27;t do that. I couldn&#x27;t quite take that step.&quot; Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to &quot;Aliens&quot;. However, Scott stated in 2017 that the project has been cancelled.

===Development===
The concept of &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; originated from the &quot;Aliens versus Predator&quot; comic book in 1989 and subsequent novelisations and novels. It was also hinted at when an Alien skull appeared in a trophy case aboard the Predator ship in &quot;Predator 2&quot;. Shortly after the release of &quot;Predator 2&quot;, &quot;Predator&quot; co-writer Jim Thomas discussed the possibilities of a &quot;Predator&quot; franchise and commented on the prospect of a crossover film, stating, &quot;I think Predator vs. Alien is a good idea that will probably never happen&quot;. Screenwriter Peter Briggs created the original spec screenplay in 1990–1991, which was based on the first comic series. In 1991, he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, who owned the film franchises, although the company did not move forward with the project until 2002; a video game produced by Capcom as a tie-in to the unmade film saw independent release in 1994. The project was delayed chiefly because the studio was working on &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;. A draft penned by James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox described as &quot;pretty much word-for-word like the Dark Horse comic book&quot; was rejected by producer John Davis, who hoped to give the film an original approach by setting it on Earth.

As there were six producers between the film franchises, Davis had difficulty securing the rights as the producers were worried about a film featuring the two creatures. Paul W. S. Anderson pitched Davis a story he worked on for eight years, adapting the Machiko Noguchi series, and showed him concept art created by Randy Bowen. Impressed with Anderson&#x27;s idea, Davis thought the story was like &quot;Jaws&quot; in that it &quot;just drew you in, it drew you in&quot;. Anderson started to work on the film after completing the script for &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;, with Shane Salerno co-writing. Salerno spent six months writing the shooting script, finished its development, and stayed on for revisions throughout the film&#x27;s production. Dan O&#x27;Bannon and Ronald Shusett received story credit on the film based on elements from their work on the original &quot;Alien&quot;.

===Story and setting===

Early reports claimed the story was about humans who tried to lure Predators with Alien eggs, although the idea was scrapped. Influenced by the work of Erich von Däniken, Anderson researched von Däniken&#x27;s theories on how he believed early civilizations were able to construct massive pyramids with the help of aliens, an idea long debunked and based on misinterpretations of Aztec mythology. Anderson wove these ideas into &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, describing a scenario in which Predators taught ancient humans to build pyramids and used Earth for rite of passage rituals every 100 years in which they would hunt Aliens. To explain how these ancient civilisations &quot;disappeared without a trace&quot;, Anderson came up with the idea that the Predators, if overwhelmed by the Aliens, would use their self-destruct weapons to kill everything in the area. H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s novella &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; (1931) served as an inspiration for the film, and several elements of the &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot; comic series were included. Anderson&#x27;s initial script called for five Predators to appear in the film, although the number was later reduced to three.

As &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; was intended to be a sequel to the &quot;Predator&quot; films and prequel to the &quot;Alien&quot; series, Anderson was cautious of contradicting continuity in the franchises. He chose to set the film on the remote Norwegian Antarctic island of Bouvet, commenting, &quot;It&#x27;s definitely the most hostile environment on Earth and probably the closest to an Alien surface you can get.&quot; Anderson thought that setting the film in an urban environment like New York City would break continuity with the &quot;Alien&quot; series as the protagonist, Ellen Ripley, had no knowledge the creatures existed. &quot;You can&#x27;t have an Alien running around the city now, because it would&#x27;ve been written up and everyone will know about it. So there&#x27;s nothing in this movie that contradicts anything that already exists.&quot;

After the film&#x27;s release, James Muller, a writer who alleged that the screenplay was copied from one he had written eight years earlier sued the studio, the production company and Anderson for copyright infringement. In 2011 federal judge Denny Chin for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the case, holding that no reasonable jury was likely to find anything more than coincidental similarity between the two scripts besides elements so common to the genre as not to be copyrightable. Finding Muller&#x27;s suit &quot;frivolous and objectively unreasonable&quot;, Chin also awarded Fox $40,000 in legal fees.

===Casting===

The first actor to be cast for &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; was Lance Henriksen, who played the character Bishop in &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Alien 3&quot;. Although the &quot;Alien&quot; films are set hundreds of years in the future, Anderson wanted to keep continuity with the series by including a familiar actor. Henriksen plays billionaire and self-taught-engineer Charles Bishop Weyland, a character that ties in with the Weyland-Yutani Corporation as the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries. According to Anderson, Weyland becomes known for the discovery of the pyramid, and as a result the Weyland-Yutani Corporation models the Bishop android in the &quot;Alien&quot; films after him; &quot;when the Bishop android is created in 150 years time, it&#x27;s created with the face of the creator. It&#x27;s kind of like Microsoft building an android in 100 years time that has the face of Bill Gates.&quot;

Anderson opted for a European cast including Italian actor Raoul Bova, Ewen Bremner from Scotland, and English actor Colin Salmon. Producer Davis said, &quot;There&#x27;s a truly international flavor to the cast, and gives the film a lot of character.&quot; Several hundred actresses attended the auditions to be cast as the film&#x27;s heroine Alexa Woods, loosely based on the comic and novel protagonist Machiko Noguchi. Sanaa Lathan was selected, and one week later she flew to Prague to begin filming. The filmmakers knew there would be comparisons to &quot;Alien&quot; heroine Ellen Ripley and did not want a clone of the character, but wanted to make her similar while adding something different.

Anderson reported in an interview that California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was willing to reprise his role as Major Alan &quot;Dutch&quot; Schaeffer from &quot;Predator&quot; in a short cameo appearance if he lost the 2003 recall election on condition that the filming should take place at his residence. Schwarzenegger, however, won the election with 48.58% of the votes and was unavailable to participate in &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;. Actress Sigourney Weaver, who starred as Ellen Ripley in the &quot;Alien&quot; series, said she was happy not to be in the film, as a possible crossover was &quot;the reason I wanted my character to die in the first place&quot;, and thought the concept &quot;sounded awful&quot;.

===Filming and set designs===
Production began in late 2003 at Barrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic, where most of the filming took place. Production designer Richard Bridgland was in charge of sets, props and vehicles, based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios, many of which were interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid&#x27;s carvings, sculptures, and hieroglyphs were influenced by Egyptian, Cambodian, and Aztec civilisations, while the regular shifting of the pyramid&#x27;s rooms was meant to evoke a sense of claustrophobia similar to the original &quot;Alien&quot; film. According to Anderson, if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $20 million. However, in Prague they cost $2 million, an important factor when the film&#x27;s budget was less than $50 million.

Third scale miniatures several meters in height were created to give the film the effect of realism, rather than relying on computer generated imagery (CGI). For the whaling station miniatures and life-sized sets, over 700 bags of artificial snow were used (roughly 15–20 tons). A 4.5-meter miniature of an icebreaker with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created, costing almost $37,000 and taking 10 weeks to create. Visual effects producer Arthur Windus, claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process: &quot;With computer graphics, you need to spend a lot of time making it real. With a miniature, you shoot it and its there.&quot; A scale 25-meter miniature of the whaling station was created in several months. It was designed so the model could be collapsed and then reconstructed, which proved beneficial for a six-second shot which required a re-shoot.

===Visual effects and creatures===

Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics, Inc. (ADI) was hired for the film, having previously worked on &quot;Alien 3&quot; and &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;. Visual and special effects producers Arthur Windus and John Bruno were in charge of the project, which contained 400 effects shots. ADI founders Alec Gillis, Tom Woodruff Jr. and members of their company, began designing costumes, miniatures and effects in June 2003. For five months the creatures were redesigned, the Predators wrist blades being extended roughly four times longer than those in the &quot;Predator&quot; films, and a larger mechanical plasma caster was created for the Scar Predator.

The basic shape of the Predator mask was kept, although technical details were added and each Predator was given a unique mask to distinguish them from each other. These masks were created using clay, which was used to form moulds to create fiberglass copies. These copies were painted to give a weathered look, which Woodruff claims &quot;is what the Predator is all about&quot;. A hydraulic Alien puppet was created so ADI would be able to make movements faster and give the Alien a &quot;slimline and skeletal&quot; appearance, rather than using an actor in a suit. The puppet required six people to run it; one for the head and body, two for the arms, and a sixth to make sure the signals were reaching the computer. Movements were recorded in the computer so that puppeteers would be able to repeat moves that Anderson liked. The puppet was used in six shots, including the fight scene with the Predator which took one month to film.

The crew tried to keep CGI use to a minimum, as Anderson said people in suits and puppets are scarier than CGI monsters as they are &quot;there in the frame&quot;. Roughly 70% of scenes were created using suits, puppets, and miniatures. The Alien queen was filmed using three variations: a 4.8-meter practical version, a 1.2-meter puppet, and a computer-generated version. The practical version required 12 puppeteers to operate, and CGI tails were added to the Aliens and the queen as they were difficult to animate using puppetry. The queen alien&#x27;s inner-mouth was automated though, and was powered by a system of hydraulics. Anderson praised &quot;Alien&quot; director Ridley Scott&#x27;s and &quot;Predator&quot; director John McTiernan&#x27;s abilities at building suspense by not showing the creatures until late in the film, something Anderson wanted to accomplish with &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;. &quot;Yes, we make you wait 45 minutes, but once it goes off, from there until the end of the movie, it&#x27;s fucking relentless&quot;.

==Music==

Austrian composer Harald Kloser was hired to create the film&#x27;s score. After completing the score for &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;, Kloser was chosen by Anderson as he is a fan of the franchises. It was recorded in London, and was primarily orchestral as Anderson commented, &quot;this is a terrifying movie and it needs a terrifying, classic movie score to go with it; at the same time it&#x27;s got huge action so it needs that kind of proper orchestral support.&quot;

The score album was released on iTunes on 9 August 2004, and on CD on 31 August 2004 and received mixed reviews. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic thought Kloser introduced electronic elements well, and called &quot;Alien vs. Predator Main Theme a particularly striking and serves as a continuous creative source for the composer to dip his baton in.&quot; Mike Brennan of Soundtrack, however, said it &quot;lacks the ingenuity of the previous trilogy (&quot;Alien&quot;) and the &quot;Predator&quot; scores, which all shared a strong sense of rhythm in place of thematic content. Kloser throws in some interesting percussion cues (&quot;Antarctica&quot; and &quot;Down the Tunnel&quot;), but more as a sound effect than a consistent motif.&quot; John Fallon of JoBlo.com compared it to character development in the film, &quot;too generic to completely engage or leave a permanent impression.&quot;

==Release==
===Home media===
&quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; was released on VHS, DVD, and PSP UMD Movies in North America on 25 January 2005. The DVD contained two audio commentaries. The first featured Paul W. S. Anderson, Lance Henriksen, and Sanaa Lathan, while the second included special effects supervisor John Bruno and ADI founders Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff. A 25-minute &quot;Making of&quot; featurette and a Dark Horse &quot;AVP&quot; comic cover gallery were included in the special features along with three deleted scenes from the film. On release, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; debuted at number 1 on the Top DVD Sales and Top Video Rental charts in North America.

A two-disc &quot;Extreme Edition&quot; was released on 7 March 2005, featuring behind the scenes footage of the film. An &quot;Unrated Edition&quot; was released on 22 November 2005, containing the same special features as the Extreme Edition as well as an extra eight minutes of footage in the film. John J. Puccio of DVD Town remarked that the extra footage contained &quot;a few more shots of blood, gore, guts, and slime to spice things up...and tiny bits of connecting matter to help us follow the story line better, but none of it amounts to much.&quot;

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; grossed $80.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $97.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $177.4 million. &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported the film was &quot;extremely profitable&quot; for the studio.

The film was released in North America on August 13, 2004 in 3,395 theaters, and grossed $38.2 million in its opening weekend (an average of $11,278 per venue), finishing first at the box office. The film spent 16 weeks in theaters. It grossed $9 million in the United Kingdom, $16 million in Japan, and $8 million in Germany. It ranks third behind &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Prometheus&quot; at the domestic box office, and at the time was the highest-grossing film of both the &quot;Predator&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot; franchises (and to-date is the third best total, behind Romulus and &quot;Prometheus&quot;).

===Critical response===
 On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 29 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Rick Kisonak of &quot;Film Threat&quot; praised the film stating, &quot;For a big dumb production about a movie monster smackdown, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; is a surprisingly good time&quot;. Ian Grey of the &quot;Orlando Weekly&quot; felt, &quot;Anderson clearly relished making this wonderful, utterly silly film; his heart shows in every drip of slime.&quot; Staci Layne Wilson of Horror.com called it &quot;a pretty movie to look at with its grandiose sets and top notch creature FX, but it&#x27;s a lot like Anderson&#x27;s previous works in that it&#x27;s all facade and no foundation.&quot; Gary Dowell of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; called the film, &quot;a transparent attempt to jumpstart two run-down franchises&quot;. Ed Halter of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described the film&#x27;s lighting for fight sequences as, &quot;black-on-black-in-blackness&quot;, while Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; felt the lighting &quot;left the audience in the dark&quot;.

==Other media==
===Sequel===

A sequel titled &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; was released in December 2007.

===Related film===

A fourth &quot;Predator&quot; film, titled &quot;The Predator&quot;, was released in September 2018, featuring Lex Wood&#x27;s Xenomorph-bone spear from the conclusion of &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; on display at Project Stargazer.

<doc id="901446" wikidata="Q158192" url="?curid=901446" title="Ampelopsis">
<text>Ampelopsis, commonly known as peppervine or porcelainberry, is a genus of climbing shrubs, in the grape family Vitaceae. The name is derived from the (&quot;ampelos&quot;), which means &quot;vine&quot;. The genus was named in 1803. It is disjunctly distributed in eastern Asia and eastern North America extending to Mexico. &quot;Ampelopsis&quot; is primarily found in mountainous regions in temperate zones with some species in montane forests at mid-altitudes in subtropical to tropical regions. &quot;Ampelopsis glandulosa&quot; is a popular garden plant and an invasive weed.

==Species==

&quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; currently includes:
# &quot;Ampelopsis aconitifolia&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis acutidentata&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis bodinieri&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis chondisensis&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis cordata&quot; – False grape, raccoon-grape, heart-leaf peppervine or heart-leaf ampelopsis
# &quot;Ampelopsis delavayana&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis denudata&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis glandulosa&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis humulifolia&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis japonica&quot; – Japanese peppervine
# &quot;Ampelopsis mollifolia&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis orientalis&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis tadshikistanica&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis tomentosa&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis vitifolia&quot; 
# &quot;Ampelopsis wangii&quot; 

===Moved to genus &quot;Nekemias&quot;===
*&quot;Ampelopsis arborea&quot; – Peppervine is now &quot;Nekemias arborea&quot;
*&quot;Ampelopsis cantoniensis&quot; 
* &quot;Ampelopsis grossedentata&quot; 

==Ecology==
&quot;Ampelopsis&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including &quot;Bucculatrix quinquenotella&quot; and &quot;Sphecodina abbottii&quot;. Dihydromyricetin, which is an effective ingredient in supplements and other tonics, is extracted from the ampelopsin tree.

==Fossil record==
Fossil seeds from the early Miocene of &quot;Ampelopsis ludwigii&quot; and &quot;Ampelopsis rotundata&quot;, have been found in the Czech part of the Zittau Basin.

The fossil species &quot;Ampelopsis malvaeformis&quot; was rather common in northern Italy in the early and middle Pliocene but seems to disappear at the middle and late Pliocene boundary.

<text>Anacyclus is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae described by Linnaeus in 1753. Annuals or herbaceous perennials, they are cultivated for their fern-like leaves on creeping, radiating stems and daisy-like flowers. They are frost-hardy but may tolerate winter temperatures below if grown in well-drained soil.

&quot;Anacyclus&quot; species are native to stony or sandy slopes in southern and western Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.

The roots of &quot;A. pyrethrum&quot; are known as pellitory in Europe and &quot;akrakara&quot; in India. The root is imported mainly from Mediterranean countries. Because of its powerful irritant action, in Ayurvedic medicine the root is considered a stimulant and is often an ingredient of aphrodisiacs and nervous stimulants used in facial palsy, paralysis, hemiplegia, fibromyalgia, etc.

<text>Pernell Whitaker Sr. (January 2, 1964 – July 14, 2019) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1984 to 2001, and subsequently worked as a boxing trainer. He was a four-weight world champion, having won titles at lightweight, light welterweight, welterweight, and light middleweight; the undisputed lightweight title; and the lineal lightweight and welterweight titles. In 1989, Whitaker was named Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine and the Boxing Writers Association of America. He currently holds the longest unified lightweight championship reign in boxing history at six title defenses. Whitaker is generally regarded as one of the greatest defensive boxers of all-time.

As an amateur, Whitaker won a silver medal in the lightweight division at the 1982 World Championships, followed by gold at the 1983 Pan American Games and 1984 Olympics. After his retirement in 2001, Whitaker returned to the sport as a trainer. In 2002, &quot;The Ring&quot; ranked him tenth in their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Fighters of the Last 80 Years&quot;. In 2006, Whitaker was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, in his first year of eligibility.

==Amateur career==
Whitaker had an extensive amateur boxing career, having started at the age of nine. He had 214 amateur fights, winning 201, 91 of them by knockouts, though he said that he had up to 500 amateur fights. He lost to two-time Olympic Gold medalist Ángel Herrera Vera at the final of the World Championships 1982 but beat him four other times, notably in the final of the Pan American Games 1983 in Caracas. He crowned his amateur career with an Olympic gold medal in 1984, beating Puerto Rican Luis Ortiz to obtain it.

==Professional career==
===Lightweight===
In just his eleventh and twelfth pro bouts, Whitaker defeated former world champion Alfredo Layne on December 20, 1986 and former WBA and lineal Super Featherweight and WBC Light Welterweight title holder Roger Mayweather on March 28, 1987. Whitaker won both bouts before hometown crowds at the Norfolk Scope, less than a mile from where he lived as a child in a Norfolk housing project. Whitaker would fight nine times in the Scope arena during his career.

On March 12, 1988, he challenged José Luis Ramírez for the WBC Lightweight title in Levallois, France. He suffered his first pro defeat when the judges awarded a split decision to Ramirez. This was a highly controversial decision, considered one of the worst ever by many analysts, as they felt that Whitaker easily won.

====Undisputed lightweight champion====
Whitaker trudged on, winning a decision over Greg Haugen for the IBF Lightweight title on February 18, 1989, becoming the first boxer to knock Haugen down by sending him to the mat in the sixth round. He then added the vacant WBC &amp; &quot;The Ring&quot; belts by avenging his loss to Ramirez on August 20.

Now a champion, Whitaker proceeded to dominate boxing&#x27;s middle divisions over the first half of the 1990s. In 1990, he defended his Lightweight title against future champion Freddie Pendleton and Super Featherweight Champion Azumah Nelson of Ghana. On August 11, 1990, he knocked out Juan Nazario in one round to win the WBA and vacant lineal lightweight titles, becoming the first Undisputed Lightweight Champion since Roberto Durán. His highlight of 1991 was a win over Jorge Páez and a fight against European Champion Poli Díaz that ended in another win.

===IBF light welterweight champion===

In 1992, he began his ascent in weight, winning the IBF light welterweight title from Colombian puncher Rafael Pineda on July 18.

===WBC and lineal welterweight champion===

On March 6, 1993, he decisioned Buddy McGirt to become the Lineal and WBC Welterweight Champion.

====Whitaker vs. Chávez====

Whitaker was gaining momentum and boxing experts and fans felt that he needed to win against the pound for pound best boxer in the world: Julio César Chávez. The two met in a welterweight superfight simply named &quot;The Fight&quot; on September 10, 1993 in San Antonio, Texas. In the eyes of many of the spectators, Whitaker outboxed the Mexican legend. While one judge did score the fight in favor of Whitaker (115-113), the other 2 judges saw an even bout (115-115), resulting in a majority draw. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; post-fight edition had &quot;ROBBED!&quot; across the cover and they believed that Whitaker had won no less than 9 of the 12 rounds in the fight. The now-defunct &quot;“Bert Sugar&#x27;s Boxing Illustrated&quot;&quot; magazine had a heading on the cover of its post-fight edition telling readers not to buy the issue if they really believed &quot;The Fight&quot; was a draw.

Whitaker continued on to dominate for the next few years, defending his welterweight title against Santos Cardona on April 9, 1994 and in a rematch against McGirt on October 1, 1994.

===WBA super welterweight champion===

In his next fight on March 4, 1995, Whitaker added Julio César Vásquez&#x27;s WBA super welterweight title to his collection. Early on, Vasquez was the aggressor, and scored a flash knockdown on Whitaker in the 4th round; but Whitaker settled in &amp; used his accuracy and defense to take over and outpoint Vasquez en route to a unanimous decision win. This was a history making fight for Whitaker, as he became only the fourth fighter in history - joining Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard, and Roberto Durán - to have won a legitimate world title in four different weight classes. However, he chose to move back to welterweight.

===Return to welterweight===

Whitaker successfully defended his WBC belt against Scotland&#x27;s Gary Jacobs on August 26, 1995. In January, 1997, Whitaker put his title on the line against Cuban fighter Diosbelys Hurtado. Hurtado gave Whitaker all he could handle and then some. Hurtado had Whitaker down on all the judges scorecards going into the 11th round: Hurtado scored flash knockdowns against Whitaker in rounds 1 and 6, and Whitaker had a point deducted in the 9th round for hitting Hurtado behind the head. But midway in the 11th round, Whitaker landed a left hook that hurt Hurtado; and in a rare display of aggression and power, Whitaker unleashed a barrage of left-handed power shots, pummeling Hurtado into the ropes, knocking Hurtado out and almost completely out of the ring before referee Arthur Mercante Jr. stopped the fight at the 1:52 mark, giving Whitaker the come-from-behind TKO win. The win set up a showdown with undefeated 1992 Olympic gold medalist Oscar De La Hoya.

====Whitaker vs. De La Hoya====

He met Oscar De La Hoya on April 12, 1997, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Whitaker, defending his WBC championship and the mythical status as the best boxer in the world, pound for pound, succeeded in making De La Hoya look bad through his crafty defense, but he was unable to mount a sufficient offense to convince the judges. Whitaker was awarded an official knockdown in the 9th round and, according to CompuBox stats, outlanded De La Hoya in overall punches and connect percentage, using the jab as his primary weapon; but De La Hoya threw and landed almost twice as many power punches and had a slightly higher power punch connect percentage than Whitaker and showed more aggression in the fight, which may have factored into De La Hoya winning by a disputed unanimous decision. At the end of the fight, the judges&#x27; scores were 115-111, 116-110, 116-110. The fight was much closer than what the scorecards showed, and many observers felt that Whitaker won the fight. It was another controversial decision against Whitaker, but it wasn&#x27;t seen as a blatant robbery like the Ramirez or Chavez decisions.

For his part, De La Hoya wasn&#x27;t too pleased with his own performance against Whitaker and had hinted at a possible rematch to prove that he could do better against him. But Bob Arum, De La Hoya&#x27;s promoter at that time, decided against it.
Whitaker&#x27;s next bout was against Russian-born fighter Andrey Pestryayev in a world title elimination fight, where the winner would earn an automatic #1 contender spot for the WBA Welterweight crown, held at the time by Ike Quartey. Whitaker originally won the fight, but the win was nullified &amp; changed to a No Decision after he failed a post-fight drug test. Whitaker was suspended for six months, but the commission lifted the suspension after he agreed to random testing and his title bout with Quartey was to proceed as scheduled, however, the bout was cancelled after Whitaker tested positive for a second time.

====Whitaker vs. Trinidad====

On February 20, 1999, Whitaker suffered his first convincing defeat against the much bigger, much fresher Félix Trinidad, gamely taking the Puerto Rican the distance in an attempt to win Trinidad&#x27;s IBF welterweight title. The fight began with both boxers displaying aggressive styles, which included excessive pushing. In the following rounds, both boxers used their jabs most of the time, with Trinidad gaining an advantage when Whitaker attempted to attack inside, eventually scoring a knockdown in round two. In the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds the fighters exchanged combinations. Later in the fight, both boxers fell to the canvas in what were ruled as &quot;accidental slips.&quot; In the seventh round, Whitaker displayed more offense, trading power punches with Trinidad, but the champion retained control of the fight&#x27;s tempo during the eight, ninth and tenth rounds. In the last round, Whitaker, with a badly swollen right eye, displayed a purely defensive stance, avoiding his opponent throughout the round while Trinidad continued on the offensive until the fight concluded. The judges gave the champion scores of 117–111, 118–109 and 118–109.

His last fight came on April 27, 2001, against journeyman Carlos Bojorquez. Whitaker, the former lightweight, entered the ring at 155 pounds. He broke his clavicle in round four and was forced to retire; at the time of the stoppage Whitaker was trailing in all the judges&#x27; scorecards by 28-29. Following this fight, Whitaker officially announced his retirement. He finished his professional career with an official record of 40-4-1 (17 knockouts).

In 2002, &quot;The Ring&quot; ranked Whitaker as the 10th Greatest Fighter of the Last 80 Years.

On December 7, 2006, Whitaker was inducted in the International Boxing Hall of Fame along with contemporaries Roberto Durán and Ricardo López. They were all elected in their first year of eligibility.

==Boxing style==
A southpaw, Whitaker was known for his outstanding defensive skills and for being a strong counterpuncher. He was not a particularly hard puncher or knockout artist, but applied a consistent offense while being extremely elusive and difficult for his opponents to hit with a solid punch.

==Career as a trainer==
In December 2005 Whitaker became a boxing trainer in his home state of Virginia. While the decline of speed and agility pushed him into retirement, his knowledge of the ring and competitive boxing&#x27;s components led him to seek out up-and-coming boxers to train to fight in the manner in which he did.

His first fighter, Dorin Spivey fought matches in 2006. He later trained young prospect Joel Julio.

Whitaker was also the trainer for heavyweight Calvin Brock who, as recently as November 2006, fought for the IBF and IBO titles against Wladimir Klitschko, wherein Brock was knocked out in the 7th round.

Whitaker also trained former IBF world champion Paul Spadafora between 2009 and 2010 for 3 fights in which Spadafora won all three.

In 2010, Whitaker was inducted into the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, honoring those who have contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia.

Whitaker also became the head trainer of former undisputed welterweight champion Zab Judah, who defeated Kaizer Mabuza in March 2011 to win the vacant IBF light welterweight title.

==Personal life==
Pernell Whitaker was born in Norfolk, Virginia on January 2, 1964, the son of Raymond Whitaker Sr. and his wife, Novella. He had two brothers and four sisters.

Pernell married Rovanda Anthony on December 21, 1985 in the boxing ring at the Virginia Beach Pavilion Convention Center. The couple later divorced. They had four children together. Pernell also had a daughter from a prior relationship.

Pernell graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in 1982 and later received an honorary bachelor&#x27;s degree from Norfolk State University. His humble beginnings started in Youngs Park Housing Community where he was inspired to start his boxing career. Outside of the ring, Sweet Pea served his community and the youth in everything that he did. He sponsored many events at Norfolk State University and spent countless hours training youth at boxing camps and gyms. He also remained active in Norfolk and spoke at city council meetings on behalf of the residents in support of community improvements.

Pernell had personal struggles and in June 2002 was convicted of cocaine possession after a judge found he violated the terms of a previous sentence by overdosing on cocaine in March. In February 2014, Pernell made national headlines after he evicted his mother, Novella Whitaker, out of the house he purchased for her shortly after he turned pro. Apparently, back taxes were owed on the house and Pernell said that neither his mother nor his siblings, who also stayed in the house, were doing anything to help keep the house afloat financially. Pernell&#x27;s lawyers said that he is not making the same kind of money as a trainer that he was as a boxer, and needed to sell off the home to satisfy the tax debt owed in order to prevent the property from being seized and put into foreclosure. Outside of the Virginia courtroom where the eviction proceedings took place, he called the ruling in his favor &quot;a beautiful moment.&quot;

== Death ==
At about 10 p.m. on July 14, 2019, Whitaker was crossing the street in Virginia Beach, at the intersection of Northampton Boulevard and Baker Road, when he was struck and killed by a vehicle. He was 55. An autopsy stated that the cause of Whitaker&#x27;s death was &quot;multiple blunt force trauma.&quot;

<doc id="901459" wikidata="Q1363919" url="?curid=901459" title="Second-countable space">
<text>In topology, a second-countable space, also called a completely separable space, is a topological space whose topology has a countable base. More explicitly, a topological space formula_1 is second-countable if there exists some countable collection formula_2 of open subsets of formula_1 such that any open subset of formula_1 can be written as a union of elements of some subfamily of formula_5. A second-countable space is said to satisfy the second axiom of countability. Like other countability axioms, the property of being second-countable restricts the number of open sets that a space can have. 

Many &quot;well-behaved&quot; spaces in mathematics are second-countable. For example, Euclidean space (R&quot;n&quot;) with its usual topology is second-countable. Although the usual base of open balls is uncountable, one can restrict to the collection of all open balls with rational radii and whose centers have rational coordinates. This restricted set is countable and still forms a basis.

==Properties==

Second-countability is a stronger notion than first-countability. A space is first-countable if each point has a countable local base. Given a base for a topology and a point &quot;x&quot;, the set of all basis sets containing &quot;x&quot; forms a local base at &quot;x&quot;. Thus, if one has a countable base for a topology then one has a countable local base at every point, and hence every second-countable space is also a first-countable space. However any uncountable discrete space is first-countable but not second-countable.

Second-countability implies certain other topological properties. Specifically, every second-countable space is separable (has a countable dense subset) and Lindelöf (every open cover has a countable subcover). The reverse implications do not hold. For example, the lower limit topology on the real line is first-countable, separable, and Lindelöf, but not second-countable. For metric spaces, however, the properties of being second-countable, separable, and Lindelöf are all equivalent. Therefore, the lower limit topology on the real line is not metrizable.

In second-countable spaces—as in metric spaces—compactness, sequential compactness, and countable compactness are all equivalent properties.

Urysohn&#x27;s metrization theorem states that every second-countable, Hausdorff regular space is metrizable. It follows that every such space is completely normal as well as paracompact. Second-countability is therefore a rather restrictive property on a topological space, requiring only a separation axiom to imply metrizability.

===Other properties===

*A continuous, open image of a second-countable space is second-countable.
*Every subspace of a second-countable space is second-countable.
*Quotients of second-countable spaces need not be second-countable; however, &quot;open&quot; quotients always are.
*Any countable product of a second-countable space is second-countable, although uncountable products need not be.
*The topology of a second-countable T1 space has cardinality less than or equal to &quot;c&quot; (the cardinality of the continuum).
*Any base for a second-countable space has a countable subfamily which is still a base.
*Every collection of disjoint open sets in a second-countable space is countable.

== Examples ==
* Consider the disjoint countable union formula_6. Define an equivalence relation and a quotient topology by identifying the left ends of the intervals - that is, identify 0 ~ 2 ~ 4 ~ … ~ 2k and so on. &quot;X&quot; is second-countable, as a countable union of second-countable spaces. However, &quot;X&quot;/~ is not first-countable at the coset of the identified points and hence also not second-countable.
* The above space is not homeomorphic to the same set of equivalence classes endowed with the obvious metric: i.e. regular Euclidean distance for two points in the same interval, and the sum of the distances to the left hand point for points not in the same interval -- yielding a strictly coarser topology than the above space. It is a separable metric space (consider the set of rational points), and hence is second-countable.
* The long line is not second-countable, but is first-countable.

<doc id="901464" wikidata="Q1624891" url="?curid=901464" title="Holly Near">
<text>Holly Near (born June 6, 1949) is an American singer-songwriter, actress, teacher, and activist.

==Family==
Holly Near was born in Ukiah, California, United States, and was 
raised on a ranch in Potter Valley, California. 

She has two sisters, Timothy Near and Laurel Near, and a brother, Fred. One of her first cousins is actor Kevin Bacon (their mothers are sisters).

==Early years==
She was eight years old when she first performed publicly, and she auditioned for Columbia Records when she was ten. She sang in all the high school musicals, talent shows and often was invited to sing at gatherings of local service groups, such as the Soroptimist Club, Lions Club, and Garden Club. Her senior year she played Eliza Doolittle in the Ukiah High School production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. In the summer Near attended performing arts camps such as Perry-Mansfield in Colorado and Ramblerny Performing Arts where she studied with jazz musicians Phil Woods and his wife, Chan Parker (Parker was married to Woods but retained the name Parker from her earlier, common law marriage to Charlie Parker), and modern dancer/choreographer Joyce Trisler. 

After starting high school in 1963, Near began singing with three boys who called themselves the Freedom Singers, a folk group modeled after The Kingston Trio. When Near joined, they began to sound more like The Weavers, with three male voices and one female. Near learned later of the original Freedom Singers who sang as part of the Civil Rights Movement. Unbeknownst to her, Near would soon meet one of the founding members of that group, Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon, an artist who would be a great influence for the next 40-plus years. She would also meet and work with the female singer in The Weavers, Ronnie Gilbert. 

After high school, Near enrolled in the Theatre Arts program at UCLA; her freshman year she got the lead in the UCLA production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; playing soprano Sarah Brown. Because Near was trained in a lower range she got nodules on her vocal cords and had to leave the show. She entered in to a long period of silence until her voice healed. After one year, she left UCLA and began to work in film and television as well as with anti-war groups such as Another Mother for Peace.

==Career==

Near&#x27;s professional career began in 1969 with a part on the television show &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, which was followed by appearances in other shows, such as &quot;Room 222,&quot; &quot;All in the Family,&quot; and &quot;The Partridge Family.&quot; She also appeared in &quot;Angel, Angel, Down We Go&quot;, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, and &quot;Minnie and Moskowitz&quot;. Much later, she had a prominent role in the 1991 film &quot;Dogfight&quot;.

She was briefly a member of the musical comedy troupe First National Nothing and appeared on the troupe&#x27;s only album &quot;If You Sit Real Still and Hold My Hand, You Will Hear Absolutely Nothing&quot;, released in 1970 on Columbia Records.

In 1970, Near was a cast member of the Broadway musical &quot;Hair&quot;. Following the Kent State shootings in May of that year, the entire cast staged a silent vigil in protest. The song &quot;It Could Have Been Me&quot; (released on &quot;A Live Album,&quot; 1974) was her response to the shootings. In 1971, she joined the FTA (Free The Army) Tour, an anti-Vietnam War road show of music, comedy, and plays that performed for soldiers, many of whom were resisting war and racism from within the military. The tour was organized by antiwar activist Fred Gardner and actors Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland. Near was only 21 and the youngest member of the troupe. 

In 1972, Near founded an independent record label called Redwood Records to produce and promote music by &quot;politically conscious artists from around the world&quot;. She was one of the first women to found an independent record company. Near&#x27;s record company went out of business in the mid-1990s due to financial difficulties.

During her long career in folk and protest music, Near has worked with a wide array of musicians, including Ronnie Gilbert, Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Mercedes Sosa, Bernice Johnson Reagon, Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, Meg (Shambhavi) Christian, Cris Williamson, Linda Tillery, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, Harry Belafonte, and many others, as well as the Chilean exile group Inti-Illimani.

Near wrote an autobiography in the early 1990s titled &quot;Fire in the Rain, Singer in the Storm&quot;. Later, with her sister Timothy, Near co-wrote a one-woman show based on the stories in the book. The show was presented at The San Jose Rep and in Los Angeles at The Mark Taper Forum, as well as productions in San Francisco and off Broadway in NYC. In April 2004, Near performed at the March for Women&#x27;s Lives in Washington, DC where she sang &quot;We Are Gentle Angry People&quot; and &quot;Fired Up&quot; a capella. 
As of 2019, she has a discography of 29 albums. She is still active as a performer and composer, and she has begun issuing CDs available through her website that include tracks from her out-of-print albums. Her song &quot;Singing For Our Lives&quot; appears in &quot;Singing the Living Tradition&quot;, the official hymnal of the Unitarian Universalist Association, under the title &quot;We Are A Gentle, Angry People&quot; (Hymn #170). The hymn was performed by Quaker Friends in an episode of the TV series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;. In 2015, the same song, credited as &quot;Singing for Our Lives&quot; appeared in the Australian independent film &quot;The Lives We Lead&quot;, alongside its theme song &quot;I Am Willing&quot;, another protest song written by Near.

Near hosted many of the tributes to both Pete Seeger and Ronnie Gilbert, two members of the seminal folk group The Weavers.

Near has been an honored guest at several of the GALA Choruses Festivals, a conference of GLBTQ choirs and choruses. She also appears as a soloist with several of the choruses and many of her songs have been arranged for choral singing. 

In 2018, Near released a new recording titled &quot;2018&quot;, reflecting on issues including the environment, aging, domestic violence and the unresolved storm damage in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria. In October 2018, a documentary film titled &quot;Holly Near: Singing for Our Lives&quot; made by director Jim Brown premiered at the Mill Valley Film Festival, detailing Near&#x27;s life and work.

==Personal life==

As a result of her travels in the Pacific with the FTA show, Near became a feminist, linking international feminism and anti-war activism. In 1976, Near came out as a lesbian and began a three-year relationship with musician Meg Christian. She added LGBTQ issues to her international peace work as she continued to present social change music around the world and at home. Although Near was one of the most visible artists in the lesbian community, she was also becoming aware that &quot;monogamous&quot; defined her sexuality more than any other title. 

Near has been in a relationship with a man since 1994. However, she does not identify as bisexual. When asked why in a 2010 interview by JD Doyle for &quot;Queer Music Heritage&quot;, she replied,

Near is dedicated to the rights of LGBT communities and continues to work to create a cultural forum for diversity. She writes, &quot;For many, sexual identity and/or gender identity is the primary door through which they walk. It is what politicized them. It is what feeds their emotional and spiritual perspectives. I totally honor this. Even though sexual preference is maybe 5th or 10th on my personal list of priorities now, I will always work for all of us to have self-determination over our bodies, our identities, our relationship choices.&quot; 

In 2014, Near was diagnosed with breast cancer. With early detection, she had successful surgery and radiation.

==Awards and honors==
Near has been recognized many times for her work for social change, including honors from the ACLU, the National Lawyers Guild, the National Organization for Women, NARAS, &quot;Ms. Magazine&quot; (Woman of the Year), and the Legends of Women&#x27;s Music Award. 

In 1989, Near received a Doctorate of Humane Letters from World College West in California.

Near was named among the &quot;1000 Women for the Nobel Peace Prize&quot;.

Near was named as an Honoree for National Women&#x27;s History Month for 2015.

<doc id="901465" wikidata="Q313374" url="?curid=901465" title="Emmanuel Chabrier">
<text>Alexis-Emmanuel Chabrier (; 18 January 184113 September 1894) was a French Romantic composer and pianist. His bourgeois family did not approve of a musical career for him, and he studied law in Paris and then worked as a civil servant until the age of thirty-nine while immersing himself in the modernist artistic life of the French capital and composing in his spare time. From 1880 until his final illness he was a full-time composer.

Although known primarily for two of his orchestral works, &quot;España&quot; and &quot;Joyeuse marche&quot;, Chabrier left a corpus of operas (including &quot;L&#x27;étoile&quot;), songs, and piano music, but no symphonies, concertos, quartets, sonatas, or religious or liturgical music. His lack of academic training left him free to create his own musical language, unaffected by established rules, and he was regarded by many later composers as an important innovator and a catalyst who paved the way for French modernism. He was admired by, and influenced, composers as diverse as Debussy, Ravel, Richard Strauss, Satie, Stravinsky, and the group of composers known as Les Six. Writing at a time when French musicians were generally proponents or opponents of the music of Wagner, Chabrier steered a middle course, sometimes incorporating Wagnerian traits into his music and at other times avoiding them.

Chabrier was associated with some of the leading writers and painters of his time. Among his closest friends was the painter Édouard Manet, and Chabrier collected Impressionist paintings long before they became fashionable. A number of such paintings from his personal collection by artists known to him are now housed in some of the world&#x27;s leading art museums. He penned a large number of letters to friends and colleagues which offer an insight into his musical opinions and character.

Chabrier died in Paris at the age of fifty-three from a neurological disease, probably caused by syphilis.

==Life==
===Early years===
Chabrier was born in Ambert, (Puy-de-Dôme), a town in the Auvergne region of central France. He was the only son of a lawyer, Jean Chabrier, and his wife, Marie-Anne-Evelina, &quot;née&quot; Durosay or Durozay. The Chabriers were of old Auvergne stock, originally of peasant origin (the surname comes from &quot;chevrier&quot; – goat-herd), but in recent generations merchants and lawyers had predominated in the family. A key member of the household was the boy&#x27;s nanny Anne Delayre (whom he called &quot;Nanine&quot; and &quot;Nanon&quot;), who remained close to him throughout her life.

Chabrier began taking music lessons at the age of six; his early teachers were from cosmopolitan backgrounds: at Ambert he studied with a Carlist Spanish refugee called Saporta, and after the family moved to Clermont-Ferrand in 1852 he studied at the Lycée imperial with a Polish musician, Alexander Tarnovsky . The earliest of Chabrier&#x27;s compositions to survive in manuscript are piano works from 1849. A piano piece, &quot;Le Scalp!!!&quot; (1856) was later modified into the &quot;Marche des Cipayes&quot; (1863). The first piece to which the composer gave an opus number was a waltz for piano, &quot;Julia&quot;, op. 1, 1857.

Tarnovsky advised Chabrier&#x27;s parents that their son was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but Jean Chabrier was determined that his son should follow him into the legal profession. He moved the family to Paris in 1856, so that Chabrier could enrol at the Lycée Saint-Louis. From there Chabrier went on to law school, but did not neglect music, continuing his studies in composition, violin and piano. After graduating from the law school in 1861 he joined the French civil service at the Ministry of the Interior, where he worked for nineteen years.

===Paris: dual harness ===
Chabrier was well regarded at the ministry, but his passion was music, to which he devoted his free time. He continued his studies, with teachers including Edouard Wolff (de) (piano), Richard Hammer (violin), Théophile Semet (fr) and Aristide Hignard (both composition). In a study of the composer published in 1935 Jacques-Gabriel Prod&#x27;homme commented that it would be wrong to class Chabrier as merely an amateur in this period: &quot;For, while in quest of the technique of his art, he displayed a curiosity in the painting and literature of the &#x27;modernists&#x27; of his day that, among musicians, had few parallels.&quot;

From 1862 Chabrier was among the circle of the Parnassians in Paris. Among his friends were Auguste Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam and Paul Verlaine; with the latter he planned a comic opera in the fashionable style of Offenbach, &quot;Vaucochard et fils Ier&quot;. He did not complete it, but four fragments (dating from about 1864 or 1865) have survived. His full-time official post severely restricted Chabrier&#x27;s ability to compose large-scale works. He began an opera on a Hungarian historical theme entitled &quot;Jean Hunyade&quot;, to a libretto by Henry Fouquier, but abandoned it, after completing four numbers, in 1867. In December 1872 he scored a success at a private theatre club, the Cercle de l&#x27;union artistique with a three-act opérette bouffe &quot;Le Service obligatoire&quot; written in collaboration with two other composers, and which according to Victorin de Joncières was acclaimed by the audience as undoubted proof of Chabrier&#x27;s talent. Another attempt at operatic comedy, &quot;Fisch-Ton-Kan&quot;, with Verlaine and Lucien Viotti, was performed in March 1875 at the same club with Chabrier at the piano; five fragments survive. He did not set any poems by Villiers de L&#x27;Isle Adam or Verlaine, although the latter wrote a sonnet &quot;À Emmanuel Chabrier&quot; (published in &quot;Amour&quot;, 1888) as a remembrance of their friendship.
There are several descriptions of Chabrier&#x27;s piano-playing at around this time; many years later the composer Vincent d&#x27;Indy wrote, &quot;Though his arms were too short, his fingers too thick and his whole manner somewhat clumsy, he managed to achieve a degree of finesse and a command of expression that very few pianists – with the exception of Liszt and Rubinstein – have surpassed.&quot; The composer and critic Alfred Bruneau said of Chabrier, &quot;he played the piano as no one has ever played it before, or ever will…&quot; The wife of the painter Renoir, a friend of the composer, wrote: 
Both Chabrier&#x27;s parents died within the space of eight days in 1869. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) and Commune, he continued in his official post as the ministry moved from Tours to Bordeaux then to Versailles. In 1873 he married Marie Alice Dejean, the granddaughter of Louis Dejean, who had gained his fortune as founder and manager of the Cirque d&#x27;été and the Cirque Napoléon. Alice and Chabrier had three sons, one of whom died at birth. Chabrier&#x27;s friends in Paris included the composers Gabriel Fauré, Ernest Chausson, and Vincent d&#x27;Indy; painters including Henri Fantin-Latour, Edgar Degas and Édouard Manet, whose Thursday soirées Chabrier attended; and writers such as Émile Zola, Alphonse Daudet, Jean Moréas, Jean Richepin and Stéphane Mallarmé.

During the 1870s Chabrier began several stage works. The first to be completed was a three-act opéra-bouffe &quot;L&#x27;étoile&quot; (The Star), commissioned by the Bouffes-Parisiens, the spiritual home of Offenbach. He secured the commission through his many contacts in the world of arts and letters: he had met the librettists, Albert Vanloo and Eugène Leterrier through the painter Alphonse Hirsch, whom he had got to know as a member of Manet&#x27;s set. The opera was modestly successful, running for 48 performances in 1877, but was not revived in his lifetime. Nonetheless, it brought him to the attention of the press and attracted the publishing firm Enoch &amp; Costallat, who published his works during the rest of his life. Above all, as a result of &quot; L&#x27;étoile&quot; he ceased to be regarded as a talented amateur. The same year Saint-Saens gave the first public performance of his 1865 Impromptu, his first piano piece of real importance with his personal stamp of originality.

===Full-time composer===

Like many progressively-minded French composers of the time, Chabrier was greatly interested in the music of Wagner. As a young man he had copied out the full score of &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; to gain an insight into the composer&#x27;s creative process. On a trip to Munich with Henri Duparc and others in March 1880, Chabrier first saw Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;; he wrote to the personnel director at the ministry saying he had to go to Bordeaux on private matters, but in confidence confessed that for ten years he had wanted to see and hear Wagner&#x27;s opera, and promised that he would back at his desk the following Wednesday. D&#x27;Indy, who was among the group, recorded that Chabrier was moved to tears at hearing the music, saying of the prelude, &quot;I have waited ten years of my life to hear that A in the cellos&quot;.

This event led Chabrier to conclude that he must single-mindedly pursue his vocation as a composer, and after several periods of absence he left the Ministry of the Interior in late 1880. In a 2001 study, Steven Huebner writes that there may have been additional factors in Chabrier&#x27;s decision: &quot;the growing momentum of his musical career … his high hopes for the &quot;Gwendoline&quot; project, and the first signs of a nervous disorder, probably the result of a syphilitic condition, that would claim his life 14 years later.&quot;

The project to which Huebner refers was the operatic tragedy &quot;Gwendoline&quot;, on which Chabrier had begun working in 1879. The librettist was Catulle Mendès, described by the pianist and scholar Graham Johnson as &quot;a relentlessly ambitious member of the literary establishment&quot;. Mendès wrote texts that were set by at least seven French composers, including Fauré, Massenet, Debussy and Messager; none of his operatic works were successful, and Johnson rates the libretto for &quot;Gwendoline&quot; as &quot;catastrophic&quot;. Chabrier worked on the piece until 1885.

The conductor Charles Lamoureux appointed Chabrier as his chorus master and répétiteur, and included his music in the Lamoureux Orchestra&#x27;s concerts. In 1881 Chabrier&#x27;s piano cycle &quot;Pièces pittoresques&quot; was premiered. César Franck commented, &quot;We have just heard something extraordinary: this music links our time with that of Couperin and Rameau&quot;. Chabrier travelled to London (1882) and Brussels (1883) to hear Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, and in 1882 Chabrier and his wife visited Spain, which resulted in his most famous work, &quot;España&quot; (1883), a mixture of popular airs he had heard and his own original themes. It was premiered under its dedicatee, Lamoureux, in November 1883. It met with what Poulenc calls &quot;immediate and rapturous success&quot;, made Chabrier&#x27;s reputation, and by public demand received multiple performances over the next months. Admirers included de Falla, who stated that he did not think any Spanish composer had succeeded in achieving so genuine a version of the jota as in the piece,

The Paris Opéra declined to present &quot;Gwendoline&quot;, which was premiered at La Monnaie in Brussels under Henry Verdhurdt in 1886. It was well received, but closed after two performances because the impresario went bankrupt. William Mann wrote of the music that &quot;in full, rapturous cognizance of mature Wagner&quot;, Chabrier composed &quot;great music ...such as the long solo and choral ensemble, &#x27;Soyez unis&#x27;, and all the love duet music, and there is more Frenchman than Wagner in them, above all in the final Liebestod&quot;.

While striving for a staging of his opera Chabrier was also working on some of his mature songs – Sommation irrespectueuse, Tes yeux bleus, Chanson pour Jeanne, Lied, as well as a lyric scene for mezzo, women&#x27;s chorus and orchestra &quot;La Sulamite&quot; and the piano version of the Joyeuse Marche. He then found a new lyric project to tackle – &quot;Le roi malgré lui&quot; (The King in Spite of Himself) – and completed the score in six months. It was premiered at the Opéra-Comique in Paris, and a favourable reception seemed to promise a successful run, but the theatre burned down after the third performance. Through Chabrier&#x27;s friendship with the Belgian tenor Ernest van Dyck and subsequently the conductor Felix Mottl, directors of opera houses in Leipzig and Munich expressed interest in both works and Chabrier made several happy trips to Germany as a result; his works were given in seven German cities. In July 1888 he was appointed as a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur.

Chabrier left a rich and exuberant body of correspondence; Myers sees the &quot;letter-writer&#x27;s gift of spontaneous self-expression, with no undertones of insincerity or of writing for effect&quot;. He expressed himself in &quot;Rabelaisian language&quot; and &quot;laced with a profusion of racy slang&quot;. In 1994 the musical scholar Roger Delage, with Frans Durif and Thierry Bodin, produced a 1,300 page edition of the composer&#x27;s correspondence, containing 1,149 letters, ranging from those to his family and Nanine, exchanges with contemporary friends in the musical world (sometimes with musical quotations), negotiations with publishers, and one a commiseration with his son André on the death of his pet bird (with gentle reproach for having over-fed the creature).

===Decline and final years===

In his final years, Chabrier was troubled by financial problems caused by the collapse of his bankers, failing health brought on by the terminal stage of syphilis, and depression about the neglect of his stage works in France. The death of his beloved &quot;Nanine&quot; in January 1891 greatly affected him. In 1892, he wrote to his friend Charles Lecocq, &quot;Never has an artist more loved, more tried to honour music than me, none has suffered more from it; and I will go on suffering from it for ever&quot;. He became obsessed with the composition of his final opera &quot;Briséïs&quot;, which was inspired by a tragedy of Goethe and has melodic echoes of Wagner; he completed only one act. The Paris première of &quot;Gwendoline&quot;, finally took place in December 1893. The composer, ailing physically and mentally, sitting in a stage box with his family, enjoyed the music but did not realise he had written it, nor did he understand that the applause was for him.

Chabrier succumbed to general paresis in the last year of his life and died in Paris at the age of 53. Although he had asked to be buried near the tomb of Manet in the Cimetière de Passy, a plot was not available and he was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse. His widow and children also suffered from probable infection: she had severe eye problems, becoming almost blind, and, after Chabrier&#x27;s death, became paraplegic, dying aged 51; the eldest son, Marcel, died at 35 having also displayed related symptoms, and the second son, Charles, died after only five weeks, the youngest, André, also became paraplegic and died also aged 35.

==Works==

Vincent d&#x27;Indy called Chabrier &quot;that great primitive ... a very great artist&quot;. In &quot;The Oxford Companion to Music&quot; (2011), Denis Arnold and Roger Nichols write that Chabrier&#x27;s lack of a formal musical education at one of the major conservatoires allowed him the freedom to &quot;bypass the normal paths of French music of the 1860s, and to explore a new harmonic idiom and especially a novel way of writing for the piano&quot;. Chabrier&#x27;s musical language introduced several striking features. Among them, Huebner singles out a liking for melodies of wide range with large leaps from one note to the next; frequent doubling of melodies by the bass or in octaves; a mixture of orthodox and unorthodox chromatic decoration; and frequent use of cross-rhythms and syncopation. Chabrier is reported to have said, &quot;My music rings with the stamp of my Auvergnat clogs&quot;, and the pianist and scholar Roy Howat points to examples of this in fast stamping rhythms in the &quot;Bourrée fantasque&quot;, the &quot;Joyeuse marche&quot; and several of the &quot;Pièces pittoresques&quot;.

===Orchestral===

Duparc and Ravel both had reservations about Chabrier&#x27;s skills as an orchestrator in his early works; Poulenc disagreed, feeling that Chabrier was a master of orchestration from an early stage. Poulenc wrote, &quot;The fact that Chabrier always composed at the piano – as did Debussy and Stravinsky – did not prevent him from finding a rare orchestral colour: a unique achievement at a time when Franck, d&#x27;Indy and Saint-Saëns hardly ever emerged from well-worn paths&quot;.

The work for which Chabrier is best known is his rhapsody &quot;España&quot;, which became popular internationally (except in Spain, where it was not a success). The rhythmic verve of &quot;España&quot; is found also in the &quot;Joyeuse marche&quot;, which goes further in orchestral invention. Not all of Chabrier&#x27;s orchestral pieces are in this exuberant vein: his &quot;Lamento&quot; (1874), unpublished in his lifetime, is an unusually poignant work.

A few of Chabrier&#x27;s piano works were later orchestrated. The composer arranged the four movements of the &quot;Suite pastorale&quot; from the ten &quot;Pièces pittoresques&quot;. Chabrier began an orchestration of &quot;Bourrée fantasque&quot; in 1891 (completed in 1994 by Robin Holloway) but his friend and champion Felix Mottl orchestrated it in 1898, proving popular; he did the same for &quot; Trois valses romantiques&quot; in 1900, and in 1917–18 Ravel arranged the &quot;Menuet pompeux&quot; from the &quot;Pièces pittoresques&quot;.

===Stage works===

Chabrier&#x27;s ebullient orchestral works have always been popular with the public and critics, but there is less agreement about his serious stage works, and in particular the influence of the music of Wagner. For some critics, the Wagnerian ethos and French sensibilities are simply incompatible, and consequently much of the music of &quot;Gwendoline&quot; and &quot;Briséïs&quot; has been denigrated; others have argued that Chabrier so transformed his influences that the music does not sound especially Wagnerian. Huebner puts the truth somewhere between the two, noting Wagner&#x27;s influence in the similarities between &quot;Gwendoline&quot; and &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; and &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;, but noting Chabrier&#x27;s &quot;un-Wagnerian concision&quot;, the retention of conventional self-contained numbers, and Chabrier&#x27;s recognisable melodic and instrumental characteristics. He suggests that preoccupation with supposed derivativeness has deprived the repertory of works such as &quot;Gwendoline&quot; &quot;with substantial musical and dramatic interest&quot;.
&quot;L&#x27;etoile&quot;, an opéra bouffe in three acts (1877) was Chabrier&#x27;s first modestly successful opera, and is the most often revived. Although the plot was described by a reviewer in 2016 as &quot;wilfully unfathomable and illogical&quot;, the libretto was professional and polished, in contrast with other libretti set by Chabrier. The critic Elizabeth Forbes calls the score, &quot;light as thistle-down … in the best tradition of Offenbachian opéra bouffe, with each singer perfectly characterized in his or her music&quot;.

&quot;Une éducation manquée&quot; (An Incomplete Education), a one-act opérette about a young couple seeking essential advice on their wedding night, received a single private performance in 1879, and was not performed in public until 1913. Forbes wrote in 1992, &quot;Why this charming little work had to wait so many years for a public performance remains a total mystery. The subject is treated with the greatest delicacy… Musically, the piece is quite enchanting, in particular the central duet for the two high voices, while the bass has a fine comic number.&quot;

Chabrier&#x27;s only completed serious opera was &quot;Gwendoline&quot;, composed between 1879 and 1885 and premiered in 1886. Mendès&#x27;s libretto was a liability: Henri Büsser commented that it lacked the verve and movement the composer needed; Poulenc was dismissive of &quot;Mendès&#x27; ineptitudes … balderdash&quot;; and another critic wrote in 1996, &quot;Mendes&#x27;s dramaturgy is not only painfully thin but takes a long time to get under way&quot;. Arnold and Nichols comment that the work is considerably less Wagnerian than has often been supposed: &quot;certainly the modal, asymmetrical, loosely articulated theme of the overture is individual to a degree&quot;. The music satisfied neither the pro- nor anti-Wagner lobby: Chabrier commented, &quot;The &quot;wagnérien&quot; calls me a reactionary and the bourgeois considers me a &quot;wagnérien&quot;&quot;. The opera has been revived from time to time, but has not gained a regular place in the international repertory.

Arnold and Nichols write that some of Chabrier&#x27;s best music went into his comic opera &quot;Le Roi malgré lui&quot; (Opéra-Comique, 1887), &quot;but unfortunately the work is saddled with one of the most complex and incomprehensible librettos of all time&quot;. Ravel so loved the piece that he said he would rather have written it than Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle; reviewing a rare revival in 2003 the critic Edward Greenfield commented that despite the plot, the music made one see Ravel&#x27;s point. After the same production, the critic Rupert Christiansen wrote, &quot;&quot;Le Roi malgre lui&quot; doesn&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s a Carry On farce by Offenbach or a nationalist epic by Wagner. Perhaps &quot;grand operetta&quot; is the best way of describing this problem piece&quot;.

Chabrier&#x27;s last opera was &quot;Briséïs&quot;, to another libretto by Mendès. Mortally ill, Chabrier could only complete the first of the projected three acts, and the remaining sketches were too inconclusive for any of his colleagues to attempt a completion. It was to have been a romantic tragedy, set in Corinth during time of the Roman Empire. The existing act is rarely staged, but a recording of a concert performance in 1994 has been issued on CD. Poulenc was unimpressed by the libretto, but Messager thought the music of &quot;Briséïs&quot; showed what heights Chabrier might have reached had he lived.

===Piano===
Although the piano works are not the best known part of Chabrier&#x27;s oeuvre, Poulenc put the cycle &quot; Pièces pittoresques&quot; on a par with Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Preludes&quot; in its importance for French music. In his introduction to a 1995 edition of the piano works, Howat writes that it was Chabrier, more than any other composer, who restored to French music &quot;the essential French traits of clarity, emotional vitality, wit and tenderness&quot; when other French composers were under the influence of Wagner or of dry academicism.

Chabrier&#x27;s early works were for piano solo, and in addition to a small corpus of about twenty completed mature works, some juvenilia have survived. Most of the piano pieces were published in the composer&#x27;s lifetime, but five completed works and the unfinished &quot;Capriccio&quot; (1883) were issued posthumously.

Some of the mature works are better known in their later orchestral versions, including the &quot;Joyeuse marche&quot; and the four numbers from the &quot;Pièces pittoresques&quot; that make up the &quot;Suite pastorale&quot;. The trip to Spain that inspired &quot;España&quot; also gave Chabrier the material for a &quot;Habanera&quot; (1885) which became one of his most popular piano works.

Among Chabrier&#x27;s works for four hands is &quot;Souvenirs de Munich&quot;. Although Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; had made a deep impression on him, his irreverent nature led him to arrange five themes from the opera into a comic quadrille. Poulenc called it &quot;irresistibly funny … Tristan&#x27;s principal themes with false noses and added beards.&quot;

Vincent d&#x27;Indy wrote, after studying the &quot;Trois valses romantiques&quot; and playing them with the composer: &quot;I thus worked on these three waltzes &quot;con amore&quot;, doing my best to perform all the indications marked with the greatest precision... and there are many of them! In rehearsal, which was at Pleyel&#x27;s, Chabrier stopped me dead in the midst of the first waltz, and, addressing me a look that was both amazed and arch, said: &quot;But my dear boy it&#x27;s not that at all!...&quot; And, as not quite knowing how to react, I asked for explanations, he retorted: &quot;You play that as if it were music by a Member of the Institute!...&quot; And then I had a marvellous lesson in playing &quot;alla Chabrier&quot;; contrary accents, pianissimi to the point of extinction, sudden fire-crackers bursting out in the middle of the most exquisite softness, and also indispensable gesturing, giving over the body, too, to the intention of the music&quot;.

Chabrier was an important influence on Debussy, as he was later on Ravel and Poulenc; Howat has written that Chabrier&#x27;s piano music such as &quot;Sous-bois&quot; and &quot;Mauresque&quot; in the &quot;Pièces pittoresques&quot; explored new sound-worlds of which Debussy made effective use 30 years later.

===Songs===
There are forty-three published songs by Chabrier. He began writing songs – &quot;mélodies&quot; – when he was about twenty-one; the first nine were written between 1862 and 1866. Johnson comments that it is strange that in all his songs Chabrier never set anything by his friend Verlaine, but among the well-known poets whose verse Chabrier set in the early songs were Théodore de Banville (&quot;Lied&quot;) and Alfred de Musset (&quot;Adieux à Suzon&quot;).

In 1888 Chabrier made sixteen arrangements of French folk songs for an anthology called &quot;Le plus jolies chansons du pays de France&quot;. He was among the first important composers to work with folk songs, a pioneer for Ravel, Bartók, Britten and others. Johnson writes that Chabrier&#x27;s touch in these pieces is &quot;deceptively light and restrained&quot;, but that the piano writing continually adds enormously to the charm of the music. A later group of songs (1889) with a linking theme is what Chabrier called his &quot;poultry farm&quot;, to lyrics by Edmond Rostand and Rosemonde Gérard, with subjects including fat turkeys, little ducklings, pink pigs and chirping cicadas.

Most of the songs are for solo voice and piano, but there is one duet (the comic &quot;Duo de l&#x27;ouvresse de l&#x27;Opéra-Comique&quot;, 1888) and in Chabrier&#x27;s setting of Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;invitation au voyage&quot; (1870), the voice and piano are joined by a solo bassoon. Chabrier&#x27;s last song, &quot;Ode à la Musique&quot;, to words by Rostand, is for solo soprano, piano and female choir.

==Influence==
The musicologist David Charlton evaluated his influence by saying &quot;While the musical language of Reyer, Massenet and Saint-Saens presented syntheses of current practice, that of Emmanuel Chabrier (1841–1894) was a catalyst: his work became the cradle of French modernism&quot;.

Debussy, Ravel and Poulenc all acknowledged Chabrier&#x27;s influence on their music. Debussy wrote in 1893 &quot;Chabrier, Moussorgsky, Palestrina, voilà ce que j&#x27;aime&quot; – they are what I love, and said that he could not have written &quot;La Damoiselle élue&quot; without Chabrier&#x27;s &quot;La sulamite&quot; as a model. Huebner remarks on echoes of Chabrier in Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La soirée dans Grenade&quot; in &quot;Estampes&quot;, and the piano prelude &quot;Général Lavine – excentric&quot;. The influence on Ravel is still more marked. In a 1975 study of the two composers, Delage wrote, &quot;In truth there are few works by Ravel which do not to some extent echo one or another work of Chabrier and of which the harmonic procedures are not derived from him&quot;. Ravel paid explicit homage to Chabrier in his &quot;A la manière de Chabrier&quot;, based on Chabrier&#x27;s piano piece &quot;Mélancolie&quot;.

Poulenc said that he had &quot;L&#x27;étoile&quot; in mind while he wrote &quot;Les mamelles de Tirésias&quot;. Huebner comments that the influence of Chabrier on Poulenc and the other members of Les Six was particularly strong, although the later composers were more often drawn to the humorous, parodic side of Chabrier&#x27;s oeuvre than to the romantic and serious. Other French composers whose music shows the influence of Chabrier include Charles Lecocq, Messager and Satie.

Composers from other countries who works show the influence of Chabrier include Stravinsky, whose &quot;Petrushka&quot; has thematic and melodic echoes of Chabrier, and Mahler, who called &quot;España&quot; &quot;the beginnings of modern music&quot; and alluded to the &quot;Dance Villageoise&quot; in the &quot;Rondo Burleske&quot; movement of his Ninth Symphony. Richard Strauss, who was an admirer of Chabrier, conducted the first stage performance of the one act of &quot;Briséïs&quot;, and the critic Gerald Larner comments that Strauss was evidently influenced by the work when he came to compose his &quot;Salome&quot; eight years later.
==Chabrier and art==
Chabrier was known for his continual contacts with contemporary artists, particularly painters of the Impressionist school. He left a rich collection of paintings by contemporary French painters; Edward Lockspeiser felt that &quot;if ever it could be reassembled [the collection] would be rivalled, among collections of other composers, only by that of Chausson, which consisted largely of Delacroix&quot;. A sale of his collection at the Hôtel Drouot on 26 March 1896 included works by Cézanne, Manet, Monet, Renoir, and Sisley.

Chabrier himself was frequently painted or sketched by his artist friends. Two of these portraits are reproduced above: a drawing of Chabrier at the piano (1887) by Édouard Detaille and Manet&#x27;s &quot;Portrait de Chabrier&quot; (oil on canvas, 1881). He is seen at the piano in &quot;Autour du piano&quot; by Henri Fantin-Latour (right). Other portraits of Chabrier include a crayon drawing by James Tissot (1861); in the stage box in &quot;L&#x27;orchestre de l&#x27;Opéra&quot; by Degas (c. 1868); on the right of &quot;Bal masqué à l&#x27;opéra&quot; by Manet (1873), a pastel sketch by Manet (1880), a portrait by Marcellin Desboutin (c.1881) and a bust (1886) by Constantin Meunier.

Johnson comments that although it now seems extraordinary that the owner of such magnificent works of art should have money worries, this was before Impressionist paintings became sought-after and expensive, and &quot;in any case, this was a composer who regarded his collection as a spiritual necessity rather than a financial asset&quot;. Chabrier was also a collector of avant-garde writing; as well as Verlaine, among others he sought out the works of Régnier, Willette and Gill.

<doc id="901482" wikidata="Q2141173" url="?curid=901482" title="Transaxle">
<text>A transaxle is a single mechanical device which combines the functions of an automobile&#x27;s transmission, axle, and differential into one integrated assembly. It can be produced in both manual and automatic versions.

==Engine and drive at the same end==
Transaxles are nearly universal in all automobile configurations that have the engine placed at the same end of the car as the driven wheels: the front-engine/front-wheel-drive; rear-engine/rear-wheel-drive; and mid-engine/rear-wheel-drive arrangements.

Many mid- and rear-engined vehicles use a transverse engine and transaxle, similar to a front-wheel-drive unit. Others use a longitudinal engine and transaxle like Ferrari&#x27;s 1989 Mondial t which used a &quot;T&quot; arrangement with a longitudinal engine connected to a transverse transaxle. Front-wheel-drive versions of modern Audis, from the A4 upwards, along with their related marques from the Volkswagen Group (which share the same automobile layout) also use a similar layout, but with the transaxle also mounted longitudinally.

The front-wheel-drive Renault 16 had a longitudinal engine and transaxle, with the engine behind the transaxle. The transaxle case was designed to allow the final-drive ring gear to be on either side of the pinion; this allowed the engine-transaxle assembly to be used in the rear-wheel-drive Lotus Europa, which had the engine in front of the transaxle (i.e., mid-engined).

==Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive transaxles==
Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles tend to have the transmission up front just after the engine, but sometimes a front-engine drives a rear-mounted transaxle. This is generally done for reasons of weight distribution and is therefore common on sports cars. Another advantage is that since the driveshaft spins at engine speed, it only has to endure the torque of the engine instead of the torque multiplied by the 1st gear ratio. This design was pioneered in the 1934 Škoda Popular, and then in the 1950 Lancia Aurelia, designed by Vittorio Jano.

Since this placement of the gearbox is unsuitable for a live axle (due to excessive unsprung mass), the rear suspension is either independent, or uses a de Dion tube (notably in Alfa Romeos). Rare exceptions to this rule were the Bugatti T46 and T50 which had a three speed gearbox on a live axle.
Notable front-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles with a transaxle design include:

Note: The C5, C6 and C7 Corvettes, produced in the 1997 to 2019 model years, do not feature an integrated transaxle, where the transmission, axle and differential are combined into a single assembly. These years actually featured a rear-mounted transmission, which was a stand-alone unit bolted directly to the differential. While many, including General Motors, refer to this configuration as a transaxle, the first Corvette with an integrated transaxle was produced in the eighth generation Corvette, which was released in the 2020 model year.

==Rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive transaxles==
Volkswagen and later Porsche made extensive use of transaxles in their rear (and mid) engined vehicles. Over the years, models adopting this configuration have included:

==Four-wheel-drive==
All Audi cars with longitudinal engines and their &#x27;trademark&#x27; quattro four-wheel-drive (4WD) system, along with their related marques from the Volkswagen Group which share the same layout, utilise a transaxle. This is mounted immediately behind the front-mounted engine (again, longitudinally) and contains the &#x27;gearbox&#x27; (manual, automatic, DSG, or CVT), along with both the centre differential, and the front differential and final drive unit.

The Nissan GT-R and Ferrari FF (and its successors) are unusual in being all-wheel-drive cars with front-engined layouts and rear-mounted transaxles. In the Nissan, one driveshaft sends power to the transaxle (which also contains the &#x27;center&#x27; differential) and another driveshaft sends power back along the car to the front wheels. In the Ferrari, the rear transaxle works in a conventional manner, whilst the drive to the front wheels comes from a separate gearbox at the front of the engine.

Other 4WD applications include:
*1979-2002 Volkswagen Vanagon/Caravelle Syncro Edition - rear-engined, transaxle in the front;
*1984–1986 Ford RS200 – mid-engined, with the gearbox in the front;
*1989-2001 Mitsubishi 3000GT - front-engined, gearbox (transmission, front and centre differential) in the front;
*2007–on Nissan GT-R – front-engined, gearbox in the rear.
*2011–2016 Ferrari FF

<text>Harry &quot;Happy&quot; Maione (October 7, 1908 – February 19, 1942) was a New York mobster who served as a hitman for Murder, Inc. (the enforcement arm of the National Crime Syndicate) during the 1930s. Maione was called &quot;Happy&quot; because his face displayed an eternal scowl.

==Early years==

As a young man, Maione led the Ocean Hill Hooligans, an Italian street gang in the Ocean Hill, Brooklyn section of New York. His protégé in this gang was Frank &quot;The Dasher&quot; Abbandando. Maione had a son, Albert Maione, who eventually became an associate with the Gambino crime family. Maione&#x27;s older brother was Louis &quot;The Duke&quot; Maione.

In 1931, Maione and Abbandando helped Abe &quot;Kid Twist&quot; Reles and Martin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Goldstein eliminate their gangster rivals, the Shapiro Brothers (Meyer, Irving, and William). Previously that year, the Shapiros had unsuccessfully tried to murder Reles and Goldstein. Meyer Shapiro then abducted Reles&#x27; girlfriend and raped her. Reles and Goldstein wanted revenge and the two wanted to take over the Shapiro operations. On July 11, 1931, Irving Shapiro was gunned down near his apartment. On September 17, 1931, Meyer was found shot to death in the basement of a tenement building on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side.

==Murder, Inc.==

Maione, Abbandando, Reles, and Goldstein then banded together. They were soon joined by Harry &quot;Pittsburgh Phil&quot; Strauss, Albert &quot;Tick Tock&quot; Tannenbaum, Seymour &quot;Blue Jaw&quot; Magoon, Louis Capone, Charles &quot;The Bug&quot; Workman and Vito &quot;Chicken Head&quot; Gurino.

The gang started picking up murder contracts from the National Crime Syndicate with the help of Syndicate Board Member Joe Adonis. The gang soon became the official murder-for-hire squad of the Syndicate, and was dubbed &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot; by the press. Maione acted as the Italian liaison to the Jewish members of Murder, Inc.; Reles was his counterpart on the Jewish side. Murder, Inc. was directed by the brutal Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter (another member of the Syndicate board) and the nefarious Albert &quot;The Executioner&quot; Anastasia. Maione reportedly killed at least 12 men himself while working for Murder, Inc.

==Eliminating potential witnesses==

In the mid-1930s, New York District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey targeted Buchalter for prosecution. In response, Buchalter started eliminating all potential witnesses. Murder, Inc., rubbed out anyone that Buchalter even suspected of being an informant. Loan shark George &quot;Whitey&quot; Rudnick was one such victim; he was killed by Maione, Abbandando, and Strauss on May 11, 1937.

In 1940, Reles became an informant for the State of New York. He then implicated Maione and Abbandando in the horrific slaying of Rudnick. According to Reles, the men supposedly killed Rudnick and started stuffing him back in their car. Suddenly, the &quot;corpse&quot; started coughing. To finish him off, Strauss stabbed Rudnick 63 times with an ice pick and Maione buried a meat cleaver in his skull.

In May 1940, Maione was convicted of first degree murder, but the verdict was overturned on appeal. After a second trial, Maione was convicted again. This time, the conviction was not overturned by an appeals court. On February 19, 1942, Maione, along with Frank Abbandando, was executed in the electric chair at Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York.

<text>Road House is a 1989 American action film directed by Rowdy Herrington and produced by Joel Silver. The film stars Patrick Swayze as the bouncer at a newly refurbished roadside bar, who protects a small town in Missouri from a corrupt businessman. The cast also features Ben Gazzara, Kelly Lynch, and Sam Elliott.

Upon its release in U.S. theaters on May 19, 1989 by United Artists, &quot;Road House&quot; earned $61 million worldwide on a $15 million production budget. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, who lamented its excessive violence and sleaziness, and expressed incredulity at Swayze&#x27;s character. In the years since, it went on to achieve cult status. Its popularity resulted in the creation of the &quot;Road House&quot; franchise, which includes a stage adaptation, a sequel in 2006, and a remake in 2024.

==Plot==
James Dalton is a professional bouncer working security for a club in New York City. Although stoic and cool-headed, Dalton is tormented by memories of a man he killed in self-defense by ripping out his throat. Frank Tilghman, a businessman, recruits Dalton to take over security at his club Double Deuce in Jasper, Missouri. Tilghman plans to invest substantial funds into the dilapidated club and needs Dalton&#x27;s highly regarded skills to tackle the endemic violence and rough customers. Dalton agrees in exchange for full authority over the club&#x27;s operations, immediately firing several employees for poor behavior, theft, and drug dealing. For privacy, Dalton stays in a sparse barn owned by a farmer named Emmett, unaware that the mansion across the adjacent lake is owned by Brad Wesley, a crime lord controlling the town through bribery, intimidation, and violence.

Wesley&#x27;s nephew Pat, who is one of the fired employees, intimidates Tilghman into giving him his job back and attacks Dalton, who badly injures Pat and his accomplices. Receiving a knife wound in the process, Dalton visits a hospital and befriends Dr. Elizabeth Clay to whom Wesley is also attracted. After sending his henchmen to unsuccessfully try to disrupt business at the Double Deuce, Wesley offers to hire Dalton himself. Dalton refuses and Wesley uses his connections to prevent the Double Deuce from purchasing alcohol from any suppliers. Dalton uses his own connections to secure some supplies and reunites with his mentor Wade Garrett, an aging bouncer who arrives in town after a disconcerting phone call from Dalton. Wesley sends his men to destroy the Double Deuce&#x27;s supplies, but Dalton and Garrett defeat them.

One evening, the auto shop adjacent to the Double Deuce—owned by Elizabeth&#x27;s uncle Red Webster—is destroyed by arson. After Dalton and the crowds return inside the Double Deuce, they find Wesley awaiting them, who deploys his henchman Jimmy Reno to start a brawl with the Double Deuce bouncers. When Dalton intervenes, Wesley calls an end to the fight and leaves the bar. Wesley continues to sabotage other businesses as the local owners discuss their futile efforts to stop him. Garrett attempts to calm Dalton, trying to assuage his guilt about killing in self-defense and his frustration at being unable to end Wesley&#x27;s campaign. Elizabeth also tries to dissuade Dalton before Emmett&#x27;s home is blown up by Jimmy. Although Emmett is saved, the enraged Dalton fights Jimmy and rips his throat out, much to Elizabeth&#x27;s shock and disgust.

Later, Wesley contacts Dalton, threatening to kill either Elizabeth or Garrett. A badly beaten Garrett arrives at the Double Deuce, while Dalton leaves to check on Elizabeth, who is safe but unwilling to leave with him. Dalton returns to the bar to find Garrett murdered. Distraught, Dalton storms Wesley&#x27;s estate, kills most of his henchmen and defeats Wesley, but relents from killing Wesley himself. Elizabeth arrives and reconciles with Dalton, but Wesley recovers and attempts to shoot him before being shot dead by the locals, including Emmett and Red. The police arrive, but all present claim that they saw nothing. Sometime later, the modernized and refined Double Deuce bustles with customers while Dalton and Elizabeth swim together in a lake.

==Cast==

==Production==

===Casting===
Annette Bening was originally cast as Dr. Elizabeth Clay. However, since she had little chemistry with Patrick Swayze, she was replaced by Kelly Lynch. Scott Glenn turned down the role of Jimmy Reno, which eventually went to Marshall Teague. Joel Silver cast Sam Elliott as Garrett due to his &quot;baggage&quot;.

===Filming===
Filming started in April 1988 on location throughout California, primarily in Newhall, Valencia, and Canyon Country. The filming of much of the &quot;New Double Deuce&quot; used Anaheim&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy&quot; Boogie, also later called the &quot;Bandstand&quot; among other names until it closed. The opening and monster truck scenes were filmed in Reedley, California. The Kings River runs between the two residences. The monster truck used was Bigfoot #7, which was originally built for the film. The scene cost $500,000 to film. While filming the famous fistfight scene, Marshall broke Swayze&#x27;s ribs.

==Music==
The soundtrack for &quot;Road House&quot; features Canadian guitarist Jeff Healey, whose band is featured in the film as the house band for the Double Deuce. Cruzados are the band in the opening credits, contributing three songs to the film that never made the soundtrack. Patrick Swayze also wrote one song and sang two for the soundtrack. The film&#x27;s score was composed by Michael Kamen. A limited edition 14-track score album part of the Special Collection was issued by Intrada Records in 2012. An expanded limited 31-track score was reissued for the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary by La-La Land Records in 2019.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
The film premiered in New York and Los Angeles on May 19, 1989.

===Home media===

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Road House&quot; grossed $30 million in the United States and Canada and $31 million internationally for a worldwide total of $61 million. It has also found life on cable television.

===Critical response===
Upon its release &quot;Road House&quot; received mostly negative reviews from critics, while audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and commented, &quot;&quot;Road House&quot; exists right on the edge between the &#x27;good-bad movie&#x27; and the merely bad. I hesitate to recommend it, because so much depends on the ironic vision of the viewer. This is not a good movie. But viewed in the right frame of mind, it is not a boring one, either.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was less complimentary, calling it &quot;outrageous in terms of its cartoon-like plotting and dialogue&quot; and lamenting &quot;Swayze’s mindless posturing. A young star has sold himself to become a pinup boy.&quot;

In the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Hal Hinson&#x27;s scathing review dismissed the film as &quot;Full of gratuitous mayhem, head-bashing, gay-bashing and woman-bashing, &quot;Road House&quot; has a malicious, almost putrid tone.&quot; Caryn James of the &quot;New York Times&quot; was similarly critical, saying &quot;&quot;Road House&quot; is much funnier than most comedies, until it turns vile instead of just stupid.&quot; She also said the film made Swayze&#x27;s career &quot;look like a bad joke&quot; and sent it &quot;spinning out of control&quot;. Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, compared &quot;Road House&quot; unfavorably to Swayze&#x27;s recent hit &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, &quot;It wasn’t sex that &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; delivered, it was romance. But in deep &quot;Road House&quot; country, . . . the undefined made crassly visible, there isn’t a whiff of romance anywhere, any more than there’s a single jot of common sense.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Road House&quot; has a rating of 44% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 5.40/10. The consensus states: &quot;Whether &quot;Road House&quot; is simply bad or so bad it&#x27;s good depends largely on the audience&#x27;s fondness for Swayze -- and tolerance for violently cheesy action.&quot; 

===Accolades===
&quot;Road House&quot; was nominated for (but did not &quot;win&quot;) five Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Patrick Swayze), Worst Supporting Actor (Ben Gazzara), Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

==Other media==

A sequel, &quot;Road House 2&quot;, was released directly to DVD in July 2006. Set many years later and telling the story of Dalton&#x27;s adult son, it featured no characters from the original cast and only a few references to Dalton (who was reportedly shot dead before the film took place). The sequel confirmed that Dalton&#x27;s first name was James, which could be seen momentarily on the medical chart in the original film&#x27;s hospital scene, but which had been otherwise left unsaid. At the same time &quot;Road House 2&quot; was released, the original film was reissued in a deluxe edition featuring, among other features, separate audio commentary tracks by director Herrington, Kevin Smith, and Scott Mosier, which the duo had expressed an interest in during the introduction of the tenth anniversary &quot;Clerks&quot; DVD.

In 2003, an off-Broadway musical production of &quot;Road House&quot; was staged as a campy comedy by Timothy Haskell, as seen by its full title of &quot;Road House: The Stage Version Of The Cinema Classic That Starred Patrick Swayze, Except This One Stars Taimak From The 80&#x27;s Cult Classic &quot;The Last Dragon&quot; Wearing A Blonde Mullet Wig&quot;.

In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; season 8 episode &quot;Brian&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot;, Peter Griffin purchases a DVD copy of &quot;Road House&quot; for a dollar at a closing video store. After watching the film, he decides that the only way to solve every problem is by roundhouse kicking everything in sight including his family. The episode was dedicated in memory of Swayze, who died of pancreatic cancer on September 14, 2009.

Following the death of Eric Garner, the New York City Police Department began using a scene from &quot;Road House&quot; as part of a mandatory, three-day retraining course for 22,000 officers expected to &quot;be nice&quot; under pressure.

In the &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; season 4, episode 2 titled &quot;A Docent, A Little Lady And A Bouncer Named Dalton&quot; (November 2020), it is discovered that Mary&#x27;s secret pleasure is watching action movies like &quot;Road House,&quot; which creates an unexpected bond with her teenager son Georgie.

===Remake===
In September 2015, it was announced that Ronda Rousey would star in a remake of &quot;Road House&quot;. A month later, Nick Cassavetes was announced to write and direct the film. However, plans for the film fell through and the remake was quietly canceled in 2016.

In November 2021, it was reported that Jake Gyllenhaal was in talks to star in a remake of &quot;Road House&quot; by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer with Doug Liman directing. In August 2022, a full cast was announced, and principal photography commenced. The film was released worldwide on Amazon Prime Video on March 21, 2024, following its premiere at South by Southwest.

<text>The 34th Division was an infantry division of the British Army that was raised in 1914, during the First World War. The division was raised from volunteers for Lord Kitchener&#x27;s New Armies, originally made up of infantry battalions raised by public subscription or private patronage. The division was taken over by the War Office in September 1915. It served in France and Belgium in the trenches of the Western Front for the duration of the war.

==Unit history==
The 34th Division was one of the six created for the Fourth New Army on 10 December 1914. The division was originally made up of Pals battalions, and two brigades of the Northumberland Fusiliers; the Tyneside Scottish and Tyneside Irish. Major-General Edward Ingouville-Williams, an experienced commander who had led a brigade in action with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), took command of the division in June 1915.

The division landed in France in January 1916. The division&#x27;s first major action was the attack at La Boisselle on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, which began on 1 July. The division suffered heavy casualties and many of the original Pals were killed. It went on to suffer further losses at the Battle of the Lys in April 1918.

The division participated in the Second Battle of the Marne.

<text>Mykolaiv (, ), also known as Nikolaev ( ) is a city and a hromada (municipality) in southern Ukraine. Mykolaiv is the administrative center of Mykolaiv Raion (district) and Mykolaiv Oblast (province). The city of Mykolaiv, which provides Ukraine with access to the Black Sea, is the location of the most downriver bridge crossing of the Southern Bug river. This city is one of the main shipbuilding centers of the Black Sea. Aside from three shipyards within the city, there are a number of research centers specializing in shipbuilding such as the State Research and Design Shipbuilding Center, Zoria-Mashproekt and others. As of 2022, the city has a population of Mykolaiv holds the honorary title Hero City of Ukraine.

The city serves as a transportation hub for Ukraine, containing a sea port, commercial port, river port, highway, railway junction, and airport.

Much of Mykolaiv&#x27;s land area consists of parks. Park Peremohy (&quot;Victory&quot;) is a large park on the peninsula just north of the city center, on the north side of the Inhul river.

== Name ==
The city is known under two names, which differ in Ukrainian and Russian; there are several transliterations of each name. The Ukrainian name of the city is Миколаїв, transliterated as Mykolaiv. The Russian name, Никола́ев, transliterates as Nikolaev or as &quot;Nikolayev&quot;.
The city&#x27;s founding was made by the Russian conquests during the Second Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792. Founded by Prince Grigory Potemkin as Nikolaev, it was the last of the many cities he established. On 27 August 1789, Potemkin ordered its naming near the wharf at the mouth of the Ingul river, on a high, cool and breezy spot where the Ingul river meets the Southern Bug river. To build the city he brought in peasants, soldiers, and Turkish prisoners; 2,500 were working there during 1789. The shipyards were built first (1788).
Potemkin named the city after Saint Nicholas, the patron of seafarers, on whose day (6 December) he had obtained victory at the siege of Ochakov in 1788. The name &quot;Nikolaev&quot; is known from the legal order (writ) Number 1065 by Prince Potemkin to dated 27 August 1789.

In 1920, after the establishment of Soviet power, the Odesa provincial council (of laborers and peasants&#x27; deputies) petitioned the Soviet Ukrainian government—the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee (VUTSIK)—to rename the city of Mykolaiv to Vernoleninsk (&quot;Faithful to Lenin&quot;). As the city of Mykolaiv was a district center of the Odesan province, presumably, the petition would have been initiated by the Odesa city council, but documentary evidence of this so far has not been identified. On 15 April 1924 the Plenum of the Central Administrative-Territorial Commission of the VUTSIK considered and rejected the petition of the Odesan executive committee. Perhaps the members of the Soviet-Ukraine government thought that the name sounded too obsequious.

Information regarding the alleged renaming of Mykolaiv was disseminated by German maps of the 1920s and 1930s, as well as in German encyclopedic publications in 1927 and 1932, which show Vernoleninsk on the USSR part of the European maps. The city was designated as Mykolaiv in publications of the same map in other languages.

To distinguish Mykolaiv from the much smaller west Ukraine city of Mykolaiv in Lviv Oblast, the latter is sometimes called &quot;Mykolaiv on the Dniester&quot; after the major river that it is situated on, while the former is located on the Southern Bug, another major river, and may also be called &quot;Mykolaiv on the Bug&quot;.

== History ==
Archaeologists have found proof of ancient settlements on the territory of Mykolaiv. In 2018, archaeologists discovered a sunken Ancient Greek ship near the Mykolaiv region, dating from the fifth century BC, the period of Greek colonization of the Northern Black Sea. Researchers stated: &quot;This Ancient Greek ship is one of the oldest known in the Northern Black Sea.&quot;

The city has long had close associations with shipbuilding.

The area was populated throughout time by Scythians, ancient Greeks, Slavic tribes, hordes of nomads and free Zaporozhian Cossacks. However, the intensive settlement of the Mykolaiv peninsula started in the last quarter of the 18th century already after the liberation of the northern Black Sea coast region from the Ottoman Empire.

The Russian Empire&#x27;s Black Sea Navy Headquarters was in Mykolaiv for more than 100 years until the Imperial Russian Navy moved it to Sevastopol, near the southern tip of the Crimean Peninsula. During the Crimean War (1853–1856), Mykolaiv became the main rear base to support Russia&#x27;s efforts in the war. Most businesses that were created in the city belonged to the military-industrial complex, and, consequently, Mykolaiv was closed to foreigners for many decades.

By the late 19th century, Mykolaiv&#x27;s port ranked third in the Russian Empire (after Saint Petersburg and Odesa) in trade with foreign countries. Grain-export suppliers of the steppe region (of Ukraine and Southern Russia) were the greatest in the Russian Empire. Mykolaiv had become a great industrial center in the Southern Ukraine.

Jews started to settle in Mykolaiv in the late 18th century. By being in the area west of the Dnieper which was where Jews were legally allowed to reside (the Pale of Settlement), Mykolaiv became a major Jewish centre of the Russian Empire in the 19th century. During the course of the 19th century, the Czarist governments largely banned Jews from living east of the Dnieper River. In 1866 restrictions were lifted and the Jewish community of Mykolaiv developed rapidly but years later Jews suffered in the pogroms of May 1881 and April 1899. The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson (the seventh leader in the Chabad-Lubavitch dynasty) was born in Mykolaiv on 18 April 1902. 

The town was occupied in 1918 by German troops who were commanded by Field Marshal Hermann von Eichhorn.
It was subsequently occupied in 1919 by French and Greek troops who had been attached to the French-commanded Armée d&#x27;Orient (1915–1919) in the course of the - which formed part of the Southern Russia campaign of 1918–1919 by the Allies of World War I during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.
In 1920, Soviet power was established. In 1926 there were 21,786 Jews (about 20.8% of the total population) in Mykolaiv.

In the course of Operation Barbarossa Mykolaiv was occupied on 16 August 1941 by German invaders. In September, German forces massacred over 35,000 non-combatants, most of them Jews, in the city and its region. During the occupation, an underground partisan sabotage group, the Mykolaiv Center, conducted guerilla activities. On 28 March 1944 the city was liberated, in part because of Soviet Senior Lieutenant Konstantin F. Olshansky&#x27;s marines and their daring raid during which the majority of his troops were killed.

In the post-war period Mykolaiv became one of the shipbuilding centers of the USSR, with three shipyards: Black Sea, 61 Kommunara, and Okean.

The asteroid 8141 Nikolaev (1982 SO4) was discovered in 1982 by Nikolai Chernykh at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory and was named in honor of the city.

In March 2012, Mykolaiv gained international notoriety for lawlessness and police corruption following the rape and murder of Oksana Makar. Her three attackers were apprehended, but two were released because of family connections to local government officials. After a media outcry and public protests, all three attackers were charged with her murder.

During the Euromaidan protests of 2013–2014, Mykolayiv was the scene of anti-Yanukovich protests. After the victory of Euromaidan, the situation calmed down somewhat until 7 April 2014, when some pro-Russians tried to take over the local administration building. Pro-Ukrainians stopped them from taking over the administration building and destroyed the pro-Russian camp not far from it, after which the situation in the city became calm.

Until 18 July 2020, Mykolaiv was incorporated as a city of oblast significance. It also served as the administrative center of Mykolaiv and Vitovka Raions even though it did not belong to any of these raions. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Mykolaiv Oblast to four, the city of Mykolaiv was merged into Mykolaiv Raion.

In February and March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian military forces attacked Mykolaiv and placed it under siege. Ukrainian forces barred Russian forces from the city, though Russian artillery continued to shell it. By July, half of the pre-war population had left the city.

== Administrative status ==

Mykolaiv is the administrative center of Mykolaiv Oblast (region), as well as that of Mykolaiv Raion. It hosts the administration of Mykolaiv urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine.

== Geography ==
Mykolaiv is located in a primarily flat terrain area, the fertile, grain-producing steppe region of southern Ukraine. The nearest mountains to Mykolaiv are south, at the southern end of the Crimean Peninsula. The lack of any mountain barriers north of Mykolaiv means that cold Arctic winds can blow south, unimpeded by any terrain elevation, to Mykolaiv in winter.

Mykolaiv is on a peninsula along the estuary of the Southern Bug river where it meets the Inhul River, from the Black Sea. Both the Inhul River and the Southern Bug River follow very winding courses just before they join at the northeast corner of Mykolaiv. This has created several long and narrow peninsulas just north of Mykolaiv, and the main part of Mykolaiv is itself on a peninsula at a 180-degree bend in the Southern Bug River.

The area of the city is .

Mykolaiv is in the second time zone (Eastern European Time).

== Awards ==
The Soviet Government awarded Mykolaiv the Order of the Red Banner of Labour on 31 December 1970, for successfully fulfilling its assignments for the development of industrial production, in the USSR&#x27;s five-year economic plan.

On 25 March 2022 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Mykolaiv the title of Hero City of Ukraine due to the Battle of Mykolaiv.

== Administrative districts ==

== Official symbols ==
Mykolaiv adopted its current coat of arms on 26 September 1997. Its design came from the one adopted in 1883, by removing the symbol of Kherson province to which Mykolaiv didn&#x27;t belong anymore.
Mykolaiv adopted its current flag on 2 July 1999 and its anthem on 11 September 2004.

== Economy ==
Mykolaiv is a major shipbuilding center of Ukraine since the time of both the Russian Empire (1721–1917) and the now defunct Soviet Union (1922–1991) and an important river port. The city has three major shipyards one of which is capable of building large navy ships. Other important industries are mechanical engineering, power engineering, metallurgy and food industry.

Mykolaiv was closed to foreign visitors until the late 1980s due to the large number of secret Soviet Navy projects that took place in the city (as well as due to its military air base, turbine factory and military port). The majority of the Soviet Navy&#x27;s surface ships, including its only aircraft carrier, the aircraft carrier&quot; Kuznetsov&quot;, were built in Mykolaiv.

In May 2011, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych visited Mykolaiv and said that Ukraine was serious about reviving and further developing its shipbuilding industry in the Mykolaiv region.

One of the largest industrial businesses in the city is the Mykolaiv Aluminia Factory (formerly part of Rusal and currently owned by Glencore), which produces aluminium oxide (alumina), raw material for the production of aluminum.

In addition to heavy industry, the city has a developed food processing industry, including a juice maker, Sandora (part of PepsiCo), a dairy products maker, Laktalis-Mykolaiv, and a brewery, Yantar. Nibulon (Ukrainian: Нібулон), one of Ukraine&#x27;s biggest agriculture companies specialized in the production and exportation of grain such as wheat, barley and corn is headquartered in Mykolaiv. The company has its own maritime fleet and shipyard, the Nibulon Shipyard, and also developed its own river fleet to transport grain to export terminals.

In January 2017, the Mykolaiv Development Agency released a promo video of the city&#x27;s investment potential.

The Mykolaiv Armored Factory (owned by Ukroboronprom) has been a large repair facility for Ukraine&#x27;s military since the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War. Engineers at the plant designed an armored ambulance based on the BTR-70 to be used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

== Ukrainian military presence ==

Mykolaiv, being an important strategic city in southern Ukraine has a significant Ukrainian military presence, including the shipyards that build Ukraine&#x27;s surface navy ships, the Mykolaiv Ukrainian Navy base, the &quot;MARP&quot; aircraft repair factory (Mykolaiv), and the Kulbakino army base (in the Mykolaiv Oblast, outside of the city of Mykolaiv).

<text>Dolores Conchita Figueroa del Rivero (January 23, 1933 – January 30, 2024), known professionally as Chita Rivera, was an American actress, singer, and dancer. Rivera received numerous accolades including two Tony Awards, two Drama Desk Awards, and a Drama League Award. She was the first Latina and the first Latino American to receive a Kennedy Center Honor in 2002, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009. She won the Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2018.

After making her Broadway debut as a dancer in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1950), she went on to originate roles in Broadway musicals such as Anita in &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1957), Velma Kelly in &quot;Chicago&quot; (1975), and the title role in &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; (1993). She was a ten-time Tony Award nominee, winning the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical twice for her roles in &quot;The Rink&quot; (1984) and &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; (1993). She was Tony-nominated for her roles in &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; (1961), &quot;Chicago&quot; (1975), &quot;Bring Back Birdie&quot; (1981), &quot;Merlin&quot; (1983), &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Girls&quot; (1986), &quot;Nine&quot; (2003), &quot;Chita Rivera: The Dancer&#x27;s Life&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Visit&quot; (2015).

Rivera acted in the film &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (1969) and appeared in &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1978), and &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot; (2021). She played Connie Richardson in the CBS sitcom &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (1973–1974). She also appeared on television in &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; (1963), &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (1971), and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; (2005). Her autobiography, &quot;Chita: A Memoir&quot;, was published in 2023.

==Early life and education==
Dolores Conchita Figueroa del Rivero was born in Washington, D.C. on January 23, 1933, the daughter of Katherine (&quot;née&quot; Anderson), a government clerk, and Pedro Julio Figueroa del Rivero, a clarinetist and saxophonist for the U.S. Navy Band. Her father was born in Puerto Rico. His family names are of Galician origin. Her mother was of Scottish, Irish, and African-American descent. Rivera was one of five children. Rivera was seven years old when her mother was widowed and went to work at The Pentagon.

In 1944, Rivera&#x27;s mother enrolled her in the Jones-Haywood School of Ballet (now the Jones Haywood School of Dance). Later, when she was 15, a teacher from George Balanchine&#x27;s School of American Ballet visited their studio, and Rivera was one of two students picked to audition in New York City; she was accompanied to the audition by Doris Jones, one of the people who ran the Jones-Haywood School. Rivera&#x27;s audition was successful, and she was accepted into the school and given a scholarship.

==Career==
===1951–1993: Breakthrough and stardom ===

In 1951, Rivera accompanied a friend to the audition for the touring company of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; starring Elaine Stritch and ended up winning the role herself. She followed this by landing roles in other Broadway productions such as &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Can-Can&quot;, &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; starring Sammy Davis Jr., and &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; and dancing on &quot;The Maurice Chevalier Special&quot; in 1956. In 1957, she was cast as Anita in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, the role which would make her a Broadway star.

In 1960, Rivera was nominated for a Tony Award for creating the role of Rose in &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; opposite Dick Van Dyke. She appeared three times on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and won raves for her performance on Broadway and in London opposite Peter Marshall, but was passed over for the film version where the role was played by Janet Leigh. In 1963, Rivera was a guest on &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; and was cast opposite Alfred Drake in &quot;Zenda&quot;. The Broadway-bound musical closed on the road but in 1964, Rivera returned to Broadway in &quot;Bajour&quot; and television in &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;&quot;.&quot; After seeing her perform in the musical, music producer Norman Petty approached her in New York and inquired about recording with him. Her first single was released in 1965 on the Dot Records label, with a second single issued in 1966. Making a trip to Petty&#x27;s studio in Clovis, New Mexico in 1966, she was backed by The Fireballs for a full album of Buddy Holly cover songs, but the project went unreleased.

Among many national tours, Rivera starred most notably in &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; directed by Bob Fosse, playing the role of Nickie in the film adaptation of &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; with Shirley MacLaine (1969). Rivera appeared three times on &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, twice on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (including an episode airing February 22, 1971) and between 1973 and 1974, played Connie Richardson on &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. In 1975, Rivera was nominated for a Tony Award starring as Velma Kelly opposite Gwen Verdon in the original cast of the musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, directed by Bob Fosse. In addition to her ballet instructors, Rivera cited Leonard Bernstein and Verdon, with whom she starred in &quot;Chicago&quot;, as influential to her success. She later made a cameo appearance in the 2002 film version. She appeared as Fastrada in a filmed-for-television version of the musical &quot;Pippin&quot; in 1981, and was nominated for Tony and Drama Desk awards for &quot;Bring Back Birdie&quot; (1981) and a Tony Award for &quot;Merlin&quot; (1983) on Broadway.

In 1984, Rivera starred in the Kander and Ebb musical &quot;The Rink&quot; with Liza Minnelli and won her first Tony and Drama Desk awards for her role as Anna. In 1986, while earning a Tony Award nomination for her performance in the Jerry Herman musical, &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Girls&quot;, Rivera was in a severe accident when her car collided with a taxi on West 86th Street in Manhattan. Injuries sustained included the breaking of her left leg in twelve places, requiring eighteen screws and two braces to mend. After rehabilitation, Rivera continued to perform on stage. Recovered, in 1988, she toured the country in &quot;Can-Can&quot; and got involved in a restaurant venture in partnership with the novelist Daniel Simone. The eatery, located on 42nd Street between 9th and 10th Avenue, was named &quot;Chita&#x27;s&quot; after her. It soon became a significant attraction for the after-theater crowds and operated until 1994.

===1993–2023: Later career and roles ===

In 1993, Rivera received Tony and Drama Desk awards for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her dual portrayal of Aurora and Spider Woman in the musical &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;, written by Kander and Ebb. Rivera later participated in the London edition of Kander and Ebb&#x27;s long-running revival of &quot;Chicago&quot;, this time in the role of Roxie Hart. Rivera starred in the Goodman Theatre production of the musical &quot;The Visit&quot; (also by Kander and Ebb) as Claire Zachanassian in 2001. In 2002, she became a Kennedy Center Honoree. In 2003, Rivera returned to Broadway in the 2003 revival of &quot;Nine&quot; as Liliane La Fleur and received her eighth career Tony Award nomination (Best Featured Actress in a Musical) and fourth Drama Desk Award nomination (Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical). She appeared with Antonio Banderas. She later appeared on the revival&#x27;s cast album.

She guest-starred along with Michele Lee in a February 2005 episode of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, and in December of that year, &quot;Chita Rivera: The Dancer&#x27;s Life&quot;, a retrospective of her career, opened on Broadway. She received another Tony nomination for her self-portrayal. Though she was expected to reprise her role in a Signature Theatre staging of &quot;The Visit&quot; in autumn of 2007, that was later postponed to the following season. Instead, she performed at New York&#x27;s Feinstein&#x27;s at the Regency supper club in New York for two weeks and, in 2008, appeared in a revised production of &quot;The Visit&quot; at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia, co-starring George Hearn. Rivera guest-starred on Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Johnny and the Sprites&quot; as Queen of All Magical Beings. The episode debuted on March 15, 2008.

In August 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama presented Rivera the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In the 1960s, Rivera had recorded two albums, &quot;Chita Rivera: Get Me To The Church On Time&quot; and &quot;And Now I Sing&quot;. These early 1960s albums were reissued on CD by Stage Door Records in February 2013. In November 2008, Rivera released her third solo album, &quot;And Now I Swing&quot;. Rivera performed in a staged concert of &quot;The Visit&quot; as a benefit at the Ambassador Theatre on November 30, 2011. In 2012, Rivera played &quot;Princess Puffer&quot; in the Broadway revival of &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; at Studio 54. She was the Grand Marshal of the Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City on June 9, 2013.

Rivera returned to Broadway in &quot;The Visit&quot;, the final musical written by John Kander, Fred Ebb, and Terrence McNally. The musical opened at the Lyceum Theatre on March 26, 2015, and closed on June 14, 2015. Co-starring Roger Rees, the production was directed by John Doyle and choreographed by Graciela Daniele. Rivera received praise for her performance, and was nominated for a Tony Award, Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical and a Drama Desk Award. The Astaire Awards were rebranded The Chita Rivera Awards for Dance and Choreography in 2017. In 2018, she received a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2019, &quot;Time Out New York&quot; named her &quot;one of the best Broadway divas of all time.&quot; 

Rivera had been a frequent guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Walt Disney World, most recently appearing in the 2021 and 2022 seasons.

==Personal life==
On December 1, 1957, Rivera married fellow &quot;West Side Story&quot; dancer Tony Mordente. They were divorced in 1966. Rivera&#x27;s performance was so important for the success of the show that the London production of &quot;West Side Story&quot; was postponed until she gave birth to the couple&#x27;s daughter Lisa in 1958. Despite the divorce, Rivera and Mordente remained on good terms. 

Rivera was a Roman Catholic.

=== Death ===
Rivera died in New York following a brief illness on January 30, 2024, one week after her 91st birthday. Her ex-husband, Tony Mordente, died in June 2024, less than five months after Rivera&#x27;s death.

<text>Seymour () is a town located in the Southern end of the Goulburn Valley in the Shire of Mitchell, Victoria, Australia and is located north of Melbourne. At the , Seymour had a population of 6,569. The township services the surrounding agricultural industries (primarily equine, cattle, sheep and wine) as well as the nearby military base of Puckapunyal (population 1,176), which is an important training centre for the Australian Army. Other important sectors of employment in Seymour include retail, light engineering, agricultural services support, medical services, and education.

==History==
The Taungurung people are the traditional owners and inhabitants of the area Seymour now occupies. Specifically, it is the land of the Buthera Balug clan who occupied the area when Europeans first settled the region in the early 1800s. In 1824, Hume and Hovell on their return from Port Phillip, camped by the Goulburn River not far upstream of Seymour. In 1836 Major Thomas Mitchell crossed the Goulburn at Mitchellstown and soon afterwards overlanders and other early settlers began to use this crossing place on the Melbourne–Sydney route (now known as the Hume Highway). The mail service between Melbourne and Sydney had been operating for just a year when it was found that a better route was available using the &quot;New Crossing Place&quot;.

The Robert Burns Inn was operating there by the end of 1839. In 1841 the Government decided that the new crossing place was the likely spot for a town. Plans were laid before the Executive Council of NSW and Mitchell proposed the name Seymour which was approved on 21 December 1843. The town was named after Lord Seymour, the son of the 11th Duke of Somerset.
The Post Office opened on 1 July 1844. The railway arrived in 1872 along with substantial infrastructure to support it, establishing the town as an important rail hub for the Goulburn Valley, the Melbourne–Sydney railway and North Eastern Victoria. It was one of the first Victorian examples of the railway town phenomenon. In the heyday of the railway it employed 400 men and along with their families comprised one-third of the town population, or 1,500 people.
In 1871 the Shire of Seymour was established which also included the towns and localities of Avenel, Mangalore, Tallarook, Whiteheads Creek, Trawool, Hilldene and Northwood. It was proclaimed the Rural City of Seymour in 1993. In 1994, the Rural City of Seymour was abolished and incorporated into the Shire of Mitchell.

==Puckapunyal Army base==

The Australian Army first established a large training camp east of the township during the First World War. During the Second World War, the eastern camp diminished in importance and a substantially larger and more permanent military township was established to the west at Puckapunyal. , Puckapunyal is the centre for the Australian Army Knowledge Group (AKG) and Headquarters Land Combat College (HQ LCC) with two of the Army&#x27;s five Combat training establishments located on site. Additionally, there are smaller training centres, a large vehicle and armoured maintenance facility as well as the Road Transport Wing of the Army Logistic Training Centre&#x27;s Army School of Transport based in Puckapunyal. The base is also home to the Royal Australian Armoured Corps Memorial and Army Tank Museum. Access to the base and museum is restricted and all non-defence visitors must be escorted or obtain special permits for access.

==Wine==

Seymour is located at the southern end of the Goulburn Valley wine region. The main influencing factors in the Goulburn Valley wine region are the hills of the Great Dividing Range and the Goulburn River which mitigates lengthy and warm summers.

St Mary&#x27;s College is a Mercy affiliated school and staff and students are guided by the Mercy Values of justice, compassion, respect, hospitality, service and courage, as illustrated in the story of Catherine McAuley, the Founder of the Sisters of Mercy. 

The Seymour campus of the Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE, opened in 1998, provides a variety of short courses and vocational education and training.

==Transport==

Seymour is located adjacent to the junction of the Hume and Goulburn Valley Highway. The Hume Highway crossed the Goulburn River and diverted all Melbourne–Sydney bound traffic though the township for over 100 years until a freeway bypass was opened routing all non-local and interstate traffic around the township in 1982.

Seymour station is served by regular V/Line hourly services to and from Melbourne Southern Cross station as well as services on the Albury and Shepparton lines. The station was once a major freight marshalling location and the home of a significant locomotive depot.

<text>Juno was an American indie rock band formed in Seattle, Washington in 1995. They released two studio albums, disbanding in 2003.

== Career ==
Juno released their debut album &quot;This Is the Way It Goes and Goes and Goes&quot; as a co-release on DeSoto Records and Pacifico Records on March 30, 1999. Their second album &quot;A Future Lived in Past Tense&quot; was released May 8, 2001, on Desoto Records. The band toured throughout the US, Europe and Japan. They also released a split EP with The Dismemberment Plan on Desoto Records which included a cover of DJ Shadow&#x27;s &quot;High Noon&quot;.

The band is now officially defunct. Founding member Travis Saunders the bassist left the band in 2000. They had played with and auditioned a few different bassists (including Nate Mendel of Foo Fighters, Sunny Day Real Estate and Nick Harmer of Death Cab for Cutie), but ultimately decided that they were going in different directions artistically.

After the band&#x27;s breakup, some of its members formed Ghost Wars, a recording project led by Carstens and Eric Fisher.

Juno reunited to play two shows in Seattle on December 9 and 10 2006 for KEXP&#x27;s annual Yule Benefit.

<text>Roto, f. rota, (literally &quot;torn&quot; or &quot;broken&quot;) is a term used to refer to Chilean people and in particular to the common Chilean. In Chile, from the start of the 20th century, it was applied with a negative classist connotation to poor city-dwellers. It is also used contemptuously in other Spanish-speaking countries, especially Bolivia and Peru, to refer to Chileans in a derogatory manner. Otherwise, despite its defects, the roto is also considered a figure of national identity and pride in Chile.

==Historical usage==
The term &quot;roto&quot; has been used in Peru since the times of the Spanish conquest, when Diego de Almagro&#x27;s disappointed troops returned to Cuzco (after a failed gold-seeking expedition in Chile) with their torn clothes, due to the extensive and laborious passage on foot through the Atacama Desert. In the early days of Santiago its inhabitants were notoriously poorly dressed as result of a lack of food and supplies. Some Spanish came to dress with hides from dogs, cats, sea lions and foxes.

This term became more used after the Chilean campaigns against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation in 1836, when Chilean troops defeated the confederation at the Battle of Yungay on 20 January 1839. In Chile, tributes were paid to the victors of Yungay and, in a gesture of recognition, 20 January was declared the &quot;Día del Roto Chileno&quot; (Day of the Chilean Roto), and the War of the Pacific (1879–84).

The figure of the &quot;Chilean Roto&quot; is commemorated by very diverse organisations and actors such as the Chilean Army, ultra-nationalist activists, the Communist Party and local organisations of ordinary citizens. The Army has a particular appreciation to the figure which was regarded as the main hero –a collective and anonymous hero- of some of the most crucial battles in the war against Bolivia and Peru.
In this context, the webpage of the Chilean Army states:

<text>In railway engineering, &quot;gauge&quot; is the transverse distance between the inner surfaces of the heads of two rails, which for the vast majority of railway lines is the number of rails in place. However, it is sometimes necessary for track to carry railway vehicles with wheels matched to two different gauges. Such track is described as dual gauge – achieved either by addition of a third rail, if it will fit, or by two additional rails. Dual-gauge tracks are more expensive to configure with signals and sidings, and to maintain, than two separate single-gauge tracks. It is therefore usual to build dual-gauge or other multi-gauge tracks only when necessitated by lack of space or when tracks of two different gauges meet in marshalling yards or passenger stations. Dual-gauge tracks are by far the most common configuration, but triple-gauge tracks have been built in some situations.

==Background==
The rail gauge is the most fundamental specification of a railway. Rail tracks and wheelsets are built within engineering tolerances that allow optimum lateral movement of the wheelsets between the rails. Pairs of rails that become too wide or narrow in gauge will cause derailments, especially if in excess of normal gauge-widening on curves.

Given the requirement for gauge to be within very tight limits, when the designed distance between the pair of wheels on a wheelset differs even slightly from that of others on a railway, track must be built to two specific gauges. That is achieved in a variety of ways: most commonly by adding a third rail, more rarely by adding another pair of rails; and rarer still, when three gauges are present, by four rails.

==Configurations==


Dual-gauge track can consist of three rails, sharing one &quot;common&quot; rail; or four rails, with the rails of the narrower gauge lying between those of the broader gauge. In the three-rail configuration, wear and tear of the common rail is greater than with the two other outer rails. In dual gauge lines, turnouts (railroad switches) are more complex than in single-gauge track, and trains must be safely signalled on both of the gauges. Track circuits and mechanical interlocking must also operate on both gauges.

Multi-gauge track is very often associated with a break-of-gauge station, where rail vehicles or vehicle contents are transferred from one gauge to another. A break of gauge causes delay and increases congestion, especially on single-track lines. Essentially, two trains are required to do what a single train would normally accomplish. When traffic passes mainly in one direction, full wagons taken to the border have to be returned as empties, and a train of empty wagons has to be brought to the break of gauge from the other side to fetch the cargo. Congestion is also caused by unloading and reloading. The problem is worsened when there is a disparity between the capacity of locomotives and vehicles on the two gauges: typically, one broad-gauge trainload needs three narrow-gauge trains to carry.

===Three rails===
Constructing dual-gauge track with three rails is possible when the two adjacent rails can be separated at the base by at least the space required by rail fastening hardware such as spikes and or rail clips – typically . If the two gauges are closer than that, four rails must be used. Depending on the rail fasteners used and the weight of rails (heavy rails are bigger), the practicable difference between the two gauges is in the range to .


===Four rails===
In some places, the dimensions of two gauges needing to be collocated are too close to allow a three-rail configuration – for example:
* and (common in Africa, a legacy respectively of French/Belgian and British railway practice)
* and (common in South America)
* and (common where broad-gauge railways of former satellite states of the Soviet Union meet European or Chinese standard gauge).
In such cases, four rails are needed to provide the dual gauge.

Four rails might also be installed because of other engineering or operational factors, even though three rails would suffice: an example is on the Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme (Somme Bay railway), which combines standard and metre gauge – different, well within the parameters for three rails.

Four rails are necessary where the centre-line of rail vehicles on both tracks must be closely aligned with the centre-line of the track in tunnels or other constricted locations. Such configurations, when they revert back to standard parallel lines as soon as room is available, are termed &quot;gauntlet track&quot; (US: &quot;gantlet track&quot;).

Four rails must be placed identically on either side of the central axis of dual-gauge turntables (and six rails on triple-gauge turntables) so that they match the configuration of the fixed rails leading to and from the turntable, regardless of the direction in which the turntable is facing.


===Triple gauge===
In rare situations, three different gauges may converge on to a rail yard and triple-gauge track is needed to meet the operational needs of the break-of-gauge station – most commonly where there is insufficient space to do otherwise. Construction and operation of triple-gauge track and its signalling, however, involves immense cost and disruption, and is undertaken when no other alternative is available.


The following table shows localities where triple gauge has been necessary. 

===More than three gauges===
Three gauges are the maximum found on operating railway lines and in railway yards, but some rolling stock manufacturers collocate more than three lines in their works, depending on the particular gauges of their customers.

==Alternatives==


Transfer of freight and passengers between different gauges does not necessarily involve dual-gauge track: there may simply be two tracks that approach either side of a platform without overlapping. In Australia, 13 break-of-gauge stations existed by 1945 as a result of longstanding interstate rivalries: three different gauges had persisted since the 1850s and the five mainland state capitals were not linked by standard gauge until 1995. Huge costs and long delays were imposed by trans-shipment of freight at break-of-gauge stations, whether manually, by gantry crane or by wheelset or bogie exchange. During World War II, breaks of gauge in Australia added immense difficulty to the war effort by needing extra locomotives and rolling stock, and more than 1600 service personnel and a large pool of civilians, at transfer points for an annual average transfer of about 1.8 million tonnes of freight.

To cost and inefficiency was added, in the case of passengers, considerable inconvenience. In 1896, at Albury station on the Sydney–Melbourne railway, famed American writer Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) had to change trains in the middle of a &quot;biting-cold&quot; night in 1896 and there formed his pungent view of &quot;the paralysis of intellect that gave that idea birth&quot;.

In some locations, an alternative to building long lengths of dual-gauge track has been to change the wheels on rolling stock, either by dropping and changing wheelsets from four-wheeled vehicles or exchanging bogies (US: trucks) under eight-wheeled vehicles. With this arrangement, a short length of dual-gauge track is only needed within the facility. A benefit is that the contents of fully loaded cars are not disturbed. The scheme was first adopted on the French–Spanish border and in Poland. It introduces delay into transit times compared with dual-gauge operation, but is much quicker than trans-shipping: when introduced in 1962 in Melbourne, Australia, on the route between Sydney and Adelaide, the freight handling time per train dropped from five days to less than two. The process involved disconnecting the brake rigging and bogie centre pins have to be disconnected before the vehicle is lifted and new bogies are wheeled underneath.

In Europe, a similar principle embodies low-profile, small-wheeled transporter wagons, which carry vehicles built for one gauge on a line with a different gauge. A variant is the rollbock (Rollböcke in German), used under two-axle standard-gauge vehicles: each wheelset is carried on a small four-wheeled narrow-gauge trolley. The entire train is converted in minutes at a slow walking pace, each rollbock being automatically matched to its wheelset from underneath.

A further variant is &quot;train on train&quot;, in which an entire narrow-gauge train is carried on standard-gauge flatcars on which continuous rail has been fitted.

Differences in gauge are also accommodated by gauge-adjustable wheelsets, which were installed under some passenger vehicles on international links between Spain and France, Sweden and Finland, Poland and Lithuania, and Poland and Ukraine. In Spain, change-over facilities are extensive, since although track predominates, and high-speed lines are laid to standard gauge, there are many lines with narrower gauges ( metre gauge and others).

==Dual-gauge railways by nation==

;Australia
In Victoria, there are sections of and dual-gauge track between Southern Cross station and West Footscray, Sunshine and Newport, Albion and Jacana, North Geelong and Gheringhap, Maryborough and Dunolly, and in various goods yards and industrial sidings. Until 2008, there was a dual-gauge line between Wodonga and Bandiana.

At Albury railway station, New South Wales, a and dual-gauge line was in place until 2011. A dual-gauge line was within Tocumwal railway station until 1988, when the standard gauge component was put out of use.

In 1900, in South Australia, a three-rail dual-gauge system was proposed in order to avoid a break of gauge. However, designing turnouts was considered to be difficult due to the difference of only between the and the broad gauge. After twenty years, the proposal was abandoned. Much later, the South Australian Railways successfully adopted dual-gauge turnouts.

In Western Australia, and of double-track dual-gauge extends for of the main line from East Perth to Northam. Dual-gauge track is also used from the triangle at Woodbridge to Cockburn Junction, then to Kwinana on one branch and North Fremantle on the other. The signalling system detects the gauge of the approaching train and puts the signals to stop if the route is set for the wrong gauge.

In Queensland, there is a section of and dual-gauge track between the rail freight yards at Acacia Ridge and Park Road station, which is utilised by both passenger and freight trains. Freight trains to the Port of Brisbane utilise the dual gauge Fisherman Islands line that runs parallel to the Cleveland railway line from Park Road to Lindum. Passenger trains use the dual-gauge section of the Beenleigh railway line running parallel to the electric suburban narrow gauge of the Queensland Rail city network over the Merivale Bridge into platforms 2 and 3 at Roma Street Station. This is used by standard gauge interstate New South Wales TrainLink XPT services to Sydney. In 2012, a dual-gauge line was installed between Acacia Ridge and Bromelton to serve a new freight hub at Bromelton.

The long Inland Railway, under construction in 2022, will have about of dual gauge.

;Bangladesh
The Bangladesh Railway uses three rails to avoid breaks of gauge between its broad-gauge and metre-gauge lines. The Jamuna Bridge and Padma Bridge, which link the east–west and north–south rail systems respectively, have four-rail dual-gauge tracks. Of the Bangladesh Railway system, about has four-rail dual-gauge.

;Belgium
Tram tracks in Brussels once combined lines for inter-urban trams and lines for urban trams in a three-rail layout. In 1991, the interurban trams went out of service and then the network used only standard-gauge track.

;Bulgaria
The Sofia tramway uses a mixture of narrow and standard gauge. A section of track between Krasna polyana depot and Pirotska street is dual-gauge shared by route 22 and route 11.

;Cameroon
The new port of Kribi may serve 1000mm gauge bauxite traffic as well as 1435mm gauge iron ore traffic.

;Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, there is 2 km of dual gauge and track near Jindřichův Hradec. In 1985, its original four rails were converted to three rails. In 2004, in Jindřichův Hradec at a switch where a dual gauge railway bifurcates, a Junák express from Plzeň to Brno derailed due to a signalling error. The standard gauge train had been switched on to the narrow gauge track.

;France
The Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme in France is dual gauge between Noyelles-sur-Mer and Saint-Valery-sur-Somme. The line has four rails with metre gauge laid within standard gauge. There are some dual-gauge (standard and Iberian) sidings at Cerbère on the Spanish border.

;Germany
In the 1970s, the Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen tram lines underwent a gauge conversion from gauge to standard gauge. This was part of an upgrade to the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In 1981, and dual-gauge track was constructed so that new DT-8 Stadtbahn cars and old trams could share the network. In 2008, a further gauge conversion was completed. The Stuttgart Straßenbahn Museum operates gauge trams on weekends and special occasions.

In Krefeld on Ostwall, tram lines are dual gauge so that standard Rheinbahn U76 Stadtbahn cars and gauge trams may share the lines. At the north end of the route, at the junction with Rheinstraße, the trams reverse. There, the standard gauge line ends, while the metre gauge lines continue. At the Hauptbahnhof, on Oppumer Straße, dual gauge track continues. At the ends of Oppumer Straße, the two tracks diverge.

In Mülheim there is a similar situation. The Duisburg tram line 901 meets the local line 102. The tram system in Duisburg uses gauge track while the tram route from Witten to Mülheim uses gauge tracks. Two lines share a tunnel section between the Mülheim (Ruhr) Hauptbahnhof and Schloss Broich then diverge at street level.

The tram network between Werne to Bad Honnef is large with various operators and gauges. The trams in Wuppertal used gauge track on eastwest lines and gauge track on northsouth lines. Trams in Duisburg used gauge track on lines south of the Ruhr and gauge tracks on lines north of the Ruhr. The north lines closed in the 1960s and 1970s. Duisburg&#x27;s three routes were converted to gauge track.

;Ghana
Ghana is converting its narrow gauge to standard gauge, and is installing dual-gauge sleepers as an intermediate stage.

;Greece
In Greece, the line between Athens and Elefsis (now closed) was dual gauge in order to allow the gauge trains of the Peloponnese rail network to pass. It also allowed standard gauge trains to reach the Elefsis shipyards. In Volos, a short section of track between the main station and the harbour used an unusual triple gauge, to accommodate standard gauge trains from Larissa, metre gauge trains from Kalambaka, and the gauge trains of the Pelion railway.

;Indonesia
In 1899, in the Dutch East Indies, dual gauge track was installed between Yogyakarta and Solo. The track was owned by the Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij, a private company, which in 1867 had built the gauge line. The third rail was installed to allow passengers and goods travelling over the gauge &quot;Staatsspoorweg&quot; (state railway) a direct connection. At a later date, the government constructed new tracks to allow greater capacity and higher speeds. In 1940, a third rail was installed between Solo and Gundih on the line to Semarang, allowing gauge trains to travel between Semarang, Solo and Yogyakarta via Gambringan, on the line to Surabaya instead of on the original line via Kedungjati.

;Italy
The Potenza Avigliano Lucania line in Italy is a dual gauge rail with and tracks.

;Japan
In Japan, the national standard is narrow gauge. Dual gauge is used where the Shinkansen (bullet train) lines join the main network. For example, part of the Ōu Main Line became part of the Akita Shinkansen and was converted to dual gauge in a limited section. The longest () dual gauge section in Japan is near, and in, the Seikan Tunnel. Sections of the Hakone Tozan Line are among a number of other dual-gauge lines.

;Mexico
Mexico previously had and dual gauge track.

;Netherlands
The first railway lines in the Netherlands were constructed with a track gauge of . For the 1939 centennial celebration, an exact replica of the country&#x27;s first locomotive &quot;De Arend&quot; was built using the original blueprints.

Some dual-gauge sidings are at Port Bou on the French border. In 2009, Adif called for tenders for the installation of a third rail for standard-gauge trains on the between Castellbisbal and the Can Tunis freight terminal in Barcelona.

;Sweden
The bridges at the borders of Sweden and Finland, between Haparanda and Tornio have of dual gauge, and track. At each end of the dual-gauge section are yards with standard and Finnish gauge areas to allow for trans-shipment. Four rails are used because the gauges are close and the bridge structure is wider than normal to allow for the offset from the centreline of each gauge. A Rafil gauge changer is at the Tornio yard. 
Between Västervik and Jenny, Sweden, there is a and dual-gauge line and dual-gauge track in the Västervik station area.

;Switzerland
In Switzerland, dual-gauge track and track exists between Lucerne and Horw of the Zentralbahn, between Niederbipp and Oberbipp of the Oberaargau-Jura Railways and between Chur and Domat/Ems of RhB. All three allow narrow-gauge passenger trains and standard-gauge freight trains to operate. A ″non-stop″ scheme (albeit with a pause to change locomotives) on the Montreux-Interlaken route was inaugurated in December 2022. The former Zollikofen-Worblaufen-Deisswil dual gauge was cut back to Papiermühle when the factory in Deisswil closed.

;Ukraine
The railway tracks between the border with Slovakia at Solomonovo and the border with Romania at Nevetlenfolu are dual-gauge, and . This is in part due to the Austro-Hungarian heritage of the Zakarpattia Oblast, but also has military and political importance, as it allows standard-gauge trains to run between Romania and Slovakia by bypassing Hungary, otherwise impossible due to the break-of -gauge between the Russian-gauge network of Ukraine and standard-gauge networks of Romania and Slovakia.

;United Kingdom
The Great Western Railway in Britain was originally built to a broad gauge of 2134 mm (7 ft 0 in), subsequently widened to 2140 mm (7 ft 0 in). After a &quot;gauge war&quot;, the gauge was converted to . A dual-gauge system was easily installed as the gauges were well separated and the line had wooden sleepers. A short section of broad and standard gauge is at the Great Western Society site at Didcot.

The port authority in Derry, Northern Ireland, used a dual-gauge line in a street-level network to transfer freight. Two of the city&#x27;s stations were on a narrow gauge. The other two city stations were on broad gauge.

The Fairbourne Railway in Gwynedd, Wales, has a section of dual gauge track from Fairbourne station to Car Park crossing installed in the late 2010s to allow visiting gauge trains to run on part of the line, which was converted to gauge in 1986, usually as part of special events.

<doc id="901529" wikidata="Q2842707" url="?curid=901529" title="Blaine Amendment">
<text>The Blaine Amendment was a failed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would have prohibited direct government aid to educational institutions that have a religious affiliation. Most state constitutions already had such provisions, and thirty-eight of the fifty states have clauses that prohibit taxpayer funding of religious entities in their state constitutions.

The measures were designed to deny government aid to parochial schools, especially those operated by the Catholic Church in locations with large immigrant populations. They emerged from a growing consensus among 19th-century U.S. Protestants that public education must be free from &quot;sectarian&#x27; or &quot;denominational&#x27; control, while it also reflected nativist tendencies hostile to immigrants.

The amendments are generally seen as explicitly anti-Catholic because when they were enacted public schools typically included Protestant prayer, and taught from Protestant bibles, although debates about public funding of sectarian schools predate any significant Catholic immigration to the U.S. Thus, at the time of the Blaine amendments, public schools were not non-sectarian or non-denominational in the modern sense; nor were they completely secular.

==Text==
==Proposed federal amendment==
President Ulysses S. Grant (1869–77) in a speech in 1875 to a veterans&#x27; meeting, called for a Constitutional amendment that would mandate free public schools and prohibit the use of public money for sectarian schools. He was echoing nativist sentiments that were strong in his Republican Party.

Grant laid out his agenda for &quot;good common school education.&quot; He attacked government support for &quot;sectarian schools&quot; run by religious organizations, and called for the defense of public education &quot;unmixed with sectarian, pagan or atheistical dogmas.&quot; Grant declared that &quot;Church and State&quot; should be &quot;forever separate&quot;. &quot;Religion&quot;, he said, &quot;should be left to families, churches, and private schools devoid of public funds.&quot;

After Grant&#x27;s speech, Republican Congressman James G. Blaine proposed the amendment to the federal Constitution. Blaine, who actively sought Catholic votes when he ran for president in 1884, believed that possibility of hurtful agitation on the school question should be ended. In 1875, the proposed amendment passed by a vote of 180 to 7 in the House of Representatives, but failed by four votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote in the United States Senate. It never became federal law.

==Amendments to state constitutions==
Supporters of the proposal then turned their attention to state legislatures, where their efforts met with far greater success. Eventually, all but 12 states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and West Virginia) passed laws that meet the general criteria for designation as &quot;Blaine amendments&quot;, in that they ban the use of public funds to support sectarian private schools. Jonathan A. Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, explained in 2017 the purpose of the state constitutional Blaine amendments: &quot;These constitutional provisions serve significant government interests — leaving the support of churches to church members, while also protecting houses of worship against discrimination and interference from the government.&quot; In some states the provisions in question were included in newly drafted constitutions, rather than adopted as amendments to an existing constitution.

The state Blaine amendments remained in effect in thirty seven states until June 2020. In 2012, 56% of voters rejected a measure repealing Florida&#x27;s Blaine amendment. A 60% favorable margin was required for adoption. Voters have also rejected proposals to repeal their state-level Blaine amendments in New York (1967), Michigan (1970), Oregon (1972), Washington state (1975), Alaska (1976), Massachusetts (1986), and Oklahoma (2016).

On April 20, 1974, voters in Louisiana approved a new constitution by a margin of 58 to 42 percent, which repealed the Blaine amendment that was part of that state&#x27;s 1921 constitution. Louisiana&#x27;s current 1974 constitution replaced it with a copy of the federal First Amendment&#x27;s no-establishment and free exercise clauses, in Article 1, Sec. 8 of its Declaration of Rights; in Article 8, Sec. 13(a), it also guarantees the provision of free textbooks and &quot;materials of instruction&quot; to all children attending elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana.

Two other states, South Carolina and Utah, have also watered down their &quot;no-aid to religion&quot; constitutional clauses by removing from them the word &quot;indirect&quot;, leaving only a prohibition of direct aid or assistance to religious schools in these states.

On June 30, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in &quot;Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue&quot; that Montana&#x27;s no-aid provision in its constitution, a Blaine amendment, had been inappropriately used to block tax-credit scholarship funds for private schooling for being used at a religious school in violation of the Free Exercise Clause. The ruling effectively stated that if the state offered public scholarship funds for a private school, they could not discriminate against religious schools. As a result, it is expected that states that have similar programs with no-aid provisions in their constitutions will be forced to re-evaluate any program restrictions.

<text>Denali was an American indie rock band formed in April 2000 in Richmond, Virginia. The group disbanded in 2004 but reunited in 2008 for several performances.

==History==
The band was founded by Cam DiNunzio, Jonathan Fuller, Keeley Davis and Maura Davis. They recorded a five-song demo in January 2001, and signed with Jade Tree Records later that year.

Denali released their self-titled debut album in 2002. 

In August 2003, they released their second album &quot;The Instinct&quot;. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Jonathan Fuller and Keeley Davis left the band to focus their attention on Engine Down. Davis was replaced by Stephen Howard and Ryan Rapsys replaced Fuller. However, the new band configuration ultimately led to Denali breaking up in April 2004. In 2006, Lovitt Records released the DVD &quot;Pinnacle&quot;, featuring a concert from 2003.

In November 2004, Maura Davis, Ryan Rapsys, Stephen Howard and new member Matt Clark formed the band Bella Lea. They later changed their name to Ambulette. Maura &amp; Keeley reunited as band members in Glös. They released their debut album through Lovitt Records in 2007.

Denali performed a reunion show on July 5, 2008 at The National Theater in Richmond, Virginia. This was followed by two further shows in New York and Los Angeles in September. In June 2009, two additional shows were performed in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. A new song was played at these shows, listed online under the name &quot;Church Hill Bricks.&quot;

<text>Alice Mary Tait, (born 23 May 1986), née Alice Mary Mills, is an Australian former sprint freestyle, butterfly and individual medley swimmer who represented Australia at the 2004 Athens Olympics and the 2008 Beijing Olympics winning two relay gold medals and a bronze.

==Career==
Trained by her coach Shannon Rollason at the Chandler Sports Complex along with her good friend Jodie Henry, Tait was selected to make her international debut at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, at the age of 16, where she collected a gold in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, as well as competing in the finals of the 50 m freestyle and 200 m individual medley. She repeated this at the 2002 Pan Pacific Championships in Yokohama, Japan.

2003 saw a big improvement in Tait&#x27;s performance on the international swimming stage, when she received two silver medals at the 2003 World Swimming Championships in Barcelona, Spain in the 200 m individual medley and 50 m freestyle, breaking the Commonwealth record in the former and the Australian record in the latter. She also collected a silver and bronze in the 4 × 200 m and 4 × 100 m freestyle relays respectively.

2004 was a somewhat mixed year for Tait. She was beaten into 3rd place at the Australian trials in both the 50 m and 100 m freestyle, meaning that she was forced to watch these events from the stands. However, along with teammates Libby Lenton, Petria Thomas, and Jodie Henry, she won gold with a world record time in the women&#x27;s 4 × 100 metre relay; 3min 35.94s. Later, she performed much slower than her previous best in the 200 m individual medley, being eliminated in the final. She admitted that she had been distracted by the earlier relay triumph. She also picked up a gold by swimming in the heats for the victorious 4 × 100 m medley relay team.

Tait started 2005 by relocating to the Australian Institute of Sport along with Rollason and Henry. She started the year strongly, winning the 50 m and 100 m freestyle at the Australian championships, both in new personal best times, the former in Commonwealth record time. She also qualified in the 50 m butterfly in second place, and came third in the 100 m butterfly (but was not selected as each country is restricted to two entries, despite being ranked third in the world), all in new personal best times. However, she had a form slump at the 2005 World Swimming Championships in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, swimming much slower than at the selection trials, and missing the medals. She collected a gold medal as part of the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay team.

In 2006, Tait qualified and competed at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. She won bronze in the 50 m and 100 m freestyle behind Libby Lenton and Jodie Henry and in the 50 m butterfly behind Danni Miatke and Jessicah Schipper. She combined with Henry, Lenton and Shayne Reese to claim gold in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay.

In late 2006, Tait missed selection for the 2007 World Aquatics Championships. She was part of the bronze medal-winning Australian team in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

In the 2005 Australia Day Honours, Tait was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for &quot;service to sport as a Gold Medallist at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games&quot;.

Tait announced her retirement from sports in June 2012.

==Personal life==
Tait is married to the former Scottish Olympic swimmer Gregor Tait. Their first child, a boy named Vance Charlie Tait, was born in August 2015. In June 2018, they welcomed a second son, Miller Lee Tait.

<text>Lisbeth Constance Trickett, (; born 28 January 1985) is an Australian retired competitive swimmer. She was a gold medallist at the 2004, 2008, and the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was the world record holder in the short-course (25m) 100-metre freestyle.

==Personal life==
Trickett was educated at Somerville House. She married swimmer Luke Trickett among scenes of tight security at Taronga Zoo on Sydney Harbour on 7 April 2007. The couple entered via a &quot;walking tent&quot;, due to the exclusive photo deal the couple had with women&#x27;s magazine New Idea. The couple revealed later they split the photo profits between three charities. In March 2015, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child, due in September, after suffering a miscarriage in August 2014. She gave birth to a girl on 31 August 2015. Their second daughter was born on 23 February 2018.

She changed to swimming under her married name at the Australian 2008 Olympic selection trials.

On 9 September 2009, she announced that she would take an extended break from swimming and consider retirement. On 14 December 2009, she retired from competitive swimming at the age of 24. In September 2010, she announced that she would be returning to competition.

==Career==
Trickett emerged on the world scene in March 2003 at the Australian championships, by July she was a medal contender in multiple events at the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona.

At the 2003 World Championships, Trickett picked up her first individual medal on the international level in the 50-metre freestyle capturing the bronze medal, while placing 5th in the 100-metre freestyle, 14th in the 50-metre and 19th over the 100-metre butterfly, her individual inconsistency came to an end when she won another bronze in the 4×100-metre freestyle relay. Her fastest 100-metre freestyle sprint in which she set in the lead off leg in the relay would have captured herself another bronze in the individual 100-metre freestyle.

Trickett is currently employed by Megaport – an Australian dark fibre carrier – as a National Channel and Partner Manager.

==2004 Athens Olympics==
Trickett was also a bronze medalist in the 50-metre freestyle. She had previously been the holder of the 100-metre freestyle world record (53.66) set at the Olympic swimming trials held in Sydney, Australia on 31 March 2004, but lost this to teammate Jodie Henry (53.52) during the semi-finals of the event at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

==2005 World Aquatics Championships==

In July 2005, at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Canada, Trickett was one of the form swimmers of the meet. She won the 50-metre freestyle in a time of 24.59 to record her maiden championship at international level. She also achieved a silver medal in the 100-metre butterfly (57.37). She was a member of three relay teams, the 4×100-metre freestyle relay, 4×100-metre medley relay, and the 4×200-metre freestyle relay teams, winning gold (3:37.22), gold (3:57.47) and silver (7:54.00) in the respective events. Fairly new to the 200-metre freestyle event, Trickett got recorded the then fourth fastest time in history clocking 1:57.06 as lead-off swimmer in the final of the 4×200-metre freestyle relay. The time being more than 1.5 seconds faster than the individual gold medallist Solenne Figuès of France (1.58.60). Trickett did not compete in the individual 100-metre freestyle because she placed third in the event at the Australian championship, but her 100-metre freestyle split times were faster than the individual 100-metre freestyle gold medalist and world record holder Jodie Henry, which earned her the honour of swimming in the final of the medley relay. Despite not competing in the individual 100- and 200-metre freestyle, she did finish 2005 ranked number one in the world in both events.

On returning to Australia, Trickett continued her rich vein of form, lowering the 100-metre short course freestyle world record on consecutive nights at the Australian Short Course Championships to 51.70 seconds.

2005 brought a further world record in the short-course 200-metre freestyle at the Sydney, Australia stop of the 2005 FINA World Cup series on 19 November with Trickett recording a time of 1:53.29 to beat the previous record by 0.75 seconds.

However, Trickett regained her 100-metre freestyle world record on 31 January 2006 at the Australian Championships in Melbourne. Her time of 53.42 was 0.1 of a second faster than the previous record held by Henry. On 2 August 2006, German swimmer Britta Steffen broke Trickett&#x27;s 100-metre freestyle world record at the 2006 European Championships in Budapest, Hungary, with a time of 53.30. Trickett again regained the world record with a time of 52.88 on 27 March 2008 at the 100-metre finals of the Australian Olympic Trials.

==2006 Commonwealth Games==

At the 2006 Commonwealth Games, she won silver medals in the women&#x27;s 100-metre butterfly and 200-metre freestyle events. She defeated Henry to claim the 50-metre and 100-metre freestyle, and was a part of the winning 4×200-metre and 4×100-metre freestyle relay teams, as well as breaking the world record in the 4×100-metre medley relay, where her split of 52.87 seconds eclipsed the previous best by Henry. She took 5 of Australia&#x27;s 12 gold medals in the 2006 Short Course World Championships in Shanghai, being named the leading female swimmer of the meet.

In the latter part of 2006, Trickett won four titles at the Australian Short Course Nationals – both the 50-metre and 100-metre freestyle and butterfly events. More commonly known for her freestyle expertise, she set a new Australian and Commonwealth record in the 50-metre butterfly and a new world record for the 100-metre butterfly.

==2007 World Aquatics Championships==

On 26 March at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne, Trickett added another gold by winning the 100-metre butterfly in a championship record time – 57.15 seconds – touching the wall just 0.09 seconds ahead of her second-placed teammate Jessicah Schipper and American Natalie Coughlin. Then, on 1 April, she won another gold by nine one-hundredths of a second.

Shortly following the 2007 World Championships, on 3 April, at the biannual Duel in the Pool meet between Australia and the US swimming teams (in Sydney, Australia in 2007), she swam a 100-metre freestyle in 52.99, well under the existing world record of 53.30 by Germany&#x27;s Britta Steffen, and making her the first woman under 53 seconds in a long-course (50 m) pool. The time was not accepted by FINA as the world record, because the race the time was swum in is not, itself, a recognised FINA event according to the ruling.

Trickett went on to officially break the record in a time of 52.88 seconds on 27 March 2008 in the 100-metre finals of the Australian Olympic Trials. Two days later on 29 March 2008 she broke the world record for the 50-metre freestyle finals in the Australian Olympic Trials with a time of 23.97, taking 0.12 of a second off the previous record and being the first women to be under the 24-second barrier.

==2008 Beijing Olympics==

At the Beijing Olympics, Trickett&#x27;s first final was the 4×100-metre freestyle capturing a bronze medal, despite setting a new Australian record. Her next final was the 100-metre butterfly in which she captured Gold setting a new Australian record, making her the second fastest in that event in history. Trickett&#x27;s next event was the 100-metre freestyle, where she was the world record holder. Trickett was ahead of world record pace in the first 50-metre but was overtaken in the last few metres by rival Britta Steffen who captured the gold. Trickett later contested the 50-metre freestyle (another event she was the world record holder) but did not get on the podium finishing just outside the medals in fourth. In what seemed to be a terrible Olympics for Trickett, things finally turned when her last event was the 4×100-metre medley relay. In what was a competitive race at early on, turned in the Aussies favor down the stretch as they captured gold and a new world record.

After the Olympics Trickett split with Widmar, who had coached her from before she made her debut for Australia. Trickett said that she needed a change to rejuvenate her. She joined the Sopac Swim Club under Grant Stoelwinder in Sydney. Stoelwinder is a sprint coach and currently mentors Eamon Sullivan.

Trickett had a great start to the 2009 World Championships, capturing bronze in the 4×100-metre freestyle relay, setting an Australian record in the lead off. Her next individual performances were somewhat anticlimactic, in the 100-metre freestyle she finished with another bronze and finished 5th in the 50-metre freestyle. and the final night she anchored the medley relay to a silver.

===Retirement and comeback===
After retiring in December 2009, she announced her return to swimming in September 2010. At the 2012 Olympic Trials she narrowly missed a berth in the 100-metre butterfly finishing 3rd. Later on in the meet she finished 5th in the 100-metre freestyle, booking a spot on the 4×100-metre freestyle relay.

==2012 London Olympics==
Trickett raced in the heats of the 4×100-metre freestyle relay team. Because Australia went on to win gold in the final, setting a new Olympic record, she won the 4th Olympic gold medal of her career.

===Second retirement===
In 2013 Trickett retired again due to a wrist injury.

<text>Petria Ann Thomas, (born 25 August 1975) is an Australian swimmer and Olympic gold medallist and a winner of 15 national titles. She was born in Lismore, New South Wales, and grew up in the nearby town of Mullumbimby.

==Career==

In 1993, at the age of 17, Thomas won a bronze medal in the 200-metre butterfly at the World Short Course Championships. She followed this with two gold medals, in the 100-metre butterfly and 4×100-metre freestyle in the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada. However, she then struggled for two years, until making a comeback at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta in 1996. She won a silver medal, finishing second to fellow Australian Susie O&#x27;Neill.

Despite being plagued by a shoulder injury, Thomas repeated her 1994 Commonwealth Games effort at the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur. She also won a bronze in the 100-metre butterfly and a silver in the 200-metre at the World Championships in Perth, the same year. She had similar success at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney in 2000, winning three medals – bronze in the 200-metre butterfly, silver in the 4×100-metre medley, and silver in the 4×200-metre freestyle.

Thomas had always struggled to surpass O&#x27;Neill, despite being talented in her own right. However, after the 2000 games, O&#x27;Neill retired, and Thomas, despite battling recurring injuries, decided to continue. The decision paid off when she won three gold medals at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. She won both the 100-metre and 200-metre butterfly, and then was part of the winning 4×100-metre medley relay team. She was also part of the 4×200-metre freestyle relay team, which completed the race first, but they were disqualified when Thomas jumped in the pool to celebrate before the other competitors had completed the race.

At the 2002 Commonwealth Games, Thomas won five gold, one silver and one bronze medals. While being one of the pinnacles of her career, her victory also made her the first female swimmer ever to win the same event at three consecutive Commonwealth Games – the 100-metre butterfly. She followed this with three gold and two silver medals at the 2002 Pan Pacific Championships in Yokohama, Japan. At the short-course championships in Moscow, Russia, Thomas won another gold medal in her pet event, the 200-metre butterfly. However, injuries forced her out of competition soon afterwards, and she had to spend much of 2003 recovering from yet another shoulder reconstruction.

In 2004, Thomas made another comeback at the Olympic selection trials in Sydney while training with the Ginninderra Swimming Club. She broke the Commonwealth records in the 50-metre and 100-metre butterfly, set new personal best times in the 100-metre freestyle, 200-metre freestyle and narrowly missed the world record in the 200-metre butterfly.

After having missed out on first place in 1996 and 2000, Thomas finally achieved gold at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. She won the individual 100-metre butterfly, and was a part of two world record-setting teams in the 4×100-metre freestyle and 4×100-metre medley relays. She was subsequently chosen to carry the Australian flag at the closing ceremony. Thomas announced her retirement from competitive swimming at the conclusion of the games.

In mid-2005, Thomas released an autobiography, &quot;Swimming Against The Tide&quot;, in which she describes her career, including her experiences with depression and injuries.

She currently resides in Amaroo, Canberra, with her husband, Julian Jones, the head strength and conditioning coach at the AIS. They have two children. Thomas manages the Swimming Australia National Training Centre at the AIS.

She served as Chef de Mission of the Australian team at the 2022 Commonwealth Games held in Birmingham, England.
