<text>Chaddesden, also known locally as Chadd, is a large residential suburb of Derby, in the ceremonial county of Derbyshire, England. Historically a separate village centred on Chaddesden Hall and the 14th century St Mary&#x27;s Church, the area was significantly expanded by 20th-century housing developments, and became part of the then County Borough of Derby in 1968, prior to Derby&#x27;s city status in 1977.

==History==
There is evidence of Roman settlement such as Nottingham Road, a Roman road.

The old village, recorded in Domesday Book as &quot;Cedesene&quot;, is situated two and a half miles east of the city. In 1086 it was a manor in the possession of Henry de Ferrers and was worth the sum of three pounds.

The focal point of the village is probably the ancient church of St Mary&#x27;s. It is important as a dated example of church architecture before the advent of the perpendicular style. It was rebuilt by Henry Chaddesden, Archdeacon of Leicester, around 1357. The tall and spacious chancel running from its nave and aisle, dates from this period. Its west tower is perpendicular in style with its big west door and window. Restoration work on the chancel was carried out in 1857 by G. Place.

Chaddesden Hall and its estate were sold in 1918 by the Wilmot family. The estate was immediately divided up and re-sold to multiple purchasers, this process sometimes being repeated with the outcome being house building plots. Roe Farm, formerly at the west end of the parish, was acquired by Derby Corporation in 1930 and became the site of their largest pre-war housing estate. Other major developments in the 1930s were the shopping areas on Nottingham Road, and the Wood Road Estate (Rupert Road, Max Road etc.) from 1936.

==Government==
The area is covered by the Chaddesden ward of Derby City Council. The ward has three councillors, elected in successive years. Following the May 2019 elections, the ward has three Conservative councillors.

Chaddesden has been part of the Derby North parliamentary constituency since the seat&#x27;s creation in 1950.

Chaddesden was formerly a civil parish within Shardlow Rural District, on 1 April 1968 the parish was abolished and merged with Derby and Morley and became part of the then county borough of Derby. In 1961 the parish had a population of 15,622. It is now in the unparished area of Derby, in the Derby district.

== Geography ==
Chaddesden lies to the east of Derby city centre, with the A52 road forming its southern boundary. It is bordered by the wards of Spondon, Oakwood and Chaddesden West, with Erewash to the north. The Chaddesden Brook runs southwest through Chaddesden Park towards the River Derwent.

== Demography ==
The population at the 2011 census was 13,413, with 93.7% White British (compared to 75.3% for Derby as a whole).

== Economy ==
The area is primarily residential, with some retail development. Wyvern Retail Park has a Sainsbury&#x27;s superstore incorporating an Argos store, Homebase, Halfords, Boots, Carpetright, Next, Tapi, Home Bargains, Costa Drive-Thru and a 24 Hour McDonald&#x27;s. The Food Warehouse by Iceland opened in October 2020.

== Culture and community ==
Public facilities in Chaddesden include a public library, and a park. Chaddesden village centre has many amenities including a stores, restaurants, an estate agency, chemist, vets, travel agent, newsagent, hairdresser, optician, two public houses and a 29-bedroom hotel.

Chaddesden Wood and Lime Lane Wood have been designated a Local Nature Reserve.

== Landmarks ==
The Wilmot family lived at Chaddesden Hall, which was demolished in the 1920s when the Wilmot family sold its estate. The grounds are a well used park. The lodge and the entrance to the grave yard on Nottingham Road were designed by H. I. Stevens around 1854. The Wilmot family name still appears in the names of local businesses, including the Wilmot Service Station on Morley Road and their family crest on the former Wilmot Arms Public House (Now the Steaming Billy) at the junction of Morley Road, Chaddesden Lane and Wood Road.

== Transport ==
There is a bus service on Nottingham Road, and cycling Regional Route 66 passes through the area. Derby railway station is away.

== Education ==
Schools in Chaddesden include Lees Brook Community School (secondary school/college), Chaddesden Park Primary School, Cherrytree Hill Primary School, Meadowfarm School, Cavendish Close School and Roe Farm Primary School.

== Religious sites ==
St Mary&#x27;s Church was rebuilt by Henry Chaddesden, Archdeacon of Leicester, in approximately 1347; the chancel dates from this period. It has an ornate rood screen and an unusual chalice shaped font, believed to be over 600 years old. There are monuments to the Wilmot family who were local landlords. In the church yard is a small mound, where six almshouses used to stand. They had been founded by Robert Wilmot.

St. Mark&#x27;s Church on Francis Street was built in 1938 by Naylor &amp; Sale, and St. Philip&#x27;s Church on Taddington Road was built in 1955 by S.W. Milburn to service an ever-expanding population. The bell in St. Philip&#x27;s came from Derwent Woodlands church in Derwent village, which was &quot;drowned&quot; in the 1940s with the building of Ladybower Reservoir (near Bamford).

== Sport ==
There is a children&#x27;s play area in the park as well as facilities for sports like cricket and football. Lees Brook School is a specialist school of physical education, and also contains facilities for the children.

== Notable people ==

Colonel Sir Henry Wilmot received the VC for bravery. He was born and is buried here.

Sir Henry Fowler Railway Engineer, buried in the Nottingham Road Cemetery.

<doc id="894921" wikidata="Q422876" url="?curid=894921" title="Active cooling">
<text>Active cooling is a heat-reducing mechanism that is typically implemented in electronic devices and indoor buildings to ensure proper heat transfer and circulation from within.

Unlike its counterpart passive cooling, active cooling is entirely dependent on energy consumption in order to operate. It uses various mechanical systems that consume energy to dissipate heat. It is commonly implemented in systems that are unable to maintain their temperature through passive means. Active cooling systems are usually powered through the use of electricity or thermal energy but it&#x27;s possible for some systems to be powered by solar energy or even hydroelectric energy. They need to be well-maintained and sustainable in order for them to perform its necessary tasks or the possibility of damages within objects could occur. Various applications of commercial active cooling systems include indoor air conditioners, computer fans, and heat pumps.

== Building usage ==
Many buildings require high demands in cooling and as many as 27 out of the 50 largest metropolitan areas around the world are located in areas of hot or tropical weather. With this, engineers have to establish the heat balance in order to ensure proper ventilation throughout the structure.

The heat balance equation is given as:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the air density, formula_3 is the specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure, formula_4 is the rate of heat transfer, formula_5 is the internal heat gains, formula_6 is the heat transfer through the envelope, formula_7 is the heat gain/loss between indoor and outdoor air, and formula_8 is the mechanical heat transfer.

Using this, it can be determined how much cooling is required within the infrastructure.

There are three active cooling systems commonly used in the residential sectors:

=== Fans ===
A fan is three to four blades rotated by an electrical motor at a constant speed. Throughout the rotation, airflow is produced and having the surrounding being cooled through the process of forced convection heat transfer. Because of its relatively low price, it is the most frequently used out of the three active cooling systems in the residential sector.

=== Heat pumps ===
A heat pump utilizes electricity in order to extract heat from a cool area into a warm area, causing the cool area to lower in temperature and the warm area to increase in temperature.

There are two types of heat pumps:

==== Compression heat pumps ====
Being the more popular variant of the two, compression heat pumps operates through the use of the refrigerant cycle. The vapor refrigerant in the air gets compressed while increasing in temperature, creating a superheated vapor. The vapor then goes through a condenser and converts into a liquid form, dispelling more heat in the process. Traveling through the expansion valve, the liquid refrigerant forms a mixture of liquid and vapor. As it passes through the evaporator, vapor refrigerant forms and expels into the air, repeating the refrigerant cycle.

==== Absorption heat pumps ====
The process for the absorption heat pump works similarly to the compression variant with the main contrast being the usage of an absorber instead of a compressor. The absorber takes in the vapor refrigerant and creates a liquid form which then travels into the liquid pump to be turned into superheated vapor. The absorption heat pump utilizes both electric and heat for its functionality compared to compression heat pumps which only uses electricity.

=== Evaporative coolers ===
An evaporative cooler absorbs the outside air and passes it through water-saturated pads, lowering the temperature of the air through water evaporation.

It can be divided by:

==== Direct ====
This method evaporates the water which would then travel directly into the air stream, producing a small form of humidity. It usually requires a decent amount of water consumption in order to properly lower the temperature of the surrounding area.

==== Indirect ====
This method evaporates the water into a second air stream and then putting it through a heat exchanger, lowering the temperature of the main air stream without adding any humidity. Compared to direct evaporative coolers, it requires much less water consumption to operate and lowering temperature.

== Electronic device cooling ==
== Other applications ==
Besides normal commercial usage of active cooling, researchers are also looking for ways to improve the implementation of active cooling into various technologies.

=== Thermoelectric Generator(TEG) ===
The thermoelectric generator, or TEG, is a power source that has been recently experimented with to test its viability in maintaining active cooling. It is a device that makes use of the Seebeck effect to convert heat energy into electrical energy. Applications of the power source are more commonly found in technologies requiring high power. Examples include space probes, aircraft, and automobiles.

In a 2019 research, the viability of TEG active cooling was tested. The test was applied on a Raspberry PI3, a small single-board computer, equipped with a fan powered by TEG and was compared alongside another powered by a commercial passive cooler. Throughout the research, the voltage, the power, and the temperature in both of the Raspberry PIs were observed and recorded. The data showed that throughout the benchmark test, the TEG- powered Raspberry PI3 stabilized to a temperature a few Celsius lower than the passive cooling Raspberry PI3. The power produced by the TEG was also analyzed to measure the possibility of the fan having self-sustainable capabilities. Currently, using only TEG to power the fan isn&#x27;t enough to be completely self-sustainable because it lacks enough energy for the initial startup of the fan. But, with the implementation of an energy accumulator, it would be possible.

The power generation of TEG is given as:

formula_9

where formula_10 is the power generated by TEG, formula_11 is the thermal resistance, and formula_12 is the temperature from TEG.

Based on the result, the thermoelectric generator active cooling has been shown to effectively decrease and maintain temperatures that is comparable to commercial usage of passive coolers.

=== Near Immersion Active Cooling (NIAC) ===

Near Immersion Active Cooling, or NIAC, is a thermal management technique that has been recently researched in an effort to reduce the amount of heat accumulation generated by Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing, or WAAM (a metal 3-D printing technology). NIAC utilizes a cooling liquid that surrounds the WAAM within a work tank and increases the water level when metal is being deposited. The direct contact with the liquid allows for quick withdrawal of heat from the WAAM, decreasing temperature by a significant amount.

In a 2020 experiment, researchers wanted to discover the feasibility of using the NIAC and to test its cooling capabilities. The experiment compared the effectiveness of mitigating temperature generated by the WAAM between natural cooling, passive cooling, and near immersion active cooling. Natural cooling used air, passive cooling used a cooling liquid that stays on a fixed level, and NIAC used a cooling liquid that rises based on the actions of the WAAM.

The following tests were used to measure the feasibility of using NIAC:
* Thermal analysis: In the thermal analysis, there was a significant disparity of heat between NIAC and the other cooling types, with NIAC cooling the technology at a much faster rate.
* Geometric quality: For the geometric quality of the walls, NIAC had the slimmest and tallest wall which shows tough durability of the WAAM when using active cooling.
* Porosity assessment: The porosity assessment showed that active cooling contained the lowest porosity level. A high porosity level has adverse effects on mechanical properties, such as limited ductility.
* Mechanical properties: NIAC tends to equalize the mechanical properties, especially ductility, in contrast to both natural and passive cooling.

They concluded NIAC is viable and comparable to conventional cooling methods such as passive and natural cooling.

== Comparison with passive cooling ==
Active cooling is usually compared alongside passive cooling in various situations to determine which provides a better and more efficient way of cooling. Both of these are viable in many situations but depending on several factors, one could be more advantageous than the other.

=== Advantages ===
Active cooling systems are usually better in terms of decreasing temperature than passive cooling systems. Passive cooling doesn&#x27;t utilize much energy for its operation but instead takes advantage of natural cooling, which takes longer to cool over a long period of time. Most people prefer the use of active cooling systems in hot or tropical climates than passive cooling because of its effectiveness in lowering temperature in a short time interval. In technologies, it helps maintain proper thermal conditions, preventing the risk of damages or overheating of the core operation systems. It is able to better balance out the heat generation from the technology, maintaining it in a consistent manner. Some active cooling systems also contain the possibility of being self-sustainable as shown in the application of the thermoelectric generator compared to passive cooling where it is highly dependent on natural means to operate.

=== Disadvantages ===
The issues with active cooling compared to passive cooling are mainly the financial costs and energy consumption. Because of active cooling&#x27;s high energy requirement, it makes it much less energy efficient as well as less cost efficient. In a residential setting, active cooling usually consumes a large amount of energy in order to provide enough cooling throughout the entire building which increases the financial costs. Engineers of the building would need to take in account that an increase in energy consumption would also play a factor in negatively affecting the global climate. Compared to active cooling, passive cooling are more seen being used in places with average or low temperatures.

ISO/IEC 15504 was initially derived from process lifecycle standard ISO/IEC 12207 and from maturity models like Bootstrap, Trillium and the Capability Maturity Model (CMM).

ISO/IEC 15504 has been superseded by &quot;ISO/IEC 33001:2015 Information technology – Process assessment – Concepts and terminology&quot; as of March, 2015.

==Overview==
ISO/IEC 15504 is the reference model for the maturity models (consisting of capability levels which in turn consist of the process attributes and further consist of generic practices) against which the assessors can place the evidence that they collect during their assessment, so that the assessors can give an overall determination of the organization&#x27;s capabilities for delivering products (software, systems, and IT services).&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO/IEC 15504-2 Clause 5&quot;&gt;ISO/IEC 15504-2 Clause 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A working group was formed in 1993 to draft the international standard and used the acronym SPICE. SPICE initially stood for &quot;Software Process Improvement and Capability Evaluation&quot;, but in consideration of French concerns over the meaning of &quot;evaluation&quot;, SPICE has now been renamed &quot;Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination&quot;. SPICE is still used for the user group of the standard, and the title for the annual conference. The first SPICE was held in Limerick, Ireland in 2000, &quot;SPICE 2003&quot; was hosted by ESA in the Netherlands, &quot;SPICE 2004&quot; was hosted in Portugal, &quot;SPICE 2005&quot; in Austria, &quot;SPICE 2006&quot; in Luxembourg, &quot;SPICE 2007&quot; in South Korea, &quot;SPICE 2008&quot; in Nuremberg, Germany and &quot;SPICE 2009&quot; in Helsinki, Finland.

The first versions of the standard focused exclusively on software development processes. This was expanded to cover all related processes in a software business, for example project management, configuration management, quality assurance, and so on. The list of processes covered grew to cover six areas: organizational, management, engineering, acquisition supply, support, and operations.

In a major revision to the draft standard in 2004, the process reference model was removed and is now related to the ISO/IEC 12207 (Software Lifecycle Processes). The issued standard now specifies the measurement framework and can use different process reference models. There are five general and industry models in use.

Part 5 specifies software process assessment and part 6 specifies system process assessment.

The latest work in the ISO standards working group includes creation of a maturity model, which is planned to become ISO/IEC 15504 part 7.

==The standard==

The Technical Report (TR) document for ISO/IEC TR 15504 was divided into 9 parts. The initial International Standard was recreated in 5 parts. This was proposed from Japan when the TRs were published at 1997.

The International Standard (IS) version of ISO/IEC 15504 now comprises 6 parts. The 7th part is currently in an advanced Final Draft Standard form and work has started on part 8.

&quot;Part 1&quot; of ISO/IEC TR 15504 explains the concepts and gives an overview of the framework.

===Reference model===
ISO/IEC 15504 contains a &quot;reference model&quot;. The reference model defines a &quot;process dimension&quot; and a &quot;capability dimension&quot;.

The process dimension in the reference model is not the subject of &quot;part 2&quot; of ISO/IEC 15504, but part 2 refers to external process lifecycle standards including ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288. The standard defines means to verify conformity of reference models.

====Processes====
The &quot;process dimension&quot; defines processes divided into the five process categories of:
* customer-supplier
* engineering
* supporting
* management
* organization
With new parts being published, the process categories will expand, particularly for IT service process categories and enterprise process categories.

====Capability levels and process attributes====
For each process, ISO/IEC 15504 defines a &quot;capability level&quot; on the following scale:
The capability of processes is measured using process attributes. The international standard defines nine process attributes: 
* 1.1 Process performance
* 2.1 Performance management
* 2.2 Work product management
* 3.1 Process definition
* 3.2 Process deployment
* 4.1 Process measurement
* 4.2 Process control
* 5.1 Process innovation
* 5.2 Process optimization

Each process attribute consists of one or more generic practices, which are further elaborated into practice indicators to aid assessment performance.

====Rating scale of process attributes====
Each process attribute is assessed on a four-point (N-P-L-F) rating scale: 
* Not achieved (0–15%)
* Partially achieved (&gt;15–50%)
* Largely achieved (&gt;50–85%)
* Fully achieved (&gt;85–100%).

The rating is based upon evidence collected against the practice indicators, which demonstrate fulfillment of the process attribute.

===Assessments===
ISO/IEC 15504 provides a guide for &quot;performing an assessment&quot;.

This includes:
* the assessment process
* the model for the assessment
* any tools used in the assessment

====Assessment process====
Performing assessments is the subject of &quot;parts 2 and 3&quot; of ISO/IEC 15504. Part 2 is the normative part and part 3 gives a guidance to fulfill the requirements in part 2.

One of the requirements is to use a conformant assessment method for the assessment process. The actual method is not specified in the standard although the standard places requirements on the method, method developers and assessors using the method. The standard provides general guidance to assessors and this must be supplemented by undergoing formal training and detailed guidance during initial assessments.

The assessment process can be generalized as the following steps:
* initiate an assessment (assessment sponsor)
* select assessor and assessment team
* plan the assessment, including processes and organizational unit to be assessed (lead assessor and assessment team)
* pre-assessment briefing
* data collection
* data validation
* process rating
* reporting the assessment result

An assessor can collect data on a process by various means, including interviews with persons performing the process, collecting documents and quality records, and collecting statistical process data. The assessor validates this data to ensure it is accurate and completely covers the assessment scope. The assessor assesses this data (using his expert judgment) against a process&#x27;s base practices and the capability dimension&#x27;s generic practices in the process rating step. Process rating requires some exercising of expert judgment on the part of the assessor and this is the reason that there are requirements on assessor qualifications and competency. The process rating is then presented as a preliminary finding to the sponsor (and preferably also to the persons assessed) to ensure that they agree that the assessment is accurate. In a few cases, there may be feedback requiring further assessment before a final process rating is made.

====Assessment model====
The &quot;process assessment model (PAM)&quot; is the detailed model used for an actual assessment. This is an elaboration of the process reference model (PRM) provided by the process lifecycle standards.

The process assessment model (PAM) in part 5 is based on the process reference model (PRM) for software: ISO/IEC 12207.

The process assessment model in part 6 is based on the process reference model for systems: ISO/IEC 15288.

The standard allows other models to be used instead, if they meet ISO/IEC 15504&#x27;s criteria, which include a defined community of interest and meeting the requirements for content (i.e. process purpose, process outcomes and assessment indicators).

====Tools used in the assessment====
There exist several assessment tools. The simplest comprise paper-based tools. In general, they are laid out to incorporate the assessment model indicators, including the base practice indicators and generic practice indicators. Assessors write down the assessment results and notes supporting the assessment judgment.

There are a limited number of computer based tools that present the indicators and allow users to enter the assessment judgment and notes in formatted screens, as well as automate the collated assessment result (i.e. the process attribute ratings) and creating reports.

===Assessor qualifications and competency===
For a successful assessment, the &quot;assessor&quot; must have a suitable level of the relevant skills and experience.

These skills include:
* personal qualities such as communication skills.
* relevant education and training and experience.
* specific skills for particular categories, e.g. management skills for the management category.
* ISO/IEC 15504 related training and experience in process capability assessments.

The competency of assessors is the subject of &quot;part 3&quot; of ISO/IEC 15504.

In summary, the ISO/IEC 15504 specific training and experience for assessors comprise:
* completion of a 5-day lead assessor training course
* performing at least one assessment successfully under supervision of a competent lead assessor
* performing at least one assessment successfully as a lead assessor under the supervision of a competent lead assessor. The competent lead assessor defines when the assessment is successfully performed. There exist schemes for certifying assessors and guiding lead assessors in making this judgement.

===Uses===
ISO/IEC 15504 can be used in two &quot;contexts&quot;:
* Process improvement, and
* Capability determination (=evaluation of supplier&#x27;s process capability).

====Process improvement====
ISO/IEC 15504 can be used to perform process improvement within a technology organization. Process improvement is always difficult, and initiatives often fail, so it is important to understand the initial baseline level (process capability level), and to assess the situation after an improvement project. ISO 15504 provides a standard for assessing the organization&#x27;s capacity to deliver at each of these stages.

In particular, the reference framework of ISO/IEC 15504 provides a structure for defining objectives, which facilitates specific programs to achieve these objectives.

Process improvement is the subject of &quot;part 4&quot; of ISO/IEC 15504. It specifies requirements for improvement programmes and provides guidance on planning and executing improvements, including a description of an eight step improvement programme. Following this improvement programme is not mandatory and several alternative improvement programmes exist.

====Capability determination====
An organization considering outsourcing software development needs to have a good understanding of the capability of potential suppliers to deliver.

ISO/IEC 15504 (Part 4) can also be used to inform supplier selection decisions. The ISO/IEC 15504 framework provides a framework for assessing proposed suppliers, as assessed either by the organization itself, or by an independent assessor.

The organization can determine a &quot;target capability&quot; for &quot;suppliers&quot;, based on the organization&#x27;s needs, and then assess suppliers against a set of target process profiles that specify this target capability. Part 4 of the ISO/IEC 15504 specifies the high level requirements and an initiative has been started to create an extended part of the standard covering target process profiles. Target process profiles are particularly important in contexts where the organization (for example, a government department) is required to accept the cheapest &quot;qualifying&quot; vendor. This also enables suppliers to identify gaps between their current capability and the level required by a potential customer, and to undertake improvement to achieve the contract requirements (i.e. become qualified). Work on extending the value of capability determination includes a method called Practical Process Profiles - which uses risk as the determining factor in setting target process profiles. Combining risk and processes promotes improvement with active risk reduction, hence reducing the likelihood of problems occurring.

==Acceptance of ISO/IEC 15504==
ISO/IEC 15504 has been successful as:
* ISO/IEC 15504 is available through National Standards Bodies.
* It has the support of the international community.
* Over 4,000 assessments have been performed to date.
* Major sectors are leading the pace such as automotive, space and medical systems with industry relevant variants.
* Domain-specific models like &quot;Automotive SPICE&quot; and &quot;SPICE 4 SPACE&quot; can be derived from it.
* There have been many international initiatives to support take-up such as SPICE for small and very small entities.

On the other hand, ISO/IEC 15504 may not be as popular as CMMI for the following reasons:

* ISO/IEC 15504 is not available as free download, but must be purchased from the ISO. (Automotive SPICE, on the other hand, can be freely downloaded from the link supplied below.) CMM, and later CMMI, were originally available as free downloads from the SEI website. However, beginning with CMMI v2.0 a license must now be purchased from SEI.
* The CMM, and later CMMI, were originally sponsored by the US Department of Defense (DoD). Now, however, DoD no longer funds CMMI or mandates its use.
* The CMM was created first, and reached critical &#x27;market&#x27; share before ISO 15504 became available.
* The CMM has subsequently been replaced by the CMMI, which incorporates many of the ideas of ISO/IEC 15504, but also retains the benefits of the CMM.

Like the CMM, ISO/IEC 15504 was created in a development context, making it difficult to apply in a service management context. But work has started to develop an ISO/IEC 20000-based process reference model (ISO/IEC 20000-4) that can serve as a basis for a process assessment model. This is planned to become part 8 to the standard (ISO/IEC 15504-8). In addition there are methods available that adapt its use to various contexts.

<doc id="894935" wikidata="Q2577838" url="?curid=894935" title="William Allen White">
<text>William Allen White (February 10, 1868 – January 29, 1944) was an American newspaper editor, politician, author, and leader of the Progressive movement. Between 1896 and his death, White became a spokesman for middle America.

At a 1937 banquet held in his honor by the Kansas Editorial Association, he was called &quot;the most loved and most distinguished member&quot; of the Kansas press.

==Early life==
White was born in Emporia, Kansas and moved to El Dorado, Kansas, with his parents, Allen and Mary Ann Hatten White, where he spent the majority of his childhood. He loved animals and reading books. He attended the College of Emporia and the University of Kansas, and in 1889 started work at &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; as an editorial writer.

==&quot;The Emporia Gazette&quot;==
In 1895, White bought the &quot;Emporia Gazette&quot; for $3,000 from William Yoast Morgan and became its editor.

===What&#x27;s the matter with Kansas? – 1896===
White was a political conservative at this early stage of his career. In 1896 a White editorial titled &quot;&quot; attracted national attention with a scathing attack on William Jennings Bryan, the Democrats, and the Populists. White sharply ridiculed Populist leaders for letting Kansas slip into economic stagnation and not keeping up economically with neighboring states because their anti-business policies frightened away economic capital from the state. White wrote:

&quot;There are two ideas of government,&quot; said our noble Bryan at Chicago. &quot;There are those who believe that if you legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, this prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class and rest upon them.&quot; That&#x27;s the stuff! Give the prosperous man the dickens! Legislate the thriftless man into ease, whack the stuffing out of the creditors and tell the debtors who borrowed the money five years ago when money &quot;per capita&quot; was greater than it is now, that the contraction of currency gives him a right to repudiate.

The Republicans sent out hundreds of thousands of copies of the editorial in support of William McKinley during the intensely fought presidential election of 1896, providing White with national exposure.
With his warm sense of humor, articulate editorial pen, and uncommon sense approach to life, White soon became known throughout the country. His &quot;Gazette&quot; editorials were widely reprinted; he wrote stories on politics syndicated by the George Matthew Adams Service; and he published many books, including biographies of Woodrow Wilson and Calvin Coolidge. &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter With Kansas?&quot; and &quot;Mary White&quot; (a tribute to his 16-year-old daughter on her death in 1921) were his best-known writings. Locally he was known as the greatest booster for Emporia.

He won a 1923 Pulitzer Prize for his editorial &quot;&quot;, published July 27, 1922, after being arrested in a dispute over free speech following objections to the way the state of Kansas handled the men who participated in the Great Railroad Strike of 1922.

===Small-town ideals===
In his novels and short stories, White developed his idea of the small town as a metaphor for understanding social change and for preaching the necessity of community. While he expressed his views in terms of the small town, he tailored his rhetoric to the needs and values of emerging urban America. The cynicism of the post-World War I world stilled his imaginary literature, but for the remainder of his life he continued to propagate his vision of small-town community. He opposed chain stores and mail order firms as a threat to the business owner on Main Street. The Great Depression shook his faith in a cooperative, selfless, middle-class America. Like most old Progressives his attitude toward the New Deal was ambivalent: President Franklin D. Roosevelt cared for the country and was personally attractive, but White considered his solutions haphazard. White saw the country uniting behind old ideals by 1940, in the face of foreign threats.

====Fighting corruption====
White sought to encourage a viable moral order that would provide the nation with a sense of community. He recognized the powerful forces of corruption but called for slow, remedial change having its origin in the middle class. In his novel &quot;In the Heart of a Fool&quot; (1918), White fully developed the idea that reform remained the soundest ally of property rights. He felt that the Spanish–American War fostered political unity, and believed that a moral victory and an advance in civilization would be compensation for the devastation of World War I. White concluded that democracy in the New Era inevitably lacked direction, and the New Deal found him a baffled spectator. Nevertheless, he clung to his vision of a cooperative society until his death in 1944.

==Politics==

White became a leader of the Progressive movement in Kansas, forming the Kansas Republican League in 1912 to oppose railroads. White helped Theodore Roosevelt form the Progressive (Bull-Moose) Party in the 1912 presidential election in opposition to the conservative forces surrounding incumbent Republican president William Howard Taft.

White was a reporter at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and a strong supporter of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s proposal for the League of Nations. The League went into operation but the U.S. never joined. During the 1920s, White was critical of both the isolationism and the conservatism of the Republican Party.

According to Roger Bresnahan:

White&#x27;s finest hour came in his vigorous assault, beginning with &quot;Gazette&quot; editorials in 1921, on the Ku Klux Klan – a crusade that led him to run for governor of Kansas in 1924 so that his anti-Klan message would reach a broader state and national audience. As expected, White did not win the election, but he was widely credited with deflating Klan intentions in Kansas.

In the 1928 presidential election, he condemned the Democratic nominee Al Smith as the candidate of &quot;the saloon, prostitution, and gambling&quot; for Smith&#x27;s opposition to Prohibition. He was an early supporter of Republican presidential nominees Alf Landon of Kansas in 1936 and Wendell Willkie in 1940. However, White was on the liberal wing of the Republican Party and wrote many editorials praising the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

==Sponsoring painter John Steuart Curry==
White was the leader in persuading Kansas newspaper editors and publishers to run a fund-raising campaign so as to invite Kansas&#x27;s most famous artist, John Steuart Curry, to paint murals for Kansas. He got the support of Governor Walter Huxman and other politicians, and the result was the prestigious invitation to paint murals for the Kansas Capitol. The result was &quot;Tragic Prelude&quot;. 

==Sage of Emporia==
The last quarter century of White&#x27;s life was spent as an unofficial national spokesman for Middle America. This led President Franklin Roosevelt to ask White to help generate public support for the Allies before America&#x27;s entry into World War II. In 1940 White was fundamental in the formation of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, sometimes known as the White Committee. He resigned on January 3, 1941, writing to a newspaper columnist that &quot;In our New York and Washington chapters we have a bunch of war mongers and under our organization we have no way to oust them and I just can&#x27;t remain at the head of an organization that is being used by those chapters to ghost dance for war.&quot;

Sometimes referred to as the Sage of Emporia, he continued to write editorials for the &quot;Gazette&quot; until his death in 1944. He was also a founding editor of the Book of the Month Club, along with longtime friend Dorothy Canfield.

==Family==
White married Sallie Lindsay in 1893. They had two children, William Lindsay, born in 1900, and Mary Katherine, born in 1904. Mary died in a 1921 horse-riding accident, prompting her father to publish a famous eulogy, &quot;Mary White,&quot; on May 17, 1921.

White visited six of the seven continents at least once in his long life. Due to his fame and success, he received 10 honorary degrees from universities, including one from Harvard.

White taught his son William L. the importance of journalism, and after his death, William L. took charge of the &quot;Gazette&quot; and continued its local success; after he died, his wife Kathrine ran it. Their daughter Barbara and her husband, David Walker, took it over much as William had earlier, and today the paper remains family-run, currently headed by William Allen White&#x27;s great-grandson, Christopher White Walker.

==White and the two Roosevelts==
White developed a friendship with President Theodore Roosevelt in the 1890s that lasted until Roosevelt&#x27;s death in 1919. Roosevelt spent several nights at White&#x27;s Wight and Wight-designed home, Red Rocks, during trips across the United States. White was to say later, &quot;Roosevelt bit me and I went mad.&quot; Later, White supported much of the New Deal, but voted against Franklin D. Roosevelt every time.

==Posthumous honors==

&quot;Life&quot; described White:

The city of Emporia raised $25,000 in war bonds during World War II and were granted naming rights for a B-29 bomber in early 1945. They unsurprisingly chose to name it after their most famous citizen, William Allen White. This bomber was sent with a crew of men to the island of Tinian in the South Pacific and was part of the same bomber squadron that the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; was in.

During World War II, the &quot;William Allen White&quot; Liberty ship was launched from Richmond, California on May 8, 1944.

His autobiography, which was published posthumously in 1946, won the 1947 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.

In 1948 a 3¢ stamp was issued in his honor by the U.S. Postal Service.

The University of Kansas Journalism School is named for him, as is the library building at Emporia State University. There are also two awards the William Allen White Foundation has created: the William Allen White Award for outstanding journalistic merit and the Children&#x27;s Book Award.

The town of Emporia honors him to this day with city limits signs on I-35, US-50, and K-99 announcing &quot;Home of William Allen White.&quot;

<doc id="894938" wikidata="Q46825" url="?curid=894938" title="Gothic art">
<text>Gothic art was a style of medieval art that developed in Northern France out of Romanesque art in the 12th century, led by the concurrent development of Gothic architecture. It spread to all of Western Europe, and much of Northern, Southern and Central Europe, never quite effacing more classical styles in Italy. In the late 14th century, the sophisticated court style of International Gothic developed, which continued to evolve until the late 15th century. In many areas, especially Germany, Late Gothic art continued well into the 16th century, before being subsumed into Renaissance art. Primary media in the Gothic period included sculpture, panel painting, stained glass, fresco and illuminated manuscripts. The easily recognisable shifts in architecture from Romanesque to Gothic, and Gothic to Renaissance styles, are typically used to define the periods in art in all media, although in many ways figurative art developed at a different pace.
The earliest Gothic art was monumental sculpture, on the walls of Cathedrals and abbeys. Christian art was often typological in nature (see Medieval allegory), showing the stories of the New Testament and the Old Testament side by side. Saints&#x27; lives were often depicted. Images of the Virgin Mary changed from the Byzantine iconic form to a more human and affectionate mother, cuddling her infant, swaying from her hip, and showing the refined manners of a well-born aristocratic courtly lady.

Secular art came into its own during this period with the rise of cities, foundation of universities, increase in trade, the establishment of a money-based economy and the creation of a bourgeois class who could afford to patronise the arts and commission works, resulting in a proliferation of paintings and illuminated manuscripts. Increased literacy and a growing body of secular vernacular literature encouraged the representation of secular themes in art. With the growth of cities, trade guilds were formed and artists were often required to be members of a painters&#x27; guild. As a result, because of better record keeping, more artists are known to us by name in this period than any previous; some artists were even so bold as to sign their names.

==Origins==

Gothic art emerged in Île-de-France, France, in the early 12th century, at the Abbey Church of St Denis built by Abbot Suger. The style rapidly spread beyond its origins in architecture to sculpture, both monumental and personal in size, textile art, and painting, which took a variety of forms, including fresco, stained glass, the illuminated manuscript, and panel painting. Monastic orders, especially the Cistercians and the Carthusians, were important builders who disseminated the style and developed distinctive variants of it across Europe. Regional variations of architecture remained important, even when, by the late 14th century, a coherent universal style known as International Gothic had evolved, which continued until the late 15th century, and beyond in many areas.

Although there was far more secular Gothic art than is often thought today, as generally the survival rate of religious art has been better than for secular equivalents, a large proportion of the art produced in the period was religious, whether commissioned by the church or by the laity.
Gothic art was often typological in nature, reflecting a belief that the events of the Old Testament pre-figured those of the New, and that this was indeed their main significance. Old and New Testament scenes were shown side by side in works like the &quot;Speculum Humanae Salvationis&quot;, and the decoration of churches. The Gothic period coincided with a great resurgence in Marian devotion, in which the visual arts played a major part. Images of the Virgin Mary developed from the Byzantine hieratic types, through the Coronation of the Virgin, to more human and intimate types, and cycles of the &quot;Life of the Virgin&quot; were very popular. Artists like Giotto, Fra Angelico and Pietro Lorenzetti in Italy, and Early Netherlandish painting, brought realism and more natural humanity to art. Western artists, and their patrons, became much more confident in innovative iconography, and much more originality is seen, although copied formulae were still used by most artists.

Iconography was affected by changes in theology, with depictions of the Assumption of Mary gaining ground on the older Death of the Virgin, and in devotional practices such as the Devotio Moderna, which produced new treatments of Christ in subjects such as the Man of Sorrows, Pensive Christ and Pietà, which emphasised his human suffering and vulnerability, in a parallel movement to that in depictions of the Virgin. Even in &quot;Last Judgements&quot; Christ was now usually shown exposing his chest to show the wounds of his Passion. Saints were shown more frequently and altarpieces showed saints relevant to the particular church or donor in attendance on a Crucifixion or enthroned Virgin and Child, or occupying the central space themselves (this usually for works designed for side-chapels). Over the period many ancient iconographical features that originated in New Testament apocrypha were gradually eliminated under clerical pressure, like the midwives at the Nativity, though others were too well-established, and considered harmless.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Gothic&quot; for art was initially used as a synonym for &quot;Barbaric&quot;, and was therefore used pejoratively. Its critics saw this type of Medieval art as unrefined and too remote from the aesthetic proportions and shapes of Classical art. Renaissance authors believed that the Sack of Rome by the Gothic tribes in 410 had triggered the demise of the Classical world and all the values they held dear. In the 15th century, various Italian architects and writers complained that the new &quot;barbarian&quot; styles filtering down from north of the Alps posed a similar threat to the classical revival promoted by the early Renaissance. The &quot;Gothic&quot; qualifier for this art was first used in Raphael&#x27;s letter to Pope Leo X and was subsequently popularised by the Italian artist and writer Giorgio Vasari, who used it as early as 1530, calling Gothic art a &quot;monstrous and barbarous&quot; &quot;disorder&quot;. Raphael claimed that the pointed arches of northern architecture were an echo of the primitive huts the Germanic forest dwellers formed by bending trees together – a myth which would resurface much later in a more positive sense in the writings of the German Romantic movement. &quot;Gothic art&quot; was strongly criticised by French authors such as Boileau, La Bruyère, Rousseau, before becoming a recognised form of art, and the wording becoming fixed. Molière would famously comment on Gothic:
&lt;poem&gt;
The besotted taste of Gothic monuments,
These odious monsters of ignorant centuries,
Which the torrents of barbary spewed forth.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In its beginning, Gothic art was initially called &quot;French work&quot; (&quot;Opus Francigenum&quot;), thus attesting to the priority of France in the creation of this style.

==Painting==

Painting in the Gothic style did not exist until around 1200, over 50 years after the beginnings of Gothic architecture and sculpture. The transition from Romanesque to Gothic is very imprecise and not at all a clear break, and Gothic ornamental detailing is often introduced before much change is seen in the style of figures or compositions themselves. Then figures become more animated in pose and facial expression, tend to be smaller in relation to the background of scenes, and are arranged more freely in the pictorial space, where there is room. This transition occurs first in England and France around 1200, in Germany around 1220 and Italy around 1300. Painting during the Gothic period was practiced in four primary media: frescos, panel paintings, manuscript illumination and stained glass.

===Frescos===
Frescos continued to be used as the main pictorial narrative craft on church walls in southern Europe as a continuation of early Christian and Romanesque traditions. An accident of survival has given Denmark and Sweden the largest groups of surviving church wall paintings in the Biblia pauperum style, usually extending up to recently constructed cross vaults. In both Denmark and Sweden, they were almost all covered with limewash after the Reformation which has preserved them, but some have also remained untouched since their creation. Among the finest examples from Denmark are those of the Elmelunde Master from the Danish island of Møn who decorated the churches of Fanefjord, Keldby and Elmelunde. Albertus Pictor is arguably the most well-known fresco artist from the period working in Sweden. Examples of Swedish churches with well-preserved frescos include Tensta, Gökhem and Anga churches.

===Stained glass===

In northern Europe, stained glass was an important and prestigious form of painting until the 15th century, when it became supplanted by panel painting. Gothic architecture greatly increased the amount of glass in large buildings, partly to allow for wide expanses of glass, as in rose windows. In the early part of the period mainly black paint and clear or brightly coloured glass was used, but in the early 14th century the use of compounds of silver, painted on glass which was then fired, allowed a number of variations of colour, centred on yellows, to be used with clear glass in a single piece. By the end of the period designs increasingly used large pieces of glass which were painted, with yellows as the dominant colours, and relatively few smaller pieces of glass in other colours.

===Manuscripts and printmaking===
Illuminated manuscripts represent the most complete record of Gothic painting, providing a record of styles in places where no monumental works have otherwise survived. The earliest full manuscripts with French Gothic illustrations date to the middle of the 13th century. Many such illuminated manuscripts were royal bibles, although psalters also included illustrations; the Parisian Psalter of Saint Louis, dating from 1253 to 1270, features 78 full-page illuminations in tempera paint and gold leaf.

During the late 13th century, scribes began to create prayer books for the laity, often known as books of hours due to their use at prescribed times of the day. Among the earliest is an example by William de Brailes that seems to have been written for an unknown laywoman living in a small village near Oxford in about 1240. Nobility frequently purchased such texts, paying handsomely for decorative illustrations; among the most well-known creators of these is Jean Pucelle, whose Hours of Jeanne d&#x27;Evreux was commissioned by King Charles IV as a gift for his queen, Jeanne d&#x27;Évreux. Elements of the French Gothic present in such works include the use of decorative page framing reminiscent of the architecture of the time with elongated and detailed figures. The use of spatial indicators such as building elements and natural features such as trees and clouds also denote the French Gothic style of illumination.

From the middle of the 14th century, blockbooks with both text and images cut as woodcut seem to have been affordable by parish priests in the Low Countries, where they were most popular. By the end of the century, printed books with illustrations, still mostly on religious subjects, were rapidly becoming accessible to the prosperous middle class, as were engravings of fairly high quality by printmakers like Israhel van Meckenem and Master E. S. In the 15th century, the introduction of cheap prints, mostly in woodcut, made it possible even for peasants to have devotional images at home. These images, tiny at the bottom of the market, often crudely coloured, were sold in thousands but are now extremely rare, most having been pasted to walls.

===Altarpiece and panel painting===
Painting with oil on canvas did not become popular until the 15th and 16th centuries and was a hallmark of Renaissance art. In Northern Europe the important and innovative school of Early Netherlandish painting is in an essentially Gothic style, but can also be regarded as part of the Northern Renaissance, as there was a long delay before the Italian revival of interest in classicism had a great impact in the north. Painters like Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck made use of the technique of oil painting to create minutely detailed works, correct in perspective, where apparent realism was combined with richly complex symbolism arising precisely from the realistic detail they could now include, even in small works. In Early Netherlandish painting, from the richest cities of Northern Europe, a new minute realism in oil painting was combined with subtle and complex theological allusions, expressed precisely through the highly detailed settings of religious scenes. The Mérode Altarpiece (1420s) of Robert Campin and the Washington Van Eyck Annunciation or Madonna of Chancellor Rolin (both 1430s, by Jan van Eyck) are examples. For the wealthy, small panel paintings, even polyptychs in oil painting were becoming increasingly popular, often showing donor portraits alongside, though often much smaller than the Virgin or saints depicted. These were usually displayed in the home.

==Sculpture==
===Monumental sculpture===

The Gothic period is essentially defined by Gothic architecture, and does not entirely fit with the development of style in sculpture in either its start or finish. The facades of large churches, especially around doors, continued to have large tympanums, but also rows of sculpted figures spreading around them.

The statues on the Western (Royal) Portal at Chartres Cathedral () show an elegant but exaggerated columnar elongation, but those on the south transept portal, from 1215–20, show a more naturalistic style and increasing detachment from the wall behind, and some awareness of the classical tradition. These trends were continued in the west portal at Reims Cathedral of a few years later, where the figures are almost in the round, as became usual as Gothic spread across Europe. Bamberg Cathedral has perhaps the largest assemblage of 13th century sculpture, culminating in 1240 with the Bamberg Rider, the first life-size equestrian statue in Western art since the 6th century.

&quot;In Italy the Gospel of Gothic was preached from pulpits not from tympana, and the unit of the sculptor&#x27;s thinking was an autonomous, self-consistent work of art&quot; (John Pope-Hennessy).
Nicola Pisano (1258–78) and his son Giovanni developed a style that is often called Proto-Renaissance, with unmistakable influence from Roman sarcophagi and sophisticated and crowded compositions, including a sympathetic handling of nudity, in relief panels on their pulpit of Siena Cathedral (1265–68), Pulpit in the Pisa Baptistery, the Fontana Maggiore in Perugia, and Giovanni&#x27;s pulpit in Pistoia of 1301.

Another revival of classical style is seen in the International Gothic work of Claus Sluter and his followers in Burgundy and Flanders around 1400. Late Gothic sculpture continued in the North, with a fashion for very large, wooden, sculpted altarpieces with increasingly virtuoso carving and large numbers agitated expressive figures; most surviving examples are in Germany, after much iconoclasm elsewhere. Tilman Riemenschneider, Veit Stoss and others continued the style well into the 16th century, gradually absorbing Italian Renaissance influences.

Life-size tomb effigies in stone or alabaster became popular for the wealthy, and grand multi-level tombs evolved, with the Scaliger Tombs of Verona so large they had to be moved outside the church. By the 15th century there was an industry exporting Nottingham alabaster altar reliefs in groups of panels over much of Europe for economical parishes who could not afford stone retables.

===Portable sculpture===

Small carvings, for a mainly lay and often female market, became a considerable industry in Paris and some other centres. Types of ivories included small, devotional polyptychs, single figures, especially of the Virgin, mirror-cases, combs, and elaborate caskets with scenes from Romances, used as engagement presents. The very wealthy collected extravagantly elaborate, jewelled and enamelled metalwork, both secular and religious, like the Duc de Berry&#x27;s Holy Thorn Reliquary, until they ran short of money, when they were melted down again for cash.

Gothic sculptures independent of architectural ornament were primarily created as devotional objects for the home or intended as donations for local churches, although small reliefs in ivory, bone and wood cover both religious and secular subjects, and were for church and domestic use. These sculptures were created by urban artisans, and the most common theme for three-dimensional small statues is the Virgin Mary alone or with a child. Paris was the main centre of ivory workshops, and exported to most of northern Europe, though Italy also had a considerable production. An exemplar of these independent sculptures is among the collections of the Abbey Church of St Denis; the silver-gilt &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; dates to 1339 and features Mary enveloped in a flowing cloak holding an infantile Christ figure. Both the simplicity of the cloak and the youth of the child presage other sculptures found in northern Europe dating to the 14th century and early 15th century. Such sculpture shows an evolution from an earlier stiff and elongated style, still partly Romanesque, into a spatial and naturalistic feel in the late 12th and early 13th century. Other French Gothic sculptural subjects included figures and scenes from popular literature of the time. Imagery from the poetry of the troubadours was particularly popular among artisans of mirror-cases and small boxes presumably for use by women. The Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264) of 1330–50 is an unusually large example with space for a number of scenes from different literary sources.

Souvenirs of pilgrimages to shrines, such as clay or lead badges, medals and ampullae stamped with images were also popular and cheap. Their secular equivalent, the livery badge, showed signs of feudal and political loyalty or alliance that came to be regarded as a social menace in England under bastard feudalism. The cheaper forms were sometimes given away free, as with the 13,000 badges ordered in 1483 by King Richard III of England in fustian cloth with his emblem of a white boar for the investiture of his son Edward as Prince of Wales, a huge number given the population at the time. The Dunstable Swan Jewel, modelled fully in the round in enamelled gold, is a far more exclusive version, that would have been given to someone very close or important to the donor.

<doc id="894941" wikidata="Q2607130" url="?curid=894941" title="Farthingale">
<text>A farthingale is one of several structures used under Western European women&#x27;s clothing - especially in the 16th and 17th centuries - to support the skirts in the desired shape and to enlarge the lower half of the body. The fashion originated in Spain in the fifteenth century. Farthingales served important social and cultural functions for women in Renaissance Europe as they expressed, primarily when worn by court women, high social position and wealth.

== Spanish farthingale ==
The Spanish &quot;verdugado&quot;, from which &quot;farthingale&quot; derives, was a hoop skirt originally stiffened with esparto grass; later designs in the temperate climate zone were stiffened with osiers (willow withies), rope, or (from about 1580) whalebone. The name &quot;verdugado&quot; comes from the Spanish &quot;verdugo&quot; (&quot;green wood&quot;, or the more modern meaning of &quot;executioner&quot;).

The earliest sources indicate that Joan of Portugal started to use verdugados with hoops in Spain. Joan had provoked much criticism as she allegedly wore dresses that displayed too much décolletage, and her wanton behaviour was considered scandalous. When she started to use farthingales, court fashion followed suit. As Joan had two illegitimate children by Pedro de Castilla y Fonseca, rumors abounded that she used the farthingale to cover up a pregnancy.

The earliest images of Spanish farthingales show hoops prominently displayed on the outer surfaces of skirts, although later they merely provided shape to the overskirt. Catherine of Aragon is said to have brought the fashion into England on her marriage to Arthur, Prince of Wales, in 1501. She and her ladies were observed to wear &quot;beneath their waist certain round hoops, bearing out their gowns from their bodies, after their country manner&quot;. However, there is little evidence to show that she continued to wear this fashion as she adopted English styles of dress. In March 1519 at a masque at Greenwich Palace female dancers in fanciful &quot;Egyptian&quot; costumes wore black velvet gowns &quot;with hoops from the waist downwards&quot;, which may have been farthingales.

Farthingales remained a fixture of conservative Spanish court fashion into the early 17th century (as exemplified by Margaret of Austria), before evolving into the &quot;guardainfante&quot; of 17th-century Spanish dress.

== Farthingales in England and Scotland ==
One of the first references to a farthingale in England comes from the accounts of Princess Elizabeth in 1545 that describe a farthingale made of crimson Bruges satin. The courtier Elizabeth Holland owned two red Bruges satin farthingales in 1547. Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset asked for her clothes, including a farthingale to be sent to her in the Tower of London in 1551. Nicholas Udall mentioned &quot;trick ferdegews and billements of gold&quot; in his comedy &quot;Ralph Roister Doister&quot; written around 1552.

Spanish farthingales were bought by Mary I of England and became an essential element of Tudor fashion in England. Mary&#x27;s chamberer Jane Russell was given a farthingale made from fustian. At a dinner for French diplomats in May 1559, the farthingales of Elizabeth I and her ladies took up so much space that some women of her privy chamber had to sit on the rush-covered floor.

A chest of costume for drama at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1554 contained some items fashioned from disused vestments, including two pieces of blue silk which were &quot;tranposyd to wardyngalis&quot; with a pair of sleeves. Farthingales were bought for children, including Ann Cavendish, the nine year old stepdaughter of Bess of Hardwick in 1548. In 1550, Margaret Willoughby, sister of Francis Willoughby, was bought a red broadcloth petticoat and her &quot;vardingale&quot; was made from buckram and covered with red cloth. Margaret and Mary Kitson were bought &quot;verdingalles&quot; in December 1573. Mary, as Countess Rivers, made bequests of clothing in 1641 including a carnation and black taffeta fathingales and rolls.

The French educated Mary, Queen of Scots had a black taffeta &quot;verdugalle&quot; in 1550, and another of violet taffeta, and a set of fashion dolls with 15 farthingales. Whale bone was bought to shape her farthingales in 1562. The contemporary French physician Ambroise Paré noted the use of baleen from the mouths of whales for women&#x27;s &quot;vertugalles&quot; and &quot;busques&quot;.

== French farthingale roll ==
French farthingales originated in court circles in France. Jeanne d&#x27;Albret had a farthingale stiffened with rushes, &quot;jonc&quot;, in 1571. They first appeared in England during the 1570s. On 17 March 1577 the English ambassador to Paris, Amyas Paulet, sent a new type of farthingale to Queen Elizabeth I stating that it was &quot;such as is now used by the French Queen and the Queen of Navarre.&quot; Janet Arnold has stated that this new style was probably a roll that sat on top of the cone-shaped Spanish farthingale.

Randle Cotgrave, in his &quot;Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues&quot; (1611), defined the French farthingale as &quot;the kind of roll used by such women as weare no Vardingales.&quot; Several wardrobe accounts and tailors&#x27; bills of the late 16th century give us an idea of what these rolls were made of: they were stuffed with cotton and rags, and stiffened with hoops of whalebone, wire, or ropes made of bent reeds. Buckram (stiff canvas) is the most commonly mentioned material. Other references describe the rolls being starched.

Here are a couple of sample references to rolls from Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s Wardrobe Accounts (MS Egerton 2806):

:* (1585)
:* (1586)

There are no extant examples of this style of undergarment, and only one illustration, a satirical Dutch engraving of c. 1600, that shows the bum-roll being affixed by a tiring-woman. From contemporary references, and the visual cues provided by the engraving, it appears to have consisted of a bolster-like roll either stuffed or held out with reeds which, being fastened around the hips, served the purpose of widening the skirts at the hip area, creating drapes.

Some modern costumers conjecture that the French farthingale and the &quot;great farthingale&quot; were one and the same garment, the difference in shape and construction being due to changes in fashion from the 1580s to the 1590s.

==French wheel farthingale or great farthingale==
A second style of French farthingale, also known as the wheel, great, drum or cartwheel farthingale, became fashionable in England during the 1590s. It seems to have consisted of several hoops made from whalebone that graduated outwards from the level of the waistline in a wheel shape. This structure was often supported by a padded roll underneath, and was distinct in appearance from the other French farthingale roll, as it had a hard edge from which the skirts dramatically fell.

Although there are also no surviving examples of this type of garment, there are a number of references to a &quot;Great Farthingale&quot; in Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s wardrobe accounts during the time when this style was in vogue. &quot;Great&quot; in this context referred to the large circumference of the farthingale, which was required in order to achieve the fashionable silhouette. Changes in the shape of the farthingale impacted the construction of other garments including the &quot;forepart&quot;, the exposed front or apron of the skirt or kirtle made from richer fabrics. Later forms of the forepart were larger and wider and some surviving examples seem to have been extended to accommodate the new shape.

The great farthingale appears to have been worn at an angle (&quot;low before and high behind&quot;) which visually elongated the wearer&#x27;s torso while shortening her legs. The angle was likely created by the use of bodies (corsets) or boned bodices with long centre fronts that pushed down on the farthingale, tilting it. Such an effect has been shown in many reconstructions of the garment.

Some historians have raised doubts about the size of these garments, which some contemporaries claimed could be as wide as 1.4 metres. Instead they claim that the seemingly enormous size of these garments was an optical illusion created by wearing it with a pair of bodies (corset) that elongated and streamlined the torso. Criticisms of farthingales are also indicative of spatial anxieties relating to fears about these garments creating intimate personal spaces around the female body, masking the appropriation of social status, and physically displacing men. These fears continued into the eighteenth and nineteenth century, where tropes about the size of hoop petticoats (panniers) and crinolines continued.

===Anne of Denmark and the fashion of farthingales===
Farthingales for Queen Elizabeth were made by specialist Robert Sibthorpe. Anne of Denmark had her gowns altered in 1603 to suit English fashions, and employed Robert Hughes to make farthingales from 1603 to 1618. Robert Naunton thought that Anne&#x27;s farthingale might conceal a pregnancy in October 1605, writing, &quot;The Queen is generally held to be pregnant, but no appearance eminent by reason of the short vardugals in use&quot;.

During celebrations in London in 1613 at the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V of the Palatinate, it was said that women wearing farthingales were not admitted to crowded events to save space. The letter writer John Chamberlain hoped this would lead to the demise of the fashion. Princess Elizabeth herself was wearing a whalebone farthingale and &quot;bodies&quot; made by John Spence.

In June 1617 Leonora, Lady Bennet&#x27;s large English farthingale drew unwelcome attention from a crowd in the streets of Amsterdam. In December 1617 the Venetian ambassador Piero Contarini was surprised by the size of Anne of Denmark&#x27;s farthingale which was four feet wide at the hips. Large styles of French farthingales remained popular in England and France until the 1620s when they disappeared in portraiture and wardrobe accounts. They were replaced by small rolls or bum-rolls that persisted throughout the rest of the seventeenth century. In Spain, the Spanish farthingales evolved into the &quot;guardainfante&quot; and remained an identifiable part of Spanish dress until the eighteenth century.

Anne of Denmark&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, was in Prague in 1620. She wrote of her surprise at the large Spanish style ruffs and Spanish style gowns worn without farthingales by aristocrats and townspeople. She ensured her gentlewomen adapted to the culture. 

A well-known anecdote concerning farthingales dates from the end of this period. It was said that in 1628 Jane, wife of the English ambassador Peter Wyche in Constantinople astonished Ayşe Sultan, wife of Murad IV, with her farthingale and she wondered if all English women had such an unusual shape. This story may have been composed in condemnation of the fashion.

==Farthingale sleeves==
In England, sleeves were enlarged and shaped with a whale bone armature, worn as a support underneath wide sleeves, and these were called &quot;farthingale sleeves&quot; or &quot;vardingall sleeves&quot;. They could also be called &quot;trunk sleeves&quot;. An account from William Jones for making a gown for Queen Elizabeth includes &quot;a payer of vardingall sleves of holland cloth bented with whals bone and covered with riben.&quot; Another account from Jones, for the queen&#x27;s dwarf Tomasen in 1597, includes a &quot;paier of verthingale slevis of fustian&quot;. Jones made many pairs of farthingale sleeves in the 1580s, perhaps for the women of Elizabeth&#x27;s court.

Such sleeves were worn by women outside court circles. Anne Williamson of Wilne in Derbyshire (a granddaughter of Lord Mordaunt), wrote in December 1590 to her husband about a London tailor who was making her &quot;a pair of verdingale sleeves &amp; a French verdingale&quot;. A Welsh MP William Maurice asked a Shrewsbury tailor to provide a French bodice with farthingale sleeves for his young daughter or cousin in 1594.

Farthingale sleeves for Catherine Fenton Boyle cost 4 shillings and 4 pence in October 1604 from Robert Dobson, a London tailor. In 1605, Catherine Tollemache wrote to her London tailor, Roger Jones, about farthingale sleeves covered with satin, and he suggested another style of sleeve now in fashion would be &quot;fytter&quot; for her new gown. In 1607 there were discussions about taxing imported whale fin baleen, &quot;used only in sleeves and bodies for women&quot;.

A surviving single English farthingale sleeve with its whalebone hoops and an outer silk sleeve was rediscovered in 2022. These items, connected with the Willoughby family of Wollaton Hall, were shown on the television program, &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;. A collection of Elizabethan costume remaining at Wollaton Hall was described in 1702 by the family historian Cassandra Willoughby.

==Farthingale pins==
The wardrobe accounts of Queen Elizabeth mention the purchase of thousands of special &quot;great verthingale pynnes&quot;, &quot;myddle verthingale pynnes&quot;, and &quot;smale verthingale pynnes&quot; from 1563. These were probably used for pinning deep tucks in fathingales to hold whalebone supports, and to position heavy silk skirts in place over the farthingale.

Elizabeth&#x27;s pin-maker or &quot;pynner&quot; was Robert Careles. He delivered recycled old farthingale pins and other pins to &quot;Ippolyta the Tartarian&quot;, a young Russian woman brought to Elizabeth&#x27;s court by Anthony Jenkinson. She had a farthingale made of mockado fabric. Pins for Henrietta Maria were made by Thomas Ardington. In 1631 his bill included 13,500 &quot;middle vardingale pins&quot;.

<text>A triplane is a fixed-wing aircraft equipped with three vertically stacked wing planes. Tailplanes and canard foreplanes are not normally included in this count, although they occasionally are.

==Design principles==

The triplane arrangement may be compared with the biplane in a number of ways.

A triplane arrangement has a narrower wing chord than a biplane of similar span and area. This gives each wing-plane a slender appearance with higher aspect ratio, making it more efficient and giving increased lift. This potentially offers a faster rate of climb and tighter turning radius, both of which are important in a fighter. The Sopwith Triplane was a successful example, having the same wing span as the equivalent biplane, the Sopwith Pup.

Alternatively, a triplane has reduced span compared to a biplane of given wing area and aspect ratio, leading to a more compact and lightweight structure. This potentially offers better maneuverability for a fighter, and higher load-capacity with more practical ground handling for a large aircraft type.

The famous Fokker Dr.I triplane offered a balance between the two approaches, having moderately shorter span and moderately higher aspect ratio than the equivalent biplane, the Fokker D.VI.

Yet a third comparison may be made between a biplane and triplane having the same wing plan: the triplane&#x27;s third wing provides increased wing area, giving much-increased lift. The extra weight is partially offset by the increased depth of the overall structure, allowing a more efficient construction. The Caproni Ca.4 and Levy-Besson families of large, multi-engined triplanes both had some success with this approach.

These advantages are offset to a greater or lesser extent in any given design by the extra weight and drag of the structural bracing and by the loss of lift resulting from aerodynamic interference between the wings in any stacked configuration. The multiplane idea was taken a step further by the quadruplane. No examples were successful, and as biplane design advanced, it became clear that the disadvantages of the triplane and quadruplane outweighed their advantages.

In a practical landplane design, the lower set of wings are typically set approximately level with the underside of the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage, the middle set level with the top of the fuselage, and the top set supported above the fuselage on cabane struts. In a practical flying boat, even the lowest wing must be placed well above the waterline of the hull, creating a tall structure overall.

==History==
The first heavier-than-air craft to carry a person in free flight was a triplane, as far back as 1848 and long before the advent of powered flight. One of the few Danish designs to fly, in 1907, and the first powered type to fly in Germany, was also a triplane. However the triplane has seldom proved a practical solution and few types have ever entered production. The majority of triplane designs emerged during a narrow period from 1908 to 1923. Besides the famous fighting triplanes of the First World War, several larger types became successful bombers, airliners and maritime patrol aircraft, sometimes as different variants of the same basic design, both during and immediately after the war. The last triplane design, privately homebuilt, was introduced shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War.

===Pioneer years===
The first heavier-than-air machine to carry a human on a free, untethered flight was a triplane glider constructed by George Cayley and flown in 1848. It was modern in form, having three stacked wings above the fuselage and a separate stabilising tail with both fin and tailplane. The wings were of typical Cayley kite-like planform having a low aspect ratio. The craft was not large enough to carry an adult so a local boy was chosen as the passenger. His name is not known.

Between 1907 and 1911 a number of pioneers experimented with triplanes, some capable of flight and others not. None proved outstanding, although the series produced by A.V. Roe had some success and sold in small numbers.

In 1907 the Danish pioneer Jacob Ellehammer flew a powered triplane and would later receive a prize for flying it in Germany.

The French Bousson-Borgnis canard triplane of 1908 was a failure. The Goupy No.1, designed in 1908 by Ambroise Goupy and built by Voisin, was more successful. A few weeks after the Goupy No.1 flew, Hans Grade&#x27;s triplane became the first German-built aeroplane to fly. In the same year Farman modified his original Voisin machine to triplane configuration, and Dorand constructed a military triplane.

In 1909 the American Morris Bokor constructed his own canard triplane and the Frenchman Alfred Groos constructed a triplane which failed to fly. Through 1909 and 1910 the British aviation pioneer A.V. Roe built a series of four experimental triplanes—types I, II, III and IV—and selling a small number of his Type II and III designs, before abandoning the triplane.

Alexander Graham Bell was experimenting with an &quot;octahedral&quot; wing design and in 1910 built a triplane example, the Oionus I, which failed to fly.

In 1911 the Belgian César Battaille constructed a triplane capable of short flights or hops, and the Russian Rodjestveisky also constructed a triplane.

===Fighter triplanes===

During World War I, some aircraft manufacturers turned to the triplane configuration for fighter aircraft. In practice these triplanes generally offered inferior performance to the equivalent biplane and, despite a brief vogue around 1917, only four types saw limited production.

Nieuport built a series of triplane prototypes between 1915 and 1917, featuring a top wing heavily staggered backwards to improve the pilot&#x27;s view and a characteristic triangular strut arrangement bracing the three wings. The design resulted in poor handling and was eventually dropped.

Sopwith developed three different triplane designs in 1916. One, known simply as the Sopwith Triplane, went into production and became the first military triplane to see operational service. It had equal-span wings of high aspect ratio, mounted on a fuselage very similar to that of the preceding Pup biplane, and braced by one sturdy strut on each side with minimal wire bracing. The type was ordered by both the RFC and RNAS, but the RFC traded theirs for another type and the Sopwith saw service only with the RNAS, where it served with success.

The Sopwith type&#x27;s performance advantage and early successes over the Albatros D.III spurred military interest in the design, especially in Germany and Austria-Hungary. A flurry of fighter prototypes were produced through 1917 and 1918, sometimes reluctantly while under pressure from the military. Examples were produced by Albatros, Aviatik, Brandenburg, DFW, Euler, Fokker, Friedrichshafen, LFG Roland, Lloyd, Lohner, Oeffag, Pfalz, Sablating, Schütte-Lanz, Siemens-Schuckert, W.K.F, in Britain by Austin and in the US by Curtiss. Only two companies, Fokker and Curtiss, would see any of their designs into production.

Fokker&#x27;s V.4 prototype of 1917 (identified by some as the V.3) had unusual cantilevered wings without bracing, the uppermost wing being attached only by cabane struts to the fuselage. The wings vibrated excessively in flight and the next prototype, the V.5, featured a single interplane strut on each side, similar to the Sopwith but with no wires called shrouds. This became the prototype of the famous Fokker Dr.I triplane of 1917, which would become immortalised as the aircraft most closely identified in popular culture with Manfred von Richthofen, the &quot;Red Baron&quot;. Although it had a good rate of climb and was highly manoeuvrable, it was not particularly fast. Following the break-up of two examples in the air, the type was withdrawn from service for strengthening, and by the time it was re-introduced, it was no longer at the forefront of performance.

Meanwhile, in the US, the Curtiss company produced many triplane designs between 1916 and 1918. Of these, several fighters and related types entered production, notably the Model L trainer (of which three examples were constructed as floatplanes) and the Model S and Model 18-T fighters. The Curtiss GS-1 prototype of 1918 was unusual in being a floatplane scout from the outset.

The performance of the fighting triplanes was soon overtaken by improved biplane fighters. However, as late as 1919 three prototype Sopwith Snarks were flown, and in 1920 and 1921 the heavily armoured Boeing GA-1 and GA-2 ground-attack triplanes proved too heavy to be useful.

===Zeppelin killers===
A few British designers pursued the triplane configuration in the anti-Zeppelin role. From 1915, Armstrong Whitworth developed the F.K.5 and F.K.6 prototypes. These were large three-seat types with twin engines and the middle wing of noticeably longer span than the others. Then in 1917 Blackburn produced their single-seat triplane. It was something of a throwback, featuring a pusher propeller and boom-mounted empennage in the manner of an earlier era. The arrangement was intended to allow fitting of an upwards-firing 2-pounder recoilless gun in the forward fuselage. Neither type progressed beyond the prototype stage.

===Bombers, transports and patrol===
The French began experimenting with bomber designs in 1915. The Morane-Saulnier TRK and Voisin Triplane prototypes of 1915 and 1916 were not successful. The Voisin design was unusual in having a subsidiary tail boom above the fuselage, helping to support the empennage. French triplanes had more success in the long-range maritime role. Labourdette-Halbronn produced a twin-hulled triplane torpedo bomber prototype, the H.T.1, in 1918 and two prototypes of a modified H.T.2 version in 1919. Besson designed several triplane flying boats between ca. 1917 and 1919, initially in partnership with Levy. The Levy-Besson Alerte of 1917 featured a central wing of greater span than the others and many examples were used for ASW and patrol duties. Their last such design, the 1919 Levy-Besson High Seas had the top wing extended to the same span as the central wing and was also ordered into production, although the run was cancelled after relatively few had been delivered. Besson split from Levy and created his own Besson LB maritime patrol flying boat in the same year, and also the Besson Hydravion école which he exhibited at the Paris 1919 Air Show. He later developed a number of smaller designs for other roles, including Besson H-6 mail plane flown in 1921.
The Italian Caproni Ca.4 of 1917 was another successful design and entered service with the Italian air force as a heavy bomber in 1918. Many further variants were produced, both during and after the war. Caproni later re-numbered many of these variants as new types, including the Ca.48 airliner. In Italy&#x27;s first commercial aviation disaster and one of the earliest – and, at the time, deadliest – airliner accidents, a Ca.48 crashed while flying over Verona, Italy, on August 2, 1919, killing everyone on board (between 14 and 17 people). The unsuccessful Caproni Ca.60 prototype transatlantic seaplane had three sets of triplane wings taken from the Ca.4, making nine wings in all, and is generally classified as a multiplane.

Among the many large seaplane designs produced in the US by Curtiss between 1916 and 1918, several were triplanes, however none entered production, including the Wanamaker Triplane prototype.

Britain, too, gained its first triplane bomber in 1917 with the single-engined Sopwith Rhino. It was not a success and the Sopwith Cobham, the only twin-engined type that Sopwith ever produced, fared little better two years later. From 1918, the British company Bristol developed a series of heavy triplanes which, like the Caproni design, appeared in different variants aimed at different roles. The first was the Bristol Braemar bomber, flying in 1918 with the Mk II version in 1919. The Bristol Pullman 14-seat transport variant flew in 1920. This was followed by two examples of a new, larger design for a military freighter known as the Bristol Tramp. The Tarrant Tabor, another and much larger British bomber, was built with three wings to carry the six engines required—four more-powerful engines being unavailable. The power imbalance due to the high mounting caused the Tabor to crash on its maiden flight in 1919. Its designer Walter Barling went on to design the similar-sized American Witteman-Lewis XNBL-1 triplane, known as the &quot;Barling Bomber&quot;, which first flew in 1923. On a smaller scale, the Avro 547 airliner was a modified Avro 504 with an extra wing. Two were built, of which the first flew in 1920. It was sold to Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services but proved unsuited to the tough conditions in the Australian Outback. Britain&#x27;s only triplane contribution to the maritime arena was the Felixstowe Fury prototype of 1918, also known as the Porte Super-Baby.

Almost as late as the Barling Bomber, in 1922 the Japanese flew the Mitsubishi 1MT torpedo bomber. It entered production as the Navy Type 10.

===The racing triplanes===
After World War I, several examples of the Curtiss 18-T were used for racing. An 18T-2 nearly won the Curtiss Marine Trophy Race in 1922 (limited to U.S. Navy pilots), but pilot Sandy Sanderson ran out of fuel just before the finish line.

In 1921 the &quot;Cactus Kitten&quot; racing triplane was created by modifying the &quot;Texas Wildcat 2&quot; biplane (which in turn was a modification of the monoplane &quot;Texas Wildcat&quot; monoplane), thus becoming the only design in history to have gone from monoplane to biplane to triplane configuration. Also referred to as the Curtiss-Cox racer, being designed and sponsored by Cox from Texas and powered by a Curtiss C-12 engine, the Cactus Kitten had a wingspan of . In the 1922 Pulitzer race it came 2nd behind a Curtiss biplane. In its triplane configuration it surpassed its monoplane and biplane antecedents in handling and speed and, for a brief period in 1922, the triplane was once again being noticed with the Kitten being touted as the world&#x27;s fastest plane and being capable of surpassing 200 miles per hour. The same year it was donated to the Navy and used as a trainer for the 1922 Pulitzer race, fame having proven very fleeting.

In 1927 a Catron &amp; Fisk CF-10 twin-engined 22-seat airliner was modified with additional fuel tanks and updated engines and named the &quot;Pride of Los Angeles&quot;. The intention was to enter the Dole Air race, but an in-flight incident caused the aircraft to crash before the race started.

===Private aviation===

Some triplanes have been developed for private use. Perhaps the most unusual was the 1917 Curtiss Autoplane, a triplane flying car. The same year, the more conventional Curtiss-Judson Triplane, a one-off and slightly enlarged triplane variant of the Curtiss Model F, was sold for private use.

After the war, in France the Besson H-3 private tourer flew in 1921. And in 1923 the German hang-glider enthusiast Hans Richter flew a triplane variant.

Following the craze for the homebuilt tandem-wing Mignet Pou du Ciel (Flying Flea), a triplane variant, the American Flea, was produced in America around 1939. In this variant the top wings were fixed and the bottom wing acted as all-flying ailerons. 

In 1975 a triplane glider, titled BrO-18 &quot;Boružė&quot; (lith. &quot;Ladybird&quot;) was built in then-Soviet Lithuania by Bronius Oškinis. The aircraft having a wingspan of 4.9 meters, also earned the title of world&#x27;s smallest glider at that time. Similar configuration was used in hydro-glider BrO-17V &quot;Antelė&quot; (Lith. &quot;Duckling&quot;).

==Tandem triplanes==

A tandem triplane has two sets of triplane wings, fore and aft. Few have been made.

The Dufaux triplane of 1908 was Switzerland&#x27;s first native aircraft design, configured as a tandem triplane with a smaller biplane horizontal stabiliser.

The 1909 Roe I Triplane has also been described as a tandem triplane due to its relatively large triplane aft plane.

The Fokker V.8 of 1917 was another tandem design although not a true tandem triplane, having a triplane fore wing, biplane rear wing and monoplane tail stabiliser.

In 1921, the Italian Gianni Caproni mated three stacks of triplane wings from his Ca.4 series to a single fuselage in a tandem triple triplane arrangement, to create the Caproni Ca.60 &quot;Noviplano&quot; prototype transatlantic airliner. It proved unstable and crashed on its second flight.

A further example was under construction in Kansas City, Kansas, as late as 1922.

Recently, the term &quot;tandem triplane&quot; has been used for some new monoplane types that have active &quot;canard&quot; foreplane surfaces in addition to conventional wings and horizontal tailplane. A configuration having three comparable lifting surfaces in tandem is more typically referred to as a &quot;three surface aircraft&quot;, or sometimes a &quot;tandem triple&quot; or &quot;tandem triplet&quot;, and is not a triplane as such. These modern types may also be compared to the pioneer Voisin-Farman I and Curtiss No. 1 which also had a large main wing with smaller fore and aft planes; the smaller planes were not regarded as part of the main wing arrangement, and they were not described as tandem types.

<text>Darren O&#x27;Shaughnessy (; born 2 July 1972) is an Irish writer and novelist. He is best known for his young adult fiction series &quot;The Saga of Darren Shan&quot;, &quot;The Demonata&quot;, and &quot;Zom-B&quot;, published under the pseudonym Darren Shan. The former was adapted into a manga series from 2006 to 2009 as well as a live-action film in 2009, with a prequel series, &quot;The Saga of Larten Crepsley&quot;, being released from 2010 to 2012.

O&#x27;Shaughnessy has published other children&#x27;s books as Darren Shan, including &quot;Koyasan&quot;, and &quot;The Thin Executioner.&quot; From 2020 to 2022, he self-published his latest young adult series &quot;Archibald Lox&quot;.

In the past, O&#x27;Shaughnessy has also published novels for adults under the Darren Shan pseudonym, but since 2014 he has released his work for older readers under the name of Darren Dash.

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Shaughnessy was born in St Thomas’ Hospital in London, opposite the Houses of Parliament. At the age of three, he started school at English Martyrs&#x27; near the Elephant and Castle where he lived. When he was six, he moved with his parents and younger brother, to Limerick in Ireland, where he has lived ever since.

He received his primary education in Askeaton, and attended secondary school at Copsewood College, Pallaskenry, graduating in 1989. He returned to London in 1990 to pursue a degree in Sociology and English from Roehampton Institute of Higher Education.

==Career==
O&#x27;Shaughnessy bought his first typewriter when he was fourteen and wrote many short stories, comic scripts, and books that he never finished, many of which are unpublished. O&#x27;Shaughnessy claims that most of these stories will never be published. His first success came to him at age fifteen, when he was a runner-up in a TV script-writing competition for RTÉ in Ireland, with a dark comedy story entitled &quot;A Day in the Morgue&quot;.

After university, O&#x27;Shaughnessy worked in a TV cable company in Limerick for two years, before becoming a full-time writer at the age of 23. His breakthrough came with &quot;Ayuamarca&quot;, published in February 1999 by Orion Publishing Group under his full name. The sequel, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Horizon&quot;, was published in February 2000. &quot;Ayuamarca&quot; was re-released in March 2008 under the title &quot;Procession of the Dead&quot; and the pen-name &quot;D.B. Shan&quot;. &quot;Hell&#x27;s Horizon&quot; followed in March 2009, and the third in the trilogy, &quot;City of the Snakes&quot; in March 2010 (but this time under the name of Darren Shan). In January 2000, Shan released &quot;Cirque du Freak&quot;, the first book of &quot;The Saga of Darren Shan&quot; series in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The series was a huge global success and by 2021 his books were on sale in 40 countries, in 32 languages, and had sold thirty million copies worldwide.

O&#x27;Shaughnessy signed up with the Christopher Little Literary Agency in 1996 and they continued to represent him until Christopher Little&#x27;s death in 2021. He is now represented by the Curtis Brown Agency.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Shaughnessy continues to live in Pallaskenry in Limerick, Ireland with his wife Helen Basini, a freelance university lecturer and global aid specialist. On 23 September 2014, the couple celebrated the birth of their first child, Dante, named after the famous Italian author Dante Alighieri. Shan and his wife Helen welcomed their second child, a daughter named Gaia, on 26 March 2019.

===Unpublished books===
In July 2009, O&#x27;Shaughnessy revealed that he had written first drafts of 53 books in total. Most of those have now been published, although there are several which have yet to see the light of day, which he plans to release in the future, most probably under his Darren Dash umbrella. There are also a few that will very likely never be published. O&#x27;Shaughnessy has not revealed details of any of his unpublished books, with two exceptions — &quot;Mute Pursuit&quot; and &quot;The Cannibal King&quot;:

# &quot;Mute Pursuit&quot; – A futuristic cross between &quot;The Terminator&quot; and Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;; this was Shan&#x27;s first completed book at age seventeen.

# &quot;The Cannibal King&quot; – This was originally going to be the 12th book of &quot;The Saga of Darren Shan&quot; – book 11 was originally meant to be much longer, including elements from the first half of what became &quot;Sons of Destiny&quot;. &quot;The Cannibal King&quot; was never published because it was originally part of the planned 24-book Saga. Shan had planned to write 18—24 books for The Saga, with half of them taking place in the future wasteworld shown in Book 10, &quot;The Lake of Souls&quot;. For reasons explained on his web site, Shan decided to end the series with &quot;Sons of Destiny&quot;, which was written and released instead of &quot;The Cannibal King&quot;. He never reveals anything that he wrote in this book, because there is a possibility that he might one day write a follow-up series to The Saga, which would take parts of this book as its starting point.

==Television and film==
Universal Studios bought the film rights to the first three books of &quot;The Saga of Darren Shan&quot; and combined them to make a single film, &quot;Cirque du Freak: The Vampire&#x27;s Assistant&quot;, released in the US on 23 October 2009. Lauren Shuler Donner produced the film and Paul Weitz directed. The original screenplay was written by Brian Helgeland but rewritten entirely by Paul Weitz.

In May 2019, &quot;Zom-B&quot; was optioned for a ten-part television series adaptation by London-based production company The Electric Shadow Company.
In March 2020, it was announced that The Electric Shadow Company had partnered with Slam Films in developing the series. In March 2021, Susan E. Connolly was announced to be attached as the lead writer on the project, with The Electric Shadow Company releasing a teaser image depicting a blood-spattered B Smith opposite her best friend Vinyl to their website. On 15th January 2024, Darren Shan announced on his website that the project would not be moving forwards and that the option rights had reverted to him.

<doc id="894949" wikidata="Q127694165" url="?curid=894949" title="Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad">
<text>The Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad was a railroad that grew, in stages, from Rome, New York to Watertown and then to Ogdensburg, New York and Massena, New York. The original Rome and Watertown Railroad terminated in Cape Vincent, NY on the St. Lawrence River. A branch of the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad, commonly known as &quot;The Hojack Line&quot;, operated along the south shore of Lake Ontario, from Oswego, New York to Niagara Falls, New York.

After it was merged into the New York Central in 1913, the RW&amp;O line was known as the St. Lawrence Division.

==History==
The Rome, Watertown &amp; Ogdensburg Railroad (RW&amp;O) began in 1842 as the Watertown &amp; Rome Railroad (W&amp;R) to link Watertown with Rome, New York on the Syracuse &amp; Utica Railroad, later consolidated as part of the New York Central Railroad (NYC). The Potsdam &amp; Watertown Railroad was formed at this time to link Watertown with Potsdam, New York in St. Lawrence County. In 1861, these two railroads merged as the RW&amp;O.

A branch line from DeKalb Junction (near Canton, New York) to Ogdensburg was later built. In 1864, the RW&amp;O constructed a line from Pulaski to Oswego and merged with the Syracuse &amp; Northern Railroad. In 1858, the Lake Ontario Shore Railroad (LOS) was chartered from Oswego to Suspension Bridge, New York (now Niagara Falls, New York). RW&amp;O merged with the LOS in 1875; by that time the LOS was bankrupt. Branch lines reached what became resort towns along the St. Lawrence River at the end of the 19th century: Cape Vincent, Clayton and Ogdensburg. At the first two towns, ferries were available to Ontario towns on the opposite side of the river, as well as the Thousand Islands.

The RW&amp;O was nicknamed &quot;Rotten Wood &amp; Old Rusty Rails&quot; due to its crumbling infrastructure. By 1878, the RW&amp;O had been merged into the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad (DL&amp;W). DL&amp;W built the Ontario Secondary in 1882 (Beebee line) from Charlotte, New York (where the Genesee River flows into Lake Ontario) to Rochester, New York. By 1891, RW&amp;O became a subsidiary of NYC. On April 12, 1913, the RW&amp;O was formally merged into the NYC.

In 20th century timetables for the New York Central Railroad (NYC), the line was referred to as the St. Lawrence Division. Revenue passenger service was operated from the NYC&#x27;s &quot;Water Level Route&quot; mainline. Coach passengers for the route to Watertown, Potsdam and on to Massena changed trains at Syracuse. Passengers for the branch splitting off the route at Philadelphia, New York for Ogdensburg changed at Syracuse. Sleeping car passengers would be able to take a continuous through-car ride. The last sleeping cars to and from New York City operated along the route in 1961, discontinued with the October schedule. The local coach service to Ogdensburg ended by October, 1961 as well. The remaining local coach service for Massena was dropped from the timetable by April, 1964.

==Legacy==
Former RW&amp;O trackage is operated by CSX (CSXT), Ontario Midland Railroad (OMID) and the Mohawk, Adirondack and Northern Railroad. Several disconnected sections of the former line have also been converted to trails, including the Webster Hojack Trail, Cayuga Hojack Trail, Maple City Trail in Ogdensburg, Harbor Rail Trail in Oswego and additional sections in Hamlin, Hilton and Rochester, New York. 

The RW&amp;O had terminals in Suspension Bridge, Rochester, Syracuse, Rome, Utica, Natural Bridge, Massena, Ogdensburg, Clayton, Cape Vincent and Sackets Harbor.

== &quot;Hojack&quot; nickname==
The RW&amp;O was nicknamed the &quot;Hojack&quot;, but its origins have multiple explanations.

#&quot;Hojack&quot; originated from the engineer of the first train, who was named Jack Welch (often called &quot;Big Jack&quot;). Welch used to be a farmer and was more familiar with horses than steam locomotives. When he stopped the trains he would shout &quot;Whoa Jack!&quot;. This became Hojack over time.
#Many people fondly called the RW&amp;O by its nickname, &quot;Hojack.&quot; In the early days of the railroad, a farmer in his buckboard drawn by a bulky mule was caught on a crossing at train time. When the mule was halfway across the tracks, he stopped. The train was fast approaching and the farmer naturally got excited and began shouting, &quot;Ho-Jack, Ho-Jack.&quot; Amused by the incident, the trainmen began calling their line the &quot;Ho-Jack.&quot;

Considerable mystery has always surrounded the origin of the nickname &quot;Hojack&quot; applied to the R. W. &amp; O. division. Railroad men, when asked, seemed to have but a vague idea of the reason of the term. In a letter to the Oswego Bulletin, a writer who signs himself as an &quot;Old Engineer,&quot; writes: &quot;I noticed recently in an Oswego paper there was some doubt as to the origin of the word &#x27;Hojack&#x27; as applied to the R, W. &amp; O. division of the New York Central railroad. There are a few persons on the railroad who know how the name came to be applied, but I happen to know the exact circumstances. Along in the early 70&#x27;s a man named Royal and one John Tobin were employed by the R., W. &amp; O. railroad in running trains between Lewiston and Suspension Bridge. Royal was a gruff, genial fellow and was well liked by the railroad men at the bridge. It was his habit, when after having delivered his cars at the bridge, he was ready to return, to stand
at the officer door and call out to his partner in stentorian tones. &#x27;Ho, Jack, time to be going back.&#x27; The man and the voice became inseparably connected with the railroad and when his train appeared the men would say, &#x27;Here comes the hojack.&#x27; The name sticks to the road and the R., W. &amp; O., is now better known among railroad men as the &#x27;Hojack&#x27; than it is by its corporate name.&quot;

Author Richard Palmer attributes it to a slang term for a slow local passenger train or way freight. The &quot;Port Jervis Evening Gazette&quot; reported, &quot;[w]hile the Hojack was backing down to the depot Wednesday afternoon a horse in a team attached to a wagon from the country got its foot fast between the rail and the bed of the track in a manner similar to that which a horse belonging to Thomas Cuddeback was ruined some time ago. It was with great difficulty that the horse Wednesday was saved from a similar fate. The foot was got out just in time to get out of the way of the train.&quot;

A subsequent story in the same newspaper supports that explanation, saying &quot;[t]he name Hojack, which the Gazette gave to the way train leaving here for the west at 1:30 in the afternoon, sticks closer than a brother, and the train is now generally known by that name.&quot; NYC attempted to ban the name by way of an edict released in 1906.

<text>The Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton is an American high-altitude long endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developed for and flown by the United States Navy and Royal Australian Air Force as a surveillance aircraft. Together with its associated ground control station, it is an unmanned aircraft system (UAS). Developed under the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) program, the Triton is intended to provide real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions (ISR) over vast ocean and coastal regions, continuous maritime surveillance, conduct search and rescue missions, and to complement the Boeing P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft.

Triton builds on elements of the RQ-4 Global Hawk; changes include reinforcements to the airframe and wing, de-icing systems, and lightning protection systems. These allow the aircraft to descend through cloud layers to gain a closer view of ships and other targets at sea. The sensor suites help track ships by gathering their speed, location, and classification.

The MQ-4C System Development and Demonstration (SDD) aircraft was delivered in 2012 and the MQ-4C was expected to be operational with the US Navy by late 2015 with a total of 67 aircraft to be procured for the US Navy. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the MQ-4C was achieved in 2018 with Full Operating Capability (FOC) planned in 2023. Australia has ordered four Tritons, with the first entering service in June 2024.

===Contract competition===
The competitors for the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) contract included:
* Boeing, with an unmanned version of the Gulfstream G550 business jet. It was optionally manned and has &quot;commonality with other Boeing-built naval aircraft.&quot;
* Northrop Grumman, with a navalized RQ-4 Global Hawk. In order to begin testing the surveillance package early, Northrop Grumman contracted with Flight Test Associates of the Mojave Spaceport to modify a Grumman Gulfstream II as a flying testbed. California based aerospace company Swift Engineering also supported Northrop Grumman on the design and manufacturing of composite structures.
* Lockheed Martin, with a General Atomics MQ-9 Mariner

The BAMS UAS was acquired for the U.S. Navy as a Department of Defense Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program and on 22 April 2008, Northrop Grumman received the BAMS contract worth $1.16 billion. Lockheed Martin filed a formal protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) two weeks later. On 11 August 2008 the GAO upheld the Navy&#x27;s selection of Northrop Grumman. In September 2010, the BAMS aircraft was designated the MQ-4C.

===Initial development===
During the official unveiling ceremony on 14 June 2012 at Palmdale, California, Navy officials announced that the aircraft had been named Triton. The first flight of the MQ-4C—aircraft Bureau Number (BuNo) 168457—occurred on 22 May 2013, followed by test flights at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. Initial operational capability (IOC) was planned for December 2015 but slipped to 2017.

The U.S. Navy planned to buy 68 MQ-4Cs and 117 P-8As to replace its aging P-3C Orions. About 40 MQ-4Cs will be based at various sites, predominantly home stations or overseas deployment sites for Navy P-8A and P-3C aircraft. This includes an unspecified location in Hawaii (most likely MCAS Kaneohe Bay); NAS Jacksonville, Florida; Kadena Air Base, Japan; NAS Point Mugu, California, and NAS Sigonella, Italy. The &quot;Air Force Times&quot; reported on 14 September 2012, that the system will also be stationed at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam.

In August 2013, the Navy paused the development of the &quot;sense and avoid&quot; radar system that would enable the MQ-4C to avoid other aircraft. The Triton would have been the first unmanned aircraft to be fitted with such a system, but the system was behind schedule and over budget. The radar system remains a requirement in the program, but budgetary and technology pressures have forced the Navy to defer integrating it onto the aircraft. The Navy and Northrop Grumman are working to determine when the sense-and-avoid system can be included into the production line.

The Navy restarted the competition for a sense-and-avoid radar for the Triton in November 2014 with less ambitious requirements, including the ability to use data from ground radars as it approaches an airport, and a modular and scalable design that can be incrementally improved to meet evolving future operational and air traffic management requirements.

On 6 September 2013, the Navy awarded Northrop Grumman a $9.98 million contract for maintenance and support of the MQ-4C SDD aircraft to enable it to fly 15 missions per month, an increase from 9 per month as previously planned, with senior Navy commanders wanting to keep closer surveillance of activities in the ocean and coastal regions of the Middle East.

The Navy began considering in September 2014 cutting the number of Tritons it plans to buy. The intention was to have 20 MQ-4C aircraft operational at any one time, with the rest of the 68-plane order force being spares. In September 2015, the DoD Inspector General found the 70-aircraft force requirement justified. But the Navy decided in May 2023 to reduce the number of MQ-4C aircraft it would procure. The number of deployment sites was reduced from five to three, reducing the number of Tritons required to 12. Another 15 will be available for attrition, training, and maintenance for a revised total program of record procurement of 27 aircraft.

===International sales===
====Australia====

Australia has considered the MQ-4C, both as a military platform and as customs enforcement platform; senior customs officials have doubted the effectiveness of the planned seven MQ-4Cs to detect small boats in the country&#x27;s northern waters, especially through cloud cover. In 2013, Air Marshall Geoff Brown, head of the Royal Australian Air Force, stated that Australia was considering purchasing more manned P-8A Poseidon aircraft and reducing the number of MQ-4Cs planned to be bought for the RAAF.

On 16 February 2014, it was reported that the Australian government would seek the purchase of seven Tritons; in addition to locating ships and aircraft, it would also be used to detect seaborne asylum seekers. Alongside the P-8A, the MQ-4C is to replace the elderly AP-3C Orion fleet.

On 13 March 2014, Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced Australia&#x27;s intention to buy the MQ-4C Triton and become its first foreign customer. The announcement was made at RAAF Base Edinburgh, the base of the country&#x27;s fleet of eighteen AP-3C Orion aircraft it will replace. The Triton buy is part of the Australian Defence Force&#x27;s Project Air 7000 two-phase Orion replacement program; Phase 1B entails procuring the Triton, and Phase 2B was the acquisition of eight to twelve manned P-8A Poseidons in 2017. RAAF Tritons and Poseidons will be used in a similar complementary fashion as with U.S. Navy operations, where the MQ-4C performs high-altitude broad area maritime surveillance missions, allowing the P-8A to be more dedicated to anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, search and rescue response, and electronic intelligence missions.

The Australian Government confirmed in its 2016 Defence White Paper that the Royal Australian Air Force was to acquire seven MQ-4C Triton aircraft as part of its &quot;Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance capability stream&quot;.

On 26 June 2018, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the purchase of the first of six MQ-4C Tritons with consideration being given to purchase a seventh.

As of 2023, Australia had placed orders for four Tritons. A further two or three may be ordered in the future to meet a RAAF requirement for six to seven of the type. No. 9 Squadron was re-raised to operate the Tritons in June 2023, ahead of the expected delivery of the RAAF&#x27;s first Triton in 2024. The first RAAF Triton arrived in Australia on 16 June 2024.

====India====
Northrop Grumman has also proposed the MQ-4C to India; the Indian Navy have considered the UAV in a complementary role to the twelve Boeing P-8I Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft it has on order.

====Rumored sales====
On 20 July 2014 there was a rumor that the UK planned to purchase a minimum eight MQ-4Cs to replace the cancelled BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 after defence chiefs stated that the UK&#x27;s nuclear deterrent Trident may have been compromised to the Russians. In the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 there was no such mention of a buy and that report is negated.

Norway will develop and operate maritime surveillance drones from Andøya Air Station, and the MQ-4C is rumored to be the main contender for the initial capability.

=== Cancelled orders ===

====Germany====
In January 2015, the German Luftwaffe began considering the Triton to fill their signals intelligence needs as a continuation of the cancelled Global Hawk-based EuroHawk program. After the retirement of the German Navy&#x27;s five Br.1150 Atlantique aircraft in 2010, the EuroHawk was intended to fill the SIGINT gap, but was cancelled in May 2013 after spending €600 million ($750 million) from concerns of its ability to satisfy airworthiness regulations to permit flight over civil airspace in Europe.

With about half of the investment on the electronic intelligence and communications intelligence sensors, Germany is trying to get some form of the program into service. Using the Triton would ease integration by keeping the sensors in the same place, gondolas hung under the wings, which limited attempts to put them on other airframes due to reception problems with nearby engine placement. With icing and lightning-strike protection already included, the MQ-4C would have a better chance of achieving safety certification to fly over inhabited areas of Europe that previously ended the EuroHawk. The German Defence Ministry confirmed in March 2017 that it had decided to buy the MQ-4C to replace the EuroHawk program, with deliveries occurring after 2025.

The German government has decided to purchase several modified Bombardier Global 6000 aircraft modified for the role instead of the Triton after officials became convinced that the Global Hawk derivatives would be unable to meet the safety standards needed for flying through European airspace. Manned aircraft like the envisioned Global 6000 are allowed to routinely fly alongside civilian traffic.

==Design==
The MQ-4C can remain aloft more than 30 hours at at speeds of up to . Its surveillance sensor is the AN/ZPY-3 Multi-Function Active Sensor (MFAS) X-band AESA radar with a 360-degree field-of-regard, capable of surveying of sea (as well as shoreline or land) in a 24-hour period, or in a single sweep. Using the radar in inverse synthetic aperture mode, the MFAS can identify a target in all weather conditions.

It can take high definition radar pictures, then use the advanced image and radar return recognition software of the onboard Automatic Identification System (AIS) to classify it without the intervention of aircraft operators. The Triton is semi-autonomous to conserve manpower, so operators only need to choose an operating area for the aircraft, and set speed, altitude, and objective rather than operating controls.

One thing the Triton was designed to do (that the Global Hawk cannot) is rapidly descend to lower altitudes. It is built with a more robust lower fuselage to withstand hail, bird, and lightning strikes. It is equipped with anti-icing systems on its wings. At low altitude, the Triton would use its Raytheon MTS-B multi-spectral EO/IR sensor (also used on the MQ-9 Reaper) which is equipped with additional laser designator, pointer, and range finding abilities capable of automatically tracking what the MFAS detects. The optical suite can stream live video to ground forces.

The Triton is equipped with a modular electronic support measures (ESM) suite, similar to the one used on the Lockheed EP-3, to passively detect and classify faint radar signals. It is able to triangulate and geo-locate these signals, allowing mission planners to create an enemy &quot;electronic order of battle&quot; profile, or keep the aircraft and others outside the range of enemy radars and air defenses. Detecting and locating the source of radar signals would also be useful for locating military vessels at sea for potential targeting. Low- and high-band signals receivers to give it a multi-INT (SIGINT) capability will be fielded in 2021 as part of an integrated functional capability (IFC) 4 configuration; further changes are planned for IFC 5 upgrade in 2024.

Another aspect of the MQ-4C is its ability to act as a network relay and data fusion center, able to receive and transmit messages from around a theater of operations between various sources not within line-of-sight of each other. It can take what ships, planes, and land sensors are seeing and broadcasting through various data-links and fuse that information together to create a common &quot;picture&quot; of the battlespace, which it can rebroadcast. This capability greatly increases interoperability, situational awareness, targeting efficiency, and sensor picture clarity, while providing an alternative to satellite-based communications systems.

==Operational history==

===Flight testing===
The MQ-4C Triton performed its first flight on 22 May 2013 from United States Air Force Plant 42 / Palmdale Regional Airport, California. The flight lasted 1 hour 20 minutes and the aircraft reached an altitude of 20,000 ft.

On 6 January 2014, Northrop Grumman announced that the MQ-4C had completed 9 test flights with 46 hours of flight time. Half of its envelope expansion testing, which included evaluating the aircraft at different altitudes, speeds, and weights, had been completed. Some flights lasted over 9 hours and reached 50,000 ft. A second Triton aircraft was to fly by March or April 2014. Initial envelope expansion testing was completed in March 2014 through 13 flights, 81 flight hours, and reaching altitudes of 59,900 ft.

On 18 September 2014, the Triton successfully conducted an 11-hour cross-country flight from Northrop Grumman&#x27;s Palmdale, California facility to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. The cross-country flight test had been previously postponed twice due to bad weather. The aircraft flew a pre-approved instrument route along the southern U.S. border, crossing the Gulf of Mexico and Florida, then was directed north along the Atlantic coast and up the Chesapeake Bay, a distance of at to avoid commercial air traffic.

A test fleet of three Tritons completed 15 flights demonstrating speed and altitude capabilities prior to the transcontinental mission. With the completion of the cross-country flight, the MQ-4C program transitions from initial safety flight testing to validating its ability to perform operational missions over the ocean. Operations from Patuxent River in the coming weeks will test the aircraft&#x27;s sensors, communications, interoperability, and expanded envelope flight coverage. The three test Tritons are scheduled to fly a total of 2,000 hours before reaching initial operating capability.

The second MQ-4C Triton model flew on 16 October 2014, 17 months after the first model&#x27;s first flight. It is being prepped to perform the cross-country flight later in the month that the first aircraft performed the previous month. A third model is also being prepared to start flights; the third was planned to be funded by the Navy but was lost to budget cuts, so Northrop Grumman decided to self-fund production of the third prototype.

===Fleet operational evaluation and introduction===
On 7 February 2013, the U.S. Navy announced that it would initiate the Unmanned Patrol Squadron Nineteen (VUP-19) at NAS Jacksonville, Florida on 1 October 2013, to eventually operate the MQ-4C as the Navy&#x27;s first Triton squadron. A detachment of VUP-19 will also be established at NAS Point Mugu, California. VUP-19 will fall under the administrative control of Commander, Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing ELEVEN (CPRW-11) at NAS Jacksonville, where an MQ-4C mission control facility is also under construction, and will initially operate the Triton on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions for the U.S. 5th Fleet in the Southwest Asia/Middle East/East Africa region, the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic, the U.S. 7th Fleet in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean, and U.S. Fleet Forces Command in western Atlantic operations. In 2014, the Navy will activate a second Triton squadron, VUP-11, to take over operations in the Pacific in support of U.S. 7th Fleet and share U.S. 5th Fleet operations with VUP-19.

On 17 November 2015, the MQ-4C began a two-month operational assessment that will determine Milestone C approval and the start of low-rate initial production. In February 2016 the U.S. Navy confirmed that the MQ-4C had completed Operational Assessment, putting the Triton in line to achieve a Milestone C decision in spring 2016, leading to low rate production. An integrated test team made up of Navy personnel from Air Test and Evaluation Sqdns. VX-1 and VX-20, Unmanned Patrol Sqdn., VUP-19 and Northrop Grumman demonstrated Triton&#x27;s reliability over approximately sixty flight hours.

The Navy&#x27;s fiscal 2017 budget request includes 19 MQ-4 Tritons through fiscal 2021, with first deployment to the Pacific in fiscal 2017. The tests evaluated the MQ-4C&#x27;s key sensors – an active electronically scanned array radar, an electro-optic/infrared camera and a hydrocarbon detector – over different altitudes and ranges, analysing the &quot;system&#x27;s ability to classify targets and disseminate critical data&quot;, according to Northrop.

In 2013, the U.S. Navy noted quality control issues in the MQ-4C&#x27;s wings, which Northrop Grumman stated to have fixed by 2016.

On 12 December 2019, the U.S. Navy stated that one of its RQ-4A Global Hawk aircraft had been damaged during a takeoff in the Middle East in November 2019. The craft, which cost $123 million in 2015, was estimated by USNI to be valued at $180 million by 2019.

On 26 January 2020, VUP-19 deployed the MQ-4C for the first time, with two aircraft sent to Anderson AFB in Guam.

==== Iranian shoot-down ====
On 20 June 2019, Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down an RQ-4A drone in the Strait of Hormuz near Kuhmobarak in Iran&#x27;s southern province of Hormozgan. Iran claimed it was in their airspace, while the U.S. claimed it was in international airspace. Fox News cited an alleged anonymous U.S. official as a source that the drone had been an MQ-4C Triton, but the U.S. Central Command later confirmed it was a BAMS-D, a prototype version of the RQ-4A drone, developed during the development of the MQ-4C. In total, four of these prototype aircraft were built, and they had been assigned to the Navy&#x27;s Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) program.

<text>Boy: Tales of Childhood (1984) is an autobiography written by British writer Roald Dahl. This book describes his life from early childhood until leaving school, focusing on living conditions in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s, the public school system at the time, and how his childhood experiences led him to writing children&#x27;s books as a career. It concludes with his first job, working for Royal Dutch Shell. His life story continues in the book &quot;Going Solo&quot;. 

An expanded edition titled More About Boy was published in 2008, featuring the full original text and illustrations with annotations by Dahl&#x27;s widow Felicity along with additional stories, letters, and photographs.

==Key points in the story==

===Dahl&#x27;s ancestry===
Roald Dahl&#x27;s father Harald Dahl and mother Sofie Hesselberg were Norwegians who emigrated to Wales before World War I, and settled in Cardiff. 

Harald and his brother Oscar, who were born in the 1860s, split up and went their separate ways after deciding that a better future lay before them outside their native Norway. Oscar headed to La Rochelle, France.

Harald had suffered an unfortunate accident as a teenager in the late 1870s, breaking his left arm by fixing the ceiling tiles of the family home and then falling off the ladder. A doctor was summoned, but was drunk on arrival and mistook the fractured arm for a dislocated shoulder. The doctor&#x27;s attempt to relocate the shoulder failed, causing Harald to scream in agony. Harald&#x27;s mother was a visitor at Harald&#x27;s hospital room and viewed the scene in shock. By the time she told the doctors to stop, Harald&#x27;s arm was very damaged. The doctors realised they had made a mistake, and the only way to not keep him in that condition was to amputate his left arm. Harald lived with one arm for the rest of his life, but he did not let the lack of a second arm hinder him; even fashioning a special sharpened fork to aid in eating, his only serious limitation being his inability to cut the top off a boiled egg.

Harald Dahl had two children by his first wife, Marie, who died shortly after the birth of their second child. He then married Sofie Magdalene Hesselberg, Roald&#x27;s mother. Harald was more than 20 years older than Sofie; he was born in 1863 and she was born in 1885. By the time Roald Dahl was born in 1916, his father was 53 years old.

===Family tragedy===
In 1920, when Roald Dahl was only three years old, his seven-year-old sister Astri died from complications from appendicitis. Only weeks later, Roald&#x27;s father died of pneumonia aged 57, shortly before the birth of Dahl’s youngest sister. As the book&#x27;s narrator, Dahl suggests his father died of grief from losing his daughter. Roald&#x27;s widowed mother was faced with the choice of moving the family back to Norway to be near her family or relocating to a smaller house in Wales to continue the children&#x27;s education in the United Kingdom. She soon came to the decision to remain in South Wales, as she was determined that her children should be educated in English schools, as their father had always stated that English schools were the best in the world.

===Primary school===
Roald Dahl started at the Elm Tree House Primary School in Cardiff in 1921, when he was five years old. He was there for a year, but had few memories of his time there.

===Sweets===
Roald writes about different confectionery, his love of sweets, his fascination with the local sweet shop (11 High Street, Llandaff), and in particular, about the free samples of Cadbury chocolate bars given to him and his schoolmates much later when he was a pupil at Repton School. Young Dahl dreamt of working as an inventor for Cadbury, an idea he said later inspired &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, eventually published in the early 1960s. Some of the sweets he enjoyed as a child were lemon sherbets, pear drops, and liquorice boot laces.

===Great mouse plot of 1924===
From the age of eight, Dahl attended Llandaff Cathedral School in Cardiff. He and his friends thoroughly disliked the local sweet-shop owner, Mrs Pratchett, an unpleasant, elderly woman who gave no thought to hygiene (and described by Dahl&#x27;s biographer, Donald Sturrock, as &quot;a comic distillation of the two witchlike sisters who, it seems, ran the shop in real life&quot;). They played a prank on her by placing a dead mouse in a gobstopper jar while his friend Thwaites distracted her by buying sweets. They were caned by the headmaster as a punishment, after Mrs Pratchett identified Dahl and his friends as the pupils who were responsible for the mouse in the jar.

Mrs Pratchett, who sat in the headmaster&#x27;s office to watch the canings, was not satisfied after the first stroke was delivered and insisted the headmaster should cane much harder, which he did: four of the hardest strokes he could muster while Mrs Pratchett beamed with great delight as each boy suffered his punishment. Dahl’s mother was outraged when she discovered that her son had been caned, and went to confront the school’s headmaster, who advised her to transfer Roald to another school if she disapproved of his methods.

===St Peter&#x27;s School, Weston-super-Mare===
From the age of nine, Dahl attended St Peter&#x27;s School, a boarding school in Weston-super-Mare, where he would remain for four years. Among many other tales, he describes having received six strokes of the cane after being accused of cheating. In the essay &quot;The Life Story of a Penny&quot;, he claims that he still has the essay nearly 60 years on, and that he had been doing well until the nib of his pen broke — fountain pens were not permitted at the school. He whispered to his friend in hope of obtaining a spare nib, when the master, Captain Hardcastle, heard him and accused him of cheating, issuing him with a &quot;stripe&quot;, meaning that the next morning he received six strokes of the cane from the headmaster, who refused to believe Dahl&#x27;s version of events on the basis of Captain Hardcastle&#x27;s status. Captain “Hardcastle” was later in fact revealed to be Captain Stephen Lancaster (1894–1971), a Great War veteran who was still teaching at the school in the early 1960s, and was also remembered by future notable pupils including John Cleese and Charles Higham.

Many of the events he recalls from the school involved the matron. She once sprinkled soap shavings into the mouth of a pupil called Tweedie, to stop him from snoring. She also sent an eight-year-old boy, who had allegedly thrown a sponge across the dormitory, to the headmaster. Still in his pyjamas and dressing gown, the little boy then received six strokes of the cane. Wragg, another boy in Dahl&#x27;s dormitory, sprinkled sugar over the corridor floor so they could hear that the matron was coming when she walked upon it. When the boy&#x27;s friends refused to turn him in, the whole school was punished by the headmaster, who for the remainder of the term confiscated the keys to their tuck boxes containing food parcels which the pupils had received from their families. In the end, he returns home to his family for Christmas.

===Repton and Shell Oil Company===
As Dahl came to the end of his time at St Peter&#x27;s, Roald&#x27;s mother entered him for either Marlborough or Repton, but he chose Repton because it was easier to pronounce. Dahl soon realized that Marlborough may have been a better choice, as life at Repton was difficult and cruel. The prefects, named Boazers as per school tradition, were utmost sadists and patrolled the school like secret police, and also had the power to cane younger pupils.

The headmaster treated students similarly, and Dahl describes an occasion when his friend received several brutal strokes of the cane from the headmaster as punishment for misbehaviour. According to Dahl, this headmaster was Geoffrey Francis Fisher, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of London in 1939. However, according to Dahl&#x27;s biographer, Jeremy Treglown, Dahl&#x27;s memory was in error: the beating took place in May 1933, a year after Fisher had left Repton. The headmaster concerned was in fact John Traill Christie, Fisher&#x27;s successor.

Despite his difficulties at school, Dahl did make friends with the Maths professor and a pupil called Michael. Even one of the Boazers, Wilberforce, took a liking to Dahl. Despite it being punishment for Dahl&#x27;s tardiness, Wilberforce was so impressed by how Dahl warmed his lavatory seat that he hired him as his personal lavatory warmer. Dahl also excelled in sports and photography, something he says impressed various masters at the school.

Towards the end of his time, Dahl purchased a motorbike for £18 and stored it in a local garage, often riding it around the streets of Repton and the Derbyshire countryside, and would pass the school&#x27;s masters and Boazers on their lunch breaks, without them knowing who he was.

On leaving school in 1934, Dahl declined the opportunity to apply for university and instead secured a position working for Shell, despite the headmaster trying to dissuade him because of his lack of responsibility. Dahl was nonetheless entered into the business and toured Britain in the job. He became a businessman in London and was content. However, he took a trip across Newfoundland with some other boys and a man who had travelled to Antarctica with Scott; Dahl describes Newfoundland as &quot;not much of a country&quot;. He was then assigned to go to Africa, but declined Egypt because it was &quot;too dusty&quot;. The manager instead selected Dahl for East Africa, delighting him. The book ends with Dahl setting off to Africa, unknowing of the ascension of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany, a man who would soon split the world in two, sparking a Second World War in which Dahl would ultimately fight and suffer a near-fatal accident which left him in hospital for six months. He would later document these adventures in more detail in Going Solo.

<doc id="894970" wikidata="Q1426258" url="?curid=894970" title="James and the Giant Peach">
<text>James and the Giant Peach is a children&#x27;s novel written in 1961 by British author Roald Dahl. The first edition, published by Alfred Knopf, featured illustrations by Nancy Ekholm Burkert. There have been re-illustrated versions of it over the years, done by Michael Simeon (for the first British edition), Emma Chichester Clark, Lane Smith and Quentin Blake. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1996 (with Smith being a conceptual designer) which was directed by Henry Selick, and a musical in 2010.

The plot centres on a young English orphan boy who enters a gigantic, magical peach, and has a wild and surreal cross-world adventure with seven magically altered garden bugs he meets. Dahl was originally going to write about a giant cherry, but changed it to &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; because a peach is &quot;prettier, bigger and squishier than a cherry&quot;. Because of the story&#x27;s occasional macabre and potentially frightening content, it has become a regular target of censors.

Dahl dedicated the book to his six-year-old daughter Olivia, who died from complications of measles only a year after the book was published.

American novelist Bret Easton Ellis has cited &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; as his favourite children&#x27;s book:

==Plot summary==
James Henry Trotter is a boy who lives happily with his parents in a house by the sea in the south of England. Unfortunately, when he is four years old, an oddly carnivorous raging rhinoceros escapes from the London Zoo and eats James&#x27; parents whilst they are on a shopping trip in the capital. He ends up living with his two cruel aunts, Aunty Spiker and Aunty Sponge. Instead of caring for him, they physically and verbally abuse him, isolate him in their ramshackle hilltop house and garden, dole out sadistic punishments for the smallest infractions, force him to sleep on bare floorboards in a prison cell-like room, and force him to do heavy chores most of the time that they never bother doing themselves (they also do not call him by his real name, but insults like &quot;you disgusting little beast&quot; or &quot;you miserable creature&quot;).

One day, after James has been living with his aunts for three years, he meets a mysterious man who gives him a bag of magical crystals, instructing James to use them in a potion that would change his life for the better. While returning home, James stumbles and spills the bag on the ground, losing the crystals as they dig themselves underground. A nearby barren peach tree, in turn, produces a single peach which soon grows to the size of a house. Spiker and Sponge build a fence around it and earn money by selling viewing tickets to tourists; James is locked in the house, only able to see the peach and the crowds through the bars of his bedroom window.

After the tourists have gone, James is assigned to clean the rubbish around the peach and finds a hole inside it. He crawls in, through a tunnel, and he finds himself in a room, in the enlarged peach pit. There, he meets Centipede, Miss Spider, Old Green Grasshopper, Earthworm, Ladybug, Glowworm, and Silkworm who become his friends.

The next day, Centipede cuts the stem of the peach, causing it to roll away and crush James&#x27; aunts. It reaches the sea and is surrounded by ravenous sharks. James uses Miss Spider and Silkworm to make threads, while Earthworm is used as bait and draws 501 seagulls to the peach, whereupon the threads are tied on their necks. The peach is lifted off the water. High above the clouds, the peach encounters the Cloud-Men, who are portrayed as responsible for weather phenomena like hailstorms and rainbows. Centipede mocks the Cloud-Men, who throw things at the group until they get clear.

Later, James realizes that the group has reached New York City. The wing of a passing plane severs the strings, and the falling peach lands on the spire of the Empire State Building. It is mistaken for a bomb at first, resulting in the arrival of police and firemen. Calming the crowd, James tells his story, and becomes friends with many children in New York; they eat the peach and James and his friends get their own jobs, now residing in Central Park, in the pit of the peach.

==2023 censorship controversy==

Despite Roald Dahl having enjoined his publishers not to &quot;so much as change a single comma in one of my books&quot;, in February 2023 Puffin Books, a division of Penguin Books, announced it would be re-writing portions of many of Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s novels, changing the language to, in the publisher&#x27;s words, &quot;ensure that it can continue to be enjoyed by all today&quot;. The decision was met with sharp criticism from groups and public figures including authors Salman Rushdie and Christopher Paolini, British prime minister Rishi Sunak, Queen Camilla, Kemi Badenoch, PEN America, and Brian Cox. Dahl&#x27;s publishers in the United States, France, and the Netherlands announced they had declined to incorporate the changes.

In &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, more than seventy changes were made, such as removing references to Sponge as fat (including writing an entirely new poem), changing &quot;queer&quot; to &quot;strange&quot;, removing references to skin colour (such as &quot;his face white with horror&quot;, &quot;looking white and thin&quot;, and the Earthworm&#x27;s &quot;lovely pink skin&quot;), and changing &quot;Cloud-Men&quot; to &quot;Cloud-People&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Film adaptations===

A television adaptation of the novel appeared on BBC One on December 28, 1976. Paul Stone directed a script by Trever Preston. The cast included Simon Bell playing James, Bernard Cribbins playing Centipede, and Anna Quayle playing Aunt Spiker.

Though Roald Dahl declined numerous offers during his life to have a film version of &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; produced, his widow, Felicity Dahl, approved an offer to have a film adaptation produced in conjunction with Disney in the mid-1990s. It was directed by Henry Selick and produced by Denise Di Novi and Tim Burton, all of whom previously made &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. The movie consists of live action and stop-motion to reduce production finances. It was narrated by Pete Postlethwaite (who also played the old man) and featured five songs composed and written by Randy Newman. The film was released on April 12, 1996. Although it was a box office failure, it received positive reviews and eventually became a cult classic upon its release on home video.

There are numerous changes in both the plot of the film and the plot of the book (notably, the aunts survive the rolling peach and follow James all the way to New York City), though the film was generally well-received. Felicity Dahl said that, &quot;I think Roald would have been delighted with what they did with James.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the animated part, but calling the live-action segments &quot;crude&quot;. Newman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score.

In August 2016, Sam Mendes was in negotiations with Disney to direct another live action adaptation of the novel, with Nick Hornby in talks for the script. In May 2017, Mendes was no longer attached to the project due to his entering talks with Disney about directing a live-action film adaptation of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;.

===Musical adaptation===
The book was made into a musical with music and lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and book by Timothy Allen McDonald. The musical had its premiere at Goodspeed Musicals on 21 October 2010, and is currently produced in regional and youth theatre.

=== Stage adaptation ===
David Wood&#x27;s play based on James and the Giant Peach has been performed worldwide. It was first produced in 2001 by the Sherman Theatre, Cardiff and Birmingham Stage Company, who then toured it all over the UK. Other major productions have been mounted by West Yorkshire Playhouse and Polka Theatre, and it is very popular with community and amateur companies in the UK and US. The play is published and licensed by Concord Theatricals.

=== Theatrical adaptation ===
Ray DaSilva&#x27;s Norwich Puppet Theatre put on puppet theatre performances in 1985.

===Audiobooks===
The book has been recorded a number of times, including:
* 1977 - by Roald Dahl himself for Caedmon Records (TC-1543 [abridged LP]/CDL 51543 [abridged cassette])
* 2003 – by Jeremy Irons for Harper Children&#x27;s Audio
* 2016 – by Julian Rhind-Tutt for Puffin Audio

===Charity readings===
In May 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Taika Waititi, the Oscar-winning director, worked with the Roald Dahl Story Company to publish audio-visual readings of the book. Waititi was joined by Oscar-winning actresses Meryl Streep, Lupita Nyong&#x27;o, and Cate Blanchett; actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Liam and Chris Hemsworth, Ryan Reynolds; the Duchess of Cornwall, and others in ten installments which were then published to the Roald Dahl YouTube channel.

The event was organised to raise money for the global-non profit Partners In Health, founded by Dahl&#x27;s daughter Ophelia, which had been fighting COVID-19 in vulnerable areas; with Roald Dahl Story Co. committing to match donations up to $1million. Waititi had already been working with the company as the writer, director, and executive producer for Netflix&#x27;s upcoming serialised adaption of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

<text>Uffa Fox CBE (15 January 1898 – 26 October 1972) was an English boat designer and sailing enthusiast, responsible for a number of innovations in boat design. Not afraid of courting controversy or causing offence, he is remembered for his eccentric behaviour and pithy quotes, as much as for his original boat designs.

==Life==

Fox was born on the Isle of Wight and was raised in East Cowes. He lived for a while in Puckaster on the Isle of Wight.

In July 1921, Fox and a crew of nine sea scouts departed for the western Solent in a open whaler under the parental expectation that they were on a camping/sailing trip. He decided to extend the itinerary up the Seine towards Paris. In seven days, they travelled within 70 kilometres of the city when they turned around to return another five days later. After being met by the coast guard as presumed castaways, Fox was relieved of his role in the sea scouts.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in January 1963 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Colston Hall in Bristol.
He was also among the crew of the &quot;Typhoon&quot;, an account of which was written and published by William Washburn Nutting in &quot;In the Track of Typhoon&quot; (1922). Fox joined the crew in England for her transatlantic return via France, Spain, and the Azores into New York City.

He was a founding participant in the 1950s annual sea-side cricket match on Bramble Bank in the central Solent.

Fox died in October 1972.

==Work==

Fox was responsible for innovations in dinghy sailing that enhanced the popularity of the sport. His designs introduced planing hulls and trapezing to dinghy racing.

=== Sailboat racing ===
Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Fox became friends in 1949 and raced together frequently at Cowes Week aboard Fox&#x27;s Dragon &quot;&quot;Fresh Breeze&quot; or the Duke&#x27;s &#x27;Royal&#x27; Dragon &quot;Bluebottle&quot;&quot;. He also took the Royal children sailing at Cowes. Philip said of Fox in a foreword to his biography, “His life was one long campaign for the freedom of the human spirit and against the foolish, the stupid and the self-important, the whole conducted with a cheerful breeziness that disarmed all but the hardest of cases.”

=== Boat design ===

About 1943 he designed a lifeboat to be dropped from Vickers Warwick aircraft when rescuing downed aircrew or mariners; its deficiencies led to the more sturdy American A-1 lifeboat. An example of this craft and of others built and/or designed by Fox are in the collections of the Classic Boat Museum at East Cowes, Isle of Wight. These boats could be released from under the aeroplane retarded by six diameter parachutes. Although initially adapted for the Warwick, the lifeboat was subsequently also carried by Air-Sea Rescue Lancasters and B-17 Flying Fortresses. The museum also holds a large collection of photographs by and about Fox.

He established boat design and building businesses in the south of England. He designed many of the significant classes of boats around today, including the planing International 14, the Foxhound, the Foxcub and Super Foxcub, the Flying Fifteen, the Flying Ten, the National 12, the National 18, the Albacore, the Swordfish, the Firefly, the Javelin, the Pegasus Dinghy, the Jollyboat and the Day Sailer. Many of his designs exploited the wartime developments of moulded plywood, extruded aluminium, Tufnol etc.

In addition to dinghies, he designed several keelboats all loosely based on the same concept as the Flying Fifteen, with separate fin keel and rudder. They were very lightweight compared with other boats of the era. &quot;Huff of Arklow&quot; for Douglas Heard was 30&#x27;-0&quot; on the waterline and &quot;Flying Fox&quot; for Fred Brownlee was 35&#x27;-0&quot; waterline length.

Uffa Fox designed the Britannia rowing boat, used by John Fairfax for the first solo-rowing expedition across the Atlantic Ocean in 1969. The Britannia was described as &quot;the of rowing boats, made of mahogany.&quot; It was self-righting, self-bailing and partly covered. He also designed &quot;Britannia II&quot;, used by Fairfax and Sylvia Cook to row across the Pacific Ocean in 1971 through 1972.

<doc id="894982" wikidata="Q6764380" url="?curid=894982" title="Mariners Harbor, Staten Island">
<text>Mariners Harbor is a neighborhood located in the northwestern part of New York City&#x27;s borough of Staten Island. It is bordered by Lake Avenue to the east, Forest Avenue to the south, Richmond Terrace to the north, and Holland Avenue to the west. The northwestern section of Mariners Harbor is often known as Arlington.

==History==
The neighborhood is named for its 19th-century harvesting of oysters and other seafood products from the Kill Van Kull, which forms the neighborhood&#x27;s northern border (Elm Park and Port Ivory lie to the east and west, respectively, while Graniteville is to the south). Later developments included shipbuilding, repair and marine salvage work. Fishing activity declined due to pollution during the 20th century. The Mariners Harbor Yacht Club remains as a reminder of the community&#x27;s maritime past. Erastina was the first rail station built here in 1886 and named for Erastus Wiman, the promoter who helped the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad to enter New York via Staten Island. Vacant land nearby was used for staging Buffalo Bill’s “Wild West Show”, generating over 10,000 additional passengers from the St. George Ferry Terminal over the new rail line. Erastina became Mariners Harbor soon after Wiman fell from public favor due to scandal and bankruptcy. There are three other stations along the North Shore branch of the Staten Island Railway at Lake Avenue, Harbor Road, and Arlington. Passenger service on this line was discontinued on March 31, 1953. An important rail customer was Arthur Dreyer &amp; Sons Lumber and Coal Co. near Union Avenue bridge. Remnants of the site are visible today by the coal silos. The western portion of this line was rebuilt, and is now used by freight trains traveling between New Jersey and the Howland Hook Marine Terminal in Port Ivory.
Mariners Harbor was home to large shipping and dry dock companies in the first half of the 20th century, including Bethlehem Steel, which owned a considerable portion of land in the area with headquarters along the waterfront on Richmond Terrace across from Mersereau Avenue and Brewers Dry Dock. Bethlehem Staten Island built United States Navy Destroyers during World War II. Currently, two tugboat companies—K-Sea and McAllister—operate in the area as do a number of smaller dry docks, Great Lakes Dredge and Dock, and Mariners Harbor Cargo Terminal. The &quot;John McAllister&quot; tug boat was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

The West Shore Little League and Public School 44 also are part of the neighborhood. The former Cross Paper Plant sits on the edge of the area and now is used as rental space for other small business. In recent years a large amount of shopping has been built up in stretch of Forest Avenue from Lake Avenue to South Avenue, revitalizing the area and bringing new traffic concerns.

Mariners Harbor is home to the newest branch of the New York Public Library system. Located at 206 South Avenue, the library was opened on December 16, 2013 as the 13th branch in Staten Island, and the 88th system-wide. The building is shaped like an oyster to reflect the neighborhood&#x27;s maritime history, and won the 2008 Award for Excellence in Design from New York City&#x27;s Design Commission. A single-story branch library situated on a 16,000-square foot plot, it serves some 30,000 people.

The ZIP Code for Mariners Harbor is 10303.

==Demographics==

The area originally populated by the Dutch and French Huguenot settlers of 17th and 18th centuries bears the famous names of those families, which include: Van Name Avenue, Van Pelt Avenue, Brabant Street, Lockman Avenue and Mersereau Avenue. The oldest church in the neighborhood is the Summerfield Methodist Church, founded in 1840. It still stands on Harbor Road and has an active multicultural congregation, reflecting the demographics of the neighborhood. On the corner of Richmond Terrace and Lockman Avenue is the Fellowship Baptist Church, which was founded by community leader Rev. Arthur D. Phillips. The church has a large black congregation and has gained considerable political influence, being visited by New York City mayors David Dinkins, Rudolph Giuliani, and Michael Bloomberg on multiple occasions during their terms of office. Other churches in the area include the Seventh Day Adventist Church and St. Clement-St.Michael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church.

From the early 1900s to the 1930s, the area became home to many Italian-Americans, who still comprise a significant percentage of its population. The neighborhood was permanently transformed, however, in 1954, when the New York City Housing Authority opened the 605-unit Mariners Harbor Houses public housing project in the heart of the community. The portion of the neighborhood west of Harbor Road (both north and south of the railroad tracks) eventually became predominantly Black. The area east of Harbor Road remained White longer, but has gradually become more Hispanic. All sections of the neighborhood have a substantial representation of Hispanics, Blacks, and Whites, with the southern portion of the neighborhood having a small Asian population. (Census Tract 231 has a 13% Asian population, a 442% increase from 2000, which was the fastest growth rate in the Asian population of any tract on Staten Island.)

The northwest portion of Staten Island (which includes Mariners Harbor) as well as the Far South Shore are the fastest growing areas of Staten Island.

<text>Lagumot Gagiemem Nimidere Harris (23 December 1938 – 8 September 1999) was a political figure from the Pacific nation of the Republic of Nauru, and served as its President. He was a cousin of René Harris, who also became Nauru president subsequently.

==President of Nauru==
===First term===
Lagumot Harris first served briefly as President of Nauru from 19 April to 15 May 1978. Thus, he was Nauru&#x27;s third head of state since its independence in 1968. In terms of Nauru&#x27;s emerging post-Independence political culture, the shortness of Harris&#x27;s first term of Presidential office anticipated the very frequent changes of President to which Nauruans were to become accustomed, in contrast with the many years of Hammer DeRoburt&#x27;s continuous first term of office.

===Second term===
Subsequently, a period of nearly twenty years elapsed before Harris assumed the Presidency of Nauru for a second term.

He was elected President of Nauru again, and served between 22 November 1995 and 11 November 1996.

Harris was Minister of Finance in the cabinet of Ruben Kun from December 1996 to February 1997.

==Issues and alignment==
Much of Lagumot Harris&#x27;s active involvement in political leadership revolved around troubled issues surrounding the veteran Nauruan politician, seven-time President Bernard Dowiyogo. It may be recalled that, especially during Harris&#x27; periods of public office and political activity, Nauru&#x27;s Parliamentary system did not have well-developed party organisations.

==Death==
Harris died in Melbourne, Australia, on 8 September 1999 at the age of 60.

<doc id="894988" wikidata="Q3036007" url="?curid=894988" title="Donald C. Peattie">
<text>Donald Culross Peattie (June 21, 1898 – November 16, 1964) was an American botanist, naturalist and author. He was described by Joseph Wood Krutch as &quot;perhaps the most widely read of all contemporary American nature writers&quot; during his heyday. His brother, Roderick Peattie (1891–1955), was a geographer and a noted author in his own right. Some have said that Peattie&#x27;s views on race may be considered regressive, but that expressions of these views are &quot;mercifully brief and hardly malicious&quot;.

==Early life==
Peattie was born in Chicago to the journalist Robert Peattie and the novelist Elia W. Peattie. He studied French poetry for two years at the University of Chicago, then tried journalism, and office work in New York. Around 1919 he traveled along the Appalachians from Virginia to New Hampshire, collecting and drawing plants. He then enrolled in – and graduated (1922) from — Harvard University, where he studied with the noted botanist Merritt Lyndon Fernald. After field work in the Southern and Mid-West United States, he worked as a botanist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (1922–1924) under David Fairchild. He was then nature columnist for the &quot;Washington Star&quot; from 1924 to 1935.

His field work for Harvard was in the Indiana dunes, which he published in 1922 and 1930. In 1928 Peattie and his wife, Louise Redfield, with their four-year-old daughter and baby son, Malcolm, moved to Paris to &quot;launch the frail bark of our careers&quot;. At two days in Paris the daughter died &quot;of a malady unsuspected and always fatal&quot;. In a &quot;search for sunlight&quot; they re-settled in Vence in the south. He wrote its history in &quot;Vence, the Story of a Provencal Town through Five Thousand Years&quot;. Another son, Mark, was born there, and son Noel was born in 1932.

After five years in France they moved to Kennicott Grove in Illinois, his wife&#x27;s childhood home, which she described in &quot;American Acres&quot;, and he described in &quot;A Prairie Grove&quot;. He also wrote &quot;An Almanac for Moderns&quot; there, which won an award from the Limited Editions Club as likely to become a classic. In July 1937 moved to Montecito, CA, where he wrote &quot;Flowering Earth&quot;. In 1942 he moved to Santa Barbara, CA.

His brother-in-law was Robert Redfield, the anthropologist.

==Later life==
Peattie was an advocate for protecting the Indiana Dunes. He served on the Save the Dunes Council in the late 1950s, helping to bring Illinois&#x27; Senator Paul Douglas into the fight to protect the Indiana Dunes from industrial development.

==Literature work==
Peattie&#x27;s nature writings are distinguished by a poetic and philosophical cast of mind and are scientifically scrupulous. His best known works are the two books (out of a planned trilogy) on North American trees, &quot;A Natural History of Trees of Eastern and Central North America&quot; (1950) and &quot;A Natural History of Western Trees&quot; (1953), with woodcut illustrations by Paul Landacre. Peattie also produced children&#x27;s and travel books, altogether totaling almost forty volumes. He also published the classic, botanical treatment on the &quot;Flora of the Indiana Dunes&quot; (1930).

An example of Peattie&#x27;s views that can be construed as racist is the following, from &quot;An Almanac for Moderns&quot;: &quot;Every species of ant has its racial characteristics. This one seems to me to be the negro of ants, and not alone from the circumstance that he is all black, but because he is the commonest victim of slavery, and seems especially susceptible to a submissive estate. He is easily impressed by the superior organization or the menacing tactics of his raiders and drivers, and, as I know him, he is relatively lazy or at least disorganized, random, feckless and witless when free in the bush, while for his masters he will work faithfully.&quot;

On the other hand, there&#x27;s a strain of at least mild anti-racism often discernible in Peattie&#x27;s commentary. For example, in his discussion of Linnaeus, the Swedish founding father of taxonomy, Peattie describes, in 1936, how Linnaeus grew up in a small, provincial town far from the scientific capitals of Europe: &quot;To the astonishment of all the wise men, he (Linnaeus) was not a product of Wittenberg, or the parks of Versailles or even of English country life, that nurse of so much delicate feeling for natural beauty. But genius so seldom grows where the highly born and the members of the eugenical societies tell us to expect it!&quot; (This is a slap against the American Eugenics Society, a national group formed in 1921, which was prominent in the 1930s, promoting &quot;racial betterment.&quot; During that time, the group consisted of &quot;mostly prominent and wealthy members who more often than not were non-scientists.&quot;)

Furthermore, according to Peattie&#x27;s grandson, David Peattie, &quot;In the period following the bombing of Pearl Harbor... [Donald Culross Peattie] spoke out eloquently against the internment of Japanese Americans, and wrote letters to the editor in their defense&quot;. That was after he witnessed a Japanese gardener, who had been hired by the owner of a house he was renting in California, interned in the camps. Thus, Peattie&#x27;s belief in the inferiority of people of African descent seems to be specific to them, and does not seem to have extended to other non-white people, nor implied a broader support of eugenics.

<doc id="894991" wikidata="Q879668" url="?curid=894991" title="Björn Ironside">
<text>Björn Ironside (Swedish: &quot;Björn Järnsida&quot;) (Old Norse: &quot;Bjǫrn Járnsíða&quot;), according to Norse legends, was a Norse Viking chief and Swedish king. According to the 12th- and 13th-century Scandinavian histories, he was the son of notorious Viking king Ragnar Lodbrok and lived in the 9th century AD, attested in 855 and 858. Björn Ironside is said to have been the first ruler of the Swedish Munsö dynasty. In the early 18th century, a barrow on the island of Munsö was claimed by antiquarians to be &quot;Björn Järnsidas hög&quot; or Björn Ironside&#x27;s barrow.

Medieval sources refer to Björn Ironside&#x27;s sons and grandsons, including Erik Björnsson and Björn at Haugi. Icelandic sagas claim that Björn was the ancestor of the house of Munsö, the line of kings that ruled in Sweden until 1060.

==Björn in Frankish sources==

&quot;Berno&quot; was a powerful Viking chieftain and naval commander. He appears in contemporary sources such as &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot; and the &quot;Chronicon Fontanellense&quot;. He is first mentioned in the summer of 855. The oldest text that details his origins is the Norman history of William of Jumièges (c. 1070). According to William, the Danes had a custom of requiring the younger sons of kings to leave the kingdom, to reinforce the king&#x27;s authority; thus, after Ragnar Lodbrok became king, he ordered Björn to leave his realm. Björn left Denmark with a considerable fleet and started to ravage in West Francia. The contemporary annals show that he cooperated with another Viking called Sigtrygg and sailed up the Seine in 855, from which his and Sigtrygg&#x27;s forces raided the inland. Their combined forces were beaten in Champagne by Charles the Bald of West Francia in the same year, but not decisively. Sigtrygg withdrew in the next year, but Björn received reinforcement from another Viking army and could not be expelled from the Seine area. He and his men took up winter quarters at the so-called Givold&#x27;s Grave, which served as base for an assault against Paris, which was plundered around the new year 856–857. Björn constructed a fortification on the island Oissel above Rouen which he kept as his stronghold for years. He certainly swore fealty to Charles the Bald in Verberie in 858 but it is not clear if he kept his pledge. King Charles eventually resolved to meet the unruly Seine Vikings with all his available forces and besieged Oissel in July. The siege failed badly, for the pirates defended the fortification with vigour. Moreover, Charles&#x27;s brother Louis the German of East Francia invaded his lands and many vassals fell from him. Thus the siege was broken off in September.

After Björn&#x27;s meeting with Charles in Verberie his name is not found in contemporary sources. However, the Viking warriors in the Seine continued their raids during the following years and even plundered Paris again in 861. In his despair Charles the Bald tried to use another Viking chief, Veland, whose men operated in the Somme region, to attack the Seine Vikings at Oissel. However, this scheme backfired since the two Viking armies made a deal and united their forces. The Norsemen were encamped by the lower Seine in 861–862, but then split again. Veland agreed to become a Christian and joined royal service, while the Seine Vikings went to sea. Some of them joined the fighting between the ruler of Bretagne and some Frankish counts.

==Expedition to the Mediterranean==
A number of Frankish, Norman, Arab, Scandinavian and Irish sources mention a large Viking raid into the Mediterranean in 859–861, co-led by Hastein, Björn Ironside and possibly one or more of his brothers. After raiding down the Iberian coast and fighting their way through Gibraltar, the Norsemen pillaged the south of France, where the fleet stayed over winter, before landing in Italy where they captured the city of Pisa. Flush with this victory and others around the Mediterranean (including in Sicily and North Africa) during the Mediterranean expedition, the Vikings are recorded to have lost 40 ships to a storm. They returned to the Straits of Gibraltar and, at the coast of Medina-Sidonia, lost 2 ships to fire catapults in a surprise raid by Andalusian forces, leaving only 20 ships intact. The remnants of the fleet came back to French waters in 862. Björn Ironside was the leader of the expedition according to the later chronicle of William of Jumièges. The early 11th century &quot;Fragmentary Annals of Ireland&quot; say that two sons of Ragnall mac Albdan, a chief who had been expelled from Lochlann by his brothers and stayed in the Orkney Islands, headed the enterprise.

William of Jumièges refers to Björn as &quot;Bier Costae ferreae&quot; (Ironside) who was &quot;Lotbroci regis filio&quot; (son of King Lodbrok). William&#x27;s account of the Mediterranean expedition centers around Björn&#x27;s foster-father Hastein. The two Vikings conducted many (mostly successful) raids in France. Later on Hastein got the idea to make Björn the new Roman Emperor and led a large Viking raid into the Mediterranean together with his protégée. They proceeded inland to the town of Luni, which they believed to be Rome at the time, but were unable to breach the town walls. To gain entry a tricky plan was devised: Hastein sent messengers to the bishop to say that, being deathly ill, he had a deathbed conversion and wished to receive Christian sacraments and/or to be buried on consecrated ground within their church. He was brought into the chapel with a small honor guard, then surprised the dismayed clerics by leaping from his stretcher. The Viking party then hacked its way to the town gates, which were promptly opened letting the rest of the army in. When they realised that Luni was not Rome, Björn and Hastein wished to investigate this city but changed their minds when they heard that the Romans were well prepared for defense. After returning to West Europe, the two men parted company. Björn was shipwrecked at the English coast and barely survived. He then went to Frisia where William says he died. There are some historical challenges with this account. Hastein appears in the contemporary sources later than Björn, and in order to be his foster-father would have been around his 80s when he died. That is certainly possible, citing the fact that their contemporaries, the Viking Rollo and King Harald Fairhair of Norway lived comparable lifespans. Luni is also known to have been plundered by Saracens.

==&quot;The Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok&quot; and &quot;Tale of Ragnar&#x27;s Sons&quot;==
The story of Björn and his brothers, the sons of the Scandinavian king Ragnar Lodbrok, was retold in different versions throughout the Middle Ages. The &quot;Tale of Ragnar&#x27;s Sons&quot; (&quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot;) is an Icelandic Fornaldar Saga from about the 14th century that combines traditional Norse oral history with legendary themes. It states that Björn was the son of Ragnar and Aslaug and that his brothers were Hvitserk, Ivar the Boneless, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye. The tale also tells of Björn&#x27;s half-brothers Eric and Agnar.

The saga portrays Ragnar as the overlord of large parts of Sweden and possibly even Denmark. While he was still alive, Björn and his brothers left Sweden to conquer Zealand, Reidgotaland (here Jutland), Gotland, Öland and all the minor islands. They then settled at Lejre in Zealand, Denmark with Ivar the Boneless as their leader.

Ragnar&#x27;s sons Eric and Agnar then sailed into Lake Mälaren and sent a message to the Swedish King Eysteinn, a vassal of Ragnar, that they wanted him to submit to Ragnar&#x27;s sons. Moreover, Eric said that he wanted Eysteinn&#x27;s daughter Borghild as wife. Eysteinn said that he first wanted to consult the Swedish chieftains. The chieftains said no to the offer, and ordered an attack on the rebellious sons. A battle ensued and Eric and Agnar were overwhelmed by the Swedish forces, whereupon Agnar died and Eric was taken prisoner.

Eysteinn offered Eric as much of Uppsala öd as he wanted, and Borghild, in wergild for Agnar. Eric proclaimed that after such a defeat he wanted nothing but to choose the day of his own death. Eric asked to be impaled on spears that raised him above the dead and his wish was granted. In Zealand, Björn, Aslaug and Hvitserk, who had been playing tafl, became upset and sailed to Sweden with a large army. Aslaug rode with cavalry across the land. In a great battle they killed Eysteinn.

According to the saga, their father Ragnar was captured and killed by King Ælla in England after a foolhardy invasion attempt. Björn and his brothers, seeking revenge, attacked Ælla but were beaten back. As Ivar realised that the English king could not be defeated right away, he sought reconciliation. He only asked for as much land as he could cover with an ox&#x27;s hide and swore never to wage war against Ælla. Then Ivar cut the ox&#x27;s hide into such fine strands that he could envelop a large fortress (in an older saga it was York and according to a younger saga it was London) which he could take as his own. Ivar made himself popular in England and asked his brothers to attack again. During the battle Ivar sided with his brothers and so did many of the English chieftains with their people, in loyalty to Ivar. Ælla was taken captive and in revenge they carved the blood eagle on him.

Later Björn and his brothers pillaged in England, Normandy, France, and Lombardy, until they came to the town Luna in Italy. When they came back to Scandinavia, they divided the kingdom so that Björn Ironside took Uppsala and Sweden.

The partly legendary Danish chronicle of Saxo Grammaticus, &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (c. 1200), is the first text to mention Björn Ironside as a King of Sweden. According to Saxo, Ragnar Lodbrok had a quarrel with the recently elevated ruler of the Swedes, Sörle. He therefore invaded the Swedish lands in company with his sons Björn, Fridleif and Radbard. Before battle had broken out, the opposing sides agreed to settle the matter through a combat. Ragnar and his three sons met the renowned champion Starkad and his seven sons in the sight of the two armies. &quot;Björn, having inflicted great slaughter on the foe without hurt to himself, gained from the strength of his sides, which were like iron, a perpetual name [i.e., Ironside]&quot;. Ragnar and his sons slew their eight opponents, after which their troops fell on Sörle and his army and annihilated them. Ragnar then &quot;presented Björn with the lordship of Sweden for his conspicuous bravery and service.&quot; Later on, another son of Ragnar, Ubbe, colluded with his maternal grandfather Esbjörn and conspired against Ragnar. Esbjörn sent envoys to Björn in Sweden to drum up support for a rebellion, but Björn refused to listen. Instead, he hanged the envoys while their party were slaughtered by the Swedes. Shortly afterwards Esbjörn was slain in a sea battle, and Ubbe was captured after a heroic resistance. In due time Ragnar appointed Björn regent of Norway, while Sweden was handed over to another son, Eric Weatherhat. After the death of Ragnar, Björn and his brothers attacked Ella in England with 400 ships and killed him. He then went back to his Swedish kingdom, but intervened in Denmark when the Danes rose against the rule of Ragnar&#x27;s sons. With a fleet of 1,700 ships, he and his brothers crushed the insurgents at Slesvig. This is the last we hear about Björn Ironside in the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.

The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; from the 13th century tells that Eysteinn Beli was killed by Björn and his brothers as told in &quot;Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s saga&quot;, and they conquered all of Sweden. When Ragnar died Björn Ironside inherited Sweden. He had two sons, Refil and Erik Björnsson, who became the next king of Sweden.

Anglo-Saxon and Irish sources suggest that the Danish invasion of England after 865 was led by three brothers called Ingvar (i.e. Ivar), Ubbe and Halfdan who, judging from the Irish &quot;Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib&quot;, were sons of a Ragnall (Ragnar or a similar name). Björn is not mentioned in this context, but later Norman tradition suggests that he may have been a brother. According to William of Jumièges he died in Frisia, which also had an association with the invaders of England. Ubbe is sometimes labeled the &quot;Frisian Jarl&quot; and the invaders are occasionally called Scaldingi (men from Schelde). The kingships of Björn is at times historically problematic since it is not supported by older sources and presents insurmountable chronological inconsistencies.

==In fiction==
A principal character in the History television series &quot;Vikings&quot;, played as a young boy by Nathan O&#x27;Toole and through adulthood by Alexander Ludwig, is loosely based on the historical character and portrayed as the son of Lagertha, rather than of Aslaug. According to the lore, Björn is not the eldest son, while in the show he is the eldest of all the sons of Ragnar.

<doc id="894993" wikidata="Q10818030" url="?curid=894993" title="Summer sausage">
<text>Summer sausage is an American term for a sausage that can be kept without refrigeration until opened. Summer sausage is made of beef, pork, or sometimes venison. Summer sausage is fermented, and can be dried or smoked, and while curing ingredients vary significantly, curing salt is almost always used. Seasonings may include mustard seeds, black pepper, garlic salt, or sugar. Fermentation of summer sausage lowers pH to slow bacterial growth and give a longer shelf life, causing a tangy taste. Summer sausages are often included in gift baskets sold by American online and mail order retailers like Harry &amp; David, Wisconsin Cheeseman and Hickory Farms. 
 Armour has produced summer sausage for over 100 years.

Historically, summer sausage predated refrigeration and referred to meats that could be consumed &quot;in the summer months&quot; when high temperatures would cause fresh meats to spoil. For this reason, they became popular gifts during the winter holidays, especially in German-American settler communities.

<doc id="894994" wikidata="Q2199184" url="?curid=894994" title="High Halstow">
<text>High Halstow is a village and civil parish on the Hoo Peninsula in the unitary authority of Medway in South East England. It was, until 1998, administratively part of Kent and is still ceremonially associated via the Lieutenancies Act. The parish had a population of 1,781 according to the 2001 census, increasing to 1,807 at the 2011 census.

Originally known as &quot;Hagelstowe&quot; (in Textus Roffensis), &quot;Hagelsto&quot; or &quot;Agelstow&quot;, it was named from an Old English word denoting a high, holy place. The area has been occupied by Romans, Saxons and Normans.

The village lies on the junction of the ancient roads from Hoo and Cliffe to the Isle of Grain, now a crossroads to the north of the A228 road. One of the highest points on the Hoo peninsula, at 30 to 50 metres above sea level, the modern village consolidates into a single community the four hamlets of Clinch Street, Fenn Street, Sharnal Street and High Halstow Street.

==History==
The 10th-century Grade I listed church of St Margaret at High Halstow was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, and was built on the highest point of the Hoo Peninsula, overlooking the rivers of the Thames and Medway.

In the 18th century poverty and malnutrition were widespread across the peninsula, with High Halstow no exception; adult life expectancy was then about 30 years, lessened by ague, or marsh fever, the names for malaria, which proliferated in the North Kent Marshes and waterlogged farmland, a stronghold of the mosquito. The cause of malaria was discovered in 1890, and within five years the number of people falling ill with the disease decreased sharply as farmland and marshes were drained. This task was performed in no small way by Henry Pye, after he moved to the area.

The village remained small until after the Second World War, comprising the church, a school, two shops, a pub, a wheelwright&#x27;s shop, and an undertaker&#x27;s, with the village being served by a single policeman. Eventually some of the older houses were demolished and replaced. Churchill Place was developed and in the area behind the church, formerly known as the Square, several modern bungalows replaced five thatched cottages. From 1952 more homes were built in the village to house Isle of Grain oil refinery employees.

Historically, the main economic activity around High Halstow has been farming, but some of the village&#x27;s residents gained employment outside the village, at the Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Chattenden and Lodge Hill Military Camps and at the Medway Oil and Storage Co at Grain. Chatham Dockyard and the Short Brothers seaplane works at Rochester were also traditional employers for the whole area until they shut many years ago.

In 1956 a new school opened, the old school building being demolished along with Hill Farm to make way for additional housing. Building development has continued intermittently, including the new estates of Northwood Park and Heron Fields, development of which began in 1998.

The village still has its church, a shop and pub (the Red Dog) but has changed beyond recognition in living memory.

The village&#x27;s cricket club has played in the area for almost 120 years. Ever expanding, the club now has Three Saturday sides, one Sunday side and three colts sides. They play their home matches at Rayner&#x27;s Meadow, which is situated in Christmas Lane, and at the Hundred of Hoo school, Hoo.

==Northward Hill RSPB Reserve==
Northward Hill RSPB Reserve lies to the north of the village, between High Halstow and Cooling. It comprises of grazing marsh, woodland and farmland. The woodland forms High Halstow Nature Reserve (a local SSSI).
Here is the largest heronry in Britain, where some 150–200 pairs nest. A heronry has been in the woods from at least 1947, when it was mentioned in &quot;The Hundred of Hoo&quot; by Ralph Arnold. Many other birds, such as little egrets, avocets and marsh harriers, can also be seen in the reserve. This site was scheduled for demolition under government proposals for an international London airport in connection with the Thames Gateway.

Northward Hill, was known once locally as &quot;the Norrards&quot;. Beyond it on the marsh is a disused experimental radar station, now part of the reserve.

==Buck Hole Farmhouse==
Buck Hole Farmhouse stands next to Northward Hill Reserve; it and another Grade II listed farmhouse &quot;Great Dalham&quot; date from the early 18th century.

<doc id="894995" wikidata="Q434131" url="?curid=894995" title="Jan Ingenhousz">
<text>Jan Ingenhousz FRS (8 December 1730 – 7 September 1799) was a Dutch-British physiologist, biologist and chemist.

He is best known for discovering photosynthesis by showing that light is essential to the process by which green plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. He also discovered that plants, like animals, have cellular respiration. In his lifetime he was known for successfully inoculating the members of the Habsburg family in Vienna against smallpox in 1768 and subsequently being the private counsellor and personal physician to the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa.

== Early life ==
He was born into the patrician Ingen Housz family in Breda in Staats-Brabant in the Dutch Republic. From the age of 16, Ingenhousz studied medicine at the University of Leuven, the Protestant Universities were not then open to Catholics like himself, where he obtained his MD in 1753. He studied for two more years at the University of Leiden, where he attended lectures by, among others, Pieter van Musschenbroek, which led Ingenhousz to have a lifelong interest in electricity. In 1755 he returned home to Breda, where he started a general medical practice.

== Work with smallpox ==
Following his father&#x27;s death in July 1764, Ingenhousz intended to travel through Europe for study, starting in England where he wanted to learn the latest techniques in inoculation against smallpox. Via the physician John Pringle, who had been a family friend since the 1740s, he quickly made many valuable contacts in London, and in due time became a master inoculator. In 1767, he inoculated 700 village people in a successful effort to combat an epidemic in Hertfordshire. In 1768, Empress Maria Theresa read a letter by Pringle on the success in the fight against smallpox in England, whereas in the Austrian Empire the medical establishment vehemently opposed inoculations. She decided to have her own family inoculated first (a cousin had already died), and requested help via the English royal house. On Pringle&#x27;s recommendation, Ingenhousz was selected and requested to travel to Austria. He had planned to inoculate the Royal Family by pricking them with a needle and thread that were coated with smallpox germs taken from the pus of a smallpox-infected person. The idea of the inoculation was that by giving a few germs to a healthy body the body would develop immunisation from smallpox. The inoculation was a success and he became Maria Theresa&#x27;s court physician. He settled in Vienna, where in 1775 he married Agatha Maria Jacquin.

== Work with photosynthesis ==
In the 1770s Ingenhousz became interested in gaseous exchanges of plants. He did this after meeting the scientist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) at his house in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on 23 May 1771. Priestley had found out that plants make and absorb gases. Ingenhousz&#x27; travelling party in northern England included Benjamin Franklin. They then stayed at the rectory in Thornhill, West Yorkshire with the polymath and botanist Rev. John Michell. 

In 1779, Ingenhousz working at his rented country house in Southall Green, discovered that, in the presence of light, plants give off bubbles from their green parts while, in the shade, the bubbles eventually stop. He identified the gas as oxygen. He also discovered that, in the dark, plants give off carbon dioxide. He realised as well that the amount of oxygen given off in the light is more than the amount of carbon dioxide given off in the dark. This demonstrated that some of the mass of plants comes from the air, and not only the water and nutrients in the soil.

== Other work ==

In addition to his work in the Netherlands and Vienna, Ingenhousz spent time in France, England, Scotland, and Switzerland, among other places. He carried out research in electricity, heat conduction, and chemistry, and was in close and frequent correspondence with both Benjamin Franklin and Henry Cavendish. In 1785, he described the irregular movement of coal dust on the surface of alcohol and therefore has a claim as discoverer of what came to be known as Brownian motion. Ingenhousz was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1769 and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1786.
In 1799, Ingenhousz died at Bowood House, near Calne in Wiltshire, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Calne. His wife died the following year.

== Tribute ==
On 8 December 2017, a Google Doodle commemorated his 287th birthday.

<text>Norrlands storregemente or Landsregementet i Norrland (Norrland Grand Regiment, Regiment of the Land in Norrland) was one of the nine grand regiments organized by Gustavus Adolphus in the late 1610s and split into smaller regiments in the 1620s.

== History ==

Raised in Norrland from smaller units of 500 men called &quot;fänikor&quot;, more specifically from the provinces of Västerbotten, Ångermanland, Medelpad, Hälsingland and Gästrikland, in 1615 and counting 3,000 men. In 1617, the regiment was led by Svante Banér and consisted of seven &quot;fänikor&quot;. The grand regiment was in turn organized into three field regiments (&quot;fältregementen&quot;), thus actually being more like a brigade in spite of the name.

One of the field regiments was used in 1621 in the war against Poland and was present at the siege of Riga between 10 August and 13 September with eight companies of 150 men each. The grand regiments of Sweden were reorganized during the period to consist of three field regiments, each of eight companies of 150 men, thus making the total number 3,600 soldiers per grand regiment.

Jakob Duwall was commander of the regiment in 1624. During the same year, the grand regiment was split into three smaller regiments, Västerbotten Regiment, Hälsinge Regiment, and the third regiment was transferred to the navy.

== Campaigns ==
* One field regiment on expedition in 1621 to Livonia during the Polish War.

== Organization ==
Before being split, the regiment was organized as follows:

* &quot;1:a fältregementet&quot; (1st Field Regiment)
** 6 companies from Hälsingland
** 1 company from Medelpad
** 1 company from Gästrikland
* &quot;2:a fältregementet&quot; (2nd Field Regiment)
** 3 companies from Ångermanland
** 2 companies from Hälsingland
** 2 companies from Gästrikland
** 1 company from Medelpad
* &quot;3:e fältregementet&quot; (3rd Field Regiment)
** 7 companies from Västerbotten
** 1 company from Ångermanland

<text>Constantin Freiherr von Ettingshausen (or Baron Constantin von Ettingshausen) (16 June 1826 in Vienna – 1 February 1897 in Graz) was an Austrian botanist known for his paleobotanical studies of flora from the Tertiary era. He was the son of physicist Andreas von Ettingshausen.

== Biography ==
In 1848 he graduated as a doctor of medicine in Vienna, and became in 1854 a professor of botany and natural history at the medical and surgical military academy in that city. In 1871 he was chosen professor of botany at Graz, a position which he maintained until the close of his life.

From 1876 he made repeated visits to London, where he arranged collections at the Natural History Museum. He was distinguished for his researches on the Tertiary floras of various parts of Europe, and on the fossil floras of Australia and New Zealand. The extinct genus &quot;Ettingshausenia&quot; (family Vitaceae) was named in his honor by August Wilhelm Stiehler (1857).

<text>Erik Björnsson was supposedly one of the sons of Björn &quot;Ironside&quot; Ragnarsson and a legendary king of Sweden of the House of Munsö, who would have lived in the late 9th century. One of the few surviving Scandinavian sources that deal with Swedish kings from this time is &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;. The saga is from the 12th or 13th century and is thus not considered a reliable historical source for the 9th century. It says:

Rurik and Erik was the same person. According to Olov von Dalin 1747 that referenced older Swedish sources Rurik was a son of Björn Ironside. Due to the fire 1697 in Tre Kronor a lot older Swedish sources got lost. He would be the same person as Erik Björnsson. He got the lands from his uncle Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye when he died. According to him Rorik of Dorestad was also the same person as Eric.

<text>The Javelin, also called the Javelin 14 and O&#x27;Day Javelin is an American sailing dinghy that was designed by Uffa Fox as a one-design racer and first built in 1960.

==Production==
The design was built by O&#x27;Day Corp. in the United States. The company produced 5100 examples of the design, but it is now out of production.

==Design==
The Javelin is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig with anodized aluminum spars, a nearly plumb stem, a vertical transom, a transom-hung, kick-up rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable centerboard. The hull alone displaces and carries of galvanized steel ballast. A fixed keel model was produced in small numbers and carries of iron ballast.

The boat has a draft of with the centerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer. The fixed keel model has a draft of .

The boat may be fitted with a small outboard motor up to for docking and maneuvering.

The design is equipped with a lockable storage compartment in the bow and gear lockers under the seats.

The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 111.8.

==Operational history==
In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood described the design as, &quot;a beamy, stable small day sailer. Javelin has an unusually large (nine-foot) cockpit, a gear locker under the seats, and a lockable storage compartment under the deck. She is self-bailing and self-rescuing. The transom is reinforced to take outboards up to eight horsepower.&quot;

<doc id="895019" wikidata="Q2170784" url="?curid=895019" title="Anund Uppsale">
<text>Anund Uppsale or Anoundus, &#x27;Anund of Uppsala&#x27;, (Old Norse: &quot;Önundr Uppsali&quot;), a son of Erik Björnsson of the House of Munsö, ruled Sweden together with his brother Björn at Haugi, according to Hervarar saga. He is called &quot;Uppsale&quot; because he stayed at Old Upsala, the era&#x27;s religious centre. He and Björn are sometimes identified with similarly-named kings mentioned in Rimbert&#x27;s Vita Ansgari and by Adam of Bremen.

==Norse tradition==

The Hervarar saga recounts that Anund and his brother Björn succeeded king Erik Refilsson, their cousin. This happened about two generations before the reign of Harald Fairhair of Norway (c. 872-930). The two brothers shared the realm, so that Anund resided in Uppsala while Björn made his residence at Haugi (&quot;the Barrow&quot;). His son Erik succeeded him on the Swedish throne.

A Norwegian document from the early 14th century provides a few additional details. A certain Herjulf Horn-breaker was the standard-bearer of King Halfdan the Black of Vestfold in Norway, the father of Harald Fairhair. However, Herjulf fell out with his lord and escaped to Sweden where he was well received by King Anund. After a while he evoked the wrath of his new master as well, since he slept with Anund&#x27;s kinswoman Helga. Once again, he was forced to flee, bringing Helga with him. The couple eventually settled in the then uninhabited Härjedalen. The document enumerates their descendants for 15 generations. This account is at least partly a construction, since Herjulf Horn-breaker is otherwise known as a pioneer settler in Iceland.

==The &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot;==

The &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot; from c. 870 relates that a Swedish king called Anund was driven away from his country. The reason is unknown, but might have to do with rivalry between royal kinsmen. However, the &quot;Vita&quot; does not say how Anund was related to the other kings mentioned in the text (Erik, Björn, Olof). Anund stayed in exile in Denmark but was keen to regain his kingdom. He therefore approached the Danes and promised them the spoils of plunder from the important commercial center Birka. The Danish king at the time was Horik I who had spent time in exile in Sweden in c. 812-813 and therefore might have had a special relationship with members of the Swedish royal clan. Sometime in the 840s, Anund thus invaded Sweden with a large Danish host of 21 longships and 11 of his own, unexpectedly approaching Birka. At the time, the Swedish king (Björn at Haugi?) was far away, and the chiefs and popular levies had no time to gather. Only the Christian chief of the port, Hergeir, was there together with the merchants and townsmen. They sought refuge in the nearby fortification. Being too few to defend themselves successfully, the inhabitants sent envoys to Anund and offered their friendship and alliance. Anund demanded one hundred marks of silver, which was granted. The Danes felt tricked, since &quot;every merchant owned more than they had been offered&quot; and wanted to make a surprise attack on Birka in order to burn and plunder it. According to the &quot;Vita&quot;, Hergeir made the townsfolk turn away from the pagan gods and make promises to Christ the Lord in order to be saved.

In the meanwhile Anund tried to avert the self-willed plans of his Viking allies. He asked them to draw lots about whether it was the will of the Aesir that Birka should be destroyed, meaning that they were probably casting runes. The outcome was that there was no possibility to carry out the plan with any success, so that an attempt on Birka would bring bad luck to the Danes. They then asked where to go for plunder and the answer was to go to a certain Slavic town. The Danes accordingly left Birka, sailed over to the other town and seized it in a surprise attack. They then returned to Denmark with rich booty. As for Anund, he made peace with the Swedes and returned the ransom money to the townspeople. He then stayed in Sweden for some time since he sought reconciliation with his people.

<doc id="895020" wikidata="Q2027658" url="?curid=895020" title="Charles Sumner Tainter">
<text>Charles Sumner Tainter (April 25, 1854 – April 20, 1940) was an American scientific instrument maker, engineer and inventor, best known for his collaborations with Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, Alexander&#x27;s father-in-law Gardiner Hubbard, and for his significant improvements to Thomas Edison&#x27;s phonograph, resulting in the &quot;Graphophone&quot;, one version of which was the first Dictaphone.

Later in his career Tainter was associated with the International Graphopone Company of West Virginia, and also managed his own research and development laboratory, earning him the title: &#x27;Father Of The Talking Machine&#x27; (i.e.: father of the phonograph).

==Biography==
Tainter was born in Watertown, Massachusetts, where he attended public school. His education was modest, acquiring his knowledge mostly through self-education. In 1873, he took a job with the Alvan Clark and Sons Company producing telescopes in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which then came under contract with the U.S. Navy to conduct observations of the transit of Venus on December 8, 1874, resulting in Tainter being sent with one of its observation expeditions to New Zealand. In 1878 he opened his own shop for the production of scientific instruments in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, where he made the acquaintance of Alexander Graham Bell. A year later Bell called Tainter to what would become his Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C., where he would work for the next several years. He worked there alongside one of the first two woman medical doctors to graduate from Georgetown University, Nettie J. Sumner.

During this time, Tainter worked with the Bells on several inventions, amongst them the photophone and phonograph, which they developed into the Graphophone, a substantial improvement of Edison&#x27;s earlier device, for which Tainter received several patents along with the Bells. Edison subsequently sued the Volta Graphophone Company (of which Tainter was part owner) for patent infringement, but the case was settled by a compromise between the two.

In 1886, he married Lila R. Munro, and over the next years worked in Washington, perfecting his graphophone and founding a company trying to market the Graphophone as a dictation machine: the first Dictaphone. In 1887 Tainter invented the helically wound paper tube as an improved graphophone cylinder. This design was light and strong, and came to be widely used in applications far removed from its original intent, such as mailing tubes and product containers.

In 1888 he was stricken with severe pneumonia, which would incapacitate him intermittently for the rest of his life, leading him and his wife to move to San Diego, California in 1903. After the death of his first wife in 1924, he married Laura F. Onderdonk in 1928.
Tainter received several distinguished awards for his graphophone.

==Unpublished work==
In 1947 Tainter&#x27;s widow, Laura Fontaine Onderdonk, donated a number of Sumner Tainter&#x27;s unpublished writings, including the surviving &quot;Home Notebooks&quot;, to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History. The &quot;Home Notebooks&quot; contain daily agendas describing in detail the project work Tainter conducted at the Volta Laboratory during the 1880s. In 1950 Laura Tainter donated other historical items, including Sumner Tainter&#x27;s manuscripts of &quot;Memoirs of Charles Sumner Tainter&quot;, the first 71 pages of which detailed his experiences up to 1887, plus further writings on his work at the Graphophone factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

==Awards and honors==
* The Electrical Exhibition in Paris awarded Tainter a gold medal for his co-invention of the photophone the previous year (1881);
* the French Government appointed him an &quot;Officier de L Instruction Publique&quot; for his work in the invention of the Graphaphone (1889);
* the San Francisco Exposition awarded him a gold medal for his Graphophone work (1915);
* the Panama Pacific Exposition also awarded him a gold medal for his work on the Graphophone (1915);
* the American Association for the Advancement of Science made Tainter an Emeritus Life Member of their institute (Pittsburgh, December 1934).

<doc id="895024" wikidata="Q2712699" url="?curid=895024" title="Olof (Swedish king 852)">
<text>Olof (Old Norse: &quot;Óláfr&quot;) was a Swedish monarch or local ruler who ruled over Birka, an important port town, and possibly Uppsala, an important early Swedish political center, in about 852, when the Catholic missionary Saint Ansgar made his second voyage from Germany to Birka in about the year 851 or 852 A.D. He had an ambivalent attitude to Christianity, and was known as a successful warrior king in the Baltic region.

Olof is not mentioned in the Icelandic sagas of the 12th and 13th century, which give a different line of succession of supposed Viking Age Swedish rulers, but the &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot;, the near-contemporary writings of Ansgar&#x27;s companion Rimbert, and the 11th-century account of Adam of Bremen both mention him and are generally seen as more reliable than the sagas.

==Religious dispositions==

Ansgar had undertaken missionary work among the Swedes in 829-831, and laid the foundations to a fragile congregation based in the important merchant town Birka. By the early 850s Ansgar, who was now Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, began to worry about the future of the community which was without a priest. He received the consent of the East Frankish ruler Louis the German to go to Sweden in person and received a personal letter to the Swedish king Olof. When he came to Denmark, King Horik I provided him with an envoy and a message which asked Olof to allow Ansgar to missionise freely.

Ansgar&#x27;s biographer Rimbert, in his Vita Ansgari (Life of Ansgar) relates that the Archbishop arrived to Birka after having sailed for 20 days. The year is not certain but seems to have been 851 or 852. There he found that King Olof and a large part of the people were affected by a pagan counter-movement. A seer asserted that he had participated in the council of the Aesir who had expressed their dissatisfaction with the Christian god. In case the current gods were not sufficient to the people, the gods decided to accept the former King Eric (Erik Björnsson, or Erik Refilsson?) in their abode. The seer&#x27;s vision was widely believed, a sanctuary was built in the honour of the long-deceased Eric, and people performed sacrifices to him.

Having installed himself in Birka, Ansgar invited King Olof to his place and feted him with a meal and gifts. The king announced that he would be glad to assist Ansgar, but dared not undertake anything before he had searched the will of the people, and divination had been carried out. &quot;It is, namely, common among them, that every public issue is decided more through the unanimous will of the people, than through royal exertion of power.&quot; Some time later a thing was held in Birka, where a herald announced Ansgar&#x27;s request to missionise among the Swedes. After due deliberation, the thing agreed to allow Christian priests and holy sacraments among them. A second thing, which was held at a different place in the realm, confirmed what had been said. The king summoned Ansgar and enjoined the construction of churches, providing the Archbishop with a piece of land in Birka for a chapel.

==Viking expedition to Courland==

The Curonians in Latvia had once been under the Swedish realm. However, they had rebelled against the Swedes a long time ago and refused to pay them tribute. The Danes, being aware of this, saw the opportunity to take over the Swedish dominions in Courland. At the time of Ansgar&#x27;s second visit to Birka, They marshalled a great fleet and sailed to Courland in order to take over their goods and to make the Curonians pay tribute to the Danes instead. The Curonians gathered forces from all five of their towns and butchered half the Danish army, after which they plundered the Danish ships, gaining a great deal of gold, silver, and other valuables.

When the Swedes and King Olof heard of the Danish failure, they decided to win the reputation that the Swedes could do what the Danes could not and to make the Curonians pay tribute again. Consequently, the Swedes gathered an enormous army and attacked Curland. The first town they attacked was called Seeburg. It had 7,000 armed men, but the town was pillaged, ravaged, and burnt by the Swedes. The Swedes left their ships at the coast and started out on a five-day expedition into the hinterland. They reached the town of &quot;Apulia&quot; (probably modern Apuole). The town had as many as 15,000 armed men.

The Swedes stormed the town but it was ferociously defended, and after eight days of battle many men had fallen without result. By the ninth day, the Swedes were weary of the battle and discussed whether to pursue it. They decided to cast lots with runes, but without results. Rimbert then relates that some of the Swedes had heard of the Christian faith and they decided to cast lots asking the Christian god about how to proceed. They interpreted the results as full support from the Christian god and decided to attack the town once again.

When the Curonians saw that the Swedes were about to resume their attack, they gave up and offered to the Swedes all the gold, silver, and weapons that they had taken from the Danes the previous year. They also offered to pay half a pound of silver for every man in the town and to resume paying tribute to the Swedes and to give hostages as a warrant for paying. They declared that they wished to be the subjects of the Swedish kings as in former times.

King Olof granted their request, and the Swedes returned home with treasures beyond count and thirty hostages as a security for the Curonians&#x27; future loyalty.

The information in the &quot;Vita&quot; has been tentatively combined with archaeological findings in Latvia. According to the archaeologist Birger Nerman these indicate Swedish presence in the region in c. 650-800. Moreover, Nerman discovered arrows and other traces of a 9th century battle in Apuole, while Seeburg was identified with Grobiņa at the coast which has graves which indicate connections with Gotland and the Mälaren Valley. There are nevertheless other interpretations of the place names mentioned in the &quot;Vita&quot;; Apulia might be Pilten at Ventspils which was also known as Ampule, while Seeburg could be Seleburg at the Daugava River.

<text>Eric Weatherhat () was a legendary king of Sweden.

According to the &quot;Swedish Chronicle&quot;, the cognomen &quot;Weatherhat&quot; refers to the accommodating wind he enjoyed whilst pillaging in the Baltic Sea region.

His place in the Swedish line of kings is mysterious, and so he is either considered to be the same as Eric Anundsson or, according to &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, one of Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s sons.

<doc id="895026" wikidata="Q1082969" url="?curid=895026" title="Warhammer Quest">
<text>Warhammer Quest is a fantasy dungeon, role-playing adventure board game released by Games Workshop in 1995 as the successor to &quot;HeroQuest&quot; and &quot;Advanced HeroQuest&quot;, set in its fictional &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot; world. The game focuses upon a group of warriors who join to earn their fame and fortune in the darkest depths of the Old World.

Games Workshop stopped producing &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; in 1998.

==Game==
Mainly written by Andy Jones, &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; utilizes a set of simple game mechanics to simulate the Warriors&#x27; actions as they explore and fight through the dungeons of the Old World. The game puts a strong emphasis on co-operative and thoughtful play by the players in order to survive against the myriad monsters they inevitably face.

Primarily designed for four players, the original game continues the tradition of &quot;HeroQuest&quot; by supplying a Barbarian, Wizard, Dwarf, and Elf as its main Warriors.

The game components are 
* a 4-page introductory booklet
* a 32-page rule book
* 10 plastic dungeon doorways
* a 192-page role-playing book
* a 16-page adventure book
* 56 plastic bases
* 91 plastic miniatures
* 108 playing cards
* 32 game board sections 
* 58 counters and tokens 
* 4 character cards
* 50-sheet adventure record pad
* 18 six-sided dice; 
* game box

===Treasure===
The game focuses on the acquisition of vast amounts of treasure, which is divided into two types: 
* Dungeon Room treasure is collected after every group of Dungeon Monsters are killed. 
* Objective Room treasure is sometimes collected once the warriors have killed all monsters within the given objective room or as a reward at the end of the Adventure.

Treasure can be sold for gold, which can then be used to pay for training and advancement, as well as buying items essential to survival: healing, a weapon, extra armour, or magical talismans that evoke special abilities.

===Monsters===
All of the hostile creatures encountered by Warrior parties are known under the collective name of &quot;Monsters&quot;. Almost all Warhammer creatures of the time were included in the Bestiary section of the &quot;Roleplay Book&quot;. Monsters are broadly divided into the following species:

* Beastmen
* Chaos (Warriors and Daemons)
* Chaos Dwarves
* Dark Elves
* Monsters (creatures with no specific affiliation e.g. Gorgons, Ogres, Dragons etc.)
* Orcs and Goblins
* Skaven
* Undead

Lizardmen are the only major race not to feature in the game. They were later released as an additional supplement in the &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; magazine &quot;Deathblow&quot;.

The challenge of encounters is related to the current Dungeon level and the strength of the party. At lower levels, a small group of Orcs will provide a reasonable challenge; at higher levels, tougher opponents such as Ogres and Dragons are encountered.

==&quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; Roleplaying==
The game was released with a &quot;Roleplay Book&quot;, which enables players to expand their games by introducing tabletop roleplaying game mechanics. When used, the &quot;Roleplay Book&quot; offers the players the chance to travel between Settlements, train to the next level, visit numerous shops and traders, as well as visit Special Locations. The Wizard, Elf, and Dwarf have a Special Location that was exclusive to each of them and, if their luck was good and if they had enough gold, they could buy specialty items to help them in their adventures.

Additionally, the &quot;Roleplay Book&quot; introduces the element of Psychology, which includes new rules for Fear, Terror, Hatred, Breaking (fleeing), and being Prone. There are also rules and descriptions for using two new Characteristics: Luck and Willpower.

The &quot;Roleplay Book&quot; also contains a bestiary of Monsters that the warriors might encounter. The &quot;Roleplay Book&quot; also offers a Hazards Table (for use when traveling to a village, town or city), a Settlement Events Table (for use when spending time in a settlement), extra Treasure and Objective Room Treasure tables as well as ‘Battle-level Monster Tables’ for use as the Warriors&#x27; careers progress.

The last section of the &quot;Roleplay Book&quot; contains guidelines for writing adventures and Warrior development. It also contains an entire pre-written campaign for the Gamemaster and the Warriors to play as well as introducing the first expansion Warrior of &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot;: the Dwarf Trollslayer.

==Warrior progression==
Every Warrior can be progressed up to 10 stages or ‘Battle Levels’. In many role-playing games, character advance by accumulating experience points. In &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; a Warrior accumulates gold to advance battle-levels and can also use the gold to buy items. Every monster encountered and killed is worth a certain amount of Gold. In addition, the Warrior can sell any treasure at the end of the adventure. The leader carrying the lantern (typically the Barbarian) decides which warrior gained an item of treasure.

==Expansions==
A number of expansions were released for &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot;. These included two new adventure packs, several Warrior packs as well as additional Treasure Card packs and a set of blank Monster Cards &amp; Event cards, where players could record their own monsters from the Warhammer world that were not written within the Roleplay book or else not produced as an official card by Games Workshop.

===Adventure packs===
There were two adventure packs released for the game. Lair of the Orc Lord contained six new adventures against Greenskins (Orcs &amp; Goblins) while Catacombs of Terror featured six new adventures that pitted the Warriors against the evils of the Undead. Both expansions contained new, pewter models to represent their enemies as well as new Board tiles and cards.

===Warrior packs===
Games Workshop released packs for nine additional Warriors, all of which had some background within the Warhammer world. The packs consisted of a Warrior model, rulebook and a set of card tokens detailing the warrior&#x27;s original statistics &amp; equipment. The rulebooks offered a piece of background as to the warrior-type &amp; a set of rules to use the warrior including details about any new special locations they might visit, skills or equipment they could obtain as well as details about their Battle Level progression. The Warrior Packs released were as follows:

*Pit Fighter
*Warrior Priest
*Imperial Noble
*Elf Ranger
*Dwarf Trollslayer
*Chaos Warrior
*Wardancer
*Witch Hunter
*Bretonnian Knight

&quot;Deathblow&quot; was a dedicated &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; journal released by Games Workshop to accompany the game in a similar vein to its &quot;Citadel Journal&quot; and &quot;Fanatic Magazine&quot;. Deathblow consisted of only three issues. Deathblow included articles by contributors outside of Games Workshop&#x27;s employ and featured articles from &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, the &quot;Citadel Journal&quot; and contained new adventures and a selection of other &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; related paraphernalia.

&quot;Deathblow&quot; introduced eight new Warriors: The Halfling Thief, Kislev Shaman, an Assassin, an Ogre, Druid of Albion, Dwarf Brewmaster, Salty Seadog &amp; Lord of Aenarion.

&quot;Deathblow&quot; was named after &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot;’s ‘Death-Blow’ mechanic where if a warrior killed a monster in one single strike he could then carry that attack through to an adjacent monster.

Andy Jones, Geoff Taylor, Richard Wright, Dave Gallagher, John Blanche, Wayne England, Mark Gibbons, Bryan Ansell, Gavin Thorpe, Ian Pickstock, Mark Hawkins, Dean Bass, Steve Anastasoff, Tuomas Pirinen, Mark Hawkins and more.

==Sequels==
Eighteen years after the game ceased production, Games Workshop released &quot;Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower&quot; (2016), &quot;Warhammer Quest: Shadows Over Hammerhal&quot; (2017), &quot;Warhammer Quest: Blackstone Fortress&quot; (2018), and &quot;Warhammer Quest: Cursed City&quot; (2021). These games follow the original in overall design as dungeon crawling board games, but with substantially different rulesets. &quot;Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower&quot;, &quot;Warhammer Quest: Shadows Over Hammerhal&quot;, and &quot;Warhammer Quest: Cursed City&quot; are set in Games Workshops new fantasy setting, &quot;Warhammer Age of Sigmar&quot;. While &quot;Warhammer Quest: Blackstone Fortress&quot; is set in Games Workshops sci-fi universe &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Video games===

On 20 August 2012 GW announced &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; for iOS devices. The development company is Rodeo Games. It was released on 30 May 2013. It received positive reviews from critics.

It was later ported to PC, Mac and Linux by Twistplay and was released by Chilled Mouse on Steam on 7 January 2015, Android on 25 June 2015, and later to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

&quot;Warhammer Quest 2: The End Times&quot; by Perchang was released on 20 October 2017 for iOS and for Android on 11 April 2018. It received average reviews from critics.

&quot;Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower&quot; was released for Android and iOS on September 3, 2020, based on the 2016 sequel of the board game.

===Card game===
A card game adaptation, &quot;Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game&quot;, was released in 2015. It got a positive review from Robert Florence of Rock Paper Shotgun: &quot;Is this game a reasonable substitute for the full-flavour Warhammer Quest? Absolutely not. That old game is something very, very special. But this is an impressive attempt to pull some of that game&#x27;s magic into a smaller box and support it with modern game mechanics. I was really surprised by how right it all felt.&quot;

==Reception==
In the January 1996 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 225), Rick Swan liked the high quality of the game components, and the &quot;easy-on-the-brain explanations&quot; of the rules. But Swan objected to actual object of the game, which he summed up as &quot;a string of random events, most of them combat encounters, with an occasional death trap thrown in to break the monotony.&quot; Swan also noted the game&#x27;s complete lack of realism, but said, &quot;&quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; doesn’t pretend to be realistic, and therefore doesn’t deserve to be criticized for its lack of logic. That’s like criticizing a candy bar for its lack of vitamins.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game an average rating of 4 out of 6, and only recommended the game as a means of training up new role-players: &quot;&quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; does a admirable job of incorporating role-playing fundamentals, and thus serves as a painless introduction to RPGs. And when Quest-ers get the hang of hit points and attribute scores, that’s where you step in with &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; or the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game.&quot;

<doc id="895030" wikidata="Q373737" url="?curid=895030" title="Torkel Knutsson">
<text>Torkel (Tyrgils or Torgils) Knutsson (died 1306) was Lord High Constable of Sweden, member of the Privy Council of Sweden (&quot;Riksråd&quot;), and virtual ruler of Sweden during the early reign of King Birger Magnusson (1280–1321).

== Biography ==
Torkel hailed from an old noble family of West Geatish ancestry and was related to the House of Bjälbo (&quot;Folkungaätten&quot;). He was first mentioned in 1282. In documents from 1288, he is mentioned as a knight and a member of the privy council (&quot;Riksråd&quot;).

=== Career ===
Before his death, King Magnus Ladulås ( 1290) ordered his kinsman, Torkel Knutsson, the Constable of the Realm, to be the guardian of his son Birger. When King Magnus Ladulås died, Torkel became regent for the underage Birger Magnusson (1280–1321).

When Tavastland had been attacked by the Republic of Novgorod, in 1292, Torkel led the Third Swedish Crusade against Novgorod, in 1293 and conquered parts of Karelia, where he founded the stronghold of Vyborg Castle. In 1299–1300, he led an attack against the Novgorodians, and he founded the Landskrona fortress on Okhta river at the influx of Neva.

The old trade treaties with Lübeck were re-established, on condition that the town did not provide Novgorod with weapons or provisions.
Torkel showed the same concerns about Swedish domestic politics. During his regency, the law of Uppland was established. He acted as Birger Jarl had done in the conflict against the church, in order to abolish the clergy&#x27;s tax exemption. The clergy&#x27;s discontent became apparent in 1303.

In the struggles between King Birger Magnusson and his brothers, Erik Magnusson, Duke of Svealand (c. 1282 – 1318) and Valdemar Magnusson, Duke of Finland (c. 1282 – 1318), Torkel was faithfully on the king&#x27;s side. At Torkel&#x27;s castle Aranäs, in 1304, the two dukes had to sign a declaration that they would neither in Sweden, nor abroad, work against the king nor cause him harm. In spite of this declaration, the two dukes fled abroad and with the support of the Norwegian king Haakon V of Norway, they attacked Västergötland. Torkel helped the king conquer the castle of Nyköping, which belonged to Duke Eric, and in Kolsäter (1305), he forced the two dukes to sign a declaration that they would not cause any harm to Torkel either.

When the power of the dukes was on the rise again, Torkel had to reconcile with the church, and he ordered a charter on the renewal of the church&#x27;s old rights, in 1305. However, Torkel was finally struck by the vengeance of his enemies. The dukes managed to win the trust of the king and poisoned the king&#x27;s mind against Torkel. In December 1305, King Birger and the dukes arrived at Torkel&#x27;s estate of Lena (where formerly the Battle of Lena had taken place) in Västergötland, and arrested Torkel who was taken to Stockholm in chains. In February 1306, the marshal was decapitated. His body was interred at the place of execution. It was later moved and buried at the Franciscan church in Stockholm.

=== Family ===
Torkel was married twice. His first wife, whose origins are unknown, gave him a daughter Kristina Torgilsdotter, who married Torkel&#x27;s godson and later enemy Duke Valdemar. She appears to have been repudiated by the duke upon her father&#x27;s execution, as Valdemar is soon reported to have married with Ingeborg Eriksdottir of Norway. Torkel&#x27;s second wife was countess Hedvig of Ravensberg.

==Remembrance==
Torkel&#x27;s powerful personality and tragic end has been the matter of poetry, in e.g. B. v. Beskow&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Torkel Knutsson&quot;. A statue of Torkel (by Ville Vallgren) was raised, in 1908, on the square Rådhustorget in Vyborg.

<doc id="895031" wikidata="Q633681" url="?curid=895031" title="Björn Eriksson">
<text>Björn (traditionally ruled 882–932) according to the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; and &quot;Harald Fairhair&#x27;s saga&quot; was the father of Olof (II) Björnsson and Eric the Victorious, also a grandfather of Styrbjörn the Strong. According to the two sagas, he was the son of an Erik who fought Harald Fairhair and who succeeded the brothers Björn at Hauge and Anund Uppsale:
:King Önund had a son called Eric, and he succeeded to the throne at Upsala after his father. He was a rich King. In his days Harold the Fair-haired made himself King of Norway. He was the first to unite the whole of that country under his sway. Eric at Upsala had a son called Björn, who came to the throne after his father and ruled for a long time. The sons of Björn, Eric the Victorious, and Olaf succeeded to the kingdom after their father. Olaf was the father of Styrbjörn the Strong.(&quot;Hervarar saga&quot;)

The latter saga relates that he ruled for 50 years:
:There were disturbances also up in Gautland as long as King Eirik Eymundson lived; but he died when King Harald Harfager had been ten years king of all Norway. After Eirik, his son Bjorn was king of Svithjod for fifty years. He was father of Eirik the Victorious, and of Olaf the father of Styrbjorn. (&quot;Harald Fairhair&#x27;s saga&quot;)

In &quot;Olaf the Holy&#x27;s saga&quot;, Snorri Sturluson quotes Thorgny Lawspeaker on king Björn:

:My father, again, was a long time with King Bjorn, and was well acquainted with his ways and manners. In Bjorn&#x27;s lifetime his kingdom stood in great power, and no kind of want was felt, and he was gay and sociable with his friends. (&quot;Saga of Olaf Haraldsson&quot;)

When Björn died, Olof and Eric were elected to be co-rulers of Sweden. However, Eric would disinherit his nephew Styrbjörn.

Adam of Bremen, however, only gives Emund Eriksson as the predecessor of Eric the Victorious, around 970. His account is generally considered more reliable than the Icelandic sagas, and as such Björn Eriksson may be an entirely fictional figure.

<doc id="895033" wikidata="Q27429789" url="?curid=895033" title="Macular degeneration">
<text>Macular degeneration, also known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD), is a medical condition which may result in blurred or no vision in the center of the visual field. Early on there are often no symptoms. Over time, however, some people experience a gradual worsening of vision that may affect one or both eyes. While it does not result in complete blindness, loss of central vision can make it hard to recognize faces, drive, read, or perform other activities of daily life. Visual hallucinations may also occur.
Macular degeneration typically occurs in older people, and is caused by damage to the macula of the retina. Genetic factors and smoking may play a role. The condition is diagnosed through a complete eye exam. Severity is divided into early, intermediate, and late types. The late type is additionally divided into &quot;dry&quot; and &quot;wet&quot; forms, with the dry form making up 90% of cases.

The difference between the two forms is categorized by the change in the macula. Those with dry-form AMD have drusen, cellular debris in their macula that gradually damages light-sensitive cells and leads to vision loss. In wet-form AMD, blood vessels grow under the macula, causing blood and fluid to leak into the retina.
Exercising, eating well, and not smoking may reduce the risk of macular degeneration. No cure or treatment restores the vision already lost. In the wet form, anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injected into the eye or, less commonly, laser coagulation or photodynamic therapy may slow worsening. Dietary antioxidant vitamins, minerals, and carotenoids do not appear to affect the onset; however, dietary supplements may slow the progression in those who already have the disease.
Age-related macular degeneration is a main cause of central blindness among the working-aged population worldwide. As of 2022, it affects more than 200 million people globally with the prevalence expected to increase to 300 million people by 2040 as the proportion of elderly persons in the population increases. It affects females more frequently than males, and it is more common in those of European or North American ancestry. In 2013, it was the fourth most common cause of blindness, after cataracts, preterm birth, and glaucoma. It most commonly occurs in people over the age of fifty and in the United States is the most common cause of vision loss in this age group. About 0.4% of people between 50 and 60 have the disease, while it occurs in 0.7% of people 60 to 70, 2.3% of those 70 to 80, and nearly 12% of people over 80 years old.
== Signs and symptoms ==

Early or intermediate AMD may be asymptomatic, or it may present with blurred or decreased vision in one or both eyes. This may manifest initially as difficulty with reading or driving (especially in poorly lit areas). Other symptoms of AMD include distortion of vision and blind spots (especially in and around the central visual field).

Other signs and symptoms of macular degeneration include:
* Distorted vision in the form of metamorphopsia, in which a grid of straight lines appears wavy and parts of the grid may appear blank: Patients often first notice this when looking at things like miniblinds in their home or telephone poles while driving. There may also be central scotomas, shadows, or missing areas of vision.
* Slow recovery of visual function after exposure to bright light (photostress test)
* Visual acuity drastically decreasing (two levels or more), e.g.: 20/20 to 20/80
* Blurred vision: Those with nonexudative (dry) macular degeneration may be asymptomatic or notice a gradual loss of central vision, whereas those with exudative (wet) macular degeneration often notice a rapid onset of vision loss (often caused by leakage and bleeding of abnormal blood vessels).
* Trouble discerning colors, specifically dark ones from dark ones and light ones from light ones
* A loss in contrast sensitivity
* Formed visual hallucinations and flashing lights have also been associated with severe visual loss secondary to wet AMD

Macular degeneration by itself will not lead to total blindness. For that matter, only a small number of people with visual impairment are blind. In almost all cases, some vision remains, mainly peripheral. Other complicating conditions may lead to such an acute condition (severe stroke or trauma, untreated glaucoma, etc.), but few macular degeneration patients experience total visual loss.

The area of the macula constitutes only about 2.1% of the retina, and the remaining 97.9% (the peripheral field) remains unaffected by the disease. Even though the macula provides such a small fraction of the visual field, almost half of the visual cortex is devoted to processing macular information.

In addition, people with dry macular degeneration often do not experience any symptoms but can experience gradual onset of blurry vision in one or both eyes. People with wet macular degeneration may experience acute onset of visual symptoms.

==Risk factors==
The pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is intricately linked to gene-environment interactions. Key risk factors are age, race/ethnicity, smoking, and family history. Advanced age is the strongest predictor of AMD, particularly over 50.

===Race and ethnicity===
As illustrated by the Figure in this section, derived from data presented by the National Eye Institute of the United States, among those over 80 years of age, White individuals are more than 6-fold more likely to develop AMD than Black or Hispanic individuals. Thus, white background is a major risk factor for AMD.

In Caucasian (white) skin, there is a specific group of polymorphic genes (with single nucleotide alterations) that encode for enzymes and transcription factors responsible for the early steps (including the first step, formation of L-DOPA from the amino acid tyrosine) of the melanin synthesis pathway. Many of these enzymes and transcription factors are reviewed by Markiewicz and Idowu. Also, as reviewed by Sturm et al. &quot;increasing intracellular concentrations of either tyrosine or L-DOPA both increase melanogenesis&quot; or formation of the black pigment melanin. Thus there appears to be an association between reduced L-DOPA production and white skin. As suggested by the Figure and information in this section, reduced L-DOPA, resulting in white skin, appears to be associated with an increased risk of macular degeneration for white individuals over the age of 80.

===Environment and lifestyle===
* Smoking: Smoking tobacco increases the risk of AMD by two to three times that of someone who has never smoked, and may be the most important modifiable factor in its prevention. A review of previous studies found &quot;a strong association between current smoking and AMD. ... Cigarette smoking is likely to have toxic effects on the retina.&quot;
* Hypertension (high blood pressure): In the ALIENOR study 2013, early and late AMD were not significantly associated with systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP), hypertension, or use of antihypertensive medications, but elevated pulse pressure [(PP) systolic BP minus diastolic BP] was significantly associated with an increased risk of late AMD.
* Atherosclerosis
* High cholesterol: Elevated cholesterol may increase the risk of AMD
* Obesity: Abdominal obesity is a risk factor, especially among men
* Fat intake: Consuming high amounts of certain fats, including saturated fats, trans fats, and omega-6 fatty acids, likely contributes to AMD, while monounsaturated fats are potentially protective. In particular, omega-3 fatty acids may decrease the risk of AMD.
* Exposure to UV light from sunlight may be associated with an increased risk of developing AMD, although evidence for this is weaker than for other causes.
* There is no evidence to support the claim that exposure to digital screens contributes to the risk of macular degeneration.

===Genetics===
AMD is a highly heritable condition. Recurrence ratios for siblings of an affected individual are three- to six-fold higher than in the general population. Genetic linkage analysis has identified 5 sets of gene variants at three locations on different chromosomes (1, 6 and 10) as explaining at least 50% of the risk. These genes have roles regulating the immune response, inflammatory processes and homeostasis of the retina. Variants of these genes give rise to different kinds of dysfunction in these processes. Over time, this results in the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular metabolic debris. This can cause scarring of the retina or breakdown of its vascularization.

The list of genetic variations associated with AMD includes complement factors, apolipoprotein E, fibroblast growth factor 2, DNA excision repair protein, and age-related maculopathy susceptibility protein 2.

Although genetic testing can lead to the identification of genetic variation that can predispose to AMD, the complex pathogenesis of the condition prevents the use of these tests in routine practice. Nevertheless, they can be useful in selecting patients for clinical trials and analyzing their response to treatment. The three loci where identified gene variants are found are designated:
* Complement Factor H (CFH) on chromosome 1 at location 1q31.3
* HTRA serine peptidase 1/Age Related Maculopathy Susceptibility 2 (HTRA1/ARMS2) on chromosome 10 at location 10q26
* Complement Factor B/Complement Component 2 (CFB/CC2) on chromosome 6 at 6p21.3

====Specific genes====
* Polymorphisms in genes for complement system proteins: Variation in the genes for the complement system proteins factor H (CFH), factor B (CFB) and factor 3 (C3), among others, are strongly associated with a person&#x27;s risk for developing AMD. CFH is involved in inhibiting the inflammatory response. The mutation in CFH (&quot;Y402H&quot;) results in reduced ability of the protein to localise to and protect tissues such as the retina from complement overactivation. Absence of the complement factor H-related genes &quot;R3&quot; and &quot;R1&quot; protects against AMD. Two independent studies in 2007 showed a certain common mutation &quot;Arg80Gly&quot; in the C3 gene, which is a central protein of the complement system, is strongly associated with the occurrence of AMD. The authors of both papers consider their study to underscore the influence of the complement pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease.
* In two 2006 studies, another gene that has implications for the disease, called &quot;HTRA1&quot; (encoding a secreted serine protease), was identified.
* Six mutations of the gene &quot;SERPING1&quot; (Serpin Peptidase Inhibitor, Clade G (C1 Inhibitor), Member 1) are associated with AMD. Mutations in this gene can also cause hereditary angioedema.
* Fibulin-5 mutation: Rare forms of the disease are caused by genetic defects in fibulin-5, in an autosomal dominant manner. In 2004, Stone &quot;et al.&quot; performed a screening on 402 AMD patients and revealed a statistically significant correlation between mutations in fibulin-5 and the incidence of the disease.
* Mitochondrial-related gene polymorphisms such as that in the MT-ND2 molecule, predicts wet AMD.

==Pathophysiology==

The pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration is not fully understood, although some theories have been put forward, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory processes.

The imbalance between the production of damaged cellular components and degradation leads to the accumulation of harmful products, for example, intracellular lipofuscin and extracellular drusen. Incipient atrophy is demarcated by areas of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thinning or depigmentation that precedes geographic atrophy in the early stages of AMD. In advanced stages of AMD, atrophy of the RPE (geographic atrophy) and/or development of new blood vessels (neovascularization) result in the death of photoreceptors and central vision loss.

In the dry (nonexudative) form, drusen accumulate between the retina and the choroid, causing atrophy and scarring to the retina. In the wet (exudative) form, which is more severe, blood vessels grow up from the choroid (neovascularization) behind the retina which can leak exudate and fluid and also cause hemorrhaging.

Early work demonstrated a family of immune mediators was plentiful in drusen. Complement factor H (CFH) is an important inhibitor of this inflammatory cascade, and a disease-associated polymorphism in the CFH gene strongly associates with AMD. Thus an AMD pathophysiological model of chronic low grade complement activation and inflammation in the macula has been advanced. Lending credibility to this has been the discovery of disease-associated genetic polymorphisms in other elements of the complement cascade including complement component 3 (C3).

A powerful predictor of AMD is found on chromosome &quot;10q26&quot; at LOC 387715. An insertion/deletion polymorphism at this site reduces expression of the &quot;ARMS2&quot; gene through destabilization of its mRNA through deletion of the polyadenylation signal. ARMS2 protein may localize to the mitochondria and participate in energy metabolism, though much remains to be discovered about its function.

Other gene markers of progression risk includes tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3), suggesting a role for extracellular matrix metabolism in AMD progression. Variations in cholesterol metabolising genes such as the hepatic lipase, cholesterol ester transferase, lipoprotein lipase and the ATP-binding cassette A1 correlate with disease progression. The early stigmata of the disease, drusen, are rich in cholesterol, offering face validity to the results of genome-wide association studies.

===Stages===
In AMD there is a progressive accumulation of characteristic yellow deposits, called drusen (buildup of extracellular proteins and lipids), in the macula (a part of the retina), between the retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying choroid. This accumulation is believed to damage the retina over time. Amyloid beta, which builds up in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease brains, is one of the proteins that accumulate in AMD, which is a reason why AMD is sometimes called &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s of the eye&quot; or &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s of the retina&quot;. AMD can be divided into 3 stages: early, intermediate, and late, based partially on the extent (size and number) of drusen.

AMD-like pathology begins with small yellow deposits (drusen) in the macula, between the retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying choroid. Most people with these early changes (referred to as age-related maculopathy) still have good vision. People with drusen may or may not develop AMD. The majority of people over age 60 have drusen with no adverse effects. The risk of developing symptoms is higher when the drusen are large and numerous, and associated with the disturbance in the pigmented cell layer under the macula. Large and soft drusen are thought to be related to elevated cholesterol deposits.

====Early AMD====
Early AMD is diagnosed based on the presence of medium-sized drusen, which is about the width of an average human hair. It is usually asymptomatic.

====Intermediate AMD====
Intermediate AMD is diagnosed by large drusen and/or any retinal pigment abnormalities. Intermediate AMD may cause some vision loss, but, like early AMD, it is usually asymptomatic.

Recently, subgroups of intermediate AMD have been identified, which have a very high risk of progression toward late AMD. This subgroup (depending on the precise definitions) is termed nascent GA and/or iRORA (incomplete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy). These &#x27;high-risk&#x27; subgroups of intermediate AMD can be used to inform patients of their prognosis. In addition, these can be applied in clinical trials as endpoints.

====Late AMD====
In late AMD, enough retinal damage occurs that, in addition to drusen, people will also begin to experience symptomatic central vision loss. The damage can either be the development of atrophy or the onset of neovascular disease. Late AMD is further divided into two subtypes based on the types of damage: Geographic atrophy and Wet AMD (also called Neovascular AMD).

=====Dry AMD=====
Dry AMD (also called nonexudative AMD) is a broad designation, encompassing all forms of AMD that are not neovascular (wet AMD). This includes early and intermediate forms of AMD, as well as the advanced form of dry AMD known as geographic atrophy. Dry AMD patients tend to have minimal symptoms in the earlier stages; visual function loss occurs more often if the condition advances to geographic atrophy. Dry AMD accounts for 80–90% of cases and usually progresses slowly. In 10–20% of people, dry AMD progresses to the wet type.

====Geographic atrophy====

Geographic atrophy (also called atrophic AMD) is an advanced form of AMD in which progressive and irreversible loss of retinal cells leads to a loss of visual function. Multiple layers make up the retina, and in geographic atrophy, three specific layers undergo atrophy: the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium, and the overlying photoreceptors.

The three layers that undergo atrophy in geographic atrophy are all adjacent to each other. The photoreceptors are the most superficial and they are the cells that are responsible for converting energy from the light from the outside world, into an electrical signal to be sent to the brain. There are several functions of the retinal pigment epithelium. One of the main functions of the retinal pigment epithelium is to minimize oxidative stress. It does so by absorbing light and thus preventing it from getting to the underlying layers. The layers underlying the retinal pigment epithelium are very vascularized so they have very high oxygen tension. Thus, if light were to get to those layers, many free radicals would form and cause damage to nearby tissues. The deepest layer that undergoes atrophy in geographic atrophy is called the choriocappilaris. It is a capillary network that provides nutrients to the retinal pigment epithelium.

The pathophysiology of geographic atrophy is still uncertain. Some studies questioned whether it was due to a deficient retinal pigment epithelium, leading to increased oxidative stress. Other studies have looked for inflammatory causes of damage. Thus far, the medical community is still not certain. Recent studies have begun to look at each layer individually. They found that decreased blood flow in the choriocapillaris precedes atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and the overlying photoreceptors. Since the choriocapillaris is a vascular layer, this may be used as an argument for why geographic atrophy could be a disease due to decreased blood flow.

=====Wet AMD=====
Neovascular or exudative AMD, the &quot;wet&quot; form of advanced AMD, causes vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth (choroidal neovascularization) in the choriocapillaris, through Bruch&#x27;s membrane. It is usually, but not always, preceded by the dry form of AMD. The proliferation of abnormal blood vessels in the retina is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Because these blood vessels are abnormal, they are also more fragile than typical blood vessels, which ultimately leads to blood and protein leakage below the macula. Bleeding, leaking, and scarring from these blood vessels eventually cause irreversible damage to the photoreceptors and rapid vision loss if left untreated.

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration depends on signs in the macula, not necessarily vision. Early diagnosis of AMD can prevent further visual deterioration and potentially improve vision.

Diagnosis of dry (or early stage) AMD may include the following clinical examinations as well as procedures and tests:
* The transition from dry to wet AMD can happen rapidly, and if it is left untreated can lead to legal blindness in as little as six months. To prevent this from occurring and to initiate preventive strategies earlier in the disease process, dark adaptation testing may be performed. A dark adaptometer can detect subclinical AMD at least three years earlier than it is clinically evident.
* There is a loss of contrast sensitivity, so that contours, shadows, and color vision are less vivid. The loss of contrast sensitivity can be quickly and easily measured by a contrast sensitivity test like Pelli Robson performed either at home or by an eye specialist.
* When viewing an Amsler grid, some straight lines appear wavy and some patches appear blank
* When viewing a Snellen chart, at least 2 lines decline
* In dry macular degeneration, which occurs in 85–90 percent of AMD cases, drusen spots can be seen in Fundus photography
* Using an electroretinogram, points in the macula with a weak or absent response compared to a normal eye may be found
* Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test and Maximum Color Contrast Sensitivity test (MCCS) for assessing color acuity and color contrast sensitivity
* Optical coherence tomography is now used by most ophthalmologists in the diagnosis and the follow-up evaluation of the response to treatment with antiangiogenic drugs.

Diagnosis of wet (or late-stage) AMD may include the following in addition to the above tests:
* Preferential hyperacuity perimetry changes (for wet AMD). Preferential hyperacuity perimetry is a test that detects drastic changes in vision and involves the macula being stimulated with distorted patterns of dots and the patient identification of where in the visual field this occurs.
* In wet macular degeneration, angiography can visualize the leakage of the bloodstream behind the macula. Fluorescein angiography allows for the identification and localization of abnormal vascular processes.

===Histology===
* Pigmentary changes in the retina – In addition to the pigmented cells in the iris (the colored part of the eye), there are pigmented cells beneath the retina. As these cells break down and release their pigment, dark clumps of released pigment and later, areas that are less pigmented may appear
* Exudative changes: hemorrhages in the eye, hard exudates, subretinal/sub-RPE/intraretinal fluid
* Drusen, tiny accumulations of extracellular material that build up on the retina. While there is a tendency for drusen to be blamed for the progressive loss of vision, drusen deposits can be present in the retina without vision loss. Some patients with large deposits of drusen have normal visual acuity. If normal retinal reception and image transmission are sometimes possible in a retina when high concentrations of drusen are present, then, even if drusen can be implicated in the loss of visual function, there must be at least one other factor that accounts for the loss of vision.

== Management ==
Treatment of AMD varies depending on the category of the disease at the time of diagnosis. In general, treatment is aimed at slowing down the progression of AMD. As of 2018, there are no treatments to reverse the effects of AMD. As of 2024, there are two drugs to dissolve the drusen in dry AMD, see below. Early-stage and intermediate-stage AMD is managed by modifying known risk factors such as smoking cessation, management of hypertension and atherosclerosis, and making dietary modifications. For intermediate-stage AMD, management also includes antioxidant and mineral supplementation. Advanced-stage AMD is managed based on the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV): dry AMD (no CNV present) or wet AMD (CNV present). No effective treatments exist for dry AMD. The CNV present in wet AMD is managed with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Daily use of an Amsler grid or other home visual monitoring tools can be used to monitor for development of distorted vision, which may be a sign of disease progression.

===Dietary supplements===
Dietary supplements may be suggested for people with AMD, to reduce damage to the cells in the retina with antioxidants. The formulations commonly suggested are known as AREDS. The specific vitamins and minerals in AREDS-1 are vitamin C (500 mg), zinc (80 mg), vitamin E (400 IU), copper (2 mg) and beta-carotene (15 mg). In the AREDS-2 formulation, lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) replaced beta-carotene due to the risk of lung cancer in smokers taking beta-carotene. There is some evidence to indicate that people with bilateral early or intermediate AMD, or intermediate AMD in one eye and advanced AMD in the other eye may benefit from vitamin and mineral supplementation. AREDS supplementation may help slow the progression to more severe forms of AMD and there is some evidence of improved visual acuity at 5 years. There is no evidence that micronutrient supplementation prevents AMD progression in those with severe disease or prevents disease onset in those without AMD.

With regards to AREDS-1 compared with AREDS-2 formulations, there is only weak evidence comparing the effectiveness of each formulation and the effectiveness of lutein and zeaxanthin as a replacement in the AREDS-2 formulation.

===Dry AMD===
Pegcetacoplan (Syfovre) and avacincaptad pegol (Izervay) are approved for medical use in the United States. In 2023 it was reported that the aging pigment lipofuscin can be broken down with the help of melanin and drugs through a newly discovered mechanism. The pigment lipofuscin plays a central role in the development of dry AMD and Stargardt&#x27;s disease. The clinical development of this mechanism, which has the potential to clear Bruch&#x27;s membrane and reduce the formation of drusen, is in preparation.

===Wet AMD===
Ranibizumab, aflibercept, brolucizumab, and faricimab are approved VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of CNV in wet AMD. All three drugs are administered via intravitreal injection, meaning they are injected directly into the eye. Bevacizumab is another VEGF inhibitor that has been shown to have similar efficacy and safety as the previous two drugs, however, is not currently indicated for AMD. AMD can also be treated with laser coagulation therapy.

A randomized control trial found that bevacizumab and ranibizumab had similar efficacy, and reported no significant increase in adverse events with bevacizumab. A 2014 Cochrane review found that the systemic safety of bevacizumab and ranibizumab are similar when used to treat neovascular AMD, except for gastrointestinal disorders. Bevacizumab, however, is not FDA-approved for the treatment of macular degeneration. A controversy in the UK involved the off-label use of cheaper bevacizumab over the approved, but expensive, ranibizumab. Ranibizumab is a smaller fragment, Fab fragment, of the parent bevacizumab molecule specifically designed for eye injections. Other approved antiangiogenic drugs for the treatment of neovascular AMD include pegaptanib and aflibercept.

These anti-VEGF agents may be administered monthly or adaptively. For adaptive anti-VEGF treatment, two approaches are conventionally applied. In the case of &quot;pro re nata&quot;, the patient comes at fixed intervals, but treatment is only administered if an activity is detected (i.e., the presence of fluid). In the case of &quot;treat-and-extend&quot;, the patients always receive treatment, but the interval to the next visit is extended if the lesion is inactive.
Recently, researchers have started to apply AI algorithms to predict the future need for treatment.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology practice guidelines do not recommend laser coagulation therapy for macular degeneration, but state that it may be useful in people with new blood vessels in the choroid outside of the fovea who do not respond to drug treatment. There is strong evidence that laser coagulation will result in the disappearance of drusen but does not affect choroidal neovascularisation. A 2007 Cochrane review found that laser photocoagulation of new blood vessels in the choroid outside of the fovea is an effective and economical method, but that the benefits are limited for vessels next to or below the fovea.

Photodynamic therapy has also been used to treat wet AMD. The drug verteporfin is administered intravenously; light of a certain wavelength is then applied to the abnormal blood vessels. This activates the verteporfin destroying the vessels.

Cataract surgery could improve visual outcomes for people with AMD, though there have been concerns about surgery increasing the progression of AMD. A randomized controlled trial found that people who underwent immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks) had improved visual acuity and better quality of life outcomes than those who underwent delayed cataract surgery (6 months).

Radiotherapy has been proposed as a treatment for wet AMD but the evidence to support the use of modern stereotactic radiotherapy combined with anti-VEGF is currently uncertain and is awaiting the results of ongoing studies.

Nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitors like they are used in anti-HIV therapy were associated with a reduced risk of developing atrophic macular degeneration. This is because Alu elements undergo L1 (protein)-mediated reverse transcription in the cytoplasm resulting in DNA synthesis. First clinical trials are being prepared as of January 2021.

=== Adaptive devices ===

Because peripheral vision is not affected, persons with macular degeneration can learn to use their remaining vision to partially compensate. Assistance and resources are available in many countries and every state in the U.S. Classes for &quot;independent living&quot; are given and some technology can be obtained from a state department of rehabilitation.

Adaptive devices can help people read. These include magnifying glasses, special eyeglass lenses, computer screen readers, electronic glasses, and TV systems that enlarge the reading material.

Computer screen readers such as JAWS or Thunder work with standard Windows computers.
Also, Apple devices provide a wide range of features (voice-over, screen readers, Braille, etc.).

Video cameras can be fed into standard or special-purpose computer monitors, and the image can be zoomed in and magnified. These systems often include a movable table to move the written material.

Accessible publishing provides larger fonts for printed books, patterns to make tracking easier, audiobooks and DAISY books with both text and audio.

==Epidemiology==

The prevalence of any age-related macular degeneration is higher in Europeans than in Asians and Africans. There is no difference in prevalence between Asians and Africans. The incidence of age-related macular degeneration and its associated features increases with age and is low in people &lt;55 years of age. Smoking is the strongest modifiable risk factor. As of 2008, age-related macular degeneration accounts for more than 54% of all vision loss in the white population in the US. An estimated 8 million Americans are affected with early age-related macular degeneration, of whom over 1 million will develop advanced age-related macular degeneration within the next 5 years. In the UK, age-related macular degeneration is the cause of blindness in almost 42% of those who go blind aged 65–74 years, almost two-thirds of those aged 75–84 years, and almost three-quarters of those aged 85 years or older.

==Research==

===Association with other age-related diseases===
Studies indicate drusen associated with AMD are similar in molecular composition to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and deposits in other age-related diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and atherosclerosis. This suggests that similar pathways may be involved in the etiologies of AMD and other age-related diseases.

===Genetic testing===
Genetic testing can help identify whether a patient with AMD is at a greater risk of developing the condition and can inform disease progression. Genetic testing can also allow researchers to identify whether patients are more or less likely to respond to treatments, such anti-VEGF medication or complement inhibitors. However, there remain several challenges to using predictive tools which incorporate genetic variation in clinical practice. As well as our limited understanding of the way that different genetic variants and environmental factors interact to influence AMD risk, the single nucleotide polymorphisms that are common in the population have small effects on individual patients with AMD. Therefore, there is increasing interest in understanding the functional consequences of rare mutations, which often have more pronounced effects. Genetic testing to guide clinical management is not currently recommended.

===Genome editing===
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing may be used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration caused by &quot;VEGFA&quot;. Scientists described an approach in which engineered lentiviruses are injected into the affected anatomical regions for transient editing that could reduce the area of choroidal neovascularization by 63% without inducing undesired off-target edits or anti-Cas9 immune responses.

=== RPE, L-DOPA and Melanin in amelioration of wet AMD ===

The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (see diagram) has an essential role in the eye. It secretes a large variety of factors including at least 22 proteins important in maintaining the structure, function and micro-environments on the two sides of the RPE. (The two sides of the RPE include the choroid side, where blood vessels form and bring nourishment to the eye, and the photoreceptor side, with rods and cones that receive light signals.) In particular, the RPE secretes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at its basement membrane, with the VEGF reaching the choriocapillaris to maintain proper blood vessel formation in the choroid region.

Many factors, including genetic factors, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and inflammatory stressors, may cause pathologic over-production of VEGF by the RPE. This over-production causes excess blood vessel formation in the choroid region (the choriocapillaris), which is a major cause of wet AMD.

It was recently discovered that the aging pigment lipofuscin can be broken down with the help of melanin and drugs through a newly discovered mechanism (chemical excitation). The pigment lipofuscin plays a central role in the development of dry AMD and geographic atrophy. This breakdown can be supported by medication. This discovery can be translated into the development of a therapy to treat dry AMD.

=== Artificial intelligence for prediction ===
Research is exploring if artificial intelligence can help in predicting wet AMD early enough to make prevention possible. A study tested an AI model for predicting whether people with wet AMD in one eye would develop it in the other within six months. Compared to doctors and optometrists the AI model predicted the development more accurately.

==Other types==
There are a few other (rare) kinds of macular degeneration with similar symptoms but unrelated in etiology to Wet or Dry age-related macular degeneration. They are all genetic disorders that may occur in childhood or middle age.
* Vitelliform macular dystrophy
* Sorsby&#x27;s fundus dystrophy is an autosomal dominant, retinal disease characterized by sudden acuity loss resulting from untreatable submacular neovascularisation
* Stargardt&#x27;s disease (juvenile macular degeneration, STGD) is an autosomal recessive retinal disorder characterized by juvenile-onset macular dystrophy, alterations of the peripheral retina, and subretinal deposition of lipofuscin-like material.
Similar symptoms with a very different etiology and different treatment can be caused by epiretinal membrane or macular pucker or any other condition affecting the macula, such as central serous retinopathy.

<text>New flamenco (or nuevo flamenco) or flamenco fusion is a musical genre that was born in Spain, starting in the 1980s. It combines flamenco guitar virtuosity and traditional flamenco music with musical fusion (with genres like jazz, blues, rock, rumba, and years later reggaeton, hip hop, or electronic music).

Las Migas, an all-women quartet from Barcelona, is one of the notable groups. Their 2022 album &quot;Libres&quot; was distinguished as &quot;Best Flamenco Music Album&quot; at the 23rd Annual Latin Grammy Awards.

<doc id="895046" wikidata="Q6601144" url="?curid=895046" title="List of UK singles chart Christmas number ones">
<text>In the United Kingdom, Christmas number ones are singles that top the UK Singles Chart in the week in which Christmas Day falls. The singles have often been novelty songs, charity songs or songs with a Christmas theme. Historically, the volume of record sales in the UK has peaked at Christmas. 

Christmas number-one singles have often been the best-selling song of the year, though in recent years they have been released by reality television contestants and charity efforts. The Christmas number one is announced by BBC Radio 1 on the Friday before Christmas. The most recent Christmas number one single is &quot;Last Christmas&quot; by Wham!.

==History==

The UK Singles Chart began in 1952 – appearing in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;. The positions of all songs are based on weekly sales (from Sunday to Saturday until 2015, then from Friday to Thursday). Before 1987, they were released on a Tuesday due to the need for manual calculation. The emergence of a serious contest for the Christmas number-one spot began in 1973, when the glam rock bands Slade and Wizzard deliberately released festive songs in an effort to reach the top of the charts at Christmas, with Slade&#x27;s &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; beating Wizzard&#x27;s &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot;. The Christmas number-one single was not revealed on Christmas Day itself until 1994.

From 2002 until 2014, the competition for the Christmas number one was dominated by reality television contests, with the winners often heading straight to number one in the week before Christmas. This trend began when &quot;&quot; contestants released the top three singles on the Christmas chart. Between 2005 and 2014, the winners of &quot;The X Factor&quot; took the number-one spot on seven occasions. In 2007, the &quot;X Factor&quot; single was such a strong favourite for number one that bookmakers began taking bets on which song would be the &quot;Christmas Number Two&quot; instead. Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; outsold Joe McElderry in 2009 following a successful Facebook campaign against this trend. This made them the first group to get a Christmas number one with a download-only single, and resulted in the most download sales in a single week in UK chart history. Similar campaigns in 2010 promoting acts such as Biffy Clyro, John Cage and the Trashmen were unsuccessful.

In 2011, the Military Wives and Gareth Malone, both involved with the reality television show &quot;The Choir&quot;, outsold &quot;X Factor&quot; winners Little Mix and a host of social network campaigns for various novelty acts. In 2012, a supergroup cover of &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot;, supporting charities associated with the Hillsborough disaster, reached the number one ahead of &quot;The X Factor&quot;″s James Arthur. Following the UK Charts&#x27; move to Fridays, the Christmas number one is revealed on Christmas Day whenever it falls on a Friday, such as in 2015 and 2020; the former year&#x27;s chart was the first in a decade to not feature the &quot;X Factor&quot; winner&#x27;s single in the top two. Amazon Music has released a number of exclusive festive tracks since 2018, recorded with acts such as Justin Bieber, Jess Glynne, and Ellie Goulding, none of which have topped the Christmas chart, though Goulding&#x27;s track later reached number one. More recently, non-traditional acts have been successful with novelty songs released for charity; most notably, YouTuber LadBaby achieved number one every year between 2018 and 2022, each time raising money for the Trussell Trust, before voluntarily ending their streak by not releasing a Christmas single in 2023. 

==Records==
LadBaby is the act with the most Christmas number ones with five, surpassing the Beatles&#x27; previous record in 2022. On two occasions, in 1963 and 1967, the Beatles had both the Christmas number one and the number two, the first act to have achieved this. As part of two acts, George Michael repeated the feat with Band Aid and Wham! in 1984, and Ed Sheeran did so in 2017 with duets with Beyoncé and Eminem, and again in 2021 with duets with LadBaby and Elton John. Paul McCartney has been top eight times with various acts (four as The Beatles, and one each as Wings, Band Aid, Band Aid 20, and The Justice Collective). Cliff Richard has spent four Christmases at number one; two as a solo act, one with The Shadows and one as part of Band Aid II. The Spice Girls later equalled the then-record of three consecutive Christmas number ones, from 1996 to 1998; Spice Girl Melanie C achieved a fourth Christmas number one as a member of the Justice Collective in 2012, which also gave Robbie Williams his third. In 2022, LadBaby became the first act to achieve five consecutive number ones.

&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; by Queen, which reached the number-one spot at Christmas 1975 and 1991, was the only record to have reached the top twice, until &quot;Last Christmas&quot; by Wham!, which topped the charts in both 2023 and 2024, making it the first consecutive Christmas number one. &quot;Mary&#x27;s Boy Child&quot; is the only song to be Christmas number one for two artists – Harry Belafonte in 1957 and Boney M. in 1978 – although &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; has been Christmas number one for three generations of Band Aid. The original version of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; is the second-bestselling single in UK history (behind &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot; by Elton John), while &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; is third.

<text>John Jay Hooker, Jr. (August 24, 1930 – January 24, 2016) was an American attorney, entrepreneur, political gadfly and perennial candidate from Nashville, Tennessee, who was the Democratic nominee for Governor of Tennessee in 1970 and 1998.

==Early life==
John Jay Hooker was born to relative wealth in one of the Nashville area&#x27;s more prominent families in 1930. His father, John Jay Hooker, Sr., was an attorney, as is John Jay&#x27;s brother, Henry Hooker, who became his law partner in the former firm of Hooker, Hooker, and Willis. Hooker was a direct descendant of William Blount, who signed the Constitution of the United States and who was appointed by President George Washington in 1790 to be the &quot;Governor of all the lands south of the Ohio River&quot;. In 1796, Governor Blount was elected the president of the Constitutional Convention of Tennessee.

==Legal career==
Hooker attended Sewanee Military Academy (now St. Andrew&#x27;s-Sewanee School) and graduated from Nashville&#x27;s Montgomery Bell Academy. Hooker attended college at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. He then served two years in the United States Army Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps as an investigator. Upon discharge from the service, Hooker attended Vanderbilt University Law School. He graduated and was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1957. He then practiced law with his father in the law firm of Hooker, Keeble, Dodson, and Harris, one of the most prominent law firms in Tennessee. In 1960, Hooker left his father&#x27;s law firm to start a new law firm and one year later was joined by his brother Henry Hooker, and two years later by William R. Willis, forming the law firm of Hooker, Hooker, and Willis, which eventually became a ten-man law firm. This firm became the general counsel of the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot; and several other businesses by the time Hooker ran for governor in 1966. Struck by the inequalities in the southern society that confronted him at the time, he became identified as a young man with progressive Democratic politics. While practicing law, he also began a series of diverse business investments.

In 1958, Tennessee Governor Frank G. Clement asked Hooker and prominent Nashville attorney Jack Norman Sr. to become involved in the state&#x27;s investigation of Raulston Schoolfield, an allegedly corrupt Chattanooga state judge. Based on the Norman/Hooker findings, the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to impeach Schoolfield. Norman and Hooker were then retained to prosecute Schoolfield before the Tennessee State Senate, which convicted him on several counts. At the time, Robert F. Kennedy was general counsel of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management, which was investigating labor corruption. In this capacity, Kennedy launched an investigation of Raulston Schoolfield. Kennedy came to Tennessee and testified in the Schoolfield impeachment trial. Thereafter, he and Hooker became close friends and remained so until the time of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in 1968.

==Political career==
In 1959, Hooker married the former Eugenia &quot;Tish&quot; Fort. They had three children, Dara, Kendall, and Blount, who was named after William Blount; he also had a son by a second marriage, James Thomas Lovell. Fort family members were co-founders along with other families of the former National Life and Accident Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, WSM radio and the Grand Ole Opry country music program. Hooker also was close friends with Amon Evans, whose family then owned and published &quot;The Tennessean&quot;. Thereafter, Hooker convinced Evans to employ John Seigenthaler as the editor of the newspaper. Seigenthaler likewise had an association with Robert F. Kennedy that emanated from the Schoolfield investigation and trial. Thereafter, Seigenthaler was a major political supporter of Robert Kennedy and of Hooker.

With the support and backing of the Evans family and John Seigenthaler, Hooker decided to enter the 1966 Democratic primary for governor of Tennessee. His opponent was Buford Ellington, a former governor attempting a return to the office who had the strong backing of the incumbent governor, Clement, and President Lyndon Johnson, who was Ellington&#x27;s close personal friend and who had appointed him to a prominent position at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Ellington was also strongly backed by the other Nashville newspaper, the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;. Supported by some of the more progressive members of the Nashville business community and using innovative advertising such as sponsoring NASCAR driver Buddy Baker&#x27;s racecar, Hooker underwent a blistering counterattack which was mounted by Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Old Guard&quot; supporters. Hooker ran fairly well in the urban and rural areas but lost badly in the suburbs, to which the Old Guard&#x27;s support had largely moved in the post-World War II era. Ellington went on to an easy victory in November, with no Republican opposition, the last time such a circumstance was to occur in Tennessee.

During the next four years, Hooker divided his time between two major activities – investments and planning to run for governor again in 1970. By this time Hooker had many diversified investments including Whale Inc. and a chain of fried chicken restaurants with country comedian Minnie Pearl and gospel singer Mahalia Jackson. His rationale for the chicken restaurants was just as Pepsi had long made a large amount of money as the primary competitor to Coca-Cola, someone else stood to make a comparable fortune as the primary competitor to Kentucky Fried Chicken. Hooker was also closely involved around the same time with the Frist family and others in the formation of what became the first major for-profit healthcare chain, the Hospital Corporation of America.

Hooker won the 1970 Democratic nomination for governor of Tennessee over a host of competitors, most notably the candidate of the &quot;Old Guard&quot;, Nashville attorney Stan Snodgrass, who had the endorsement of the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;. In the past, the Democratic nomination would have assured him victory in November. But many things had changed in Tennessee in the four years since his loss to Ellington. For one, the Republican Party was benefitting greatly from the Southern strategy of then-President Richard Nixon to reach out to rural and working-class urban Southern whites who were disturbed by desegregation and other rapid social changes. Tennessee Republicans, only just over two years from failing to field a gubernatorial candidate, had even managed to organize the Tennessee House of Representatives for the first (and only) time in the 20th century in 1969, and they were not about to allow what appeared to them to be a golden opportunity to pass them by. In 1966, Howard Baker had beaten Governor Frank Clement for the United States Senate because the Democratic party was divided between the Clement/Ellington forces and the anti-Clement/Ellington forces, as best exemplified in the heated primary battle that year between Ellington and Hooker, and the absence of a gubernatorial nominee had in fact allowed Republicans to focus almost all of their energies on electing Baker to the Senate seat.

Events, as well as people, seemed to conspire against Hooker in the fall of 1970. The Republicans had staged a very hard-fought primary race of their own but had come out of it largely united behind the candidacy of Memphis dentist Dr. Winfield Dunn, former chairman of the Shelby County Republican Party. Many of Snodgrass&#x27; erstwhile supporters, including the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;, endorsed Dunn. At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission had in 1969 announced an investigation into Minnie Pearl&#x27;s Chicken, and over time as a consequence of the investigation the price the stock had declined from a high of $40 a share to approximately 50 cents a share.

Simultaneously, Democratic Senator Albert Gore, Sr. was running an equally hard-fought and ultimately unsuccessful campaign for a fourth term against Chattanooga Congressman Bill Brock. The friendly relationship both Gore and Hooker shared with the Kennedy family became an issue, especially in light of Ted Kennedy&#x27;s involvement in the Chappaquiddick incident the previous year. Republicans and &quot;Old Guard&quot; detractors alike pilloried the two, leading to a Republican sweep and for the first time in the post-Reconstruction era the Republicans held the Tennessee governorship and both United States Senate seats (although, curiously, they lost control of the state House of Representatives and did not gain it again it until the beginning of the 21st century).

Hooker was never convicted of any criminal wrongdoing in the SEC/Minnie Pearl Chicken case. Nonetheless, the SEC investigation, which lasted three years, caused the company virtually to liquidate, although a few outlets continued to function into the 1980s. Hooker claimed until his death that the SEC investigation was unjustified and totally politically inspired by the Nixon Administration, which wanted to defeat Albert Gore Sr. and Hooker because they were anti-war candidates. Hooker also claimed that the Nixon political &quot;machine&quot; challenged Hooker and Gore as part of its &quot;Southern strategy&quot;.

==Later life==
Hooker served as chairman of STP Corporation from 1973 to 1976. In 1976 he entered the Democratic Primary for Brock&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat and was at first perhaps favored to win the nomination but was by defeated Jim Sasser for the nomination.

In 1979, Hooker arranged for the sale of &quot;The Tennessean&quot; newspaper to Gannett, which had earlier purchased the &quot;Banner&quot; but preferred to own morning rather than evening papers. At the same time, his own investment group purchased the &quot;Banner&quot; from Gannett (the two papers were linked by a joint operating agreement) and Hooker became publisher of the very paper that had so tormented him only nine years earlier. In retrospect, he has called this perhaps the greatest single moment of his life. Hooker, however, sold his portion of the &quot;Banner&quot; in 1982 and, for a period of time, became chairman of United Press International, the historical but faltering competitor to the Associated Press in the wire service news business.

Hooker&#x27;s fortunes seemed to ebb and flow in the 1980s. At one point, he became rather prosperous again. He promoted a new fast-food chain, Hooker&#x27;s Hamburgers, named for himself, which sold hamburgers from small, drive-by-only buildings, operating this venture from 1984 to 1986 before selling it for $3 million. One of these outlets was built in the Nashville area and several more in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.

Hooker began to file to run for various political offices including governor, Senator, Congressman, and others, for the purpose of acquiring the legal standing to sue all of these persons running for the office for taking campaign contributions from &quot;out of state&quot; contributors, which according to his legal theories were both illegal and unconstitutional. Hooker continued to bring lawsuits in that regard down through the early part of the 21st century. In 1995 he sued President Bill Clinton, as well as all of the other presidential candidates, for accepting certain campaign contributions, which according to his theory were unconstitutional. He sued the Tennessee Supreme Court, saying their elections under the &quot;Modified Missouri Plan&quot; were unconstitutional, eventually forcing them to recuse themselves from their own case and require the empanelment of a special State Supreme Court to hear the charges (this panel dismissed Hooker&#x27;s claims).

Hooker received the 1998 Democratic nomination for governor. No other prominent Democrat had filed to oppose incumbent Republican governor Don Sundquist, and Hooker defeated a field of other &quot;token&quot; candidates as well as the &quot;serious&quot; candidate with union backing, Mark Whitaker. Hooker won the nomination based on name recognition among older Democrats, who in Tennessee are generally the most reliable primary voters. He ran best in the rural areas and with urban blacks, who had always provided him with a core support group. While not formally disavowing him, the regular Democratic Party organization did almost nothing to promote his candidacy, and Hooker had disavowed the formal fundraising process as unethical and immoral. Hooker received about 30 percent of the vote in the November general election. At this time, Governor Sundquist had a 72 percent approval rating. Hooker remained a political activist, running for Congress in 2002 and again suing all his opponents, and then for Chancery Court judge in 2004 as an Independent against Chancellor Claudia Bonnyman. He sued her for taking campaign contributions from lawyers who practiced in her court and then attended fundraisers held by her at which, according to Hooker, she furnished them with food and drink as prohibited by Article X Section 3 of the Tennessee Constitution.
In 2006 Hooker filed to run for the Democratic nomination for both governor of Tennessee and United States Senator. Despite refusing to raise or spend any money in these efforts, Hooker finished third in the senatorial primary and second in the gubernatorial primary held on August 3.

He ran for Governor as an Independent in the 2014 election, and in 2015 worked to legalize physician-assisted suicide in Tennessee.

On January 24, 2016, John Jay Hooker died of cancer at the age of 85.

<text>The Thunder Bay Museum is located in Thunder Bay, Ontario. It is operated by The Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society, incorporated in 1972 as the successor to the Thunder Bay Historical Society.

The Museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, the Canadian Heritage Information Network, the Ontario Historical Society, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

==History==
The Thunder Bay Historical Society was founded October 2, 1908 at the instance of Barlow Cumberland, president of the Ontario Historical Society. Peter McKellar served as president of the Thunder Bay Historical Society from 1908 to 1923.

Since 1994 the museum has been housed in the former Fort William police station and court house near Thunder Bay City Hall. The three-storey building, designed by architect Robert Mason, was erected in 1910 and is an example of Classical Revival architecture, with its two large Corinthian columns and pilasters. Fund raising is under way to restore the cornice and other missing architectural elements. The interior of the building has been treated with complete renovations since 1994, including an overhaul of its HVAC system and the addition of a wheelchair ramp. An annex was enlarged and converted to a storage area for the collection. Recently a visible storage gallery was built in front of the annex to display vehicles and other large items in the museum&#x27;s collection.

==Collection==
The first floor gallery features permanent exhibits on various aspects of local history. The second floor gallery is known as the James Murphy Room and is dedicated to meetings and programming, such as birthday parties and themed march &amp; summer break camps for children. The third floor gallery features military and music exhibits, local and traveling exhibit space as well as a multipurpose room available for rentals.

The museum collects objects of regional interest, such as dolls, pictures and furniture, and its collection includes a firetruck. The archives has 130 metres of linear records, 1900 maps and plans, 150,000 photographic images and a 2200 volume library.

==Program==
The Society produces an annual peer-reviewed journal entitled &quot;Papers &amp; Records.&quot; It is also publishes a number of books annually on a variety of local and regional interest.

<text>Blood limes (or &#x27;Australian Blood Lime&#x27;) are a hybrid citrus fruit developed by the CSIRO project to investigate salt-resistant crops.

While the limes proved suitable for high-salt conditions, they have seen no commercial development; the first commercial crop appeared in markets in Australia in July 2004, and are under consideration for export.

The blood lime is smaller than most limes, approximately long by diameter, and somewhat more sweet than the standard. It is egg-shaped in the winter. The flesh inside a blood lime is composed of red-orange vesicles. The skin can be eaten with the fruit. It is usually red or burgundy, but can sometimes be green like the standard lime.

The blood lime is a cross between the red finger lime (&quot;Citrus australasica var. sanguinea&quot;) and the &#x27;Ellendale Mandarin&#x27; hybrid. The Ellendale is a sweet orange/mandarin cross. The medium-sized trees, which have thorns, may be used as ornamental plants.

<doc id="895075" wikidata="Q618590" url="?curid=895075" title="Hummer H2">
<text>The Hummer H2 is a full-size off-road sport utility vehicle (SUV) that was marketed by Hummer and built in the AM General facility under contract from General Motors from 2002 until 2009. It is based on a modified GMT820 GM three-quarter-ton pickup truck in the front and a half-ton 1500 frame in the rear. A four-door pickup truck version with a midgate that opens the vehicle&#x27;s interior to the external cargo bed was introduced for the 2005 model year as the H2 SUT (sport utility truck).

==Background==
In 2001 and 2002, GM allowed journalists to examine early versions of the Hummer H2, which were still under development.

The H2 was built by AM General under contract with General Motors at AM General Commercial Assembly Plant in Mishawaka, Indiana.

==Features==

=== Standard ===
Standard features included air conditioning with tri-zone climate controls, an adjustable, leather-wrapped steering wheel with radio controls, cruise control, leather upholstery, heated front, and rear seats, 8-way power front seats, dual memory system, BOSE premium sound system, single-CD/cassette player and later in 2004, a six-disc CD changer, then in 2007, a single CD-player with MP3 capability, an auxiliary input jack and DVD player, outside-temperature indicator, compass, rear radio controls, independent front torsion bar suspension, rear five-link coil spring suspension developed for the H2, oversized tires with wheels scripted &quot;HUMMER&quot;, universal garage door opener and remote engine start (2007 and 2009).

=== Optional ===
Options for the H2 include adjustable rear suspension (which is included within the Adventure Package), a broad power sunroof, rearview camera, DVD entertainment system, navigation system, ladder, custom grilles, side step bars, Air compressor with road assistance kit, and 20&quot; chrome wheels (slightly different from stock wheels).

==2008 updates==
For 2008, the Hummer H2 and H2 SUT received an update. While essentially unchanged on the exterior, the H2 and H2 SUT interiors were redesigned. This included a new instrument cluster with improved gauges and Driver Information Center (DIC) based on the higher-trim GMT900 trucks/SUVs, a new leather-wrapped steering wheel, three new radios with a Bose premium audio system and auxiliary audio inputs (including a new touchscreen GPS navigation radio with DVD audio and video playback while the transmission is in the park position, and XM Nav-Traffic capabilities), a new rear seat DVD entertainment system, Bluetooth hands-free calling capabilities, enhanced voice activation, new OnStar hardware with buttons moved from the rearview mirror to the overhead console, a lower dashboard-mounted radio, new dual-zone climate controls, new rear seat audio system controls, a new dash-mounted control knob for the 4X4 system to replace the old pushbutton controls, brushed aluminum interior trim panels, new interior color options, available remote engine start, and a center dashboard-mounted analog clock.

Also for 2008, a new 6.2 L V8 gasoline engine replaced the previous 6.0 L, with a new 6L80-E six-speed automatic transmission, replacing the 4L65-E four-speed automatic.

Hummer launched a special 2009 Black Chrome Limited Edition featuring a new paint color, Sedona Metallic. All Black Chrome editions also had Sedona interior, black chrome accents instead of standard chrome, and unique 20-inch black chrome wheels. Initially, there were supposed to be 1,000 to 1,300 Black Chrome editions. However, due to the mid-year production shutdown, only six were ever actually made, and they were not made available to the public.

==Fuel economy==
General Motors was not required to provide official fuel economy ratings for the H2 due to the vehicle&#x27;s heavy gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). Prior to 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) exempted vehicles with a GVWR over from fuel economy standards and testing.

<text>Daniel Paul Schreber (; 25 July 1842 – 14 April 1911) was a German judge who was famous for his personal account of his own experience with schizophrenia. Schreber experienced three distinct periods of acute mental illness. The first of these, in 1884-1885, was what was then diagnosed as dementia praecox (later known as paranoid schizophrenia or schizophrenia, paranoid type). He described his second mental illness, from 1893 to 1902, making also a brief reference to the first disorder from 1884 to 1885, in his book &quot;Memoirs of A Nervous Illness&quot; (). The &quot;Memoirs&quot; became an influential book in the history of psychiatry and psychoanalysis because of its interpretation by Sigmund Freud. There is no personal account of his third disorder, in 1907–1911; however, some details about it can be found in the Hospital Chart (in the Appendix to Lothane&#x27;s book). During his second illness he was treated by Paul Flechsig (Leipzig University Clinic), Reginald H. Pierson (Lindenhof), and, from 29 June 1894 to 20 December 1902, Guido Weber (Royal Public Asylum, Sonnenstein).

== Early life, education, and career ==
Schreber was born on 25 July 1842 in Leipzig, Germany, the second oldest of five children of physician Daniel Gottlieb Moritz Schreber (1808-1861) and Louise Henrietta Pauline Haase (1815-1907). His paternal great-grandfather was Daniel Gottfried Schreber. Throughout his life, his family suffered from various mental illnesses: his father experienced lifelong depression and his older brother committed suicide in 1877.

Schreber graduated from St. Thomas School in 1860, began work as a judge for the Ministry of Justice in 1867, and received a doctorate in jurisprudence from University of Leipzig in 1869. He married Ottilie Sabine Behr (1857-1912) in 1878.

==Schizophrenia==

=== Timeline ===
In 1884, Schreber ran for Reichstag and lost. This had a negative effect on his mental health, causing him to enter an asylum for six months. He was treated by psychiatrist Paul Flechsig and left &quot;completely recovered&quot;, returning to work in 1886. In October 1893, Schreber became presiding judge of an Oberlandesgericht court and his wife had a stillbirth. He shortly readmitted himself to Fleschsig&#x27;s clinic seeking treatment for insomnia. Starting from November 9, the persistence of insomnia became so unbearable that it drove him to the brink of suicide. His condition worsened in the following years and he was eventually transferred to Sonnenstein Castle. By 1899 he entered remission and was deemed &quot;capable of meeting the demands of everyday life&quot;, though still confident in his schizophrenic delusions. He wrote his memoir a year later. Schreber took legal action to be released and won in 1902, but was re-institutionalised in 1907 after his mother died and his wife had a stroke. Schreber died on 14 April 1911 in the Leipzig-Dosen asylum.

=== Experiences ===
Schreber woke up one morning with the thought that &quot;it really must be rather pleasant to be a woman succumbing to intercourse&quot;. He was alarmed and felt that this thought had come from somewhere else, not from himself. He even hypothesized that the thought had come from a doctor who had experimented with hypnosis on him; he thought that the doctor had telepathically invaded his mind. He believed his primary psychiatrist, Paul Flechsig, had contact with him using a &quot;nerve-language&quot; of which Schreber said humans are unaware. He believed that hundreds of people&#x27;s souls took special interest in him, and contacted his nerves by using &quot;divine rays&quot;, telling him special information, or requesting things of him. During one of his stays at the Sonnenstein asylum, he concluded that there are &quot;fleeting-improvised-men&quot; in the world, which he believed were divinely fabricated men, as miracles to provide Schreber with &quot;play-with-humans&quot; in light of a depopulation of the world.

As his psychosis progressed, he believed that God was turning him into a woman, sending rays down to enact &#x27;miracles&#x27; upon him, including little men to torture him. Schreber was released from psychiatric hospitals around 1902, shortly before the publication of his book.

=== Worldview ===

The fundamental unit of Schreber&#x27;s ruminations were what he called &quot;nerves&quot;, which were said to compose both the human soul and the nature of God in relation to humanity. Each human soul was composed of nerves that derived from God, whose own nerves were then the ultimate source of human existence. Schreber&#x27;s thought that God&#x27;s nerves and those of humanity existed parallel to one another except when the &quot;Order of the World&quot; was violated which constituted the fundamental premise of Schreber&#x27;s memoirs, in which the two universes experienced dangerous &quot;nerve-contact&quot; with each other. For Schreber, this was focused upon his personal and institutional relationship with Flechsig, who became a rebellious &quot;nerve specialist&quot; by virtue of his psychiatric power in contrast to the &quot;Omnipotence&quot; of God.

The peculiar universe of Schreber&#x27;s was mediated by the activity of rays, which could assume a &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;impure&quot; relation; these rays could be controlled by Flechsig or emanated strictly from God, who sought to influence Schreber and his reality by &quot;divine miracles&quot;. The rays had the capacity for independent activity, though they were distinguished from souls and nerves (generally identical) which emanated from other human beings deceased or living. Within Schreber&#x27;s cosmology the universe as an observable reality, and the Sun especially, was a partially independent realm which God merely communicated through, using rays and miracles to influence at times when the &quot;Order of the World&quot; needed to be adjusted. Strictly speaking, God only initiated nerve-contact with human beings through dreams or inspired states (in poetry, etc.), or when humans had become corpses and returned to the &quot;forecourts of Heaven&quot; after purification to rejoin the &#x27;nerve soul&#x27; of God. However, the entire crisis which Schreber describes in his book is the dangerous combination between humanity and God within the mind of Schreber.

Schreber&#x27;s ruminations can be schematized in this way:

*The &quot;forecourts of Heaven&quot; - The &quot;states of Blessedness&quot; where deceased humans&#x27; souls reside after a process of &quot;purification&quot;. These are called the &quot;anterior realms of God&quot; in contraposition to the &quot;posterior&quot; realms which consist of the Upper (Ormuzd) and Lower (Ariman) gods (clearly derived from ancient Iranian religion). The inferior god is especially attracted by the people of the &quot;brown race&quot; (the Semites), while the superior god by the people of the &quot;blond race&quot; (the Aryans). Such gods are endowed with their own instinct of self-preservation.
*The Universe - Separated from the transcendental sphere of God providing the human/material world and yet threatening God&#x27;s invested existence within it; celestial bodies allow the means for God&#x27;s life/light to interact with His creations
*Divine rays - Semi-sentient entities (which are the cosmic fuel of God&#x27;s Omnipotence, and influence Schreber and the world but can be manipulated by Flechsig)
*Nerves/Souls - The spiritual bodies of humans which are active whether the living person is alive or dead, and go through various states of purification in order to return to God&#x27;s nerves in a &quot;state of Blessedness&quot;

There is no Hell in Schreber&#x27;s cosmology.

== Interpretations ==

=== Freud ===

Although Sigmund Freud never interviewed Schreber himself, he read his &quot;Memoirs&quot; and drew his own conclusions from it in an essay entitled &quot;Psycho-Analytic Notes on an Autobiographical Account of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)&quot; (1911). Freud thought that Schreber&#x27;s disturbances resulted from repressed homosexual desires, which in infancy were oriented at his father and brother. Repressed inner drives were projected onto the outside world and led to intense hallucinations which were first centred on his physician Flechsig (projection of his feelings towards his brother), and then around God (who represented Schreber&#x27;s father, Daniel Gottlob Moritz Schreber). During the first phase of his illness Schreber was certain that Flechsig persecuted him and made direct attempts to murder his soul and change him into a woman (he had what Freud thought to be emasculation hallucinations, which were in fact, according to Schreber&#x27;s words an &quot;unmanning&quot; (&quot;Entmannung&quot;) experience. In the next period of his ailment he was convinced that God and the order of things demanded of him that he must be turned into a woman so that he could be the sole object of sexual desire of God. Schreber indicates November 1895 as the period in which the connection between the fantasy of &quot;unmanning&quot; and the idea of having been invested by God with the role of redeemer of corrupt humanity was established. Sex change is justified by Schreber as the necessary means that God used to allow him to create new men.

Consideration of the Schreber case led Freud to revise received classification of mental disturbances. He argued that the difference between paranoia and dementia praecox is not at all clear, since symptoms of both ailments may be combined in any proportion, as in Schreber&#x27;s case. Therefore, Freud concluded, it may be necessary to introduce a new diagnostic notion: paranoid dementia, which does justice to polymorphous mental disturbances such as those exhibited by the judge.

==== Criticism ====
Freud&#x27;s interpretation has been contested by a number of subsequent theorists, most notably Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in their work &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; and elsewhere. Their reading of Schreber&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; is a part of their wider criticism of familial orientation of psychoanalysis and it foregrounds the political and racial elements of the text; they see Schreber&#x27;s written experience of reality abnormal only in its honesty about the experience of power in late capitalism. 

Elias Canetti also devoted the eleventh chapter of his theoretical magnum opus &quot;Crowds and Power&quot;, and the essay &quot;Power and Survival&quot; to a reading of Schreber, claiming that Freud took into consideration only a small part of Schreber&#x27;s text and that his interpretation was completely wrong. According to Canetti, Schreber&#x27;s description of his own paranoia is &quot;by far the most important document about the One... in the entire psychiatric literature.&quot; Schreber fantasized that he was the only man to have survived the plague and leprosy epidemics, thanks to &quot;divine rays&quot;, and this, for Canetti, is &quot;the extreme and final stage of power&quot;.

Finally, Jacques Lacan&#x27;s &quot;Seminar on the Psychoses&quot; and one of his &quot;écrits&quot; &quot;On a Question Prior to Any Possible Treatment of Psychosis&quot; are predominantly concerned with reading and evaluating Schreber&#x27;s text over-against Freud&#x27;s original and originating interpretation.

=== Schatzman ===
In 1974, Morton Schatzman published &quot;Soul Murder&quot;, in which he gave his own interpretation of Schreber&#x27;s psychosis. Schatzman&#x27;s interpretation was based on W. G. Niederland&#x27;s research from the 1950s. (Niederland had previously worked with survivors of Nazi concentration camps.) Schatzman had found child-rearing pamphlets written by Moritz Schreber, Daniel Schreber&#x27;s father, which stressed the necessity of taming the rebellious savage beast in the child and turning him into a productive citizen. Many of the techniques recommended by Moritz Schreber were mirrored in Daniel Schreber&#x27;s psychotic experiences. For example, one of the &quot;miracles&quot; described by Daniel Schreber was that of chest compression, of tightening and tightening. This can be seen as analogous to one of Moritz Schreber&#x27;s techniques of using an elaborate contraption that confined the child&#x27;s body, forcing him to have a &quot;correct&quot; posture at the dinner table. Similarly, the &quot;freezing miracle&quot; might mirror Moritz Schreber&#x27;s recommendation of placing the infant in a bath of ice cubes beginning at age three months. Daniel Paul Schreber&#x27;s older brother, Daniel Gustav Schreber, committed suicide in his thirties. In his 1989 book &quot;Schreber: Father and Son&quot;, Han Israëls argued against the interpretations of Niederland and Schatzman, claiming that Schreber&#x27;s father had been unfairly criticized in the literature.

=== Lothane ===
Henry Zvi Lothane argued against the interpretations of Niederland and Schatzman in his 1992 book, &quot;In Defense of Schreber: Soul Murder and Psychiatry&quot;. Lothane&#x27;s Schreber research included the study of archival records concerning the relationship between Schreber and the other significant people in his life, including his wife and his doctors. On Lothane&#x27;s account, the existing literature on Schreber as a rule (1) leaves substantial gaps in the historical records, which careful archival research could in some measure fill, (2) leaves out psychoanalytically significant relationships, such as that between Schreber and his wife, and (3) overstates the purportedly sadistic elements in Schreber&#x27;s father&#x27;s child-rearing techniques. Lothane&#x27;s interpretation of Schreber also differs from previous texts in that he considers Schreber a worthwhile thinker.

<text>The Jeep Wrangler is a series of compact and mid-size four-wheel drive off-road SUVs manufactured by Jeep since 1986, and currently in its fourth generation. The Wrangler JL, the most recent generation, was unveiled in late 2017 and is produced at Jeep&#x27;s Toledo Complex.

The Wrangler is a direct progression from the World War II Jeep, through the CJ (Civilian Jeeps) produced by Willys, Kaiser-Jeep, and American Motors Corporation (AMC) from the mid-1940s through the 1980s. Although neither AMC nor Chrysler (after it purchased AMC in 1987) have claimed that the Wrangler was a direct descendant of the original military model — both the CJ Jeeps and the conceptually consistent Wrangler, with their solid axles and open top, have been called the Jeep model as central to Jeep&#x27;s brand identity as the rear-engine 911 is to Porsche.

Similar to the Willys MB and the CJ Jeeps before it, all Wrangler models continue to use a separate body and frame, rigid live axles both front and rear, a tapering nose design with flared fenders, a fold-flat windshield and can be driven without doors. Also, with few exceptions, they have part-time four-wheel drive systems, with the choice of high and low gearing, and standard open bodies with removable hard or soft tops. However, the Wrangler series was specifically redesigned to be safer and more comfortable on-road, to attract more daily drivers, by upgrading its suspension, drivetrain, and interior, compared to the CJ line. The suspension on all Wranglers included trackbars and anti-roll bars, and, from the 1997 TJ onwards, front and rear coil springs instead of the previous leaf springs.

From 2004 on, the Wrangler has been complemented with long-wheelbase versions, called Wrangler &quot;Unlimited&quot;. 2004-2006 models were longer versions with 2 doors. In 2004 only automatic transmission-equipped “Unlimited” versions were sold. In 2005 both an automatic and manual 6-speed (NSG-370) were offered. Since 2007, the long-wheelbase Wranglers were four-door models, offering over more room. By mid-2017 the four-door models represented three-quarters of all new Wranglers on the market.

==Background==
Outwardly resembling the Jeep CJ-7, the first Wrangler - formally announced in February 1986 at the 1986 Chicago Auto Show - was said to be based on a new set of design parameters. &quot;The product philosophy behind the two vehicles&quot; François Castaing (AMC VP of Product Engineering) stated, &quot;is completely different&quot;.

The new car had a wider track, slightly less ground clearance, and improved handling, along with additional passenger comfort features. The YJ still had leaf spring suspension similar to that of the CJ – however, the springs were wider, and the first Wrangler had trackbar suspension links and anti-roll bars for improved handling and safety, making it less likely to flip by untrained or unwary drivers.

=== Manufacturing ===
Jeep YJ models were manufactured between 1986 and 1995 at Brampton Assembly, and subsequently at the Toledo South Assembly plant. A major difference in the 1987–1995 models were the rectangular headlights, which reverted to rounded ones in the TJ and then JK versions. In 2006, Wrangler production was moved to Toledo Complex. Post-2006 Wranglers were set apart from their predecessors by the angle of the grille. In all previous models, the grille was flat and even with the front fenders. The newer Wrangler was constructed with a grille that angled out from the top and then continued in a straight line from the midway point, toward the bottom. This decreased the hood length while increasing the length of the fenders. In more recent models, this angle has been lowered more toward the bottom of the grille. In Egypt, the YJ was produced in both short and long-wheelbase versions. The extended wheelbase retained the 2-door design and was dubbed LJ (or labeled as YJL in Egypt&#x27;s Owner&#x27;s Manual). The long-wheelbase continued as TJL (aka J8) inspired the JK&#x27;s 4-door version.

== Models ==
The Wrangler debuted in 1986 as a new model after the discontinuance of the Jeep CJ series. It was revised in 1996, and completely redesigned in 2006. In addition to the model&#x27;s name &quot;Wrangler&quot;, each model received a designation corresponding to its generation: YJ (1986–1995), TJ (1997–2006), JK (2007–2018), and the current JL model. Foreign military versions of the Wrangler have carried the J8 designation which was initially dubbed TJL when first produced at Arab American Vehicle&#x27;s Egyptian plant. The Wrangler-based pickup truck, the Gladiator, began production in 2019 for the 2020 model year.

=== YJ (1986) ===

Although introduced in 1986 (under the control of Renault), and by 1987 (the first model year) under the new ownership of Chrysler, the first-generation Wrangler had been developed by American Motors Corporation (AMC). It featured rectangular headlamps, differing from the round ones on its predecessors, the CJ Jeeps. The new &#x27;Wrangler&#x27; was a new design, and compared to the CJ-7, it had a wider track, slightly less ground clearance, and improved comfort, safety, and handling. It continued many features of the CJ-7 such as part-time 4WD, live rigid front and rear axles on leaf springs, and having an open body on a separate frame. It maintained the same wheelbase.

=== TJ (1996) ===

Introduced in 1996 as a 1997 model, the second-generation Wrangler reintroduced the round headlamps from the classic Jeep models. The main engine was the AMC 242 4.0 L inline 6. From the Wrangler TJ onwards, all Wranglers were fitted with coil-spring instead of leaf-spring suspension, the automatic shifter was relocated to the floor.

In 2004, a long-wheelbase &quot;Unlimited&quot; model was introduced. Furthermore, starting in 2006, Israeli Automotive Industries Ltd. produced the first five-door Jeep Wrangler derivative, built under license from Chrysler, for the Israel Defense Forces, based on a wheelbase Wrangler (TJ).


=== JK (2006) ===

The third-generation Wrangler was released in 2006 for the 2007 model year. Developed under the ownership of DaimlerChrysler, the JK was Jeep&#x27;s first Wrangler that was a completely clean-sheet design of the body, frame, and suspension. New features for the Wrangler included power windows, remote power door locks, navigation, as well as electronically detachable sway bars on some models.

Along with the traditional 2-door model, a 4-door &quot;Unlimited&quot; model was released, offering considerably more room, thanks to an over 20 inches (50 cm) longer wheelbase. These became quite successful sellers. By mid-2017 the four-door models represented three-quarters of all new Wranglers on the market.

On September 2, 2011, Jeep announced a partnership with Activision for the second year in a row, to make a special edition &quot;Modern Warfare 3&quot; Jeep based on the Wrangler Rubicon model. The Jeep comes with various features including the interior and exterior being designed with a &quot;Modern Warfare 3&quot; theme. Jeep dealers started selling this model in November 2011.

=== JL (2017) ===

The fourth-generation Wrangler was unveiled in late 2017 for the 2018 model year. The JL features additional powertrains over the Pentastar V6, a redesigned 8-speed automatic transmission, an easier fold-flat windshield, new zipperless soft tops, blind-spot monitoring, a backup camera, and a more modern interior. Powertrains for the 2018 models included a 2.0-liter turbocharged I4 making and of torque and the 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 gasoline engine making and of torque. Additionally, a 2.2-liter turbodiesel I4 was first available in Europe and since 2020 in North America with EcoDiesel engines. For the 2021 model year, Jeep introduced a plug-in hybrid version of the Wrangler, dubbed the Wrangler 4xe, that went on sale in early 2021. The Wrangler 4xe provides an estimated of all-electric range. In late summer 2021 Jeep released the Rubicon 392 model, the most powerful JL ever produced. It comes with a 6.4L Hemi V8 that produces and of torque. Its 470-horsepower engine powers through a quarter mile in 13.0 seconds, going 0-60 mph in just 4.5 seconds.

===Electric Wrangler===
In September 2008, Chrysler vice-chair Tom LaSorda unveiled a range-extended electric 4-door Wrangler along with a similarly engineered Town and Country minivan and a purely electric sports car. The Wrangler would have a range before a gas engine starts and begins supplying additional electricity. The 4xe has a 17kWh battery with a usable capacity of 15kWh and has an all-electric range of 21 miles (34 kilometers) per charge. The 4xe is a plug-in Hybrid that takes advantage of Jeep&#x27;s new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine.

In early 2021 Jeep created the Magneto concept using a battery electric powertrain on a slightly modified Jeep JL two-door frame and body. The Magneto sports a JPP 2-inch (50mm) lift kit, 17-inch Lights Out black metallic wheels with 35-inch (958mm) mud-terrain tires, custom roll cage, Mopar Rock Rails, steel bumpers with a Warn winch, and a steel belly pan.

In April 2022, Jeep unveiled a new concept: the Wrangler Magneto 2.0. It includes a new electric powertrain calibration, which Jeep refers to as “electronic nitrous oxide” to maintain peak power for as long as 10 seconds. Rated at 625 horsepower and up to 850-footpounds (1152 joules) of torque, the Magneto 2.0 is capable of 0-60 mph (0–100 km/h) in 2 seconds. 

== Recognition ==
The Jeep Wrangler received the 2009 Best Resale Value Award from &quot;Kelley Blue Book&quot; (KBB) in the sport utility vehicle category. In 2012 and for 2013, it was also awarded the Best Resale Value Award from Kelly Blue Book in the compact sport utility vehicle category. The Wrangler also holds the Models to Best Hold Its Value recognition from Kelley Blue Book for 1998, 1999, 2003, 2011, and 2012.

The 2011, 2012, and 2013 Jeep Wranglers have received &quot;Canadian Black Book&#x27;s&quot; Best Retained Value Award for the compact SUV category.

In 2007, The Jeep Wrangler had set the Guinness World Record for the highest altitude attained by a four-wheeled vehicle after ferrying Matthias Jeschke and his Extreme Events adventure team up Chile&#x27;s Ojos del Salado, the highest volcano on Earth (record reached the same year by a Suzuki Samurai). The trek from base camp to the world record height ran from March 7 to March 13, when the team&#x27;s pair of Wrangler Rubicon Unlimiteds checked in at .

In 2007 and for 2013, the magazine &quot;Four Wheeler&quot; awarded the Jeep Wrangler with its Four-Wheeler of the Year Award and in January 2010, they awarded the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon its title of 4x4 of the Decade.

In 1997, 2007, and 2012, the magazine &quot;Petersen&#x27;s 4-Wheel &amp; Off-Road&quot; awarded the Jeep Wrangler with its 4x4 of the Year award.

The 2008 edition of &quot;Forbes&quot; Autos lists the four-wheel-drive convertible Jeep Wrangler at number four among the top ten vehicles with the highest resale value.

In May 2009, &quot;Business Week&quot; magazine named the Wrangler One of the Most Iconic Cars of the Last 20 Years.

A 2018 iSeeCars.com study named the Jeep Wrangler as the vehicle with the lowest depreciation after five years.

<doc id="895089" wikidata="Q3112783" url="?curid=895089" title="Education in Macau">
<text>Most schools in Macau are private or subsidized schools. As of the 2023–2024 school year, there were 76 schools in Macau, including eight public schools and 68 private schools. Of the 73 schools that offered formal education, six were not a part of Macau&#x27;s free education network. many of the schools in Macau are operated by Catholic organizations. 

A basic 15-year compulsory, free education, is offered to those pupils who have been enrolled at the schools which have met certain requirements stipulated by the government.

The majority of schools in Macau are grammar schools, which offer language learning, mathematics, science subjects, and social studies, among others, to pupils. There are only a few vocational schools in Macau, offering technical subjects such as car-repairing, electronics, and constructions.

As prescribed by the Basic Law of Macau, Chapter VI, Article 121, the Government of Macau shall, on its own, formulate policies on education, including policies regarding the educational system and its administration, the language of instruction, the allocation of funds, the examination system, the recognition of educational qualifications and the system of academic awards so as to promote educational development. The government shall also in accordance with law, gradually institute a compulsory education system. Community organizations and individuals may, in accordance with law, run educational undertakings of various kinds.

==History==

According to Sou-kuan Vong and Matilda Wong of the University of Macau, the prevalence of private schools in Macau is due to the Portuguese Macau government practice of not involving itself in educational matters.

By the early 1950s pro-Communist and pro-Nationalist forces competed over how much influence they had in Macau&#x27;s education system. Christian schools in Macau gained strength at the expense of secular schools since the Christian schools received support from Christian organizations: the Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau assisted the Catholic schools, and various churches based in and outside of Macau assisted the Protestant schools. There were ten schools affiliated with Nationalist forces in Macau during the early 1960s, and at the time the Nationalist forces had more influence than Communist ones. After 1967 and 1968 riots disrupted Nationalist forces, that faction&#x27;s schools closed.

As of the 1990s secular private schools, including those supported by the pro-mainland Macau Chinese Education System, other welfare organizations, and philanthropists; and the Christian schools had about equal amounts of influence and numbers of students.

==System of education==

At present, most schools in Macau follow a so-called &quot;local education system&quot;. Six years of primary school education, three years for junior secondary school education and three years for senior secondary school education up to Form 6. In their senior secondary school years, students are usually required to study science, commerce, arts and music. 

Pupils who plan to study further would usually sit for the exam organised by the higher education institutes, or international assessment bodies like Edexcel, CIE and College Board, or the related government bodies in China.

===School grade===
==Mediums of instruction==

The majority of schools offer both Cantonese and English education, and either Cantonese or English is the medium in most schools at the primary and secondary levels. Chinese-Medium-of-Instruction (CMI) schools adopt Cantonese as the medium of instruction for almost all classes. English-Medium-of-Instruction (EMI) schools generally adopt English as the medium of instruction. English is used almost exclusively at the tertiary level.

Macau Portuguese School is currently the only school in Macau offering curricula similar to those of Portugal and a Portuguese-language education for pupils from 1st grade to 12th grade.

The Escola Secundária Luso-Chinesa de Luís Gonzaga Gomes is a public school that has a Chinese and a Portuguese section. The Escola Oficial Zheng Guanying is a pilot project of the government that conducts classes in Mandarin, Portuguese, and English.

There are some students with origins from Macau, Hong Kong, or mainland China who natively speak a variety of Chinese but who have education in English.

==Primary, secondary, and vocational education==

In the 2007–2008 school year, Macau had 55 private preschool, primary and secondary schools with subsidised tuition, 15 private preschool, primary and secondary schools without subsidised tuition, and 13 government preschool, primary and secondary schools, with a total of 83 primary and secondary schools. These schools altogether had 80,223 students and 4,610 teachers.

 Macau parents generally choose schools by their reputations, since Macau does not have territory-wide standard examinations, and there is a preference for religious schools among upper-class parents due to a perceived higher quality of education. the 27 Catholic schools in Macau made up about 36.4% of the educational sectors other than tertiary education.

Since 2007, in accordance with the general education goal of &quot;Love China, love Macau &quot;, China People Education Press in China, which is the official press affiliated to the Ministry of Education of China, has cooperated with the Macao Education and Youth Bureau to compile and publish three textbooks for Macao primary and secondary schools, including the &quot;History&quot; and &quot;Character and Citizenship&quot; and &quot; Geography &quot;.

==Higher education==

There are more than ten higher-learning institutions in Macau. Some students choose to further their studies in the local universities or polytechnics whereas some others choose to further their studies in mainland Portugal, mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, or some other places.

== International schools ==
A number of international schools operate in Macau, such as the School of the Nations,Macau Anglican College and International School of Macao.

Lorna Bradbury, Deputy Literary Editor for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, listed the collection as one of &quot;25 Classic Novels for Teenagers.&quot; Zoe Chace of NPR told interviewer Cara Philbin her reactions during reading the collection as a child: &quot;&quot;Kiss Kiss&quot; is for grown-ups...It was actually the marriages that I remember feeling the worst about...Reading &quot;Kiss Kiss&quot; is one of the first times I can remember a real-life truth staring back at me from a book. I hadn&#x27;t yet thought about the nasty tricks adults play on each other just to hurt each other. Particularly, married adults who aren&#x27;t in love and who might know the other&#x27;s weakness best. My imagination matured.&quot;

<doc id="895102" wikidata="Q1362537" url="?curid=895102" title="Quarter-inch cartridge">
<text>Quarter inch cartridge tape (abbreviated QIC, commonly pronounced &quot;quick&quot;) is a magnetic tape data storage format introduced by 3M in 1972, with derivatives still in use as of 2016. QIC comes in a rugged enclosed package of aluminum and plastic that holds two tape reels driven by a single belt in direct contact with the tape. The tape was originally wide and anywhere from long. Data is written linearly along the length of the tape in one track (mostly on pre-1980 equipment), or written &quot;serpentine&quot;, one track at a time, the drive reversing direction at the end of the tape, and each track&#x27;s data written in the opposite direction to its neighbor. Since its introduction, it has been widely used, and many variations exist. There is a QIC trade association that publishes QIC standards which include interfaces and logical formats. To a very large extent it was the efficiency and openness of this organization which encouraged hardware and software developers to use this type of drive and media.
== Features of QIC ==

The QIC cartridge is distinguished from other types of tape cartridges by containing an endless drive belt which is moved at a uniform speed by a motorised capstan. Since the belt is in contact with the tape, this ensures both that the tape moves at uniform speed, and that neutral tension is maintained at all times. This is in contrast to cassette tapes or DATs, where the tape is moved past the head by a capstan and pinch wheel, but the takeup reel is driven by a servo motor or slipping clutch.

The tape in a QIC cartridge is not physically attached to the reels and is never completely unwound. This is again different from other cassettes or cartridges, which generally have some form of clip anchoring on at least one end of the tape. To ensure that the tape is never completely unwound, each end has a small beginning or end of tape hole which is detected by an optical sensor, and an &quot;early warning&quot; hole further from each end. If a defective drive—for example with fluff in a sensor—winds the tape past the BOT or EOT marker, the tape will detach from the spool and the cartridge will be unusable unless it is reattached.

The design of the QIC tape cartridge is very robust: the aluminium baseplate is thick, and the robust plastic cover can withstand abuse and impacts that would damage other tape formats.

However, because the tape is belt-driven, seeking back and forth can eventually cause the tape to become unevenly tensioned. It is therefore necessary to periodically retension the cartridge. This is accomplished by winding the tape from beginning to end and back in one operation, allowing the belt to equalize itself. For newer QIC drives that use a SCSI interface, there is a SCSI &quot;RETENSION&quot; command to do this.

When the cartridge gets old, the belt may not provide enough friction to turn the takeup spool smoothly. When this happens, the tape will need to be replaced.

In some cases a cartridge must be formatted before use. The capability to do this is in the drive rather than the host computer.

== Generations ==

=== 3M Data Cartridge (DC) ===

The first QIC tape format was the by &quot;Data Cartridge&quot; (DC) format with two internal belt-driven reels and a metal base. The original product, the DC300, has 300 feet of tape and holds 200 kilobytes. Various QIC DC recording formats have appeared over the years, including:

* QIC-11: a four-track format giving 20 MB on a 450 ft DC300XL cartridge
* QIC-24: nine-track, 45 MB or 60 MB on a 450 or 600 ft DC600A cartridge, respectively
* QIC-120: 15-track, 125 MB, DC6150 cartridge
* QIC-150: 18-track, 150 MB, DC6150 cartridge
* QIC-525: 26-track, 525 MB on a 1020 ft DC6525 cartridge
* QIC-1350: 30-track, 1.35 GB on a DC9135 cartridge

Other QIC DC standards include the QIC-02 and QIC-36 drive interface standards. Later QIC DC drives usually use the QIC-104/111 SCSI and QIC-121 SCSI-2 interfaces.

Other Data Cartridge (DC) look-alikes:

* 3M DC600HC, a preformatted tape with 16 tracks on 600 foot DC600A and software-based EOT/BOT detection. HP used these in the HP914x type of cartridge drives.

=== QIC Mini Cartridge (MC) ===
Later, the smaller &quot;Minicartridge&quot; (MC) form-factor was introduced. This is by size and is small enough to fit in a drive bay.

* QIC-40
** 20-track DC2000 mini-cartridge 205 ft. 40 MB 
** 20-track DC2000XL mini-cartridge 307½ ft. 60 MB
* QIC-80
** 28-track DC2080 mini-cartridge 205 ft. 80 MB
** 28-track DC2120 mini-cartridge 307½ ft. 120 MB

The QIC-40 and QIC-80 were designed to use the same floppy disk controller as a standard floppy drive, with MFM or RLL encoding.

=== Travan (TR) ===

Travan is an evolution of the QIC Minicartridge format, sold for personal computer use. This version, developed by 3M, uses a longer and wider (8 mm) tape to give higher capacities.

=== SLR ===
SLR is Tandberg Data&#x27;s name for its line of high-capacity QIC data cartridge drives. As of 2005, Tandberg was the only manufacturer of SLR/QIC drives in the world. The largest SLR drive can hold 70 GB of data (140 GB compressed).

=== QIC-Wide ===

A variant from Sony that uses a wider .315 inch (8 mm) tape and increases the recording density. QIC-Wide drives are backwards compatible with QIC tapes.

=== QIC-EX ===

&quot;QIC Extra&quot;, a modification to support longer tapes and thus more data by the Verbatim Corporation, was made possible by making the cartridges physically longer to accommodate larger spools. In many cases a standard QIC drive and backup package can use the extended length to store additional data, however in some cases an attempt to reformat a QIC-EX cartridge fails since the time taken to traverse the extra length triggers a timeout in the drive or controlling software intended to detect a broken tape.

=== QIC-157 ===

An interface standard for tape drives using the ATAPI (IDE) interface.

<doc id="895104" wikidata="Q5296431" url="?curid=895104" title="Donna Nook">
<text>Donna Nook is a point on the low-lying coast of north Lincolnshire, England, north of the village of North Somercotes and south of Grimsby. The area, a salt marsh, is used by a number of Royal Air Force stations in Lincolnshire for bombing practice and shares its name with RAF Donna Nook. The site was also made available to commercial organisations such as BMARC for firing tests. 

Recognised as an important area for wildlife conservation, it is linked to the similar site at Saltfleetby-Theddlethorpe Dunes National Nature Reserve.

==History==
On Sunday 3 April 1966 13 sailors died on the MV Anzio, from Aberdeen.

==Conservation area==
Wildlife seems to have become accustomed to regular aircraft bombing according to The Wildlife Trust. The name is popularly supposed to be derived from a ship called &quot;The Donna&quot;, part of the Spanish Armada, which sank off the Nook (a small headland) in 1588.

A coastal strip stretching from Saltfleet in the south, to Somercotes Haven in the north, is managed by the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust as a nature reserve. It is part of the land owned by the Ministry of Defence and used as a bombing range. The grey seal population return to breed from October to December every year. From 2007, when about 1,194 pups were born to 3,500 resident grey seal colony, births rates have grown to 2,066 pups born over the 2018 season. A double wooden fence was erected to ensure better separation and protection for both visitors and seals.

The reserve, staffed by full time wardens and volunteer seal wardens, is accessible to the public. Media coverage of Donna Nook has led to a big increase in visitor numbers; it was visited by about 43,000 people in 2006. Surplus money collected through sales is used to further support the protection of seals.

The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust has asked walkers and photographers to stay in the public viewing area and to avoid going out onto the sands, following an increase in seal mortality which coincided with an increase in visitor numbers in 2010 and criticism of the disturbance caused by photographers.

A 2023 initiative under King Charles&#x27; reign, a new combined National Nature Reserve (NNR), has been established linking with the similar site at Saltfleetby-Theddlethorpe Dune, becoming known together as the Lincolnshire Coronation Coast National Nature Reserve. It is the first new NNR declared as part of the King’s Series.

<text>The Chrysler Imperial, introduced in 1926, was Chrysler&#x27;s top-of-the-line vehicle for much of its history. Models were produced under the Chrysler name until 1954, after which Imperial became a standalone make; and again from 1990–93. The company positioned the cars as a prestige marque to rival Cadillac, Continental, Lincoln, Duesenberg, Pierce Arrow, Cord, and Packard. According to &quot;Antique Automobile&quot;, &quot;The adjective &#x27;imperial&#x27; according to Webster&#x27;s Dictionary means sovereign, supreme, superior or of unusual size or excellence. The word imperial thus justly befits Chrysler&#x27;s highest priced model.&quot;

For several decades and multiple generations, the Imperial was the exclusive Chrysler and the favorite choice of luxurious transportation for senior executive leadership, government officials, royalty and various celebrities in comparison to the more affordable Chrysler New Yorker. Over the years the appearance, technological advancements and luxurious accommodations updated with the latest trends and fashionable appearances. Limousines, town cars and convertibles were the usual appearances, while special coachwork choices were provided by the industry&#x27;s best providers, to include Derham, Fleetwood, LeBaron, and others.

The Chrysler Imperial rose was cultivated in 1952 and used to promote the brand.
==1926–1930==
In 1926, Walter P. Chrysler decided to compete with North American marques Cadillac, Lincoln, Packard, Pierce Arrow, Studebaker, Cord, and Duesenberg in the luxury car field, while the newly formed company only had a large displacement straight-six to offer. The new model, called Imperial, had a new engine that was slightly larger than the company&#x27;s standard straight 6 installed in the Chrysler Six. It was a six-cylinder with seven bearing blocks and pressure lubrication of . Large displacement engines provided the horsepower and torque clients wanted and due to the low quality of gasoline fuel at the time, and low compression ratios, 50 bhp was more than adequate. It is estimated that the rating equivalent of early gasoline available varied from 40 to 60 octane and that the &quot;High-Test&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;fighting grade&quot;, probably averaged 50 to 65 octane. The front axle was solid and the suspension consisted of semi-elliptic leaf springs while the rear suspension was a differential axle, and also using semi-elliptic leaf springs. The use of the &quot;imperial&quot; name being exclusively used on Chrysler&#x27;s flagship had been previously used by Buick, Cadillac and Packard for top level limousines. The hood ornament/radiator cap was a stylized Viking Winged helmet.

The car set a transcontinental speed record in the year it was introduced, driving more than in the week. The car was chosen as the pace car for the 1926 Indianapolis 500. The model was designated E-80, the 80 being after the &quot;guaranteed&quot; all-day cruising speed. Acceleration was also brisk, breaking 20 seconds to . Four-speed manual transmission was added in 1930. The attention to luxury and multiple bodystyles was a similar approach to one Mr. Chrysler used as president of the Buick Motor Company, his employer from 1911 to 1919. Chrysler offered a variety of body styles: a two/four-passenger roadster (four passenger if car had the rumble seat), a four-seat coupé, five-passenger sedan and phaeton, and a seven-passenger top-of-the-line limousine. The limo had a glass partition between the front and rear passenger compartments.

Imperials could be distinguished from Chrysler products by the use of a distinctive scalloped hood and radiator shell and a wheelbase, which shared an appearance with Packard and the Buick Master Six. The Berline Limousine was listed at US$3,595 ($ in dollars ).

The 1927 Imperial Series 80 saw minor engineering improvements, while the high compression &quot;Red Head&quot; straight-six was the only engine available on a choice of , or special order wheelbases. Five two-door coachwork choices included roadsters and convertible, while there were nine sedan, town car, phaeton and limousine choices. The top level Town Car was listed at US$5,495 ($ in dollars ). Standard equipment on roadster and phaeton open-body coachwork selections included wind wings and leather exterior door trim panels, while many cars were painted in contrasting two-tone paint. The convertible was equipped with functioning landau irons. In 1927, an Imperial was driven at a high speed along the Lincoln Highway from San Francisco to New York to Los Angeles, covering a total distance of non-stop, with an average speed of .

1928 offered a wheelbase with the designation Series 80L. Coachwork choices expanded with five provided by Briggs, and six choices from LeBaron, one Derham Convertible Sedan, one Phaeton from Locke, and four Dietrich convertible coupes and sedans, listing the Dietrich Convertible Sedan at US$6,795 ($ in dollars ). Total Chrysler calendar year production was recorded at 160,670, their all-time high pre-war until decades later

Model years 1929 and 1930 Series 80L were essentially unchanged from the 1928 version as engineering efforts were focusing on the 1931 Series CG Straight Eight, while there were some engineering advancements, to include thermostatically controlled automatic adjusting exterior radiator shutters, vertical hood louvers and a four-speed manual transmission. Coachbuilder Locke provided four convertible choices in both coupe and sedan configurations, and hydraulic four wheel brakes were now standard on all Chrysler products. The top level 1930 Series 80L Limousine was listed at US$3,575 ($ in dollars ).


==1931–1933==
The all-new 1931 &quot;Chrysler Imperial 8&quot; introduced the new in-line 8-cylinder engine which was shared with the Chrysler Eight Series CP in smaller displacements. The car received a new Chrysler flathead Straight-8 with a Stromberg Model DD-3 carburetor. The Imperial introduced a vee-type radiator, a long straight hood that displayed &quot;torpedo&quot; styling, and wide flowing fenders with a split and slanted windshield and showed visual similarities to the Cord L-29. Various features considered luxurious in nature at the time included dual sun visors, adjustable front seats and steering column, rust-proof fenders, wire-spoked wheels, automatic heater control, safety glass and Lockheed supplied hydraulic brakes. To minimize engine vibration from being felt by passengers, an isolation feature called &quot;Floating Power&quot; was introduced.

The Imperial Series CG offered four sedan coachwork choices from Briggs, while LeBaron offered four convertible coupe and sedan choices. At least ten Individual Custom 2-door coupes were documented from individual coachwork providers Waterhouse, Drauz and LeBaron. These were custom built to specification, and were variously equipped with anything the customer desired—even a Dictaphone. Prices ranged from US$2,745 ($ in dollars ) for the factory supplied four-door, five-passenger Sedan to US$3,575 ($ in dollars ) for the LeBaron Dual Cowl Phaeton. Stock car driver Harry Hartz set numerous speed records with a 1933 Imperial sedan at Daytona Beach, Florida. A roadster was entered in the 1931 24 Hours of Le Mans competition but did not finish due to radiator failure. It was introduced shortly after the Rolls-Royce Phantom II, Mercedes-Benz 770, Packard Eight, Duesenberg Model J, Renault Reinastella, Cadillac Series 355, and Lincoln K-series. Total documented CG production shows that 3,228 of all body style choices were manufactured, including chassis only supplied to individual coachwork providers. A stylized gazelle statuette was added to the Viking Winged helmet radiator cap and hood ornament for all Imperial vehicles starting in 1931.
Model year 1932 introduced the junior Series CH Imperial while the previous Series CG became the Series CL and took the name Imperial Custom to continue to provide individually requested, customized vehicles. The Series CH was related to the Chrysler Series CP in that the straight-eight engine, and most features were shared while the Imperial Series CH was offered with many standard features that were optional on the Series CP. The Series CH and CL featured all steel body work, a double drop &quot;girder truss&quot; chassis frame, split windshields, dual sun visors, and trumpet horns. The ignition was provided by Delco-Remy, the brakes were hydraulic and the transmission was a four-speed manual transmission with an optional automatic vacuum operated clutch. The body styles offered on the Series CH were a two-door, two-passenger roadster convertible with available rumble seat, a four-door sedan or a four-door convertible. The roadster listed price was US$1,925 ($ in dollars ) while the four-door convertible was US$2,195 ($ in dollars ) which made the more esteemed &quot;Imperial&quot; brand almost identically priced to &quot;Chrysler&quot; branded products, while the engine displacement on the Series CH was larger. The 1932 Series CL remained the more prestigious Imperial and all coachwork was provided by LeBaron offering four convertible body styles along with a conventional seven-passenger sedan or eight-passenger limousine, while documented records show one two-passenger Roadster and one Landau Limousine were manufactured. Records show that 32 Series CL Sedan Limousine by LeBaron were sold for US$3,295 ($ in dollars ).

The Series CQ Imperial was all-new for 1933 from the previous Series CH and the wheelbase lost and the Chrysler I8 had reduced displacement. Three two-door, two-passenger coupes to include a Victoria and Roadster Convertible, and two four-door, five-passenger choices with one sedan convertible were offered by Briggs. Mechanical improvements offered were a silent, helical gear three-speed transmission, an improved oil filter and an automatic choke for the Stromberg IV Model EX-32 carburetor. Only three sedan coachwork choices were offered for the Series CL sedan with the wheelbase. Production records document 3,838 Series CQ and 151 Series CL were manufactured, including six Chassis and Cowl only requests.


==1934–1936 ==
The Chrysler Imperial introduced in 1934 offered the &#x27;Airflow&#x27; design, reflecting an interest in streamlining. The car was marketed with the slogan &quot;The car of tomorrow is here today.&quot; The 1934 Series CV featured eight-passenger seating and again an eight-cylinder engine while it was the Chrysler Airflow Series CV with Imperial luxury appearance and additional optional features as standard equipment, including vacuum assisted power brakes and a Stromberg two barrel carburetor Model EE-22. It was the first car to be designed in a wind tunnel. Initial tests indicated that the standard car of the 1920s worked best in the wind-tunnel when pointed backwards with the curved rear deck facing forward. It led to a rethinking of the fundamental design of Chrysler&#x27;s cars with a primary focus on reducing wind noise inside the passenger compartment. Both engine and passenger compartment were moved forward, giving better balance and ride. An early form of unibody construction was employed, giving them a durability advantage in comparison to body on frame construction. It continued to offer a Chrysler engine vibration isolation feature called &quot;Floating Power&quot; and was one of the first automobiles to offer a one piece curved windshield. Chrysler offered both the conventional Airstream models along with the Airflow models under the &quot;Chrysler&quot; marque but only offered the &quot;Imperial&quot; marque with Airflow models.

The 1934 Imperial Airflow Series CV offered the Chrysler flathead straight eight with an aluminum cylinder head and overdrive manual transmission, and body style choices were a two-door coupe, four-door sedan and four-door Town Sedan on a wheelbase, and were priced at US$1,625 ($ in dollars ). The longer wheelbase Imperial Custom Airflow Series CX offered only sedan choices, to include Town Sedan and Limousine choices on a wheelbase for US$2,345 ($ in dollars ). The top level Imperial Custom Airflow Series CW offered a four-door Sedan, Limousine or Town Limousine for US$5,000 ($ in dollars ) using a wheelbase and the Straight Eight. Documented production numbers for 1934 show 2,277 Series CV, 106 Series CX and 67 Series CW were produced. Its prestige was similar to the Cadillac Series 90 limousine, Rolls-Royce Phantom III, Packard Twelve, Mercedes-Benz 770, Renault Suprastella and the Lincoln Custom.

The public was put off by the unconventional styling and the &quot;Airstream&quot; appearance on Chryslers outsold the &quot;Airflow&quot; by 3 to 1. The 1935 Imperial Airflow Series C-2 and Series C-3 were carryover from resources not used for 1934 due to underwhelming sales after the appearance was panned in favor of competitors, while the conventionally styled Chrysler Airstream was better received that replaced the Chrysler Series CA and Series CB. Total production documented records show 2,598 Series C-2 coupes and sedans were manufactured, while just 125 Series C-3 rolled off the assembly line, accounting for both coupe and sedan production. The top level Series CW recorded only 32 limousines that could accommodate eight passengers, offering four different coachwork choices for a minimum listed price of US$5,000 ($ in dollars ).

1936 was the last year for the &quot;Airflow&quot; appearance, while there were some enhancements and features added to entice buyers. A new grille, all-steel roof construction and a luggage compartment was added. The wheelbase was lengthened and the doors and side windows. The front windshield was either split or curved one piece on the Imperial Custom and continued to be extendable from the base outwards while a separate retractable cowl ventilator remained to provide fresh air inside the passenger compartment. Production numbers continued to fall to a total of 4,500 Series C-10 sedans and coupes and 75 Series C-11 sedans and limousines. A total of 10 Series CW were documented to be sold while the actual manufacture date were previous years that were registered, and dated as 1936 models. The pricing structure was simplified as US$1,475 ($ in dollars ) for the Series C-10 for the coupe or sedan, and US$2,475 ($ in dollars ) for the Series C-11 sedan or limousine. While 1936 was the most profitable season for Chrysler since 1929, the Airflow program was cancelled, and the Imperial Custom Airflows are recognized as Classics by the Classic Car Club of America.


==1937–1939==
Chrysler reverted to body on frame construction and there were three models in this generation designated as Imperial. The polarizing appearance was modified with a return to &quot;torpedo&quot; styling, sharing the appearance of a long, straight hood and cowl and moving the headlights outwards into the front fenders with the more successful &quot;Airstream&quot; appearance. The Series C-14 offered the straight eight, shared with the Chrysler Royal C-16 . The Series C-15 was the Imperial Custom and the Town Sedan Limousine, with blind rear quarter panels and was available on request. The top level Imperial Custom Series CW continued to be offered but was very exclusive, using a wheelbase while eliminating the &quot;Airflow&quot; nameplate. Innovations for 1937 included built-in defroster vents, safety-type interior hardware (such as flexible door handles and recessed controls on the dash), seat-back padding, and fully insulated engine mounts. Brakes were 13-inch drums, then in 1939 they expanded to 14 inches, but shrunk to 12-inch drums in 1940. Front suspension was independent. Unusually for ventilation, it had a concealed crank to extend the base of the split windshield outward and the top edge of the engine hood was hinged at the cowl and opened from the grille and up. Access to the engine was accommodated with side hood panels that were released by catches on the inside. An Imperial Custom Series C-15 Convertible Sedan by Derham was used as the AAA Official Car at the 1937 Indy 500 and was painted silver and black to celebrate the racetracks 25th anniversary.

According to 1937 documented records, 11,976 Series C-14 Touring Sedans were produced at a listed price of US$1,100 ($ in dollars ). While the Imperial Custom Series CW was offered in its final year for 1937, documentation does not record that one was built, while three 1937 Series CW were recorded to have been updated with 1936 appearance features and LeBaron bodywork. The first one was built for the Hershey family who had an antique car collection at the time now called the AACA Museum in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The second Series CW was built for The President of the Philippines Manuel L. Quezon, the first president of the Spanish Commonwealth of the Philippines and is maintained by the government. The third car was built for radio personality Major Edward Bowes which later joined a car collection of Frank Kleptz of Terre Haute, Indiana. A &quot;Life&quot; magazine article written in 1940 quoted the value of Major Bowes car at US$25,000 ($ in dollars ). According to records, after the death of Mr. Bowes the car returned to Chrysler in 1941. It was allegedly repainted black from the original Brewster Green and put into wartime service in 1942, used by Admiral Chester Nimitz as a staff car.

For 1938, The Series C-19 was shared with the Imperial and all-new New York Special which became the New Yorker in 1939. While the New York Special was offered as a Business Coupe, of which no records show one was ordered and built, and a four-door Touring Sedan, the Imperial Series C-19 was offered in six body choices and the chassis was available separately for additional coachwork selections. Three convertible choices, to include a two-door roadster with rumble seat and a four-door convertible were listed between US$1,123 ($ in dollars ) and US$1,595 ($ in dollars ). The Imperial Custom offered three factory coachwork choices and five custom choices provided by Derham to include two convertible and two Town Car Limousines. The Imperial Custom Series CW was no longer offered. According to documented records, 8,554 Series C-19 Touring Sedans were produced at a listed price of US$1,198 ($ in dollars ).

For 1939, model names and series numbers were updated. The Series C-23 was shared with the Imperial, the New Yorker and the Saratoga. The straight eight was shared with all three and an aluminum cylinder head was optional on the high compression engine. Visual distinctions could be found in the interior fabrics, the number of chrome pieces in the grille and nameplate badges installed. A Victoria coachwork choice, provided by Hayes Body Company, was offered on the Imperial along with either a two-door Business Coupe or five-passenger Brougham Coupe and a four-door sedan. The top level Series C-24 offered three factory provided sedans, including a limousine, or three convertible body style choices from Derham. The car pictured is J.G. Martin&#x27;s (retired airline mechanic) 1939 Series C-24 7-passenger Limousine Sedan, believed by him and his son Tim to be the only 1939 production 7-passenger limousine still on the road. The listed price was US$2,695 ($ in dollars ). One of three Imperial Custom Convertible Town Car by Derham was specially built for the 1939 royal tour of Canada of British King George VI and Queen Elizabeth when their visit was in the United States. This car was then donated to the Detroit American Legion post.

Following an assassination attempt in 1937, an armoured Chrysler Imperial was purchased as the official car for António de Oliveira Salazar, the Prime Minister of Portugal.


==1940–1948==

In 1940 the Imperial Crown Series C-27 was the only vehicle to wear the &quot;Imperial&quot; nameplate and was offered in four body styles labeled as six-passenger Sedan, an eight-passenger Sedan, the eight-passenger Limousine, and the six-passenger Derham Parade Phaeton. The styling was shared with all Chrysler models for that year and offered front fender parking lights with conventional running boards, and distinguishing a Chrysler model was limited to a nameplate attached on the front fender just below the engine hood, interior upholstery and standard features installed that were optional on other models. The six-passenger sedan offered storage compartments in the front seatbacks and foot rests, while the eight-passenger sedan replaced the storage compartments with accommodation for storing the retractable jump seats and no foot rests. The limousine offered a retractable glass partition between the driver and passenger compartment, installing leather seating for the driver and wool upholstery for the passenger compartment, Lockheed hydraulic brakes, and two-speed electric windshield wipers were standard. The listed price for the limousine was US$2,695 ($ in dollars ).

The 1941 Imperial Crown Series C-33 remained exclusive and special models were available. The Imperial Special Town Sedan used the shorter New Yorker chassis with an Imperial Crown nameplate with a listed price of US$1,675 ($ in dollars ). Laidlaw interior fabrics, Goodyear Double Eagle Tires installed on &quot;Safety Rim&quot; pressed steel wheels, and hydroelectric power windows lifts were some of the items installed. The body work appearance was shared with Chrysler products for 1941 and 1942. The only Series C-33 Imperial Crown chassis, with Derham-supplied body work, was recorded to be used for an Imperial Custom landaulet limousine for Briggs Manufacturing Company President Walter O. Briggs.

The 1942 production year was brief and the New Yorker replaced most of the Imperial product line. The new designation Imperial Crown Series C-37 was the only product to wear the &quot;Imperial&quot; nameplate, while Derham continued to build custom limousines, town cars and four-door convertibles using the Series C-37 designation, listing the limousine at US$3,065 ($ in dollars ). As with all U.S.-built automobiles, production was suspended February 1942 due to World War II production demands, and did not resume until the 1946 model year.

When Chrysler discontinued the Imperial model name, the &quot;Imperial&quot; name was introduced on top-level Cadillac Series 70 limousines, starting in 1941 until 1946 when the Imperial Crown limousine returned. The 1946 Imperial Crown continued the tradition of sharing a common appearance with all Chrysler branded vehicles and could be distinguished by the wheelbase, wool broadcloth upholstery for rear passengers with leather upholstery for the drivers divider window separated front compartment and other standard luxury features. The Series C-40 production records show that only 165 were built at a price of US$3,875 ($ in dollars ) with its competitors listed as the Cadillac Series 75 Fleetwood and the Packard Custom Super Clipper. 1947 saw increased production at 740 despite an increase in price to US$4,305 ($ in dollars ) with no appearance or feature changes and 1948 saw a drop in production to 495 and a price of US$4,767 ($ in dollars ).

==1949–1954==
The Imperial name returned for 1949 as a sedan while the Imperial Crown limousine continued as Chrysler was celebrating their 25th anniversary. The short-wheelbase Imperial was only available as a four-door six-passenger sedan. The 4-door 8-passenger Imperial Crown was available as a sedan, or as a limousine with a retractable division window. 1949 Imperials are very rare as production records show only 50 Imperial sedans and 85 Imperial Crown limousines were built. The retail price for the 1949 Imperial was US$4,664 ($ in dollars ) and US$5,334 ($ in dollars ) for the Imperial Crown limousine.

The new custom-built Imperial sedan was based on the Chrysler New Yorker. It shared the same trim, but had a canvas-covered roof and leather and broadcloth Imperial upholstery. These features were installed by Derham, on the all new postwar Chrysler sheetmetal. Early 1949 Imperial Crowns were leftover 1948s. The really new models didn&#x27;t arrive until March 1949. Their styling was sleeker than previous models, yet conservative. Fewer, but heavier bars were used in the cross-hatched grille. The upper and center horizontal pieces wrapped around the front fenders. Rocker panel moldings, rear fender stone guards, full length lower-window trim, and horizontal chrome strips on the rear fenders, and from the headlights to about halfway across the front doors, were used to decorate the side body.

The 1950 Crosley Hot Shot is often given credit for the first production disc brakes but the Chrysler Imperial Crown had them first as standard equipment at the beginning of the 1949 model year. The Crosley disc was a Goodyear development, a caliper type with ventilated rotor, originally designed for aircraft applications. Only the Hot Shot featured it. Lack of sufficient research caused enormous reliability problems, especially in regions requiring the use of salt on winter roads, such as sticking and corrosion. Drum brake conversion for Hot Shots was quite popular.

The Chrysler 4-wheel disc brake system was more complex and expensive than Crosley&#x27;s, but far more efficient and reliable. It was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Unlike the caliper disc, the Ausco-Lambert utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders.

Chrysler discs were &quot;self-energizing&quot;, in that some of the braking energy itself contributed to the braking effort. This was accomplished by small balls set into oval holes leading to the brake surface. When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface, the balls would be forced up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy. This made for lighter braking pressure than with calipers, avoided brake fade, promoted cooler running, and provided one-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler drums. But because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Imperial Crown through 1954 and the Town and Country Newport in 1950. They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, at a time when an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935. Today&#x27;s owners consider the Ausco-Lambert very reliable and powerful, but admit its grabbiness and sensitivity.

The 1950 Imperial was essentially a New Yorker with a custom interior. It had a Cadillac-style grille treatment that included circular signal lights enclosed in a wraparound ribbed chrome piece. Side trim was similar to last year&#x27;s model, but the front fender strip ended at the front doors and the rear fender molding was at the tire top level and integrated into the stone guard. Unlike the standard Imperial, the Imperial Crown had a side treatment in which the rear fender moldings and stone guard were separate. Body sill moldings were used on all Imperials, but were of a less massive type on the more massive Crown models. A special version of the limousine was available. It featured a unique leather interior and a leather top that blacked out the rear quarter-windows. Power windows were standard on the Imperial Crown .

In an unusual move for the 1950s, the 1951 Imperial had noticeably less chrome than the lower-priced New Yorker that was its base. It also had three horizontal grille bars with the parking lights between the bars and a chrome vertical center piece. Aside from its front fender nameplate, side body trim was limited to the moldings below the windows, rocker panel moldings, bright metal stone shields and a heavy horizontal molding strip running across the fender strips. Three 2-door bodystyles were added to the Imperial model in 1951: a Club coupe, a hardtop, and a convertible. Only 650 convertibles were sold and it would be discontinued the following year, with a listed price of US$4,402 ($ in dollars ). 1951 was also the year that Chrysler introduced its Hemihead V8. &quot;Hydraguide&quot; power steering, an industry first for use in production automobiles, became available on the Imperial for an additional $226 and it was standard on the Imperial Crown.

1952 Imperials were practically identical to the 1951 models, and the most effective way to tell the difference between them is through reference to serial numbers. The convertible bodystyle was dropped in 1952. Unlike the case with Chryslers, the Imperial&#x27;s taillights were not changed. Power steering was standard. The &quot;new&quot; Imperial Crown was also unchanged for 1952. Only 338 of these cars were made in the 1951–1952 model run, and serial numbers indicate that 205 were registered as 1952 automobiles. A minor change was a one-inch () reduction in the front tread measurement.

In 1953 the Imperial model was renamed the Imperial Custom. Although the Imperial Custom resembled the New Yorker, it had a different wheelbase, taillights, and side trim. Clean front fenders and higher rear fender stone shield set it apart from the &quot;ordinary&quot; Chryslers. This was also the first year for the stylized eagle hood ornament. Power brakes, power windows, center folding armrests (front and rear) and a padded dash were standard. Parking lights on all Imperials were positioned between the top and center grille moldings, a variation from the design used on other Chrysler cars. A new model was the six-passenger Imperial Custom limousine which had as standard equipment electric windows, electric division window, floor level courtesy lamps, rear compartment heater, fold-up footrests, seatback mounted clock and special luxury cloth or leather interiors. On 10 March 1953, the exclusive Imperial Custom Newport hardtop was added to the Imperial line at $325 over the price of the eight-passenger sedan ($ in dollars ). The 2-door Club coupe was discontinued. Imperial Custom sedans now rode on a wheelbase longer than the 2-door hardtops. The eagle ornament was about the only thing new on the 1953 Imperial Crown. The nameplate was changed slightly and the limousine featured moldings on top of the rear fenders. Imperial Crowns came with a 12-volt electrical system (Imperial Customs still had a 6-volt system) and Chrysler&#x27;s first fully automatic transmission, called PowerFlite, became available late in the model year, being installed in a limited number of cars for testing and evaluation. Power steering was standard on Imperial Crowns. Also, 1953 was the first year that the Imperial had a one-piece windshield, instead of a two-piece one. A padded dash was standard.

The 1953 Chrysler Imperial was the first production car in twelve years to have automotive air conditioning, following tentative experiments by Packard in 1940 and Cadillac in 1941. Walter P. Chrysler had seen to the invention of Airtemp air conditioning back in the 1930s for the Chrysler Building, and had ostensibly offered it on cars in 1941–42, and again in 1951–52, but none are known to have been sold in the latter form until the 1953 model year. In installing optional Airtemp air conditioning units to its Imperials in 1953, Chrysler beat Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile which added air conditioning as an option in the 1953 model year.

Airtemp was more sophisticated and efficient than the complicated rival air conditioners of 1953. It recirculated, rather than merely cooled, the air inside the vehicle, and it was also the highest capacity unit available on an automobile. It was also simple to operate, with a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions, which the driver selected as desired. The system was capable of cooling a Chrysler from 120 degrees to 85 degrees in about two minutes, and of eliminating humidity, dust, pollen and tobacco smoke at the same time. Since it relied on fresh air, and drew in sixty percent more of it than any contemporary system, Airtemp avoided the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. It was silent and unobtrusive. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the package shelf as on GM and on other cars, small ducts directed cool air toward the ceiling of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.

In 1954 the Imperial Custom had a new grille consisting of a heavy wraparound horizontal center bar with five ridges on top and integrated circular signal lights. Its front fender nameplate was above a chrome strip, which ran the length of the front door to the front of the door opening. The rear fender stone guard was larger than in 1953, but the rocker panel molding and rear fender chrome strip style were still the same. The back-up lights were now located directly below the taillights, rather than dividing the lights as in the previous year&#x27;s model. The Imperial Crown shared basic styling with the Imperial Custom. However it had center-opening rear doors and Cadillac-like rear fender taillights. Air conditioning was standard on the Imperial Crown .

==1955–1983: A separate brand==

=== 1955–1975 ===
Chrysler Corporation advised state licensing bureaus that beginning in 1955, the Imperial was to be registered as a separate make. It was an attempt to compete directly with GM&#x27;s Cadillac and Ford&#x27;s Lincoln luxury-focused marques. Frequently and erroneously referred to as the &quot;Chrysler Imperial&quot;, this period of Imperial production was a separate marque, and had no &quot;Chrysler&quot; badging anywhere on its cars until 1971; starting with the 1974 models, the &quot;Chrysler&quot; badging was again removed from car bodies, with only the &quot;Imperial&quot; nameplate appearing.

In April 1955 Chrysler and Philco announced the development and production of the world&#x27;s first all-transistor car radio. The radio, Mopar model 914HR, was a $150.00 &quot;option&quot;, or equal to $ today on 1956 Imperial automobile models. Philco began manufacturing the all-transistor car radio for Chrysler in the fall of 1955 at its Sandusky, Ohio plant.

With the new &quot;Imperial&quot; make, Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s intention was to create an individual line of luxury cars, above and distinct from Chrysler branded vehicles. This marketing strategy suffered because the cars were rarely (if ever) sold in stand-alone Imperial showrooms. Cadillac and Lincoln did a much better job of separating their luxury marques from the lower priced cars that they sold. Imperial was instead offered at the Chrysler dealer network alongside Chrysler&#x27;s offerings, and the marque was almost universally known as &quot;Chrysler Imperial&quot; in the public&#x27;s mind for this reason, despite the fact that all existing dealerships did indeed carry separate &quot;Imperial&quot; dealership signs distinct from Chrysler.
The Imperial automobiles continued to be retailed through Chrysler dealerships. A distinct marketing channel was not established; thus, the Imperial nameplate failed to separate itself from the other Chrysler models and become a stand-alone marque. Beginning in 1967, the Imperial Division, offering three ranges (Custom, Crown, and LeBaron), retreated from their separate body-on-frame construction and their unique body on a 129.5-inch wheelbase. From that time, Imperials used the Chrysler body. It was fitted with unique styling, and through 1973, very long hoods which accounted for the three-inch-longer (127 vs. 124&quot;) wheelbase as compared to Chrysler sedans. They continued to use their unique front suspension with torsion bars longer than all other Chrysler products and a rubber-isolated subframe crossmember containing the torsion bar anchors, as well as full instrumentation backed up by warning lights. In 1974 and 1975, separate brochures were published and separate Imperial signs still stood above the dealerships, and the Imperial continued to feature unique features (such as hidden headlights as featured since 1969, optional antilock brakes as offered since 1971, and standard four-wheel disc brakes in both 1974 and 1975), the wheelbase was reduced to the same 124&quot; as other big Chryslers.

Although there were no Imperials produced between 1976 and 1978, the styling that was previously used for Imperial was rebranded as the Chrysler New Yorker Brougham during this time. The rear disc brakes and optional antilock feature disappeared, but the exceptionally nice interiors, including rear reading lights with precision-ground lenses which did not shine on the windshield, and four cigarette lighters, continued mostly unchanged.

===1981–1983===

The Imperial name was again resurrected for a model built from 1981 through 1983, as a malaise era two-door coupe based on the second-generation Chrysler Cordoba platform with the designation Series YS. All examples of the 1981–1983 Imperial used Chrysler&#x27;s 318 cubic-inch V8 engine. All US built 1981 Imperials came standard with fuel injection, generating power of and 0-60 mph in 13.4 seconds, with a top speed of . Canadian built 1981 Imperials came with a 2 barrel carburetor. 
==1990–1993==


1990 saw a revival of the Imperial as a high-end sedan in Chrysler&#x27;s lineup to replace the dated Fifth Avenue. Unlike the 1955–1983 Imperial, this car was a model of Chrysler, not its own marque. Based on the Y platform, it represented the top full-size model in Chrysler&#x27;s lineup, above the New Yorker Fifth Avenue.

The reintroduction of the Imperial was two years after the Lincoln Continental was changed to a front-wheel-drive sedan with a V6 engine. Other domestic competitors in this segment included the Cadillac Sedan de Ville/Fleetwood, Oldsmobile 98 and Buick Electra/Park Avenue, all of which shared General Motors&#x27; then-flagship C platform.

Though closely related, efforts were made to distinguish the Imperial from the New Yorker Fifth Avenue: the Imperial&#x27;s nose was more wedge-shaped, while the New Yorker Fifth Avenue&#x27;s initially had a sharper, more angular profile (before gaining a more rounded front and rear); the Imperial&#x27;s rear was more contoured, the New Yorker Fifth Avenue&#x27;s more sharply angled; the Imperial got a full-width taillight treatment (similar to the contemporary Chrysler TC) and reminiscent of the early 1980s Imperial coupe), while the New Yorker Fifth Avenue&#x27;s taillights were small and vertical; and the Imperial&#x27;s seats were more streamlined than the signature button-tufted, pillowed-cushioned seating of the New Yorker Fifth Avenue.

Initially, the 1990 Imperial was powered by the 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6 engine, which was rated at of torque. For 1991, the 3.3 L V6 was replaced by the larger 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6. Although horsepower only increased to , with the new larger 3.8 L V6 torque increased to at 2750 rpm. A four-speed automatic transmission was standard with both engines.

This generation Imperial was a 6-passenger sedan offered either in &quot;Kimberly Velvet&quot; velour or optional &quot;Mark Cross Leather&quot;. Power equipment came standard, as did automatic climate-controlled air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, cruise control, driver&#x27;s side airbag, and its distinct landau vinyl roof. The Imperial featured hidden headlamps behind retractable covers similar to those found on the LeBaron coupe/convertible and New Yorker/Fifth Avenue. The Imperial was available with a choice of several Infinity sound systems, all with a cassette player. Other major options included a fully electronic digital instrument cluster with an information centre, an electronically controlled air suspension system, and remote keyless entry with a security alarm. Dealer-installed integrated Chrysler cellular phones and six-disc CD changers were also available.

All seventh-generation Imperials were covered by Chrysler&#x27;s market-leading &quot;Crystal Key Owner Care Program&quot; which included a 5-year/50,000-mile limited warranty and a 7-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty. A 24-hour toll-free customer service hotline was also provided.

As originally planned, this generation Chrysler Imperial was discontinued after the 1993 model year along with the Y-body and C-body New Yorkers. They were replaced by the new LH platform sedans. While the New Yorker name continued on for three more years, 1993 would be the last year for Imperial. The critically acclaimed cab-forward styled Chrysler LHS replaced the Imperial as Chrysler&#x27;s flagship model for 1994.

===Production figures and prices===
==2006==
===Concept car===
A Chrysler Imperial concept car was presented at the 2006 North American International Auto Show. This concept used the Chrysler LY platform, an extended LX. It featured a wheelbase. Riding on wheels, the car presented &quot;a six-figure image but at a much lower price&quot; according to Tom Tremont, Vice President of advanced vehicle design for Chrysler. The design incorporated a long hood and front end dominated by an upright radiator and a horizontal themed grille. Brushed and polished aluminum pods evoked the free-standing headlamps (a classical throwback favored by 1960s Chrysler chief designers Virgil Exner and Elwood Engel, used commonly in 1930s Chrysler vehicles). Circular LED taillights with floating outer rings harkened to the &quot;gun sight&quot; taillight look of early 1960s Imperials. The roof line was pulled rearward to enlarge the cabin and to create a longer profile.

On 17 July 2007, Chrysler officially announced it would drop the production plans for the Imperial. Citing increasing fuel costs and more stringent fuel economy standards expected from Capitol Hill, Chrysler said that the Imperial project was off, as a viable business case could no longer be made for the car. The Imperial had been rumored to be based on the future Mercedes R-Class or the next generation LX-platform (LY, or a combination of components) and it is suggested that all of the work done on the Imperial program will be rolled into the forthcoming LY-platform cars. These cars will include the next generation Chrysler 300/300C, the long-wheelbase 300/300C (perhaps renamed &quot;New Yorker&quot;) 

similar in size, but not necessarily in style, to the Imperial Concept car of 2006.

<text>Mariann Fischer Boel (; born 15 April 1943) is a Danish politician, serving as European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development from 2004 to 2009. A member of the party Venstre, she had previously been minister of agriculture and foods since 2002, in the government of Anders Fogh Rasmussen.

== In Office ==

=== EU Commissioner for Agriculture (2004-2010) ===
In 2004 Fischer Boel became EU Commissioner for Agriculture. During her tenure, preparations were made to thoroughly reform the Common Market Organization for Sugar or EU sugar quotas system. This consisted of a restructuring of the sector, which would make it competitive enough to stand its ground on a liberalized market.

In 2008, she was given the European Taxpayers&#x27; Award from the Taxpayers&#x27; Association of Europe for her decision to abolish export refunds for exports of live cattle from the EU, and for her ongoing efforts to improve the transparency of agricultural payments.

In 2008, she was presented with the Danish European Movement&#x27;s price for &quot;European of the Year&quot;.

In 2008, she was awarded the Wine Personality of the Year 2008 award by the International Wine Challenge, which said, about her efforts to drag the European wine industry into the 21st century, that &quot;family vineyards might have been pulled up and the family winemaking tradition lost had it not been for the intrepid heroine from the north&quot;.

<text>Royal Air Force Fylingdales (RAF Fylingdales) is a Royal Air Force station on Snod Hill in the North York Moors, England. Its motto is &quot;Vigilamus&quot; (&quot;We are watching&quot;). It is a radar base and is also part of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS). As part of intelligence-sharing arrangements between the United States and United Kingdom (see, for example, the UKUSA Agreement), data collected at RAF Fylingdales are shared between the two countries. Its primary purpose is to give the British and US governments warning of an impending ballistic missile attack (part of the so-called four minute warning during the Cold War). A secondary role is the detection and tracking of orbiting objects; Fylingdales is part of the United States Space Surveillance Network. As well as its early-warning and space-tracking roles, Fylingdales has a third function – the Satellite Warning Service for the UK. It keeps track of spy satellites used by other countries, so that secret activities in the UK can be carried out when they are not overhead. The armed services, defence manufacturers and research organisations, including universities, take advantage of this facility.

==History==

===Cold War===
The station was sited on a former wartime mortar range on Snod Hill, which had to be comprehensively cleared by RAF Bomb Disposal before building could begin. The station was built by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1962, and was maintained by RCA (Great Britain), now Serco Group plc. RAF Fylingdales consisted of three diameter &#x27;golfballs&#x27; or geodesic domes (radomes) containing mechanically steered radar. Operation of the Fylingdales site transferred to RAF Fighter Command on 15 January 1964
although the site became operational on 17 September 1963. It became a local tourist attraction as a result.

Between 1989 and 13 November 1992, Raytheon, the US defence contractor, completed a contract that saw the domes replaced by the current tetrahedron (&#x27;pyramid&#x27;) structure, originally housing the AN/FPS-126 AESA phased array radar system. The site is above sea level and the structure is nine floors high rising from its ground level to high.

The radar system was upgraded in 2007 by Boeing to the Raytheon AN/FPS-132 Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR).

===National Missile Defence===
In the late 1990s, the United States decided to pursue a National Missile Defense plan fully, and RAF Fylingdales attracted further publicity. To improve tracking capabilities (for launches from Africa and the Middle East) the United States wanted the use of Fylingdales as part of its NMD network. After receiving a formal request from the US, the British Government agreed to its use as an NMD tracking facility. The decision was criticised, because the proposed NMD system was solely for US benefit. According to the BBC, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that the British Government secretly agreed to the US request to station NMD missile interceptors at Fylingdales Moor in late 2004. This has subsequently been denied by the Ministry of Defence. The £449 million upgrade for RAF Fylingdales to become an NMD tracking facility was undertaken by Boeing, with Raytheon as the major subcontractor.

==Operation==

===BMEWS===

While the radar station remains a British asset operated and commanded by the Royal Air Force, it also forms one of three stations in the United States BMEWS network (the United States also funds the cost of the radar units). The other two stations in the network are Thule Air Base, Greenland and Clear Space Force Station, Alaska. The data obtained by Fylingdales is shared fully and freely with the United States, where it feeds into the US-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs.

The British Government advised in March 2018, that as of the beginning of that month, fewer than five United States military personnel and ten US contractors worked at the station.

Space Delta 4 of the United States Space Force, maintains a liaison officer at Fylingdales to act as link to US missile warning operations and advises the RAF station commander on operational issues.

The secondary role of detection and tracking of orbiting objects, also called Space Situational Awareness (SSA), as part of the United States Space Surveillance Network is carried out in conjunction with RAF High Wycombe.

===Systems===
The primary radars of RAF Fylingdales are active electronically scanned array (AESA) phased array radars, mounted on each face of a truncated tetrahedron, typically referred to as the &quot;pyramid&quot; or the SSPAR (Solid State Phased Array Radar). This makes Fylingdales unique amongst its peers in that it covers a full 360 degrees. Each of the three arrays is 84 feet (26 m) across and contains around 2560 transmit/receive modules; mean power output is about , with a tracking range of .

===Protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament===
The functions of RAF Fylingdales have been subject to criticism from opposition groups, such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), leading to protests being held on occasion. These stem from concerns regarding the base&#x27;s association with nuclear warfare and the militarisation of space. They argue against the UK assisting the US National Missile Defense (NMD) programme with RAF Fylingdales&#x27; ability to detect attacks, saying it is destabilising US and European relations with Russia, makes the UK the front line in any future conflict and it could be information from Fylingdales that initiates a nuclear response from the US and/or the UK to a perceived threat – real or false; intended or accidental.

===Concerns over radiation levels===
The radar beam has created serious concern of radiation risks due to leakage from the sides of the beam&#x27;s &quot;side lobes&quot;. Although the radiation levels are within UK limits (NRPB), it would be harder for the base to keep within the tighter European Union limits (INIRPB), which the UK may soon adopt, though Britain&#x27;s exit from the EU makes this less likely.

===2019 bomb hoax===
On 26 August 2019, Laura Woodwardsmith telephoned North Yorkshire Police and made a bomb threat in relation to RAF Fylingdales. Although, the Ministry of Defence Police locked down the base as a precaution, it was later revealed that Woodwardsmith was both drunk and having a mental breakdown when making the threat.

===Guarding and security===
The &quot;Northern Echo&quot; states that Fylingdales is guarded by 80 military policemen, however RAF Fylingdales is guarded by the Ministry of Defence Guard Service (approx 19 officers) and Ministry of Defence Police (approx 60–100 officers) neither of which operate under a military capacity. The station has a checkpoint by the A169 roadside and further checkpoints at each of its fences. The outer fence is an 8000 volt electrified fence and all entrance gates can be locked and razor wire placed in the opening on metal truss frames.

<text>Pratinas () was one of the early tragic poets who flourished at Athens at the beginning of the fifth century BCE, and whose combined efforts were thought by critics to have brought the art to its perfection.

==Life==
He was a native of Phlius in Peloponnese, and was therefore by birth a Dorian. His father&#x27;s name was Pyrrhonides or Encomius. It is not known at what time he went to Athens, but we find him exhibiting there, in competition with Choerilus and Aeschylus, around the 70th Olympiad, that is, 500–499 BCE, the year of Aeschylus&#x27;s debut.

==Works==
The main innovation that ancient critics ascribed to Pratinas was the separation of the satyric from the tragic drama. Pratinas is frequently credited as having introduced satyr plays as a species of entertainment distinct from tragedy, in which the rustic merry-makings and the extravagant dances of the satyrs were retained. The change preserved a highly characteristic feature of the older form of tragedy, the entire rejection of which would have met with serious obstacles, not only from the popular taste, but from religious associations, and yet preserved it in such a manner as, while developing its own capabilities, to set free the tragic drama from certain of its genre constraints.

A band of Satyrs, as the companions of Dionysus, formed the original chorus of tragedy; and their jests and frolics were interspersed with the more serious action of the drama, without causing any more sense of incongruity than is felt in the reading of those humorous passages of Homer, from which Aristotle traces the origin of the satyric drama and of comedy. As however tragedy came to be separated more and more from any reference to Dionysus, and the whole of the heroic mythology was included in its range of subjects, the chorus of Satyrs came to be seen as impracticable and absurd, and at the same time the humorous element, which formed an essential part of the character of the chorus of Satyrs, became more and more incongruous with the earnest spirit of the higher tragic dramas.

It is easy to enter into the fun of the Prometheus the Fire-kindler, where an old Satyr singes his beard in attempting to embrace the beautiful fire; but it is hard to fancy what the poet could have done with a chorus of Satyrs, in place of the ocean nymphs, in the &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;. The innovation of Pratinas at once relieved tragedy of this problem, and gave the Satyrs a free stage for themselves; where, by treating the same class of subjects on which the tragedies were founded, in a totally different spirit, the poet not only preserved a popular feature of his art (the old chorus), but also presented stories that audiences found, for lack of a better word, fun.

It has been suggested by some writers that Pratinas cultivated the satyric drama out of fear of being eclipsed by Aeschylus in tragedy. Others disagree and observe that the early life of Pratinas would very probably imbue him with a taste for that kind of the drama; for his native city, Phlius, was the neighbor of Sicyon, the home of those &quot;tragic choruses&quot;, on the strength of which the Dorians claimed to be the inventors of tragedy. It was adjacent also to Corinth, where the cyclic choruses of Satyrs, which were ascribed to Arion, had been long established.

==Reputation==
This innovation of Pratinas was adopted by his contemporaries; but Pratinas is distinguished by the large proportion of his satyric dramas. He composed, according to the &quot;Suda&quot;, fifty plays, of which thirty-two were Satyr plays. Böckh, however, from an alternate reading of the &quot;Suda&quot;, assigns to Pratinas only twelve satyric dramas, thus leaving a sufficient number of tragedies to make three for every satyric drama, that is, twelve tetralogies and two single plays. In merit, the satyric dramas of Pratinas were considered the best ever written by his contemporaries, except only those of Aeschylus.

Pratinas ranked high among the lyric, as well as the dramatic poets of his age. He also wrote dithyrambs and the choral odes called hyporchemata, and a considerable fragment of one of these is preserved in Athenaeus. Hyporcheme was closely related to the satyric drama by the humorous character which it often assumed, and dithyrambs by its ancient choruses of Satyrs. Pratinas may perhaps be considered to have shared with his contemporary Lasus of Hermione the honor of founding the Athenian school of dithyrambic poetry. Some interesting fragments of his hyporchemes are preserved, especially a considerable passage in Athenaeus which gives an important indication of the contest for supremacy which was then going on both between poetry and music, and between the different kinds of music. The poet complains that the voices of the singers were overpowered by the noise of the flutes, and expresses his desire to replace the prevailing Phrygian scales then commonly used with the Dorian. It is impossible to say how much of his lyric poetry was separate from his dramas; in which, both from the age at which he lived, and from express testimony, we know that great importance was assigned not only to the songs, but also to the dances of the chorus. Athenaeus mentions him as one of the poets who were called &quot;orchestikoi&quot; (ὀρχηστικοί), from the large part which the choral dances bore in their dramas.

==Family==
His son Aristias was also highly distinguished for his satyric plays, and a monument was erected by the inhabitants of Phlius in honor of him.

<doc id="895145" wikidata="Q5276242" url="?curid=895145" title="Digitiser">
<text>Digitiser was a video games magazine that was broadcast on Teletext in the UK between 1993 and 2003. It originally billed itself as &quot;The World&#x27;s Only Daily Game Magazine&quot;.

The page was launched on 1 January 1993 on page 370 of the Teletext service on ITV before transferring over to Channel 4 later that year. It was updated daily except on Sundays, apart from a nine-month period in 2002 when it went to three days a week, weekends and holidays. 

It was followed by up to 1.5 million viewers at its peak popularity. The magazine was notable for its surreal and risqué humour as well as its games coverage. Digitiser was advertised on the back of multiple issues of the multi-platform video game magazine Electric Brain.

&quot;Digitiser&quot; was created by writers Paul Rose and Tim Moore who went by the pseudonyms Mr Biffo and Mr Hairs. They wrote it together for the first four years while Rose wrote more or less solo for the remaining six in a freelance capacity.

==History==
&quot;Digitiser&quot; frequently courted controversy, inspiring criticism both from outside groups and Teletext&#x27;s own editorial team, who viewed the writers as troublemakers but were unable to axe them due to the magazine&#x27;s popularity. Pages were often altered without the writers&#x27; knowledge, with sub-editors sometimes deleting entire frames of reviews for fear of missing a risqué joke.

On one occasion, a sub-editor, who shortly afterwards was promoted to editorial director of the company, rang Rose to insist he remove a &quot;disgusting&quot; reference to &quot;fingering the index&quot;. When Rose pointed out that it was a play on &quot;index finger&quot;, and that it had not even dawned on him that it might be considered rude, the up-and-coming sub-editor allegedly went silent for a few seconds, before insisting that it was still deliberately provocative, and should be deleted. A similar confrontation occurred over a reference to &quot;The three Rs&quot;, during which sub-editors believed that - despite Biffo&#x27;s amused protests to the contrary - the &quot;Rs&quot; part of the phrase was meant to sound a bit like &quot;arse&quot;, rather than a reference to the famous educational principle.

Campaigns were even waged to have &quot;Digitiser&quot;&#x27;s writing team fired - both within Teletext by its editorial minions, and beyond (by disgruntled Amiga, Sega, Sony, or Nintendo fans, not to mention the staff of Mean Machines and Official Nintendo magazines - whom &quot;Digitiser&quot; frequently poked fun at). Such reactions merely served to redouble Biffo&#x27;s resolve to be controversial and edgy, and as he often wrote on the letters pages, &quot;Digitiser&quot; &quot;&quot;hates everyone equally, man&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Digitiser&quot; became remarkably popular, despite (or in part due to) the sometimes risqué content, because of the novel reviews, format, and sometimes bizarre tone. Biffo&#x27;s battles with his employers helped to give &quot;Digitiser&quot; a defiant, anti-establishment air.

Things finally came to a head in 2002, when Teletext gained a new senior editorial team, who lost patience with Biffo&#x27;s pushing of the envelope of what was acceptable on a mainstream text service. Even though they could not quite bring themselves to get rid of &quot;Digitiser&quot; and Biffo altogether, they ordered that the magazine be reduced to three days a week, and have all humour and character stripped from the pages. Despite massive evidence to the contrary, and being one of the most popular features sections on Teletext, Biffo has said since that he was told the reason for this was because the humour &quot;excluded people&quot;. Another reason for the reduction to three days a week, and the removal of the Panel 4 feature at weekends, was the negative financial effects felt after the September 11 attacks on Teletext Ltd.&#x27;s core business of advertising air travel holidays.

Despite facing pressure from the new senior editorial team, Biffo continued to write the pages anonymously, but reduced his work to 45 minutes a day. The decision later backfired on Teletext, when &quot;Digitiser&quot;&#x27;s viewing figures plummeted to 400,000 per day from its peak of 1.5 million, and viewers spent the next nine months inundating the company with letters of complaint, demanding that Digitiser&#x27;s humour and characters be restored. After thousands of emails and letters had poured into Teletext they were forced to go back on their previous decision, and asked Biffo to reinstate the humour, and return &quot;Digitiser&quot; to its daily glory. However, for Biffo the damage had been done, and his last shreds of faith in the company had been shattered. After Biffo handed in his notice in December 2002, he returned &quot;Digitiser&quot; to its earlier style for one final, four-month run as a thank you to the fans - which included a special ten-year anniversary celebration, complete with a glowing eulogy by author Alex Garland. The lights finally went out on just over ten years of &quot;Digitiser&quot; on 9 March 2003.

&quot;Digitiser&quot; was replaced by &quot;GameCentral&quot;, which featured the same number of sub-pages, but none of the humour with then editor Tony Mott explaining &quot;We&#x27;re not Digitiser so get over it&quot; to readers on the first edition.

==The writers==
The founding writers of &quot;Digitiser&quot; were Mr Biffo (Paul Rose) and Mr Hairs (Tim Moore) who, as Biffo himself says, only began working on it in order to &quot;amuse ourselves and get free games&quot;. Hairs was fired by Teletext in May 1996, and Biffo continued to write the bulk of the magazine solo, apart for occasional, part-time contributors, who helped him out with the letters, tips, and charts pages.

These temporary assistants went by the names Mr Cheese, Mr Udders and Mr Toast. &quot;Digitiser&quot; also ran a weekly opinion column, written by various guest writers, usually prominent members of the games journalist community (such as Violet Berlin and Stuart Campbell).

==Recent news==
In their 10 December 2006 episode, &quot;videoGaiden&quot; inducted &quot;Digitiser&quot; into their videoGaiden Time Capsule with the aid of Colin Baker in his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; outfit, and the song &quot;Lavender&quot; by Rose&#x27;s favourite band, Marillion.

==Regular characters==
Regular characters appeared on the service both to fill up space left by short reviews and letters, and also to flesh out the content provided by the writers.

The Man With a Long Chin (later renamed The Man) - The Man kept a regular diary in which he would detail the job he had been doing that week, before (usually) getting fired at the end of the week. One of The Man&#x27;s jobs saw him working in a burger bar. He was eventually fired when he replaced the toilet paper with gloves from the lost property box, and someone froze to death in the toilet.

The Man&#x27;s Daddy (later renamed Daddy) - a bizarre ant/elephant creature who declared himself to be a famous comedian. His jokes tended to be disjointed, usually relying on a nonsense answer or a far-fetched pun. His jokes included: Question. Why did Superman wear his pants outside his trousers? Answer. Because he was a pervert.&quot;, Question.: What do you call a dog wearing a policeman&#x27;s hat? Answer: PC Dog-hat&quot; and &quot;Question.: What do you say if there is a seed in your pie and a man in your yard? Answer: &quot;Seed pie leave now&quot;. &quot;

Mr. T - A take on Mr. T from The A-Team, who would dispense worldly advice, while warning kids to stay away from his bins. His distinctive vocal style was brought across by the use of capitalisation of entire words in a sentence.

Phoning Honey - Would phone up stores in order to make prank calls, and present the transcript for readers&#x27; perusal.

Fat Sow - Presented the news page, and began every article with a wild insult, and a demand that the reader stop whatever they are doing to pay attention to the rant. Rose allegedly received a written warning when Teletext&#x27;s editors deemed Fat Sow&#x27;s comment &quot;What&#x27;s the matter lads - too fat and stupid to get into the army?&quot; as &quot;Grossly offensive towards security guards&quot;.

Zombie Dave - A reanimated corpse who appeared on the news page and punctuated the items with comments written in the manner of the shambling dead. This was frequently used as an excuse to get rude comments screened on the family-friendly service, such as when he described Tomb Raider&#x27;s Lara Croft as a &quot;thrr brrrd wrrz thrr tttrrrdz&quot; kind of sound.

Insincere Dave - A send-up of fanboys, marketing staff and ultra-positive reviewers; in particular the over enthusiastic Dave Gibbons who at that time was the games reviewer for the BBC Ceefax service. Dave would comment briefly on the news items of the day in an overly optimistic and enthusiastic fashion. Famously, any spare space on the line his comments occupied would be filled with exclamation marks, further emphasising his &quot;sincerity.&quot; Example: on a story about a pink casing accessory for the Dreamcast, Dave commented that, &quot;Now your DC can be in the pink!!!!!!!&quot;. Very occasionally, a more deadpan Dave would appear: on a story regarding Microsoft&#x27;s intention to ensure that the Xbox marketing budget outweighed Sony&#x27;s PS2 expenditure, Dave remarked that, &quot;Money is the most important thing.&quot; Dave&#x27;s comments were usually preceded by a rather acid take on the day&#x27;s gaming events, adding a further element of juxtaposition to Dave&#x27;s enthusiasm.

The Snakes - A pair of beatboxing snakes, which would argue in a manner similar to that of Ali G (but pre-dating him by some years). Led to the catchphrase &quot;I Cuss You Bad&quot;, along with the use of the word &quot;Skank&quot;.

BW - A faceless quizmaster, who was a bizarre parody of Bamber Boozler, quizmaster of Teletext quiz Bamboozle, often appearing to be nude.

Gossi the Dog - Perhaps &quot;Digitiser&quot;″s most controversial character, Gossi hosted a regular gaming gossip page. On one occasion, the Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld a complaint about the Gossi page, which alluded to Gossi&#x27;s master thrashing the talking cartoon dog with a belt. Gossi&#x27;s page also led to the dismissal of Tim Moore, who - while Rose was away on paternity leave - printed an unsubstantiated rumour about a fellow games journalist Dave Perry. Teletext&#x27;s editors allegedly used the absence of Rose (who remained useful to the company for his graphic design abilities), and the journalist&#x27;s complaint, as an excuse to fire Moore.

Doctor Derek Doctors - A sinister megalomaniac, whom Biffo and Hairs secretly removed from air, after a concerned mother rang to say she found him &quot;Perverted and disgusting&quot;.

Chester Fisho - Chester gave views on the news of the day laced with masses of sexual innuendo.

==Mock advertisements==
During Teletext&#x27;s 16-year run, many of its subpages would have adverts inserted on the last page. &quot;Digitiser&quot; decided to create their own spoof adverts as a result. One of the most notable was for a fictional German music compilation called &quot;Rock Meister!&quot;, which included stereotypical German words as in &quot;Rock dir night mit ROCK MEISTER!!&quot;, instead of the official &quot;Rock der nacht!&quot; as the advertisement was poking fun of stereotypes made at the German language, alongside stating the compilation is &quot;Musik fur dir LONGHAIRS!&quot;. Artists on the compilation were listed as Roxette (although they came from Sweden) and The Scorpions, while &quot;NOT A REAL GERMAN ADVERT&quot; was placed at the top left of the screen instead of the usual &quot;NOT AN ADVERT&quot;. This was done as a viewer contacted Teletext over a previous spoof believing it to be real.

==Reveal button==
The reveal button was a feature that was made heavy use of on &quot;Digitiser&quot;. Pressing this key on your television remote made some previously hidden text appear, sometimes with a blinking effect. Typical jokes would tell you to press reveal to see what a certain character thought of your letter, or a news item, and you would be presented with a surreal non-sequitur, such as a man shouting &quot;Swayze!&quot; The weekend edition would often feature a full-length &quot;story,&quot; told through &quot;Reveal-O&quot;s (as they were often called - see &quot;Digi-Speak&quot;) on every page.

The most controversial &quot;Reveal-O&quot; appeared right at the end of &quot;Digitiser&quot;&#x27;s life, on the final page of the final letters section. It purported to be a picture of &quot;the real Turner The Worm (a cartoon character from Teletext also created by Rose) being sick&quot;. Pressing the reveal button then uncovered an image that many have likened to a recently ejaculated penis.

The end-of-year quiz featured lizard like creatures pointing to the correct answer with its tongue when the button was pressed.

==Digi-Speak==
A further element of &quot;Digitiser&quot;&#x27;s other-worldly charm was its unusual take on the English language. Often this amounted to little more than using &quot;the&quot; in unusual places or adding curious suffixes to existing words (including, but not limited to -uss, -O, -ston, -Oh! and -me-do), but occasionally invented whole new sounds using words that never been used in that context, such as &quot;&quot; becoming an exclamation of joy.

Using tramps as similes (&quot;That&#x27;s like putting lipstick on a dead tramp and calling it a supermodel&quot;), the phrase &quot;moc-moc-a-moc&quot; and irrelevant sentences which read merely &quot;And!&quot; were all elements of the &quot;Digitiser&quot; lexicon.

It was common practice for &quot;Digitiser&quot; to mock the names of contributors to its letters page. Generally, the more obvious the better (for example a reader with the surname &quot;Major&quot; could well find themselves being referred to as &quot;John&quot;). Notable bits of name-calling included &quot;Digitiser&quot; viewer Matt Gander being rechristened &quot;non-shiny goose&quot;, and a Mr. Tedesco being called &quot;Safedeway&quot;, alluding to supermarket chains Tesco and Safeway.

==Bubblegun.com==
Bubblegun.com is a website that was established by Paul Rose, and featured contributions from several other writers. Touting itself as a Pop Culture version of &quot;Digitiser&quot;, this site gained popularity around the last few years of &quot;Digitiser&quot;, being named by Select magazine as one of the UK&#x27;s top 10 &quot;maverick websites&quot;. Though Paul Rose has not written for the site in over a decade, it remains as an archive run by its former designer, Steve Horsley. Though remaining unaffiliated with Rose - who has distanced himself from it - Bubblegun has featured new material from all-new contributors.

==Digitiser 2000==
In late 2014, Digitiser received an online revival of sorts with the launch of Digitiser2000.com, a website featuring a mixture of games news and reviews, articles and humour, in the traditional Digitiser offbeat style, and featuring many of the characters and features previously seen in the Teletext era of Digi. The content for the new site is largely written by Paul &quot;Mr Biffo&quot; Rose and was essentially self-funded at launch; Rose has since enabled a crowdfunding page through Patreon to enable readers to contribute towards the site&#x27;s running costs (though the site&#x27;s core content will remain freely available for all to view).

==Mr Biffo&#x27;s Found Footage==
In 2017, Paul Rose successfully funded a Kickstarter campaign to bring together &quot;Mr Biffo&#x27;s Found Footage&quot;, a comedy/sci-fi montage series in the found footage style. The full series was released for free on YouTube weekly each Sunday, beginning on 10 September 2017 and ending on 22 October 2017.

==Digitiser the Show==
In 2018, a second Kickstarter campaign by Paul Rose was funded - over 1000 backers raised more than £44000 to create Digitiser the Show, a weekly six-part YouTube show featuring regular co-hosts Mr Biffo, Larry Bundy Jr, Octavius Kitten, Gameplay Jenny and Paul Gannon, and special guests from across the gaming community. Episodes also included appearances by various Teletext Digitiser characters in acted or puppet form, and the original Mr Hairs.

A third Kickstarter campaign by Rose for a second series, titled &quot;Digitiser the Show: Level 2&quot;, was also successful, with 980 backers pledging over £74000. The series will be hosted by Mr Biffo and Gannon, with appearances from Octavius and Bundy alongside other guests.

<doc id="895166" wikidata="Q898598" url="?curid=895166" title="Evermore (band)">
<text>Evermore were a rock band formed in Feilding, New Zealand, in 1999, made up of three brothers Jon (guitar, vocals), Peter (keyboards, bass guitar, vocals) and Dann Hume (drums, guitar, vocals). The band was based in Sydney from 2004 to 2007 and then Melbourne until they became inactive in 2014. Evermore released four studio albums: &quot;Dreams&quot; (2004), &quot;Real Life&quot; (2006), &quot;Truth of the World: Welcome to the Show&quot; (2009), and &quot;Follow the Sun&quot; (2012), as well as a self-titled compilation album (2010). &quot;Real Life&quot; and &quot;Truth of the World&quot; were their highest charting studio albums in New Zealand and Australia, while &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;Real Life&quot; received platinum certifications from Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).

Evermore&#x27;s most successful singles were &quot;Running&quot;, &quot;Light Surrounding You&quot; (both 2006) and &quot;Hey Boys and Girls (Truth of the World pt.2)&quot; (2009) – &quot;Light Surrounding You&quot; peaked at number one in Australia. They were nominated for seven ARIA Music Awards and won two New Zealand Music Awards. The group&#x27;s members won an APRA Silver Scroll song writing award and the Channel V Oz Artist of the Year Award. Evermore have not performed publicly since late 2014 and each of the members has undertaken a solo career.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Evermore were formed in Feilding, Manawatu, New Zealand in 1999 as Electro by three brothers Jon Cobbe Hume (born Jonathan Daniel Cobbe, Lismore, Australia) on guitar and vocals, Peter Elisha Hume (born Peter Elisha Cobbe, 1985, Whangaparāoa) on keyboards and bass guitar, and Dann Hume (born Daniel Benjamin Cobbe, 1987, Feilding) on drums, guitar and vocals. One of their ancestors John Cobbe (1859–1944) owned a general store in Feilding, became a New Zealand Member of Parliament for Oroua and later a sheep farmer. The brothers were introduced to music at a young age by their parents&#x27; record collection.

From 1994 all three brothers were partly home schooled in Feilding by their mother and were given piano lessons but taught themselves to play their other instruments. They were inspired by the Who, Led Zeppelin and Crowded House to pursue a music career. Electro entered the Rockquest competition for school groups in 1999. They changed their name to &quot;Evermore&quot;, which references Led Zeppelin&#x27;s song &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; (1971). Jon has said the trio&#x27;s parents were supportive: &quot;they always wanted us to do something creative... Nothing was too risky.&quot;

=== Rise to fame (2000–2003) ===

In 2000 as Evermore with Richard Higham on bass guitar, the four-piece group won Rockquest. They used the prize money to help fund their home studio, Red Sky Studio. Dann observed, &quot;It started as a little room and then we needed to fit the drum kit in so we had to bust down another wall... Our parents put up with a lot but they&#x27;re very tolerant.&quot; This line-up issued an independent four-track extended play, &quot;On the Way&quot; in 2000. The title track and &quot;Into the Ocean&quot; were co-written by Jon with Martyn Hume Cobbe. After a year Higham left the band to become a farmer. Evermore had other short-term members during their early years.

At the 2002 NZ Music Awards (later known as the Aotearoa Music Awards), Evermore members met talent manager New Zealand-born Australian-based Rebekah Campbell, who then travelled to Feilding to hear their demos. Campbell, as their manager, conferred with her mentor John Woodruff who signed the group to his publishing company, Rough Cut. Woodruff travelled to Auckland to promote Evermore at the launch of the 2003 Louis Vuitton Cup in October 2002, fellow attendees included Woodruff&#x27;s Canadian business partner Donald K. Tarlton. Evermore signed with Tarlton&#x27;s record label, Aquarius Records, for Canadian releases. The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Slipping Away&quot;, was released independently on 1 December 2002, with only 300 copies pressed. However, it received regular airplay on Australian national youth radio Triple J.

Evermore toured supporting American band Brad in early January 2003. While on that tour they met Barrett Jones (of Visqueen), who offered to produce their material. The New Zealand trio&#x27;s five-track EP, &quot;Oil &amp; Water&quot;, independently released on 13 January 2003, resulted in the band&#x27;s first Australian concert tour – funded by Triple J. The EP reached No. 15 on the ARIA Heavy Rock &amp; Metal singles chart and sold in excess of 5000 copies in Australia. Dann reflected, &quot;[that&#x27;s] the size of Feilding&quot;. Later in January 2003 they performed at the Big Day Out in Auckland. In the following month the Hume brothers established Fuze Music Limited with Martyn Cobbe.

The group performed at SXSW in March 2003, Rodel Delfin of &quot;Hits Daily Double&quot;, listed them as one of 50 acts to see. Then they travelled to Toronto to play four shows. In August of that year the trio appeared on the cover of &quot;New Zealand Musician&quot;, following success in &quot;Project NZM&quot; – a promotion by radio station ZM to gain awareness for up-and-coming bands. &quot;My Own Way EP&quot;, the band&#x27;s five-track next EP, was released on 15 September 2003 via East West and Warner, which reached No. 11 on the ARIA Hitseekers Singles chart.

=== &quot;Dreams&quot; (2004–2006) ===

&quot;Dreams&quot;, Evermore&#x27;s debut studio album, was released on 27 September 2004 in Australia via East West and Warner. It peaked at No. 15 on the ARIA albums chart and No. 30 on the RIANZ albums chart. Three singles were issued from the album; &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; (August), &quot;For One Day&quot; (February 2005), and &quot;Come to Nothing&quot; (May); with &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; reaching the top 20 in Australia. It included a re-recorded version of &quot;Into the Ocean&quot;. For the album the trio worked with Jones (Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Whiskeytown) and John Alagía co-producing with Jon. Initially they wanted to use their home studio, however Red Sky Studio and parts of Feilding were flooded in February 2004, so they travelled to Jones&#x27; Seattle-based studio.

After recording &quot;Dream&quot; the trio relocated to Sydney in mid-2004. All three singles were used in New Zealand and Australian promotion of American TV show &quot;The O.C.&quot;, with &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; ultimately appearing on the show. A remixed version of &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; with Dirty South, titled &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late (Ride on)&quot;, was also released, and was used on various artists&#x27; compilation albums. &quot;Dreams&quot; differed from Evermore&#x27;s earlier &quot;retro-sounding, riff-based pop-rock&quot; works, and instead contained a more &quot;spacious&quot; sound according to Jon. He said he drew inspiration and was influenced by Silverchair and Muse, as well as Pink Floyd. Jon also noted that the band initially wanted to create a concept album, but stated that &quot;we sort of had to tone it back a bit, because we wanted to make a double album&quot;.

&quot;Soundgenerator.com&quot;″s reviewer Eleanor Goodman described &quot;Dreams&quot; as &quot;clear rather than grungy, soulful rather than angsty&quot;. Greg Prato of AllMusic rated it at two-and-a-half out-of-five stars, felt it was too derivative and explained, &quot;[the trio are] yet to find their own sound and approach, as evidenced by many tracks that sound like&quot; Muse&#x27;s &quot;Absolution&quot; (September 2003) or Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;The Bends&quot; (March 1995).

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2005, held in October, Evermore received five nominations and performed at the ceremony. &quot;Into the Ocean (The Story So Far 1997–2005)&quot; was the trio&#x27;s video album, which was issued on DVD in the following month. The title track is a 45-minute documentary on the history of the group, followed by a 70-minute live performance recorded at The Metro Theatre, Sydney and a selection of their music videos. The band released &quot;The Lakeside Sessions Vol. 1&quot;, an iTunes-exclusive live acoustic EP on 20 December 2005.

=== &quot;Real Life&quot; (2006–2008) ===

Evermore&#x27;s second album, &quot;Real Life&quot;, was released on 8 July 2006 by Warner. It peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA albums chart and No. 2 on the RIANZ albums chart, spending over half a year in both. It was certified 2× platinum for shipment of 140,000 copies in Australia in July 2007. Four singles were issued from the album; &quot;Running&quot; (June 2006), &quot;Light Surrounding You&quot; (October), &quot;Unbreakable&quot; (March 2007), and &quot;Never Let You Go&quot; . Of these, &quot;Light Surrounding You&quot; charted highest and is Evermore&#x27;s only number-one single.

&quot;Real Life&quot; was initially recorded on the Central Coast, New South Wales, where the band spent three months. Production moved to Easton, Maryland for an additional three months, and continued recording with producer Alagía. Following recording and production, it was mixed by Tom Lord-Alge (blink-182).

Despite its favourable charting the album was negatively received by music critics. Michael Dwyer of &quot;The Age&quot; was unimpressed with &quot;Real Life&quot;, &quot;a roller-coaster of intense gestures and hollow sentiments spiralling on an updraft of crashing cymbals and synthetic harmonies&quot; which provides &quot;sheer, overwrought drama... [that] aims for U2 but ends up Big Country.&quot; Sputnikmusic&#x27;s DaveyBoy rated it at 2.0 and declared, &quot;Three hit singles and pretty much nothing else on this lazy, uninspired &amp; disappointing follow-up.&quot; Bernard Zuel of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; found it lacked ambition and &quot;you suspect this is exactly what it was meant to sound like&quot;. He complained about its lack of excitement compared with &quot;Dreams&quot;, by displaying &quot;a palpable contrivance that instead of bringing craft to their undoubted talent brings a stifling limitation.&quot; The album&#x27;s release was followed by a tour of New Zealand and Australia in September and October 2005 with support acts Bob Evans and the Vagrant City Scandal.

The trio opened for a reformed Split Enz on their tour of Australian state capitals in June 2006 starting at Brisbane Entertainment Centre (BEC) and included Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne and ended at Burswood Dome, Perth. Jack Langridge and Brett Collingwood of &quot;Rave Magazine&quot; caught their performance at BEC, &quot;[their] affinity with Coldplay&#x27;s stadium-friendly, atmospheric rock is instantly recognisable in this cavernous setting...&quot; and found Dann&#x27;s drumming to be a &quot;major highlight&quot;. On 17 November 2006 Evermore performed at a charity concert: the Make Poverty History Concert, in Melbourne, covering Ben E. King&#x27;s &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. Early in 2007, the band played at the Big Day Out, as well as at the 21st Australian Scout Jamboree and on 29 April they appeared at the 2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards to perform &quot;Light Surrounding You&quot;. In mid-2007 the group relocated from Sydney to Melbourne.

=== &quot;Truth of the World: Welcome to the Show&quot; (2008–2009) ===

The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Truth of the World: Welcome to the Show&quot;, was released on 20 March 2009, and debuted at No. 14 in Australia and No. 5 in New Zealand. Its lead single, &quot;Between the Lines&quot;, was issued as a free download from the band&#x27;s website on 10 November 2008. The second single, &quot;Hey Boys and Girls (Truth of the World pt.2)&quot;, appeared on 3 February 2009, which peaked at No. 5 on the New Zealand charts and No. 4 on the Australian charts. Their single &quot;Can You Hear Me?&quot; was released to radio on 11 May, but did not reach the top 100 in New Zealand or Australia.

&quot;Truth of the World&quot; is a concept album about trash media, political propaganda, advertising and infotainment. It was recorded at the band&#x27;s own Dragonfly Studio, Melbourne over a period of 18 months from July 2007 to January 2009. The studio had been built via the proceeds of their previous work. Otago Daily Times&#x27; Shane Gilchrist observed, they &quot;mixed classic rock histrionics (perhaps minus the guitar solos) with the pulsating textures of modern electronica.&quot; Matt Gallant of &quot;theDwarf.com.au&quot; was unimpressed with the work, &quot;[it] attempts to tell a dark and sinister story, rather than deliver a collection of engaging tracks... [they] attempt more than they can achieve&quot;.

In July and August 2009 Evermore supported Pink during the Funhouse Tour on the second half of the Australian leg. After the group&#x27;s Australian tours in support of &quot;Truth of the World: Welcome to the Show&quot; and supporting Pink, the singer invited them as main support act for her subsequent European tour, from October to December. The band released their self-titled compilation album in October 2009 in Australia and New Zealand, which provided the single &quot;Underground&quot; (October).

=== &quot;Follow the Sun&quot; (2010–2014) ===

Upon return to Australia in early 2010, Evermore took time off from touring, to start writing and recording their next studio album. Jon Hume built a new recording studio, The Stables Recording Studio, in 2011 in Macedon Ranges, Victoria. Early that year they took a portable recording studio on a round-the-world song writing trip.

On 12 October 2012 they issued their fourth studio album &quot;Follow the Sun&quot;, which reached No. 22 in New Zealand and No. 40 in Australia. Its lead single and title track &quot;Follow the Sun&quot;, was used by HBO United States in promotion for the station&#x27;s 2013 season and also appeared in the worldwide trailer for DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s &quot;The Croods&quot;. Two Australia headline tours followed in 2012 and 2013, as well as support for Maroon 5&#x27;s Australian leg of their worldwide Overexposed Tour and Matchbox Twenty&#x27;s Australian North Tour with INXS.

In 2012 Dann stopped touring with Evermore to pursue his own singing and production career. He supported the Lisa Mitchell tour in 2012 as Danco. Meanwhile Evermore, without Dann, toured Australia from April to June 2013 to promote the album and its second single, &quot;Hero&quot; (January 2013). The group&#x27;s last single, &quot;One Love&quot;, appeared in August 2013 as a charity single supporting that year&#x27;s Global Citizen Festival. In October 2014 Evermore performed as a duo of Jon and Peter Hume at the Precinct Hotel, Melbourne.

== Afterwards ==
Outside of their Evermore work each of the Hume brothers has pursued their own careers. While still a member of Evermore, Dann started working as a producer on Lisa Mitchell&#x27;s first two EPs &quot;Said One to the Other&quot; (August 2007) and &quot;Welcome to the Afternoon&quot; (May 2008); he then re-recorded material for her debut studio album, &quot;Wonder&quot; (July 2009). Mitchell declared that working with Dann provided &quot;versions [that] had more energy and were a lot lighter – they were positive and uplifting&quot;. He also produced her second album, &quot;Bless This Mess&quot; (October 2012), working at The Stables Recording Studio instead of touring with Evermore.

Dann is also credited on Matt Corby&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Telluric&quot; (producer, engineer, co-writer, March 2016), Troye Sivan&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Blue Neighbourhood&quot; (December 2015) and Kita Alexander&#x27;s single &quot;Hotel&quot; (September 2017). He co-produced and co-engineered (with M-Phazes) the lead single, &quot;I Said Hi&quot; (April 2018) from Amy Shark&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Love Monster&quot; (July). At that year&#x27;s ARIA Awards they were both nominated for Producer of the Year (which they won) and Engineer of the Year. In the following year he won Producer of the Year again for his work on Corby&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Rainbow Valley&quot; (November 2018).

Jon worked on E^ST&#x27;s third EP, &quot;Get Money!&quot; (July 2016) as producer, mixer and composer. He followed with Bliss n Eso&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Off the Grid&quot; (producer, April 2017), Starley&#x27;s single &quot;Arms Around Me&quot; (producer, recording engineer, 2020) and Sheppard&#x27;s EP &quot;Highest of Highs&quot; (engineer, mixer, producer, 2021). In 2017 he sold The Stables Recording Studio to Jan Skubiszewski and Ilaria Walker, who renamed it Red Moon Studios. Jon co-wrote &quot;Be Alright&quot; (June 2018) with the singer Dean Lewis, which appeared on APRA billion streams list in 2019.

Besides being a mult-instrumentalist and singer Peter provides artwork, photography, graphic design, music video direction, cinematography and other promotional material. At the 2022 ARIA Music Awards Peter was nominated for Best Video as director for Luude&#x27;s cover version of &quot;Down Under&quot; featuring original singer Colin Hay.

<doc id="895169" wikidata="Q346523" url="?curid=895169" title="Andrea Cesalpino">
<text>Andrea Cesalpino (Latinized as Andreas Cæsalpinus) (1524/1525 – 23 February 1603) was a Florentine physician, philosopher and botanist.

In his works he classified plants according to their fruits and seeds, rather than alphabetically or by medicinal properties. In 1555, he succeeded Luca Ghini as director of the botanical garden in Pisa. The botanist Pietro Castelli was one of his students. Cesalpino also did limited work in the field of plant and animal physiology. In medicine, he envisioned a &quot;chemical circulation&quot; consisting of repeated evaporation and condensation of blood, and for this reason historians have conceived him as a forerunner of William Harvey (1578–1657), who theorized the &quot;physical circulation&quot; of blood in 1628.

== Biography ==

Cesalpino was born in Arezzo, Tuscany. As it is reported by Giuseppe Lais and Ugo Viviani with a series of important documents, and recently confirmed in a scholarly volume devoted to Cesalpino, he was likely born in the Autumn of 1524 in the outskirt of Arezzo.

For his studies at the University of Pisa his instructor in medicine was R. Colombo (d. 1559), and in botany the celebrated Luca Ghini. After completing his course he taught philosophy, medicine, and botany for many years at the same university, besides making botanical explorations in various parts of Italy. At this time the first botanical gardens in Europe were laid out; the earliest at Padua, in 1546; the next at Pisa in 1547 by Ghini, who was its first director. Ghini was succeeded by Cesalpino, who had charge of the Pisan garden 1554–1558. When far advanced in years Cesalpino accepted a call to Rome as professor of medicine at University of Rome La Sapienza and physician to Pope Clement VIII. It is not positively certain whether he also became the chief superintendent of the Roman botanical garden which had been laid out about 1566 by one of his most celebrated pupils, Michele Mercati. For the 1600 Jubilee, Cesalpino wrote a text on the history of the Church, entitled &quot;Historiae ecclesiasticae compendum usque ad Annum Jubilei MDC&quot;, kept as a manuscript at the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana in Rome (Vat. Lat. 35600), evidence of his orthodoxy.

== Philosophical works ==
All of Cesalpino&#x27;s writings show the man of genius and the profound thinker. His style, it is true, is often heavy, yet in spite of the scholastic form in which his works are cast, passages of great beauty often occur. Modern botanists and physiologists who are not acquainted with the writings of Aristotle find Cesalpino&#x27;s books obscure; their failure to comprehend them has frequently misled them in their judgment of his achievement.

No comprehensive summing up of the results of Cesalpino&#x27;s investigations, founded on a critical study of all his works has appeared, neither has there been a complete edition of his writings. Seven of these are positively known, and most of the seven have been printed several times, although none have appeared since the 17th century. In the following list the date of publication given is that of the first edition.

His most important philosophical work is &quot;Quaestionum peripateticarum libri V&quot; (1571). Cesalpino proves himself in this to be one of the most eminent and original students of Aristotle in the 16th century. His writings, however, show traces of the influence of Averroes, hence he is an Averroistic Aristotelian; apparently he was also inclined to pantheism, consequently he was included, later, in the Spinozists before Spinoza. A Protestant opponent of Aristotelian views, Nicolaus Taurellus wrote several times against Cesalpino. The work of Taurellus entitled &quot;Alpes cæsae&quot;, etc. (1597), is entirely devoted to combating the opinions of Cesalpino, as the play on the name Cæsalpinus shows. Nearly one hundred years later Cesalpino&#x27;s views were again attacked by Samuel Parker, in a work entitled &quot;Disputationes de Deo et providentia divina&quot; (1678).

Cesalpino repeatedly asserted the steadfastness of his Catholic principles and his readiness to acknowledge the falsity of any philosophical opinions expounded by him as Aristotelian doctrine, which should be contrary to revelation.

== Medical and physiological works ==
Cesalpino&#x27;s physiological investigations concerning the circulation of the blood are well known, but even up to the present time they have been as often overestimated as undervalued. An examination of the various passages in his writings which bear upon the question shows that although it must be said that Cesalpino had penetrated further into the secret of circulation of the blood than any other physiologist before William Harvey, still he had not attained a thorough knowledge, founded on anatomical research, of the entire course of the blood. Besides the work &quot;Quæstionum peripateticarum&quot; already mentioned, reference should be made to &quot;Quaestionum medicarum libri duo&quot; (1593).

== Botanical works ==
His most important publication was &quot;De plantis libri XVI&quot; (1583). The work is dedicated to the Grand Duke Francesco I de&#x27; Medici. Unlike the &quot;herbals&quot; of that period, it contains no illustrations. The first section, including thirty pages of the work, is the part of most importance for botany in general. From the beginning of the 17th century up to the present day botanists have agreed in the opinion that Cesalpino in this work, in which he took Aristotle for his guide, laid the foundation of the morphology and physiology of plants and produced the first scientific classification of flowering plants. Three things, above all, give the book the stamp of individuality: the large number of original, acute observations, especially on flowers, fruits, and seeds, made, moreover, before the invention of the microscope, the selection of the organs of fructification for the foundation of his botanical system; finally, the ingenious and at the same time strictly philosophical handling of the rich material gathered by observation. Cesalpino&#x27;s selection of seeds and seed-receptacles as the primary criteria for plant classification heavily influenced the classificatory work of John Ray, a major seventeenth-century British naturalist. After his death, an incomplete supplementary to this work, entitled &quot;Appendix ad libros de plantis et quaestiones peripateticas&quot; (1603), was published.

Cesalpino is also famous in the history of botany as one of the first botanists to make an herbarium; one of the oldest herbaria still in existence is that which he arranged in 1563 for Bishop Alfonso Tornabuoni. After many changes of fortune the herbarium is now in the Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze at Florence. It consists of 260 folio pages arranged in three volumes bound in red leather, and contains 768 species of plants. A work of some value for chemistry, mineralogy, and geology was issued by him under the title &quot;De metallicis libri tres&quot; (Rome, 1596). This mostly relies on the Vatican Methalloteca, and it was prepared by Mercati, who was unable to complete it due to his early death. Some of its matter recalls the discoveries made at the end of the eighteenth century, as those of Antoine Lavoisier and René Just Haüy, it also shows a correct understanding of fossils.
The Franciscan friar Charles Plumier gave the name of &quot;Cæsalpinia&quot; to a plant genus and Linnaeus retained it in his system. At the present day this genus includes approximately 10 species and belongs family Fabaceae, subfamily Cæsalpinioideae, which contains a large number of useful plants. Linnaeus in his writings often quotes his great predecessor in the science of botany and praises Cesalpino in the following lines:

&quot;Quisquis hic exstiterit primos concedat honores&quot;&quot;Cæsalpine tibi primaque certa dabit&quot;.

== Geology ==
As mentioned above, &quot;De metallicis libri tres&quot; (Rome, 1596) was of value for mineralogy and geology, displaying a correct understanding of fossils. Charles Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; states that in 1596,
Cesalpino, a celebrated botanist, conceived that fossil shells had been left on the land by the sea, and had concreted into stone during the consolidation of the soil.&quot;

<doc id="895170" wikidata="Q712516" url="?curid=895170" title="Motono Ichirō">
<text>was a statesman and diplomat, active in Meiji period Japan.

==Biography==
Motono was born in Saga, Hizen Province, (modern-day Saga Prefecture). His father, an entrepreneur, was one of the founders of the modern Yomiuri Shimbun. Motono studied law in France, and in 1896 translated the civil code of the Japanese Empire into French . He served as Minister Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Belgium in 1898–1901, and in that capacity represented the Empire of Japan at the 1899 Hague Peace Conference. In 1905 he served as a judge at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and formed a dissential opinion in the case of the Japanese Tax House . He served as the Japanese Ambassador to the Empire of Russia from 1906 to 1916.

On June 14, 1907, he was granted the title of baron (&quot;danshaku&quot;) under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system for his services, and was also awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 1st class. His title was elevated to that of viscount (&quot;shishaku&quot;) on July 14, 1916. Under the cabinet of Terauchi Masatake, he served as foreign minister of Japan between October 9, 1916 and his resignation on April 23, 1918. He was noted for his harsh stance against the Russian Revolution and his support of the Siberian Intervention. He died on September 17, 1918, and was awarded the Order of the Chrysanthemum.

<text>Carlos Pinto (born May 12, 1959) is a popular Chilean journalist, writer and television presenter. In 1984, he and Santiago Pavlovic began an investigative program called Informe Especial which airs in TVN. He is the father of the football player Sebastián Pinto. It was the driver of the reality The game of fear of TVN, which was taken off the air shortly after due to poor ratings.

In the mid-1990s Carlos Pinto&#x27;s new program, &quot;Mea Culpa&quot;, became the most popular true crime shows on Chilean TV history. The show catapulted Pinto&#x27;s career and today his other shows also have had great success:

* &quot;[[Carlos Pinto (journalist)|Mea Culpa]]&quot;, true crime movie-like interactments, featuring cases that had its share of spotlight back in the day;
* El Día Menos Pensado (&quot;The Least Expected Day&quot;), it focuses on true paranormal experiences;
* El Cuento del Tío (&quot;Uncle&#x27;s Tale&quot;), a show that deals with financial deception stories.

<text>Carlos Alberto da Mota Pinto (; 25 July 1936 – 7 May 1985) was a Portuguese professor and politician who served as the prime minister of Portugal between November 1978 and August 1979.

Mota Pinto was one of the first members of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) in 1974. As an independent, he was minister of Commerce and Tourism in the first Constitutional Government of Portugal, between 1977 and 1978. In November 1978, also as an independent, he was appointed by President António Ramalho Eanes to be the prime minister in the IV Constitutional Government. In the following year, he resigned from the position and was succeeded by Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo in August.

As a member of the PSD, he ran for prime minister in the 1983 legislative election, finishing second to Mário Soares, from the Socialist Party (PS). The two parties agreed on a coalition that became known as the Central Bloc, and Mota Pinto served as deputy prime minister and minister of National Defence in the IX Constitutional Government, between 1983 and 1985. A few months after leaving office, he died suddenly of an aneurysm at the age of 48.

==Career==
He graduated as a licentiate in law and doctorate in judicial sciences from the Faculty of Law of the University of Coimbra. He was also a professor at the Portuguese Catholic University and several foreign universities. Still today, his doctrine is very influential in the Portuguese legal community, mainly in what comes to civil law.

After the Carnation Revolution, on 25 April 1974, he helped in the foundation, jointly with Francisco Sá Carneiro, Francisco Pinto Balsemão, Joaquim Magalhães Mota, João Bosco Mota Amaral, Alberto João Jardim, António Barbosa de Melo and António Marques Mendes, of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD, today PSD). He was elected Deputy to the Constituent Assembly and to the Assembly of the Republic (the name of the Assembly has its origins in a Mota Pinto&#x27;s proposal) for PPD. Having distanced himself from Sá Carneiro, they would reconcile (at the time of Sá Carneiro&#x27;s death they both supported the same presidential candidate, Soares Carneiro). He would again return to the party to serve as vice-president in 1983 and President in 1984 and 1985.

He was also Minister for Commerce and Tourism in the first Constitutional Government of Portugal (1976–1977), Prime Minister of the 4th Constitutional Government between 1978 and 1979 when he was appointed by then President António Ramalho Eanes, Vice-Prime Minister and Minister for Defense of the 9th Constitutional Government (the &quot;Central-Bloc Government&quot;) from 1983 to 1985.

He died suddenly in 1985, in Coimbra, days before the Congress that gave the Presidency of the party to Aníbal Cavaco Silva.

==Decorations==
He was awarded with the Grand Crosses of the Order of Christ and the Order of Public Instruction.

==Family==
He married Maria Fernanda Cardoso Correia and had three sons: 
* Paulo Cardoso Correia da Mota Pinto (born Coimbra, 18 November 1966), a licentiate, doctorate, professor and renowned publicist of the Faculty of Law of the University of Coimbra;
* Nuno Cardoso Correia da Mota Pinto (born Coimbra, 18 September 1970), is the alternate executive director at the World Bank in Washington, D.C., married to Ianara Pedrosa;
* Alexandre Cardoso Correia da Mota Pinto (born 1971), a Doctor in Law from the Faculty of Law of the European University Institute of Florence and a Lawyer at Uría Menendez-Proença de Carvalho, married to Joana Ferraz.

<text>Luca Ghini (Casalfiumanese, 1490 – Bologna, 4 May 1556) was an Italian physician and botanist, notable as the creator of the first recorded herbarium, as well as the first botanical garden in Europe.

==Biography==
Ghini was born in Casalfiumanese, son of a notary, and studied medicine at the University of Bologna. By 1527 he was lecturing there on medicinal plants, and eventually became a professor.

He moved to Pisa in 1544, while maintaining his home in Bologna. He created the first herbarium (&quot;hortus siccus&quot;) in that year, drying plants while pressing them between pieces of paper, then gluing them to cardboard. None of his herbaria survive although the one by his student Gherardo Cibo made around 1532 survives. 1544 also saw the establishment of a garden for live plants, which became known as the Orto botanico di Pisa.

Ghini published no significant botanical work of his own, but was noted as a teacher many of whose students went on to significant careers, including Cesalpino (his successor as the director of the botanical garden) and Pietro Andrea Mattioli, the latter of which he helped by travelling around the Mediterranean and Near East in search for plants that matched the mystifying descriptions of Dioscorides. A &quot;Placiti&quot; revealing Ghini&#x27;s methods was published posthumously.

<text>Malcolm Muir (1885 – January 30, 1979) was a U.S. magazine industrialist.

==Biography==
Muir was born in New York City. He served as president of McGraw-Hill Publishing from 1928 to 1937. During his tenure as president, he helped create &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; magazine in 1929, the same year that McGraw-Hill stock was publicly traded for the first time.

The first issue of &quot;The Business Week&quot;, the original title of &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;, was published on September 7, 1929, a mere seven weeks before the stock market crash that signalled the beginning of the Great Depression. Muir is quoted as saying: &quot;&quot;The Business Week&quot; will never be content to be a mere chronicle of events. It aims always to interpret their significance ... &quot;The Business Week&quot; always has a point of view, and usually a strong opinion, both of which it does not hesitate to express. And all the way through, we hope you will discover it is possible to write sanely and intelligently of business without being pompous or ponderous.&quot;

Muir served as the editor-in-chief and president of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine between 1937 and 1959. He was responsible for changing the four-year-old &quot;News-Week&quot; magazine&#x27;s name to &quot;Newsweek&quot; and introducing international editions. He was named honorary chairman of the board when the Washington Post Company bought the magazine in 1961.

Muir died in 1979 in Manhattan from stomach disease, pneumonia and old age.

Sarah Lucille Turner, who had been one of the first women elected to the Missouri House of Representatives, became Muir&#x27;s secretary while he was president of McGraw-Hill. After a hiatus she returned to work for him at &quot;Newsweek&quot;, eventually becoming the magazine&#x27;s personnel director.

<text>Timothy Andrew Wohlforth (May 15, 1933 – August 23, 2019), was a United States Trotskyist leader. On leaving the Trotskyist movement he became a writer of crime fiction and of politically oriented non-fiction. 

As a student, Wohlforth joined the youth section of Max Shachtman&#x27;s Independent Socialist League (ISL), the Socialist Youth League in 1953. He broke with Shachtman in 1957 when the ISL moved rightward to merge with the Socialist Party of America. Later that year, Wohlforth and a minority of ISL members joined the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), which was the main Trotskyist group in the US at the time. 

In the early 1960s when the SWP and its supporters internationally in the International Committee of the Fourth International fused with the International Secretariat of the Fourth International and developed a critical but generally supportive attitude towards the Cuban Revolution, a minority of members led by Wohlforth and James Robertson (another former ISL member) formed the Revolutionary Tendency within the SWP. While Robertson left the SWP in 1962 and went on to form the Spartacist Group, later Spartacist League, Wohlforth and his supporters remained within the SWP and fought for the perspective of the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). They were expelled in 1964 after demanding a discussion of the significance of the Sri Lankan Lanka Sama Samaja Party&#x27;s entry into the government of Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The US supporters of the ICFI formed the American Committee of the Fourth International, and in 1966 they formed the Workers League.

In 1974, the ICFI discovered that Wohforth&#x27;s partner, Nancy Fields, an active member of the Workers League, was raised by a relative who had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s computer division and had ties to top-ranking agency officials. The Workers League Political Committee and ICFI criticized the fact that neither Fields nor Wohlforth had revealed this to the League. In August 1974, the League&#x27;s central committee suspended Fields from membership and removed Wohlforth as national secretary pending a commission of inquiry, in a unanimous vote that included Wohlforth&#x27;s. Both left the League, and Wohlforth rejoined the SWP. An investigation conducted by the Workers League concluded that Fields did not have connections to the CIA, and the two were requested to resume their membership. However, they refused.

Wohlforth later claimed that the Workers League became a cult, largely due to the domination and manipulations of the principal ICFI leader at the time, Gerry Healy. 

Wohlforth was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. In 1994 he published his memoirs, &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Children&quot;. He subsequently co-authored &quot;On The Edge: Political Cults Right and Left&quot; (2000) with Dennis Tourish. His former wife Nancy Wohlforth, is Secretary-Treasurer of the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) and on the Executive Committee of the AFL-CIO.

<doc id="895228" wikidata="Q19758473" url="?curid=895228" title="Thorp">
<text>Thorp is a Middle English word for a hamlet or small village.

== Etymology ==
The name can either come from Old Norse &quot;þorp&quot; (also &quot;thorp&quot;), or from Old English (Anglo-Saxon) &quot;þrop&quot;. There are many place names in England with the suffix &quot;-thorp&quot; or &quot;-thorpe&quot;. Those of Old Norse origin are to be found in Northumberland, County Durham, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk. Those of Anglo-Saxon origin are to be found in southern England from Worcestershire to Surrey. Care must be taken to distinguish the two forms. Variations of the Anglo-Saxon suffix are &quot;-throp&quot;, &quot;-thrope&quot;, &quot;-trop&quot; and &quot;-trip&quot; (e.g. Adlestrop and Southrope).

Old English (Anglo-Saxon) &quot;þrop&quot; is cognate with Low-Saxon &quot;trup&quot;/&quot;trop&quot;/&quot;drup&quot;/&quot;drop&quot; as in Handrup or Waltrop, Frisian &quot;terp&quot;, German &quot;torp&quot; or &quot;dorf&quot; as in Düsseldorf, the &#x27;Village of the river Düssel&#x27;, and Dutch &quot;dorp&quot;.

It also appears in Lorraine place-names as &quot;-troff&quot; such as Grosbliederstroff (France) in front of Kleinblittersdorf (Germany). It sometimes occurs in Normandy as Torp(s) / Tourp(s) / &quot;-tourp&quot; or even &quot;-tour&quot;, for instance : le Torp-Mesnil, le Tourp, Clitourps or Saussetour (Manche, &quot;Sauxetorp&quot; end 12th century, like Saustrup, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, former &quot;Saxtorppe&quot; and &quot;Saxtorf&quot;, former &quot;Saxtorpe&quot; 1538 idem, and Saxthorpe in Norfolk, England), all from Old Norse or Old English.

== Use ==
&quot;Thorp&quot; as a word appears in some role-playing games, where it is used to denote the smallest form of permanent collective habitation in the game world. Thorps in Dungeons and Dragons are defined as having between 20–80 inhabitants, while Pathfinder defines them as having 20 or fewer. Hamlets are the next most populous, housing 81–400 or 21–60 people in the respective games.

<doc id="895233" wikidata="Q2748239" url="?curid=895233" title="Thunder Bay International Airport">
<text>Thunder Bay Airport is in the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. With 108,130 aircraft movements in 2012, it was the fourth busiest airport in Ontario and the 16th busiest airport in Canada. During the same year, more than 761,000 passengers went through the airport.

The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle aircraft with up to 40 passengers.

The reference of &quot;International&quot; in the name of the Thunder Bay International Airport Authority Inc. (TBIAAI) is used for business purposes only. The TBIAAI has not sought to receive official Canadian designation as &quot;International&quot;, in accordance with all applicable domestic and international requirements as defined by ICAO Annex 9.

== History ==

It was built as the Fort William Municipal Airport in 1938, partly as a means of relieving unemployment.

During World War II, the Thunder Bay (then Fort William) airport was home to No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School, part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The airport was also used as a base for test flights of fighter aircraft being built at the nearby Canadian Car and Foundry factory.

Before the two cities of Fort William and Port Arthur merged, it was called the Canadian Lakehead Airport.

The airport went under major renovations in 1994 with the construction of a new airport terminal building, including two jetways, a large food court, a gift shop and an arcade.

The airport was handed over from the government in 1997 to the Thunder Bay International Airports Authority, a non-profit organization. The airport handled over 600,000 passengers in 2006 for the first time since 2001.

The airport underwent a runway rehabilitation and upgrade in 2022, this was &quot;the largest construction project undertaken in the history of the Airport Authority&quot;

===Historical aerodrome information===
In approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF &amp; D of T Aerodrome - Fort William, Ontario at with a variation of 01 degrees east and elevation of . Three runways were listed as follows:

===Historical airline jet service===

A number of airlines served the airport with scheduled passenger jet service in the past from the late 1960s to the early 2000s. These air carriers along with the respective jetliner types they operated from the airfield are as follows:

* Air Canada (mainline service): Airbus A319, Boeing 727-200, McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30
* Air Ontario: Fokker F28
* Canadian Airlines International: Boeing 737-200
* Canadian Regional Airlines: Fokker F28
* CanJet: Boeing 737-200
* Jetsgo: Fokker 100, McDonnell Douglas MD-80
* Nordair: Boeing 737-200
* North Central Airlines: McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30
* Pacific Western Airlines: Boeing 737-200
* Republic Airlines: McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30
* Transair: Boeing 737-200, Fokker F28
* Vistajet: Boeing 737-200

According to various Official Airline Guide (OAG) editions as well as airline timetables, the majority of jet service operated by Canadian-based air carriers was nonstop or direct to Toronto and Winnipeg. U.S.-based North Central Airlines operated nonstop flights to Duluth with continuing no change of plane jet service to Chicago–O&#x27;Hare while successor Republic Airlines also flew nonstop to Duluth with continuing no change of plane jet service to Minneapolis/St. Paul and then on to Denver.

During the mid-1980s, three airlines were competing with nonstop service operated with mainline jet aircraft between Thunder Bay and Toronto: Air Canada with Boeing 727-200 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 aircraft, Nordair with Boeing 737-200 aircraft and Pacific Western Airlines with Boeing 737-200 aircraft.

United Express served Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport from Thunder Bay from February 2013 to April 2014 using the Bombardier CRJ-200. This was the most recent flight offered from Thunder Bay to the United States.

The parking lot contains 100 short-term spaces, 300 long-term spaces, curbside taxi service and courtesy cars.

Thunder Bay Transit bus route 14 Arthur serves the airport terminal and the nearby Aviation Centre of Excellence. On peak hours, this airport is served every 30 minutes, and 45 minutes outside peak hours. This route connects the airport to Arthur Street and City Hall Terminal.

== Infrastructure ==
The Thunder Bay International Airport has a three-storey terminal building. Since the closure of Sears at Intercity Shopping Centre in 2018, this terminal is the only facility in Thunder Bay which uses escalators.

Thunder Bay&#x27;s runways are primarily used by small or larger turboprop, similar to the De Havilland Canada Dash 8 Q Series (400), and regional jet aircraft such as the Bombardier CRJ700 series, especially the CRJ900; however, they are capable of accommodating narrow-body jetliners such as the Embraer E-Jet E2 family operated by Porter Airlines, the Airbus A320 family operated by Air Canada Mainline and Air Canada Rouge and current generation Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Flair Airlines and on charter or occasional services operated by Air Transat, Sunwing Airlines and WestJet. Historically, the airport routinely handled Boeing 727-200, Boeing 737-200 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 mainline jet aircraft as well as the smaller Fokker F28 Fellowship twin jet in the past. Other larger jet aircraft types have also landed at the airport in the past with examples including a Boeing 720 operated by American Airlines in 1962, Boeing 757-200 and wide body Airbus A310 aircraft operated by Royal Aviation subsidiary Royal Airlines in 1999 and 2000, and a wide body Boeing 747SP operated as the &quot;Global Peace Ambassadors&quot; aircraft for Christian preacher K.A. Paul in 2005. The largest aircraft to land in Thunder Bay is the Antonov AN-124 which made four cargo trips direct from Austria between August 2017 and April 2018 with rail car parts for Bombardier.

The airport also has two fixed-base operators: Innotech Aviation Services for Shell Aviation, and Thunder Bay Flight Refuelling for World Fuel Services.

== Incidents and accidents ==
On 6 April 2009, Yavuz Berke, a 31-year-old Turkish-born Canadian student at the Aviation Centre of Excellence at Confederation College, stole its Cessna 172 at Thunder Bay airport and went for a joy ride. He crossed into US airspace where he was intercepted by two US Air Force F-16 fighter jets. He later landed on US Highway 60.

<text>Exercise Campaign Reforger (&quot;REturn of FORces to GERmany&quot;) was an annual military exercise and campaign conducted by NATO during the Cold War. The exercise was intended to ensure that NATO had the ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the Warsaw Pact. Although most troops deployed were from the United States, the operation also involved a substantial number of troops from other NATO countries including Canada and the United Kingdom. It was a basic military planning exercise to smooth out issues in the event of an invasion of western Europe, not just a show of force. Once the Cold War ended, it was superseded by other exercises.

The last Reforger exercise was Reforger 93. Exercise Steadfast Defender is the most similar military exercise that has taken place in the 21st century, also involving North American troops deploying across the Atlantic Ocean to exercise with European NATO allies. There is also the biennial Exercise Bright Star that involves operations in the Middle East. However, while NATO members (and other countries friendly to Egypt and the US) are free to participate, Exercise Bright Star is not a NATO exercise.

==History==

The Reforger exercise itself was first conceived in 1967. During the ongoing Vietnam War, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson announced plans to withdraw approximately two divisions from Europe in 1968. As a demonstration of its continuing commitment to the defense of NATO and to illustrate its capability of rapid reinforcement, a large scale force deployment was planned that would deploy a division or more to West Germany in a regular annual exercise. The first such exercise was conducted beginning on 6 January 1969.
Exercise Reforger 1988 is held to be the largest exercise during the Cold War. Involving around 125,000 troops, it was billed as the largest European ground maneuver since World War II.

These exercises continued annually past the end of the Cold War, except for the year 1989, until 1993. Reforger 75 marked the operational presence of the U.S. Marine Corps in Europe for the first time since World War I, when the 2nd Marine Division&#x27;s 32nd Marine Amphibious Unit was deployed from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina as part of that exercise.

Reforger was not merely a show of force—in the event of a conflict, it would be the actual plan to strengthen the NATO presence in Europe. In that instance, it would have been referred to as &quot;Operation Reforger&quot;. Important components in Reforger included the Military Airlift Command, the Military Sealift Command, and the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.

The U.S. Army also increased its rapid-reinforcement capability by prepositioning huge stocks of equipment and supplies in Europe at POMCUS sites. The maintenance of this equipment has provided extensive on-the-job training to reserve-component support units.

The last Reforger exercise was Reforger 93. No further Reforger exercises were held after due to German reunification, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, and the end of the Cold War.

The following units were earmarked to return to West Germany in case of war:

* III US Corps, Fort Hood, TX

<doc id="895249" wikidata="Q4785090" url="?curid=895249" title="Arcade and Attica Railroad">
<text>The Arcade and Attica Railroad is a shortline railroad that hauls freight between Arcade and North Java, New York. The railroad originally connected Arcade with Attica; however, the right of way from North Java to Attica was abandoned in 1957 due to flooding on the Tonawanda Creek.

The ARA&#x27;s main business is handling agricultural products (e.g. soybeans, corn, and fertilizer), lumber, dairy feed, and other commodities between Arcade and North Java. The ARA also runs passenger excursion trains from May to October on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Passengers can ride the round trip from Arcade to Curriers Station on restored 1920s-era Boonton passenger coaches as well as a covered gondola pulled by one of the vintage Centercab Diesels (#113, built in 1959, and #112, built in 1945).

As of 2024, ARA now uses its newly acquired 1952 RS3m #114 to handle freight runs from Arcade, NY to Reisdorf Brothers feed mill in North Java, NY. However, the railroad&#x27;s ALCo steam locomotive Arcade &amp; Attica 18 returned from a full rebuild in August 2024, meaning the General Electric centercab locomotives will take a break from frequent service.

==History==

The Arcade and Attica Railroad was the latest in a long succession of railroads planned and built through the Tonawanda Valley in Wyoming County.

In 1836, the Attica and Sheldon Railroad was proposed, but no construction ever took place.

In 1852, the Attica and Alleghany Valley Railroad was incorporated to build a narrow-gauge railway from Attica, through Arcade to the Pennsylvania state line. In 1853, the contract was let for construction and most of the road was graded between Attica and Arcade. Construction was discontinued in 1855, and the property was sold at foreclosure on February 2, 1856.

On February 28, 1870, the Attica and Arcade Railroad was organized and began purchasing the right of way with construction of the line scheduled for completion by October 1, 1876. The railroad went bankrupt in 1873, and construction remained uncompleted.

On April 5, 1880, the Tonawanda Valley Railroad was incorporated with major financial backing from the Erie Railroad. The company planned to build a , narrow gauge line from Attica, through Curriers Corners, to Sardinia to connect with the Buffalo, New York, and Pennsylvania Railroad. On September 11, 1880, the first train ran on the line from Attica to Curriers Corners. In October 1880, the Tonawanda Valley Extension Railroad was organized to extend the line from Curriers to Sardinia. By that winter the company changed its decision and began building to Arcade, rather than Sardinia. By May 1, 1881, the line had reached Arcade. On July 14, 1881, the Tonawanda Valley and Cuba Railroad was formed to extend the line from Arcade to Cuba via Sandusky and Rushford. On August 27, 1881, the Tonawanda Valley Railroad, Tonawanda Valley Extension Railroad, and Tonawanda Valley and Cuba were merged into the new Tonawanda Valley and Cuba Railroad. By September 4, 1882, the line was complete between Attica and Cuba. The Company built facilities to transfer to the standard-gauge Erie Railroad in Attica and Cuba. In Cuba, the company made a connection with the Bradford, Eldred and Cuba, another narrow-gauge railroad controlled by the Erie.

By September 1884, the company was defaulting on its bonds, and on November 29, the company was in receivership. The company&#x27;s situation declined further when Bradford, Eldred, and Cuba went bankrupt. The company struggled until October 30, 1886, when it stopped its service from Cuba to Sandusky. On January 19, 1891, the section from Attica to Freedom was sold to bondholders and in May of that year, the Attica and Freedom Railroad was formed. The line went bankrupt and was sold in April 1894.

On October 13, 1894, the Buffalo, Attica and Arcade Railroad was formed to operate the line. The new management switched the line to standard gauge, and by January 1895, the Attica to Curriers section was operating again. By December of that year, the line was open and running from Attica to Arcade. By December 1897, the company had laid a segment to connect with the Pennsylvania Railroad near Arcade. By January 1902, the company had built a line from Arcade to Sandusky with the ultimate goal of reaching Crystal Lake. In August of that same year, a flood washed out much of the line between Arcade and Sandusky along with the connection to the Pennsylvania RR.

In 1904, the BA&amp;A was sold to the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad which connected the BA&amp;A in Arcade. The B&amp;S operated the line until 1913 when it changed to being operated under lease from the Goodyear family by W. L. Kann of Pittsburgh. The railroad lost enough money in such a short time that Kann ended the agreement on his end. By 1916–1917, the foreclosure of the B&amp;S and W&amp;B forced the Buffalo, Attica, and Arcade into abandonment.

On May 23, 1917, the Arcade and Attica (A&amp;A) Railroad was formed by local investors to operate the line. The line had its ups and downs but survived. It had the enviable distinction of not laying off a single employee during the Great Depression. In 1941, the company purchased a 44-ton diesel from General Electric. The diesel was more dependable and much less expensive to operate than the steam locomotives. Many people credit the diesel for preventing the A&amp;A from going bankrupt in 1941. The Arcade and Attica operated passenger service until 1951 when the Erie stopped providing a service on the Buffalo-Hornell line, including the connection with the A&amp;A in Attica. In 1957, the line was abandoned between Attica and North Java because of severe washouts in the spring of that year.
During the 1960s, the Arcade &amp; Attica struck its mark when Borden&#x27;s debuted the non-dairy creamer &#x27;Cremora&#x27;. The Arcade facility was the sole Cremora production plant in the United States until its closure in 1970. The Arcade &amp; Attica Railroad brought in the raw supplies and shipped out the finished product across the US, its orange and white boxcars becoming iconic in the process.

On May 27, 2017, the railroad held a celebration marking the corporation&#x27;s centenary. As part of the celebration, steam locomotive No. 18 was turned on the wye to face the railroad south for the first time in its history. Until that weekend, it had always faced north. Other events included speeches at the station, employee photographs, a ribbon-cutting ceremony, and a cake-cutting at the Curriers Depot.

==Excursion line==

Railroad freight traffic started to decline due to advances made by the automobile and trucking industries following World War II, and the Arcade &amp; Attica was no exception. A solution was to purchase a light steam locomotive and a couple of passenger coaches for a tourist excursion service. After a few years of searching, A&amp;A management purchased #18, a 2-8-0 from the Boyne City Railroad in Michigan, and two commuter coaches from the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad. For 27 days, the A&amp;A offered passenger excursions in 1962. The following year, #14, a 4-6-0 from the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad and more coaches were purchased. Now, the Arcade and Attica runs all six coaches per run with an open-air gondola used by the United States Air Force. In addition to regular seasonal excursion services, the A&amp;A also hold various events that can be read about on their website, such as their annual Maple Run (Sponsored by Charlotte House) which takes riders all the way to the mill at North Java, Murder Mysteries,Train Robberies and World War 2 weekends, which offer unique and interactive experiences. They also offer alcohol-themed evening runs on certain weekends (Adults only, obviously.)There has also been a train for the Winterfest town celebration, a low mileage 20-30 minute run with the coaches to the Arcade Junction and back to the Depot. In addition to this, the A&amp;A is usually always able to accommodate special Charter runs, such as the 2023 &#x27;Centercab Charter&#x27; which functioned as a send-off to the Centercabs retiring from freight with the arrival of RS3m #406/#114. 
Over the years the A&amp;A coaches have sported four distinct schemes- The iconic orange they wear today, a bare orange scheme with a red stripe near the roof in the 70&#x27;s (&quot;Redline&quot;), a return to form in the 80&#x27;s incorporating the large font with the &quot;Redline&quot; scheme, and an era where the coaches were painted a pseudo Pullman Green, due to A&amp;A&#x27;s involvement in a movie and public opinion. 

In many ways, this can be viewed as either a throwback to Arcade&#x27;s original two combine coaches: 301 and 302; which were kept green all the way from inception to passenger service abandonment, or their original heritage of being Pullman green on the DL&amp;W. After the green started to fade from wear and tear, it was decided to go back to the orange that adorned the coaches in the 60&#x27;s. The font, however, is slightly different today.

The gondola has only had a handful of variations through the years but obtained a roof in the mid-2000s to shield folks from rain and/or soot on the return trip to Arcade. Prior to the &#x27;roof era,&#x27; it appeared with a USAF logo and lettering in its first few years, then a mix of bare wood and black paint; orange in the 70&#x27;s with black metal ends, and back to bare/black. The railing trim has been both yellow and orange through the years.

<text>Count Dmitry Andreyevich Tolstoy (; , Moscow – , Saint Petersburg) was a Russian politician and a member of the State Council of Imperial Russia (1866). He belonged to the comital branch of the Tolstoy family.

== Career ==
Tolstoy graduated from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum in 1843. He held a managing position at the Ministry of the Navy beginning in 1853. Tolstoy was an Ober-Procurator of the Holy Synod in 1865–1880, simultaneously holding a post of the Minister of National Enlightenment in 1866–1880.

In 1882–1889, Tolstoy was the interior minister and Chief of Gendarmerie. He is considered one of the pillars of the political reaction in the 1880s and supporter of the strong authority. Tolstoy&#x27;s activities were aimed at backing the nobility, regulating peasantry&#x27;s &quot;modus vivendi&quot;, and spreading his administration&#x27;s influence over local authorities. On Tolstoy&#x27;s initiative, they issued the so-called &quot;Temporary regulations&quot; in 1882, which limited the freedom of press to an even greater extent. Tolstoy, together with A. Pazukhin, outlined and prepared the so-called &quot;counterreforms&quot;, which would become very unpopular in Russia. As one of the great counter reformers of the post Crimean period Tolstoy used his position as minister of education to promote study at university and secondary levels that would bolster Russia as a nation with honest people in power looking to maintain Orthodoxy and Autocracy: something in danger during Tolstoy&#x27;s rule as the post Crimean period of reform amounted also to increasing rebellion and student dissent. Tolstoy did his best to educate a Russia, and moreover a Russian elite that would maintain Orthodoxy and Autocracy while being in mountable competition with the West. His focus was on consolidating his power over education while suppressing revolutionary attitudes by just censorship, etc.

Tolstoy was elected president of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1882. He wrote a number of books on Russian history.

=== Higher education ===
In 1871, Tolstoy was in charge of the college reform, which would result in the prevalence of the classical education (included Latin and Greek languages and ancient literature, among other things). 

Feminist activists Maria Trubnikova, Nadezhda Stasova, and Anna Filosofova began pushing, in 1867, for Russian universities to create courses for women. Demonstrating &quot;considerable skill in rallying popular support&quot;, according to the historian Christine Johanson, the women wrote a carefully-worded petition to Tsar Alexander II. They gathered over 400 signatures among middle and upper-class women. However, there was widespread opposition to the education of women, particularly by Tolstoy. Tolstoy argued that women would abandon education after being married, and dismissed the signatories by stating that they were &quot;sheep&quot; merely following the latest fashion. He rejected the petition in late 1868, but allowed mixed-gender public lectures which women could attend, under pressure from the Tsar (then Alexander II). However, these were rapidly taken up, overwhelmingly by women.

The feminist trio also appealed to war minister Dmitry Milyutin, who agreed to host the courses after being persuaded by his wife, daughter, and Filosofova. Tolstoy countered by allowing the lectures at his own apartments, where he could monitor them. The political movement in favor of women&#x27;s education continued to grow, and by October 1869, the Russian government permitted a limited set of courses for women on advanced subjects (including &quot;chemistry, history, anatomy, zoology, and Russian literature&quot;). Stasova organized these and recruited the professors to teach them; the courses began in January 1870. Attended by over 200 women, they became known as the &quot;Vladimirskii&quot; courses, after their host beginning in 1872, the Vladimir college.

<doc id="895276" wikidata="Q2265169" url="?curid=895276" title="Stacy X">
<text>Stacy X (Miranda Leevald) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Joe Casey and artist Tom Raney, she first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #399 (November 2001), when she was known as X-Stacy, and later became known as Ripcord. Stacy X belongs to the subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. She was briefly affiliated with the X-Men and was later known as a member of the New Warriors.

== Publication history ==
Stacy X first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #399 (November 2001), and was created by Joe Casey and Tom Raney.

==Fictional character biography==
Stacy-X is a mutant with the ability to exude pheromones which she could control to stimulate bodily sensations and functions of others. She also possesses patterned, snake-like skin.

Stacy first appears as a member of the Nevada mutant brothel, the X-Ranch. After the hate group the Church of Humanity destroys the ranch, Stacy joins the X-Men. Forthright and argumentative, Stacy did not take easily to teamwork and left the team shortly after joining. She plays a vital role in fighting Black Tom, using her powers to seduce him and releasing the other trapped X-Men, allowing them to defeat him. She also proved to be a highly skilled fighter, even giving Wolverine a proper workout. Where she got this training is unknown, much like everything else about her past.

Soon after the events at the X-Ranch, Stacy stayed at the Institute. She took some time off after &quot;servicing a special client&quot; in Chappaqua, New York. Wolverine tracked her down and fought with her, but soon the two came to an understanding. Whether Wolverine convinced Stacy to completely abandon her former profession is unknown, but he did talk Nightcrawler out of whatever censure he was contemplating. It was known that Stacy continued to work for &quot;special clients&quot; even as she operated as a member of the X-Men. Furthermore, during her membership with the X-Men, she tried to seduce members Archangel and Nightcrawler.

She became a team member who was highly depended upon. At one point when Chamber and Nightcrawler were stranded in the mountains, Chamber telepathically communicated with Stacy X to alert her of where they were located. While she brought help, she was upset that Chamber invaded her mind without permission until he told her she was the only one he thought would believe him.

At one point, Stacy works with a food magnate who is very sick. He reveals himself as a mutant with debilitating mutations: rapid aging and immunity to treatment. She changes his body chemistry to prevent him from feeling pain.

After a spat with Paige Guthrie / Husk, caused by the fact that they both had feelings for Archangel, Stacy decides to leave the mansion. However, she gives Archangel a video of herself jumping rope naked, stating that she did not want to stay around them. Rather, this will indicate to him that he missed the chance to have had someone as sexy as herself as a girlfriend, instead of Paige.

===Decimation and New Warriors===
Following the Decimation event, Stacy X is among the 98% of mutants who lost their powers to the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s magic. Subsequently, she joins the New Warriors as Ripcord before being killed in an accident along with Skybolt.

===&quot;Vengeance&quot;===
Stacy X mysteriously re-appears later. She is shown having a three-way sexual encounter with Welsh pop star Sugar Kane (Chamber&#x27;s onetime girlfriend) and new character Ultimate Nullifier in a high-rise hotel room after they are at a nightclub. The trio is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Magneto, who seeks to discipline Stacy for what he considers to be her disgraceful decadence which is embarrassingly tarnishing the collective image of Earth&#x27;s too few remaining mutants. Magneto proceeds to magnetically thrash the room and toss all of them around. However, Ultimate Nullifier engages in combat with Magneto while Stacy and Sugar Kane make their escape. Successfully subduing Magneto by depowering him with a power-dampening gun and beating him with formidable martial arts skills, Ultimate Nullifier then reveals to Magneto that he was actually secretly acting as a bodyguard to Stacy and that it is his mission to protect her from Magneto.

==Powers and abilities==
Stacy X can produce sensations and physical reactions in anyone, such as orgasms, vomiting or adrenaline rushes, and can heal others by speeding up their healing process, due to the pheromones she secretes. Initially, she had to make physical contact to produce these sensations and physical reactions. Later, she became able to influence others without making direct contact with others, by launching her pheromones through the air.

Stacy X has a scaly, snake-like skin, which increases her durability, although the limit of her durability has never been demonstrated.

Additionally, she is an expert fighter, having some martial arts abilities, and was able to even challenge Wolverine.

==Reception==
===Accolades===
* In 2010, &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; ranked Stacy X 3rd in their &quot;5 Superheroes Who Used Their Powers For Sex&quot; list.
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Stacy X 92nd in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel reality, Ultimate Stacy X is introduced in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; as the girlfriend of Mastermind, and she stays with him in the cell where he is currently impersonating Magneto, replacing Mystique (who was doing the same after he escaped during the events of the &quot;Magnetic North&quot; storyline). In &quot;Ultimate Comics: X-Men&quot; she is seen in Camp Angel, camps where mutants are forced to live by the government in the aftermath of the Ultimatum Wave. She considers herself a political prisoner of war and urges mutants into revolution.

==In other media==
Stacy X was originally supposed to appear in &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, with Dania Ramirez auditioning for the role. However, the producers were unable to find an actress to play the character and instead had Ramirez play Callisto.

<text>Trevor Lloyd Wadley, (1920 – 21 May 1981) was a South African electrical engineer, best known for his development of the Wadley Loop circuit for greater stability in communications receivers and the Tellurometer, a land surveying device.

== Life and career==
Wadley was born in 1920 in Durban, South Africa. His father was the Mayor of Durban and Trevor was one of 12 children. He attended Durban High School 
where he excelled in mathematics and science but was uninterested in any sport. The exception was one year when he entered the annual cross-country athletics event and predicted that he would win in record time and his record would stand for 15 years. He went on to do exactly as he had predicted. His training method involved calculating the time he needed to run each section of the course and then training himself to run at the required pace for each section.

He then went to Howard College (now the University of KwaZulu-Natal), where he studied under Hugh Clark and Eric Phillips, after which he completed his Thesis (D.Sc.) at the University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Science, 1959, Heterodyne techniques in specialised radio instrumentation . He had the habit of rarely, if ever, taking notes in lectures due to his near-eidetic memory. GR Bozzoli noted in is book &quot;Forging Ahead – South Africa’s Pioneering Engineers&quot; that Wadley &quot;would very occasionally take out a small pocket notebook and write a word or two in it using a blunt, stubby pencil. His remarkable mind understood and remembered every item of a lecture&quot;.

In 1941, during World War II, he joined the Special Signals Services (SSS) of the South African Corps of Signals which was engaged in developing South Africa&#x27;s own radar system based on the British experience which had been communicated to them. Wadley and other colleagues including Jules Fejer, the Hungarian-born mathematician, were trained on the British RADAR project. His association with Fejer would continue for many more years. Wadley was not keen on mathematics but Fejer proved each of Wadley&#x27;s concepts mathematically.

In 1946, Wadley was employed as a designer of radio equipment and instrumentation in a special division of the Telecommunications Research Laboratory (TRL), created at the behest of Prime Minister Jan Smuts and located at the electrical engineering department of the University of the Witwatersrand (under Basil Schonland). The TRL relocated to the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and was renamed the National Institute for Telecommunications Research (NITR) (under Dr Frank Hewitt).

In 1948, Wadley started working on an urgent project for the South African Chamber of Mines to provide a means of radio communication underground for rescue purposes. After a feasibility investigation Wadley wrote a report indicating that it could be done and detailing his recommendations. The Chamber did not pursue the matter for more than a decade.

Wadley retired in 1964 (aged 44) and lived on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal until his death from cancer in 1981 (aged 61).

== Wadley loop ==
It was in 1948 at the CSIR that Wadley invented the Wadley Loop receiver, which allowed precision tuning over wide bands, a task that had previously required switching out multiple crystals. The Wadley Loop was first used in the Racal RA-17 a 1950s top-of-the-range British military short wave receiver and later in the South African made, commercially available &quot;Barlow-Wadley XCR-30&quot; radio. The Wadley Loop is more widely used today in spectrum analysers, where the noise sidebands of the analyser&#x27;s tunable oscillator are cancelled due to the spectrum analyser having a sideband noise much lower than the signals being measured. This device was even more useful to the SABC, SAPO, the South African Military and British Government agencies.

A Wadley receiver (circa 1952) is on display at the South African Institute of Electrical Engineers historical collection in Observatory, Johannesburg.
== Tellurometer ==

In the early 1950s the CSIR was asked to develop a portable measuring device that could measure distances with an accuracy of 1 in 100 000. In 1954 this project was given to Wadley. Colonel Harry A. Baumann (Rhodes Scholar, engineer and Land Surveyor) of the South African Trigonometrical Survey had already come up with the invention and Wadley developed it further.

The Tellurmeter could measure up to a distance of 80 km by measuring the time delay in microwave transmissions. It was used in land surveying but has been mostly replaced with laser-based systems. The replacement to the microwave tellurometer was also developed by a South African, H.D. Hölscer. Miniaturised versions are still used in some surveying instruments and mine lift-shafts.

One of the first test of the tellurometer involved a measurement of the distance between Brixton Hill in Western Johannesburg and Fort Klapperkop in Pretoria, this being the most accurately known survey baseline in South Africa at the time. It successfully proved the accuracy of the tellurometer but, over time, Wadley noticed a bias to the measurements he was obtaining. He ascribed these to an inaccurate value of the speed of light that had been supplied to him. He approached the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington in England and they agreed to do a new measurement of the speed of light. The new measurement vindicated Wadley&#x27;s claim.
In 1958 the Tellurometer was used to measure Manhattan (13.08 miles). The measurement took 1 hour (plus two hours for the technicians to move from the south end of the island to the north.) Previously the measurement had taken 5 days.

When the system was demonstrated in England before a group including the British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, it showed that a line on the Salisbury Plain which had been used as the baseline for British surveying had been incorrectly calculated by 1.5 meters. 
Subsequent sales of the device earned more than R300 million (in 1960&#x27;s terms) in foreign revenue for South Africa. Tellurometers are still manufactured in Plumstead, South Africa.

== Ionosonde ==
At the CSIR he developed a local version of the device called an ionosonde for measuring the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere; the original device was developed by Breit and Tuve in 1925. It is a specialised form of a radar detector used to measure the height of the ionised layers of air between 50 and 600 kilometers. This information gives insight into what is occurring during an ionospheric storm. The ionosonde was used to provide a transmission frequency prediction service to the SABC, the South African Postal Service (SAPO) and South African Military.

<doc id="895292" wikidata="Q2166951" url="?curid=895292" title="Uplift Universe">
<text>The Uplift Universe is a fictional universe created by American science fiction writer David Brin. A central feature in this universe is the process of biological uplift.

His books which take place in this universe are:

* &quot;Sundiver&quot; (1980)
* &quot;Startide Rising&quot; (1983) 
* &quot;The Uplift War&quot; (1987) 
* The Uplift Storm trilogy (sometimes called the Uplift Trilogy):
** &quot;Brightness Reef&quot; (1995) 
** &quot;Infinity&#x27;s Shore&quot; (1996)
** &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Reach&quot; (1998)

There is also a short story, &quot;Aficionado&quot; (originally titled &quot;Life in the Extreme&quot;), published in 1998, which serves as a prequel to the series as a whole (it also serves as a part of &quot;Existence&quot;, an unrelated work by Brin), and a novella, &quot;Temptation&quot;, published in 1999 in &quot;Far Horizons&quot;, which follows on from &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Reach&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Contacting Aliens: An Illustrated Guide to David Brin&#x27;s Uplift Universe&quot;, a guidebook about the background of the series.

At least one more Uplift book is planned by Brin, as he has stated in 2012 that &quot;Temptation&quot; &quot;will be a core element of the next Uplift novel... and answers several unresolved riddles left over from Heaven&#x27;s Reach.&quot;

&quot;GURPS Uplift&quot; is a sourcebook for a science fiction themed role-playing game based on the Uplift Universe. It includes a few stories that happen in Jijo after the end of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Reach&quot;.

== Setting ==
In the Uplift universe an intergalactic civilization called the Five Galaxies, comprising a multitude of sapient races, has existed for billions of years. This civilization is perpetuated by the act of &quot;uplift&quot;, in which a &quot;patron&quot; species genetically modifies a pre-sapient &quot;client&quot; species until it is sapient. The client species is typically indentured to its patron species for 100,000 years. A patron species gains considerable status, and patrons and clients often unite into powerful clans. Patron status can be lost due to extermination, or gross crimes against the galactic civilization. Brin helped popularise the term &#x27;Uplift&#x27; within the context of science fiction which has since been used by academics writing in the field generally for the concept.

It is generally accepted in this universe that the process of uplift was initiated over two billion years ago by a species known only as the Progenitors. Humanity is therefore an anomaly – a species with no apparent patron race. Whether humanity truly evolved independently, or whether it was criminally abandoned by an unknown patron early in its uplift, is a topic of fierce debate. Most of humanity believes itself to be a &quot;wolfling&quot; species that emerged into sapience solely through natural evolution, without genetic manipulation by a patron species. This belief is considered heresy and ridiculous by most of the galactic civilization and has made most of the galactic powers enemies of EarthClan. The fact that humanity had already uplifted two species (chimpanzees and bottlenose dolphins) when it encountered the galactic civilization gave humanity patron status, which is one of the few lucky turns it has had in its difficult position as pariah in the galactic civilization. This saved humanity from the likely fate of becoming client to another race through forced adoption or being punitively exterminated for the environmental damage done to the Earth and its native species. Philosophically, it has been noted Brin sees lower life forms with potential for uplift like children, that will grow into adults.

Humanity and its clients are collectively known as EarthClan, with a government known as the Terragens Council. Hierarchy exists within the different sentient species on earth, though they are all cooperative Humanity in the Uplift universe is not a dominant nor a technologically advanced species – it is centuries, even millennia, behind the great galactic powers and has several enemies capable of exterminating it entirely. While there is cooperation between humans and different alien races, there is also cooperation between humans and their &quot;client&quot; (uplifted animal) races, to the point in that they cooperatively crew spaceships.

The civilization of the Five Galaxies has several &quot;Institutes&quot;, which are bureaucracies that specify how species deal with each other and the uplift process. One of the most significant of these is the Library Institute, the repository of all knowledge. Humanity prides itself on using the Library as little as possible. For instance, instead of drawing upon the highly refined starship designs available in the Library, humanity tends to develop its own (generally vastly inferior) vessels. Humans feel that this is a way to exercise their own independence and creativity, and it occasionally allows them to find solutions to problems which have in fact surprised more powerful races.

The Institute of Migration determines what planets can be colonized and under what environmental restrictions, primarily to ensure that suitable races can still evolve for later uplift. The institute also ensures the separation of the hydrogen-breathing and oxygen-breathing orders of sapient life. Other intergalactic institutes regulate the uplift of sapient species, navigation, warfare, etc. Bureaucrats are recruited from all races but are expected to put the interests of their bureau before that of their race and maintain strict neutrality; however, this does not always happen.

The civilization of the Five Galaxies is made up solely of oxygen-breathing species. This civilization is aware of, but by tradition rarely if ever interacts with, the other orders of sapient life, which include those which are hydrogen-breathing, transcendent, mechanical, memetic, and quantum. There is also a special designation for hypothetical orders of life which could also exist but have not been discovered.

=== Technology ===
Unlike most other races, humans and their clients regard creativity as very desirable – the others take the view that everything useful has already been discovered, so it would be more efficient to search the Galactic Library for whatever they need. EarthClan are also considered odd for using archaic technology in addition to the more advanced Galactic technology, or sometimes preferring primitive technologies that they understand to more advanced ones that they don&#x27;t yet understand. Most notably, EarthClan utilizes calculus, which is unknown and mistrusted by galactic society. All other races simply apply brute-force, finite-element analysis to any problem due to their ability to apply as much computing power as may be needed to model all phenomena.

===Social behavior===
Most Galactic &quot;clans&quot; are rather feudal and sometimes exploitative, and place strong emphasis on etiquette and especially on deferential behavior by members of &quot;subordinate&quot; races towards members of &quot;superior&quot; races. Hence they often regard EarthClan&#x27;s informal speech as insulting and the humans&#x27; egalitarian treatment of their Neo-Chimp and Neo-Dolphin clients as foolish, if not outright offensive.

===Languages===
In the uplift world, the uplifted clients speak &quot;Anglic&quot;, a uniform language that replaced all previous human languages, and all EarthClan schools also teach &quot;GalSeven&quot;, a widely used galactic language. Dolphins are portrayed as adept with languages, and have two of their own: &quot;Trinary&quot;, a whistling language in which they speak in haiku, and &quot;Primal Dolphin&quot;, the &quot;dream language&quot;, which is a song-like language they can use to communicate with each other and with whales. Uplifted animals can lose their power to speak when stressed, as a temporary de-evolution

Galactics have several specialized languages, including mathematical, tonal, sonar-based and &quot;bridging&quot; languages. Some languages are more sophisticated than others: in one novel, an alien called Alvin, who is a “Hoon” (alien species), notes that only some languages are good enough to describe highly technical processes, and notes how some people switch to &quot;Galseven&quot; or &quot;Galtwo&quot;, which he does not understand. Chimps&#x27; vocal chords have been modified so that they can articulate human speech.

==EarthClan==
EarthClan is the name of humanity and their clients (an animal or plant species being uplifted) in David Brin&#x27;s Uplift Universe. They are named for their combined homeworld Earth.

In the books, humanity is an insignificant race, having no known Patrons (a species responsible for uplifting them) and having mostly primitive technology. Humans have two (confirmed) clients and are referred to formally as &quot;a-Human ul-Chimpanzee ul-Dolphin&quot;. By becoming patrons before contact with Galactic society, humanity unknowingly protected itself from being forced into becoming a client of an older race.

=== Humans ===
Humans in the Uplift universe have generally not undergone serious genetic manipulation, though there has been a concerted effort to mix all human ethnicities and breed superior humans. Advanced augmentative technologies exist, but are not widely used by humans. Humans themselves are &quot;patrons&quot; to other species that they uplift.

=== Neo-Chimpanzees ===
Chimpanzees were the first clients of humans and are the most &quot;complete&quot; in that they are closest to full sapiency. Initially, chimpanzees are removed from their families and raised in human environments, where they are uplifted, and given language abilities. They are Stage 2 clients but almost became Stage 3 when the Gubru invaded Garth. Neo-Chimpanzees like music, specifically percussion. They are embarrassed by situations which remind them of their earlier status as &quot;smart animals&quot;, especially about nudity, tree-climbing and above all losing their ability to speak when under stress. Both dolphins and chimpanzees lose some of their sentient abilities in certain situations, a theme of devolution in Brin&#x27;s work.

=== Neo-Dolphins ===
Dolphins were the second clients of humans, and are some of the best pilots in the Five Galaxies because their aquatic origins give them excellent instincts for 3-D maneuvers. They are also important in planetary warfare because most Galactics are unaware of the strategic potential of the sea. Neo-Dolphins are Stage-2 Clients, and recently got their own starship, &quot;Streaker&quot; (&quot;Streaker&quot;″s discoveries later caused controversy among the oxygen-breathing sapient species). Neo-Dolphins are at a relatively early stage of uplift, and this has several consequences which are important in the plots of the stories: the optimal genetic mix for Neo-Dolphins has not yet been determined, and some of the newer genetic mixes become dangerous to colleagues when under stress; there are significant differences between older and younger Neo-Dolphins, in particular older individuals find it more difficult to speak; and they have to struggle against tendencies to slip into atavistic behaviours such as the &quot;Whale Dream&quot; and rescue fever (which leads them to beach themselves). Dolphins and humans interact with a version of English called Anglic.

=== Neo-Gorillas ===
Humans had agreed not to uplift Gorillas until their other clients were further along the path of Uplift. However, some humans secretly continued the project on the small colony-world of Garth. Neo-Gorillas have some understanding that they are being uplifted, and chose the Thennanin as their &quot;patrons&quot; at a ceremony on Garth. This is politically very important, as the conservative and conscientious Thennanin are a major military power and the Neo-Gorillas&#x27; choice converts the Thennanin from enemies to allies of EarthClan. After adoption by the Thennanin, the Neo-Gorillas are termed &quot;Garthlings.&quot;

=== Kiqui ===
Kiqui are a pre-sapient amphibious species first discovered on the planet Kithrup by &quot;Streaker&quot;″s crew, who persuade them to be uplifted as clients of the humans. If this goes ahead, the Kiqui would become humanity&#x27;s first extraterrestrial clients.

== Major themes ==

=== Uplift ===
The concept of Uplift is a major theme of the novels and has been referred and discussed in numerous science articles, including both psychology and zoological journals. The novel content has been referred to as excellent cases of theoretical uplift scenarios by George Dvorsky, writing in the &quot;Journal of Evolution and technology&quot;. While the concept itself had been addressed by other writers before Brin, for instance, H.G. Wells in &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;, it was Brin that coined the term, which has since been used by academics writing in the field generally for the concept

====Uplift as a positive concept====
Brin himself has noted that other authors, such as Wells, have covered the idea of uplifting animals, but in these examples the uplift was a &quot;Frankenstein&quot;-like negative concept, with the animals becoming monsters, portraying the dark side of uplift and the dangers of scientists playing god. In Brin&#x27;s works, the same concept is used positively to bring humans closer to animals, which he sees as an endgame.

Other writers have commented on this aspect of Brin, differentiating him from other writers because of this, in comparison to how it is portrayed to most other fiction. Most other writers treat the uplifted animals badly in their various scenarios. The uplifted animals are used as tools or slaves, or in the case of the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, as villains. Brin&#x27;s take on the concept is more positive, with the &quot;human patrons and their chimp and dolphin clients work together in a joyous partnership&quot;, and that it is almost the human&#x27;s duty to uplift lesser creatures to an equal footing with their patrons.

=== Ecology ===
Ecology and stewardship of genetic diversity are major themes in the Uplift books. In this Universe, the protection of ecology is given a lot of importance by the various alien races, and those races found to be ecologically destructive are seen as criminals by the various other races in the books, and punished for their crimes.

====Religion====
Religious orthodoxy and the behavior of static societies are also themes. Most of the races that antagonize EarthClan and pursue &quot;Streaker&quot; are described as religious fanatics, and are angry at the possibility that lowly EarthClan may have discovered the fate of the Progenitors, possibly in direct contradiction to the core beliefs of several galactic religions. Earthclan mostly does not follow these religions, instead half-jokingly entrusting their fate to &quot;Ifni&quot;, a goddess of luck and chance, although there is also a subset of Earthclan known as the Daniks who are in a cult that believes galactic con-artists, the Rothen, are humanity&#x27;s lost patrons.

=== Speciesism ===
One of the main themes of his work is the idea of speciesism. Brin&#x27;s themes of animals uplifted to humans has been noted as rallying against speciesist viewpoints in modern society. His work implies that humans are not that different from animals. Brin himself has spoken about the glass ceiling that non human species are up against in terms of evolution, and how it is almost the luck of the draw that humans were the chosen phylum to achieve sentience. These themes are apparent in his work. However, it has been noted, despite the uplifting of some species, and Brin&#x27;s work seeking an egalitarian proposed society for lower life forms and humans, that humans are still however positioned in the novels as the central heroes.

The connected theme to the fact that humans are the only intelligent species on the planet, is that, as such, we have a responsibility to other species, and it is an obligation that we must help other species, including uplifting them to sentience. Brin and his work proposes that it is almost selfish of humans not to consider uplifting other creatures to the human level of sentience.

=== Devolution ===
Devolution is also a theme in his work. This is one of the methods in the books for indicating the difference and superiority of humans over others. Both the Neo Chimpanzees and the Neo Dolphins at time revert to their basic animal nature, in particular when under stress, at one point the whole dolphin crew, except for a few, all devolve to basic animal behaviour. This brings great shame to them, in particular to the Neo Chimpanzees. Because the clients have gained their sentience via uplifting and the process is incomplete, it is imperfect, and they can at times revert to their devolved state. The theme of devolution is also investigated through the six races on Jijo, who profess to actually aspire to it, as part of a self discovery mystical experience. In contrast to the Aliens and the uplifted animals, the humans do not devolve nor wish to.

=== The importance of language ===
The importance of language is also a theme, with the gaining of language being a marker of sentience, and the loss of it in certain situations by the chimps as a shameful thing. All the uplifted creatures gain the gift of language, when they are uplifted by humans. Mental and physical abilities are both tested, tests by aliens on the uplifted animals test both, and while physical abilities between non uplifted chimps and uplifted ones will be the same, mental abilities obviously will be enhanced. In terms of language for instance, humans are proud of the chimp character Jeffrey (the main chimp character in &quot;Sundiver&quot;), who continues to use human speech, even when faced with the stress of death, which he succumbs to. The level of sophistication of languages is something that was noted in by Ina Roay-Faderman, who notes that only some sophisticated languages could be used to describe highly technical issues to deal with space travel.

=== Colonialism ===
Some commentary has highlighted the parallels between the uplifted races and their patrons, and colonialism. Brin himself is quite critical of the concept, and highlights where some patrons uplift lesser beings, and then exploit them instead of helping them. Humans however on the whole treat their uplifted clients better than many others are treated by their patrons, generally, within the galaxy.

== Plot outline ==

The first book in the Uplift series, &quot;Sundiver&quot; (1980), is essentially a detective story and occurs only decades after humanity&#x27;s first contact with the Five Galaxies. In this story mankind discovers the sun&#x27;s inhabitants and a plot to overthrow a patron race. This is the only novel to directly involve Earth. The protagonist, Jacob Demwa, is referenced in later novels as a mentor in Gillian Baskin and Tom Orley, and the captain of the &quot;Sundiver&quot; appears briefly in &quot;The Uplift War&quot;, having been promoted to admiral. This suggests human lifespans have been significantly extended by galactic technology.

The second book, &quot;Startide Rising&quot; (1983), occurs centuries later. It follows the Earthclan amphibious spaceship &quot;Streaker&quot; (crewed by uplifted dolphins and their human patrons) which has discovered a colossal derelict fleet. &quot;Streaker&quot; is pursued as rumors spread throughout the Five Galaxies that the ship has found the remains of the Progenitors.

The third book, &quot;The Uplift War&quot; (1987), occurs around the same time as &quot;Startide Rising&quot; but in another part of the galaxy. An intergalactic war, sparked by the events of &quot;Startide Rising&quot;, results in a successful invasion of the EarthClan colony on the planet Garth, heavily populated by uplifted chimps.

In 1995 &quot;Brightness Reef&quot; was published, the first book in a new Uplift trilogy. The &quot;Uplift Storm&quot; trilogy (excluding the first book, which solely focuses on Jijo) follows the survivors of the spaceship &quot;Streaker&quot; as they continue to evade the various galactic powers. Along the way they encounter a hidden planet which has been inhabited by six races which have illegally settled and dropped out of the civilization of the Five Galaxies. They eventually make contact with the other orders of life. The second and third books in the new Uplift trilogy are &quot;Infinity&#x27;s Shore&quot; and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Reach&quot;.

In &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Reach&quot;, the series sums up with conclusions on the nature of life in the universe and revelations on the motivations of the oldest species in the Five Galaxies. Further explanations are provided on the &quot;Streaker&quot;″s continuing mission, Earth&#x27;s fate after invasion, and the nature of galactic life in the overlapping conspiracies of galactic civilization.

The short story &quot;Aficionado&quot; or &quot;Life in the Extreme&quot; is set earliest of all the currently written work and gives an account of the early days of the human uplift program before Contact. The contents of this story have since been reused as part of the unrelated novel &quot;Existence&quot;, making its position in the uplift universe uncertain.

The novella &quot;Temptation&quot; is set back on Jijo just after the ending of &quot;Infinity&#x27;s Shore&quot;, and tells what happened to some of the characters from the trilogy after &quot;Streaker&quot; escaped from Jijo, as well as offering some hints as to the fate of the mysterious Buyur, the last race to legally settle there.

<text>Atos SE is a European multinational information technology (IT) service and consulting company with headquarters in Bezons suburb of Paris, France, and offices worldwide. It specialises in hi-tech transactional services, unified communications, cloud, big data and cybersecurity services. Atos operates worldwide under the brands Atos, Syntel, Eviden.

==History==

The company was formed in 1997 through a merger of two French IT companies; and combined with the Dutch-based company Origin B.V. in 2000 to become Atos Origin. It subsequently acquired KPMG Consulting in 2002 and SchlumbergerSema in 2004. 

In 2010 Atos Origin announced the buyout of Siemens IT Solutions and Services and finalized the acquisition in July 2011. Afterwards, the company name reverted to Atos.

From 2022 to 2024 there were negotiations with Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský to sell Atos for about $2 billion, which ended in failure in February 2024.

===Background: a series of mergers===
In 1996, Origin B.V. was created after a merger of the Dutch company BSO and the Philips C&amp;P (Communications &amp; Processing) division, while a year later in 1997, Atos was created following a merger of the French companies Axime and Sligos. In 2001, Atos Origin sold its Nordic operations to WM-data. In 2002, it made a major acquisition by buying KPMG Consulting in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands. Then in 2004, it acquired SchlumbergerSema, the IT service division of Schlumberger and took over the infrastructure division of ITELLIUM, a subsidiary of KarstadtQuelle.

At the same time (2004), the company created a new subsidiary, Atos Worldline, and the renaming of its consulting activities as Atos Consulting. Also in 2004, Atos Origin Australia, originating from Philips, was sold to Fujitsu. In 2005, Atos Origin sold its activities in the Nordic region, which had become part of the company with the acquisition of Sema Group, to WM-data while in 2006, Atos Origin sold its operations in the Middle East to local management.

In October 2007, Philippe Germond replaced longtime CEO Bernard Bourigeaud. Two shareholders, the hedge funds Centaurus Capital and Pardus Capital, tried to gain control over the company via the supervisory board. In November 2008, the boardroom battle came to an end when Thierry Breton replaced Philippe Germond as chairman and CEO.

===Siemens IT ===
In December 2010 Atos Origin agreed to acquire the IT subsidiary of Siemens for €850 million. As part of the transaction, Siemens agreed to take a 15% stake in the enlarged Atos, to be held for a minimum of five years.

The company dropped the &quot;Origin&quot; suffix of its name in July 2011 after completing its acquisition of the Siemens unit. This was said to stand for &quot;Atos to Siemens&quot; hence the logo contains a capitalised S (AtoS).

In November 2011 Atos and software services provider Ufida International Holdings formed the joint venture Yunano. The two companies invested €5.7 million. Atos has 70 percent and UFIDA has 30 percent. The joint venture has its HQ in Bezons, France, a suburb of Paris. In 2012 Atos announced the creation of a new company called Canopy. The CEO is Philippe Llorens. In 2011 Atos introduced a Zero Email initiative, banning email as a form of internal communications, except for use with customers and prospects. As part of the initiative, Atos acquired the French software company blueKiwi in early 2012, rolling out their ZEN social networking software across its organisation.

===Bull===
In August 2014, Atos announced that it had acquired a controlling stake in Bull SA through a tender offer launched in May. Atos announced plans in October 2014 to buy out or squeeze out the remaining share and bondholders of Bull.

=== Xerox ITO ===
On 19 December 2014 Atos announces the acquisition of Xerox&#x27;s IT Outsourcing business for , tripling the size of the North American business. At the time of the acquisition, the unit generated (Q3 2014) and had 9,800 employees operating in 45 countries.

=== Syntel ===

In October 2018, the company accelerated its expansion in North America with the (including debt) acquisition of Syntel, a company with activities in banking, financial services, healthcare, retail and insurance.

===Google Cloud===

In April 2018, Atos announced a global partnership with Google Cloud to help offer secure artificial intelligence systems. As part of this partnership, the two companies would create common offerings and open &quot;labs&quot; dedicated to artificial intelligence in London, Dallas, Munich and Paris.

===Worldline===

In 2019, the company divested from Worldline, its payment subsidiary, as part of its strategy to become a &quot;digital pure player&quot;. The company gradually sold its shares, retaining only a 3.82% stake in Worldline as at April 2020.

On 1 November 2019, Elie Girard replaced Thierry Breton as chief executive officer, following Breton&#x27;s appointment as EU commissioner.

===Maven Wave===

In December 2019, Atos acquired Maven Wave, a US-based Google Cloud Premier Partner specialising in cloud and mobile applications, data analytics, experience design and cloud infrastructure.

===Joliot-Curie===

In June 2020, Atos, GENCI and CEA revealed the &quot;Joliot-Curie&quot; supercomputer which would help in academic and industrial open research.

=== Failed acquisition bid for DXC ===

In February 2021, Atos ended talks for a potential acquisition of DXC Technology. Atos has proposed for US$10 billion including debt for acquisition.

===Eviden===

In April 2023, Atos launched the Eviden brand ahead of a €5 billion carve-out. Following the launch of the brand, the main areas of focus for Atos were data centers and hosting, digital workplaces, unified communications and business process outsourcing. Eviden will focus on professional services and consulting, bringing together Atos&#x27; digital, big data and security divisions. However, this division has still not been approved by the board of directors in November 2023. As of August 2023, the Eviden brand remains a wholly owned subsidiary.

=== Financial difficulties ===
By early 2024, Atos was in financial difficulties. According to &quot;Le Monde&quot;, it had missed several sectoral shifts and &quot;made a series of poor strategic decisions until it imploded&quot;, prompting the biggest French collapse of the last five years. Atos faced being &quot;dismantled and wiped off the map&quot;, with its managed IT services division set to be acquired by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, and its cybersecurity and supercomputer expertise going to Airbus, leaving its digital consulting business to go to Onepoint. In April 2024, it reported total debts of almost €5 billion, and was exploring financial restructuring options to stabilise its finances; in May 2024, Atos was considering four competing bids to inject new money into the firm. The value of the company&#x27;s shares had dropped 97%, and it had had four chief executives in two years. In June, discussions about a rescue deal with a consortium led by its biggest shareholder, Onepoint, broke down and Atos began negotiations with bondholders about a new restructuring deal. On 4 July 2024, Atos announced a restructuring plan which involved conversion of about €2.8 billion of debt into equity, with creditors also contributing €233 million of new equity. It aimed to complete all restructuring operations by the end of 2024.

In October 2024, the French government planned to acquire Atos&#x27; advanced computing division for €500 million, potentially reaching €625 million with earn-outs. This deal aimed to protect strategic technologies and stabilize Atos amid financial challenges.

== Services and activities ==

=== Services ===
Atos activities are organized in four divisions: 
* &quot;Infrastructure &amp; Data Management&quot;: Datacenter management, service desk and unified communications;
* &quot;Business Applications &amp; Platform Solutions&quot;: consulting and systems integration;
* &quot;Big Data &amp; Cybersecurity&quot;: production of high-performance computers &amp; servers and cybersecurity;
* Previously: Worldline: e-commerce payment services and point of sale terminal applications

=== Geographies ===

==== United Kingdom ====
According to a National Audit Office report on the government&#x27;s four biggest suppliers, Atos earned £700 million in revenue from the public sector in the UK in 2012; of £7.2 billion sales worldwide. At that time, Atos held £3 billion worth of UK government contracts providing services to a wide range of organizations including NHS Scotland, Home Office, Welsh Government, the Ministry of Defence, Transport for Greater Manchester, the BBC, SLC and a multimillion outsourcing contract to NS&amp;I. In the United Kingdom, from 1998 to 2015, Atos&#x27; healthcare division operated the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)&#x27;s Work Capability Assessment.

== Controversy ==

=== Atos Healthcare ===

During its time operating the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) the company&#x27;s healthcare division, Atos Healthcare, faced extensive criticism over its practices. In August 2015, statistics from the DWP showed that 2,380 people had died between 2011 and 2014 soon after being found fit for work through disability benefit assessments. In 2014, &quot;the DWP negotiated an early exit from the existing WCA contract with the private firm, Atos, after raising concerns about the quality of its work&quot;. Nevertheless, in 2016 Atos was still undertaking work for the DWP in assessing Personal Independence Payment (PIP) applications. The Press Association said in 2017 that Atos, used by the DWP to make its decisions, were due to be paid more than £700m for their five-year contracts against an original estimate of £512m.

When Atos took over administering PIP, estimates of how fast claims could be processed were over-optimistic as were estimates of how easily claimants could get to assessment centres. This led to delays in assessments, distress to claimants and unexpectedly high costs. Atos was accused of misleading the government.

Atos developed a computer system that would extract data from GP&#x27;s computers nationwide. Costs rose from £14 million to £40 million and it was felt Atos had taken insufficient care how it spent taxpayers&#x27; money.

When Atos lost the contract for fitness to work tests, Richard Hawkes of Scope said, &quot;I doubt there&#x27;s a single disabled person who&#x27;ll be sorry to hear that Atos will no longer be running the fit-for-work tests.&quot; Hawkes claimed the &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; test should be &quot;more than an exercise in getting people off benefits. It should make sure disabled people get the specialist, tailored and flexible support they need to find and keep a job.&quot;

Mark Serwotka of Public and Commercial Services Union described the assessments as &quot;designed to harass vulnerable people and take their benefits away rather than provide support and guidance. Doctors, MPs and disabled people all believe the tests should be scrapped so, instead of replacing the failed Atos with another profit-hungry provider, the government should bring the work in-house and invest in it properly.&quot;

Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron questioned how Atos and Capita could have been paid over £500m from tax payers money for assessing fitness to work as 61% who appealed won their appeals. Farron stated, &quot;This adds to the suspicion that these companies are just driven by a profit motive, and the incentive is to get the assessments done, but not necessarily to get the assessments right. They are the ugly face of business.&quot;

In 2014, Atos Healthcare rebranded its occupational health business to become OH Assist. The Atos Healthcare brand was reserved for use for the PIP contract. Atos sold its OH Assist business to CBPE Capital in 2015.

For a number of years Atos denied claimants benefits or reduced their benefits if they did not take addictive opiate based pain killers. The Department for Work and Pensions subsequently revised its guidance stating, &quot;healthcare practitioners [disability benefits assessors] should be mindful that the level of analgesia used does not necessarily correlate with the level of pain&quot;.

=== Corporation tax ===
It was disclosed in November 2013 through the National Audit Office that Atos had paid no corporation tax at all in the UK in 2012. The total value of contracts that had been awarded to Atos by June 2013 was approximately £1.6 billion.

==Sponsorship==

===Olympic/Paralympic Games===
Atos has been the official IT partner for the Olympic Games since 2001 and is expected to continue until at least 2024. Atos, through the SchlumbergerSema&#x27;s acquisition, was involved in previous Games during the 1990s, starting with the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992. Atos has been one of 11 major sponsors for the Olympic Games since 2001.

In 2011, some UK-based disability campaign groups called for a boycott of the 2012 Summer Paralympics due to Atos&#x27; sponsorship of the games and Atos Healthcare&#x27;s UK contract to perform Work Capability Assessments on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). During the first week of the Paralympics in the summer of 2012, activists and disabled people targeted Atos in a series of nationwide protests. This culminated on Friday 31 August with a demonstration outside Atos headquarters in London, which ended in a confrontation with the police.

Through the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s TOP (The Olympic Partner) programme, Atos has sponsored athletes from all over the globe in order to support their Olympic ambitions, including Danny Crates, the 2004 Paralympic Champion in the 800m.

===2014 Commonwealth Games===
Atos was named as an official supporter of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. On 26 June 2013, &quot;Glasgow Against Atos&quot; occupied one of the Commonwealth Games venues in protest against Atos sponsorship.

===2015 Southeast Asian Games===
Atos was the official sponsor of 2015 Southeast Asian Games in Singapore.

=== 2018 European Championships ===
In February 2017 Atos was appointed as the first official sponsor of the Glasgow 2018 European Championships. The company has been awarded a £2.5 million contract for timing, scoring and results.

<text>White Trash Beautiful is the fourth solo studio album by American recording artist Everlast. It was released internationally on May 25, 2004 and a day later in the United States via Island Records. It has sold about 124,000 copies in the U.S.

The record peaked at number 12 on German music charts, at number 21 on the Swiss music charts, at number 32 on Ö3 Austria Top 40, at number 56 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and at number 124 on French music charts. The lead single of the album, &quot;White Trash Beautiful&quot;, was dropped in March 2004 and also has been charted, but only in three major European charts: number 42 in Switzerland, number 59 in Germany, and number 64 in Austria. The official music video features American actor Aaron Paul.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;White Trash Beautiful&quot; primarily mixes hip-hop tropes with arrangements built on bluesy strumming. Musically, Everlast and producer Dante Ross marry his gruff delivery with spare acoustic guitar layered in subdued hip-hop rhythms. The album features hip-hop references, including lyrical quotes, turntable scratches and explicit lines and bravado.

The album mainly blends country and blues into lyrical narratives of loneliness. Everlast uses a haggard voice for singing grim songs. He occasionally engages in rap clichés, with verses expressing street bravado and cynicism in addition to relationship issues and heartbreak.

<doc id="895303" wikidata="Q325201" url="?curid=895303" title="Harold Masursky">
<text>Harold (Hal) Masursky (December 23, 1922* – August 24, 1990) was an American astrogeologist.

After leaving Yale University without defending his dissertation, he started his career in the early 1950s as a field geologist in Wyoming and Colorado working for the United States Geological Survey (USGS). In the early 1960s, he moved to the Astrogeology division of the USGS and began working at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. In the mid-1960s, he moved to Flagstaff, Arizona as a founding planetary geologist at the newly constructed USGS Astrogeology Science Center. Throughout his professional career with the USGS, his work contributed to the mission of NASA in the areas of economic, structural, and planetary geology.

He was responsible for the investigation of planetary and lunar surfaces, especially in finding scientifically valuable landing places. This included for the Apollo program, where, in the 1960s, he played a major role in choosing landing sites and assisted in training astronauts in the basics of geology so they would know what to look for on the surface of the Moon. In the 1970s, he headed the team that mapped the surface of Mars and was once again involved in choosing landing sites, this time for the Mars Viking missions. In the 1980s, he worked with the Voyager program to explore the surfaces of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Masursky was a strong advocate for the exploration of Venus and he was a key member of Pioneer Venus Orbiter team. He worked on numerous other space missions and programs, including, for Moon exploration, Ranger, Surveyor, the Lunar Orbiter, and the mapping of Mars by Mariner 9, as well as contributing to the missions of the &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Magellan&quot; spacecraft. He was often interviewed on television as his enthusiasm for the planetary discoveries of the space missions was both edifying and infectious

An especially key role was his work as the president of the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). He created a small stir in 1986, when he was required to reject a popular suggestion that new moons of Uranus, discovered earlier that year, be named for the seven astronauts lost in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; explosion - the IAU has strict guidelines that prohibit major bodies being named in honor of persons from a particular country.

In 1985, Masursky was the recipient of the Distinguished Service Award, which is the highest honorary recognition an employee can receive within the Department of the Interior. Quoting from the award, the 1985 USGS Yearbook states: “Harold Masursky, Geologist, for his imaginative leadership in the field of astrogeology which has influenced almost every facet of lunar and planetary exploration since the beginning of the nation&#x27;s space program.”

The Masursky crater on Mars was chosen because it is effluvial, meaning &quot;flow&quot; (it looks like water ran through it), to honor his fervent belief that Mars once had flowing water on the surface. In 1981, the asteroid 2685 Masursky was discovered and named in his honor. The Masursky Award for Meritorius Service to Planetary Science, first awarded to Carl Sagan in 1991, and the Masursky Lecture, originating in 1992 and given during the annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC), are named for him as well.

Upon his death in Flagstaff, Arizona, he was buried in the city&#x27;s Citizens Cemetery.

*Note there is some confusion about the year of Harold Masursky&#x27;s birth; in some places it is reported as 1922 and in some places is reported as 1923.

<doc id="895308" wikidata="Q5963134" url="?curid=895308" title="Hälsinge Regiment">
<text>The Hälsinge Regiment (), designations I 14, I 14/Fo 49 and I 14/Fo 21, was a Swedish Army infantry regiment that traced its origins back to the 16th century. It was disbanded in 1997. The regiment&#x27;s soldiers were originally recruited from the provinces of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, and it was later garrisoned in Gästrikland.

==History==
The regiment has its origins in fänikor (companies) raised in Hälsingland and Gästrikland in the 1550s and 1560s. In 1615, these units—along with fänikor from the nearby provinces of Medelpad, Ångermanland and Västerbotten—were organised by Gustav II Adolf into Norrlands storregemente, of which eleven of the total 24 companies were recruited in Hälsingland and Gästrikland. Norrlands storregemente consisted of three field regiments, of which Hälsinge Regiment was one. Sometime around 1624, the grand regiment was permanently split into three smaller regiments, of which Hälsinge Regiment was one.

The regiment was officially raised in 1630 although it had existed since 1624. Hälsinge Regiment was one of the original 20 Swedish infantry regiments mentioned in the Swedish constitution of 1634. The regiment was also called Joakim Brahe&#x27;s Regiment after its first commander Joakim Brahe. It was allotted in 1682 as the second Swedish regiment to be so, after Dalarna Regiment.

The regiment was given the designation I 14 (14th Infantry Regiment) in a general order in 1816. Hälsinge Regiment was garrisoned in Gävle from 1909. In 1973, the regiment gained the new designation I 14/Fo 49 as a consequence of a merge with the local defence area Fo 49. When the local defence area changed designation to Fo 21 in 1982, the designation changed to I 14/Fo 21. The regiment was disbanded in 1997, and the barracks that had been refurbished in 1995–1996 were turned into a college campus for the University College of Gävle.

==Heraldry and traditions==

===Colours, standards and guidons===
The regiment have carried a number of colour over the years. In 1897, King Oscar II presented a new colour to the two battalions of the regiment, which then replaced the 1850 colour. On 29 September 1952, the 1897 colour was replaced when the regiment was presented with a new colour in Gävle by His Majesty the King Gustaf VI Adolf. It was used as regimental colour by I 14/Fo 21 until 1 January 1998. The new colour was similar to the 1850 colour. It was white and black, which is also the regimental colour, and taken from Hälsingland (black) and Gästrikland (white). The colour is drawn by Brita Grep. It has not been possible to discover who has manufactured the colour. It is embroidered by hand in insertion technique. Blazon: &quot;On cloth per saltire black and white the provincial badge of Hälsingland; a rampant yellow buck, armed red. On a yellow border at the upper side of the colour, battle honours (Novgorod 1611, Warszawa 1656, Fredriksodde 1657, Tåget över Bält 1658, Lund 1676, Landskrona 1677, Narva 1700, Düna 1701, Jakobstadt 1704, Gemäuerthof 1705, Malatitze 1708, Gadebusch 1712) in black&quot;.

<doc id="895309" wikidata="Q2494128" url="?curid=895309" title="HMAS Adelaide (FFG 01)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Adelaide&quot; (FFG 01) was the lead ship of the of guided missile frigates built for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), based on the United States Navy&#x27;s s. She was built in the United States and commissioned into the RAN in 1980.

During her career, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was part of Australian responses or contributions to the 1987 Fijian coups d&#x27;état, the Iraq invasion of Kuwait, the Indonesian riots of May 1998, the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce, the War in Afghanistan, and the United States-led invasion of Iraq. In 1997, the frigate rescued two competitors in the 1996–97 Vendée Globe solo, round-the-world yacht race. In 2001, a boat carrying suspected illegal immigrants was intercepted by &quot;Adelaide&quot;; the events of this interception became the centre of the Children overboard affair.

In 2008, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was the second ship of the class to be decommissioned, in order to offset the cost of an upgrade to the other four vessels. This ship was to be sunk off Avoca Beach, New South Wales as a dive wreck on 27 March 2010, until an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by protest groups led to a postponement of the scuttling until additional cleanup work was completed. Despite further attempts to delay or cancel the scuttling, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was sunk off Avoca on 13 April 2011.

==Design and construction==

Following the cancellation of the Australian light destroyer project in 1973, the British Type 42 destroyer and the American were identified as alternatives to replace the cancelled light destroyers and the s. Although the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class was still at the design stage, the difficulty of fitting the Type 42 with the SM-1 missile, and the success of the acquisition (a derivative of the American ) compared to equivalent British designs led the Australian government to approve the purchase of two US-built &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates (including &quot;Adelaide&quot;) in 1976. A third was ordered in 1977, followed by a fourth, with all four ships integrated into the USN&#x27;s shipbuilding program. A further two ships were ordered in 1980, and were constructed in Australia.

As designed, the ship had a full load displacement of 3,605 tons, a length overall of , a beam of , and a draught of . Early in the ship&#x27;s career, she was modified from the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; Flight I design to Flight III, requiring a lengthening of the helicopter deck for the RAST helicopter recovery system, increasing the displacement to 4,100 tons and pushing the overall length to . Propulsion machinery consisted of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, which provided a combined to the single propeller shaft. Top speed was , with a range of at . Two electric auxiliary propulsors were used for close manoeuvring, with a top speed of . The standard ship&#x27;s company was 184, including 15 officers, but excluding the flight crew for the embarked helicopters.
The original armament for the ship consisted of a Mark 13 missile launcher configured to fire RIM-66 Standard and RGM-84 Harpoon missiles, supplemented by an OTO Melara gun and a Vulcan Phalanx point-defence system. For anti-submarine warfare, two Mark 32 torpedo tube sets were fitted; originally firing the Mark 44 torpedo, the &quot;Adelaide&quot;s later carried the Mark 46 torpedoes. Up to six machine guns were carried for close-in defence, and beginning in 2005, two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts were installed when needed for Persian Gulf deployments. The sensor suite included an AN/SPS-49 air search radar, AN/SPS-55 surface search and navigation radar, SPG-60 fire control radar connected to a Mark 92 fire control system, and an AN/SQS-56 hull-mounted sonar. Two helicopters could be embarked: either two S-70B Seahawk or one Seahawk and one AS350B Squirrel.

&quot;Adelaide&quot; was laid down to the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class&#x27; Flight I design at Todd Pacific Shipyards at Seattle on 29 July 1977, launched on 21 June 1978 by Lady Ann Synnot (wife of Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot), and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy on 15 November 1980. During construction, she was identified with the United States Navy hull number FFG-17. A total of four &quot;Adelaide&quot;-class ships were constructed by Todd Pacific, with a further two built by Australian shipbuilder AMECON.

==Operational history==
After commissioning, &quot;Adelaide&quot; and &quot;Canberra&quot; remained in the United States to work up; during this time both ships were attached to the United States Navy&#x27;s Destroyer Squadron 9. The frigate ran aground off Seattle in early 1981, during post-commissioning trials, but was freed with only minor damage.

Following the decommissioning of the aircraft carrier in 1982 and the disbandment of fixed-wing aviation squadrons in 1984, the RAN Fleet Air Arm became focused on helicopter operations, but had minimal experience flying helicopters from small ships. To remedy this, a Bell Kiowa was embarked aboard &quot;Adelaide&quot; during 1984. &quot;Adelaide&quot; was awarded the Gloucester Cup for being the most efficient ship in the RAN during 1984.

In May 1987, &quot;Adelaide&quot; visited Fiji, and was alongside in Lautoka when the first of the 1987 Fijian coups d&#x27;état occurred on 14 May. &quot;Adelaide&quot; and sister ship , alongside in Suva, were instructed to remain off Fiji to aid in any necessary evacuation of Australian citizens; the first component of what became Operation Morris Dance. &quot;Adelaide&quot; remained on station until at least 29 May, when a phased withdrawal began.

On 3 July 1990, &quot;Adelaide&quot; became the first Australian warship to visit Tahiti since 1970. On 10 August, &quot;Adelaide&quot;, sister ship , and the replenishment ship were deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Damask, Australia&#x27;s participation in the international coalition enforcing sanctions against Iraq following that nation&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait. &quot;Adelaide&quot; and &quot;Darwin&quot; remained in the area until 3 December, and was used for surveillance and boarding operations. In October 1992, &quot;Adelaide&quot; home port was changed to , making her the first ship of the class homeported in Western Australia under the Two-Ocean Policy.
In January 1997, the yachts of Thierry Dubois and Tony Bullimore (competitors in the 1996–97 Vendée Globe solo, round-the-world yacht race), capsized while attempting to cross the Southern Ocean. &quot;Adelaide&quot; successfully found and rescued the sailors after seven days of searching by ships and aircraft. During late May and early June, the frigate was deployed to the Philippines, and represented Australia at the Philippines Centenary International Naval Review.

Between 17 and 27 May 1998, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was one of four RAN ships placed on standby, in case Australian citizens required evacuation if the Indonesian riots of May 1998 escalated. The ships were not used. Starting in September, the frigate accompanied the destroyers and on a cruise through South East Asia. During this deployment, the ships were present at a naval review by Indonesian president B. J. Habibie.

In February 1999, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup awarded to the most efficient ship in the RAN during the previous year. The frigate was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 19 September to 19 October.

On 6 October 2001, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was the ship which intercepted SIEV 4, the event which sparked the Children overboard affair. Under orders to prevent SIEVs from entering Australian waters, &quot;Adelaide&quot; attempted to warn the craft, carrying over 200 passengers (including children), against crossing from international waters during the night and into 7 October. When the SIEV failed to heed these warnings, &quot;Adelaide&quot; fired warning shots and initiated a RHIB boarding action, with the boarding party took control of the craft that afternoon. Between this time and when the craft was manoeuvred from Australian territory late the next morning, several attempts were made to sabotage the craft, and some adult passengers jumped or were thrown overboard while others threatened to do so; the fourteen people that entered the water were recovered by the frigate&#x27;s RHIB and taken back to the SIEV. &quot;Adelaide&quot; observed the craft as it headed towards Indonesia, and moved in to provide further assistance a few hours later, after systematic sabotage immobilised the small vessel. &quot;Adelaide&quot; was instructed to take the vessel in tow and head for Christmas Island. The SIEV began to take on water during the afternoon of 8 October, and despite the appearance that the problem had been rectified, the craft sank without warning at 17:00. All aboard were forced into the water, and were rescued by personnel from &quot;Adelaide&quot;. Reports of the sinking were conflated with information about those who jumped or were thrown overboard the day previous to give the impression that the threat of throwing children overboard had been made or carried out, a story that was later proven false but taken up at the time by the Howard government during the lead-up to the 2001 election to support their campaign promises to tighten border controls and immigration.

From November 2001 to March 2002, &quot;Adelaide&quot; and the amphibious warfare ship were deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Slipper, the Australian contribution to the War in Afghanistan. The ships also contributed to the continuing enforcement of the Iraq sanctions. &quot;Adelaide&quot; was deployed on border protection operations on multiple occasions until 2004.

&quot;Adelaide&quot; returned to the Middle East from July 2004 to January 2005 as part of Operation Catalyst, the Australian contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq following the United States-led invasion in 2003. During this deployment, in December 2004, several gunboats of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard attempted to capture a boarding party after it had inspected the freighter MV &quot;Sham&quot;, which had grounded near the Iraq-Iran maritime boundary. After completing their inspection, the boarding party returned to their two RHIBs, but were approached by an Iranian gunboat. The boarding party climbed back aboard &quot;Sham&quot;, took up defensive positions, and, according to BBC reporter Frank Gardner, &quot;warned [the Iranians] to back off, using what was said to be &#x27;highly colourful language&#x27;.&quot; During the next 45 minutes, four more gunboats arrived, and the stand-off lasted for four hours before the Australians were evacuated by &quot;Adelaide&quot;″s Seahawk helicopter. No shots were fired during the incident, and two of the Australians were later awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their conduct during the stand-off. The Australian Defence Force did not immediately report the incident to the media, as they felt no need to highlight it, and the attempted capture did not come to light until July 2007, when Gardner wrote about it following the capture of 15 British personnel during a similar incident in March 2007.

A March 2010 reorganisation of battle honours awarded to RAN ships saw &quot;Adelaide&quot; retroactively honoured for her service with INTERFET (&quot;East Timor 1999&quot;) and during the War in Afghanistan (&quot;Persian Gulf 2001–02&quot;).

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Adelaide&quot; was originally scheduled to be paid off in November 2006, but delays with the project to upgrade four of &quot;Adelaide&quot;″s sister ships required that she be kept in service for another fourteen months to minimise the impact on the fleet. &quot;Adelaide&quot; was decommissioned on 19 January 2008 at , before she was towed to Sydney and given to the New South Wales Government, which planned to sink her as a dive wreck off the coast near Terrigal: the first military ship dive wreck in New South Wales. After spending time alongside at , &quot;Adelaide&quot; was towed to White Bay at a point prior to November 2009.
The ship was prepared for scuttling during late 2009 and early 2010: her mast (which would have become a navigational hazard once the ship was scuttled) was removed, dangerous materials and toxins were removed, and access holes were cut in the ship&#x27;s flanks. The ship was scheduled to be sunk on 27 March, offshore from Avoca Beach, New South Wales, in of water. Local resident action groups campaigned to prevent the scuttling, claiming that the wreck would affect tides and littoral sand drift, and that the removal of chemicals and hazardous materials in the ship had not been thorough enough, with the chance that marine life and people could be poisoned.

An appeal by the protest groups to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal three days before the sinking saw the project placed on hold until the case could be heard in full: supporters and opponents of the dive wreck agreed to participate in mediation in the meantime. The case was to be heard on 5 May, but was later postponed to July. On 15 September, the Tribunal ruled that scuttling of the ship could go ahead after the removal of any remaining wiring, which may contain polychlorinated biphenyls, canvas, insulation, and exfoliating red lead paint. The delays caused by the tribunal hearing meant that the original $5.8 million assigned to the scuttling project was expended, and the tribunal hearing, additional cleanup, and berthing fees brought the cost of the scuttling project to $8.5 million.
A new scuttling date was announced on 24 February 2011 by NSW Lands Minister Tony Kelly, with &quot;Adelaide&quot; scheduled to be sunk on 13 April 2011, after the additional cleaning ordered by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was completed in March. &quot;Adelaide&quot; was towed from Sydney Harbour on the morning of 11 April for the voyage north. The action group attempted to cancel or further delay the sinking of the warship, requesting that the New South Wales Ombudsman investigate the government&#x27;s handling of the artificial reef project, filing a summons in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales on the afternoon of 12 April, and asking an Aboriginal &#x27;whale caller&#x27; to summon humpback whales to the planned wreck site. Despite this, the sinking went ahead just before midday on 13 April, after being delayed by over an hour by a pod of dolphins inside the exclusion zone. After the scuttling charges were fired, &quot;Adelaide&quot; submerged within two minutes.

As an artificial reef, the aluminum superstructure of the ship has suffered galvanic corrosion. With the superstructure weakened, a storm and heavy seas in 2024 removed the superstructure from the vessel and deposited it on the seabed on the port side of the vessel.

<text>In the Inuit religion, an ijiraq ( or ) is a shapeshifting creature said to kidnap children, hide them away and abandon them. The inuksuk (or inukshuk) of stone allow these children to find their way back if they can convince the ijiraq to let them go.

== Description ==
In North Baffin dialects &quot;ijiraq&quot; means Shape Shifter. While &quot;Tariaksuq&quot; appear like a half-man-half-caribou monster, an ijiraq can appear in any form it chooses, making it particularly deceptive. Their eyes will always stay red, no matter what they shapeshift into. Their real form is just like a human, but their eyes and mouth are sideways. &quot;(The book of Dutch writer Floortje Zwigtman says only the shaman knows the real form of the Ijiraq).&quot; When you are hunting somewhere that Ijirait (plural) inhabit, you will see them in the corner of your eye for a fleeting moment (like tariaksuq, shadow people) &quot;(following another reference, you see a strange caribou in the corner of your eye instead of a normal shadow&quot;). If you try to observe them directly however, they are completely elusive. They are sometimes helpful, sometimes fatally deceptive.

== Freeman&#x27;s Cove ==
One of the most noted places in the Arctic for sightings of these shape shifters (and tariaksuq) is the Freeman&#x27;s Cove area of Tuktusirvik (place to hunt caribou), Bathurst Island. This rich oasis is surrounded in a horseshoe pattern by dormant volcanic mountains. Historically, Freeman&#x27;s Cove is most notable as a stopover for the ship the &quot;Intrepid&quot; on an Arctic expedition with Edward Belcher.

== Story ==
The Ijirait are said to inhabit a place between two worlds; not quite inside this one, nor quite out of it. Inuit further south than the North Baffin group used to hold to a belief that some Inuit went too far north in the chase for game, and became trapped between the world of the dead and the world of the living, and thus became the Ijirait. According to the small handful of surviving elders in the South Baffin Region that knew these beliefs, the Inuit that are settled in Resolute and Grise Fiord are these shape shifters or shadow people, because they went too far north. Some elders will avoid being in presence of extreme-northern Inuit, fearing they are evil Ijirait or Tariaksuq.

The home of the Ijirait is said to be cursed, and one will lose their way, no matter how skilled or familiar with the land.

== Scientific understanding ==
One plausible explanation for this unusual phenomenon is likely related to large deposits of sour gas, of which can be disturbed by simply walking over top of the pockets, causing them to expel the toxic gas hydrogen sulphide. Exposure to hydrogen sulphide is known to cause hallucinations and memory loss. Gas and sulphur smoke have been reported in the area as well as hot water springs discovered by the Amarualik (meaning wolf-like) family; all of which could cause a &quot;mirage&quot; causing the traveller to see things such as Ijirait and Tariaksuq. The gas vapour or pockets low in oxygen could also account for hallucinations/sensations of being watched.
