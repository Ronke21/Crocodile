<text>Shark&#x27;s fin soup is a soup or stewed dish served in parts of China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. The shark fins provide texture, while the taste comes from the other ingredients. It is commonly served at special occasions such as weddings and banquets, or as a luxury item.

It has been condemned by the Humane Society International, which states that approximately 72 million sharks are killed each year for their fins. Currently, international concerns over the sustainability and welfare of sharks have impacted consumption and availability of the soup worldwide. Recently, health concerns about the high concentration of BMAA in shark fins have arisen.

Shark fin soup substitutes have lately appeared on the market which do not require any shark fins, thus avoiding the environmental damage caused by the shark finning practice.

==Preparation==
Traditional shark fin soup or stew is made with fins obtained from a variety of shark species. Raw fins are processed by first removing the skin and denticles before trimming them into shapes and bleaching to a more desirable coloration.

Sharks&#x27; fins are sold dried, cooked, wet, and frozen. Ready-to-eat shark fin soup is also readily available in Asian markets.

Dried fins come in cooked and skinned (shredded) and raw and unskinned (whole), the latter requiring more preparation. Both need to be softened before they can be used to prepare soup.

==Taste==
The taste of the soup comes from the broth, as the fins themselves are almost tasteless. Rather than for taste, the fins are used for their &quot;snappy, gelatinous&quot; texture, which has been described as &quot;chewy, sinewy, stringy&quot;. Krista Mahr of &quot;Time&quot; called it &quot;somewhere between chewy and crunchy&quot;.

==Health impact==

Shark fins are believed in Chinese culture to have properties of boosting sexual potency, enhancing skin quality, increasing &quot;qi&quot; or energy, preventing heart disease, and lowering cholesterol. In traditional Chinese medicine, shark fins are believed to help in areas of rejuvenation, appetite enhancement, and blood nourishment and to be beneficial to vital energy, kidneys, lungs, bones, and many other parts of the body.

There are claims that shark fins prevent cancer; however, there is no scientific evidence, and one study found shark cartilage generally to be of no value in cancer treatment. Furthermore, there is no scientific evidence that shark fins can be used to treat any medical condition. Sharks biomagnify toxins, so eating shark meat may raise the risk of dementia and mercury poisoning.

WildAid, a wildlife non-governmental organization, warned that eating too much shark fin can cause sterility in men. It is known that larger fish such as shark, tuna, and swordfish contain high levels of mercury and methylmercury salts. For nursing mothers, young children, and pregnant women or those who wish to be, the United States Food and Drug Administration has advised avoiding consumption of fish high in mercury.

High concentrations of BMAA are present in shark fins. Because BMAA is a neurotoxin, consumption of shark fin soup and cartilage pills may pose a risk for degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s and ALS, as well as Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Counterfeit shark fins often also contain toxins.

==Market and demand==
===Early use===
Shark fin soup was reported in Ming dynasty writings and by the Qing dynasty was considered a &quot;traditional part of formal banquets&quot;; in Chinese cuisine, it was considered to be one of the eight treasured foods from the sea. It was popular with Chinese emperors because it was rare, and tasty only after a complicated and elaborate preparation. By the time of the Qing dynasty, shark fin soup was in high demand. Its manual of cuisine, the Suiyuan shidan, indicates that the shark fin was eaten as soup, stew, and even as a stir-fry, but in all cases the fin had to be boiled for two days.

The popularity of shark fin soup rose in the late-18th and early-19th centuries as standards of living began to improve.

===Demand peaks, c. 2000===
In the late-20th century, shark fin soup was a popular delicacy in China, and was eaten in Chinese restaurants around the world. The increasing wealth of the middle class raised demand. The shark fin trade more than doubled between 1985 and 2001.

Based on information gathered from the Hong Kong trade in fins, the market was estimated in 2004 to be growing by five percent each year. Consumption of shark fin soup had risen dramatically with the affluence of the middle class, as Chinese communities around the world enjoyed increasing income levels. The high price of the soup meant it was often used as a way to impress guests, or for celebrations such as weddings, banquets, and important business deals. It was used to communicate wealth, power, and prestige, as it was believed to show respect, honor, and appreciation to guests as well as to intimidate them as the serving of such a dish often implies that the host is willing to use cruelty and brutality to achieve their goals, with 58% of those questioned in the WWF survey indicating they ate the soup at a celebration or gathering.

In Hong Kong restaurants, where the market had been strong, demand from Hong Kong natives had reportedly dropped in 2006. This was more than balanced by an increase in demand from the Chinese mainland, where economic growth put the expensive delicacy within the reach of an expanding middle class.

A survey carried out in China in 2006 by WildAid and the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Association found that 35% of participants said they had consumed shark fin soup in the last year, while 83% of participants in an online survey conducted by the World Wide Fund for Nature said that they had consumed shark fin soup at some time.

===Changes in demand, 2005–present===
The movement against shark fin soup began in 2006, when WildAid enlisted Chinese basketball star Yao Ming as spokesperson for a public relations campaign against the dish. The campaign was taken up by a coalition of Chinese businessmen, celebrities, and students. Businessman-turned-environmentalist Jim Zhang helped to raise concern within China&#x27;s government, which pledged in 2012 to ban shark fin soup from official banquets within three years.

In January 2013, &quot;China Daily&quot; reported that officials in Zhejiang province found that many shark fin soup restaurants were selling artificial shark fins, and that one-third of the samples that the officials had obtained contained dangerous amounts of cadmium and methylmercury. Within two months of the &quot;China Daily&quot; report, China ordered officials throughout the country to stop serving dishes made from protected wildlife at official banquets, and the Hong Kong government issued a similar order in September.

Consumption of shark fin soup in China has decreased. China&#x27;s Ministry of Commerce indicated that consumption of shark fin soup during the 2013 spring break holiday had decreased by 50–70% from 2012, and Hong Kong industry groups reported that shark fin imports were down by 20–30% from 2012. Also, anecdotal evidence points to a worldwide drop in shark fin prices and a move away from shark fishing in parts of Africa. Shark fin soup has often been replaced by dishes featuring sea cucumbers.

In Hong Kong, a 2016 poll from the City University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Shark Foundation had 75% of local respondents saying they were &quot;neutral&quot; towards the soup at banquets, while 90% of respondents said they would eat the dish if served to them, with the most popular justifications being to &quot;avoid food waste&quot; or to &quot;show respect for their host&quot;.

A 2018 WildAid report mentioned Thailand as an emerging market for shark fin soup, citing a 2017 survey where 57% of urban Thai respondents consumed the dish, most commonly at weddings, restaurants, and business meetings.

==Ethical and environmental concerns==

Shark fins used in the soup are the cartilaginous dorsal, pectoral and caudal fins. These are regularly harvested by a process known as shark finning, which takes only the fins and discards the carcass, alive or dead. Overfishing poses a major threat to the world&#x27;s shark populations.

Some groups, such as Fins Attached, Shark Savers, IUCN, Shark Angels, Shark Whisperer and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, discourage consumption of the soup due to concerns with the world&#x27;s shark population and how sharks are inhumanely finned alive and returned to the ocean, unable to swim, hunt or survive. The prevalence of shark finning and the sustainability of shark species are both debated. As of 2011, major hotel operators such as Marriott International, The Peninsula Hotels and Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts stopped serving shark fin soup in favor of offering sustainable seafood. The largest supermarket chains in SingaporeCold Storage and NTUC FairPricehave stopped selling shark fins, citing sustainability concerns. Hong Kong Disneyland dropped the soup from its menu after it could not find a sustainable source.

Malaysia&#x27;s Natural Resources and Environment Ministry banned shark fin soup from official functions in a commitment to the Malaysian Nature Society to conserve the shark species.

In the United States, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have banned the sale and possession of shark fins, effectively eliminating the availability of the soup. Illinois, which had been a large importer of shark fins, was the fifth U.S. state, and the first non-Pacific state, to implement a ban on shark fin trade. In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act, closing loopholes used to obtain shark fins. In October 2011, California governor Jerry Brown, citing the cruelty of finning and potential threats to the environment and commercial fishing, signed Assembly Bill 376, banning the possession and sale of detached shark fins. Two Chinese American groups challenged the law in federal court, arguing among other things that it was discriminatory against the Chinese-American community. The federal courts rejected these claims.

In Canada, the Vancouver city council decided to work towards creating a ban to preserve shark species. Toronto joined other regional municipalities in adopting a shark fin ban on 13 October 2011. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice overturned the Toronto bylaw, as it was outside the powers of the city. Calgary banned shark fin soup on 16 July 2012, but in May 2013 shelved the bylaw indefinitely.

On 2 July 2012, the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China declared that shark fin soup can no longer be served at official banquets. This ban may take up to three years to take effect because of the social significance of the dish in Chinese culture.

The marine conservation organization Bite-Back has campaigned against the sale of shark fin soup in Britain. On the back of its campaigning, the London-based Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant Hakkasan agreed to stop selling the soup. High-profile names such as Gordon Ramsay, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, and Charles Clover, author of &quot;The End of the Line: How Overfishing Is Changing the World and What We Eat&quot;, have lent their support to the charity&#x27;s &#x27;Hacked Off&#x27; campaign. In 2019, environmental NGO WildAid partnered with Plan B Media on a public awareness campaign to discourage sharkfin soup consumption in Taiwan.

==Imitation shark fin soup==

Imitation shark fin soup is a noodle soup often sold in small bowls by street vendors in Hong Kong, where it is a common street snack. It is a more ethical and affordable substitute for shark fin soup.

A popular, low-cost imitation shark fin soup (碗仔翅) made using vermicelli is widely available in Asia. They can also be made from cellophane noodles. Seafood companies in Asia later developed edible gelatinous products to imitate shark fins&#x27; qualities, commonly referred as &quot;imitation shark fins&quot;.

===Imitation shark fins===
Substitutes for shark include imitation shark fin, konjac gel, various forms of noodles, and others. &quot;Mock shark&#x27;s fin&quot; soup appeared in Hong Kong during the 1970s. From the 1990s onward, it became popular in restaurants throughout China. The shark fin is replaced with an imitation and edible mushrooms, kelps, seaweeds, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and beaten eggs are added, as in the traditional soup.

Imitation shark fin (素翅), typically from Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, is known as &quot;sùchì&quot; in Chinese Mandarin and &quot;sou ci&quot; in Chinese Cantonese, literally means &quot;vegetarian fin&quot;. A Taiwanese manufacturer&#x27;s recipe for it contains water, gelatin, alginic acid, sugar, casein, and triolein to reproduce the chewy, gelatinous texture of shark fins. However, some of these imitations absorb the broth more quickly than the real shark fin. Konjac gel (known as &quot;moyu tofu&quot; in Chinese Mandarin, &quot;mo wu dau fu&quot; in Chinese Cantonese, and &quot;konnyaku&quot; in Japanese) can also be used as a substitute for shark fin once it is julienned into thin strands using a chef&#x27;s knife, produce slicer, or food processor. While cellophane noodles are also often used as an alternative to shark fins, some cooks find them too soft and unable to withstand simmering long enough for flavors to be absorbed, consequently the imitation shark fin or julienned konjac gel are more desirable. Other substitutes include &quot;Cucurbita ficifolia&quot; (shark fin melon, shark fin soup squash), chicken breast, jinhua ham, vermicelli, soy, sea cucumber, bird&#x27;s nest, pig&#x27;s skin and gelatin.

In 2015, a seafood company from San Francisco was working on a variation of imitation shark fin using algae-derived ingredients and recombinant proteins.

Alternatives to shark fin are inexpensive and easier to prepare. Imitation shark fin, konjac gel, and other alternatives can be purchased in preserved form from Asian supermarkets and convenience stores.

===History===
Imitation shark fin soup originated from Temple Street in Hong Kong during the 1950s and 1960s. Few people at that time could afford genuine shark fin soup, but street vendors collected the broken parts of shark fins discarded by Chinese restaurants and cooked them with mushrooms, egg, and pork, as well as soy sauce and other ingredients. The mixture, which was cooked into a soup, was served in a small bowl. Although this soup was inexpensive and lacked the authentic flavor, since it was cheap, tasty and contained many ingredients, it was popular among the poor and became one of the famous street snacks of Hong Kong.

Apart from the street vendor version, imitation shark fin soup may also be found in fast-food stores and expensive Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong, and also on mainland China. Since April 2016, Cup Noodles released various instant imitation shark fin ramen soups.

===Controversy===
False descriptions of goods and services are prohibited by the Trade Descriptions Ordinance in Hong Kong. Thus, imitation shark fin soup may have to change its Cantonese name since &quot;wun tsai chi&quot; (碗仔翅, ) may mislead customers into thinking there is real shark fin in it. However, many argue against this new policy; some claim that the name is tied to the Hong Kong people&#x27;s collective memories and culture, representing the history of old Hong Kong. It would also be inconvenient for tourists seeking the dish. Opponents of the name change suggest the government should consider whether customers are misled before carrying out the policy.

<text>Vetranio (died ) was briefly an imperial usurper and emperor in the Roman Empire in 350, during which time he controlled Illyricum between the rival emperors Magnus Magnentius and Constantius II, eventually capitulating to the latter.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life ===
Vetranio was born in the Roman province of Moesia to low-born parents, sometime in the late 3rd century. His early professions are unknown, but it is evident that at some point he joined the military and must have greatly distinguished himself to rise through the ranks to the army&#x27;s highest office, &quot;magister militum&quot;, by emperor Constans, despite being uneducated and unconnected.

He had held this command for a long period of time, and by 350 was considered an officer of both popularity and experience. In early 350, the commander of the famed &quot;Ioviani&quot; and &quot;Herculiani&quot; units, Magnus Magnentius, rose in rebellion and had Constans assassinated and himself crowned as emperor. He quickly asserted control of the western territories, but stopped at the border of Vetranio&#x27;s province, Illyricum. Three months later, Vetranio is declared emperor by his soldiers. The exact nature of these and ensuing events, and the question of why Vetranio was declared emperor has puzzled recent historians.

Early historians, such as Edward Gibbon and Otto Seeck, following the account of ancient historian Philostorgius, proposed the idea that after the murder of Constans, Constantina, his sister and the daughter of Constantine the Great, asked the aged Vetranio to assume the purple, which he did on 1 March. She most likely thought Vetranio could protect her family and herself against the usurper, and merely hoped to secure his fidelity, though Edward Gibbon credits her notoriously unscrupulous ambition for the scheme, suggesting interested motives on her part. As a member of the imperial family and potentially an Augusta herself, Constantina could have potentially acted as the &quot;auctor&quot; of imperial authority and legitimately given Vetranio the imperial position. In any case, Constantius II was then embroiled in a dangerous struggle with Shapur II, the king of the Sasanian Empire. Constantina may have doubted her brother&#x27;s abilities.

Recently, this story has been revised by taking a more comprehensive look at a broader range of source material. John Drinkwater points out that because Magnentius extended his territorial control only as far as northern Italy and ceased expanding well before Vetranio was declared emperor, Vetranio’s rebellion was not done out of an immediate pressure to keep Magnentius out of Illyricum to secure it for Constantina or Constantius, and was therefore as much a rebellion against Constantius as it was against Magnentius. Drinkwater still argues that ultimately Vetranio remained loyal to the Constantinian dynasty, and this idea is shared by Alan Dearn, who looked at the numismatic (coin) evidence, and Andrastos Omissi. However, these loyalist theories are ultimately unable to adequately explain why Vetranio needed to be usurp imperial authority at all. Although he was not actually a &quot;magister militum&quot; under Constantius, having been promoted by Constans, it still would have been a much safer course of action for himself, and everyone else involved in the undertaking, if he simply remained a &quot;magister militum&quot; and declared his loyalty for Constantius. Such was the choice made in 361 by Lucillianus, the &quot;magister militum&quot; in Sirmium, potentially the exact same city in which Vetranio was raised to the purple. Facing down the approaching armies of the usurper Julian, Lucillianus remained a loyal general of Constantius. No counter-rebellion was necessary. Thus there is no good explanation for why Vetranio usurped imperial power in 350, other than his own ambition.

=== Emperor ===

Vetranio accepted the purple, and coins were minted in his name, showing the title of Augustus (full emperor), rather than Caesar, and the coins indicated that he expected to rule for five years, and hoped for ten. Understandings for the sequence of events, and the real motivations behind them, again hinge on whether one believes Vetranio was a Constantinian loyalist or a self-interested usurper. It is clear that Vetranio liaised with Constantius and received some sort of approval and support from him - according to Philostorgius, Constantius sent Vetranio a diadem, and Julian reports that Constantius supported him with money and troops - but then Vetranio also developed a relationship with Magnentius. The older understanding of this development is that Vetranio feared an attack from Magnentius, but as described above, Magnentius intentionally stopped short of Illyricum and made no additional threats to the area, so Vetranio can hardly have felt in danger. 

Both Vetranio and Magnentius put images of Constantius on their coins and not each other, indicating that they hoped to gain his respect more than the other&#x27;s. Eventually, Constantius left from the eastern frontier with a large army, and met with ambassadors from both rebel emperors at Heraclea in Thrace. They offered him the senior title in the Empire, and Magnentius proposed to wed his daughter to Constantius, himself to marry Constantina the emperor&#x27;s sister. But they required that the emperor ratify their claims to the western provinces. Constantius, supposedly inspired by his father Constantine in a nocturnal vision, indignantly declined the offer.

The first rebel Constantius needed to deal with was Vetranio. He had occupied the Succi Pass, an important and defensible thoroughfare on the &quot;Via Militaris&quot;, close to Serdica. This was the main road on which Constantius must proceed westwards. It is not exactly clear what occurred at the Succi Pass - those who believe Vetranio was loyal to Constantius argue that Vetranio had already organised his eventual surrender to Constantius, but some primary sources indicate that Vetranio was betrayed by his Praetorian Prefect, Vulcacius Rufinus, who was the envoy who met Constantius at Heraclea, as well as by the officer Gomoarius, who was perhaps in charge of Vetranio&#x27;s defences at Succi.

If this was not his own secret plan, Vetranio must have now realised his position was untenable. He had lost his best defensive position, most likely a large portion of his army along with its senior officers, and was facing a much larger and more experienced eastern field army. Vetranio&#x27;s and Constantius&#x27; forces met at Serdica under a truce, and then they proceeded to Naissus together. If it had not been negotiated already, there can be no doubt that on this march the emperor and rebel reconciled, while Constantius&#x27; agents distributed bribes amongst the armies to ensure their loyalty to Constantius. Then, at Naissus, on 25 December 350, in a contrived scene the two emperors mounted a tribunal to address the assembled legions; Constantius succeeded, by means of a strong speech, in which he invoked the glories of the house of Constantine I, to have the Illyrian legions acclaim him sole emperor. Most likely in a pre-planned show, Vetranio threw himself on the ground and begged Constantius&#x27; clemency. The emperor gently raised the aged general by the hand, honoring him with the name of father, and gave him instant pardon.

=== Later life and death ===
Later he was dismissed in peace. Though dismissed from his command, he was allowed to live the remainder of his years as a private citizen on a state pension in Prusa ad Olympum, Bithynia. He lived a further six years, dying in simple happiness. He is said to have recommended to Constantius as his friend, during his happy retirement in Brusa, that peace could only be obtained in a private station.

<text>In linear algebra, a coordinate vector is a representation of a vector as an ordered list of numbers (a tuple) that describes the vector in terms of a particular ordered basis. An easy example may be a position such as (5, 2, 1) in a 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with the basis as the axes of this system. Coordinates are always specified relative to an ordered basis. Bases and their associated coordinate representations let one realize vector spaces and linear transformations concretely as column vectors, row vectors, and matrices; hence, they are useful in calculations.

The idea of a coordinate vector can also be used for infinite-dimensional vector spaces, as addressed below.

== Definition ==
Let &quot;V&quot; be a vector space of dimension &quot;n&quot; over a field &quot;F&quot; and let 
:formula_1
be an ordered basis for &quot;V&quot;. Then for every formula_2 there is a unique linear combination of the basis vectors that equals &quot;formula_3&quot;:
:formula_4
The coordinate vector of &quot;formula_3&quot; relative to &quot;B&quot; is the sequence of coordinates
:formula_6
This is also called the &quot;representation of formula_3 with respect to B&quot;, or the &quot;B representation of formula_3&quot;. The formula_9 are called the &quot;coordinates of formula_3&quot;. The order of the basis becomes important here, since it determines the order in which the coefficients are listed in the coordinate vector.

Coordinate vectors of finite-dimensional vector spaces can be represented by matrices as column or row vectors. In the above notation, one can write
:formula_11
and
:formula_12 
where formula_13 is the transpose of the matrix formula_14.

== The standard representation ==
We can mechanize the above transformation by defining a function formula_15, called the &quot;standard representation of V with respect to B&quot;, that takes every vector to its coordinate representation: formula_16. Then formula_15 is a linear transformation from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;. In fact, it is an isomorphism, and its inverse formula_18 is simply
:formula_19

Alternatively, we could have defined formula_20 to be the above function from the beginning, realized that formula_20 is an isomorphism, and defined formula_15 to be its inverse.

==Examples==
=== Example 1 ===
Let formula_23 be the space of all the algebraic polynomials of degree at most 3 (i.e. the highest exponent of &quot;x&quot; can be 3). This space is linear and spanned by the following polynomials:
:formula_24

matching
:formula_25

then the coordinate vector corresponding to the polynomial
:formula_26

is
:formula_27

According to that representation, the differentiation operator &quot;d&quot;/&quot;dx&quot; which we shall mark &quot;D&quot; will be represented by the following matrix:
:formula_28

Using that method it is easy to explore the properties of the operator, such as: invertibility, Hermitian or anti-Hermitian or neither, spectrum and eigenvalues, and more.

=== Example 2 ===
The Pauli matrices, which represent the spin operator when transforming the spin eigenstates into vector coordinates.

== Basis transformation matrix ==
Let &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; be two different bases of a vector space &quot;V&quot;, and let us mark with formula_29 the matrix which has columns consisting of the &quot;C&quot; representation of basis vectors &quot;b1, b2, …, bn&quot;: 
:formula_30

This matrix is referred to as the basis transformation matrix from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;C&quot;. It can be regarded as an automorphism over formula_31. Any vector &quot;v&quot; represented in &quot;B&quot; can be transformed to a representation in &quot;C&quot; as follows:
:formula_32

Under the transformation of basis, notice that the superscript on the transformation matrix, &quot;M&quot;, and the subscript on the coordinate vector, &quot;v&quot;, are the same, and seemingly cancel, leaving the remaining subscript. While this may serve as a memory aid, it is important to note that no such cancellation, or similar mathematical operation, is taking place.

===Corollary===
The matrix &quot;M&quot; is an invertible matrix and &quot;M&quot;−1 is the basis transformation matrix from &quot;C&quot; to &quot;B&quot;. In other words,
:formula_33

==Infinite-dimensional vector spaces==

Suppose &quot;V&quot; is an infinite-dimensional vector space over a field &quot;F&quot;. If the dimension is &quot;κ&quot;, then there is some basis of &quot;κ&quot; elements for &quot;V&quot;. After an order is chosen, the basis can be considered an ordered basis. The elements of &quot;V&quot; are finite linear combinations of elements in the basis, which give rise to unique coordinate representations exactly as described before. The only change is that the indexing set for the coordinates is not finite. Since a given vector &quot;v&quot; is a &quot;finite&quot; linear combination of basis elements, the only nonzero entries of the coordinate vector for &quot;v&quot; will be the nonzero coefficients of the linear combination representing &quot;v&quot;. Thus the coordinate vector for &quot;v&quot; is zero except in finitely many entries.

The linear transformations between (possibly) infinite-dimensional vector spaces can be modeled, analogously to the finite-dimensional case, with infinite matrices. The special case of the transformations from &quot;V&quot; into &quot;V&quot; is described in the full linear ring article.

<doc id="879366" wikidata="Q693549" url="?curid=879366" title="Magdalenian">
<text>Magdalenian cultures (also Madelenian; French: &quot;Magdalénien&quot;) are later cultures of the Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic in western Europe. They date from around 17,000 to 12,000 years ago. It is named after the type site of La Madeleine, a rock shelter located in the Vézère valley, commune of Tursac, in France&#x27;s Dordogne department.

Édouard Lartet and Henry Christy originally termed the period &quot;L&#x27;âge du renne&quot; (the Age of the Reindeer). They conducted the first systematic excavations of the type site, publishing in 1875. The Magdalenian is associated with reindeer hunters, although Magdalenian sites contain extensive evidence for the hunting of red deer, horses, and other large mammals present in Europe toward the end of the last glacial period. The culture was geographically widespread, and later Magdalenian sites stretched from Portugal in the west to Poland in the east, and as far north as France, the Channel Islands, England, and Wales. Besides La Madeleine, the chief stations of the Magdalenian are Les Eyzies, Laugerie-Basse, and Gorges d&#x27;Enfer in the Dordogne; Grotte du Placard in Charente and others in south-west France.

Magdalenian peoples produced a wide variety of art, including figurines and cave paintings. Evidence has been found suggesting that Magdalenian peoples regularly engaged in (probably ritualistic) cannibalism along with producing skull cups.

Genetic studies indicate that the Magdalenian peoples were largely descended from earlier Western European Cro-Magnon groups like the Gravettians that were present in Western Europe over 30,000 years ago prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), who had retreated to southwestern Europe during the LGM. Madgalenian peoples were largely replaced and in some areas absorbed by Epigravettian-related groups of Villabruna/Western Hunter Gatherer ancestry at the end of the Pleistocene.

==Period biology==
The Magdalenian is represented by numerous sites, whose contents show progress in arts and culture. It was characterized by a cold and dry climate, humans in association with the reindeer, and the extinction of the mammoth. The use of bone and ivory as implements, begun in the preceding Solutrean, increased, making the period essentially a bone period. Bone instruments are quite varied: spear-points, harpoon-heads, borers, hooks and needles.

The fauna of the Magdalenian seems to have included cave lions reindeer, arctic foxes, arctic hares, and other cold weather specialists. Magdalenian humans appear to have been of short stature, dolichocephalic, with a low retreating forehead and prominent brow ridges.

==Chronology==

The culture spans from approximately 17,000 to 12,000 BP, toward the end of the most recent ice age. Magdalenian tool culture is characterised by regular blade industries struck from carinated cores.

The Magdalenian is divided into six phases generally agreed to have chronological significance (Magdalenian I through VI, I being the earliest and VI being the latest). The earliest phases are recognised by the varying proportion of blades and specific varieties of scrapers, the middle phases marked by the emergence of a microlithic component (particularly the distinctive denticulated microliths), and the later phases by the presence of uniserial (phase5) and biserial &#x27;harpoons&#x27; (phase6) made of bone, antler and ivory.

Debate continues about the nature of the earliest Magdalenian assemblages, and it remains questionable whether the Badegoulian culture is the earliest phase of Magdalenian culture. Similarly, finds from the forest of Beauregard near Paris have been suggested as belonging to the earliest Magdalenian. The earliest Magdalenian sites are in France. The Epigravettian is a similar culture appearing at the same time. Its known range extends from southeast France to the western shores of the Volga River, Russia, with many sites in Italy.

The later phases of Magdalenian culture are contemporaneous with the human re-settlement of north-western Europe after the Last Glacial Maximum during the Late Glacial Maximum. As hunter gatherers, Magdalenians did not re-settle permanently in northwest Europe, instead following herds and seasons.

By the end of the Magdalenian, lithic technology shows a pronounced trend toward increased microlithisation. The bone harpoons and points have the most distinctive chronological markers within the typological sequence. As well as flint tools, Magdalenians are known for their elaborate worked bone, antler and ivory that served both functional and aesthetic purposes, including perforated batons.

The sea shells and fossils found in Magdalenian sites may be sourced to relatively precise areas and have been used to support hypotheses of Magdalenian hunter-gatherer seasonal ranges, and perhaps trade routes.

In northern Spain and south-west France this tool culture was superseded by the Azilian culture. In northern Europe it was followed by variants of the Tjongerian techno-complex. It has been suggested that key Late-glacial sites in south-western Britain may be attributed to Magdalenian culture, including Kent&#x27;s Cavern.

== Art ==

Bones, reindeer antlers and animal teeth display pictures carved or etched on them of seals, fish, reindeer, mammoths and other creatures.

The best of Magdalenian artworks are a mammoth engraved on a fragment of its own ivory; a dagger of reindeer antler, with a handle in the form of a reindeer; a cave-bear cut on a flat piece of schist; a seal on a bear&#x27;s tooth; a fish drawn on a reindeer antler; and a complete picture, also on reindeer antler, showing horses, an aurochs, trees, and a snake biting a man&#x27;s leg. The man is naked, which, together with the snake, suggests a warm climate in spite of the presence of the reindeer.

In the Tuc d&#x27;Audoubert cave, an 18-inch clay statue of two bison sculpted in relief was discovered in the deepest room, now known as the Room of the Bisons.

Examples of Magdalenian portable art include batons, figurines, and intricately engraved projectile points, as well as items of personal adornment including sea shells, perforated carnivore teeth (presumably necklaces), and fossils.

Cave sites such as Lascaux contain the best known examples of Magdalenian cave art. The site of Altamira in Spain, with its extensive and varied forms of Magdalenian mobiliary art has been suggested to be an agglomeration site where groups of Magdalenian hunter-gatherers congregated.

==Treatment of the dead==
Some skulls were cleaned of soft tissues, then had the facial regions removed, with the remaining brain case retouched, possibly to make the broken edges more regular. This manipulation suggests the shaping of skulls to produce skull cups. Finds of defleshed (as evidenced by cut marks) and cracked bones with human chewing marks at Gough&#x27;s Cave, England suggests that the Magdalenian peoples there engaged in cannibalism. Cannibalism has been suggested at a dozen other Magadelian sites across the culture&#x27;s geographic range, representing 25% of all Magdalenian sites, far more than any other European Paleolithic culture. It has been suggested that Magdalenian peoples practiced a form of funerary endocannibalism, where upon the death of a member of the community, they were ritually dismembered and consumed by other members of the group, with their skulls being used to create skull cups. At other Magdalenian sites primary burial with no evidence of cannibalism is observed, with a handful of sites showing alternating evidence of cannibalism and primary burial at different occupation layers. At sites with primary burial, genetic analysis of these individuals indicate that they are more closely related to the people of the Epigravettian culture/Villabruna cluster than to the Magdalenians that practiced cannibalism (who belong to the GoyetQ2 cluster).

==Genetics==
The genes of seven Magdalenians, the El Miron Cluster in Iberia, have shown close relationship to a population who had lived in Northern Europe some 20,000 years previously. The analyses suggested that 70-80% of the ancestry of these individuals was from the population represented by Goyet Q116-1, associated with the Aurignacian culture of about 35,000 BP, from the Goyet Caves in modern Belgium. It has been found that Magdalenians are closely related to Solutreans. It has also been found that Magdalenians are closely related to western Gravettians who inhabited France and Spain prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. The 15,000 year old GoyetQ2 individual from Goyet Caves is often used as a proxy for Magdalenian ancestry. Analysis of genomes of GoyetQ2-related Magdalenians suggest that like earlier Cro-Magnon groups, they probably had a relatively dark skin tone compared to modern Europeans. A 2023 study proposed that relative to earlier Western European Cro-Magnon related groups like Goyet Q116-1-related Aurignacian and the Western Gravettian associated Fournol cluster, the Goyet-Q2-related Magdalenians appear to have carried significant (~30% ancestry) from the Villabruna cluster (thought to be of southeastern European origin, and sharing affinities to West Asian peoples not found in earlier European hunter-gatherers) associated with the Epigravettian.

The three samples of Y-DNA included two samples of haplogroup I and one sample of HIJK. All samples of mtDNA belonged to U, including five samples of U8b and one sample of U5b.

Around 14-12,000 years ago, the Western Hunter-Gatherer cluster (which predominantly descended from the Villabruna cluster, with possible ancestry related to the Goyet-Q2 cluster), expanded northwards across the Alps, largely replacing the Goyet-Q2 cluster associated Magdalenian groups in Western Europe. In France and Spain, significant GoyetQ2-related ancestry persisted into the Mesolithic and Neolithic, with some Neolithic individuals in France and Spain largely of Early European Farmer descent showing significant GoyetQ2 ancestry.

<doc id="879369" wikidata="Q2406432" url="?curid=879369" title="Grid.org">
<text>grid.org was a website and online community established in 2001 for cluster computing and grid computing software users. For six years it operated several different volunteer computing projects that allowed members to donate their spare computer cycles to worthwhile causes. In 2007, it became a community for open source cluster and grid computing software. After around 2010 it redirected to other sites.

== Volunteer computing projects ==
From its establishment in April 2001 until April 27, 2007, grid.org was the website and organization that ran distributed computing projects such as the United Devices Cancer Research Project, led by Jikku Venkat, Ph.D and was sponsored philanthropically by United Devices (UD) and members participated in volunteer computing by running the UD Agent software (version 3.0).

=== Cancer Research Project ===

The United Devices Cancer Research Project, which began in 2001, was seeking possible drugs for the treatment of cancer using distributed computing. There were around 150,000 users in the United States and 170,000 in Europe along with hundreds of thousands more in other parts of the world.

The project was an alliance of several companies and organisations:
*United Devices Inc.
*National Foundation for Cancer Research
*University of Oxford Department of Chemistry
*Donors of molecular research

United Devices released the cancer research screensaver under the principle of using spare computing power. The program, which could be set to run continually, used &quot;virtual screening&quot; to find possible interactions between molecules and target proteins, i.e. a drug. These molecules (ligands) are sent to the host computer&#x27;s UD Agent. When these molecules dock successfully with a target protein this interaction is scored for further investigation.

The research consisted of two phases:

* Phase 1 tested over 3 billion drug-like molecules against 12 proteins which were known to be suitable targets for anti-cancer drugs. It used the &quot;THINK&quot; software for the simulation of the molecular interactions.
* Phase 2, using the &quot;LigandFit&quot; software developed by Accelrys to model interactions, sought to refine the Phase 1 data to produce a more manageable list of drug candidates for testing that would require experimental collaborators, including some from industry.

=== Human Proteome Folding Project, phase 1 ===

The IBM-sponsored &quot;Human Proteome Folding Project&quot; (&quot;HPF&quot;), phase 1, was announced on November 16, 2004 and was completed July 3, 2006. The project operated simultaneously on both grid.org and the IBM&#x27;s World Community Grid.

It made use of the &quot;Rosetta&quot; software to predict the structure of human proteins in order to help predict the function of proteins. This information may someday be used to help cure a variety of diseases and genetic defects.

According to an announcement on the grid.org forums, after the HPF1 project was completed it was left to continue running on grid.org until August 9, 2006. During that time, members whose computers were configured to run this project got new work and spent computing resources calculating a result, but the result was returned to grid.org for points only—it was not used for scientific research.

The status of the Human Proteome Folding Project caused some discussion on the grid.org forums. Most members wanted to see all available computing power directed toward the still-active cancer project, but UD representative Robby Brewer asserted that &quot;some [users] like the screensaver&quot;. As noted above, in the end the redundant HPF1 work on grid.org was halted.

=== Smallpox Project ===
The &quot;Smallpox Research Grid&quot; was a part of United Devices &quot;Patriot Grid&quot; initiative to fight biological terrorism. This project helped analyze potential drug candidates for a medical therapy in the fight against smallpox virus. It made use of the &quot;LigandFit&quot; software (that had already been used by phase 2 of the Cancer Research project), but with a specialized set of target molecules that targeted the smallpox virus.

The partners of the project included University of Oxford, the University of Western Ontario, Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, Essex University, Evotec OAI, Accelrys, and IBM.

The World Community Grid largely began because of the success of this project.

=== Anthrax Project ===
The &quot;Anthrax Research Project&quot; was a part of the United Devices &quot;Patriot Grid&quot; initiative to fight biological terrorism. It made use of the &quot;LigandFit&quot; software (that had already been used by phase 2 of the Cancer Research project), but with a specialized set of target molecules that targeted the advanced stages of anthrax bacterial infection.

The project was operated from January 22, 2002 until February 14, 2002 and ended after a total of 3.57 billion molecules had finished screening. The results of the research project were transmitted to biological scientists in order to finish the screening of the computational simulations.

The partners of the project included Oxford University.

=== HMMER Project ===
The HMMER Genetic Research project made use of the Hidden Markov model to search for patterns in genetic DNA sequences.

=== Webload Project ===
The &quot;Web Performance Testing&quot; project was operated as a commercial opportunity with select web hosting providers in order to help them test the scalability of their server infrastructures under periods of high-demand.

== Open source grid community ==
In November 2007, grid.org was repositioned by Univa as a community to allow users to interact and discuss open source cluster and grid related topics. It allowed users to download, get support for, contribute to, and report issues about the open source Globus Toolkit based products offered by Univa.
Over 100,000 unique visitors were reported in 2008.
Around mid 2010 it redirected to Unicluster.org (a Univa product) and by 2012 it redirected to Univa&#x27;s main site.

<text>Haifa bint Faisal Al Saud (; born 1950) is a member of the House of Saud. She is one of the grandchildren of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s founder King Abdulaziz and one of the children of King Faisal.

==Early life==
Haifa bint Faisal was born in July 1950. She is the daughter of King Faisal and Princess Iffat who was born to a Circassian family. She is the full sister of Mohammed bin Faisal, Saud bin Faisal, Luluwah bint Faisal, Sara bint Faisal and Turki bin Faisal.

==Philanthropy==
Princess Haifa is the founder of the Albaydha Housing Project, the national pilot for developmental housing in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. She is also the founder and chairwoman of the Zahra Breast Cancer Association in the Kingdom. 

Princess Haifa is also a board member of Effat University and the National Museum of Saudi Arabia.

==9/11 Commission Report==
The 9/11 Commission Report states in footnote 122: &quot;We have found no evidence that Saudi Princess Haifa al Faisal provided any funds to the conspiracy, either directly or indirectly.&quot;. (The quote itself comes either from David D. Aufhauser of the U.S. Treasury Department or Adam B. Drucker of the FBI.)

After the September 11 attacks, Princess Haifa was investigated for a sequence of payments allegedly made to a Saudi national by the name of Omar al-Bayoumi. Investigation has confirmed that some of the payments were in fact forwarded to al-Bayoumi&#x27;s wife, Manal Bajadr; the significance of these payments (and the extent to which they may have assisted the hijackers) is unclear. In April 1998, Osama Basnan, a Saudi national living in California, wrote to Haifa requesting money for his wife&#x27;s needed thyroid surgery. Haifa sent Basnan $15,000, although his wife, Majeda Dweikat, was not actually treated for another two years.

At some later point (accounts vary as to when; dates between November 1999 and March 2000 were given, and a Saudi government official put the onset at 4 December 1999), Haifa began sending monthly cashier&#x27;s checks to Dweikat of either $2,000 or $3,500, transporting them through Riggs Bank. Dweikat signed some of these checks over to her friend Manal Bajadr, wife of Omar al-Bayoumi. The payments continued through May 2002 and eventually totaled as much as $73,000. (This sort of charitable donation known as Zakat from members of the House of Saud to Saudi nationals living abroad is not particularly unusual.)

According to the Saudi daily, &quot;Al Riyadh&quot;, Haifa became &quot;so terrified&quot; that she asked that all checks drawn against her bank account with the Riggs Bank in Washington, D.C. since 1994 be examined. Some of these investigations led to the Riggs Bank scandals of 2003 and 2004. In 2002, in regard to the accusations against Prince Turki, her brother, stated &quot;Any allegations about money from my sister reaching the hijackers is allegation and half-truths and totally untrue.&quot;

==Personal life==
Haifa is the spouse of Bandar bin Sultan. They have eight children, four daughters and four sons, including Reema, Khalid and Faisal.

Haifa told that when she saw Bandar first, she had a feeling she would marry him. After four years, in 1972 they married. She said that their marriage was not a pre-arranged one. Her mother, Iffat, was a friend of Bandar&#x27;s grandmother, Hassa. She further said that her mother also liked Bandar.

<doc id="879383" wikidata="Q1851646" url="?curid=879383" title="One Nite Alone... Live!">
<text>One Nite Alone... Live! is a live album box set by Prince and The New Power Generation, containing live recordings from the intimate One Nite Alone... Tour performances. The album was released in 2002 but many of the tracks were new arrangements of songs dating from more than 20 years earlier. It was the first album since the &quot;Love Symbol Album&quot; in 1992 to be credited to Prince and The New Power Generation. Among the album&#x27;s highlights are &quot;Sometimes It Snows in April&quot; and &quot;Adore&quot; at the piano, an extended &quot;Joy in Repetition&quot;, and an energetic &quot;When U Were Mine&quot;.

== Overview ==
Prince&#x27;s backing musicians included Sheila E., Maceo Parker, Eric Leeds, Candy Dulfer, Greg Boyer, Renato Neto, John Blackwell, and Rhonda Smith. The entire album was recorded live from the audio console by Prince&#x27;s concert sound engineer Scottie Baldwin. Baldwin&#x27;s essay on the recording process is included in the liner notes.

&quot;One Nite Alone... Live!&quot; is the first audio document of Prince&#x27;s concerts and includes tracks from nine different shows from eight venues on the One Nite Alone... Tour. The track list is fairly representative of a typical night&#x27;s show on the tour, although it misses the cover versions performed regularly on the tour (such as &quot;A Case of You&quot;, &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot;, &quot;La-La Means I Love You&quot; and &quot;Sing a Simple Song&quot;), leaving only Prince compositions. The first two CDs contain the main act, the third CD the aftershow.

The album artwork was the first full work by Sam Jennings for Prince.

On May 29, 2020 the album was reissued as &quot;Up All Nite with Prince: The One Nite Alone Collection&quot;, a 4CD + DVD box set including the original three CDs, the studio album &quot;One Nite Alone...&quot; and the DVD &quot;Live at the Aladdin Las Vegas&quot;.

<doc id="879384" wikidata="Q6545590" url="?curid=879384" title="Entrée">
<text>An entrée (, ; ), in modern French table service and that of much of the English-speaking world, is a dish served before the main course of a meal. Outside North America and parts of English-speaking Canada, it is generally synonymous with the terms &quot;hors d&#x27;oeuvre&quot;, &quot;appetizer&quot;, or &quot;starter&quot;. It may be the first dish served, or it may follow a soup or other small dish or dishes.

In the United States and parts of English-speaking Canada, the term &quot;entrée&quot; instead refers to the main course or the only course of a meal.

==Early use of the term==
The word &quot;entrée&quot; as a culinary term first appears in print around 1536 in the &quot;Petit traicté auquel verrez la maniere de faire cuisine&quot;, more widely known from a later edition titled &quot;Livre fort excellent de cuisine&quot;, in a collection of menus at the end of the book. There, the first stage of each meal is called the &quot;entree de table&quot; (entrance to the table); the second stage consists of &quot;potaiges&quot; (foods boiled or simmered &quot;in pots&quot;); the third consists of one or more &quot;services de rost&quot; (meat or fowl &quot;roasted&quot; in dry heat); and the last is the &quot;issue de table&quot; (departure from the table). These four stages of the meal appear consistently in this order in all the books that derive from the &quot;Petit traicté&quot;. 

The terms &quot;entree de table&quot; and &quot;issue de table&quot; are organizing words, &quot;describing the structure of a meal rather than the food itself&quot;. The terms &quot;potaiges&quot; and &quot;rost&quot; indicate cooking methods but not ingredients. The menus, though, give some idea of both the ingredients and the cooking methods that were characteristic of each stage of the meal.

Sausages, offal, and raw watery fruits (oranges, plums, peaches, apricots, and grapes) were apparently considered uniquely appropriate for starting the meal, as those foods appear only in the &quot;entree de table&quot;. Other dishes considered appropriate for the entree stage also appear in later stages of the meal, such as venison cooked in various ways (in the &quot;entree&quot;, &quot;potaiges&quot;, and &quot;rost&quot; services) and savory pies and sauced meats (in the &quot;entree&quot; and &quot;rost&quot; services). The distribution of dishes is very similar to that of the menus in the &quot;Ménagier de Paris&quot;, written 150 years before the &quot;Petit traicté&quot;. 

==The entrée in the &quot;Classical Order&quot; of table service==

The stages of the meal underwent several significant changes between the mid-16th and mid-17th century. Notably, the potage became the first stage of the service and the entrée became the second stage; and by 1650, the term &quot;entrée&quot; had lost its literal meaning and had come to refer to the stage of the meal after the potage and before the roast, entremets, and dessert. 

The term &quot;entrée&quot; also came to refer to the dishes served at the entrée stage. While cookbooks and dictionaries of the 17th and 18th centuries rarely discuss the type of dishes appropriate to each stage of the meal with any specificity, entrées and the dishes of the other stages of the meal can be distinguished from each other by certain characteristics, such as their ingredients, cooking methods, and serving temperatures. The distinct characteristics of the entrée were at first loosely observed, or perhaps more accurately, the &quot;rules&quot; were in a formative stage for several decades. By the early 18th century, though, certain ingredients and cooking methods were increasingly confined to the entrée stage of the meal.

In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, entrées on meat days included butchers&#x27; meats (but not ham), suckling pig, fowl, furred and feathered game, and offal. Eggs were never served as entrées on meat days; they were served only as entremets. Vegetables often made up part of the sauce or garnish, but entrées on meat days were always meat dishes; separate dishes of vegetables were served only as entremets. 

On lean days, fish replaced meat and fowl in every stage of the meal. Entrées included a wide range of fish, shellfish, crustaceans, turtles, and frogs. Entrées were rarely composed only of vegetables, except during Lent, when vegetable entrées (&quot;entrées en racines&quot;, encompassing all vegetables, not just &quot;roots&quot;) were sometimes served. Eggs were commonly served as entrées on lean days out of Lent; in Lent, eggs were never served at any meal.

Moist cooking methods were characteristic of the entrée stage of the meal, typical preparations being sautés, ragoûts, and fricassées. Meat or fowl (but not fish) might be roasted, but it was first wrapped in paper, or stuffed with a forcemeat, or barded with herbs or anchovies, or finished in a sauce, or prepared in some other way to keep the dish from browning and crisping like a true roast. Savory pies and pastries were baked in dry heat, but the enclosed meat cooked in its own steam and juices. Meat fritters and, on lean days, fish fritters were also served as entrées.

All entrées were served hot, which was a salient feature of entrées until the 19th century.

=== Large entrées ===

Large joints of meat (usually beef or veal) and large whole fowl (turkey and geese) were the &quot;grandes&quot; or &quot;grosses entrées&quot; of the meal. When roasted, whole joints and fowl were called &quot;spit-roasted entrées&quot; (&quot;entrées de broche&quot;), always served in a sauce or ragoût to distinguish them from true roasts.

=== &quot;Le Bouilli&quot; ===

When boiled, a joint of beef was &quot;le bouilli&quot;, the first of the entrées consumed in the meal.

=== Relevés ===

In the late 18th century, the practice arose of removing the empty soup tureens and replacing them with &quot;entrées de broche&quot; or other &quot;grosses entrées&quot;. The replacement dishes were commonly called &quot;relevés&quot;, or in English, &quot;removes&quot;. They were the last of the entrées consumed at the meal, although they were brought to the table immediately after the &quot;potages&quot;.

=== Small entrées ===

The most numerous of the entrées at any meal were the &quot;ordinary entrées&quot; (&quot;entrées ordinaires&quot;), consumed after the &quot;bouilli&quot; and before other &quot;grosses entrées&quot;. In composition, they were distinguished from the &quot;grosses entrées&quot; by the small size of their ingredients, not the size of the dish itself. Small fowl could be served whole, but large fowl and large joints of meat were cut into pieces or fillets. Despite the designation &quot;ordinary&quot;, these entrées were much more elaborate and refined than &quot;grosses entrées&quot;.

=== Hors d&#x27;œuvre === 
In the late 17th century, &quot;hors d&#x27;œuvre&quot; were served in both the entrée and entremets stages of the meal as little &quot;extra&quot; dishes. In the late 18th century, hors d&#x27;œuvre were confined to the entrée stage of the meal and were thought of as a sort of small entrée, always served hot and always consumed as the last of the entrées.

==Changes in the 19th century==

In the 19th century, hors d&#x27;œuvre became a distinct stage of the meal. They were no longer considered to be entrées, and, in a marked change from earlier practice, they were consumed immediately after the potage and before the other entrées. Over the course of the century, cold hors d&#x27;œuvre became increasingly common.

Relevés also became a distinct stage of the meal, often consumed before the other entrées rather than after them. Relevés came to include not just spit-roasted joints, but all large joints and bulky cuts of butcher’s meats and whole fish cooked in any way. Entrées, in the new sense of the term, included less bulky foods, like sliced meats and fillets of fish; fowl cooked in any way other than roasting; foie gras; and meat pies and other pastries of poultry and game. 

Due at least in part to the collapse of the church’s authority in France, rules governing meat and lean days were followed irregularly. In particular, fish was commonly served on meat days, and whole fish became a classic relevé. Some styles of service even included a &quot;fish course&quot;. 

After the 1820s, the bouilli was no longer routinely served at fine dinners, having been replaced by a wider variety of relevés. Also, in a marked change from earlier practices, cold entrées became increasingly common. 

Over the course of the 19th century, entrées and relevés were sometimes considered to be the principal part of the meal.

==Changes in the 20th century==
Distinctions between the various types of entrées (&quot;grosses&quot;, &quot;grandes&quot;, &quot;de broche&quot;, &quot;relevé&quot;) had largely fallen out of use by the end of the 19th century, and menus of the first half of the 20th century routinely include entrées but not relevés.

In France, the entrée slowly came to be associated primarily with its position in the meal rather than the composition of its dishes. Despite the objections of various food authorities who insisted on retaining the classical meaning of the word, the term &quot;entrée&quot; came to refer to the first course of the meal, a small dish that precedes the main course (&quot;plat principal&quot;) in a three-course meal. The &quot;new&quot; use of the term, now common almost worldwide, is a return to the literal meaning of the word and a partial return to the medieval arrangement of the meal.

In the United States and parts of English-speaking Canada, though, the older understanding of the entrée as a substantial meat course persisted, and the word came to refer to the principal dish of the meal. In the 21st century, the use of the word entrée in North American menus began to decline, being replaced by terms like &quot;main course&quot; or other terms appropriate to the culinary tradition of a given restaurant or cookbook.

<text>Nepotianus (died 30 June 350), sometimes known in English as Nepotian, was a member of the Constantinian dynasty who reigned as a short-lived usurper of the Roman Empire. He ruled the city of Rome for twenty-eight days, before being killed by his rival usurper Magnentius&#x27; general Marcellinus.

==Background==

Nepotianus was the son of Eutropia, half-sister of Emperor Constantine I, and of Virius Nepotianus. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was the grandson of Emperor Constantius Chlorus and Flavia Maximiana Theodora.

==Events==
After the revolt of Magnentius, Nepotianus proclaimed himself emperor and entered Rome with a band of gladiators on 3 June 350. After attempting to resist Nepotianus with an undisciplined force of Roman citizens, the defeated &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; Titianus (or Anicius, or Anicetus), a supporter of Magnentius, fled the city.

Magnentius quickly dealt with this revolt by sending his trusted &quot;magister officiorum&quot; Marcellinus to Rome. According to Eutropius, Nepotianus was killed in the resulting struggle (on 30 June), his head put on a lance and borne around the city. In the following days, his mother Eutropia was also killed alongside the supporters of Nepotianus.

<text>Geoff Morrell (born 19 February 1958) is an Australian actor.

==Early life==
Morrell was born in Fairfield in Western Sydney, where his father was a schoolteacher. The family moved to Wollongong when Morrell was nine. He finished high school without doing well, academically. He subsequently worked at the Port Kembla Steelworks, but decided to repeat year 12, and after applying himself second time around, topped the HSC. 

Morrell received a NSW Teacher&#x27;s Scholarship and studied a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Wollongong. While studying, he made his stage debut as Algernon in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. He was also President of the Student Representative Council. He graduated in 1979.

==Career==
Morrell began his career in theatre acting, becoming a founding member of the Theatre South organisation. In 1983, he briefly moved to England, featuring in a number of productions there.

In 1985, he branched into film acting, with a minor role in a telemovie version of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;. Over the next few years, he moved between film and theatre, starring in productions such as &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;, as well as several supporting roles in films, telemovies, miniseries and regular series. These included notable Australian films &quot;Blackrock&quot; and &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot;. He has had guest roles in the series &quot;The Secret Life of Us&quot;, &quot;Stingers&quot; and &quot;Farscape&quot;.

Morrell starred as Harry in Australia&#x27;s first production of Michael Gow&#x27;s play &quot;Away&quot;, which was performed by the Griffin Theatre Company and premiered at the Stables Theatre in Sydney on 7 January 1986.

After filming &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot;, Morrell won the role of forensic scientist Lance Fisk in the series &quot;Murder Call&quot;, which screened from 1997 to 1999. In 2000, he won one of his most significant roles to date, as the protagonist of the ABC series &quot;Grass Roots&quot;. The series was not renewed after the 2001 season, and Morrell followed this with a major role in the ABC telemovie &quot;Marking Time&quot;, as the father of a boy in love with an asylum seeker.

Morrell won the 2000 AFI Award for Best Actor for &quot;Grass Roots&quot;, and has been nominated four times, for &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1997), &quot;Grass Roots&quot; second series, &quot;Changi&quot; (2001) and &quot;Marking Time&quot;. He has been nominated for three Silver Logies for &quot;Grass Roots&quot; (first and second series) and &quot;Changi&quot;.

In 2004, Morrell made a move into the mainstream when he became one of four new actors to join the long-running police series &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, on which he played Sergeant Mark Jacobs. In September 2004, there was speculation that the ABC would commission a third series of &quot;Grass Roots&quot;. However, Morrell stated that the ABC &quot;may have missed its chance&quot;, and as he remained contracted to &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, would likely not have been able to participate if the series did return. Due to family commitments, Morrell chose to leave &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;.

He has also been involved in the film &quot;Right Here Right Now&quot;. In 2010, Morrell made a return to ABC to star alongside Richard Roxburgh in the first series of &quot;Rake&quot;. Morrell played the role of Joe Sandilands, a fictional NSW Attorney-General involved in the inside wheeling and dealing of the NSW Labor.

In 2015, he appeared as Inspector Clive Small, in the two-part miniseries &quot;Catching Milat&quot;.

He appeared in the feature film &quot;Rogue&quot;, and Anthony Hayes&#x27; feature film debut &quot;Ten Empty&quot;. In 2010, he began work on the set of &quot;Cloudstreet&quot;, a television miniseries version of Tim Winton&#x27;s novel. He plays the role of Lester Lamb.

Morrell has since appeared in numerous other productions including &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;. In 2023 Morrell was named as part of the cast in Foxtel drama &quot;High Country&quot;, and Stan series &quot;Thou Shalt Not Steal.&quot; 

In 2024, Morrell was named as part of the cast for the Liam Neeson led &quot;The Ice Road 2: Road to the Sky&quot;. On 21 November 2024, Morrell was named for the second series of &quot;Mystery Road: Origin&quot;.

==Personal life==
Morrell is married to Australian actress and NIDA alumni Caroline Brazier. They met while working on the 2007 Australian thriller &quot;Rogue&quot;, and were married in 2008.

He has two children together with his ex-wife Megan, whom he had married in the early 1980s.

Since 1995, Morrell has also been an accomplished visual artist, having held several solo exhibitions.

<doc id="879392" wikidata="Q1163122" url="?curid=879392" title="Overhead camshaft engine">
<text>An overhead camshaft (OHC) engine is a piston engine in which the camshaft is located in the cylinder head above the combustion chamber. This contrasts with earlier overhead valve engines (OHV), where the camshaft is located below the combustion chamber in the engine block.

&quot;Single overhead camshaft&quot; (SOHC) engines have one camshaft per bank of cylinders. &quot;Dual overhead camshaft&quot; (DOHC, also known as &quot;twin-cam&quot;) engines have two camshafts per bank. The first production car to use a DOHC engine was built in 1910. Use of DOHC engines slowly increased from the 1940s, leading to many automobiles by the early 2000s using DOHC engines.

== Design ==

In an OHC engine, the camshaft is located at the top of the engine, above the combustion chamber. This contrasts the earlier overhead valve engine (OHV) and flathead engine configurations, where the camshaft is located down in the engine block. The valves in both OHC and OHV engines are located above the combustion chamber; however an OHV engine requires pushrods and rocker arms to transfer the motion from the camshaft up to the valves, whereas an OHC engine has the valves directly actuated by the camshaft.

Compared with OHV engines with the same number of valves, there are fewer reciprocating components and less valvetrain inertia in an OHC engine. This reduced inertia in OHC engines results in less valve float at higher engine speeds (RPM). A downside is that the system used to drive the camshaft (usually a timing chain in modern engines) is more complex in an OHC engine, such as the 4-chain valvetrain of the Audi 3.2 or the 2 meter chain on Ford cammers. Another disadvantage of OHC engines is that during engine repairs where the removal of the cylinder head is required, the camshaft engine timing needs to be reset. In addition, an OHC engine has a large cylinder head to accommodate the camshaft or an extra set of valves to increase the volumetric efficiency, so that with the same displacement as an OHV engine, the OHC engine will end up being the physically larger of the two mostly due to the enlarged cylinder head.

The other main advantage of OHC engines is that there is greater flexibility to optimise the size, location and shape of the intake and exhaust ports, since there are no pushrods that need to be avoided. This improves the gas flow through the engine, increasing power output and fuel efficiency.

=== Single overhead camshaft (SOHC) ===

The oldest configuration of overhead camshaft engine is the &quot;single overhead camshaft&quot; (SOHC) design. A SOHC engine has one camshaft per bank of cylinders, therefore a straight engine has a total of one camshaft and a V engine or flat engine has a total of two camshafts (one for each cylinder bank).

Most SOHC engines have 2 valves per cylinder (sometimes 3 or 4), 1 intake valve and one exhaust valve. Motion of the camshaft is usually transferred to the valves either directly (using a tappet) or indirectly via a rocker arm.

=== Dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) ===

A &quot;dual overhead cam&quot;, &quot;double overhead cam&quot;, or &quot;twin-cam&quot; engine has two camshafts over each bank of the cylinder head, one for the intake valves and another for the exhaust valves. Therefore there are two camshafts for a straight engine and a total of four camshafts for a V engine or a flat engine. 

A V engine or flat engine requires four camshafts to function as a DOHC engine, since having two camshafts in total would result in only a single camshaft per cylinder bank for these engine layouts. Some V engines with four camshafts have been marketed as &quot;quad-cam&quot; engines, however technically &quot;quad-cam&quot; would require four camshafts per cylinder bank (i.e. eight camshafts in total), therefore these engines are merely &quot;dual overhead camshaft&quot; engines. 

Many DOHC engines have 4 valves per cylinder (sometimes 5, Audi or Volkswagen for instance). The camshaft usually operates the valves directly via a bucket tappet. A DOHC design permits a wider angle between intake and exhaust valves than in SOHC engines, which improves the air-fuel mixture&#x27;s flow through the engine. A further benefit is that the spark plug can be placed at the optimum location, which in turn improves combustion efficiency. Another newer benefit of DOHC engine design is the ability to independently change/phase the timing between each camshaft and the crankshaft. This affords better fuel economy by allowing a broader torque curve. Although each major manufacturer has their own trade name for their specific system of variable cam phasing systems, overall they are all classified as variable valve timing.

== Components ==
=== Timing belt / timing chain ===
The rotation of a camshaft is driven by a crankshaft. Many 21st century engines use a toothed &quot;timing belt&quot; made from rubber and kevlar to drive the camshaft. Timing belts are inexpensive, produce minimal noise and have no need for lubrication. A disadvantage of timing belts is the need for regular replacement of the belt; recommended belt life typically varies between approximately . If the timing belt is not replaced in time and fails and the engine is an interference engine, major engine damage is possible.

The first known automotive application of timing belts to drive overhead camshafts was the 1953 Devin-Panhard racing specials built for the SCCA H-modified racing series in the United States. These engines were based on Panhard OHV flat-twin engines, which were converted to SOHC engines using components from Norton motorcycle engines. The first production car to use a timing belt was the 1962 Glas 1004 compact coupe.

Another camshaft drive method commonly used on modern engines is a &quot;timing chain&quot;, constructed from one or two rows of metal roller chains. By the early 1960s most production automobile overhead camshaft designs used chains to drive the camshaft(s). Timing chains do not usually require replacement at regular intervals, however the disadvantage is that they are noisier than timing belts.

===Gear train===
A gear train system between the crankshaft and the camshaft is commonly used in diesel overhead camshaft engines used in heavy trucks. Gear trains are not commonly used in engines for light trucks or automobiles.

=== Other camshaft drive systems ===
Several OHC engines up until the 1950s used a shaft with bevel gears to drive the camshaft. Examples include the 1908–1911 Maudslay 25/30, the Bentley 3 Litre, the 1917-? Liberty L-12, the 1929-1932 MG Midget, the 1925-1948 Velocette K series, the 1931-1957 Norton International and the 1947-1962 Norton Manx. In more recent times, the 1950-1974 Ducati Single, 1973-1980 Ducati L-twin engine, 1999-2007 Kawasaki W650 and 2011-2016 Kawasaki W800 motorcycle engines have used bevel shafts. The Crosley four cylinder was the last automotive engine to use the shaft tower design to drive the camshaft, from 1946 to 1952; the rights to the Crosley engine format were bought by a few different companies, including General Tire in 1952, followed by Fageol in 1955, Crofton in 1959, Homelite in 1961, and Fisher Pierce in 1966, after Crosley closed the automotive factory doors, and they continued to produce the same engine for several more years.

A camshaft drive using three sets of cranks and rods in parallel was used in the 1920–1923 Leyland Eight luxury car built in the United Kingdom. A similar system was used in the 1926-1930 Bentley Speed Six and the 1930-1932 Bentley 8 Litre. A two-rod system with counterweights at both ends was used by many models of the 1958-1973 NSU Prinz.
== History ==
=== 1900–1914 ===
Among the first overhead camshaft engines were the 1902 Maudslay SOHC engine built in the United Kingdom and the 1903 Marr Auto Car SOHC engine built in the United States. The first DOHC engine was a Peugeot inline-four racing engine which powered the car that won the 1912 French Grand Prix. Another Peugeot with a DOHC engine won the 1913 French Grand Prix, followed by the &quot;Mercedes-Benz 18/100 GP&quot; with an SOHC engine winning the 1914 French Grand Prix.

The Isotta Fraschini Tipo KM— built in Italy from 1910–1914— was one of the first production cars to use an SOHC engine.

=== World War I ===
During World War I, both the Allied and Central Powers; specifically those of the German Empire&#x27;s &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; air forces, sought to quickly apply the overhead camshaft technology of motor racing engines to military aircraft engines. The SOHC engine from the &quot;Mercedes 18/100 GP&quot; car (which won the 1914 French Grand Prix) became the starting point for both Mercedes&#x27; and Rolls-Royce&#x27;s aircraft engines. Mercedes created a series of six-cylinder engines which culminated in the Mercedes D.III. Rolls-Royce reversed-engineered the Mercedes cylinder head design based on a racing car left in England at the beginning of the war, leading to the Rolls-Royce Eagle V12 engine. Other SOHC designs included the Spanish Hispano-Suiza 8 V8 engine (with a fully enclosed-drivetrain), the American Liberty L-12 V12 engine, which closely followed the later Mercedes D.IIIa design&#x27;s partly-exposed SOHC valvetrain design; and the Max Friz-designed; German BMW IIIa straight-six engine. The DOHC Napier Lion W12 engine was built in Great Britain beginning in 1918.

Most of these engines used a shaft to transfer drive from the crankshaft up to the camshaft at the top of the engine. Large aircraft engines— particularly air-cooled engines— experienced considerable thermal expansion, causing the height of the cylinder block to vary during operating conditions. This expansion caused difficulties for pushrod engines, so an overhead camshaft engine using a shaft drive with sliding spline was the easiest way to allow for this expansion. These bevel shafts were usually in an external tube outside the block, and were known as &quot;tower shafts&quot;.

=== 1919–1944 ===

An early American overhead camshaft production engine was the SOHC straight-eight engine used in the 1921–1926 Duesenberg Model A luxury car.

In 1926, the Sunbeam 3 litre Super Sports became the first production car to use a DOHC engine. 

In the United States, Duesenberg added DOHC engines (alongside their existing SOHC engines) with the 1928 release of the Duesenberg Model J, which was powered by a DOHC straight-eight engine. The 1931–1935 Stutz DV32 was another early American luxury car to use a DOHC engine. Also in the United States, the DOHC Offenhauser racing engine was introduced in 1933. This inline-four engine dominated North American open-wheel racing from 1934 until the 1970s.

Other early SOHC automotive engines were the 1920–1923 Wolseley Ten, the 1928-1931 MG 18/80, the 1926–1935 Singer Junior and the 1928–1929 Alfa Romeo 6C Sport. Early overhead camshaft motorcycles included the 1925–1949 Velocette K Series and the 1927–1939 Norton CS1.

=== 1945–present ===
The 1946–1948 Crosley CC Four was arguably the first American mass-produced car to use an SOHC engine. This small mass-production engine powered the winner of the 1950 12 Hours of Sebring.

Use of a DOHC configuration gradually increased after World War II, beginning with sports cars. Iconic DOHC engines of this period include the 1948–1959 Lagonda straight-six engine, the 1949–1992 Jaguar XK straight-six engine and the 1954–1994 Alfa Romeo Twin Cam inline-four engine. The 1966-2000 Fiat Twin Cam inline-four engine was one of the first DOHC engines to use a toothed timing belt instead of a timing chain.

In the 1980s, the need for increased performance while reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions saw increasing use of DOHC engines in mainstream vehicles, beginning with Japanese manufacturers. By the mid-2000s, most automotive engines used a DOHC layout.

<text>Band on the Run is the third studio album by the British–American rock band Paul McCartney and Wings, released on 30 November 1973. It was McCartney&#x27;s fifth album after leaving the Beatles in April 1970 and his final album on Apple Records. Although sales were modest initially, its commercial performance was aided by two hit singles – &quot;Jet&quot; and &quot;Band on the Run&quot; – such that it became the top-selling studio album of 1974 in the United Kingdom and Australia, in addition to revitalising McCartney&#x27;s critical standing. It remains McCartney&#x27;s most successful album and the most celebrated of his post-Beatles works.

The album was mostly recorded at EMI&#x27;s studio in Lagos, Nigeria, as McCartney wanted to make an album in an exotic location. Shortly before departing for Lagos, drummer Denny Seiwell and guitarist Henry McCullough left the group. With no time to recruit replacements, McCartney went into the studio with just his wife Linda and Denny Laine. McCartney therefore played bass, drums, percussion and most of the lead guitar parts. The studio was of poor quality and conditions in Nigeria were tense and difficult; the McCartneys were robbed at knifepoint, losing a bag of song lyrics and demo tapes. After the band&#x27;s return to England, final overdubs and further recording were carried out in London, mostly at AIR Studios.

&quot;Band on the Run&quot; has been reissued numerous times with bonus tracks, including in 1993 as part of &quot;The Paul McCartney Collection&quot;, in 1999 for its 25th anniversary, in 2010 as part of the Paul McCartney Archive Collection and in 2024 for its 50th anniversary.

== Background ==
By 1973, three years after the break-up of the Beatles, Paul McCartney had yet to regain his artistic credibility or find favour with music critics for his post-Beatles work. After completing a successful UK tour with his band Wings in July 1973, he planned their third album as a means to re-establish himself after the mixed reception given to &quot;Wild Life&quot; and &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;.

Keen to record outside the United Kingdom, McCartney asked EMI to send him a list of all their international recording studios. He selected Lagos in Nigeria and was attracted to the idea of recording in Africa. In August, the band – consisting of McCartney and his wife Linda, ex-Moody Blues guitarist and pianist Denny Laine, Henry McCullough on lead guitar, and Denny Seiwell on drums – started rehearsals for the new album at the McCartneys&#x27; Scottish farm. During one rehearsal session, McCullough and McCartney argued, and McCullough quit. Seiwell left a week later, the night before the band flew out to Nigeria. This left just McCartney, Linda and Laine to record in Lagos, assisted by former Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick. McCartney had chosen Lagos, as he felt it would be a glamorous location where he and the band could sun on the beach during the day and record at night; the reality, however, was that, after the end of a civil war in 1970, Nigeria was run by a military government, with corruption and disease commonplace.

It was McCartney&#x27;s last album released on Apple Records. 
==Recording ==

The band and their entourage arrived in Lagos on 30 August 1973, returning to London late on 22 September. EMI&#x27;s studio, located on Wharf Road in the suburb of Apapa, was ramshackle and under-equipped. The control desk was faulty and there was only one tape machine, a Studer 8-track. The band rented houses near the airport in Ikeja, an hour away from the studio. McCartney, Linda, and their three children stayed in one, while Laine, his wife JoJo, Emerick, and Wings&#x27; two roadies stayed in another.

The group established a routine of recording during the week and playing tourist on the weekends. McCartney temporarily joined a local country club, where he spent most mornings. The band was driven to the studio in the early afternoon, and recording would last into the late evening or early morning. To compensate for the departed band members, McCartney played, in addition to his contributions on bass guitar, the drum and lead guitar parts, with Laine playing rhythm guitar and Linda adding keyboards. The first track they recorded at Apapa was &quot;Mamunia&quot;, the title for which McCartney appropriated from the name of a hotel in Marrakesh where Wings had stayed in April 1973.
Several of the songs on &quot;Band on the Run&quot; reflect themes of escape and freedom, while the structure of the album recalled the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. The song &quot;Band on the Run&quot; was partly inspired by a remark George Harrison had made during one of the many business meetings the Beatles attended in 1969 in an effort to address the problems afflicting their Apple Corps enterprise. Four years later, the album&#x27;s creation coincided with what author Peter Doggett terms McCartney&#x27;s &quot;moral victory in the debate over Allen Klein&quot;, as Harrison, John Lennon, and Ringo Starr now became embroiled in litigation against Klein – the business manager they had appointed to run Apple in 1969, despite strong opposition from McCartney. Doggett writes that McCartney was perhaps liberated creatively by this recent development, resulting in &quot;Band on the Run&quot; bearing &quot;a frothy self-confidence that was reminiscent of the Beatles at their most productive&quot;.

Aside from the challenges presented by the substandard studio, various incidents plagued Wings&#x27; stay in Lagos. While out walking one night against advice, McCartney and Linda were robbed at knifepoint. The assailants made off with all of their valuables, and even stole a bag containing a notebook full of handwritten lyrics and songs, and cassettes containing demos for songs to be recorded. On another occasion, McCartney was overdubbing a vocal track when he began gasping for air. According to Emerick: &quot;Within seconds, [McCartney] turned as white as a sheet, explaining to us in a croaking voice that he couldn&#x27;t catch his breath. We decided to take him outside for some fresh air ... [but] once he was exposed to the blazing heat he felt even worse and began keeling over, finally fainting dead away at our feet. Linda began screaming hysterically; she was convinced that he was having a heart attack ... The official diagnosis was that he had suffered a bronchial spasm brought on by too much smoking.&quot; Another incident was the confrontation with local Afrobeat pioneer and political activist Fela Kuti, who publicly accused the band of being in Africa to exploit and steal African music after their visit to his club. Kuti went to the studio to confront McCartney, who played their songs for him to show that they contained no local influence. Later on, drummer and former Cream member Ginger Baker invited Wings to record their entire album at his ARC Studio in Ikeja. McCartney agreed to go there for one day, and the song &quot;Picasso&#x27;s Last Words (Drink to Me)&quot; was recorded at ARC, with Baker himself shaking a tin can filled with gravel on the track.
Recording for the majority of the album&#x27;s basic tracks, together with initial overdubbing, was completed after six weeks in Nigeria. Wings hosted a beach barbecue to celebrate the end of recording, and on 23 September 1973 they flew back to England, where they were met by fans and journalists. Upon returning to London, the McCartneys received a letter from EMI dated before the band had left England warning them to not go to Lagos due to an outbreak of cholera.

In October, two weeks after the band&#x27;s return to London, work began at George Martin&#x27;s AIR Studios to transfer many of the eight-track recordings made in Nigeria to sixteen-track. &quot;Jet&quot;, named after one of the McCartney children&#x27;s ponies, was recorded in its entirety at AIR. The McCartneys and Laine carried out further overdubs on the Lagos recordings during this period; all of the orchestral arrangements for the album were taped at AIR in a single day, conducted by Tony Visconti. Visconti was given three days to write the arrangements, including for the 60-piece orchestra on the title track. He said the arrangements were collaborations with McCartney, and was surprised he was not correctly credited for his work until the 25th anniversary reissue of the album. Another contributor was saxophonist Howie Casey, who overdubbed solos on &quot;Bluebird&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Vandebilt,&quot; and &quot;Jet&quot;, and would go on to become Wings&#x27; regular horn player. On 8 October, Remi Kabaka, a musician coming from Nigeria, although born in Ghana, added a set of percussion on &quot;Bluebird&quot;. Final mixing of the album was completed over three days at London&#x27;s Kingsway Studios in early November.

== Cover artwork==
The album cover photograph was taken in Osterley Park, West London, on 28 October 1973 by photographer Clive Arrowsmith from a concept by Hipgnosis and McCartney. It depicts the McCartneys, Laine, and six other well-known people dressed as convicts and posed as though caught by a prison searchlight. The six celebrities are: Michael Parkinson, Kenny Lynch, James Coburn, Clement Freud, Christopher Lee, and John Conteh. Arrowsmith said the photo used for the cover was one of four he found acceptable out of the 24 pictures he took during the session. The spotlight&#x27;s low potency meant everyone had to stand still for two seconds for proper exposure, which was made difficult by the photographer and subjects reportedly being in a &quot;substance haze&quot; following a party held by Paul McCartney. The golden hue of the picture comes from Arrowsmith’s use of daylight film instead of nighttime Tungsten film, which would have been more typical for the setting.

==Release==
Apple Records issued &quot;Band on the Run&quot; in the UK on November 30 (as Apple PAS 10007), and in the U.S. on 5 December (as Apple SO 3415). Rather than having the band promote the album on radio and television or with a tour, McCartney undertook a series of magazine interviews, most notably with Paul Gambaccini for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The conversations with Gambaccini took place at various locations from September 1973 onward, and combined to form, in the words of authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, &quot;a remarkably forthcoming interview in comparison to the &#x27;thumbs-aloft&#x27; profiles usually allowed by [McCartney]&quot;.

&quot;Helen Wheels&quot; was released as a non-album single in late October 1973, and became a top 10 hit in America the following January. For commercial reasons, Capitol Records, the US distributor for Apple Records, asked to include &quot;Helen Wheels&quot; on the album. McCartney agreed, although it was never his intention to include the track. While &quot;Helen Wheels&quot; is not included on CD editions of &quot;Band on the Run&quot; in the UK (except as a bonus track on the 1993 &quot;The Paul McCartney Collection&quot; edition of the album), it has often appeared on CD releases of the album in the US and Canada, starting with the initial Columbia Records release in 1984. Early versions of the Capitol release fail to list &quot;Helen Wheels&quot; on the label or the CD insert, making the song a &quot;hidden track&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
Initially, the album did not sell especially well, with the record-buying public wary after Wings&#x27; preceding releases. On the UK Albums Chart, &quot;Band on the Run&quot; climbed to number 9 on 22 December, remaining there for a second week before dropping to number 13. On America&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, it peaked at number 7 on 2 February 1974, and then spent the next six weeks in the lower reaches of the top ten. The album went on to achieve considerable success, however, thanks to the popularity of the two singles culled from it: &quot;Jet&quot; and the title track. Writing in 1981, Bob Woffinden described &quot;Band on the Run&quot; as the first Beatles-related release to be &quot;planned with a marketing strategy&quot;, as Capitol Records now assumed a fully active role in promoting the album following the removal of Klein&#x27;s ABKCO Industries as managers of Apple. Although McCartney had been reluctant to issue album tracks as singles, the public&#x27;s apparent lack of interest in &quot;Band on the Run&quot; led him to agree to the recommendations of Capitol&#x27;s head of marketing, Al Coury, who had similarly pushed for the inclusion of &quot;Helen Wheels&quot; on the album&#x27;s American release. McCartney therefore authorised single edits of the two A-sides taken from the album.

&quot;Jet&quot; was issued as a single in America on 28 January with &quot;Mamunia&quot; as the B-side, although &quot;Let Me Roll It&quot;, which was the B-side of the UK release, replaced &quot;Mamunia&quot; on 15 February. The single&#x27;s success provided new impetus for the album, which hit number 2 in the UK at the end of March and topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s listings on 13 April. Apple issued &quot;Band on the Run&quot; as a single in America on 8 April, backed by &quot;Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five&quot;; the UK release followed on 28 June, with the non-album instrumental &quot;Zoo Gang&quot; as the B-side. Due to the popularity of &quot;Band on the Run&quot;, the album returned to number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart on 8 June, when the single simultaneously topped the Hot 100. In Britain, the album finally hit number 1 on 27 July, and it stayed there for seven consecutive weeks. On the alternative UK listings compiled by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Band on the Run&quot; remained in the top ten from 26 January through 23 November 1974. During that time, its chart performance similarly reflected the popularity of the two singles, with the album spending three weeks at number 2 in April, and six weeks at number 1 throughout August and the first week of September.

The album topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart on three separate occasions during 1974, and was the top selling album of that year in Australia and Canada. In Britain, it came second in the year-end standings, behind the compilation &quot;The Singles: 1969–1973&quot; by the Carpenters. Through this success with Wings, McCartney established himself as the most commercially successful of the four former Beatles. Author Robert Rodriguez views the album&#x27;s arrival at number 1 in America in April 1974 as the moment when McCartney usurped George Harrison as the &quot;ex-Beatle Most Likely to Succeed&quot;, and the beginning of a period of public acclaim that reached its zenith with the Wings Over America Tour in 1976.

&quot;Band on the Run&quot; was eventually certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and would go on to sell 9 million copies worldwide, becoming EMI&#x27;s top selling album of the 1970s in the UK. Its continued success through 1974 was also beneficial in allowing Wings to recruit a new guitarist and drummer, and to integrate them into the band before beginning new recordings.

== Critical reception ==

Upon its release, &quot;Band on the Run&quot; received mostly favourable reviews. Rodriguez writes that, after the disappointment of McCartney&#x27;s previous work since the Beatles, &quot;It was exactly the record fans and critics had long hoped he would make&quot;.

In a combined review of &quot;Band on the Run&quot; and Starr&#x27;s concurrently released &quot;Ringo&quot; album, Charles Shaar Murray of the &quot;NME&quot; wrote: &quot;The ex-Beatle least likely to re-establish his credibility and lead the field has pulled it off with a positive master-stroke of an album entitled &quot;Band On The Run&quot;.&quot; In addition to praising McCartney for using synthesizer &quot;like an instrument, and not like an electric whoopee cushion&quot;, Shaar Murray concluded: &quot;&quot;Band On The Run&quot; is a great album. If anybody ever puts down McCartney in your presence, bust him in the snoot and play him this. He will thank you for it afterwards.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Loraine Alterman considered the album to be &quot;bursting with a great deal of compelling music even if the lyrics at times make as much sense as that cover photo&quot; and admired the &quot;fascinating range of sounds&quot; offered in the title track, as well as the &quot;lovely, romantic aura&quot; of &quot;Bluebird&quot;. While noting the importance of studio production to the overall effect, Alterman wrote: &quot;McCartney has managed to make the complexities of multi-track recording sound as natural and fresh as tomorrow.&quot; Jon Landau of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the album as, &quot;with the possible exception of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;, the finest record yet released by any of the four musicians who were once called the Beatles&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Band on the Run&quot; one of the Best Albums of 1973.

&quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau wrote in 1981: &quot;I originally underrated what many consider McCartney&#x27;s definitive post-Beatles statement, but not as much as its admirers overrate it. Pop masterpiece? This? Sure it&#x27;s a relief after the vagaries of &quot;Wild Life&quot; and &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;.&quot; He praised the title track and the &quot;Afro-soul&quot; introduction to &quot;Mamunia&quot;, calling them &quot;the &quot;high points&quot;&quot;. Christgau ultimately awarded the album a C+ rating, indicating &quot;a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork&quot;. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that, while some songs are excellent and the album overall is enjoyable, it is more about showmanship than content. A subsequent review on Allmusic by Al Campbell was more generous, considering the arrangements and melodic hooks of the songs up to the caliber of McCartney&#x27;s work in the Beatles and concluding: &quot;Though it lacks the emotional resonance of contemporaneous releases by John Lennon and George Harrison, McCartney&#x27;s infallible instinct for popcraft overflows on this excellent release.&quot; The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of the 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of the album said that &quot;the real action still lies in the original LP&#x27;s revved-up pleasures&quot;. Writing for &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine in 2011, John Harris included &quot;Band on the Run&quot; among &quot;the trilogy of truly essential post-Beatles solo albums&quot;, along with Harrison&#x27;s &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;.

In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;Band on the Run&quot; at number 75 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. In 2012, it was voted 418th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s revised list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2013, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<text>Witte Corneliszoon de With (28 March 1599 – 8 November 1658) was a Dutch States Navy officer who served during the Eighty Years&#x27; War and the First Anglo-Dutch War.

== Early life and childhood ==

De With was born on a farmstead in the hamlet of Hoogendijk near Brielle or Brill, the very town in which Maarten Tromp had been born a year earlier. According to legend, they were friends or even already rivals in their youth, but there is no proof of this. His father died in 1602, leaving behind three sons, besides Witte also Abraham and Andries, and a daughter Catharina. The De With family were Mennonites and strict pacifists; in 1610, Witte, as an anabaptist not yet baptised, obtained a baptism by a Calvinist preacher so that he would no longer feel constrained in using violence, as he was by nature not a peace-seeking boy.

After some failed minor jobs, he went on his first sea voyage to the Dutch East Indies on 21 January 1616 when he was sixteen, as a cabin boy on Captain Geen Huygen Schapenham&#x27;s ship the &quot;Gouden Leeuw&quot;, part of a Dutch East India Company (VOC) fleet of five vessels. He arrived at Bantam on 13 November 1616.

Until October 1617, he participated in two trade voyages to Coromandel in India. Afterwards, he became manservant of governor Jan Pieterszoon Coen. He served as a corporal during the siege of Jakarta in 1618. On 8 October 1618, he sailed home on the &quot;Gouden Leeuw&quot;, returning to Brill on 23 May 1619. On 20 August 1620, he took service with the Admiralty of the Maze as a &quot;schipper&quot; (then the highest NCO rank), still under Schapenham on the &quot;Gelderland&quot;. From December 1620, the &quot;Gelderland&quot; participated in an expedition by Admiral Willem Haultain de Zoete against the Barbary Corsairs, returning in August 1621.

In spring 1622, De With was appointed lieutenant on Schapenham&#x27;s vessel. When the latter became ill, De With functioned as commandeur, acting captain, of the &quot;Gelderland&quot; during convoy duty in the Baltic. When Schapenham recovered, De With served for a short period on the &quot;Maurits&quot; to protect the herring fleet.

In July 1622, De With became flag captain of &quot;Delft&quot; of now Vice-Admiral Schapenham, who, from 29 April 1623, carried out the spectacular raid organised by the Admiralty of Amsterdam, sending the so-called &quot;Nassau fleet&quot; against the Spanish possessions on the west coast of America; this fleet rounded Cape Horn in March 1624. On his first voyage as a captain, De With already showed he was the strict disciplinarian of later legend: on 13 April, six of his men deserted his ship and the constant beatings and floggings to flee to the uninhabited island of Juan Fernández. Until October, the fleet attacked Spanish shipping and settlements; during one of the actions, De With was wounded by a musket bullet. Then, it crossed the Pacific, sailing via the Mariana Islands to the Indies.

Reaching Ternate in the Spice Islands on 5 March 1625, De With, himself on request of the governor of Ambon in a punitive action, laid waste to the island, destroying by his own count 90,000 clove trees of the inhabitants, to increase the price of this commodity. He departed for the Republic on 6 February 1626, after the death of Schapenham, as Vice-Admiral (in service of the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie) of a Spice Fleet of four ships, then worth five million guilders. He returned on 22 September 1626, thus having circumnavigated the globe, a feat in which he took much personal pride. On his return, he learned that his mother and sister had died; he remained on shore for one and a half years.

== Capture of Spain&#x27;s treasure fleet ==

In 1627, De With married for the first time, with his second cousin Maria de With from Nieuwenhoorn. In April 1628, their first child, Cornelis, died. The same year, De With, entering the service of the WIC, became flag captain on the &quot;Amsterdam&quot; to Admiral Piet Heyn during an expedition from 20 May to capture the Spanish treasure fleet. In September this attack was successful near Cuba. On 10 January 1629 the fleet returned to the Republic. Out of the bounty of eleven million guilders, De With was granted about 500 guilders, with which he was very dissatisfied, as he imputed to himself a crucial role in the capture by taking a barque in August, the crew of which provided essential information regarding the whereabouts of the treasure fleet.

In 1629, the five Dutch admiralties refused to allow Heyn, effectively their new supreme commander, to enlarge his staff with a special tactical-operational officer, for which function Heyn had De With in mind. De With now hoped to be appointed flag captain on the &quot;Vlieghende Groene Draeck&quot;, but Admiral Maerten Tromp was chosen instead. De With was made captain of the &quot;Prins Hendrik&quot; in June; the same month Heyn was killed in action. Disappointed and despairing of ever being promoted, De With left direct naval service in November.

In September, his daughter Cornelia was born. From May 1630 to 1633, De With was Commodore of the &quot;Grote Visserij&quot;, the administrative body controlling and militarily protecting the Herring Fleet. The change, however, was largely a formality as regular warships were used for this task: De With remained captain of the &quot;Prins Hendrik&quot; and functioned as flag captain whenever admirals had to make use of this vessel.

In May 1631, his first wife died. In August, he remarried the eighteen-year-old Hillegonda van Goch, the daughter of a Rotterdam patrician. In 1633, his second son Cornelis was born, but the boy died in July 1634. Early in 1634, De With rejoined the navy for four months when Lieutenant-Admiral Philips van Dorp used the &quot;Prins Hendrik&quot; as his flagship for an expedition in the Gulf of Biscay. During the voyage it became clear that Vice-Admiral Jasper Liefhebber resented the domineering attitude of De With. Tensions between the two men became unbearable, and De With left his ship and thus the navy in the middle of the campaign. From October 1635 to October 1636, he was schepen in Brill; in 1636 also, his fourth child was born, Maria. In October 1637, he was appointed deacon in Brill. De With now mainly lived from rent on the land inherited from his parents, supplemented by a share in a river fishing vessel.

== Battle of the Downs ==

Tromp as well as De With had left the navy after a conflict with Van Dorp. The two most talented Dutch navy officers were sidetracked by the attempt of stadtholder Frederick Henry to centralise the cumbersome Dutch naval administration with its five admiralties. Both Van Dorp and Liefhebber were brave men but poor managers. Overworked by the many difficulties and political strife brought by the reorganisation, they feared being replaced by the younger and more competent Tromp and De With. However, the removal of the latter only delayed the inevitable.

In the summer of 1637 the fleet supply system collapsed, bringing the hungry and thirsty sailors to the brink of a general mutiny. The Dunkirkers repeatedly broke through the Dutch blockade of Dunkirk to attack Dutch shipping. Charles I of England exploited the crisis to force Dutch North Sea herring fishers to pay for fishing permits. All that caused such an outcry that when Van Dorp offered his resignation, Frederick Henry was forced to accept it, also firing Liefhebber. He replaced them on 29 October with Tromp and De With. However, De With was again severely disappointed when he was refused supreme command. Instead, as Vice-Admiral of Holland and West Frisia, he was second in command under Lieutenant-Admiral Tromp.

De With fought under Tromp at the Battle of the Downs (1639), where the Spanish fleet was destroyed. De With became very jealous of Tromp&#x27;s popularity after this victory. In the same battle, he made an enemy of Zealandic Vice-Admiral Johan Evertsen, and accused him of cowardice and avarice.

== Court martial ==

In 1640, De With was brought to trial when, his fleet having been dispersed by a storm, he had returned to Hellevoetsluis alone. The court martial was presided by Maarten Tromp and though he was acquitted, De With had the compulsive notion that Tromp had tried to influence witnesses against him. Both in Battle of Fehmarn (1644) and 1645, De With, along with an enormous convoy of merchantmen (702 on the return voyage of the latter year) forced the Sound against the Danes, who had tried to impose higher toll rates. The end of the Swedish-Danish war and the Dutch naval dominance under De With in the Baltic Sea rested on the power of Andries Bicker, burgomaster of Amsterdam and member of the States General and not on that of the Stadtholder Frederik Hendrik of Orange.

In 1647, De With was sent with a poorly equipped fleet to assist the Dutch colony of Brazil from attack by the Portuguese. He refused to cooperate with the Council of Brazil and, after many months of conflict during which his fleet deteriorated through lack of supplies, he returned against orders with the two remaining seaworthy ships to the Netherlands in November 1649.

On his return, he went to the States-General to complain about the policy of the colony of Brazil but was himself arrested, charged of insubordination and desertion on 259 points and nearly condemned to decapitation. He was saved only by the intervention of the States of Holland, which pointed out their exclusive right to condemn admirals to death.

In February 1651, he was acquitted of most charges, the punishment being reduced to a loss of wages for the period involved. In September 1651, De With was again on convoy duty.

== The First Anglo-Dutch War ==

In the First Anglo-Dutch War against the Commonwealth of England, when Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp in the autumn of 1652 fell in disgrace with the States-General, De With commanded the Dutch fleet at the Battle of the Kentish Knock but failed in his mission. Morally broken, he remained ill at home for many months, while Tromp replaced him for the Battle of Dungeness and the Battle of Portland. On 8 May Tromp officially became supreme commander again and De With fought as subcommander under Tromp in the subsequent actions: the Battle of the Gabbard and the final Battle of Scheveningen in which Tromp died. De With was temporary commander between 14 August and 22 September but was denied permanent command of the Dutch fleet because of his difficult personality in favour of Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam. Between 1654 and 1656 he was inactive, only sailing again for the relief of Danzig.

==Conflict with Denmark==
After the commencement of the Torstensson War, the Dutch public openly expressed support for Sweden. Following the peace settlement, the Dutch hoped for reduced tolls, by Denmark which did not happen. This led to heightened political tensions. in the Dutch Republic. In response, a fleet comprising 48 ships under Witte de With, escorting three hundred merchant vessels, was dispatched through the Sound with the intent of paying zero tolls until the Danish lowered the tolls. De With was instructed to use force if the Danes intervened. In July 1645, he arrived, the Danish monarch wanted to see this in person, De With raised his hat when he saw him, receiving no response. The Danes perceived this as a humiliation. The Dutch fleet was in no hurry to leave, and Christian IV realized he had no choice but to concede. A treaty was subsequently signed, wherein the Danes made significant concessions.

==Death in the Battle of the Sound ==

De With met his end in November 1658 at the Battle of the Sound, during the Northern Wars, commanding the vanguard of the Dutch fleet relieving Copenhagen from the Swedish. His ship; the &quot;Brederode&quot;, was grounded and surrounded by the enemy at Oresund. He was first shot through the left thigh by a musket ball and hours later through the breast. When Swedish soldiers boarded the ship he refused to surrender his sword, wrestling with two of them on his knees and exclaiming: &quot;I have faithfully wielded this sword so many years for Holland, so I won&#x27;t give it up now to some common soldiers!&quot; He collapsed, was brought to his cabin to recover, insisted on walking by himself over the gangplank to the Swedish ship, collapsed again and died. His body was embalmed on orders of Charles X of Sweden and displayed as a war trophy in the town hall of Elsinore by the Swedes, who, in January 1659, delivered his body to the Danish court in Copenhagen; after the Danes had paid their homage, it was transported to the Netherlands and buried with great pomp in Rotterdam on 7 October, in the church of St Lawrence, where the marble grave memorial, restored after being damaged by the German bombardment of 14 May 1940, can still be seen.

== The arch-rivalry with Tromp ==

De With had a lifelong rivalry with Admiral Maarten Tromp. As Dutch naval historian Johan Carel Marinus Warnsinck put it: &quot;He was feared and hated by his inferiors (on several occasions, crews refused to let him on board to use their ship as flagship), shunned by his equals and always full of insubordination against his superiors&quot;. De With was also seen as courageous, competent and an excellent sailor. He was embittered by the neglect of the fleet between 1639 and 1650.

== Pamphleteer ==

One of the more remarkable aspects of De With&#x27;s personality was his being a notorious pamphleteer, publishing many booklets, anonymously or under the name of friends, in which he sometimes praised but more often ridiculed or even insulted his fellow officers. Tromp was a favourite subject for all three categories.

<text> (, ) is a very common form of rye bread from Denmark. usually resembles a long brown extruded rectangle, no more than high, and long, depending on the bread pan in which it is baked. The basic ingredient is rye flour which will produce a plain or &quot;old-fashioned&quot; bread of uniform, somewhat heavy structure, but the most popular versions today contain whole grains (cracked or chopped rye kernels) and often other seeds such as sunflower seeds, linseeds or pumpkin seeds. Most Danes eat &quot;rugbrød&quot; every day.&lt;ref name=&quot;thelocal.dk/danes-every&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The dough may be made exclusively with rye flour or contain up to one third whole rye grains. A small amount of wheat flour, sugar or molasses is often added to adjust the taste or because contrary to former times wheat flour is cheaper than rye.

&#x27; was the major staple of most of the population until potatoes became widespread during the late 19th century, and even up to the 1950s, Danes ate much larger amounts of than today. It has been discussed why this bread type prevailed better in Denmark than other Northern European countries.&#x27; is implied in the colloquial Danish term for serving prison time, (&#x27;on water and bread&#x27;). Until 1933, prisoners could in some circumstances be punished with an allowance of only water, a fixed amount of &quot;, salt and possibly lard.

&quot; is regarded somewhat difficult for home baking. Apart from the sourdough preparation, the loaves must not be leavened for too long, or else the taste can become excessively sour, with the relatively pungent acetic acid taking the lead over milder-tasting lactic acid, and enzymes can cause the gluten (protein structure) and starches to degrade and collapse, creating cavities or dense lumps inside the bread or even causing it to shrink during or after baking. Rarely, recipes replace some of the water with ale or beer, but this is not necessary to create the characteristic sourdough taste.

Sourdough is almost always used for the base dough, as commercial yeasts are unsuitable. The naturally fermented dough will develop a Lactobacillus culture in symbiotic combination with naturally present yeasts. It is essential in baking rye-based breads because the chemistry of rye flour produces an environment that is acidic. The most commonly present yeast species in the production of naturally leavened dough is Saccharomyces exiguus, which is more acid-tolerant than commercially produced S. cerevisiae, although the latter and other strains may also be present. Research has shown that when creating a naturally fermented starter, any naturally present S. cerevisiae will have died off after a few days. Sourdough is thus a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water. The yeast produces carbon dioxide which leavens the dough, and the bacteria produces lactic acid which contributes flavor. The bacteria metabolizes sugars that the yeast cannot, and the yeast metabolizes byproducts of bacterial fermentation. Commercially produced yeast will not accomplish these processes in rye flour. 

&quot;&quot; contains little or no added oils and is low in fat. Additional flavourings, other than salt, can include barley malt syrup or sugar. The bread is rich in protein and dietary fiber and not very sweet, unlike Swedish and German rye bread.

Buttered is essentially the base for Danish open sandwich .

<text>Victor (died August 388AD) was a Western Roman emperor from either 383/384 or 387 to August 388. He was the son of the &quot;magister militum&quot; Magnus Maximus, who had become a usurper of the Western Roman Empire, in opposition to Gratian. Maximus rose up in 383, and was recognized as the legitimate emperor in the west by Theodosius I. Victor was elevated to &quot;augustus&quot; of the Western Roman Empire in either 383/384 or mid-387, making him co-emperor with his father. Maximus invaded Italy in 387, to depose Valentinian II, the brother and successor of the late Gratian. Because of Maximus&#x27; invasion, Theodosius invaded the Western Empire in 388. Theodosius defeated Maximus in two battles in Pannonia, before crushing his army at Aquilea, and capturing Maximus. Maximus was executed on 28 August 388. His death was followed quickly by that of Victor, who was executed in Trier by the Frankish general Arbogast.

==History==
Flavius Victor was born at an unknown date, to Magnus Maximus, the &quot;magister militum per Gallias&quot; (&#x27;Master of the Soldiers in Gaul&#x27;), and future usurper of the Western Roman Empire. Maximus was declared emperor in July 383AD while in Britain, in opposition to Gratian. Maximus held control over both Gaul and Spain, and was recognized by Theodosius I, the Eastern Roman Emperor, as the true Western Roman Emperor.

Victor was elevated to &quot;augustus&quot; of the Western Roman Empire either 383/384 or mid-387, making him co-emperor with his father Magnus Maximus. It is considered highly likely that Maximus had the intent of establishing a dynasty.

Magnus Maximus invaded Italy in late 387, in order to depose Valentinian II, the brother of Gratian. He gained control of Italy, although he failed to capture Valentinian, who fled to Thessalonica in the Eastern Roman Empire. Once there, Valentinian sent multiple appeals to Theodosius, although for several months they were ignored. Theodosius I then agreed to restore Valentinian II to the throne, although the reasoning for this is disputed. Rufinus says that Valentinian agreed to convert to Orthodoxy, whereas Eunapius says that Valentinian offered his sister, Galla, in marriage to Theodosius, whose wife had recently died, in exchange for assistance in regaining the throne. News that Theodosius was marching to invade the Western Roman Empire arrived in late spring 388, leading Maximus to rush to put together a defence force. His army was defeated twice in Pannonia, at Siscia and Poetovio, before retreating to Italy, where they were crushed in battle on 28 August 388, near Aquilea. During this battle, Maximus himself was captured, and quickly beheaded. Victor, who was still in Gaul, was executed in Trier by the Frankish general Arbogast in the same month.

<text>Gary George Pettis (born April 3, 1958) is an American former professional baseball center fielder and third base coach. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1982 to 1992 for the California Angels, Detroit Tigers, Texas Rangers, and San Diego Padres. Pettis won five Gold Glove Awards and finished in the top ten in stolen bases in the American League seven times.

==Biography==
Pettis was selected in the 6th round of the 1979 draft by the California Angels after attending Castlemont High School in Oakland, California, and played minor league baseball for the Salinas Spurs of the class &quot;A&quot; California League in 1980, then the Holyoke Millers of the double &quot;A&quot; Eastern League in 1981. In 1982, Pettis was promoted to the California Angels, where he played the first six seasons of his career.

After the 1987 season, Pettis went on to play two seasons with the Detroit Tigers, 1988 through the following season of 1989. After two years with Detroit, Pettis joined the Texas Rangers for two seasons, 1990–91. Pettis finished his career in the major leagues in 1992. The 1992 season saw Pettis play for two teams. After leaving the Texas Rangers, Pettis joined the San Diego Padres for the 1992 season but ended that season back in Detroit with the Tigers.
During his career, Pettis consistently hit for low averages and was known for striking out often, but he performed extremely well on defense, earning five Gold Glove Awards. He was noted for making many spectacular leaping or diving catches, depriving hitters of home runs or base hits, and was known in baseball circles as &quot;The man who made center field look easy&quot;. Additionally, he was a prolific base runner and had five seasons where he stole over 40 bases. Pettis held the Angels&#x27; club record for stolen bases for nearly 20 years, until it was broken by Chone Figgins on July 15, 2007. Pettis was tagged as &quot;Pac Man&quot; Pettis by a local radio station listener call-in contest in 1986, referring to his unusual speed in the outfield and ability to chase down opponents&#x27; hits.

On his 1985 Topps baseball card, the person posing in the picture is not Pettis; it is in fact a picture of his younger brother, Lynn.

In 2022, the Astros won 106 games, the second-highest total in franchise history. They advanced to the World Series and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games to give Pettis his second World Series title as an Astro. After the 2024 season, it was announced that the Astros would not renew Pettis&#x27; contract for the 2025 season, ending his tenure with the club.

==Personal life==
His nephew, Austin Pettis, is a former wide receiver for the St. Louis Rams and San Diego Chargers.
Pettis has four children, Paige, Kyler, Shaye, and Dante. Dante plays wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints and set the NCAA record for most career punt return touchdowns while at the University of Washington. Kyler is an actor who appeared on the NBC daytime drama &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.
His brother Stacey Pettis was drafted 94th overall in the 4th round of the 1981 draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates, and played in the Pirates (1981-1984) and Angels (1985-1986) systems. Stacey has worked as a scout for the Seattle Mariners (2001-2016) and St. Louis Cardinals (2018–present).

<doc id="879425" wikidata="Q1584818" url="?curid=879425" title="Kolossi Castle">
<text>Kolossi Castle is a former Crusader stronghold on the south-west edge of Kolossi village west of the city of Limassol on the island of Cyprus. It held great strategic importance in the Middle Ages, and contained large facilities for the production of sugar from the local sugarcane, one of Cyprus&#x27;s main exports in the period. The original castle was possibly built in 1210 by the Frankish military, when the land of Kolossi was given by King Hugh I to the Knights of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (Hospitallers).

The present castle was built in 1454 by the Hospitallers under the Commander of Kolossi, Louis de Magnac, whose coat-of-arms can be seen carved into the castle&#x27;s walls.

Owing to rivalry among the factions in the Crusader Kingdom of Cyprus, the castle was taken by the Knights Templar in 1306, but returned to the Hospitallers in 1313 following the abolition of the Templars.

The castle today consists of a single three-storey square keep, 21m high and with dimensions 17x17m. It has an attached rectangular enclosure or bailey about .

As well as for its sugar, the area is also known for its sweet wine, Commandaria. At the wedding banquet after King Richard the Lionheart&#x27;s marriage to Berengaria of Navarre at nearby Limassol, he allegedly declared it to be the &quot;wine of kings and the king of wines.&quot; It has been produced in the region for millennia, and is thought to be the oldest continually-produced and named wine in the world, known for centuries as &quot;Commandaria&quot; after the Templars&#x27; Grand Commandery there.

==In literature==
Kolossi Castle appears in many works of fiction, including &quot;La milicia de Dios&quot; by the Spanish writer Eduardo García-Ontiveros Cerdeño. It also appears in &quot;Snow Wasted&quot; by the Cypriot author Matthew Malekos and in the novels of several British writers, including &quot;Race of Scorpions: The House of Noccolo&quot; by Dorothy Dunnett, &quot;In Search of Sixpence&quot; by Michael Paraskos and &quot;Lionheart&quot; by  Stewart Binns.

<text>Andrzej Viktor &quot;Andrew&quot; Schally (30 November 1926 – 17 October 2024) was a Polish-American endocrinologist who was a co-recipient, with Roger Guillemin and Rosalyn Sussman Yalow, of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. This award recognized his research in the discovery that the hypothalamus controls hormone production and release by the pituitary gland, which controls the regulation of other hormones in the body. Later in life, Schally utilized his knowledge of hypothalamic hormones to research possible methods for birth control and cancer treatment.

==Life and career==
Andrzej Wiktor Schally was born in Wilno in the Second Polish Republic (now Vilnius, Lithuania), the son of Brigadier General Kazimierz Schally, who was chief of the cabinet of President Ignacy Mościcki of Poland, and Maria (née Łącka).

In September 1939, when Poland was attacked by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Schally escaped with Poland&#x27;s President Ignacy Mościcki, the prime minister and the whole cabinet to the neutral Romania, where they were interned .
&quot;I was fortunate to survive the holocaust while living among the Jewish-Polish Community in Roumania. I used to speak Polish, Roumanian, Yiddish, Italian and some German and Russian, but I have almost completely forgotten them, and my French in which I used to excel is also now far from fluent&quot;.

Immediately after the war, in 1945, Schally moved via Italy and France to the United Kingdom where he changed his first name to Andrew. Schally received his education in Scotland and England. In 1952, he moved to Canada. He received his doctorate in endocrinology from McGill University in 1957. That same year he left for a research career in the United States where he has worked principally at Tulane University. Schally conducted research in endocrinology at the Miami Veteran&#x27;s Administration Medical Center in Miami, Florida. A Canadian citizen when he left Canada, Schally became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1962. He was affiliated with the Baylor College of Medicine for some years in Houston, Texas.

Schally developed a new realm of knowledge concerning the brain&#x27;s control over the body chemistry. Schally explained in his 1977 Nobel Lecture that he, alongside his researchers, dissected 250,000 pig hypothalami in order to isolate 5 mg of the hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) to determine the molecular structure of the hormone. His work also addressed birth control methods and the effects of growth hormones on the body. Together with Roger Guillemin he described the neurohormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) that controls follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), two hormones that are integral parts of reproduction and growth and development.

Schally received an &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctors degree from the Jagiellonian University in Kraków.

Recognized as a Fellow of the Kosciuszko Foundation of Eminent Scientists of Polish Origin and Ancestry.

Schally was married to Margaret Rachel White (divorced), and Ana Maria de Medeiros-Comaru. He died at his home in Miami Beach, Florida, on 17 October 2024, at the age of 97.

==Cancer research==
In 1981, it was demonstrated that the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonistic analogs that Schally had developed between the years of 1972 and 1978 inhibited the growth of prostate cancer in rats. Alongside Dr. George Tolis, Schally conducted the first clinical trial of GnRH for patients with advanced prostate cancer in 1982. This method is now the preferred treatment for advanced prostate carcinoma. About 70% of patients with prostate cancer receive an agonist as their primary method of treatment. According to Schally, his treatment causes fewer side effects than radiation and chemotherapy. The previous method of treatment, orchiectomy or the administration of estrogens, was based on the research of Charles Brenton Huggins.

In 2004, after the death of his wife due to thyroid cancer, Schally found comfort in continuing his research.

<text>Lacquerware are objects decoratively covered with lacquer. Lacquerware includes small or large containers, tableware, a variety of small objects carried by people, and larger objects such as furniture and even coffins painted with lacquer. Before lacquering, the surface is sometimes painted with pictures, inlaid with shell and other materials, or carved. The lacquer can be dusted with gold or silver for example Hirameji and given further decorative treatments.

East Asian countries have long traditions of lacquer work, going back several thousand years in the cases of China, Japan and Korea. The best known lacquer, an urushiol-based lacquer common in East Asia, is obtained from the dried sap of &quot;Toxicodendron vernicifluum.&quot; Other types of lacquers are processed from a variety of plants and insects. The traditions of lacquer work in Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Americas are also ancient and originated independently. True lacquer is not made outside Asia, but some imitations, such as Japanning in Europe, or parallel techniques, are often loosely referred to a &quot;lacquer.&quot;
==East Asia==

The oldest lacquer tree found is from the Jōmon period in Japan, 12600 years ago. The oldest lacquerware in the world, burial ornaments which were created in 9th millennium B.C., were unearthed in early Jomon period tombs, at the Kakinoshima site in Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan.
Various prehistoric lacquerwares have been unearthed in China dating back to the Neolithic period and objects. The earliest known lacquerware in China is thought to be a red wooden bowl, which was unearthed at a Hemudu culture () site in Zhejiang, China.

===Chinese lacquerware===




During the Shang dynasty (ca. 1600–1046 BC) of China, sophisticated lacquer process techniques developed became a highly artistic craft.

During the Eastern Zhou period (771–256 BC), lacquerware began appearing in large quantity. This is the earliest era from which notable quantities of lacquerware have survived, with states, later kingdoms, of Qin and Chu producing the largest number of lacquerware. The state of Chu having the geographical advantage and warmer climates enabled dedicated mass cultivation of lacquer trees and for lacquerware to become a commercial industry. Because of this, Chu-state became famous for its lacquerware exports in the neighbouring states in the Zhou kingdom, with literary references found in books like Zhuangzi and Shangshu, and providing some cultural cross-pollination between the southern culture of Chu and the culture of Zhongyuan.

At the time of the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), special administrations were established to organize and divide labor for the expanding lacquer production in China. Elaborate incised decorations were used in lacquerware during the Han dynasty.

In the Tang dynasty (618–907), Chinese lacquerware saw a new style marked by the use of sheets of gold or silver made in various shapes, such as birds, animals, and flowers. The cut-outs were affixed onto the surface of the lacquerware, after which new layers of lacquer were applied, dried, and then ground away, so the surface could be polished to reveal the golden or silvery patterns beneath. This was done by a technique known as &quot;pingtuo&quot;. Such techniques were time-consuming and costly, but these lacquerware were considered highly refined. It was also the period when the earliest practice of carving lacquerware began.

The art of inlaid gold, silver, and mother-of-pearl continued from the Tang into the Song dynasty (960–1279). Several existing decorative techniques gradually developed further after the 10th century, such as &quot;diaoqi&quot; (carved lacquer) which involves building up layers comprising thinly-applied coats of lacquer and carving it into a three-dimensional design; &quot;qiangjin&quot; (engraved gold) in which fine lines are incised, an adhesive of lacquer is applied, and gold foil or powder is pressed into the grooves; and &quot;diaotian&quot; or &quot;tianqi&quot; (filled-in) in which the lacquer is inlaid with lacquer of another color. A variation of &quot;diaotian&quot; or &quot;tianqi&quot; is known as &quot;moxian&quot; (polish-reveal) in which a design is built up with lacquer in certain areas, the remaining areas are filled with lacquer of a different color, and the entire surface is polished down. Especially the art of inlaying lacquer with mother-of-pearl was intensively developed during the Song dynasty. However, during the Song, the artistic craft also made use of inlaid gold in a process of which is to engrave intricate patterns in the lacquer surface and to fill the intaglio with gold powder.

The knowledge of the Chinese methods of the lacquer process spread from China during the Han, Tang and Song dynasties, eventually it was introduced to Korea, Japan. In Japan, the art of lacquerware-making came along with Buddhism and other cultural artifacts from China via the Korean Peninsula during the 8th century, and carved lacquerware came to Japan from Ming dynasty China during the 14th century. One of the earliest Japanese techniques for decorating the lacquer surface was, besides painting simple designs, the gold and silver foil inlay of the Nara period (710–784). This technique was transmitted from China during the Tang dynasty.

Coromandel lacquer is a Chinese export type, so called because it was shipped to European markets via the Coromandel coast of India.

===Korean lacquerware===

The very term &#x27;Najeonchilgi&#x27; is a combination of two particular words: &#x27;najeon&#x27;– mother-of-pearl and ‘chilgi’ which refers to lacquerware. ‘najeon’ refers to the composite material which forms the inner shiny shell layer.
The Three Kingdom period (57 B.C. – 668 A.D.) witnessed the introduction of the first method and the second one was introduced during the Shilla period (668–935 A.D.). The Goryeo dynasty (918–1392), considered the golden period of this craft, was influenced by Buddhism.

===Japanese lacquerware===
The term for lacquer is &quot;urushi&quot; (漆), source of the English hybrid word &quot;urushiol&quot;. Etymologically, &quot;urushi&quot; may be related to the words &quot;uruwashii&quot; (&quot;beautiful&quot;) or &quot;uruoi&quot; (&quot;watered&quot;, &quot;profitable&quot;, &quot;favored&quot;), due speculatively to their value or shiny appearance, or perhaps the humidifying rooms used in production of lacquered wares. The term &quot;Japanning&quot; in the 17th century is a term for the technique used by Europe to emulate Asian lacquer, derived from the then famous Japanese lacquer.

The general characteristic of Japanese lacquerware is the widespread use of various &quot;Maki-e&quot; techniques compared to other countries. As a result, there are many works in which relatively vivid gold and silver patterns and pictures shine on the black base of lacquerware, and the entire lacquerware is covered with shiny gold and silver grains.

====History and regional production====
Primitive lacquer was used in Japan as early as 12,600 BC, during the Jōmon period.

Lacquer was used in Japan as early as 7000 BCE, during the Jōmon period. Evidence for the earliest lacquerware was discovered at the Kakinoshima &quot;B&quot; Excavation Site in Hokkaido. These objects were discovered in a pit grave dating from the first half of the Initial Jōmon period (approx. 9,000 years ago) Japanese lacquering technology may have been invented by the Jōmon. They learned to refine &quot;urushi&quot; (poison oak sap) – the process taking several months. Iron oxide (colcothar) and cinnabar (mercury sulfide) were used for producing red lacquer. Lacquer was used both on pottery, and on different types of wooden items. In some cases, burial clothes for the dead were also lacquered. Many lacquered objects have turned up during the Early Jōmon period; this indicates that this was an established part of Jōmon culture. Experts are divided on whether Jōmon lacquer was derived from Chinese techniques, or invented independently. For example, Mark Hudson believes that “Jomon lacquer technology was developed independently in Japan rather than being introduced from China as once believed”.

During the Asuka and Nara periods, between the 7th and 8th centuries, Chinese lacquer art forms were imported to Japan.
In the Heian period (794–1185), various &quot;Maki-e&quot; techniques characteristic of Japanese lacquerware were developed. While the method of drawing designs with a brush by dissolving gold powder in lacquer is a common technique in other countries, the method of drawing designs with lacquer and then sprinkling gold, silver, or copper powder of various sizes and shapes on top to polish them was developed in Japan. This made it possible to make the gold and silver of lacquerware brighter than before.

In the Kamakura period (1185–1333), carved lacquer from the Song dynasty of China was imported to Japan. However, many Japanese lacquer craftsmen did not adopt the Chinese method of depositing lacquer and then carving it; instead, they created Kamakurabori, a method of carving wood and then coating lacquer.
Japanese lacquerware was abundantly exported to China where the Ming and Qing rulers generally described Japanese lacquerwares as &quot; foreign lacquer &quot; ( yangqi ). Yang Ming, and famous lacquer man Zhejiang, made annotations for A Record of Decoration with Lacquer, ... People of the Ming dynasty once recorded: “The decoration art with lacquer coated with gold originated (maki-e) from Japan&quot;. Yang in the reign of Xuande of the Ming dynasty made a trip to Japan to study Japanese techniques, and a Japanese visited a Chinese imperial workshop in Beijing during the Ming dynasty. It is well documented that the Yongzheng Emperor had a formidable interest in Japanese lacquer, &quot;yangqi&quot;, and this was reflected in many of the works produced in the Imperial workshops during his reign. In the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568–1600) also made its way into Colonial Mexico (Manila Galleons) and Europe by Nanban trade. Japanese lacquerware attracted European aristocrats and missionaries from Europe, and western style chests and church furniture were exported in response to their requests.
The Edo period (1603–1868) saw an increase in the focused cultivation of lacquer trees and the development of the techniques used. In the 18th century colored lacquers came into wider use. With the development of economy and culture, the artistic quality of lacquered furniture has improved. Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu and Ogata Kōrin brought the designs of the Rinpa school of painting into lacquerware. From the middle of the Edo period, &quot;inro&quot; became popular as men&#x27;s accessories, and wealthy merchants of the &quot;chōnin&quot; class and samurai class collected &quot;inro&quot; of high aesthetic value, precisely designed with lacquer. Marie Antoinette and Maria Theresa are known collectors of Japanese lacquerware and their collections are now often exhibited in the Louvre and the Palace of Versailles.

In the Meiji period (1868–1912), Richly-decorated lacquerwares in original designs were popular domestically, and even more so with Western buyers during this period of European and American fascination with Japanese art. Shibata Zeshin&#x27;s lacquer work was especially popular. In addition, lacquerware called &quot;Shibayama&quot;, which was created in the Edo period, became popular for its showy style, inlaid with gold, silver, shellfish, ivory, coral, tortoise shell and ceramics, and reached its peak during this period. Lacquerware called &quot;Somada&quot;, which was created in the Edo period and characterized by regular patterns of finely cut seashells, gold leaf and silver leaf, also became popular during this period. The government took an active interest in the art export market, promoting Japan&#x27;s lacquers and other decorative arts at a succession of world&#x27;s fairs. Lacquer from Japanese workshops was recognised as technically superior to what could be produced anywhere else in the world.

Today, the Japanese government has designated excellent lacquer artists as Living National Treasures and is encouraging them to make lacquerware. Lacquerware is produced throughout the Japanese archipelago, with many regional techniques and variations. Besides the very old Kamakura tradition mentioned above (and still alive today), the port town of Wajima provides a good example of regional lacquerware. &quot;Wajima-nuri&quot;, dating back to the 16th century, is characterized by use of the elm-like Japanese zelkova (&quot;keyaki&quot; 欅), powdered earth, and delicate features formed from cloth. (See the Japanese article, 輪島塗. A more complete list of regional lacquer traditions is available in the Japanese article.)


====Ryukyuan lacquerware====
Ryukyuan lacquerware is one of the chief artistic products of the Ryukyu Islands (today Okinawa Prefecture of Japan); it is quite distinct from the lacquerware found among the surrounding cultures. Nevertheless, Chinese and Japanese influences are present.
==Southeast Asia==
===Burmese lacquerware===
&quot;Yun-de&quot; is lacquerware in Burmese, and the art is called &quot;Pan yun&quot; (). The lacquer is the sap tapped from the varnish tree or &quot;Thitsee&quot; (&quot;Gluta usitata&quot;, syn. &quot;Melanorrhoea usitata&quot;) that grows wild in the forests of Myanmar (formerly Burma). It is straw-colored but turns black on exposure to air. When brushed in or coated on, it forms a hard glossy smooth surface resistant to a degree from the effects of exposure to moisture or heat.

====History====
The earliest fragments of lacquerware basketry found in Bagan dates back to the 13th century. Evidence for older lacquerware in Bagan remains inconclusive.

Bayinnaung&#x27;s conquest and subjugation in 1555–1562 of Manipur, Bhamo, Zinme (Chiang Mai), Linzin (Lan Xang), and up the Taping and Shweli rivers in the direction of Yunnan brought back large numbers of skilled craftsmen into Burma. It is thought that the finer sort of Burmese lacquerware, called Yun, was introduced during this period by imported artisans belonging to the Yun or Northern Thai people of the Chiang Mai region.

====Manufacture and design====

Lacquer vessels, boxes and trays have a coiled or woven bamboo-strip base often mixed with horsehair. The thitsee may be mixed with ashes or sawdust to form a putty-like substance called &quot;thayo&quot; which can be sculpted. The object is coated layer upon layer with thitsee and thayo to make a smooth surface, polished and engraved with intricate designs, commonly using red, green and yellow colors on a red or black background. &quot;Shwezawa&quot; is a distinctive form in its use of gold leaf to fill in the designs on a black background.

Palace scenes, scenes from the Jataka tales, and the signs of the Burmese Zodiac are popular designs and some vessels may be encrusted with glass mosaic or semi-precious stones in gold relief. The objects are all handmade and the designs and engraving done free-hand. It may take three to four months to finish a small vessel but perhaps over a year for a larger piece. The finished product is a result of teamwork and not crafted by a single person.

====Forms====
The most distinctive vessel is probably a rice bowl on a stem with a spired lid for monks called &quot;hsun ok&quot;. &quot;Lahpet ok&quot; is a shallow dish with a lid and has a number of compartments for serving &quot;lahpet&quot; (pickled tea) with its various accompaniments. Stackable tiffin carriers fastened with a single handle or &quot;hsun gyaink&quot; are usually plain red or black. &quot;Daunglan&quot; are low tables for meals and may be simple broad based or have three curved feet in animal or floral designs with a lid. Water carafes or &quot;yeidagaung&quot; with a cup doubling as a lid, and vases are also among lacquerware still in use in many monasteries.

Various round boxes with lids, small and large, are known as &quot;yun-it&quot; including ones for paan called &quot;kun-it&quot; (; betel boxes). &quot;Yun titta&quot; are rectangular boxes for storing various articles including &quot;peisa&quot; or palm leaf manuscripts when they are called &quot;sadaik titta&quot;. Pedestal dishes or small trays with a stem with or without a lid are known as &quot;kalat&quot; for serving delicacies or offering flowers to royalty or the Buddha. Theatrical troupes and musicians have their lacquerware in costumes, masks, head-dresses, and musical instruments, some of them stored and carried in lacquer trunks. Boxes in the shape of a pumpkin or a bird such as the owl, which is believed to bring luck, or the &quot;hintha&quot; (Brahminy duck) are common too. Screens and small polygonal tables are also made for the tourist trade today.

====Industry====
Bagan is the major centre for the lacquerware industry where the handicraft has been established for nearly two centuries, and still practiced in the traditional manner. Here a government school of lacquerware was founded in the 1920s. Since plastics, porcelain and metal have superseded lacquer in most everyday utensils, it is today manufactured in large workshops mainly for tourists who come to see the ancient temples of Bagan. At the village of Kyaukka near Monywa in the Chindwin valley, however, sturdy lacquer utensils are still produced for everyday use mainly in plain black.

A decline in the number of visitors combined with the cost of resin, which has seen a 40-fold rise in 15 years, has led to the closure of over two-thirds of more than 200 lacquerware workshops in Bagan.

===Vietnamese lacquer painting and lacquerware===


&quot;Sơn mài&quot; is a painting technique in Vietnam. It developed from the painters of the Hanoi EBAI in the 1930s and today is counted a national painting style with many famous painters.

In 1924 the Ecole des Beaux Arts was established in Hanoi. This institution was to be the birthplace of the revitalised art of lacquer painting. In 1934 the school opened its lacquer department and it was from here that well known contributors to the art including; Bui Trang Chuoc, Nguyen Van Binh, Nguyen Khang, Nguyen Duc Nung, Nguyen Tien Chung, and Pham Van Don would emerge.

It was the first generation of Vietnamese students of the Indochina School of Fine Art during the 1930s, who elevated the craft of lacquer painting to a truly fine art. Less interested in decor than their craftsmen predecessors, it was also these men who would begin a series of artistic innovations from which craftsmen producing purely utilitarian or decorative pieces would also benefit.

Creating images with crushed eggshell, painting pigment over gold and tin foil and adding sand to lacquer were all techniques developed by those first students. The metallic color lacquerware for which Vietnamese craftsmen are rightly famous, was first developed by artists experimenting with many innovative techniques.

After the reunification, the art of lacquerware was slowly dying out in Vietnam. But since the 1980s, the government has recognized it as a vital cultural and economic force and has encouraged the business community to invest in the craft. As a result, we see a resurgence of lacquerware and a proliferation of lacquerware products from Vietnam.

==South Asia==
In India, the insect lac or shellac was used since ancient times. Shellac is the secretion of the lac bug (&quot;Tachardia lacca&quot; Kerr. or &quot;Laccifer lacca&quot;). It is used for wood finish, lacquerware, skin cosmetic, ornaments, dye for textiles, production of different grades of shellac for surface coating. The Atharvaveda text 1200 BCE – 1000 BCE devotes a chapter to &#x27;lākshā&#x27; and its various uses.

==Americas==
===Barniz de Pasto technique===
Barniz de Pasto (es) is a lacquer-like varnish technique originating in the Pre-Columbian era that is a specialty of Pasto, Colombia. It is made by chewing the resin of the Andean mopa-mopa shrub (&quot;Elaeagia pastoensis&quot;) into thin layers, and then painting it and applying it to a wood, metal, clay or glass surface using heated stones. Historically, the technique was applied to wooden &quot;s&quot;, drinking vessels.

===Mexican lacquerware===
Known in Mexican Spanish as &quot;laca&quot; or &quot;maque&quot; (from Japanese &quot;maki-e&quot;), Mexican lacquer has independent origins from Asian lacquer. In the pre-Hispanic period, a substance from the larvae of aje scale insects and/or oil from the chia seed were mixed with powdered minerals to create protective coatings and decorative designs. During this period, the process was almost always applied to dried gourds, especially to make the cups that Mesoamerican nobility drank chocolate from.

After the Conquest, the Spanish had indigenous craftsmen apply the technique to European style furniture and other items, changing the decorative motifs and color schemes, but the process and materials remained mostly the same. Asian lacquerware and artisans brought by the &quot;Nao de China&quot; also had an influence on the style and motifs of colonial Mexican lacquerware. Today, workshops creating lacquerware are limited to Olinalá, Temalacatzingo and Acapetlahuaya in the state of Guerrero, Uruapan and Pátzcuaro in Michoacán and Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas. The most popular modern lacquerware are small boxes, sometimes known as &quot;cajitas de Olinalá&quot;.

<text>Titan: The Fighting Fantasy World is a book in the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series of children&#x27;s role-playing gamebooks, first published by Puffin Books in 1986. Although credited to Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, it was actually written by Marc Gascoigne (credited as editor), although mostly based on locations, characters and events already described in other books in the series (including Jackson&#x27;s and Livingstone&#x27;s). It is written in the manner of an encyclopedia about the fantasy world of Titan, in which the majority of &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebooks are set.

==Summary==
The book was first published in size 21 by 30 centimetres, with colour illustrations inside the covers. A smaller edition (with more pages) was published in 1989 without the colour illustrations. There was a new edition as an e-book by Arion Games in 2011.

The cover was by Chris Achilleos, and is still available to buy as a poster. The black-and-white internal illustrations and maps are by John Blanche (who also contributed one of the internal colour illustrations), Paul Bonner, Leo Hartas, Bob Harvey, Bill Houston, Alan Langford, Steve Luxton, Iain McCaig, Russ Nicholson, Wil Rees, John Sibbick, and Gary Ward.

After a foreword by Jackson and Livingstone, the rest of the book deals with the following topics:
*The three continents of the fictional world of Titan
*Astronomy (the stars visible from Titan)
*History and legend
*Gods, demons and hell
*The various humanoid species who live there (such as elves, dwarves, snake people, lizard men)
*Notable individuals (good, evil and neutral)
*Underwater kingdoms
*Titan&#x27;s calendars
*Money and trade
*A description of life on Titan

===Geography===
The fictional world of Titan is the setting for the majority of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; titles. There are three main continents: Allansia, Khul and The Old World, and other remote locations such as the Isles of the Dawn and Arrowhead Islands.

Allansia is apparently the largest continent and the setting for many of the earliest &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; titles. The first Fighting Fantasy gamebook, &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot;, was set in the titular mountain in Allansia. In the far north of the continent are the desolate Icefinger Mountains (the location for the book &quot;Caverns of the Snow Witch&quot;) South of these mountains is the city-state of Fang, (location for the book &quot;Deathtrap Dungeon&quot;). Further south are the Pagan Plains, which stretch from the lawless city-state of Port Blacksand in the west ( location of &quot;City of Thieves&quot;) to the monster-haunted Darkwood Forest, to the prosperous city of Salamonis. To the east lie the desolate plains of the Flatlands. In the northeast of the continent is Sardath, a city built on stilts over a lake. Further east is Frostholm, a kingdom inhabited by Dwarfs. South of Port Blacksand lies the Desert of Skulls, home to the lost city of Vatos. Further south lies the region of Arantis. The capital of Arantis is the city of Kaynlesh-Ma, a centre of learning which sits on the River Eltus. Arantis is bordered by two regions that are home to human-hating powers. These are the Snakelands, ruled by a snake-like race, the Caarth; and the Swamplands of Silur Cha, home of the Lizard Men. The Lizard Men in this region are constantly besieging the human city of Vymorna, northwest of Silur Cha. Nearby is the Plain of Bones, home to numerous dinosaurs, and the almost impassable Mountains of Grief. Southwards is Kallamehr, a city of wealthy merchants. The majority of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; books are set in Allansia.

West of Allansia lies the &quot;Old World&quot; continent. The Old World is a largely civilized land mass which escaped the cataclysmic wars that devastated the other continents of Titan. It is divided into several kingdoms. The eastern land of Kakhabad is the setting for the &quot;Sorcery!&quot; series. South of Kakhabad is Analand, a kingdom protected by a Great Wall. Analand&#x27;s economy is based on mining and forestry; Lake Libra in Analand is regarded as sacred and attracts pilgrims from all over the Old World. North of Kakhabad is the religious nation of Ruddlestone. West of Ruddlestone is the nation of Brice, a autocratic nation regularly at war with its neighbours. South of Brice is Mauristatia, a wild region haunted by vampires and werewolves. In the west of the Old World are the nation-states Femphrey and Gallantaria. Gallantaria is a nation mainly populated by peasants and merchants; its capital, Royal Lendle, is noted as a centre of learning. Gallantaria is bordered by the Northlands, a remote region often at war with Gallantaria. Femphrey is a wealthy kingdom known for agriculture and crystal mining. Femphrey is bordered on the south by the poverty-stricken kingdom of Lendleland.

Khul is a continent to the south of the other two. It is named &quot;the Dark Continent&quot;, both due to its remoteness from the other continents and the dark blackish colour of its earth and rocks. Central Khul is dominated by the Wastes of Chaos, a huge internal desert. Founts of raw Chaos magic in the Wastes cause most of the creatures there to mutate horribly. Western Khul is ruled by the Ximoran Protectorate, an alliance of several city-states centered on the city of Ximoran. At the edge of the Protectorate is the &quot;peaceful and prosperous&quot; town of Neuburg, bordering the Cloudhigh Mountains. Southern Khul is dominated by the barren Scythera Desert and the Inland Sea, the latter region being home to numerous pirates. The Inland Sea is bordered by the almost uncrossable Shios’ii Mountains. Over these mountains is the kingdom of Hachiman, ruled by the Shogun. Hachiman is the setting for the gamebook &quot;Sword of the Samurai&quot;, and is modelled on Feudal Japan.

===Characters===
&quot;Titan&quot; is not a novel, but it describes various characters and their biographies. Many of them are characters who had already appeared in gamebooks (usually the main opponent who has to be defeated at the end of each book), but some were taken from &quot;Warlock&quot; magazine or were invented by Gascoigne for this book.

Characters encountered in gamebooks who appear in &quot;Titan&quot; include:
*Zagor (from &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot;)
*Balthus Dire (from &quot;The Citadel of Chaos&quot;)
*Yaztromo (from &quot;The Forest of Doom&quot;)
*Baron Sukumvit (from &quot;Deathtrap Dungeon&quot;)
*Shareella (from &quot;Caverns of the Snow Witch&quot;)
*Malbordus (from &quot;Temple of Terror&quot;)
*The Archmage (from &quot;The Crown of Kings&quot;)
*Zharradan Marr (from &quot;Creature of Havoc&quot;)

==Reviews==
Reviewing &quot;Titan&quot; in &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #84, Graeme Davis said that &quot;the contents are impressive&quot;, and stated that the book had a &quot;wealth of rich background information&quot;. He also said &quot;the whole thing is beautifully produced and lavishly illustrated&quot;, and concluded his review by saying &quot;Titan&quot; was &quot;probably the best value around in fantasy RPG source books&quot;.

<text>Alexander I, commonly known as Alexander the Good (; – 1 January 1432) was Voivode of Moldavia between 1400 and 1432. He was the son of Roman I and succeeded Iuga to the throne. As ruler he initiated a series of reforms while consolidating the status of the Principality of Moldavia.

== Reign ==

=== Internal politics ===
Alexander expanded the bureaucratic system by creating the &quot;Council of the Voivode&quot;, the Chancellory and by adding (in 1403) the institution of Logofăt – Chancellor of the official Chancellery.

During his reign, he introduced new fiscal laws by adding commercial privileges to the traders of Lviv (1408) and Kraków (1409), improved the situation of trading routes (especially the one linking the port of Cetatea Albă to Poland), strengthened the forts by guarding them and expanded the Moldavian ports of Cetatea Albă and Chilia.

He also had a role in ending the conflict between the Moldavian Orthodox Church and the Patriarch of Constantinople. He built the Bistrița Monastery, where he is buried, and continued the building of the Neamț Monastery, which was started in the previous century.

Alexander made the first documented confirmation of gypsy slavery in Moldavia, giving Bistrița Monastery 31 gypsy families along with some cattle.

=== Foreign affairs ===
The main concern of Alexander the Good was to defend the country in wars against superior armies. In order to do that, he forged a system of alliances with Wallachia and Poland, generally against Hungary (although he had been backed to the throne by Sigismund of Hungary). In 1402, he was sworn vassal of Jogaila, the King of Poland. The treaty was renewed in 1404, 1407, 1411, and 1415.

Alexander participated in two battles against the Teutonic Knights: the Battle of Grunwald and the Siege of Marienburg. In 1420, he also, with the help of Poland, defended Moldavia against the first incursion by the Ottomans at Cetatea Albă. He also got involved in the power struggles of Wallachia by helping Radu II Prasnaglava in 1418 to 1419 and helping Alexandru I Aldea in 1429, mostly in order to prevent the capture of Chilia.

Due to a territorial claim of Poland and the previous failure of the Polish king to fulfill his part of the vassalic treaty during an Ottoman attack in 1420, Alexander launched an attack on Poland during the Lithuanian Civil War. The attack ended with the Treaty of Suceava on 18 November 1431.

== Personal life ==
Alexander had a number of wives: Margareta Bánffy de Losoncz, Ana Jagiellon of Podolsk, Rimgailė (daughter of Kęstutis and sister of Vytautas the Great; divorced in 1421). He had several children, including Iliaș, Petru III, Stephen II, Peter Aaron, and Bogdan II.

He died on 1 January 1432 and was buried in Bistriţa Monastery.

<text>Helen Francesca Traubel (June 16, 1899July 28, 1972) was an American opera and concert singer. A dramatic soprano, she was best known for her Wagnerian roles, especially those of Brünnhilde and Isolde.

Born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, she began her career as a concert singer and went on to sing at the Metropolitan Opera from 1937 to 1953. Starting in the 1950s, she also developed a career as a nightclub and cabaret singer as well as appearing in television, films and musical theatre. Traubel spent her later years in Santa Monica, California, where she died at the age of 73.

==Early life==
Traubel was born in St. Louis, Missouri to a prosperous family of German descent. She was the daughter of Otto Ferdinand Traubel, a pharmacist, and Clara Traubel (&quot;née&quot; Stuhr). She studied singing in her native city with Louise Vetta-Karst and later in New York City with Giuseppe Boghetti among other teachers. She made her debut as a concert singer with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra in 1923, and in 1926 she received an offer to join the Metropolitan Opera company after performing the &quot;Liebestod&quot; from Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; at the Lewisohn Stadium under conductor Rudolph Ganz. She turned down the Met&#x27;s offer in order to continue with her studies and career as a concert singer.

==Opera career==
On May 12, 1937, Traubel made her debut appearance on the opera stage, after composer Walter Damrosch asked her to sing the role of Mary Rutledge in the world premiere of his opera &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera. She made her debut with the Chicago City Opera Company later that year, appearing there until the company went bankrupt in 1939. In 1940, she joined the roster of the Chicago Opera Company, remaining a member of that company until it too went bankrupt in 1946. She made her debut with the San Francisco Opera as Brünnhilde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; on October 9, 1945, with Lauritz Melchior as Siegmund, Margaret Harshaw as Fricka, and William Steinberg conducting; she made several further appearances there during 1945 and 1947.

Since the Metropolitan already had two first-class Wagnerian sopranos, Kirsten Flagstad and Marjorie Lawrence, Traubel at first had difficulty finding her niche at the Met. Her debut as a regular member of the company was as Sieglinde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; in 1939, the only standard role which she had previously sung, at the Chicago Opera. Flagstad left the US in 1941 to visit her homeland of Norway and could not return due to the war in Europe. The same year, Lawrence was stricken with polio and her career was curtailed.

On February 22, 1941, Arturo Toscanini conducted Traubel and tenor Lauritz Melchior in excerpts from Wagnerian operas, including act 1, scene 3 of &quot;Die Walküre&quot; on the live radio broadcast concert of the NBC Symphony Orchestra. RCA Victor later released recordings of excerpts from the concert, as well as a classic studio recording of Traubel in Brünnhilde&#x27;s Immolation Scene from &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;. Traubel later triumphed in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. She was renowned for her powerful voice, which was often described as a &quot;gleaming sword&quot;; her endurance and purity of tone were unsurpassed, especially as Brünnhilde and Isolde. Although she longed to sing Italian opera, she never appeared in an Italian opera performance onstage, although she often included Italian arias and songs in her recital repertoire. Towards the end of her career at the Met, she added the Marschallin in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; briefly to her repertoire.

In 1948, while her Met career was at its height, US President Harry S. Truman contracted her to act as an &quot;advisor&quot; to his daughter, Margaret, who was hoping to launch a career as a classical singer. Traubel&#x27;s 1959 autobiography, &quot;St. Louis Woman&quot;, contains an account of the three years she spent in the role, and how in the end she felt it had adversely affected her stature in the music world to have her name associated with &quot;such a musical aspirant&quot; of questionable talent.

Traubel&#x27;s association with the Metropolitan Opera ended in 1953; General Manager Rudolf Bing chose not to renew her contract after expressing disapproval of her radio and TV appearances alongside the likes of Jimmy Durante, and her wish to expand her lucrative career in major supper and night clubs. Traubel went on to appear at the Copacabana, as well as in many cameo television roles. After her Met career, she appeared on Broadway in the Rodgers and Hammerstein financial failure, &quot;Pipe Dream&quot;, playing a bordello madame with a heart of gold and the voice of Isolde. Additionally, she appeared in the films &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot;, &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; and &quot;Gunn&quot;. She also appeared opposite Groucho Marx as Katisha in a Bell Telephone presentation in an abridged performance of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot;. Traubel&#x27;s last night club appearance was with Jimmy Durante at Harrah&#x27;s Lake Tahoe in 1964.

==Personal life==
A baseball fan, Traubel was once the part owner of her hometown team, the St. Louis Browns. She wrote a mystery short story, &quot;The Ptomaine Canary,&quot; which was serialized in US newspapers via Associated Press) in 1950. A full-length follow-up, &quot;The Metropolitan Opera Murders&quot; (1951), was ghostwritten by Harold Q. Masur and features a soprano heroine, Elsa Vaughan, who helps solve the mystery.

Her later years were devoted to caring for her second husband and former business manager, William L. Bass, whom she had married in 1938. (Her first husband, was Louis Franklin Carpenter, a St. Louis car salesman. The couple married in 1922 but soon separated.) Traubel died of a heart attack in Santa Monica, California, aged 73, and was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

For her contribution to the recording industry, Traubel has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6422 Hollywood Blvd. In 1994 she was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

<text>Farncombe, historically Fernecome, is a village and peripheral settlement of Godalming in Waverley, Surrey, England and is approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 km) north-east of the Godalming centre, separated by common land known as the &quot;Lammas Lands&quot;. The village of Compton lies to the northwest and Bramley to the east; whilst Charterhouse School is to the west. Loseley Park, in the hamlet of Littleton, lies to the north of the village.

==History==

The earliest evidence of human activity is an early Anglo-Saxon spearhead, found in 1985. Farncombe appears in the Domesday Book as &quot;Fearnecombe&quot;, thought to mean &quot;valley of the ferns&quot;. In 1086, it was held by the Bishop of Bayeux. Its Domesday assets were: 2 ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth 3 hogs. It rendered £1 4s 0d.

Among the oldest buildings in the village is a row of almshouses, built in 1622 for Richard Wyatt, the Master Carpenter of the Carpenters&#x27; Company in London. Farncombe Infants&#x27; School, on Grays Road, near the railway station was built by subscription in 1905 and was originally a boys&#x27; school. It was a mixed infants&#x27; school from 1935, and became a junior school in 1975 with an annexe for the infants school.

==Governance==
Farncombe is part of one of the five wards that make up the town of Godalming. Farncombe is within the census area &quot;Godalming Farncombe and Catteshall (Ward)&quot; which had a population of 4600 in 2011.

<doc id="879472" wikidata="Q1688150" url="?curid=879472" title="Jesse Ferguson">
<text>Jesse Ferguson (born March 20, 1957) is a retired American boxer who was a Heavyweight title challenger and top contender who Beat undisputed Heavyweight world champion Buster Douglas, Heavyweight world champion Ray Mercer and Cruiserweight world champion Tyrone Booze. His professional career is filled with matches with champions and contenders and his name is linked with numerous boxing stars of the 1980s and 1990s.

==Early years==
Ferguson grew up in rural Knightdale, North Carolina, one of 13 children of a tobacco farm workers William and Jesse Ferguson.

==Military service==
Ferguson took up boxing at the age of 22, while serving with the U.S. Marines.

==Professional career==
After an amateur career in the early 80s, Ferguson turned pro in 1983 at the age of 25. He had 10 straight wins (all by knockout), the most notable being a 4-round knockout of Reggie Gross. To supplement his meager boxing earnings, Jesse Ferguson was working as a construction worker and a security guard.

This earned him a place in ESPN&#x27;s 1985 Young Heavyweight tournament. He made a debut with a 4-round knockout of Richard Scott, and followed it up in the semi-finals with a 10-round points win where he outpunched James &quot;Buster&quot; Douglas, a fight that would become more significant over the years, as Douglas went on to upset Mike Tyson in 1990 and win the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world. In the final he took on Tony Anthony and knocked him out in the 10th round, earning himself a world ranking.

His success was short-lived however. He was matched up with Carl &quot;The Truth&quot; Williams, who was himself coming off a disputed 15-round points loss to Larry Holmes. Williams&#x27; experience won out, as he climbed off the floor twice to knock out Ferguson in 10 rounds.

Ferguson was employed as a sparring partner for Mike Tyson, Razor Ruddock, Lennox Lewis, and Michael Moorer.

===Tyson fight===
In a theme that would continue throughout his long career, Ferguson was matched tough in his next fight. In 1986 he took on prospect Mike Tyson who was 17–0, and making his national television debut. Tyson broke Ferguson&#x27;s nose in the fifth round with an uppercut, sending him to the canvas. Referee Luis Rivera disqualified Ferguson in the next round, for what he deemed &quot;excessive holding.&quot; The local commission later changed the result to a &quot;TKO&quot; for Tyson.

===Journeyman===
From this point on Ferguson became a part-time boxer, finding it difficult to find meaningful fights but used regularly by all the top contenders as a sparring partner, who preferred training with him than risking fighting him. In 1987 he fought only once, on the undercard of the Tyson/Tucker fight, knocking out ex-contender George Chaplin, sending him into retirement. In 1988 he fought 22-0 Orlin Norris for his NABF belt. Norris was a fast-rising prospect with slick skills and some big wins under his belt already. Ferguson&#x27;s ring rust showed as he was outpointed over 12 dull rounds.

It may be said that by this point Ferguson&#x27;s heart was no longer fully in the game. By the time he fought Oliver McCall in 1991, he had only had one fight in three years, a 6-round kayo of Terry Armstrong in 1990. Although rusty and overweight, Ferguson appeared to get the better of McCall. However Ferguson had been relegated to &#x27;trial horse&#x27; status and McCall was given the decision. Three years later in 1994, McCall would knockout Lennox Lewis in two rounds to become heavyweight champion of the world. In 1992 he took on Bruce Seldon where an indifferent Ferguson retired after five rounds with an eye injury. Three years later, Seldon would win the vacant WBA heavyweight title.

Ferguson dropped decisions to two ex-world champions, Michael &quot;Dynamite&quot; Dokes and Tony &quot;TNT&quot; Tubbs, but in 1993 would see a turnaround of his fortunes.

===Upset, controversy and title shot===

On February 6, 1993, Ferguson fought on the untelevised undercard of an HBO event at Madison Square Garden in New York. Ferguson was signed to fight Ray Mercer, a former World Boxing Organization world Heavyweight champion, in what was actually a heavyweight title eliminator but was regarded by many as a tune up for Mercer for a potential second shot at a world championship. The winner of the bout was to face the winner of the main event between reigning WBA and IBF champion Riddick Bowe and former champion Michael Dokes for the titles at a future date. Ferguson, however, defied the odds and defeated an underprepared Mercer by a unanimous decision to earn his shot against Bowe, who knocked out Dokes in the first round.

The win over Mercer proved controversial as Mercer was later investigated for allegedly trying to bribe Ferguson to let Mercer win the bout.

The world championship fight with Bowe was signed for May 22, 1993, and was staged at RFK Stadium in Washington, DC. Ferguson came into the fight below 230 pounds for the first time in years and was considered to be in the best shape of his career. Because the IBF did not consider Ferguson to be a legitimate contender, they would not sanction the defense for Bowe and only the WBA and lineal championships were on the line. Ferguson thought he had a legitimate chance to knock the champion out, but Bowe disregarded his boasts. Ferguson was knocked down toward the end of the first round and barely made it back to his feet at the bell, then was dropped again as the second round began and knocked out.

===Remainder of pro career===
Despite the defeat, Ferguson was back in the ring shortly afterwards. He was matched against Mercer yet again, who this time came in shape at 223. Although the fight was closer, Ferguson still appeared to outpunch Mercer and get the better of him. Once again Ferguson was on the wrong end of a close decision as Mercer was awarded a split decision that was even jeered by his hometown crowd at Atlantic City. In 1994 Ferguson travelled to the U.K. to fight Frank Bruno, who was returning after his loss to Lennox Lewis. The overweight Ferguson collapsed in one round in a passionless performance. A year later Bruno would outpoint Oliver McCall and win the WBC heavyweight title.

In his only other fight in 1994 Ferguson was matched with Larry Holmes, the 44-year-old former great who was on another comeback trail. Ferguson despite being out of shape had Holmes reeling in the second, and appeared to get the best of the ex-champ. Yet again Ferguson was on the wrong side of the points decision, and even the New York Times reported it as: &quot;A robbery. Larry Holmes came off second-best against Jesse Ferguson.&quot; By 1995 Ferguson was frequently out of shape and made little effort in his fights. He had Jeremy Williams out on his feet but quit in the 7th with a swollen eye. He dropped Alex Stewart twice but was denied the decision. He did nothing against Danell Nicholson and pulled out after 8 rounds. In all three fights he looked distinctly uninterested.

===Return to form===
In 1996 he was hired as chief sparring partner for champion Mike Tyson in the lead-up to his fight with Bruce Seldon. It was during this time, with a little encouragement from Team Tyson, Ferguson began to realise he was better than he gave himself credit for.

He returned late in 1996, now aged 39, and beat undefeated Bobby Harris. He followed this up with two more wins before a high-profile fight on HBO with Tongan Samson Po&#x27;uha, in 1997. He decked Po&#x27;uha several times before knocking him out in the 8th round.

This led to another big fight on HBO in 1998, where a now 40-year-old Ferguson took on young and undefeated powerful punching contender Hasim Rahman for the USBA belt. Ferguson lost by decision. Rahman would go on to defeat Lennox Lewis and become the Heavyweight Champion of the World.

Ferguson followed up the Rahman fight with a 10-round decision win over ex-cruiserweight champ Tyrone Booze. He then took on Obed Sullivan, ranked No. 4 in the world, and won an upset decision.

In 1999 Jimmy Thunder, citing an injury, dropped out of a fight with Polish contender Andrew Golota. Ferguson was tapped as Thunder&#x27;s replacement and accepted the bout on short notice; he lost the fight by decision.

After this loss Ferguson&#x27;s manager handed him back his contract and stopped answering his calls. Ferguson could no longer find fights. His career ended in 1999 with a record of 26-18-0 with 16 knockouts.

Ferguson spoke of comebacks in 2000 and 2002 but each time nothing came of them. He complained of being &quot;blackballed&quot; by the boxing establishment.

<text>Mahbubul Haque Khan (28 February 1950 – 5 June 2011), known as Azam Khan, was a Bangladeshi singer-songwriter, record producer, and lead singer for the pop-rock band Uccharon. He was also a freedom fighter who took part in the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971. He is considered to be one of the greatest artists in the history of Bangladeshi folk music and a founding figure of Bangla rock.

Born and raised in Dhaka, he had been interested in music since childhood and would later begin his music career with Trinity Artist Group in 1967. He took part in the 1969 mass uprising against the Pakistani military, which resulted in the resignation of Pakistan&#x27;s president, Ayub Khan among other concessions to protesters.

In 1971, inspired by his father, he and his brothers took part in the Liberation War of Bangladesh. He was trained in Meghaloy, India. He fought in Sector 2, under Major Khaled Mosharraf. In mid-December, 1971 he came back from the training camps and restarted his music career. He founded the pioneering rock band Uchcharon, along with his friends Nilu (lead guitar) and Mansoor (rhythm guitar), and Sadek (drums). They first appeared on Bangladesh Television in 1972. They achieved commercial success with the hit &quot;Rail Liner Oi Bostite&quot; in 1975. This was followed up with more hit songs in the 1970s, like &quot;&quot;Alal ar Dulal&quot;, &quot;Saleka Maleka&quot; and &quot;Papri Keno Bojhena&quot;&quot;.

In 2019, he was posthumously awarded the second highest civilian honour award, Ekushey Padak, in recognition of his contribution to the music industry. He has been dubbed &quot;The Pop Samrat&quot; (The Pop Emperor) and &quot;The Rock Guru.&quot;

== Early life ==

Khan was born on 28 February 1950 in Azimpur, Dhaka to Aftabuddin Khan and Jobeda Begum. They used to live in the No. 10 Government Quarter Colony. His father was the administrative officer of Secretariat Home Department, as well as a homeopathic doctor. His mother was a singer, a source of his passion for music. He had three brothers — Sayeed Khan, Alam Khan, Leyakot Ali Khan and a sister – Shamima Akhter Khanom. In 1956, his father built a house in Kamalapur. He was admitted to Motijheel Provincial School. In 1965, he was admitted to Siddheswari Boys&#x27; High School in the commercial division, from where he passed the Secondary School Certificate exam in 1968.

He enrolled in T &amp; T College in 1970, but his studies were interrupted by his participation in the Liberation War alongside his father and siblings.

== Participation in liberation war ==

In 1969, Khan took part in the mass uprising in East Pakistan (Public Awakening, গণঅভ্যুত্থান) against the West Pakistan government. He was a member of the Trinity Artist Group (ক্রান্তি শিল্পী গোষ্ঠী). He would compose songs against Pakistani leaders. In 1971, his father Aftabuddin became the senior officer of the secretariat. His father inspired him and his brothers to join the war. At the age of 21, he and two friends traveled to Agartala on foot with the goal of serving under major Khaled Mosharraf in Sector 2. After training Melaghar Camp in India, Khan fought against the Pakistani army in Comilla. He first fought in Saldah and Agartala before being sent to Dhaka to take part in the ongoing guerrilla war against Pakistan. Khan served under section commander Khaled Mosharraf on a guerilla team known as Crack Platoon. He took part in several guerrilla attacks in Dhaka and the surrounding areas and was promoted to section commander. Khan was responsible for managing guerrilla operations within the Jatrabari-Gulshan area. The most notable of these was &quot;Operation Titas&quot; under his leadership. Their mission was to destroy gas pipelines supplying Dhaka. A primary target were pipes supplying the Hotel Intercontinental (Now Sheraton Hotel). Their goal was to disrupt foreigners staying in those hotels in order to raise awareness of the war. During the conflict, he was hit in his left ear, which damaged his hearing. His section managed to defeat members of the Pakistani army in a battle organized in Trimohani, near Madartek. Azam Khan entered Dhaka with his accomplices in mid-December 1971.

== Career ==

After the war, he was able to return to his aspirations of music. He founded the band Uchcharan in 1972. Guitarist Rocket then joined the band. Khan&#x27;s first appearance in music was Spondon&#x27;s musical program and performance on Bangladesh Television, in DIT Building in Dhaka with rock singers like Nasir Ahmed Apu, Firoz Shai. Guitarist Mansur, Congo player Naseem of &quot;Spandan&quot;. The program was directed by Mansur Ahmed Nipu of &quot;Spandan&quot; and produced by Noazesh Ali Khan of BTV. His rock band earned instant reputation and Azam Khan came to be known as the &quot;Rock Guru&quot;. Some of his biggest hits are &quot;Ore Saleka, Ore Maleka&quot;, &quot;Jibone Kichhu Pabona Re&quot;, &quot;Ami Jare Chaire&quot;, &quot;Ashi Ashi Bole Tumi&quot;, &quot;Obhimani&quot;, &quot;Rail liner bostite&quot;, &quot;Hei Allah Hei Allah Re&quot;, &quot;Alal O Dulal&quot;.

He was also a cricketer, having played in Dhaka&#x27;s second division league as late as 1998, when he was around 48.

== Personal life ==

Khan married Sahida Begum in 1981. Together they had two daughters, Ima Khan and Aroni Khan, and a son, Hridoy Khan.

== Death ==

Khan died on 5 June 2011 at Dhaka Combined Military Hospital at the age of 61. He was suffering from oral cancer which had spread to his lungs. In 2013, his family established &quot;Azam Khan Foundation&quot; aiming to help impoverished artists.

Khan, along with his contemporaries Fakir Alamgir, Ferdous Wahid, Pilu Momtaz, Firoz Shai and Nazma Zaman is credited with pioneering popular music in Bangladesh. About his career, pop singer Habib Wahid said, &quot;the history of Bangladeshi rock music began with Azam Khan. His songs were very popular in the post-independence Bangladesh, and they haven&#x27;t lost their appeal at all.&quot; Female rock artist Mila Islam said, &quot;Azam Khan introduced the genre rock and roll to Bangladeshi people.&quot; Indie musician Shayan Chowdhury Arnob said, &quot;He is not among us anymore, but his songs will keep his spirit alive. He&#x27;ll live forever through his music.&quot;

== Influences ==
His influences included famous Indian singers such as Kishore Kumar, Hemanta Mukherjee, Manna Dey, as well as British rock bands The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. He was particularly intrigued by George Harrison, whose 1971 Concert for Bangladesh sought to rally support for the liberation army in the West.

<doc id="879501" wikidata="Q327048" url="?curid=879501" title="Norwegian heavy water sabotage">
<text>The Norwegian heavy water sabotage (; ) was a series of Allied-led efforts to halt German heavy water (deuterium) production via hydroelectric plants in Nazi Germany-occupied Norway during World War II, involving both Norwegian commandos and Allied bombing raids. During the war, the Allies sought to inhibit the German development of nuclear weapons with the removal of heavy water and the destruction of heavy-water production plants. The Norwegian heavy water sabotage was aimed at the 60 MW Vemork power station at the Rjukan waterfall in Telemark.

The hydroelectric power plant at Vemork was built in 1934. It was the world&#x27;s first site to mass-produce heavy water (as a byproduct of nitrogen fixing), with a capacity of 12 tonnes per year. Before the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, the French Deuxième Bureau removed of heavy water from the Vemork plant in then-neutral Norway. The plant&#x27;s managing director agreed to lend France the heavy water for the duration of the war. The French transported it secretly to Oslo, then to Perth, Scotland, and then to France. The plant was still capable of producing heavy water, however, and the Allies were concerned that the Germans would use the facility to produce more heavy water.

Between 1940 and 1944, a series of sabotage actions by the Norwegian resistance movement and Allied bombing ensured the destruction of the plant and the loss of its heavy water. These operations — code-named Grouse, Freshman, and Gunnerside — knocked the plant out of production in early 1943. In Operation Grouse, the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) successfully placed an advance team of four Norwegians on the Hardanger Plateau above the plant in October 1942. The unsuccessful Operation Freshman was mounted the following month by British paratroopers, who were to rendezvous with the Operation Grouse Norwegians and proceed to Vemork. This attempt failed when the military gliders (and one of their tugs, a Handley Page Halifax) crashed short of their destination. Except for the crew of one Halifax bomber, all the participants were killed in the crashes or captured, interrogated and executed by the Gestapo.

In February 1943, a team of Norwegian commandos of SOE&#x27;s Norwegian Independent Company 1 (&quot;Kompani Linge&quot;) destroyed the production facility in Operation Gunnerside; this was followed by Allied bombing raids. The Germans ceased operations, and attempted to move the remaining heavy water to Germany. Norwegian resistance forces then sank the ferry carrying the heavy water, the , on Lake Tinn.

==Background==
Enrico Fermi and his colleagues studied the results of bombarding uranium with neutrons in 1934. That year, Ida Noddack first mentioned the concept of nuclear fission. In December 1938, four years after the Fermi publication, Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch correctly interpreted Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann&#x27;s radiochemical experimental results as evidence of nuclear fission.

News of the discovery spread quickly among physicists and it was realized that if chain reactions could be controlled, fission might be a new source of great power. What was needed was a substance which could moderate the energy of the secondary neutrons emitted by fission, so they could be captured by other fissile nuclei. Heavy water and graphite were the prime candidates for moderating neutron energy.

When Nazi Germany investigated the production of an atomic bomb, a range of options was identified. Although historical records provide limited detail on the German decision to pursue the heavy water approach, it became clear after the war that they had explored that option. Although ultimately unsuccessful, the approach chosen has been demonstrated as technically viable. Plutonium-239 (239Pu) makes effective weapons material, although it requires an implosion-type mechanism rather than the simpler gun-type trigger used in the Thin Man uranium bomb. Heavy water has been demonstrated as an effective moderator for 239Pu production, and may be separated from ordinary water by electrolysis. The German program had already been handicapped by the Nazi purging of German Jewish physicists and the conscription of others and ended in the autumn of 1942.

===Approaches to developing a weapon===
In nuclear-weapon development, the main problem is securing sufficient weapons-grade material; it is particularly difficult to acquire fissile isotopes of uranium-235 (235U) or 239Pu. Weapons-grade uranium requires mining, extracting and enriching natural ore. Plutonium can be &quot;bred&quot; in reactors fueled by unenriched uranium, which requires chemical separation of the 239Pu produced.

===Plutonium production===
Although the most common isotope of uranium, uranium-238 (238U), can be used as secondary fissile material in hydrogen (fusion) bombs, it cannot be used as the primary fissile material for an atomic (fission-only) bomb. 238U can be used to produce 239Pu through the fission of 235U, which produces neutrons (some of which will be absorbed by 238U, creating 239U). The 239U will decay after a few days, turning into weapons-usable 239Pu.

The Germans found that a chain reaction could not be sustained if graphite was used as a moderator, and abandoned it. Unaware that this was due to impurities, they did not test ultra-pure graphite (which would have been suitable). Instead, they settled on a heavy-water-based reactor design. A heavy-water-moderated nuclear reactor could be used for nuclear-fission research and, ultimately, to breed the plutonium with which a bomb could be made.

===Deuterium (&quot;heavy water&quot;) production===

In normal water, there is only one deuterium atom for every 6,400 hydrogen atoms; deuterium is more prevalent in the residue of water used as an electrolyte. An analysis of residues from the Vemork hydroelectric plant, a large-scale nitrate production plant using the Haber process, showed a hydrogen-to-deuterium ratio of 48 (most of the deuterium bound in HDO molecules). Norwegian Institute of Technology lecturer Leif Tronstad and Jomar Brun, head of the hydrogen plant, proposed a project in 1933 (the year heavy water was first isolated). It was accepted by Norsk Hydro, and production began in 1935.

The technology is straightforward. Heavy water (D2O) is separated from normal water by electrolysis, because the difference in mass between the two hydrogen isotopes translates into a slight difference in the speed at which the reaction proceeds. To produce pure heavy water by electrolysis requires a large cascade of electrolysis chambers, and consumes large amounts of power. Since excess power was available, heavy water could be purified from the existing electrolyte. Norsk Hydro became the heavy-water supplier for the world&#x27;s scientific community, as a by-product of fertilizer production for which the ammonia was used. Hans Suess, a German adviser on the production of heavy water, had assessed the Vemork plant as incapable of producing militarily-useful quantities of heavy water in less than five years at its capacity at the time.

==Operations to limit German access to heavy water==

===Pre-invasion efforts===
French research considered the production of 239Pu using reactors moderated by heavy water and graphite. Preliminary French research indicated that the graphite then available commercially was not pure enough to serve the purpose, and heavy water would be required. The German research community had reached a similar conclusion, and had procured additional heavy water from Vemork in January 1940. The German firm IG Farben, a partial owner of Norsk Hydro, had ordered per month; Norsk Hydro&#x27;s maximum production rate was then limited to per month.

The Deuxième Bureau (French military intelligence) directed three French agents (Captain Muller and Lieutenants Mossé and Knall-Demars) to remove the world&#x27;s extant supply, , of heavy water from the Vemork plant in then-neutral Norway in 1940. Norsk Hydro general director Axel Aubert agreed to lend the heavy water to France for the duration of the war, noting that if Germany won the war he would probably be shot. Transportation was difficult, since the Abwehr (German military intelligence) was present in Norway and had been alerted of ongoing French activities in Norway (although they were not specifically warned about heavy water). If they had become aware of the shipment, they might have tried to intercept it. The French transported it secretly to Oslo, then to Perth, Scotland, and finally to France.

When France was invaded, French nuclear scientist Frédéric Joliot-Curie took charge of the material and hid it in a Banque de France vault and then in a prison. Joliot-Curie moved it to Bordeaux, where it, research papers and most of the scientists (Joliot-Curie remained in France) boarded the British tramp steamer (one of the many merchant ships involved in saving over 200,000 troops and civilians in the three weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation).

The ship already had industrial diamonds, machinery and a number of British evacuees aboard. The &quot;Broompark&quot; delivered its passengers and cargo, including the global stockpile of heavy water, to Falmouth, Cornwall on 21 June. The award of an OBE to Captain Paulsen was recorded in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; of 4 February 1941. Crucial to the success of the mission was the role played by Charles Howard, 20th Earl of Suffolk, the British liaison to the French scientific establishment.

Although the supply of heavy water had been removed, the plant was capable of producing more. The Norsk Hydro management&#x27;s collaboration with the Germans was examined during investigations of collaborationism begun by Norwegian authorities after the war, but Aubert&#x27;s cooperation with the French aided the company&#x27;s case.

=== Operations Grouse and Freshman ===
In October 1942, Combined Operations Headquarters began operations to destroy the Vemork plant. There were two operations; the first (Operation Grouse) would drop a number of Norwegians in the area as an advance force. When they were in place, a party of British engineers would be landed by military glider to attack the plant itself (Operation Freshman).

On 18 October 1942, a four-man team of Norwegian commandos of SOE&#x27;s Kompani Linge parachuted into Norway. Since they had to ski a long distance to the plant from their drop point in the wilderness, considerable time was allotted for Operation Grouse. Unlike previous failed plans, Grouse required the team to memorize blueprints.

The British were suspicious, because the Norwegian Grouse team were delayed in contacting SOE team; the Norwegians had been dropped at the wrong place, however, and had gone off course several times. The secret question was, &quot;What did you see in the early morning of (a day)?&quot; The Grouse team replied, &quot;Three pink elephants.&quot; The British were ecstatic at the success of Grouse, and the next phase of the operations began.

On 19 November 1942, Operation Freshman followed with a planned glider-borne landing on the frozen lake Møsvatn near the plant. Two Airspeed Horsa gliders, towed by Handley Page Halifax bombers (each glider carrying two pilots and 15 Royal Engineers of the 9th Field Company, 1st British Airborne Division), took off from RAF Skitten near Wick, Caithness, Scotland. The towing of gliders, always hazardous, was worse in this case because of the long flight distance to Norway and poor visibility.

One of the Halifax tugs crashed into a mountain, killing all seven aboard; its glider cast off but crashed nearby, resulting in several casualties. Although the other Halifax arrived at the vicinity of the landing zone, the zone could not be precisely identified because the link between the Eureka (ground) and Rebecca (aircraft) radar beacons failed.

After many tries and with fuel running low, the Halifax pilot decided to abort the operation and return to base. Shortly afterward, the tug and glider experienced heavy turbulence and the tow rope broke. The glider crash-landed near the crash site of the other glider, killing and injuring several more people. The Norwegians were unable to reach the crash sites in time; the survivors were captured by the Gestapo, who tortured and later had them executed under Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Commando Order.

The unsuccessful raid alerted the Germans to Allied interest in their heavy-water production. The surviving Norwegian Grouse team had a long wait in their mountain hideaway, subsisting on moss and lichen until they captured a reindeer just before Christmas.

=== Operation Gunnerside ===

British authorities, aware that the Grouse team was still operational, decided to mount another operation with them; by this time, the Grouse team was known as Swallow. On the night of 16 February 1943, in Operation Gunnerside (named after the village of Gunnerside, where SOE head Charles Jocelyn Hambro and his family used to shoot grouse), an additional six Norwegian commandos were dropped by parachute by a 138 Squadron Halifax bomber from RAF Tempsford. They landed successfully, and found the Swallow team after a few days of searching on cross-country skis. The combined team made final preparations for their assault, scheduled for the night of 27–28 February 1943.

Supplies required by the commandos were dropped with them in special CLE containers. One container was buried in the snow by a Norwegian patriot to hide it from the Germans; he later recovered it, and gave it to an officer of the British Army Air Corps (which was conducting exercises in the area) in August 1976. The container was brought back to England and displayed at the Airborne Museum at Aldershot, which became part of the Imperial War Museum Duxford.

After the failed Freshman attempt, the Germans placed mines, floodlights, and additional guards surrounding the plant. Although the mines and lights remained in place, security at the plant had weakened over the winter. The bridge spanning the deep ravine above the river Måna, however, was fully guarded.

The force decided to descend into the ravine, ford the icy river and climb the steep hill on the far side. The winter river level was very low, and on the far side (where the ground leveled) they followed a single railway track straight into the plant without encountering any guards. Even before Grouse landed in Norway, SOE had a Norwegian agent in the plant who supplied detailed plans and schedules. The demolition party used this information to enter the main basement by a cable tunnel and through a window. The only person they encountered in the plant was a Norwegian caretaker named Johansen, who was very willing to cooperate with them.

The saboteurs then placed explosive charges on the heavy-water electrolysis chambers, and attached a fuse which allowed sufficient time for their escape. In an attempt to prevent reprisals, a Thompson submachine gun was purposely left behind to indicate that this was the work of British forces and not the local resistance. When the fuses were about to be lit, the caretaker was worried about his spectacles (which were somewhere in the room; during the war, new eyeglasses were nearly impossible to obtain). A frantic search ensued; the spectacles were found, and the fuses lit. The explosive charges detonated, destroying the electrolysis chambers.

The raid was considered successful. The entire inventory of heavy water produced during the German occupation, over , was destroyed with equipment critical to the operation of the electrolysis chambers. Although 3,000 German soldiers were dispatched to search the area for the commandos, all escaped; five commandos escaped by skiing to Sweden, two proceeded to Oslo (where they assisted Milorg), and four remained in the region for further resistance work.

===Resumed operation and Allied air raids===
The attack halted production for several months, although it did not permanently damage the Vemork plant. The plant was repaired by April; SOE concluded that a repeat commando raid would be extremely difficult, since German security was considerably improved.

Almost as soon as production resumed, the USAAF began a series of raids on Vemork. The plant was attacked in November by a massive daylight bombing raid of 143 B-17 heavy bombers, which dropped 711 bombs. Although the raid caused extensive damage, at least 600 bombs missed the plant.

On 16 and 18 November, 35 B-24 heavy bombers from the 392nd Bomber Group (based at Wendling, Station 118) extensively attacked the hydro-electric power station at Rjukan. The missions, the bomber group&#x27;s longest, lasted and hours respectively.
There was less need for ground assaults than a year earlier, since night bombing (previously unrealistic due to German air cover) was now an alternative. The Germans, convinced that air raids would result in further serious damage, decided to abandon the plant and move its remaining stocks and critical components to Germany in 1944.

===Sinking of the SF &quot;Hydro&quot;===

Knut Haukelid (the only trained commando in the immediate area) was informed of the German plan to remove the heavy water, and was advised to muster support and destroy the shipment. Haukelid recruited two people, and they decided to sabotage a ferry which would be carrying the heavy water across Lake Tinn on the Tinnsjø railway ferry. One of his recruits recognized a ferry-crew member and spoke with him, taking an opportunity to slip into the bottom of the ship, plant the bomb and slip away. Eight-and-a-half kilograms of plastic explosives (with two alarm-clock fuses) were fixed to the keel of the , which would transport railway cars with drums of the heavy water across Lake Tinn.

The ferry and its cargo sank in deep water shortly after its departure around midnight on 20 February 1944. Witnesses reported seeing steel drums floating after the ferry sank, leading to speculation that they did not really contain heavy water; an examination of records after the war showed that some barrels were only half-full, however, and would have floated. A few may have been salvaged and transported to Germany.

Despite the mission&#x27;s intention to minimize casualties, 18 people were killed; 29 survived. The dead were 14 Norwegian crew and passengers and four German soldiers.

A 2005 expedition retrieved a barrel, numbered &quot;26&quot;, from the bottom of the lake. Its heavy-water contents matched the concentration noted in German records, confirming that the shipment was not a decoy. The concentration of heavy water in a number of the barrels was too small to be of value to a weapons program, however, which might explain the lack of tight security around the shipment and why the ferry was not searched for bombs. In the film &quot;The Heroes of Telemark&quot;, the locomotive and train is shown covered with German soldiers; according to Ray Mears&#x27; BBC Television coverage, the general in command had ordered this disposition of troops.

==Historical perspective==

Recent investigation of production records at Norsk Hydro and analysis of an intact barrel which was salvaged in 2004 indicated that although the barrels in this shipment contained pH 14 water (suggestive of the alkaline electrolytic-refinement process), they did not contain high concentrations of D2O. Despite the apparent shipment size, the total quantity of pure heavy water was limited; most barrels contained only 0.5–1.0 percent heavy water, confirming the success of Operation Gunnerside in destroying higher-purity heavy water.

The Germans would have needed a total of about of heavy water to operate a nuclear reactor, and the manifest indicated that there was only of heavy water being transported to Germany. The &quot;Hydro&quot; was carrying too little heavy water to supply one reactor, let alone the 10 or more tons of heavy water needed to make enough plutonium for a nuclear weapon.

The historical consensus about the German nuclear weapons program is that it was a long way from producing a bomb, even if the Norwegian heavy water had been produced and shipped at the maximum rate. However, the unsuccessful Operation Freshman and the efforts of the saboteurs in Swallow, Grouse and Gunnerside made the secret war on heavy-water production internationally known.

== Agents ==
Joachim Rønneberg, the last surviving member of the Gunnerside team, died on 21 October 2018 at age 99. A statue of him, along with a plaque commemmorating Operation Gunnerside, stands near the harbour in his hometown of Alesund. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that at 95, Rønneberg was &quot;still mentally sharp ... and possessed of the unflappable calm that so impressed British military commanders more than 70 years ago.&quot; Einar Skinnarland was the first agent inside.

==Histories==
After interviewing Nielsen and Helberg, Barbara Wace of the Associated Press filed a news article on the sabotage in May 1945. Wartime censorship delayed publication until after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. &quot;But For These Men&quot; (), a 1962 book by John D. Drummond, recounts two dramatic raids: on the Norsk Hydro heavy-water factory at Vemork and another the railway ferry &quot;Hydro&quot;. &quot;The Real Heroes of Telemark: The True Story of the Secret Mission to Stop Hitler&#x27;s Atomic Bomb&quot;, a 2003 book by Ray Mears (), emphasises the Norwegian commandos&#x27; unique survival skills. The book is a companion volume to &quot;The Real Heroes of Telemark&quot;, a BBC television documentary series.

&quot;Skis Against the Atom&quot; () is a first-hand account by Knut Haukelid, one of the Gunnerside raiders who remained behind. Jens-Anton Poulsson (Swallow and Grouse) wrote &quot;The Heavy Water Raid: The Race for the Atom Bomb 1942–1944&quot; (), a 2009 book. Operation Freshman is covered in two books: Richard Wiggan&#x27;s 1986 &quot;Operation Freshman: The Rjukan Heavy Water Raid 1942&quot; () and Jostein Berglyd&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Operation Freshman: The Actions and the Aftermath&quot; ().

Richard Rhodes&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot;, includes details of the events. Leo Marks&#x27; 1998 book, &quot;Between Silk and Cyanide: A Codemaker&#x27;s Story 1941–1945&quot; (), also details the story. Marks (SOE&#x27;s cryptographer) knew the Norwegian team, trained them in cryptography so they could communicate with SOE in England, and followed their progress after they were dropped in Norway. The raid is the subject of &quot;Assault in Norway: Sabotaging the Nazi Nuclear Program&quot; (), a 2002 book by Thomas Gallagher based on interviews with many of the commandos.

An account of Operation Gunnerside is part of Neal Bascomb&#x27;s 2016 &quot;The Winter Fortress: The Epic Mission to Sabotage Hitler&#x27;s Atomic Bomb&quot; (). Damien Lewis&#x27;s book &quot;Hunting Hitler&#x27;s Nukes: The Secret Race to Stop the Nazi Bomb&quot; (), also published that year, details the raid and the sinking of the SF &quot;Hydro&quot;. The 2018 book, &quot;Heroes of Telemark; Sabotaging Hitler&#x27;s atomic bomb, Norway 1942–44&quot; by David Greentree (), describes the operation&#x27;s planning, execution and aftermath.

The Swedish power metal band Sabaton wrote the song &quot;Saboteurs&quot; on their 2010 album &quot;Coat of Arms&quot; about the events.

<text>The Pontiac Astre is a subcompact automobile that was marketed by Pontiac as a rebadged variant of the Chevrolet Vega. Initially marketed in Canada for model years 1973–1974, the Astre debuted in the U.S. for the 1975 model year, competing with other domestic and foreign subcompacts that included the Mercury Bobcat, Volkswagen Rabbit, and Toyota Corolla.

Built on the H-body platform, the car was available in hatchback, notchback, wagon, and panel delivery body styles. The Astre shared the aluminum-block 2.3 liter inline-four engine with the Vega through 1977, while the final 1977 models offered Pontiac&#x27;s all-iron 2.5 liter inline-four engine as an option. The Astre was cancelled with the Vega at the end of the 1977 model year, although the wagon continued for 1978 and 1979, rebadged as part of the Pontiac Sunbird line. The word &quot;&quot; is Catalan for &quot;star&quot;, a shared naming convention for the Vega.

==Design==
In 1968 GM chairman James Roche announced that General Motors would produce a new mini-car in the U.S. in two years. Pontiac&#x27;s own small car program had been rejected. Not only did corporate management make the decision to enter the mini-car market, it also decided to develop the car itself. It was a corporate car, not a divisional one. Ed Cole formed a GM corporate design team exclusively for the Chevrolet Vega headed by William Munser, who had worked on the Camaro. The Pontiac Division was given its own version of the Vega for the Canadian market, named Astre for the 1973 model year. U.S. Pontiac dealers finally had a subcompact to sell when the Astre made its U.S. debut for the 1975 model year.

The Astre used the Vega 140 cu in (2.3-liter) inline-four engine through 1977. The engine features an aluminum-alloy cylinder block and cast-iron cylinder head with a single overhead camshaft (OHC). 1977 models also offered the option of Pontiac&#x27;s 151 cu in (2.5-liter) inline-four engine with a cast-iron block and head with overhead valves (OHV). Transmissions are the three- and four-speed manual, five-speed manual with overdrive (1976–1977 option) and the three-speed automatic.

The Astre has a wheelbase and a width.
The front suspension is short and long control arms with coil springs; the rear suspension is a four-link design with coil springs. A torque-arm design rear suspension replaced the four-link design starting with the 1976 models. The Astre is a rear wheel drive vehicle with a live rear axle. Steering is of a recirculating ball type with a power assist option. The brake system features front disc brakes with solid rotors, and rear drum brakes. Power assist was optional starting in the 1975 model year.

==Models and changes==

The Astre features Pontiac&#x27;s trademark split grill, emblems and steering wheel with an upgraded interior trim to help differentiate itself from the Chevrolet Vega. Other styling differences compared to the Vega include — 1973 model Astres have a black-finish grill and clear parking lamp lenses on &quot;all&quot; models, and chrome headlight bezels on non-GTs. Taillight lenses (same as the Vega) have a chrome trim piece surround. The 1974–1977 models have first generation Firebird-styled taillights (also shared with the 1973–1974 Ventura) on the notchback and hatchback.

The hatchback coupe features a lower roofline and a fold-down rear seat. The notchback sedan had the lowest price and is the only Vega model with an enclosed trunk. The Safari wagon has fixed rear-side glass and a swing-up liftgate. A panel delivery based on the wagon was sold through the 1975 model year. It has steel panels in place of the rear-side glass, and an additional enclosed storage area. An auxiliary front passenger seat was optional.

The SJ hatchback and SJ Safari wagon models feature soft nylon upholstery, cut pile carpeting, padded and cloth covered door panels, and a fabric headliner, plus rally instruments, the higher-output two barrel engine, four-speed or automatic (over a three-speed manual) gearbox and radial tires. A GT package option for the hatchback and Safari wagon combined the lower-line interior with the SJ&#x27;s performance and handling features.

The 1974 model year brought the only major body design changes, due to revised front and rear bumper standards-A slanted header panel with a new split grill and recessed headlamp bezels complement the larger, front 5 mph aluminum bumper. Front and rear license plate brackets were relocated and a larger rear 5 mph aluminum bumper was used increasing the overall length three inches compared to the 1973 models.
A revised rear panel on notchback and hatchback models had new Firebird-styled taillights and ventilation extractor grills were eliminated on trunk and hatch lids.

The 1975 Astre, introduced in the United States September 1974, gave U.S. Pontiac dealers a needed fuel efficient subcompact. A budget &quot;S&quot; series was added during 1975. More than 267 changes were made including new High-energy electronic ignition system and a catalytic converter. Power brakes and a tilt steering wheel were new options. The Astre panel delivery was discontinued the end of the model year.

A unique Astre package was offered in 1975. Dubbed the &#x27;Lil Wide Track, it was the creation of Jerry Juska of Dymar to help with lackluster Astre sales. Juska took his ideas to Dave Landrith of Motortown Corporation specializing in custom auto work. The package includes a front air dam, rear spoiler, appliance wire mag rims, window louvers, a chrome exhaust tip, and bright stripe decals for the hood, body sides, rear spoiler, door handles, and wheel centers. They assembled a couple of cars in Jan. and Feb. 1975 and took pictures to local Detroit dealers where the package gained acceptance. It added a little over $400 to the price of the Astre but dealers felt the difference in looks was worth the price. Production was later switched from an old warehouse in suburban Detroit to a factory beside the Lordstown Assembly Vega/Astre plant. An estimated 3,000 Lil Wide Track Astres were ordered by dealerships. The package components were later offered as a dealer installed kit.

Astres were confined to a single series for 1976, but they were refined with extensive engine, chassis, and body integrity improvements. A modest facelift included a revised grill. The 2.3 L engine, named Dura-built 140, received improved cooling and durability refinements, and a five years/60,000 mile warranty. The chassis received the new Pontiac Sunbird&#x27;s upgraded components including the box-section front cross-member, larger rear brakes and torque-arm rear suspension, replacing the four-link design, and effectively eliminating wheel-hop on rough roads. The body received extensive anti-rust improvements.

The final year 1977 models continued to offer the 2.3 L Dura-built 140 engine as standard equipment with Pontiac&#x27;s new 151 cu in &quot;Iron Duke&quot; inline-four engine as an option. Both the cylinder block and cylinder head are cast-iron. Standard in the Astre and Sunbird, they were the first GM vehicles to utilize the engine which was widely used into the 1990s. 1977 Astre models also featured a new vertical design grill and aluminum wheels (13-inch) were a new option. The &quot;Formula&quot; option was also introduced for the Astre&#x27;s final year, which included the handling package, chrome valve cover, three-piece spoiler, Formula T/A steering wheel and special decals.

The 1978–1979 Pontiac Sunbird wagon was a rebranded continuation of the Astre wagon, continuing with a modified 1977 Astre grille rather than taking on the Sunbird coupe&#x27;s square headlights and flat hood.

==Reviews==

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; in a 1975 Astre road test, said, &quot;For $180 over the price of a Vega ($ in dollars ), the Astre features upgraded interior trim-primarily the items for which Chevrolet charges $134 in their custom interior ($ in dollars ). You also have the opportunity to go one big step up in luxury if you choose the SJ line which is available in hatchback and wagon body styles.&quot;

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; in a 1977 Astre road test, said, &quot;The Astre &quot;is&quot; the Vega-polished and refined and significantly improved, but still a Vega in perhaps its ultimate state of development. It remained for Pontiac to do what Chevrolet probably should have done in the first place: the substitution of the marvelous old Chevy II cast-iron four-cylinder econo-motor for the much-troubled aluminum-block Vega engine. Sliding in and starting the engine was a revelation because its so quiet and smooth compared to the Vega.&quot; Also the Astre&#x27;s interior trim was judged more plush than Vega&#x27;s.

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; in its 35th anniversary issue in 1990, amusingly recalled the Astre U.S. debut: &quot;Detroit Fights Back - The Pontiac Astre is introduced. It&#x27;s a Vega with better decals.&quot;

<text>The Buick Skyhawk is an automobile produced by Buick in two generations for the 1975 through 1989 model years.

The first generation (1975–1980) were two-door hatchbacks using the subcompact, rear-wheel drive H-body platform, a badge engineered entry-level version of the Chevrolet Monza, which was based on the Chevrolet Vega while the only engine available was a V6.

Introducing a subcompact was a new approach for Buick and GM, with a similar approach from Oldsmobile with the Starfire hatchback.

The second generation (1982–1989) Skyhawks were built on the compact, front-wheel drive J-car platform that was available in four body styles: two-door sedan and hatchback, as well as four-door sedan and station wagon — manufactured alongside its rebadged variants, the Chevrolet Cavalier, Cadillac Cimarron, Oldsmobile Firenza, and Pontiac J2000/2000/Sunbird at GM&#x27;s South Gate Assembly and Janesville Assembly plants.


==First generation (1975–1980)==

The &quot;first generation&quot; Buick Skyhawk is a subcompact, four passenger, hatchback automobile that was introduced September 1974, and produced for the 1975 through 1980 model years. It was
based on the Chevrolet Vega, and shares its wheelbase and width. The Skyhawk was produced with H-body variants Chevrolet Monza, Oldsmobile Starfire, and Pontiac Sunbird. In North America, it competed with other small sporty cars, such as the Toyota Celica, Datsun 200SX, VW Scirocco, Mercury Capri, and the Ford Mustang II. The Buick Skyhawk was the smallest car to wear the Buick badge in more than 60 years.

===Overview===

The Skyhawk has a wheelbase and a width. The Skyhawk, Chevrolet Monza, and Oldsmobile Starfire were among the first vehicles to adopt the newly approved quad rectangular headlamps. The body style is noted for having a resemblance to the Ferrari 365 GTC/4. The Skyhawk is a rear-wheel drive vehicle with a live rear axle design. Throughout its production, the H-body Skyhawk was offered only with the Buick-designed 3.8 liter (231 cid) V6 engine, using a two-barrel carburetor that generated at 4000 rpm in comparison to its siblings which offered a variety of engines. A four-speed manual transmission was standard; with a three-speed automatic offered as an option. The front suspension is short and long control arms with coil springs, and anti-roll bar; the rear suspension is a torque-arm design with coil springs and an anti-roll bar. Its design was later incorporated into GM&#x27;s third- and fourth-generation F-bodied (Camaro and Firebird). Variable-ratio power steering was standard and of a recirculating ball design. The brake system features standard power assist including front disc brakes with solid rotors, and rear drum brakes.

===Changes===

Following the introduction of the Skyhawk, in mid-1975, it was joined by a lower-priced and less well-equipped Skyhawk &quot;S&quot;.

In 1976, a five-speed manual transmission became available as an option. Starting with the 1976 models, the front and rear disc rotors were of the vented type. Another new option was the Astroroof, which was a large, heavily tinted, overhead glass roof combined with a wide aluminum band that extended from one B-pillar across the roof to the opposite B-pillar. In 1977, a conventional sliding sunroof became optional and also could be ordered with the aluminum band.

To commemorate the Bicentennial of the United States, the standard colors available on all Buicks were Judicial Black, Liberty White, Pewter Gray, Potomac Blue, Continental Blue, Concord Green, Constitution Green, Mount Vernon Cream, Buckskin Tan, Musket Brown, Boston Red and Independence Red, with specially available colors on select models Congressional Cream, Revere Red, Colonial Yellow and Firecracker Orange.

For the 1979 model year, the Skyhawk received a facelift that incorporated single rectangular headlamps, replacing the previous dual rectangular headlamps that all models had used. A new option was the &quot;Road Hawk&quot; package that included a Rallye ride and handling package consisting of larger front and rear stabilizer bars, larger tires, and special interior and exterior trim. There was also a &quot;Skyhawk Designers&#x27; Accent Edition&quot; that was primarily an exterior trim package available in bright yellow or red with black trim.

There were few changes for 1980, the last model year for the GM H-body platform, most notably the discontinuance of the five-speed manual transmission as an option and revisions to the interior decor. Only the four-speed manual and three-speed automatic transmissions were offered for 1980.

The Skyhawk and Starfire failed to achieve the sales success of the Monza and Sunbird possibly because small sporty coupes seemed out-of-place in a Buick or Oldsmobile showroom. They were discontinued on December 21, 1979, to allow for more production of Monza and Sunbird hatchbacks.

A total of 125,311 H-body Skyhawks were produced in six model years.

==Second generation (1982–1989)==
The 1982–1989 front-wheel drive Skyhawk (J-body) debuted in February, at the 1982 Chicago Auto Show. The Skyhawk was originally available as a two-door and four-door sedan in both Custom and Limited trim packages. The standard engine was a corporate 1.8 liter &quot;122&quot; OHV carbureted four-cylinder (88 hp), with a Brazilian-built 1.8 liter overhead-cam TBI four (84 hp) as an option. A carbureted, 90 hp OHV two-liter also appeared soon after the Skyhawk went on sale, along with an optional five-speed manual. The 1982 Skyhawk Limited sedan was listed at $7,931 ($ in dollars ) before optional equipment. The suspension was shared with the front-wheel-drive Skylark and Century, which consisted of MacPherson struts, lower control arms, coil springs and a stabilizer bar for the front, and a torsion-beam rear axle, along with coil springs and rear stabilizer bars. The unique dashboard unit was shared only with the Oldsmobile Firenza.

The Skyhawk was an entry-level compact platform for a luxury brand, Buick, and was a refocused effort from the previous generation introduced. It followed many economic factors. The United States had entered into a recession, following the effects of the 1970s energy crisis, and the United States Congress having passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, establishing Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. Sales of large luxury sedans declined in favor of smaller, fuel efficient products with luxury features installed. Smaller luxury vehicles were imported into North America from both Europe and Japan, and GM responded with a small luxury sedan that included power windows, power adjustable drivers seat, air conditioning, upgraded stereo system, available automatic transmission, velour cloth interiors and other appearance features. The station wagon was available with 60/40 split folding second row seat to accommodate passengers and cargo.

For 1983, the Chevrolet-built OHV 1.8 was replaced by a Chevrolet-built OHV 2.0 with 86 hp. A four-door station wagon was also introduced, Buick&#x27;s first front-wheel drive wagon. The next year there was a minor facelift, with bigger cooling openings and larger bumper rub strips. Shortly after the introduction of the &#x27;84s, a turbocharged MPFI version of the Brazilian 1.8 became available on the T-Type model, offering a hefty , of torque and the performance oriented Gran Touring suspension, provided by a Garrett T25 turbocharger and shared with the Pontiac Sunbird GT, but was only offered in the two-door coupe or hatchback, and the turbo T-Type was not available with the five-speed manual. The turbocharged engine was optional on the T-Type trim package, and was listed at $800 ($ in dollars ). The Skyhawk set a sales record in 1984 with 134,076 built. There was not much change for 1985, but for 1986 a new two-door hatchback was added, in &quot;Sport&quot; or T-Type trim. Also, the 2.0 now had 88 hp.

The 1.8-liter engines were replaced by two SOHC multi-port injected 2.0 liter versions for 1987, one naturally aspirated (96 hp/71 kW) and one turbocharged version known as &quot;RPO LT3&quot;. The OHV two-liter remained, still with 88 hp. For 1988, only Skyhawk Sports remained, and the hatchback was discontinued. There was also a &quot;Sport S/E&quot; two-door coupe. The OHV and turbocharged engines were no longer available.


Starting in 1986 the front facia was updated with a more rounded appearance, and the T-Type and Limited coupes, sedans, station wagons and hatchbacks received headlight covers that concealed dual sealed beam halogen headlights that retracted underneath the headlights, while the base model had exposed headlights.

1989 was to be the last year of the Skyhawk, but nonetheless the car received updates such as standard electronic fuel injection, better acoustical insulation and body colored door and window frames on the station wagon. The only engine was the Chevrolet OHV two-liter, now with 90 hp. A total of 23,366 of the 1989s were built, for a total of 529,564 second generation Skyhawks.

The Skyhawk, along with the variant Oldsmobile Firenza, were built in Leeds, next of Kansas City, Missouri from 1982 through 1988. 1988 was the last year of Oldsmobile Firenza production and Leeds Assembly was then closed. For 1989, GM moved Skyhawk production to its Janesville, Wisconsin, assembly plant. Production of the Skyhawk ceased after the 1989 model year. The Chevrolet Cavalier was also produced at Leeds for some of these model years.

The Skyhawk was the last Buick vehicle to offer a manual transmission option, until the introduction of the Opel Insignia-based 2011 Buick Regal Turbo.

<text>Janet Ecker (born October 18, 1953) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003, and was a senior cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.

==Background==
Ecker grew up in Exeter, Ontario. Her father was a family physician. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism from the University of Western Ontario. In 1985, Ecker served as Director of Communications at the Ontario Treasury. She worked as a Government Relations Consultant with Public Affairs Management from 1987 to 1991, and was Director of Policy for the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario from 1991 to 1995.

==Politics==
Ecker was also involved with the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario during these years. A Red Tory, she supported Larry Grossman at both of the party&#x27;s 1985 leadership conventions, and served as Assistant Executive Director of the Ontario PC Party from 1985 to 1987.

She was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Joe Dickson and incumbent New Democrat Jim Wiseman by a significant margin in the riding of Durham West, east of Toronto. After the election she was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Community and Social Services. On August 16, 1996 she was promoted to cabinet and named Minister of Community and Social Services.

===1999 election===
In the provincial election of 1999, she was re-elected by a comfortable margin over Liberal Dave Ryan in the redistributed riding of Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. After the election, she was named to the senior portfolio of Minister of Education. Ecker also served as Government House Leader after February 8, 2001. In 1998, she supported Hugh Segal&#x27;s bid for the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservative Party.

Ecker&#x27;s best-known controversy as Education Minister was not with the legislative opposition or the teaching community, but with Jim Flaherty, another cabinet minister in the Harris government. In 2001, Flaherty announced that the government planned to introduce a tax credit for parents choosing to send their children to private and denominational schools. Flaherty&#x27;s announcement broke a 1999 campaign pledge from Harris not to introduce such legislation. Flaherty reportedly did not consult with Ecker prior to making his statement. Ecker opposed this shift in policy, and according to some accounts was initially prepared to quit cabinet over the issue. She was persuaded to stay, but remained on very poor terms with Flaherty. As a result of this controversy, Ecker became a leading spokesperson for &quot;moderate conservative&quot; positions in her party, against the right-wing views of Flaherty and Harris. 

When Harris resigned as party leader in 2002, many anticipated that Ecker would join the contest to replace him. Instead, she supported the candidacy of Ernie Eves, who won by defeating Flaherty in the second round of balloting. Ecker was named Minister of Finance on April 15, 2002. Shortly after being named as Finance Minister, Ecker announced that the Eves government would postpone the previously-announced private-school tax credit. 

Ecker also introduced the Eves government&#x27;s Keeping the Promise for a Strong Economy Act (Budget Measures), 2002.

In 2003, Ecker delivered her provincial budget at an auto parts factory owned by Magna International, rather than in the legislature. The move was widely criticized, even by some members of the Progressive Conservative party. Despite her previous opposition, Ecker re-introduced the private-school tax credit in this budget. 

The Eves government was defeated in the provincial election of 2003, and Ecker herself was narrowly defeated by Wayne Arthurs of the Liberal Party.

===Cabinet positions===


==After politics==
Ecker is an advisor with Tramore Group, a Toronto-based program management professional services firm. She also teaches public administration at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston. In 2004, she supported Belinda Stronach&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign to lead the new Conservative Party of Canada. In 2005 she was named as president of the &quot;Toronto Financial Services Alliance&quot;. She supported Christine Elliott (spouse of Jim Flaherty) during the 2009 Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership election and served as her campaign chair.

In December 2016, Ecker was named a Member of the Order of Canada for being a leader in the financial industry.

<text>All Saints is an Anglo-Catholic church on Margaret Street in Westminster, Greater London, England. Founded in the late 18th century as Margaret Street Chapel, the church became one aligned with the Oxford Movement in the 1830s and 1840s. The Movement also prompted the reconstruction of the church in the 1850s under the architect William Butterfield, and the establishment of the Society of All Saints Sisters of the Poor, affiliated to the church. As a parish which does not affirm the ordination of women to the priesthood or episcopacy, All Saints is under the oversight of the Bishop of Fulham. 

The church building has been hailed as Butterfield&#x27;s masterpiece and a pioneering building of the High Victorian Gothic style that would characterize British architecture from around 1850 to 1870. It is known for its Gothic design, use of materials, and interior decoration. The church&#x27;s musical tradition traces back to the 1840s.

==History==
=== Margaret Street Chapel ===
According to the &quot;Survey of London&quot;, Margaret Street Chapel was founded by William Cudworth, who used to be Methodist but later became antinomian. The chapel was built in 1752 and leased to Cudworth in 1754, and there was a nonconformist congregation by 1757. In 1776, the deist David Williams rented the chapel to promote a &quot;universalist liturgy&quot;. In the 1780s the chapel was closed before it became a proprietary chapel in the Church of England and its ownership came under the Crown. J. D. Hazlewood was the minister of the chapel for a period of time after its reopening. According to Galloway and Rawll, the chapel looked like an 18th century meeting house of English Dissenters and did not possess architectural significance.

The chapel was damaged in the Titchfield Street fire of 1825. In 1827 the English banker and politician Henry Drummond purchased the site and the building, hoping to promote Irvingism within the Church of England. He also appointed William Dodsworth to be the minister of Margaret Street Chapel in 1829.

=== Oxford Movement ===

William Dodsworth became an early follower of the Oxford Movement, a 19th-century religious movement in the Church of England that sought a return to Catholic thoughts and practices. It was preceded by an 1820s intellectual revival at Oxford, in particular the Noetics of Oriel College, and its key leaders were John Henry Newman, Richard Hurrell Froude, John Keble, and Edward Bouverie Pusey. The Movement&#x27;s ideas are manifest in the &quot;Tracts for the Times&quot;, and its adherents were often called &quot;Tractarians&quot;. Among its ideas, the Tracts emphasised apostolic succession and the episcopacy, defended the practice of liturgy, and underscored the importance of the eucharist, advocating for its more frequent celebration. Anglo-Catholicism stemmed from the Movement.

Dodsworth introduced many ideas of the Oxford Movement to Margaret Street Chapel. He was a popular preacher, and the chapel attracted many London Tractarian supporters. Dodsworth later left Margaret Street Chapel in 1837 to join Christ Church, Albany Street and was succeeded by Charles Thornton. Thornton, a cousin of Edward Bouverie Pusey, was also a member of the Oxford Movement. He translated a volume within the &quot;Library of the Fathers&quot;, a collection of English translations of the works of the Church Fathers, but died in June 1839 before its publication.

Frederick Oakeley, a fellow of Balliol College, Oxford who joined the Oxford Movement in early 1839, left the university and became minister of Margaret Street Chapel on 5 July that year. As minister, Oakeley rearranged the interior of the chapel and practiced Anglo-Catholic high liturgy, making it a &quot;showcase of the liturgical practices of the Oxford movement&quot; according to Galloway and Rawll. James Pereiro also wrote that the chapel was an example of the &quot;new spirit of liturgical worship&quot; of Oxford. In 1845, Oakeley wrote a letter to Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London, asserting his right to uphold all Roman doctrine. Facing opposition from the bishop, Oakeley gave up his minister license on 3 June and joined the Roman Catholic Church on 29 October that year. He was succeeded by William Upton Richards, assistant minister of the chapel.

Members of the Oxford Movement were concerned with the liturgical use of architecture. During his tenure, Oakeley envisioned rebuilding the chapel according to a proper ecclesiastical style and raised about . His successor Upton Richards continued the project of rebuilding the chapel. Meanwhile, the Cambridge Camden Society, a society studying Gothic architecture, was seeking to build a church that would embody their architectural ideal and provide orthodox liturgy at the same time. In 1845, Alexander Beresford Hope, a leader of the society, realised that the chapel rebuilding scheme could be combined with the society&#x27;s goal. His proposal received the approval of Richards and Bishop Blomfield.
Upton Richards purchased the sites of the chapel and adjoining houses in 1849 in order to build a new church, and the Ecclesiastical District of All Saints&#x27; was soon founded on 30 July 1849.

The Cambridge Camden Society took charge of the rebuilding and appointed Sir Stephen Glynne and Beresford Hope overseeing the work. Glynne, however, did not participate in the project, and Hope took sole charge. William Butterfield was selected as the architect. Margaret Street Chapel saw its last sermon preached by Charles Marriott on 7 April 1850 and held its final service the next day. Edward Bouverie Pusey laid the foundation stone of the new church on All Saints&#x27; Day, 1850. During the construction of the new church, the congregation worshipped in Great Titchfield Street and, after 1855, at 77a Margaret Street. The total cost of the church, including the site and endowments, was around £70,000; several large individual donations helped to fund it.
The Oxford Movement also led to the creation of religious orders for women in England, including one at Margaret Street Chapel. Upton Richards encountered Harriet Brownlow Byron in 1848 and encouraged her to live a religious life. Brown later moved to 67 Mortimer Street and created a community for people with disabilities and orphaned children. Upton Richards celebrated Eucharist for the community in 1851, and in 1856 they moved to Margaret Street, across from the new church building. On 5 May 1856 Upton Richards received the professions of religious sisterhood of Byron and two other women, and in August they founded the Society of All Saints (Sisters of the Poor). Byron was installed as the Superior of the society by Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford. Maria, Christina Rossetti&#x27;s older sister, joined the society as an associate sister in 1856. Christina had associations with the society later in her life, working at the society&#x27;s House of Charity in Highgate in the 1860s. The scholar Elizabeth Ludlow argued that Rossetti&#x27;s poem &quot;Yet a Little While&quot; contains phrases that describe the interior of All Saints, Margaret Street.

=== All Saints, Margaret Street ===
On 28 May 1859, Bishop of London Archibald Campbell Tait consecrated the church building of All Saints. Upton Richards served actively for ten years until he suffered strokes in 1869. The &quot;Survey of London&quot; describes the congregation at the time &quot;occasional in character&quot;, as parishioners were not assigned fixed seats. In 1860 Upton Richards also established a choir school on Margaret Street for the church. He remained the vicar of All Saints until his death on 16 June 1873 and was succeeded by Berdmore Compton succeeded on 28 October. To commemorate Upton Richards, the parish devoted the decoration of the north wall of the church, which was designed by Butterfield, painted by Alexander Gibbs, and made by Henry Poole &amp; Sons in 1875–1876. 

Compton&#x27;s tenure lasted until July 1886, during which Archbishop of Canterbury Edward White Benson preached at the church on Ascension Day, 3 June 1886. William Allen Whitworth became vicar in November that year. He created a newspaper for the parish in 1887, established a mission in Pentonville in northern London from 1888 to 1897, and offered Welsh services at All Saints from 1889 to 1895. Whitworth died after a bowel operation in March 1905. During the Victorian era, Princess Alexandra of Denmark frequented the church until the death of her son Prince Albert Victor in 1892. She sometimes brought her husband, the future Edward VII, and her family.

George Holden led the church from 1905 to his death in 1908, re-establishing a ward of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament there in 1906 and joining the church to the English Church Union in 1907. He was succeeded by Henry Mackay, the fifth vicar of All Saints from 1908 to 1934. Mackay elevated the liturgy at the church by introducing incense in 1908 and paschal candles in 1912. He renamed the services as &quot;Mass&quot; in 1911 and the Solemn Eucharist &quot;High Mass&quot; in 1913, and from 1915 priests were addressed as &quot;Fathers&quot;. The Anglican Benedictine monk Dom Bernard Clements succeeded Mackay in 1934. In 1939 he oversaw the celebrations of the centenary of the licensing of Frederick Oakeley to Margaret Street Chapel, with preachers including the Archbishops of York and of Wales, and in November that year the Archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Gordon Lang preached at evensong at All Saints.

During the bombing of London in the Second World War, the choiristers were sent to the countryside and the roof of the parish school was set on fire. Dom Bernard died in 1942, and Geoffrey Fisher, then the Bishop of London, appointed Cyril Edric Tomkinson as the new vicar in 1943, who resigned due to ill health in 1951 and was succeeded by Kenneth Needham Ross. In 1959 All Saints celebrated the centenary of its consecration, having the Archbishop of York preaching at the High Mass on 31 May. In 1967 the choir school was closed due to financial difficulties and Ross retired two years later. 

The ninth vicar, Michael Marshall, led the church from 1969 to 1975. In 1970, Bishop Graham Leonard of London thought of using All Saints as a centre to catechise lay people, which inspired Marshall to establish the Institute of Christian Studies at 84 Margaret street, where the choir school once occupied. For the first three years the institute was a resident community, before it transitioned into a place of teaching and was formally opened by Michael Ramsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1973. The institute closed around 1978. Marshall was elected and consecrated Bishop of Woolwich in 1975, and the next vicar was David Sparrow, who held the post from 1976 to his death in 1981.

David Hope, then principal of St Stephen&#x27;s House, Oxford, an Anglo-Catholic theological college, was appointed the vicar of All Saints in 1982. In 1983 he organised a celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Oxford Movement, which saw Michael Ramsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, preaching at Evensong. In the same year Hope reinstated the celebration of the Feast of the Assumption and introduced the use of a monstrance for Benediction. During his tenure, he also established the Tenebrae service during the Holy Week. Hope became the Bishop of Wakefield in 1985, the Bishop of London in 1991, and was the Archbishop of York from 1995 to 2005. He was succeeded by David Hutt in 1986. Alan Moses was the vicar in the early 21th century, while the current incumbent is Peter Anthony. In 2020 the church came under the episcopal oversight of the Bishop of Fulham.

==Architecture==


All Saints marked a new stage in the development of the Gothic Revival in English architecture. The author and columnist Simon Jenkins called All Saints &quot;architecturally England&#x27;s most celebrated Victorian church&quot;, and the architectural historian Simon Thurley listed All Saints among the ten most important buildings in the country.

The design of the church showed Butterfield (in Sir John Betjeman&#x27;s words) &quot;going on from where the Middle Ages left off&quot; as a neo-Gothic architect. Previous architecture of the 19th-century Gothic Revival had copied medieval buildings. But Butterfield departed considerably from medieval Gothic practice, especially by using new materials like brick. Charles Locke Eastlake, the 19th-century architect and writer, wrote that Butterfield&#x27;s design was &quot;a bold and magnificent endeavour to shake off the trammels of antiquarian precedent, which had long fettered the progress of the Revival, to create not a new style, but a development of previous styles&quot;. The Victorian critic John Ruskin wrote after seeing All Saints: &quot;Having done this, we may do anything; ... and I believe it to be possible for us, not only to equal, but far to surpass, in some respects, any Gothic yet seen in Northern countries.&quot;

Butterfield&#x27;s use of building materials was innovative. All Saints is built of brick, in contrast to Gothic Revival churches of the 1840s, typically built of grey Kentish ragstone. At All Saints, Butterfield felt a mission to &quot;give dignity to brick&quot;, and the quality of the brick he chose made it more expensive than stone. The exterior of All Saints employs red brick, heavily banded and patterned with black brick, with bands of stone and carved elements in the gate, the church wall and spire. Decoration is therefore built into the structure, making All Saints the first example of &#x27;structural polychromy&#x27; in London.

All Saints is particularly celebrated for its interior decoration. Every surface is richly patterned or decorated; the floor in diaper patterned tiles, wall surfaces in geometrical patterned brick, tile, and marble, as well as tiles with painted decoration, large friezes executed in painted tiles, a painted ceiling, and painted and gilded timberwork behind the altar. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described the interior as &quot;dazzling, though in an eminently High Victorian ostentatiousness or obtrusiveness. ... No part of the walls is left undecorated. From everywhere the praise of the Lord is drummed into you.&quot;

The rear of the chancel features a series of paintings on gilded boards, within a delicately carved brightly patterned gothic screen, the work of Ninian Comper and a restoration of earlier work by William Dyce. The decoration of the Lady Chapel is also by Comper. The north wall is dominated by a large ceramic tile frieze designed by Butterfield, painted by Alexander Gibbs, and fired by Henry Poole and Sons, installed in 1873. It depicts a variety of scenes from the Old Testament, a central Nativity scene and depictions of Early Church Fathers.

The stained-glass windows are limited in All Saints due to the density of buildings around the church. The original windows were designed by Alfred Gérente (1821–1868) but his work was not held in high regard and was subsequently replaced. The large west window, which was originally fitted with glass by Gerente in 1853–58, was replaced in 1877 with a design by Alexander Gibbs based on the Tree of Jesse window in Wells Cathedral. The glass in the clerestory dates from 1853 and is the work of Michael O&#x27;Connor, who also designed the east window of the south chancel aisle which depicts Christ in Majesty with St Edward Martyr and St Augustine.

The baptistery in the south-west corner of the church is noted for its marble tiling which features an image of the &quot;Pelican in her Piety&quot; in the ceiling tiles, a symbol of the fall and redemption of man.

The reredos, by Butterfield, was moved to St Catherine&#x27;s Church, Wickford, at some time during the 20th century.

==Music==
One of the earliest musicians at the church was Richard Redhead, who was appointed organist of Margaret Street Chapel in 1839. He remained organist at the chapel and later at All Saints until 1864, when he joined St Mary Magdalene, Paddington. In 1841, the vicar Frederick Oakeley translated the Latin hymn &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; into English as &quot;Ye Faithful, Approach Ye&quot; for his congregation. Although Oakeley did not publish his translation, his hymn became notable due to its use at the chapel, and was included in several hymnals in the 19th century. One of its popular arrangements is &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful&quot;.

The church&#x27;s choir school admitted its first chorister in 1848, but its work was paused from 1854 to 1859, during the construction of the new church building. Its choristers sang in the Coronation of Edward VII and Alexandra in 1902 and the Coronation of George V and Mary in 1911. Laurence Olivier was also one of its alumni. The school was eventually closed in 1968 and the boys were replaced by sopranos.

From 1868 to 1907, the organist was . The organist-composer Healey Willan, a student of Hoyte, often played for Evensong at the church when he was in London at the beginning of the 20th century. Later, the musical director Walter Vale made an arrangement of Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom&quot;. The Russian composer went to the church in 1924 to listen to Vale&#x27;s arrangement. From 1953 to 1958, John Birch was the organist and choirmaster.

The current organ was built by Harrison &amp; Harrison from 1910 to 1911. It was converted to electro-pneumatic action in 1957 and restored in 2002.

<text>Stagira (), Stagirus (), or Stageira ( or ) was an ancient Greek city located near the eastern coast of the peninsula of Chalkidice, which is now part of the Greek province of Central Macedonia. It is chiefly known for being the birthplace of Aristotle, the Greek philosopher and polymath, student of Plato, and teacher of Alexander the Great. The ruins of the city lie approximately northeast of the present-day village of Stagira, and adjacent to the town of Olympiada.

==History==
Stagira was founded in 655 BC by Ionian settlers from Andros. Xerxes I of Persia occupied it in 480 BC. The city later joined the Delian League, led by Athens, but left in 424 BC: as a result, the Athenian demagogue Cleon laid siege to it in 422 BC. However, Cleon was a poor strategist and his conduct of the siege was very inefficient: so much so that the ancient Greek comedy writer Aristophanes satirised him in the play &quot;The Knights&quot;. Cleon died in the same year, in the battle of Amphipolis. Later, during the Peloponnesian War, Stagira sided with Sparta against the Athenians.

In 348 BC, Philip II of Macedon occupied and destroyed the city. In return for Aristotle&#x27;s tutoring of his son Alexander, Philip later rebuilt the city and resettled the old city&#x27;s inhabitants. Many new structures were built at this time, including an aqueduct, two shrines to Demeter, and many houses.

Tradition has it that the natives of Stageira transferred Aristotle&#x27;s relics to the city, buried it there, and founded a festival in his honour which was called &quot;Aristoteleia&quot;.

Much later, the Danish archaeologist Karl Frederik Kinch made several explorations of Chalkidiki in 1886, and he identified the site of Stagira based on ancient descriptions of it.

==Notable people==
* Aristotle, philosopher
* Hipparchus (Ἵππαρχος), philosopher, acquaintance and kin of Aristotle
* Nicomachus, father of Aristotle and doctor
* Arimneste, sister of Aristotle
* Nicomachus, son of Aristotle and philosopher
* Herpyllis, second wife of Aristotle and the mother of Nicomachus
* Nicanor of Stageira

<text>Alexander Sergeevich Spirin (Russian: Александр Сергеевич Спирин; 4 September 1931 – 30 December 2020) was a Russian biochemist, Distinguished Professor at the Lomonosov Moscow State University (since 1999), a Director of Institute of Protein Research Russian Academy of Sciences, Puschino (Пущино-на-Оке), Moscow Region (Московская Область), Academician of Russian Academy of Sciences. His primary scientific interests in biochemistry included nucleic acids and protein biosynthesis.

== Career ==
In 1957 together with Andrey Nikolayevich Belozersky (Андрей Николаевич Белозерский) he conducted comparative analysis of bacterial DNA and RNA, and predicted existence of messenger RNA. He gave the first qualitative description of the structure of high-polymer RNA (1959–61). In 1963 he discovered structural transitions of ribosomes and formulated one of the principles of structure of ribosomes. He discovered artificial ribosomal self-assembly (1963–66) and proposed a molecular mechanism of the ribosome role in protein synthesis (1968). He conducted extra-cellular protein synthesis on modified ribosomes — non-enzymatic translation (together with L.P. Gavrilova) (1970–74).

In 1957, he defended his Candidate&#x27;s Dissertation.
In 1962, he defended his doctoral dissertation.
In 1964, he received the title of Professor.
He was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1966 and full member in 1970.

<text>The Grindavík men&#x27;s football team is the men&#x27;s football department of the Ungmennafélag Grindavíkur multi-sport club. It is based in Grindavík in south-west Iceland, and currently plays in the Lengjudeildin, The second tier in Icelandic football.

==History==
The club won its way slowly up the leagues, beginning in the third tier and spending some time there before promotion to the second tier and at last promotion to the first tier in 1994. The club established itself there, and for years was the only side in the top divisions to have never been relegated from any division. Sigurður Jónsson was appointed manager before the 2006 season, after a successful period at Víkingur. In that season, Grindavík got relegated for the first time in their history. In September 2006 with three rounds to go, Sigurður resigned as a manager and his assistants managers, Magni Fannberg Magnússon and Milan Stefán Jankovic took control. They made a draw against Fimleikafélag Hafnarfjarðar, 1:1, in the last round, but it was clear before the game that they needed to win. On September 22, 2007, Grindavík won a promotion back to the Úrvalsdeild after a 6–0 win over Reynir Sandgerði, with still one round unplayed. They managed to stay in the top league from 2008 until 2012, when they were again relegated to 1. deild for the 2013 season.

In 2017, Grindavík finished 5th in the Úrvalsdeild. Andri Rúnar Bjarnason finished as the league&#x27;s top goalscorer and was named the player of the season.

<text>Wild Palms is a five-hour miniseries which was produced by Greengrass Productions and first aired in May 1993 on the ABC network in the United States. The sci-fi drama, announced as an &quot;event series&quot;, deals with the dangers of politically motivated abuse of mass media technology and virtual realities in particular. It is based on a comic strip written by Bruce Wagner and illustrated by Julian Allen first published in 1990 in &quot;Details&quot; magazine. Wagner, who also wrote the screenplay, served as executive producer together with Oliver Stone. The series stars James Belushi, Dana Delany, Robert Loggia, Kim Cattrall, Bebe Neuwirth, David Warner, and Angie Dickinson. The episodes were directed by Kathryn Bigelow, Keith Gordon, Peter Hewitt and Phil Joanou.

==Plot synopsis==
In the United States in the year 2007, the right-wing Fathers dominate large sections of politics and the media. A libertarian movement called the Friends opposes the government, often making use of underground guerrilla tactics. The Fathers&#x27; leader is California Senator Tony Kreutzer, who is also the leader of the Scientology-like Church of Synthiotics and the owner of the Wild Palms media group. Kreutzer&#x27;s Channel 3 TV station is about to launch &quot;Church Windows&quot;, a VR sitcom that projects characters into viewers&#x27; homes using a system called Mimecom.

Harry Wyckoff is a successful patent attorney on the brink of becoming a partner in the law firm where he works. He has two children with his wife Grace, a perfect housewife who also owns a boutique. His 11-year-old son Coty has just been cast for &quot;Church Windows&quot;, while his 4-year-old daughter Deirdre has been mute from birth. His mother-in-law is the chic socialite and artist Josie Ito, a woman of strong will and numerous connections. At night Wyckoff is plagued by strange dreams of a rhinoceros and a faceless woman who has palm trees tattooed on her body.

One day, he is visited by Paige Kurtz, a former lover during his college days. Paige asks for his help in tracking down her son Peter, who disappeared five years earlier. Paige is closely associated with the Wild Palms group, which Wyckoff&#x27;s firm is going up against in court. Wyckoff is passed over for promotion due to the seeming conflict of interest. After this, he gladly accepts when Kreutzer offers him a high-paying job at Channel 3.

In the wake of his new career, Grace becomes alienated from him and attempts suicide. To his dismay, Harry learns that Coty is actually the son of Kreutzer and Paige and that her search request was a plot to bring him and the Senator together. Coty becomes not only a TV star but also — due to his privileged upbringing and personal ruthlessness — a high-ranking member of the Church of Synthiotics. Josie turns out to be the Senator&#x27;s sister who disposes of potential rivals with the same violently brutal means as her brother. Her only weak point is her affection for her estranged husband Eli Levitt, Grace&#x27;s father and leader of the Friends.

Kreutzer plans to marry Paige and tries to get hold of the Go chip, which would enable him to become an immortal living hologram. He uses all means possible to acquire the chip, but Paige is disgusted by his methods and gives information to the Friends. Harry discovers that Peter, a boy who has connections to the Friends, is his real son who was taken away by the Fathers shortly after his birth. Kreutzer, who suspects Harry of collaborating with his opponents, has him tortured, and kidnaps Deirdre, while Josie strangles Grace.

Harry joins the Friends and uses his access to Channel 3 to broadcast a Mimecom recording of Grace&#x27;s murder that causes a social uproar. Synthiotics facilities and the campaign offices of Kreutzer (who is now running for president) are attacked. The Fathers try unsuccessfully to defuse the situation by killing Eli and broadcasting a fake video that depicts Harry as Grace&#x27;s killer. Josie is brutally killed by a former victim, Tully Woiwode. Kreutzer finally manages to get hold of the Go chip and has it implanted, but not before it is secretly altered by Harry and Peter. Kreutzer reveals to Harry that he is his biological father, then loses cohesion and dissolves into nothingness. Harry and Paige rescue Dierdre from Coty, and they drive into the sunset.

==Production==
Oliver Stone had originally planned to film Bruce Wagner&#x27;s novel &quot;Force Majeure&quot;, but then decided to film Wagner&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Wild Palms&quot;, published in Details magazine, instead: &quot;It was so syncretic. It was such a fractured view of the world. Everything and anything could happen. Maybe your wife isn&#x27;t your wife, maybe your kids aren&#x27;t your kids. It really appealed to me.&quot; Wagner referred to his creation as &quot;a sort of surreal diary […] a tone poem&quot;, set in an &quot;Orwellian Los Angeles&quot;. ABC agreed to finance the project on a budget of $11 million, but, remembering the eventual decline of David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, insisted that the series had &quot;a complete story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end&quot;. Filming began in July 1992.

Actor James Belushi compared the series (among others) to the British TV serial &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, and stated: &quot;It&#x27;s very tough, very challenging—a lot of viewers probably won&#x27;t dig it.&quot; Dana Delany suggested that viewers should &quot;let it wash over you, enjoy each scene, and by the end it&#x27;ll make sense&quot;. Robert Loggia compared it to the Elizabethan play &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; and the ancient Greek tragedy &quot;Medea&quot;. ABC, bound to make sure that viewers wouldn&#x27;t lose attention, had a supplemental book, &quot;The Wild Palms Reader&quot;, published and offered a telephone hotline with the show&#x27;s initial run. These measures notwithstanding, Stone considered the atmosphere to be more important than the storyline.

William Gibson later stated that &quot;while the mini-series fell drastically short of the serial, it did produce one admirably peculiar literary artifact, &quot;The Wild Palms Reader&quot;&quot; (to which he contributed). Both Stone and Gibson called Wagner the creative force behind the series.

==Production design==
The United States of the year 2007 as depicted in the series shows a strong influence of Japanese culture, such as in dress and interior and exterior design. Holograms of Miss Alabama and girl group The Supremes even bear Japanese facial features.

Other interior details show the influence of Scottish designer and architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868–1928). Deliberately anachronistic elements include 1960s cars (like Studebaker police vehicles) and Edwardian fashion. Cerruti 1881 provided costumes.

==Supplements==

===Soundtrack album===
In addition to Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s music score, a number of 1960s rock and pop songs and classical compositions could be heard in the series. On the 1993 released soundtrack album, the following songs were included besides Sakamoto&#x27;s music:
* The Zombies: &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot;
* Don Gardner &amp; Dee Dee Ford: &quot;I Need Your Lovin&#x27;&quot;
* Frankie Valli: &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot;
* Lou Christie: &quot;Lightnin&#x27; Strikes&quot;
* Mason Williams: &quot;Classical Gas&quot;

The following songs and compositions can be heard in the series but are not featured on the album:
* The Animals: &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;
* Ludwig van Beethoven: &quot;Symphony No. 7 in A major, Op. 92, Second Movement&quot;
* The 5th Dimension: &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot;
* The Rolling Stones: &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;
* The Rolling Stones: &quot;No Expectations&quot;
* The Supremes: &quot;Love Child&quot;
* Richard Wagner: &quot;Parsifal, Prelude&quot;

===Books===
A book, &quot;The Wild Palms Reader&quot;, was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press before the series aired. It included time lines, secret letters, and character biographies. ABC, concerned that viewers might get &quot;hopelessly lost in the tangled story line&quot;, arranged for the primer to be published. It also included writing supposedly from the &quot;world of the series&quot;. Contributors included:
* Norman Spinrad – sci-fi writer &quot;(Bug Jack Barron, The Iron Dream)&quot;
* Genesis P. Orridge (anonymous) – musician (Psychic TV, Throbbing Gristle)
* E. Howard Hunt – CIA officer involved in the Watergate Scandal, writer of spy/sci-fi novels
* William Gibson – sci-fi writer
* Brenda Laurel – virtual reality consultant on the mini-series
* Spain Rodriguez – 1960s underground comic artist &quot;(Trashman)&quot;
* Hans Moravec – scientist and writer in the artificial intelligence field
While the comic series was published in book form in Germany, the &quot;Wild Palms Reader&quot; was not. Instead, a novelization, written by German dime novel author Horst Friedrichs, was published under the title &quot;Wild Palms&quot;.

==Reception==
Reviews of the series were mixed.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic John J. O&#x27;Connor called &quot;Wild Palms&quot; a &quot;truly wild six-hour mini-series&quot; resembling &quot;nothing so much as an acid freak&#x27;s fantasy, drenched in paranoia and more pop-culture allusions than a Dennis Miller monologue.&quot; He described it as &quot;rich and insinuating as a good theatrical film, albeit harder to follow&quot; and concluded, &quot;You wanted something different? Here it is. And &quot;Wild Palms&quot; also happens to be terrific.&quot;

Ken Tucker in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that &quot;in its length, scope, sweeping visual tableaux, and over-the-top passion, &quot;Wild Palms&quot; is more like an opera than a TV show.&quot; Comparing it to David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, he decided that &quot;unlike &quot;Peaks&quot;, which started out brilliantly lucid and then rambled into incoherence, &quot;Palms&quot; sustains its length and adds layers of complexity to its characters. It also has something crucial that Peaks did not: a sense of humor about itself.&quot;

Mary Harron of the British &quot;Independent&quot; suggested that viewers &quot;forget about the message, and about what the rhino means. Wild Palms should be watched like opera; for its gorgeous images, its emotional set-pieces and its high style.&quot;

Readers of the British trade weekly &quot;Broadcast&quot; were much more negative, calling it one of the worst television shows ever exported by the U.S. to the U.K. It placed fourth on their list, exceeded only by &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;The Anna Nicole Show&quot; and &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; also blasted it, offering the interpretation that Oliver Stone was condemning television while covertly lauding cinematic films.

<text>Francisco Manuel Lumbrales de Sá Carneiro (; 19 July 19344 December 1980) was a Portuguese politician, who was one of the founders and the first leader of the Social Democratic Party (then known as the Popular Democratic Party). He served as Prime Minister of Portugal for eleven months during 1980, until his death in a plane crash in Camarate on 4 December 1980. 

==Background==
Sá Carneiro was born in Vitória, Porto, the fifth of the eight children of lawyer José Gualberto Chaves Marques de Sá Carneiro (1897–1978) and Maria Francisca Judite Pinto da Costa Leite (1908–1989) of the Counts of Lumbrales in Spain.

==Career==
A lawyer by training, Sá Carneiro became a member of the National Assembly in 1969 and, in turn, one of the leaders of the &quot;Liberal Wing&quot; (&quot;Ala Liberal&quot;) which attempted to work for the gradual transformation of Marcelo Caetano&#x27;s dictatorship into a Western European liberal democracy.

In May 1974, a month after the Carnation Revolution, Sá Carneiro founded the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), together with Francisco Pinto Balsemão, Joaquim Magalhães Mota, Carlos Mota Pinto, João Bosco Mota Amaral, Alberto João Jardim, António Barbosa de Melo and António Marques Mendes, and became its secretary-general. The PPD was soon renamed the Social Democratic Party (PSD); despite Sá Carneiro&#x27;s original claims to be leading a left-of-centre party, he and the party soon drifted to the right, becoming the country&#x27;s main centre-right force. He was minister without portfolio in a number of provisional governments, and was elected as a deputy to the Constitutional Assembly the next year.

In 1976, he was elected to the Assembly of the Republic. In November 1977, he resigned his office as president of the party, only to be reelected to that office the next year.

In the general election of late 1979, he led the Democratic Alliance, a coalition of his Social Democratic Party, the right-wing Democratic and Social Centre Party, and two smaller parties, to victory. The Alliance polled 45.2 percent of the popular vote and gained 128 of the 250 seats in the Assembly of the Republic; 75 of these were from the PSD. President António Ramalho Eanes subsequently called on him to form a government on 3 January 1980, and formed Portugal&#x27;s first majority government since the Carnation Revolution of 1974. In a second general election held in October that year, the Democratic Alliance increased its majority. The Alliance received 47.2 percent of the popular vote and 134 seats, 82 of them from the PSD. Sá Carneiro&#x27;s triumph appeared to augur well for the presidential election two months later, in which Sá Carneiro was supporting António Soares Carneiro (no relation).

==Death==
His victory was short-lived, however. On 4 December 1980, while on his way to a presidential election rally in Porto, the Cessna 421 he was on crashed into a building in Camarate, Loures, soon after takeoff from Lisbon Airport. Eyewitnesses claimed they saw pieces falling from the plane just moments after it took off. Rumours have continued to fuel conspiracy theories that the crash was in fact an assassination, but no firm evidence has come to light. There were even different theories as to who might have been the target of such an assassination, as Francisco de Sá Carneiro was travelling with the Defence Minister, Adelino Amaro da Costa, who had said he had documents relating to the October surprise conspiracy theory and was planning on taking them to the United Nations General Assembly. A parliamentary inquiry said in 2004 that there was evidence of a bomb in the aircraft, after a 1995 inquiry had concluded there was evidence of sabotage.

Dependent to a considerable extent on Sá Carneiro&#x27;s personal popularity, the Democratic Alliance was unable to maintain its momentum in the wake of his death. Faced with a national crisis, the public rallied behind the incumbent president, António Ramalho Eanes, who easily defeated the Alliance candidate in the presidential election a few days later.

The Pedra Rubras airport where Sá Carneiro was heading has been named after him as Francisco de Sá Carneiro Airport, in 1990, despite objections that it would be in bad taste to name an airport after someone who died in a plane crash.

==Family==
He was married on 13 May 1957, in Miragaia, Porto, to Isabel Maria Ferreira Nunes de Matos (1 October 1936, Miragaia, Porto), and had five children: 
* Francisco Nunes de Matos de Sá Carneiro (12 March 1958, Cedofeita, Porto), unmarried and without issue
* Isabel Maria Nunes de Matos de Sá Carneiro (7 July 1959, Cedofeita, Porto), unmarried and without issue
* Maria Teresa Nunes de Matos de Sá Carneiro (11 August 1961, Cedofeita, Porto), had two sons:
** Francisco de Sá Carneiro e Nogueira (1986, Santo Ildefonso, Porto)
** Lourenço de Sá Carneiro e Nogueira (1988, Santo Ildefonso, Porto)
* José Nunes de Matos de Sá Carneiro (1 April 1963, Cedofeita, Porto), married on 8 September 1991, in Luso, Mealhada, Isabel Maria Guedes de Macedo Girão (25 January 1965, Ramalde, Porto), and had an only daughter:
** Inês de Macedo Girão de Sá Carneiro (21 March 1992, Santo Ildefonso, Porto)
* Pedro Nunes de Matos de Sá Carneiro (12 September 1964, Cedofeita, Porto), married to Maria Benedita de Matos Chaves Pinheiro Torres (28 May 1967), of the Barons of Torre de Pero Palha, and had an only daughter:
** Maria Teresa Pinheiro Torres de Sá Carneiro (17 August 2000, Porto)

Later in life he lived together with Snu Abecassis, who died in the same accident as Sá Carneiro.

== Ideological assessment and legacy ==

Sá Carneiro started his political life in the youth of the Acção Católica (the Portuguese Catholic Action), being his first activity in civic life to write a letter to Marcelo Caetano requesting the return of the António Ferreira Gomes, the exiled pro-democracy bishop of Oporto. He probably had links with the Catholic syndicalist organizations and Christian socialism in general. He was very influenced by Catholic personalism and humanism (especially its Christian version).

Sá Carneiro tried to adapt the social-democratic ideas of the likes of Eduard Bernstein and the post-1945 SPD to the cultural context of Portugal and its traditionally Catholic society. The Godesberg Program had a very important influence in his social democratic thought as it became the model for his party and its cut with Marxist socialism.

Despite having an anti-collectivist and anti-statist party with an emphasis on personal rights and duties that was responsible for privatizing the industrial sectors nationalized during the revolutionary period, he increased social spending during his term, supported land reform and its redistribution in Alentejo and he was proud that his party had been adopted by the working, middle-class blue-collar worker and middle-low class workers and that his party defended &quot;the construction of a socialist society in liberty&quot;. Due to all these specificities, he called his party&#x27;s ideology &quot;Portuguese Social Democracy&quot;.

He was recognized as populist by supporters and opponents, as well as neutral analysts.

== Works ==
Sá Carneiro was the author of various works, among them:

*&quot;Uma Tentativa de Participação Política&quot; (An Attempt of Political Participation) (1973)
*&quot;Por uma Social-Democracia Portuguesa&quot; (For a Portuguese Social Democracy) (1975)
*&quot;Poder Civil; Autoridade Democrática e Social-Democracia&quot; (Civilian Power; Democratic Authority and Social Democracy (1975)
*&quot;Uma Constituição para os Anos 80: Contributo para um Projecto de Revisão&quot; (A Constitution for the 1980s: Contribution for a Project of Revision) (1979).

<doc id="879541" wikidata="Q5375746" url="?curid=879541" title="Encyclopædia Perthensis">
<text>The Encyclopædia Perthensis was a publishing project around the Morison Press in Perth, Scotland undertaken in the 1790s, with the involvement of James Morison. Morison went into partnership with Colin Mitchel and Co.

==Editions==
The &quot;Encyclopædia&quot; was issued in weekly instalments from 1796 to 1806, then republished in a 23 volume set in 1806. The first edition had the subtitle &quot;Universal dictionary of knowledge, collected from every source and intended to supersede the use of all other English books of reference.&quot;

Like the first edition, the second was originally issued in weekly instalments. These were issued from 1807 to 1816. In the last year the encyclopedia was issued as a 24 volume set, with the last volume being a supplement to the original text. The subtitle was changed to &quot;Universal dictionary of the arts, sciences, literature, &amp;c. intended to supersede the use of other books of reference.&quot;

==Content==

Most of the text was taken verbatim from the third edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. The first edition includes a rare early plan of Washington, D.C. It had twenty-three 8vo volumes with plates and maps. The main contributor and editor was Alexander Aitchison, member of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh.

The majority of the 370 plates and maps claimed by the second edition, where credited, are signed T Clerk Sculpt. Edinr. Two other artists, J Stewart and J Frasier, have signed plates. Though 370 plates and maps are claimed on the title pages, there are only directions for the placement of 348 plates, of which only one could be described as a map, a plan of Washington, D.C., in 1800 by Andrew Ellicott.

<doc id="879542" wikidata="Q736047" url="?curid=879542" title="Dinara">
<text>Dinara is a mountain range in the Dinaric Alps, located on the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. It has four major mountains or peaks, from north-west to south-east:

* Ilica or Ujilica (1,654 m)
* Sinjal or Dinara (1,831 m), eponym to the range, highest mountain in Croatia
* Troglav (1,913 m), highest peak in the range
* Kamešnica, with peak Konj (1,855 m)
Note the dual use of the name &quot;Dinara&quot;, which is also the origin of the name for the whole Dinaric Alps. The range is composed of limestone and dolomite.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name is uncertain. It may derive from a forgotten Illyrian tribe name, or it is named after a settlement in or near the region. According to Šišić, the Dinara name resembles the name of the Dindari, an Illyrian tribe that inhabited the western bank of the Drina Valley.
== Dinara Mountain ==
Sinjal, often marked as &quot;Dinara&quot; on maps, is the highest mountain in Croatia with an impressive south-western cliff, several hundred meters high, that is prominently visible from the Dalmatian plain below. It has a prominence of 728 m. This explains why the mountain &quot;Dinara&quot;, not being the highest in the range, still came to give its name to the whole range. In addition, the name is the origin to the name of one of the major mountain regions of Europe, the Dinaric Alps or Dinarides.

==Climate==
Dinara is located only a few dozen kilometers away from the Adriatic Sea, and is part of the Dalmatian Hinterland, but the climate on Dinara is a much colder, mountain climate, making it one of the coldest places in Croatia with average temperatures between 2 and 4 °C at the peaks. The average precipitation is high, while the number of sunny hours per year ranges between 1,700 and 1,900.

There are no inhabited areas on the mountain itself and human presence consists mostly of small shacks that belong to the herdsmen from the nearby valleys such as that of the Cetina river.

==Tourism==
One of the most fascinating massifs is on the southwestern slope. It is six kilometers long and up to 1,700 meters high, providing an interesting landscape for the travelers on the roads in the valley below to view. The massif does not attract many climbers, but its Ošljak peak (1,706 m) does.

==Flora and fauna==
===Flora===
Native vegetation of the Dinara region comprises a large number of plant communities, or habitat types. According to the data available, in the area of the Dinara mountain there are around 750 plant species, of which more than 110 are strictly protected and 55 are endemics.

The flora consists of mountain grasslands, Scopoli&#x27;s rockcress (&quot;Arabidopsis arenosa&quot;, &quot;Arabidopsis halleri&quot; and &quot;Arabidopsis croatica&quot;), Dinarian mouse-ear hawkweed (&quot;Hieracium pilosella&quot;), Dalmatian rockbell (&quot;Edraianthus dalmaticus&quot;), pasque flower (&quot;Pulsatilla&quot;), lion&#x27;s paw (&quot;Leonotis leonurus&quot;), yellow gentian (&quot;Gentiana lutea&quot;), common juniper (&quot;Juniperus communis&quot;) and hairy azalea (&quot;Rhododendron&quot;).

===Fauna===
====Birds====
The Dinara region, particularly Dinara itself and the habitat around the Upper Cetina, from its source to the Peruća dam, is designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) by the EU Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds.

The bird species include: common pheasant &quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;, common quail &quot;Coturnix coturnix&quot;, shore lark &quot;Eremophila alpestris&quot;, redshank &quot;Tringa totanus&quot;, stone curlew &quot;Burhinus oedicnemus&quot;, moustached warbler &quot;Acrocephalus melanopogon&quot;, golden eagle &quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot; and short-toed snake eagle &quot;Circaetus gallicus&quot;. Also there is sighting of Eurasian griffon vulture &quot;Gyps fulvus&quot; probably on their flight over to Cres.

====Mammals====
The mammals of the Dinara region are: brown bear Ursus arctos, grey wolf Canis lupus, Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx, wildcat Felis silvestris, red fox Vulpes vulpes, wild boar Sus scrofa, Eurasian badger Meles meles, brown hare Lepus europaeus and balkan snow vole.
Dinara is host to an endemic species of rodent, the Balkan snow vole (&quot;Dolomys bogdanovi longipedis&quot;), known in Croatian as the (&quot;Dinara mouse&quot;). It is an endangered species.

====Insects====
The relatively well-preserved, extensive and diverse habitats of the Dinara and Svilaja mountains and the Upper Cetina provide a refuge to a number of invertebrate species whose natural habitats have been endangered due to specific living conditions they require, while many of them are endemics and placed on the Red List (certain species of caddisflies, dragonflies, stoneflies, orthoptera, etc.).

Invertebrates living in caves and holes make a special group – their biology remains relatively unknown, but they are protected as the cave fauna together with cave vertebrates.

Insects include: dalmatian ringlet Proterebia afra dalmata, rosalia longicorn, longhorn beetle, firebug, hornet, bumblebee, stag beetle and marsh fritillary.

====Herpetology====
The herpetofauna of the Dinara region comprises around 15 species of lizards, snakes and amphibians, some of which are endangered, mostly because their natural habitats have been either reduced in extent or suffered degradation.

The herpetofauna comprises: smooth snake, balkan whip snake, nose-horned viper, fire salamander, slow worm, karst meadow viper and alpine newt.

<doc id="879548" wikidata="Q2107958" url="?curid=879548" title="Bolton-le-Sands">
<text>Bolton-le-Sands is a large village and civil parish of the City of Lancaster in Lancashire, England. The parish had a population of 4,098 recorded in the 2001 census, increasing to 4,127 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
Referred to as &quot;Bodeltone&quot; in the Domesday book, the village was known as Bolton until the arrival of the railways, when the name was changed to Bolton-le-Sands to differentiate from similarly named towns on the same line, such as Bolton which was then a part of Lancashire and called Bolton-le-Moors.

The oldest church in the village, founded prior to 1094, is the Church of England Holy Trinity church, originally dedicated to St Michael, which is grade II* listed. The oldest part of the current building is the tower, supposed to have been built around 1500. The nave and chancel date from the 19th century. The other churches are the grade II listed Roman Catholic St Mary of the Angels and the Christ Church United Reformed Church.

The Lancaster Canal, built in the 1790s, is a major feature of the village. Also passing through the village is the A6 and the West Coast Main Line, although its railway station closed in 1969.

The village includes three pubs: The Royal Hotel, situated on the A6, The Packet Boat (closed in 2015), and the Blue Anchor are both within the centre of the village, along the main street.
The village has one school, Bolton-le-Sands Church of England Primary School, with 320 pupils from the ages of 4 to 11 in a modern school building. It has received a 2022 Ofsted report with GOOD in all areas. 

The school is a successor to the old Boys&#x27; Free Grammar School, which dates from 1657, with the 19th century school building still used for community education. The school building was also home to the Bolton-le-Sands library until 1973, when the library was moved into a newly built site in the village centre. 

The library was controversially closed in Autumn 2016 following a renovation in 2015 costing a reported £283,000, in a cost-cutting measure by Lancashire County Council. The library building was put up for sale, after no public sector community group was found to run the library. The library was re-opened in December 2017, with commitment by the Lancashire City Council to keep it as vital part of the community.

The village has a very active scout group that meets in the scout hut on the village playing fields. It has three sections; Beavers, Cubs and Scouts.

==Governance==
An electoral ward with the same name exists. This ward stretches beyond the confines of the parish with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 4,255.

<text>Sarah Millicent Hermione Touchet-Jesson, Baroness Audley (; 7 October 1914 – 24 September 1982), was an English actress and dancer and a daughter of Winston Churchill.

== Early life ==

Sarah Churchill was born in London, the second daughter of Winston Churchill, later Prime Minister from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955, and Clementine Churchill, later Baroness Spencer-Churchill; she was the third of the couple&#x27;s five children and was named after Sir Winston&#x27;s ancestor, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. She was educated at Notting Hill High School as a day girl and later at North Foreland Lodge as a boarder.

== Personal life ==

Churchill married three times:
# Vic Oliver, born Victor Oliver von Samek, a popular comedian and musician (1936–1945) (divorced)
# Antony Beauchamp (1949–1957) (widowed)
# Thomas Percy Henry Touchet-Jesson, 23rd Baron Audley (1913–1963) (widowed)

It has been both stated and confirmed by multiple sources, including Sarah Churchill&#x27;s sister, Lady Soames, that Winston and Clementine Churchill neither liked nor approved of Sarah&#x27;s first two husbands. Towards the end of her marriage to Vic Oliver, she began an affair with the American ambassador to Britain, John Winant; it is believed the failure of the relationship contributed to the depression that led to Winant&#x27;s suicide in 1947. Only Sarah&#x27;s third marriage to Lord Audley (the love of her life, it was said) was greeted with warm approval by both parents. 

In 1964 Churchill became romantically involved with African-American emigrated jazz singer and painter, Lobo Nocho, and there were reports that the two might marry. Her father was also believed to have disapproved of this relationship.

== Second World War service ==

During the Second World War, Churchill joined the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). In her account of the work of photo reconnaissance &quot;Evidence in Camera&quot; Constance Babington Smith records that she was with them and worked closely on the interpretation of photographs for the 1942 invasion of North Africa, &quot;Operation Torch&quot;. Known by the name Sarah Oliver, Babington Smith says she was &quot;a quick and versatile interpreter.&quot; Aspects of Churchill&#x27;s wartime service are also described in detail in &quot;Women of Intelligence: Winning the Second World War with Air Photos.&quot;

American author Christopher Ogden&#x27;s biography of Pamela Harriman and other sources indicate that during the war she had an affair with (married) US Ambassador John Gilbert Winant, and that it ended badly. Winant committed suicide in 1947.

Catherine Grace Katz&#x27;s book, &quot;The daughters of Yalta: The Churchills, Roosevelts, and Harrimans: A Story of Family, Love, and War&quot; describes Sarah, Kathleen Harriman and Anna Roosevelt Halsted, playing a key role in the Yalta conference, as they managed their temperamental fathers.

== Acting career ==

Churchill is best known for her role in the film &quot;Royal Wedding&quot; (1951) as Anne Ashmond, romantic interest of Fred Astaire as Tom Bowen. In the same year, she had her own television show. She also appeared in &quot;He Found a Star&quot; (1941), &quot;Spring Meeting&quot; (1941), &quot;All Over the Town&quot; (1949), &quot;Fabian of the Yard&quot; (1954) and &quot;Serious Charge&quot; (1959).

On 17 November 1950, Churchill starred in &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, an episode of the American TV program &quot;Danger&quot;. She appeared on both the Jack Benny radio and television programmes. On television, she appeared on the episode &quot;How Jack Met Rochester&quot;.

In 1960, she appeared as Lisa Grayson in the play &quot;The Night Life of a Virile Potato&quot; by Gloria Russell at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, London.

In 1961, she appeared as Rosalind in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; at the Pembroke-in-the-round Theatre in West Croydon. Her parents were noted as paying a surprise visit to watch her performance, which was almost entirely attended by Croydon schoolchildren. Her father, who sat in the front row of an in-the-round performance and so was highly visible throughout, fell asleep.

== Prints ==
During the course of her life she created several lithographic prints. In the 1950s Churchill produced several prints featuring Malibu, California. Later in the 1970s, Churchill commercially published a collaborative series of portraits of her father, Sir Winston Churchill through Curtis Hooper, entitled &quot;A Visual Philosophy of Sir Winston Churchill&quot;. The series was carefully constructed by Churchill to represent her father&#x27;s great drive. In the series, (28 in total) most of the works were based on famous photographs chosen by Churchill, while one was based on Churchill&#x27;s drawing of her father. Each work was given an embossed quotation by Sir Winston Churchill and was signed by both Sarah Churchill and artist Curtis Hooper in pencil and pressed with the artists seal. Artist proofs were made available for each work, with a run of no more than 150 artist proofs, per work, also signed by both Sarah Churchill and artist Curtis Hooper in pencil, below the portrait. All artist proofs bore the artist&#x27;s embossed seal.

== Alcoholism ==

Sarah Churchill appeared in a London revival of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; in the 1950s, but drinking had become a problem. She was arrested for making a scene in the street on a number of occasions and even spent a short spell on remand in Holloway Prison. She wrote frankly about this in her 1981 autobiography &quot;Keep on Dancing&quot;.

== Death and interment ==

Sarah Churchill died on 24 September 1982 at the age of 67. She is buried with her parents and three of her siblings (Marigold had previously been buried in a grave at Kensal Green Cemetery in London) at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bladon, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire.

<text>The Cleveland railway line is a suburban railway line extending east-southeast from Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia. It is part of the Queensland Rail Citytrain network.

==History==


Following the opening of the Wooloongabba Branch railway line from Corinda to Stanley Street in South Brisbane in 1884, calls were made for extending the line to Cleveland to serve the developing farming area. A line was surveyed, and took an indirect route to avoid hilly country and to serve Fort Lytton, a gun emplacement at the south entrance to the Brisbane River, then the major defence installation for the city.

The line was opened to Manly in 1888 and extended to the first Cleveland station in 1889. An extension to the second Cleveland station opened in 1897, at which time the first Cleveland station was renamed West Cleveland (later Cleveland Central).

The initial constricted terminus at Stanley St was replaced by a dual track line to South Brisbane in 1891, and the Cleveland line connection to it was realigned to junction at Park Road railway station at that time.

An extension of the Cleveland railway line to Redland Bay and Mount Cotton was surveyed in 1889. The extension to Redland Bay was recommended by the Royal Commission into Public Works in 1922, but was never built.

Duplication on the line from Park Road began construction in 1910. The duplication was opened progressively, with the Park Road to Murarrie section opening on 17 June 1912. Duplication from Hemmant to Manly opened on 8 December 1912. The remaining section between Hemmant and Murarrie was completed in 1913.

In 1960, the line from Lota to Cleveland was closed. The Redland Shire Council opposed the closure, and preserved the corridor.

The line beyond Lota was rebuilt to contemporary standards ( rail, maximum 1 in 50 (2%) grades and minimum radius curves) and reopened on the original alignment to Thorneside in 1982. Following this, the entire line was electrified in 1983. Despite this, diesel locomotives hauling SX sets continued be used on some services due to an insufficient number of EMUs in service.

The line was extended to the third Cleveland station (formerly Raby Bay) in 1987, reputedly to facilitate potential extension of the line to Redland Bay in the future, being electrified upon opening. The travel time of 46 minutes compares to the steam-era time of 82–86 minutes. Since there are no turning facilities at Cleveland, diesel-hauled services continued to terminate at Thorneside until the SX sets were withdrawn.

A third line was laid between Park Road and Lindum railway station in the 1990s as part of the Fisherman Islands line to provide a dedicated freight track to the Port of Brisbane, being dual gauge to connect to the Acacia Ridge freight Terminal and the Australian standard gauge rail network.

==Line guide and services==
Most services stop at all stations to Bowen Hills railway station. Service originate from Cleveland, or in the interpeak, Cannon Hill. The typical travel time between Cleveland and Brisbane City is approximately 56 minutes (to Central). During weekday peak times, a few services run express between Morningside and Manly stations, for faster travel times for commuters working in the Brisbane central business district. Prior to 2014, an afternoon service on school days only operated express between Cleveland and Buranda stations, stopping only at Thorneside, Manly and Lota.

Cleveland line services typically continue as Shorncliffe line services.

Passengers for/from the Beenleigh and Gold Coast lines can change at Park Road; Ipswich, Springfield and Rosewood lines at Roma Street; and Airport, Doomben and Northern lines (see list below) at Central.

<text>The Oldsmobile Starfire is an automobile nameplate used by Oldsmobile, produced in three non-contiguous generations beginning in 1954. The Starfire nameplate made its debut as a convertible concept car in 1953 followed with the 1954–1956 Ninety-Eight series convertibles that shared a &quot;halo status&quot; with the Buick Skylark and Cadillac Eldorado. For 1957 only, all Ninety-Eight series models were named &quot;98 Starfire&quot;.

Oldsmobile during this time period was one of the most popular brands selling, and the company saw an opportunity to benefit from the Space Race of the 1960s. The &quot;rocket&quot; terminology was already a benefit with their [[Rocket v8|Rocket V8]].

After a two-year hiatus the Starfire name returned for 1961 as a separate model, offered in a single convertible body style. Intended to compete in the growing personal luxury car market, from 1961 to 1965 the Starfire Convertible was the highest-priced model offered by Oldsmobile. While it shared most of its sheet metal with other full-sized Oldsmobile models, the Starfire wore unique trim and luxurious interiors. The Starfire Coupe hardtop joined the convertible for the 1962 model year. For the final 1966 model year, the convertible was dropped.

The Starfire nameplate returned for the 1975 model year as Oldsmobile&#x27;s first subcompact, powered by a Buick V6 engine. The 1977 Starfire featured a four-cylinder engine as standard equipment, for the first time since the 1922 Model 43. Production ceased in 1980.

== Concept car (1953) ==

The Starfire name was first used by Oldsmobile on a one-of-a-kind dream car that was shown at the 1953 Motorama auto show. Named after the Lockheed F-94 Starfire jet fighter, the original Starfire was a 4-passenger convertible that had a fiberglass body, a overhead valve Rocket V8 engine, bucket seats for all passengers and a wraparound windshield.

Later in 1953, the luxury, limited-production 98 convertible, Spanish for &quot;festival&quot;, or &quot;party&quot;, offered some of the features on the Starfire concept car and was a top trim package for the Oldsmobile 98. Some of the new features added were a 12-volt electrical system that could power comfort and convenience features like electrically powered window lifts, convertible tops and front seat power adjustment. The engine was the installed with the &quot;Quadri-Jet&quot; 4-barrel carburetor. The overall appearance was similar to the concept car while showing some similarities to the Cadillac Eldorado.

Mechanically, the Fiesta had a special version of the Ninety-Eight engine which gained 5 horsepower to through manifold streamlining and compression increased from 8.1:1 to 8.3:1. A four speed Hydramatic automatic transmission and faster rear axle ratio were designed to keep the 4453 pound shipping weight Fiesta (336 more than a standard Ninety-Eight convertible) up to Oldsmobile performance standards. At US$5,715 ($ in dollars ) (over $700 ($ in dollars ) more than the Buick Roadmaster Skylark) the 98 Fiesta was nearly twice the US$2963 price ($ in dollars ) of a standard Ninety-Eight convertible, with only 458 units produced to its 7,521. It was comparable in price to the 1953 Packard Caribbean with a similar retail price.

== 98 Starfire (1954–1957) ==

The name was then used for the 1954–1956 model years to designate the luxury convertible models of the 98 DeLuxe line in much the same way that the Holiday name was used to designate hardtop body-styles. The 1954–1956 Oldsmobile 98 Starfire convertibles were the most expensive Oldsmobiles offered during those years with a retail price of US$3,249 ($ in dollars ) and production records show 6,800 rolled off the assembly line for 1954. The 1955 model benefited from a 200bhp engine offering dual exhausts. Optional equipment included tinted glass, power adjustable front seat, signal seeking AM radio, leather upholstery, electric window lifts, power steering and power brakes. The price remained the most expensive at US$3,276 ($ in dollars ) and production showed 9,149 were manufactured.

The 1956 models were updated to the appearance offered on the concept car, with the most noticeable aspect of the appearance being the large gaping grille with minimal adornment and bumper guard elements. The automatic transmission became standard with the inclusion of a &quot;park&quot; position on the transmission gear selector. During the 1957 model year, all 98 models were referred to as Starfire 98, sharing the standard features with the coupes and sedans. The name was dropped from the 98 series beginning with the 1958 model year.


== First generation (1961–1966) ==
===1961===

Introduced in January 1961, the Starfire was a performance-oriented grand tourer convertible, separated into its own model line and shared its body and wheelbase with the Super 88 and the lower-priced Dynamic 88. It was loaded with standard equipment including leather bucket seats, center console with tachometer and floor shifter for the Hydra-matic transmission, and was the first U.S. full-sized production car to feature an automatic transmission with a console-mounted floor shifter, brushed aluminum side panels, power steering, brakes, windows and driver&#x27;s seat. With a base price of $4,647 in 1961 ($ in dollars ), it was the most expensive Oldsmobile, even more than the larger Ninety-Eight models. The standard 394 cubic inch V-8 Skyrocket V8 engine - Oldsmobile&#x27;s most powerful in 1961 - used a 4-barrel Rochester carburetor and generated at 4600 rpm. Sales of the 1961 model were 1,500.

===1962===

For the 1962 model year, the convertible was joined by a two-door hardtop, which featured a new convertible-styled roofline shared with other Oldsmobile 88 coupes. Horsepower was increased to .
1962 was the best sales year for this generation Starfire, with sales of the hardtop coupe being 34,839 and sales of the convertible being 7,149.
===1963===

Styling changes for the 1963 model year included a move away from the sculpted sides of the previous years model, to a flatter, more conventional look with an exclusive squared off roofline that included a concave rear window. Sales of the coupe were down to 21,489 and the convertible was down to 4,401, a drop of 38%.
===1964===

The 1964 model appeared very similar to the 1963. Curb weight was down, but overall length was up to . Sales dropped further, to 13,753 coupes (down 36%) and 2,410 convertibles (down 45%). The Starfire now shared its basic bodyshell with the new and lower-priced Jetstar I hardtop coupe which competed directly against the Pontiac Grand Prix. The Jetstar also used the Starfire&#x27;s &quot;Ultra High Compression&quot; Rocket V8, but had a pricetag that was over $500 lower than the Starfire due to the use of a vinyl bucket seat interior and the fact that many Starfire standard features were optional on the Jetstar including Hydra-Matic transmission, power steering and brakes. Front seat belts were now standard as required by Federal law.
===1965===
For the 1965 model year, all Oldsmobiles would receive new styling, and the Starfire Coupe would receive a modified version of the 1963–1964 unique roofline with an inversely curved rear window. The Hardtop Sports Coupe body-style was again shared with the Jetstar I. Other 88 models adopted a Holiday Hardtop Coupe body-style that featured more of a fastback roof design, while the Ninety-Eight featured a more squared-off formal roof-line.
A new version of the Rocket V8 engine was offered for the 1965 model year, this one measuring displacement, still using a Rochester 4-barrel carburetor, and generating at 4800 rpm. This was still the most powerful engine in the Oldsmobile lineup and used only in the Starfire and the Jetstar I. Also new for 1965 was the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission which replaced the previous fluid-coupling Hydra-Matic used by Oldsmobile since 1940. Added to the option list for the first time on Starfires and other B-body cars was a four-speed manual transmission with Hurst shifter that was rarely ordered.

1965 sales were 13,024 for the coupe and 2,236 for the convertible.

===1966===
In 1966 only the Starfire coupe was offered, as the convertible was discontinued. The Starfire was moved downmarket and priced like the former Jetstar I. Equipment level dropped from previous years, with leather seats being replaced by Morroceen vinyl for both the Strato bucket seats or no-cost optional notchback bench seat, and no longer standard power windows and power seats. The Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, power steering and power brakes also went to the optional equipment list. While the 425 V8 still produced , the Starfire no longer had the most powerful engine offered for sale in an Oldsmobile, as the Toronado had a similar engine offering . Sales of the 1966 Starfire Coupe were 13,019.
===1967===
For 1967 the Starfire was discontinued, and in its place Oldsmobile offered a new upmarket version of the Delta 88, the Delta 88 Custom. At a $3522 base price, ($ in dollars ) nearly unchanged from the 1966 Starfire, it had similar interior trimmings and even carried the trademark brushed side trim with faux vents on the front fender. The two-door Holiday Coupe hardtop was complemented by a four-door Holiday Sedan, with the notchback bench seat.
== Second generation (1975–1980) ==
The second-generation Oldsmobile Starfire is a subcompact four-passenger automobile which was introduced in September 1974, and produced for the 1975 through 1980 model years.

The Starfire was Oldsmobile&#x27;s entry-level product and a badge engineered version of the Chevrolet Monza. The Starfire was virtually identical to the Monza other than Oldsmobile specific badges and the grille design. It would be the smallest car bearing the Oldsmobile name to use a four cylinder engine since 1922 with the Oldsmobile Model 43. An upgraded SX model was available, and the GT was introduced in mid-1975.


The Starfire has a wheelbase and a width.
The Starfire, Chevrolet Monza, Buick Skyhawk and Pontiac Sunbird were among the first vehicles to adopt the newly approved quad rectangular halogen headlamps. The body style is noted for having a resemblance to the Ferrari 365 GTC/4. Starfire&#x27;s standard engine for 1975-76 model years was the Buick Buick V6 engine using a 2-barrel carburetor that generates at 4000 RPM.

The front suspension is short and long control arms with coil springs, and anti-roll bar; the rear suspension is a torque-arm design with coil springs and an anti-roll bar. The second generation Starfire is a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with a live rear axle design. Variable-ratio power steering was standard of a recirculating ball type. The brake system features standard power assist including front disc brakes with solid rotors, and rear drum brakes. This was the first GM product to incorporate a torque arm rear suspension (rear coil springs with 2 links) - its design was later incorporated into GM&#x27;s third and fourth generation F-bodies (Camaro and Firebird).

1976 models could be had with the new optional Borg-Warner 5-speed manual with overdrive transmission. Starting with the 1976 models the front disc rotors were of the vented type.

For the 1977 model year, the front end was revised with a split grille design with vertical slots similar to the previous year&#x27;s Cutlass base models. The 140 CID (2.3-liter) aluminum-block inline 4-cylinder engine with 2-barrel carburetor became standard, while the Buick 231 cid (3.8-liter) V6 became optional on the base model, while the GT package included the V6 engine. The Chevrolet 305 (5.0-liter) V8 engine option was added later in the year. The Vega 140 CID aluminum-block L4 was discontinued at the end of the 1977 model year

The 1978 standard engine was Pontiac&#x27;s 151 CID (2.5-liter) Iron Duke inline 4-cylinder engine with a 2-barrel carburetor, generating at 4400 rpm. Late in the year, Oldsmobile added the Starfire Firenza package which included special rallye suspension, a front air dam, rear spoiler, flared wheel openings taking the width to 67 in, sport wheels and special paint and trim.

The 1979 model year saw a face lift, with twin rectangular headlamps replacing the previous quad rectangular headlamp design. The rear end was revised with a blunt rear body panel containing new taillamps and the license plate mounted above a conventional rear bumper. 
The V8 engine option was dropped at the end of the 1979 model year, as was the 5-speed manual transmission.

The 1980 model year was the last one for the Starfire and its derivatives. Production ceased December 21, 1979, as Oldsmobile traded H-body production to Chevrolet and Pontiac in exchange for a higher allotment of new FWD X-bodies.

The rear-wheel-drive H-body cars including the Starfire were replaced in the spring of 1981 with the new front-wheel drive J-cars designated as early 1982 models, including the Oldsmobile Firenza.

A total 125,188 H-body Starfires were produced in six model years.

<doc id="879557" wikidata="Q1195390" url="?curid=879557" title="Andrew Ridgeley">
<text>Andrew John Ridgeley (born 26 January 1963) is an English musician, best known for his work in the 1980s in the musical duo Wham! consisting of Ridgeley and George Michael. Associated with the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US, they were one of the most successful pop acts during the 1980s, selling more than 30 million certified records worldwide from 1982 to 1986. Their singles &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot;, &quot;Everything She Wants&quot;, and &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; all topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 2019, Penguin Random House published Ridgeley&#x27;s memoir &quot;Wham! George &amp; Me&quot;.

==Early life==
Ridgeley was born in Windlesham, Surrey, to Jennifer Jill (née Dunlop) (1943–2009) and Alberto Mario Zacharia (1933–2015), who later changed his surname to Ridgeley; his mother was of English and Scottish descent and his father was Jewish of Italian, Yemeni and Egyptian descent; his father&#x27;s family were expelled from Egypt as a result of the Suez Crisis. He has one sibling, Paul, born February 1964. Ridgeley grew up in Bushey, Hertfordshire, and attended Bushey Meads School. His mother was a schoolteacher at Bushey Heath Primary School while his father worked for Canon. When George Michael started school, Ridgeley volunteered to take him under his wing.

== Career ==
After the break-up of the short-lived group The Executive (of which Ridgeley, his brother Paul, and Michael were members), Michael and Ridgeley formed the duo Wham! in 1981. Michael was the lead vocalist, primary songwriter, and played keyboards, while Ridgeley co-wrote songs, played guitar, and performed backing vocals. They approached various record labels with a homemade demo tape–which took ten minutes to record in Ridgeley&#x27;s living room–and signed with Innervision Records (distributed by CBS Records). After one album, the duo signed with Epic Records/CBS.

===Wham!===
Wham! made their U.S. debut on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and became the only 1980s British act to have three No. 1 singles on both the U.K. and U.S. charts. In 1984, Ridgeley underwent surgery to have his septum straightened to improve his breathing after having broken his nose at age nine. After photos were published in British newspapers showing Ridgeley&#x27;s bandaged face, Wham!&#x27;s manager, Simon Napier-Bell, fabricated a story that the bandages were the result of Ridgeley having been hit in the nose in a nightclub. After days of tabloid headlines, the true reason was revealed.

In 1984, Wham! charted two U.K. No. 1 singles, and were competing that year with pop rivals Duran Duran to be Britain&#x27;s biggest pop act. Toward this end, Napier-Bell devised a publicity scheme that he believed would turn them into major international stars: In April 1985, he took Wham! to China for a ten-day visit. They gained huge worldwide media attention when Wham! became the first Western pop group to play in China: after two warm-up shows in Hong Kong, they played a show in Beijing in front of 15,000 people at the Worker&#x27;s Gymnasium, and one final show in Canton. The visit was recorded for a documentary film titled &quot;Wham! in China: Foreign Skies&quot;. In 1985, Ridgeley performed at the Live Aid charity concert with other backing singers, while Michael performed with Elton John.

By 1985, Ridgeley had developed a reputation in the tabloid press as a drunken party animal at nightclubs; the British tabloids referred to him as &quot;Animal Andy&quot; and &quot;Randy Andy&quot;. In 1986, &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot; became Wham!&#x27;s fourth and final U.K. No. 1 single. With Michael keen to move into a more adult market, the duo broke up after a farewell concert dubbed &quot;The Final&quot; in front of 72,000 people at Wembley Stadium on 28 June 1986.

===Post-Wham!===
Shortly after the breakup, Ridgeley moved to Monaco and tried his hand at Formula Three motor racing. Meeting with little success, he moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a career in acting. He returned to Britain permanently in 1990. CBS Records (later Sony Music), having taken up the option on Wham!&#x27;s contract that specified solo albums from Michael and Ridgeley, released a guitar- and drum-driven solo recording from Ridgeley, &quot;Son of Albert&quot;, in 1990. His brother Paul, an occasional percussionist for Bananarama, played drums on the album, whilst Paul Gray, bassist with early punk rock band the Damned played the bass.

The first single from the album was &quot;Shake&quot;; it reached No. 16 on the Australian singles chart and No. 58 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Shake&quot; was the 81st highest-selling single of 1990 in Australia. The second single, &quot;Red Dress&quot;, charted in Australia but peaked outside the Top 100. &quot;Son of Albert&quot; sold poorly, failing to make the top 75 in the UK Albums Chart. It was also one of the worst received albums of 1990 among critics, achieving only half a star in a savage &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine review. As a result, CBS passed up the option of a second album. Ridgeley later said, &quot;It was disappointing and depressing to receive quite such a beating over that album.&quot;

On 27 January 1991, Ridgeley joined Michael on stage for a few songs at the encore of his Rock in Rio event at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. Since 1991, Ridgeley has generally shunned publicity. He appeared as a studio guest on the first series of the BBC 2 programme &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot; in 1994, and gave an on-camera interview for the first time since the split in a 2005 documentary, &quot;A Different Story&quot;, about the life of George Michael.

In 2005, Ridgeley and Michael made plans to reunite as Wham! for Live 8, but Ridgeley reportedly pulled out at the last minute. In 2012, Michael dismissed rumours that they were set for a reunion to mark the 30th anniversary of their first record. Michael said that there was no truth in speculation the group would reform for a one-off concert.

Upon hearing of Michael&#x27;s death on 25 December 2016, Ridgeley paid his respects on Twitter, saying, &quot;Heartbroken at the loss of my beloved friend Yog.&quot; Ridgeley performed a cameo role in &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, a 2019 film that featured many songs by Wham! Ridgeley inducted Michael into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Charitable work==
Ridgeley has several times participated in the Dallaglio Cycle Slam, a charity bike ride for the Dallaglio Rugby Works, established in 2009 by former England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio, which helps young people tackle life in a positive way with the help of rugby. Ridgeley is a keen road cyclist and featured in a Sigma Sport &quot;Cafe Ride&quot; interview with former British cycling road race champion Matt Stephens in 2024. In 2024 Andrew Ridgeley attended the St. George&#x27;s Society of New York&#x27;s British Bash. He was awarded their Anglo-American Cultural Award.

==Personal life==
From 1990 to 2017, Ridgeley was in a relationship with Keren Woodward, a member of the group Bananarama. They lived with her son in a restored 15th-century farm property near Wadebridge, Cornwall. Ridgeley announced he was dating socialite Amanda Cronin in summer 2022; they separated in May 2023.

<doc id="879568" wikidata="Q5432356" url="?curid=879568" title="Falling Water River">
<text>The Falling Water River is a stream in the east-central portion of Middle Tennessee in the United States. It rises just west of Monterey at the edge of the Cumberland Plateau, and traverses the Eastern Highland Rim before dropping off to the Nashville Basin and emptying into Center Hill Lake along the Caney Fork. The river is noted for the Burgess Falls, which it spills over near the end of its course.

==Course==

The river rises in Welch Hollow, a dissected portion of the Cumberland Plateau that lies just west of Monterey in eastern Putnam County, and descends more than before exiting the hollow at the southern edge of Buck Mountain. It passes under Interstate 40 near mile marker 291 before entering City Lake, a reservoir that provides water and water treatment for nearby Cookeville. Just beyond the City Lake Dam, the river passes under U.S. Highway 70N as it turns southwestwardly through rural southern Putnam County.

After flowing through a series of sharp bends, the river passes under Tennessee Highway 111 before entering northern White County, winding its way through a rural area to the north and west of the Upper Cumberland Regional Airport. The river again reaches (and forms) the Putnam-White county line before entering Burgess Falls Lake, a reservoir built in the early 1920s to provide electricity for Cookeville. The river passes under State Highway 135 just upstream from the reservoir&#x27;s dam. Beyond the dam, the river enters a gorge and flows over a series of three waterfalls, culminating in the 136-foot Burgess Falls, as it drops from the Highland Rim to the Nashville Basin.

At the base of Burgess Falls, the river enters Center Hill Lake, an impoundment of the Caney Fork created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; Center Hill Dam. The river passes a point where the counties of Putnam, White, and DeKalb intersect, and continues southwestward into DeKalb. It empties into the Caney Fork at just over 15 river miles above Center Hill Dam, and just above river mile 53.

==Watershed==
The Falling Water River has a drainage area of 191 square miles, and is part of the Caney Fork, Cumberland, Ohio, and Mississippi watersheds. Tributaries of the Falling Water River include Cleghorn Creek, which empties into City Lake, Pigeon Roost Creek (near the Putnam-White county line), Glade Creek, which empties into Burgess Falls Lake, Cane Creek, which joins the river downstream from Burgess Falls, and Taylor Creek and Dry Creek, which are part of the Center Hill Lake backwaters.

==Geology==

The river flows primarily across the Eastern Highland Rim, a region of rolling terrain underlain by limestone strata and dissected by deep erosional valleys. Downstream from Burgess Falls Dam, the river enters a gorge underlain by siliceous Mississippian limestone that contains nodules of mineral quartz, making it resistant to erosion, allowing the development of the gorge&#x27;s three waterfalls. At Burgess Falls, the river spills from an overhang of the resistant Mississippian rock to a plungepool underlain by older Ordovician rock. A belt of Devonian period shale divides the Mississippian and Ordovician formations.

Window Cliff, a formation that includes several natural arches overlooking a waterfall, lies along a bend of Cane Creek just upstream from its confluence with the Falling Water River. Fancher Falls, an waterfall, is located along Taylor Creek, near its confluence with the Falling Water River.

==History==
The Falling Water River was harnessed to power gristmills during the 19th century. In 1921, the City of Cookeville began building Burgess Falls Dam to supply the city with electrical power. In late June 1928, a massive flood along the river caused part of the dam to collapse, and destroyed the powerhouse downstream. The dam was rebuilt, and continued supplying the city with electricity until 1944, when the city started purchasing electricity from the Tennessee Valley Authority. Cookeville built the City Lake Dam in 1946 to provide the city with a steady source of water. Center Hill Dam was completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1948.

==Recreation==

Burgess Falls State Park and a state natural area protect the areas around Burgess Falls and Burgess Falls Lake. Burgess Falls Dam is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Cookeville Dock, located off State Highway 135, and the Corps of Engineers&#x27;s Johnson Chapel Recreation Area, located off Sparta Highway (Highway 70), provide access to the Center Hill Lake section of the river. A primitive camp ground known as Cane Hollow is located off Highway 135, downstream from Burgess Falls.

The City of Cookeville maintains a park along City Lake just off Bridgeway Drive. The park includes a boat ramp.

<doc id="879576" wikidata="Q7870091" url="?curid=879576" title="USS Helena (PG-9)">
<text>USS &quot;Helena&quot; (PG-9) was a &quot;Wilmington&quot;-class gunboat of the United States Navy. She participated in the Spanish–American War, and served in the Far East for many years. The (PG-9) was the first of five Navy vessels named after the capital city of Montana.

The gunboat was launched by the Newport News Shipbuilding Co., Newport News, Virginia, on 30 January 1896. And she was sponsored by Agnes Belle Steele, daughter of the mayor of the city of Helena; commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 8 July 1897, with Commander William T. Swinburne in command.

In the Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute for that year, it was written:

 She is designed to meet the requirements of roomy and well-ventilated quarters, so as to provide for refugees, as in the case of missionaries, and to enable her to carry a large landing party. She has berthing capacity for many men besides her crew, and carries ships&#x27; boats of an unusual size, her steam cutter and sailing launch being each 33 feet long, or as large as those supplied to the heaviest battleships.
==Service history==

===Spanish–American War===
&quot;Helena&quot;″s first assignment was with the North Atlantic Fleet, cruising primarily in home waters. During the Spanish–American War, she stood by in the Cuban waters, where she saw action several times. On 2–3 July 1898, she exchanged fire with enemy batteries at Fort Tunas. On 18 July, she was part of the squadron that closed the port of Manzanillo, sinking or destroying ten vessels there during the Third Battle of Manzanillo.

===Philippine-American War===
The great problem facing the United States at the close of the Spanish–American War was the Philippine–American War. To aid in suppressing this rebellion, &quot;Helena&quot; sailed from Boston on 3 November 1898, bound for duty on the Asiatic Squadron, via the Suez Canal, arriving at the Philippines on 10 February 1899. On 21 May, she was present at the evacuation of Jolo by the Spanish, and the landing of the American troops to replace them. During June, she stood by with other vessels in Manila Bay to support the Army during its offensive south of Manila into the Cavite Province. One of her landing parties brought troops ashore in an assault that carried the strong defenses along the Zapote River on 13 June. On 7 November, &quot;Helena&quot; bombarded San Fabian in Lingayen Gulf, and covered the landing of 2,500 troops there, on the same beaches that would again be stormed by US troops 45 years later.

===Post-war===
&quot;Helena&quot; remained in the Far East for the rest of her naval service, engaged in protecting American lives and interests. She served in the Chinese waters from October 1900 – December 1902, then returned to the Philippines until March 1903, when she sailed back to the China coast. In December 1904, she moored once more at Cavite in the Philippines, where she was placed out of commission on 19 April 1905.

&quot;Helena&quot; was recommissioned on 16 July 1906, and cruised on the Asiatic Station until June 1907. From that time on, with intervals for overhaul, &quot;Helena&quot; served both with the South China patrol and the Yangtze River Patrol. She was placed in reduced commission on 29 June 1929, but continued to serve on the South China Patrol until 27 May 1932, when she was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register. The gunboat was sold on 7 July 1934.

<text>Crystal Caves is a side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Apogee Software for IBM PC compatibles. The game is divided into three episodes with the first distributed as shareware and the other two available for purchase. Designer Frank Maddin said the method worked &quot;pretty well&quot; for the time. &quot;Crystal Caves&quot; was inspired by the 1982 game &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; for Atari 8-bit computers.

==Plot==
Mylo Steamwitz is a down-on-the-luck space trader. Each game in the series follows Mylo going to the planet Altair to collect enough crystals from its mines to finance his latest get-rich-quick scheme.

===Volume 1: Troubles with ===
 are the hottest new pet in the galaxy, so Mylo hopes to earn enough crystals to buy a farm. He succeeds and buys his farm, but breed so quickly that the market is soon over-saturated, and Mylo is stuck with a planet overrun with .

===Volume 2: Slugging It Out===
After selling his farm for a loss, Mylo heads back to Altair. A recent war has created a demand for medicinal slugs, so now Mylo wants to buy a slug farm. He collects enough crystals to do so, and for a while, business is booming, but the slugs soon burrow their way into an abandoned salt mine and perish, depriving Mylo of his stock.

===Volume 3: Mylo Versus the Supernova===
A late-night infomercial inspires Mylo to quit farming and try his hand at real estate. He collects enough crystals to buy an entire solar system from Rip Eweoff. Mylo plans to turn the system into a vacation resort: tropical getaways on the inner planets, ski slopes on the outer planets, and luxury hotels in the middle. However, mere minutes after he buys the solar system, the star goes supernova, destroying the system. As Mylo looks at the nebula where the solar system once was, he comes up with an idea. He builds a restaurant overlooking the nebula. Thanks to its spectacular view of the nebula, the restaurant becomes the hottest spot in the galaxy, and Mylo finally makes his millions.

==Gameplay==

The game begins in a main level containing the entrances to 16 caves. To complete the game, Mylo must collect all the crystals in all the caves. Mylo can complete the caves in whichever order he chooses. Mylo can quit a cave at any time, but in doing so, will negate all progress he made in that level.

Each cave consists of some simple puzzles to solve. Pulling a lever will open the door of a corresponding colour. There will also be switches that Mylo can use to activate and deactivate obstacles.

Mylo is armed with a rocket gun to destroy enemies and obstacles. Mylo begins the game with five rockets, but can collect more as the game goes on. There are many other power-ups to help Mylo:
* P-Pill – supercharges Mylo&#x27;s gun so it can destroy all enemies with a single shot.
* G-Pill – reverses gravity, allowing Mylo to walk on the ceiling.
* Stop Signs – freeze all enemies on the screen, allowing Mylo to sneak past them.

Mylo begins each level with three hit points. If all hit points are lost, the player goes back to the start of the level. If a level is finished with all hit points, the player gets a bonus score of $50,000.

==Development==
Crystal Caves was inspired by &quot;Miner 2049er&quot;. The main character&#x27;s name, &quot;Mylo Steamwitz&quot;, was coined by George Broussard and was meant to sound like a loser&#x27;s name. Most graphics were created by Frank Maddin.

Development on &quot;Crystal Caves&quot; began back when George Broussard was still releasing games under the name Micro F/X. A few months into the development (when about 50–70% of the game was complete) Broussard joined Apogee and Crystal Caves became an Apogee product. It was originally going to be released on September 5, 1991 but was delayed for a month.

In October 2005, 3D Realms (formerly Apogee) released a maintenance patch to fix a bug in the game which set the player&#x27;s computer&#x27;s clock backwards 100 years after playing on Windows XP.

==Legacy==
GOG.com released an emulated version for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X in 2014.

An authorized remake by Emberheart Games was released in October 2020 for Windows and Linux. It features remade graphics, a new episode, new enemies, and an online leaderboard.

<doc id="879581" wikidata="Q3631372" url="?curid=879581" title="The Bachelor of Arts">
<text>The Bachelor of Arts (1937) is a novel written by R. K. Narayan. It is the second book of a trilogy that begins with &quot;Swami and Friends&quot; and ends with &quot;The English Teacher&quot;. It is again set in Malgudi, the fictional town Narayan invented for his novels. 

== Plot summary ==

The story follows the coming-of-age of Chandran, a young upper-middle class college graduate into adulthood. Chandran falls in love with Malathi, who he desires to marry. Their relationship is rejected by her parents as Chandran&#x27;s horoscope describes him as having a Mangala Dosha -- a superstition in which a marriage to a non-Manglik, Malathi, would lead to her early death. Malathi is then married to someone else.

Heartbroken, Chandran goes to Madras and lives on the streets. Disillusioned, Chandran embraces a nomadic life, becoming a Sanyasi and renouncing his life of worldly pursuits. Along his journey, Chandran is misunderstood as a great sage by the villagers he meets. After eight months, Chandran rouses to his senses, remembering his parents. He returns home, finding employment as a newsagent. 

Despite his return home, Chandran still obsesses over Malathi. His father comes to him with a proposal of marriage to another girl, Sushila. Chandran is initially skeptical about finding love again, but later decides to meet her. Chandran falls in love with Sushila at first sight.

<text>Anthony Conrad Nesty (born November 25, 1967) is a former competition swimmer from Suriname who was an Olympic gold medallist in the 100-metre butterfly event in 1988. He is currently the head coach of the Florida Gators men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swim team at the University of Florida, where he attended school. 

In September 2023, Nesty was named the Head Coach for the US Men&#x27;s Swimming team at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

== Early years ==
Anthony Nesty was born in Port of Spain in 1967, the youngest of five children in his family. Nesty&#x27;s family migrated to Suriname when he was seven months old, and he started swimming at the age of 5. Nesty trained and competed in Suriname and the Caribbean through the beginning of his teenage years. He represented Suriname along with his sister, Pauline, at the 1983 Pan American Games. After placing twenty-first in the 100-metre butterfly at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles at just 16 years old, Nesty enrolled in The Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida, a prep school with an athletic program known for training elite, world-class swimmers. While training under Bolles coach Gregg Troy, Nesty broke the prep school 100-yard butterfly record held by Pablo Morales. Breaking Morales&#x27;s record was the beginning of prominent successes for Nesty. He graduated from the Bolles School in 1987.

== International swimming career ==
Nesty returned to international competition at the 1987 Pan American Games in Indianapolis, Indiana, winning a gold medal in the 100-metre butterfly and a bronze medal in the 200-metre butterfly.

At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, Nesty edged American favorite Matt Biondi by one one-hundredth of a second to win the 100-metre butterfly; he finished the event in 53.00 seconds and Biondi in 53.01. Nesty is the only Olympic medal winner from Suriname and after winning his Olympic gold medal, he was unbeaten in the 100-metre butterfly event for three years. Nesty was the first black male athlete and only the second black athlete to win an individual Olympic medal in swimming following Enith Brigitha at the 1976 Summer Olympics, and only the second South American swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal after Alberto Zorrilla in the 1928 Summer Olympics.

Nesty&#x27;s victory in Seoul was a momentous social and political event for Afro-Caribbeans. The Suriname government commemorated his gold-medal performance on a stamp and on gold and silver coins. A 25-guilders bank note portraying an illustration of a butterfly swimmer was printed in his honor. Surinam Airways named one of its planes after Nesty (this plane was destroyed in an accident while operating as Surinam Airways Flight 764), and the indoor stadium in Paramaribo was renamed for him.

Nesty won gold medals in the 100-metre butterfly at the Goodwill Games in 1990 and the FINA World Aquatics Championships in 1991. At the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana, Cuba, he again won a gold medal in 100-metre butterfly and a silver in the 200-metre butterfly. He attempted to defend his 1988 Olympic gold medal in the 100-metre butterfly at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, but finished with a third-place bronze. At the 2008 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, while long retired from competition as an athlete himself, Nesty was invited to be Suriname&#x27;s flag bearer at the opening ceremony.

Nesty was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame (ISHOF) as an &quot;Honor Swimmer&quot; in 1998, and the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great&quot; in 2002.

== College swimming career ==
After winning his gold medal in Seoul, Nesty accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he enjoyed a successful swimming career with the Florida Gators swimming and diving team under coach Randy Reese and coach Skip Foster from 1989 to 1992. During his four years of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition, he won three consecutive NCAA individual championships in the 100-yard butterfly (1990, 1991, 1992), one in the 200-yard butterfly (1990), and one as a member of the team&#x27;s 400-yard medley relay team (1991), and received sixteen All-American honors. Nesty also won eleven Southeastern Conference (SEC) titles—five in individual races and six as a member of Gators relay teams.

Nesty graduated from the University of Florida with his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1994.

== Coaching career ==
In the mid 1990s, Nesty returned to the Bolles School as a member of the swim coaching staff, while also serving as head coach at Nease High School in Jacksonville.

Nesty was named the Assistant Men&#x27;s Coach for University of Florida in 1998 and associate head coach for the Florida Gators men&#x27;s swimming team in 2006. On April 13, 2021, the university announced that Nesty would henceforth also be head coach of the Florida Gators women&#x27;s swimming team. In November 2021, Caeleb Dressel would move under Nesty&#x27;s college group at the University of Florida from his former long-time coach Gregg Troy. Notable swimmers currently under Nesty&#x27;s direction include Katie Ledecky, Bobby Finke, and Kieran Smith.

In June 2021, Nesty was named Assistant Coach to the U.S. Men&#x27;s Olympic Swim Team. In February 2022, he was named Head Coach of the U.S. Men&#x27;s Swim Team for the 2022 FINA World Championships in Budapest.

In September 2023, Nesty was named the Head Coach for the US Men&#x27;s team at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, with Todd DeSorbo as Women&#x27;s Head Coach.

<doc id="879604" wikidata="Q2890798" url="?curid=879604" title="Battle of the Windmill">
<text>The Battle of the Windmill was fought in November 1838 in the aftermath of the Upper Canada Rebellion. Loyalist forces of the Upper Canadian government and American troops, aided by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, defeated an invasion by militants of a United States clandestine organization known as Hunter Patriots. The insurgents had intended using Windmill Point as a base for further offensives into Canada. Canadian, British, and American troops thwarted the invasion, successfully defending Canadian soil and forced the invaders to surrender. Others still in the U.S. were captured and arrested by U.S. officials.

==Background==
After a rebellion by disaffected Upper Canadians was suppressed in 1837, the majority of the rebel leaders fled to the United States. Popular sentiment in the States held that Canadians were eager to overthrow British rule and form a republic patterned after the American model.

An organization known as the Hunter Patriots was formed to assist the rebellion. Organized in secret neo-Masonic lodges, and with widespread support in the northern border states from Vermont to Wisconsin, the Patriot Hunters aimed to invade Canada and lead an army of insurgent Canadians against the British colonial government. In reality, much of the Canadian population was loyal to existing British institutions and decidedly against the prospects of revolution or invasion.

In November 1838, a group of Hunter Patriots decided that it was time to invade Canada and restart the rebellion. They chose as their target the town of Prescott, on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River downriver from Kingston. Prescott is the site of Fort Wellington, a British military fortification that commanded the St. Lawrence River and was serving as a fortified depot for the Upper Canadian militia. To initiate the strike, a large group of Hunters assembled in Sackets Harbor, New York, and descended the river to Ogdensburg in civilian vessels. Overall military command of the invading forces was held by John Birge, a senior member of the Hunter organization in New York State.
==Attempted seizure of Prescott==
Early in the morning of November 12, a force of about 250 men attempted to land in Prescott. However, the British had infiltrated the Hunter organization, and had advance warning of the attack. With the element of surprise gone, and with the town militia ready to repel a landing, the Hunter forces abandoned the landing. Their vessels ran aground on a mud flat where the Oswegatchie River flows into the St. Lawrence off Ogdensburg.

Later in the morning, Bill Johnston, Admiral of the Hunter navy, arrived and freed the stranded vessels, which then ran downriver to Windmill Point, a promontory located approximately two miles east of Prescott. Here, most of the Hunter forces landed to occupy the hamlet of Newport and its most prominent feature, a large, stone windmill building that enjoyed a panoramic view of the St. Lawrence River as far west as Brockville and eastwards over the Gallop Rapids. The commanders of the Hunters appointed a Swedish immigrant with some military experience, Nils von Schoultz, to command the Hunter forces while the Hunter leadership withdrew to Ogdensburg to collect reinforcements and supplies.

==First assault==
The windmill was built of thick stone and stood high on top of a bluff. Although the attackers had not planned to use the structure, it provided an ideal fortified position. Its height prevented the British forces from approaching unobserved, and its thick stone walls were impervious to small arms and to small field and naval artillery. Early on the morning of 13 November, a force under the command of the militia officers Colonel Plomer Young, Colonel Richard Fraser, Colonel John Crysler, Captain George Greenfield Macdonell, and Colonel Ogle Gowan and comprising a handful of British infantry from the 83rd Regiment and approximately 600 Canadian militiamen, including the Grenville Militia, Dundas Militia, and Glengarry Militia, invested the Hunter position around Newport and attacked. The attack failed, leaving 13 regulars and militiamen killed and 70 wounded. The Dundas County Militia lost 3 men killed and 7 men wounded. The Hunters suffered about 18 killed and some wounded.

The next several days were a standoff. As time passed, von Schoultz&#x27;s position became desperate. Promised reinforcements and supplies never arrived, as the United States Navy aided the Royal Navy in blocking egress from Ogdensburg. Law enforcement and military officials in Ogdensburg secured available vessels, and most of the prominent Hunter leaders fled from town to avoid arrest.

==Second assault==
Heavy artillery from Kingston, as well as sizeable detachments of British Army regulars, Canadian militia and U.S. Army regulars, tried to strengthen the Canadian forces. An artillery bombardment of the windmill was conducted on November 16 as they had been reinforced by four companies of the 83rd Regiment, Commanded by Henry Dundas. Royal Navy gunboats and steamers, and ships of the U.S. Navy blocked the Hunters from escaping, and Hunter casualties mounted, which made von Schoultz unconditionally surrender.

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath of the battle, almost all of the Hunters were captured and were transported to Kingston for trial. Eleven people, including the Hunter leader Nils von Schoultz, were executed; another 60 were sentenced to transportation to Australia. Aksim 40 were acquitted, and another 86 were later pardoned and released. Von Schoultz enjoyed the legal counsel of John A. Macdonald, a prominent young Kingston lawyer who would later become the architect of Canada&#x27;s Confederation in 1867 and the country&#x27;s first prime minister.

The site of the battle was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1920.

<doc id="879605" wikidata="Q1303236" url="?curid=879605" title="Chevrolet Vega">
<text>The Chevrolet Vega is a subcompact automobile manufactured and marketed by GM&#x27;s Chevrolet division from 1970 until 1977. Available in two-door hatchback, notchback, wagon, and sedan delivery body styles, all models were powered by an inline four-cylinder engine designed specifically for the Vega, with a lightweight aluminum alloy cylinder block. The Vega first went on sale in Chevrolet dealerships on September 10, 1970. Variants included the Cosworth Vega, a short-lived limited-production performance version introduced spring 1975.

The Vega received the 1971 &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year. Subsequently, the car became widely known for a range of problems related to its engineering, reliability, safety, propensity to rust, and engine durability. Despite numerous recalls and design upgrades, Vega&#x27;s problems tarnished its reputation and that of General Motors. Production ended with the 1977 model year.

The car was named for Vega, the brightest star in the constellation Lyra.

==History==
Chevrolet and Pontiac divisions worked separately on small cars in the early and mid 1960s. Ed Cole, GM&#x27;s executive vice-president of operating staff, working on his small-car project with corporate engineering and design staff, presented the program to GM&#x27;s president in 1967. GM management chose Cole&#x27;s version over proposals from Chevrolet and Pontiac, and gave the car to Chevrolet to sell. Corporate executives decided to enter the small car market and develop the vehicle.

In 1968, GM chairman James Roche announced GM would produce the new car in the U.S. in two years. Ed Cole was chief engineer and Bill Mitchell, vice-president of design staff, was the chief stylist. Cole wanted a world-beater in showrooms in 24 months. Roche noted that GM had a team of &quot;stylists, researchers and engineers&quot; who had worked on the vehicle code-named XP-877 for years. John DeLorean later challenged this notion and stated that no prototypes or test properties had been built before Roche&#x27;s announcement. Blueprints apparently did exist; however, they were an amalgam of competitive subcompact vehicles from overseas, including some that GM overseas operations produced.

A GM design team was set up, headed by James G. Musser Jr., who had helped develop the Chevy II, the Camaro, the Chevrolet small-block V8 engines, and the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Musser said, &quot;This was the first vehicle where one person was in charge&quot;, and that his team &quot;did the entire vehicle&quot;.

===Development 1968–1970===

Development for the new car began in 1968 to be powered by a new all-aluminum die-cast engine block technology. The first sand-cast aluminum blocks had preceded the decision to build the car by two years. It was a relatively large displacement engine with good low-speed torque, with gear ratios for low engine rpm to achieve fuel economy. Engine testing totaled 6,000,000 miles. A pre-test engine was installed in a Fiat 124 sedan for development of the aluminum block, while several 1968 Opel sedans were used for drivetrain development

Chevrolet instituted a new management program, the car line management technique, to produce the all-new car in two years. The chief vehicle engineer had overall charge of the program. Fifty engineers, dedicated to the design of the entire car, were divided into groups: body, power train, chassis design, product assurance, and pleasability. The latter would check continuously on the vehicles on the assembly line, with computers in another program monitoring the quality control of every vehicle built. Fisher Body engineers and draftsmen moved in with the Vega personnel.

In October 1968, there was one body style (the &quot;11&quot; style notchback sedan), one engine, one transmission (MB1 Torque-Drive manually shifted two-speed automatic), one base trim level, a bench seat, molded rubber floor covering, no glove box or headliner and no air-conditioning (ventilation was through the upper dash from the wiper plenum). As the market changed, so did the car in development.

In December 1968, hatchback, wagon, and panel delivery styles were added; also floor-level ventilation, and an optional performance engine (&quot;L-11&quot; two-barrel) which, predicted as 20% of production, accounted for 75%. Bucket seats were standard. Hatchback and wagon received carpeting and headliners. Optional air conditioning, predicted as 10% of production, was actually selected 45% of the time.

In February 1969, Opel three- and four-speed transmissions (three-speed standard, others optional); Powerglide were added (now four transmissions); mechanical fuel pump replaced by in-tank electric pump (making this the first GM product with an in tank fuel pump prior to the adoption of fuel injection); power steering option; base &quot;11&quot; style notchback trim upgraded to match hatchback and wagon carpet and headliner.

In April 1969, the car gained gauge-pack cluster, HD suspension, wider tires; adjustable seat back (45% of production); bumpers restyled, lower valance panels added; swing-out quarter window option (10% of production).

In July 1969, an electrically heated rear window option (10% of production); &quot;GT&quot; package, $325.00 extra (35% of production); bright window-frame and roof drip moldings added to hatchback and wagon.

This is essentially how the car launched as a 1971 model. Production began on June 26, 1970. After the national GM strike (September to November 1970), bright roof drip moldings were added to the base &quot;11&quot; notchback, with moldings sent to dealers to update units already in the field.

&quot;Cars&quot; magazine said in 1974 that in the rush to introduce the car with other 1971 models, &quot;[t]ests which should have been at the proving grounds were performed by customers, necessitating numerous piecemeal &#x27;fixes&#x27; by dealers. Chevrolet&#x27;s &#x27;bright star&#x27; received an enduring black eye despite a continuing development program which eventually alleviated most of these initial shortcomings.&quot;

==Design and engineering==

The wheelbase on all models is . Width is . The 1971 and 1972 models are long. The 1973 models are longer due to the front 5 mph bumper. Front and rear 5 mph bumpers on 1974 to 1977 models add another .

The hatchback, with its lower roofline and a fold-down rear seat, accounted for nearly half of all Vegas sold.

The sedan, later named &quot;Notchback&quot;, is the only model with an enclosed trunk, and had the lowest base price. The Kammback wagon has a lower cargo liftover height and a swing-up liftgate.

The panel express had steel panels in place of the wagon&#x27;s rear side glass, an enclosed storage area under the load floor, and a low-back driver&#x27;s seat. An auxiliary passenger seat was optional. The model&#x27;s classification as a truck, with less stringent safety requirements, allowed the low back seat(s).

The aluminum-block, inline-four engine was a joint effort by General Motors, Reynolds Metals, and Sealed Power Corp. The engine and its die-cast block technology were developed by GM engineering staff, then passed to Chevrolet for finalization and production. Ed Cole, involved with the 1955 small-block V8 as chief engineer at Chevrolet and now equally involved with the Vega engine as GM president, often visited the engineering staff engine drafting room on Saturdays, reviewing the design and directing changes, to the consternation of Chevrolet engineers and manufacturing personnel, who knew he wanted a rush job. Cole insisted that the engine didn&#x27;t require a radiator - the heat rejection from the heater core would be sufficient. After many prototype failures, a (small) radiator was added to the vehicle. The engine in development became known in-house as &quot;the world&#x27;s tallest, smallest engine&quot; due to the tall cylinder head.
Its vibration, noise, and tendency to overheat were rectified by 1974.

The Vega&#x27;s suspension, live rear axle, 53.2% front/46.8% rear weight distribution, low center of mass and neutral steering gave good handling. Lateral acceleration capacities were 0.90 g (standard suspension) and 0.93 g (RPO F-41 suspension). Steering box and linkage were ahead of the front wheel centerline, with a cushioned two-piece shaft. Front suspension was by short and long arms, with lower control arm bushings larger than on the 1970 Camaro.
Four-link rear suspension copies the 1970 Chevelle. The design features coil springs front and rear.

The chassis development engineers aimed for full-size American car ride qualities with European handling. Later torque-arm rear suspension eliminated rear wheel hop under panic braking. Brakes (front discs, rear drums) copy an Opel design, with diameter single-piston solid rotors, drums and 70/30 front/rear braking distribution.

All models shared the same hood, fenders, floor pan, lower door panels, rocker panels, engine compartment and front end. In mid-1971, Chevrolet introduced an optional GT package for hatchback and Kammback models, which included the RPO L11 two-barrel 140 engine, F41 handling option, special tires, and trim.

==Model year changes==
For 1972, models had a revised exhaust system and driveline to reduce vibration and noise; also revised shock absorbers. Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic transmission and custom cloth interior were optional and a glove box was added.

For 1973, 300 changes included new exterior and interior colors and new standard interior trim. Front and rear nameplate scripts &quot;Chevrolet Vega 2300&quot; were changed to &quot;Vega by Chevrolet&quot;. To meet the 1973 5 mph front bumper standards the front bumper, on stronger brackets, was extended , with a steel body-color filler panel. US-built Saginaw manual transmissions and a new shift linkage replaced the Opel units. The RPO L11 engine had a new Holley 5210C progressive two-barrel carburetor. New options included BR70-13 white-stripe steel-belted radial tires, full wheel covers, and body side molding with black rubber insert. Two new models were introduced mid-year: the estate wagon with simulated wood grain side and rear accents, and the LX notchback with vinyl roof finish. On May 17, 1973, the millionth Vega left the Lordstown Assembly plant – an orange GT hatchback with white sport stripes, power steering, and neutral custom vinyl interior including exclusive vinyl door panels. A limited-edition &quot;Millionth Vega&quot; was introduced replicating the milestone car, with orange carpeting and Millionth Vega door handle accents. Sixty-five hundred were built from May 1 to July 1. For the first time, cloth upholstery was offered, with the Custom interior in black or blue.

For 1974, the major exterior changes were a revised front end and 5 mph rear bumper, increasing overall length , and a slanted front header panel with recessed headlamp bezels. Louvered steel replaced the egg-crate plastic grille. Front and rear aluminum bumpers with inner steel spring replaced the chrome bumpers, with license plate mountings relocated. A revised rear panel on notchback and hatchback models had larger single-unit taillights, with ventilation grills eliminated from trunk and hatch lids (rear quarter panels on the wagon models). A fuel tank replaced the tank. Side striping replaced the hood and deck stripes for the GT sport stripes option. The custom interior&#x27;s wood-trimmed molded door panels were replaced by vinyl door panels matching the seat trim. January saw plastic front fender liners added after thousands of the fenders were replaced under warranty on 1971–1974 models. In February, the &quot;Spirit of America&quot; limited-edition hatchback was introduced, with a white exterior, white vinyl roof, blue and red striping on body sides, hood and rear-end panel, emblems on front fenders and rear panel, white &quot;GT&quot; wheels, A70-13 raised white-letter tires, white custom vinyl interior, and red accent color carpeting. Seventy-five hundred Vegas were built through May. Sales peaked at 460,374 for the 1974 model year.

The 264 changes for 1975 included H.E.I. (high-energy) electronic ignition and a catalytic converter. New options included power brakes, tilt steering wheel, BR78-13B steel-belted radial tires, and special custom cloth interior for the hatchback and Kammback. In March the Cosworth Vega was introduced with an all-aluminum engine and electronic fuel injection, the first on a Chevrolet passenger car. The panel express version was discontinued at the end of the 1975 model year. Its sales peaked at 7,800 in its first year, then averaged 4,000 per year. Over 1,500 1975 models were sold. Total sales fell to 206,239.
For 1976, Chevrolet claimed 300 changes were made. A facelift included a revised header panel with Chevy bowtie emblem, wider grille, revised headlamp bezels – all in corrosion-resistant material – and new tri-color taillights for the notchback and hatchback (although the amber turn signals were nonfunctional). The cooling and durability of the Dura-Built 2.3 L engine were improved. The chassis received the Monza&#x27;s upgraded components including box-section front cross-member, larger front and rear brakes (with the fronts gaining vented rotors), and torque-arm rear suspension. Extensive anti-rust improvements to the body included galvanized fenders and rocker panels. New models were introduced: GT estate wagon, Cabriolet notchback (with a half-vinyl roof and opera windows similar to the Monza Towne coupe), and a limited-edition Nomad wagon with restyled side windows.

New options included BorgWarner five-speed manual overdrive transmission and houndstooth seat trim named &quot;sport cloth&quot; at an additional $18. A &quot;Sky-Roof&quot; with tinted reflecting sliding glass and an eight-track tape player were options from January. The Cosworth was canceled in July after 1,446 1976 models were built.
For 1977, models had few revisions. The notchback was renamed &quot;coupe&quot;. On the Dura-built 140 engine, a pulse-air system met stricter Federal emission standards. The single-barrel engine and three-speed manual transmission were dropped. Interiors received a color-keyed steering column, steering wheel, instrument-cluster face, and parking-brake cover, with a color-keyed full console a new option. The GT models received black, exterior moldings (lower moldings deleted), black, sport mirrors and wheels, Vega GT bodyside and rear striping as well as a Vega GT ID

==Engine==

The Vega engine is a inline-four with a die-cast aluminum alloy cylinder block, cast-iron cylinder head and single overhead camshaft (SOHC).&lt;ref name=&quot;TAM74/75&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The block is an open-deck design with siamesed cylinder bores. The outer case walls form the water jacket, sealed off by the head and head gasket, and the block has cast-iron main bearing caps and crankshaft. The cast-iron cylinder head was chosen for low cost. A simple overhead valvetrain has three components activating each valve instead of a typical pushrod system&#x27;s seven. An external belt from the crankshaft drives the five-bearing camshaft plus the water pump and fan.
Compression ratio for the standard and optional engine is 8.0:1, as the engine was designed for low-lead and lead-free fuels. The single-barrel carburetor version produces ; the two-barrel version (RPO L11) produces . From 1972, ratings were listed as SAE net. The engine is prone to vibration, which is damped by large rubber engine mounts. The 1972 Rochester DualJet two-barrel carburetor required an air pump for emission certification and was replaced in 1973 with a Holley-built 5210C progressive two-barrel carburetor. The 1973 emission control revisions reduced power from the optional engine by , and its noise levels were lowered. A high energy ignition was introduced on 1975 engines.

Serious problems with the engine led to a redesign for 1976–1977. Marketed as the Dura-Built 140, the new engine had improved coolant pathways, redesigned cylinder head with quieter hydraulic valve lifters, longer-life valve stem seals that reduced oil consumption by 50%, and redesigned water pump, head gasket, and thermostat. Warranty was upgraded to five years or . In 1977 a pulse-air system was added to meet stricter 1977 U.S. exhaust emission regulations and the engine paint color (used on all Chevrolet engines) changed from orange to blue.

In August 1975, Chevrolet conducted an endurance test of three Vegas powered by Dura-Built engines, advertised as a &quot;60,000 miles in 60 days Durability Run&quot;.
Supervised by the United States Auto Club, three pre-production 1976 hatchback coupes with manual transmissions and air conditioning were driven non-stop for in 60 days through the deserts of California and Nevada by nine drivers, covering a total of . With the sole failure a broken timing belt, Vega project engineer Bernie Ernest said GM felt &quot;very comfortable with the warranty.&quot;

In ambient temperatures between and the cars lost of coolant (normal evaporation under the conditions) during the 180,000 miles. They averaged and used one quart of oil per 3,400 miles. Driving expenses averaged 2.17 cents per mile. One of the cars went on display at the 1976 New York Auto Show. The 1976 Vega was marketed as a durable and reliable car.

==Stillborn engines==

===OHC L-10===
The optional L-11 engine was part of the Vega development program from December 1968, initially with a tall iron cylinder head that had an unusual tappet arrangement and side-flow combustion chambers. The Chevrolet engine group then designed an aluminum crossflow cylinder head with single central overhead camshaft, &quot;hemi&quot; combustion chambers, and big valves. This was lighter and about lower than the Vega production head. Although numerous prototypes were built and manufacturing tooling started, the engine did not receive production approval. It would have given higher performance than the iron-head engine, without its differential expansion head gasket problems.

===RC2-206 Wankel===
In November 1970, GM paid $50 million ($ in dollars ) for initial licenses to produce the Wankel rotary engine. GM president Ed Cole projected its release in October 1973 as a 1974 Vega option. The General Motors Rotary Combustion Engine (GMRCE) had two rotors displacing , twin distributors and coils, and an aluminum housing. RC2-206 Wankels were installed in 1973 Vegas for cold weather testing in Canada.

&quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s 1973 article &quot;The &#x27;75 Vega Rotary&quot; said, &quot;[M]ileage will be in the 16–18 mpg range. Compared to the normal piston [engine] Vega&#x27;s 20 to 26 mpg, the whole rotary deal begins to look just a little less attractive, what with the price of gasoline skyrocketing...&quot;

GM thought it could meet 1975 emissions standards with the engine tuned for better fuel economy. Other refinements improved it to , but brought apex seal failures and rotor-tip seal problems. By December 1973 it was clear the Wankel, now planned for the Monza 2+2, would not be ready for either production or emissions certification in time for the start of the 1975 model year. After paying another $10 million ($ in dollars ) against its rotary licence fees, GM announced the first postponement. In April 1974 &quot;Motor Trend&quot; predicted the outcome: on September 24, 1974, Cole postponed the engine, ostensibly due to emissions difficulties. He retired the same month. His successor Pete Estes showed little interest in the engine and GM, citing poor fuel economy, postponed production pending further development. Estes had previously decided to let the Corvair, another Cole project, expire, well before the celebrated attacks of Ralph Nader.

One complete GM Wankel engine exists. It is displayed at the Ypsilanti (MI) Motor Heritage Museum, along with many Corvair cars and exhibits.

===V8===
In July 1972, &quot;Hot Rod&quot; tested a prototype Vega fitted with an all-aluminum V8, the last of several 283 cu in. (4.6 L) units used in the CERV I research and development vehicle. Bored out to , it had high-compression pistons, &quot;097 Duntov&quot; mechanical-lifter camshaft, cast-iron four-barrel intake manifold, and a Quadrajet carburetor. With stock Turbo Hydramatic, stock Vega rear end and street tires, the car ran a sub-14-second quarter-mile.

==Assembly==
GM built the $75 million ($ in dollars ) Lordstown Assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio near Youngstown expressly for assembing the Vega. It was the world&#x27;s most automated auto plant at the time, where approximately 90 percent of each Vega body&#x27;s 3,900 welds were carried out by 75 automatic welding devices. Twenty-six Unimate industrial robots performed ~35% of the welding operations; approximately 55% of the welding operations were performed with conventional automatic welders. Engine and rear axle assemblies were positioned by hydraulic lifts, with bodies moved along the line overhead at per minute. Sub-assembly areas, conveyor belts, and quality control were all computer-directed.

===Production speed===
Production at Lordstown was projected at 100 Vegas an hour—one every 36 seconds—from the outset. Twice the normal production volume, this was the fastest rate in the world. Within months Lordstown produced 73.5 Vegas an hour.

Lordstown workers had 36 seconds to perform their tasks instead of the customary minute. With 25 percent more line workers than needed, they formed groups in which three worked while a fourth rested. Although there were mechanical flaws, the quality of early Vega assembly, e.g. fit and finish, was acceptable. The car earned &quot;Motor Trend&#x27;s&quot; 1971 Car of the Year award. In October 1971, General Motors handed management of Lordstown from Chevrolet and Fisher Body to General Motors Assembly Division (GMAD). GMAD imposed more rigorous discipline and cut costs by dropping the fourth &quot;extra&quot; worker. The United Auto Workers (UAW) said 800 workers were laid off at Lordstown in the first year under GMAD; GMAD said 370. Management accused workers of slowing the line and sabotaging cars by omitting parts and doing shoddy work. Workers said GMAD sped up the line and cut staffing. Quality suffered. In March 1972, the 7,700 workers called a wildcat strike that lasted a month and cost GM $150 million. Vega production rose by over 100,000 units for 1972, and would have been stronger but for the strike. 1975 was a &quot;rolling model change&quot; at 100 cars per hour with no downtime.

As production approached 100 vehicles per hour, problems arose in the paint shop. At 85 units per hour, nearly all required repair. Conventional spray pressures and atomizing tips could not apply the paint fast enough, but increasing pressures and tip aperture sizes produced runs and sags in the finished product. Fisher Body and lacquer paint supplier DuPont, over one weekend, developed new paint chemistry and application specifics: Non-Aqueous Dispersion Lacquer (NAD). The new formulation raised paint shop throughput to 106 units per hour.

===Vertical rail transport===

Although Lordstown Assembly had a purpose-built exit off of the Ohio Turnpike constructed to make shipment easier, the Vega was designed for vertical shipment, nose down. General Motors and Southern Pacific designed &quot;Vert-A-Pac&quot; rail cars to hold 30 Vegas each, compared with conventional tri-level autoracks which held 18. The Vega was fitted with four removable cast-steel sockets on the underside and had plastic spacers — removed at unloading — to protect engine and transmission mounts. The rail car carrier-panels were opened and closed via forklift.

Vibration and low-speed crash tests ensured the cars would not shift or suffer damage in transit. The Vega was delivered topped with fluids, ready to drive to dealerships, so the engine was baffled to prevent oil entering the number one cylinder; the battery filler caps were positioned high on the rear edge of the casing to prevent acid spills; a tube drained fuel from the carburetor to the vapor canister; and the windshield washer bottle stood at 45 degrees. The Vert-A-Pacs were retired after the Vega&#x27;s 1977 model year.

===Production figures===
Total Vega production, mainly from Lordstown, was 2,006,661 including 3,508 Cosworth models. Production peaked at 2,400 units per day. In 1973–1974, Vegas were also built at GM of Canada&#x27;s Sainte-Thérèse Assembly plant in Quebec.


* Does not include an unknown number of 1973 Panel Delivery models, which probably numbered around 4000 units.

==Pricing==
Due mostly to inflation, but also because of emissions and safety mandates, prices of all automobiles rose 50 percent during the Vega&#x27;s seven-year lifespan. The same basic Vega that cost $2090 in 1971 carried a retail price of $3249 by the end of 1977. And since all other cars suffered the same inflationary rise, less expensive cars were in greater demand than those with higher prices which helped Vegas sell. The 1975 Cosworth Vega at $5,918 was priced $892 below the Chevrolet Corvette. &quot;Cosworth. One Vega for the price of two&quot;, as it was advertised, was priced out of the market, and fell well short of its projected sales goal.

==DeLorean influence==
GM Vice President John Z. DeLorean, appointed Chevrolet&#x27;s general manager a year before the Vega&#x27;s introduction, was tasked with overseeing the Vega launch and directing operations at the Lordstown Assembly plant. As problems with the vehicle became apparent, he put additional inspectors and workers on the line and introduced a computerized quality control program in which each car was inspected as it came off the line and, if necessary, repaired. He was also tasked with promoting the car in &quot;Motor Trend&quot; and &quot;Look&quot; magazines. He authorized the Cosworth Vega prototype and requested initiation of production.

In &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s August 1970 issue, DeLorean promoted the upcoming car as one that out-handled &quot;almost any&quot; European sports car, out-accelerated &quot;any car in its price class&quot;, and would be &quot;built at a quality level that has never been attained before in a manufacturing operation in this country, and probably in the world.&quot;

In the 1979 book &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors&quot; by J. Patrick Wright, DeLorean spoke of hostility between Chevrolet Division and GM&#x27;s design and engineering staff; of trying to motivate Chevrolet engineers to resolve the car&#x27;s problems before introduction; and of initiating quality control. He also said, &quot;While I was convinced that we were doing our best with the car that was given to us, I was called upon by the corporation to tout the car far beyond my personal convictions about it.&quot;

==Problems==
Although the Vega sold well from the beginning, the buying public soon questioned the car&#x27;s quality. The issues with the vehicle practically went back to the beginning of its development. For example, the front end of the vehicle separated in only eight miles on the General Motors Test track. The engineers had to add twenty pounds of structural reinforcements to pass durability. In &quot;Comeback:The Fall &amp; Rise of the American Automobile Industry&quot;, the authors write: &quot;In 1972, GM issued three mass recalls, the largest covering 500,000 Vegas, to fix defective axles, balky throttles and problems that caused fires. The Vega&#x27;s aluminum engine was notorious for buckling and leaking.&quot; By May 1972, six out of every seven Vegas produced was the subject of a recall. Development and upgrades continued throughout the car&#x27;s seven-year production run, addressing its engine and cost-related issues.

===Recalls===
The first Vega recall, Chevrolet campaign number 72-C-05, addressed engine backfires on 130,000 cars fitted with the L-11 option two-barrel carburetor. An engine that backfired with specific frequency and magnitude weakened and ruptured the muffler. Hot exhaust gases then, in turn, spilled out and heated the adjacent fuel tank which expanded, ruptured and spilled fuel that ignited and caused a fire. The second recall in early summer 1972, Chevrolet campaign number 72-C-07, involved 350,000 vehicles equipped with the standard engine and single-barrel carburetor. It concerned a perceived risk that a component in the emission-control system (idle stop solenoid bracket) might fall into the throttle linkage, jamming it open. Chevrolet told customers that if the throttle stuck open while driving, to turn off the ignition and brake the vehicle until it stopped.

In July 1972, the company announced the third recall, &quot;in as many months,&quot; campaign number 72-C-09, which affected 526,000 vehicles, the result of which was a rear axle which could separate from the vehicle. As it was recorded by NHTSA, the &quot;axle shaft and wheel could then move outboard of the quarter panel and allow vehicle to drop down onto rear suspension.&quot;

===140 CID engine===
Other quality issues plagued the engine. Faulty valve-stem seals caused excessive oil consumption, but this was not addressed until the release of the updated Dura-built engine in 1976. According to an article in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, &quot;When the engine got hot, which wasn&#x27;t uncommon, the cylinders distorted and the piston rings wore off the exposed silica that was meant to provide a tough wall surface. Then, at best, the cars burned more oil. At worst, the distortion compromised the head gasket.&quot;

With its small capacity and tiny two-tube radiator, the Vega cooling system was adequate when topped off, but owners tended not to check the coolant level often enough, and in combination with leaking valve-stem seals, the engine often ran low on oil and coolant simultaneously. Consequent overheating distorted the open-deck block, allowing antifreeze to seep past the head gasket, which caused piston scuffing inside the cylinders.

Chevrolet added a coolant-overflow bottle and an electronic low-coolant indicator in 1974 that could be retrofitted to earlier models at no cost. Under a revised engine warranty for 1971 to 1975 Vegas, the owner of a damaged engine could choose a replacement with a new short block or a rebuilt steel-sleeved unit, which proved costly for Chevrolet. GM engineer Fred Kneisler maintains that too much emphasis had been put on overheating problems, the real culprits being brittle valve stem seals and too-thin piston plating. Regardless of the cause, damaged cylinder walls were common.

===Fisher Body===

On the early Vegas, Fisher&#x27;s rustproofing process did not treat the entire chassis. The six-stage zinc phosphate rustproofing process began with the untreated steel body shells spending two minutes submerged in a electrophoretic painting vat (Fisher Body Division’s &quot;Elpo&quot; electrophoretic deposition of polymers process) to prime and further protect from rust. Assembled bodies were dried, wet-sanded, sealer-coated, sprayed with acrylic lacquer and baked in a degree oven.

However, there was a process failure during the vat treatment stage because a trapped air pocket prevented the anti-rust coating from reaching a gap between the Vegas’ front fenders and cowl. Under normal driving conditions, this allowed moist debris and salt to build up and rust the untreated steel on early Vegas because they had no protective liners. The finance department had rejected liners as they would have added a $2.28 unit cost. After GM spent millions replacing thousands of corroded fenders under warranty, Chevrolet installed stopgap plastic deflectors in late 1973 and full plastic liners in 1974. Rust also damaged the rocker panels and door bottoms, the area beneath the windshield, and the body above the rockers. It sometimes seized the front suspension cam bolts, preventing alignment work, necessitating removal with a cutting torch and replacement by all-new parts.

From 1976, anti-rust improvements included galvanized steel fenders and rocker panels; &quot;four-layer&quot; fender protection with zinc-coated and primed inner fenders; wheel-well protective mastic; zinc-rich pre-prime coating on inner doors; expandable sealer between rear quarter panel and wheel housing panel; and corrosion-resistant grill and headlamp housings.

The 1976 to 1977 Dura-Built 140 engine had improved engine block coolant pathways, redesigned head gasket, water pump and thermostat, and a five-year/ warranty.

==Reception==
Initially, the Vega received awards and praise, but subsequently, there were lasting criticisms.

The Vega received awards including &quot;1971 car of the year&quot;
and &quot;1973 car of the year in the economy class&quot;; from &quot;Motor Trend&quot;; &quot;best economy sedan&quot; in 1971, 1972 and 1973 from &quot;Car and Driver&quot;; and the 1971 award for &quot;excellence in design in transportation equipment&quot; from &quot;American Iron and Steel Institute&quot;.

Favorable reviews at launch included &quot;Motor Trend&quot; which in 1970 described the Vega as enjoyable, functional, comfortable, with good handling, and ride;
&quot;Road and Track&quot; who praised its visibility, freeway cruising and economy. and others who praised the 2300 engine&#x27;s simplicity, the handling package and brakes, and one said the car was well matched to the tastes and needs of the 1970s,

Others praised its looks.

Comparisons with other contemporary cars such as the Ford Pinto, Volkswagen Beetle, AMC Gremlin, and Toyota Corolla were done by a number of magazines. The Vega came out well, scoring praise for its combination of performance and economy&quot;; as well as its speed, comfort, quietness and better ride. &quot;Road and Track&#x27;s&quot; editor, John R. Bond said in September 1970, &quot;I think the Vega is, beyond a doubt, the best handling passenger car ever built in the U.S. It has many other good qualities, but the road holding impressed and surprised me most of all.&quot;

The Center for Auto Safety criticized the car. A letter from its founder Ralph Nader to GM chairman Richard Gerstenberg contained a list of safety allegations, and said the car was a &quot;sloppily crafted, unreliable and unsafe automobile&quot; that &quot;hardly set a good example in small car production for American industry&quot;. Criticisms continued long after production ceased. In 1979, &quot;Popular Science&quot; said free repairs in the 1970s cost tens of millions, continuing up to two years after the warranty ran out. A 1990 &quot;Time&quot; article said the Vega was &quot;a poorly engineered car notorious for rust and breakdowns.&quot; In 1991, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine called the Vega costlier and more troublesome than its rivals.

Joe Sherman&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;In the Rings of Saturn&quot; said that &quot;by its third recall, ninety-five percent of all Vegas manufactured before May 1972 had critical safety flaws&quot;, and that the model&#x27;s &quot;checkered history only reinforced the belief that GM made inferior small cars. This legacy would prove far more important than any direct impact the Vega would have on GM&#x27;s profits.&quot; &quot;Motor Trend&quot; said in its September 1999 &quot;50th Anniversary Issue&quot;: &quot;The Vega seemed well placed to set the standard for subcompacts in the 70s, but it was troubled by one of the most vulnerable Achilles heels in modern automotive history: an alloy four-cylinder engine block that self-destructed all too easily, and all too often. Once the word got out, the damage was done, even though the engine had been revamped.&quot; The April 2000 issue of &quot;Collectible Automobile&quot; magazine said: &quot;The Chevy Vega has become a symbol of all the problems Detroit faced in the 70&#x27;s.&quot; Robert Freeland&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;The Struggle for Control of the Modern Corporation&quot; said &quot;poor planning and perfunctory implementation ... led to an extremely poor quality automobile beset by mechanical problems.&quot;

In his 2010 book &quot;Generation Busted,&quot; author Alan Zemek said, &quot;Chevrolet&#x27;s answer to the Japanese car, left it with a black eye.&quot;

Websites have included the Vega in lists of worst cars, for example &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;,
&quot;Car and Driver&quot;, and Edmunds.com. In 2010, John Pearley Huffman of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; summed up the Vega as &quot;the car that nearly destroyed GM.&quot; In 2010, after driving a preserved, original &#x27;73 Vega GT, Frank Markus of &quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; said, &quot;After a few gentle miles, I begin to understand how this car won its awards and comparison tests. Well-maintained examples are great looking, nice-driving, economical classics—like Baltic Ave. with a Hotel, the best ones can be had for $10K or less.&quot;

In 2013, Frank Markus of &quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; said, &quot;Overblown—The China Syndrome might have over hyped the TMI (Three-Mile Island) incident as bad press might have exaggerated the Vega&#x27;s woes.&quot;

==Rebadged variants==
Vega body styles were used for several badge engineered variants. The 1973 to 1977 Pontiac Astre had Vega bodies (and Vega engines through 1976). The 1978 to 1979 Chevrolet Monza and Pontiac Sunbird wagons used the Vega Kammback wagon body with engines by Pontiac and Buick. The Monza S used the Vega hatchback body.

==XP-898 concept==
In 1973, Chevrolet presented the XP-898 concept car using many Vega components, including the engine, and using a construction method intended to explore vehicle crashworthiness at high speed: a fiberglass foam sandwich body and chassis in four sections with rigid urethane foam infill.

==Motorsport==

===&quot;Car and Driver&quot;&#x27;s showroom stock No. 0===

In the early 1970s &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine challenged its readers to a series of Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) races for showroom stock sedans at Lime Rock Park, Connecticut – &quot;The Car and Driver SS/Sedan Challenge&quot;. Bruce Cargill (representing the readers) won &quot;Challenge I&quot; in 1972 in a Dodge Colt, and Patrick Bedard, &quot;C&amp;D&#x27;s&quot; executive writer, won &quot;Challenge II&quot; in 1973 in an Opel 1900, &quot;Challenge III&quot; was the tie-breaker in 1974.

On October 12, 1974 &quot;C&amp;D&#x27;s&quot; 1973 Vega GT No. 0, driven by Bedard, &quot;outran every single Opel, Colt, Pinto, Datsun, Toyota and Subaru on the starting grid [...] It had done the job – this Vega GT faced off against 31 other well-driven showroom stocks and it had finished first.

After Bedard purchased the year-old Vega in California for $1,900, former Chevrolet engineer Doug Roe – a Vega specialist – told him to &quot;overfill it about a quart. &quot;When you run them over 5,000 rpm, all the oil stays up in the head and you&#x27;ll wipe the bearings. And something has to be done with the crankcase vents. If you don&#x27;t it&#x27;ll pump all that oil into the intake.&quot; Roe added that 215 degrees was normal and only above 230 degrees would the engine probably detonate.

Bedard said, &quot;Five laps from the end I discovered that once the tank drops below a quarter full, the fuel wouldn&#x27;t pick up in the right turns. Twice per lap the carburetor would momentarily run dry. And if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, the temperature gauge read exactly 230 degrees and a white Opel was on my tail as unshakably as a heat-seeking missile. But it was also clear that no matter how good a driver Don Knowles was and no matter how quick his Opel, he wasn&#x27;t going to get by if the Vega simply stayed alive. Which it did. You have to admire a car like that. If it wins, it must be the best, never mind all of the horror stories you hear, some of them from me.&quot;

<text>The Stones River (properly spelled Stone&#x27;s River) is a major stream of the eastern portion of Tennessee&#x27;s Nashville Basin region and a tributary of the Cumberland River. It is named after explorer and longhunter Uriah Stone, who navigated the river in 1767.

==Geography and hydrography==

The Stones River is composed of three major forks: the West, Middle, and East forks. The West Fork, long, rises in southernmost Rutherford County near the Bedford County line. The upstream portion of its course runs roughly parallel to U.S. Highway 231. The Middle Fork, long, rises in an area of low hills, or knobs, also near the line with Bedford County, near Hoovers Gap, an important troop movement route during the American Civil War. It flows roughly parallel to, but west of, Interstate 24 and U.S. Highway 41, and is met by the West Fork near State Route 99. The East Fork is the longest, at ; it rises in Cannon County on Short Mountain, an outlier of the Cumberland Plateau, and flows through Woodbury, the county seat. This stream is roughly paralleled by U.S. Route 70S.

The West Fork runs just west of downtown Murfreesboro. Just northwest of Murfreesboro along the West Fork is the Stones River National Battlefield, site of the Battle of Stones River, a major Civil War battle that was fought from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863. The East Fork runs well to the north of Murfreesboro, adjacent to the grounds of the Alvin C. York Veterans Affairs hospital, and is crossed by U.S. Highway 231 near the community of Walterhill, site of a former hydroelectric dam used for a power supply for the surrounding area prior to the advent of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Near this site is a gigantic landfill operated by Browning-Ferris Industries.

===Reservoir===
The confluence of the two major forks occurs in northeastern Rutherford County near Smyrna. At the confluence, both are already somewhat slack because of the impoundment of J. Percy Priest Dam, a United States Army Corps of Engineers development constructed during the 1960s and named for a former Nashville Congressman. The impoundment of the reservoir led to major change in residential growth patterns in Nashville during the late 1960s and 1970s because people desired to live near the lake, which is highly developed with boat ramps, marinas, parks and other recreational areas, campgrounds, and even an artificial beach area.

In 1979 the dam was bombed with dynamite as ruse to cover a crime spree supposed to have taken place in the resultant massive flooding. The conspirators succeeded only in destroying some iron doors at the dam&#x27;s base. The suspects were later convicted and sentenced to substantial prison terms.
The dam is visible from the bridge just below it on Interstate 40; just below the dam is a desirable fishing area under certain discharge conditions, but in recent years access has at times been limited because of security concerns. Also just below the dam is the trail-head of the Stones River Greenway, an important part of the Nashville Greenways Project.

===Tailwaters===

Between Percy Priest Dam and the mouth of the Stones River, the river flows through Clover Bottom, a large flood plain and site of a former plantation whose Clover Bottom Mansion house, after many years of disuse, neglect, and vandalism, is now the headquarters for the Tennessee Historical Commission. &quot;Clover Bottom&quot; was once the name of a nearby custodial school for mentally disabled children and adults. The immediate area is also the site of a state mental hospital and the Tennessee School for the Blind. Clover Bottom also is the separation of the Nashville neighborhoods of Donelson and Hermitage.

Near the mouth of the Stones River into the Cumberland River, below the bridge on U.S. Highway 70, is a private golf club. The Stones River is now thought of primarily in terms of its major impoundment, Percy Priest Lake, and is important to the Nashville area. The flood control provided by the dam has been important to the reduction of flooding downstream in the downtown Nashville area, as well as in the entire Cumberland Valley.

<doc id="879611" wikidata="Q376303" url="?curid=879611" title="Norman Davies">
<text>Ivor Norman Richard Davies (born 8 June 1939) is a British and Polish historian, known for his publications on the history of Europe, Poland and the United Kingdom. He has a special interest in Central and Eastern Europe and is UNESCO Professor at the Jagiellonian University, professor emeritus at University College London, a visiting professor at the Collège d&#x27;Europe, and an honorary fellow at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford. He was granted Polish citizenship in 2014.

== Academic career ==

Davies was born to Richard and Elizabeth Davies in Bolton, Lancashire. He is of Welsh descent. He studied in Grenoble, France, from 1957 to 1958 and then under A. J. P. Taylor at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he earned a BA in history in 1962. He was awarded an MA at the University of Sussex in 1966 and also studied in Perugia, Italy. Davies intended to study for a PhD in the Soviet Union but was denied an entry visa, so he went to Kraków, Poland, instead. Davies studied at the Jagiellonian University and did research on the Polish–Soviet War. As this war was denied in the official communist Polish historiography of that time, he was obliged to change the title of his dissertation to &quot;The British Foreign Policy towards Poland, 1919–20&quot;. After he obtained his PhD in Kraków in 1968, the English text was published in 1972 under the title &quot;White Eagle, Red Star. The Polish–Soviet War 1919–20&quot;.

From 1971, Davies taught Polish history at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, where he was professor from 1985 to 1996, when he retired. He subsequently became at Wolfson College, Oxford, from 1997 to 2006. Throughout his career, Davies has lectured in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, China, Poland and in most of the rest of Europe as well.

Stanford University&#x27;s history department denied Davies a tenured faculty position in 1986 (on an 11 against, 10 for and 1 abstaining, vote). The decision was described as &quot;the closest, most acrimonious tenure decision of recent years&quot;. After failing to arrange a formal review hearing of the decision, Davies filed a lawsuit against History Professor Harold Kahn and 29 other Stanford professors. This case was dismissed when Davies was unable to depose Kahn. Davies subsequently sought to obtain $3 million in damages from the university, arguing he had been the victim of discrimination on the grounds of his political views (with the claim being &quot;defamation,&quot; &quot;breach of contract&quot; and &quot;tortious interference&quot; with a business). The court ruled that because of California&#x27;s right of privacy &quot;even if we assume that... a candidate may be denied tenure for improper&quot; [e.g., defamatory] &quot;reasons, we are of the opinion that the right of a faculty member to discuss with his colleagues the candidate&#x27;s qualifications thoroughly and candidly, in confidence and without fear of compelled disclosure, is of such paramount value that it ought not to be impaired.&quot; The court upheld the university&#x27;s right to decide on faculty appointments on the basis of any criteria.

Davies is a visiting professor at the Collège d&#x27;Europe.

== Work ==

Davies&#x27; first book, &quot;White Eagle, Red Star: The Polish-Soviet War, 1919–20&quot; was published in 1972.

His 1981 book &quot;God&#x27;s Playground&quot;, a comprehensive overview of Polish history, was published officially in Poland only after the fall of communism. In 1984, Davies published &quot;Heart of Europe&quot;, a briefer, more essay-like history of Poland, in which the chapters are arranged in reverse chronological order.

In the 1990s, Davies published &quot;&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Isles: A History&quot; (1999), about Europe and the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, respectively. Each book is a narrative interlarded with numerous sidepanel discussions of microtopics.

In 2000, Davies&#x27; Polish publishers &quot;Znak&quot; published a collection of his essays and articles under the title &quot;Smok wawelski nad Tamizą&quot; (&quot;The Wawel Dragon on the Thames&quot;).

In 2002, at the suggestion of the city&#x27;s mayor, Bogdan Zdrojewski, Davies and his former research assistant, Roger Moorhouse, co-wrote a history of Wrocław / Breslau, a Silesian city. Titled &quot;&quot;, the book was published simultaneously in English, Polish and German, and was later translated into Czech, French and Italian.

Davies also writes essays and articles for the mass media. Among others, he has worked for the BBC as well as British and American magazines and newspapers, such as &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;. In Poland, his articles appeared in the liberal Catholic weekly &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot;.

Davies&#x27; book &quot;Rising &#x27;44. The Battle for Warsaw&quot; describes the Warsaw Uprising. It was followed by &quot;Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory&quot; (2006).
In 2008 Davies participated in the documentary film &quot;The Soviet Story&quot;.

== Awards and distinctions ==
Davies holds a number of honorary titles and memberships, including honorary doctorates from the universities of the Jagiellonian University (since 2003), Lublin, Gdańsk and Warsaw (since 2007), memberships in the Polish Academy of Learning (PAU), the Academia Scientiarum et Artium Europaea, and the International Honorary Council of the European Academy of Diplomacy, and fellowships of the British Academy and the Royal Historical Society.
Davies received an honorary DLitt degree from his alma mater the University of Sussex. Davies is also an honorary citizen of Polish cities of Warsaw, Wrocław, Lublin, and Kraków, and a member of the committee for the Order of the Smile.

Edward Bernard Raczyński, President of the Polish government-in-exile, decorated Davies with the Order of Polonia Restituta. On 22 December 1998 President of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski awarded him the Grand Cross (1st class) of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. Finally, on 11 November 2012, Davies was decorated with the Order of the White Eagle, Poland&#x27;s highest civilian award.

In 2001, Davies was made a companion of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George for service to Central European history.

Davies has been appointed to the advisory board of the European Association of History Educators—EUROCLIO. In 2008, he was awarded the Order of the Cross of St Mary&#x27;s Land 3rd Class by the Republic of Estonia.

Davies also received Knight of Freedom Award in 2006 for his promotion of Polish history and the values represented by General Casimir Pulaski.

In 2012, he received the Aleksander Gieysztor Prize for his promotion of Polish cultural heritage abroad.

In 2019 he was accepted by Swedish Academy to the list of literature Nobel Prize candidates. The information was announced during author&#x27;s meeting in Gniezno, Poland.

== Political views ==
Davies disagrees with the historical policy of the Law and Justice party. He stated in 2017 that &quot;PiS wants to politicize history to a degree unseen in the last 25 years&quot;.

Davies himself argues that &quot;Holocaust scholars need have no fears that rational comparisons might threaten that uniqueness. Quite the opposite.&quot; and that &quot;one needs to re-construct mentally the fuller picture in order to comprehend the true enormity of Poland&#x27;s wartime cataclysm, and then to say with absolute conviction &#x27;Never Again&#x27;.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Davies married Maria Korzeniewicz, a Polish scholar born in Dąbrowa Tarnowska. He lives in Oxford and Kraków, and has two sons. His uncle Donny died in the Munich air disaster.

Davies was initially a member of the Congregational Church in Bolton, but converted to Roman Catholicism. His mother was a devout Christian and a nonconformist Protestant. In an interview for Aleteia in 2018, Davies stated that he converted to Roman Catholicism in Poland and believed in divine providence based on the doctrine of providence of St Augustine. He also expressed his respect for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and once attended the Ukrainian Orthodox liturgy. Polish journalist Jan Wróbel called Davies a &quot;liberal Catholic and open-minded patriot&quot;.

<text>Swisher Hygiene Inc. is a sanitation company in the United States which until 2015 traded on the NASDAQ. Originally a janitorial service company, two-thirds of its revenue are now generated by selling cleaning and sanitizing chemicals.

== History ==
Swisher was founded by Patrick Swisher to provide cleaning products and services for restaurants and other businesses. In November 2004, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, entrepreneurs Wayne Huizenga and Steve Berrard bought the firm for a reported $14 million.

Huizenga and Berrard paid Patrick $8.1 million for more than 900,000 shares to obtain a majority stake in the company. They operated Swisher as a private company until November 2, 2010, when Swisher became publicly traded through a reverse takeover of CoolBrands International Inc.

CoolBrands was once a major frozen food and dessert manufacturer based in Markham, Ontario. Due to financial problems, it had sold its core operating businesses (including Breyers yoghurt, Eskimo Pie and Chipwich) in 2007 and was little more than an empty corporate shell, but was still listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Swisher, through the reverse takeover, acquired the strength of CoolBrands&#x27; balance sheet and CoolBrands&#x27; status as a publicly traded enterprise.

As a publicly traded company, Swisher could pay in stock or partially in stock for acquisitions of other companies. It went on an acquisition spree in 2011, purchasing 54 different businesses nominally valued at $220 million. The acquisitions increased gross revenue but did not bring the company to profitability.

Swisher had purchased Fort Lauderdale-based Choice Environmental Services in February 2011 for $50 million in stock and an assumption of $41.5 million in debt. Glenn Miller and Neal Rodrigue, the former owners of Choice Environmental Services, had become the fourth-largest shareholders in Swisher under a merger agreement but were restricted from selling any of their shares, causing them substantial losses when the stock plummeted. They later sued.

The company had to re-state its 2011 financial information due to accounting irregularities, increasing that year&#x27;s losses by $4.8 million before taxes. It incurred repeated quarterly losses through much of 2012, a year for which it missed Toronto Stock Exchange deadlines for both quarterly and annual financial reports. At one point, NASDAQ had threatened to de-list the stock due to reporting delays.

On November 15, 2012, Swisher sold Choice Environmental Services to Waste Services of Florida for $125,000,000 in cash, using the money to repay debt.

The company&#x27;s losses extended into 2012 and 2013. Thomas Byrne, previously president of Viacom and vice-chairman of Blockbuster Video, became Swisher&#x27;s Interim President and CEO in February 2013 in an attempt to turn the company around. Wayne Huizenga, who worked with Byrne at Blockbuster, became chairman of the board. The company&#x27;s stock by mid-year was trading below a dollar a share and the company lost $3/share in 2013, losses which continued into 2014.

On June 4, 2014, a reverse stock split replaced every ten existing shares in Swisher with one new share, as the company had to be brought out of penny stock territory and back above $1/share to retain a NASDAQ listing. , the stock was trading slightly above $4/share.

On Nov 2, 2015, the company&#x27;s US operations were sold to Ecolab for $40.2 million and the company no longer has operating assets or revenue producing operations in the US.

<text>The Spinone Italiano is an Italian breed of hunting dog, traditionally used for tracking, for pointing and for retrieving game.

== History ==

The origins of the Spinone are unknown. Rough-haired dogs of pointer type have been present in the Italian peninsula at least since the Renaissance. In a fresco painted by Andrea Mantegna in about 1470 in the Camera degli Sposi of the Ducal Palace of Mantua, in Lombardy, in northern Italy, a dog of this kind is shown lying under the chair of the duke, Ludovico III Gonzaga. Jacques Espée de Sélincourt, in his of 1683, says of griffon dogs that &quot;the best come from Italy and from Piedmont&quot;.

The modern Spinone originated in Piedmont, in north-western Italy, in the nineteenth century and was for some time the most important hunting breed of that region. During the Second World War it was much used by the partisans, both to track enemies and to carry food. After the War, breed numbers were much reduced; a breed society, the Famiglia dello Spinone, was formed in 1949, and the breed was reconstituted from about 1950 onwards. The Spinone was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1955. A second breed society, the Club Italiano Spinoni, was established in 1973.

In the period from 2010 to 2018, new registrations in Italy varied from about 400 to about 650 per year; in every year, the orange-and-white colouring represented slightly over half of the total.

== Characteristics ==

The Spinone is roughly square in outline when seen from the side – the length of the body is approximately equal to the height at the withers. It is a strong, well-muscled and solidly-built dog suitable for hunting over any kind of ground. It swims well and enters cold or deep water without hesitation.

The coat is rough, thick and flat, with little undercoat; it is about long, rather shorter on the head, feet and front of the legs. Hair on the eyebrows and lips is longer and stiffer, thus forming a thick moustache and beard. It may be: solid white; white with orange speckling or markings; white with chestnut brown markings; or brown or orange roan.

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 11.9 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. Neurological disorders that have been identified in the breed include cerebellar abiotrophy and idiopathic epilepsy.

<text>Nether Edge and Sharrow Ward, which includes the districts of Nether Edge, Sharrow, Abbeydale, Brincliffe and parts of Banner Cross, Heeley and Highfield, is one of the 28 electoral wards in the City of Sheffield, England. It is located in the south west of the city and covers an area of . In 2011, the population of this ward was 18,890 people in 7,592 households. Nether Edge &amp; Sharrow ward is one of the wards that make up the Sheffield Central parliamentary constituency.

== History ==
Before the 19th century, the area that is now Nether Edge was largely rural and part of Ecclesall Bierlow, the only clusters of cottages being the small medieval hamlet of Cherry Tree Hill and a small hamlet at Machon Bank. Much of the development of the area was undertaken by George Wostenholm, a local cutler who from 1836 onward purchased a large area of land east of Brincliffe Edge.

Wostenholm&#x27;s home, Kenwood House, and the surrounding park (now the Kenwood Hall Hotel) took up a large portion of the land, the garden designer, Robert Marnock laid out the surrounding roads as a series of curving avenues and the remaining land sold off for development. As a result, many of the homes in the area are spacious Victorian houses that were owned by local cutlers and businessmen.

The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 (PLAA) allowed parishes to form unions, jointly responsible for the administration and funding of Poor Law in their area. By 1831 the population of the area had increased considerably and in 1837 the ‘Ecclesall Bierlow Poor Law Union’ (PLD or Poor Law District) was founded and Ecclesall Bierlow Union Workhouse, Cherry Tree Hill, Nether Edge was built. In 1929 the workhouse was renamed Nether Edge Hospital housing a Gynaecology Unit established to serve the whole of Sheffield.

==Districts of Nether Edge &amp; Sharrow ward==

===Nether Edge=== 
Nether Edge () is an established residential suburb in the southwest of the City of Sheffield, England.

Local facilities include a small shopping area at the junction of Nether Edge Road and Machon Bank Road, featuring a cafe, arts &amp; crafts shops, a dentist, organic fruit &amp; vegetable shop, a local baker, delicatessen / cafes, barber and hairdresser shops, a local mini-market, supermarket among others. Two small theatres (the Merlin and the Lantern) also exist in the area. A farmers market selling local food produce and craft goods is held four times a year in the central area on dates roughly coinciding with the equinoxes and solstice dates.

====Brincliffe====
Brincliffe is a small neighbourhood located to the North west of Nether Edge. It is characterised by large Victorian and Edwardian villas and low-density housing. 

The Sheffield Polytechnic Art College was in Brincliffe, on Psalter Lane.

Chelsea Park, and nearby Brincliffe Edge Woods are also in this area between Nether Edge and Ecclesall.

===Banner Cross===
Banner Cross is a neighbourhood of Ecclesall centred on the intersection of Ecclesall Road and Psalter Lane. Banner Cross is split evenly between Nether Edge &amp; Sharrow ward and Ecclesall Ward. Banner Cross Hall, an ancient esquire seat, was virtually rebuilt in 1820. The main place of worship is Banner Cross Methodist Church. The nearby Banner Cross pub gained infamy when the notorious criminal Charles Peace shot and killed Arthur Dyson in the passageway beside the pub on 29 November 1876. The base of an old stone cross still remained at Banner Cross in 1819. Addy (1888) suggested that the name derives from &quot;bæna kross&quot;, meaning the cross of prayers.

===Sharrow===

In the modern-era Sharrow is now largely a built up urban inner city area, located directly southwest of Sheffield city centre. Sharrow was urbanized between 1830 and 1850 when &quot;Little Sheffield&quot;, a village and adjunct to the main town of Sheffield was redeveloped to cope with the rapidly increasing growth in population. Separated from Sheffield town by the &quot;uninhabited, barren, gorse-covered, Sheffield Moor&quot;. 

====Abbeydale====
Abbeydale is the area of, and streets around Abbeydale Road, and extends from Sharrow up to Archer Road. The main shopping district lies between Heeley, Sharrow and Nether Edge.

<doc id="879634" wikidata="Q7894869" url="?curid=879634" title="University Parks">
<text>The Oxford University Parks, commonly referred to locally as the University Parks, or just The Parks, is a large parkland area slightly northeast of the city centre in Oxford, England. The park is bounded to the east by the River Cherwell, though a small plot of land called Mesopotamia sits between the upper and lower levels of the river. To the north of the parks are Norham Gardens (with large houses including Gunfield backing onto the park) and Lady Margaret Hall, to the west the Parks Road, and the Science Area on South Parks Road to the south. The park is open to the public during the day, and has gardens, large sports fields, and exotic plants. It includes a cricket ground used by Oxford University Cricket Club.

==History==

Part of the land on which the Parks is located had been used for recreation for a long time, and it formed part of the University Walks said to have been used by Charles II to walk his dog in 1685. The land originally belonged to Merton College, and in 1853/1854, the University of Oxford purchased from Merton College to build the parks. Over an eleven-year period a total of of land was eventually acquired. A portion of this land (4 acres) was set aside for the University Museum which was built between 1855 and 1860. Between 1912 and early 1950s, a further portion was used to build the Science Area, so the current site measures around .

The Parks was laid out in 1864, and the work was supervised by William Baxter, who was later appointed the first superintendent of the parks in 1866. Parts of the Parks were designated to be used for sports and recreational purposes. 25 acres of the land had been set aside as the University Cricket Grounds, and the cricket pavilion was built in 1881. The Parks is also used for other sports such as rugby football, hockey, lacrosse, tennis and croquet. The rest of The Parks was designed as an arboretum, and the first trees were planted in 1865. A number of other features have been added over the years.

Dan Winter has been superintendent of the Parks since 2017, replacing Walter Sawyer.

Since August 2020, Michelle Cooper has taken over as acting superintendent.

A 5 km parkrun event launched on 5 February 2022 in University Parks. University Parks parkrun takes place at 9am every Saturday morning, starting at the Tentorium in the centre of the Parks.

==Cricket ground==
The Parks has been the home ground of Oxford University Cricket Club since 1881. The cricket ground at The Parks was secured through the Master of Pembroke, Evan Evans obtaining a lease on 10 acres of land there in 1881. The pavilion was designed by Thomas G. Jackson, architect of many nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Oxford buildings, including the University&#x27;s Examination Schools. The building has three gables, the central one containing the clock, and is topped by a cupola &#x27;of almost absurd height&#x27; and weather-vane. The pavilion contains a Long Room.

Before moving to The Parks, the University Cricket Club played on the Magdalen Ground and Bullingdon Green. The Magdalen Ground was used from the University Cricket Club&#x27;s first match in 1829 to 1880 while Bullingdon Green was used for two matches in 1843.
The cricket ground was the only first-class cricket ground in the UK where spectators could watch free of charge as admission cannot be charged for entry into the Parks. The club has therefore occasionally taken major matches to three other grounds in Oxford. The most used is the Christ Church Ground, which hosted 37 matches between 1878 and 1961. Twenty-one of these matches were against the Australians, played between 1882 and 1961. The club also used New College Ground for two matches in 1906 and 1907 against Yorkshire and the South Africans respectively. One match in 1912 against the South Africans was played at the Magdalen Ground. The club has also played certain minor matches at the Merton College Ground, the St Edward&#x27;s School Ground and the St Catherine&#x27;s College Ground.

The Parks was the venue for Durham&#x27;s inaugural first-class match when they played Oxford University there in April 1992.

The Parks has been, since 2000, home to the ECB Oxford University Centre of Cricketing Excellence, a partnership between the University of Oxford, Oxford Brookes University and the England and Wales Cricket Board. Prior to the 2010 season, the UCCE was rebranded as Oxford Marylebone Cricket Club University (MCCU). The University Match against Cambridge is the only one in which a true Oxford University Cricket Club team takes part: i.e., composed entirely of current Oxford students. 

From 2002 to 2018, The Parks hosted the first-class Varsity Match in even-numbered years. The last first-class match at The Parks was the 2019 Oxford MCCU vs Hampshire, before the end of first-class university cricket in 2020, with the 2020 Varsity Match being played at Fenners. The Parks also hosted two List A matches for the club and twenty-two matches for the Combined Universities in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup between 1973 and 1998.

==Points of interest==
The following features of the Parks are of special interest:

* Cricket pavilion — the pavilion was designed by Sir Thomas Jackson. The cricket ground and pavilion are used by the Oxford University Cricket Club. The two ends of the pitch are the Pavilion End and the Norham Gardens End.
* Seven large giant sequoias planted in about 1888.
* A duck pond with water lilies and a small island, constructed in 1925.
* High Bridge, built during 1923–24 as a relief project for the unemployed. It is usually called Rainbow Bridge, because of its shape.
* Genetic Garden — an experimental garden established by Professor Cyril Darlington to demonstrate evolutionary processes.
* &quot;Styphnolobium japonicum&quot;, known as the Japanese Pagoda Tree. Planted in 1888.
* Coronation Clump, a clump of trees planted to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

<text>Banyan Systems, Inc., was founded in 1983 by Anand Jagannathan, a software engineer and mid-level manager at Data General, Larry Floryan and David C. Mahoney. The company&#x27;s distinctive logo was a Banyan tree and the logo&#x27;s allegorical representation was of Banyan&#x27;s product suite, Banyan VINES. Jim Allchin, although not a founder, was one of the first employees hired. The company was headquartered in Westboro, Massachusetts, along the high-tech I-495 corridor.

Banyan was a privately held entity for nearly ten years after its incorporation. Later the company went public. Subsequently it went into decline, facing competition from Novell NetWare and even more so from Microsoft Windows NT.

In 1997, the company changed its name to Banyan Worldwide. In October 1999 Banyan Worldwide became , an internet services company providing collaboration, security and identity management solutions. At the same time, it announced the obsolescence of VINES and other Banyan products. On October 24, 2003 announced that it would cease operations and its assets would be acquired by Unisys.

<text>In probability theory, the joint probability distribution is the probability distribution of all possible pairs of outputs of two random variables that are defined on the same probability space. The joint distribution can just as well be considered for any given number of random variables. The joint distribution encodes the marginal distributions, i.e. the distributions of each of the individual random variables and the conditional probability distributions, which deal with how the outputs of one random variable are distributed when given information on the outputs of the other random variable(s).

In the formal mathematical setup of measure theory, the joint distribution is given by the pushforward measure, by the map obtained by pairing together the given random variables of the sample space&#x27;s probability measure.

In the case of real-valued random variables, the joint distribution, as a particular multivariate distribution, may be expressed by a multivariate cumulative distribution function, or by a multivariate probability density function together with a multivariate probability mass function. In the special case of continuous random variables, it is sufficient to consider probability density functions, and in the case of discrete random variables, it is sufficient to consider probability mass functions.

==Examples==

===Draws from an urn===

Each of two urns contains twice as many red balls as blue balls, and no others, and one ball is randomly selected from each urn, with the two draws independent of each other. Let formula_1 and formula_2 be discrete random variables associated with the outcomes of the draw from the first urn and second urn respectively. The probability of drawing a red ball from either of the urns is , and the probability of drawing a blue ball is . The joint probability distribution is presented in the following table:

Each of the four inner cells shows the probability of a particular combination of results from the two draws; these probabilities are the joint distribution. In any one cell the probability of a particular combination occurring is (since the draws are independent) the product of the probability of the specified result for A and the probability of the specified result for B. The probabilities in these four cells sum to 1, as with all probability distributions.

Moreover, the final row and the final column give the marginal probability distribution for A and the marginal probability distribution for B respectively. For example, for A the first of these cells gives the sum of the probabilities for A being red, regardless of which possibility for B in the column above the cell occurs, as . Thus the marginal probability distribution for formula_1 gives formula_1&#x27;s probabilities &quot;unconditional&quot; on formula_2, in a margin of the table.

===Coin flips===
Consider the flip of two fair coins; let formula_1 and formula_2 be discrete random variables associated with the outcomes of the first and second coin flips respectively. Each coin flip is a Bernoulli trial and has a Bernoulli distribution. If a coin displays &quot;heads&quot; then the associated random variable takes the value 1, and it takes the value 0 otherwise. The probability of each of these outcomes is , so the marginal (unconditional) density functions are

:formula_8
:formula_9

The joint probability mass function of formula_1 and formula_2 defines probabilities for each pair of outcomes. All possible outcomes are
:formula_12
Since each outcome is equally likely the joint probability mass function becomes
:formula_13

Since the coin flips are independent, the joint probability mass function is the product
of the marginals:
:formula_14

===Rolling a die===
Consider the roll of a fair die and let formula_15 if the number is even (i.e. 2, 4, or 6) and formula_16 otherwise. Furthermore, let formula_17 if the number is prime (i.e. 2, 3, or 5) and formula_18 otherwise.
Then, the joint distribution of formula_1 and formula_2, expressed as a probability mass function, is
:formula_21
:formula_22

These probabilities necessarily sum to 1, since the probability of &quot;some&quot; combination of formula_1 and formula_2 occurring is 1.

== Marginal probability distribution ==

If more than one random variable is defined in a random experiment, it is important to distinguish between the joint probability distribution of X and Y and the probability distribution of each variable individually. The individual probability distribution of a random variable is referred to as its marginal probability distribution. In general, the marginal probability distribution of X can be determined from the joint probability distribution of X and other random variables.

If the joint probability density function of random variable X and Y is formula_25 , the marginal probability density function of X and Y, which defines the marginal distribution, is given by:

formula_26
&lt;br&gt;
formula_27

where the first integral is over all points in the range of (X,Y) for which X=x and the second integral is over all points in the range of (X,Y) for which Y=y.

==Joint cumulative distribution function==
For a pair of random variables formula_28, the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) formula_29 is given by

where the right-hand side represents the probability that the random variable formula_30 takes on a value less than or equal to formula_31 and that formula_32 takes on a value less than or equal to formula_33.

For formula_34 random variables formula_35, the joint CDF formula_36 is given by

Interpreting the formula_34 random variables as a random vector formula_38 yields a shorter notation:

:formula_39

==Joint density function or mass function==

===Discrete case===
The joint probability mass function of two discrete random variables formula_40 is:

or written in terms of conditional distributions
:formula_41
where formula_42 is the probability of formula_43 given that formula_44.

The generalization of the preceding two-variable case is the joint probability distribution of formula_45 discrete random variables formula_46 which is:

or equivalently

:formula_47.

This identity is known as the chain rule of probability.

Since these are probabilities, in the two-variable case

:formula_48
which generalizes for formula_45 discrete random variables formula_50 to

:formula_51

===Continuous case===

The joint probability density function formula_25 for two continuous random variables is defined as the derivative of the joint cumulative distribution function (see ):

This is equal to:
:formula_53

where formula_54 and formula_55 are the conditional distributions of formula_32 given formula_57 and of formula_30 given formula_59 respectively, and formula_60 and formula_61 are the marginal distributions for formula_30 and formula_32 respectively.

The definition extends naturally to more than two random variables:

Again, since these are probability distributions, one has
:formula_64
respectively
:formula_65

===Mixed case===
The &quot;mixed joint density&quot; may be defined where one or more random variables are continuous and the other random variables are discrete. With one variable of each type
:formula_66
One example of a situation in which one may wish to find the cumulative distribution of one random variable which is continuous and another random variable which is discrete arises when one wishes to use a logistic regression in predicting the probability of a binary outcome Y conditional on the value of a continuously distributed outcome formula_30. One &quot;must&quot; use the &quot;mixed&quot; joint density when finding the cumulative distribution of this binary outcome because the input variables formula_68 were initially defined in such a way that one could not collectively assign it either a probability density function or a probability mass function. Formally, formula_25 is the probability density function of formula_68 with respect to the product measure on the respective supports of formula_30 and formula_32. Either of these two decompositions can then be used to recover the joint cumulative distribution function:
:formula_73
The definition generalizes to a mixture of arbitrary numbers of discrete and continuous random variables.

==Additional properties==
===Joint distribution for independent variables===
In general two random variables formula_30 and formula_32 are independent if and only if the joint cumulative distribution function satisfies
:formula_76

Two discrete random variables formula_30 and formula_32 are independent if and only if the joint probability mass function satisfies
:formula_79
for all formula_31 and formula_33.

While the number of independent random events grows, the related joint probability value decreases rapidly to zero, according to a negative exponential law.

Similarly, two absolutely continuous random variables are independent if and only if
:formula_82
for all formula_31 and formula_33. This means that acquiring any information about the value of one or more of the random variables leads to a conditional distribution of any other variable that is identical to its unconditional (marginal) distribution; thus no variable provides any information about any other variable.

===Joint distribution for conditionally dependent variables===
If a subset formula_1 of the variables formula_86 is conditionally dependent given another subset formula_2 of these variables, then the probability mass function of the joint distribution is formula_88. formula_88 is equal to formula_90. Therefore, it can be efficiently represented by the lower-dimensional probability distributions formula_91 and formula_92. Such conditional independence relations can be represented with a Bayesian network or copula functions.

=== Covariance ===
When two or more random variables are defined on a probability space, it is useful to describe how they vary together; that is, it is useful to measure the relationship between the variables. A common measure of the relationship between two random variables is the covariance. Covariance is a measure of linear relationship between the random variables. If the relationship between the random variables is nonlinear, the covariance might not be sensitive to the relationship, which means, it does not relate the correlation between two variables.

The covariance between the random variables formula_30 and formula_32 is
:formula_95

=== Correlation ===
There is another measure of the relationship between two random variables that is often easier to interpret than the covariance.

The correlation just scales the covariance by the product of the standard deviation of each variable. Consequently, the correlation is a dimensionless quantity that can be used to compare the linear relationships between pairs of variables in different units. If the points in the joint probability distribution of X and Y that receive positive probability tend to fall along a line of positive (or negative) slope, ρXY is near +1 (or −1). If ρXY equals +1 or −1, it can be shown that the points in the joint probability distribution that receive positive probability fall exactly along a straight line. Two random variables with nonzero correlation are said to be correlated. Similar to covariance, the correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between random variables.

The correlation coefficient between the random variables formula_30 and formula_32 is
:formula_98

==Important named distributions==

Named joint distributions that arise frequently in statistics include the multivariate normal distribution, the multivariate stable distribution, the multinomial distribution, the negative multinomial distribution, the multivariate hypergeometric distribution, and the elliptical distribution.

<doc id="879643" wikidata="Q5513812" url="?curid=879643" title="Chevrolet 2300 engine">
<text>The Chevrolet 2300 is a 2.3-liter straight-four engine produced by the Chevrolet division of General Motors for the 1971 to 1977 model years of the Chevrolet Vega and Chevrolet Monza. This engine was also offered in the 1973–74 Pontiac Astre (Canada only), the 1975–77 Pontiac Astre (United States and Canada), the Pontiac Sunbird for 1976 only, and the Oldsmobile Starfire for 1976–77.

==Overview==
The engine features a die-cast cylinder block made of an aluminum alloy with 17% silicon. During the machining process, the cylinders were etched leaving the pure silicon particles exposed providing the piston wear surface and eliminating the need for iron cylinder liners. The block has cast iron main caps and a cast iron crankshaft. The engine&#x27;s cylinder head is cast iron for lower cost, structural integrity and longer camshaft bearing life. The valvetrain features a direct-acting single overhead camshaft design. The engine block and cylinder heads were cast at Massena Castings Plant in Massena, New York.

The tall, long-stroke engine&#x27;s vibration tendencies are damped by large rubber engine mounts. One- and two-barrel carburetor versions were offered. The two-barrel L11 option also included a revised camshaft for a power increase of . Bore × stroke are , and compression is 8.0:1.

Overheating was a serious concern for the engine, since the engine block was of an open-deck design, severe overheating could cause the cylinder barrels to warp and pull away from the head gasket, causing coolant leaks into the cylinders and cylinder scuffing. Maintaining oil and coolant levels was crucial for the engine. The engine was equipped with an oil pressure switch which grounds out the primary-ignition system should the oil pressure fall below during operation, stopping the engine and preventing it from being restarted until the oil level was replenished or the mechanical cause of low-oil pressure was remedied. Chevrolet dealers installed a coolant-recovery tank, a low-coolant warning light and extended Vega&#x27;s engine warranty to .

The 1976 to 1977 the engine received a new cylinder-head design, incorporating hydraulic lifters to replace the taper-screw valve adjusters, improved coolant pathways, longer-life valve-stem seals, a redesigned water pump and thermostat, and a five-year, engine warranty. The engine&#x27;s name was changed to Dura-Built 140.

1975 to 1977 Pontiac Astres and 1975 to 1977 Chevrolet Monzas had the Vega engine as standard equipment. Of the Monza&#x27;s H-body variants, the Pontiac Sunbird adopted Vega&#x27;s revised Dura-built 140 engine for 1976 only, while the Oldsmobile Starfire offered it 1976-77.

The Cosworth Vega engine was produced in 1975 and 1976 using the 2300 engine block. The engine was de-stroked to giving , with a 16-valve aluminum cylinder head, double overhead cams (DOHC), forged components and solid lifters. It produced and .

==Aluminum engine block==
GM Research Labs had been working on a sleeveless aluminum block since the late &#x27;50s. The incentive was cost. Engineering out the four-cylinder&#x27;s block liners would save $8 per unit — a substantial amount of money at the time. Reynolds Metal Co. developed a hypereutectic aluminum alloy called A-390, composed of 77% aluminum, 17% silicon, 4% copper, 1% iron, and traces of phosphorus, zinc, manganese, and titanium. The A-390 alloy was suitable for faster production diecasting which made the Vega block less expensive to manufacture than other aluminum engines. Sealed Power Corp. developed special chrome-plated piston rings for the engine that were blunted to prevent scuffing. Basic work had been done under Eudell Jackobson of GM engineering, but final production engineering work was finished by Chevrolet.

The Vega engine block was cast in Massena, New York, at the same factory that had produced the Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine for the Corvair. Molten aluminum was transported from Reynolds and Alcoa reduction plants to the foundry, inside Thermos-like insulated tank trailers from the factory across the street. The block was cast using the ACCURAD process. The casting process provided a uniform distribution of fine primary silicon particles approximately in size. Pure silicon provides a hard scuff and wear resistant surface, having a rating of 7 on the mohs scale of hardness, the same as quartz, as compared to diamond which is 10. The blocks were aged 8 hours at to achieve dimensional stability. The technical breakthroughs of the block lay in the precision die-casting method used to produce it, and in the silicon alloying which provided a compatible bore surface without liners. Before being shipped to Tonawanda, the blocks were impregnated with sodium silicate, where they were machined through the outer skin.
From Massena, the cast engine blocks were shipped as raw castings to Chevy&#x27;s Tonawanda Engine plant in Tonawanda, New York. Here they underwent the messy etch and machining operations. The cylinder bores were rough and finish-honed conventionally to a finish then etched by a then-new electro-chemical process. The etching removed approximately of aluminum leaving the pure silicon particles prominent to form the bore surface.


With a finished weight of , the block weighs less than the cast-iron block in the Chevy II inline-4. Plating the piston skirts was necessary to put a hard iron skirt surface opposite the silicon of the block to prevent scuffing. The plating was a four layer electro-plating process. The first plate was a flash of zinc followed by a very thin flash of copper. The third and primary coating was hard iron, thick. The final layer was a flash of tin. The zinc and copper were necessary to adhere the iron while the tin prevented corrosion before assembly of the piston into the engine. Piston plating was done on a 46 operation automatic line. From Tonawanda, the engines went to the Chevrolet assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio.

Eudell Jackobson of GM engineering pointed out one of the early problems with unexplained scuffing and discovered excessive pressure on the bore hones was causing the silicon to crack. This need to both develop and actually manufacture the engine was a product of the program schedule. He said, &quot;...We were trying to put a product into production and learning the technology simultaneously. And the pressure becomes very, very great when that happens. The hone-pressure problem was solved before engines actually went out the door, affecting pre-production engines only.&quot;

<doc id="879646" wikidata="Q7161345" url="?curid=879646" title="Pelham Bay (neighborhood), Bronx">
<text>Pelham Bay is a middle class residential neighborhood in the borough of the Bronx, in New York City. It is named for Pelham Bay Park, New York City&#x27;s largest park, which lies on the neighborhood&#x27;s northeastern border; and for Pelham Bay, a body of water in that park. The neighborhood is bounded roughly by Pelham Parkway on the north, the New England Thruway (I-95) on the east, the Bruckner Expressway (I-95) on the south, and the Hutchinson River Parkway on the west.

Pelham Bay is part of Bronx Community District 10, and its ZIP Code is 10461. Pelham Bay is patrolled by the 45th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==History==
Most of the neighborhood is land that was purchased by Thomas Pell in 1654, part of an original grant to the Dutch West India Company.

Despite the name, the area that is now the Pelham Bay neighborhood was not part of the historical Town of Pelham, which consisted of the modern-day town of Pelham in Westchester County as well as Pelham Bay Park and City Island in the Bronx. The latter two areas were annexed by the City of New York in 1895.

==Land use==

Pelham Bay&#x27;s boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise, are Pelham Parkway to the north, New England Thruway to the east, Bruckner Expressway to the south, and Hutchinson River Parkway to the west. Pelham Bay includes the residential enclave of Country Club, which occupies the portion of the neighborhood east of Interstate 95 (I-95). The core of Pelham Bay is the portion west of I-95 and north of Middletown Road.

Pelham Bay is part of Bronx Community District 10, which also covers Throgs Neck and Co-op City. The neighborhood is home to a number of active civic and community associations, including the Pelham Bay Little League.

A variety of stores and eateries line the streets of this neighborhood, including Westchester Avenue, Buhre Avenue, Middletown Road, and Crosby Avenue (these two cross to form one of the main intersections of the neighborhood).
Arnow Place, a small street between Westchester Avenue and the New England Thruway (I-95) in Pelham Bay, was the site of the December 2005 shooting death of off-duty police officer, Daniel Enchautegui. Actor Lillo Brancato and an accomplice were charged with murder in the case. In 2006, the street was renamed Daniel Enchautegui Way.

There is a community playground called Westchester Square Playground located adjacent to the Hutchinson River Parkway. It has a baseball field, swing sets and a paddle ball court.

==Demographics==
The neighborhood is home to longstanding Italian American population with a recent influx of Hispanics changing the neighborhoods demographics considerably. Some homes have both Italian and American flags proudly waving. Many of these Italian families are first generation immigrants that immigrated to the Bronx in the past 20 – 50 years. As a result, many people in the area speak Italian. Many of the immigrants come from Sicily. The neighborhood also has sizeable population of Greeks. While the majority of the population is white, there is a significant Hispanic minority, consisting mostly of Puerto Ricans. As with Riverdale and Country Club, Pelham Bay ranks as one of the safest and most desirable neighborhoods in the Bronx. It was ranked as the best neighborhood for children in the Bronx and top 10 neighborhood in the whole New York City. There has been recent influx of Asians moving into the neighborhood, as Real estate value in Pelham Bay have grown much faster than other residential areas in the Bronx. Pelham Bay is known for not having section 8 housing and NYCHA buildings in close proximity; as zoning laws promoted by local residents have maintained its single to two-family nature as well as relative low crime. However, democratic lawmakers have attempted to impose low-income building constructions directly next to single-family houses, causing a friction and resistance from locals.

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Pelham Bay-Country Club-City Island was 26,583, a decrease of 557 (2.1%) from the 27,140 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the Pelham Bay-Country Club-City Island neighborhood was 62.0% (16,488) White, 2.9% (773) African American, 0.1% (36) Native American, 3.6% (969) Asian, 0.0% (5) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (110) from other races, and 0.9% (252) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 29.9% (7,950) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 10, which comprises City Island, Co-op City, Country Club, Pelham Bay, Schuylerville, Throgs Neck and Westchester Square, had 121,868 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 81.1 years. This is about the same as the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 20% are between the ages of between 0–17, 26% between 25–44, and 27% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 18% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 10 was $59,522. In 2018, an estimated 14% of Community District 10 residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in eleven residents (9%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 45% in Community District 10, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 10 is considered high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

==Police and crime==
Community District 10 is patrolled by the 45th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 2877 Barkley Avenue in Throggs Neck. The 45th Precinct ranked 28th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 53 per 100,000 people, Community District 10&#x27;s rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 243 per 100,000 people is lower than that of the city as a whole.

The 45th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 67% between 1990 and 2022. The precinct reported five murders, 13 rapes, 235 robberies, 265 felony assaults, 108 burglaries, 609 grand larcenies, and 323 grand larcenies auto in 2022.

<text>The Iron Duke engine (also called 151, 2500, Pontiac 2.5, and Tech IV) is a straight-4 piston engine built by the Pontiac Motor Division of General Motors from 1977 until 1993. Originally developed as Pontiac&#x27;s new economy car engine, it was used in a wide variety of vehicles across GM&#x27;s lineup in the 1980s as well as supplied to American Motors Corporation (AMC). The engine was engineered for fuel efficiency, smooth operation, and long life, not for performance. Total Duke engine production is estimated to be between 3.8 and 4.2 million units.

==Development==

At the time of the 1973 oil crisis the only engines Pontiac built were , , and versions of their V8 engine. Recognizing that future products would need to be smaller and more fuel-efficient, Pontiac engineers were tasked with developing a new engine that would be suitable for these future products. The engineers considered developing smaller displacement versions of the existing V8, a V6 derived from the V8, a V4 derived from the V8, and an inline-four derived from one of the cylinder banks of the V8 (in the same fashion as the 1961 Pontiac Tempest&#x27;s &quot;Trophy 4&quot; engine), but ultimately decided to create an entirely new four-cylinder engine.

The development team&#x27;s design goals were to minimize noise and vibration while maximizing durability, , fuel economy, and &quot;usable&quot; power at lower engine speeds. They began by analyzing other four-cylinder engines in production at General Motors at the time, and they found that GM do Brasil&#x27;s version of the Chevrolet 153 cu in four-cylinder—with a shorter stroke and longer connecting rods—had significantly reduced secondary vibration as compared to the original Chevrolet design and the newer 2.3-liter four-cylinder from the Chevrolet Vega. This obviated the need for counter-rotating balance shafts, which would have increased the weight, complexity, and cost of the engine. Despite sharing the same bore, stroke, and cylinder spacing as the Brazilian engine, the majority of parts are not interchangeable.

Focusing on making power at lower engine speeds was a deliberate consideration in order to meet the rest of the design goals. Careful consideration was made to the design of the intake manifold and exhaust gas recirculation system to ensure power output from each cylinder was equalized. Power consumption of the water and oil pumps were reduced, and the piston rings, cylinder bores, and crankshaft journals were designed to minimize friction.

To maximize durability the engine block was made of cast iron with five main bearings, rather than the relatively fragile cast aluminum block used by the 2.3-liter Vega engine. (Even with the cast iron block the Iron Duke only weighed about 20 pounds more.) The 2.3-liter engine&#x27;s belt-driven overhead camshaft was eschewed in favor of an overhead valve design with timing gears. Specially-designed bolts that stretch slightly farther than a conventional bolt were used to secure the intake and exhaust manifolds to the cylinder head, to allow slight movement while maintaining the seal of the gaskets in order to prevent cracking the manifolds as they expand with heat.

A two-stage, two-barrel carburetor with electric choke was used to improve performance in cold starts, while heat shields incorporated underneath the carburetor and between the intake and exhaust manifolds were used to prevent heat soaking the gasoline in the carburetor thereby improving performance in hot weather. Recognizing that cars with four-cylinder engines equipped with air conditioning tended to experience drivability issues in hot weather, other improvements were made including a cut-off switch that shut the compressor off at wide open throttle and a delay incorporated into the air conditioning&#x27;s circuitry to prevent the compressor from engaging until twelve seconds after the engine was started.

==Early applications==

The Iron Duke&#x27;s first applications were in the 1977 Astre and Sunbird subcompact cars, replacing the 2.3-liter Vega engine, and in the compact Phoenix. As these cars were originally designed for Chevrolet engines, the Iron Duke also used the Chevrolet bell housing bolt pattern, instead of the Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac V8 pattern. The following year use of the engine expanded to the Sunbird&#x27;s Chevrolet and Oldsmobile twins, the Monza and Starfire.

For the 1979 model year, the engine was extensively redesigned. The original reverse-flow cylinder head was replaced by a crossflow design, a new two-barrel carburetor called &quot;Vara-Jet&quot; was introduced, the distributor was relocated, and the size of the oil pan was reduced. The only parts carried over from the 1978 engines were the connecting rods. Peak power increased to 90 hp.

For 1980 the Iron Duke engine was redesigned to be mounted transversely, to suit the new front-drive General Motors &quot;X-body&quot; cars. The bellhousing bolt pattern was revised to match that of the new 60° V6 engine.
GM also began selling the engine to American Motors Corporation (AMC) starting with the 1980 model year. It was the base engine in Spirit, Concord, and Eagle automobiles, as well as in base-model Jeep CJs. The engines purchased by AMC continued to use the Chevrolet V8 bellhousing pattern. The four-cylinder engine was discontinued from AMC&#x27;s rear-wheel drive models after 1982. During 1983, the all-wheel drive Eagle base engine switched from the Iron Duke to a new, AMC-developed four-cylinder. The 1980 through 1983 Jeep CJs were also available with the Iron Duke as the base engine.

==Tech IV==
Iron Dukes were fitted with fuel injection (TBI, via a single injector in the throttle body) in 1982. This version was christened the Tech IV, though &quot;Car and Driver&quot; later ridiculed it as the &quot;low&quot;-Tech IV. Power output increased to .

This was replaced by a swirl-port head with 9.0:1 (instead of 8.25:1) compression ratio in 1984 for a gain. Other additions for 1985 included roller lifters, improved bearings, and a new crankshaft. Several significant changes were made in 1987, which included: an improved cylinder head, intake manifold, and throttle-body fuel injection module; a more-modern serpentine belt with an automatic spring-loaded tensioner for the accessories; and a Distributorless Ignition System (DIS). This revision to the engine increased power to . In 1988, a balance shaft was added to smooth engine vibrations. Up to this point, the engine incorporated a &#x27;dogbone&#x27; upper front engine mount secured to the cowling of the vehicle&#x27;s hood latch, aiding in controlling the vibration. Further improvements in later years included new pistons, rods, crankshaft, and an in-pan oiling system. The most powerful variant of the Tech IV raised the rev limit to 5500 rpm, and achieved . The Tech IV uses the same bellhousing pattern as the 2.8-liter &quot;60-Degree&quot; V6. Over the years, the Tech IV engine has proved to be a reliable workhorse for owners when not pushed to its limits. All 1978-1990 Iron Duke engines used a micarta camshaft gear that meshed directly with a steel gear on the crankshaft. 1991-92 VIN R and U engines used a timing chain instead.

The Grumman LLV (Long Life Vehicle) built from 1987 until 1994 for the United States Postal Service for use in mail delivery were initially powered by the Iron Duke engine. The Postal Service specifications called for a 24-year service life and those with 2.5-liter engine have surpassed expectations.

==Super Duty==
The Iron Duke block formed the basis of Pontiac&#x27;s &quot;Super Duty&quot; four-cylinder racing engines of the 1980s, the last in a line of high-performance Pontiac Super Duty engines. The engines were featured in NASCAR&#x27;s Charlotte/Daytona Dash Series, the IMSA GT Championship (in GTP and GTU class cars), and even in American Power Boat Association racing boats. Super Duty engines continued to be used in ARCA racing until well into the 2000s.

In addition to parts matching the Iron Duke&#x27;s stock 2.5-liter displacement other crankshafts and their corresponding connecting rods were offered by Pontiac Motorsports, resulting in displacements ranging from 2.1-liters to 3.2-liters. A 2.7-liter, Super Duty engine powered the 1984 Fiero Indy Pace Car to over during the race, but Super Duty engines were never available in factory-built GM vehicles. However, GM sold the Super-Duty-specific parts at authorized dealers and all of the parts required to convert a stock Iron Duke engine to a Super Duty version were available.

Kansas Racing Products continued to make the engines in the early 21st century after buying rights to make them from GM.

Cosworth also produced a 16-valve, double-overhead cam head for the 3.0-liter version of the racing engine (Cosworth Project DBA, 1987).

<text>The General Motors 60° V6 engine family is a series of 60° V6 engines produced for both longitudinal and transverse applications. All of these engines are 12-valve cam-in-block or overhead valve engines, except for the LQ1 which uses 24 valves driven by dual overhead cams. These engines vary in displacement between and have a cast-iron block and either cast-iron or aluminum heads. Production of these engines began in 1980 and ended in 2005 in the U.S., with production continued in China until 2010. This engine family was the basis for the GM High Value engine family. These engines have also been referred to as the X engines as they were first used in the X-body cars.

This engine is not related to the GMC V6 engine that was designed for commercial vehicle usage.

This engine family was developed by Chevrolet, although it was used by many GM divisions, except for Saturn and Geo.

==Generation I==
The first generation of modern small GM 60° V6 engines featured an iron block and heads with inline valves. This &quot;clean sheet&quot; design was introduced in 1980 and versions were produced through 1995. Two different blocks with minor differences were developed:
* A transverse engine family for front-wheel drive
* A longitudinal engine family for rear-wheel drive

===Transverse===
The transverse engines began the 60° family in 1980. Like the rest of the Generation I engines, they were updated in 1985 with larger main journals for durability, along with multi-point fuel injection or E2SE carburetor and OBD I. Production of the Generation I transverse engines ended in 1988.

===3.4 L===

====LQ1====
The LQ1 (also called the Twin Dual Cam or TDC) was a DOHC V6 engine (&quot;X-code&quot;) based on the aluminum-headed second generation of GM&#x27;s 60° engine line, sharing a similar block with its pushrod cousins, the 3.1 L LH0 V6 and the then recently retired LB6 V6. The engine was built only for front-wheel-drive applications, and was featured exclusively in the first generation of GM&#x27;s W-body platform.

It was built from 1991 to 1997. From 1991 to 1993, it used tuned multiport fuel injection, and made at 5200 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm. From 1994 to 1997, it used sequential port fuel injection, and made at 5200 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm. In 1996, the heads were redesigned for better flow, as well as now making the engine an interference design and adapting the engine for federally mandated OBD-II emissions. Output for the 1996–97 LQ1 is and . It had four valves per cylinder. The engine substituted the standard camshaft for a chain-driven intermediate shaft, which drives four overhead cams via a cogged belt. Adapting the 60° pushrod block for the LQ1&#x27;s overhead cams significantly increased packaged engine height.

Bore was increased to , and the engine&#x27;s stroke was retained. Only a few interchangeable parts are use between this DOHC engine and other members of the 60° family, primarily the connecting rods and crankshaft.

The heads and intake manifolds were redesigned for the 1996 model year, incorporating a larger throttle body and plenum area, slightly longer intake runners, cloverleaf combustion chambers, and larger &quot;pill&quot;-shaped exhaust ports. Camshafts and cam timing were also revised for the new, higher-rpm powerband.

Optional from 1991 to 1993 was a Getrag 284 five-speed manual transaxle, which was also exclusive to the GM W platform and was available only with the LQ1. The electronically-controlled Hydramatic 4T60-E four-speed automatic transaxle was the alternative, used during the entire production run with the exception of the 1997 Monte Carlo Z34 and 1997 Lumina LTZ, which received the 4T65-E.

Applications:
* 1991–1997 Chevrolet Lumina
* 1995–1997 Chevrolet Monte Carlo
* 1991–1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme
* 1991–1996 Pontiac Grand Prix

<text>William Alden Smith (May 12, 1859 – October 11, 1932) was a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from the state of Michigan. After the 1912 sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, Smith chaired the Senate hearings into the disaster. His report led to major reforms in maritime safety.

==Early life and early career==
Smith was born in Dowagiac, Michigan to George Richardson and Leah Margaret (Allen) Smith and attended the common schools. He moved with his parents to Grand Rapids in 1872, where he attended school, sold popcorn, and was a newsboy and messenger boy. He was appointed a page in the Michigan House of Representatives in 1875 (or 1879) at Lansing, Michigan. He studied law in the office of Burch &amp; Montgomery (Marsden C. Burch was a one-time U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan) and was admitted to the bar in 1882. Smith practiced law alone for some time, but later became associated with Fredrick W. Stevens. This firm afterwards became Smiley, Smith &amp; Stevens. He was general counsel of the Chicago and West Michigan Railway and the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad. While in this practice, Smith became an expert on railroad law and finance. He was assistant secretary of the Michigan Senate in 1883 and the State Game Warden from 1887 to 1891, reportedly the first salaried state game warden in the nation. He was a member of the Republican State Central Committee from 1888 to 1892.

==House of Representatives==
Smith was elected as a Republican from the Michigan&#x27;s 5th congressional district to the 54th United States Congress and to the six succeeding Congresses, serving from March 4, 1895, until his resignation, effective February 9, 1907, having been elected to the U.S. Senate. While in the House of Representatives, Smith was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the State Department in the 56th Congress, the Committee on Pacific Railroads in the 57th and 58th Congresses. While Chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads, Smith was a leading advocate for universal safety standards on railroads, attracting the ire of many of the country&#x27;s railroad executives.

==Senate==
Smith was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate on January 15, 1907, for the term beginning March 4, 1907. He was subsequently elected on February 6, 1907, to fill the vacancy in the term ending March 3, 1907, caused by the death of Russell A. Alger. He was reelected in 1913 and served from February 9, 1907, to March 3, 1919. He declined to run for renomination in 1918. Smith was chairman of the Committee on Canadian Relations in the 61st Congress, the Committee on Territories in the 62nd Congress, and the Select Committee to Examine Branches of the Civil Service in the 63rd through 65th Congresses.

== RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; investigation ==
After the luxury liner RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; sank in the North Atlantic on April 15, 1912, with more than 1,500 lives lost, Smith chaired Senate hearings that began at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City the day after the survivors landed. Senators and spectators heard dramatic testimony from the surviving passengers and crew. Smith&#x27;s subcommittee issued a report on May 28 that led to significant reforms in international maritime safety. Smith achieved some notoriety for being more colorful than knowledgeable, even being called &quot;Watertight Smith&quot; by the British press for asking whether watertight compartments, actually meant to keep the ship afloat, were meant to shelter passengers. In addition to this, Smith also asked the ship&#x27;s fifth officer Harold Lowe what an iceberg was made of, which Lowe responded with, &quot;Ice, I suppose sir?&quot;.

In &quot;The Titanic Chronicles&quot;, a 1999 television documentary about the senate hearings, he was voiced by David Garrison. In &quot;Unsinkable&quot; the 2024 movie Sen. William Alden Smith was portrayed by Cotter Smith.

==Other activities==
Smith constructed the Grand Rapids, Kalkaska and Southeastern Railroad in Michigan in 1897 and became owner of the Lowell and Hastings Railroad in 1900. In June 1901, he was honored with the degree of Master of Arts by Dartmouth College. He was owner and publisher of the &quot;Grand Rapids Herald&quot; in 1906 and chairman of the board of directors of the Goodrich Company, which owned the Graham and Morton Steamship Line, the largest operator of steamboats from Chicago to various Lake Michigan ports.

In 1909 he defended Federal employee and civil rights activist Robert Pelham Jr. who was arrested when gathering information from witnesses after a black woman was beaten by a white police officer who was arresting her. Pelham was acquitted in the case.

Smith was married on October 21, 1886, to Nancy Alice (&quot;Nana&quot;) Osterhout (October 21, 1859 – February 15, 1936) of Grand Rapids. They had one son, William Alden Smith, Jr. who died on April 19, 1920, at the age of 27. The second Disabled American Veterans chapter ever organized was in Kentwood, Michigan, and is named for him. The younger Smith was married to Marie McRae, daughter of Milton A. McRae of Detroit. This couple had a son, William Alden, III, who died on December 16, 1968, in San Diego, California at the age of 52. They are all buried in the family mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery, Grand Rapids, Michigan.

== Death and legacy ==
Smith died in Grand Rapids on October 11, 1932 and is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery there.

The community of Alden, Michigan is named for him. A bronze statue of Smith was placed in Grand Rapids in 2017, as part of the city&#x27;s Community Legends Project, which seeks to build statues honoring prominent Grand Rapids figures.

<text>François Poulin de Francheville, Seigneur de Saint-Maurice (7 October 1692 – November 1733) was a Montreal merchant who was granted permission by the King of France to mine the iron ore deposits on his seigneury in 1730. In 1730, Francheville founded the &quot;Compagnie des Forges de Saint-Maurice&quot;, but he died three years later.

The ironworks — Forges du St-Maurice — built near the town of Trois-Rivières (in present-day Quebec), were the only iron industry enterprise in New France. In 1736, the ironworks were taken over by a company that went bankrupt in 1741. The ironworks then became the property of the Crown, and began producing artillery pieces and objects of everyday use, such as pots and stoves.

Francheville had bequeathed ownership of his slave, Marie-Joseph Angélique, to his wife; the following year, Angélique was convicted for starting the 1734 fire of Montreal.

<doc id="879672" wikidata="Q2917066" url="?curid=879672" title="EADS Mako/HEAT">
<text>The EADS Mako/High Energy Advanced Trainer (Mako/HEAT) was a high-performance jet trainer or light attack aircraft intended for service with several European air forces. EADS proposed the Mako for the Eurotrainer program. The program was the final result of the AT-2000 project.

==Design and development==
The Mako design featured a single aft-mounted jet engine, fed by two air intake ramps at the roots of the mid-fuselage-wing. It features a trapezoidal wing with a sharp taper. The horizontal tail was an all-flying unit mounted close behind the wing and at nearly the same height. The retractable landing gear was a tricycle unit. The two occupants shared a highly streamlined bubble canopy.

Subcontractors would have included Diehl Aerospace, Aermacchi (now Leonardo), Saab, EAB and Dassault Aviation.

The Mako shows remarkable stealth aircraft features, partially due to faceting and partially due to composite materials, using some results from the MBB Lampyridae stealth program.

The intended engine was the General Electric F414M, which is a slightly derated version (at 75 kN) of the standard F414.

The Mako/HEAT was to be deployed at three shared bases around the continent of Europe, for use by all partner nations. There were nine candidate bases in seven countries, but no final selection was made. The Aermacchi M-346 trainer, also being proposed for Eurotrainer, made its maiden flight on 15 July 2004; , EADS had yet to announce a date for the Mako&#x27;s maiden flight, and the project appeared to be defunct.

The Mako/HEAT bid for the 1998 South African Air Force strategic procurement project, but lost to the BAE Hawk and Saab Gripen.

<doc id="879681" wikidata="Q464356" url="?curid=879681" title="Trigonometric interpolation">
<text>In mathematics, trigonometric interpolation is interpolation with trigonometric polynomials. Interpolation is the process of finding a function which goes through some given data points. For trigonometric interpolation, this function has to be a trigonometric polynomial, that is, a sum of sines and cosines of given periods. This form is especially suited for interpolation of periodic functions.

An important special case is when the given data points are equally spaced, in which case the solution is given by the discrete Fourier transform.

==Formulation of the interpolation problem==
A trigonometric polynomial of degree &quot;K&quot; has the form

This expression contains 2&quot;K&quot; + 1 coefficients, &quot;a&quot;0, &quot;a&quot;1, … &quot;a&quot;&quot;K&quot;, &quot;b&quot;1, …, &quot;b&quot;&quot;K&quot;, and we wish to compute those coefficients so that the function passes through &quot;N&quot; points:
:formula_1
Since the trigonometric polynomial is periodic with period 2π, the &quot;N&quot; points can be distributed and ordered in one period as 
:formula_2
(Note that we do &quot;not&quot; in general require these points to be equally spaced.) The interpolation problem is now to find coefficients such that the trigonometric polynomial &quot;p&quot; satisfies the interpolation conditions.

==Formulation in the complex plane==
The problem becomes more natural if we formulate it in the complex plane. We can rewrite the formula for a trigonometric polynomial as
formula_3
where &quot;i&quot; is the imaginary unit. If we set &quot;z&quot; = &quot;e&quot;&quot;ix&quot;, then this becomes
:formula_4
with
:formula_5
This reduces the problem of trigonometric interpolation to that of polynomial interpolation on the unit circle. Existence and uniqueness for trigonometric interpolation now follows immediately from the corresponding results for polynomial interpolation.

For more information on formulation of trigonometric interpolating polynomials in the complex plane, see p. 156 of Interpolation using Fourier Polynomials.

==Solution of the problem==
Under the above conditions, there exists a solution to the problem for &quot;any&quot; given set of data points {&quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&quot;k&quot;} as long as &quot;N&quot;, the number of data points, is not larger than the number of coefficients in the polynomial, i.e., &quot;N&quot; ≤ 2&quot;K&quot;+1 (a solution may or may not exist if &quot;N&quot;&gt;2&quot;K&quot;+1 depending upon the particular set of data points). Moreover, the interpolating polynomial is unique if and only if the number of adjustable coefficients is equal to the number of data points, i.e., &quot;N&quot; = 2&quot;K&quot; + 1. In the remainder of this article, we will assume this condition to hold true.

===Odd number of points===
If the number of points &quot;N&quot; is odd, say &quot;N=2K+1&quot;, applying the Lagrange formula for polynomial interpolation to the polynomial formulation in the complex plane yields that the solution can be written in the form

where
:formula_6
The factor formula_7 in this formula compensates for the fact that the complex plane formulation contains also negative powers of formula_8 and is therefore not a polynomial expression in formula_8. The correctness of this expression can easily be verified by observing that formula_10 and that formula_11 is a linear combination of the right powers of formula_8.
Upon using the identity

the coefficient formula_11 can be written in the form
^{2K} \frac{\sin\tfrac12(x-x_m)}{\sin\tfrac12(x_k-x_m)}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

===Even number of points===
If the number of points &quot;N&quot; is even, say &quot;N=2K&quot;, applying the Lagrange formula for polynomial interpolation to the polynomial formulation in the complex plane yields that the solution can be written in the form

where
{e^{ix_k}-e^{i\alpha_k}} \prod_{\begin{align}m&amp;=0 \\[-4mu] m &amp;\ne k\end{align}}^{2K-1} \frac{e^{ix}-e^{ix_m}}{e^{ix_k}-e^{ix_m}}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}
Here, the constants formula_14 can be chosen freely. This is caused by the fact that the interpolating function () contains an odd number of unknown constants. A common choice is to require that the highest frequency is of the form a constant times formula_15, i.e. the formula_16 term vanishes, but in general the phase of the highest frequency can be chosen to be formula_17. To get an expression for formula_14, we obtain by using () that () can be written on the form
:formula_19
This yields
:formula_20
and
:formula_21

Note that care must be taken in order to avoid infinities caused by zeros in the denominators.

==Equidistant nodes==
Further simplification of the problem is possible if nodes formula_22 are equidistant, i.e.
:formula_23
see Zygmund for more details.

===Odd number of points===
Further simplification by using () would be an obvious approach, but is obviously involved. A much simpler approach is to consider the Dirichlet kernel
:formula_24
where formula_25 is odd. It can easily be seen that formula_26 is a linear combination of the right powers of formula_8 and satisfies
:formula_28
Since these two properties uniquely define the coefficients formula_11 in (), it follows that
:formula_30
Here, the sinc-function prevents any singularities and is defined by
:formula_31

===Even number of points===
For formula_32 even, we define the Dirichlet kernel as
:formula_33
Again, it can easily be seen that formula_26 is a linear combination of the right powers of formula_8, does not contain the term formula_36 and satisfies
:formula_28
Using these properties, it follows that the coefficients formula_11 in () are given by
:formula_39
Note that formula_11 does not contain the formula_36 as well. Finally, note that the function formula_36 vanishes at all the points formula_22. Multiples of this term can, therefore, always be added, but it is commonly left out.

===Implementation===
A MATLAB implementation of the above can be found here and is given by:

function P = triginterp(xi,x,y)
% TRIGINTERP Trigonometric interpolation.
% Input:
% xi evaluation points for the interpolant (vector)
% x equispaced interpolation nodes (vector, length N)
% y interpolation values (vector, length N)
% Output:
% P values of the trigonometric interpolant (vector)
N = length(x);
% Adjust the spacing of the given independent variable.
h = 2/N;
scale = (x(2)-x(1)) / h;
x = x/scale; xi = xi/scale;
% Evaluate interpolant.
P = zeros(size(xi));
for k = 1:N
 P = P + y(k)*trigcardinal(xi-x(k),N);
end

function tau = trigcardinal(x,N)
ws = warning(&#x27;off&#x27;,&#x27;MATLAB:divideByZero&#x27;);
% Form is different for even and odd N.
if rem(N,2)==1 % odd
 tau = sin(N*pi*x/2) ./ (N*sin(pi*x/2));
else % even
 tau = sin(N*pi*x/2) ./ (N*tan(pi*x/2));
end
warning(ws)
tau(x==0) = 1; % fix value at x=0
===Relation with the discrete Fourier transform===
The special case in which the points &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; are equally spaced is especially important. In this case, we have
:formula_44

The transformation that maps the data points &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot; to the coefficients &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; is obtained from the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of order N.

:formula_45

:formula_46

(Because of the way the problem was formulated above, we have restricted ourselves to odd numbers of points. This is not strictly necessary; for even numbers of points, one includes another cosine term corresponding to the Nyquist frequency.)

The case of the cosine-only interpolation for equally spaced points, corresponding to a trigonometric interpolation when the points have even symmetry, was treated by Alexis Clairaut in 1754. In this case the solution is equivalent to a discrete cosine transform. The sine-only expansion for equally spaced points, corresponding to odd symmetry, was solved by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1762, for which the solution is a discrete sine transform. The full cosine and sine interpolating polynomial, which gives rise to the DFT, was solved by Carl Friedrich Gauss in unpublished work around 1805, at which point he also derived a fast Fourier transform algorithm to evaluate it rapidly. Clairaut, Lagrange, and Gauss were all concerned with studying the problem of inferring the orbit of planets, asteroids, etc., from a finite set of observation points; since the orbits are periodic, a trigonometric interpolation was a natural choice. See also Heideman &quot;et al.&quot; (1984).

==Applications in numerical computing==
Chebfun, a fully integrated software system written in MATLAB for computing with functions, uses trigonometric interpolation and Fourier expansions for computing with periodic functions. Many algorithms related to trigonometric interpolation are readily available in Chebfun; several examples are available here.

<text>The beetle family Phengodidae is known also as glowworm beetles, whose larvae are known as [[glowworm]]s. The females and larvae have bioluminescent organs. They occur throughout the New World from extreme southern Canada to Chile, numbering over 250 species in total. The recently recognized members of the Phengodidae, the Cydistinae, are found in Western Asia. The family Rhagophthalmidae, an Old World group, used to be included in the Phengodidae.

Larval and larviform female glowworms are predators, feeding on millipedes and other arthropods occurring in soil and litter. The winged males, which are often attracted to lights at night, are short-lived and probably do not feed. Females are much larger than the males and are completely larviform. Males may be luminescent, but females and larvae have a series of luminescent organs on trunk segments which emit yellow or green light, and sometimes an additional head organ which emits red light, as in railroad worms.

This family is distinct from the fireflies (family Lampyridae), which may also be called &quot;glow-worms&quot; in its larval stage. Some early studies suggested that Phengodidae might possibly include (or be sister taxon to) the long-lipped beetles, which were formerly treated as a family Telegeusidae, but these are now treated as a subfamily within the family Omethidae.

<text>The Special Warfare insignia, also known as the &quot;SEAL Trident&quot; or its popular nickname in the Navy community, &quot;The Budweiser&quot;, recognizes those members of the United States Navy who have completed the Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training, completed SEAL Qualification Training (SQT) and have been designated as U.S. Navy SEALs.

==History==
Established on 16 October 1970, the Special Warfare insignia was initially issued in two grades: gold for officers and silver for enlisted. In 1978, the silver SEAL insignia was abolished, with the Special Warfare insignia being issued solely in gold thereafter. The SEAL insignia is therefore unusual in the Navy, in that it is one of the very few breast insignia issued identically for both officers and enlisted personnel. This is partly due to the combined training both officers and enlisted men receive, side by side, when involved in BUD/S training.

The Special Warfare insignia consists of an eagle clutching a U.S. Navy anchor, trident, and flintlock-style pistol. This gold badge is considered a successor to the obsolete Underwater Demolition Insignia.

===Designator and title===
Sailors who complete BUD/S training at Coronado, California are reclassified to the Special Warfare Operator (SO) rating. Sailors must complete SEAL Qualification Training (SQT) before receiving Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 5326 Combatant Swimmer (SEAL) or, in the case of commissioned naval officers, the designation 1130 Naval Special Warfare (SEAL) Officer. Prior to the establishment of the SO rating in 2006, SEAL operators were sourced from regular Naval ratings, with the title of SEAL treated like a warfare qualification, attaching (SEAL) after the rating.
