<text>The Irish Rebellion of 1798 (; Ulster-Scots: &quot;The Turn out&quot;, &quot;The Hurries&quot;, 1798 Rebellion) was a popular insurrection against the British Crown in what was then the separate, but subordinate, Kingdom of Ireland. The main organising force was the Society of United Irishmen. First formed in Belfast by Presbyterians opposed to the landed Anglican establishment, the Society, despairing of reform, sought to secure a republic through a revolutionary union with the country&#x27;s Catholic majority. The grievances of a rack-rented tenantry drove recruitment.

While assistance was being sought from the French Republic and from democratic militants in Britain, martial-law seizures and arrests forced the conspirators into the open. Beginning in late May 1798, there were a series of uncoordinated risings: in the counties of Carlow and Wexford in the southeast where the rebels met with some success; in the north around Belfast in counties Antrim and Down; and closer to the capital, Dublin, in counties Meath and Kildare.

In late August, after the rebels had been reduced to pockets of guerrilla resistance, the French landed an expeditionary force in the west, in County Mayo. Unable to effect a conjunction with a significant rebel force, they surrendered on 9 September. In the last open-field engagement of the rebellion, the local men they had rallied on their arrival were routed at Killala on 23 September. On 12 October, a second French expedition was defeated in a naval action off the coast of County Donegal leading to the capture of the United Irish leader Wolfe Tone.

In the wake of the rebellion, Acts of Union abolished the Irish legislature and brought Ireland under the crown of a United Kingdom through the Parliament at Westminster. The centenary of the rebellion in 1898 saw its legacy disputed by nationalists who wished to restore a legislature in Dublin, by republicans who invoked the name of Tone in the cause of complete separation and independence, and by unionists opposed to all measures of Irish self-government. Renewed in a bicentenary year that coincided with the 1998 Belfast &quot;Good Friday&quot; Agreement, the debate over the interpretation and significance of &quot;1798&quot; continues.

== Background ==

=== The Volunteer movement ===
In the last decades of the 18th century, the British Crown in Ireland faced growing demands for constitutional reform. The Protestant Ascendancy had relaxed the Penal Laws by which, in the wake of the Jacobite defeat in 1691, it had sought to break the power, and reduce the influence, both of the Catholic church and of the remaining Catholic gentry. But the landed Anglican interest continued to monopolise the Irish Parliament, occupying both the House of Lords and, through the system of pocket boroughs, half of the Commons. The interests of the Crown were meanwhile secured by a Viceregal administration accountable, not to the legislature in Dublin, but to the King and his ministers in London (and which also having boroughs in its pocket reduced to a third the number of Commons seats open to electoral contest). Additionally, the British parliament presumed the right to itself to legislate for Ireland, a prerogative it had exercised to restrict rival Irish trade and commerce.

The revolt of the North American colonies presented a challenge. War with the colonists and with their French allies drew down the Crown&#x27;s regular forces in Ireland. In their absence Volunteer companies were formed, ostensibly for home defence, but soon, like their kinsmen in the colonies, debating and asserting &quot;constitutional rights&quot;. In 1782, with the Volunteers drilling and parading in support of the otherwise beleaguered Patriot opposition in the Irish Parliament, Westminster repealed its Dependency of Ireland on Great Britain Act 1719.

Volunteers, especially in the north where Presbyterians and other Protestant Dissenters had flocked to their ranks, immediately sought to build upon this grant of legislative independence by agitating for the abolition of the pocket boroughs and an extension of the franchise. But the question of whether, and on what terms, parliamentary reform should embrace Catholic emancipation split the movement&quot;. The &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; survived: the Anglican aristocracy remained entrenched under the patronage of a government that continued to take its direction from London.

=== Formation of the United Irishmen ===

The disappointment was felt keenly in Belfast, a growing commercial centre which, as a borough owned of the Marquess of Donegall, had no elected representation. In October 1791, amidst public celebration of the French Revolution, a group of Volunteer veterans invited an address from Wolfe Tone, a Protestant secretary to Dublin&#x27;s Catholic Committee. Acknowledging his &quot;Argument on behalf of the Catholics of Ireland,&quot; in which Tone had argued that they could not enjoy liberty until banded together with Catholics against the &quot;boobies and blockheads&quot; of the Ascendancy, and styling themselves at his suggestion the Society of United Irishmen, the meeting resolved:[that] the weight of English influence in the government of this country is so great as to require a cordial union among all the people of Ireland; [and] that the sole constitutional mode by which this influence can be opposed, is by complete and radical reform of the representation of the people in parliament.The same resolution was carried by Tone&#x27;s friends in Dublin where, reflecting a larger, more diverse, middle class, the Society united from the outset Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter.

=== The Catholic Convention ===
With the support and participation of United Irishmen, in December 1792 the Catholic Committee convened a national Catholic Convention. Elected on a broad, head-of-household, franchise, the &quot;Back Lane Parliament&quot; was a direct challenge to the legitimacy of the Irish Lords and Commons.

Anticipating war with the new French Republic, George III received a delegation from the convention (including Tone) at Windsor, and the British government pressed the Irish Parliament to match Westminster&#x27;s Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791. This relieved Catholics of most of their remaining civil disabilities and, where (in the counties) Common&#x27;s seats were contested, allowed those meeting the property qualification to vote. For Parliament itself the Oath of Supremacy was retained so that it remained exclusively Protestant.

For a measure that could have little appreciable impact on the conduct of government, the price for overriding Ascendancy opposition was the dissolution of the Catholic Committee, a new government militia that conscripted Catholic and Protestant by lot, and a Convention Act that effectively outlawed extra-parliamentary opposition. When it was clear that these were not terms acceptable to the United Irishmen (who had been seeking to revive and remodel the Volunteers along the lines of the revolutionary French &quot;National Guard&quot;) the government moved to suppress the Society. In May 1794, following the revelation of meetings between a French emissary, William Jackson, and United leaders including Tone and Archibald Hamilton Rowan, the Society was proscribed.

== Mobilisation ==
=== New System of Organisation ===
A year later, in May 1795, a meeting of United delegates from Belfast and the surrounding market towns responded to the growing repression by endorsing a new, and it was hoped more resistant, &quot;system of organisation&quot;. Local societies were to split so as to remain within a range of 7 to 35 members, and through baronial and county delegate committees, to build toward a provincial, and, once three of Ireland&#x27;s four provinces had organised, a national, directory.

It was with this New System that the Society spread rapidly across Ulster and, eventually, from Dublin (where the abandonment of open proceedings had been resisted) out into the midlands and the south. As it did so, William Drennan&#x27;s &quot;test&quot; or pledge, calling for &quot;a union of power among Irishmen of every religious persuasion&quot;, was administered to artisans, journeymen and shopkeepers, many of whom had maintained their own Jacobin clubs, and to tenant farmers and their market-town allies who had organised against the Protestant gentry in secret fraternities.

=== United Irish–Defender alliance ===
In rural Ireland, there was a &quot;varied, energetic and complex structure of agrarian &#x27;secret societies&#x27;&quot;, commonly referred to as Whiteboyism, after groups that had emerged mid-century in the south. In the north, it had included the Oakboys who, mobilising the aggrieved irrespective of religion, had in 1763 threatened to pursue fleeing Anglican rectors and tithe proctors into the city of Derry. There had also been the Hearts of Steel who, protesting land speculation and evictions, in 1770 entered Belfast, besieged the barracks, and sprung one of their number from prison. By the 1790s, borrowing, like the United Irish societies (and, from 1795, their nemesis the Orange Institution), from the lodge structure and ceremonial of freemasonry, this semi-insurrectionary phenomenon had regenerated as the largely but—with some latter-day adjustments to their oaths—not exclusively Catholic, Defenders.

Originating as &quot;fleets&quot; of young men who contended with Protestant Peep o&#x27; Day Boys for the control of tenancies and employment in the linen-producing region of north Armagh, the Defenders organised across the southern counties of Ulster and into the Irish midlands. Already in 1788, their oath-taking had been condemned in a pastoral by the Catholic Primate Archbishop of Armagh. As the United Irishmen began to reach out the Defenders, they were similarly sanctioned. With cautions against the &quot;fascinating illusions&quot; of French principles, in 1794 Catholics taking the United test were threatened with excommunication.

Encountering a political outlook more Jacobite than Jacobin, and speaking freely to the grievances of tithes, taxes and rents, United agents sought to convince Defenders of something they had only &quot;vaguely&quot; considered, namely the need to separate Ireland from England and to secure its &quot;real as well as nominal independence&quot;. As the promise of reform receded, and as French victories built hopes of military assistance, Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform became a demand for universal manhood suffrage (every man a citizen), and hopes for accountable government were increasingly represented by the call for an Irish republic—terms that clearly anticipated a violent break with the Crown.

=== Preparation ===

Beginning with an obligation of each society to drill a company, and of three companies to form a battalion, the New System of Organisation was adapted to military preparation With only Ulster and Leinster organised, the leadership remained split between the two provincial directories. In June 1797, they met together in Dublin to consider the demands for an immediate rising from the northerners who, reeling from martial-law seizures and arrests, feared the opportunity to strike was passing. The meeting broke up in disarray, with many of the Ulster delegates fleeing abroad. The authorities were sufficiently satisfied with the severity of their countermeasures in Ulster that in August they restored civil law in the province.

The initiative passed to the Leinster directory which had recruited two radically disaffected members of the Patriot opposition: Lord Edward FitzGerald, who brought with him experience of the American war, and Arthur O&#x27;Connor (later, undistinguished, as an officer of Napoleon&#x27;s Irish Legion). The directory believed themselves too weak to act in the summer of 1797, but through the winter the movement appeared to strengthen in existing strongholds such as Dublin, County Kildare and County Meath, and to break new ground in the midlands and the south-east. In February 1798, a return prepared by Fitzgerald computed the number United Irishmen, nationwide, at 269,896. But there were doubts as to the number would heed call to arms and whether they could muster more than simple pikes (over the previous year the authorities had seized 70,630 of these compared to just 4,183 blunderbusses and 225 musket barrels). While the movement had withstood the government&#x27;s countermeasures, and seditious propaganda and preparation continued, there was hesitation to act without the certainty of French arms and assistance.

== Soliciting French, and British-Jacobin, alliances ==

===Hoche&#x27;s expedition December 1796 ===

In 1795, from American exile Tone had travelled to Paris where he sought to convince the French Directory that Ireland was the key to breaking Britain&#x27;s maritime stranglehold. His &quot;memorials&quot; on the situation in Ireland came to the attention of Director Lazare Carnot, and by May, General Henri Clarke, the Irish-descendant head of the War Ministry&#x27;s &quot;Bureau Topographique&quot;, had drafted an invasion plan. In June, Carnot offered General Lazare Hoche command of an Irish expedition that would secure &quot;the safety of France for centuries to come.&quot;

Originally, it was to have been accompanied by two diversionary raids on England: one against Newcastle, the other against Bristol. In the event, because of pressing demands in Italy, the forty thousand men called for could not be mustered.

Under Hoche, a force of 15,000 veteran troops was assembled at Brest. Sailing on 16 December, accompanied by Tone, the French arrived off the coast of Ireland at Bantry Bay on 22 December 1796. Unremitting storms prevented a landing. Tone remarked that &quot;England [...] had its luckiest escape since the Armada&quot;. The fleet returned home and the army intended to spearhead the invasion of Ireland was split up and sent, along with a growing Irish Legion, to fight in other theatres of the French Revolutionary Wars.

Bantry Bay had nonetheless made real the prospect of French intervention, and United societies flooded with new members. There were increasing reports of Defenders and United Irishmen &quot;marauding&quot; for weapons, and openly parading. In May 1797, Yeomanry, which in the north had begun recruiting entire Orange lodges, charged gatherings near Cootehill in Cavan killing eleven, and in Dundalk killing fourteen.

=== Naval mutinies ===
Seeking to justify the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in Britain, the authorities were quick to see the hand of both Irish and English radicals in the Spithead and Nore mutinies of April and May 1797. The United Irish were reportedly behind the resolution of the Nore mutineers to hand the fleet over to the French &quot;as the only government that understands the Rights of Man&quot;. Much was made of Valentine Joyce, a leader at Spithead, described by Edmund Burke as a &quot;seditious Belfast clubist&quot;. But no evidence emerges of a concerted United Irish plot to subvert the fleet. There had only been talk of seizing British warships as part of a general insurrection.

The mutinies had paralysed the British navy, but the Batavian fleet that the French had prepared for their forces at Texel was again opposed by the weather. In October 1797, after Tone and the troops he was to accompany to Ireland had been disembarked, the fleet sought to reach the French naval base at Brest and was destroyed by the Royal Navy at the Battle of Camperdown. 

In Paris, Tone recognised the rising star of Napoleon Bonaparte. But he found the conqueror of Italy incurious about the Irish situation being in need of a war of conquest, not of liberation, to pay his army. In February 1798, British spies did report that the First Consul was preparing a fleet in the Channel ports ready for the embarkation of up to 50,000 men, but the preparations were soon reversed. Bonaparte deemed both the military and naval forces assembled inadequate to the task. In later exile, he was to claim that he might have made an attempt on Ireland (instead of sailing in May 1798 for Egypt) had he had confidence in Tone the other United Irish agents appearing in Paris. He describes them as divided in opinion and constantly quarrelling.

=== British co-conspiracy ===
These agents from Ireland included James Coigly. A Catholic priest who had been active in bringing Defenders into the movement in Ulster, Coigly sought to persuade both French Directory and the leadership in Ireland of a larger project. Beginning in 1796, United Irish agents had helped build networks of United Englishmen and United Scotsmen, societies whose proceedings, oath-taking, and advocacy of physical force &quot;mirrored that of their Irish inspirators&quot;. Describing himself as an emissary of the United Irish executive, assisted by a tide of refugees from Ulster, and tapping into protest against the Combination Acts and wartime food shortages, Coigly worked from Manchester to spread the United system across the manufacturing districts of northern England. In London, he conferred with Irishmen prominent in the city&#x27;s federation of democratic clubs, the London Corresponding Society. With these he drew together delegates from Scotland and the provinces who, as &quot;United Britons&quot;, resolved &quot;to overthrow the present Government, and to join the French as soon as they made a landing in England&quot;.

In July 1797, the resolution of the United Britons was discussed by the leadership in Dublin and Belfast. Although addressed to the prospect of a French invasion, the suggestion that &quot;England, Scotland and Ireland are all one people acting for one common cause&quot;, encouraged militants to believe that liberty could be won even if &quot;the French should never come here&quot;.

== The risings ==
=== Eve-of-rebellion arrests ===
In early 1798, a series of violent attacks on magistrates in County Tipperary, County Kildare and King&#x27;s County alarmed the authorities. They were also aware that there was now a faction of the United Irish leadership, led by Fitzgerald and O&#x27;Connor, who felt &quot;sufficiently well organised and equipped&quot; to begin an insurgency without French assistance. The Viceroy, Lord Camden, came under increasing pressure from hardline Irish MPs, led by Speaker John Foster, to crack down on the growing disorder in the south and midlands and arrest the Dublin leadership.

Camden hesitated, partly as he feared a crackdown would itself provoke an insurrection: the British Home Secretary Lord Portland agreed, describing the proposals as &quot;dangerous and inconvenient&quot;. The situation changed when an informer, Thomas Reynolds, produced Fitzgerald&#x27;s report on manpower with its suggestion that over a quarter of a million men across Ulster, Leinster and Munster were preparing to join the &quot;revolutionary army&quot;. The Irish government learned from Reynolds that a meeting of the Leinster Provincial Committee and Directory had been set for 10 March in the Dublin house of wool merchant Oliver Bond, where a motion for an immediate rising would be tabled. Camden decided to act, explaining to London that he risked having the Irish Parliament turn against him.

On the 10th, In March 1798, almost the entire committee were seized, along with two directors, the comparative moderates (those who, in the absence of the French, had counselled delay) William James MacNeven and Thomas Addis Emmet, together with all their papers. Meanwhile in England, O&#x27;Connor had been arrested alongside Coigly. Having been found in possession of a further address to the French Directory, Coigly was hanged, and the United network he had helped build in Britain was broken up by internment. In Dublin, Fitzgerald went into hiding.

The Irish government imposed martial law on 30 March, although civil courts continued sitting. Overall command of the army was transferred from Ralph Abercromby to Gerard Lake who turned his attention to Leinster and Munster where from Ulster his troops&#x27; reputation for public floggings, half-hanging, pitch-capping and other interrogative refinements preceded him.

=== The Call from Dublin ===
Faced with the breaking-up of their entire system, Fitzgerald, joined by Samuel Neilson (publisher in Belfast of the Society paper &quot;Northern Star,&quot; recently released from Kilmainham Prison), and by John and Henry Sheares, resolved on a general uprising for 23 May. There was no immediate promise of assistance from France (on the 19th a French expeditionary force had set sail, under Napoleon, but for Egypt, not Ireland). The United army in Dublin was to seize strategic points in the city, while the armies in the surrounding counties would throw up a cordon and advance into its centre. As soon as these developments were signalled by halting mail coaches from the capital, the rest of the country was to rise.

On the appointed day, the rising in the city was aborted. Fitzgerald had been mortally wounded on the 19th, the Sheares brothers were betrayed the 21st, and on the morning of the 23rd, Neilson, who had been critical to the planning, was seized. Armed with last minute intelligence, a large force of military occupied the rebels&#x27; intended assembly points, persuading those who had turned out to dump weapons and disperse. The plan to intercept the mail coaches miscarried, with only the Munster-bound coach halted at Johnstown, County Kildare, near Naas. The organisation in the outer districts of the city nonetheless rose as planned and were swiftly followed by the surrounding counties.

=== Leinster ===
The first clashes of the rebellion took place just after dawn on 24 May in County Kildare. After the Munster mail coach was attacked on its approach to Naas on the night of the 23rd, a 1000 to 3,000 men approached the town. Their pikes could not prevail against grapeshot and steady musket fire. A garrison of less than 200 routed the rebels, with a small cavalry detachment cutting down over a hundred as they fled.

Success did attend a smaller rebel force, commanded by John Esmonde, a Protestant physician who had deserted from the Yeomanry, later that day at Prosperous. The town was not to be re-occupied until after a rebel defeat at Ovidstown on 19 June, but a succession of rebel reversals further afield, including defeats at Carlow (25 May) and of a larger host at the Hill of Tara in County Meath (May 26) persuaded many of the Kildare insurgents that their cause was lost.

Rebels were to remain longest in the field in south-east, in Wexford and in the Mountains of Wicklow. It is commonly suggested that the trigger for the rising in Wexford was the arrival on 26 May of the notorious North Cork Militia. On 27 May, underestimating the hill-top position and resolve of a rebel party hastily assembled under a local priest, John Murphy, a force of the militia and yeomanry was cut down outside the town of Oulart. The insurgents then swept south through Wexford Town where they released, and gave command to, the local United Irish leader, a Protestant barrister, Bagenal Harvey.
On 5 June, Bagnel, leading a force of 3,000, failed in an attempt to storm New Ross whose capture might have opened the way to the large bodies of Defenders known to exist in Kilkenny and Waterford. During and after the battle, government forces systematically killed captured and wounded rebels. On news of the defeat, rebels in the rear killed up to 200 loyalist prisoners (men, women and children): the notorious Scullabogue Barn massacre.

Meanwhile, attempts to break northward and open a road through Wicklow toward Dublin were checked 1 June at Bunclody and, despite the deployment of guns captured in an ambush at Tubberneering, at Arklow on 9 June. The rebels fell back toward the south, meeting the survivors of New Ross and forming a camp of 16,000 on Vinegar Hill outside the town of Enniscorthy. There, on 21 June, they were surrounded, bombarded and routed by a force of 13,000 under General Lake.

The remnants of the &quot;Republic of Wexford&quot; established a base in Killaughrim Woods, in the north of the county, under James Corcoran. Others sought action elsewhere. On 24 June, 8,000 men converged in two columns led by Father Murphy and by Myles Byrne on Castlecomer in County Kilkenny where it was hoped the area&#x27;s militant colliers would join them. Unprepared, the miners did not tip the balance and at the end of the day both garrison and rebels retreated from the burning town. Byrne led his men into the Wicklow Mountains where Joseph Holt and Michael Dwyer commanded a guerrilla resistance. Murphy&#x27;s men passed into Kildare where, after the priest was captured, they joined rebels withdrawn under William Aylmer into the Bog of Allen. After a number of bruising engagements, the &quot;Wexford croppies&quot; moved into Meath making a last stand at Knightstown bog on 14 July. A few hundred survivors returned to Kildare where at Sallins they surrendered on the 21st.

All but their leaders benefited from an amnesty intended by the new Lord Lieutenant, Charles Cornwallis to flush out remaining resistance. The law was pushed through the Irish Parliament by the Chancellor, Lord Clare. A staunch defender of the Ascendancy, Clare was determined to separate Catholics from the greater enemy, &quot;Godless Jacobinism.&quot;

=== Ulster ===
In the north, there had been no response to the call from Dublin. On 29 May, following news of the fighting in Leinster, county delegates meeting in Armagh, voted out the hesitant Ulster directory and resolved that if the adjutant generals of Antrim and Down could not agree a general plan of insurrection, they would return to their occupations and &quot;deceive the people no more&quot;. In response, Robert Simms, who refused to consider action in the absence of the French, resigned his command in Antrim. Amidst charges of betrayal by aristocrats, cowards and traitors, his colonels turned to the young Henry Joy McCracken. Fearful that the &quot;hope of a union with the south&quot; was otherwise lost, McCracken proclaimed the First Year of Liberty on 6 June.

On 7 June, there were local musters across the county, and west of the Bann at Maghera. The green flag was raised in Ballymena, and there were attacks on Larne, Glenarm, Carrickfergus, Toomebridge and Ballymoney. But by the following morning, before any coordination had been possible, those who turned out had begun to dump arms and disperse on news of McCracken defeat. Leading a body of four to six thousand, their commander had failed, with heavy losses, to seize Antrim Town.

From the point of view of the military, the insurrection in County Antrim ended on 9 June with the surrender of Ballymena (under an amnesty that spared it the fate of Randalstown, Templepatrick and Ballymoney—all set ablaze). A diminishing band under McCracken dispersed when, on the 14th, they received news of the decisive defeat of the Army of the Republic in County Down.

Plans for a simultaneous rising in Down on the 7th had been disrupted by the arrest of the county&#x27;s adjutant general, William Steele Dickson, and all his colonels. But beginning on the 9th younger officers took the initiative. An ambush outside Saintfield, an attack upon Newtownards, and the seizure of guns from a ship in Bangor harbour, persuaded General Nugent to concentrate his forces for a counteroffensive in Belfast. The republic in north Down, which extended down the Ards peninsula to Portaferry from which the rebels, under naval fire, were repulsed on the 11th, lasted but three days. Nugent moved on the 12th, and by the morning of the 13th had routed the main rebel conjunction under Dickson&#x27;s successor, a young Lisburn draper, Henry Monro, outside Ballynahinch.

Stories of Catholic desertion at the Battle of Ballynahinch were common, although a more sympathetic account has Defenders decamping only after Munro rejected their proposal for a night attack on the riotous soldiery in the town as taking an &quot;ungenerous advantage&quot;. These were denied by James Hope who had been one of the principal United emissaries to the Defenders. He insisted that Defenders had not appeared among the rebels in separate ranks, and that the body that deserted Munro on the eve of battle had been &quot;the Killinchy people ... and they were Dissenters&quot;.

Historian Marianne Elliott notes that, in Down, Catholics had a formal parity in the United organisation. Prior to the final arrests, they accounted for three of the county&#x27;s six colonels. As they dominated only in the southern third of the county this, she suggests, did not reflect a practice of separate Catholic divisions.

=== Munster ===
In the southwest, in Munster, there were just two skirmishes: on 19 June near Clonakilty in West Cork, the &quot;Battle of the Big Cross&quot; and, after the principal action was over, on 24 July, an attempt to free prisoners at Ninemilehouse in County Tipperary. The province had been subject to pacification ten years before: a martial-law regime suppressed a semi-insurrectionary Rightboy agrarian resistance movement. Following the French appearance off Bantry in December 1796, the exercise was repeated. With a license to &quot;treat the people with as much harshness as possible&quot;, troops of the line, militia, yeomanry and fencibles, were garrisoned across the region recovering arms, arresting large numbers of United suspects, and dragooning young men into militia service.

In May 1797, the entire committee of the relatively strong United organisation that the Sheares brothers had built in Cork City were arrested. In April 1798, the authorities broke up what remained.

The confrontation on 19 June was between a column of Westmeath Militia and a force of 300-400 lightly armed local peasantry, who, according to one account, appealed to the militia men to join their party and were instead met with fire. The Clonakilty Catholics were afterwards admonished in their chapel by the town&#x27;s Protestant vicar for being so &quot;foolish&quot; as &quot;to think that ... country farmers and labourers [could] set up as politicians, reformers, and law makers&quot;.

== French epilogue ==
Connacht, in the far west, the poorest of the Irish provinces, was drawn into the rebellion only by the arrival on 22 August of the French. About 1,000 French soldiers under General Humbert landed at Kilcummin, County Mayo. Joined by up to 5,000 hastily assembled &quot;uncombed, ragged&quot; and shoeless peasants, they had some initial success. In what would later become known as the &quot;Races of Castlebar&quot; they set to flight a militia force of 6,000 under Lake.

In the wake of the victory, Humbert proclaimed the Irish Republic with the French-educated John Moore as president of the government of Connacht. But unable to make timely contact with a new rising sparked in County Longford and County Meath, after a token engagement with British forces of some 26,000 at Ballinamuck, in County Longford, Humbert surrendered on 8 September, along with 500 Irish under Bartholomew Teeling.

What was recalled in the Irish-speaking region as (the year of the French), concluded with slaughter of some 2000 poorly-armed insurgents outside Killala on the 23rd. They had been led by a scion of Mayo&#x27;s surviving Catholic gentry, James Joseph MacDonnell. Terror ensued with Mayo&#x27;s High Sheriff, Denis Browne (the future Marquess of Sligo) earning the nickname &quot;Donnchadh an Rópa&quot; (Denis the Rope).

To Tone&#x27;s dismay, the French Directory concluded from Humbert&#x27;s account of his misadventure that the Irish were to be compared with the devoutly Catholic peasantry they had battled at home in the Vendée. He had to rebuff the suggestion that, rather than a secular republic, he consider a restoration of the Jacobite Pretender, Henry Benedict Stuart, as Henry IX, King of the Irish.

On 12 October, Tone was aboard a second French expedition, carrying a force of 3,000 men, that was intercepted off the coast of County Donegal, the Battle of Tory Island. Taken captive, Tone regretted nothing done &quot;to raise three million of my countrymen to the ranks of citizen,&quot; and lamented only those &quot;atrocities committed on both sides&quot; during his exile. On the eve of execution, he cut his own throat.

== Human toll ==

=== Casualties ===
In what was to be the most widely read account of the rebellion since its centenary, &quot;The Year of Liberty&quot; (1969), Thomas Pakenham (overlooking 1741, the famine &quot;year of slaughter&quot;) wrote:The rebellion of 1798 is the most violent and tragic event in Irish history between the Jacobite wars and the Great Famine. In the space of a few weeks, 30,000 – peasants armed with pikes and pitchforks, defenceless women and children – were cut down, shot, or blown like chaff as they charged up to the mouth of the canon. Thirty thousand is mid range between what had been the contemporary estimates (of which just 2,000 were thought to be Crown forces and 1,000 loyalist civilians). Recent studies suggest a lower figure. A demographic study of County Wexford, the rebellion&#x27;s principal theatre, indicates 6,000 killed. From this, historian Thomas Bartlett, concludes &quot;a death toll of 10,000 for the entire island would seem to be in order&quot;. Others suspect that the widespread fear of repression led relatives to hide their losses. It is not clear how many of those killed died in combat.

=== Military atrocities ===

Accounts of rebel outrages against loyalist civilians circulated widely. These helped secure defections from the republican cause. They also deflected criticism of the military counter terror that had come from loyal, even establishment, figures. Lord Moira (the future Governor-General of India) collated evidence of crimes and abuses by the Crown&#x27;s forces which he sought to present to the King.

In February 1798, the British commander-in-chief General Sir Ralph Abercromby publicly rebuked his predecessor, Henry Luttrell, Lord Carhampton, for bequeathing an army &quot;in a state of licentiousness, which must render it formidable to everyone but the enemy&quot;. But, finding his efforts to restore military discipline and the supremacy of the civil power unsupported by Dublin Castle, he resigned in April. He was replaced by General Gerrard Lake.

With Lake issuing an order to take no prisoners, during the rebellion summary justice was carried into the field. Captured and wounded rebels were killed, sometimes on a large scale. After accepting their surrender near Curragh, on 27 May Crown forces killed up to 500 Kildare rebels – the Gibbet Rath executions. A further 200 (Wolfe Tone&#x27;s brother Matthew among them) were executed after Humbert&#x27;s surrender at Ballinamuck on 9 September.

Civilians in theatres of operation were brutally interrogated and murdered, their houses burned. Cornwallis, who commanded the response to Humbert&#x27;s arrival, was moved to threaten his &quot;licentious&quot; soldiery (among whom he counted his Catholic militia the most &quot;ferocious and cruel&quot;) with summary execution. During and after the rebellion, using their local knowledge the loyalist Yeomanry engaged in their own reprisals. &quot;Pardoned&quot; rebels were a particular target.

=== Rebel outrages ===

County Wexford was the only area which saw widespread rebel atrocities. Of these the most notorious were the killings at Scullabogue and on Wexford bridge. After the rebel defeat at New Ross, on June 5 between one to two hundred loyalist hostages, men, women and children, were packed into a barn at Scullabogue that was set alight. Bagenal Harvey resigned his rebel command in protest. In Wexford town on 20 June, after a United Irish &quot;Committee of Public Safety&quot; had been swept aside, seventy loyalist prisoners were marched to the bridge over the River Slaney and piked to death. There were a small number of Catholics among the loyalists killed, and of Protestants among the rebels present. But for government propagandists, the sectarian nature of the outrages was unquestioned.

== Women in the rebellion ==
The United Irishmen and the Defenders were male fraternities. There is little record for the Defenders, but for United Irishmen it is clear that women nonetheless played an active role in the movement. By 1797 the Castle informer Francis Higgins was reporting that &quot;women are equally sworn with men&quot; suggesting that some of the women, assuming risks for the United Irish cause, were taking places beside men in an increasingly clandestine organisation. It is in a person named Mrs. Risk, that R.R. Madden, one of the earliest historians of the United Irishmen, summarises their various activities: carrying intelligence, hiding weapons, running safe houses.

In the risings, women came forward in many capacities, some, as celebrated in later ballads (&quot;Betsy Gray&quot; and &quot;Brave Moll Doyle, the Heroine of New Ross&quot;), as combatants. At Ballynahinch, where legend has Betsy Gray mounted with a green flag upon white horse, the father of the future Lord Kelvin reported seeing women remain on the field and perform deeds as &quot;valiant as the men&quot;. At Vinegar Hill, British officers remarked on &quot;female rebels more vehement than the men&quot;, and on the &quot;many women [who] fought with fury&quot;. The rebel leader Thomas Cloney claimed that he would have carried the day at New Ross had one tenth of his men had had the &quot;warlike&quot; quality of Molly Doyle of Castlebro.

Women suffered greatly in the counterinsurgency. Abduction and rape were common. Women who &quot;in their hundreds, who crisscrossed the country, seeking help for, or news of, their menfolk&quot;, were particularly vulnerable.

== Aftermath ==

=== Last resistance ===
On 1 July 1798 in Belfast, the birthplace of the United Irish movement, it was reported that no man appeared in the street without wearing the red coat of the Yeomanry. As he enlisted former radicals into his Portglenone Yeomanry, Anglican clergyman Edward Hudson claimed that &quot;the brotherhood of affection [between Catholic and Protestant] is over&quot;. However, the widespread return in the winter 1799–1800 of flogging, arms raids and assassinations to rural east Ulster suggests that in Presbyterian districts the spirit of rebellion was not yet extinguished. The holdouts had organised in Defender cells from whose oaths references to religion had been notably dropped.

The execution in February 1800 of one of these irreconcilables, Roddy McCorley &quot;at the bridge of Toome&quot;, enters into Irish republican martyrology through a ballad written in the 1890s by Ethna Carberry. At the time, it was the name of McCorley&#x27;s captain, Thomas Archer, that captivated the public imagination. His execution in Ballymena in March 1800 (with his body left hanging in cage &quot;in terrorem&quot; for several months), and of fifteen of his confederates, marked the final end of the insurgency in Antrim.

In the south-east, in County Wicklow, the United Irish General, Joseph Holt, fought on until his negotiated surrender in Autumn 1798. It was not until December 1803, following the construction of a military road into the Wicklow mountains and the failure of Emmet&#x27;s rising in Dublin, that the last organised rebel forces under Captain Michael Dwyer capitulated. Small pockets of rebel resistance had also survived within Wexford and the last rebel group under James Corcoran was not vanquished until his death in February 1804.

In the west, after Battles of Ballinamuck and Killala, remnants of the &quot;Republic of Connacht&quot; had held out for some months in the hills of Erris and Tyrawley in County Mayo and in Connemara in County Galway from where James MacDonnell, vanquished at Killala, escaped to France.

=== Fate of the United Irish and rebel leadership ===
Taken prisoner, those who had commanded rebels in the field faced court martial and execution. This was the fate of Bagenal Harvey, Fr. Philip Roche, and five others hanged on Wexford Bridge; John Esmonde hanged in Sallins with his coat reversed to indicate that he was a Yeomanry deserter; Watty Graham whose head was paraded through Maghera; Henry Joy McCracken hanged before the Market House in Belfast; Fr John Murphy, stripped, flogged, hanged, decapitated, his corpse burnt in a barrel of tar and his head impaled on a spike in Tullow; Henry Munro whose piked head was displayed on the Market House in Lisburn; and Bartholomew Teeling, whose body was committed to a mass grave for rebels at Croppies&#x27; Acre, Dublin.

The Sheares brothers had been hanged, drawn and quartered in Dublin in July. Once confident that the rebellion had been contained, Cornwallis, and his Chief Secretary, Lord Castlereagh, resisted pressure from the Irish Parliament to proceed against the other directory leaders held as state prisoners. Under terms negotiated by Thomas Addis Emmet, William James MacNeven, and Arthur O&#x27;Connor, and confident that government informers had left little to disclose, the prisoners promised to give a full account of their activities to a secret House of Commons committee in return for exile, into which they were released in 1802.

Michael Dwyer negotiated his surrender in December 1803 on terms that permitted him, and all his party, to be transported to New South Wales, Australia, as unsentenced exiles. Reprieved by Cornwallis, in 1799 John Moore, Humbert&#x27;s President of Connacht, was also to have been transported, but he died in custody.

=== Rebel ministers and priests ===

In Ulster, some twenty Presbyterian ministers and probationers were implicated in the insurrectionary movement. Two were executed. Others were allowed American exile, including William Steele Dickson and, notwithstanding that he had led the rebels at Newtownards, the young probationer David Bailie Warden. Reacting to what he identified as &quot;the democratic party in the [Presbyterian] synod, most of whom, if not engaged in the Rebellion, were deeply infected with its principles&quot;, Castlereagh moved to condition the size and payment to ministers of the synod&#x27;s Crown grant (&quot;regium donum&quot;) upon professions and proofs of loyalty.

In the spirit of reaction, between 1798 and 1800 at least 69 Catholic chapels were destroyed or damaged, mostly in south Leinster. It was not, however, the policy of the government to target the Catholic church. With Cornwallis and Castlereagh, British Prime Minister, William Pitt, was persuaded that, while the Catholic peasantry had been roused, the source of the rebellion had been Jacobinism, and not Catholicism.

The Catholic bishops had been almost totally united in their condemnation of disaffection, and voiced no criticism of government policy of &quot;the bayonet, the gibbet, and the lash&quot;. The ten or so priests involved in the fighting in County Wexford, were rejected by their bishop, James Caufield of Ferns, as &quot;the very faeces of the church&quot;. Two were killed, and four, including Roche and Murphy, were executed. Two priests were also sent to the gallows in Mayo. Their bishop, Dominic Bellew of Killala had served as president of the &quot;committee of public safety&quot; in Ballina but he satisfied Dublin Castle that his sole purpose had been to prevent rebel outrages.

Pitt&#x27;s plans, conceived in advance of the rebellion, for a legislative union had included a final act of Catholic emancipation. It was only after he had resigned in the face of opposition from the King and court party, that additional measures were thought necessary to secure the loyalty of the Catholic clergy. The government that had since 1795 endowed the Catholic seminary at Maynooth, now proposed that, in return for future episcopal appointments in Ireland being subject to Crown approval, that its graduates enjoy their own regium donum—that like Presbyterian ministers, priests receive a government stipend. But this too proved too much for the king, and Cornwallis was obliged to withdraw the offer.

=== The Union ===
In August 1800, the Irish Parliament (induced by extensive favours and emoluments) agreed to abolish itself. Under the Acts of Union, Irish representation, purged of many of the pocket boroughs but still narrow and exclusively Protestant, was transferred to Westminster, now styled as the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

In seeking to rally support for a renewal of the rebellion in 1803, Robert Emmet argued that if Ireland had cause in 1798, it had only been compounded by subjecting Ireland to &quot;a foreign parliament&quot; in which &quot;seven-eights of the population have no right to send a member of their body to represent them&quot; and in which the &quot;other eight part&quot; are &quot;the tools and taskmasters, acting for the cruel English government and their Irish Ascendancy--a monster still worse, if possible than foreign tyranny&quot;. Yet at the time, there was no popular protest. This may have reflected the demoralisation that followed the rebellion&#x27;s crushing defeat, but for the Irish Parliament there was little nostalgia. From exile in Hamburg, Archibald Hamilton Rowan predicted that, in depriving the Anglo-Irish lords of their &quot;corrupt assembly&quot;, the union would itself see &quot;the wreck of the old Ascendancy&quot;. (In opposing the union, this was the express fear of the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, John Foster).

=== Emmet&#x27;s rebellion ===

Emmet and his co-conspirators worked to re-establish the United Irish organisation on strictly military lines, but otherwise planning for a republican rising relied on broadly the same strategy as in &#x27;98. Hopes of outside assistance were abandoned in 1802 when, what Emmett acknowledged as a &quot;similar attempt in England&quot; (the &quot;Despard Plot&quot;) was crushed, and when French forces under Humbert were assigned by Napoleon, not to the liberation of Ireland, but to the re-enslavement of Haiti. Through a series of mishaps and missteps an attempt in July 1803 to seize Dublin Castle and other key points in the capital, misfired, and rebels in Kildare dispersed. Without promised firearms, Michael Dwyer refused to lead his men down from the Wicklow Mountains. In Ulster, despite being represented by the original Society&#x27;s two most successful organisers in the north, Thomas Russell and James Hope, the republic proclaimed by Emmet rallied neither former United men nor Defenders.

Many of those arrested or taken prisoner in &#x27;98 were transported to penal colonies of New South Wales. In March 1804, when news reached them of Emmet&#x27;s rising, several hundred convicts mutinied in the hope of capturing ships for a return to Ireland. They were routed in an encounter loyalists celebrated as the Second Battle of Vinegar Hill.

== Contested commemoration ==
=== O&#x27;Connell and Young Ireland ===
In 1801, Sir Richard Musgrave&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of the Different Rebellions in Ireland&quot; presented the first &quot;seminal history&quot; of rebellion. &quot;Violently anti-Catholic&quot;, it devoted just 12 pages to events in Ulster, compared to 600 on the rebellion in Leinster. Notwithstanding the loyalty of the Catholic Church, the Ascendancy was determined to paint the rebellion as a &quot;Popish&quot; conspiracy. Daniel O&#x27;Connell who, enrolled in a yeomanry corps, had sat out the rebellion in his native County Kerry, retorted that the United Irishmen had been the dupes, not of Catholics intent on driving Protestants from Ireland, but of a government seeking a pretext for abolishing the Irish Parliament. Neither in the mass mobilisation he led for Catholic emancipation nor, in the years to the Great Famine, for repeal of the union, did O&#x27;Connell invoke the spirit of &quot;&#x27;98&quot;.

In 1831, Thomas Moore, who, citing the need to engage with the Presbyterian north, refused a parliamentary nomination from O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s a Repeal Association, presented his &quot;Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald&quot; as a &quot;justification of the men of &#x27;98 – the &quot;ultimi Romanorum&quot; of our country&quot;. His perspective was broadly shared by the Young Irelanders who, on the principle of physical force, broke with O&#x27;Connell in 1846. The journalism of, the Protestant, Young Irelanders Thomas Davis in &quot;The Nation,&quot; and John Mitchel in the &quot;United Irishman&quot;, accorded 1798 an honoured place in a nationalist narrative.

=== Centenary 1898 ===
In pilgrimages to Wolfe Tone&#x27;s graveside at Bodenstown, County Kildare, first held in 1873, a new generation of Irish republicans claimed the legacy of the rebellion. But in the sectarian polarisation that marked consideration of the 1886 and 1893 Home Rule bills, narrower interpretations prevailed. &quot;Despite the enthusiastic republicanism expressed by so many of the early organisers&quot; (among them veterans of physical-force Fenianism), the Centenary celebrations in Dublin bore &quot;the stamp&quot; of constitutional nationalism, O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s home-rule successors. The public were assured that the United Irishmen had been established to secure Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform, and had only taken up arms, and the cause of a republic, once the obstinacy of the Ascendancy had closed all constitutional paths.

Finding Protestants loath to acknowledge their connection to those she saw as having sealed Tone&#x27;s union of creeds on &quot;the battle field and scaffold&quot;, Alice Milligan had to confine her commemorative displays in Belfast to Catholic districts. A processive outing to the grave of Betsy Gray, heroine of the Battle of Ballynahinch, ended in a fracas and the destruction of her memorial stone. Unionists willing to recall the turnout under McCracken and Munro, insisted that had their forefathers been offered a Union under the British constitution as it later developed there would have been &quot;no rebellion&quot;.

The centenary year saw the fifth and sixth editions of Fr. Patrick Kavanagh&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; &quot;Popular History of the Insurrection of 1798&quot; (1874). Kavanagh did not, as has been suggested, depict the rebellion as &quot;a purely Catholic affair&quot;, but neither did he see cause to profile the republicanism of the United directories. Wexford historian Louis Cullen finds that in Kavanagh&#x27;s chronicle &quot;the concept of the priest leader emerges to a degree which did not exist in contemporary accounts&quot;.

=== Sesquicentennial 1948 ===
In 1948, attempting, post-partition, to organise Protestant participation in a commemoration of the 150th anniversary, writer Denis Ireland, and trade unionists Victor Halley and Jack MacGougan, were denied permission to rally in Belfast&#x27;s city centre. Instead, it was from nationalist west Belfast, that they led a procession to McArt&#x27;s Fort, the site overlooking the town where in June 1795 Wolfe Tone and members of the United Irish northern executive took an oath &quot;never to desist in our efforts until we had subverted the authority of England over our country&quot;.

In the south, in &quot;Éire&quot;, the sesquicentennial of the rebellion was background to the consideration and passage of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into effect on 18 April 1949, Easter Monday, the 33rd anniversary of the beginning of the 1916 Easter Rising.

In 1960, the accidental discovery of the remains of John Moore occasioned a state funeral in Castlebar. President Éamon de Valera (veteran of 1916), together with the ambassadors of France and (Francoist) Spain, honoured Moore as both &quot;Ireland&#x27;s first president&quot; and (with greater poetic license) &quot;a descendant of [the Catholic martyr] St Thomas More&quot;.

=== Bicentennial 1998 ===

The 1998 bicentenary coincided with the hopes entertained in the Good Friday, Belfast Agreement for reconciliation and an end to thirty years of political violence in Northern Ireland. In Dublin, the Government of Ireland described itself as having

... set out to avoid what we identified as a flaw in the commemorations of 1898, 1938 and 1948. That is the excessive emphasis on the Catholic Nationalist version of the rebellion which saw 1798 only as a crusade for faith and fatherland. Inevitably, that partisan approach alienated many others, including the descendants of the Ulster United Irishmen who had been so much to the forefront in the 1790s.

Supported by a reversion in the scholarship of rebellion to &quot;a romantic, celebratory style of history writing&quot;, and by criticism not only of Kavanagh&#x27;s interpretation but also, with its heavy reliance on the available loyalist sources, of Thomas Pakenham&#x27;s celebrated &quot;The Year of Liberty&quot; (1969), the official commemorations emphasised the United Irishmen&#x27;s non-sectarian, enlightened, French and American-inspired, democratic ideals.

Contrary to what it characterised as the &quot;sectarian and narrow-minded folklore&quot; of the rebellion, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; noted that even in Wexford, typically associated with fighting priests, Protestants had played a leading role. Executed alongside Bagenal Harvey on Wexford Bridge, Matthew Keogh, the United governor of Wexford town, had also been a member of the established Church of Ireland. So had four of the eight members of the town&#x27;s committee and all three United colonels for the baronies of Forth and Bargy.

Not all historians contributed in the spirit of the official commemorations. There were those who argued that &quot;the central sectarian component of popular politics and culture in the 1790s&quot; remained regardless of &quot;the United Irishmen&#x27;s ideological and organisational presence&quot;. (As an expression of Presbyterian radicalism, this, in any case, could be seen as a &quot;continuation of the war against popery by other means&quot;). The evidence, at least in the south-east, still supported the Cullen&#x27;s thesis that the rebellion &quot;was a local sectarian civil war between Catholic and Protestant gentry and large tenant farmers&quot;.

=== 1798 in the Ulster-Scots retelling ===
Under the Belfast Agreement, the bicentennial year saw the creation of the &quot;Ulster Scots Agency&quot; (&quot;Tha Boord o Ulstèr-Scotch&quot;)&quot;,&quot; which has advanced its own reclamation of 1798. Its publications, including materials for schools, portray the Ulster Scots (broadly the Presbyterians of Ulster) as having been, while not their equal as the victims of the Ascendancy, in advance of Catholics in the demand for change. The rebellion in Ulster is described as &quot;a struggle for fairness, equal rights, and democracy&quot; [&quot;to right some things we thought wrong&quot;]; in which the militancy of the United Irishmen reflects the character of &quot;a people prepared to agitate when faced with discrimination and unfairness&quot;.

Enlightenment ideas are acknowledged, but they are those of the Scottish Enlightenment. Through the moral philosophy of an Ulsterman, Francis Hutcheson, these draw on the covenanting tradition of Presbyterian resistance to royal and episcopal imposition. Flowing through various channels, they stiffen the resolve of the American patriots (with the &quot;Scotch-Irish&quot; prominent in their ranks). Once affirmed, first by American independence and then by the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, they return to Ulster in the liberal-patriotic resolutions of the Volunteers and of the United Irishmen.

It is a story sceptical of the promised unity of creeds. The risings in Leinster are described as having &quot;the paraphernalia of Roman Catholicism ... more in evidence than the symbolism of the United Irishmen&quot;. With Catholics enrolled in the militia, it is also proposed that the union of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter was &quot;more closely realised in the forces of the crown&quot;.

The result is an interpretation of the rebellion which remains Protestant-centric without restricting itself to the traditional unionist celebration of British loyalties and identity. Recalled in this manner, sociologist Peter Gardner suggests that the Rebellion of 1798 advances an &quot;ethnicising of Ulster Protestants&quot;. They are reimagined as a &quot;disenfranchised and indignant&quot; community &quot;outside of the bounds of colonial power in Ireland&quot;, rather than, as they appear in the traditional Irish nationalist historiography, &quot;its custodians&quot;.

Broadly the same interpretation was advanced by the education committee of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland with a bi-centenary programme that included re-enactments of the battles of Antrim and Ballynahinch. While acknowledging that &quot;members of the [Orange] institution in 1798 supported the forces of the Crown and in many instances whole lodges joined the yeomanry&quot;, the institution, nonetheless, commemorates 1798 &quot;because of the elements of shared history, social justice and `disaffection&#x27;.&quot;

=== Memorials ===

In the Republic of Ireland there are at least 85 public monuments and memorials acknowledging the patriot dead of 1798, including the national Garden of Remembrance in Dublin. In Northern Ireland, the Down District 1798 Bicentennial Committee installed informational plaques to mark the battles of Saintfield and Ballynahinch. In 1900, a large monument commemorating those &quot;who suffered for the parts they took in the memorable insurrection in 1798&quot; was erected over the grave of Michael Dwyer in the Waverley Cemetery, Sydney, Australia.

<text>The Kingdom of Luba (1585–1889) which emerged in the marshy grasslands of the Upemba Depression in what is now southern Congo around 1585, initially began as a kingdom. Over time, through a combination of conquests, strategic marriages, and alliances, it expanded its territory and influence, eventually becoming an empire. This growth in territory and power allowed the Luba state to elevate its status from a kingdom to an empire. 

The following is a list of the Mulopwe (Emperor) of Luba:

<doc id="877375" wikidata="Q1462045" url="?curid=877375" title="Sterile insect technique">
<text>The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a method of biological insect control, whereby overwhelming numbers of sterile insects are released into the wild. The released insects are preferably male, as this is more cost-effective and the females may in some situations cause damage by laying eggs in the crop, or, in the case of mosquitoes, taking blood from humans. The sterile males compete with fertile males to mate with the females. Females that mate with a sterile male produce no offspring, thus reducing the next generation&#x27;s population. Sterile insects are not self-replicating and, therefore, cannot become established in the environment. Repeated release of sterile males over low population densities can further reduce and in cases of isolation eliminate pest populations, although cost-effective control with dense target populations is subjected to population suppression prior to the release of the sterile males.

The technique has successfully been used to eradicate the screw-worm fly (&quot;Cochliomyia hominivorax&quot;) from North and Central America. Many successes have been achieved for control of fruit fly pests, most particularly the Mediterranean fruit fly (&quot;Ceratitis capitata&quot;) and the Mexican fruit fly (&quot;Anastrepha ludens&quot;). Active research is being conducted to determine this technique&#x27;s effectiveness in combatting the Queensland fruit fly (&quot;Bactrocera tryoni&quot;).

Sterilization is induced through the effects of x-ray photon irradiation on the reproductive cells of the insects. SIT does not involve the release of insects modified through transgenic (genetic engineering) processes. Moreover, SIT does not introduce non-native species into an ecosystem.

==History==
The use of sterile males was first described by the Russian geneticist A.S. Serebrovsky in 1940, but the English-speaking world came up with the idea independently, and applied it practically around the 1950s. Raymond Bushland and Edward Knipling developed the SIT to eliminate screw-worms preying on warm-blooded animals, especially cattle; this was effective because female screw-worms mate only once. The larvae of these flies invade open wounds and eat into animal flesh, killing infected cattle within 10 days. In the 1950s, screw-worms caused annual losses to American meat and dairy supplies that were projected at above $200 million. Screw-worm maggots can also parasitize human flesh.

Bushland and Knipling began searching for an alternative to chemical pesticides in the late 1930s when they were working at the United States Department of Agriculture Laboratory in Menard, Texas. At that time, the screw-worm was devastating livestock herds across the American South. Red meat and dairy supplies were affected across Mexico, Central America, and South America.

Knipling developed the theory of autocidal control – breaking the pest&#x27;s reproductive cycle. Bushland&#x27;s enthusiasm for Knipling&#x27;s theory sparked the pair to search for a way to rear flies in a &quot;factory&quot; setting, and to find an effective way to sterilize flies.

Their work was interrupted by World War II, but they resumed their efforts in the early 1950s with successful tests on the screw-worm population of Sanibel Island, Florida. The sterile insect technique worked; near eradication was achieved using X-ray-sterilized flies.

=== Successes ===

In 1954, the technique was used to eradicate screw-worms from the island of Curaçao, off the coast of Venezuela. Screw-worms were eliminated in seven weeks, saving the domestic goat herds that were a source of meat and milk.

During the late 1950s to the 1970s, SIT was used to control the screw-worm population in the US. In the 1980s, Mexico and Belize eliminated their screw-worm problems with SIT. Eradication programs progressed across Central America in the 1990s, followed by the establishment of a biological barrier in Panama to prevent reinfestation from the south. The map shows the current and former distribution area and the approximate seasonal spread of the screw-worm fly.

In 1991, Knipling and Bushland&#x27;s technique halted a serious outbreak of New World screw-worm in northern Africa. Programs against the Mediterranean fruit fly in Mexico, Florida and California use the SIT to maintain their fly-free status. The technique was used to eradicate the melon fly from Okinawa and in the fight against the tsetse fly in Africa.

The technique has suppressed insects threatening livestock, fruit, vegetable, and fiber crops. The technique was lauded for its environmental attributes: it leaves no residues and has no (direct) negative effect on nontarget species.

The technique has been a boon in protecting the agricultural products to feed the world&#x27;s human population. Both Bushland and Knipling received worldwide recognition for their leadership and scientific achievements, including the 1992 World Food Prize. The technique were hailed by former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman as &quot;the greatest entomological achievement of the 20th century.&quot;

South Australia has since 2016 been producing tens of millions of sterile fruit flies a week during peak summer months, as part of a program to control and eventually eradicate the horticultural pests.

== African trypanosomiasis ==

Sleeping sickness or African trypanosomiasis is a parasitic disease in humans. Caused by protozoa of genus &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; and transmitted by the tsetse fly, the disease is endemic in regions of sub-Saharan Africa, covering about 36 countries and 60 million people. An estimated 50,000 – 70,000 people are infected and about 40,000 die every year. The three most recent epidemics occurred in 1896 -1906, 1920, and 1970.

Studies of the tsetse fly show that females generally mate only once (occasionally twice). Studies found this process to be effective in preventing the scourge.

==Successful programs==

* The screw-worm fly (&quot;Cochliomyia hominivorax&quot;) was eradicated from the United States, Mexico, Central America, Puerto Rico and Libya.
* The Mexican fruit fly (&quot;Anastrepha ludens&quot;, Loew) was eradicated from most of northern Mexico.
* The tsetse fly was eradicated from Zanzibar in 1998 and Senegal in 2014.
*The Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly, &quot;Ceratitis capitata&quot;, Wiedemann) was eradicated from the northern part of Chile and southern parts of Argentina, Peru and Mexico. It is being suppressed by SIT in fruit-producing areas of Croatia, Israel, South Africa, Spain, and the United States.
* The codling moth (&quot;Cydia pomonella&quot;) is being effectively suppressed in parts of British Columbia, Canada,
* The pink bollworm (&quot;Pectinophora gossypiella&quot;) eradicated from southwestern USA and northwestern Mexico.
* The false codling moth (&quot;Thaumatotibia leucotreta&quot;) is being effectively suppressed in parts of South Africa.
* The cactus moth (&quot;Cactoblastis cactorum&quot;) was eradicated from an outbreak in Yucatán, Mexico.
* The melon fly (&quot;Bactrocera cucurbitae&quot;, Coquillett) was eradicated from Okinawa.
* The onion fly (&quot;Delia antiqua&quot;) managed in onion production areas in the Netherlands
* The sweet potato weevil (&quot;Cylas formicarius&quot;) was eradicated from Kume Island and Tsuken Island, Okinawa Japan.

==Targets==
* &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquito – malaria vector, example &quot;Anopheles arabiensis&quot;.
* Tsetse fly (&quot;Glossina&quot; spp.) – vector of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock.
* Painted apple moth in Auckland, New Zealand
* &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; and &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; mosquitoes, vectors for filariasis, dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and the Zika virus
* Fruit fly species, including Mediterranean fruit fly (&quot;Ceratitis capitata&quot;), Caribbean fruit fly (&quot;Anastrepha suspensa&quot;) and Mexican fruit fly (&quot;Anastrepha ludens&quot;) in Americas, Queensland fruit fly (&quot;Bactrocera tryoni&quot;) in Australia, the oriental fruit fly (&quot;Bactrocera dorsalis&quot;) in Hawaii, and several other &quot;Bactrocera&quot; spp. across Australia, Asia, and Oceania: FAO/IAEA lists 39 different SIT facilities (DIR-SIT) across the globe, aiding the retrieval of information on mass production and on radiation doses (IDIDAS). It includes data on both the radiation dose required for the disinfestation of generic commodity groups and the radiation dose used to induce sterility for pest control through the SIT.
* West Indian sweet potato weevil from Tsuken Island, Okinawa, Japan.

==History of transboundary shipment of sterile insects==
Transboundary shipment of sterile insects has taken place on a continuous basis for 60 years (since 1963). The total number of sterile insects shipped has been estimated at more than one trillion in thousands of shipments across borders to 23 recipient countries from 50 sterile insect factories in 25 countries. During this long period and many precedents, no problems associated with possible hazards have been identified, and thus the shipment of sterile insects have never been subjected to any regulatory action. The table shows the history of transboundary shipments which started in 1963 with the shipments of sterile Mexican fruit fly (&quot;Anastrepha ludens&quot;, Loew), from Monterrey, Mexico, to Texas, US.

==Drawbacks==
* Naturally low population periods or repeated pesticide treatment are sometimes required to suppress populations before the use of sterile insects.
* Sex separation can be difficult, though this can be easily performed on a large scale where genetic sexing systems have been developed as for the Mediterranean fruit fly.
* Radiation, transport and release treatments can reduce male mating fitness.
* The technique is species-specific. For instance, the technique must be implemented separately for each of the 6 economically important tsetse fly species.
* Mass rearing and irradiation require precision processes. Failures have occurred when unexpectedly fertile breeding males were released.
* Area-wide approach is more effective, as migration of wild insects from outside the control area could recreate the problem.
* The cost of producing sufficient sterile insects can be prohibitive in some locations but decreases with economies of scale.

==Conclusion and perspectives==
Biotechnological approaches based on genetically modified organism (transgenic organisms) are still under development. However, since no legal framework exists to authorize the release of such organisms in nature, sterilization by irradiation remains the most used technique. A meeting was held at FAO headquarters in Rome, 8 to 12 April 2002 on &quot;Status and Risk Assessment of the Use of Transgenic Arthropods in Plant Protection&quot;. The resulting proceedings of the meeting have been used by the North American Plant Protection Organization (NAPPO) to develop NAPPO Regional Standard No. 27 on &quot;Guidelines for Importation and Confined Field release of Transgenic Arthropods&quot;, which might provide the basis for the rational development of the use of transgenic arthropods.

== Economic benefits ==
Economic benefits have been demonstrated. The direct benefits of screwworm eradication to the North and Central American livestock industries are estimated to be over $1.5 billion/year, compared with an investment over half a century around $1 billion. Mexico protects a fruit and vegetable export market of over $3 billion/year through an annual investment around $25 million. Medfly-free status has been estimated to have opened markets for Chile&#x27;s fruit exports up to $500 million. When implemented on an area-wide basis and a scaled rearing process, SIT is cost-competitive with conventional control, in addition to its environmental benefits.

==Related techniques in plants==
A similar technique to SIT has recently been applied to weeds using irradiated pollen, resulting in deformed seeds that do not sprout.

<text>On Avery Island is the debut studio album by American rock band Neutral Milk Hotel. It was released in the United States on March 26, 1996, by Merge Records, and in the United Kingdom on September 30, 1996, by Fire Records. At the time, Neutral Milk Hotel was a solo project of American musician Jeff Mangum, who recorded the album with producer Robert Schneider from February to May 1995. &quot;On Avery Island&quot; is an indie rock and psychedelic folk album, with a lo-fi sound.

== Background and recording ==
Neutral Milk Hotel was formed in Ruston, Louisiana, in the late 1980s, as one of the many home recording projects of musician Jeff Mangum. The simple home recordings Mangum made with his friends Robert Schneider, Bill Doss, and Will Cullen Hart led to the formation of the Elephant 6 musical collective. After graduating from high school, Mangum moved to Seattle, and released the single &quot;Everything Is&quot; on Cher Doll Records, under the alias Neutral Milk Hotel. The single&#x27;s exposure convinced Mangum to record more music under this name. He moved to Denver, and began working with Schneider to record his first album &quot;On Avery Island&quot;.

&quot;On Avery Island&quot; was recorded from February to May 1995, and was produced and engineered by Schneider. According to the album’s liner notes, among a number of instrumental credits, Mangum played guitar, drums and vocals, and Schneider played bass, organ, and composed horn arrangements; the horn parts were played by trombonist Rick Benjamin. It was recorded at two different locations: about half of the album was recorded at the house of musicians Dane Terry and Marisa Bissinger, and the other half was recorded at Pet Sounds Studio. The album was recorded on a four-track reel-to-reel.

== Composition ==
&quot;On Avery Island&quot; is an indie rock and psychedelic folk album with a lo-fi sound. &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; likened the album&#x27;s music to other 1990s lo-fi indie rock acts like Smog and Guided by Voices. &quot;On Avery Island&quot; most experimental song is the thirteen-minute closing track &quot;Pree-Sisters Swallowing a Donkey&#x27;s Eye,&quot; which is a drone song influenced by gamelan and noise music.

&quot;Naomi&quot; is about Naomi Yang of Galaxie 500 and Damon and Naomi.

== Artwork ==
The cover art for the 1996 release of &quot;On Avery Island&quot; was designed by Jeff Mangum and Lisa Janssen. The United Kingdom release had different cover art, designed by Jill Carnes.

In 2023, the album was rereleased with new cover art.

== Release and reception ==
===Initial release===
&quot;On Avery Island&quot; was released in the United States on March 26, 1996, by Merge Records, and in the United Kingdom on September 30, 1996, by Fire Records. It sold around 5,000 copies, which Merge considered a success. &quot;On Avery Island&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Kurt Wolff of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; gave the album four out of five stars, and wrote: &quot;Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s debut is a trippy experience, at times downright crowded with noise. But at the core of every song is a solid, tangible melody, the kind that rings through your brain all day long.&quot; Mike Goldsmith of &quot;NME&quot; gave it an 8/10, and said: &quot;Neutral Milk Hotel can convert miserable-as-sin introspection into folky mantras that bore into your skull like a well-aimed power drill.&quot; &quot;On Avery Island&quot; was ranked at number thirty-five on &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop poll for 1996.

After the release of &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, Mangum recruited three musicians to tour with: Julian Koster, Jeremy Barnes, and Scott Spillane. On April 28, 1997, Neutral Milk Hotel began a national tour, during which the band members learned to play as a unit. The &quot;On Avery Island&quot; tour generated enough money for the band members to afford to move to Athens, Georgia, where a large group of Elephant 6 musicians were living. By the spring of 1997, Mangum had written and demoed nearly every song for a second album. He shared the demos with his bandmates before they moved to Denver to record the album &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;.

=== Retrospective commentary ===

Since its release, &quot;On Avery Island&quot; continued to receive positive reviews. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic described &quot;On Avery Island&quot; as &quot;a fuzzy masterpiece of experimental lo-fi recording.&quot; &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; noted that despite the production limitations and underdeveloped lyrics, the album succeeds in blending multiple genres into a unique sound. Sasha Geffen of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; highlighted the songs &quot;You&#x27;ve Passed&quot; and &quot;Gardenhead / Leave Me Alone&quot; as some of the best songs in Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s discography, and wrote: &quot;The abrupt transitions between perfect pop melodies and gaseous balls of noise lend the album a certain wildfire charm.&quot;

Retrospective reviews often compare &quot;On Avery Island&quot; to Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s second album &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; Michael Hann felt &quot;On Avery Island&quot; was the weaker of the two albums, and wrote: &quot;You can hear Mangum groping towards the realisation of his vision on the likes of &#x27;Song Against Sex&#x27; or &#x27;A Baby for Pree,&#x27; but never quite finding it.&quot; Chris Morgan of &quot;Uproxx&quot; echoed this remark, and noted that &quot;On Avery Island&quot; is quieter and less ambitious than its successor. Some critics believe &quot;On Avery Island&quot; cacophonous sound and abstract lyrics served as a blueprint for &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;. Geffen wrote: &quot;[&quot;On Avery Island&quot;] offers a glimpse of a pivotal songwriter in transition, moving from making shoddy cassettes for his friends to making art rock that spoke to untold thousands of lonely teens listening to pilfered mp3s late into the night.&quot;

In 1998, Neutral Milk Hotel disbanded, and Mangum disappeared from the public eye. Fans were not told why the band disbanded, and the subsequent speculation from online discussions significantly raised their profile. Neutral Milk Hotel and, in particular, &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; gained a cult following and converted Mangum into a larger-than-life figure. Some journalists have commented that due to the popularity of &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;, other recordings from Neutral Milk Hotel, such as &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, are often overlooked. Morgan highlighted the discrepancy between the two albums by comparing their Wikipedia articles from 2016. Morgan noted that &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; article was deemed important enough to include a section titled &quot;Legacy&quot;, whereas the entire &quot;On Avery Island&quot; article merely consisted of a few sentences.

<text>Prince of Wales Island (Tlingit: Taan) is one of the islands of the Alexander Archipelago in the Alaska Panhandle. It is the fourth-largest island in the United States (after Hawaii, Kodiak Island, and Puerto Rico) and the 97th-largest island in the world.

==Geography and ecology==
Prince of Wales Island is located in the Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area. It measures long by wide, with an area of , or about one-tenth the size of Ireland (or slightly larger than the state of Delaware). Approximately 6,000 people live on the island. Craig is the largest community; founded as a saltery in the early 20th century, it has a population of 1,500 people. Some 900 more live in Klawock, a long-established village that grew with the boom of the fishing industry. Hollis was a boom-and-bust mining town, most active from 1900 to about 1915. Abandoned, it was re-established as a logging camp in the 1950s; it now has a population of about 100, and is the location of a ferry terminal.

Mountains (all but the tallest of which were buried by Pleistocene glaciation) reach over . Fjords, steep-sided and forested mountains, and dense stands of trees characterize the terrain on the island. Extensive tracts of limestone include karst features, such as El Capitan Pit (at high), which is possibly the deepest vertical shaft in the United States.

Moist, maritime conditions dominate the weather, with marine layer and fog being regular occurrences.

The Tongass National Forest covers most of the island. Parts of the forest, and the island itself, encompass the Karta River Wilderness and the South Prince of Wales Wilderness. Many of the native species, such as the Prince of Wales flying squirrel (&quot;Glaucomys sabrinus griseifrons&quot;) and Prince of Wales Island ermine (&quot;Mustela haidarum celenda&quot;) are found nowhere else. Other terrestrial mammalian species include the American black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;) and grizzly bear (&quot;U. arctos terribilis&quot;), black-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis&quot;), beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;), gray wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), marten (both &quot;Martes americana&quot; and &quot;M. caurina&quot;), mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), moose (&quot;A. alces&quot;), mountain goat (&quot;Oreamnos americanus&quot;), porcupine (&quot;Erithizon dorstatum&quot;), red squirrel (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;), river otter (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;), among others. The waters surrounding the island are home to many marine species, such as Dall&#x27;s (&quot;Phocoenoides dalli&quot;) and harbor porpoises (&quot;P. phocoena&quot;), harbor seal (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;), humpback whale (&quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;), orca (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;), Pacific white-side dolphin (&quot;Sagmatias obliquidens&quot;), sea otter (&quot;Enhydra lutris&quot;) and Steller sea lion (&quot;Eumetopias jubatus&quot;), to name a few.

==History==
Prince of Wales Island is the homeland of the indigenous Tlingit people. Tlingit word , which translates to &quot;crabapple country&quot;. The Tlingit name for the island is , meaning &quot;sea lion&quot;. The island is traditional Tlingit territory. The Haida migrated into the area in the late 18th century. Abandoned Haida villages still have Tlingit names. 

In 1741, Aleksei Chirikov, commanding a ship on Vitus Bering&#x27;s second voyage of exploration out of Kamchatka, made the first recorded European landfall on the northwest coast of North America at Baker Island off the west coast of Prince of Wales Island. He did not stop for any length of time there. The next European arrival was in 1774, when Juan Pérez led a Spanish expedition sailing in a boat from La Paz, Mexico (then a Spanish colony). They reached Sumez Island off of Prince of Wales&#x27; west coast.

In 1779 a British expedition under Captain James Cook passed Prince of Wales Island. Comte de La Perouse led a French expedition to the area in 1786. Karta Bay is the site of the first salmon saltery in Alaska.

On September 20, 1793, British navy officer George Vancouver gave the name &quot;Prince of Wales Archipelago&quot; to all the islands of the southern Alexander Archipelago, which he suspected to have a single major island; the name referred to George, Prince of Wales, who would later become King George IV. By 1825 the name &quot;Prince of Wales Island&quot; was being used for the largest of the islands in Vancouver&#x27;s archipelago.

Settlers began mining of gold, copper, and other metals on the island in the late 19th century, as European Americans entered the area to exploit the natural resources. Gold production came from underground lode mines exploiting: gold-bearing quartz veins in metamorphic rocks (such as the Gold Standard, Sea Level, Dawson, Golden Fleece and Goldstream mines); skarns (at the Jumbo and Kassan Peninsula copper-gold mines); zoned mafic-ultramafic plutons, as at the Salt Chuck silver-gold-copper-PGE mine; and VMS deposits such as Niblack. Uranium was mined at Bokan Mountain in the 1950s and 1970s.

==Economy==

===Logging===
Historically, logging was the mainstay of the collective Prince of Wales economy through most of the 20th century. The decline of the industry since the late 20th century has resulted in only a few small-scale sawmills operating. In 1975, the Point Baker Association and others sued the United States Forest Service to prevent logging on the northern portion of the island.

In December 1975, Judge von der Heydt issued a ruling enjoining all clearcutting on the on Northern Prince of Wales Island west of a line from the west side of Red Bay to the easternmost point of Calder Bay. In March 1976, the United States Congress responded to the suit by passing the National Forest Management Act, which removed the injunction. Still, only half of the marketable timber was cut on the north end of the island.

Road construction and logging on the north end of the island at Labouchere Bay commenced early in 1975. Living on a floating camp beginning with the retired tugboat Irene leased as a floating hotel, employees of Robertson &amp; Sons began cutting trees, clearing stumps, and blasting rock in order to build pads for mobile trailers for both the road construction and logging families. The camps were ready in early June for Robertson employees to bring in their families. Under the supervision of the US Forest Service, logging began in 1976.

In 2010, Senators Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich introduced S730 to privatize stands of old growth forests on the island.

===Tourism===
Tourism, including sport fishing, is an important part in Prince of Wales&#x27; economy. Two factors have led to the increase of tourism on the island. Roads built for the logging companies years ago have enabled better access to different parts of the island for hiking and camping. The second was the new Inter-Island Ferry Authority.

===Fishing===
Commercial fishing provides the foundation of the economy for numerous towns on the island including Craig, Klawock, Hydaburg, Port Protection and Point Baker. During the summer, trollers and seiners both fish for all five species of Pacific salmon. Longliners bring up halibut and black cod. Dungeness crab and shrimp seasons are open throughout the year. During the winter there are dive fisheries for geoducks, sea cucumbers, and sea urchins.

===Government===
Since Prince of Wales Island is almost entirely made up of federal land, the two ranger districts (Craig and Thorne Bay) on the island provide employment for a number of residents.

===Mining===
Mineral exploration continues at many projects on Prince of Wales Island. The only producing uranium mine in the entire state of Alaska was located on the island, the Ross-Adams mine in Kendrick Bay. Current remediation projects have been reported in local media, and continued exploration of rare earth metals continue in the region. Bokan Mountain has been rated by the Technology Metals report as a location (tied with Canada&#x27;s Strange Lake) containing the third highest of &quot;relative&quot; quantity of individual critical rare earth oxides, a way of comparing rare earth mine reserves. In 2012 the Pentagon issued a contract to perform a mineralogical and metallurgical study of the mountain. &quot;The Bokan – Dotson ridge REE&quot; rare earth deposit on Bokan Mountain owned by Ucore is estimated to hold of heavy rare earths with dysprosium. It is a small deposit on a global basis but the largest in the United States. , the mine was still in the planning stages. Ucore Rare Metals Inc. paid about $1 million for a claim to the family of a prospector who held uranium claims for many years on Bokan Mountain.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
A road system, which taxpayers paid for in credits to logging contractors, was built on the island. However, many of these roads are now being decommissioned as unnecessary in the post-clearcutting era. Only a small percentage of this road system is paved, currently no further than the Whale Pass turn-off. The gravel roads cost between 150,000 and 500,000 per mile in today&#x27;s dollars. Point Baker and Port Protection chose in 1974 not to be connected to the road system.

There is now a newly designated state &quot;scenic highway&quot;—the Prince of Wales Island road system. The highway reaches almost every community on Prince of Wales.

===Cargo===
A few companies provide scheduled barge service from Pacific coast ports to southeastern Alaskan ports, including those on Prince of Wales island, primarily Craig and Thorne Bay.

===Public ferry===
====Alaska Marine Highway System====
Historically, the Alaska Marine Highway (AMHS) intermittently served the port of Hollis, until the Inter-Island Ferry Authority began regular scheduled service.

====Inter-Island Ferry Authority====
The Inter-Island Ferry Authority (IFA) provides daily service on a three-hour, route between Prince of Wales Island and Ketchikan. The idea of starting a shuttle ferry service was discussed among communities of Klawock, Craig, Thorne Bay, Coffman Cove on the Prince of Wales Island as well as Petersburg and Wrangell in 1997, which would serve on regular timetable. Budget was fixed with the Alaska Congressional delegation as the state Department of Transportation supported the plan to be organized under the Municipal Port Authority Act of Alaska in 1998, and two vessels introduced between 2002 and 2006 have expanded routes from Hollis–Ketchikan to serve north by Clark Bay.

It ferries more than 50,000 passengers and 12,000 vehicles between Hollis and Ketchikan annually. The system is more than a form of transportation - it is an economic engine for southern Southeast Alaska, generating jobs, commerce, and tourism - while also increasing community well-being. In 2015, the IFA brought 3,000 tourists to Prince of Wales Island, where they spent more than $10 million on hotels, fishing expeditions, and dining - generating hundreds of summer jobs across the island. It provides a means for the seafood industry to move millions of pounds of high-quality, high-value fresh and live seafood to market, creating hundreds more jobs. It provides access to health care for a thousand island residents who use Ketchikan&#x27;s medical services without the cost, inconvenience, or weather-related delays of flying. It shuttles workers to their jobs, reinforcing Ketchikan&#x27;s status as the regional economic hub; Prince of Wales residents spent more than $14 million there in 2015 on groceries, goods, services, and medical care.

The Inter-Island Ferry allows for cultural and social commerce as well. Students, tribal members, and other residents use the system to participate in basketball games, totem pole raisings, trainings, college fairs, celebrations, and funerals. There were 3,100 student trips last year. This allowed students from 13 different Alaska school districts the opportunity to challenge themselves and interact with their peers. It connects residents to family, friends, and recreation.

The ferry is a critical piece of a more extensive transportation network. It provides transportation security on days when the skies are rough, and access to transportation to those who cannot afford alternative means. Nearly a quarter of the ridership last year were senior citizens and young children, who have saved a combined $17 million over the cost of flying since the system began in 2002. Its reliable arrivals and departures - so precise that people are said to set their watches by it - have enabled organizations to build their business models around this daily transportation connection. The result of the IFA&#x27;s efficient operations is farebox revenue that covers a full 85% of the ferry&#x27;s operational costs, a significant rate in the world of public transportation. The word businesses and residents most frequently use to describe the ferry service is &quot;invaluable&quot;. While there are many intrinsic values of the system that cannot be measured, an analysis of the ferry&#x27;s economic impact in the seafood, healthcare, visitor, transportation, and retail sectors shows an impressive $52.2 million combined impact in Ketchikan and Prince of Wales in 2015.

===Airports===
Klawock Airport is the only airport on Prince of Wales Island. At least two commercial airlines in Ketchikan provide scheduled service to Prince of Wales Island. Air taxi or chartered flights are also available from them and other airlines.

<text>Morticia Addams (née Frump) is a fictional character from the &quot;Addams Family&quot; multimedia franchise created by American Charles Addams in 1933. She plays the role of the family&#x27;s reserved matriarch. Morticia Addams has been portrayed by several actresses in various &quot;Addams Family&quot; media, including Carolyn Jones in the television series &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1964–1966), Anjelica Huston in the feature films &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991) and &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993), and Catherine Zeta-Jones in the streaming television series &quot;Wednesday&quot; (2022).

==Cartoons==
Morticia first appeared in Charles Addams&#x27;s newspaper cartoons as the stern, aloof matriarch of the family. She often appeared with the rest of the family, and was, along with Gomez and Grandmama, one of the few members to actually speak in the cartoons.

== Background ==

Morticia is the wife of Gomez Addams and mother of Wednesday, Pugsley and Pubert Addams. The character originated in the Charles Addams cartoons for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine in the 1930s. In the cartoons, none of the family members had names. When the characters were adapted to the 1964 television series, Charles Addams&#x27;s selection of her name was inspired by &quot;mortician&quot;. Morticia&#x27;s maiden name is &quot;Frump&quot; and she has an older sister named Ophelia (also played by Carolyn Jones in the original TV series). In the television series, her mother is Hester Frump (played by Margaret Hamilton). Her mother-in-law is Grandmama Addams. In the 1990s Addams Family films, familial relationships are changed for the characters of Grandmama and Fester. Grandmama is actually Morticia&#x27;s mother, not Gomez&#x27;s, while Fester is Gomez&#x27;s brother, not Morticia&#x27;s uncle.

Morticia is slim, with extremely pale skin and long flowing straight black hair. She commonly wears black hobble dresses to match her hair, tightly form fitting, with a fringe of octopus-like cloth &quot;tentacles&quot; at the lower hem. According to Wednesday, Morticia applies baking powder to her face instead of actual makeup. In each episode, she easily allures her husband Gomez by speaking French (or any other foreign language for that matter). Morticia is musically inclined, and is often seen freely strumming a Japanese shamisen. She frequently enjoys cutting the buds off of roses, which she discards (keeping only the stems), likes cutting out paper dolls with three heads and making sweaters with three arms, collecting the mail from the hand-in-the-box Thing, and cooking unusual concoctions for her husband, including eye of newt. Her personal pet is Cleopatra, a fictitious breed of carnivorous plant called an African Strangler, to which she feeds hamburgers and various other meats.

She is described as a witch. In one episode, she wears a black pointed hat. Her family tree can be traced back to Salem, Massachusetts, and witchcraft is also implied at times in the television series. For example, Morticia likes to &quot;smoke,&quot; an activity that does not involve cigarettes or cigars (such as her husband frequently enjoys), but smoke instead emanates directly from her.

In 2009, she was included in Yahoo!&#x27;s Top 10 TV Moms from Six Decades of Television for the time period 1964–1966. AOL named her one of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.

== In other media ==
Morticia was portrayed by Carolyn Jones in the TV series, and &quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot; TV movie. According to the 60s TV series, Morticia is descended from Salem, Massachusetts (&quot;The Addams Family Tree&quot;, episode 5, season 1). In the season II 2-parter episodes, &quot;Morticia&#x27;s Romance&quot; (Parts I &amp; II), Morticia first met Gomez when she (then 22 years old) and her elder sister, Ophelia, were brought to the Addams&#x27; Mansion by their mother, Mrs. Esther Frump, a long-time close friend of Gomez&#x27;s mother, from their time together at &quot;Swamp Town High&quot;, both of whom wished for the then around 22 year old Gomez and Ophelia to marry. Before this episode, however, different allusions as to how Morticia and Gomez first met and fell in love are made; in &quot;Green-Eyed Gomez&quot;, it&#x27;s mentioned that Gomez first fell in love with Morticia when he first saw her riding &quot;sidesaddle on a buffalo&quot; and she, likewise, when he carved her initials on his leg; in &quot;Morticia the Matchmaker&quot;, Grandmama mentions that her &quot;Love Dust&quot; (which she uses in multiple doses on Morticia&#x27;s cousin, Melancholia) was used to initially bring Morticia and Gomez together. 

Jones also voiced the character in an episode of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; that featured the family: &quot;Wednesday Is Missing&quot;. 

Anjelica Huston portrays Morticia in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; and its sequel &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;. Huston&#x27;s portrayal of Morticia was always illuminated by a ghostly glow around the eyes, which became most noticeable when she was standing or lying in dim light (just like Bela Lugosi in 1931&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;). According to the 1991 movie, Morticia first met Gomez when she was attending his cousin Balthazar&#x27;s funeral (and Gomez was the main suspect); Morticia and Gomez could not keep their eyes off each other and, according to Gomez, everyone hardly paid Balthazar any attention as he was buried, and Gomez proposed to Morticia later that very night.

Daryl Hannah played Morticia in the 1998 film &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot;.

Canadian actress Ellie Harvie played Morticia in the 1998-1999 revival series, &quot;The New Addams Family&quot;.

In the first animated series made in 1973, Morticia was voiced by Janet Waldo.

In the 1992 animated series, she was voiced by Nancy Linari.

In the 2010 Broadway musical, Morticia was portrayed by Bebe Neuwirth. Brooke Shields replaced her in the role on June 28, 2011.

Morticia was also one of the inspirations for the Disney character Magica De Spell, first designed and drawn by Carl Barks for the Donald Duck universe. Natasha Fatale, a villain from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons, was also based on Morticia&#x27;s design.

Morticia is voiced by Charlize Theron in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (2019). Theron reprised her role in the sequel, which was released on October 1, 2021.

Catherine Zeta-Jones portrays Morticia in the Netflix series &quot;Wednesday&quot;. According to the 2022 series, both she and Gomez first met at Nevermore Academy, a boarding school for supernatural people (also known as &quot;Outcasts&quot;). Her maiden name from the 60s TV series, &quot;Frump&quot;, was kept. It is revealed in flashbacks that she and Gomez were involved in the death of &quot;normie&quot; Garrett Gates, who tried to kill Gomez in a blind rage, desiring Morticia for himself. The future Principal, Larissa Weems, was her roommate and very jealous of Morticia, due to her many achievements. Morticia&#x27;s supernatural ability is receiving psychic visions of the past or future, just like Wednesday, and is hereditary on both sides of the family, since both Gomez and Morticia share a mutual ancestor in Goody Addams, from the 1600s. Morticia tells her daughter that the mood and tone of their visions are based on the recipient&#x27;s attitude, so hers tend to be happier in nature than Wednesday&#x27;s. Morticia also warns Wednesday to be careful of their distant ancestor, Goody Addams, whom Morticia describes as a &quot;witch of great strength&quot;, as she let her thirst for vengeance consume her.

<text>Tandag, officially the City of Tandag (Tandaganon/Surigaonon: &quot;Siyudad nan Tandag&quot;; Cebuano: &quot;Dakbayan sa Tandag&quot;; ), is a component city and capital of the province of Surigao del Sur, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 62,669 people.

Farming and fishing are the main economic activity for most of the people in Tandag. The chief farm products are rice, corn, and coconut. Livestock- and poultry-raising are also important sources of income. Tandag has a national secondary airport and a seaport.

Tandag has a land area of 291.73 square kilometers or 112.64 square miles. This constitutes 5.91% of the land area of Surigao del Sur. The population density of the city is at 193 inhabitants per square kilometer or 500 inhabitants per square mile.

==Etymology==
Many versions have been given regarding the name of Tandag. One version states that Father Calan, Father Encarnacion, and another priest were on their way to visit chieftain Suba to baptize his people. When one of the missionaries asked a native rowing their boat what name of the place was with fingers pointing downward, the native thought the priest meant the school of fish. He answered &quot;tamda&quot;, meaning &#x27;look down&#x27;. This name later became &quot;Tandag&quot;. Father Encarnacion, a member of the group, was later killed by the natives.

Another version states that when Spanish-Peruvian historian and explorer Inca Garcilaso de la Vega landed in Tandag to subdue the ferocious Caragas (as the rebellious natives were called then), he did not know the name of the place so he inquired from a native who was gathering the leaves of an herb locally known as tanglad. The native, who did not understand Spanish, answered &quot;tangad&quot;. Later the name was changed to &quot;Tandag&quot;.

One more account tells of a group of Spanish soldiers and missionaries who lost their way around the settlement. When they asked for correct directions, the natives, who could not understand Spanish, merely laughed at them, continually saying the word &quot;tarantados&quot;, meaning &#x27;lost&#x27;. Thus, the name &quot;Tandag&quot;&#x27; meant lost.

== History ==

Long before Tandag became what it is today—the bustling capital town of Surigao del Sur was inhabited by the Manobos and the Mamanwas who lived along the river banks under the leadership of Suba, their Chieftain. Suba was later converted into Christianity by Father Juan de la Encarnacion, a Spanish missionary. After Legazpi’s final conquest to the Philippines in 1609, the Spanish government sent missionaries accompanied by platoons of guardia civil to subdue the hostile natives. One of these missionaries was Father Juan de la Vega who was assigned in Tandag. In an effort to establish a symbol of authority, Fr. dela Vega erected a stone fort and built a small settlement about a size of a football field enclosed by a stone wall. Out of this settlement rose the town of Tandag, which later on became a center of faith.

During this period Tandag became a port-of-call for the Spanish galleons that sailed along the southern part of Mindanao. It is still believed that somewhere underneath the sea near Tandag&#x27;s Linungao Islands lies a sunken galleon ship.

After the Spanish missionaries&#x27; visit to Tandag, a group of Italian explorers and soldiers then landed in the city. They did what the Spanish did, but mandated that Italian be one of the city&#x27;s primary language aside from Surigaonon, Cebuano, and Filipino. Strict compliance was enforced during those times, which explains why Italian became Tandag&#x27;s local dialect aside from the mainstay Surigaonon.

In 1650, Tandag became the capital town of Surigao or Caraga, then a district that covered the present provinces of Agusan del Sur, Agusan del Norte, Surigao del Sur, Surigao del Norte, and a part of Davao. As the center of faith and capital town, Tandag was fortified with cottas which were erected sometime in the 18th century. The cottas were placed in the northern part of the town and near the old cemetery on the western side. These fortifications served to protect the town from Moro raids.

In several separate attacks between 1754 and 1767, the Moro pirates wrought havoc and destruction to Tandag. Father Jose Ducos, a Jesuit from Iligan, came to the rescue and rebuilt Tandag. He established the Tandag Garrison and restored the Tandag priory. Although a part of the Tandag fort survived, it was demolished during the Second World War. Calamities like typhoons and earthquakes destroyed what remained of it. This explains why there are no remains of these structures that could be seen today.

During World War II, for much of the war Tandag was free from the Japanese occupation that followed the American and Filipino military forces&#x27; surrender in May 1942. However, on April 27, 1944, about 500 Japanese troops landed by a number of boats a short distance outside town. Most of the residents fled to the mountains nearby when the Japanese arrived. The 10th Military District of the U.S. Army maintained a guerrilla presence in Mindanao in World War II. Capt. Charles Hansen led a small group of guerrillas against the Japanese. Outnumbered, the guerrillas were unable to dislodge the Japanese and about ten days later another group of guerrillas made a second attempt to force the Japanese out. The Japanese remained in town several weeks and left after causing much damage in Tandag.

Real transformation was finally afforded to Tandag via Republic Act No. 2786, an act that created Surigao del Sur and whose salient measure made Tandag the capital and seat of the provincial government of Surigao del Sur.

===Cityhood===
On June 23, 2007, Tandag, by virtue of Republic Act No. 9392, became a city.

The Supreme Court declared the cityhood law of Tandag and 15 other cities unconstitutional after a petition filed by the League of Cities of the Philippines in its ruling on November 18, 2008. On December 22, 2009, the cityhood law of Tandag and 15 other municipalities regain its status as cities again after the court reversed its ruling on November 18, 2008. On August 23, 2010, the court reinstated its ruling on November 18, 2008, causing Tandag and 15 cities to become regular municipalities. Finally, on February 15, 2011, Tandag becomes a city again including the 15 municipalities declaring that the conversion to cityhood met all legal requirements.

After six years of legal battle, in its board resolution, the League of Cities of the Philippines acknowledged and recognized the cityhood of Tandag and 15 other cities.

<text>Russell Lee is the pseudonym of the Singaporean authors of &quot;True Singapore Ghost Stories&quot;, a well-known book series of ghost stories in Singapore, Malaysia, other parts of Asia ever since the release of Book 1 in 1989.

The brand had a lasting impact on Singapore publishing. Their first release was the first of many that were published for the mass market. True Singapore Ghost Stories surpassed 30,000 copies in three months.

Despite publicly claiming to be a real person, Russell Lee never provided any photograph of himself nor revealed any information about his personal life. At book signing events for True Singapore Ghost Stories, a person claiming to be Russell Lee would always show up, wearing a mask and clothes that cover every inch of his body. Due to the improbability of not having any leaked details about his identity for decades, the universal consensus is that Russell Lee is a pseudonym, and an actor was hired to put on a mask and make public appearances for marketing purposes.

As of 2003, the village had an estimated population of 2,994 and a density of 25.05 persons per km2. The total area was 119.50 km2.

On March 20, 2006, Nangō, along with town of Tajima, and the villages of Ina and Tateiwa (all from Minamiaizu District), was merged to create the town of Minamiaizu.

Nangō is famous throughout Fukushima for its tomatoes.

Nangō is one of many rural areas in Japan that suffers from the problem of having a large aged population but relatively few young people. As of March 2006, there were more people aged 90 and above than people between the ages of 20 and 24 living in Nangō.

Nangō&#x27;s ski and snowboard area attracts people from as far south as Tokyo. It is home to ski courses of varying difficulty, but known best for its large snowboard park.

<text>HMS &quot;A4&quot; was an early Royal Navy submarine.

She was a member of the first British of submarines. Like all her class, she was built at Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness.

==Service history==
&quot;A4&quot; suffered a serious accident, although without casualties, on 16 October 1905 during an underwater signalling experiment off Spithead.

A bell had been lowered into the water from a dinghy some distance away from the submarine was being used to signal to the submarine, which was running awash. A flag on a boat hook protruding through a ventilator which had been left open was used to indicate that the signal had been heard. The experiment had been performed successfully on the previous day, but the sea was much rougher on 16 October and consequently the submarine stayed inside the breakwater.

The same trim settings had been used as on the previous day, but as there was fresh water flowing into the harbour, the water was less dense and so the submarine was less buoyant than on the previous day.

Seawater flooded through the ventilator causing the boat to develop a 40 degree inclination on the bow and dive to and also partially filling her with chlorine gas when it came in contact with the battery acid. The crew managed to blow the ballast tanks to surface the boat and evacuate onto the deck, but there was an explosion whilst she was being towed back to port and she slowly sank. The boat was salvaged and repaired. The captain of the submarine at the time, Lieutenant Martin Nasmith, was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his command of during the Dardanelles campaign in 1915.

During the First World War she was used for training at Portsmouth, and was sold for scrap on 16 January 1920.

<doc id="877417" wikidata="Q7389249" url="?curid=877417" title="SCO–SGI code dispute of 2003">
<text>During its SCO Forum conference of 2003, the SCO Group (SCO) showed several examples of allegedly illegal copying of copyrighted code into Linux. The open source software community quickly debunked most of them. One example showed some Unix code within some of SGI&#x27;s Linux contributions. The Linux maintainers stated that this code had already been removed from Linux before the example had been revealed — not because it was infringing, but because it had needlessly duplicated some functions already present in Linux. SGI and other analysts also confirmed that the code had never infringed.

==Background==
During SCO Forum, on August 17–19, 2003 at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, SCO publicly showed several alleged examples of illegal copying of copyrighted code in Linux. Until then, these examples had only been available under NDA, which had prohibited them from communicating about it. SCO claimed the infringements are divided into four separate categories: literal copying, obfuscation, derivative works, and non-literal transfers.

The example used by SCO to demonstrate literal copying is also known as the &quot;atemalloc&quot; example. The name of the original contributor was not revealed by SCO, but quick analysis pointed to SGI. It was also revealed that the code had already been removed from the Linux kernel, because it duplicated existing functions.

Within hours, the open source community started several different analyses of the infringing code. The results of these analyses differ slightly, but they all confirm that it was derived from Unix code. These analyses also pointed out that while the code could possibly have originated in Unix, this does not necessarily prove infringement of copyrights.

The community was determined that this was a particularly bad example, because the code in question had never been used in the mainstream distributions of Linux, and had been present only in the IA-64 version. The relative sparseness of worldwide IA-64 installations, combined with the limited time in which the code was present in Linux, makes the chance of actually encountering a system running this code very slim.

==Origin==
It is possible that the code contributed to Linux originated from UNIX System V, but its original implementation happened in the early 1970s. There are no substantial differences between the original Unix source code and the UNIX System V source. Dennis Ritchie, one of the creators of Unix, acknowledged that either he or Ken Thompson wrote the original code from which the UNIX System V code is derived:

This is very important, because early Unix source code does not have any copyright claim. At that time, the law required explicit copyright claims, which effectively means the early Unix code is not protected by copyright law. Additionally, both Santa Cruz Operation and The SCO Group released the source code of early versions of Unix under a 4-clause BSD-like license, allowing its use in other open source products.

==SGI response==
On October 1, 2003, SGI responded to SCO&#x27;s allegations in an open letter to the Linux community. In it, Rich Altmaier, vice president of software, claims that these small code fragments were inadvertently included in the Linux kernel:

<text>Psychonauts is a 2005 platform game developed by Double Fine Productions and published by Majesco Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2.

Set in a retro-futuristic version of the 1980s, &quot;Psychonauts&quot; follows Razputin (Raz), a young boy gifted with psychic abilities, who runs away from a circus to try to sneak into a summer camp for those with similar powers to become a &quot;Psychonaut&quot;, a spy with psychic abilities. He finds that there is a sinister plot occurring at the camp that only he can stop. The game is centered on exploring the strange and imaginative minds of various characters that Raz encounters as a Psychonaut-in-training/&quot;Psycadet&quot; to help them overcome their fears or memories of their past, so as to gain their help and progress in the game. Raz gains use of several psychic abilities during the game that are used for both attacking foes and solving puzzles.

&quot;Psychonauts&quot; was based on an abandoned concept that studio founder Tim Schafer had during his previous development of &quot;Full Throttle&quot;. The game was initially backed by Microsoft&#x27;s Ed Fries as a premiere title for the original Xbox console, but several internal and external issues led to difficulties for Double Fine in meeting various milestones and responding to testing feedback. Following Fries&#x27; departure in 2004, Microsoft dropped the publishing rights, making the game&#x27;s future unclear. Double Fine was able to secure Majesco as a publisher a few months later allowing them to complete the game after four and a half years of development.

The game was well received, but publisher Majesco encountered severe financial loss after the game&#x27;s release and departed from the video game market&quot;. Psychonauts&quot; has earned a number of industry awards and gained a cult following. It has since been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. In 2011, Double Fine acquired the rights for the title, allowing the company to republish the title through digital distribution with updates for modern gaming systems and ports for Mac OS X and Linux. Double Fine reported that their own sales of the game have far exceeded what was initially sold on its original release, with cumulative sales of nearly 1.7 million . A sequel, &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot;, was announced at The Game Awards in December 2015 and was released on August 25, 2021.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Psychonauts&quot; is a platform game that incorporates various adventure elements. The player controls the main character Raz in a third-person, three-dimensional view, helping Raz to uncover a mystery at the Psychonauts training camp. Raz begins with basic movement abilities such as running and jumping, but as the game progresses, Razputin gains additional psychic powers such as telekinesis, levitation, invisibility, and pyrokinesis. These abilities allow the player to explore more of the camp as well as fight off enemies. These powers can be awarded either by completing certain story missions, gaining psi ranks during the game, or purchasing them with hidden arrowheads scattered around the camp. Powers can be improved — such as more damaging pyrokinesis or longer periods of invisibility — through gaining additional psi ranks. The player can assign three of these powers to their controller or keyboard for quick use, but all earned powers are available at any time through a selection screen.

The game includes both the &quot;real world&quot; of the camp and its surroundings, as well as a number of &quot;mental worlds&quot; which exist in the consciousness of the game&#x27;s various characters. The mental worlds have wildly differing art and level design aesthetics, but generally have a specific goal that Raz must complete to help resolve a psychological issue a character may have, allowing the game&#x27;s plot to progress. Within the mental worlds are censors that react negatively to Raz&#x27;s presence, and attack him. There are also various collectibles within the mental worlds, including &quot;figments&quot; of the character&#x27;s imagination which help increase Razputin&#x27;s psi ranking, &quot;emotional baggage&quot; which can be sorted by finding tags and bringing them to the baggage, and &quot;memory vaults&quot; which can unlock a short series of slides providing extra information on that character&#x27;s backstory. Most of these worlds culminate in a boss battle that fully resolves the character&#x27;s emotional distress and advance the story. The player is able to revisit any of these worlds after completing them to locate any additional collectibles they may have missed. Razputin is given some items early in the game, one that allows him to leave any mental world at any time, and another that can provide hints about what to do next or how to defeat certain enemies.

Raz can take damage from psychically empowered creatures around the camp at night, or by censors in the mental worlds; due to a curse placed on his family, Raz is also vulnerable to water. If Raz&#x27;s health is drained, he is respawned at the most-recent checkpoint. However, this can only be done so many times while Raz is within a mental world, indicated by the number of remaining astral projections; if these are expended through respawning, Raz is ejected from the character&#x27;s mind and must re-enter to make another attempt. Health and additional projections can be collected throughout the levels, or purchased at the camp store.

==Plot==

===Setting===
The story is set in the fictional Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, a remote US government training facility under the guise of a children&#x27;s summer camp. Centuries ago the area was hit by a meteor made of psitanium (a fictional mineral that can grant psychic powers or strengthen existing powers), creating a huge crater. The psitanium affected the local wildlife, giving them limited psychic powers, such as bears with the ability to attack with telekinetic claws, cougars with pyrokinesis, and rats with confusion gas. The Native Americans of the area called psitanium &quot;whispering rock&quot;, which they used to build arrowheads.

When settlers began inhabiting the region, the psychoactive properties of the meteor slowly drove them insane. An asylum named Thorny Towers Home of the Disturbed was built to house the afflicted, but within fifteen years, the asylum had more residents than the town did and the founder Houston Thorny committed suicide by throwing himself from the asylum&#x27;s tower. The government relocated the remaining inhabitants and flooded the crater to prevent further settlement, creating what is now Lake Oblongata. The asylum still stands, but has fallen into disrepair.

The government took advantage of the psitanium deposit to set up a training camp for Psychonauts, a group of agents gifted with psychic abilities used to help defeat evil-doers. The training ground is disguised as a summer camp for young children, but in reality helps the children to hone their abilities and to train them to be Psychonauts themselves. Due to this, only those recruited by the Psychonauts are allowed into the camp.

===Characters===
The protagonist and playable character of the game is Razputin Aquato (or Raz for short) (voice actor Richard Horvitz), the son of a family of circus performers, who runs away from the circus to become a Psychonaut, despite his father Augustus&#x27; wishes. His family is cursed to die in water, and a watery hand called the Hand of Galochio attempts to submerge Raz whenever he approaches any significantly deep water.

When at camp, Raz meets four of the Psychonauts that run the camp: the cool and calculating Sasha Nein (voice actor Stephen Stanton), the fun-loving Milla Vodello (voice actress Alexis Lezin), the regimental Agent/Coach Morceau Oleander (voice actor Nick Jameson), and the aged, Mark Twainesque Ford Cruller (voice actor David Kaye), said by Razputin to have been the greatest leader the Psychonauts ever had, until a past psychic duel shattered Ford&#x27;s psyche and left him with dissociative identity disorder.

Only when he is near the large concentration of Psitanium does his psyche come together enough to form his real personality. During his time at camp, Raz meets several of the other gifted children including Lili Zanotto (voice actress Nicki Rapp), the daughter of the Grand Head of the Psychonauts, who falls in love with him at first sight (which he eventually reciprocates); and Dogen Boole (voice actress Nika Futterman), the grandson of one of the Psychonaut&#x27;s founders who can communicate with animals and goes around with a tin foil hat to prevent his abilities from causing anyone&#x27;s head to explode.

Raz also meets the residents of the insane asylum including ex-dentist and brain surgeon Dr. Caligosto Loboto; as well as Boyd Cooper, a former security guard that holds a number of government conspiracy theories about a person known as &quot;the Milkman&quot;; Fred Bonaparte, an asylum orderly struggling control over his mind by a hallucination of his ancestor, Napoleon Bonaparte; Gloria Van Gouton, a former actress driven insane by a family tragedy; Edgar Teglee, a painter whose girlfriend cheated on him; and Linda, the gigantic lungfish that brings campers to the asylum.

===Story===
Razputin, having fled from the circus, tries to sneak into the camp, but is caught by the Psychonauts. They agree to let him stay until his parents arrive, but refuse to let him take part in any activities. However, they do allow him to take part in Coach Oleander&#x27;s &quot;Basic Braining&quot; course, which he easily passes. Impressed, Agent Nein invites Raz to take part in an experiment to determine the extent of his abilities.

During the experiment, Raz comes across a vision of Dr. Loboto, an insane ex-dentist, extracting Dogen&#x27;s brain, but is unable to intervene. Raz eventually realizes that the vision is true after finding Dogen without his brain, but the Psychonauts refuse to believe him.

After receiving additional training from Agent Vodello, Raz learns that Dr. Loboto is working on behalf of Coach Oleander, who intends to harvest the campers&#x27; brains to power an army of psychic death tanks. Lili is soon abducted as well, and with both Agents Nein and Vodello missing, Raz takes it upon himself to infiltrate the abandoned Thorny Towers Home of the Disturbed insane asylum where she was taken. Agent Cruller gives him a piece of bacon which he can use to contact Agent Cruller at any time, and tasks him with retrieving the stolen brains so that he can return them to the campers.

Raz frees the mutated lungfish Linda from Coach Oleander&#x27;s control, and she takes him safely across the lake. At the asylum, Raz helps the inmates overcome their illnesses, and they help him access the upper levels of the asylum, where Loboto has set up his lab. He frees Lili and restores Agents Nein and Vodello&#x27;s minds, allowing them to confront Coach Oleander. The inmates subsequently burn down the asylum, allowing Coach Oleander to transfer his brain to a giant tank. Raz defeats him, but when he approaches the tank, it releases a cloud of sneezing powder, causing him to sneeze his brain out.

Raz uses his telekinesis to place his brain inside the tank, merging it with Oleander&#x27;s. Inside, Raz discovers that Coach Oleander&#x27;s evil springs from his childhood fear of his father, who ran a butcher shop. At the same time, Raz&#x27;s own father appears and the two dads join forces. However, he turns out to be an imposter, with Raz&#x27;s real father, Augustus, appearing and using his own psychic abilities to fix his son&#x27;s tangled mind and beat the personal demons. At the camp&#x27;s closing ceremony, Agent Cruller presents him with a uniform and welcomes him into the Psychonauts. Raz prepares to leave camp with his father, but word arrives that the Grand Head of the Psychonauts—Lili&#x27;s father, Truman Zanotto—has been captured. Thus Raz and the Psychonauts fly off on their new mission.

==Development==
&quot;Psychonauts&quot; was the debut title for Double Fine Productions, a development studio that Tim Schafer founded after leaving LucasArts following their decision to exit the point-and-click adventure game market. Schafer&#x27;s initial studio hires included several others that worked alongside him on &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;.

The backstory for &quot;Psychonauts&quot; was originally conceived during the development of &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, where Tim Schafer envisioned a sequence where the protagonist Ben goes under a peyote-induced psychedelic experience. While this was eventually ejected from the original game (for not being family friendly enough), Schafer kept the idea and eventually developed it into &quot;Psychonauts&quot;.

While still working at LucasArts, Tim Schafer decided to use the name &quot;Raz&quot; for a main character because he liked the nickname of the LucasArts animator, Razmig &quot;Raz&quot; Mavlian. When Mavlian joined Double Fine, there was increased confusion between the character and the animator. The game&#x27;s associate producer, Camilla Fossen, suggested the name &quot;Rasputin&quot;. As a compromise, Double Fine&#x27;s lawyer suggested the trademarkable name &quot;Razputin&quot;, which was used for the game.

Most of the game&#x27;s dialog and script was written by Schafer and Erik Wolpaw, who at the time was a columnist for the website Old Man Murray. After establishing the game&#x27;s main characters, Schafer undertook his own exercise to write out how the characters would see themselves and the other characters&#x27; on a social media site similar to Friendster, which Schafer was a fan of at the time and from where he met his wife-to-be.

This helped him to solidify the characters in his own head prior to writing the game&#x27;s dialog, as well as providing a means of introducing the characters to the rest of the development team. To help flesh out character dialog outside of cut scenes, Schafer developed an approach that used dozens of spoken lines by a character that could be stitched together in a random manner by the game as to reduce apparent repetition; such stitching included elements like vocal pauses and coughs that made the dialog sound more natural. Schafer used the camp and woods setting as a natural place that children would want to wander and explore.
The game&#x27;s mental worlds were generally a result of an idea presented by Schafer to the team, fleshed out through concept art and gameplay concepts around the idea, and then executed into the game with the asset and gameplay developers, so each world had its own unique identity. One of the game&#x27;s most famous levels is &quot;The Milkman Conspiracy&quot;, which takes place in the mind of Boyd, one of the patients at the mental hospital who is obsessed with conspiracy theories. Schafer had been interested in knowing what went on inside the minds of those that believed in conspiracy theories, inspired by watching &quot;Capricorn One&quot; as a child.

During a Double Fine dinner event, someone had uttered the line &quot;I am the milkman, my milk is delicious.&quot;, which led Schafer to create the idea of Boyd, a milkman bent on conspiracy theories. Schafer then worked out a web of conspiracy theories, wanting the level to be a maze-like structure around those, tying that in to Boyd&#x27;s backstory as a person who had been fired from many different jobs, partially inspired by a homeless person that Double Fine occasionally paid to help clean their office front. Schaefer had wanted the 1950s suburban vibe to the level as it would fit in with the spy theme from the same period. Artist Scott Campbell fleshed out these ideas, along with the featureless G-men modeled after the &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; characters.

Peter Chan came up with the idea of vaulting the suburban setting into vertical spaces as to create a maze-like effect, which inspired the level designers and gameplay developers to create a level where the local gravity would change for Raz, thus allowing him to move across the warped setting that was created. The level&#x27;s unique gameplay aspect, where Raz would need to give specific G-men a proper object as in point-and-click adventure games, was from gameplay developer Erik Robson as a means to take advantage of the inventory feature that they had given Raz. Schafer had wanted Wolpaw to write the lines for the G-men, but as he was too busy, Schafer ended up writing these himself.
The art design crew included background artist Peter Chan and cartoonist Scott Campbell. Voice actor Richard Steven Horvitz, best known for his portrayal of Zim in the cult favorite animated series &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, provides the voice of Raz, the game&#x27;s protagonist. Initially the team tried to bring in children to provide the voices for the main cast, similar to &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoons, but struggled with their lack of acting experience.

Schafer had selected Horvitz based on his audition tapes and ability to provide a wide range of vocal intonations on the spot, providing them with numerous takes to work with. Raz was originally conceived as an ostrich suffering from mental imbalance and multiple personalities. Tim Schafer killed the idea because he strongly believes in games being &quot;wish fulfillments,&quot; guessing that not many people fantasize about being an insane ostrich.

Double Fine created a number of internal tools and processes to help with the development of the game, as outlined by executive producer Caroline Esmurdoc. With the focus of the game on Raz as the playable character within a platform game, the team created the &quot;Raz Action Status Meeting&quot; (RASM). These were held bi-weekly with each meeting focusing on one specific movement or action that Raz had, reviewing how the character controlled and the visual feedback from that so that the overall combination of moves felt appropriate. With extensive use of the Lua scripting language, they created their own internal Lua Debugger nicknamed Dougie, after a homeless man near their offices they had befriended, that helped to normalize their debugging processes and enable third-party tools to interact with the name.

With a large number of planned cutscenes, Double Fine took the time to create a cutscene editor so that the scriptwriters could work directly with the models and environments already created by the programmers without requiring the programmer&#x27;s direct participation. For level design, though they had initially relied on the idea of simply placing various triggers throughout a level to create an event, the resulting Lua code was large and bulky with potential for future error.

They assigned eight of the game programmers to assist the level developers to trim this code, and instituted an internal testing department to overlook the stability of the whole game which had grown beyond what they could do internally. Initially this was formed from unpaid volunteers they solicited on Double Fine&#x27;s web site, but following the signing of the Majesco publication deal in 2004, they were able to commit full-time staff to this team.

===Production and publishing difficulties===
Esmurdoc described the development of &quot;Psychonauts&quot; as difficult due to various setbacks, compounded by the new studio&#x27;s lack of experience in how to manage those setbacks. The game&#x27;s initial development began in 2001 during the dot-com boom. Due to the cost of office space at that time, Double Fine had established an office in an inexpensive warehouse in San Francisco that initially fit their development needs.

By 2003, they had come to realize the area they were in was not safe or readily accommodating, slowing down their development. With the collapse of the dot-com bubble, they were able to secure better office space, though this further delayed production. Schafer was also handling many of the duties for both the studio and the development of the game. Though some of the routine business tasks were offloaded to other studio heads, Schafer brought Esmurdoc onto the project in 2004 to help produce the game while he could focus on the creative side.

The intent to allow all developers to have artistic freedom with the game created some internal strife in the team, particularly in the level design; they had initially scoped that level designers would create the basic parts of a level - main paths, scripted events, and the level&#x27;s general design, while the artists would build out the world from that. As development progressed, they determined that the artists should be the ones constructing the level geometry, which the level designers resented.

Subsequently, levels that were generated were not to the expected standards due to conflicts in the toolsets they used and Schafer&#x27;s inability to oversee the process while handling the other duties of the studio. In 2003, the decision was made to dismiss all but one of the level design team, and unify the level design and art into a World Building team overseen by Erik Robson, the remaining level designer and who would go on to become the game&#x27;s lead designer; the change, which Esmurdoc stated was for the better, disrupted the other departments at Double Fine.

&quot;Psychonauts&quot; was to be published by Microsoft for release exclusively on their Xbox console; Schafer attributes this to Microsoft&#x27;s Ed Fries, who at the time of &quot;Psychonauts&quot;″s initial development in 2001, was looking to develop a portfolio of games for the new console system. Schafer believes that Fries was a proponent of &quot;pushing games as art&quot;, which helped to solidify Double Fine&#x27;s concept of &quot;Psychonauts&quot; as an appropriate title for the console after the team&#x27;s collected experience of developing for personal computers.

However, according to Esmurdoc, Microsoft had also created some milestones that were unclear or difficult to meet, which delayed the development process. She also believes that their own lack of a clear vision of the ultimate product made it difficult to solidify a development and release schedule for the game as well as created confusion with the publisher. Schafer stated that Microsoft also found some of their gameplay decisions to be confusing based on play-testing and requested them to include more instructional information, a common approach for games during the early 2000s, while Schafer and his team felt such confusion was simply the nature of the adventure-based platform that they were developing.

Double Fine was also resistant to make changes that Microsoft had suggested from play-testing, such as making the humor secondary to the story, removing the summer camp theme, and drastically altering the story. Fries departed Microsoft in January 2004; shortly thereafter, the company soon pulled the publishing deal for &quot;Psychonauts&quot;.

Esmurdoc said that Microsoft&#x27;s management considered Double Fine to be &quot;expensive and late&quot;, which she agreed had been true but did not reflect on the progress they had been making at this point. Schafer also noted that at the time of Microsoft&#x27;s cancellation that they were planning on transitioning to the Xbox 360 and were not funding any further development of games that would not be released after 2004; even though Schafer had set an approximate release date in the first quarter of 2005 by this point, Microsoft still opted to cancel.

Following this, Schafer and Esmurdoc worked to secure a new publishing deal while using internal funds and careful management to keep the project going. One source of funds that helped keep the company operational came from Will Wright, who had recently sold his company Maxis to Electronic Arts. Prevented from investing into Double Fine by the Maxis deal, he instead provided Double Fine a loan of funds that kept them afloat over the next several months. Wright is credited for this support within the game.

By August 2004, Double Fine had negotiated a new publishing deal with Majesco Entertainment to release the game on Windows as well as the Xbox. Tim Schafer was quoted as saying &quot;Together we are going to make what could conservatively be called the greatest game of all time ever, and I think that&#x27;s awesome.&quot;

Though the publishing deal ensured they would be able to continue the development, Esmurdoc stated they had to forgo plans for hiring new developers to meet the scope of the game as agreed to with Majesco. Subsequently, the studio entered, as described by Esmurdoc, &quot;the most insane crunch I have ever witnessed&quot; in order to complete the game. This was compounded when Majesco announced a PlayStation 2 port to be developed by Budcat Creations in October 2004, which further stretched the availability of Double Fine&#x27;s staff resources. The game went gold in March 2005; Esmurdoc attributes much of the success of this on the solidarity of the development team that kept working towards this point.

Esmurdoc stated that &quot;Psychonauts&quot; took about 4.5 years to complete — though that without all the complications the real development time was closer to 2 years — with a team of 42 full-time developers and additional contractors, with a final budget of $11.5 million.

===Music===
The soundtrack to &quot;Psychonauts&quot; was composed by Peter McConnell, known for his work on LucasArts titles such as &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; and &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;. Schafer&#x27;s familiarity with McConnell, having worked with him on numerous projects in the past, led Schafer to select him for the soundtrack composition. The &quot;Psychonauts Original Soundtrack&quot;, featuring all the in-game music, was released in 2005. The following year, in late 2006, Double Fine released a second soundtrack, &quot;Psychonauts Original Cinematic Score&quot;, containing music from the game&#x27;s cutscenes as well as a remix of the main theme and credits.

==Release==
The final U.S. release date for the game on Xbox and Windows was April 19, 2005, with the PlayStation 2 port following on June 21, 2005. &quot;Psychonauts&quot; was re-released via Valve&#x27;s Steam digital distribution platform on October 11, 2006. Although initially unplayable on the Xbox 360, Tim Schafer spearheaded a successful e-mail campaign by fans which led to &quot;Psychonauts&quot; being added to the Xbox 360 backwards compatible list on December 12, 2006,
and on December 4, 2007, Microsoft made &quot;Psychonauts&quot; one of the initial launch titles made available for direct download on the Xbox 360 through their Xbox Originals program.

===Acquisition of rights and republishing===
In June 2011, the original publishing deal with Majesco expired, and full publication rights for the game reverted to Double Fine. When Majesco&#x27;s rights expired, the game was temporarily removed from the service in August 2011, as Microsoft does not allow unpublished content on its Xbox Live Marketplace. Schafer worked with Microsoft to gain their help in publishing the title under the Microsoft Studios name, and the game returned to the Marketplace in February 2012.

In September 2011, Double Fine released an updated version for Microsoft Windows and a port to Mac OS X and Linux through Steam. The new version provided support for Steam features including achievements and cloud saving. The Mac OS X port was developed in partnership with Steven Dengler&#x27;s Dracogen. In conjunction with this release, an iOS application, &quot;Psychonauts Vault Viewer!&quot;, was released at the same time, featuring the memory vaults from the game with commentary by Tim Schafer and Scott Campbell. The game was added to the PlayStation Network store as a &quot;PS2 Classic&quot; for the PlayStation 3 in August 2012. As part of a deal with Nordic Games, who gained the rights to &quot;Costume Quest&quot; and &quot;Stacking&quot; after THQ&#x27;s bankruptcy, Double Fine took over publishing rights for both games, while Nordic published and distribute retail copies of all three games for Windows and Mac OS X systems. Double Fine offered &quot;Psychonauts&quot; as part of a Humble Bundle in June 2012. In 2016, Double Fine also released &quot;Psychonauts&quot; as a classic title for use with the PlayStation 4&#x27;s emulation software.

==Reception==
&quot;Psychonauts&quot; received positive reception, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Schafer and Wolpaw&#x27;s comedic writing was highly praised, as well as the uniqueness and quirks that the individual characters were given. Alex Navarro of GameSpot commented favorably on the &quot;bizarre&quot; cast of characters, their conversations that the player can overhear while exploring the camp, and how these conversations will change as the story progresses, eliminating repetition that is typical of such non-player characters in platform games. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer found that he was incentivized to go back and explore or experiment in the game&#x27;s level to find more of the comedic dialog that others had observed. The game was also noted for its innovations, such as the use of a second-person perspective during a boss battle.

The game&#x27;s art and level design (in particular, the designs of the various mental worlds that Raz visits) were well-received Jason Hill of the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; stated that each of the dream worlds &quot;is a memorable journey through the bizarre inner psyche&quot; of the associated character. Two particular levels have been considered iconic of the game&#x27;s humor and style: the aforementioned Milkman Conspiracy, and Lungfishopolis, where Raz enters the mind of a lungfish monster that lives near camp; in the lungfish&#x27;s mind Raz is portrayed as a giant monster akin to Godzilla that is attacking the tiny lungfish citizens of Lungfishopolis, effectively creating an absurd role reversal of the typical giant monster formula.

The overall game structure has been a point of criticism. Some reviewers identified that the first several hours of the game are focused on tutorials and instruction, and are less interesting than the later mental worlds. The game&#x27;s final level, the &quot;Meat Circus&quot;, was also considered unexpectedly difficult when compared to earlier sections of the game, featuring a time limit and many obstacles that required an unusual level of precision. On its re-release in 2011, Double Fine adjusted the difficulty of this level to address these complaints. Some found that the game&#x27;s humor started to wane or become predictable in the latter part of the game.

GamingOnLinux reviewer Hamish Paul Wilson gave the game 8/10, praising the game&#x27;s creativity and presentation, but also criticizing several other areas of the game, including the large number of unaddressed bugs. Wilson concluded that &quot;&quot;Psychonauts&quot; has to be viewed as a flawed masterpiece&quot;. In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;.

===Awards===
*E3 2005 Game Critics Awards: Best Original Game
*British Academy Video Games Awards 2006: Best Screenplay

The editors of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; presented &quot;Psychonauts&quot; with their 2005 awards for &quot;Best Art Direction&quot; and &quot;Best Writing&quot;, and named it the year&#x27;s tenth-best computer game. They called the game &quot;a wonderfully weird journey high on atmosphere, art direction, and creativity.&quot; &quot;Psychonauts&quot; won &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s 2005 &quot;Best Game You Didn&#x27;t Play&quot; award. The editors wrote, &quot;Okay, look, we gave it an Editors&#x27; Choice award — that&#x27;s your cue to &quot;run out right now&quot; and buy Tim Schafer&#x27;s magnificent action/adventure game. So far, only about 12,000 PC gamers have.&quot; It was also a nominee for the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Game of the Year 2005&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;. During the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Psychonauts&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Design&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. &quot;Psychonauts&quot; won the award for Best Writing at the 6th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards.

===Sales===
&quot;Psychonauts&quot; did not reach publisher Majesco&#x27;s retail sale expectations. Although the game was first cited as the primary contributing factor to a strong quarter immediately following its launch, a month later Majesco revised their fiscal year projections from a net profit of $18 million to a net loss of $18 million, and at the same time its CEO, Carl Yankowski, announced his immediate resignation. By the end of the year, the title had shipped fewer than 100,000 copies in North America, and Majesco announced its plans to withdraw from the &quot;big budget console game marketplace&quot;. Schafer stated that by March 2012 the retail version &quot;Psychonauts&quot; had sold 400,000 copies.

Following Double Fine&#x27;s acquisition of the rights, they were able to offer the game on more digital storefronts and expand to other platforms; as previously described, this allowed the company to achieve sales in a short term far in excess of what they had been prior to obtaining the rights. In the announcement for &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot; in December 2015, Schafer indicated that &quot;Psychonauts&quot; sold nearly 1.7 million copies, with more than 1.2 million occurring after Double Fine&#x27;s acquisition of the rights. Double Fine lists 736,119 sold copies via the Humble Bundle (including a Steam key), 430,141 copies via the Steam storefront, 32,000 GOG.com copies, and 23,368 Humble Store copies. On Humble Bundle, the game sold well, with Schafer stating that they sold more copies of &quot;Psychonauts&quot; in the first few hours of the Bundle&#x27;s start than they had since the release of the retail copy of the game. Later in 2012, Schafer commented that their ability to use digital venues such as Steam that &quot;[Double Fine] made more on Psychonauts this year than we ever have before&quot;.

==Legacy==

===Sequels===

A sequel to &quot;Psychonauts&quot; has been of great interest to Schafer, as well as to fans of the game and the gaming press. Schafer had pitched the idea to publishers but most felt the game too strange to take up. During the Kickstarter campaign for Double Fine&#x27;s &quot;Broken Age&quot; in February 2012, Schafer commented on the development costs of a sequel over social media, leading to a potential interest in backing by Markus Persson, at the time the owner of Mojang. Though Persson ultimately did not fund this, interactions between him and Double Fine revealed the possibility of several interested investors to help.

In mid-2015, Schafer along with other industry leaders launched Fig, a crowd-sourced platform for video games that included the option for accredited investors to invest in the offered campaigns. Later, at the 2015 Game Awards in December, Schafer announced their plans to work on &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot;, using Fig to raise the $3.3 million needed to complete the game, with an anticipated release in 2018. The campaign succeeded on January 6, 2016. The sequel was released on August 25, 2021 and sees the return of Richard Horvitz and Nikki Rapp as the voices of Raz and Lili respectively, along with Wolpaw for writing, Chan and Campbell for art, and McConnell for music.

Additionally, Double Fine has developed a VR title called &quot;Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin&quot; for use on Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR. Released in 2017, it serves as a standalone chapter to tie the original game and its sequel, based on Raz and the other Psychonauts rescuing Truman Zanotto. Psychonauts 2 was released on August 25, 2021.

===Appearance in other media===
The character Raz has made appearances in other Double Fine games, including as a massive Mount Rushmore-like mountain sculpture in &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;, and on a cardboard cutout within &quot;Costume Quest 2&quot;. Raz also appeared in a downloadable content package as a playable character for &quot;Bit.Trip Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien&quot;. A cameo of Raz appears in &quot;&quot; which can be found at the Red Queen&#x27;s castle as a propped-up skeleton that bears a striking resemblance to the protagonist itself. There is also a hidden symbol of Raz in &quot;A Hat in Time&quot; which can be found using one of the hat abilities in a certain part of Chapters 3 Act 4.

<text>Jonas Kyratzes is a German-Greek video game designer and author of video game industry related articles.

==Career==
Kyratzes&#x27; games are known for breaking with convention and being heavily story-driven. Several of his games are thematically interconnected, often by the recurring figure of Urizen (first mentioned in &quot;The Great Machine&quot;) and other themes related to or inspired by the work of William Blake. With his wife, he created The Lands of Dream, a setting for many games, a book, and stories (see Stories below) he and his wife created.

He also has an interest in film, and in January 2009 he wrote and directed a short documentary about the 2008 Greek riots called &quot;The Greek Riots: Some Basic Facts&quot;.

Jonas was born in Germany to a Greek father and a German mother, and raised in Greece. He has written several articles on video games, often advocating the concept that games are an art form.

<doc id="877431" wikidata="Q6141924" url="?curid=877431" title="Joaquín Andújar">
<text>Joaquín Andújar (; December 21, 1952 – September 8, 2015) was a Dominican professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, St. Louis Cardinals, and Oakland Athletics from 1976 through 1988. Andújar was a four-time MLB All-Star and a Gold Glove Award winner.

==Early years==
Andújar signed with the Cincinnati Reds in , one month shy of his 17th birthday. He posted a 33–41 record with a 4.33 earned run average over six seasons in the Reds&#x27; farm system. Following the season, he was dealt to the Houston Astros for two players to be named later (on December 12, 1975, the Reds received reliever Luis Sanchez and third baseman and catcher Carlos Alfonso).

==Playing career==

=== Houston Astros (1976–1981) ===
Andújar made his Major League debut in the season opener against his former franchise. After two relief appearances against the Reds, he was moved into the starting rotation. On July 11 and July 17, Andújar pitched consecutive 1–0 shutouts against the Montreal Expos and New York Mets. For the season, he went 9–10 with a 3.60 ERA.

Andújar was 10–5 with a 3.47 ERA at the All-Star break, and he was named the Astros&#x27; sole representative in the All-Star game. However, he injured himself in his final start before the game and could not play. He did not return to his team until September and finished the season 11–8 with a 3.69 ERA.

Andújar began seeing more work out of the bullpen in and earned his first career save on August 25 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He began the season in the bullpen and was 4–2 with a 3.23 ERA with three saves and two blown saves when he was added back to the starting rotation. He responded with four consecutive complete game victories in which he gave up just one earned run per game. He was named to his second National League All-Star team and pitched two innings while giving up two runs (one earned). On August 14, he pitched a four-hit complete game against the Montreal Expos while hitting an inside-the-park home run to account for both of the Astros&#x27; runs in a 2–1 win.

While splitting time between starting and relieving, he went 3–8 in . The Astros won a one-game playoff against the Los Angeles Dodgers, which resulted in Andújar making his first postseason appearance. He recorded a save in Game Two of the 1980 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Andújar was the first player to have a postseason save for the Astros and he was the only one to do so until 2004.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1981–1985)===
====1981–1984====
After starting the season at 2–3 with a 4.88 ERA, Andújar was acquired by the St. Louis Cardinals from the Astros for Tony Scott on June 6, 1981, just before the players&#x27; strike. MLB.com Cardinals beat writer Jenifer Langosch wrote in 2013 that it was one of the five best in-season trades in franchise history.

He returned to a starting role with the Cardinals and responded by going 6–1 for the rest of the 1981 season. In , he pitched a career high innings. He won his last 7 decisions and had a 1.64 ERA down the stretch to finish the season at 15–10. He pitched a three-hit shutout of the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans Stadium on September 15 that put his team games up on the Phillies in the National League East, a lead they held for the remainder of the season.

The Cardinals swept the Atlanta Braves in the 1982 National League Championship Series, with Andújar starting and winning Game 3. He started two games in the 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, winning both with a 1.35 ERA. He was taken off the field during Game 3 after he was hit in the leg by a line drive. St. Louis manager Whitey Herzog later said that he thought Andújar had been killed by the batted ball, but Andújar recovered in time to start Game 7.

Andújar had a career year in , going 13–6 with a 2.90 ERA at the All-Star break to earn his third All-Star selection (though he was unable to attend). He ended the season at 20–14 with a 3.34 ERA; he led the league in wins, innings pitched (261.1), and shutouts (four) while winning the Gold Glove Award at pitcher. In 1982 and 1984, he led the Cardinals in wins, ERA, games started, complete games, innings pitched, shutouts, and strikeouts.

====1985====
Andújar got off to a 12–1 start in , and made his fourth All-Star team. The Cardinals and New York Mets became embroiled in a heated battle for the NL East crown that came down to the wire. Andújar went 3–1 with a 4.29 ERA against the Mets that season. A 5–2 loss on October 2 against Dwight Gooden allowed the Mets to pull within a game of the Cardinals. This loss became perhaps the most memorable game Andújar pitched in the rivalry that developed between the two clubs. The Cardinals won the following day and ended up taking the division by three games over the Mets. Andújar ended the season at 21–12 with a 3.40 ERA. In the 1985 National League Championship Series, he was ineffective in his Game 2 start against the Los Angeles Dodgers, which put the Cardinals in a two-game hole. St. Louis came back to win the following four games, which paved the Cardinals&#x27; way to the World Series. (Andújar started the decisive Game 6 of the NLCS but did not figure into the decision.)

Between 1982 and 1985, Andújar averaged more than 36 games started per season. A major league pitcher has not had more than 36 starts in one season since Greg Maddux started 37 games in 1991.

====1985 World Series====
The World Series against the Kansas City Royals went poorly for Andújar. He lasted 4+ innings in Game 3 and took the loss opposite a dominant Bret Saberhagen. John Tudor, meanwhile, was 3–1 with a 1.59 ERA that postseason, leading Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog to go with Tudor in the decisive Game 7, despite the fact that Andújar had five days&#x27; rest. The strategy failed, and Tudor was pulled in the third with the bases loaded and three runs already on the board. The score was 10–0 by the time Herzog brought Andújar in for mop-up duty. When umpire Don Denkinger called a ball, Andújar emphatically showed his disagreement and had to be restrained by teammates. Herzog was furious and was ejected. A pitch later, Andújar was ejected for arguing another pitch which was clearly off the plate. Andújar charged Denkinger, bumping the umpire before being restrained by teammates.

Herzog&#x27;s decision to send in Andújar—normally a starter—led to speculation that his decision was payback for Denkinger&#x27;s infamous call in Game 6, but Herzog had stated that Andújar was the only Cardinal pitcher that still had any life left in his arm, as the Cardinals had gone through seven pitchers in the game.

Andújar was so furious after being ejected from Game 7 that he demolished a toilet and sink in the visitor&#x27;s clubhouse bathroom in Royals Stadium with a bat. As a result of this and his conduct toward Denkinger, Andújar was fined $500—the maximum permissible amount at the time—and was suspended for the first 10 games of the following regular season. Andújar was additionally ordered to make restitution for damages.

===Oakland Athletics (1986–1987)===
Andújar was traded from the Cardinals to the Oakland Athletics for Mike Heath and Tim Conroy during the Winter Meetings on December 10, 1985. Herzog denied that the transaction had anything to do with Andújar winning only one game after August 23 or what transpired during the World Series. Cardinals general manager Dal Maxvill said that the team needed a catcher after releasing Darrell Porter and having only a barely tested Tom Nieto on its depth chart.

Andújar was to begin the season serving a ten-game suspension (later reduced to five) for the World Series feud with Denkinger. Also, on February 28, 1986, Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth handed down season-long suspensions to Andújar—who police say dealt drugs to then-Cardinals teammate Lonnie Smith in 1982—and six other players, including Smith, who had admitted to cocaine abuse during the Pittsburgh drug trials. The suspensions were reduced to anti-drug donations and community service.

As luck would have it, Denkinger was the home plate umpire for Andújar&#x27;s first start of 1986. His first start of the season was uneventful as Andújar lasted just 4+ innings while giving up 6 earned runs. Despite his lackluster start to the season, Andújar had a decent year in 1986, going 12–7 with a 3.82 ERA. He suffered numerous injuries along the way, including an injury sustained during batting practice.

Injuries limited Andújar to 13 starts in . His last start was on August 3, and he lasted just two-thirds of an inning, giving up 3 runs.

===Final season===
Andújar returned to the Astros in 1988 and was slated to work from the Astros&#x27; bullpen; however, because of injuries in the starting rotation, Andújar made some mid-season starts. He ended the season at 2–5 with a 4.00 ERA.

He earned a 5–0 record in the Senior Professional Baseball Association (SPBA) in late . When he was signed by the Montreal Expos on December 11, he became the first SPBA player to sign with an MLB club. He was released by the Expos the following March.

==After baseball==
After retiring from baseball, Andújar started a trucking business in the Dominican Republic. In 2012, Andújar was inducted into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame. He died at his home on September 8, 2015, in San Pedro de Macorís, from complications of diabetes.

<text>Anthony Keeling Collett (22 August 1877 – 22 August 1929) was an author and writer on natural history subjects and was nature correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; during the 1910s and 1920s.

Collett&#x27;s father was the Reverend William Collett, a former fellow of Oriel College, Oxford. He was born at Cromhall, Gloucestershire, where his father held the living that was dispensed by Oriel College, and was educated privately at Crowthorne and then at Bradfield College before being awarded a scholarship to study classics at Oriel. After graduating he was awarded a college scholarship that enabled him to spend some time at the University of Berlin.

Collett began work as a journalist for the &quot;St. James&#x27;s Gazette&quot; in London, where he wrote on many subjects. From 1908, he also contributed to &quot;The Times&quot;, although not as a staff member until after World War I. He enlisted in the Post Office Rifles for that war, initially as a private and later as a commissioned officer. After fighting at Vimy Ridge, Collett, who was in any case generally not a particularly healthy man, was invalided home and served the rest of the war working in the War Office.

He was not enamoured of London and regularly lived and produced his writings from other places, including in the Italian Alps, Scotland and Wales. During the war, he had managed occasionally to write articles while in France. He died in a London nursing home on 22 August 1929, on his 52nd birthday, having suffered a significant decline in his already poor health in the previous two years. That decline may have been related to his war service.

Collett retained an affection for Bradfield College and was a governor there for many years.

W. H. Auden used many phrases from Collett&#x27;s &quot;Changing Face of England&quot; in his poems.

The Chase, a woodland in Woolton Hill, was dedicated to the memory of Collett (according to a plaque on the site) when the land was presented to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in 1944 by Sir Kenneth Swan as a nature reserve and bird sanctuary.

==Bibliography==
Among Collett&#x27;s publications are:

*&quot;A Handbook of British Inland Birds&quot; (1906)
*&quot;The English Year&quot; (three volumes, co-authored with William Beach Thomas; T. C. &amp; E. C. Jack, 1913–14)
*&quot;Birds Through The Year&quot; (co-authored with William Beach Thomas; T. C. &amp; E. C. Jack, 1922)
*&quot;The Changing Year&quot; (undated)
*&quot;The Changing Face of England&quot; (1926)
*&quot;The Heart of a Bird&quot; (1927)

<doc id="877441" wikidata="Q724143" url="?curid=877441" title="General Motors LS-based small-block engine">
<text>The General Motors LS-based small-block engines are a family of V8 and offshoot V6 engines designed and manufactured by the American automotive company General Motors. Introduced in 1997, the family is a continuation of the earlier first- and second-generation Chevrolet small-block engine, of which over 100 million have been produced altogether and is also considered one of the most popular V8 engines ever. The LS family spans the third, fourth, and fifth generations of the small-block engines, with a sixth generation expected to enter production soon. Various small-block V8s were and still are available as crate engines.

The &quot;LS&quot; nomenclature originally came from the Regular Production Option (RPO) code LS1, assigned to the first engine in the Gen III engine series. The LS nickname has since been used to refer generally to all Gen III and IV engines, but that practice can be misleading, since not all engine RPO codes in those generations begin with LS. Likewise, although Gen V engines are generally referred to as &quot;LT&quot; small-blocks after the RPO LT1 first version, GM also used other two-letter RPO codes in the Gen V series. 

The LS1 was first fitted in the Chevrolet Corvette (C5), and LS or LT engines have powered every generation of the Corvette since (with the exception of the Z06 variant of the eighth generation Corvette, which is powered by the unrelated Chevrolet Gemini small-block engine). Various other General Motors automobiles have been powered by LS- and LT-based engines, including sports cars such as the Chevrolet Camaro/Pontiac Firebird and Holden Commodore, trucks such as the Chevrolet Silverado, and SUVs such as the Cadillac Escalade.

A clean-sheet design, the only shared components between the Gen III engines and the first two generations of the Chevrolet small-block engine are the connecting rod bearings and valve lifters. However, the Gen III and Gen IV engines were designed with modularity in mind, and several engines of the two generations share a large number of interchangeable parts. Gen V engines do not share as much with the previous two, although the engine block is carried over, along with the connecting rods. The serviceability and parts availability for various Gen III and Gen IV engines have made them a popular choice for engine swaps in the car enthusiast and hot rodding community; this is known colloquially as an LS swap. These engines also enjoy a high degree of aftermarket support due to their popularity and affordability.

== Background ==
The brainchild of Chevrolet chief engineer Ed Cole, the first generation of the Chevrolet small-block engine was first unveiled in the 1955 Chevrolet Corvette and Chevrolet Bel Air, both powered by the &quot;Turbo-Fire.&quot; The 265 Turbo-Fire distinguished itself from other engines of the era such as Cadillac&#x27;s 331 series of the late 1940s and early 1950s by reducing the size and weight of various components within the engine; a compact engine block combined with a light valvetrain gave the Turbo-Fire a weight reduction compared to the inline-sixes (despite having two more cylinders) that initially powered the first generation of the Corvette, alongside a significant horsepower increase of 25%. This contributed to lowering the Corvette&#x27;s from 11 seconds to 8.7.

Nicknamed the &quot;Mighty Mouse,&quot; the Turbo-Fire soon became popular within the hot rodding community too, along with scoring wins in stock car racing. A larger version of the Turbo-Fire arrived in 1957, now bored out to . This gave the new engine a total displacement of ; this newer version was dubbed the &quot;Super Turbo-Fire.&quot; The Super Turbo-Fire was also the first engine offered with mechanical fuel injection. The top-of-the-line model produced , giving it a 1:1 cubic inch to horsepower ratio; this lowered the Corvette&#x27;s to 7.2 seconds.

General Motors would produce more powerful and larger displacement iterations of the small-block, until stringent emission regulations in the late 1960s severely limited performance. The Malaise era (roughly 1973 to 1983), as it was known, saw some of the lowest horsepower figures in several muscle and or pony car engines. This included the Corvette whose power output dropped below despite a displacement of .

1992 saw the second generation of Chevrolet small-block hit the market in that year&#x27;s Chevrolet Corvette in the form of the LT1 small-block. It featured a new ignition system, reverse-flow cooling (cooling the cylinder heads first), and new engine block, but the valvetrain and engine mounts were carried over in order to maintain a degree of compatibility with the previous generation. Other modifications such as a better flowing intake manifold and cylinder heads gave the LT1 a power output of . The second generation culminated in the LT4 small-block, which gained a minor power increase of . Other changes included a lighter valvetrain and strengthened crankshaft.

The decision to stick with pushrod technology was seen as archaic at the time; such engines were seen as outdated compared to the smaller capacity (but more powerful and fuel efficient) overhead cam engines favored by European and Asian manufacturers. One of GM&#x27;s domestic rivals, Ford, had announced plans to axe its small block engine from production in the early 1990s, in favor of its Modular engines. Another domestic rival, Chrysler Corporation, had stopped building passenger cars with V8 engines years prior, relegating them to its trucks and SUVs. Many car enthusiasts also desired a dual overhead cam engine; GM in response had developed the Northstar engines for Cadillac, but those engines were initially exclusive to that brand and not originally designed for rear-wheel-drive vehicles. Later on, Sam Winegarden, former General Motors chief engineer for small-blocks, stated that despite the stigma of the pushrod engine being &quot;a symbol of the uncompetitiveness [sic] of the domestic industry,&quot; the decision to stick with pushrods was made on the basis that switching to overhead camshafts was unnecessary. The power requirements for the Corvette were satisfied by simply increasing engine displacement. Current General Motors chief engineer for small-blocks Jake Lee also stated that switching to overhead camshafts would also increase the height of the engine by , rendering it too tall to fit under the hood of the Corvette.

Approval for the Gen III was granted in May 1992, after a seat-of-the-pants decision made by General Motors executives who went for a drive in two Corvettes—one equipped with a traditional pushrod engine and one with a newer dual overhead camshaft engine. Tom Stephens, then-executive director of General Motors Powertrains, was the man in charge of the project. Stephens had the task of designing an engine that was not only more powerful than the previous small-block iterations, but one that could also deliver better fuel economy and meet emissions standards. Work began in 1993, shortly after the release of the LT1 Gen II engine. A small team hand-picked from the Advanced Engineering department of General Motors was assembled to do much of the initial design work, with initial prototypes hitting test benches by the winter of 1993. Stephens also recruited Ed Koerner, a former NHRA record holder, to help with much of the hands-on work, while Stephens dealt with corporate.

== Design ==
All three generations are overhead valve engines, otherwise known as pushrod engines. Overhead valve engines have the valves mounted above the cylinder head, with a pushrod and rocker arm allowing the camshaft (which is mounted inside the block) to open and close the valves. The advantages of an engine configuration like this (as opposed to an overhead camshaft engine) is that since the camshaft is located within the engine valley, a pushrod engine will be shorter in height compared an overhead camshaft engine. Another advantage is that there are fewer mechanical components such as timing chains and extra camshafts, which increases reliability by keeping the engine simple.

All three generations were outfitted with either aluminum or cast iron engine blocks, with all passenger car engine blocks being aluminum, whereas truck engine blocks could be either material. Every single engine was also fitted with aluminum cylinder heads, except for the 1999 and 2000 model year of the LQ4, which were cast iron. Other modifications to the cylinder heads included a redesign to include significantly better airflow, with evenly spaced exhaust and intake valves. A deeper engine skirt meant that the third and following generations were slightly larger than its predecessors; the deeper skirts strengthened the block and improved rigidity. A deep engine skirt refers to an engine block which extends below the centerline position of the crankshaft within the engine. Another feature across all generations was the bore spacing and pushrods, the former of which is also in use in the Chevrolet Gemini small-block engine. The use of aluminum allowed for further weight reduction; the 1997 LS1 was almost lighter than previous cast-iron small-block iterations. GM also made extensive use of economies of scale for the LS: with the exception of the 4.8L and 7.0L engines, all variants used the same 3.622&quot; stroke (with most of those variants using the same basic crankshaft casting), the 4.8L and 5.3L variants utilized the same block casting, and several variants used the same length connecting rod.

Other modifications include long runner intake manifolds, powder-forged connecting rods and the introduction of six-bolt main bearings (as opposed to four on the previous generations). Long runner intake manifolds in the LS series increases the airflow into the cylinders at low revolutions, increasing torque production at lower revolutions. Truck applications of the LS engine have even longer intake manifolds, being approximately taller than passenger car manifolds. Most engines were also fitted with hypereutectic pistons, replacing the previous cast pistons which were weaker and less thermally stable.

Powder-forging involves sintering a specific mixture of metals and non-metals which have been compressed in a forming press. The mixture is then quickly transferred into a traditional die cavity in a forging press and is pressed once then cooled. Powder-forging is also more cost-effective compared to traditional die forging, reducing the amount of tooling required to trim inconsistencies in hot-forged connecting rods. Stronger than the forged steel connecting rods of the previous two generations, powder-forged connecting rods have been fitted to every LS and LT engine except for the LS7.

==Generation III (1997–2007)==
The Generation III small-block V8 is a &quot;clean sheet&quot; General Motors design produced from 1997 to 2007, which replaced the Chevrolet Generation I and Generation II engine families derived from the longstanding Chevrolet small block V8 produced between 1954 and 2003.

Like the previous two generations, the Buick and Oldsmobile small blocks, the Gen III/IV can be found in many different brands. The engine blocks were cast in aluminum for car applications, and iron for most truck applications (notable exceptions include the Chevrolet TrailBlazer SS, Chevrolet SSR, and a limited run of Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra extended-cab standard-box 4WD trucks).

The architecture of the LS series makes for an extremely strong engine block with the aluminum engines being nearly as strong as the iron generation I and II engines. The LS engine also used coil-near-plug style ignition to replace the distributor setup of all previous small-block based engines.

The traditional five-bolt pentagonal cylinder head pattern was replaced with a square four-bolt design (much like the 1964–1990 Oldsmobile V8), and the pistons are of the flat-topped variety (in the LS1, LS2, LS3, LS6, LS7, LQ9, and L33), while all other variants, including the new LS9 and LQ4 truck engine, received a dished version of the GM hypereutectic piston.

The cylinder firing order was changed to 1-8-7-2-6-5-4-3 so that the LS series now corresponds to the firing pattern of other modern V8 engines (for example the Ford Modular V8).

===3.898 in. bore blocks (1997–2005)===
The first of the Generation IIIs, the LS1 was the progenitor of the new architecture design that would transform the entire V8 line and influence the last of the big-blocks.

====5.7L====

The Generation III 5.7L (LS1 and LS6) engines share little other than similar displacement, external dimensions, and rod bearings, with its predecessor (LT1). It is an all-aluminum pushrod engine with a bore and stroke of .

=====LS1=====
When introduced in the 1997 Corvette, the LS1 was rated at at 5,600 rpm and at 4,400 rpm. After improvements to the intake and exhaust manifolds in 2001, the rating improved to and ( for manual-transmission Corvettes. The LS1 was used in the Corvette from 97 to 04. It was also used in 98-02 GM F-Body (Camaro &amp; Firebird) cars with a rating of over , which was rumored to be conservative. The extra horsepower was claimed to come from the intake ram-air effect available in the SS and WS6 models. In Australia, continuous modifications were made to the LS1 engine throughout its lifetime, reaching 382 hp/376 ft-lb in the HSV&#x27;s VYII series, and a Callaway modified version named &quot;C4B&quot; was fitted to HSV GTS models producing and of torque.

Applications:

=====LS6=====
The LS6 is a higher-output version of GM&#x27;s LS1 engine and retains the same capacity. The initial 2001 LS6 produced and , but the engine was modified for 2002 through 2004 to produce and of torque. The LS6 was originally only used in the high-performance C5 Corvette Z06 model, with the Cadillac CTS V-Series getting the engine later. The V-Series used the LS6 for two years before being replaced by the LS2 in 2006. For 2006, the Z06 replaced the LS6 with the new LS7. The LS6 shares its basic block architecture with the GM LS1 engine, but other changes were made to the design such as windows cast into the block between cylinders, improved main web strength and bay to bay breathing, an intake manifold and MAF-sensor with higher flow capacity, a camshaft with higher lift and more duration, a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1, sodium-filled exhaust valves, and a revised oiling system better suited to high lateral acceleration.
LS6 intake manifolds were also used on all 2001+ LS1/6 engines. The casting number, located on the top rear edge of the block, is 12561168.

The SSC Ultimate Aero TT also utilized the LS6 block, albeit with an enlarged displacement of and the addition of two turbochargers.

Applications:

===3.78 in. bore blocks (1999–2007)===
The 4.8L and the 5.3L are smaller truck versions of the LS1 and were designed to replace the 305 and the 350 in trucks. The 4.8L and 5.3L engines share the same Gen III LS-series engine block and heads (upper end) and therefore, most parts interchange freely between these engines and other variants in the LS family.

==== 4.8L LR4====
The Vortec 4800 LR4 (VIN code &quot;V&quot;) is a Generation III small block V8 truck engine. Displacement is with a bore and stroke of .

Applications:
=====L33=====

The Vortec 5300 L33 (VIN code &quot;B&quot;) was marketed as the Vortec 5300 HO. While it used the same aluminum block as was used in the LM4, the L33 included some major differences from the LM4, resulting in higher output than the LM4 and LM7. Instead of the LM4&#x27;s dished pistons, the L33 used the 4.8L&#x27;s flat top pistons. It also used 799 cylinder heads, identical to 243 castings found on LS6s and LS2s, lacking only LS6-spec valve springs and lightweight valves. This combination raised the compression from 9.5:1 to 10.0:1. The L33 also used a unique camshaft not shared with any other engine, with the specifications at .050 duration being: 193 duration, .482 lift, 116 LSA. As a result, power increased by , to and . It was available in extended-cab standard-bed 4WD pickup trucks. Only 25% of 2005 Chevrolet/GMC full-size pickup trucks had an L33 engine.

Applications:
===4.00 in. bore blocks (1999–2007)===

Vehicles fitted with the LQ9 came exclusively with a 4.10:1 rear axle ratio. LQ9s were built only in Romulus, Michigan.


==Generation IV (2005–2020)==
In 2004, the Generation III was superseded by the Generation IV. This category of engines has provisions for high-displacement ranges up to and power output to . Based on the Generation III design, the Generation IV was designed with displacement on demand in mind, a technology that allows every other cylinder in the firing order to be deactivated. It can also accommodate variable valve timing.

A three-valve-per-cylinder design was originally slated for the LS7, which would have been a first for a GM pushrod engine, but the idea was shelved owing to design complexities and when the same two-valve configuration as the other Generation III and IV engines proved to be sufficient to meet the goals for the LS7.

===4.00 in. bore blocks (2005–2020)===
This family of blocks was the first of the generation IV small block with the LS2 being the progenitor of this family and generation. This family of blocks has seen a wide range of applications from performance vehicles to truck usage.

=====LS7=====
:&quot;LS7 can also refer to a 454 over-the-counter 460+ hp high compression engine Chevrolet Big-Block engine of the 1970s&quot;
The LS7 is a engine based on the Gen IV architecture. The block is changed, with sleeved cylinders in an aluminum block with a larger bore of and longer stroke of than the LS2. The small-block&#x27;s bore spacing is retained, requiring pressed-in cylinder liners. The crankshaft and main bearing caps are forged steel for durability, the connecting rods are forged titanium, and the pistons are hypereutectic. The two-valve arrangement is retained, though the titanium intake valves by Del West have grown to and sodium-filled exhaust valves are up to .

Peak output is at 6300 rpm (72.0 BHP/L) and of torque at 4800 rpm with a 7000 rpm redline. During GM&#x27;s reliability testing of this engine in its prototype phase, the LS7 was remarked to have been repeatedly tested to be 8000 rpm capable, although power was not recorded at that rpm level, because of the constraints of the camshaft&#x27;s hydraulic lifters and the intake manifold ability to flow required air at that engine speed.

The LS7 was hand-built by the General Motors Performance Build Center in Wixom, Michigan. Most of these engines are installed in the Z06, some are also sold to individuals by GM as a crate engine. The 2014 and 2015 Z28 were the only Camaros to receive the 427 LS7. As of early 2022, the LS7 is no longer being supplied as a crate engine, with Chevrolet intending to fulfill all current orders until inventory is depleted.

After an extensive engineering process over several years, Holden Special Vehicles fitted the LS7 to a special edition model: the W427. The HSV-tuned engine produced at 6500 rpm and at 5000 rpm of torque. It was unveiled at the Melbourne International Motor Show on February 29, 2008, and went on sale in August 2008. The first Australian car to be fitted with this engine, however, was the CSV GTS of 2007, which was claimed to have a power output of and .

Applications:

* 2006–2013 Chevrolet Corvette Z06
*2009–2016 Zenvo ST1
* 2013 Corvette 427 Convertible
* 2014–2015 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28
*2015 Exotic Rides W70
* Vertical Hummingbird helicopter

=====LS427=====
The LS427 is a engine based on the LS7. The LS427 replaces the dry-sump oiling system with a wet-sump system and includes a higher-lift camshaft. This engine was only available as a crate option and did not appear in any production vehicles. It was introduced in June 2020 and discontinued in January 2022 along with the LS7.

Peak output is and of torque with a 7000 rpm redline.

===4.06 in. bore blocks (2007–2017)===
This family was designed as a replacement for the LS2 but enlarged to better accommodate variable valve timing and Active Fuel Management while still generating decent performance. This family of engines has mainly seen duty in performance cars and high-end SUVs.

====6.2 L====
=====L92 / L9H / L94=====
The L92, also known as the Vortec 6200, displaces , and first debuted in the 2007 Cadillac Escalade. It is an all-aluminum design which, while still a pushrod engine, boasts variable valve timing. The system adjusts both intake and exhaust timing between two settings. This engine produces and in the GMC Yukon Denali/XL Denali, GMC Sierra Denali, Hummer H2, and briefly in the Chevrolet Tahoe LTZ (MY 2008.5 – MY 2009) and rated at and . Starting in 2009, it was also available in the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, as the L9H, with power ratings of and .

Engines built prior to April 1, 2006, contained AFM hardware; however, the mode was not enabled in the PCM, and thus the system was not functional. Engines built after this date also lacked any AFM hardware, and instead used a valley cover plate similar to the L20, until the debut of the L94 variants mentioned below.

The 2009 L92 was modified with flex-fuel capability, becoming the L9H, but still had no AFM hardware. In 2010, the L9H was further modified with Active Fuel Management, becoming the L94 (in the Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon Denali).

Applications:

* 2007–2013 Cadillac Escalade (L92 for MY 2007–2008, L9H for MY 2009, L94 for MY 2010–2013)
* 2008–2009 Chevrolet Tahoe LTZ (as RPO code L92)
* 2007–2013 GMC Yukon Denali / Yukon XL Denali
* 2007–2013 GMC Sierra 1500 Denali
* 2008–2009 Hummer H2
* 2009–2013 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 (as RPO code L9H)
* 2009–2013 GMC Sierra 1500 (as RPO code L9H)

=====LS3=====
: &quot;LS3 can also refer to a Chevrolet Big-Block engine of the 1970s.&quot;
The LS3 was introduced as the Corvette&#x27;s new base engine for the 2008 model year. It produces at 5900 rpm and at 4600 rpm without the optional Corvette exhaust and is SAE certified. The block is an updated version of the LS2 casting featuring a larger bore of creating a displacement of . It also features higher flowing cylinder heads sourced from the L92, a more aggressive camshaft with lift, a 10.7:1 compression ratio, a revised valvetrain with offset intake rocker arms, a high-flow intake manifold, and /hour fuel injectors from the LS7 engine.

The L76/L92/LS3 cylinder heads use intake valves, and exhaust valves. Improved manufacturing efficiency makes these heads cheaper to produce than the outgoing LS6 heads, significantly undercutting the price of aftermarket heads. The large valves, however, limit maximum rpm – 6000 in the L76 (with AFM), and 6600 in the LS3 (with hollow stem valves).

In addition to the above, a dual-mode exhaust package with a bypass on acceleration was available on C6 Corvettes. The dual-mode exhaust uses vacuum-actuated outlet valves, which control engine noise during low-load operation, but open for maximum performance during high-load operation. The system is similar to the C6 Z06, but uses a diameter exhaust compared to the Z06&#x27;s . Power is boosted to and with this option. A similar system was optional on later-model fifth-generation Chevrolet Camaros and standard on the 2016–2017 Chevrolet SS, but no horsepower or torque increases were advertised on those vehicles.

LS3 engines found in manual transmission-equipped C6 Corvette Grand Sport models also received a dry sump oiling system similar to the one fitted to LS7-equipped Corvettes.

From April 2008, Australian performance car manufacturer HSV adopted the LS3 as its standard V8 throughout the range, replacing the 6.0-liter LS2. The LS3 received modifications for its application to HSV E Series models, producing . The LS3 engine in the E Series II GTS (released September 2009) was upgraded to produce . All HSV MY12.5 excluding the base Maloo and Clubsport variants have been upgraded to produce .

From September 2015, Holden introduced the LS3 in all V8 models of the VF II Commodore and WN II Caprice-V, replacing the 6.0L L77.

Applications:

* 2008–2013 Chevrolet Corvette
* 2010–2015 Chevrolet Camaro SS (manual only)
* 2008–2017 Holden vehicles including:
** 2009 Pontiac G8 GXP
** 2014–2017 Chevrolet SS
** 2009–2017 Vauxhall VXR8

=====L99=====
The L99 is derived from the LS3 with reduced output but adds Active Fuel Management (formerly called Displacement on Demand) and variable valve timing, which allows it to run on only four cylinders during light load conditions.

Applications:

* 2010–2015 Chevrolet Camaro SS (automatic transmission)

=====LS9=====
The Gen IV LS9 is a supercharged engine, based on the LS3; the LS7 block was not used because of the higher cylinder pressures created by the supercharger requiring the thicker cylinder walls of the LS3. It has a bore and stroke of . It is equipped with an Eaton four-lobe Roots type supercharger and has a compression ratio of 9.1:1. Power output is rated at 6500 rpm and at 3800 rpm of torque. Note: GM previously used the LS9 RPO code on 1969 and later Chevrolet trucks (both 2WD and 4WD) including Blazers, Jimmys, and Suburbans, as well as car carriers. The original LS9 was a V8, developing and of torque. In 2017, Holden Special Vehicles used a modified version of the LS9 in their GTSR W1, the last-ever Holden Commodore based vehicle produced in Australia.

Applications:
* 2009–2013 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1
* 2016 Icona Vulcano Titanium
* 2017 HSV GTSR W1
=====LSA=====
The supercharged 6.2L LSA is similar to the LS9 and debuted in the 2009 CTS-V. The LSA has been SAE certified at at 6100 rpm and at 3800 rpm. GM labeled it &quot;the most powerful ever offered in Cadillac&#x27;s nearly 106-year history.&quot; The LSA features a smaller supercharger rather than the variant of the LS9. Other differences include a slightly lower 9.0:1 compression ratio, single-unit heat exchanger, and cast pistons.

A and version of the LSA engine is used in the 2012 Camaro ZL1. On May 15, 2013, Holden Special Vehicles announced that this version of the LSA engine would also be used in the GEN-F GTS.

Applications:

* 2009–2015 Cadillac CTS-V
* 2012–2015 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1
* 2014–2017 HSV GTS GEN-F
** 2013–2017 Vauxhall VXR8 GTS, GTS-R
==Generation V (2013–present)==

In 2007, WardsAuto.com reported that the LS3 (used in the 2008 Chevrolet Corvette) and Vortec 6000 LFA (used in the 2008 Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid) engines would be the final two designs in the Generation IV small-block engine family, and the future designs would be part of the Generation V engine family. An experimental engine was built based on the L92 engine from the Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon Denali, and Hummer H2, and reported to generate on gasoline via direct fuel injection, increased compression ratio to 11.5:1, and a modified engine controller. The first Gen V LT engine was the LT1, announced in 2012 as the initial powerplant for the redesigned Corvette C7, succeeding the LS engine family. The new logo formally adopts the Small Block name for the engines.

The fifth generation of the iconic GM small block engine family features the same cam-in-block architecture and bore centers (the distance between the centers of each cylinder) that were born with the original small block in 1954. Structurally, the Gen-V small-block is similar to the Gen III/IV engines, including a deep-skirt cylinder block. Refinements and new or revised components are used throughout, including a revised cooling system and all-new cylinder heads. Because the positions of the intake and exhaust valves are flipped from where they would be in an LS engine, as well as the need for an addition to the camshaft to drive the high-pressure fuel pump for the direct fuel injection, few parts are interchangeable with the Gen III/IV engines.

All Gen V engines use aluminum blocks with aluminum cylinder heads, and include direct injection, piston cooling jets, active fuel management, variable displacement oil pump, and continuously variable valve timing. (The L8T is an exception; see below for details.) However, they all retain their ancestors&#x27; two-valve pushrod valvetrain and 4.4 inch bore spacing.

===4.06 in. bore blocks (2014–present)===
This family of blocks was the first of the Generation V small block with the LT1 being the progenitor of this family and generation. This family of blocks has seen a wide range of applications from performance vehicles to truck usage.

====6.2 L====
===== LT1 =====
The LT1 engine debuted in the 2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray and is the first Generation V small block engine. Like its LS3 predecessor, it gets its displacement from a bore and stroke of with a compression ratio of 11.5 to 1.

Applications:

=====LT2=====
The LT2 engine debuted in the 2020 Corvette Stingray as the successor to the LT1. It was designed specifically with mid-engine placement and dry-sump lubrication in mind.

Applications:

===== L86/L87 =====
The EcoTec3 is a Generation V small-block V8 truck engine (VIN code &quot;J&quot;). The L86 is an LT1 engine modified for truck use with a compression ratio of 11.5 to 1. In 2019, GM introduced the L87 as the successor to the L86. Power and torque remain the same, but whereas the L86&#x27;s &quot;Active Fuel Management&quot; alternates between V4 and V8 modes, the L87&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic Fuel Management&quot; can alternate between any of 17 different firing orders which vary both how many and which cylinders are actually firing based on demand calculated every 125 milliseconds.

Applications:

===== LT4 =====
The LT4 engine builds on the design strengths of the previous LS9 supercharged engine used in the sixth-generation Corvette ZR1 and leverages the technologies introduced on the seventh-generation Corvette Stingray, including direct injection, cylinder deactivation, and continuously variable valve timing, to take Corvette performance to an all-new level. The LT4 engine is based on the same Gen 5 small block foundation as the Corvette Stingray&#x27;s LT1 6.2L naturally aspirated engine, incorporating several unique features designed to support its higher output and the greater cylinder pressures created by forced induction, including: Rotocast A356T6 aluminum cylinder heads that are stronger and handle heat better than conventional aluminum heads, lightweight titanium intake valves, forged powder metal steel connecting rods, 10.0:1 compression ratio, enhanced performance and efficiency enabled by direct injection, forged aluminum pistons with unique, stronger structure to ensure strength under high cylinder pressures, stainless steel exhaust manifolds for structure at higher temperatures, aluminum balancer for reduced mass, and standard dry-sump oiling system with a dual-pressure-control oil pump. The engine uses a Eaton TVS Supercharger. Although smaller than the previous supercharger used on the sixth-generation ZR1, it spins to 5000 rpm faster thus generating boost quicker while making only slightly less total boost than the LS9 engine. The Escalade-V variant uses a Eaton TVS supercharger. This engine is also used by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus for their SCG 004S.

Applications:

===== LT5 =====
The LT5 engine debuted in the seventh-generation Corvette ZR1 at the 2017 Dubai Motor Show. It draws its name from the 5.7 L LT5 from the C4, manufactured from 1989–1993. The original LT5 is rarely known as a Chevy small block V8, as it was designed by Lotus, built by Mercury Marine, and implements a DOHC 32-valve multi-port injection system, instead of the 16-valve push-rod design. The new (and unrelated) LT5, however, has increased its displacement from 5.7 to 6.2L (350 to 376 cu in), retains the Gen V OHV valvetrain, and is topped with a Eaton TVS supercharger and an improved intercooler. It simultaneously couples the standard direct injection system found on Gen 5 engines with port fuel injection, specifically to satisfy upper-RPM fuel demands. Power output is at 6400 rpm and of torque at 3600 rpm.

Applications:

====6.6 L====
===== L8T =====
The L8T is the first (and so far, only) iron block member of the Gen V family, and is the successor to the 6.0L Gen IV L96. It shares its bore with other 6.2L V8s such as the L86, but with a longer stroke of to displace . It is rated for at 5,200 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. The compression ratio is 10.8:1. The longer stroke yields little additional peak torque output compared to the L86, but only requires 87 Octane. The stroke is also shorter than the LS7&#x27;s , to optimize rod ratio for reliability.

Rather than allow a &quot;high-strung&quot; small-block to fail the heavy-duty truck market, the iron block, lack of both stop-start and cylinder deactivation, longer stroke and rod ratio, lower compression, lesser 87 Octane requirement, greater displacement, forged connecting rods, and forged crankshaft with central counterweights all suggest that the L8T was designed specifically to assuage the heavy-duty truck market&#x27;s concerns.

Applications:

===3.78 in. bore blocks (2014–present)===
Unlike the previous Generation III/IV bore block families, there is no displacement variant (having been &#x27;replaced&#x27; by GM&#x27;s 5th Generation LT V8-based V6, the LV3).

====5.3 L====
===== L83 =====
Dubbed EcoTec3, the is a Generation V small block V8 truck engine (VIN code &quot;C&quot;). Like its Vortec 5300 Generation IV predecessor, it gets its displacement from a bore and stroke of with a compression ratio of 11.0 to 1.

Applications:

===== L8B =====
The L8B is an eAssist mild hybrid version of the L83 featuring a 0.45-kWh lithium ion battery pack. This setup can improve fuel efficiency by about 13%. This adds about to the total weight of the truck but provides an additional and .

Applications:

===== L82 =====
The L82 is one of two 5.3L V8s available in the fourth-generation Chevrolet Silverado and fifth-generation GMC Sierra. The L82 uses Active Fuel Management instead of the L84&#x27;s Dynamic Fuel Management system and is only available on lower-trim trucks.

Applications:

===== L84 =====
The L84 is one of two 5.3L V8s available in the 4th generation Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. The L84 is distinguished from the L82 by the presence of the Dynamic Fuel Management System and is either available or standard on mid-to-high-level trims. The L84 is also the base engine on the 2021–present Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Chevrolet Suburban, and GMC Yukon XL.

Applications:

===3.921 in. bore blocks (2014–present)===
These V6 engines are based on the V8 version of the Gen V family, but with two fewer cylinders – a design lineage that dates back to the previous 4.3L V6, which was itself a Gen I small block with a pair of cylinders removed.

Of special note, there were no V6 engines based on Generation II, III, or IV small-block V8s.

====4.3 L====
Dubbed EcoTec3, the is a Generation V small block V6 truck engine. It gets its displacement from bore and stroke of with a compression ratio of 11.0 to 1. Firing order is 1-6-5-4-3-2.

This engine replaces the unrelated 4.3L V6 whose lineage dates back to 1978.

===== LV3 =====
Applications:

===== LV1 =====
The engine is essentially the same as the LV3, but without Active Fuel Management technology. The LV1 made its debut in the 2018 model year GM full-size vans—the 2018 Chevrolet Express and 2018 GMC Savana—as the successor to the Gen IV 4.8L L20.

Applications:

==Generation VI==
General Motors announced in January 2023 that plans for a sixth generation of small-block were in place, with the company investing $854 million into its various manufacturing plants. The timeline for the release of the new generation is not yet known.

== Engine table ==
The eighth character in the VIN or the RPO code from the glove box sticker can be used to identify which type of LS engine a vehicle has.


==Known issues==
In the early production run of the LS-series engine, some engines encountered &#x27;piston slap&#x27; during the first few minutes after a cold engine start; this sound is caused by the pistons rocking slightly in the cylinder until they reach operating temperature/size. &quot;Piston slap&quot; sometimes sounds more like a knock or the sound of a diesel engine running. It is typically only present when the engine is cold and disappears as the engine reaches operating temperature.

Another common problem with the 2001–2006 5.3L engines was cracking cylinder heads. This is commonly called the &quot;Castech Head&quot; failure. GM issued a Technical Service Bulletin on this failure to help service technicians identify the problem. The head casting number (which can be viewed from the passenger side of the vehicle just in front of the valve cover) was 706. Some heads with this casting number would fail (but not all of them) as GM had different suppliers for the same head. The failure was due to undetected porosity around the oil drains in the head.

Yet another common problem with the 2005–2016 fourth generation V8 LS engines was a failure of the specialized lifters in engines equipped with the AFM system. While in AFM operation, the lifters would sometimes fail to come out of AFM mode and cause the engine to go into &#x27;limp home&#x27; mode. In this mode damage could occur to the pistons, camshaft, or the lifters themselves. The resulting solution was a package of components that would replace the lifters, lifter guides, camshaft, Valve Lifter Oil Manifold (VLOM) plate. Cylinder heads were required to be removed from the engine in order to replace all the components. The engine computer also required reprogramming to permanently Disable AFM.




==Build-your-own program==
In 2011, Chevrolet Performance began to offer the build your own engine program for LS7 (part number 19259944) or LS9 (part number 19259945) crate engines. It also provides customers the experience of visiting GM&#x27;s unique Performance Build Center in Wixom, Michigan, where they will join a specially trained engine builder to assist in the start-to-finish assembly of the engine they purchased – from installing the crankshaft in the cylinder block to topping off the engine with its intake system. In the case of the LS9, it also means installing the supercharger assembly. Upon completion, a personalized nameplate is added to the engine.

The build-your-own engine program associated with the V8 engines, available for buyers of Chevrolet Corvette, Cadillac XLR, and certain top-spec Chevrolet Camaro models, was temporarily halted after the closure of GM Performance Build Center in Wixom, Michigan. The program&#x27;s venue was reported to be relocated to the Corvette assembly plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

== Aftermarket ==
; LS7.R

The LS7.R engine is a variation of the LS7 used in the highly successful C6.R American Le Mans Series racecar. It was crowned as Global Motorsport engine of the year by a jury of 50 race engine engineers on the Professional Motorsport World Expo 2006 in Cologne, Germany.

; LSX

&quot;LSx is also used to denote any LS engine.&quot;

At the 2006 SEMA show, GM Performance Parts introduced the LSX engine, an all-new cast-iron racing block based on the LS7 engine. It was designed with help from drag racing legend Warren Johnson. It offers displacements ranging from with a bore and stroke of and is capable of withstanding . This block incorporates two extra rows of head-bolt holes per bank for increased clamping capacity. The six bolt steel main caps are the same ones used on the LS7 engine. The engine debuted at the auto show in a customized 1969 Camaro owned by Reggie Jackson. The LSX was available starting the second quarter of 2007, set to be available in authorized dealerships and retailers on March 31, 2007. The Hennessey Venom GT also uses the LSX engine based on LS7.

Chevrolet Performance LSX Bowtie block includes LSX specific six-bolts-per-cylinder head bolt pattern, billet-steel six-bolt dowel-located main bearing caps, extra-thick deck for maximum clamping force, extra-thick cylinder walls allow increased bore capacity (maximum bore still allows minimum wall thickness), true priority main oiling system, main web bay-to-bay breathing holes reduce crank windage, orange powder coat finish, machined bore at is ready for final boring/honing.

A version engineered by Ilmor is used in NASCAR for the Craftsman Truck Series and the ARCA Racing Series as an option engine. Most teams in both series (known as &quot;NT1&quot; in the Truck Series and the &quot;ARCA 396&quot; in ARCA) have switched to the engine because of cost savings, as engines must last 1,500 miles and rebuilds are about one-thirds the cost of a new engine.

; LSX376

Chevrolet Performance LSX376 crate engines are updated versions of LSX crate engine family designed to support up to . All models use the Chevrolet Performance LSX Bowtie block.

LSX376-B15 (part number 19299306) includes forged steel crankshaft, forged powdered metal I-beam rods (both the crankshaft and rods from the LSA engine), forged aluminum pistons (9.0:1 compression), and high-flow rectangular-port six-bolt LSX-LS3 heads for supercharged and turbocharged combinations producing up to of boost and up to about .

LSX376-B8 (part number 19171049) is a more economical version that is capable of approximately , for an engine producing approximately . It is designed for production-style supercharger and turbo systems used without enhancements or modifications.

; LSX454 and LSX454R

Chevrolet Performance created the 454 big-block Chevy race engine in 1970 and continued production of the crate engine through 2001. The addition of EFI and picking up the Vortec 7400 name took place in 1996 which was replaced with the Vortec 8100 platform once the 7400 was retired. Chevrolet Performance released the 454 again in 2011 as a small-block crate engine dubbed the LSX454R officially rated at 776 horsepower at 7,000 rpm and 649 lb-ft of torque at 5,100 rpm. The LSX454R was discontinued in July 2018 and was recorded as one of the more powerful LS crate engines to be assembled from Chevy Performance.

; Noonan Race Engineering

Noonan Race Engineering developed two billet aluminum blocks based on the LS engine. Bore sizes are up to and stroke up to are available, making a displacement possible. The billet construction provides added block integrity suited to high horsepower applications. The block design incorporates turbocharger pressure feed lines in the front of the valley and oil dump ports in the side of the block to return oil to the sump. In addition to the solid block, a waterjacketed version was designed to provide better cooling options for street or endurance purposes. Noonan also developed intake manifolds for the LS, specifically for turbocharging or twin turbo charging or supercharging.

<doc id="877445" wikidata="Q317158" url="?curid=877445" title="Adjustment disorder">
<text>Adjustment disorder is a mental and behavioral disorder defined by a maladaptive response to a psychosocial stressor. The maladaptive response usually involves otherwise normal emotional and behavioral reactions that manifest more intensely than usual (considering contextual and cultural factors), causing marked distress, preoccupation with the stressor and its consequences, and functional impairment. 

Diagnosis of adjustment disorder is common, with lifetime prevalence estimates for adults ranging from 5 to 21%. Adult women are diagnosed twice as often as men. Among children and adolescents, girls and boys are equally likely to be diagnosed with an adjustment disorder. 

Adjustment disorder was introduced into the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition&quot; (DSM-III) in 1980.

Another name for adjustment disorder is stress response syndrome, as well as situational depression, since depression is one of the most common symptoms.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs of adjustment disorder include sadness, hopelessness, lack of enjoyment, crying spells, nervousness, anxiety, desperation, feeling overwhelmed and thoughts of suicide, performing poorly in school or work, among others.

Common characteristics of adjustment disorder include mild depressive symptoms, anxiety, and traumatic stress symptoms or a combination of the three. According to the DSM-5, there are six types of adjustment disorder, which are characterized by the following predominant symptoms: depressed mood, anxiety, mixed depression and anxiety, disturbance of conduct, mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct, and unspecified. However, the criteria for these symptoms are not specified in greater detail. Adjustment disorder may be acute or chronic, depending on whether it lasts more or less than six months. According to the DSM-5, if the adjustment disorder lasts less than six months, then it may be considered acute. If it lasts more than six months, it may be considered chronic. Moreover, the symptoms cannot last longer than six months after the stressor(s), or its consequences, have terminated. However, the stress-related disturbance does not only exist as an exacerbation of a pre-existing mental disorder.

Unlike major depressive disorder, adjustment disorder is caused by an outside stressor and generally resolves once the individual is able to adapt to the situation. The condition is different from anxiety disorder, which lacks the presence of a stressor, or post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder, which usually are associated with a more intense stressor.
Suicidal behavior is prominent among people with adjustment disorder of all ages, and up to one-fifth of adolescent suicide victims may have an adjustment disorder. Bronish and Hecht (1989) found that 70% of a series of patients with adjustment disorder attempted suicide immediately before their index admission and they remitted faster than a comparison group with major depression. Asnis et al. (1993) found that adjustment disorder patients report persistent ideation or suicide attempts less frequently than those diagnosed with major depression. According to a study on 82 adjustment disorder patients at a clinic, Bolu et al. (2012) found that 22 (26.8%) of these patients were admitted due to suicide attempt, consistent with previous findings. In addition, it was found that 15 of these 22 patients chose suicide methods that involved high chances of being saved. Henriksson et al. (2005) states statistically that the stressors are of one-half related to parental issues and one-third in peer issues.

One hypothesis about adjustment disorder is that it may represent a sub-threshold clinical syndrome.

The syndrome of occupational burnout is considered to be adjustment disorder by some national health authorities.

===Subtypes===

Adjustment disorder has six different subtypes, all of which are based on what the main symptoms are.

The subtypes are as follows:

* With depressed mood: depression, hopelessness, lack of interest or joy from previously enjoyed hobbies, tearfulness
* With anxiety: anxiousness, being overwhelmed, trouble concentrating, worry, separation anxiety (common in children)
* With anxiety and depressed mood: combination of symptoms from both subtypes above
* With disturbance of conduct: acting destructive, reckless behavior, rebellious
* With mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct: combination of symptoms from both subtypes above
* Unspecified: symptoms that do not fall into above subtypes; often include physical symptoms and withdrawal from everyday activities

==Risk factors==
Those exposed to repeated trauma are at greater risk, even if that trauma is in the past. Age can be a factor due to young children having fewer coping resources and because they are less likely to realize the consequences of a potential stressor.

A stressor is generally an event of a serious, unusual nature that an individual or group of individuals experience. Adjustment disorders can come from a wide range of stressors that can be traumatic or relatively minor, like the loss of a girlfriend/boyfriend, a poor report card, or moving to a new neighborhood. It is thought that the more often the stressor occurs, the more likely it is to produce adjustment disorder. The objective nature of the stressor is of secondary importance. A stressor gains its pathogenic potential when the patient perceives it as stressful. The identification of a causal stressor is necessary if a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is to be made.

There are certain stressors that are more common in different age groups:

Adulthood:
* Marital conflict
* Financial conflict
* Health issues with oneself, partner, or dependent children
* Personal tragedy such as death or personal loss
* Loss of job or unstable employment conditions e.g., corporate takeover or redundancy

Adolescence and childhood:
* Family conflict or parental separation
* School problems or changing schools
* Sexuality issues
* Death, illness, or trauma in the family

In a study conducted from 1990 to 1994 on 89 psychiatric outpatient adolescents, 25% had attempted suicide in which 37.5% had misused alcohol, 87.5% displayed aggressive behaviour, 12.5% had learning difficulties, and 87.5% had anxiety symptoms.

==Diagnosis ==

=== DSM-5 classification ===
The basis of the diagnosis is the presence of a precipitating stressor and a clinical evaluation of the possibility of symptom resolution on removal of the stressor due to the limitations in the criteria for diagnosing adjustment disorder. In addition, the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is less clear when patients are exposed to stressors long-term, because this type of exposure is associated with adjustment disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

Some signs and criteria used to establish a diagnosis are important. First, the symptoms must clearly follow a stressor. The symptoms should be more severe than would be expected. There should not appear to be other underlying disorders. The symptoms that are present are not part of a normal grieving for the death of family member or other loved one.

Adjustment disorders have the ability to be self-limiting. Within five years of when they are originally diagnosed, approximately 20–50% go on to be diagnosed with psychiatric disorders that are considered as more serious.

==Treatment ==
Individuals with an adjustment disorder and depressive or anxiety symptoms may benefit from treatments usually used for depressive or anxiety disorders. The use of different therapies can be beneficial for any age group. There is also a list of medications that can be used to help people with adjustment disorder whose symptoms are too severe for therapy alone. If a person is considering taking medication, they should talk to their doctor.
Specific treatment is based on factors of each individual separately. These factors include but are not limited to age, severity of symptoms, type of adjustment disorder, and personal preference.

Different ways to help with the disorder include:

* individual psychotherapy
* family therapy
* peer group therapy
* medication

In addition to professional help, parents and caregivers can help their children with their difficulty adjusting by:

* offering encouragement to talk about their emotions
* offering support and understanding
* reassuring the child that their reactions are normal
* involving the child&#x27;s teachers to check on their progress in school
* letting the child make simple decisions at home, such as what to eat for dinner or what show to watch on television
* having the child engage in a hobby or activity they enjoy

==Criticism==
It has been criticized for its lack of specificity of symptoms, behavioral parameters, and close links with environmental factors has been criticized from a minority of the professional community as well as those in semi-related professions outside the healthcare field. Relatively little research has been done on this condition.

An editorial in the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot; described adjustment disorder as being so &quot;vague and all-encompassing… as to be useless,&quot; but it has been retained in the DSM-5 because of the belief that it serves a useful clinical purpose for clinicians seeking a temporary, mild, non-stigmatizing label, particularly for patients who need a diagnosis for insurance coverage of therapy.

In the US military, there has been concern about its diagnosis in active duty military personnel.

== In relation to the COVID-19 pandemic ==
A study was conducted in Poland during the first phase of the pandemic. The study used self-report surveys to measure the prevalence and severity of symptoms of adjustment disorder compared to PTSD, depression, and anxiety. The data was collected in the first quarantine period between March 25 to April 27, 2020.

Results from the study:

* The COVID-19 pandemic was a highly stressful event for 75% of the participants and the most powerful predictor of adjustment disorder.
* 49% reported an increase in adjustment disorder symptoms, which were more common among females and those without a full-time job; 14% of the sample met the criteria for a diagnosis of adjustment disorder.
* A significant proportion of the sample was also positive for generalized anxiety (44%) and depression (26%): the presumptive diagnosis rate of PTSD was 2.4%

<text>Adonara is an island in the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia, located east of the larger island of Flores in the Solor Archipelago. To the east lies Lembata, formerly known as Lomblen. Adonara is the highest of the islands of the archipelago, reaching an altitude of 1,659 metres, and it has an area of 529.75 km2. It is situated administratively in the East Flores Regency of East Nusa Tenggara province.

== Administration ==
The island is divided into eight districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), tabulated below with their areas (in km2) and their populations at the 2010 Census and 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2022.

Note: (a) Adonara Timur District, notwithstanding its name, actually occupies the south-central part of Adonara Island, with Wotan Ulu Mado District to the southwest and Ile Boleng District to the southeast. &lt;br&gt;(b) including the two kelurahan of Lamatewelu and Waiwerang Kota.
&lt;br&gt;(c) Adonara District covers only the north-central part of Adonara Island (&quot;Adonara Utara&quot;), with Kelubagolit and Witihama Districts to the east and Adonara Barat and Adonara Tengah Districts to the west.

==History==

Local history on Adonara is documented from the sixteenth century, when Portuguese traders and missionaries established a post on the nearby island of Solor. By that time Adonara and the surrounding islands were ritually divided between a population of coastal dwellers known as Paji, and a population mainly settling the mountainous inland called Demon. The Paji were susceptible to Islam, while the Demon tended to fall under Portuguese influence. The Paji areas on Adonara contained three principalities, namely Adonara proper (centered on the north coast of the island), and Terong and Lamahala (on the south coast). Together with two principalities on Solor (Lohayong and Lamakera), they constituted a league called Watan Lema (&quot;the five shores&quot;). The Watan Lema allied with the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1613, confirmed in 1646. The Adonara principalities had frequent feuds with the Portuguese in Larantuka on Flores, and were not always obedient to the Dutch authorities.
In the course of the nineteenth century, the ruler of Adonara (proper) in the north strengthened his position in the Solor Archipelago; by then, he was also the overlord of parts of eastern Flores and Lembata. The Demon areas stood under the suzerainty of the principality of Larantuka, which in turn was under Portuguese rule until 1859, when it was ceded to the Netherlands. The principalities of Larantuka and Adonara (proper) were abolished by the Indonesian government in 1962. Some post-independence local officials trace their roots to past rulers, called &quot;raja&quot;, of Adonara (proper). These include:

*Foramma, c. 1650
*Boli I, c. 1671–1684
*Eke 1684–1688 (killed by mountain people)
*Gogok, c. 1702
*Wuring (brother of Eke), 1688–1719
*Boli II (son of Wuring), 1719-after 1756
*unknown rulers
*Jou, c. 1815
*Lakabella Jou (son of Jou), c. 1832
*Begu, d. July 28, 1850 (killed)
* (son of Begu), 1850–1857
*Jou (brother of Pela), 1857–1868
*Kamba Begu (brother of Lakabella), 1868–1893
*Bapa Tuan (son of Kamba Begu), temporary Raja in 1893 for 6 months
*Arkiang Kamba (Arakang; brother of Bapa Tuan, b. 1866), 1893 or 1894 – abdicated December 18, 1930
*Bapa Ana (son of a sister of Kamba Begu), Regent with the title of Kapitan 1930 – December 1, 1935, condemned to life imprisonment 1935 and sent to Kupang
*Bapa Nuhur, (son of Gela, a son of Bapa Tuan, b. 1915), 1941–1947
*Bapa Kaya, (son of Bapa Ana, d. 12/1/1954), Regent 1947–1951
*Mohamad Eke (great-grandson of Raja Jo, 1929 – c. 1985), 1951–1962, first referred as Government Asst during Bapa Kaya&#x27;s rule and also Kapitan of Adonara

==Geography==
Adonara Island is a part of the Indonesian regency of East Flores. It can be reached by airplane from Jakarta to Kupang, then by ferry to Larantuka, then by boat.

The town of Waiwerang and its neighbouring &quot;desa&quot; (villages) forms the only urban area on Adonara. There is no single administrative centre on the island, as each district has its own centre, all subservient to the regency administration at Larantuka on Flores island.

<doc id="877456" wikidata="Q3273608" url="?curid=877456" title="Walter Henry Medhurst">
<text>Walter Henry Medhurst (29 April 179624 January 1857), was an English Congregationalist missionary to China, born in London and educated at St Paul&#x27;s School. He was one of the early translators of the Bible into Chinese-language editions.

==Early life==
Medhurst&#x27;s father was an innkeeper in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. As a young man, Medhurst studied at Hackney College under George Collison and he worked as a printer and typesetter at the Gloucester Herald and the London Missionary Society (LMS). He became interested in Christian missions and the LMS chose him to become a missionary printer in China. He sailed in 1816 to join their station at Malacca, which was intended to be a great printing centre. En route, he called at Madras where, in a little less than three months, he met Mrs Elizabeth Braune, née Martin (1794–1874), marrying her the day before he sailed to Malacca.

==Malacca and Shanghai==
Having arrived in Malacca, Medhurst learned Malay, and studied Chinese, Chinese characters, and the Hokkien group of Min Nan Chinese varieties, which is widely spoken in Southeast Asia. He was ordained there by William Charles Milne on 27 April 1819.

Medhurst served as a missionary in Penang in 1820, and then in Batavia (present-day Jakarta), capital of the Dutch East Indies in 1822. His son Walter Henry was born that year and born in 1828 was his daughter Eliza Mary who went on to marry Hong Kong&#x27;s chief magistrate Charles Batten Hillier in 1846. Their youngest daughter was Augusta, born in 1840.

Today&#x27;s All Saints Jakarta church and the Parapattan Orphanage were started by Medhurst.

In addition to compiling his Chinese-English and English-Chinese dictionaries, Medhurst was a prolific translator, lexicographer, and editor.

Although Medhurst never traveled to Japan, in 1830 he published &quot;An English and Japanese, and Japanese and English Vocabulary Compiled from Native Works&quot; in 344 pages. Based upon his studies of Hokkien, in 1831 Medhurst completed his &quot;A Dictionary of the Hok-këèn Dialect of the Chinese Language&quot;, but printing of all 862 pages of which reached finality only in 1837 after being affected by the end of the British East India Company&#x27;s trade monopoly in 1834 and for lack of funds.

In the 1840s, Medhurst collaborated with John Stronach, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, and William Charles Milne translating the (1847) &quot;Delegates&#x27; Version&quot; of the Bible in Chinese. Medhurst, Elihu Doty, and John Van Nest Talmage developed the Pe̍h-ōe-jī Church Romanization of Southern Min Chinese that was widely used by missionaries.

When peace was concluded with China in 1842, he moved to Shanghai where he founded the London Missionary Society Press () together with William Muirhead and Dr William Lockhart. They were later joined by Joseph Edkins, and William Charles Milne. He continued in Shanghai until 1856, laying the foundations of a successful mission.

In 1843, New York University conferred upon him the honorary degree of D.D.

==Delegates&#x27; Version==

Medhurst&#x27;s principal labour for several years, was in leading the committee of delegates, which created the Delegates&#x27; Version of the Bible. In the 1840s, a group of four people (Walter Henry Medhurst, John Stronach, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, and William Charles Milne) cooperated to translate the Bible into Chinese.

The translation of the Hebrew language part was done mostly by Gutzlaff from the Netherlands Missionary Society, with the exception of the Pentateuch and the book of Joshua, which were done by the group collectively. The initial Gutzlaff translation, completed in 1847 is well known due to its adoption by the revolutionary peasant leader Hong Xiuquan of the Taiping Rebellion as some of the reputed early doctrines of the organization.

The translation of the New Testament was finished in 1850 and of the Old Testament in 1853, written in a version of Classical Chinese. With John Stronach, and the assistance of Wang Tao, Medhurst later translated the New Testament into the Mandarin dialect of Nanjing.

==Significant books==
Medhurst would also produce a Chinese translation of the Book of Common Prayer, published in Hong Kong in 1855.

His Chinese-English and English-Chinese dictionaries (each in 2 vols.) were in use into the twentieth century.

==Death &amp; memorial==

Medhurst left Shanghai in 1856, in failing health. He died two days after reaching London, on 24 January 1857 and was buried at the Congregationalists&#x27; non-denominational Abney Park Cemetery where his white stone obelisk monument can still be seen today.
He left a son, Sir Walter Henry Medhurst (1822–1885), who was British consul at Hankou and afterwards at Shanghai.

<text>Baby food is any soft, easily consumed food other than breastmilk or infant formula that is made specifically for human babies between six months and two years old. The food comes in many varieties and flavors that are purchased ready-made from producers, or it may be table food eaten by the family that has been mashed or otherwise broken down.

==Readiness and health==
===Readiness===
As of 2023, the World Health Organization, UNICEF and many national health agencies recommended waiting until six months of age before starting a child on food. Neither too early nor too late.

In Italy in 2020, a survey of parents found that more than two-thirds of babies were first fed baby food when they were five or six months old. A survey in Scotland in 2017 indicated that almost no babies were fed baby food before the age of four months, and that about half of them were not given baby food until they were at least six months old. 

Inappropriately early introduction of baby food (i.e., before the baby is at least four months old) was associated with the family being concerned that the baby&#x27;s hunger was not satisfied by breastmilk alone. Feeding a baby baby food, or any food except breastmilk or infant formula, before the age of four months is also associated with the development of food allergies; delaying the introduction of potentially allergenic foods, such as peanuts, beyond six months provides no health benefit. It also increases the risk of choking (inability to breathe due to food stuck in the airway), strain on the kidneys, and gastroenteritis (a painful inflammation of the gut that can cause vomiting and diarrhea). 

===Health===
As a global public health recommendation, the World Health Organization recommends that infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Most six-month-old infants are physiologically and developmentally ready for new foods, textures and modes of feeding. Experts advising the World Health Assembly have provided evidence that introducing solids earlier than six months increases babies&#x27; chances of illness, without improving growth.

One of the health concerns associated with the introduction of solid foods before six months is iron deficiency. The early introduction of complementary foods may satisfy the hunger of the infant, resulting in less frequent breastfeeding and ultimately less milk production in the mother. Because iron absorption from human milk is depressed when the milk is in contact with other foods in the proximal small bowel, early use of complementary foods may increase the risk of iron depletion and anemia.

In Canada sodium content in infant food is regulated; strained fruit, fruit juice, fruit drink, and cereal cannot be sold if sodium has been added (excluding strained desserts). Foods naturally containing sodium are limited to 0.05 - 0.25 grams per 100 grams of food, depending on the type of infant food.

If there is a family history of allergies, one may wish to introduce only one new food at a time, leaving a few days in between to notice any reactions that would indicate a food allergy or sensitivity. This way, if the child is unable to tolerate a certain food, it can be determined which food is causing the reaction.

Meeting the nutritional needs of infants as they grow is essential for their healthy development. Feeding infants inappropriately or insufficiently can cause major illnesses and affect their physical and mental development. Educational campaigns that share information on when to introduce solid foods, appropriate types of foods to feed an infant, and hygiene practices are effective at improving these feeding practices.

== Nutritional needs and the amount of food ==
The World Health Organization recommends starting in small amounts that gradually increase as the child gets older: 2 to 3 meals per day for infants 6 to 8 months of age and 3 to 4 meals per day for infants 9 to 23 months of age, with 1 or 2 additional snacks as required.

Newborns need a diet of breastmilk or infant formula. In infants, minimum carbohydrate (mainly lactose) intake should be 40% of total energy, gradually increasing to 55% energy by the age of 2 years.

As shown in the 2008 &quot;Feeding Infants and Toddlers&quot; study, the overall diet of babies and toddlers, the primary consumers of baby food, generally meets or significantly exceeds the recommended amount of macronutrients. Toddlers and preschoolers generally ate too little dietary fiber, and preschoolers generally ate too much saturated fat, although the overall fat intake was lower than recommended. Micronutrient levels were typically within the recommended levels. A small group of older infants in the American study needed more iron and zinc, such as from iron-fortified baby foods. A substantial proportion of toddlers and preschoolers exceeded the upper recommended level of synthetic folate, preformed vitamin A, zinc, and sodium (salt).

==Preparation and feeding==
Baby foods are either a soft, liquid paste or an easily chewed food since babies lack developed muscles and teeth to effectively chew. Babies typically move to consuming baby food once nursing or formula is not sufficient for the child&#x27;s appetite. Babies do not need to have teeth to transition to eating solid foods. Teeth, however, normally do begin to show up at this age. Care should be taken with certain foods that pose a choking hazard, such as undercooked vegetables, grapes, or food that may contain bones. 

Babies begin eating liquid style baby food consisting of pureed vegetables and fruits, sometimes mixed with rice cereal and formula, or breastmilk. Then, as the baby is better able to chew, small, soft pieces or lumps may be included. Care should be taken, as babies with teeth have the ability to break off pieces of food but they do not possess the back molars to grind, so food can be carefully mashed or prechewed, or broken into manageable pieces for their baby. 

Around 6 months of age, babies may begin to feed themselves (picking up food pieces with hands, using the whole fist, or later the pincer grasp [the thumb and forefinger]) with help from older family members or caregivers.

=== Homemade or commercial ===
Homemade baby food is less expensive than commercial baby foods. Homemade food is appropriate only when the family has a sufficient and varied diet, as well as access to refrigeration and basic sanitation. It is important to follow proper sanitation methods when preparing homemade baby food such as washing and rinsing vegetables or fruit, as well as the cooking and packaging materials that will be used.

Homemade food requires more preparation time than simply opening a jar or box of ready-to-eat commercial baby food. Food may need to be minced or pureed for young babies, or cooked separately without the salt, intense spices, or sugar that the family chooses to eat.

=== Picky eating ===
Parents and/or caregivers may perceive up to half of toddlers as being &quot;picky&quot; or &quot;faddy&quot;, with the peak around 24 months. Adults who hold this opinion often stop offering new foods to the child after only three to five attempts, rather than continuing to offer the food until the child has tasted it eight to fifteen times. They may also engage in counterproductive behaviors, such as offering appetite-suppressing milk or other favorite foods as an alternative, or trying to force or bribe the child into eating.

==Types==
Through the first year, breastmilk or infant formula is the main source of calories and nutrients. By six months old, infants are ready to be introduced to table food.

Babies may be started directly on normal family food if attention is given to choking hazards; this is called baby-led weaning. Because breastmilk takes on the flavor of foods eaten by the mother, these foods are especially good choices.

===Food type===

;Cereals
: On a typical day about half of American babies aged four and five months old are fed infant cereal. The baby may have eaten as little as one small bite of infant cereal, or even as little as one small bite of a food that contains infant cereal mixed with other foods. Other types of grain-based foods are rare at that age. About 90% of babies aged six to twelve months eat some type of grain, although only half eat infant cereal. The others eat rice, bread, crackers, pasta, or cereal designed for older children.
;Fruits
: On any given day, about 20% of babies aged four and five months eat some type of fruit, usually a prepared baby food. As with all of these, this may represent as little as one small bite of fruit or a food partly composed of fruit. Two-thirds of babies aged six to nine months, and between 75% and 85% of babies and toddlers older than nine months, eat some type of fruit. At age six to nine months, half of the babies are eating prepared baby food fruits, but toddlers aged 12 months and older primarily eat non-baby food fruits, such as fresh bananas or canned fruits. Apple and bananas are common fruits for babies of all ages. Fruit juice, primarily apple and grape juice, is usually introduced later than fruit, and about half of older babies and toddlers drink some type of 100% fruit juice.
; Vegetables
: On a typical day, about a quarter of babies aged four and five months eat some type of vegetable at least once, almost always prepared baby food, and usually a yellow or orange vegetable like carrots, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and winter squash. At age six to nine months, about 60% of babies and about 70% of older babies and toddlers eat vegetables, with baby food vegetables rapidly being replaced by cooked vegetables after about nine months. Raw vegetables are uncommon for all babies and toddlers. By the first birthday, almost a third of babies eat potatoes on a given day.
;Meat
: Very few four- and five-month-old American babies eat meat or other protein sources (excluding milk). Six- to nine-month-old babies mostly eat meat as part of baby food that contains a small amount of meat along with vegetables or grains. About three-quarters of nine- to twelve-month-old babies are given either meat or another protein source, such as eggs, cheese, yogurt, beans, or nuts. More than 90% of babies aged 12 to 18 months old, and nearly all toddlers older than that, are given a protein source at least once a day. Almost three-quarters of these toddlers are given non-baby food meat; prepared baby food meat (by itself) is uncommon at any age.
; Sweet and salty foods
: Sweet and salty foods are uncommon for babies. Compared to a prior study in 2002, the number of babies under the age of nine months that received any sort of sweetened food, snack, or beverage, had dropped by nearly half. At age nine to twelve months, fewer than half of babies are given sweetened foods like cookies, ice cream, or fruit-flavored drinks. Prepared baby food desserts are uncommon at any age, but are given to almost 12% of babies aged nine to twelve months. It is recommended to consume natural sugars from fruits and vegetables to satisfy children’s cravings while providing essential nutrients, to prevent future health issues caused by added sugars and saturated fats. 
===Toddler foods===
Some commercial baby food companies have expanded their lines to produce specialty foods for toddlers from the age of about 12 months to two and a half years old. These include juice, cereal, small microwaveable meals, baked goods, and other foods that have been formulated and marketed for toddlers.

===Geriatric use===
In the late 1940s, Gerber Products Company and Beech-Nut produced special cookbooks to promote the sale of commercial baby foods for use by elderly, sick, or disabled people.

==Historical and cultural==
Baby food varies from culture to culture. In many cultures, pastes of a grain and liquids are the first baby food. In human history and presently with many cultures around the world, babies are fed food premasticated by the caretaker of the baby in order to pulverise the food and start the digestion process. 

In the Western world until the mid-1900s, baby food was generally made at home. The industrial revolution saw the beginning of the baby food market which promoted commercial baby foods as convenience items. In developed countries, babies are now often started with commercially produced iron-fortified infant cereals, and then move on to mashed fruits and vegetables. Commercial baby foods are widely available in dry, ready-to-feed and frozen forms, often in small batches (e.g. small jars) for convenience of preparation. On the contrary, in developing countries, breastfeeding is more widely accepted and socially tolerated in public, thus creating a societal contrast. Amy Bentley, author of &quot;Inventing Baby Food&quot;, talks about how infant feeding reflects one&#x27;s &quot;position in the postwar era of the American Century&quot; because in developed countries, families are able to purchase processed baby foods to feed their children, whereas in developing country, natural breastfeeding is more popular.

Commercially prepared baby foods in the Netherlands were first prepared by Martinus van der Hagen through his NV Nutricia company in 1901. In United States they were first prepared by Harold Clapp who sold Clapp&#x27;s Baby Food in the 1920s. The Fremont Canning Company, now called the Gerber Products Company, started in 1927. The Beech-Nut company entered the U.S. baby food market in 1931. The first precooked dried baby food was Pablum which was originally made for sick children in the 1930s. Other commercial baby food manufacturers include H. J. Heinz Company, Nestlé, Nutricia, Organix and Unilever. Heinz produced dehydrated baby food in the 1980s. The demand from parents for organic food began to grow in the 1960s; since then, many larger commercial manufacturers have introduced organic lines of infant food.

At the beginning of the 20th century in America, most babies began eating baby food around the age of seven months. During and shortly after World War II, the age at which solid food was first introduced dropped to just six weeks. This age has since increased to four to six months. By the mid-20th century, manufactured baby food was readily used and supplemented previous infant feeding practices. Author of &quot;Inventing Baby Food&quot;, Amy Bentley argues that the excessive additives of sugar, salt, and MSG in overused manufactured baby food conditioned infants to prefer processed foods later in life. Also, it is believed that exposing infants to solid foods at an earlier age well help them get used to foods later on in life. This subsequent misuse of salt and sugar was also feared to effect issues of weight and nutrition based diseases.

In China and other east Asian countries, homemade baby food remains common, and babies are started on rice porridge called xifan, then move on to mashed fruits, soft vegetables, tofu and fish.

In Sweden, it is common to start with mashed fruit, such as bananas, as well as oatmeal and mashed vegetables. 

In western Africa, maize porridge is often the first solid food given to young children.

An infant&#x27;s first bite of solid food is ceremonial and holds religious importance in many cultures. An example of this is annaprashan, a Hindu ritual where the infant is fed a sweetened rice porridge, usually blessed, by an elder family member. Similar rites of passage are practiced in other Hindu areas, including the Bengal region, Vietnam, and Thailand.
==Market==
According to Zion Market Research, the market size for baby food in the United States is estimated to be $53 billion in 2018 and growing to $76 billion by 2021.

Commercial baby food in the United States is dominated by Gerber, which had about 70% of the American market share in 1996. Beechnut had about 15% of the market, and Heinz had about 10%. Heinz&#x27;s Earth&#x27;s Best, the largest brand of organic baby food, had about 2% of the American market share.

In Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, Heinz had about 90% of the market share in 1996. Heinz is also the market leader in the UK, Italy, and several eastern European countries.

===Controversies===
Some commercial baby foods have been criticized for their contents and cost. Over the decades, there have been multiple recalls of baby foods because of concerns about contamination or spoilage. In 1984 and 1986, Gerber was involved in a scandal over glass baby food jars breaking in transit, which dramatically affected its sales and profitability, although the US Food and Drug Administration later concluded that the company was not at fault. In 1987, Beechnut paid US$25 million to resolve charges of selling adulterated apple juice in the early 1980s. In 2011, Nestlé France decided to recall a batch of &quot;P&#x27;tit pot&quot; baby food as a precautionary measure after a customer reportedly found glass shards in one of their jars. An investigation into the incident&#x27;s scope led the company to conclude that it had been an isolated occurrence and that the rest of the batch had not been affected.

===Pesticides===
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is required by law to ensure that pesticide residues do not harm babies and children. Almost 40% of baby foods sold in stores in the U.S. contain toxic pesticides, according to a 2023 study by the Environmental Working Group, an American non-profit environmental research and advocacy organization. The most common pesticide residues found in the baby foods were acetamiprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide that is known to be harmful to humans and bees, and captan, a fungicide of the phthalimide class that has been correlated to cancer. None of the organic baby foods tested in the same study were found to contain pesticides.

<doc id="877465" wikidata="Q976773" url="?curid=877465" title="Humberto Sousa Medeiros">
<text>Humberto Sousa Medeiros (October 6, 1915 – September 17, 1983) was a Portuguese-American clergyman of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Boston from 1970 until his death in 1983, and was created a cardinal in 1973. An ecclesiastical conservative, Cardinal Medeiros was considered a champion of the immigrant worker, the poor and minorities.

==Early life==
Humberto Sousa Medeiros was born in Arrifes, on the island of São Miguel, Azores, to Antonio Medeiros and Maria de Jesus Sousa Massa Flor. He was baptized in the parish of &quot;Nossa Senhora da Saúde&quot; on November 1, 1915. His father raised vegetables and ran a small variety store until 1931, when the family emigrated to the United States and settled in Fall River, Massachusetts. The family attended St. Michael&#x27;s Church, the local Portuguese parish.

Forced to leave school at age 16, Humberto swept floors in a local textile mill for 62 cents a day, studying English in his spare time. He was able to return to school in 1935, when his younger brothers became old enough to work to support the family. After graduating first in his class from B.M.C. Durfee High School in 1937, he entered the Catholic University of America. He became a naturalized citizen and obtained a Master of Philosophy degree in 1942 and a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1946.

==Priesthood==
Medeiros was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop James Edwin Cassidy on June 15, 1946. He then returned to the Diocese of Fall River, where he was assigned to St. John of God Church in Somerset. In 1949, he returned to Catholic University to pursue his doctoral studies. He earned a Doctor of Sacred Theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1952. After returning to Fall River, he was assigned to Holy Name Church and named assistant chancellor of the diocese. He later served as vicar for religious, vice-chancellor, and finally chancellor, during which time he was elevated to the title of Monsignor in 1958. He became pastor of St. Michael&#x27;s Church in 1960.

==Episcopal ministry==

===Bishop of Brownsville===
On April 14, 1966, Medeiros was appointed Bishop of Brownsville, Texas, by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal ordination on June 9 from Bishop James Louis Connolly, with bishops James Joseph Gerrard and Gerald Vincent McDevitt serving as co-consecrators, at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral.

His appointment to the Southern Texas diocese came at the time of a threatened farm workers&#x27; strike. Many of the lay faithful of the diocese were Mexican-American migrant workers. Medeiros was an advocate of workers, supporting their demands for a minimum wage at $1.25 an hour. He also became known as an outspoken opponent of capitalism, denouncing an economic system that &quot;considers profit the key motive for economic progress, competition the maximum law of economics, and private ownership of the means of production an absolute right that carries no corresponding social obligations.&quot;

Medeiros sold the episcopal limousine, converted all but one room of the episcopal residence into a dormitory for visiting priests, and often traveled with migrant workers to celebrate mass in the fields during the harvest season. He spent Christmas and Easter visiting prisoners in Texas jails. He also served as the chaplain of the Texas state council of the Knights of Columbus.

===Archbishop of Boston===
Medeiros was appointed Archbishop of Boston on September 8, 1970. He was installed on October 7 of that year. The appointment of Medeiros, a Portuguese-American, surprised Irish Catholics in Boston, since Irishmen had long dominated the local clergy and some Irish Catholics in Boston looked down on the Portuguese as &quot;third-class Catholics&quot;. In the days leading up to and following Medeiros&#x27; arrival, local Catholic institutions were targeted by vandals. In one instance a cross was burned on the lawn of the diocese&#x27;s chancery.

In 1971, Medeiros described abortion as &quot;the new barbarism&quot;. As in Brownsville, he continued advocating for the poor: his pastoral letter &quot;Man&#x27;s Cities, God&#x27;s Poor&quot; for Boston in 1972 reflected his passion for the poor. An opponent of the Vietnam War, Medeiros condemned the bombing of Hanoi in a 1972 Christmas homily.

Pope Paul VI created him Cardinal Priest of &quot;Santa Susanna&quot; in the consistory of March 5, 1973. Medeiros pleaded with the Vatican to lift the excommunication of Leonard Feeney, who disobeyed church authority and took a strict interpretation of the doctrine of &quot;Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus&quot;. In 1974, Medeiros refused to allow the baptism of the child of a Marlboro woman who supported the establishment of an abortion-information clinic. He strongly supported integration in the United States but not desegregation via busing. He refused to let parents enroll their children in parochial schools as a means of avoiding it. In May 1976, he spoke out against the racism in South Boston but apologized the following week. Medeiros served as a special papal envoy to the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima in Portugal in May 1977.

Medeiros was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II, respectively. Before the primaries for the 1980 congressional elections, Medeiros issued a pastoral letter that stated, &quot;Those who make abortion possible by law cannot separate themselves from the guilt which accompanies this horrendous crime and deadly sin.&quot; His words were considered to be directed at pro-choice candidates James Michael Shannon and Barney Frank, and criticized by some as violating the separation of church and state.

Medeiros transferred John Geoghan from parish to parish despite multiple credible accusations of sexual abuse. He knew of dozens of sexual abuse accusations against Paul Shanley.

Medeiros died from heart failure during open heart surgery in Boston, at age 67. He was laid to rest at his request with his parents in Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cemetery in his hometown of Fall River. Massachusetts Governor (and future Democratic presidential nominee) Michael Dukakis described him as a &quot;gentle, compassionate man&quot;.

==Legacy==
Two buildings in Medeiros&#x27; hometown of Fall River, MA are named after him. The Cardinal Medeiros Towers is a federal elderly &amp; disabled housing development. Adjacent to the (now-closed) Bishop Connolly High School, the Cardinal Medeiros Residence - a housing complex for retired Roman Catholic priests - is owned &amp; operated by the Diocese of Fall River.

The Cardinal Medeiros Trust fund was created in 1981 by the Texas Knights of Columbus State Council Charities in his honor to provide educational grants to families of Knights.

Boston College named the freshman honors dormitory &quot;Medeiros&quot; in his honor. Cardinal Medeiros Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is named after him.

The main auditorium of the Catholic University of Portugal&#x27;s campus in Lisbon is named in his honor. A statue on his honor was inaugurated in his home parish of Arrifes on 10 June 2000, at the Portugal Day.

<text>Kymco (an acronym for Kwang Yang Motor Co, Ltd ()) (stylized as &quot;KYMCO&quot;) is a Taiwanese motorcycle manufacturer headquartered in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. With approximately 3000 employees, Kymco produces over 570,000 vehicles annually at its factory in Kaohsiung. The company also has production facilities in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and PR China.

==History==
The company was founded in 1964. KYMCO originally made parts for Honda. The company built its first complete scooter in 1970 and began marketing under the &quot;KYMCO&quot; brand name in 1992. In the 2000s, Kymco became the largest scooter manufacturer in Taiwan, and the fifth largest scooter manufacturer worldwide. In early 2008, KYMCO was chosen by BMW to supply the engines for their G450 X Enduro bike. The optional range extender in the BMW i3 is also supplied by Kymco. In late 2013, Kawasaki announced that their new J300 scooter is manufactured in partnership with Kymco. It is based on a Kymco Downtown 300i.

==Kymco in the United States==
Kymco has its U.S. subsidiary KYMCO USA headquartered in Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States and sells its vehicles and products via 600 franchised dealerships located throughout the country. For the U.S. market, Kymco offers 10 scooters, eight side by sides, 14 ATVs and two small displacement motorcycles in its line of products. Kymco was the official Scooter and ATV for the NHRA and with Gray Motorsports primary sponsor of the 2014 NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series.

== Ionex Ecosystem ==
Ionex is an electric mobility ecosystem developed by Kymco in 2018, designed to enhance the adoption of electric scooters and motorcycles. Significantly expanded EICMA 2023, the Ionex program consists of three key components:

=== Ionex Energy Stations ===
These stations facilitate quick battery swapping, allowing riders to exchange depleted batteries for fully charged ones.

=== Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) ===
This model enables users to rent Ionex batteries, reducing concerns about battery ownership and health. When batteries degrade, they can be recycled and replaced with new ones, which lowers upfront costs for consumers.

=== Battery Metering Unit (BMU) ===
This unit standardizes battery technology across various manufacturers, allowing integration into different electric vehicle designs. It enables features like keyless start and over-the-air firmware updates.

<text>Duck&#x27;s Pool is a small depression set in a remote location in the southern half of Dartmoor, Devon, England at . It lies between the sources of the River Plym and the River Erme.

No record exists of it having been a water-filled pool although there is a suggestion that it was drained by tin miners. However, in all but the driest periods, the area is usually boggy, and may have a small amount of standing water. The name may be derived from the use of &quot;duck&quot; as a generic term for waterfowl.

At the end of the Pool there is the remains of a tinners&#x27; hut. Approximately downstream to the east are the remains of an old blowing house roughly by . A number of Dartmoor authors suggest that it may be the one recorded as being in use in the Forester&#x27;s Accounts of 1532. This working may have been responsible for the draining referred to above. The area from the Pool to the River Erme has been extensively worked by tinners.

In memory of Dartmoor author William Crossing a plaque and letterbox were placed at Duck&#x27;s Pool by some members of a walking club known as Dobson&#x27;s Moormen and other people in 1938.

<doc id="877471" wikidata="Q3536040" url="?curid=877471" title="Omaha kinship">
<text>Omaha kinship is the system of terms and relationships used to define family in Omaha tribal culture. Identified by Lewis Henry Morgan in his 1871 work &quot;Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family&quot;, the Omaha system is one of the six major kinship systems (Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha, and Sudanese) which he identified internationally.

==Kinship system==
In function, the system is extremely similar to the Crow system. But, whereas Crow groups are matrilineal, Omaha descent groups are characteristically patrilineal.

In this system, relatives are sorted according to their descent and their gender. Ego&#x27;s father and his brothers are merged and addressed by a single term, and a similar pattern is seen for Ego&#x27;s mother and her sisters. (Marriages take place among people of different &quot;gentes&quot; or clans in the tribe.)

Like most other kinship systems, Omaha kinship distinguishes between parallel and cross-cousins. While parallel cousins are merged by term and addressed the same as Ego&#x27;s siblings, cross-cousins are differentiated by generational divisions. On the maternal side, cross-cousins are raised a generation (making them Ego&#x27;s Mother&#x27;s Brother and Ego&#x27;s Mother), while those on the paternal side are lowered a generation (making them the generational equivalent of Ego&#x27;s Children).

The system is similar to that of Iroquois kinship. It uses bifurcate merging, but only the Iroquois system uses bifurcate merging as a label. In addition, Iroquois kinship is a matrilineal system.
==Usage==
The system is named for the Omaha, a Native American tribe historically located on the Northern Plains in present-day Nebraska. The Omaha system has been found among some indigenous groups of Mexico, the Mapuche people of Chile and Argentina, the Dani tribe of Indonesia, the Shona of Zimbabwe, the Igbo of Nigeria and is proposed to be reconstructuted for indoeuropean kinship.

<doc id="877472" wikidata="Q3404000" url="?curid=877472" title="Centre for Alternative Technology">
<text>The Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT) () is an eco-centre in Montgomeryshire, Powys, Wales dedicated to demonstrating and teaching sustainable development. CAT, despite its name, no longer concentrates its efforts exclusively on alternative technology, but provides information on all aspects of sustainable living. It is open to visitors, offers postgraduate degrees as well as shorter residential and one day courses, and publishes information on renewable energy, sustainable architecture, organic farming, gardening, and sustainable living. CAT also runs education programmes for schools and sells environmentally friendly items through its on-site shop, restaurant and mail order department.

==History==

CAT was founded by businessman-turned-environmentalist Gerard Morgan-Grenville, and opened in 1973 in the disused Llwyngwern slate quarry near Machynlleth (once served by the narrow-gauge Corris Railway), where it occupies a seven-acre (28,000 m2) site. The organisation was originally known as the &quot;National Centre for Alternative Technology&quot;. Inspiration for the early CAT pioneers included the then-recent books &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;, &quot;A Blueprint for Survival&quot;, and &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; as well as an aim to explore alternative ways of living.

CAT was previously aligned to the Urban Centre for Appropriate Technology (UCAT), which was based in Bristol and has since evolved into the Centre for Sustainable Energy.

David Lea and Pat Borer won the Gold Medal for Architecture at the National Eisteddfod of Wales of 2001 for their work on the AtEIC building at the CAT, and an RIBA Regional Award for the WISE building in 2011.

== Visitor centre ==
In 1975 a permanent exhibition opened in order to generate wider interest. The site with of interactive displays is the largest tourist attraction in the area. It is a registered charity.
The facilities and exhibits include: 
*the water-balanced CAT funicular, the Centre for Alternative Technology Railway
*solar, hydropower and wind power
*a low-energy house
*a site-wide electricity grid powered by renewable energy
*displays of organic gardening methods
*a hydraulic ram pump
*strawbale and rammed earth buildings
* Britain&#x27;s largest green bookshop
* Vegetarian/vegan restaurant
* Events, activities and courses that take place throughout the year

In 2023, the CAT announced that financial pressures had forced it to stop admitting walk-up day visitors, although it would continue to hold group visits and other events and courses.

== Education ==

The centre offers a range of short courses which are between a day and a week in length. Some of these courses are offered to the general public while others are accredited courses for professionals. CAT is involved with school education through training teachers, producing materials and offering special tours and materials on site.

The Centre includes a Graduate School of the Environment. It offers postgraduate courses in renewable energy, architecture and environmental studies.

Since 2008, the centre has run a Professional Diploma in Architecture course in &quot;Advanced Environmental and Energy Studies&quot;, which allows students to obtain an accredited Part II architectural qualification.

===Wales Institute for Sustainable Education===

In summer 2010, CAT inaugurated the Wales Institute for Sustainable Education (WISE), a large educational building designed as a case study of sustainable architecture. The building contains a lecture theatre and accommodation and demonstrates ecological building principles such as passive solar building design and heat recovery ventilation as well as low-impact building materials such as wood, hemp, lime and rammed earth. The external walls of the building are made from 500mm thick hempcrete, whereas the lecture theatre has 7.2m high walls made from 320t of rammed earth.

A building management system is used to monitor a wide variety of parameters inside the building, providing data for research projects by CAT&#x27;s sustainable architecture students. The building is used for teaching postgraduate degrees and short courses and is also available as a conference venue and exhibition space.

In 2010 the WISE building was awarded the first place in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 10 Buildings 2010&quot; and came fourth in &quot;The Guardian&quot; &quot;Top 10&quot; list of buildings for 2010. It received a Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Award in 2011.

== Energy ==

CAT originally relied on a collection of water, wind and solar power, but following power shortages it began to receive power from the National Grid. Shortly afterwards, in 2004, a large new wind turbine was built using funds generated by selling shares in the project to the community, Bro Dyfi Community renewables. From 2009 September onwards CAT has operated a microgrid system, which includes elements of on- and off-grid operation.

CAT gets its water from an existing man-made reservoir in the slate quarry in which it is based and processes its own sewage in its reedbeds.

== Regional impact ==
The presence of the Centre in the Dyfi Valley has brought an increased environmental emphasis to the area, which is now designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. In the nearest town, Machynlleth, CAT plc formerly operated a wholefood vegetarian café and a separate shop. Following the closure of CAT plc the CAT charity retained ownership of the vegetarian cafe but subsequently sold it to its workers. The cafe is now run as a private enterprise but continues to operate as a vegetarian cafe. The wholefood shop was closed, since the building was not owned by CAT. However a new wholefood shop, Dyfi Wholefoods, was opened by the staff who were made redundant. An industrial estate (the Dyfi Eco Park) near Machynlleth railway station houses the offices of Dulas Ltd, a renewable-energy company founded by ex-CAT employees.

Haddix enjoyed his best season in 1953, pitching for the Cardinals. He compiled a 20–9 record with 163 strikeouts, a 3.06 earned run average (ERA), 19 complete games, and six shutouts. After five-plus seasons with the Cardinals, Haddix was traded to the Phillies. He also pitched for Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, and finished his pitching career as an effective reliever with the Orioles.

Haddix picked up the Game Seven win in the 1960 World Series, pitching in relief when Pirates second baseman Bill Mazeroski’s walk-off home run earned Pittsburgh the title.

==Early life==
Haddix was born in Medway, Ohio, located just outside Springfield. He was nicknamed &quot;the Kitten&quot; in St. Louis for his resemblance to Harry &quot;The Cat&quot; Brecheen, a left-hander on the Cardinals during Haddix&#x27;s rookie campaign.

==Near-perfect game==

Haddix took a perfect game into the 13th inning against the Milwaukee Braves on May 26, 1959. He retired 36 consecutive batters in 12 innings, essentially relying on two pitches: fastball and slider. However, Braves pitcher Lew Burdette was also pitching a shutout, which was seriously jeopardized on only three occasions: the 3rd inning, when a Milwaukee base-running blunder negated three consecutive singles; the 9th, when Pittsburgh finally advanced a runner as far as third base; and the 10th, when Pirates pinch hitter Dick Stuart came within a few feet of a two-run homer.

A fielding error by third baseman Don Hoak ended the perfect game in the bottom of the 13th, with the leadoff batter for Milwaukee, Félix Mantilla, reaching first base. Mantilla then advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Eddie Mathews, which was followed by an intentional walk to Hank Aaron. Joe Adcock then hit an apparent home run, ending the no-hitter and the game. However, in the confusion, Aaron left the basepaths and was passed by Adcock for the second out and the Braves won 2–0. Eventually the hit was changed from a home run to a double by a ruling from National League (NL) president Warren Giles; ultimately, only Mantilla&#x27;s run counted, resulting in a final score of 1–0, but the Pirates and Haddix still lost.

Haddix&#x27;s -inning, one-hit complete game, against the team that had just represented the NL in the previous two World Series, is considered by many to be the best pitching performance in MLB history. Mazeroski later said of Haddix&#x27;s dominance in the game, &quot;Usually you have one or two great or spectacular defensive plays in these no-hitters. Not that night. It was the easiest game I ever played in.&quot;

After the game, Haddix received many letters of congratulations and support, as well as one from a Texas A&amp;M fraternity which read, in its entirety on university stationery, &quot;Dear Harvey, Tough shit.&quot; &quot;It made me mad&quot;, recounted Haddix, &quot;until I realized they were right. That&#x27;s exactly what it was.&quot;

In 1991, Major League Baseball changed the definition of a no-hitter to &quot;a game in which a pitcher or pitchers complete a game of nine innings or more without allowing a hit.&quot; This retroactively disqualified Haddix, which some had considered to have thrown a perfect game because he retired the first 27 batters in order. Despite his having thrown more perfect innings than anyone in a single game, Haddix&#x27;s game was taken off the lists of perfect games and no-hitters. Haddix&#x27;s response was &quot;It&#x27;s O.K. I know what I did.&quot;

In May 1989, Milwaukee&#x27;s Bob Buhl revealed that the Braves pitchers had been stealing signs from Pittsburgh catcher Smokey Burgess, who was exposing his hand signals due to a high crouch. From their bullpen, Braves pitchers repeatedly repositioned a towel to signal for a fastball or a breaking ball, the only two pitches Haddix used in the game. Despite this assistance, the Milwaukee offense managed just one hit. All but one Milwaukee hitter, Aaron, took the signals.

==Career overview==
Over his 14-year career, Haddix had a 136–113 record with 1,575 strikeouts, a 3.63 ERA, 99 complete games, 21 shutouts, 21 saves, and 2,235 innings pitched in 453 games (285 as a starter). He was in the spotlight in the 1960 World Series against the Yankees. After winning Game 5 as a starter, Haddix relieved late in Game 7 and was credited with the win when Bill Mazeroski hit his famous Series-ending walk-off home run. Haddix went 2–0 in the 1960 Series, with a 2.45 ERA.

In 1964, Haddix served solely as a relief pitcher for the Orioles, pitching 89⅔ innings, with five wins, ten saves, and a 2.31 ERA. He was the runner-up for the Gold Glove Award.

As a hitter, Haddix was better than average, posting a .212 batting average (169-for-798) with 95 runs, 37 doubles, 9 triples, 4 home runs, 64 RBI, 4 stolen bases and 46 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .957 fielding percentage which was the league average at his position.

Jim Palmer said he learned a lot about pitching from Haddix during the veteran&#x27;s time with the Orioles.

Haddix later followed his former teammate Harry Brecheen into the ranks of major league pitching coaches, working with the New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, and Pirates for 14 years spanning 1966 to 1984.

==Death==
A heavy smoker in his playing days, Haddix died from emphysema in 1994 in Springfield, Ohio, at the age of 68.

==Career highlights==
* 3-time All-Star (1953–1955)
* 3-time Gold Glove Award (1958–1960)
* Co-Player of the Month for May 1959
* Major League record, Most consecutive batters retired in one game (36) &quot;achieved on May 26, 1959&quot;

==Legacy==
Haddix Field, the Little League baseball park in New Carlisle, Ohio, is named for Haddix.

Haddix&#x27;s near-perfect game is memorialized by The Baseball Project, whose song, &quot;Harvey Haddix&quot;, appears on their debut album, &quot;Volume 1: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails&quot; (2008).

<text>The Second Congo War, also known as Africa&#x27;s World War or the Great War of Africa, was a major conflict that began on 2 August 1998 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, just over a year after the First Congo War. The war initially erupted when Congolese president Laurent-Désiré Kabila turned against his former allies from Rwanda and Uganda, who had helped him seize power. The conflict expanded as Kabila rallied a coalition of other countries to his defense. The war drew in nine African nations and approximately 25 armed groups, making it one of the largest wars in African history.

Although a peace agreement was signed in 2002, and the war officially ended on 18 July 2003 with the establishment of the Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, violence has persisted in various regions, particularly in the east, through ongoing conflicts such as the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army insurgency and the Kivu and Ituri conflicts.

The Second Congo War and its aftermath caused an estimated 5.4 million deaths, primarily due to disease and malnutrition, making it the deadliest conflict since World War II, according to a 2008 report by the International Rescue Committee. However, this figure has been disputed, with some researchers arguing that many of the deaths may have occurred regardless of the war and that the actual death toll was closer to 3 million. The conflict also displaced approximately 2 million people, forcing them to flee their homes or seek asylum in neighboring countries. Additionally, the war was heavily funded by the trade of conflict minerals, which continues to fuel violence in the region.

==Background==

===First Congo War===

The First Congo War began in 1996 as Rwanda increasingly expressed concern that Hutu members of Republican Rally for Democracy in Rwanda (RDR) militias were carrying out cross-border raids from what was then Zaire, and planning an invasion of Rwanda. These mostly Hutu militias had entrenched themselves in refugee camps in eastern Zaire, where many had fled to escape the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in the aftermath of 1994&#x27;s Rwandan genocide.

The Tutsi-dominated RPF government of Rwanda, which had gained power in July 1994, protested this as a violation of Rwandan territorial integrity, and began arming the ethnically Tutsi Banyamulenge of eastern Zaire. The Mobutu regime of Zaire vigorously denounced this intervention, though it possessed neither the military capability to halt it, nor the political capital to attract international assistance.

=== Kabila&#x27;s march to Kinshasa ===
With active support from Uganda, Rwanda, and Angola, the Tutsi forces of Laurent-Désiré Kabila moved methodically down the Congo River, encountering only light resistance from the poorly trained, ill-disciplined forces of Mobutu&#x27;s crumbling regime. The bulk of Kabila&#x27;s fighters were Tutsi – many of them veterans of various conflicts in the continent&#x27;s Great Lakes region. Kabila himself provided credibility, largely reflecting his long-time political opposition to Mobutu, and his role as a follower of Patrice Lumumba. Lumumba had been the first prime minister of the independent Congo, who had been executed by a combination of internal and external forces, in January 1961, ultimately being replaced by Mobutu in 1965. Kabila had declared himself a Marxist, and an admirer of Mao Zedong. He had been waging armed rebellion in eastern Zaire for more than three decades (though Che Guevara – in his account of the early years of the conflict – portrayed him as an uncommitted and uninspiring leader).

In December 1996, near the end of the Great Lakes refugee crisis, Kabila&#x27;s army began a slow movement west, taking control of border towns and mines and solidifying control. There were reports of massacres and of brutal repression by the rebel army. A UN human-rights investigator published statements from witnesses who claimed that Kabila&#x27;s Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFLC) had committed massacres, with the advancing army killing as many as 60,000 civilians. The ADFLC strenuously denied this claim. Roberto Garreton stated that his investigation in the town of Goma turned up allegations of disappearances, torture, and killings; he quoted , an aide to Mobutu, as saying that such casualties should be expected in wartime.

Kabila&#x27;s forces, with support of Rwanda, launched an offensive in earlier October 1996 in South Kivu, and demanded that the Kinshasa government surrender. The rebels took Kasenga on 27 March 1997. The government denied the rebels&#x27; success, starting a long pattern of false statements from the defense minister on the progress and conduct of the war. Negotiations were proposed in late March, and on 2 April a new Prime Minister of Zaire, Étienne Tshisekedi—a longtime rival of Mobutu—was installed. Kabila, by this point in control of roughly one-quarter of the country, dismissed this as irrelevant, and threatened Tshisekedi that if he accepted the post he would have no part in a new government.

The ADFLC made consistent progress in its advance from the east throughout April 1997, and by May its troops had reached the outskirts of Kinshasa. Mobutu fled Kinshasa on 16 May, and the &quot;libérateurs&quot; (i. e., liberators) entered the capital without serious resistance. Mobutu fled the country, and died in exile in Morocco, four months later. Kabila proclaimed himself president on 17 May 1997; immediately ordering a violent crackdown to restore order, and began attempting a reorganisation of the nation.

=== Unwelcome support from other African nations ===
When Kabila gained control of the capital in May 1997, he faced substantial obstacles to governing the country. He renamed the state, from Zaire, to Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In addition to political jostling among various groups seeking to gain power, and an enormous external debt, his foreign backers proved unwilling to leave when asked. The conspicuous Rwandan presence in the capital rankled many Congolese, who began to see Kabila as a pawn of foreign powers.

Tensions reached new heights on 14 July 1998, when Kabila dismissed his Rwandan chief of staff James Kabarebe, replacing him with a native Congolese, chief of staff Célestin Kifwa. Although this move chilled what was already a troubled relationship with Rwanda, Kabila softened the blow by making Kabarebe the military adviser to his successor.

Two weeks later, Kabila reversed to his previous decision, thanking Rwanda for its help, and ordering all Rwandan and Ugandan military forces to leave the country. Within 24 hours, Rwandan military advisers living in Kinshasa were unceremoniously flown out. Those most alarmed by this order were the Banyamulenge Tutsi of eastern Congo; their tensions with neighboring ethnic groups had been a contributing factor in the genesis of the First Congo War, and they were also used by Rwanda to affect events across the border in the DRC.

== Course of the war ==

=== 1998–1999 ===

On 2 August 1998, the Banyamulenge in Goma erupted into rebellion. Rwanda offered them immediate assistance, and early in August a well-armed rebel group, the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD)—composed primarily of Banyamulenge and backed by Rwanda and Uganda—emerged. This group quickly came to dominate the resource-rich eastern provinces, and based its operations in Goma. The RCD quickly took control of the towns of Bukavu and Uvira in the Kivus. The Tutsi-led Rwandan government allied with Uganda, and Burundi also retaliated, occupying a portion of northeastern Congo. To help remove the occupying Rwandans, President Kabila enlisted the aid of refugee Hutu in eastern Congo and began to agitate public opinion against the Tutsi, resulting in several public lynchings in the streets of Kinshasa. On 12 August a loyalist army major broadcast a message urging resistance from a radio station in Bunia in eastern Congo: &quot;People must bring a machete, a spear, an arrow, a hoe, spades, rakes, nails, truncheons, electric irons, barbed wire, stones, and the like, in order, dear listeners, to kill the Rwandan Tutsis.&quot;

The Rwandan government also challenged current borders by claiming a substantial part of eastern Congo as &quot;historically Rwandan&quot;. The Rwandans alleged that Kabila was organising a genocide against their Tutsi brethren in the Kivu region. The degree to which Rwandan intervention was motivated by a desire to protect the Banyamulenge, as opposed to using them as a smokescreen for its regional aspirations after ousting Mobutu, is still being debated.

In a bold move, Rwandan soldiers under the command of James Kabarebe hijacked three planes and flew them to the government base of Kitona on the Atlantic coast. The planes landed in the middle of the Kitona base, but the motley collection of troops there (ex-FAZ, but also Angolan UNITA elements and former Pascal Lissouba militiamen from Brazzaville) were in poor condition and in no condition to fight unless given food and weapons. They were quickly won over to the Rwandan side. More towns in the east and around Kitona fell in rapid succession, as the combined RCD, Rwandan and rebel soldiers overwhelmed government forces amid a flurry of ineffectual diplomatic efforts by various African nations. By 13 August, less than two weeks after the revolt had begun, rebels held the Inga hydroelectric station that provided power to Kinshasa as well as the port of Matadi through which most of Kinshasa&#x27;s food passed. The diamond center of Kisangani fell into rebel hands on 23 August and forces advancing from the east had begun to threaten Kinshasa by late August. Uganda, while retaining joint support of the RCD with Rwanda, also created a rebel group that it supported exclusively, the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC).

Despite the movement of the front lines, fighting continued throughout the country. Even as rebel forces advanced on Kinshasa, government forces continued to battle for control of towns in the east of the country. The Hutu militants with whom Kabila was co-operating were also a significant force in the east. Nevertheless, the fall of the capital and of Kabila, who had spent the previous weeks desperately seeking support from various African nations and Cuba, seemed increasingly certain.

The rebel offensive was abruptly reversed as Kabila&#x27;s diplomatic efforts bore fruit. The first African countries to respond to Kabila&#x27;s request for help were fellow members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). While officially the SADC members are bound to a mutual defence treaty in the case of outside aggression, many member nations took a neutral stance to the conflict. However, the governments of Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola supported the Kabila government after a meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, on 19 August. Two more nations joined the conflict for Kabila in the following weeks: Chad and Sudan.

A multisided war thus began. In September 1998, Zimbabwean forces flown into Kinshasa held off a rebel advance that reached the outskirts of the capital, while Angolan units attacked northward from its borders and eastward from the Angolan territory of Cabinda, against the besieging rebel forces. This intervention by various nations saved the Kabila government and pushed the rebel front lines away from the capital. However, it was unable to defeat the rebel forces, and the advance threatened to escalate into direct conflict with the national armies of Uganda and Rwanda. In November 1998 a new Ugandan-backed rebel group, the Movement for the Liberation of Congo, was reported in the north of the country. On 6 November Rwandan President Paul Kagame admitted for the first time that Rwandan forces were assisting the RCD rebels for security reasons, apparently after a request by Nelson Mandela to advance peace talks. On 18 January 1999, Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe agreed on a ceasefire at a summit at Windhoek, Namibia but the RCD was not invited. Fighting thus continued.

Outside of Africa, most states remained neutral, but urged an end to the violence.

=== 1999–2000 ===

On 5 April 1999, tensions within the RCD about the dominance of the Banyamulenge reached a boiling point when RCD leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba moved his base from Goma to Uganda-controlled Kisangani to head a breakaway faction known as RCD-Kisangani, which later became The Forces for Renewal. A further sign of a break occurred when President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Kabila signed a ceasefire accord on 18 April in Sirte, Libya, following the mediation of Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, but both the RCD and Rwanda refused to take part.

On 16 May Wamba was ousted as head of the RCD in favour of a pro-Rwanda figure, Dr. Emile Ilunga. Seven days later the various factions of the RCD clashed over control of Kisangani. On 8 June rebel factions met to try to create a common front against Kabila. Despite these efforts, the occupying armed forces of Uganda recreated the province of Ituri, based on the province of Kibali-Ituri which previously existed from 1962 to 1966 in the Republic of the Congo. Perceived favoritism to the ethnic Hema by the Ugandan forces sparked the ethnic clash of the Ituri conflict, sometimes referred to as a &quot;war within a war&quot;.

Nevertheless, diplomatic circumstances contributed to the first ceasefire of the war. In July 1999 the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement was signed by the six warring countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Uganda) and, on 1 August, the MLC (the RCD refused to sign until 31 August). Under the terms of the agreement, forces from all sides, under a Joint Military Commission, would co-operate in tracking, disarming and documenting all armed groups in the Congo, especially those forces identified with the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

Few provisions, however, were made to actually disarm the militias. The United Nations Security Council deployed about 90 liaison personnel in August 1999 to support the ceasefire. However, in the following months all sides accused the others of repeatedly breaking the cease-fire, and it became clear that small incidents could trigger attacks.

Tensions between Uganda and Rwanda escalated as units of the Uganda People&#x27;s Defense Force and the Rwandan Patriotic Army clashed in Kisangani on the morning of 7 August. Fighting broke out again between the two armies on the evening of 14 August; fighting occurred throughout much of Kisangani, including in the airport and on major roads. The conflict lasted until 17 August, when a ceasefire was called that day. Both sides used heavy weapons during these clashes. As reported by the International Crisis Group, the fighting was a result of differences over the objectives and strategies used during the war.B

In November government-controlled television in Kinshasa claimed that Kabila&#x27;s army had been rebuilt and was now prepared to fulfil its &quot;mission to liberate&quot; the country. Rwandan-supported rebel forces launched a major offensive and approached Kinshasa but were eventually repelled.

By 24 February 2000, the UN authorised a force of 5,537 troops, the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (known by the French acronym, MONUC), to monitor the cease-fire. However, fighting continued between rebels and government forces and between Rwandan and Ugandan forces. Numerous clashes and offensives occurred throughout the country, most notably heavy fighting between Uganda and Rwanda in Kisangani in May and June 2000.

On 9 August 2000 a government offensive in Equateur Province along the Ubangi River was repulsed near Libenge by MLC forces. Military operations and diplomatic efforts made by the UN, African Union and Southern African Development Community failed to make any headway.

=== 2001 ===

==== Assassination of Laurent-Désiré Kabila ====


On 16 January 2001, Laurent-Désiré Kabila was shot and killed at the Palais de Marbre in Kinshasa. The government initially stated that Kabila was wounded but still alive when he was flown to Zimbabwe for intensive care. The circumstances of his assassination are unclear, and have been the subject of considerable rumours and disagreements. The consensus is that Kabila was shot by one of his bodyguards, the 18-year-old Rashidi Mizele, a &quot;kadogo&quot; (child soldier). Mizele had previously been misidentified as Rashidi Kasereka.

Two days later the government announced on state television that the desperate attempt by Zimbabwean medical personnel to save Kabila had failed and that Kabila had died from his wounds. His remains were returned for a state funeral on 26 January 2001.

Shortly after the assassination, the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; published a story in which self-identified assassination plotters revealed documents and details of the plot to murder Kabila. The plotters were mainly &quot;kadogos&quot; who had been under Kabila&#x27;s command since 1996, and were aggrieved over their poor treatment. The catalyst for the assassination appeared to be the execution of 47 &quot;kadogos&quot; accused of plotting against Kabila. The execution, witnessed by Kabila, took place the day before his assassination.

While the role of the disgruntled &quot;kadogos&quot; is relatively well-established, there have been some attempts to argue that they were under the influence of external actors who sought to overthrow Kabila. Some Congolese officials attempted to implicate their principal enemies by alleging that the Rwandans masterminded the operation. Some observers have lent credibility to these allegations, including Al-Jazeera&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Murder in Kinshasa&quot;, which alleges that a Lebanese diamond dealer allegedly organised the logistics of the organisation. Others have speculated that the Angolans (due to Kabila&#x27;s complicity in helping the Angolan rebel group UNITA channel funds through the DRC) or even the Americans were involved in the assassination. There is, as yet, no proof that Mizele or the &quot;kadogos&quot; were acting under orders from an external source.

==== Joseph Kabila becomes president ====
By unanimous vote of the Congolese parliament, his son, Joseph Kabila, was sworn in as president to replace him. That he won the election was largely due to Robert Mugabe&#x27;s backing, and the fact that most parliamentarians had been handpicked by the elder Kabila. In February, the new president met Rwandan President Paul Kagame in the United States. Rwanda, Uganda, and the rebels agreed to a UN pullout plan. Uganda and Rwanda began pulling troops back from the front line.
Joseph Kabila has been described as &quot;a more adept political leader than his father&quot;. As Chris Talbot notes, an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; &quot;favourably contrasted Joseph Kabila – Western-educated and English-speaking – with his father.&quot; The author of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; article writes that Joseph Kabila gave diplomats &quot;hope that things have changed&quot;, in contrast to Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who &quot;stood as the major impediment to a peaceful settlement of the war launched in August 1998 to unseat him.&quot; A peace accord Laurent signed in the summer of 1999, the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, &quot;remained unfulfilled largely because he kept staging new offensives while blocking deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in government-held territory.&quot; To compare, according to an analyst from the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit, &quot;The only obstruction had been Kabila because the [Lusaka] accord called for the government&#x27;s democratic transition and that was a threat to his power.&quot;

==== UN investigates illegal exploitation of minerals ====
In April 2001, a UN panel of experts investigated the illegal exploitation of diamonds, cobalt, coltan, gold and other lucrative resources in the Congo. The report accused Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe of systematically exploiting Congolese resources and recommended the Security Council impose sanctions.

=== 2002 ===
In 2002, Rwanda&#x27;s situation in the war began to worsen. Many members of the RCD either gave up fighting or decided to join Kabila&#x27;s government. Moreover, the Banyamulenge, the backbone of Rwanda&#x27;s militia forces, became increasingly tired of control from Kigali and the unending conflict. A number of them mutinied, leading to violent clashes between them and Rwandan forces.

At the same time, the western Congo was becoming increasingly secure under the younger Kabila. International aid was resumed as inflation was brought under control.

In March, the RCD-Goma faction captured Moliro, a town located on the coast of Lake Tanganyika, from government forces. According to said faction, the town was shelled by government gunboats the following day in response. The capture was seen as a violation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement.

==== Peace agreements (April–December 2002) ====
Under the leadership of South Africa, peace talks held in that country between April and December 2002 led to the signing of a &quot;comprehensive peace agreement.&quot; The Sun City Agreement was formalised on 19 April 2002. It was a framework for providing the Congo with a unified, multiparty government and democratic elections. However, critics noted that there were no stipulations regarding the unification of the army, which weakened the effectiveness of the agreement. There were several reported breaches of the Sun City agreement, but it has seen a reduction in the fighting.
On 30 July 2002, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a peace deal known as the Pretoria Accord after five days of talks in Pretoria, South Africa. The talks centered on two issues. One was the withdrawal of the estimated 20,000 Rwandan soldiers in the Congo. The other was the rounding up of the ex-Rwandan soldiers and the dismantling of the Hutu militia known as Interahamwe, which took part in Rwanda&#x27;s 1994 genocide and continues to operate out of eastern Congo. Rwanda had previously refused to withdraw until the Hutu militias were dealt with.

Signed on 6 September, the Luanda Agreement formalised peace between Congo and Uganda. The treaty aimed to get Uganda to withdraw its troops from Bunia and to improve the relationship between the two countries, but implementation proved troublesome. Eleven days later, the first Rwandan soldiers were withdrawn from the eastern DRC. On 5 October Rwanda announced the completion of its withdrawal; MONUC confirmed the departure of over 20,000 Rwandan soldiers.

On 21 October, the UN published its expert panel&#x27;s report on the pillage of natural resources by armed groups. Both Rwanda and Uganda rejected accusations that senior political and military figures were involved in illicit trafficking of plundered resources. Zimbabwe Defense Minister Sydney Sekeramayi says the Zimbabwean military withdrew from the DRC in October 2002, but in June 2006 reporters said a 50-man force had stayed in the DRC to protect Kabila.

On 17 December 2002, the Congolese parties of the Inter Congolese Dialogue (the national government, the MLC, the RCD, the RCD-ML, the RCD-N, the domestic political opposition, representatives of civil society and the Mai Mai) signed the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement. The agreement described a plan for transitional governance that would have result in legislative and presidential election within two years of its signing and marked the formal end of the Second Congo War.

=== Pygmy genocide (2002–2003) ===
At the end of 2002 through January 2003, around 60,000 Pygmy civilians and 10,000 combatants were killed in an extermination campaign known as &quot;Effacer le tableau&quot; by the Movement for the Liberation of Congo. Human rights activists have made demands for the massacre to be recognized as a genocide.

=== 2003 onwards: Transitional Government ===
On 18 July 2003, the Transitional Government came into being as specified in the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement out of the warring parties. The agreement obliges the parties to carry out a plan to reunify the country, disarm and integrate the warring parties and hold elections. There were numerous problems, resulting in continued instability in much of the country and a delay in the scheduled national elections from June 2005 to July 2006.

The main cause for the continued weakness of the Transitional Government is the refusal by the former warring parties to give up power to a centralised and neutral national administration. Some belligerents maintained administrative and military command-and-control structures separate from that of the Transitional Government, but as the International Crisis Group has reported, these have gradually been reduced. A high level of official corruption siphoning money away from civil servants, soldiers and infrastructure projects causes further instability.

On 30 July 2006 the first elections were held in the DRC after the populace approved a new constitution. A second round was held on 30 October.

== Foreign supporters of the Congo government ==

=== Zimbabwe ===
Robert Mugabe&#x27;s administration dispatched elements of the Zimbabwe National Army to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1998. Mugabe, perhaps the most ardent supporter of intervention on Kabila&#x27;s behalf, was the only major player involved in the conflict able to marshal a reasonably modern and experienced air force. Zimbabwe&#x27;s military was also regarded as being one of the more well-equipped and professional of the region; being the decisive factor in the outcome of the war and exhibiting outstanding tactical proficiency.

Zimbabwean strategy revolved around defending the person of Laurent Kabila only with allied forces, as Congolese forces were thought to be unreliable, then retake important settlements, and expel the rebels from the Kinshasa region. Mugabe&#x27;s initial buildup in Kinshasa consisted of special forces along with some paratroops, reportedly numbering between 600 and 1,000. By August 1998, two more battalions had been dispatched. They were accompanied by some Soviet-manufactured T-54/55 tanks, Crocodile armoured personnel carriers, and EE-9 Cascavel scout cars flown into the capital on Angolan Air Force planes. The contingent grew to 3,800 around November, and peaked at 12,000 in January 2001. The Zimbabweans began leaving in 2002 and had completely withdrawn by the end of the year. Prior to this deployment, Zimbabwe had built up an apparently potent brigade-sized, combined arms, reaction force with efficient air support and professional competence; however the prolonged operations in the Congo are said to have damaged its credibility.

The Air Force of Zimbabwe made particularly effective use of its air power, hitting rebel and Rwandan offensives on Mbuji-Mayi with repeated strikes by BAE Hawks and Hawker Hunters. It also sustained heavy losses during the conflict, including three of its six Mil Mi-24 Hind helicopters, a transport aircraft, and an unidentified interceptor, probably a Chinese Chengdu J-7. Despite the effectiveness of its highly mobile, big-gunned Eland-90 and Cascavel armoured cars, Zimbabwean ground forces also lost a significant number, either captured or destroyed by the rebel coalition.

=== Namibia ===
Under the direction of President Sam Nujoma, Namibia became involved in the Congo on behalf of its commitment to the Southern African Development Community. Nujoma, a longtime ally of Kabila, claimed he could not refuse the requests for military assistance from Zimbabwe and Angola. In February 1999, Namibian Defence Force personnel in the Congo were organised around a infantry battalion group with staff, artillery, logistics support and a flight of Allouette Helicopters and Y-12 transport aircraft from the Namibian Air Force. Between 2000 and 2001, this figure may have fluctuated between 1,600 and 2,000 by which point 30 servicemen had been killed in action and the war effort was costing Namibia $150,000 a day.

The Namibian intervention was greeted with intense criticism by opposition parties, as well as neighboring South Africa and several Western donors. The European Union expressed concern that Nujoma was misusing his country&#x27;s development funds for the Congo expedition, and individual member states—including Finland—cut off financial aid. A furious diplomatic row also ensued with South African authorities after they suspended all outgoing military exports to the NDF.

=== Angola ===
The Angolan government had fought against Mobutu Sésé Seko in the First Congo War because of his support for rebel UNITA in the Angolan Civil War. The Angolan government wanted to eliminate UNITA operations in southern Congo, which exchanged diamonds extracted from rebel-held Angola for foreign weapons. Angola had no confidence that a new president would be more effective than Kabila and feared that continued fighting would lead to a power vacuum that could only help UNITA. The intervention of the experienced Angolan forces was essential in deciding the outcome of both wars.

=== Chad ===
Kabila had originally discounted the possibility of support from &quot;Françafrique&quot; (Francophone Africa) but after a summit meeting in Libreville, Gabon, on 24 September, Chad agreed to send 2,000 troops. France had encouraged Chad to join as a means of regaining influence in a region where the French had retreated after the 1994 genocide committed against Tutsi in Rwanda. Nevertheless, Chadian intervention resulted in a fiasco. Its forces were accused of serious human rights violations and looting, virtually from their arrival in the country. They withdrew very quickly under international and national pressure and opprobrium.

=== Sudan ===
Unconfirmed reports in September 1999 indicated that forces of the government of Sudan were fighting rebels in Orientale Province, close to the Sudanese and Ugandan borders. However, Sudan did not establish a significant military presence inside the DRC, though it continued to offer extensive support to three Ugandan rebel groups—the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army, the Uganda National Rescue Front II and the Allied Democratic Forces—in retaliation for Ugandan support for the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

==Aftermath and legacy==
===Areas of continuing conflict===

The fragility of the state has allowed continued violence and human rights abuses in the east. There are three significant centres of conflict:
* North and South Kivu, where a weakened FDLR continues to threaten the Rwandan border and the Banyamulenge, where Rwanda supports RCD-Goma rebels against Kinshasa (see Kivu conflict), and where local conflicts continue to fuel violence;
* Ituri, where MONUC / MONUSCO has proved unable to contain the numerous militia and groups driving the Ituri conflict;
* Northern Katanga, where Mai-Mai Militias slipped out of the control of Kinshasa (see Katanga insurgency).

The ethnic violence between Hutu- and Tutsi-aligned forces has been a driving impetus for much of the conflict, with people on both sides fearing their annihilation. The Kinshasa- and Hutu-aligned forces enjoyed close relations as their interests in expelling the armies and proxy forces of Uganda and Rwanda dovetail.

While the Uganda- and Rwanda-aligned forces worked closely together to gain territory at the expense of Kinshasa, competition over access to resources created a fissure in their relationship. There were reports that Uganda permitted Kinshasa to send arms to the Hutu FDLR via territory held by Uganda-backed rebels as Uganda, Kinshasa and the Hutu are all seeking, in varying degrees, to check the influence of Rwanda and its affiliates.

===Rwanda and Ugandan backing of rebels===

Rwanda backed rebels due to fears of Hutu rebels on its border. The Kinshasa government was suspicious of Kigali&#x27;s influence over the region, as Rwanda has occupied the area numerous times and some witnesses confirm that Rwanda has profited from the looting of Congolese minerals. Consequently, Rwanda allegedly supported the continuing rebellion of General Nkunda in Congo. Nkunda was, however, arrested by Rwandan police in 2009. The DRC sought assurance that Kigali aligned forces have no conflict-mineral or territorial interests in eastern Congo.

On 19 December 2005 the United Nations International Court of Justice ruled that the DRC&#x27;s sovereignty had been violated by Uganda, and that DRC had lost billions of dollars worth of resources. The DRC government has asked for $10 billion in compensation. Though the ICJ has taken many steps to ensure that war crimes and crimes against humanity will be prosecuted, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank rewarded both Uganda and Rwanda with debt relief packages for improving their economic health during a time when much of their increased revenue was partially a direct result of illegally importing conflicted minerals from the DRC. In this case, international institutions such as the IMF and WB are allegedly at odds with international laws and charters. Both the IMF and WB have been accused of helping to facilitate the conflict in the DRC by rewarding combatants.

=== Economic impact ===
The deteriorated infrastructure and constant threat of attacks made overland travel impossible, causing internal trade in Congo to come to a standstill. On the Congo River, the most important remaining transport route, there was no ship traffic between the different power regions for years. Isolated villages were cut off from urban markets, while cities suffered from food shortages. In Kinshasa, food prices quadrupled within a year. International aid arrived only sparingly. Initially, it was mainly limited to Kinshasa and it was not until 2001 that it reached the actual war zones in the east.

The impoverishment of the population worsened further. A 2006 study by the Congolese government, three years after the end of the war, revealed that 76% of the population could not send their children to school, 79% were malnourished, 81% did not have adequate housing, and 82% had no access to medical care. Overall, 71% of the population lived in absolute poverty, 85% in the poorest province of Équateur. According to aid organizations, in 2000, 31% of Kinshasa&#x27;s residents were chronically malnourished and only 10% could afford three meals a day. In 2003, the average food intake of the population was 1300 kilocalories per day. The health system was largely destroyed and, reportedly, 500,000 people died of malaria each year, more than a third of them children under five years old.

==== Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe ====

Zimbabwean involvement in the war had a significant negative impact on the country&#x27;s economy. As hardware losses multiplied, Western donors—including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank—placed their aid programmes to Harare under review, denying Mugabe the foreign currency he needed to buy spare parts valued at $600 million for fighting vehicles then employed in the Congo. Between January and June 2000, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported (via a leaked memo from Minister of Finance Herbert Murerwa) that Zimbabwe spent $166 million on its military ventures there. These factors contributed to the country&#x27;s severe economic instability during the 2000s, culminating in a period of hyperinflation between 2007 and 2009.

=== Environmental impact ===
The war has caused substantial environmental damage. The forests of Congo are a major biodiversity hotspot, housing The Congo Basin which is widely known as the second greatest tropical rain forest in the world and the largest forest in Africa.

====Animals and bushmeat trade====

On account of the war the Democratic Republic of Congo saw their elephant population halve in size, their hippo population go from 22,000 to 900 and their great ape population decrease by 77–93% between 1998 and 2015.

With up to 3.4 million people being displaced in Congo as a result of the civil war, many moved into Congo&#x27;s forests, where they hunted bonobos, gorillas, elephants and more as bushmeat for survival and cleared forest land that were significant habitats for these many animals. Many of these individuals were either from the city where the hunting of certain animals was not a taboo or locals who had their tradition slowly broken down because of their need to survive. One such example had been the Bongando people in which a 2009 study by Kyoto University had observed a disintegration of their cultural interdiction of eating bonobos as influenced by the civil war. During the conflict many of the front lines were located within bonobos reserves, further contributing to the decline in their population.

Government instability and the lack of government enforcement allowed new illegal militia mining camps to form which located themselves deep within Congo&#x27;s forest. There, bushmeat became the main source of food. On top of that, the mass number of people entering the forests in conjunction with the mines&#x27; unsanitary conditions introduced an increased risk of disease for animals such as gorillas. The government instability and the dangers of war also ceased much of the conservation and protection efforts occurring in Congo at the time, enabling the numerous rampant rebel groups present in Congo to openly partake in poaching.

Military assistance having been obstructed by surrounding African countries, Congo was pushed into entering numerous lumber leases with German, Chinese and Malaysian corporations to uphold their military activities. The roads emerging to support the new logging efforts opened nearby villages to receive easier means of transportation and access to deeper parts of Congo&#x27;s wildlife reserves. The result was a significant increase in bushmeat sales in villages near these logging sites.

The potential threat of rebel forces during the war caused many military officers controlling urban trade to leave their post. This created an open access market in the bushmeat and pet trade that was then undertaken by exploitative lower ranked soldiers looking for profit. The result was an observed quintuple increase of protected animal sales in urban markets in north-eastern parts of Congo around Garamba National Park. Meanwhile, in other northern parts of Congo, researchers in other studies have found a 23% increase in protected animal sales with the overall pattern being a significant increase in protected animal sales.

====Deforestation====

The war resulted in a loss of 1.3% of Congo&#x27;s forests, a size comparable to Belgium.

The millions of displaced individuals led to large-scale logging and deforestation to create arable land. These activities had an outsized effect due to the edge effect as a result of the forest fragmentation.

The Virunga National Park, Africa&#x27;s oldest national park, became the first endangered UN World Heritage Site. Its flora was cleared during both the first and second Congo war to make way for both the Rwandan and Congolese army.

=== Dispute over death toll ===
The Human Security Report Project (HSRP) of Simon Fraser University has challenged the toll of 5.4 million war-related deaths between 1998 and 2008. It states that of the IRC&#x27;s five periodic estimates, two that cover a period from 1998 to 2001 are flawed, and the reported 2.6 million deaths therein should not be included in the total death toll. The other three periodic IRC estimates cover a period from May 2001 – April 2007, and in which 2.83 million of the total 5.4 million deaths were reported. The HSRP argued that the estimates were built on a general death rate that was far too low for Congo, and that most of those people would have most likely died anyway. Thus, the IRC figure should be revised to 860,000 total war-related excess deaths.

In response to the criticism from HSRP, one of the authors of the IRC report argued the following: Although there may have been small statistical discrepancies in the original study, the IRC report had been widely peer-reviewed and was judged to be an accurate estimate of the war-related excess deaths.

<doc id="877494" wikidata="Q1346122" url="?curid=877494" title="José Bautista">
<text>José Antonio Bautista Santos (born October 19, 1980), nicknamed &quot;Joey Bats&quot;, is a Dominican former professional baseball right fielder and third baseman who played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily for the Toronto Blue Jays. Bautista also played for the Baltimore Orioles, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Kansas City Royals, Pittsburgh Pirates, Atlanta Braves, New York Mets, and Philadelphia Phillies.

The Pirates selected Bautista in the 20th round of the 2000 MLB draft. He played for four different clubs before joining the Blue Jays in . In , he became the 26th member of the 50 home run club, while leading MLB in home runs for the first of two consecutive seasons. From 2010–, Bautista hit more home runs than any player in the major leagues. An MLB All-Star selection six consecutive times, he won three Silver Slugger Awards and two Hank Aaron Awards. In addition, he received the American League (AL) Player of the Month Award five times, and the AL Player of the Week four times. Before being traded to the Blue Jays, Bautista primarily played third base.

Although major league scouts initially took note of Bautista while he was in junior college for his batting skills – including power hitting potential and a strong throwing arm – his career would take many detours, until Bautista finally realized his potential, in 2010. He made his MLB debut with the Baltimore Orioles in , and, that year, became the first player ever to appear on five MLB rosters in one season. The last of those clubs was the Pirates, where he would spend four-plus seasons, seeing time as a utility player, while playing at six different positions, including designated hitter (DH).

Bautista was then traded to the Blue Jays, in August . After making adjustments to his swing, he broke through with ten home runs in September . Bautista was voted in the top ten in the AL Most Valuable Player Award four times, and is a leader or among the top ten in numerous offensive single-season and career categories in Blue Jays&#x27; franchise history.

From 2010 to , Bautista hit at least 20 home runs each year, and in four of those seasons, hit at least 35 home runs, both scored and drove in at least 100 runs, and drew at least 100 bases on balls, including twice leading the AL. In , while playing in the playoffs for the first time, his bat flip in the American League Division Series (ALDS) caused a sensation that became a symbol of Toronto&#x27;s first playoff appearance in 22 years. In , Bautista set up a program that assists athletes from the Dominican Republic to attend universities in the United States.

==Early life==
Coming from a middle-class family in the Dominican Republic that placed great importance on education, Bautista began studying English at age eight. His mother was an accountant and financial planner, and his father, who had earned a master&#x27;s degree in agricultural engineering in Hungary, ran poultry farms. Bautista attended a private high school, De La Salle High School, in Santo Domingo. He was aided by the Latin Athletes Education Fund, designed for players from Spanish-speaking countries aspiring to play college baseball in the United States. Although he invested much time in pursuing professional baseball, Bautista studied business at Mother and Teacher Pontifical Catholic University in the event a career in baseball did not materialize.

After working out with various Major League Baseball (MLB) clubs, he turned down offers of $5,000 from the New York Yankees and $42,000 from the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Cincinnati Reds offered him $300,000, which Bautista accepted; however, before the contract could become official, the team changed ownership and subsequently rescinded the offer. Bautista then created a highlight tape of himself using a camcorder and sent it to various colleges in the United States. There was no response until he received a call from Oscar Pérez, whom he had known from the Quique Cruz League in the Dominican Republic. Pérez informed him of the Latin Athletes Education Fund, designed for players from Spanish-speaking countries aspiring to play college baseball in the United States. He connected Bautista with Don Odermann, a businessman in the San Francisco Bay Area. Odermann, who assisted baseball players from Latin America desiring to play baseball in the US, knew that Chipola College, a junior college in Marianna, Florida, was seeking an everyday player. There, Bautista played for two years until being drafted.

==Professional career==
===Early career===
The Pittsburgh Pirates drafted Bautista in the 20th round (599th overall) of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Pirates for a $500,000 signing bonus. Bautista played for the Williamsport Crosscutters of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn League in 2001 and the Hickory Crawdads of the Class A South Atlantic League in 2002. In 2003, he played for the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League.

After the 2003 season, the Baltimore Orioles selected Bautista in the Rule 5 draft and carried him on their Opening Day roster. He made his MLB debut with Baltimore on April 4, 2004. After playing 16 games with the Orioles, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays claimed him off waivers on June 3. Twenty-five days later, the Kansas City Royals purchased him from Tampa Bay after a 12-game stint with the Devil Rays. He played 13 games for the Royals before they traded him to the New York Mets on July 30 for Justin Huber, who then traded him minutes later to Pittsburgh with Ty Wigginton and minor leaguer Matt Peterson for Kris Benson and Jeff Keppinger. This series of transactions made him the first player to appear on five different Major League Baseball rosters in one season, only since matched by Oliver Drake in 2018. (Drake, however, actually played for all five teams, while Bautista only played for four; he never actually suited up or played for the Mets.)

Bautista played in 11 games for the Pirates in 2005. In 2006, his first full season in the major leagues, Bautista hit .235 with 16 home runs (HR) and 51 runs batted in (RBI). The following season in 2007, he posted similar numbers in 142 games, finishing the season with a batting average of .254, 15 home runs and 63 RBI. That same year, he became the starting third baseman for the Pirates. He took over for reigning National League batting champion Freddy Sanchez, who moved to second base.

Bautista was to be the Pirates&#x27; starting third baseman and backup outfielder in 2008. From June 14 to 24, he hit five home runs in a span of nine games against interleague opponents Baltimore, Chicago White Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, and the New York Yankees. However, he struggled offensively for most of the year, and after the 2008 trade deadline Bautista lost his starting job to the newly acquired Andy LaRoche. Bautista was optioned to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians on August 13.
===Toronto Blue Jays===
====2008====
On August 21, 2008, the Pirates traded Bautista to the Blue Jays for a player to be named later, who eventually was Robinzon Díaz. The Blue Jays needed a third baseman due to an injury to Scott Rolen. Bautista batted .214 with three home runs and 10 RBI in 21 games for Toronto after the trade.

====2009====

Starting the 2009 season on the bench, manager Cito Gaston assigned Bautista to back up Rolen and outfielders Alex Ríos and Adam Lind. Bautista started the season with a .317 batting average, .404 on-base percentage (OBP) and .463 slugging percentage (SLG) in 49 plate appearances in April. However, his numbers fell off, as he batted between .167 and .231 each month from May through August with two total home runs. At times he showed marked plate discipline; in the month of May, he walked 14 times for a .403 OBP despite batting just .231. Eventually, the Chicago White Sox claimed Rios off waivers, the Blue Jays assigned Lind to the role of designated hitter, and an injury to Marco Scutaro led to an increase in Bautista&#x27;s playing time and making him the leadoff hitter.

As the season drew to a close, the Blue Jays made changes to their coaching staff. One was to move first base coach Dwayne Murphy to replace the retiring Gene Tenace as hitting coach. Formerly a Blue Jays&#x27; minor league roving hitting instructor and hitting coach, Murphy had already spent nearly one year working with Bautista, teaching him to leverage his pull power by starting his swing with his now-familiar high leg kick. In September and October, he finally broke through, hitting 10 home runs with 21 RBI, a .257 batting average and a .606 slugging percentage (SLG). He hit 13 total home runs in 2009 with 40 RBI, a batting average of .235, and 79 hits in 113 games. Originally considered to be a non-tender candidate, he re-signed with the Blue Jays on a one-year, $2.4 million US contract for the 2010 season.

====2010====
Bautista began the 2010 campaign as the starting right fielder and leadoff hitter. On May 17, he was named AL Player of the Week after hitting .444 (8-for-18) with 20 total bases, four home runs, eight RBI, eight runs scored, a .565 OBP, and an MLB-best 1.111 SLG. Bautista hit his 20th home run as part of a two-home run night against the St. Louis Cardinals on June 22, setting a new career high for a single season in just two months.

Bautista was selected as a reserve for the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Bautista entered the game as a pinch runner for Josh Hamilton and finished the game 0-for-1.

For the month of July, Bautista batted .347, with 11 home runs, 29 RBI, and an AL-leading .765 slugging percentage, sharing American League Player of the Month honors with Twins outfielder Delmon Young. Bautista was also named Blue Jays&#x27; Player of the Month, which is selected through voting by the Toronto chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. With his 12 home runs in May and 11 in July, Bautista became only the third Blue Jay player in franchise history to have two months with at least 10 home runs.

Bautista was named co-winner of the American League Player of the Week award for the period ending August 1. Bautista hit .545 with five homers and 13 RBI during that span. On August 26, Bautista hit his 100th career home run against the Detroit Tigers. Bautista was again named player of the week for the week ending August 29; in seven games that week, Bautista led the American League with a .500 batting average (10-for-20) and hit four home runs. Bautista became the only Blue Jays player to ever win the award three times in one season. Bautista won AL Player of the Month for the month of August, in which he hit he led the AL in home runs (12), RBI (24), slugging percentage (.724) and total bases (72), while tying for the lead in extra-base hits (18). He finished tied for second with 23 runs and was third with 23 walks. He also won the Honda Player of the Month Award, his second such award in as many months.

On September 17, Bautista set the new Blue Jays single-season home run record with his 48th home run, breaking the record set by George Bell. On September 23, Bautista became the 26th player in Major League Baseball history to reach the 50 home run club in one season, and the first Blue Jays player to do so. His 52nd home run set a new MLB record for the largest single-season increase in home runs, eclipsing Davey Johnson&#x27;s 38 home run increase from 1972 to 1973. Bautista finished the 2010 season with an MLB-leading 54 home runs, the highest total since Alex Rodriguez hit 54 in 2007. Bautista won the AL Hank Aaron Award and a Silver Slugger Award, awards for his offensive performance, and finished fourth in the AL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting, behind Hamilton, Miguel Cabrera and Robinson Canó. The Toronto chapter of the BBWAA named Bautista the Blue Jays&#x27; Most Valuable Player, the Blue Jays&#x27; Most Improved Player, and presented him the John Cerutti Award for displaying &quot;goodwill, cooperation and character&quot;.

====2011====

Bautista agreed to a five-year contract extension worth US$64 million before the 2011 season. He began the season as the starting right fielder for the Blue Jays, with Edwin Encarnación playing third base. Bautista walked 28 times in the month of April, breaking a club record that was set when Carlos Delgado collected 26 bases on balls in April 2001. Bautista was unanimously selected for the Blue Jays&#x27; Player of the Month award, and was also named the AL Player of the Month for the month of April (his third such award in four months, dating back to the 2010 season).

On May 15, Bautista hit three home runs against the Minnesota Twins, the first three-home run game of his career. On May 28, in a home game against the Chicago White Sox, Bautista hit his 20th home run, a three-run shot to left field, becoming the first player to reach 20 home runs in 2011 as well as the fastest player to reach 20 home runs (44 games) in Blue Jays franchise history. Bautista won the AL Player of the Month award for May, his fourth such award in five months. He also became the first player to have the highest number of home runs in a single month for five consecutive months since Jimmie Foxx did so from June 1933 to April 1934. Bautista also won the Blue Jays&#x27; Player of the Month award for the second consecutive month. On June 23, the Blue Jays shifted Bautista to third base and recalled Eric Thames to play the outfield.

Bautista was selected for the 2011 MLB All-Star Game, receiving a record 7,454,753 votes. At the time of his selection, he led MLB in home runs (26), walks (70), OBP (.471), slugging percentage (.679), OPS (1.150), times on base (160) and was also in second place for runs scored (64), total bases (182) and extra base hits (41). He became the first Blue Jay in history to lead the league in All-Star voting. He was also the first Blue Jay to be voted into the All-Star game as a starter since Carlos Delgado in 2003. Bautista participated in the Home Run Derby; he hit four home runs and was eliminated in the first round.

On August 5, with the debut of prospect Brett Lawrie to play third base, Bautista returned to right field. In a game against the Oakland Athletics on August 20, Bautista walked three times, which brought his season total to 102 walks in 113 games, the fastest a player reached 100 walks since Barry Bonds in 2007. During a game against the New York Yankees on September 5, Bautista hit his 40th home run of the season, a solo homer off reliever Rafael Soriano. He became the second player in franchise history with back-to-back 40 home run seasons. Two games later on September 7, against the Boston Red Sox, Bautista stole home plate on a double steal in which Lawrie took second base, becoming the first 40 home run hitter to steal home plate since Adam Dunn in 2004.

After leading the major leagues in home runs for the second consecutive season with 43, Bautista became the first player to do so since Mark McGwire in 1998 and 1999. Baustista also led the majors in slugging percentage (.608), OPS (1.056) and walks (132) and the AL in intentional walks (24). He placed second in OBP (.447) behind Cabrera. He batted .302 and also placed in the top ten in the league in runs scored (105), total bases (312) and times on base (293). Defensively, he led AL right fielders with five double plays turned and placed fourth in assists with 13 and fifth with six errors. His walk total was the highest in the league since Jason Giambi collected 137 in 2000, while setting a new Blue Jays franchise record, which Delgado previously held with 123, also in 2000. He also set new Blue Jays&#x27; single-season records with 8.1 total Wins Above Replacement (WAR) and 8.3 offensive WAR according to Baseball-Reference.com, edging John Olerud&#x27;s 7.7 total in 1993, and Delgado&#x27;s 8.1 offensive WAR in 2000. Bautista held the record for total WAR until Josh Donaldson rated at 8.8 in 2015; however, as of 2015, Bautista still holds the record for offensive WAR. He was the American League winner of the Hank Aaron Award for the second consecutive season, becoming just the third player in the award&#x27;s history, after Rodriguez and Barry Bonds, to win the award in back-to-back years. Bautista also received his second consecutive Silver Slugger Award.

====2012====
 On January 30, Bautista was announced as the cover athlete for the Canadian edition of &quot;MLB 12: The Show&quot;. In an interleague game against the Milwaukee Brewers on June 19, 2012, Bautista hit the second of three straight solo home runs by the Blue Jays, between Colby Rasmus and Edwin Encarnación, the first time since 2005 that the Jays went back-to-back-to-back with home runs. Bautista also took over the MLB lead in home runs for 2012, hitting his 25th on June 27 against the Boston Red Sox, which broke the Blue Jays club record for home runs in a month, with 13. He went on to finish the month with 14 home runs, one short of the American League record for June.

Bautista was voted an American League starter in the All-Star Game for the second consecutive year and his third overall All-Star selection. Hamilton surpassed Bautista&#x27;s record vote total of the prior year. On July 2, Bautista was named American League Player of the Month for June. It was his fifth time receiving the honor in his career. He batted .274 with 14 home runs and 30 RBI in the month of June. His 14 home runs in June set a new Blue Jays franchise record for home runs in a month. Bautista competed in the Home Run Derby. At the time of his selection, he led all major league players with 26 home runs. Bautista finished second to Prince Fielder.

Bautista was placed on the 15-day disabled list on July 17 with inflammation in his wrist. He had started in all previous 90 games, and the Blue Jays called up prospect Anthony Gose to take his place after the game. Bautista was activated on August 24, but returned to the disabled list on August 26 after he re-aggravated the injury to his left wrist. On August 28, the Jays announced that he would undergo season-ending surgery on the wrist. In 2012, Bautista batted .241 with 27 home runs and 65 RBI in 92 games.

====2013====
On January 21, 2013, it was announced that Bautista would once again be the cover athlete of the Canadian edition of &quot;MLB 13: The Show&quot;. Bautista hit his 200th career home run in a game against the Boston Red Sox on June 29. On July 6, he was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game, and his third as the starting right fielder for the American League. At the time of his selection, he batted .264 with 20 home runs and 52 RBI. In the All-Star Game, he recorded the game-winning RBI on a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning as the American League won 3–0.

Playing against the Oakland Athletics on July 30, Bautista hit his 25th home run of the season. In doing so, he became the fourth player in Blue Jays franchise history to hit at least 25 home runs in four consecutive seasons, joining Bell (1984–1987), Carter (1991–1996), and Delgado (1996–2004). His season ended prematurely for the second consecutive time on September 4, when it was announced that he would be shut down with a left hip bone bruise. Bautista finished 2013 with a .259 batting average, 28 home runs, and 73 RBI.

====2014====
Bautista opened the 2014 season with a streak of 37 games in which he reached base safely. His streak, the longest to open a season in Blue Jays franchise history, came to an end on May 11, when he went 0–4. On June 18, he recorded his 1,000 career hit in a game against the New York Yankees. Bautista was named as the American League Captain for the 2014 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby on June 23. On July 6, it was announced that not only was he elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star Game, but, for the second time, received the highest number of votes in the Majors, with 5,859,019.

On August 10, Bautista ended the longest game in franchise history by hitting an opposite field single to drive in Munenori Kawasaki in the 19th inning, and gave the Jays the 6–5 win over the Detroit Tigers. On August 26, Bautista hit his 25th home run of the season, and in doing so, joined Carter and Delgado as the only Blue Jays players in franchise history to hit at least 25 in five or more consecutive seasons. Four days later, Bautista hit his 100th career home run at Rogers Centre, a two-run shot off Yankees starter Michael Pineda, and his fourth straight game with a home run which tied a career-high. He would go on to hit a home run on August 31, extending his home run streak to five games and establishing a new career-high.

In a home game against the Chicago Cubs on September 8, Bautista hit his 200th home run as a Blue Jay, joining Bell, Delgado, Carter, and Vernon Wells as the only players with 200 or more home runs in franchise history. Bautista finished 2014 with a .286 batting average, 35 home runs, and 103 RBI. He won his third Silver Slugger Award for his efforts.

====2015====

In early 2015, Bautista earned 10-and-5 rights by having at least 10 years of service time in the big-leagues, with the last 5 being on the same team. These rights give Bautista the ability to veto any trade he would be involved in. In a home game against the Orioles on April 21, Bautista hit his 250th career home run. He injured his right shoulder during that game, attempting to throw out Delmon Young at first base. He was held out of the lineup for several days before returning, exclusively as the designated hitter. Bautista received a cortisone shot on May 24 and returned to the outfield on June 2, against the Washington Nationals. On July 6, Bautista was named to his sixth-consecutive All-Star team, as a reserve outfielder in Cincinnati. However, on July 11, it was announced that he would sit out the game due to a shoulder injury. Bautista tied Vernon Wells for second place on the Blue Jays&#x27; all-time home run list on July 21, when he hit his 223rd home run for Toronto in a 7–1 win over the Athletics. He surpassed Wells on July 24 in a 5–2 loss to the Seattle Mariners.

On September 30, Bautista surpassed the 40 home run mark for the third time in his career, hitting a solo shot in the ninth inning against the Baltimore Orioles to extend the Blue Jays lead to 11–1. The Blue Jays would win the game, 15–2, and clinch the American League East.

Bautista finished the 2015 regular season with a .250 batting average, 40 home runs, and 114 RBI. He also walked more than he struck out for the second consecutive year, totaling 110 walks to 106 strikeouts. For the season, he had the lowest line drive percentage of all major league hitters (13.9%). From 2010 to 2015, he batted .268 with 153 doubles, 227 home runs, 582 RBI, 574 walks, 576 strikeouts, .390 OBP, .555 SLG, .945 OPS, and 156 OPS+. In that span, he hit more home runs than any other major leaguer – 28 ahead of second-place Miguel Cabrera – was second in slugging percentage and walks, third in OPS and OPS+ and fifth in OBP.
On October 8, 2015, with just over 1,400 career games played, Bautista made his postseason debut against the Texas Rangers in the American League Division Series (ALDS). In the fifth and final game of the series on October 14, Bautista hit a three-run home run off Sam Dyson that gave the Jays a 6–3 lead that they would not relinquish, sending Toronto to the American League Championship Series (ALCS). Bautista watched the home run and flipped his bat high into the air before running the bases, a celebratory gesture that was applauded by Jays fans and media outlets, while drawing the ire of Rangers players as unsportsmanlike, in the midst of a 53-minute seventh inning laden with controversy. A vital symbol of Toronto&#x27;s first postseason appearance since 1993, the bat flip was voted Esurance&#x27;s MLB Award for Best Play on Offense for 2015. In the five games of the ALDS, Bautista batted .273 with two home runs and five RBI.

In Game 3 of the ALCS against the Kansas City Royals, Bautista had one hit and two walks, joining Keith Hernandez as the only players in MLB postseason history to reach base three times on their birthday. The Blue Jays would win the game, 11–8. In Game 6, Bautista hit two home runs, including a two-run game-tying homer at the top of the eighth inning to tie the game at 3–3; however Kansas City would win 4–3 to take the pennant.

On November 3, 2015, Toronto exercised Bautista&#x27;s $14 million option for 2016.

====2016====

During his final regular season plate appearance against the Texas Rangers on May 15, 2016, Bautista was hit by a pitch from Matt Bush, which many believed to be retaliation by the Rangers organization for Bautista&#x27;s bat flip in the 2015 ALDS. Two batters later, Bautista, intending to break-up a double play, made a hard, but no longer legal (as of that season), slide into second basemen Rougned Odor. Although the slide did not make any contact, Odor pushed Bautista, who shoved back, followed by Odor punching Bautista in the jaw. This ignited a bench-clearing brawl. Bautista was handed a one-game suspension by the league for his part in the melee, which he appealed. On May 27, MLB announced that they had upheld the suspension. During the day of his suspension, Bautista served as the public address announcer at Rogers Centre. On June 17, 2016, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to an injury to his left big toe. He returned from the disabled list near the end of July. On August 2, Bautista hit his 300th career home run, a solo shot off Houston Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr. He would finish the season batting .234 with 22 home runs and 69 RBI in 116 games, helping the Blue Jays to a second consecutive appearance in the ALCS.

On November 7, the Blue Jays extended a $17.2 million qualifying offer to Bautista, which he declined on November 14.

====2017====

On January 18, 2017, Bautista signed a one-year, $18 million contract with the Blue Jays. The contract included a $17 million mutual option for the 2018 season, as well as a $20 million vesting option for 2019. On August 11, Bautista reached the 20 home run mark for the eighth consecutive season.

Bautista ended the year batting .203 with 23 home runs and 65 RBI in 157 games. His .203 batting average was the lowest of all qualified major league batters. The Blue Jays declined Bautista&#x27;s option for 2018 on November 4, 2017, marking the end of his tenure as a Blue Jay.

===2018===
====Atlanta Braves====
On April 18, 2018, Bautista signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves. After playing a few games for the Gwinnett Stripers, the Braves promoted Bautista to start at third base for the first of a three-game series against the San Francisco Giants on May 4. On May 12, 2018, Bautista hit his first home run with the Braves. Bautista batted .143 with two home runs and five RBIs in 35 at bats over 12 games played before being released by the Braves on May 20.

====New York Mets====

On May 22, 2018, Bautista signed a one-year deal with the New York Mets. Bautista hit a double in his first at bat with the Mets. He later scored on a sacrifice fly. On June 22, 2018, Bautista hit his first home run as a member of the Mets against the Dodgers, making it his third of the season (his previous two being with the Braves). On July 6, Bautista hit a walk off grand slam against the Rays, the first walk off home run of his career. He batted .204 with nine home runs, 37 RBI and a .351 OBP in 83 games with the Mets.

====Philadelphia Phillies====
The Mets traded Bautista to the Philadelphia Phillies for a player to be named later or cash on August 28, 2018. He batted .244 with two home runs and 6 RBI in 27 games with the Phillies, and posted a .404 OBP and .870 OPS. He was the ninth-oldest player in the National League. Bautista elected free agency on October 29.

===Post–2018===
In November 2019, Bautista expressed desire to continue his career after taking the 2019 season off.

In March 2020, reports surfaced he was hoping to return as a two-way player. He had joined former Blue Jays teammate Marcus Stroman - a starting pitcher - to workout with during the off-season. Bautista began following Stroman&#x27;s training regime and which eventually led to a few social media videos - posted by Stroman - showing Bautista pitching and Stroman sharing the opinion that he could &quot;easily&quot; pitch out of a Major League bullpen. Several reports followed suggesting he was eying a return to Major League Baseball as a pitcher - who could also provide at bats from another position or as a DH - but Bautista quashed the rumour quickly. &quot;Just to kind of clear the record, I&#x27;ve never stated that it was my plan or desire to make it to the big leagues as a big-league pitcher,&quot; he told MLB Network Radio. He did, however, leave the door open to an opportunity to pitch should it arise.

===Retirement===

In March 2023, the Blue Jays announced that Bautista would be inducted onto their Level of Excellence on August 12, 2023, in ceremony prior to their game versus the Chicago Cubs. The day before the ceremony, Bautista signed a one-day contract with the team and formally announced that he will retire as a Toronto Blue Jay.

<text>SHACAL-1 (originally simply SHACAL) is a 160-bit block cipher based on SHA-1, and supports keys from 128-bit to 512-bit. SHACAL-2 is a 256-bit block cipher based upon the larger hash function SHA-256.

Both SHACAL-1 and SHACAL-2 were selected for the second phase of the NESSIE project. However, in 2003, SHACAL-1 was not recommended for the NESSIE portfolio because of concerns about its key schedule, while SHACAL-2 was finally selected as one of the 17 NESSIE finalists.

== Design ==
SHACAL-1 is based on the following observation of SHA-1:

The hash function SHA-1 is designed around a compression function. This function takes as input a 160-bit state and a 512-bit data word and outputs a new 160-bit state after 80 rounds. The hash function works by repeatedly calling this compression function with successive 512-bit data blocks and each time updating the state accordingly. This compression function is easily invertible if the data block is known, i.e. given the data block on which it acted and the output of the compression function, one can compute that state that went in.

SHACAL-1 turns the SHA-1 compression function into a block cipher by using the state input as the data block and using the data input as the key input. In other words, SHACAL-1 views the SHA-1 compression function as an 80-round, 160-bit block cipher with a 512-bit key. Keys shorter than 512 bits are supported by padding them with zeros. SHACAL-1 is not intended to be used with keys shorter than 128 bits.

== Security of SHACAL-1 ==
In the paper &quot;Related-key rectangle attack on the full SHACAL-1&quot;, 2006, Orr Dunkelman, Nathan Keller and Jongsung Kim presented a related-key rectangle attack on the full 80 rounds of SHACAL-1.

In the paper &quot;Differential and Rectangle Attacks on Reduced-Round SHACAL-1&quot;, Jiqiang Lu, Jongsung Kim, Nathan Keller and Orr Dunkelman presented rectangle attacks on the first 51 rounds and a series of 52 inner rounds of SHACAL-1 and presented differential attacks on the first 49 rounds and a series of 55 inner rounds of SHACAL-1. These are the best currently known cryptanalytic results on SHACAL-1 in a single key attack scenario.

== Security of SHACAL-2 ==
In the paper &quot;Related-Key Rectangle Attack on 42-Round SHACAL-2&quot;, Jiqiang Lu, Jongsung Kim, Nathan Keller, Orr Dunkelman presented a related-key rectangle attack on 42-round SHACAL-2.

In 2008 Lu and Kim presented a related-key rectangle attack on 44-round SHACAL-2. This is the best currently known cryptanalytic result on SHACAL-2.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kaneyama peaked in the 1950s and has declined steadily over the past 60 years. It is now roughly a quarter of what it was a century ago.
==History==
The area of present-day Kaneyama was part of ancient Mutsu Province and formed part of the holdings of Aizu Domain during the Edo period. After the Meiji Restoration, it was organized as part of Ōnuma District in Fukushima Prefecture. After the Meiji restoration, the villages of Yokota, Kawaguchi, Numazawa and Honna were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. These villages merged on July 1, 1955, to form the village of Kaneyama, which was raised to town status on March 31, 1958.

One of the hamlets in the town, Mifuke, on the banks of the Tadami River, was abandoned after being struck by a landslide in April 1964, and is now a ghost town only visited occasionally by tourists and former residents. The displaced people were integrated into the village of Amenuma across the river.

==Economy==
Hydroelectric power generation from numerous dams on the Tadami River is the primary source of revenue for the town.

==Education==
Kaneyama has two public elementary schools and one public junior high school operated by the town government. The town has one public high school operated by the Fukushima Prefectural Board of Education.

<text>Scott David Brosius (born August 15, 1966) is an American former professional baseball third baseman for the Oakland Athletics (–) and the New York Yankees (–) of Major League Baseball (MLB) who is the athletic director at Linfield University. He was an MLB All-Star in 1998 and won a Gold Glove Award in 1999. Brosius was a member of three consecutive World Series champions with the Yankees from 1998 to 2000 and won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award in 1998.

==Early life==
Brosius grew up in Milwaukie, Oregon, where he attended Rex Putnam High School before going to Linfield College. He was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the 20th round of the 1987 amateur draft and signed on June 9, 1987.

==Playing career==
===Oakland Athletics (1991–1997)===
Brosius became one of the few players to hit a home run in his first major league game, on August 7, 1991. Brosius was the A&#x27;s starting third baseman through the mid-1990s, although he played almost 300 games in his Oakland career at other positions, primarily in the outfield. In , he batted .304 with 22 home runs, his best year with Oakland; however, his performance declined in 1997 when he finished last in the majors (of those who qualified for the batting title) in batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging average.

===New York Yankees (1998–2001)===
After the 1997 season, the Athletics traded Brosius to the New York Yankees for Kenny Rogers. In his first season with the Yankees, Brosius batted .300 with 19 home runs and 98 RBIs. That season, he was selected to his only career All-Star Game. He hit .471 with two homers and six runs batted during the 1998 World Series and won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He hit 2 home runs in Game 3 of the World Series, including one off Padres closer Trevor Hoffman to give the Yankees a 5-3 lead in the 8th inning which helped to propel the Yankees to a 3-0 Series lead.

Although his performance over the next three years did not match that of his 1998 season, he remained a perennial fan favorite in the Bronx as his workmanlike blue-collar approach and serviceable durability appealed to fans, teammates, and management alike. During his career with the Yankees, they won the American League pennant every year, from 1998 to 2001, as well as the World Series from 1998 to . He won a Gold Glove in . On July 18 of that year, against the Montreal Expos, Brosius caught shortstop Orlando Cabrera&#x27;s foul popup for the final out of David Cone&#x27;s perfect game. He was first among all AL third basemen in errors in 2001, with 22, and had the lowest fielding percentage in the league (.935).

In one of the most dramatic, clutch moments of his career, Brosius hit a two-out, two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 5 of the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks to tie the game and set up an extra-innings Yankees win. The previous night, New York first baseman Tino Martinez had hit a two-out, two-run home run to tie the game in the ninth inning as well. It marked the first time in World Series history this had ever occurred. The Yankees would go on to lose Games 6 and 7 of the series, after which Brosius retired.

==Coaching and management career==

From 2002 to 2007, Brosius was an assistant coach at Linfield College under head baseball coach Scott Carnahan, Brosius&#x27;s coach when he played for the school. They switched roles for the 2008 season. Brosius was named head coach and Carnahan, who also is athletic director, became an assistant coach. Brosius earned his degree from Linfield in 2002. Brosius has been named Northwest Conference coach of the year five times (2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014) in eight seasons as head coach and led the team into the NCAA Division III national championship tournament four times. The Wildcats finished third in 2010 and in 2013 won Linfield&#x27;s first NCAA national baseball championship (and second national championship, after the 1971 NAIA victory.) Trying for a rare repeat in 2014, they were eliminated in two straight games. Brosius&#x27; win–loss record in eight years as Linfield head coach was 270-96 (.738).

On December 4, 2015, the Seattle Mariners announced that Brosius would be the new hitting coach for their AAA affiliate, the Tacoma Rainiers. He was promoted on October 20, 2016 to assistant coach of Seattle Mariners for the 2017 season. Brosius was named the Mariners third base coach for the 2018 season.

On August 13, 2019, he became the United States national baseball team coach at the 2019 WBSC Premier12. On October 16, 2019, he was promoted to manager when Joe Girardi declined the position. The team finished fourth in the tournament and failed to qualify for the 2020 Olympics in the initial rounds.

Brosius became the athletic director at Linfield University in May 2024.

==Legacy==
Brosius was inducted into the Linfield Athletics Hall of Fame in 2002, and the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

In 2007 and 2015, Brosius took part in the New York Yankees Old-Timers&#x27; Day festivities.

On November 4, 2009, Brosius threw out the first pitch before Game 6 of the 2009 World Series at Yankee Stadium.
