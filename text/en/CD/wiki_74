<text>Throughout baseball&#x27;s history, the rules have frequently changed as the game continues to evolve. A few typical rules most professional leagues have in common are that four balls are a base on balls, three strikes are a strikeout, and three outs end a half-inning. 

Baseball evolved out of bat-and-ball games in the mid-19th century, and its modern rules are based mainly on those first published in 1848. Most rule sets are generally based on the Official Baseball Rules (OBR) published by Major League Baseball (MLB), though various minor variations exist from league to league; the World Baseball Softball Confederation maintains its own official rule set for international competition.

==Rules==
There are several major codified sets of rules, which differ only slightly.

The Official Baseball Rules, published by Major League Baseball, govern all professional play in the United States and Canada. Many amateur and youth leagues use the OBR with only a few modifications for safety, including Little League, PONY League, and Cal Ripken League. Most professional leagues outside North America (such as Japan&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball) also use modified versions of the OBR, though these generally have more pronounced differences.

The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), which governs international tournaments like the Summer Olympics, Baseball World Cup, and WBSC Premier 12, first published its own official rule set in 2023; the WBSC had previously relied on a modified set of the OBR. WBSC rules are largely similar to the OBR, with minor differences including pitch clock timing and extra-innings tiebreakers. These rules do not apply to the World Baseball Classic, which is organized jointly by the WBSC and MLB.

The baseball rulebook of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), aside from governing the games of that organization&#x27;s members, is also used by several other competitions involving college-aged players.

The rules of the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) hold sway over U.S. high school and high school-age baseball, governing and shaping the sport at this level.

==History==
Unlike many other sports, the Official Baseball Rules have remained mainly static during the modern era of the game. Many baseball players, fans and administrators view the rules and traditions of professional baseball as time-tested and nearly sacrosanct.

This was not the case during baseball&#x27;s early days, particularly in the late 19th century, when rules were changed significantly and often yearly. The modern game began to take shape in the late 1880s, with additional significant rule changes made during the rest of that century.

===Early era (pre-1901)===

Many of the modern rules of baseball originated with the so-called &quot;New York game&quot; played by amateur urban clubs of the 1840s and 1850s. These rules were first published in 1848 by Alexander Cartwright, often credited as &quot;the father of baseball&quot;, though they were actually written by William R. Wheaton and William H. Tucker, of the New York Knickerbockers club.

In 1857, under the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) Rules which governed until 1870, the 9-inning format was adopted, replacing the previous rule that the first team to score 21 runs won. The next year, called strikes were recognized, and a batter was out if a ball, fair or foul, was caught on the fly or after one bounce. Called balls and the walk were introduced in 1863. In 1867, the batter had the right to call for a high or low pitch, to be determined by the umpire.

The National League formed in 1876. Its rules changed almost yearly for the next quarter century. In 1880, a batter was out if the catcher caught the third strike; otherwise, the batter got four strikes. Before 1883, pitchers were required to deliver pitches with their hand below their hips; in that year, the rule was changed to allow shoulder-high deliveries. Until 1887, batters could call for either a high or low pitch, and the strike zone was either above or below the waist. In 1885, the rules changed, to allow bats to be flat on one side; beginning in 1893, they had to be round. In 1887, the rules changed so that batters could no longer call for a pitch; and the strike zone was defined as from the shoulders to the knees. During this period, the pitcher&#x27;s mound was much closer to home plate, foul balls were not counted as strikes, batters got four strikes, and the number of &quot;called balls&quot; resulting in a walk—which initially included strikes and foul balls- went from 9 to 8 to 7 to 6 to 5 and, in 1889, to 4. In that same year, the number of strikes went from 4 to 3. In 1887, a rule was adopted for that year counting only walks as hits, which played havoc with statistics. In 1892, the 154 game schedule was adopted. In 1893, the pitching position was changed from behind a line 50 feet from home plate to contact with a rubber slab 60.5 feet away. In 1894, foul bunts were made strikes, and the infield fly rule was adopted with one out. In 1895, foul tips were made strikes, but not foul balls. In 1898, the first modern balk rule was adopted, as well as the rule for recognizing stolen bases. In 1901, the infield fly rule was extended to apply when there were no outs.

===Modern era (1901-present)===
Due to the frequent and often radical rule changes during this early period, the &quot;modern era&quot; is generally considered to have begun in 1901, when the American League was also formed.

Some significant rule changes continued in the first quarter of the 20th century, but were much less frequent. In 1903, the American League adopted the foul strike rule. In 1907, the sacrifice fly rule was adopted. In 1910, cork centers were added to balls. In 1925, the minimum distance for a home run was made 250 feet. Until 1929 (AL) and 1931 (NL), a ball that bounced over the outfield fence in fair territory was a home run, not a ground rule double.

After that, the rules remained virtually static for decades. Most top-level international leagues were formed during this period, including the Japanese Baseball League (1936) and its modern-day successor Nippon Professional Baseball (1950). Already-existing leagues in the Western Hemisphere were integrated into MLB&#x27;s minor leagues and thus subject to the OBR, namely the Cuban League (1947) and the Mexican League (1955).

In 1961, the 162-game schedule was adopted by MLB. In 1969, the pitcher&#x27;s mound dropped five inches and the strike zone was reduced from the armpits to the top of the knees. In 1973, the American League adopted the designated hitter rule. This was probably the most controversial rule change in baseball&#x27;s history and is still subject to lively debate. It was not adopted by the National League until 2022. Also controversial when adopted was the later introduction of interleague play. On the other hand, rule changes banning the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing substances have had widespread support as protecting the integrity of the game. 

The most recent significant rule changes to the OBR occurred in 2023, when MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred introduced rules adding a pitch clock, extra-inning base runners, and restricting infield shifts. These rules have been gradually adopted in North America (and in WBSC competition), but generally do not exist elsewhere in the world.

==Gameplay==

===General structure===
Baseball is played between two teams with nine players in the field from the team not batting at that point (the batting team would have one batter in play at &quot;home plate&quot; on the field). On a baseball field, the game is under the authority of several umpires. There are usually four umpires in major league games; up to six (and as few as one) may officiate depending on the league and the importance of the game. There are three &quot;bases&quot;. Numbered counterclockwise, first, second, and third bases are cushions (sometimes informally referred to as &quot;bags&quot;) shaped as square in Major League Baseball, or in other rulesets (including Little League, Babe Ruth, American Legion, and NFHS) which are raised a short distance above the ground. Together with home plate, the fourth &quot;base&quot;, they form a square with sides of called the diamond. Home plate is a pentagonal rubber slab wide. The playing field is divided into three main sections:
*The infield, containing the four bases, is for general defensive purposes bounded by the foul lines and within the grass line (see figure).
*The outfield is the grassed area beyond the infield grass line between the foul lines and bounded by a wall or fence.
*Foul territory is the entire area outside the foul lines.

The pitcher&#x27;s mound is located in the center of the infield. It is an diameter mound of dirt no higher than . Near the center of the mound is the pitching rubber, a rubber slab positioned from home plate. The pitcher must have one foot on the rubber at the start of every pitch to a batter, but the pitcher may leave the mound area once the ball is released. The desired alignment of the field (home plate to second base) is east-northeast.

At the college/professional level, baseball is played in nine innings where each team gets one turn to bat and tries to score &quot;runs&quot; while the other pitches and defends in the field. High school baseball plays seven innings and Little League uses six-inning games. An inning is broken up into two halves where the away team bats in the top (first) half, and the home team bats in the bottom (second) half. In baseball, the defense always has the ball which differentiates it from most other team sports. The teams switch every time the defending team gets three players of the batting team &quot;out&quot;. The winner is the team with the most runs after nine innings. If the home team is ahead after the top of the ninth, play does not continue into the bottom half. When this happens, an X is put on the scoreboard for the home team&#x27;s score in the ninth inning. In the case of a tie, additional innings are played until one team comes out ahead at the end of an inning. If the home team takes the lead anytime during the bottom of the ninth or of any inning after that, play stops and the home team is declared the winner; this is known as a walk-off.
The basic contest is always between the &quot;pitcher&quot; for the fielding team and a &quot;batter&quot;. The pitcher throws &quot;pitches&quot; the ball towards home plate, where the &quot;catcher&quot; for the fielding team waits (in a crouched stance) to receive it. Behind the catcher stands the home plate umpire. The batter stands in one of the batter&#x27;s boxes and tries to hit the ball with a bat. The pitcher must keep one foot in contact with the top or front of the pitcher&#x27;s rubber—a plate located atop the pitcher&#x27;s mound—during the entire pitch, so he can take only one step backward and one forward in delivering the ball. The catcher&#x27;s job is to receive any pitches that the batter does not hit and to &quot;call&quot; the game by a series of hand movements which signal to the pitcher what pitch to throw and where. The catcher also usually signals the desired location of the ball within the strike zone and &quot;sets up&quot; behind the plate or holds his glove up in the desired location as a target. The catcher&#x27;s role becomes more crucial depending on how the game is going, and how the pitcher responds to a given situation. Each pitch begins a new &quot;play&quot;, which might consist of nothing more than the pitch itself.

Each half-inning, the goal of the defending team is to get three members of the other team out. A player who is out must leave the field and wait for his next turn at bat. There are many ways to get batters and baserunners out; some of the most common are catching a batted ball in the air, tag outs, force outs, and strikeouts. After the fielding team has put out three players, that half of the inning is over and the team in the field and the team at bat switch places; there is no upper limit to the number that may bat in rotation before three outs are recorded. Going through the entire order in an inning is referred to as &quot;batting around&quot; and it is indicative of a high-scoring inning. A complete inning consists of each opposing side having a turn (three outs) on offense.

The goal of the team at bat is to score more runs than the opposition; a player may do so by batting, then becoming a baserunner, touching all the bases in order (via one or more plays), and finally touching home plate. A player may also become a baserunner by being inserted as a pinch-runner. To that end, the goal of each batter is to enable baserunners to score or to become a baserunner himself. The batter attempts to hit the ball into fair territory—between the baselines—in such a way that the defending players cannot get them or the baserunners out. In general, the pitcher attempts to prevent this by pitching the ball in such a way that the batter cannot hit it cleanly or, ideally, at all.

A baserunner who has successfully touched home plate without being retired (called out) after touching all previous bases scores a &quot;run&quot;. In an enclosed field, a fair ball hit over the fence on the fly is an automatic &quot;home run&quot;, which entitles the batter and all runners to touch every base and score. On a field with foul poles, a ball that hits a pole is also a home run. A home run hit with all bases occupied (&#x27;bases loaded&#x27;) is called a &quot;grand slam&quot;.

===Fielding team===
The squad in the field is the defensive team; they attempt to prevent the baserunners from scoring. There are nine defensive positions, but only two have a mandatory location (pitcher and catcher). The locations of the other seven fielders are not specified by the rules, except that at the moment the pitch is delivered, they must be positioned in fair territory and not in the space between the pitcher and the catcher. These fielders often shift their positioning in response to specific batters or game situations, and they may exchange positions with one another at any time.

The nine positions most commonly used (with the number scorekeepers use) are: pitcher (1), catcher (2), first baseman (3), second baseman (4), third baseman (5), shortstop (6), left fielder (7), center fielder (8), and right fielder (9). Note that, in rare cases, teams may use dramatically differing schemes, such as switching an outfielder for an infielder. The numbering convention was established by Henry Chadwick. The reason the shortstop seems out of order has to do with the way fielders positioned themselves in the early years of the game; the shortstop was positioned in the shallow outfield. Each position is weighted on the defensive spectrum in terms of difficulty. The most difficult position is the catcher, while the least difficult is first base. Designated hitter, while on the scale, is not part of the defense at all. Pitchers, while part of the active defense, are so specialized in their role that they usually make only routine plays.

====The battery====
The &quot;battery&quot; is composed of the &quot;pitcher&quot;, who stands on the rubber of the mound, which is also known as the pitching plate, and the &quot;catcher&quot;, who squats behind home plate. These are the two fielders who always deal directly with the batter on every pitch, hence the term &quot;battery&quot;, coined by Henry Chadwick and later reinforced by the implied comparison to artillery fire.

The pitcher&#x27;s main role is to pitch the ball toward home plate with the goal of getting the batter out. Pitchers also play defense by fielding batted balls, covering bases (for a potential tag out or force out on an approaching runner), or backing up throws. The catcher&#x27;s main role is to receive the pitch if the batter does not hit it. Together with the pitcher and coaches, the catcher plots game strategy by suggesting different pitches and by shifting the starting positions of the other fielders. Catchers are also responsible for defense in the area near home plate (such as dropped third strikes and wild pitches) or baserunning plays, most commonly when an opposing player attempts to steal a base. Due to the exceptional difficulty of the position, catchers are universally valued for their defensive prowess as opposed to their ability to hit.

====The infielders====
The four infielders are the &quot;first baseman&quot;, &quot;second baseman&quot;, &quot;shortstop&quot;, and &quot;third baseman&quot;. Originally the first, second and third basemen played very near their respective bases, and the shortstop generally played &quot;in&quot; (hence the term), covering the area between second, third, and the pitchers box, or wherever the game situation required. As the game evolved, the fielding positions changed to the now-familiar &quot;umbrella&quot;, with the first and third baseman generally positioned a short distance toward second base from their bases, the second baseman to the right side of second base standing further away from the base than any other infielder, and the shortstop playing to the left of second base, as seen from the batter&#x27;s perspective.

The first baseman&#x27;s job consists largely of making plays at first base on ground balls hit to the other infielders. When an infielder picks up a ball from the ground hit by the batter, he must throw it to the first baseman who has to catch the ball and maintain contact with the base before the batter gets to it for the batter to be out. The need to do this quickly often requires the first baseman to stretch one of his legs to touch first base while catching the ball simultaneously. The first baseman must be able to catch the ball very well and usually wears a specially designed mitt. The first baseman fields balls hit near first base. The first baseman also has to receive throws from the pitcher in order to tag runners out who have reached base safely. The position is less physically challenging than the other positions, but there is still a lot of skill involved. Infielders do not always make good throws to first base, so it is the first baseman&#x27;s job to field any ball thrown toward him cleanly. Older players who can no longer fulfill the demands of their original positions also often become first basemen.

The second baseman covers the area to the first-base side of second base and provides backup for the first baseman in bunt situations. He also is a cut-off for the outfield. The cut-off provides an intermediary between an outfielder and the infield so that the outfielder does not have to throw the entire distance if they have been forced to field the ball near the outer edge of the outfield. The shortstop fills the critical gap between second and third bases—where right-handed batters generally hit ground balls—and also covers second or third base and the near part of left field. This player is also a cut-off for the outfield. This position is the most demanding defensively, so a good shortstop doesn&#x27;t need to necessarily be a skilled batter, though this has changed in modern times. The third baseman&#x27;s primary requirement is a strong throwing arm, in order to make the long throw across the infield to the first baseman. Quick reaction time is also important for third basemen, as they tend to see more sharply-hit balls than do the other infielders, thus the nickname for third base as the &quot;hot corner&quot;. Also, because there are far more right-handed hitters than lefties, there are more ground balls hit to the left side of the infield due to the natural motion of the batter&#x27;s swing.

====The outfielders====
The three outfielders, &quot;left fielder&quot;, &quot;center fielder&quot;, and &quot;right fielder&quot;, are so named from the catcher&#x27;s perspective looking out onto the field. The right fielder generally has the strongest arm of all the outfielders due to the need to make throws on runners attempting to take third base. The center fielder has more territory to cover than the corner outfielders, so this player must be quick and agile with a strong arm to throw balls into the infield; as with the shortstop, teams tend to emphasize defense at this position. Also, the center fielder is considered the outfield leader, and left- and right-fielders often cede to his direction when fielding fly balls. Of all outfielders, the &quot;left fielder&quot; often has the weakest arm, as they generally do not need to throw the ball as far in order to prevent the advance of any baserunners. The left fielder still requires good fielding and catching skills, and typically receives more balls than the right fielder due to the fact that right-handed hitters, who are much more common, tend to &quot;pull&quot; the ball into left field. Each outfielder runs to &quot;back up&quot; a nearby outfielder who attempts to field a ball hit near both their positions. Outfielders also run to back up infielders on batted balls and thrown balls, including pick-off attempts from the pitcher or from the catcher.

====Defensive strategy====

=====Pitching=====

Effective pitching is critical to a baseball team, as pitching is the key for the defensive team to retire batters and to prevent runners from getting on base. A full game usually involves over one hundred pitches thrown by each team. However, most pitchers begin to tire before they reach this point. In previous eras, pitchers would often throw up to four complete games (all nine innings) in a week. With new advances in medical research and thus a better understanding of how the human body functions and tires out, starting pitchers tend more often to throw fractions of a game (typically six or seven innings, depending on their performance) about every five days (though a few complete games do still occur each year).

A single game often requires multiple pitchers, including the starting pitcher and relief pitcher(s). Pitchers are substituted for one another like any other player (see above), and the rules do not limit the number of pitchers that can be used in a game; the only limiting factor is the size of the squad, naturally. In general, starting pitchers are not used in relief situations except sometimes during the post-season when every game is vital. If a game runs into many extra innings, a team may well empty its bullpen. If it then becomes necessary to use a &quot;position player&quot; as a pitcher, major league teams generally have certain players designated as emergency relief pitchers, to avoid the embarrassment of using a less skillful player. In baseball&#x27;s early years, squads were smaller, and relief pitchers were relatively uncommon, with the starter normally remaining for the entire game unless he was either thoroughly ineffective or became injured. Today, with a much greater emphasis on pitch count, over the course of a single game each team will frequently use from two to five pitchers. In the 2005 ALCS, all four of the Chicago White Sox victories were complete games by the starters, a highly noteworthy event in the modern game.

While delivering the ball, the pitcher has a great arsenal at his disposal in the variation of location, velocity, movement, and arm position (see types of pitches). Most pitchers attempt to master two or three types of pitches; some pitchers throw up to six types of pitches with varying degrees of control. Common pitches include a fastball, which is the ball thrown at high speed; a curveball, which is made to curve by rotation imparted by the pitcher; a change-up, which seeks to mimic the delivery of a fastball, but arrives at significantly lower velocity; a splitfinger fastball, which attempts to mimic the delivery of a fastball, but has slight topspin rotation allowing the baseball to sink as it approaches the batter due to the position of the index finger and middle finger being &quot;split&quot; on the baseball; a slider, which is made to curve laterally by rotation imparted by the pitcher; a knuckleball, which is held either by the knuckles closest to the nails or by the nails themselves letting the pitcher throw a baseball with little or no spin on the ball allowing the baseball to move in any direction; a Vulcan changeup, which seeks to mimic the delivery of a fastball, but arrives at a significant lower velocity due to the pitcher holding the baseball with the middle and ring fingers slightly apart; a circle changeup, which is held in the palm of the hand with the index finger curled around the side of the baseball, allowing the pitcher to mimic the delivery of a fastball, but arrives at a significantly lower velocity.

To illustrate pitching strategy, consider the &quot;fastball/change-up&quot; combination: The average major-league pitcher can throw a fastball around , and a few pitchers have even exceeded . The change-up is thrown somewhere between . Since the batter&#x27;s timing is critical to hitting a pitch, a batter swinging to hit what looks like a fastball, would be terribly fooled (swing and miss, hopefully) when the pitch turns out to be a much slower change-up.

Some pitchers choose to throw using the &#x27;submarine style,&#x27; a very efficient sidearm or near-underhand motion. Pitchers with a submarine delivery are often very difficult to hit because of the angle and movement of the ball once released. Walter Johnson, who threw one of the fastest fastballs in the history of the game, threw sidearm (though not submarine) rather than a normal overhand. True underhanded pitching is permitted in Major League Baseball. However, it is difficult to generate enough velocity and movement with the underhand motion. Among modern Major League pitchers, Chad Bradford had the closest to an underhand delivery, with his knuckles sometimes scraping the ground. However, he is still usually considered a &quot;submarine&quot; pitcher.

One example of variation in professional leagues is the use of a pitch clock, which some leagues use to speed up the game&#x27;s pace of play. The rule was first implemented in college baseball in 2010, and added to certain levels of Minor League Baseball in 2015. The clock was introduced to Major League Baseball starting in the 2023 Major League Baseball season, establishing a 15 second time limit between pitches with the bases empty, and 20 seconds with at least one baserunner, as well as an automatic ball for violations of the clock. The rule does not exist in other top-level leagues, such as Japan&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), where there exists some resistance to its adoption. South Korea&#x27;s KBO League said in 2023 that it would implement a pitch clock &quot;at the earliest possible date.&quot;

=====Fielding strategy=====
Only the pitcher&#x27;s and catcher&#x27;s locations are fixed, and then only at the beginning of each pitch. Thus, the players on the field move around as needed to defend against scoring a run. Many variations of this are possible, as location depends upon the situation. Circumstances such as the number of outs, the count (balls and strikes) on the batter, the number and speed of runners, the ability of the fielders, the ability of the pitcher, the type of pitch thrown, the tendencies of the hitter, and the inning cause the fielders to move to more strategic locations on the field. Common defensive strategies include: playing for the bunt, trying to prevent a stolen base, moving to a shallow position to throw out a runner at home, playing at &quot;double play depth&quot;, and moving fielders to locations where hitters are most likely to hit the ball.

Infield shifts were restricted by the OBR starting in 2023, which mandated that two infielders must be positioned on either side of second base before each pitch is thrown. South Korea&#x27;s KBO League is expected to introduce a similar restriction in 2025.

===Batting team===

====Batters and runners====

The ultimate goal of the team at bat is to score runs. To accomplish this task, the team at bat successively (in a predetermined order called a &quot;lineup&quot; or &quot;batting order&quot;) sends its nine players to the batter&#x27;s box (adjacent to home plate) where they become batters. (Each team sets its batting lineup at the beginning of the game. Changes to the lineup are tightly limited by the rules of baseball and must be communicated to the umpires, who have the substitutions announced for the opposing team and fans. See Substitutions below.)

A batter&#x27;s turn at the plate is called a &quot;plate appearance&quot;. Batters can advance to first base safely in one of seven methods: a base-hit (abbreviated &#x27;H&#x27;) or walk (&#x27;BB&#x27; for base-on-balls) are by far the most common; being hit-by-the-pitch (&#x27;HBP&#x27;), reaching by error (&#x27;E&#x27;) or fielder&#x27;s choice (&#x27;FC&#x27;) are less common; and somewhat rarely a player may reach base by virtue of interference (&#x27;I&#x27;) or a passed ball (&#x27;PB&#x27;) on a strikeout, where the player is allowed to run and reach base safely if able. When the batter hits a fair ball, he must run to first base and may continue or stop at any base unless he is put out. A successful hit occurs when the batter reaches a base: reaching only first base is a &quot;single&quot;; reaching second base, a &quot;double&quot;; third base, a &quot;triple&quot;; and a hit that allows the batter to touch all bases in order on the same play is a home run—whether the ball is hit over the fence does not matter (if the ball is not hit over the fence and the batter touches all bases, it is usually referred to as an &quot;inside-the-park home run&quot;). Once a runner is held to a base, he may attempt to advance at any time, but is not required to do so unless the batter or another runner displaces him (called a force play). A batter always drops his bat when running the bases; otherwise, the bat would slow him down and could give rise to a call of interference if it were to contact the ball or a fielder. However, if a batter hits the ball, and the batter or the dropped bat touches the ball, it is considered a dead ball.

Depending on the way the ball comes off the bat, the play has different names. A batted ball is called a fly ball if it is hit in the air in an upward arc, such that a fielder might be able to catch it before it hits the ground. A batted ball is called a &quot;ground ball&quot; if it hits the ground within the infield before it can be caught, often due to being hit in a downward trajectory. Several different names are used to describe fly balls, depending on their trajectory. A ball hit high in the air and seemingly almost straight up is called a &quot;pop-up&quot;. A ball hit forcefully in a fast-moving and seemingly almost straight-line trajectory is called a &quot;line drive&quot;. A &quot;shallow&quot; fly ball, hit with just enough force to possibly land between the infielders and the outfielders, is often called a &quot;blooper&quot;. A &quot;deep&quot; fly ball is hit with enough force to approach and possibly clear the outfield fence.

When a ball is hit outside the foul lines, it is a &quot;foul ball&quot;, requiring the batter and all runners to return to their respective bases, whether it is caught or not. Additionally, if a ground ball or a bunted ball lands in foul territory and the ball rolls back into bounds before reaching either first or third bases without being touched by either a fielder or a runner, then said ball is considered fair.

Once the batter and any existing runners have all stopped at a base or been put out, the ball is returned to the pitcher, and the next batter comes to the plate. After the opposing team bats in its own order and three more outs are recorded, the first team&#x27;s batting order will continue again from where it left off.

When a runner reaches home plate, he scores a run and is no longer a base runner. He must leave the playing area until his spot in the order comes up again. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score no more than a single run. In the American, Pacific, and both Cuban leagues, there is a tenth player, a designated hitter, who bats for the pitcher.

====Batting====
Each plate appearance consists of a series of pitches, in which the pitcher throws the ball towards home plate while a batter is standing in the batter&#x27;s box (either right or left). With each pitch, the batter must decide whether to swing the bat at the ball in an attempt to hit it. The pitches arrive quickly, so the decision to swing must be made in less than a tenth of a second, based on whether the ball is hittable and in the &quot;strike zone&quot;, a region defined by the area directly above home plate and between the hollow beneath the batter&#x27;s knee and the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants. In addition to swinging at the ball, a batter who wishes to put the ball in play may hold his bat over home plate and attempt to tap a pitch lightly; this is called a bunt. Good bunting technique has been described as &quot;catching the ball with the bat.&quot;

On any pitch, if the batter swings at the ball and misses, he is charged with a &quot;strike&quot;. If the batter does not swing, the home plate umpire judges whether the ball passed through the strike zone. If any part of the ball passed through the zone, it is ruled a strike; otherwise, it is called a &quot;ball&quot;. The number of balls and strikes thrown to the current batter is known as the count; the count is always given balls first, then strikes (such as 3–2 or &quot;three and two&quot;, also known as a &quot;full count&quot;, which would be 3 balls and 2 strikes).

If the batter swings and makes contact with the ball, but does not put it in play in fair territory—a &quot;foul ball&quot;—he is charged with an additional strike if there are less than two. Thus, a foul ball with two strikes leaves the count unchanged. (However, a noted exception to this rule is that a ball bunted foul with two strikes is a strikeout.) If a pitch is batted and a member of the defensive team is able to catch it, before the ball strikes the ground, the batter is declared out. In the event that a bat deflects the ball sharply and directly back toward the catcher&#x27;s box, it is a &quot;foul tip&quot;. If a ball ruled as a foul tip is caught, with two strikes in the count, it is considered a counted third strike and an out; if not initially caught by the catcher, it remains a foul ball with two strikes.

When three strikes occur on a batter, it is a &quot;strikeout&quot; and the batter is automatically out unless the pitch is not caught by the catcher or if the pitch bounces before it is caught. It is then ruled an uncaught third strike, an exception to the third strike rule: If the catcher drops the third strike, the batter is permitted to attempt to advance to first base if there are two outs in the inning or if it is unoccupied. In this case, the batter is not out (although the pitcher is awarded a strikeout). The catcher can try to get the batter out by tagging him with the ball or throwing the ball to first base to put him out. (See Doug Eddings (2005 ALCS) and Mickey Owen (1941 World Series) for famous examples of dropped third strikes that dramatically altered the course of post-season series.)

On the fourth ball, it is called a walk, and the batter becomes a runner, and is entitled to advance to first base without risk of being put out, called a &quot;base on balls&quot; or a &quot;walk&quot; (abbreviated BB). If a pitch touches the batter (or the batter&#x27;s clothes), the umpire declares a &quot;hit by pitch&quot; (abbreviated HBP) and the batter is awarded first base, unless the umpire determines that the ball was in the strike zone when it hit the batter, or the batter did not attempt to avoid being hit. In practice, neither exception is ever called unless the batter obviously tries to get hit by the pitch; even standing still in the box will virtually always be overlooked, and the batter awarded first. In addition, if the batter swings at a pitch that hits him, it counts as a strike. If the catcher&#x27;s mitt, catcher&#x27;s mask, or any part of the catcher comes in contact with the batter and/or the batter&#x27;s bat as the batter is attempting to hit a pitch, the batter is awarded first base, ruled &quot;catcher&#x27;s interference&quot;.

====Baserunning====

Once a batter becomes a runner and reaches first base safely, he is said to be &quot;on&quot; that base until he attempts to advance to the next base, until he is put out, or until the half-inning ends. In order to be safe a runner must beat the ball to the bag. When two or more runners are on the basepaths, the runner further along is called a &quot;lead runner&quot; or a &quot;preceding runner&quot;; any other runner is called a &quot;trailing runner&quot; or a &quot;following runner&quot;. Runners on second or third base are considered to be in &quot;scoring position&quot; since ordinary hits, even singles, will often allow them to score.

A runner legally touching a base is &quot;safe&quot;—in most situations he may not be put out. Runners may attempt to advance from base to base at any time (except when the ball is dead). A runner that must attempt to advance is forced, when all previous bases are occupied and a batted ball that touches the ground is a fair ball. The runner forced to advance toward the next base is considered &quot;forced out&quot; if a fielder holding the baseball touches the intended base before the baserunner arrives. When a batted ball is hit in the air, i.e., a &quot;fly ball&quot;, and caught by the defending team, runners must return and &quot;retouch&quot; the base they occupied at the time of the pitch. The common name for this requirement is &quot;tagging up.&quot; If the runner retouches the origin base at any time after the fly ball is first touched by a fielder, he may attempt to advance to the next base or bases at his own risk. The penalty for failing to retouch (if the defensive team notices this) is that the advancing runner can be put out on a live appeal in which the defensive team player with the ball touches the base from which that runner departed prematurely. If a runner tagged up and tries to run to the next base in sequence, they are deemed out if tagged by an infielder at any point before reaching the base or the ball arrives at the base ahead of the runner. However, if the runner is not forced to run to the next base in sequence, they are not deemed out until they are tagged. This often leads to a runner being trapped between two or more infielders trying to tag them before reaching any base: a situation known as being &quot;caught in no-man&#x27;s-land&quot;.

Only one runner may occupy a base at a time; if two runners are touching a base at once, the trailing runner is in jeopardy and will be out if tagged. However, if the trail runner reached the base having been forced there, it is the lead runner who will be out when tagged for failing to reach his force base. Either such occurrence is very rare. Thus, after a play, at most three runners may be on the basepaths, one on each base—first, second, and third. When three runners are on base, this is called &quot;bases loaded&quot;.

Baserunners may attempt to advance, or steal a base, while the pitcher is preparing to make a pitch, while he is making a pitch, or while waiting for a return throw from the catcher after a pitch. The pitcher, in lieu of delivering the pitch, may try to prevent this by throwing the ball to one of the infielders in order to tag the runner; if successful, it is called a &quot;pick-off&quot;. He may also, as part of a planned sequence, throw a pitch well outside and high of the strike zone to his catcher who is waiting for it upright there, and is thus better prepared to throw out a runner trying to steal; this sequence is called a &quot;pitchout.&quot; If the runner attempts to steal the next base, but is tagged out before reaching it safely, he is &quot;caught stealing&quot;. An illegal attempt by the pitcher to deceive a runner, among other pitching violations, is called a balk, allowing all runners to advance one base without risk of being put out.

Another fundamental tenet of the rules of baseball is that a runner who was initially ruled out can subsequently be ruled safe, but once a runner is ruled safe he cannot be called out on the same play, unless he overruns the base. For example, if a baserunner steals second base, beating the throw, an umpire might make the quick call of safe, but if the runner then slides beyond the base and is tagged before he can retreat to it the umpire has the right to change the call. A runner initially called out can be subsequently ruled safe if the fielder putting the runner out drops the ball (on either a tag or force play), pulls his foot off the base (in the case of a force play), or otherwise illegally obstructs a runner from reaching a base that he otherwise would have reached safely.

====Batting and base running strategy====
The goal of each batter is to become a base runner himself (by a base hit, a base on balls, being hit by the pitch, a fielding error, or fielder&#x27;s choice) or to help move other base runners along (by another base hit, a sacrifice bunt, sacrifice fly, or hit and run).

Batters attempt to &quot;read&quot; pitchers through pre-game preparation by studying the tendencies of pitchers and by talking to other batters that previously faced the pitcher. While batting, batters attempt to &quot;read&quot; pitches by looking for clues that the pitcher or catcher reveal. These clues (also referred to as &quot;tipping pitches&quot;) include movements of the pitcher&#x27;s arms, shoulders, body, etc., or the positioning of the catcher&#x27;s feet and glove. Batters can attempt to &quot;read&quot; the spin of a ball early in the pitch to anticipate its trajectory.

Batters also remain keenly aware of the count during their at bat. The count is considered to be in the batter&#x27;s favor when there are more balls than strikes (e.g., two balls and no strikes). This puts pressure on the pitcher to throw a strike to avoid a walk so the batter is more likely to get an easier pitch to hit and can look for a particular pitch in a particular zone or take a riskier or bigger swing. The count is considered to be in the pitcher&#x27;s favor when there are fewer balls than strikes (e.g., no balls and two strikes). This gives the pitcher more freedom to try enticing the batter to swing at a pitch outside the strike zone or throwing a pitch that is harder to control (e.g. a curve, slider or splitter), but that is also harder to hit. Thus the batter will take a more protective swing.

A major strategy in batting at competitive levels of baseball is patient hitting. An example of patient hitting is when a batter has a zero strike count, the batter will almost always look for his perfect pitch. One strike hitting is very similar to no strike hitting and the batter usually is still looking for a good pitch to hit. Two strike hitting, the strategy is changed where the batter will protect the plate by fouling off pitches until the batter is able to find a pitch to hit. This style of hitting allows the hitter to look for a good pitch to hit, and makes the pitcher throw more pitches so that he will tire out faster. This is critical if the batting team is facing a very skilled pitcher who, if allowed to, will take over the game with his ability to get batters to do what he wants them to do.

In general, base running is a tactical part of the game requiring good judgment by runners (and their coaches) to assess the risk in attempting to advance. During tag plays, a good slide can affect the outcome of the play. Managers will sometimes simultaneously send a runner and require the batter to swing (a hit-and-run play) in an attempt to advance runners. On a hit-and-run play the batter will often try to hit to the opposite field (the opposite of the natural tendency for the right-handed hitter to pull the ball to left field and vice versa). Hitting to the opposite field will likely find an opening in the infield vacated by the fielder covering second base. This is because coverage of second base against a steal is best achieved by whichever fielder is closer to second base, the shortstop or the second baseman; and such positioning is aimed at defending against the natural tendency of the hitter.

Typically, the first and second batters are contact hitters, who try to make contact with the ball to put it in play, and then run fast to reach base. The third batter is generally the best all-around hitter on the team, who tries to help baserunners to score runs, and if possible to reach base himself. The fourth batter is the cleanup hitter, and is often a power hitter, who tries to hit home runs.

The fifth and sixth batters often help baserunners to score runs. They often &quot;sacrifice&quot; his at-bat. This can be done by bunting the ball, hitting a fly ball far enough in the air that a baserunner can advance after the catch, or simply making contact with the ball on a hit-and-run play.

During the course of play many offensive and defensive players run close to each other, and during tag plays, the defensive player must touch the offensive player. Although baseball is considered a non-contact sport, a runner may be allowed to make potentially dangerous contact with a fielder as part of an attempt to reach base, unless that fielder is fielding a batted ball. (Noted exceptions to the dangerous contact rule are found throughout amateur competitions, including youth leagues, high school, and college baseball.) A good slide is often more advantageous than such contact, and &quot;malicious&quot; contact by runners is typically prohibited as offensive interference. The most common occurrence of contact of this nature is at home plate between the runner and the catcher, as the catcher is well padded and locked into position that completely blocks home plate from the runner, and the runner will often try to knock the ball out of the catcher&#x27;s hand by running him over. Since the catcher is seen (symbolically and literally) as the last line of defense, it seems natural that more physical play happens.

===Innings and determining a winner===

An &quot;inning&quot; consists of each team having one turn in the field and one turn to hit, with the visiting team batting before the home team. A standard game lasts nine innings, although some leagues (such as high school baseball and Little League) play fewer. Most high school games last seven innings, and Little League has six innings. A single game between two teams during NCAA competition is nine innings. A doubleheader in NCAA competition may be two seven inning games, two nine inning games, or one nine inning game and one seven inning game between the same teams. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins. If the home team is ahead when the middle of the last inning is reached, it is declared the winner, and the last half-inning is not played. If the home team is trailing or tied in the last scheduled inning (or in an extra inning, see below) and they score to take the lead, the game ends as soon as the winning run touches home plate; however, if the last batter hits a home run to win the game, he and any runners on base are all permitted to score.

If both teams have scored the same number of runs at the end of a regular-length game, a tie is avoided by the addition of extra innings. As many innings as necessary are played until one team has the lead at the end of an inning. Thus, the home team always has a chance to respond if the visiting team scores in the top half of the inning; this gives the home team a small tactical advantage. In theory, a baseball game could go on forever; in practice, however, they eventually end. In addition to that rule, a game might theoretically end if both the home and away team were to run out of players to substitute (see Substitutions, below). In Major League Baseball, the longest game played was a 26-inning affair between the Brooklyn Robins and Boston Braves on May 1, 1920. The game, called on account of darkness, ended in a 1–1 tie. Two minor-league teams, the Pawtucket Red Sox and Rochester Red Wings, played a 33-inning game in 1981.

In Major League Baseball, games end with tie scores only in rare cases when conditions make it impossible to continue play. A tie game does not count as a game in the standings—a 2008 rule change made all tie games suspended unless and until not needed for the sake of determining playoff teams, and no longer replayed; however, though undecided, and not factored in the championship standings and the playoff reckoning, a tie game goes on the record and player and team statistics from it are counted. Inclement weather may also shorten games, but at least five innings must be played for the game to be considered official; four-and-a-half innings are enough if the home team is ahead. Previously, curfews and the absence of adequate lighting caused more ties and shortened games—now, games interrupted from ending in such circumstances are, at least initially, suspended. Also, with more modern playing surfaces better able to handle light rains, the process for calling or shortening a game due to weather has changed; it is more common than in the past to delay a game as much as two hours before a cancellation; also, a delay usually does not occur anymore until the rain is moderate-to-heavy and/or there is standing water on some part of the playing field.

In Japan&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball, if the score remains tied after nine innings, up to three extra innings may be played (6 in the playoffs) before the game is called a tie. Since 2011 only regular season games have a 3-hour, 30-minute time limit. Some youth or amateur leagues will end a game early if one team is ahead by ten or more runs, a practice officially known as the &quot;runs ahead rule&quot; (sometimes referred to as a &quot;mercy rule&quot; or &quot;slaughter rule&quot;). Rarely, a game can also be won or lost by forfeit.

There is a short break between each half-inning during which the new defensive team takes the field and the pitcher warms up. An existing pitcher is permitted five warm-up pitches and a new pitcher is permitted eight warm-up pitches. The starting pitcher is permitted eight warm-up pitches to begin the game. Traditionally, the break between the top half and the bottom half of the seventh inning is known as the seventh-inning stretch. During the &quot;stretch&quot;, fans in the United States often sing the chorus of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. However, since the September 11, 2001 attacks, &quot;God Bless America&quot; has often been added to it, especially at games in New York City and Washington, D.C., as well as during the All-Star Game and the postseason. In Atlanta and Baltimore it has been a tradition since 1974 to play &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m A Country Boy&quot; after &quot;Take Me Out To The Ballgame&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch. At Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park, a tradition has brought the singing of &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; in the middle of the eighth inning.

===Substitutions===
Each team is allowed to substitute for any player at any time the ball is dead. A batter who replaces another batter is referred to as a &quot;pinch hitter&quot;; similarly, a &quot;pinch runner&quot; may be used as a replacement for a baserunner. Any player who replaces another player between innings, or while the team is in the field, is known as a &quot;defensive replacement&quot;. A replacement pitcher is called a relief pitcher.

Any replacement is a permanent substitution; the replaced player may not return to the game under any circumstances. Thus, a pitcher that has been removed from the game and replaced by a relief pitcher cannot return to pitch later in the game, and any batter who is replaced by a pinch-hitter cannot take the field in the following inning (or even bat again if his turn comes up again in the same inning). Note however, that two players can switch defensive positions at any time, and both can still stay in the game—because neither has actually been removed from the game. 

In a notable example from 1952, the starting pitcher, Harvey Haddix, switched positions with outfielder Stan Musial in the middle of the game, who became a relief pitcher. Later in the game, after Musial had faced one batter, the players switched back, with Haddix relieving the outfielder-turned relief pitcher. This meant that in practical terms, the starting pitcher was relieved by another pitcher, but then came back to relieve the relief pitcher. Note that this did not violate baseball&#x27;s permanent substitution rule in any way, as at no time did either player leave the game.

This &quot;permanent substitution&quot; rule is in contrast to some other sports, such as basketball, hockey and American football, that practice &quot;free substitution&quot;. In some cases, if the defensive manager responds to the entrance of a pinch-hitter by bringing in a new pitcher, the pinch-hitter may be replaced by another pinch-hitter without having come to the plate, in which case the first pinch-hitter is considered to have entered the game and is ineligible to do so later. However, the defensive manager may not replace a pitcher who has not pitched to at least one batter (three batters in MLB as of 2020), except in case of injury. The reentry of a replaced player into the game is a violation of the permanent substitution rule; if the defense has more than nine players on the field at any time, the umpire must determine who is the tenth player, and that player is ejected from the game.

Many amateur leagues allow a starting player who was removed to return to the game in the same position in the batting order under a re-entry rule. Youth leagues often allow free and open substitution to encourage player participation.

====Pitchers as batters, and the designated hitter====
Pitching is a specialized skill, particularly in the collegiate and professional ranks; so most pitchers are relatively poor hitters, or, those who were skilled batsmen are simply unable to adequately hone their hitting skills to be comparable to regular position players. As a result, unless keeping a given pitcher in the game is a higher priority than the prospect of immediate offense, it is common to substitute for a pitcher when he is due to bat. This pinch hitter is often then replaced by a relief pitcher when the team returns to the field on defense.

A more complicated tactic is the double switch, in which a pitching change is accompanied by the simultaneous replacement of another fielder. If the pitcher is due to bat soon, and the outgoing fielder batted recently, the new pitcher will take the outgoing fielder&#x27;s place in the batting order, thus delaying his next time at bat. A common variation on this involves the introduction of a player who has just pinch hit (or pinch run for the pinch hitter) into the defensive alignment; unless this player becomes his team&#x27;s next pitcher, another field player departs the game, and the new pitcher then assumes that player&#x27;s place in the batting order.

Many leagues allow designated hitters, notably Major League Baseball&#x27;s American League (which instituted the Designated Hitter in 1973 to boost offensive output). A designated hitter (or DH) is a player whose sole purpose is to hit when it would normally be the pitcher&#x27;s turn (or, in some leagues, if the pitcher is a good batter, another weaker batter). This is not considered a substitution, but rather a position, albeit a purely offensive one. A designated hitter does not play in the field on defense and may remain in the game regardless of changes in pitchers. If the designated hitter is moved to a fielding position, the team loses the DH, and the fielder whose position was taken by the former DH is replaced by the pitcher, who assumes that player&#x27;s position in the hitting lineup.

The use of the designated hitter, which reduces the need for complicated strategy like the double-switch, is opposed by many baseball traditionalists. Nevertheless, it is used today at most levels of baseball in the United States and abroad. Major League Baseball&#x27;s National League was the most prominent league that required pitchers to bat, until allowing the designated hitter beginning with the 2022 season.

===Rosters===
The number of players on a major league roster is dictated by the labor agreements worked out between players and management. According to prior rules, a team may have a maximum of 25 men on a roster from Opening Day until August 31. Beginning in the 2012 season, a major league team was allowed to carry a 26th man on its roster when playing the second game of a double-header that was scheduled at least 48 hours in advance. As of 2020, the number has been increased to 26, of whom no more than 14 may be pitchers, with 27 for a doubleheader.

After August 31, during the regular season teams may call up additional personnel to the active roster, up to a maximum of 40 players. This number is rarely actually approached, however, with most teams&#x27; September rosters peaking at around 30 players. In 2020, the number was limited to 28.

In the postseason, rosters are fixed at 25 men. Until 2007, teams could not replace players on their playoff rosters in the event of an injury and had to play out the series shorthanded. Starting in 2007, an injured player could be placed on the disabled list and replaced by another player who was not included on the initial 25-man roster, but the injured player becomes available for the next round of the playoffs should his team advance. This rule applies in most circumstances.

<text>Air Force Base Waterkloof {AFB Wklf} is an airbase of the South African Air Force. It is situated on the outskirts of Pretoria, and is the SAAF&#x27;s busiest airbase. The base&#x27;s name means &quot;water ravine&quot; in Afrikaans and in Dutch. Despite the name, this base is not located in the suburban town of Waterkloof, Pretoria, but lies to the south of Pretoria, to the northeast of Centurion, Gauteng and from AFB Swartkop, at an elevation of 1506 metres (4940 ft).

The base motto is &quot;Acquirit Qui Tuetur&quot; (He Obtains Who Defends).

==Units currently hosted==
* 21 Squadron – VIP transport
* 28 Squadron – Medium transport
* 41 Squadron – Light transport
* 44 Squadron – Light transport

==History==

The base was officially opened on 1 August 1938 as Waterkloof Air Station.
Since that time it has always been in the service of the SAAF. It was upgraded to Air Force Base during World War II.

==Aviation==
* Non-directional beacon – WL315.0
* VHF omnidirectional range – WKV116.9
* Tower – 124.1

==Controversy==

On 30 April 2013 a flight full of Indian citizens who had come to attend a wedding of the Gupta family landed at Waterkloof airbase. This was in contravention of South African law since the airbase is classified as a National Key Point; in theory not available to be used for personal air travel by unaffiliated private individuals. It was later alleged that former president Jacob Zuma is the one who ordered the flight to land. The incident would later earn the moniker &quot;Guptagate&quot; in the South African media.

In April 2023 the President of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and his family landed at the base during their vacation to a South African game lodge in the Eastern Cape. This resulted in comparisons with the landing of Gupta family members at the base 10 years before whilst also closely following the unsuccessful extradition of the Guptas from custody in the UAE to face trail for corruption in South Africa. 

In May 2023, a year after Russia&#x27;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, a US-sanctioned Russian transport plane landed at the airport carrying an unknown cargo. The landing further strained South African-United States relations by increasing American skepticism of South Africa&#x27;s self-proclaimed neutral stance in the conflict.

<doc id="895965" wikidata="Q7580395" url="?curid=895965" title="Spring Branch, Houston">
<text>Spring Branch is a district in west-northwest Harris County, Texas, United States, roughly bordered by Tanner Road and Hempstead Road to the north, Beltway 8 to the west, Interstate 10 to the south, and the 610 Loop to the east; it is almost entirely within the city of Houston. Established by the Texas Legislature, the Spring Branch Management District exercises jurisdiction over the area.

Several minor bayous run through the community, including Brickhouse Gully, Spring Branch (the neighborhood namesake), and Briar Branch, which drain into Buffalo Bayou in central Houston. Spring Lake is a large pond near the center of the neighborhood.

Spring Branch includes significant immigrant Korean American and Hispanic American communities, and was established in the 1800s as a rural German American community.
As of 2020 Spring Branch East/West population has grown by 7,298 residents and over 400 new construction homes built.

== History ==

Spring Branch began as a religious German farmer settlement; many of the farmers owned dairies. Karl Kolbe, who arrived in Texas from Germany in 1830, was Spring Branch&#x27;s earliest settler. The Germans opened sawmills to cut area timber. In 1848, St. Peter&#x27;s United (Lutheran) Church opened on a site donated from the Bauer family; the lumber used in the construction originated from one of the local sawmills. The Spring Branch School Society, sponsored by the church in 1856, eventually became the Spring Branch Independent School District.

Yellow fever outbreaks in 1859 and 1867 killed many residents.

The early settlers all had roads named after their families – Gessner, Conrad Sauer, Witte, Wirt, Blalock, Campbell, Hillendahl, Bauer, Fries, and Neuens.

After World War II James E. Lyon served as a developer in Spring Branch.

The eastern part of Spring Branch was annexed by the City of Houston in the 1940s while the western part was annexed in the 1950s. In the mid-1950s, efforts to create a Spring Branch municipality failed. Following this, the Memorial villages, a group of six independent municipalities, formed. Houston annexed the rest of the Spring Branch area. In the mid-to-late 20th century, Spring Branch had a rural suburban character with dirt roads and horses in the area. Spring Branch Elementary School, one of several area elementary schools, was an all-White elementary school.

Apartment complexes opened in the Spring Branch area around the 1970s. In 1982, the City of Houston Housing Authority proposed a $3.8 million U.S. dollar public housing unit at Emnora Lane. The city encountered strong opposition from civic clubs, city council members, and state representatives, so the city housing officials canceled the project. The sign used by the city to indicate the proposed site repeatedly received spray paint graffiti stating &quot;no niggers.&quot;

By the 1980s, Houston&#x27;s economy had collapsed and occupancy rates declined. Many apartment complexes faced foreclosure, bankruptcy, and changes in ownership. Bill Zermeno, a city electrical inspector, said in a 1988 &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; article that many of the apartments with some of the strongest violations against maintenance-related city laws were in Spring Branch. Kim Cobb, the author of the 1988 &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; article, said that many of the poorly maintained complexes were located next to well-maintained single family subdivisions.

From the 1980 U.S. Census to the 1990 Census, many Hispanics settled in parts of Spring Branch; in pockets of Spring Branch almost all of the immigration was from Central American countries. The Hispanic population increased by an amount between 1,000 and 3,500 per square mile. In 1997 S.D. Kim, the Houston bureau chief of &quot;The Korea Times&quot;, said that Koreatown, the Korean community in Spring Branch, grew because of inexpensive housing and the zoning to the Spring Branch Independent School District. In 1998 and again in 2001, a proposal to place Korean language street signs in Koreatown lead to political controversy; the reaction against the proposal lead to the withdrawal of the proposal. By 2006, Spring Branch Elementary School was mostly Hispanic, reflecting demographic changes in the Spring Branch area. By 2007 several older houses were torn down and replaced with newer houses; new homeowners came to Spring Branch to buy larger lots, to buy in an area cheaper than neighborhoods bordering Downtown Houston. New residents came due to the proximity to Downtown, Uptown, and the Energy Corridor.

In May 2011 the Spring Branch Central Super Neighborhood campaigned against having federal funds used to improve older apartment complexes in the area.

In 2013 &quot;Houstonia&quot; magazine stated that Spring Branch, including the adjacent cities of Hillshire Village and Spring Valley Village, was one of the &quot;25 Hottest Neighborhoods&quot; of Houston.

On May 5, 2016, a four alarm fire occurred on May 5, 2016, in Houston&#x27;s Spring Branch area, not to be confused with the municipality of Spring Branch, TX, north of San Antonio Texas

On November 24, 2022, a gunman opened fire and shot four people, two fatally during Thanksgiving in the Spring Branch neighborhood.

==Cityscape==
Spring Branch is generally bounded by Beltway 8 on the western end, the 610 Loop on the eastern end, Interstate 10 on the southern end, and U.S. Highway 290 and Tanner Road to the north.

The district is in proximity to Downtown Houston, the Energy Corridor, the Memorial City District (including Memorial City Mall and the Memorial Hermann Hospital Memorial City), the Texas Medical Center, Uptown Houston (including The Galleria), and Westchase.

Terrence McCoy of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said in 2012 that in Spring Branch &quot;[a]venues lined with orderly yards and American flags buttress shopping centers where Spanish dominates.&quot;

As of 2012 there are different varieties of housing in Spring Branch. Spring Branch West includes many 1960s ranch-style houses. The central portion of Spring Branch has houses which are worth about $500,000 as of 2012. The eastern portion of Spring Branch, which is blue collar, has many bungalow houses with wood siding. &quot;Houstonia&quot; wrote that &quot;Up until [the 2000s] or so, much of Spring Branch had a rural feel. It wasn’t uncommon to see pastures full of horses, relics of its past life as farmland tilled by generations of German immigrants&quot;.

In 1983 there were a travel agent, an optical shop, multiple restaurants, a newsstand, a bookstore, a pharmacy, and a furniture store in Spring Branch catering to Koreans.

==Economy==
John Nova Lomax of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said that Spring Branch has many &quot;old-school ethnic eateries&quot; and described Long Point Road, Spring Branch&#x27;s main road, as &quot;thrift store nirvana&quot;. The journalist added that Long Point has few chain businesses and stores. The Koreatown portion has various Korean restaurants.

La Michoacana Meat Market has its headquarters in Spring Branch and in Houston. BJ Services Company has its headquarters in the Spring Branch district and in unincorporated Harris County. Tesco Corporation has its headquarters in the Spring Branch district and in Houston. Cameron International Corporation&#x27;s Drilling and Production Systems center is in the Westway Business Park in Spring Branch and in an unincorporated area.

Previously, Igloo Corporation had a manufacturing facility in Spring Branch. The Spring Branch location also housed the company headquarters. In 2004, Igloo announced that it was consolidating to a location in unincorporated Waller County, Texas, near Katy.

Before its dissolution, Weiner&#x27;s had its headquarters in Spring Branch and in Houston. At one time, AppleTree Markets had its headquarters in Spring Branch and in Houston.

By 2008 a Super H Mart supermarket, a part of a Korean American chain, opened. Purva Patel of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote that this supermarket attracted development to the area.

====Local politics====
As of 2012, according to Bob Stein, a Rice University political scientist, voters in Houston City Council District A tend to be older people, conservative, and White American, and many follow the Tea Party movement. The voting base is such despite the presence of large Hispanic neighborhoods within District A. In the 2011 election voters in Spring Branch, for City Council District A, favored Tea Party candidate Helena Brown over the incumbent, Brenda Stardig, because Stardig supported a &quot;rain tax,&quot; passed in 2010, that lead to taxation of churches. However, Stardig later voted to exempt church- and non-profit-property-owners from the &quot;rain tax&quot;. The taxation of churches had a negative reception with political conservatives in Spring Branch. In the 1990s a small portion of Spring Branch was in City Council District G. In 1989, during a city council race, many in Spring Branch voted for Jim Westmoreland for an at-large position. Westmoreland drew controversy after reports of a joke that was characterized as &quot;racist&quot; spread. Beverley Clark, the opponent and a Black teacher, defeated Westmoreland in that race.

==Demographics==
Between the 1990 U.S. Census and the 2000 U.S. Census, as Spring Branch gained many Hispanic and Korean residents, many white residents left. Nestor Rodriguez, an immigration expert from the University of Houston, said that the white population of Spring Branch implied that many were leaving not because of racial differences but because the new residents were not middle class. Rodriguez said, &quot;They don&#x27;t say they&#x27;re not middle-class, but they say, well, look at them, they&#x27;re out on the street corners looking for work; we&#x27;re not used to that. But those are characteristics of working-class or lower working-class people.&quot;

In 2000, the City of Houston&#x27;s Super Neighborhoods located all or in part within Spring Branch reported the following population statistics:

==Health care==

The Spring Branch Medical Center, located in Spring Branch, was the first hospital outside of the Texas Medical Center to perform open heart surgery.

It serves ethnic Koreans and Korean speakers in the archdiocese. The area has a Polish American house of worship, Our Lady of Czestochowa Roman Catholic Parish, established in the 1980s. At the time Polish immigrants who resisted Communist rule in that country arrived in Houston. Other Spring Branch Catholic churches include Our Lady of Walsingham Church, St. Catherine of Siena Church, and St. Jerome Church.

The Islamic Society of Greater Houston (ISGH) operates an area house of worship for Muslims, the Spring Branch Islamic Center. It houses the Islamic primary school ILM Academy.

<text>Jan Ingemar Stenmark (; born 18 March 1956) is a Swedish former World Cup alpine ski racer. He is regarded as a legendary skier and one of the most prominent Swedish athletes ever, having won several Olympic medals and world cups during his career. When he retired in 1989, he held the record for the greatest number of international race wins, a record that was only broken in 2023 by Mikaela Shiffrin and remains unbroken amongst men. He competed for Tärna IK Fjällvinden.

==Biography==

Born in Joesjö, Storuman Municipality, Lapland, Stenmark and his family moved to Tärnaby near Norway when he was four years old. He became a childhood neighbour of Stig Strand (also born 1956), who tied Stenmark for the World Cup slalom title in 1983. Stenmark began skiing at the age of five and won his first national competition at age eight.

==Competitive record==
Stenmark made his World Cup debut in December 1973 at age 17. At the time of his retirement, he had won more international races than any other alpine skier to date: he took 86 World Cup wins (46 giant slaloms and 40 slaloms). He has since been passed by Mikaela Shiffrin. Stenmark won only in the two technical disciplines: slalom and giant slalom (the other events are downhill, super-G, first run in December 1982, and combined). He prioritized these disciplines over the high-speed downhill events, preferring to master the intricacies of skiing technique. His trainer, Hermann Nogler, once observed, &quot;I watched him. He was always trying to find a better way, a smoother way, a faster way through the gates.&quot; He rarely competed in the other disciplines, as he was not comfortable with speeds in excess of . He won first place overall in the 1976 World Cup, becoming the first Scandinavian to do so, his first of three straight World Cup titles (1976–78). Stenmark still holds the record for the biggest win margin in a World Cup alpine race: 4.06 seconds ahead of 2nd placed Bojan Križaj in Jasna on 4 February 1979. Stenmark was known as a quiet champion, with short, but polite, responses to media questions.

For his three straight World Cup titles (1976–78), Stenmark earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1979 (shared with Erik Håker and Raisa Smetanina). Stenmark also earned the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal twice (1975, 1978). His 1978 medal was shared with tennis player Björn Borg, making them the only two men to ever win the honor twice (female alpine skier Anja Pärson received the medal in 2006 and 2007). Additionally, Stenmark stands alone as the only male skier to win eight World Cup titles in a single discipline – both in slalom and giant slalom.

At the World Championships in 1978 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen West Germany, Stenmark won the slalom by two-thirds of a second and the giant slalom by over two seconds, and successfully defended both world titles at the Winter Olympics in 1980 at Lake Placid, which also were counted as world championships. At the next worlds in 1982 in Austria, he had a sub-standard first run in the giant slalom and was upset by American Steve Mahre and settled for silver. Stenmark rebounded in the slalom and became the first to win the same title in three consecutive world championships. At age 25, it was his final medal in a major competition. 

Stenmark&#x27;s exploits led to him being described as the &quot;slalom king&quot; meaning that when he was not allowed to participate in the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo by the International Ski Federation (FIS) for accepting promotional payments directly, rather than through the national ski federation, it was a major blow to the Swedish team&#x27;s medal hopes. Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein was also banned; both were double gold medalists in 1980. Marc Girardelli, who was the best slalom racer during the 1983–84 season, was also banned for other reasons. Stenmark returned to Olympic competition in 1988 but was past his prime and did not medal despite achieving the fastest second run of the slalom competition. 

He retired from World Cup competition at the end of the 1989 season in March, days before his 33rd birthday. At the time, he held the record for World Cup race wins, a record which held until 2023 when it was broken by Mikaela Shiffrin.

==Other==
During the years from 1976 to 1978 Stenmark, along with tennis player Björn Borg, became a national icon in Sweden. This was not changed by the fact that he moved to Monaco in 1980 for tax reasons. At age 40, he won the Swedish Superstars championship in 1996. On 26 December 2004, Stenmark survived the Indian Ocean earthquake while on vacation in Thailand. In 2015, he was a celebrity dancer on the Let&#x27;s Dance 2015, where he teamed up with professional dancer Cecilia Ehrling.

He serves as an ambassador for the Börje Salming ALS Foundation, named after his close friend and Swedish ice hockey player who died of ALS in 2022.

In 2024, at the age of 68, Stenmark participated in the World Masters Athletic Championship where he jumped three meters and placed eighth overall.

==Personal==
Stenmark was married to Ann Uvhagen, a Lufthansa airline hostess, 1984–1987. They have a child, born 1984.

<text>Army Group North () was the name of three separate army groups of the Wehrmacht during World War II. Its rear area operations were organized by the Army Group North Rear Area.

The first Army Group North was deployed during the Invasion of Poland and subsequently renamed Army Group B. The second Army Group North was created on 22 June 1941 from the former Army Group C and used in the northern sector of the Eastern Front from 1941 to January 1945. By then, this second Army Group North had gotten trapped in the Courland Pocket and was accordingly redesignated Army Group Courland. On the same day, the former Army Group Center, which was now defending the northernmost sector of the contiguous Eastern Front, was renamed Army Group North, assuming the status of the third and final iteration of the army group.
== First deployment of Army Group North: September – October 1939 ==

The staff of Army Group North was formally assembled on 2 September 1939 from the headquarters of 2nd Army, which in turn had been activated just a few days prior, on 26 August. Fedor von Bock, commanding general of 2nd Army, became the first commanding general of Army Group North.

During the Invasion of Poland, Army Group North had two armies placed under its supervision: 3rd Army (Georg von Küchler) and 4th Army (Günther von Kluge). Additionally, it held four divisions as part of its army group reserves: 10th Panzer Division, 73rd Infantry Division, 206th Infantry Division and 208th Infantry Division.

On the morning of 1 September 1939, 3rd Army began its advance from East Prussia southwards towards central Poland, whereas 4th Army attacked from Pomerania into the Danzig Corridor.

Important battles by the 3rd Army during the Polish campaign included the Battle of Grudziądz, the Battle of Mława, the Battle of Różan, the Battle of Łomża, the Battle of Wizna and the Battle of Brześć Litewski. Important battles of the 4th Army included the Battle of Tuchola Forest, the Battle of Westerplatte, the Battle of Hel and the Battle of Gdynia.
== Second deployment of Army Group North: June 1941 – January 1945 ==

=== Invasion of the Soviet Union ===

In preparation for Operation Barbarossa, Army Group North was reformed from Army Group C on 22 June 1941. Army Group North was commanded by Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb and staged in East Prussia. Its strategic goal was Leningrad, with operational objectives being the territories of the Baltic republics and securing the northern flank of Army Group Centre in Northern Russia between Western Dvina River and Daugavpils-Kholm Army Group boundary. On commencement of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Baltic offensive operation the army group deployed into Lithuania and northern Belorussia. It served mainly in Baltic territories and north Russia until 1944. Commander in Chief 22 June 1941: Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb.

Its subordinate armies were deployed with the following immediate objectives:
* 18th Army - from Koenigsberg to Ventspils - Jelgava
* 4th Panzer Group - Pskov
* 16th Army - Kaunas, Daugavpils
* Army Group troops
** Army-Group signals regiment 537
** Army-Group signals regiment 639 (2nd echelon)

==== The Baltic offensive operation ====
All operational objectives such as Tallinn were achieved despite stubborn Red Army resistance and several unsuccessful counter-offensives such as the Battle of Raseiniai, and the army group approached Leningrad, commencing the Siege of Leningrad. However, while the Baltic states were overrun, the Siege of Leningrad continued until 1944, when it was lifted as a result of the Red Army Leningrad-Novgorod strategic offensive operation.

In September 1941, the Spanish Blue Division was assigned to Army Group North.

After becoming trapped in the Courland Cauldron after 25 January 1945, the Army Group was renamed Army Group Courland. On the same day, in East Prussia, a new Army Group North was created by renaming Army Group Center. On the 2 April 1945, the army group was dissolved, and the staff formed the 12th Army headquarters.

=== Campaign in East Prussia ===
Army Group North (old Army Group Centre), was driven into an ever smaller pocket around Königsberg in East Prussia. On April 9, 1945 Königsberg finally fell to the Red Army, although remnants of Army Group units continued to resist on the Heiligenbeil &amp; Danzig beachheads until the end of the war in Europe.

<text>A cacodemon (or cacodaemon) is an evil spirit or (in the modern sense of the word) a demon. The opposite of a cacodemon is an &quot;agathodaemon&quot; or &quot;eudaemon&quot;, a good spirit or angel. The word &quot;cacodemon&quot; comes through Latin from the Ancient Greek , meaning an &quot;evil spirit&quot;, whereas &quot;daimon&quot; would be a neutral spirit in Greek. It is believed to be capable of shapeshifting. A cacodemon is also said to be a malevolent person.

In psychology, cacodemonia (or ) is a form of insanity in which the patient believes that they are possessed by an evil spirit. The first known occurrence of the word &quot;cacodemon&quot; dates to 1593. 

In astrology, the 12th house was once called the Cacodemon for its association with evil. Defined as &quot;a noise-making devil&quot;, Jane Davidson has noted an illustrated example of a cacodemon in editions of Ulisse Aldrovandi&#x27;s &quot;Monstrum Historia&quot; (Story of Monsters) as late as 1696.

==Examples==
*There is a painting by Paul Klee called &quot;Cacodaemonic&quot; (1916).
*In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; Act 1 Scene 3, Queen Margaret calls Richard a &quot;cacodemon&quot; for his foul deeds and manipulations. 
*In John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Knight of Malta&quot;, Norandine calls Mountferrat, the play&#x27;s villain, a &quot;cacodemon&quot; in the final scene.
*A cacodemon enemy appears in the &quot;Doom&quot; video game series, starting with the first game in 1993.

<doc id="895974" wikidata="Q5100457" url="?curid=895974" title="Chinese Garage">
<text>The Chinese Garage is a former garage and petrol station situated in Beckenham in the London Borough of Bromley, on a roundabout linking Beckenham, Eden Park and Shortlands. Built in 1928 to a Japanese pagoda style design by Edmund B. Clarke, it was voted the most unusual garage in England in 2001. It currently hosts a Tesco Express and Majestic Wine store.

==History==

The garage was built in 1928 to a design by Edmund B. Clarke in the style of a Japanese pagoda on land adjoining Stone Park Farm which was part of the Langley Court Estate. At that time Stone Park Avenue had not been laid out and the main traffic route was north–south between Beckenham and West Wickham; this accounts for the alignment of forecourt.

Local folklore suggests that the Langley Court&#x27;s former owners, the Bucknell family, were shipping magnates that underwrote the &quot;Titanic&quot;. Subsequently when it sank they financially sank too, hence the sale of their estate. It is further reputed that during their travels, the Bucknells regularly visited the Far East and Japan and brought back many exotic plants for the Estate which is said to have inspired Clarke to build the Garage in its distinctly Japanese style. However, no traces of such planting survive today on the Estate to substantiate this claim. It may well be that the design was purely the whim of the architect and his client.

Because of its oriental appearance it became known locally as &quot;The Chinese Garage&quot; although the official name was Langley Park Garage until 1989. It is now a Grade II listed building.

The building was previously part of a Kia and Peugeot car dealership and is no longer used as a petrol garage but retains much of its historic character and the grounds and adjoining roundabout are planted in a complementary manner. The building now contains a Tesco Express and a Majestic wine shop. Bromley Council rejected plans for a Tesco express due to traffic and parking concerns in the area but was overruled by the Government 

As of November 12, 2020 the garage was opened as a Majestic Wine store.

==Architectural awards==

The Chinese Garage was the winner of a Better Petrol Stations competition organised by the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and the Gardeners&#x27; Guild in the 1930s and in 2001 was voted the most unusual garage in England.

<doc id="895982" wikidata="Q325634" url="?curid=895982" title="Cilice">
<text>A cilice , also known as a sackcloth, was originally a garment or undergarment made of coarse cloth or animal hair (a hairshirt) worn close to the skin. It is used by members of various Christian traditions (including the Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist, and Scottish Presbyterian churches) as a self-imposed means of repentance and mortification of the flesh; as an instrument of penance, it is often worn during the Christian penitential season of Lent, especially on Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, and other Fridays of the Lenten season.

Hairshirt cilices were originally made from coarse animal hair, as an imitation of the garment worn by John the Baptist that was made of camel hair, or sackcloth which, throughout the Bible, was worn by people repenting. Cilices were designed to irritate the skin; other features were added to make cilices more uncomfortable, such as thin wires or twigs. In modern Christian religious circles, cilices are simply any device worn for the same purposes, often taking the form of a hairshirt cilice as well as a (spiked metal) chain cilice.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;cilice&quot; derives from the Latin , a covering made of goat&#x27;s hair from Cilicia, a Roman province in south-east Asia Minor. The reputed first Scriptural use of this exact term is in the Vulgate (Latin) translation of Psalm 35:13, (&quot;But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth&quot; in the King James Bible). The term is translated as &quot;hair-cloth&quot; in the Douay–Rheims Bible, and as &quot;sackcloth&quot; in the King James Bible and Book of Common Prayer. Sackcloth can also mean burlap, or is associated as a symbol of mourning, a form of hairshirt. 

==Use==

There is some evidence, based on analyses of both clothing represented in art and preserved skin imprint patterns at Çatalhöyük in Turkey, that the usage of the cilice predates written history. This finding has been mirrored at Göbekli Tepe, another Anatolian site, indicating the widespread manufacturing of cilices. Ian Hodder has argued that &quot;self-injuring clothing was an essential component of the Catalhöyük culturo-ritual entanglement, representing &#x27;cleansing&#x27; and &#x27;lightness&#x27;.&quot;

In Biblical times, it was the Jewish custom to wear a hairshirt (sackcloth) when &quot;mourning or in a public show of repentance for sin&quot; (Genesis 37:34, 2 Samuel 3:31, Esther 4:1). In the New Testament, John the Baptist wore &quot;a garment of camel&#x27;s hair&quot; as a means of repentance (Matthew 3:4). As such, adherents of many Christian denominations have worn sackcloth to repent, mortify the flesh or as a penance, especially for sins relating to lavishly adorning oneself (cf. 1 Peter 3:3, 1 Timothy 2:9).

Cilices have been used for centuries in the Catholic Church as a mild form of bodily penance akin to fasting. Thomas Becket was wearing a hairshirt when he was martyred, St. Patrick reputedly wore a cilice, Charlemagne was buried in a hairshirt, and Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Germany, famously wore one in the Walk to Canossa during the Investiture Controversy. Prince Henry the Navigator was found to be wearing a hairshirt at the time of his death in 1460. St. Francis of Assisi, St. Ignatius of Loyola, St. Thomas More and St. Therese of Lisieux are known to have used them. Scottish king James IV wore a cilice during Lent to repent of the indirect role he played in his father&#x27;s death. In modern times they have been used by Mother Teresa, St. Padre Pio, and Pope Paul VI. In the Discalced Carmelite convent of St. Teresa in Livorno, Italy, members of Opus Dei who are celibate (about 30% of the membership), and the Franciscan Brothers and Sisters of the Immaculate Conception continue an ascetic use of the cilice. According to John Allen, an American Catholic writer, its practice in the Catholic Church is &quot;more widespread than many observers imagine&quot;.

Some high church Anglicans, including Edward Bouverie Pusey, wore hairshirts as a part of their spirituality.

In the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, influenced by the evangelical revival, penitents were dressed in sackcloth and called in front of the chancel, where they were ordered to admit their sins.

In some Methodist churches, on Ash Wednesday, communicants, along with receiving ashes, also receive a piece of sackcloth &quot;as a reminder of our own sinful ways and need for repentance&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In Thomas Pynchon’s 1997 postmodern historical novel &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;, upon arriving at a Jesuit college in Quebec the character Eliza Fields is dressed in a cilice by nuns as a sadomasochistic punishment after having admitted to feelings of sexual arousal during her prior capture by a group of Native Americans. The spiked form of cilice, fashioned from a rose plant, that Pynchon’s character experiences appears to be based on those used by the 20th century Opus Dei. The cilice has been interpreted as a deliberate narrative device to muddy the historical accuracy of the novel and point to the relevance of historical slavery in the contemporary United States.

In Dan Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, one of the antagonists, an albino numerary named Silas associated with the religious organization Opus Dei, wears a cilice in the form of a spiked belt around his thigh. The sensationalized depiction in the novel has been criticized for its inaccuracy in subsequent books and by Opus Dei itself, which issued a press release responding to the movie&#x27;s depiction of the practice, claiming &quot;In reality, they cause a fairly low level of discomfort comparable to fasting. There is no blood, no injury, nothing to harm a person&#x27;s health, nothing traumatic. If it caused any harm, the Church would not allow it.&quot;

The goat hair of Thomas More, presented for safe keeping by Margaret Clement, was long in the custody of the community of Augustinian canonesses who until 1983 lived at the convent at Abbotskerswell Priory, Devon. Some sources, including one from 2004, claimed that the shirt was then at the Martyr&#x27;s church on the Weld family&#x27;s estate in Chideock, Dorset. In 2011 the shirt was put on public display at Buckfast Abbey, near Buckfastleigh in Devon.

<text>Milan Horáček (born 30 October 1946 in Velké Losiny, Czechoslovakia) is a Czech-born German politician, a founding member of the German Green Party, a former member of the Bundestag (1983–1985) and a former Member of the European Parliament (2004–2009).

From 1965 to 1967 his political activism got him into trouble with the Czechoslovak communist regime, and he was arrested several times. After the suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, he fled from Czechoslovakia and settled in West Germany. There he worked in industry and for a trade union magazine. From 1976 to 1981 he studied political science in Frankfurt, and in 1979 was involved in the establishment of &quot;Die Grünen&quot;. In the 1980s he was active in Hesse for the party, was a municipal councillor in Frankfurt 1981–1983, and was elected to the Bundestag in 1983, serving until 1985, as a member of its Foreign Affairs Committee. His main interests there were foreign affairs and security, Central and Eastern Europe and human rights. From 1985 to 1990, he was a group specialist on foreign and security policy, human rights and Eastern Europe.

Besides his political work, Horáček engaged in Czechoslovakian exile activities. He was publisher of the Czech exile magazine &quot;Listy&quot; (&quot;Sheets&quot;). In 1990 his Czech citizenship was restored and president Václav Havel appointed him to the Council of Advisers. He was director of the Heinrich Böll Foundation&#x27;s office in Prague from 1991 to 2004, and also worked at its Bonn office 1998–2000.

As a candidate of the Green Party federations of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia he was elected to the European Parliament in June 2004. He also participates in activities of Green Party in the Czech Republic and was not reelected to European Parliament in June 2009.

In 2008, he co-organized (with Gisela Kallenbach) a public hearing in the European Parliament on totalitarian regimes in support of the Prague Declaration. He co-sponsored the European Parliament resolution of 2 April 2009 on European conscience and totalitarianism.

<text>David Park (March 17, 1911 – September 20, 1960) was an American painter and a pioneer of the Bay Area Figurative Movement in painting during the 1950s.

==Biography==
David Park was born in Boston, the son of Mary Turner and Charles Edward Park. His father was a Unitarian minister. He attended the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor Connecticut and was recognized for his early talent by the sculptor Evelyn Longman Batchelder, the headmaster&#x27;s wife. 

He moved to Los Angeles at the age of 17, staying with his aunt Edith Park Truesdell who was an artist, so he could study at Otis Art Institute in 1928. A year later, he moved to Berkeley where he married Lydia Newell in 1930, and with whom he had two daughters, Natalie and Helen. His first solo show was in 1933 at the Oakland Art Gallery. 

In 1943, he began teaching at California School of Fine Arts (CSFA), now known as San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI). During the economic depression, Park returned to Boston to teach art at the Winsor School for Girls.

David Park was one of the post-World War II alumni of the San Francisco Art Institute which was called the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA) at the time. He revived an interest in figurative art, at first experimenting with still-abstracted forms that relied on color for their impact, dynamics and warmth. Park, along with Richard Diebenkorn and Elmer Bischoff, broke away from the philosophy of painting promoted by Clyfford Still, who taught at the Institute, forming what would later be called the Bay Area Figurative Movement. Their influence may be seen in the work of later Bay Area Figurative School artists such as Paul John Wonner, Nathan Oliveira, Manuel Neri, Henry Villierme, Henrietta Berk and Joan Brown.

Although these painters started out painting in what was called an objective style, deploying abstract shapes in large space, they soon migrated to using the physical world and representative subjects to experiment with shape, color, texture and temperature in their painting. Park realized that concentrating on principle and abstraction drew attention to the painter rather than the painting. He felt that it was important to focus on the present, to develop responses to nature. &quot;I believe that we are living at a time that overemphasizes the need of newness, of furthering concepts&quot;.

Park worked with figurative painting from about 1950 until about 1959 when he became ill with cancer. Usually working from memory, he initially painted what he saw: kids playing in the street, musicians, his friends, people in their houses. Toward the end of the decade he painted classical studio nudes and bathers in a monumental style. After he became too ill to work with oils, he continued working with watercolors which he produced until his early death in 1960, at the age of 49, of cancer. Park was working at the University of California as an Associate Professor of Art up until he died. He was painting his best works in the final years of his life and career.

==Legacy==
In 1988, Park received a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. Another Park retrospective was held from 2020–2021 at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

Park&#x27;s &quot;Standing Male Nude in the Shower&quot;, painted between 1955 and 1957, sold for $1,160,000 at Sotheby&#x27;s New York on May 15, 2007.

<doc id="895994" wikidata="Q545072" url="?curid=895994" title="Diddy Kong Racing">
<text>Diddy Kong Racing is a 1997 kart racing game developed and published by Rare for the Nintendo 64. The game revolves around Diddy Kong and his friends&#x27; attempt to defeat the intergalactic antagonist, a wizard pig named Wizpig, through winning a series of races. The player takes control of any of the featured characters throughout the game. &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; features five &quot;worlds&quot; with four racetracks each, and the ability to drive a car, hovercraft, or pilot an aeroplane.

Development began after the release of &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot; (1996), and was intended to be an adventure game known as &quot;Wild Cartoon Kingdom&quot; in its early stages. As time progressed, the focus of development shifted from a Walt Disney World-influenced racing game to a unique title named &quot;Pro-Am 64&quot;, in which Nintendo had no involvement. Due to the delays of &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, Rare felt that they needed a stronger intellectual property to attract a wider audience for a game scheduled to release before Christmas 1997, thus making the decision to centre the game around Diddy Kong.

&quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; received critical acclaim upon release. The graphics, audio and gameplay were among the most lauded aspects, while some criticism was directed at the game&#x27;s repetition. It sold 4.8 million copies since release and stands as the Nintendo 64&#x27;s eighth best-selling game. A sequel named &quot;Donkey Kong Racing&quot; was in development for the GameCube, but was abandoned in August 2002, one month before Microsoft purchased Rare for £375 million. An enhanced remake for the Nintendo DS titled &quot;Diddy Kong Racing DS&quot; was released worldwide in early 2007; it was the final Nintendo-published game to be developed by Rare.

==Gameplay==

In &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, players can choose one of ten characters, who have access to three different vehicles: car, hovercraft and aeroplane. The car is an all-round vehicle, but it is the slowest on certain surfaces like sand and water. The hovercraft is designed for both sand and water areas, but lacks in acceleration and manoeuvrability. The aeroplane is designed to access aerial areas; it is good at acceleration and manoeuvring, but has the slowest speed. Each racetrack has a set of boosters known as &quot;zippers&quot; that temporarily boost the player&#x27;s speed, as well as featuring regenerating balloons of various colours that provide power-ups. There are five different types of balloons: red, blue, green, yellow, and rainbow. Red balloons grant missiles to attack racers ahead, blue balloons grant a speed boost, yellow balloons grant shields to protect the player from attacks, green balloons grant deployable traps to delay other racers, and rainbow balloons grant a magnet ability that brings the player closer to the nearest racer. If multiple balloons of the same colour are picked up, the power-up is upgraded to a more powerful version. A total of two upgrades are available for each balloon. Additionally, racetracks contain non-regenerating bananas that add to speed when they are picked up. A maximum of ten bananas will improve the speed, but can also be obtained to prevent other players from gaining speed. If a racer gets hit, two bananas are deducted.

In &quot;Adventure Mode&quot;, players control the racer of their choice to progress through the story. Players begin in the hub world, which links five interconnected worlds; Dino Domain, Snowflake Mountain, Sherbet Island, Dragon Forest, and Future Fun Land. The worlds are opened up by collecting balloons, except for Future Fun Land, which is unlocked after defeating Wizpig for the first time and rank 1st place in all four Trophy Races of the original worlds. Each world contains four racetracks, an unlockable battle stage and a race against a boss character. If the player defeats Wizpig in Future Fun Land, obtains all amulet pieces and collect all the gold medals, the player will be able to play in a mode called &quot;Adventure 2&quot;. In this mode, all the balloons change colour to platinum and the tracks are inverted from left to right. The game also features four battle modes which consist of two deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag-style battle and a mode which involves opponents capturing eggs. The battle modes are not initially selectable, and must be unlocked by collecting special keys hidden in each of the worlds.

==Plot==
The plot of &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; is detailed in the instruction booklet. Timber the Tiger&#x27;s parents go on holiday and leave their son in charge of the island they live on, prompting him and his friends to organise a race. Their enjoyment is interrupted when a sinister intergalactic pig-wizard named Wizpig arrives at Timber&#x27;s Island and attempts to take it over after having conquered his own planet. He turns the island&#x27;s four guardians (Tricky the Triceratops, Bluey the Walrus, Bubbler the Octopus, and Smokey the Dragon) into his henchmen. The only solution available to the island&#x27;s inhabitants is to defeat Wizpig in an elaborate series of races that involve cars, hovercraft, and aeroplanes. Drumstick the Rooster, the best racer on the island, fails this challenge and is transformed into a frog by Wizpig&#x27;s magic.

Timber hires a team of eight racers: Diddy Kong, the first recruit; Conker the Squirrel and Banjo the Bear, recruited by Diddy; Krunch the Kremling, Diddy&#x27;s enemy who follows after him; Tiptup the Turtle, T.T. the Stopwatch, Pipsy the Mouse, and Bumper the Badger, all inhabitants of Timber&#x27;s island. Aided by Taj, an Indian elephant-like genie residing on the island, they eventually complete all of Wizpig&#x27;s challenges and confront Wizpig himself to a race and defeat him. Shortly afterward, Drumstick is turned back into a rooster, and Wizpig leaves for his home planet, Future Fun Land. Fearing that Wizpig would again attempt to invade Timber&#x27;s Island, the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a second challenge. When Wizpig loses the second race, the rocket he rides on malfunctions and launches him to the moon. However, an additional cutscene reveals Wizpig&#x27;s spaceship flying through the sky, unscathed.

==Development==
Development of the game began after the release of &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot;, in which a team was split into making &quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot; for the Nintendo 64 and a new racing game for that console. During development, the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon evolved into an adventure game called &quot;Wild Cartoon Kingdom&quot;, with which Nintendo had no involvement. In June 1997, the game was altered to &quot;Pro-Am 64&quot;, an unrelated follow-up to the NES racing game &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot;. According to Lee Schuneman, the &quot;Pro Am 64&quot; project featured three-wheeled trikes in contrast to radio-controlled cars.

With &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; being delayed until the summer of 1998, the team was adamant for a release of an AAA video game in time for 1997&#x27;s Christmas season. After successfully demoing the game to Shigeru Miyamoto, he felt that &quot;Pro Am 64&quot; did not have a strong enough intellectual property to capture the attention of consumers, and suggested rebranding the game around a widely-recognized Nintendo character, and thus Rare changed the licence to feature Diddy Kong. According to Lee Musgrave, the decision to choose Diddy Kong rather than Donkey Kong was based on their own choice, a decision which Nintendo &quot;enjoyed&quot;. Once the intellectual property was changed, the team were left to adapt the visual aesthetics of the game and packaging before it could be released. Musgrave recalled that the ultimate goal of the game was to make it &quot;run as fast&quot; as &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;, which proved difficult during development as the latter game utilised 2D character sprites whereas &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; used fully 3D models. Musgrave later attributed the success of the overall project due to the &quot;small team&quot; of 14 people who worked on it. In an October 2012 interview, Musgrave said that Timber the Tiger would have been the main character of &quot;Pro Am 64&quot; had the intellectual property for &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; not been conceived. Two of the characters who featured in &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, Banjo the Bear and Conker the Squirrel, starred in games (&quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; and &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, respectively) which were unveiled to the public before &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, at the June 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), but ultimately not released until after &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;. Rare stated that they chose not to exhibit &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; at E3 because of the proprietary animation technology used in the game.

The game&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by David Wise. The soundtrack was first released in Japan on 1 April 1998, with 42 tracks, while a version of the album was released in Europe with the same number of tracks. For its United States release only 16 tracks were featured. The disc itself was specially shaped in the form of Diddy Kong&#x27;s head, which was unplayable in certain CD players. The sound effects were created by Graeme Norgate. Voices were provided by Kevin Bayliss (Bubbler, Wizpig), Johnni Christensen (Tiptup, Smokey), Eveline Novakovic (Pipsy), Keith Rabbette (Bluey), Lee Ray (Drumstick, Taj), Lee Schuneman (Bumper), Chris Seavor (Conker), Dean Smith (T.T.), Joe Stamper Jr. (Timber, Kid Background Voices), Kimberly Stamper (Kid Background Voices), and Chris Sutherland (Diddy Kong, Banjo, Krunch, Tricky).

===Release===
Due to most of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s planned 1997 Christmas season line-up being delayed until 1998, &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; became the main Nintendo 64 release for the holiday shopping season, and a majority of Nintendo&#x27;s $200 million advertising budget for the entire year was allocated to promoting the game. The game had a $20 million marketing budget in North America. &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; also held the distinction of being the only game in the North American Christmas season line-up for which development was contracted by Nintendo; the other two first-party Nintendo 64 games in the line-up, &quot;Bomberman 64&quot; and &quot;Mischief Makers&quot;, were both licensed from Japanese third-party publishers.

==Reception==

The game received critical acclaim upon release. The Nintendo 64 version holds an aggregate score of 89% at GameRankings based on 20 reviews and 88 at Metacritic based on 15 reviews, whereas the Nintendo DS remake received a score of 67% at GameRankings based on 42 reviews and a score of 63 at Metacritic, based on 39 reviews. &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; sold approximately 4.5 million copies worldwide; which included 3.78 million copies sold in the United States and PAL regions, and 653,928 copies in Japan. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, it took home a &quot;Gold&quot; prize for revenues above €15 million in the European Union during the previous year. It stands as the Nintendo 64&#x27;s eighth best-selling game, and broke one million units sold in the United States within three weeks of its release.

The graphics and gameplay were the most praised aspects of the game. Some critics noted how it minimised pop-up without resorting to the use of distance fog. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; disputed this, saying that the game has both pop-up and distance fog in amounts comparable to the average Nintendo 64 game. He nonetheless stated that the game was a &quot;pleasure to look at&quot; and praised the detail of the tracks. Doug Perry of &quot;IGN&quot; heralded the visuals as the most &quot;spectacular of its kind&quot;, and praised Rare&#x27;s ability to master dynamic animation through enabling polygons to span larger surfaces without loss of framerate. Furthermore, Perry stated that the game&#x27;s technical achievements were enough to leave &quot;even the most critical Japanese gamer [to] look upon with smiling eyes&quot;.

Although Crispin Boyer opened his review of the game for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (EGM) with the warning &quot;Don&#x27;t dismiss this out-of-the-blue racer as a &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; clone&quot;, most reviews compared the two games. Gerstmann suspected Nintendo of rushing &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; to market in order to fill a quarter left vacant by delays of other Nintendo games, and argued it was much too soon after &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;″s debut to release such a similar game. Other critics, including Boyer&#x27;s &quot;EGM&quot; co-reviewers, focused on &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;″s perceived superiority to &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;. Dan Hsu of &quot;EGM&quot; said it &quot;beats &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; in every department&quot;, particularly mentioning the superior balance and level designs. &quot;Edge&quot; praised the adventure and progression aspect of the game, stating that the game&#x27;s single-player mode is &quot;everything &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; should have been.&quot;

The character designs met with a variety of opinions. &quot;EGM&quot;″s Shawn Smith praised the characters as &quot;hilarious&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot;, by contrast, said the character designs are &quot;pathetic and obvious, molded from the same cookie cutter as Banjo-Kazooie and Conker&quot;, noting the formulaic use of anthropomorphic animal characters and the simplistic application of each animal&#x27;s characteristics to gameplay. Perry felt that the vocals of characters in the game were &quot;heartwarming&quot; and &quot;comical&quot;, while also stating that &quot;some of the characters are just too damn cute and are certain to annoy older gamers.&quot;

Overall assessments of the game were mostly positive. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for sound and a perfect 5.0 in control, graphics, and fun factor, calling it &quot;a feverishly fun Nintendo 64 racer that combines elements of &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;, &quot;Wave Race 64&quot;, and &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; into one spectacular game.&quot; &quot;EGM&quot; named it &quot;Game of the Month&quot;, with its four reviewers lauding the challenging gameplay and numerous objectives to tackle. Gerstmann instead counted the latter as the game&#x27;s greatest weakness, arguing that having to repeatedly play through the same courses with slightly different objectives makes the game excessively repetitive. He concluded that the game is far better than &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;, but the repetitiveness &quot;ultimately kills it.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; fell more in line with the majority, remarking that the combination of racing and adventure elements works well, and that &quot;&quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; shows Rare&#x27;s pure craftmanship, displaying keen subtleties that eventually win players over.&quot;

In a retrospective review, Andrew Donaldson of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; stated that the game was visually &quot;incredibly vibrant&quot; and &quot;captivating&quot; for a game of the early Nintendo 64 era. Scott McCall of &quot;AllGame&quot; acknowledged its only shortcoming was its &quot;excessive&quot; amount of clipping, although he admitted it was not &quot;unbearable&quot;. He praised the wide range of audio in the game, including its voice acting and soundtrack; he heralded the music as &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;fitting&quot; to its race tracks, also considering it superior to that of &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;. Donaldson criticised game&#x27;s presentation as too &quot;cutesy&quot;, especially in terms of the characters&#x27; voices. However, he praised the &quot;upbeat&quot; and &quot;catchy&quot; soundtrack, saying that each track had its own unique tune to suit the distinct environment. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 79th on a list of the greatest Nintendo games of all time.

&quot;EGM&quot; named &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; &quot;Racing Game of the Year&quot; at its 1997 Editors&#x27; Choice Awards. &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; was awarded with &quot;Console Racing Game of the Year&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences in 1998, beating &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;, &quot;Moto Racer&quot; and &quot;NASCAR 98&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Cancelled sequel and spin-offs===
After the release of &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, Rare began development on a sequel named &quot;Donkey Kong Racing&quot; for the GameCube, which featured Donkey Kong as the titular character. A pre-rendered CG video of the game was shown at E3 2001, which displayed a parody of the speederbike scene from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. According to Lee Musgrave, the game featured a unique mechanic which involved riding on animals rather than driving vehicles. The player could switch between different types of animals mid-race; larger animals could destroy obstacles, whereas smaller ones allowed more manoeuvrability. Development of &quot;Donkey Kong Racing&quot; was cancelled when Nintendo turned down the opportunity to purchase its remaining 51 percent stake in Rare, and the developer was bought out by Microsoft for £375 million in 2002.

After the buyout, Rare took what had been done with &quot;Donkey Kong Racing&quot; and created a prototype for the Xbox which expanded into an adventure game similar to the original setup of &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;. Musgrave stated that the concept was essentially &quot;built from scratch&quot; and featured a limited multiplayer version at one point. The concept was in development over 18 months and evolved from being an animal-orientated racing game to an open-world game with Tamagotchi-style features, in which nurturing animals was a &quot;key mechanic&quot;. By this point, &quot;Donkey Kong Racing&quot; had evolved into &quot;Sabreman Stampede&quot;, part of Rare&#x27;s &quot;Sabreman&quot; series. &quot;Sabreman Stampede&quot; was set for release on the Xbox 360, but was cancelled due to a lack of focus and Rare&#x27;s unfamiliarity with the hardware.

Aside from &quot;Donkey Kong Racing&quot;, two other sequels to &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; were in development. One, named &quot;Diddy Kong Pilot&quot;, with planes as the only vehicle, was planned for a release on the Game Boy Advance. Originally announced alongside &quot;Donkey Kong Racing&quot; at E3 2001, the game became &quot;Banjo-Pilot&quot; after Nintendo sold their share of Rare to Microsoft. At the time of its announcement, the game featured the ability to play using a tilt function as well as a D-pad, and contained at least five tracks. The other, titled &quot;Diddy Kong Racing Adventure&quot;, was a rejected pitch made by Climax Studios for the Nintendo GameCube around 2004. The project was never announced to the public in any capacity, and only became known after a video game archivist acquired the prototype and published a video about it in November 2016.

As Timber was bypassed as the main character in &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, Rare&#x27;s next game was planned to keep Timber as the main character, according to Kev Bayliss. This game was originally planned as &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; for the Nintendo 64, with Timber as a time traveller to a prehistoric period and gameplay similar to &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, but over time, they found it better to replace Timber with wholly new characters. This game became &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; for the GameCube at the suggestion of Nintendo.

===Remake===
&quot;Diddy Kong Racing DS&quot; is a Nintendo DS remake of &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;. Developed by Rare and published by Nintendo, it was released in February 2007 in North America, and April in Europe and Australia. This version received enhanced visuals and framerate in addition to touchscreen functions and Rumble Pak support for force feedback. Four new &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; themed racetracks were included in the remake, along with several modifications to the soundtrack. Banjo and Conker were replaced by Tiny Kong and Dixie Kong, while new playable characters Taj and Wizpig were also added. The DS version also features new modes which allow the player to create their own racetracks, customise their game through recording character voices and drawing player icons, and an online multiplayer function. The battle modes were restricted to multiplayer only, with the custom racetracks replacing them in Adventure Mode. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release, with critics asserting that the new additions were &quot;gimmicky&quot; and the touchscreen controls felt &quot;horribly sensitive&quot;.

===The &quot;Diddy Laugh&quot;===
In the game&#x27;s opening sequence, the sound of children laughing can be heard when the Rare logo is displayed. This stock sound effect is part of a library called &quot;The Premiere Edition Volume 1&quot; released by sound producer and distributor The Hollywood Edge for use of stock sounds in media. Although it had been used previously in various films and television shows, this sound effect has come to be commonly referred to as &quot;the Diddy laugh&quot; due to its association with the game. According to Kevin Bayliss, the team got the idea of including a laugh sound effect in the opening from &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, which had just begun airing at the time. They asked Tim Stamper&#x27;s children, Joe Stamper Jr. and Kimberly Stamper, to laugh and sing in their new sound booth. The Stamper children&#x27;s laughter was used alongside the original sound effect.

<text>Cricket clothing and equipment is regulated by the laws of cricket. Cricket whites, sometimes called flannels, are loose-fitting clothes that are worn while playing cricket so as not to restrict the player&#x27;s movement. Use of protective equipment, such as cricket helmets, gloves and pads, is also regulated.

== Clothing and protective gear ==

* Collared shirt (white in tests and domestic; as per team kit in one-day formats) with short or long sleeves depending on the climate or personal preference.
* Long trousers (white in tests and domestic and first class cricket; as per team colour kit in one day format or T20).
* Sweater (a knitted jersey, if necessary). This may be long-sleeved or sleeveless (slipover).
* Sun hat, cricket cap or baseball cap during hot summer times 
* Spiked shoes to increase traction.
*Protective equipment
** Jockstrap with a cup pocket into which a &quot;box&quot;, or protective cup, is inserted and held in place.
** Abdominal guard or &quot;box&quot; for batsmen and wicket-keepers (often referred to as a &quot;cup&quot; or &quot;abdo guard&quot;). It is usually constructed from high-density plastic with a padded edge, shaped like a hollow half-pear, and inserted into the jockstrap with the cup pocket underwear of the batsmen and wicket-keeper. This is used to protect the crotch area against impact from the ball.
** Helmet (often with a visor), worn by batsmen and fielders close to the batsman on strike to protect their heads.
** Leg pads, worn by the two batsmen and the wicket-keeper, used to protect the shin bone against impact from the ball. The wicket-keeping pads are slightly different from the batsmen&#x27;. Fielders that are fielding close to the batsmen may wear shin guards under their trousers. 
** Thigh guards, arm guards, chest guards, and elbow guards protect the body of the batsmen. Some batsmen use these and others do not, since they reduce mobility. 
** Gloves for batsmen only, thickly padded above the fingers and on the thumb of the hand, to protect against impact from the ball.
** Wicket-keeper&#x27;s gloves for the wicket-keeper. Usually includes webbing between the thumb and index fingers.

Batsmen are allowed to wear gloves while batting. The batsman can be also caught out if the ball touches the glove instead of the bat, provided the hand is in contact with the bat. This is because the glove is considered to be the extension of the bat. The batsmen may also wear protective helmets, usually with a visor, to protect themselves. Helmets are usually employed when facing fast bowlers. While playing spinners, they might not be used (though injuries are still possible).

Fieldsmen cannot use gloves to field the ball. If they wilfully use any part of their clothing to field the ball they may be penalised five penalty runs to the opposition. If the fielders are fielding close to the batsman, they are allowed to use helmets and leg guards worn under their clothing.

As the wicket-keeper is positioned directly behind the batsman, and therefore has the ball bowled directly at them, they are the only fielder allowed to wear gloves and (external) leg guards.

Cricket clothing is generally white in Test cricket, as is traditional, but limited-overs cricket players generally have clothing based on team colours, similar to other sports.

== Equipment ==

* Ball – A red, white or pink ball with a cork base, wrapped in twine covered with leather. The ball should have a circumference of unless it is a children&#x27;s size.
* Bat – A wooden bat is used. The wood used is from the Kashmir or English willow tree. The bat cannot be more than long and wide. Aluminium bats are not allowed. The bat has a long handle and one side has a smooth face.
* Stumps – three upright wooden poles that, together with the bails, form the wicket.
* Bails – two crosspieces made of wood, placed on top of the stumps.
* Sight screen – A screen placed at the boundary known as the &quot;sight screen&quot;. This is aligned exactly parallel to the width of the pitch and behind both pairs of wickets.

<doc id="896007" wikidata="Q7496772" url="?curid=896007" title="Shilparatna">
<text>Shilparatna is a classical text on traditional South Indian representational-performing arts. It is particularly influential in painting and theatrical performance. It was authored by Srikumara in 16th century AD. In this the word &quot;Shilpa&quot; (sculptural) &quot;Ratna&quot; (Gems) is used as a broad term embodying artistic forms that either uses the body as a medium of expression (like Dance, Drama or Dance-Drama) or that which represents the body as an expression (like Sculptures and mural arts). It ranks only after the Natya Shastra and the Abhinaya Darpana as a text of fundamentals on the performing arts. 

It lays down the tenets of painting such as the proper set of colours and the right combinations which leads to stylized balance and rhythm. It is adhered to as principles in South Indian paintings known as Dravidian mural art or Dravidian mural painting. The text describes yellow, white, red and terreVerte as the pure colours. These colours could be used as single colours or in combinations to make another chroma. 

The Shilparatna also lays down principles for stage performance, like the optimal space for a performance. The &quot;NatyaGriha&quot; (classical Dance spaces and theatres), &quot;Natya&quot; (Postural dance) and &quot;Griha&quot; (house) in Kerala is made according to these principles and those laid down by the Natya Shastra. It describes the elaborate codified language of &quot;mudras&quot; (stylized gestures and symbolic signs by the hands and body posture used in Bharatanatyam and Kathakali) as &quot;angikabhinaya&quot;, meaning body-expressions.

<text>The Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians was a title and role in the Canadian Cabinet that provided a liaison (or, interlocutor) for the federal Canadian government, and its various departments, to Métis and non-status Aboriginal peoples (many of whom live in rural areas), and other off-reserve (e.g., urban) Aboriginal groups.

The role was created with the purpose of serving those Indigenous people who were excluded from the activities of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, which was officially responsible only for Status Indians—largely those living on Indian reserves. In 2004, the Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat were transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, which established a new sector named Office of the Federal Interlocutor (OFI), assigning it the staff, programs, and funding of the former Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat.

As of 4 September 2012, the portfolio dealing with Métis and Non-Status Indians was moved from the OFI to the Policy and Strategic Direction branch of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada in order to streamline program management and business processes.

== History ==
The role was created in 1985 in the context of the Aboriginal Constitutional Conferences (1983-1987) with the purpose of serving those Indigenous people who were excluded from matters of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, which was officially responsible only for Status Indians—largely those living on Indian reserves. More specifically, the federal government found it necessary to designate a Minister who could act as a first point of contact to facilitate the participation of such groups in the Indigenous constitutional process. The portfolio was assigned to a senior Minister in addition to other titles and roles.

The role was kept independent from that of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development until 2004, when the office was made &quot;ex officio&quot; the Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians. Over the intervening decades, the mandate evolved and broadened to include bilateral relations between the federal government and national Métis and non-status Indian organizations; tripartite self-government processes with off-reserve Aboriginal groups and the provinces; and advocacy of Métis, non-status Indian, and urban Aboriginal people issues within Cabinet and Government; among other things.

Also in 2004, along with program authorities, the Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat were transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. This Department established a new sector named Office of the Federal Interlocutor (OFI), assigning it the staff, programs, and funding of the former Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat.

As of 4 September 2012, the portfolio dealing with Métis and Non-Status Indians was moved from the OFI to the Policy and Strategic Direction branch of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada in order to streamline program management and business processes.

<doc id="896020" wikidata="Q1989225" url="?curid=896020" title="Captain (cricket)">
<text>The captain of a cricket team, often referred to as the skipper, is the appointed leader, having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players. As in other sports, the captain is usually experienced and has good communication skills, and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team, as the captain is responsible for the team selection. Before the game the captains toss for innings. During the match the captain decides the team&#x27;s batting order, who will bowl each over, and where each fielder will be positioned. While the captain has the final say, decisions are often collaborative. A captain&#x27;s knowledge of the complexities of cricket strategy and tactics, and shrewdness in the field, may contribute significantly to the team&#x27;s success.

Due to the smaller coaching/management role played out by support staff, as well as the need for greater on-field decision-making, the captain of a cricket team typically shoulders more responsibility for results than team captains in other sports.

==Captain&#x27;s responsibilities==

===During a match===

====The toss====
Starting from team selection and then toss
Before the start of a match the home captain tosses a coin and the away captain calls heads or tails. The captain who wins the toss is given the choice of whether to bat or bowl first. The decision usually depends on the condition of the pitch and whether it is likely to deteriorate, the weather conditions and the weather forecast.

The decision also depends on the relative strengths of the team&#x27;s batting and bowling. For instance in Test cricket, a side with only fast bowlers may choose to bowl first to try to take advantage of any early moisture in the pitch, knowing that it will be harder to take wickets later in the match. Similarly a side with a weak opening batting pair may choose to bowl first in order to protect their batsmen.

====Fielding positions====
The captain decides where the fielders will stand, in consultation with the bowler and sometimes other senior players. The fielding positions will usually be dictated by the type of bowler, the batsman&#x27;s batting style, and the captain&#x27;s assessment of the state of the match (and hence whether to set an attacking or a defensive field).

====Bowling====
The captain decides when each bowler will bowl. If a batsman is seeking to dominate the current bowler, the captain may ask someone else to bowl; alternatively, keeping the bowler on may be deemed the best chance of getting the batsman out or restricting the scoring rate. If the regular bowlers are not achieving the desired results, the captain may decide to use non-regular bowlers to attempt to unsettle the batsmen. The captain may also change the bowlers around to introduce variation, and to prevent the batsmen getting &quot;set&quot;.

In limited overs cricket the captain additionally has to make certain that bowlers bowl no more than their allotted maximum number of overs, and that experienced bowlers are available at the end of the batting side&#x27;s innings, when the batsmen are usually looking to take risks to attack and score quickly.

In the longer forms of cricket, when a new ball becomes available the captain decides whether to use it, and when given that it can be taken any time after it becomes available.

====Batting order====

When the team bats, the captain decides the batting order. In professional cricket the captain usually changes the established batting order only for exceptional reasons, because batsmen tend to specialise in batting at certain positions. However, in certain circumstances it may be in the team&#x27;s interest to change the batting order. If quick runs are needed, a naturally attacking batsman may be promoted up the order. A player who is &#x27;in form&#x27; may be promoted to a higher batting position, at the expense of a player who is &#x27;out of form&#x27;.

If a wicket falls near the end of a day&#x27;s play, especially if the light is failing, or if the bowlers seem particularly confident, the captain may choose to send in a non-specialist batsman, referred to as a nightwatchman. If the nightwatchman does not get out before the end of that day&#x27;s play then the specialist batsman will have been protected, and will not need to bat until the following day when conditions are likely to have improved. If the nightwatchman does get out, the cost of losing a late wicket will have been minimised, because the specialist batsman is still available to bat.

====Declarations====
The captain may declare the team&#x27;s innings closed at any time, but usually only does so as an attacking ploy, for instance if the captain thinks the team has enough runs to win the match, or if a sudden change in conditions has made it advantageous to bowl rather than bat.

====Follow-on====
In a two-innings match, if the situation arises the captain decides whether to impose the follow-on.

Appeals

Fielding captains may withdraw appeals with consent of the umpires. This often occurs in cases of injury, miscommunication, or unsportsmanlike conduct, and is considered to uphold the spirit of cricket and fair play within the game.

====Miscellaneous====
The captain is also consulted on whether an injured batsman from the opposing team may use a runner when batting. Permission is usually given if the batsman has become injured during the course of the match, but if the batsman was carrying the injury at the start of the match then the captain may refuse. (As of 2012, runners are not allowed in Test cricket and injured batsmen are required to continue batting with the injury or retire hurt.)

===Other duties===
As well as decisions taken either immediately before or during a match, captains also often have some responsibility for the good running of the cricket club. For instance, they may decide when the team is to practice, and for how long. In professional cricket the captain often has some say in who will form the squad from which teams are selected, and may also decide how young up-and-coming players are to be encouraged and improved, and how members of the squad who are not regularly selected for first-team matches are to gain match practice.

Prior to July 2015, the captain was responsible for deciding when to take batting and bowling powerplays in limited overs matches.

==Vice-captain==
The captain may be assisted by a vice-captain or in some instances joint vice-captains. This is particularly useful if the captain is forced to leave the field of play during fielding. Some teams also allocate the vice-captain a more or less formal role in assisting with team selection, discipline, field-setting and so on. Sometimes the role of vice-captain is seen as preparation for the player(s) becoming the captain of the side in future.

<text>Rock Profile is a British television comedy show written by and starring comedy partnership Matt Lucas and David Walliams, both later widely known for the sketch show &quot;Little Britain&quot;. &quot;Rock Profile&quot; first appeared on the channel UK Play in 1999, directed by Michael Cumming, before moving to BBC Two in 2000. The show was revived for a one-off special for Comic Relief in 2022.

The show comprises a series of spoof interviews, involving Jamie Theakston questioning Lucas and Walliams who play famous musicians. The interviews are often bizarre and involve broad, unflattering caricatures or fictional characteristics. They are often interspersed with videos by the featured artist, including humorous captions and congratulations from other impersonated celebrities.

== Broadcast history ==
The first series was broadcast in 1999, comprising 13 episodes, on digital channel UK Play. The series was then picked up by BBC Two, with a second series of 13 episodes following in 2000. Series one was later shown on BBC Two. In November 2001, a special 45-minute episode of the series was broadcast, entitled &quot;Rock the Blind&quot;. The episode followed Gary Barlow (Lucas) and Ronan Keating (Walliams) as they recorded a charity single. Ted Robbins appeared as Pete Waterman, and Sara Cox as herself. Following the episode, the series saw a break of two years.

In October 2001, several sketches were featured in the re-launch of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, entitled &quot;The All-New Top of the Pops&quot;. All of the sketches were filmed backstage, featuring characters which had appeared in the previous two series. People who were unaware of the show at the time did not understand the segments and complaints were made regarding the sketch with Lucas as Elton John, where he was verbally harassed by an audience member. The sketch was subsequently cut from all future repeat screenings of the episode, it now can only be seen as an extra on the DVD release.

In 2009, a third series was recorded by Walliams and Lucas and was made available on the website Funny or Die for free viewing. The third series replaced host Jamie Theakston with new host Dermot O&#x27;Leary. The first episode aired virally on 11 May 2009, and featured a mock interview with Jordan and Peter Andre. A one-off special aired as part of Comic Relief Red Nose Day 2022, with Vernon Kay as host interviewing Lucas and Walliams portraying Michael Ball and Alfie Boe, Adele, Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Lewis Capaldi, Miley and Billy Ray Cyrus, and Post Malone.

== Examples of musicians parodied ==
* Shirley Bassey (Lucas) and Tom Jones (Walliams) – Shirley Bassey is portrayed as claiming to have more hits than she actually does. Jones is portrayed as a befuddled has-been who confuses the names of other artists who have told him he was &quot;the greatest singer of his generation.&quot;
* ABBA are reluctantly reunited after interviews with Benny Andersson &amp; Björn Ulvaeus. 
* Boy George (Lucas) and Marilyn (Walliams) – Both characters are portrayed as thinking they are female and Marilyn claims interviewer Jamie Theakston has made him pregnant and that he needs to provide for his baby.
*Ringo Starr (Walliams) – Ringo Starr is portrayed as believing himself to be Thomas the Tank Engine&#x27;s representative on Earth. He claims that Thomas has asked him to do both good and bad things. 
*Simon &amp; Garfunkel – Simon (Lucas) and Garfunkel (Walliams) are portrayed as hating each other, and both try to prove that they are more successful than the other. They use a curtain and even a brick wall to separate themselves. 
*Bono (Walliams) – Bono is portrayed as an irritating Englishman who loves to phone Salman Rushdie and can&#x27;t understand why his fellow U2 bandmates persist in speaking with an Irish accent. The Edge (Lucas) points out that it is because they are Irish.
*Elton John (Lucas) – Elton John is portrayed as a moody, temperamental prima donna.
*George Harrison (Lucas) – George Harrison is portrayed as speaking with a strong Indian accent and keeps a poppadum in his top pocket, yet cannot understand why people keep talking about his Indian influences. He also produces bizarre films plots; for example: one man&#x27;s love for his sandal. 
* Lee and H from Steps (Walliams and Lucas respectively) are portrayed as five-year-olds. 
*Liam Gallagher (Walliams) – Liam Gallagher is portrayed as a foul-mouthed house husband whose wife, Patsy Kensit (Lucas), constantly embarrasses him and ruins his &#x27;hard-man&#x27; image by exposing him as a friend of Mary and Jeffrey Archer.
*Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees is portrayed as a bully who bosses his brothers Maurice (Lucas) and Robin around. In the episode, Barry resembles the Cowardly Lion from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He even has a tail. 
*Blur – Damon Albarn (Lucas) is portrayed as a Cockney working-class hero, who says his life is like the musical &quot;Oliver&quot;. Alex James (Walliams) is portrayed as being very confused about many things, such as his sexuality. 
*Geri Halliwell (Lucas) – Geri Halliwell is portrayed as a patronising moron who stalks and has delusions about marrying George Michael (played by both Lucas and Walliams on separate occasions). According to Geri, everything is &quot;Girl Power&quot;. &quot;All base metals, Girl Power. The River Nile, Girl Power. Clive Anderson, dictionary definition of Girl Power&quot;. 
*Paul McCartney (Lucas) – Paul McCartney is portrayed as fed up with people asking about his solo career. He announces &quot;People keep asking me... what&#x27;s the hidden message at the end of &#x27;Simply Having a Wonderful Christmas Time&#x27;?... Y&#x27;know, 30 years ago I was in a band called The Beatles... but no one ever wants to talk about that!&quot; When Theakston, overjoyed at Paul&#x27;s apparent willingness to talk about the Beatles, questions him on John Lennon, McCartney soberingly muses &quot;Y&#x27;know the saddest thing? No one ever mentions him.&quot; 
* Eurythmics – Dave Stewart (Lucas) is portrayed as a mad scientist who claims to have created Annie Lennox (Walliams) – who is portrayed as a creature similar to that from Mary Shelley&#x27;s &#x27;Frankenstein&#x27; – from parts of corpses. 
* Happy Mondays – Bez (Walliams) is portrayed as a professionally trained dancer who went to the Ramhurst School, claiming that he was in the year above Darcey Bussell. Shaun Ryder (Lucas) is portrayed as mumbling, incoherent and an unenthusiastic interviewee.
* Gary Barlow (Lucas) and Howard Donald (Walliams) from boy band Take That – Gary Barlow and Howard Donald are portrayed as constantly thinking about reforming the band. Gary is portrayed as a mean-spirited bully and Howard portrayed as childlike. When Theakston asks Gary if he still speaks to Robbie Williams, Gary responds &quot;Yeah, I phone Robbie up every week – don&#x27;t tell him it&#x27;s me though&quot;.
* Graham Coxon (Walliams) – Graham Coxon (of Blur) is portrayed as a musically inept, paranoid pyromaniac who speaks in hushed tones until he categorically states he didn&#x27;t &quot;start the fire&quot;.
* Andy Warhol (Lucas) – Andy Warhol is portrayed as living in a flat with Lou Reed (Williams). This sketch was the direct influence for Lou and Andy in &quot;Little Britain&quot;, only Lucas looks like Andy Warhol and isn&#x27;t in a wheelchair. They do however both use the same voices as Lou and Andy. Reed asks Warhol what he wants for his tea, to which Warhol replies &quot;chippy&quot;. Reed then goes into a long explanation about how he had chippy for his lunch and can&#x27;t have it twice. Warhol replies &quot;Yeah, I know&quot;, and a catchphrase was born. &quot;So what do you want then?&quot;, to which Warhol replies: &quot;Chippy&quot;. 
* Kylie Minogue (Walliams) and her sister Dannii Minogue (Lucas) – The sisters are portrayed as being extremely jealous of each other and during their interview take great pride in pointing out each other&#x27;s failures. Dannii tells Kylie, &quot;the whole family was so proud when your last single went to number 27 in the charts&quot;. 
* Prince (Lucas) – Prince is portrayed as an alcoholic Glaswegian tramp, performing his hits on acoustic guitar and harmonica as a busker. Although the introduction to the episode claims he is living in Glasgow, he is busking on the Uxbridge Road in London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush.

== Reception ==
&quot;Rock Profile&quot; has been well received by critics. &quot;Radio Times&quot; described the show as &quot;truly silly and truly inspired&quot;. &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; described it as &quot;excellent comedy&quot;.

== DVD release ==
Both original series of &quot;Rock Profile&quot; was released on DVD in 2005, which also included &quot;Rock the Blind&quot; and the sketches made for &quot;TOTP&quot; and &quot;The Ralf Little Show&quot;; all commercial music was excised from the DVD version of the series.

<text>Timothy L. McInnerny ( ; born 18 September 1956) is a British actor. He is known for his many roles on stage and television, including as Lord Percy Percy and Captain Darling in the 1980s British sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot;.

==Early life==
McInnerny was born on 18 September 1956 in Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire, the son of Mary Joan (née Gibbings) and William Ronald McInnerny. He has one sister, Lizzy, who is also an actress. He was brought up in Cheadle Hulme and in Stroud, Gloucestershire, and educated at Marling School, a grammar school in Stroud, and read English at Wadham College, Oxford, matriculating in 1976 after taking a gap year backpacking around the world.

==Career==

=== Television ===
McInnerny&#x27;s first role was in &quot;Blackadder&quot; during the 1980s. He played the two bumbling related aristocrats with the same name of Lord Percy Percy in the first series (&quot;The Black Adder&quot;) and the second series (&quot;Blackadder II&quot;); he declined to appear in the third series for fear of being typecast, though he did make a guest appearance in one episode and returned to play Captain Kevin Darling in the fourth series (&quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;).

He had a minor but significant role in the highly acclaimed 1985 BBC TV serial &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; as Emma Craven&#x27;s boyfriend Terry Shields. More recent TV appearances include &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot; (2011) as a man wrongly convicted of murdering his daughter, and &quot;New Tricks&quot; (2012). In 2016, McInnerny joined the cast of the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; in Season 6 as Lord Robett Glover.

In 2007 McInnerny spoke candidly about his love of ITV sitcoms, after receiving criticism for his views expressed on the BBC cult show &quot;I Love the &#x27;70s&quot;: &quot;I think shows like &quot;Mind Your Language&quot; and &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; need to be remembered for what they were; truly fantastic examples of sitcom writing that hasn&#x27;t been seen since. The content is unfortunate in the cold light of modern society, but that&#x27;s no reason to stop praising the sheer brilliance of the writers that ITV had in its ranks during that decade.&quot;

Television
===Film===
===Radio===
===Theatre===
In 1985 he was cast in &quot;Pravda&quot; alongside Anthony Hopkins.

He played Dr Frank-N-Furter in the 1990 West End production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. His performance can be heard on the soundtrack album of this production.

In summer 2007, he played Iago in &quot;Othello&quot; at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe on Bankside in London.

<doc id="896026" wikidata="Q7379907" url="?curid=896026" title="Runner (cricket)">
<text>In cricket, a runner is a team member who runs between the wickets for an injured batsman. This is covered by Law 25 of the Laws of Cricket.

When a runner is used, the batsman stands in position and plays shots as normal, but does not attempt to run between the wickets: the runner runs for them. The runner occupies the injured batsman&#x27;s crease when they are on strike, but takes up a position away from the pitch at the umpire&#x27;s discretion, typically on a pitch parallel to that being used for the game.

When the injured batsman moves off strike, they then take up the position near the square leg umpire (not at the bowler&#x27;s end), and the runner stands next to the bowler&#x27;s wicket as in the normal course of play.

*A runner can only be used if the umpires, together, are satisfied that the batsman has sustained an injury during the match that affects their ability to run.
*The runner must be a member of the batting side, but not the twelfth man.
The runner must also already have batted in the innings, if possible.
*The runner must wear all the external protective equipment worn by the batsman and must carry a bat.

If &quot;either&quot; the injured batsman or their runner is out of their ground, the batsman is liable to be run out or stumped. The runner is also subject to other laws such as obstructing the field.

In June 2011, the International Cricket Council announced that, from 1 October 2011, runners could no longer be used in international cricket.

<doc id="896028" wikidata="Q80518" url="?curid=896028" title="Jorund">
<text>Jorund or Jörundr (5th century) was a Swedish king of the House of Yngling. He was the son of Yngvi, and he had reclaimed the throne of Sweden for his dynasty from Haki (the brother of Hagbard, the hero of the legend of Hagbard and Signy. Snorri cites two kennings from this legend, &quot;Sigar&#x27;s steed&quot; and &quot;Hagard&#x27;s fell noose&quot;, when telling of Jorund).

Snorri Sturluson relates that when Jorund was young he used to travel the seas and plunder with his brother Erik, and they were great warriors. One summer they plundered in Denmark where they met another pillager, King Gudlög of Hålogaland (a province in Norway) with whom they fought. They took him prisoner and carried him ashore at Stromones where they hanged him. Gudlaug&#x27;s surviving companions raised a mound over him there.

Snorri then cites the poem &quot;Háleygjatal&quot; by a Norwegian skald named Eyvindr skáldaspillir:

This act rendered the Swedish princes, Eric and Jorund, even more famous and they were thought of as even greater men. When they learnt that King Haki no longer had his forces around him, they decided to take care of their enemy. They assembled a large force that was joined by Swedes as they approached. They entered Mälaren (a bay at the time) and steered towards Uppsala. They left their ships at the Fyris Wolds and were met by Haki who had fewer men. Haki was a brutal fighter and managed to turn the tide of the battle. He slew Erik who held the banner and Jorund retreated with his men. Haki had been seriously wounded and died.

Jorund then ruled Sweden at Uppsala, but he usually spent the summers pillaging. One summer, he plundered in Jutland and entered Limfjorden, where he continued the pillaging. They anchored in Oddesund (before a storm in 1825, it was near the innermost part of the fjord and almost 200 km from its mouth) but were discovered by the Norwegian pirate Gylaug of Hålogaland, the son of Gudlaug. Gylaug and his men attacked them and were joined by local forces who wanted revenge. As Jorund was vastly outnumbered (and had to run an almost 200 km long gauntlet to get out of the fjord), he lost the battle, and Gylaug had him hanged.

Snorri illustrates this event with the stanza from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;:
The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation, continuing after Yngvi (called &quot;Ingialdr&quot;):
The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; also cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and it gives the same line of succession: &quot;xiiii Yngvi. xv Jörundr. xvi Aun inn gamli&quot;.

The &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and the &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot; tell that Jorund was defeated by the Danish king Fróði (corresponds to the Heaðobard Froda in &quot;Beowulf&quot;), who made him a tributary and took his daughter. The daughter gave birth to Halfdan, but another woman became Fróði&#x27;s legitimate wife and gave him an heir named Ingjaldr (corresponds to the Heaðobard Ingeld in &quot;Beowulf&quot;). Together with one of his earls, Swerting, Jorund conspired against Fróði and killed him during the blót.

<text>Sportovní klub Slavia Praha – fotbal (Sports Club Slavia Prague – Football, ), commonly known as Slavia Praha or Slavia Prague, is a Czech professional football club in Prague. Founded in 1892, they are the second most successful club in the Czech Republic since its independence in 1993.
They play in the Czech First League, the top division in the Czech Republic. They play the Prague derby with Sparta Prague, the most prominent rivalry in Czech football. Slavia has won 21 league titles, 11 Czech cups, and the Mitropa Cup in 1938. The club has won seven league titles since the foundation of the Czech league in 1993. They have also reached the semi-finals of the 1995–96 UEFA Cup and qualified for the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time in their history. In 2019, Slavia reached the quarter-finals of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League and also qualified for the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League group stage for the second time in their history. They once again reached the Europa League quarter-finals in 2020–21. In the title-winning 2020–21 Czech First League season the team completed an entire season undefeated and set a Czech record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 54 games between 2020 and 2021.

In addition to their men&#x27;s squad, Slavia Prague has reserve, youth, and women&#x27;s teams.

==History==
Slavia Prague was founded on 2 November 1892 by medicine students in Vinohrady, Prague, as a sport club aimed at increasing sport activity among students. The club initially focused on cycling, and expanded to football in 1896. On 25 March of that year, Slavia won their first match against AC Prague 5–0. The captain of this team was Karel Freja. Four days later, Slavia played against Sparta Prague, with the match finishing 0–0, this match being the start of the rivalry between these two clubs.
In 1905, Scottish manager and former Celtic player Johnny Madden brought new tactics and views on football from his home country to the club. He managed to set up an early golden age for the club that lasted 25 years. Under Madden Slavia won 134 domestic matches out of a total of 169, and 304 internationals out of 429 between the years 1905 and 1930. In 1930, Madden retired from Slavia and professional football at the age of 66, though he remained in Prague for the rest of his life.

In the 1934 World Cup, the Czechoslovak national team included eight Slavia players. The second golden period came when Slavia bought Josef Bican from Admira Vienna. Slavia with Bican won titles in 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1943, while many football players were at war. In 1951 Slavia finished in 11th position in the league. Poor results continued during the 1950s and 1960s when Slavia were relegated twice, in 1961 and 1963. They next played in the top level of football in 1965.

In 1996, Slavia won their 14th title after 49 years. During this season, Slavia played in the semi-final of the UEFA Cup and four players of this team had big importance for the silver medal-winning Czech team from UEFA Euro 1996.

Slavia participated in the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Champions League five times (1996, 2000, 2001, 2004 and 2005), being eliminated each time until finally qualifying for the group stage in the 2007–08 season following a 3–1 aggregate victory over Ajax in the third qualifying round. For the group stage, Slavia were drawn in Group H along with Arsenal, Steaua București and Sevilla. They started with a 2–1 win at home against Steaua and a 4–2 loss to Sevilla. Next came two matches against Arsenal; Slavia lost 7–0 at the Emirates Stadium, but eventually draw 0–0 in the second leg. In Bucharest came a 1–1 draw, which qualified the Czech team for the UEFA Cup round of 32, from third place in Group H, in spite of a home 0–3 defeat against Sevilla.

In October 2006, the construction of the new and long-awaited stadium at Eden for 21,000 spectators began. The stadium was opened on 7 May 2008 with an exhibition match against Oxford University.

In the 2007–08 and 2008–09, Slavia were back-to-back Czech champions, but did not play in the Champions League group stage due to elimination in the qualifying rounds by Fiorentina (0–2 on aggregate in 2008–09) and Sheriff Tiraspol (1–1 on away goals rule in 2009–10). In the 2009–10 Czech First League, the club managed only seventh place in the league.

In the autumn of 2010, the club found itself in crisis due to its economic problems. It was discovered that Slavia owed 112 million Czech koruna to the club&#x27;s former owner, ENIC Sports Ltd (English National Investment Company). As a result, major cost-cutting was needed to service this debt and it was confirmed that the squad needed to be purged. In addition to the players sold, midfielder Petr Trapp left the club mid-season, claiming that Slavia had not paid his wages for three months.

On 5 May 2011, the first leg of the cup semi-final against Olomouc was suspended after the first half at a score of 1–1 due to Slavia fans invaded the pitch in protest against the deteriorating financial situation of the club. As a result of this action, Sigma were awarded a 3–0 win.

In September 2015, CEFC China Energy Company bought the team. Since November 2018, the club owners have been the Sinobo Group and CITIC Group.

Since December 2023, the club is owned by the Czech businessman Pavel Tykač, who bought the club from Chinese owners for reported 2 billion Czech crowns.

Slavia&#x27;s greatest rivals are Sparta Prague, with whom they contest the Prague derby. A local Vršovice derby is also contested between Slavia and Bohemians 1905, whose stadium is situated a kilometre from Eden.

Slavia is widely misconceived as being a Jewish club among other fans, particularly Sparta fans, and its fans and players are often subjected to anti-semitic abuse. However, the club was not founded by Jews nor did it have any Jewish history. Football historian Vladimír Zapotocký commented in an interview that were this the case, the Nazis would have shut the club down during the wartime occupation, as they did with DFC Prag. The association stems from a friendly match played against West Ham United in 1922, when Slavia insured the match against adverse weather conditions, and the match was later cancelled due to rain. They then agreed with West Ham to play the fixture the next day, while also collecting money from the insurance company for cancelling the fixture. A week later in a Prague derby fixture, Slavia were greeted onto the pitch by chants of &quot;vy židi!&quot; (&quot;you Jews!&quot;) from the Sparta fans.

Since 2021, there is a fan coalition with Sportowe Zagłębie (Zagłębie Sosnowiec hooligans).

==Cooperations==
In May 2018 a strategic cooperation with Chinese club Beijing Sinobo Guoan for both professional and youth level football started.

== Ownership and finances ==

Under the Czech jurisdiction the club&#x27;s legal form is a joint-stock company (updated 1 August 2020) with the largest shareholder being the Chinese real estate Sinobo Group, which has on 11 November 2018 purchased a majority stake from CITIC, at the time holding 99.98% of the 212,074 stocks worth of CZK 1.514 billion (Annual report from 30 June 2018). CITIC remains to be a minority shareholder and the companies did not reveal the distribution of the shares.

According to their chairman Jinhui Zhou, the Sinobo business model is a combination of real estate development and sports activities. In a similar business model, Sinobo owns 64% of the shares in the Chinese club Beijing Guoan where the 36% minority belongs to CITIC. Sinobo also holds the naming rights of the arena, the Sinobo Stadium.

The Chinese investment activity in Slavia has firstly started in September 2005, when a private conglomerate CEFC acquired 59.97% shares of the club through its Czech subsidiary CEFC Group (Europe) Company a.s. from Aleš Řebíček for CZK 27 million. Through the course of the years, the share has increased to 67% and 80%, and on 22 November 2016 CEFC has capitalized its loan into the equity and increased their shares to 99.96% which made them the sole owner. In early 2018, it turned out that CEFC had serious financial problems and CITIC bought the club and arena. In late 2018, CITIC transferred Slavia&#x27;s majority stake to the Chinese company Sinobo Group.

Slavia&#x27;s financial results for the 2017–18 season show group revenue of CZK 837.4 million, with a profit before tax of CZK &lt;366.7&gt; million.

=== Management ===
The club&#x27;s current manager is Jindřich Trpišovský, who joined the club in December 2017 from Slovan Liberec. He replaced Jaroslav Šilhavý, who was appointed in September 2016 and moved on to manage the Czech national team. There have been 65 managers in Slavia&#x27;s history. The club&#x27;s first professional coach, Johnny Madden, was appointed in 1905, serving in that position until 1930. He remains the club&#x27;s longest-serving coach in terms of both length of tenure and number of games overseen.

<doc id="896039" wikidata="Q5640455" url="?curid=896039" title="Haki">
<text>Haki, Hake (Old Norse: ), Haco or Aki, the brother of Hagbard, was a famous Scandinavian sea-king, in Norse mythology. He is mentioned in the 12th century &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; and &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, and in 13th-century sources including &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot;, and the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;. If historical, he would have lived in the 5th century.

==&quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;==
Snorri Sturluson wrote in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; that Haki had amassed a great force of warriors and sometimes plundered together with his brother Hagbard (who himself was the hero of one of the most popular legends of ancient Scandinavia, see Hagbard and Signy). When Haki considered that he had amassed enough wealth and followers to make himself the king of Sweden, he proceeded with his army against the Swedish royal seat at Uppsala. Haki was a brutal warrior and he had twelve champions, among whom was the legendary warrior Starkad the Old.

The Swedish king Hugleik had also gathered a large army and was supported by the two champions Svipdag and Geigad.

On the Fyrisvellir (Fyris Wolds), south of Uppsala, there was a great battle in which the Swedish army was defeated. Haki and his men captured the Swedish champions Svipdag and Geigad and then they attacked the &#x27;shield-circle&#x27; around the Swedish king and slew him and his two sons.

Haki and his warriors subdued the Swedish provinces and Haki made himself the king of Sweden. Then he happily sat in peace for three years while his warriors travelled far and wide and amassed fortunes.

The previous king, Hugleik, had two cousins named Eric and Jorund, who had become famous by killing Gudlög, the king of Hålogaland. When they learnt that king Haki&#x27;s champions were gone plundering, they assembled a large force and steered towards Sweden. They were joined by many Swedes who wanted to reinstall the Yngling dynasty on the Swedish throne.

The two brothers entered Mälaren, went towards Uppsala, and landed on the Fyrisvellir. There they were met by king Haki, who had a considerably smaller force. Haki was, however, a brutal enemy who killed many men and lastly Eric, who held the banner of the two brothers. Jorund and his men fled to the ships, but Haki was mortally wounded.

Haki asked for a longship, which was loaded with his dead warriors and their weapons. He had the sails hoisted and set fire to a piece of tar-wood, which he asked to be covered with a pile of wood. Haki was all but dead when he was laid on top of the pile. The wind was blowing towards the water and the ship departed in full flame between the small islands out into the sea. This was much talked about and it gave him great fame.

==Other traditions==
Most legends surrounding Haki are probably lost.

===&quot;Völsunga saga&quot;===
In the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, Gudrun and Brynhild have a discussion on the &quot;greatest of men&quot; referring to a legend now lost, where Haki&#x27;s sons have not yet avenged their sisters by killing the evil Sigar (the feud with Sigar is still going on and Hagbard has not yet been hanged):
===&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;===
In &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (book 7), Haki (&quot;Hakon&quot;) killed Sigar, avenging his brother Hagbard&#x27;s death. In &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, Saxo Grammaticus gives Haki as a king of Denmark, and Hugleik, called &quot;Huglet(h)us&quot;, is an Irish king. The motivation behind the attack was to show that &quot;even the furthest kingdoms of the world might not be untouched by the Danish arms.&quot;

Saxo writes that Starkad and Haki brought their fleet to Ireland, where the rich and greedy king Hugleik lived. Hugleik was never generous to an honourable man, but spent all his riches on mimes and jugglers. In spite of his avarice, Hugleik had the great champions Geigad and Svipdag. When the battle began, the jugglers and mimes panicked and fled, and only Geigad and Svipdag remained to defend Hugleik, but they fought like an entire army. Geigad dealt Starkad a wound on the head which was so severe that Starkad would later sing songs about it. Starkad killed Hugleik and made the Irish flee. He then had the jugglers and mimes whipped and beaten, in order to humiliate them. Then the Danes brought Hugleik&#x27;s riches out to Dublin to be publicly looted, and there was so much of it that none cared for its strict division. When Haki learnt that his brother Hagbard had been killed by Sigar, he avenged his brother. However, killing Sigar was not enough to satiate his thirst for blood:

He was soon chased away by Sigar&#x27;s son Siwald.

===&quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;===
In the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, Haki (as Aki) killed the usurper Hiarwart within a day of his having taken the royal title from Rolf Kraki. Haki then became king of the Danes. In turn, he was then killed by Fritleff.

<doc id="896043" wikidata="Q1360926" url="?curid=896043" title="Run (cricket)">
<text>In cricket, a run is the unit of scoring. The team with the most runs wins in many versions of the game, and always draws at worst (see result), except for some results decided by the DLS method, which is used in rain-shortened limited-overs games when the two teams have had a different number of opportunities to score runs.

One run (known as a &quot;single&quot;) is scored when the two batters (the striker and the non-striker) start off positioned at opposite ends of the pitch (which has a length of 22 yards) and then they each arrive safely at the other end of the pitch (i.e. they cross each other without being run out).

There is no limit on the number of runs that may be scored off a single delivery, and depending on how long it takes the fielding team to recover the ball, the batters may run more than once. Each completed run, if it occurs after the striker hits the ball with the bat (or a gloved hand holding the bat), increments the scores of both the team and the striker.

A batter may also score 4 or 6 runs (without having to run) by striking the ball to the boundary.
* If the ball hits the ground before hitting or passing the boundary, then four runs are scored.
* If the ball passes or hits the boundary without first bouncing, then six runs are scored.
The team&#x27;s total score in the innings is the aggregate of all its batters&#x27; individual scores plus any extras (runs scored regardless of whether the bat or glove hit the ball). One extra is scored each time the bowler bowls an illegal delivery to the batter, and four extras are scored if the ball reaches the boundary without having been struck by the batter.

To complete a run, both batters must make their ground, with some part of their person or bat touching the ground behind the popping crease at the other end of the pitch. Attempting a run carries a risk factor because either batter can be run out, (one method of dismissal), with the run then not being scored, if the fielding side can break one of the wickets (at either end of the pitch) with the ball before the batter near that wicket has completed the run.

==Method==
Scoring runs is the subject of Law 18 in the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;. Boundaries are covered in Law 19. How the Batsman makes his ground is Law 30.

===Runs scored by running===

Batsmen frequently run singles and also &quot;twos&quot; and &quot;threes&quot;. If the batsmen run a single or a three, they have &quot;changed ends&quot;, so the striking batsman becomes the non-striker for the next delivery, and vice versa. If the single or three is scored off the last delivery of the over, the striker, having changed ends, retains the strike for the first delivery of the next over. There are rare instances of &quot;fours&quot; being all run when the ball does not reach the boundary. A &quot;five&quot; is possible, but usually arises from a mistake by the fielders, such as an overthrow. The batsman is never compelled to run and can deliberately play without attempting to score.

This is known as &quot;running between the wickets&quot;. During each run, each batter starts off behind one of the popping creases and then must go beyond the other popping crease, running a minimum distance of .

The striking batsman may begin his or her run from the moment the ball hits the bat; the non-striker may begin his or her run before the ball is struck, but runs the risk of being run out if they move out of their crease before the bowler delivers the ball. Leaving the crease early, to gain an advantage in running between the wickets, is known as &quot;backing up&quot;.

The batsmen stop running when they judge that the ball is sufficiently controlled by the fielding team to prevent another run, for example when it is returned to the bowler or the wicketkeeper.

If, when turning for an additional run, one of the batsmen fails to ground some part of their body or bat behind the popping crease, the umpire declares a &quot;short run&quot; and the run does not count but, even if the bat is dropped, runs do count as long as each batsman makes his ground with his bat or person somehow.

===Boundaries===
The act of running is unnecessary if the batsman hits the ball to the marked boundary of the field. If the ball reaches the boundary having made contact with the ground, four runs are added to the scores of both the batsman (if he had struck the ball) and the team. If the batsman succeeds in hitting the ball onto or over the boundary on the full (i.e. the ball does not contact the ground until it has hit or is beyond the boundary), six runs are added. If the batsmen are running when the ball reaches the boundary, they can stop, and their team will be awarded either the number of runs for the boundary (4 or 6), or runs the batsmen completed together (including a run in progress if they already crossed when the boundary is scored), whichever is greater.

It is also possible for a fielder to stop the ball from reaching the boundary, but for the ball to subsequently reach the boundary due to an overthrow by the fielder. In this case, four runs are scored (which are credited to the striker) in addition to any runs the batters had scored by running on that delivery.

===Extras===

In addition to runs scored by the batsmen, the team total is incremented by extras (also known as &quot;sundries&quot; in Australia; they are not added to a batsman&#x27;s individual score), which arise because: 
* The bowler has delivered a wide or no-ball
* The fielders have caused a no-ball (each of which incurs a one-run penalty)
* The fielders have failed to control a ball that did not make contact with the bat (byes and leg byes), thus allowing the batsmen to run. 
* Byes, leg-byes, and wides that elude the fielders and cross the boundary score four (never six) in addition to the one-run penalty scored for a no-ball or wide if applicable. 
* Five penalty runs are awarded by the umpires, either to the batting team or to the fielding team as applicable, for infringement of some of the Laws, usually relating to unfair play or player conduct. 
** For example five runs are awarded to the batting team if the ball hits a helmet on the ground belonging to the fielding team, as per Law 28.3.2. Five runs are awarded to the fielding team if the batting team causes avoidable damage to the pitch after due warning by the umpire, in accordance with Law 41.14.3. If the umpire considers a short run to have been a deliberate act, as per Law 18.5.2, they will disallow all runs to the batting side and award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. Law 41.3 states it is an offence for any player to take any action which changes the condition of the ball; wilful damage outside the scope of allowable actions shall result in replacement of the ball and a five-run penalty being incurred in favour of the non offending side. 

==History==
In the written records of cricket, &quot;run&quot; is as old as &quot;cricket&quot; itself. In the earliest known reference to the sport, dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date), Surrey coroner John Derrick made a legal deposition concerning a plot of land in Guildford that when ():

&quot;a scholler of the Ffree Schoole of Guildeford, hee and diverse of his fellowes did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies&quot;.

It may well be that, in this context, &quot;runne&quot; meant running in general. For a long time, until well into the 18th century, the scorers sat on the field and increments to the score were known as &quot;notches&quot; because they would notch the scores on a stick, with a deeper knick at 20. The same method was used by shepherds when counting sheep. In the earliest known laws of cricket, dated 1744, one of the rules states:

&quot;If in running a Notch, the Wicket is struck down by a Throw, before his Foot, Hand, or Bat is over the Popping-Crease, or a Stump hit by the Ball, though the Bail was down, it&#x27;s out&quot;.

In the 1774 version, the equivalent rule states:

&quot;Or if in running a notch, the wicket is struck down by a throw, or with the ball in hand, before his foot, hand, or bat is grounded over the popping-crease; but if the bail is off, a stump must be struck out of the ground by the ball&quot;.

These are the earliest known references to running as the means of scoring. The change of terminology from &quot;notch&quot; to &quot;run&quot; was gradual, and both terms were in use in 1800. The result of a match played in Sussex on 3 August 1800 was a win &quot;by 25 notches&quot; while another match in Sussex on 9 August 1800 was won &quot;by an innings and 38 runs&quot;.

<doc id="896046" wikidata="Q2825760" url="?curid=896046" title="Coffin affair">
<text>The Coffin affair was an event in Canadian history in which a man named Wilbert Coffin was hanged for the murder of three men. The affair started in June 1953 in Gaspésie when three men from Pennsylvania were reported missing. Their bodies were found a month later deep in the woods from the nearest town.

==Trial and execution==
The main suspect in the case was Wilbert Coffin, who was found to have many items belonging to the men in his possession. Coffin was sent to trial in July 1954 and though the evidence against him was mostly circumstantial, he was convicted with one count of murder (as the penal code prohibited multiple convictions of murder in the same trial). On August 5 he was sentenced to hang.

An appeal to the Quebec Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench was dismissed. Coffin&#x27;s application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was turned down but the federal Cabinet submitted a reference question to that Court asking: &quot;If the application made by Wilbert Coffin for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada had been granted on any of the grounds alleged on the said application, what disposition of the appeal would now be made by the court?&quot;

The federal government&#x27;s decision to take the question to the Supreme Court of Canada caused tension with the government of the province of Quebec. The Supreme Court answered that it would have upheld the conviction of Coffin: &quot;Reference re Regina v. Coffin&quot;, [1956] S.C.R. 191.

Coffin was hanged at Montreal&#x27;s Bordeaux Prison on February 10, 1956 at 12:01 AM.

But the story did not end with Coffin&#x27;s death. Jacques Hébert, a reporter during the trial and later a senator, published two books on the matter: (1958) and &quot;J&#x27;accuse les assassins de Coffin&quot; (1963). Hébert&#x27;s 1963 book caused such controversy that the provincial government established a Commission of Inquiry into the case. Headed by judge Roger Brossard with Jules Deschênes as Counsel to the Commission, over 200 witnesses were interviewed. The commission found that Coffin did receive a fair trial.

In 1979, filmmaker Jean-Claude Labrecque made a feature film on the matter entitled . It was released on September 10, 1980. Other documents inspired by the Coffin case include Dale Boyle&#x27;s song &quot;The Wilbert Coffin Story&quot; and the Alton Price book, &quot;To Build A Noose&quot;, which reflects Price&#x27;s intensive research on the case.

==Recent interest and debate==
In 2006, 50 years after Coffin&#x27;s hanging, four generations of his family commemorated his death at his graveside. That week, the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted announced it was studying the case. The director of client services for the association called Coffin&#x27;s case &quot;a blot on the criminal justice system.&quot;

The coroner at the time, Lionel Rioux, recently told the news media that he believes Coffin was innocent. Rioux accused Maurice Duplessis, premier of Quebec at the time, of making Coffin into a scapegoat for the killings of foreign tourists. Rioux held a coroner&#x27;s inquest at which Coffin testified. Rioux says that the provincial government destroyed the transcript of Coffin&#x27;s testimony. Coffin did not testify at his trial. Speaking in 2006, prominent Canadian criminal lawyer Edward Greenspan blamed Coffin&#x27;s trial lawyer, Raymond Maher who suffered from alcoholism and was drunk for the majority of the trial, for keeping Coffin out of the witness box: &quot;It was incompetence with a capital I,&quot; Greenspan said of Maher. &quot;It&#x27;s the worst case of lawyering I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Investigators also had a picture of Coffin with a noose drawn onto his neck on the wall. 

At the time Coffin was hanged, he had an 8-year-old son. The child&#x27;s mother wanted to marry Coffin before the execution, but Duplessis denied permission and said it would not be &quot;decent.&quot;

In a 384-page book titled &quot;&quot; (translation: &quot;The Coffin Affair: A Frame-Up?&quot;) published by Wilson &amp; Lafleur in Montreal, Clément Fortin, a retired attorney and law professor, proceeded to re-establish the facts. Given the evidence presented to the Percé jurors in 1954, Fortin concluded that they were justified to render a verdict of guilty as charged. In 1964, the Royal Commission of Enquiry on the Coffin Affair reached the same conclusion.

<text>Admiral flote () is the fifth and highest Admiral of the Croatian Navy. This officer is referred to as, and is considered the equivalent of, a five-star Fleet Admiral. The insignia for a Croatian Senior Admiral is two thick rank stripes on both the sleeve and shoulder board. Between 1995 and 2002, the rank was called Stožerni admiral (), analogous to &quot;Stožerni general&quot; for the ground forces.

In the Croatian Navy, an admiral can be promoted to the rank of fleet admiral only for distinguished service during wartime, and there is currently no officer with this rank. There was only one fleet admiral, Sveto Letica (1926–2001), a senior admiral who commanded the fledgling Croatian Navy in the Croatian War of Independence and later retired.

<doc id="896051" wikidata="Q3480168" url="?curid=896051" title="Hugleik">
<text>According to the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Hugleik or Ochilaik was a Swedish king of the House of Yngling. He was the son of Alf and Bera. 

Some commentators have identified Hugleik with the Geatish king Hygelac. However, although both kings were killed in battle, Chlochilaicus/Hygelac was reportedly killed near the coast of France/Frisia, while Hugleik was allegedly killed at Fyrisvellir in Sweden.

When Hugleik&#x27;s father and uncle had killed each other, Hugleik inherited the Swedish throne. Like his father, he was not a warrior, but preferred to stay at home. He was reputed to be as greedy as he was rich and, he preferred to be in the company of jesters, seidmen and völvas who entertained him.

Haki and Hagbard (the hero of the legend of Hagbard and Signy) were two famous sea-kings who had amassed a great force of warriors, and they occasionally plundered together. Haki arrived in Sweden with his troops to assault Uppsala. Haki was a murderous fighter and around himself he had his twelve hirdmen of whom one was the legendary old warrior Starkad (who had been in the service of Hugleik&#x27;s grandfather Erik and great-uncle Alrik).

Hugleik had also mustered a large army and he was aided by two famous warriors named Svipdag and Geigad.

The two armies met on the Fyrisvellir (Fyris Wolds) and a great battle ensued. The Swedish army was defeated, but the two champions Svipdag and Geigad pushed onwards even though Haki&#x27;s champions were six times as many. They were both captured by Haki, and then Haki attacked the &quot;shield-circle&quot; around Hugleik and killed him together with both his sons.

Saxo Grammaticus knows of this story but he renders &quot;Huglet(h)us&quot; as an Irish king who was killed by the Dane &quot;Haco&quot; (given as &quot;Hakon&quot; in the following translation ). The motivation behind describing Hugleik as an Irish king was probably identical to what Saxo described as the motivation behind the attack: &quot;even the farthest kingdoms of the world might not be untouched by the Danish arms.&quot;

Saxo writes that Starkad and Haki brought their fleet to Ireland where lived the rich and greedy king Hugleik. Hugleik was never generous to an honourable man, but spent all his riches on mimes and jugglers. In spite of his avarice, Hugleik had the great champions Geigad and Svipdag.

When the battle began, the jugglers and mimes panicked and fled, and only Geigad and Svipdag remained to defend Hugleik, but they fought like an entire army. Geigad dealt Starkad a wound on the head, which was so severe that Starkad would later sing songs about it.

Starkad killed Hugleik and made the Irish flee. He then had the jugglers and mimes whipped and beaten, in order to humiliate them. Then the Danes brought Hugleik&#x27;s riches out to Dublin to be publicly looted, and there was so much of it that none cared for its strict division.

<doc id="896053" wikidata="Q3568088" url="?curid=896053" title="Wilbert Coffin">
<text>Wilbert Coffin (23 October 1915 – 10 February 1956) was a Canadian prospector who was convicted of murder and executed in Canada. Montreal journalist, editor, author and politician Jacques Hebert raised doubt as to Coffin&#x27;s guilt in &quot;J&#x27;accuse les assassins de Coffin&quot;, published in 1963. The book led to a royal commission which upheld the conviction.

Eugene Lindsey, his 17-year-old son Richard, and 20-year-old Frederick Claar were last seen going into the woods to hunt in the Gaspé region of Quebec. Richard Lindsey had graduated from high school the day before the trip. A month later on 15 July 1953 the remains of Eugene were found torn apart by bears, and eight days later the bodies of Richard and Claar were found 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) away.

Coffin was found to be in possession of some belongings of the deceased and was accused of ambushing the men and stealing more than $600. He and others were known to salvage abandoned property in the area, and claimed to have acquired the property when he found the dead men&#x27;s abandoned vehicle.

After his conviction Coffin went through seven reprieves where he was denied clemency by the Quebec Court of Appeals, the Canadian Supreme Court and the Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent&#x27;s cabinet. He was hanged on 10 February 1956, having been denied his final wish to marry his partner Marion Petrie, mother of their 8-year-old son James.

==Posthumous==
Frederick Gilbert Thompson confessed to the crime in 1958, naming his friend Johnny Green as Richard&#x27;s killer. He recanted his confession and his story was dismissed as not credible.

Coffin was portrayed by August Schellenberg in the 1980 film &quot;The Coffin Affair&quot;, and by Wayne Robson in the &quot;Regina v. Coffin&quot; episode of the CBC Television anthology series &quot;Scales of Justice&quot;.

<text>Yngvi and Alf, according to legend, were two Swedish kings of the House of Yngling. Some versions indicate they were brothers or other close relations. They killed each other.

==History==
According to &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot; and &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Yngvi and Alf were the sons of Alrik.

Snorri Sturluson relates that Yngvi was an accomplished king: a great warrior who always won his battles, the master of all exercises, generous, happy and sociable. He was both loved and famous.

Alf was unsociable and harsh and stayed at home instead of pillaging in other countries. His mother was Dageid, the daughter of king Dag the Great from whom is descended the Dagling family. Alf was married to Bera who was happy and alert and a very lovable woman.

One day in the autumn, Yngvi returned to Uppsala from a very successful Viking expedition which had rendered him famous. He used to spend time at the drinking table until late in the night, like Bera, and they found it pleasant to talk to each other. Alf, however, preferred to go to bed early and he started to tell her to go to bed early as well so that she did not wake him. Then Bera used to answer that Yngvi was much better for a woman than Alf, an answer that was getting on Alf&#x27;s nerves.

One evening, the jealous Alf entered the hall and saw Yngvi and Bera converse on the high seat. Yngvi had a short sword in his lap and the other guests were too drunk to see that Alf had arrived. From under his cloak Alf drew a sword and pierced Yngvi. Yngvi, mortally wounded, got up, drew his own short sword and slew Alf. They were buried in two mounds on the Fyrisvellir (Fyris Wolds).

Alf was succeeded by his son Hugleik.

The poem in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;:
The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation:

&quot;Ingjaldr&quot; is held to be an error for &quot;Yngvi&quot;. Unlike &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; gives Agne as Yngvi&#x27;s predecessor. Instead Alrekr precedes Agne and Agne is succeeded by Yngvi. The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and it gives the same line of succession as &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;: &quot;xi Dagr. xii Alrekr. xiii Agni. xiiii Yngvi. xv Jörundr&quot;.

==Ari Frodi&#x27;s Younger Íslendingabók==
According to Ari Frodi&#x27;s line of Swedish kings Yngvi was the son of Agne, and not of Agne&#x27;s son Alrik.

==Gesta Danorum==
In Gesta Danorum, Alf (Alverus) was the father of Yngve (Ing) and Ingjald (Ingild). Ingjald, in his turn was the father of Sigurd Hring and the grandfather of Ragnar Lodbrok.

<doc id="896061" wikidata="Q267636" url="?curid=896061" title="Dawn Staley">
<text>Dawn Michelle Staley (born May 4, 1970) is an American basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for the South Carolina Gamecocks women&#x27;s basketball team. A point guard, she played college basketball for the Virginia Cavaliers and spent eight seasons in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), primarily with the Charlotte Sting. Staley also played on the United States women&#x27;s national basketball team, winning three gold medals at the Olympic Games from 1996 to 2004, and was the head coach of the team that won an Olympic gold medal in 2021. She is the first person to win the Naismith Award as both a player and a coach.

During her college career with Virginia from 1988 to 1992, Staley set the NCAA record for steals, the school record for points, and the ACC record for assists. She played professionally in the American Basketball League (ABL) during its three years of operation before being selected ninth overall by the Sting in the 1999 WNBA draft. As a member of the Sting and the Houston Comets, she received six consecutive WNBA All-Star selections from 2001 to her final season in 2006. Staley spent most of her WNBA career simultaneously serving as the head coach of the Temple Owls women&#x27;s basketball team from 2000 to 2008, leading them to six NCAA tournaments, three regular-season conference championships, and four conference tournament titles.

After becoming South Carolina&#x27;s head coach in 2008, Staley rebuilt the Gamecocks into one of the top women&#x27;s basketball programs. During her 16 seasons, she has led South Carolina to eight SEC regular season championships, eight SEC tournament championships, eight Sweet Sixteens, five Final Fours, and three NCAA women&#x27;s basketball national championships, including the school&#x27;s first in 2017 and a perfect season in 2024. Staley was inducted to the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012 and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013.

== Early life ==
Her parents, Clarence and Estelle Staley, moved to North Philadelphia from Orangeburg County, South Carolina in the 1950s, when they were still teenagers. They married young and in 1967 moved into a three-bedroom, single-bath row house in the Raymond Rosen Homes housing project. Together, Clarence, a part-time carpenter, and Estelle, a homemaker, raised five children—three boys, Lawrence, Anthony and Eric, and two girls, Tracey and Dawn. Fearful of her disciplinarian mother, who was of faith and would not spare the rod, Staley knew to &quot;abide by her rules, you lived clean. You&#x27;re good. You live a happy life&quot;.

==Playing career==

===High school years===
Staley was named the national high school player of the year during her final season at Murrell Dobbins Vocational High School in Philadelphia.

===College years===
Staley attended the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, Virginia, from which she earned her degree in Rhetoric and Communication Studies. During her four seasons in college, she led her team to four NCAA tournaments, three Final Fours and one national championship game. She was named the ACC female athlete of the year and the national player of the year in 1991 and 1992. Staley finished her college career with 2,135 points and held the NCAA record for career steals with 454 (which has since been broken by current record holder, Natalie White). She finished her career at Virginia as the school&#x27;s all-time scoring leader and as the ACC&#x27;s all-time leader in assists at 729, but those records have since been broken by former UVA stars Monica Wright and Sharnee Zoll. Her number 24 is retired at UVA.

===Overseas Pro Career===
In 1994–1995, after graduation, Staley played professional basketball in France in Tarbes, Italy, Brazil, and Spain before joining the ABL and then the WNBA.

===USA Basketball===
Staley was named to the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s Junior National Team (now called the U19 team). The team participated in the second Junior World Championship, held in Bilbao, Spain, in July 1989. Team USA lost their opening game to South Korea in overtime, then lost a two-point game to Australia. After defeating Bulgaria, Team USA lost another close game, this time to Czechoslovakia by three points. The team followed that loss with a victory against Zaire, but dropped its final game to Spain, again by three points. Staley averaged 10.8 points per game and recorded 14 steals over the course of the event, both second highest on the team. The Americans finished the tournament in seventh place.

Staley was named to the team representing the United States at the World University Games held during July 1991 in Sheffield, England. While the American team had won gold in 1983, they finished with the silver in 1985, in fifth place in 1987, and did not field a team in 1989. The team was coached by Tara VanDerveer of Stanford. After winning opening games easily, Team USA faced China in the medal round. The Americans shot only 36% from the field, but limited the Chinese to just 35%, and advanced to the gold medal game by a score of 79–76. There they faced Spain, who had won all seven of their previous tournament games. However, Team USA defeated them easily, 88–62, to claim the gold medal. Staley averaged 4.9 points per game for the tournament.

Staley competed with USA Basketball as a member of the 1992 Jones Cup Team that won the Gold in Taipei.

Staley played for Team USA throughout her career. In 1994 she competed in the World Championships and was named the USA Basketball Female Athlete of the Year. She led the 1996 team to an undefeated record of 60–0 and the gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. She was also a member of the 2000 Olympic team that defended the gold medal.

Staley was selected to represent the United States at the 1995 USA Women&#x27;s Pan American Games, but only four teams committed to participate, so the event was cancelled.

Staley was named to the United States national team in 1998. The national team traveled to Berlin, Germany, in July and August 1998 for the FIBA World Championships. Team USA won a close opening game against Japan, 95–89, then won their next six games easily. In the semifinal game against Brazil, Team USA was behind as much as ten points in the first half, but went on to win, 93–79. The gold medal game was a rematch against Russia. In the first game, the Americans dominated almost from the beginning, but in the rematch, Russia took the early lead and led much of the way. With under two minutes remaining, Team USA was down by two points, but rallied and then held on to win the gold medal by a score of 71–65. Staley hit two free throws with ten seconds left to extend a three-point lead to five, then hit another free throw with three seconds left in the game to seal the 71–65 victory. Staley averaged 7.0 points per game and made a record 52 assists.

In 2002, Staley was named to the national team which competed in the World Championships in Zhangjiagang, Changzhou and Nanjing, China. The team was coached by Van Chancellor. Staley scored 4.9 points per game, and recorded a team-high 24 assists. Team USA won all nine games, including a close title game against Russia, with the teams separated by only one point late in the game.

She won a third gold medal with Team USA at the 2004 Games in Athens. Her Olympic performance led to her being named 2004 USA Basketball Female Athlete Of The Year at the end of the year. Before the Games, she was selected to carry the flag of the United States during the parade of nations at the opening ceremony.

===ABL===
In 1996, she joined the Richmond Rage of the American Basketball League (ABL) and led the team to the ABL finals in 1997. The following season, the team moved to Staley&#x27;s hometown of Philadelphia. Staley was named the 1996–97 All-ABL first team and the All-ABL second team, the following season.

===WNBA===
In the 1999 WNBA draft, Staley was selected with the ninth overall pick by the Charlotte Sting. In 2001, she led the Sting to the championship game of the WNBA playoffs.

On August 1, 2005, Staley was traded to the Houston Comets. Staley announced before the start of the WNBA season that she would be retiring after the Comets&#x27; season was over. The Comets made the playoffs and faced the Sacramento Monarchs in the first round. The Monarchs swept the Comets and won the series 2–0, ending Staley&#x27;s career. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the top 15 players in the 15-year history of the WNBA.

==Coaching career==

===Temple Owls (2000–2008)===
Staley had no interest in coaching when she was initially approached by the athletic director of Temple University, Dave O&#x27;Brien. She was on the Olympic team at the time which was attending the Final Four in Philadelphia. O&#x27;Brien, mindful that Staley was a Philadelphia native and star basketball player at Philadelphia&#x27;s Dobbins Technical High School, talked her into visiting the campus, where she was guided to a conference room with a dozen people who were treating her visit as a job interview. When they asked her if she saw herself as a coach she replied &quot;no, not at all&quot;. She initially resisted offers to become the coach. O&#x27;Brien changed his tactics and challenged her to identify some ways to turn the program around. She was still playing in the WNBA at the time and her friends told her it would be impossible to continue to play and coach. That challenge convinced her she should give coaching a try, and accepted the position of head coach at Temple. In her first season, 2000–01, Temple advanced to the WNIT. In 2001, 2002 and 2004, her teams won the Atlantic 10 tournament to qualify for the NCAA tournament.

In the 2004–05 season, Staley&#x27;s Owls went 28–4, including a perfect 19–0 against Atlantic 10 opponents. However, they lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament to Rutgers University. Staley reached the 100-win plateau in the A-10 semifinals vs Xavier University that season, becoming the fastest coach in women&#x27;s basketball to achieve that feat.

On May 7, 2008, it was confirmed by Temple University that Staley would leave Temple for the recently vacated coaching position at the University of South Carolina. She left Temple with the best overall record of 172–80, along with six NCAA appearances and four Atlantic 10 titles.

===South Carolina Gamecocks (2008–present)===
At South Carolina she started rebuilding a program from scratch, suffering through two losing seasons at the start of her tenure. Starting with 10 wins during the 2008–09 season, she led the program to ever better finishes in each subsequent season, leading to the program&#x27;s first number 1 ranking and Final Four appearance during the 2014–15 season. They picked up where they left off a year later, going undefeated in SEC play; however, they were upended in the Sweet 16 by Syracuse.

In 2016–17, the Gamecocks repeated as SEC regular-season and tournament champions for the third year in a row, and advanced to the second Final Four in school history. They defeated conference rival Mississippi State in the national championship game to win the first national title in school history. Staley became the second African American to lead a women&#x27;s basketball team to a national championship; Carolyn Peck had coached Purdue to the 1999 national championship. After the 2017 win, &quot;The Post and Courier&quot; listed Staley first in their ranking of the 25 most powerful people in South Carolina sports.

Under Staley the program has captured five SEC regular season championships, seven SEC tournament titles, four Final Fours, three NCAA national championships, seven Sweet Sixteen appearances, five SEC player of the year awards and five SEC freshman of the year awards. Staley herself has been awarded SEC coach of the year five times.

In 2020, Staley led the Gamecocks to a 32–1 season, winning yet another SEC regular season, and tournament championship. The Gamecocks finished #1 in both major polls before the NCAA tournament was cancelled. Staley swept the national coach of the year awards in 2020; she is the first person to win the Naismith award as a player and also as a coach.

In 2021, Staley led her team to a third Final Four, before losing a controversial game to Stanford 66–65. Staley&#x27;s Gamecocks signed the #1 class for the then-upcoming 2021–22 season. On October 15, 2021, Staley signed a seven-year, $22.4 million contract extension with South Carolina, making her the highest-paid Black college basketball coach in the country.

In 2022 the Gamecocks were #1 in both polls for the entire season, they would go on to defeat 14 ranked teams, including Stanford, UConn, NC State, Oregon, Maryland, Duke, LSU, Tennessee and Georgia. In the NCAA tournament, the Gamecocks defeated Howard, Miami, North Carolina, Creighton, Louisville, and then UConn again to win a second national championship. Staley is the first coach to defeat Geno Auriemma, Tara VanDerveer and Kim Mulkey in the same season. Staley was again named Naismith Award winner, and coached the National Player of the Year Aliyah Boston.

In 2022, following an alleged racist incident by a Brigham Young University fan against a member of the Duke women&#x27;s volleyball team, Staley canceled the team&#x27;s matchups against BYU in the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons. Despite an investigation that did not find evidence to corroborate the claim, Staley declined to reinstate the series.

Staley won her 600th game on February 22, 2024, in 786 games (534 at South Carolina).

In 2024, Staley guided the team to a perfect 38–0 season, winning their third national title. Staley won her fourth Naismith Coach of the Year Award.

===USA Basketball===
Dawn Staley served as an assistant coach for the USA national team in 2006, a team in transition. Lisa Leslie, who had led the team in scoring in the 2004 Olympics, the 2002 World Championships, the 2000 Olympics, the 1998 World Championships, and the 1996 Olympics was no longer on the team. Sheryl Swoopes was available but hampered by injuries, with Staley transitioning from player to coach. Newcomers Sue Bird, Candace Parker and Diana Taurasi picked up the slack, but it was a team in transition. As an additional challenge, some members of the squad were unable to join the team for practices due to WNBA commitments. The team started out strong, winning each of the six preliminary games, including the game against Russia. In the quarterfinals, the USA team beat Spain 90–56. The semifinal was a rematch against Russia, but this time the Russian team prevailed, 75–68. The USA faced Brazil in the bronze medal game, and won easily 99–59.

During the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Staley served as an assistant coach under Team USA head coach Anne Donovan and helped the Americans win their fourth straight gold medal in women&#x27;s basketball and sixth in their past seven Olympic appearances.

After coaching Team USA to a gold medal at the 2007 Pan Am games, she served as head coach to the U17 Team in 2014 and the U19 Team in 2015, winning gold medals at the U18 Americas Championship and the U19 FIBA World Championship. The USA basketball organization awarded her the code national coach of the year award as a result of the U19 gold medal. She shared the award with Sean Miller who coached the U19 men&#x27;s team to a gold medal.

She served as an assistant coach under Team USA head coach Geno Auriemma for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and helped the Americans win their sixth straight gold medal in women&#x27;s basketball and eighth in their past nine Olympic appearances.

On March 10, 2017, she was named head coach of USA national women&#x27;s team.

At the 2020 Summer Olympics, Staley won her first gold medal as Team USA&#x27;s Head coach, winning all six games and extending her record to 45–0. Staley also coached Team USA to a gold medal in the 2018 World Cup in Spain and two gold medals in the 2019 and 2021 FIBA AmeriCups.

<text>Újpest Football Club () is a Hungarian professional football club based in Újpest, Budapest, that competes in Nemzeti Bajnokság I.

Formed in 1885, Újpest reached the first division of the Hungarian League in 1905 and has been relegated only once since then. The club has been a member of the first division for 108 consecutive years. Újpest have been Hungarian champions twenty times, in addition to winning the Magyar Kupa eleven times and the Szuperkupa three times. In international competitions, Újpest are two-times winners of the Mitropa Cup and winners of the 1930 Coupe des Nations.

Since 1922, their home ground has been the Szusza Ferenc Stadion in Újpest. Their biggest rivalry is with fellow Budapest-based club Ferencváros, with whom they contest a local derby.

Újpest is part of the Újpesti TE family. The club includes other sports sections that represent the club at ice hockey and waterpolo.

==History==
Újpest was founded in 1885. At that time, Újpest did not belong to Budapest. Újpest played their first Nemzeti Bajnokság I match in the 1905 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season. In the 1910–11 season, they were relegated. Újpest won their first Hungarian league title in the 1929–30 season.

At international level, Újpest&#x27;s most successful period was in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the 1968–69 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, they were beaten in the final by Newcastle United. In the 1973–74 European Cup, they reached the semi-finals and were eliminated by Bayern Munich.

==Crest and colours==

==Stadium==
Újpest&#x27;s home stadium is Szusza Ferenc Stadion, which has been their home since the opening on 17 September 1922. It was known as Megyeri úti stadium until it was named after the club&#x27;s legendary player, Ferenc Szusza in October 2003. After the renovations, which took place in 2000 and 2001, the ground can hold 13,501 spectators.

==Ownership==
On 3 December 2008, it was revealed by BBC Sport that the Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers were considering an alliance with Újpest. Jez Moxey, the Chief executive officer of the club said: &quot;We have had some initial discussions in Budapest with the officials of Ujpest. We touched on the issues of loaning players, academies and sharing of best practice on and off the field.&quot;

Újpest approached Roland Duchâtelet to become the owner of the club. Although Duchâtelet refused the club&#x27;s offer, he suggested his son to be the proprietor of Újpest. Roland Duchâtelet is the owner of the Carl Zeiss Jena and former owner of the Standard Liège, AD Alcorcón and Charlton Athletic

On 19 October 2011, Roderick Duchâtelet, former director of Germinal Beerschot, bought 95% of the shares of the City Budapest Zrt.

Roderick Duchâtelet said that he intends to bring back the glory of the 1970s.

On 27 October 2011, Csaba Bartha, managing director of Újpest, confirmed that the club received 150 million Hungarian forint from Roderick Duchâtelet.

In January 2022, Duchatelet was about to sell Újpest and found possible buyers. An agreement was also signed in January 2022 in which it was stated that the buyers should pay the remaining sum by the end of June. However, due the financial unpredictability caused by the Russo-Ukrainian War, the buyers could not transfer the remaining sum. Therefore, Újpest is still owned by the Belgian entrepreneur.

On 27 April 2023, it was announced on Nemzeti Sport that Interactive Brokers Group, owned by Thomas Peterffy, is interested in purchasing the club.

On 3 February 2024, it was revealed that Duchatelet would like to sell the club to Hungarian investors. On 6 February 2024, Roderick Duchâtelet sold the club to MOL.

On 21 March 2024, the club was officially purchased by the MOL Group. Balázs Benczédi was elected as the managing director of the club. The price of the acquisition was around 15 million euros.

==Supporters==

Supporters of Újpest are mainly from the fourth district of Budapest, the eponymous Újpest. Due to the success in the 1970s, the club gained supporters from all over Budapest and the country.

==Rivalries==

Újpest are in rivalry with several teams from Budapest including Ferencváros, MTK Budapest, Budapest Honvéd and several provincial clubs such as Debrecen and Diósgyőr. Since Újpest have been the third most successful club of the Hungarian Football history by winning 20 Hungarian League titles and nine Hungarian Cup titles, and the most successful Hungarian club in the European football competitions in the 1970s, every club in the Hungarian League wants to defeat them.

The rivalry with Ferencváros dates back to the 1930s when Újpest won their first Hungarian League title. Since then the fixture between the two teams attracts the most spectators in the domestic league. The matches between the two team often ends in violence which causes big trouble for the Hungarian football. The proposal of personal registration was refused by both clubs.

<doc id="896082" wikidata="Q2313495" url="?curid=896082" title="Alaric and Eric">
<text>Alaric and Eric (Old Norse: &quot;Alrekr&quot; and &quot;Eiríkr&quot;), according to legend, were two kings of Sweden. 

== In the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; ==
According to the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Alaric and Eric were sons and heirs of the previous king Agni. They shared the kingship. They were mighty both in war and sport, but were especially skillful horsemen and vied with one another about their horsemanship and their horses.

One day they rode off from their retinue and did not return. They were found dead with their heads battered but no weapons with them save the bridle bits of their horses. Accordingly it was believed that they had quarreled and come to blows and had slain each other with their bridle bits. They were succeeded by Alaric&#x27;s sons Yngvi and Alf.

However, in other sources, only Alaric died, and in the piece of Ynglingatal quoted by Snorri Sturluson it is only Alaric who dies explicitly. Eric&#x27;s death seems to be a misunderstanding on Snorri&#x27;s part due to an influence from the succeeding kings (see also the other sources below):
&quot;Ynglingatal&quot; then gives Yngvi and Alf as Alrek&#x27;s and Eirík&#x27;s successors.

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation:
&quot;Hogna&quot; is an error for Agne. Unlike &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; gives Dagr as Alrekr&#x27;s predecessor. Instead Alrekr precedes Agne and Agne is succeeded by Yngvi (incorrectly called &quot;Ingialdr&quot;). The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and it gives the same line of succession as &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;: &quot; xi Dagr. xii Alrekr. xiii Agni. xiiii Yngvi&quot;.

==In &quot;Gautreks saga&quot; and &quot;Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar&quot;==
&quot;Gautreks saga&quot; also makes Alrek and Eirík sons of Agni by Skjálf and co-kings and it was to them that the warrior Starkad fled after his slaying of King Vikar. Starkad served them first as a companions on their viking expeditions and then, after Alrek and Eirík had settled down, went on further Viking expeditions alone.
But King Alrek had a short life, for Eirík struck Alrek dead with a bridle when they were out to train their horses and then ruled as sole ruler over Sweden. This version says that Eirík reigned for a long time as told in &quot;Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar&quot; (&quot;Saga of Hrólf son of Gautrek&quot;).
This second saga introduces Thornbjörg, the daughter of King Eirík and Queen Ingigerd, who was a skillful shieldmaiden and ruled over part of the kingdom. Thornbjörg even called herself King Thorberg. But eventually she fell in love with Hrólf son of Gautrek and agreed to marry him, at which point she gave up her weapons to her father King Eirík and took up embroidery.

==In &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==
Saxo Grammaticus in Book 5 of his &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; introduces &quot;Ericus Desertus&quot;, that is Erik the Eloquent, son of a champion named &quot;Regnerus&quot; (Ragnar), both Norwegians in the service of King &quot;Gøtarus&quot; (Götar) of Norway, a monarch otherwise unknown. This Erik is likely to be the Eirík the Eloquent or Eiríkr the Wise in Speech mentioned by Snorri Sturluson in the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; as being of Ylfing lineage. But he otherwise has left no clear record in surviving Norse literature.
Saxo makes up for it by telling at great length of Erik&#x27;s amusing deeds. He relates how Erik outwitted all foes with clever tricks and became the counselor of Fróði son of Fridleif, king of Denmark. Erik&#x27;s expeditions on Fróði&#x27;s behalf always went well because of Erik&#x27;s cunning and way with words. Erik finally married Fróði&#x27;s sister Gunvara and Erik&#x27;s elder half-brother &quot;Rollerus&quot; (Roller) was made king of Norway.
Saxo then brings in a king of the Swedes named Alricus (Alrik) who corresponds to Alrek of the Norse tradition. Alrik was at war with Gestiblindus king of the Gautar (Geats) and Gestiblindus now sought Fróði&#x27;s aid. (In the Norse &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; &quot;Gestumblindi&quot; is the name assumed by the disguised Odin and it is possible that this Gestiblindus is also Odin in disguise.)
Erik and Skalk the Scanian pursued the war and slew Alrik&#x27;s son Gunthiovus (Old Norse &quot;Gunnþjófr&quot;) leader of the men of Vermland and Solongs. Then occurred a parley and secret interview between Alrik and Erik in which Alrik attempted to win Erik over to his cause. When this failed, Alrik asked that the war be settled by a single combat between himself and Gestiblindus. Erik refused the offer because of Gestiblind&#x27;s unfitness and advanced years but made a counter-offer to fight such a duel with Alrik himself if Alrik were willing. The fight occurred straightaway. Alrik was slain and Erik seemed to be fatally wounded so that a report actually came to King Fróði that Erik was dead. Indeed Erik was long in recovering. However Fróði was disabused when Erik himself returned announcing that Fróði was now also king of Sweden, Värmland, Helsingland, and Soleyar. Fróði then gave all those lands to Erik to rule directly and also gave Erik the two Laplands, Finland, and Estonia as dependencies paying annual tribute.
Saxo explains that this Erik was the first Swedish king to be called Erik but that after him it became a very common name among the Swedish kings. He also writes that Erik met and helped the champion Arngrim, an account that agrees with Hervarar saga, where Arngrim&#x27;s sons meet Erik&#x27;s successor Yngvi (see e.g. Angantyr and Hjalmar).
That the duel occurred at the end of a &quot;secret interview&quot; suggests that Alrik and Erik were alone when they fought just as were their counterparts in the Norse accounts. That Erik was believed to have died suggests knowledge of the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; version in which both fighters met their death. There is no mention of horse bridles. But Erik is not elsewhere a great duelist or champion but instead a trickster who wins through stratagems and deceiving words so that is it likely that Saxo or his source passed over a stratagem in which a horse bridle played a part.
Saxo also mentions Starkad&#x27;s stay in Sweden in Book 6 in a summary of Starkad&#x27;s life up to that point in his history. But Saxo does not indicate what king or kings then ruled Sweden, saying only:
... he went into the land of the Swedes, where he lived at leisure for seven years&#x27; space with the sons of Frø.
Frø is of course the god Frey, the ancestor of the Swedish dynasty.
At the beginning of Book 6, Saxo notes that Erik died of a disease and was succeeded by his son Haldanus (Halfdan). Halfdan was later slain by rivals for the throne but the warrior Starkad established Halfdans&#x27; heir Siward as the new king. Siward&#x27;s daughter Signe was married to King Harald of Denmark who was co-king his brother Fróði. Later Harald&#x27;s son Halfdan, now king of Denmark, slew Siward in war. But Siward&#x27;s grandson Erik, the son of Halfdan&#x27;s uncle Fróði by Signe, the direct heir to the throne, now rose up against Halfdan. After a long war this second Erik was captured by Haldfan and left in the woods in chains to be devoured by beasts. With him, it seems, the Swedish line of Erik the Eloquent, as set forth by Saxo, came to an end.
==Commentary==
It is not clear whether or not the accounts in the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; and the accounts in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;&#x27; tales of a Danish king named Halfdan who became king of Sweden are at all related.
Traditions of twin brothers connected with horses appear are a commonplace in Indo-European cultures as are foundation legends about two twin brothers, one of whom kills the other. It is possible that Alrek and Eirik are reflexes of such traditions.
Saxo&#x27;s identification of the legendary Eirík the Eloquent with the legendary Swedish king Eirík probably originated as a flourish by a pro-Danish or pro-Norwegian story teller.

<doc id="896091" wikidata="Q671071" url="?curid=896091" title="A13 motorway (Switzerland)">
<text>The A13 is a motorway, at times an Autostrasse (expressway), which runs from St. Margrethen in northeastern Switzerland through to Ascona in southern Switzerland, crossing the main chain of the Alps in the Grisons area. It is the southern half of European route E43.

== Construction ==
The A13 started life as a road which was mainly an expressway, from the foggy beginnings at St. Margrethen through to Haag, opposite Liechtenstein. The motorway began at Haag and went through Reichenau. Then it was an expressway again until after Mesocco. The final kilometres linking it from Roveredo to the A2 motorway were an expressway. Today, the section from St. Margrethen through Haag has been thoroughly converted to a motorway. Due to the tough terrain, the transformation of the Graubünden section into a full motorway would be difficult. 
The route is challenging south of Chur, capital of the Grisons. The year-round opening of the route only became possible in 1967, when the San-Bernardino tunnel was built, including the approaching branches of the A13. Therefore, it sometimes appears to be more of a widened mountain road, rather than a motorway or an expressway. For the whole of the ramps towards the culmination at the San-Bernardino tunnel, between Thusis and Soazza, there is no central structure to separate the two carriageway directions; each lane is about 50 percent larger than on a main highway, and overtaking (using part of the carriageway reserved for the other direction) is allowed where signposted.
The expressway finds its way through the Alps by means of the San Bernardino tunnel, which is in length. It also passes the Viamala gorge, where nocturnal shows tell the story of 2000 years of road construction through this obstacle (summer only).

== General information ==
The A13 continues the A1 on the shores of the Bodensee, links with the A3 motorway at the Sargans junction at its northern branch, as well as the A2 motorway at Bellinzona, south of the Alps. It connects also with main roads heading for Flims-Disentis along the Alps or Klosters, St. Moritz via Julier Pass, and Italy (via the Splügen Pass).


&quot;Main route&quot;: St. Margrethen - Buchs SG - Sargans - Landquart - Chur - Thusis - Splügen - Cassanawald tunnel - Hinterrhein - San Bernardino road tunnel - Pian San Giacomo - Roveredo - Bellinzona - Locarno - Ascona

&quot;Speed limit&quot;: on all motorway parts; or at times on expressway parts. Speed checks do appear and penalties can be severe.

&quot;Tolls&quot;: Covered by CHF 40 annual motorway toll sticker.

== Route details ==
The A13 starts in St. Margrethen, Canton of St. Gallen right after the A1. Afterwards, it crosses through the entire Rhine Valley, connects along the border with Austria and Liechtenstein, towards Sargans, where A3 joins the A13.

The highway then heads to Chur, the capital of Grisons, and turns southwards at Reichenau, where one can divert to drive along the Alps on the main road to Flims-Disentis-Andermatt-Brig (summer only), whereas A13 leads to Thusis (about up).

From Thusis the A13 climbs an altitude difference of some 1000 metres to the long San Bernardino Tunnel at around .

After the tunnel the road is marked by many galleries and strong avalanche-control curves back down into the Valle Mesolcina, using two long bridges to allow wide turns in this steep valley.
At Soazza, shortly after Mesocco, the street again becomes a highway. The A13 continues downhill and joins, shortly before the Ticino capital Bellinzona, merging with A2 at an altitude of .

Between Ascona and a roundabout south of Gaggiole in the Canton of Ticino, A13 is extended as the N13 highway; however, it is indicated by the crossed-out highway signs that Switzerland motorway sticker on this route is not necessary. Locarno is bypassed with the long Mappo–Morettina Tunnel. In this tunnel, there is one lane for each direction.

== Serious accidents ==
Originally, a largely non-divided section of the expressway from Sargans to the north has long been regarded as a particularly dangerous stretch: time and again, it experienced severe front-end collisions. In the period from 1979 to 2002, 96 people died on the A13, five times more than usual in Switzerland&#x27;s highways.

On 16 September 2006, a fire broke out in the &quot;Viamala Tunnel&quot;, after a head-on collision between a tour bus and a car, which killed nine people. Involved in the collision was a second passenger car. At least four other vehicles were affected.

== Relocation of heavy traffic on the rail transit ==
As a major transit route, shifting traffic from the A13 is a major concern. For the future, the introduction of an &quot;Alpentransitbörse&quot; is being discussed.

<doc id="896092" wikidata="Q627003" url="?curid=896092" title="Terroir">
<text>(; ; from &quot;terre&quot;, ) is a French term used to describe the environmental factors that affect a crop&#x27;s phenotype, including unique environment contexts, farming practices and a crop&#x27;s specific growth habitat. Collectively, these contextual characteristics are said to have a character; &quot;terroir&quot; also refers to this character.

Some artisanal crops and foods for which &quot;terroir&quot; may apply include wine, cheese, coffee, single malt whisky, onions, and tea.

&quot;Terroir&quot; is the basis of the French wine &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) system, which is a model for wine appellation and regulation in France and around the world. The AOC system presumes that the land from which the grapes are grown imparts a unique quality that is specific to that growing site (the plants&#x27; habitat). The extent of terroir&#x27;s significance is debated in the wine industry.

==Origins==
Over the centuries, French winemakers developed the concept of terroir by observing the differences in wines from different regions, vineyards, or even different sections of the same vineyard. The French began to crystallize the concept of terroir as a way of describing the unique aspects of a place that influence and shape the wine made from it. Long before the French, the wine-making regions of the ancient world had already developed a concept of different regions having the potential to produce very different and distinct wines, even from the same grapes. The Ancient Greeks would stamp amphorae with the seal of the region they came from, and different regions established reputations based on the quality of their wines. For centuries, literate and disciplined members of the Benedictine and Cistercian orders cultivated grapes in much of Burgundy. With vast landholdings, the monks could conduct large-scale observation of the influences that various parcels of land had on the wine it produced. Some legends have the monks establishing the boundaries of different &quot;terroirs&quot; – many of which still exist today as the Grand Cru vineyards of Burgundy.

==Elements==

While wine experts disagree about the exact definition, particular consideration is given to the natural elements that are beyond the control of humans.

Components often described as aspects of terroir include:
* Climate
* Soil type
* Geomorphology
* Other organisms growing in, on, and around the vine plots

The interaction of climate and terroir is generally broken down from the macroclimate of a larger area (For example, the Côte de Nuits region of Burgundy), down to the mesoclimate of a smaller subsection of that region (such as the village of Vosne-Romanée) and even to the individual microclimate of a particular vineyard or row of grapevines (like the Grand Cru vineyard of La Grande Rue). The element of soil relates both to the composition and the intrinsic nature of the vineyard soils, such as fertility, drainage and ability to retain heat. Geomorphology refers to natural landscape features like mountains, valleys and bodies of water, which affect how the climate interacts with the region, and includes the elements of aspect and elevation of the vineyard location. Other organisms growing in, on, and around the vine plots refers to the region specific fauna, flora, and microflora present in the vineyards. The microbial populations in vineyards have been described as being a quantifiable aspect of the overall &quot;terroir&quot;.

Mark A. Matthews, a professor of viticulture and plant physiology at University of California, Davis, has described the common conception of terroir as a myth. While Matthews agrees local characteristics can have an effect on plant growth and the wines made from particular grapes, he points out that the term is imprecisely defined, and also proposes the concept of terroir is accepted primarily based on traditional belief, and is not backed by rigorous data or research.

===Human controlled elements===
The definition of terroir can be expanded to include elements that are controlled or influenced by humans. This can include the decision of which grape variety to plant, though whether or not that grape variety will produce quality wine is an innate element of terroir that may be beyond human influence. Some grape varieties thrive better in certain areas than in others. The winemaking decision of using wild or ambient yeast in fermentation instead of cultured or laboratory produced yeast can be a reflection of terroir. The use of oak is a controversial element since some will advocate that its use is beneficial in bringing out the natural terroir characteristics while others will argue that its use can mask the influences of the terroir. Vineyard management (e.g., growing grapes organically or biodynamically over a more conventional method of farming) can also be seen as a human controlled aspect of terroir.

==Influences of viticulture and winemaking==
Many decisions during the growing and winemaking process can either lessen or increase the expression of terroir in the wine. These include decisions about pruning, irrigation and selecting time of harvest. At the winery, the use of oak, cultured or ambient yeast, length of maceration and time in contact with lees, temperature during fermentation, and processes like micro-oxygenation, chaptalization, clarification with fining agents, and reverse osmosis all have the potential to either reduce or emphasize some aspect derived from the terroir. Winemakers can work between the extremes of producing wine that is terroir-driven and focused on purely expressing the unique aspects of a region&#x27;s terroir, or winemaking that is done without any consideration given to terroir. Furthermore, aspects of terroir such as climate and soil type may be considered when deciding such things as which grape variety to plant if the goal is to make good wine rather than terroir-driven wine.

The importance of these influences depends on the culture of a particular wine region. In France, particularly Burgundy, there is the belief that the role of a winemaker is to bring out the expression of a wine&#x27;s terroir. The French word for &quot;winemaker,&quot; &quot;vigneron&quot;, is more aptly translated as &quot;wine-grower&quot; rather than &quot;winemaker&quot;. The belief that the terroir is the dominant influence in the wine is the basis behind French wine labels emphasizing the region, vineyard, or AOC more prominently than the varietal of grape, and often more prominently than the producer.

===Appellation systems===
The influence of terroir means that wines from a particular region are unique, incapable of being reproduced outside that area, even if the grape variety and winemaking techniques are painstakingly duplicated. Winemakers in Burgundy do not believe that they are producing Pinot noir that happens to be grown in Burgundy, but that they are producing unique Burgundian wines that happen to be made from Pinot noir. Appellation systems, such as the French AOC systems, have developed around the concepts of &quot;unique wines from a unique area&quot;. These systems have also developed into protected designation of origin across the European Union so that, for example, winemakers from outside a region like Tuscany can not produce a Sangiovese wine and call it a Chianti. While the wine may be made from the same clonal variety of Sangiovese, in the same soil composition as found in the Chianti region with winemakers using the Tuscan method of production, there is an assumption that the two wines will be different due to terroir.

The names of these European wine regions are protected so that wines from different regions and different terroir are not confused with wines from that those regions – i.e. a Spanish or Australian &quot;chianti&quot;. In the United States there is some confusion over the use of semi-generic names like Champagne and Port but there has been more effort by the American wine industry to recognize the unique association of place names with the wines produced in those places, such as the 2005 Napa Declaration on Place agreement. While appellation systems and the protected designations of origin can be a way of protecting &quot;unique terroir&quot;, the commercial importance of terroir has been a much debated topic in the wine industry. In Spain in 2018, networks of vintners joined in a grassroots movement to produce wines with added terroir value with intention to enhance the Spanish rural wine culture.

==Impact of climate change== 
As climate change disrupts long-established patterns of temperature and precipitation in wine-growing regions and causes more extreme weather events, there are potential serious impacts on terroir and the wine industry. Hotter temperatures and an earlier growing season can push berries towards a higher sugar content, less acids and differences in secondary compounds that are important for aromas. Growers are attempting to adapt in a variety of ways in response. In 2021, in a controversial move, the French National Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment formally authorized wine producers in the Bordeaux region to experiment on a trial basis with four red and two white vine types selected from other areas of France. The new types can make up no more than 10% of the final wine blend. The rest must be from the six red and eight white grape varieties traditionally cultivated in the region during its 2,000 year history. Another approach to protecting plants against the effects of climate change involves experimenting with rootstocks to develop plants that are resilient, vigorous and use water more efficiently under stressful conditions. Differences in planting, irrigation and harvesting practices are also being studied. Practices developed in warmer climates like Australia, Israel, South America, and Spain are being adapted for use in countries that used to be cooler, as temperatures rise.

==In other drinks==
The concept of terroir exists in other drinks, notably in tea (Wuyi rock-essence tea being a notable example) and Cognac where the chalky soil, climate and distance from the ocean are all factors influencing the product. Producers of single malt whisky, bourbon, rum, and vodka use terroir elements in their production process, including wood flavors derived from barrel aging.

==In artisan cheese==

The tenet of terroir has also been applied to the production of artisan cheese, and French authorities have fought to balance traditional cheesemakers terroir cheeses concerns with those of major industrialists.

The flavor of cheeses (and other dairy products) is impacted by the production location. For instance, Alpine pastures are composed of a larger variety of grasses, herbs, and flowers, than those in the lowlands. At higher elevations, the flora also changes significantly throughout the grazing period (from spring to autumn), thus also impacting the taste of cheeses produced in different batches. In Switzerland, Alp cheese is typically indicated with a special logo, in addition to the Appellation d&#x27;origine protégée (AOP).

==Commercial interests==
The importance of terroir affects the price of the agricultural product as well as the products made from the product. Branding, variety, and farmer identification affects the price of a product. The Slow Food movement appreciates history of a variety of plant or animal, the story of the farmer who produced it, and ultimately the quality of the product. Chefs and bakers develop their own list of qualities they desire for their creations, and terroir affects these.

Wine critics question the value of a Pinot noir wine from a Burgundy Grand Cru vineyard relative to a wine produced from the &quot;lesser terroir&quot; of a &quot;Premier Cru&quot; vineyard, and whether it merits the higher price. These doubts also arise when the quality of winemaking and other human influences are taken into account, which may be of a higher standard with the &quot;lesser&quot; &quot;premier cru&quot;.

These critics also question the difference between New World and Old World wine and whether modern winemaking techniques – like significant oak influences, over-ripened fruit, cultured yeast, micro-oxygenation, and color pigment additives – obscure or even eliminate the influence of terroir in making different regions unique. Critics often point to the homogenizing effect on mass-produced wines made from popular varietals like Chardonnay, which may have their terroir characteristics hidden by invasive and intensive winemaking. A heavily oaked, over-ripe Chardonnay from California can taste very similar to the same style of wine from elsewhere. The marketability of wines from different regions and producers is affected by the importance accorded to terroir, both by the wine industry and consumer wine markets, with some producers downplaying terroir and its effect on their wines.

== Ecological interest ==
Local products are the fruit of long agricultural traditions rooted in the local environment, using mainly local varieties adapted to the climate and environment, and requiring few external inputs. Their production also sustains landscapes with associated agricultural biodiversity, which in turn provides ecological services to agriculture. Last but not least, the specifications of the appellations forbid many products and techniques that are harmful to the environment, which means that the ecological virtues of ‘terroir’ farming are now a strong argument for its preservation, and even its expansion.

==Outside Europe==
In the United States, the principles of terroir have been applied in a few limited instances, such as Vidalia onions, whose production area has been defined by the United States Department of Agriculture and Indian River fruit, which can only carry that label if grown within an area defined by the United States Federal Trade Commission.

In some East Asian countries, terms like &quot;terroir&quot; or &quot;marriage&quot; have been popularised by Japanese manga. A 2008–09 Korean drama, most of whose leading characters work with wine, is titled &quot;Terroir&quot; after the main setting, a wine restaurant in turn named for the concept.

==In popular culture==
The concept of terroir has been discussed in several films and television shows. Jonathan Nossiter&#x27;s 2004 documentary, &quot;Mondovino&quot;, explores the globalization of the wine business, and features interviews with a number of small producers, mostly French, who talk about terroir. In the 2006 BBC series, &quot;Oz and James&#x27;s Big Wine Adventure&quot;, one episode is almost entirely devoted to Oz Clarke teaching James May about terroir. At the end of the episode, May identifies three wines successfully, placing them in the correct order on the basis of the quality of terroir they come from.

Les Blank and Gina Leibrecht&#x27;s 2007 documentary, &quot;All In This Tea&quot;, explores the importance of terroir and organic growing methods for the quality and future sustainability of the Chinese tea market. Terroir is also a frequent topic of discussion in the Japanese wine comic &quot;Les Gouttes de Dieu&quot;. The films &quot;French Kiss&quot; and &quot;A Good Year&quot; also make references to terroir. Terroir recognition is a plot turning point in the 1976 French comedy &quot;L&#x27;aile ou la cuisse&quot; (&quot;The Wing or the Thigh&quot;) with Louis de Funès. In 2014 Keith Carradine starred in John Charles Jopson&#x27;s Edgar Allan Poe-inspired film &quot;Terroir&quot;. Terroir is frequently referenced in Jeff VanderMeer&#x27;s 2014 novel &quot;Authority&quot;.

<text> () is an Arabic word meaning &quot;counsellor&quot; or &quot;advisor&quot;. It is related to the word shura, meaning consultation or &quot;taking counsel&quot;.

As an official title, it historically indicates a personal advisor to the ruler. In this use it is roughly comparable to the European titles of State Counsellor and Counsellor of State. 

In a military context, became associated with the idea of the ruler&#x27;s personal counsellor or advisor on military matters, and as such became the highest rank in Arab countries and the Ottoman Empire. It is used as the highest rank in most armed forces of the Middle East and North Africa, for armies, navies, and air forces. It is therefore equivalent to the ranks of Field Marshal and Admiral of the Fleet.

==Iraq==

In Iraq under the rule of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi Navy maintained a fleet admiral rank known as . A Mushir was the most senior of all naval officers and the rank was rarely bestowed. The sleeve insignia was the same as a British Admiral of the Fleet.

The rank of Mushir in Iraq is known as &quot;Muhib&quot; and is used in all official and unofficial addresses. Saddam Hussein as commander-in-chief of the Iraqi Armed Forces was an honorary &quot;staff muhib&quot; () in the Iraqi army, and the uniform which he typically wore was that of a staff muhib. He was the only muhib in the Iraqi Army, for the minister of defence and the chief of staff held the rank of (), or &quot;staff general&quot;. (Hussein never actually served in the Iraqi Army but commanded as ruler of Iraq.) After Hussein&#x27;s fall in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the rank of Mushir became obsolete in the new Iraqi military.

==Saudi Arabia==
In Saudi Arabia, the rank of Mushir is typically held ceremonially by the House of Saud, and translated as &quot;First class Field Marshal&quot;.

<text>Elmer Nelson Bischoff (July 9, 1916 – March 2, 1991), was an American visual artist, from the San Francisco Bay Area. Bischoff, along with Richard Diebenkorn and David Park, was part of the post-World War II generation of artists who started as abstract painters and found their way back to figurative art.

==Biography==
Elmer Bischoff, second child of John and Elna (&quot;née&quot; Nelson) Bischoff, and grew up in Berkeley, California. He was the second-generation Californian, a son of a father of German descent, and a mother of mixed Swedish-Ecuadorian origin.

He entered the University of California, Berkeley, in September 1934, completing his master&#x27;s degree in May 1939, and immediately started teaching art at Sacramento High School (1939–41). During his years at university, one teacher had influenced him most: the highly independent-minded Margaret Peterson (artist), whose total dedication to her teaching, and insistence on the ethical value of art, were to have a great impact on the artist Elmer Bischoff would be. World War II, however, was to change Bischoff&#x27;s life. In 1941, he served as a lieutenant colonel in intelligence services of the United States Army Air Forces in England, stationing near Oxford, and only coming back to the US in November 1945.

After the war, back in San Francisco, Bischoff found himself once more in the midst of avant-garde artistic ebullience - mixing, among other painters (and to name but two), with such artists as Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still. In January 1946, a golden opportunity was offered him: one of his artist friends, Karl Kasten (himself a war veteran, like Bischoff) suggested Bischoff as art teacher for a position still available, at San Francisco&#x27;s California School of Fine Arts. It was then that Bischoff entered a faculty which already included some of the most talented new artists of post-war America. It is there that he eventually met David Park and Richard Diebenkorn. In 1973, Bischoff was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1985.

While distinct from expressionist art that came from Europe, art of the Bay Area Figurative Movement displays the immediacy and warmth that one sees in abstract expressionist painting. Elmer Bischoff was older than Diebenkorn, and he had experiences in the world that led to his taking an independent turn in painting. Bischoff&#x27;s quiet and lyrical paintings were serious in a different way from the painting which was being taken seriously at the time; and which saw the rise of Abstract expressionism.

A retrospective of Elmer Bischoff&#x27;s work, &quot;Grand Lyricist: The Art of Elmer Bischoff&quot;, was offered by the Oakland Museum of California, November 3, 2001- January 13, 2002. The Crocker Art Museum (California), the de Young Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Washington D.C.), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art (Kansas City, Missouri), the Museum of the National Academy of Design (New York City), the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (Texas), the Oklahoma City Museum of Art, the Orange County Museum of Art, The Phillips Collection (Washington D.C.), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C.) are among the public collections holding works by Elmer Bischoff.

Bischoff was the father of composer John Bischoff.

<doc id="896108" wikidata="Q2436711" url="?curid=896108" title="Agne">
<text>Agne (English: &quot;Agni&quot;), &quot;Hogne&quot; or &quot;Agni Skjálfarbondi&quot; was a semi-legendary king of Sweden, of the House of Yngling.
Snorri Sturluson relates that he was the son of Dag the Wise, and he was mighty and famous. He was also skilled in many ways.

One summer, he went to Finland with his army where he pillaged. The Finns gathered a vast host under a chief named Frosti.

A great battle ensued which Agne won and many Finns were killed together with Frosti. Agne then subdued all of Finland with his army, and captured not only great booty but also Frosti&#x27;s daughter Skjalf and her kinsman Logi.

Agne returned to Sweden and they arrived at Stocksund (Stockholm) where they put up their tent on the side of the river where it is flat. Agne had a torc which is said to have belonged to his alleged great-great-great-grandfather Visbur. Agne married Skjalf.

Skjalf asked Agne to honour her dead father Frosti with a great feast, which he granted. He invited a great many guests, who gladly arrived to visit the now even more famous Swedish king. They had a drinking competition in which Agne became very drunk. Skjalf saw her opportunity and asked Agne to take care of Visbur&#x27;s torc, which was around his neck. Agne bound it fast around his neck before he went to sleep. The king&#x27;s tent was next to the woods and was under the branches of a tall tree for shade. When Agne was fast asleep, Skjalf took a rope which she attached to the torc. Then she had her men remove the tent, and she threw the rope over a bough. Then she told her men to pull the rope and they hanged Agne, avenging Skjalf&#x27;s father. Skjalf and her men ran to the ships and escaped to Finland.

Agne was buried at the place, now called Agnafit, which is east of the Tauren (the Old Norse name for Södertörn) and west of Stocksund.

&quot;Ynglingatal&quot; then gives Alrekr and Eiríkr as Agne&#x27;s successors.

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation:

Agne is incorrectly called &quot;Hogne&quot;. Unlike &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; does not give Dagr as Agne&#x27;s predecessor, but Alrekr. Instead Alrekr is Agne&#x27;s predecessor and Agne is succeeded by Yngvi (incorrectly called &quot;Ingialdr&quot;). The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and it gives the same line of succession as &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;: &quot;xii Alrekr. xiii Agni. xiiii Yngvi&quot;.

The location indicated by Snorri Sturluson as the place of Agne&#x27;s death has a barrow called &quot;Kung Agnes hög&quot; (King Agne&#x27;s barrow) in Lillhersby, Sollentuna. The barrow was excavated by Oxenstierna and dated to c. 400. Moreover, this barrow may be proof that there is somewhat of a historical core to King Agne&#x27;s story as told in the sagas.

<text>KSK Beveren (&quot;Royal Sporting Club of Beveren&quot;) is a Belgian football club from Beveren in East Flanders with founded number 2300 and with yellow and blue as colors. The club became national champion twice in its existence and won the Belgian Cup twice. The men&#x27;s branch of the club was temporarily discontinued in 2010, until 2022 only the women&#x27;s team played at the Royal Belgian Football Association under founding number 2300. In 2022, after an agreement with Waasland-Beveren, the founding number was released again for men&#x27;s football, so the club has been active since the 2022–23 season again with a men&#x27;s team. KSK Beveren is the first football club in Belgium that is completely controlled by supporters and is bound by the principles of Supporters Direct.

==History==

===1922–1949 Origins and early years===
Association football has a history in Beveren that goes back to the year 1922 when a local team called &#x27;Standaard Beveren&#x27; was founded under the influence of local businessman Paul Verhaert. The club became a member of the Belgian Football Association and received the &#x27;Matricule 737&#x27; (the federation&#x27;s registration number). Financial problems led to the dissolution of the club in May 1931.

A few years later, with football booming all over Europe, the foundations were laid for what would become KSK Beveren. On 23 July 1934 a local pub (&#x27;De Graanmaat&#x27;) owner received a request from a club of the nearby Municipality of Temse to form a team of players of the former &#x27;Standaard&#x27; team and play a game against them. The selection of Beverenplayers won by 1–2 and decided to form a new club: Sportkring Beveren (or SK Beveren) became an official member of the Belgian Football Association on 6 September 1935 and received the &#x27;Matricule 2300&#x27;.

SKB immediately became successful in the local leagues with two titles in a row. In 1938 the club moved to the Velodrome of local beer brewer and entrepreneur Frederik Thielemans, to whom the stadium was eventually named: the Freethiel Stadion. KSK Beveren remained at the site until 2010 and the stadium is up to the present day still used by Waasland-Beveren, while KSK Beveren uses a nearby training field as its home ground in the same sports park. Football in Belgium during World War II was organized in emergency leagues, so as a consequence SK Beveren freshly started the 1945–1946 season in the highest provincial league. In 1947 influential chairman Louis Verhaert came into power, leading his club to the national divisions for the first time in 1949, winning the league in an away game against Herzele.

===1949–1967 Rise to the highest division===
SK Beveren-Waes needed little time to adapt to life in the national divisions. It took the club only three years to eventually promote from the Belgian Fourth Division to the Belgian Third Division predominantly using local players and often counting on the heroics of their goalkeeper Walter De Winter. In the second game of the playoffs for promotion Beveren had already enough with a 2–1 win against Willebroek to secure their rise to a higher division.

Between 1952 and 1960 the club stayed in the Belgian Third Division, regularly battling against relegation and at the end losing the battle by only reaching 15th place in the 1959–1960 season. However, SK Beveren would come back stronger than ever before. During its three-year stay in the Belgian Fourth Division the club started to give chances to a group of local players who would become known as the golden generation of SK Beveren. Most of them learned playing the game on a local playing field, nicknamed &#x27;t Congoken due to its sandy pitch, similar to the local public image of playing fields in Africa at that time and referring to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a former colony of Belgium. The former site now serves as a parking lot, but is still remembered with two sculptures representing goals. Amongst the players were prolific striker Robert Rogiers, playmaker Omer Janssens, winger Jean Janssens, centre back Freddy Buyl and central midfielder Wilfried Van Moer.

In 1963, an unstoppable Beveren won the Belgian Fourth Division with 16 points (in the old two point system) in front of second-placed Brasschaat, without losing a single match and scoring 111 goals along the way. In 1964, the club reached the last 16 of the Belgian Cup for the first time, eventually losing as a third division club to first division club Cerle Brugge. After two third-place finishes, Beveren became champion in the Belgian Third Division in 1966. The title was won in an away game in Zwevegem, where Beveren obtained a 2–2 draw after a late goal from Robert Rogiers. The rise of the club, with especially the attacking type of play in mind, didn&#x27;t go unnoticed in the rest of Belgium, with references in the media to the club as the &quot;little Anderlecht&quot;. Under the new coach Guy Thys, Beveren directly promoted to the highest division in 1967, by winning the Belgian Second Division in the final game of the season at UR Namur with Mon Goossens scoring the deciding goal in a 2–3 win.

===1967–1977 Rise to power===
SK Beveren-Waes debuted in the Belgian First Division with a 1–1 draw on 3 September 1967 in an away game at Sint-Truidense, with Jean Janssens scoring the club&#x27;s first goal in the highest division. Their first win followed a week later, when the newly promoted team beat Daring Molenbeek with 2–0 at home. On 26 November 1967, the freshly renovated and extended Freethiel Stadion&#x27;s attendance record was broken when more than 18 000 people saw Beveren lose at home against Anderlecht with 1–2. Beveren ended its first season in the highest division on a 13th place. The 1968–1969 season brought a surprising sixth place with it, partly due to the goalscoring qualities of Robert Rogiers who ended as vice-topscorer with 16 goals. In the summer of 1969, the club enjoyed its first European exploits with participation in the Rappan Cup, ending in second place in group nine, consisting of B 1909, Odra Opole and Le-Chaux-de-Fonds. Led by new manager Ward Volkaert, and inspired by the excellent performances of Jean Janssens, who received his first international call-ups for the Belgium National Football Team, Beveren ended the season in fourth place, qualifying for the 1970–71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.

In the summer of 1970, the club again participated in the Rappan Cup, finishing as third in a group with Östers, Werder Bremen and LASK. The 1970–71 season proved to be average at the national level, but the club had a remarkable run in the 1970–71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. After beating Wiener Sport-Club in the round of 32, Beveren met Spanish giant Valencia in the next round, achieving a historic win in Spain thanks to a goal of Hugo De Raeymaeker. In the return game, Beveren held Valencia to a 1–1 draw (again a goal of De Raeymaeker), obtaining a spot in the next round. Beveren was eventually eliminated by powerhouse Arsenal, losing 4–0 at Highbury and drawing 0–0 at home.

Against all expectations, Beveren ended the 1971-72 Belgian First Division as 16th and last, relegating to the Second Division. The relegation was confirmed on 9 April 1972, in an away game at Crossing Schaerbeek, where legendary goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff made his debut. The club managed to keep their most important players and appointed Rik Matthijs as new manager. On 24 September 1972, won the first ever Waasland derby game against arch rivals Sporting Lokeren with 3–2. SK Beveren-Waes eventually won the title in the Belgian Second Division on 8 April 1973 against K. Boom. The club became a founding member of the Pro League in Februari 1974. Beveren had a good run in the 1973-74 Belgian Cup, reaching the quarter-finals for the first time, but losing to Tongeren. After two years in charge, Matthijs was replaced by Armand Jurion as manager in the summer of 1974. The club also signed two unknown prospects who would become one of the best Belgian full-backs of their generation, namely Marc Baecke and Eddy Jaspers. Jurion&#x27;s reign was momentary and after one season he was replaced by Urbain Braems, who would become one of the most influential coaches in the club&#x27;s history. The club ended the 1975-76 Belgian First Division in a meritorious sixth place, but failed to confirm the next with a disappointing 13th place.

===1977–1988 Golden Years===

With lowered ambitions, the club made a quite anonymous transfer that would however make a huge impact in the Golden Years, buying German midfielder Heinz Schönberger from Mechelen in the Belgian Second Division. Beveren reached the final of the first-ever Beker van Vlaanderen, a pre-season tournament for Flemish teams, eventually losing by penalties from Waregem. The club played an excellent first half of the season and stood in third place in December, eventually ending the 1977–78 Belgian First Division in fifth place. In January 1978, Louis Verhaert, after 31 years of service, transferred his chair of the club to Jan Van Ussel, who would become the most successful and respected chairman in the club&#x27;s history. On 21 May 1978, the club won its very first major trophy by winning the Belgian Cup. Beveren knocked out Witgoor Dessel, K. Boom, Tongeren and Sporting Lokeren, before winning the final against Charleroi with 2–0, due to two late goals of Johan Coninx and Bob Stevens.

The club changed its name, to SK Beveren, in 1978 (following the name change of the municipality of Beveren in the 1977 Fusion of the Belgian municipalities). The 1978-1979 season became the most successful in the club&#x27;s history. The departed coach Urbain Braems, who moved to archrival KSC Lokeren, was replaced by the duo Robert Goethals and Rik Pauwels, who respectively served as technical advisor and field trainer. The unknown German forward Erwin Albert was acquired for approximately 1.5 million Belgian francs from Hertha BSC and became the top scorer in the Belgian First Division that season with 28 goals. Goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff, now also the established goalkeeper of the Belgian national football team, won the Belgian Golden Shoe in January. SK Beveren, whose majority of the squad consists of amateur players with full-time day jobs (unlike the traditional top clubs of the country), clinched its very first national title on 12 May 1979, with two matchdays remaining, securing it with a 0–0 draw against Beringen. In the same season, Beveren also had a miraculous run in the 1978–79 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. After eliminating Ballymena United and HNK Rijeka in the early rounds, they faced the mighty Inter Milan in the quarter-finals. Following a 0–0 draw at San Siro, Beveren qualified on 21 March 1979, with a 1–0 victory at the Freethiel. The legendary goal in the 85th minute was scored by Bob Stevens, assisted by Wim Hofkens. In the semi-finals, Beveren faced the eventual champions, Barcelona. They suffered defeats both at the Camp Nou and at home with a score of 1–0. The goals in both matches were scored from penalties, respectively by Carles Rexach and Hans Krankl.

Beveren managed to retain its successful team, but failed to meet expectations in the 1979–1980 season. The club, a frequent participant in international summer tournaments, reached the final of the Trofeo Colombino only to lose to the host, Recreativo. On 22 August 1979 Beveren became the first winner of the Belgian Super Cup after a penalty shootout, defeating the home team Beerschot at the Olympisch Stadion (1–1 in regular time). The 1979-80 Belgian First Division was far from a success for Beveren, as the reigning champions finished in eleventh place. In the 1979-80 European Cup, Beveren was eliminated in the first round by Servette. However, the club did reach the Belgian Cup final for the second time, after defeating teams like KSC Lokeren, Club Brugge, and Standard Liège. Despite being the favorite, Beveren unexpectedly lost to Thor Waterschei in the final. Erwin Albert did equalize the 1–0 lead (scored by Pier Janssen) from a penalty kick, but seven minutes before the end, Jos Heyligen scored the decisive 2-1 goal from a free-kick. A very inconsistent season was brightened by an experienced club legend: in January, Jean Janssens won the Belgian Golden Shoe. At 35 years old, he was the oldest winner of the prestigious award for quite some time until he was surpassed by Lorenzo Staelens, who was only a few months older, in 2000.

Beveren strengthened themselves in the summer of 1980, among others, with Wilfried Van Moer. The 35-year-old midfielder returned to his former club and finished fourth in the 1980 Ballon d&#x27;Or voting on 30 December 1980. On 24 August 1980 Beveren lost the Belgian Super Cup to reigning champion Club Brugge at the Heysel Stadium after penalty kicks (1–1 in regular time). Losing Belgian Cup finalist Beveren played in the Super Cup because Thor Waterschei was not a member of the Pro League. During pre-season Beveren did however win its first Beker van Vlaanderen, beating Kortrijk in the final. Beveren finished the 1980-81 Belgian First Division season in fourth place, thus qualifying once again for European football. The season was largely overshadowed by an incident in the quarter-finals of the Belgian Cup against KSC Lokeren. After the match, assistant referee Rene Thirion accused goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff of giving him a knee blow in the dressing rooms. Although Pfaff has always denied this, the accusation resulted in a heavy suspension of six months for the goalkeeper. This punishment was remarkable due to its severity and because Pfaff was one of the most well-known and beloved players in Belgium at that time. Pfaff was also one of the key figures of the Belgian national team.

In 1984, the club&#x27;s name changed to K.S.K. Beveren.

===Early 2000s: the resurgence with the Ivorian players===

During the 2001–2002 season, Beveren finished in eighteenth place but were saved from relegation because Eendracht Aalst and RWDM were not licensed. Chairman Frans van Hoof then appointed Jean-Marc Guillou as technical director and gave him great freedom with regard to the club&#x27;s policy. Beveren, which was in financial and sporting trouble, was revived in the following seasons thanks to the arrival of many young Ivorian players from the ASEC Mimosas football academy of Guillou from Abidjan, (Ivory Coast). And a collaboration realized by Guillou with Arsenal, where his friend Arsène Wenger was a trainer, as a result of which players such as Graham Stack and Igors Stepanovs were rented out to KSK Beveren. However, it became clear from the start that the collaboration with Arsenal did not bring what was expected of it, for example, players of lesser quality were placed in Beveren in dribs and drabs. Fortunately, the young Ivorian players were of an exceptionally high level. Some of them ended up at the absolute European top after their passage at KSK Beveren, such as Emmanuel Eboué and Gervinho at Arsenal, Arthur Boka at VfB Stuttgart and Romaric at Sevilla to name the most important. Yaya Touré even managed to win the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League with Barcelona and became the second former Beveren player to win the highest European prize.

In the 2003/04 season, Beveren played the final of the Belgian Cup for the fifth time in its existence, the opponent was Club Brugge. The final took place in the King Baudouin Stadium. Beveren lost 4–2, but still got a ticket for the UEFA Cup because Club Brugge had finished second in the competition and was allowed to go to the preliminary rounds of the Champions League. Beveren managed to survive the first round of the Uefa Cup season 2004-2005 and to advance to the group round. Partly due to a lack of experience, Beveren could not win a single match and was eliminated. The 1-0 lost match against Heerenveen on 15 December 2005 is known as the last European match of Beveren.

In 2006, they were threatened with the loss of their professional licence and subsequent relegation to the third division, but eventually won an appeal to preserve their status. In 2007, however, the club ended last in the Jupiler League and was forced to go to the second division.

===2010: the temporary end of the first team===

In 2009, by bringing Johan Boskamp back to the club and having him sign for three seasons, they tried to draw up a three-year plan, in which a major role was reserved for Belgian youth players. However, Boskamp was fired on 27 December 2009 due to disappointing results, partly caused by his long absence due to a serious lung infection. At that time, the ambitious Beveren was in penultimate place in the Belgian Second Division. Boskamp was replaced ad interim by David Penneman. On 22 April 2010, it became known that Beveren would not apply for a license for the Second Division, the club voluntarily relegated to the Third Division. In the spring of 2010, under pressure from Beveren mayor Marc Van de Vijver, the first team and youth teams wanted to merge with RS Waasland. Because the application had not been submitted in time according to the regulations of the Belgian Football Association, they had to postpone the merger until after the 2010/11 season. However, instead Beveren decided not to give in to political pressure and to keep the honor to itself by no longer entering the competition with the men&#x27;s team the following season, but only with its youth teams. As a result, the merger fell through. To gain a foothold in Beveren, RS Waasland changed into KVRS Waasland - SK Beveren and this club played in the stadium of Beveren in the 2011/12 season. Partly because of this, the 75th anniversary of the first team of Beveren came to a temporary end.

The founding number was not deleted: Beveren had started a women&#x27;s team in 2009, so that the club with founding number 2300 could remain active in women&#x27;s football. In January 2011, supporters of KSK Beveren who could not agree with the disappearance of the original men&#x27;s team founded the non-profit association Eskabee 1935 to revive KSK Beveren as a full-fledged football club. The non-profit association Eskabee 1935 succeeded in its aim and joined the KBVB with the new football club Yellow Blue Beveren and founding number 9577. From 2011/12, that club started at the very lowest level, Fourth provincial.

===2022: a new start===
Due to the agreement between Waasland Beveren and KSK Beveren, a men&#x27;s team started again in the 2022–2023 season for the first time since 2010 under the founding number 2300 and this in 1st Provincial East Flanders. As part of the agreement, permission was also given to play at the Freethiel a number of times per season. The Stadium where KSK Beveren played all its home games from its foundation in 1935 until its temporary closure in 2010. On Saturday 17 September, KSK Beveren played an official match at the Freethiel against neighbor Svelta Melsele for the first time in 12 years. The match was attended by more than 1000 fans and Beveren won 1–0. In the same season, Beveren participated in the Fenix Trophy for the first time. A European competition between clubs that act according to the principle of Supporters Direct, i.e. fan owned clubs. The first European match since 2005 was played on Tuesday, 15 November 2022 on English soil against F.C. United of Manchester at Broadhurst Park and was nevertheless an equal match defeated with 4–1. A week later on Thursday, 24 November, the 2nd European game followed at home against the Spanish CD Cuenca-Mestallistes, which was won 4–1.

==Arsenal controversy==
Between 2001 and 2006, the club had a co-operation agreement with English Premier League club Arsenal. Several players were loaned between the teams and friendlies were played. The agreement expired on 1 July 2006.

Subsequent to an investigation by BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot;, FIFA requested the English Football Association investigate the relationship between the two clubs.

In 2001, Belgian police concluded that a loan of over €1.5 million had been made by Arsenal to the company Goal, which helped secure Beveren&#x27;s financial position. &quot;Newsnight&quot; have alleged this may breach club ownership rules under FIFA regulations. The accusation is refuted by Arsenal, who states that the payment was an interest-free loan and has no effect on the administration of the club. The FA and FIFA cleared both clubs of any wrongdoing.

Several players have been loaned between the two clubs or had trials. Only Emmanuel Eboué completed a permanent move between the clubs in this time period, from Beveren to Arsenal.

<text>Wonsu is the highest military rank in the armed forces of North Korea and South Korea.

== Historical ==
The title of &quot;Wonsu&quot; or its variations had been used as the title of high-ranking military commanders in Korean history since Goryeo Dynasty onward. For example, Gwon Yul, a famous general in 16th century who rose to the supreme command of Korean forces during Imjin War held the title of &quot;Do-Wonsu&quot;, roughly translated as &quot;high marshal&quot;.

== North Korea ==
&quot;Wonsu&quot; is a rank in the Korean People&#x27;s Army of North Korea, equivalent to marshal in other armies. This rank is held by all Supreme Leaders of the DPRK.

While he was the Supreme Commander of the Korean People&#x27;s Army, Kim Il Sung became North Korea&#x27;s first marshal during the Korean War by the decision of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly, the unicameral parliament of North Korea, on February 4, 1953. Period photographic evidence demonstrates that the early marshal shoulder board rank insignia was the same as that of the current vice marshal shoulder boards (a large star overlain with the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea coat-of-arms).

The rank of vice marshal (&quot;chasu&quot;) is unique to the North Korean ranking system. Vice marshal was first conferred in February 1953 on Choe Yong-gon. Sources suggest that the shoulder board rank insignia for marshal and vice marshal then became a single large star without the state coat-of-arms (for marshals) and the state coat-of-arms without a star (for vice marshals). By the time the next conferral of rank to vice marshal was awarded (1985), the shoulder board rank insignia for marshal and vice marshal had taken on their current design.

The next change in the DPRK marshal ranks took place in 1992 when the rank of &quot;dae wonsu&quot; or grand marshal (full title grand marshal of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea) was created for Kim Il Sung. At this time the rank of marshal was divided into two ranks: the rank of marshal with the title &quot;marshal of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea&quot; (&quot;konghwaguk wonsu&quot;) was conferred upon Kim Il Sung&#x27;s son Kim Jong Il, and the same rank but with the title &quot;marshal of the Korean People&#x27;s Army&quot; was conferred upon O Jin-u. In 1995, two other military officers were conferred the rank of marshal with the title &quot;marshals of the Korean People&#x27;s Army&quot;, i.e. Choe Kwang and Ri Ul-sol. Insignia of rank of the two grades of marshal are different (with the insignia for marshal of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea being more like that of grand marshal—the grand marshal insignia has a larger wreath encompassing the marshal&#x27;s star—but is smaller as it is below the star itself).

Also, in 1992 eight other generals were promoted to vice marshal at which time in North Korea there was one grand marshal, one marshal of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, one marshal of the Korean People&#x27;s Army and eight vice marshals.

The rank (as marshal of the DPRK) was bestowed to Kim Jong Un in 2012.

On April 15, 2016, Kim Yong-chun and Hyon Chol-hae were promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Korean People&#x27;s Army, the first promotions of active duty officers after 21 years.

 (), known in English as &quot;General of the Army of the Republic of Korea&quot; or &quot;Admiral of the Fleet of the Republic of Korea&quot;, is the highest military rank of the Republic of Korea (ROK) armed forces and is the combined equivalent of a field marshal, fleet admiral and marshal of the Air Force in other nations. The rank is senior to that of . As of , only exists on paper, and has never been held by an officer of the South Korean Armed Forces. According to the Armed Forces Personnel Act of National Defense Law of the Republic of Korea, the is appointed from the who has distinguished achievements.

The rank insignia for is heavily influenced by United States military insignia of General of the Army and General of the Air Force for Army and Air Force. While the rank insignia for the Navy remains the same the sleeve insignia for a naval officer promoted to the rank is the same sleeve insignia of Fleet admiral used in the United States Navy.

==Homophone==
Coincidentally, &quot;wonsu&quot; is also a word meaning &quot;mortal enemy&quot; (怨讐). The two words have different etymologies and hanja, but in South Korea are homophonous and so are written identically in hangul. In North Korea, the government has addressed the issue by changing the word for &quot;enemy&quot; to &quot;wonssu&quot; (원쑤).

<text>Scott Ryan Williamson (born February 17, 1976) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) right-handed relief pitcher who played for the Cincinnati Reds (1999–2003), Boston Red Sox (2003–), Chicago Cubs (2005–2006), San Diego Padres (2006), and Baltimore Orioles (2007).

== Amateur career ==
Williamson attended Friendswood High School in Friendswood, Texas. In his senior year he posted a 0.68 ERA and was named district MVP. In college, Williamson played for first Tulane University and then Oklahoma State University. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham A&#x27;s of the Cape Cod Baseball League. With Oklahoma State, he earned Big 12 first-team honors during the 1996-1997 school year. Williamson entered the draft after the season was over and was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the 9th round, 276th pick overall.

==Professional career==
=== Cincinnati Reds ===
Cincinnati assigned Williamson their rookie affiliate, the Billings Mustangs of the Pioneer League. Starting for Billings, Williamson went 8–2 with a 1.78 ERA, the best in the league that year. For 1998, Cincinnati promoted Williamson to the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern League, bypassing Single-A altogether. In his first start for the Lookouts, Williamson faced Atlanta Braves veteran John Smoltz, down with the Greenville Braves on a rehabilitation assignment. Williamson held his own, giving up two runs in six innings in a 6–5 loss. Mark Berry, Lookouts manager, praised Williamson&#x27;s performance: &quot;I was highly impressed...I expected him to be more erratic because of Smoltz, the big crowd and the whole situation. It&#x27;s something he can build on.&quot; Williamson would start just eighteen games for the Lookouts that year after battling injuries, but at the end of the season Cincinnati promoted him to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. Cincinnati planned to call Williamson up in September, but he &quot;stretched a tendon in the middle finger of his pitching hand&quot; during a game for Indianapolis that ended his season.

Cincinnati invited Williamson to spring training in 1999, where the combination of an impressive performance and injuries to key members of the pitching staff, including Denny Neagle and Stan Belinda, led to Williamson making the major league club despite having made just five appearances at the Triple-A level and never being on the 40-man roster. Williamson made his major league debut in relief on April 5, 1999. In his rookie season with Cincinnati, Williamson went 12–7 with 107 strikeouts, a 2.41 earned run average and 19 saves; he made the All-Star team, and earned Rookie of the Year honors. Williamson was the first Reds player to be so honored since Chris Sabo in 1988.

During the 1999-2000 off-season, Williamson&#x27;s name came up several times in trade talks with the Seattle Mariners, who were looking to deal Ken Griffey Jr., but in the end Williamson remained with Cincinnati. Williamson returned for the 2000 season but was bedeviled by injuries, including two broken toes in mid-September. He made fewer appearances than in 1999 but pitched more innings, due in part to joining the starting rotation after the All-Star break.

After a lackluster spring training, Cincinnati returned Williamson to the bullpen, who would make just two appearances before going on the disabled list with a torn ligament in his shoulder. After consultation with orthopedic surgeon James Andrews, Williamson underwent Tommy John surgery, ending his season. Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden called it &quot;Devastating, just devastating.&quot; Williamson returned to the bullpen for the 2002 season and went 3–4 with a 2.92 ERA. For 2003, Williamson took over as closer and saved 21 games in 43 appearances. On July 31, 2003, Cincinnati traded Williamson to the Boston Red Sox for Phil Dumatrait, Tyler Pelland and cash. The move was part of a fire sale instigated by Cincinnati management after Bowden and manager Bob Boone were fired.

=== Boston Red Sox ===
The New York Yankees had also been interested in Williamson; that Boston acquired him from Cincinnati was widely touted as a coup for Boston general manager Theo Epstein. &quot;USA Today&quot; sportswriter Hal Bodley placed the Williamson trade in the context of Red Sox-Yankees rivalry:
The Sauerbeck-Williamson deals give the Red Sox and Epstein a measure of revenge. They were stung last winter when the Yankees outbid them in a bitter battle for Cuban pitcher Jose Contreras.
The mid-season arrival of Williamson, along with Scott Sauerbeck, Jeff Suppan and Byung Hyun Kim was expected to boost an already strong Boston team to the 2003 World Series.

Williamson&#x27;s tenure with Boston was a troubled one: his ERA with the team was 6.20 and he pitched just 20 innings in 24 appearances. In mid-September he underwent an MRI but the result was negative. As Boston entered the playoffs he shared closer duties with Mike Timlin. In the American League Championship series against New York, Williamson earned saves in Games 1, 4 and 6. Nevertheless, manager Grady Little left a tiring Pedro Martínez in the 8th inning of Game 7 with Boston up 5–2. Martinez gave up three runs and New York would eventually win in the 11th inning 6-5. Critics maintain that Little should have pulled Martinez in favor of Williamson or Timlin, but that their mixed record during the regular season led Little to stay with the veteran Martinez.

Williamson returned to Boston in 2004 as a middle reliever and got off to a strong start (1.69 ERA in 14 appearances) before elbow tendinitis placed him on the disabled list again in late May. Williamson returned in mid-June, but never felt completely healthy and went back on the DL at the beginning of July with a nerve impingement in his right forearm. The return to the DL was not without controversy: Williamson, feeling pain in a game against the Yankees (which the Red Sox would go on to lose), took himself out of the game. What happened next is a matter of dispute. Contemporary media accounts claim that Boston veteran starting pitcher Curt Schilling confronted Williamson and &quot;questioned [Williamson&#x27;s] manhood.&quot; Schilling would later downplay the incident, acknowledging that he and Williamson &quot;had words&quot; but that Schilling never doubted that Williamson was injured. Williamson indicated that he and Schilling never patched things up and said that &quot;Unfortunately, it happened. He&#x27;s got his opinion, but it wasn&#x27;t right.&quot;

In August Boston placed Williamson on the 60-day disabled list as word spread that he might undergo a second Tommy John surgery, which would end the 2004 season and likely preclude any activity in 2005 as well. Defying predictions, Williamson returned in September and finished the season with a 1.26 ERA in 28 appearances. However, he was left off the post-season roster and underwent surgery as Boston won the 2004 World Series. Williamson filed for free agency at the end of the season, and departed the organization after Boston declined to offer arbitration.

=== Chicago Cubs ===
At the start of 2005 the Chicago Cubs signed Williamson to a minor league contract and added him to their 40-man roster, but he almost immediately went on the 60-day disabled list: in the end Williamson had undergone the second Tommy John surgery and was not yet recovered. Williamson returned to the team in August but struggled with his velocity. Sportswriters wondered at the wisdom of coming back in less than 12 months without the benefit of spring training. Williamson himself said that he was &quot;trying to find my rhythm and it&#x27;s hard to do that at the big-league level.&quot; Williamson eventually appeared in 17 games; his ERA, 8.68 in the beginning of September, dropped to 5.65 by the end of the season. Showing its confidence in Williamson, Chicago exercised its option to bring him back for another season.

Williamson made the 2006 team as a middle reliever, losing the closer&#x27;s job to Ryan Dempster. Williamson had expressed a willingness to be traded if it meant taking over the closer&#x27;s job for the new team. In early June, after making 23 appearances with an ERA over 4, Williamson went back on the disabled list with tendinitis. Williamson returned at the end of June and pitched in eight more games, but on July 22 Chicago traded him to the San Diego Padres for minor League pitchers Fabian Angulo and Joel Santo.

=== San Diego Padres ===
Williamson joined a San Diego team in first place in the National League West division, a prospect which cheered him: &quot;Going from second-to-last to first place, that&#x27;s always exciting.&quot; In an interview with the &quot;Galveston County Daily News&quot;, Williamson also expressed disappointment at the way Chicago manager Dusty Baker had used him and revealed that he had considered retiring altogether. Now with San Diego, Williamson said that he was &quot;having a lot of fun here, and I&#x27;m back to being myself, laughing and joking.&quot; Just days after that interview was published, Williamson made his last appearance for San Diego: an MRI revealed a bone chip in his elbow. Williamson returned to the DL and sat out the rest of the season. San Diego released Williamson on October 12.

=== Baltimore Orioles ===
In late November 2006 the Baltimore Orioles signed Williamson to a one-year contract. After six appearances and an ERA of 1.60, Williamson went on the disabled list with tightness in his right triceps tendon. Williamson returned in June and appeared in ten more games, but lingering questions about his health and a desire on the part of Baltimore&#x27;s management to promote younger players led to him being designated for assignment on July 4. In sixteen games Williamson was 1–0 with a 4.40 ERA. Williamson cleared waivers and was released.

=== Around the minors ===
The New York Yankees signed Williamson to a minor league contract on July 22. He was released on August 5 after going 0–1 with a 9.82 ERA in 4 games with the Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre Yankees. In early February 2008, Williamson signed a one-year minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. He would have made $700,000 if he had made the Giants major league roster. After posting a 13.50 ERA with the Giants in spring training, Williamson was released on March 5, 2008. Williamson was signed to a minor league contract by the Atlanta Braves in April. They released him in early June.

On June 15, 2008, the Seattle Mariners signed him to a minor league contract. After joining the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers and his third organization that year, Williamson remarked that &quot;This year has been kind of a crazy year for me...It&#x27;s kind of frustrating, but it feels good to go out and compete.&quot; but he was released in late June after just three appearances.

On January 24, 2009, Williamson signed a minor league deal with the Detroit Tigers, who were looking for middle relievers after a disappointing 2008 season. In the end Williamson lost out to newcomer Ryan Perry and was sent down to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. Detroit manager Jim Leyland praised Williamson&#x27;s experience: &quot;I think Scott Williamson has an excellent chance...You&#x27;re talking about a pretty big-time Major League pitcher at one time.&quot; Once in Toledo, however, Williamson had difficulties making a consistent outing and his ERA climbed steadily. On April 26, 2009, Toledo released Williamson to make room for Eddie Bonine, ending Williamson&#x27;s comeback attempt within the Detroit Tigers organization.

On August 2, 2010, Scott Williamson agreed to pitch for the Somerset Patriots.

<text>Military districts (also called military regions) are formations of a state&#x27;s armed forces (often of the Army) which are responsible for a certain area of territory. They are often more responsible for administrative than operational matters, and in countries with conscript forces, often handle parts of the conscription cycle.

Navies have also used a similar model, with organizations such as the United States Naval Districts. A number of navies in South America used naval districts at various points in time.

==By country==

===Algeria===
Algeria is divided into six numbered military regions, each with headquarters located in a principal city or town (see People&#x27;s National Army (Algeria)#Military regions). Before the Algerian revolution, French Algeria was the 10th Military Region of France.

This system of territorial organization, adopted shortly after independence, grew out of the wartime wilaya structure and the postwar necessity of subduing antigovernment insurgencies that were based in the various regions. Regional commanders control and administer bases, logistics, and housing, as well as conscript training. However, commanders of army divisions and brigades, air force installations, and naval forces report directly to the Ministry of National Defence and service chiefs of staff on operational matters. 

Military region commanders in 2003 included Brahim Fodel Chérif (1st Military Region), Kamel Abderrahmane (2nd Military Region, Abcène Tafer (3rd Military Region), Abdelmadjid Sahed (4th Military Region, Chérif Abderrazak (5th Military Region) and Ali Benali (6th Military Region).

=== Australia ===
Between 1911 and 1997, the Australian Army had an official system of between six and eight military districts, based on the boundaries of Australian states and territories. 

From 1911:
* 1st Military District (1MD) – Queensland and the 12th Battalion area, including Casino, Lismore, Grafton, the Northern Territory. (The Territory of Papua and Territory of New Guinea were added to 1MD after World War I.)
* 2nd Military District (2MD) – New South Wales (excluding: the 12th Battalion area as above; Broken Hill, Torrowangee and Silverton; and the 44th Battalion area, including Corowa, South Corowa, Mulwala, Moama, Mathoura, and Deniliquin) and the 57th Battalion area of Victoria, including Wodonga, Barnawartha, Chiltern and Tallangatta.
* 3rd Military District (3MD) – Victoria (excluding the 57th Battalion area as above), including the 44th Battalion area as above.
* 4th Military District (4MD) – South Australia and Broken Hill, Torrowangee, and Silverton in New South Wales.
* 5th Military District (5MD) – Western Australia.
* 6th Military District (6MD) – Tasmania.

For about three years, between 1939 and 1942, there were an additional two districts.
* 7th Military District (7MD) – Northern Territory and the Kimberley region.
* 8th Military District (8MD) – Territories of Papua &amp; New Guinea

===China===

====Republic of China====
There were 76 northern military districts or military regions (軍區), or war areas, which were the largest formations of the National Revolutionary Army, under the Military Affairs Commission, chaired by Chiang Kai-shek during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. During the Second Sino-Japanese War the National Revolutionary Army eventually organized itself into twelve Military Regions.
====People&#x27;s Republic of China====
The military regions (originally eleven, then seven) of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army were divided into military districts (usually contiguous with provinces) and military sub-districts, under the command of the Central Military Commission.

In February 2016, the 7 military regions were changed to 5 theater commands:

* Eastern Theater Command
* Southern Theater Command
* Western Theater Command
* Northern Theater Command
* Central Theater Command

===France===

====Third Republic====
Under the Third Republic, a military region comprised several departments which supported an army corps. For many years up to 21 military regions were active.

On 24 July 1873, the French Parliament passed a law which created 18 military regions in metropolitan France. A 19th Army Corps was created in Algeria in September 1873 (see ). In 1905, the strength of the &quot;Troupes coloniales&quot; stationed in the 19 military districts of metropolitan France was reported at 2,123 officers and 26,581 other ranks. In 1946, following the Second World War ten military regions were created or recreated, in accordance with a decree of 18 February 1946. They included the 1st (Paris); 2e (Lille); 3e (Rennes); 4e (Bordeaux); 5e (Toulouse); 6e (Metz); 7e (Dijon); 8th (Lyon); the 9th (Marseille), and the 10th in Algeria. The 10th Military Region (France) supervised French Algeria during the Algerian War.

====Fifth Republic====
With the evolution of administrative organization, France was divided into regional administrative districts (circa 1963) (administrative region dependent of a prefect of the region). The military organisation then combined the administrative organization and in each CAR corresponded a territorial military division (TMD). On the defence side, these military divisions have been grouped into military regions. Their number varied depending on the period. The current number is six.

The Défense opérationnelle du territoire supervised reserve and home defence activities from 1959 to the 1970s. However, by the 1980s the number had been reduced to six: the 1st Military Region (France) with its headquarters in Paris, the 2nd Military Region (France) at Lille, the 3rd Military Region (France) at Rennes, the 4th Military Region (France) at Bordeaux, the 5th at Lyons and 6th at Metz. Each supervised up to five &quot;division militaire territoriale&quot; – military administrative sub-divisions, in 1984 sometimes supervising up to three reserve regiments each. 

In the twenty-first century, under the latest thorough reform of the French security and defence sector, there are seven each with a territorial ground army region: Paris (or Île-de-France, HQ in Paris), Nord (HQ in Lille), Ouest (HQ in Rennes), Sud-Ouest (HQ in Bordeaux), Sud (HQ in Marseille), Sud-Est (HQ in Lyon), Est (HQ in Strasbourg).

===Germany===

==== German Reich ====

From 1919 until 1945, Germany used the system of military districts () to relieve field commanders of as much administrative work as possible and to provide a regular flow of trained recruits and supplies to the Field Army. The method they adopted was to separate the Field Army (Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres) from the Home Command (Heimatkriegsgebiet) and to entrust the responsibilities of training, conscription, supply and equipment to that command.

The Commander of the Infantry Corps with the identical number also commanded the &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; in peacetime, but command of the &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; passed to his second-in command at the outbreak of war.

In peacetime, the &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; was the home to the Infantry Corps of the same number and all subordinate units of that Corps.

====Federal Republic of Germany====

Until 2013 the German Armed Forces (&quot;Bundeswehr&quot;) had four military districts – &quot;Wehrbereichskommando&quot; (WBK) as part of the &quot;Streitkräftebasis&quot; or Joint Service Support Command. Each WBK controlled several &quot;Landeskommandos&quot; (State Commands) due to the federal structure of Germany who have taken over functions carried out by the Verteidigungsbezirkskommandos (VBKs) or Military Region Commands (Defence District Commands) as. These command authorities are in charge of all military facilities. Now the Landeskommmandos are led by the National Territorial Command called Kommando Territoriale Aufgaben der Bundeswehr (KdoTerrAufgBw).

===Indonesia===
The Indonesian Army operates with military districts, known as &quot;Komando Daerah Militer&quot; (Military Region Command) abbreviated Kodam. It was created by General Soedirman as a system initially called &quot;Wehrkreise&quot;, adapted from the German system during World War II. The system was later ratified in &quot;Surat Perintah Siasat No.1&quot; (No.1 Strategy Command Letter), signed in November 1948.

The Military regional commands function as a means of circle of defense, or regional defense, to defend the designated islands/provinces under Indonesian territory. Each &quot;Kodam&quot; is commanded by a Major General and has full authority to commence operations with the force under his jurisdiction. The commander (known as &quot;Panglima Kodam&quot; abbreviated &quot;Pangdam&quot;) reports to the Chief of Army Staff (KSAD) and is responsible for territorial defence during times of war and development and supervision during times of peace. He is also responsible for ensuring security and protection for VVIP visiting his territory, e.g Presidential visits, etc.

===Kazakhstan===
A Regional Command (, &quot;Aımaqtyq qolbasshylyq&quot;; , &quot;Regional&#x27;naya komanda&quot;) in Kazakhstan operates in a similar fashion to Russian military districts.

The Kazakh Ground Forces 
are divided into four regional commands:

*Regional Command &quot;Astana&quot; headquartered in Astana
*Regional Command &quot;East&quot; headquartered in Semey
*Regional Command &quot;West&quot; headquartered in Atyrau
*Regional Command &quot;South&quot; headquartered in Taraz

===Poland===

Initially, right after the First World War, Poland had five military districts (1918–1921):
* Kraków Military District (Krakowski Okręg Wojskowy), HQ in Kraków
* Łódź Military District (Łódzki Okręg Wojskowy), HQ in Łódź
* Lublin Military District (Lubelski Okręg Wojskowy), HQ in Lublin.
* Poznań Military District (Poznański Okręg Wojskowy), HQ in Poznań
* Warsaw Military District (Warszawski Okręg Wojskowy), HQ in Warsaw.

In 1921, due to reorganization, the military districts were replaced with Dowództwo Okręgu Korpusu (&quot;DOK&quot; – Corps District Command). In the Second Polish Republic there were ten DOKs: 
* I – Warsaw
* II – Lublin
* III – Grodno
* IV – Łódź
* V – Kraków
* VI – Lwów
* VII – Poznań
* VIII – Toruń
* IX – Brześć nad Bugiem
* X – Przemyśl

Each DOK consisted of four large units (three infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade).

For district arrangements after World War II see Polish Land Forces. The Kraków Military District disbanded in 1953. From 1999 Poland has been divided into two military districts, the Pomeranian Military District and the Silesian Military District, both were disbanded by the end of 2011.

===Russia &amp; Soviet Union===
====Russian Empire====
The Russian Empire&#x27;s military district (, &quot;voyenny okrug&quot;) was a territorial association of military units, formations, military schools, and various local military establishments. This territorial division type was utilized in Imperial Russia, USSR and is currently in use in Russian Federation.

Such territorial division provided convenient management of army units, their training and other activities regarding the country&#x27;s readiness to defend itself.

====Soviet Union====

In the USSR, the military districts continued to perform the same role they had done in the Russian Empire, with first six military districts (Yaroslavsky, Moskovsky, Orlovsky, Belomorsky, Uralsky, and Privolzhsky) were formed on 31 March 1918 during the Russian Civil War.

This increased to 17 military districts of the USSR at the beginning of July 1940 shortly before the USSR was invaded by Germany and entered the Second World War, and were used to create combat Fronts after commencement of the German invasion of the USSR.

During the war the districts were further divided into geographic regions for logistic reasons, these being:

*North and North Western districts
*West and Central USSR districts
*South and South Western districts
*Siberian and Central Asian districts
*Far Eastern districts

After the war, the number was increased to 33 to aid in demobilisation of forces, but by October 1946, they had been reduced to 21.

By the end of the 1980s, immediately before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there were sixteen military districts, within three to five main strategic Theatre groupings.

====Russian Federation====
Military districts (, &quot;voyenny okrug&quot;) in the Russian Federation operates under the command of the district headquarters, headed by the district commander, and is subordinated to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. (Previously under Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces General Nikolai Kormiltsev, the military districts reported to the General Staff via the Russian Ground Forces staff.) It is a territorial association of military units, formations, military schools, and various local military establishments. This territorial division type was historically adopted, originally by Imperial Russia, to provide a more efficient management of army units, their training and other operations activities related to combat readiness.

From 1992 to 2010, the Armed Forces maintained a diminishing number of former Soviet Armed Forces districts – Leningrad Military District, Moscow Military District, Volga-Urals Military District, North Caucasus Military District, Siberian Military District, Far East Military District.
In 2009–2010, these districts were reorganised into 4 Military Districts comprising regional Joint Strategic Commands.

In 2014 Northern Fleet was reorganized into separate Joint Strategic Command.

*Leningrad Military District with headquarters in Saint Petersburg
*Southern Military District with headquarters in Rostov-on-Don
*Central Military District with headquarters in Ekaterinburg
*Eastern Military District with headquarters in Khabarovsk
*Moscow Military District with headquarters in Moscow
===Sweden===

The military district (, usually abbreviated to Milo) was an administrative division of the Swedish Armed Forces, and was a higher regional level subdivision. The commander of a military district, the &quot;Militärområdesbefälhavare&quot; (also &quot;militärbefälhavare&quot;), commanded the Swedish Army divisions stationed in the region, the regional naval command, the regional air defence sector as well as the lower regional level subdivision defence districts that made up the military district. The commander answered directly to the Supreme Commander. The military districts in the modern form were created in 1966, and each district was named according to the geographical area they covered. Several changes were made, such as creating or merging districts, until all military districts were disbanded in 2000. After the Defence Act of 2000 the military districts were replaced by new military districts (, usually abbreviated to MD). The new military districts corresponded geographically to the former military districts, however, they did not have the same territorial and operational tasks. In 2005, the military districts were replaced to some extent by four Security and Cooperation Sections ().

In 2013, the Security and Cooperation Sections were replaced by four Military regions (Swedish: Militärregion, MR): Northern, Central, Western and Southern. A fifth military region, Gotland Military Region (Militärregion Gotland, MR G) was formed in 2019.

===United Kingdom===

British Army regional districts have evolved slowly over the previous 150 years or so. For many years there were regional commands in the UK, including Aldershot Command (from 1880), Eastern Command, Northern Command, Scottish Command, Southern Command and Western Command (from 1905). By 1985 these were superseded by districts, and until the spring of 1991 there were nine of them. Antony Beevor wrote in his revised edition of &quot;Inside the British Army&quot; in 1991 that &#x27;..the first of the minor districts to be amalgamated were North West District, Western District, and Wales, to form a new Western District.&#x27; HQ Northern Ireland remained separate and reported to Headquarters United Kingdom Land Forces only on non-operational matters.

From 1995, UK commands and later districts were replaced by regenerative divisions. 2nd Division, 4th Division, 5th Division and London District acted as regional commands within the UK reporting to Commander Regional Forces. Scotland District was absorbed by 2nd Division in 2000. The divisions were responsible for training subordinate formations and units under their command for operations in the UK, such as Military Aid to the Civil Community, as well as training units for overseas deployments. 2nd, 4th and 5th Divisions were replaced by Support Command on 1 November 2011.

===United States===

The military department was a military and administrative command of the US Army.
Present day US military organization is structured around Unified Combatant Commands, which encompass different geographical areas and responsibilities.

*United States Africa Command
*United States Central Command
*United States European Command
*United States Indo-Pacific Command
*United States Northern Command
*United States Southern Command

=== Uzbekistan ===

Military districts () of the Armed Forces of Uzbekistan are under the jurisdiction of the defense ministry of the republic. In May 2001, the Tashkent Garrison was transformed into the Tashkent Military District. The following are a list of military districts in Uzbekistan:

*Northwest Military District (HQ Nukus)
*Southwest Special Military District (HQ Qarshi)
*Central Military District (HQ Dzhizak)
*Eastern Military District (HQ Ferghana)
*Tashkent Military District (HQ Tashkent)

The replenishment of the ranks of divisions and units in wartime is done by order of the commanders of military districts.

===Vietnam===
Vietnam People&#x27;s Army has 8 Military Regions:
* Hanoi Capital Command: It is directly under the Ministry of Defense of Vietnam; tasked to organize, build, manage and command armed forces defending the capital. The headquarters is in Hanoi.

<text> () or Admiral of the Fleet is the most senior naval officer rank of the Royal Thai Navy. Today it is only ceremonially held by members of the Thai Royal family. The Royal Thai Army equivalent is known as just &quot;Chom Phon&quot; and &quot;Chom Phon Akat&quot; for the Royal Thai Air Force.

The rank was formally created in 1888, together with all other ranks of the military by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), who wanted to modernize his Armed Forces through western lines.

<doc id="896120" wikidata="Q1068652" url="?curid=896120" title="History of programming languages">
<text>The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax. Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions.

The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951, for his PhD thesis. The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.

== Early history ==
During 1842–1849, Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about Charles Babbage&#x27;s newest proposed machine: the Analytical Engine; she supplemented the memoir with notes that specified in detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the engine, recognized by most of historians as the world&#x27;s first published computer program.

Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage&#x27;s Difference Engine both were designed to utilize punched cards, which would describe the sequence of operations that their programmable machines should perform. 

The first computer codes were specialized for their applications: e.g., Alonzo Church was able to express the lambda calculus in a formulaic way and the Turing machine was an abstraction of the operation of a tape-marking machine.

== First programming languages ==
In the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created. The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand-tuned assembly language programs. It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort.

An early proposal for a high-level programming language was Plankalkül, developed by Konrad Zuse for his Z1 computer between 1942 and 1945 but not implemented at the time.

The first functioning programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the early 1950s. John Mauchly&#x27;s Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer. Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be interpreted into machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code.
In the early 1950s, Alick Glennie developed Autocode, possibly the first compiled programming language, at the University of Manchester. In 1954, a second iteration of the language, known as the &quot;Mark 1 Autocode&quot;, was developed for the Mark 1 by R. A. Brooker. Brooker, with the University of Manchester, also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s. The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by Douglas Hartree of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimization and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development, Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machine.

In 1954, FORTRAN was invented at IBM by a team led by John Backus; it was the first widely used high-level general purpose language to have a functional implementation, in contrast to only a design on paper. When FORTRAN was first introduced, it was viewed with skepticism due to bugs, delays in development, and the comparative efficiency of &quot;hand-coded&quot; programs written in assembly. However, in a hardware market that was rapidly evolving, the language eventually became known for its efficiency. It is still a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world&#x27;s TOP500 fastest supercomputers.

Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, named FLOW-MATIC. It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English language programming language and implemented a prototype. The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959. Flow-Matic was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendant AIMACO were in use at the time.

Other languages still in use today include LISP (1958), invented by John McCarthy and COBOL (1959), created by the Short Range Committee. Another milestone in the late 1950s was the publication, by a committee of American and European computer scientists, of &quot;a new language for algorithms&quot;; the &quot;ALGOL 60 Report&quot; (the &quot;ALGOrithmic Language&quot;). This report consolidated many ideas circulating at the time and featured three key language innovations:

* nested block structure: code sequences and associated declarations could be grouped into blocks without having to be turned into separate, explicitly named procedures;
* lexical scoping: a block could have its own private variables, procedures and functions, invisible to code outside that block, that is, information hiding.
Another innovation, related to this, was in how the language was described:
* a mathematically exact notation, Backus–Naur form (BNF), was used to describe the language&#x27;s syntax. Nearly all subsequent programming languages have used a variant of BNF to describe the context-free portion of their syntax.

ALGOL 60 was particularly influential in the design of later languages, some of which soon became more popular. The Burroughs large systems were designed to be programmed in an extended subset of ALGOL.

ALGOL&#x27;s key ideas were continued, producing ALGOL 68:

* syntax and semantics became even more orthogonal, with anonymous routines, a recursive typing system with higher-order functions, etc.;
* not only the context-free part, but the full language syntax and semantics were defined formally, in terms of Van Wijngaarden grammar, a formalism designed specifically for this purpose.
ALGOL 68&#x27;s many little-used language features (for example, concurrent and parallel blocks) and its complex system of syntactic shortcuts and automatic type coercions made it unpopular with implementers and gained it a reputation of being &quot;difficult&quot;. Niklaus Wirth actually walked out of the design committee to create the simpler Pascal language.

Some notable languages that were developed in this period include:
* 1951 – Regional Assembly Language
* 1952 – Autocode
* 1954 – IPL (forerunner to LISP)
* 1955 – FLOW-MATIC (led to COBOL)
* 1957 – FORTRAN (first compiler)
* 1957 – COMTRAN (precursor to COBOL)
* 1958 – LISP
* 1958 – ALGOL 58
* 1959 – FACT (forerunner to COBOL)
* 1959 – COBOL
* 1959 – RPG
* 1960 – ALGOL 60
* 1962 – APL
* 1962 – Simula
* 1962 – SNOBOL
* 1963 – CPL (forerunner to C)
* 1964 – Speakeasy
* 1964 – BASIC
* 1964 – PL/I
* 1966 – JOSS
* 1966 – MUMPS
* 1967 – BCPL (forerunner to C)
* 1967 – Logo (an educational language that later influenced Smalltalk and Scratch).
== Establishing fundamental paradigms ==

The period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s brought a major flowering of programming languages. Most of the major language paradigms now in use were invented in this period:

* Speakeasy, developed in 1964 at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) by Stanley Cohen, is an object-oriented programming system (OOPS), much like the later MATLAB, IDL and Mathematica numerical package. Speakeasy has a clear Fortran foundation syntax. It first addressed efficient physics computing internally at ANL, was modified for research use (as &quot;Modeleasy&quot;) for the Federal Reserve Board in the early 1970s and then was made available commercially; Speakeasy and Modeleasy are still in use.
* Simula, invented in the late 1960s by Nygaard and Dahl as a superset of ALGOL 60, was the first language designed to support object-oriented programming.
* FORTH, the earliest concatenative programming language was designed by Charles Moore in 1969 as a personal development system while at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).
* C, an early systems programming language, was developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs between 1969 and 1973.
* Smalltalk (mid-1970s) provided a complete ground-up design of an object-oriented language.
* Prolog, designed in 1972 by Alain Colmerauer, Phillipe Roussel, and Robert Kowalski, was the first logic programming language.
* ML built a polymorphic type system (invented by Robin Milner in 1973) on Lisp, pioneering statically typed functional programming languages. Each of these languages spawned an entire family of descendants, and most modern languages count at least one of them in their ancestry.

The 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of &quot;structured programming&quot;, which essentially meant programming without the use of codice_1. A significant fraction of programmers believed that, even in languages that provide codice_2, it is bad programming style to use it except in rare circumstances. This debate was closely related to language design: some languages had no codice_2, which forced the use of structured programming.

To provide even faster compile times, some languages were structured for &quot;one-pass compilers&quot; which expect subordinate routines to be defined first, as with Pascal, where the main routine, or driver function, is the final section of the program listing.

Some notable languages that were developed in this period include:

* 1967 – BCPL (forerunner to B)
* 1967 – Logo
* 1969 – B (forerunner to C)
* 1970 – Pascal
* 1970 – Forth
* 1972 – C 
* 1972 – Smalltalk
* 1972 – Prolog
* 1973 – ML
* 1975 – Scheme
* 1978 – SQL (a query language, later extended)
== 1980s: consolidation, modules, performance ==

The 1980s were years of relative consolidation in imperative languages. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the prior decade. C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized Ada, a systems programming language intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called fifth-generation programming languages that incorporated logic programming constructs. The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp. Research in Miranda, a functional language with lazy evaluation, began to take hold in this decade.

One important new trend in language design was an increased focus on programming for large-scale systems through the use of &quot;modules&quot;, or large-scale organizational units of code. Modula, Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s. Module systems were often wedded to generic programming constructs: generics being, in essence, parametrized modules (see also Polymorphism (computer science)).

Although major new paradigms for imperative programming languages did not appear, many researchers expanded on the ideas of prior languages and adapted them to new contexts. For example, the languages of the Argus and Emerald systems adapted object-oriented programming to distributed computing systems.

The 1980s also brought advances in programming language implementation. The reduced instruction set computer (RISC) movement in computer architecture postulated that hardware should be designed for compilers rather than for human assembly programmers. Aided by central processing unit (CPU) speed improvements that enabled increasingly aggressive compiling methods, the RISC movement sparked greater interest in compiler technology for high-level languages.

Language technology continued along these lines well into the 1990s. 

Some notable languages that were developed in this period include:

* 1980 – C++ (as C with classes, renamed in 1983)
* 1983 – Ada
* 1984 – Common Lisp
* 1984 – MATLAB
* 1984 – dBase III, dBase III Plus (Clipper and FoxPro as FoxBASE)
* 1985 – Eiffel
* 1986 – Objective-C
* 1986 – LabVIEW (visual programming language)
* 1986 – Erlang
* 1987 – Perl
* 1988 – PIC (markup language)
* 1988 – Tcl
* 1988 – Wolfram Language (as part of Mathematica, only got a separate name in June 2013)


== 1990s: the Internet age ==

The rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s was the next major historic event in programming languages. By opening up a radically new platform for computer systems, the Internet created an opportunity for new languages to be adopted. In particular, the JavaScript programming language rose to popularity because of its early integration with the Netscape Navigator web browser. Various other scripting languages achieved widespread use in developing customized applications for web servers such as PHP. The 1990s saw no fundamental novelty in imperative languages, but much recombination and maturation of old ideas. This era began the spread of functional languages. A big driving philosophy was programmer productivity. Many rapid application development (RAD) languages emerged, which usually came with an integrated development environment (IDE), garbage collection, and were descendants of older languages. All such languages were object-oriented. These included Object Pascal, Objective Caml (renamed OCaml), Visual Basic, and Java. Java in particular received much attention.

More radical and innovative than the RAD languages were the new scripting languages. These did not directly descend from other languages and featured new syntaxes and more liberal incorporation of features. Many consider these scripting languages to be more productive than even the RAD languages, but often because of choices that make small programs simpler but large programs more difficult to write and maintain. Nevertheless, scripting languages came to be the most prominent ones used in connection with the Web.

Some programming languages included other languages in their distribution to save the development time. for example both of Python and Ruby included Tcl to support GUI programming through libraries like Tkinter.

Some notable languages that were developed in this period include:

* 1990 – Haskell
* 1991 – Python
* 1991 – Visual Basic
* 1993 – Lua
* 1993 – R
* 1994 – CLOS (part of ANSI Common Lisp)
* 1995 – Ruby
* 1995 – Ada 95
* 1995 – Java
* 1995 – Visual FoxPro
* 1995 – JavaScript
* 1995 – PHP
* 1996 – OCaml
* 1997 – Rebol
== 2000s: programming paradigms ==

Programming language evolution continues, and more programming paradigms are used in production. 

Some of the trends have included:
* Increasing support for functional programming in mainstream languages used commercially, including purely functional programming for making code easier to reason about and to parallelize (at both micro- and macro- levels)
* Constructs to support concurrent and distributed programming.
* Mechanisms for adding security and reliability verification to the language: extended static checking, dependent typing, information flow control, static thread safety.
* Alternative mechanisms for composability and modularity: mixins, traits, typeclasses, delegates, aspects.
* Component-oriented software development.
* More interest in visual programming languages like Scratch, LabVIEW, and PWCT 
* Metaprogramming, reflective programming (reflection), or access to the abstract syntax tree
** Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) allowing developers to insert code in another module or class at &quot;join points&quot;
** Domain-specific languages and code generation
*** XML for graphical interface (XUL, Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML))

Big Tech companies introduced multiple new programming languages that are designed to serve their needs. for example:
* Microsoft introduced C# and F#
* Google introduced Go 

Some notable languages developed during this period include:
* 2000 – ActionScript
* 2001 – C#
* 2001 – D
* 2002 – Scratch
* 2003 – Groovy
* 2003 – Scala
* 2005 – F#
* 2005 – Haxe
* 2006 – PowerShell
* 2007 – Clojure
* 2008 – Nim
* 2009 – Go
== 2010s: the Mobile age ==
Programming language evolution continues with the rise of new programming domains.

* Increased interest in distribution and mobility.
* Integration with databases, including XML and relational databases.
* Open source as a developmental philosophy for languages, including the GNU Compiler Collection and languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby, and Scala.
* Massively parallel languages for GPU graphics processing units and supercomputer arrays, including OpenCL
* Early research into quantum computing programming languages (see list)
* Early research in applying artificial intelligence (AI) methods to generate code using AI like using GPT-3 and Gemini.
* Multiple new programming languages tried to provide a modern replacement for the C programming language.
* Many new programming languages are influenced by the popular dynamic languages and promised adding type safety without decreasing the productivity.
* Many new programming languages uses LLVM in their implementation. 

Many Big Tech companies continued introducing new programming languages that are designed to serve their needs and provides first-class support for their platforms. for example:
* Microsoft introduced TypeScript, Q# and Bosque
* Google introduced Dart
* Apple introduced Swift.
* Meta introduced Hack. 

Some notable languages developed during this period include:
* 2011 – Dart
* 2011 – Kotlin
* 2012 – Julia
* 2012 – TypeScript 
* 2012 – Elixir
* 2014 – Swift
* 2014 – Hack
* 2015 – Rust
* 2015 – Raku
* 2016 – Ring
* 2016 – Zig
Other new programming languages include Elm, 
Ballerina, Red, Crystal, V (Vlang), Reason.

== 2020s: Current trends ==

The development of new programming languages continues, and some new languages appears with focus on providing a replacement for current languages. These new languages try to provide the advantages of a known language like C++ (versatile and fast) while adding safety or reducing complexity. Other new languages try to bring ease of use as provided by Python while adding performance as a priority. Also, the growing of Machine Learning and AI tools still plays a big rule behind these languages&#x27; development, where some visual languages focus on integrating these AI tools while other textual languages focus on providing more suitable support for developing them. 

Some notable new programming languages include:

* 2021 – Power Fx 
* 2022 – Carbon 
* 2023 – Mojo

<text>Gençlerbirliği Spor Kulübü (pronounced ), commonly known as Gençlerbirliği, is a Turkish sports club based in Ankara. Formed in 1923, Gençlerbirliği are nicknamed &quot;Ankara Rüzgârı&quot; (The Wind of Ankara) or simply &quot;Gençler&quot; (The Youth). The club colours are black and red. The football team currently plays its home matches at Eryaman Stadium, following the closure of the Ankara 19 Mayıs.

Domestically, the club have won the Turkish Cup twice, in 1987 and 2001. They have also won the former Turkish Football Championship twice and the regional Ankara Football League a record nine times. In Europe, Gençlerbirliği&#x27;s greatest success came in 2004. The club reached the fourth round of the UEFA Cup before losing to eventual champions Valencia.

==History==

Gençlerbirliği were founded in a slightly different way compared to many other football clubs, having been established by students from a high school, &quot;Ankara Erkek Lisesi&quot; (Sultani Mektebi) now Ankara Atatürk Lisesi . The students in question (Ramiz Eren, Mennan İz, Mazhar Atacanlı, Sait, Kenan, Nuri, Namık Katoğlu, Namık Ambarcıoğlu, Rıdvan Kırmacı, Hafi Araç, Ruhi, Sarı Ziya and Hakkı) had failed to be selected for their own school team, and asked one of their student friends, Asim, to talk with his father about setting up a football team for them to show how well they could play.

On 14 March 1923, Asim&#x27;s father, the member of parliament from Muş Province, established the team for his son and his friends. Since all the members of the team were students he chose the name &#x27;Youth Union&#x27; (Turkish: Gençlerbirliği). They elected Sarı Ziya&#x27;s father Faik Bey as their first chairman.
Subsequently, these young students wanted to play against the school team which had not selected them. Gençlerbirliği won the game, played at &quot;Hamit tarlası&quot;, 3–0. According to these young rebellious players this victory forged the identity of their new team.

They won the regional Ankara Football League a record nine times between 1923 and 1959, when the league had first level status before the introduction of a nationwide league. Their greatest success domestically were the victories in the former Turkish Football Championship, when they became Turkish champions in 1941 and 1946. Gençler entered the Turkish National League in 1959 and played 12 seasons until relegation in the 1969–70 season. They played in the second level until relegation to third level in the 1978–79 season. The club came back to second level after the merger of the third level with second level, at the end of the 1979–80 season. They finished second from last in Group A of the Second League, and had to relegate to the regional league. But, since the number of teams in the second division was increased, Gençlerbirliği were readmitted. The club won Group D in the 1982–83 season and finally returned to the top-flight after 13 years. They relegated again in 1987–88 season. Finally, Gençlerbirliği returned to the top-flight in the 1988–89 season, in their first return attempt. Gençlerbirliği&#x27;s most successful seasons in the Süper Lig are 1965–66 and 2002–03, when they reached the third place. At the end of the 2017–18 season Gençler only reached the 17th place and as a result the club relegated to the second tier TFF First League.

==Colours==
There are two rumors about how Gençlerbirliği got their team colours, black and red:
* The young students went to a local haberdashers and the only available colours were black and red. They purchased these colours to sew their own kit.
* The outskirts of Ankara during spring time see plenty of poppy flowers (&quot;Gelincik&quot;) blooming and Gençlerbirliği selected the red and black of this flower for their colours. 

==Rivalry==
Gençlerbirliği&#x27;s arch-rival are the neighbouring club Ankaragücü and games between the clubs are considered as the &quot;Derby of the Capital&quot;.

==Youth academy and scouting==
Gençlerbirliği have always been one of the teams in Turkey most notable for their talented young footballers that they procure through scouting both in Turkey and throughout Europe and Africa. For example, Geremi was scouted and raised by the club, transferred to Real Madrid and later Chelsea. Another of Gençlerbirliği&#x27;s young stars Isaac Promise received the 2005–06 Super League Individual Youth player of the Year award. Also included was Arda Güler, who was sold to Fenerbahce.

Gençlerbirliği&#x27;s state-of-the-art youth academy is located in Beştepe, Ankara with of training facilities (Beştepe İlhan Cavcav Tesisleri).

Gençlerbirliği had been run by İlhan Cavcav from 1978 until his death in 2017. With Cavcav&#x27;s help, Gençlerbirliği have become one of the more stable clubs in Turkey. This has been achieved mainly through the departure of the most talented players every season to the other clubs in Turkey. Departing players are usually replaced with much cheaper imports from Turkey, Europe or Africa.

<text>Michaele Schreyer (born 9 August 1951) is a German politician of Alliance 90/The Greens who served as a European Commissioner from September 1999 to November 2004, holding the budget portfolio. 

==Education==
Schreyer wrote her doctoral thesis on tax federalism at the University of Cologne.

==Political career==
From 1983 until 1987, Schreyer worked as an advisor on financial policy to the Green Party&#x27;s parliamentary group in the Bundestag.

In 1989, Schreyer was appointed State Minister for Urban Development in the government of Governing Mayor Walter Momper of Berlin. In the 1990 state elections, she was elected to the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin. Between 1995 and 1997, she served as chairwoman of the Sub-Committee on Public Housing. In 1998, she assumed the leadership of the Green Party&#x27;s parliamentary group, alongside Renate Künast.

===European Commissioner, 2000–2004===
In 2000, Germany&#x27;s Chancellor Gerhard Schröder nominated Schreyer, alongside Günter Verheugen, as one of two German members of the European Commission under President Romano Prodi. In the Prodi Commission, Schreyer took on an enlarged portfolio for control of the 80 billion euro ($83.73 billion) budget of the European Union.

During Schreyer&#x27;s time in office, the European Commission filed a high-profile civil lawsuit in the United States against Philip Morris International and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company seeking damages for what it called their involvement with organized crime in smuggling cigarettes into Europe. By 2004, Schreyer and Philip Morris had negotiated a settlement under which the company agreed to pay about $1 billion over 12 years.

<doc id="896125" wikidata="Q1477018" url="?curid=896125" title="SAE J1939">
<text>Society of Automotive Engineers standard SAE J1939 is the vehicle bus recommended practice used for communication and diagnostics among vehicle components. Originating in the car and heavy-duty truck industry in the United States, it is now widely used in other parts of the world.

SAE J1939 is used in the commercial vehicle area for connection and communication throughout the vehicle, with the physical layer defined in ISO 11898. A different physical layer is used between the tractor and trailer, specified in ISO 11992.

==History==
Originally, Controller Area Network (CAN) was not mentioned in J1939, which covered cars and tractor-trailer rigs, and with some dual and triple use 8-bit addresses assigned by the SAE J1939 board. CAN was not originally free, but its instruction set did fit in the custom instruction format of J1939. This was true as of 2000. Since then, CAN has been included, the chipset for J1939 has been clocked faster, and 16-bit addresses (PGN) have replaced 8-bit addresses.

J1939, ISO 11783 and NMEA 2000 all share the same high level protocol. SAE J1939 can be considered the replacement for the older SAE J1708 and SAE J1587 specifications.

==Definition==
SAE J1939 defines five layers in the seven-layer OSI network model, and this includes the Controller Area Network (CAN) ISO 11898 specification (using only the 29-bit/&quot;extended&quot; identifier) for the physical and data-link layers. Under J1939/11 and J1939/15, the data rate is specified as 250 kbit/s, with J1939/14 specifying 500 kbit/s. The session and presentation layers are not part of the specification. The later use of CAN FD is currently discussed.

All J1939 packets, except for the request packet, contain eight bytes of data and a standard header which contains an index called Parameter Group Number (PGN), which is embedded in the message&#x27;s 29-bit identifier. A PGN identifies a message&#x27;s function and associated data. J1939 attempts to define standard PGNs to encompass a wide range of automotive, agricultural, marine and off-road vehicle purposes. A range of PGNs (00FF0016 through 00FFFF16, inclusive) is reserved for proprietary use. PGNs define the data which is made up of a variable number of Suspect Parameter Number (SPN) elements defined for unique data. For example, there exists a predefined SPN for engine RPM.

==Applications==
SAE J1939 has been adopted widely by diesel engine manufacturers. One driving force behind this is the increasing adoption of the engine Electronic Control Unit (ECU), which provides one method of controlling exhaust gas emissions within US and European standards. The telematics data is used (via Fleet Telematics Systems) by Fleet Management Systems to let fleet operators keep track of vehicle and driver performance, such as fuel consumption, safety events, and repair time.

Because of the demanding standards, engine development is expensive, and truck-based engines are reused in many fields. Consequently, SAE J1939 can now be found in a range of diesel-powered applications: vehicles (on- and off-road and rail), marine propulsion, power generation and industrial pumping.

<doc id="896126" wikidata="Q1022860" url="?curid=896126" title="Tablighi Jamaat">
<text>Tablighi Jamaat ( , also translated as &quot;propagation party&quot; or &quot;preaching party&quot;) is an international Islamic religious movement. It focuses on exhorting Muslims to be more religiously observant and encourages fellow members to return to practise their religion according to the teachings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and secondarily give &quot;dawah&quot; (calling) to non-Muslims. &quot;One of the most widespread Sunni&quot; &quot;islah&quot; (reform) and called &quot;one of the most influential religious movements in 20th-century Islam,&quot; the organization is estimated to have between 12 and 80 million adherents worldwide, spread over 150 countries, with the majority living in South Asia.

The group encourages its followers to undertake short-term preaching missions (&quot;khuruj&quot;), lasting from a few days to a few months in groups of usually forty days and four months, to preach to Muslims reminding them of &quot;the core teachings of the Prophet Muhammad&quot; and encourage them to attend mosque prayers and sermons. Members &quot;travel, eat, sleep, wash and pray together in the mosques and often observe strict regimens relating to dress and personal grooming&quot;.

Established in 1926 by Muhammad Ilyas Kandhlawi, in the Mewat region of British India, it has roots in the revivalist tradition of the Deobandi school, and developed as a response to the deterioration of moral values and the neglect of aspects of Islam. The movement aims for the spiritual reformation of Islam by working at the grassroots level. The teachings of Tabligh Jamaat are expressed in &quot;Six Principles&quot;: &quot;Kalimah&quot; (Declaration of faith), &quot;Salah&quot; (Prayer), &quot;Ilm-o-zikr&quot; (Reading and Remembrance), &quot;Ikraam-e-Muslim&quot; (Respect for Muslims), &quot;Ikhlas-e-Niyyat&quot; (Sincerity of intention), and &quot;Dawat-o-Tableegh&quot; (Proselytization).

Tablighi Jamaat denies any political affiliation, involvement in debate over political or Islamic doctrine such as fiqh,
let alone terrorism. It maintains its focus is on the study of the sacred scriptures of Islam: the Quran and the Hadith, and that the personal spiritual renewal that results will lead to reformation of society. However, the group has been accused of maintaining political links, and being used by members of Islamic terrorist organizations to recruit operatives.

==History==
The emergence of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided closely with the rise of various Hindu revivalist movements such as &quot;Shuddhi&quot; (purification) and &quot;Sanghatan&quot; (consolidation) launched in the early twentieth century to reconvert Hindus who had converted to Islam and Tablighi Jamaat has been called a &quot;missionary offshoot&quot; of the revivalist Deobandi movement of India.

===Origin===

Muhammad Ilyas Kandhlawi, the founder of Tablighi Jamaat, wanted to create a movement that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Quran decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi dreamed of doing. The inspiration for this came to Ilyas in a dream during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926.

Ilyas abandoned his teaching post at Madrasah Mazahir Uloom in Saharanpur and became a missionary for reforming Muslims (but he did not advocate preaching to non-Muslims). He relocated near Dargah Hazrat Nizamuddin in Delhi, where this movement was formally launched in 1926, or 1927. When setting the guidelines for the movement, he sought inspiration from the practices adopted by Muhammad at the dawn of Islam. Muhammad Ilyas put forward the slogan, , &quot;O Muslims, become [true] Muslims!&quot;. This expressed the central focus of Tablighi Jamaat: their aim to renew Muslims by socially by trying to unite them in embracing the lifestyle of Muhammad. The movement gained a following in a relatively short period and nearly 25,000 people attended the annual conference in November 1941.

At the time, some Muslim Indian leaders feared that Muslims were losing their religious identity and were heedless of Islamic rituals. The movement was never given any name officially, but Ilyas called it &quot;Tahrik-i Imaan&quot;. Muhammad Ilyas died in 1945 and he himself is buried in the Nizām Ad-Dīn Mosque.

The Mewat region where Tablighi Jamaat started near Delhi was inhabited by the Meos, an ethnic group native to the region, most of whom had converted to Islam, and then had adopted Hindu traditions and attitudes when Muslim political power declined in the region, lacking the necessary acumen (according to one author, Roger Ballard) required to resist the cultural and religious influence of majority Hindus, prior to the arrival of Tablighi Jamaat.

===Expansion===
The group began to expand its activities in 1946. The initial expansion within South Asia happened immediately after the partition of India in 1947, when the Pakistan Chapter was established in the hinterlands of Raiwind town near Lahore, Pakistan. The Pakistan Chapter remained the largest until Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan in 1971. Today, the largest Chapter is Bangladesh followed by the second largest in Pakistan. Within two decades of its establishment, the group reached Southwest and Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. The Tablighi Jamaat&#x27;s aversion to politics, and also its lack of any direct and practical economic-political-social viewpoints, helped it enter and operate in societies, especially western countries and societies where politically active religious groups faced restrictions.

===Foreign missions===
The first foreign missions were sent to the Hejaz (western Saudi Arabia) and Britain in 1946. The United States followed and during the 1970s and 1980s the Tablighi Jamaat also established a large presence in continental Europe. In France it was introduced in the 1960s, and grew significantly in the two decades following 1970.

In France, as of 2004, it was represented on the French Council of the Muslim Faith. During the first half-decade of the 21st century Tablighi Jamaat went through a major revival in France, reaching 100,000 followers by 2006. However, the United Kingdom is the current focus of the movement in Europe, primarily due to the large South Asian population that began to arrive there in the 1960s. By 2007, Tablighi Jamaat members were situated at 600 of Britain&#x27;s 1,350 mosques.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the movement made inroads into Central Asia. As of 2007, it was estimated that 10,000 Tablighi Jamaat members could be found in Kyrgyzstan.

Pew Research Center estimates there are between 12 and 80 million adherents, spread across more than 150 countries. By some measures this made Tablighi Jamaat the largest Muslim movement in the World. The majority of the followers of the Tablighi Jamaat live in South Asia. It is estimated that nearly 50,000 members of Tablighi Jamaat are active in the United States.

==Beliefs and objectives==
Members of Tabligh Jamat are allowed to follow their own fiqh as long as it does not deviate from Sunni Islam. Tablighi Jamaat defines its objective with reference to the concept of &quot;Dawah&quot;, the proselytizing or preaching of Islam. Tablighi Jamaat interprets &quot;Dawah&quot; as &quot;enjoining good and forbidding evil&quot; only and defines its objective within the framework of two particular Qur&#x27;anic verses which refer to this mission. Those two verses are:


===Six Attributes (Sifāt)===

When Tablighi Jamaat visits a village or neighborhood, it invites the local Muslims to assemble in the mosque to hear their message in the form of &quot;Six Attributes&quot;. These six Attributes were derived from the lives of the companions of Muhammad, since Muslims believe Sahabah (companions) are the best human beings after Muhammad—It is stated in one hadith, &quot;My Sahabah (companions) are like [guiding] stars, whosoever follows [any] one of them will be guided.&quot; The Six Sifāt are basically a discussion about six special Attributes that when achieved, will just make it easy to follow the entire Dīn. These objectives are:
# Kalimah (ʾīmān&#x27;i Sifāt) — T.J Believes, to achieve it, One must have to strive. To make his iman into Yaqeen. That, Creation cannot do anything without the will of Allah, but Allah can &amp; Peace-Happiness, Success is lying only in the way that Muhammad shows, not in any other worldly ways.
# Salah (aka &quot;Namaz&quot;) — T.J Believes, One must have to try to achieve the sahaba standard salah. in both the inward and outward manners, that the Companions learnt from Muhammad. Have to make a Yaqeen that, by doing so one can become direct recipients from the vast Treasuries of Allah.
# Ilm with Zikr (knowledge and remembrance of Allah) — T.J Believes, One must have to try to know what Allah desires from us at any particular time and condition. know to differentiate halal-Haram. so that he can act accordingly in the way Muhammad taught. Try to achieve, the consciousness and remembrance of Allah in every action, at each moment in one&#x27;s worldly existence. these two are combined because only through the quality of Zikr, A&#x27;mal can be done with the full consciousness and remembrance of Allah. T.J Believes, the benefits of ilm should be learned in Taleem programs &amp; ilm Maslaha from Ulama. The knowledge and remembrance of Allah conducted individually and in sessions where the congregation listens to preaching by the emir, performs prayers, recites the Quran and reads Hadith. The congregation will also use these sessions to eat meals together, thus fostering a sense of community and identity.
# Ikram al-Muslim (Honoring Muslims; Ikram Sifāt) — Treating fellow Muslims &quot;with honor and deference&quot;. T.J Believes, One must have to try to act &quot;Iḥsān&quot; (in the best possible way, with excellence and perfection), toward every Creation. One should invariably fulfil the obligations towards other human beings as commanded by Allah, &amp; as taught by Muhammad. One should be prepared to sacrifice one&#x27;s own rights, for which one will be rewarded in the hereafter. The other aspect of this sifat is, Akhlaq and Haqooq Ul Ibad encompassing rights of the Muslims as well as mankind. It is through these moral values, character building and showing sympathy to Muslims and non Muslims like poor, sick, elderly and other needy Islamic teachings could be practically disseminated.
# Ikhlas-i-Niyyah (Purity, Sincerity of intention; Ikhlāṣ Sifāt) — T.J Believes, One must have to try to be pure, sincere when making an intention. every action is to be undertaken with no other end in view but to please Allah, &amp; to reform oneself. Any slightest deviation from this set path is bound to generate the wrath, anger of Allah instead as it tantamont to admitting partner in that deed. Whether it be ibadat or mu&#x27;amalat, Allah accepts only such deeds which are offered purely with an intention to gain his pleasure only. A small act with purity in intention is great, considered acceptable and fully reward-able by Allah, compared to a big one where a slightest corruption in intention is present.
# Dawah &amp; Tabligh (Invitation and Conveyance, Preach; Dāʿī Sifāt), also Tafrigh-i-Waqt (sparing time in the path of Allah; Missionary tours;) — T.J Believes, As there are no more prophets to come, the responsibility for the effort of Da&#x27;wah now falls upon the Ummah. So, One should spent his life, wealth &amp; time in the way of Allah. so that he can learn the proper use of these three, which was actually borrowed from Allah. Should follow the footsteps of Muhammad, by taking His message door to door. He should make an effort so that everyone can gets closer to Allah, &amp; also withdraw himself from worldly engagements to go forth in missionary groups. spend one night a week, one weekend a month, 40 continuous days a year, and ultimately 120 days at least once in their lives. Women would work among other women or travel occasionally, with their men folk on longer tours. Only in an atmosphere free of worldly thoughts can be there a true receptivity to the message concerned.

==Activities, traditions, methodology==

The activism of Tablighi Jamaat can be characterised by the last of the Six Principles. This principle, &quot;Tafrigh-i-Waqt&quot; (English: sparing of time) justifies the withdrawal from World, though temporarily, for travelling. Travel has been adopted as the most effective method of personal reform and has become an emblematic feature of organisation. They describe the purpose of this retreat as to patch the damages caused by the worldly indulgence and occasionally use the dry-dock parable to explain this.

These individual &quot;jamaats&quot;, each led by an &quot;ameer&quot;, are sent from each markaz across the city or country to remind people to persist on the path of God. The duration of the work depends on the discretion of each &quot;jamaat&quot;. A trip can take an evening, a couple of days or a prolonged duration.

===&quot;Khurūj&quot; (proselytising tour)===
Tabligh Jamaat encourages its followers to follow the pattern of spending &quot;one night a week, one weekend a month, 40 continuous days a year, and ultimately 120 days at least once in their lives engaged in tabligh missions&quot;. During the course of these tours, members are generally seen dressed in simple, white, loose-clothing, carrying sleeping bags on their backs. These members use mosques as their base during this travel but particular mosques, due to more frequent tablighiyat activities, have come to be specifically associated with this organisation. These mosques generally hold the periodic, smaller scale convocations for neighbourhood members.

During their stay in mosques, these &quot;jamaats&quot; conduct a daily &quot;gasht&quot;, which involves visiting local neighbourhoods, preferably with the help of a guide called as rehbar. They invite people to attend the &quot;Maghrib&quot; prayer at their mosque and those who attend are delivered a sermon after the prayers, which essentially outlines the Six Principles. They urge the attendees to spend time in tabligh for self reformation and the propagation of Islam.

Generally, the assumed role of these &quot;jamaat&quot; members cycle in a way that they may be engaged as a preacher, a cook or as a cleaner at other times. Among Tabligh Jamaat members, this is generally referred to as &quot;khidmat&quot; which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements. The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day&#x27;s &quot;mashwara&quot;. The markaz keeps records of each &quot;jamaat&quot; and its members, the identity of whom is verified from their respective mosques. Mosques are used to assist the tablighi activities of individual &quot;jamaats&quot; that voluntarily undertake preaching missions. Members of a &quot;jamaat&quot;, ideally, pay expenses themselves so as to avoid financial dependence on anyone.

===&quot;Ijtema&quot; (annual gathering)===
An annual gathering of followers, called &quot;ijtema&quot;, is summoned at headquarters of the respective countries. A typical &quot;ijtema&quot; continues for three days and ends with an exceptionally long prayer. These gatherings are considered moments of intense blessings by Tabligh Jamaat members and are known to attract members in excess of 2 million in some countries. The oldest ijtema of the World started in Bhopal, capital city of Madhya Pradesh, India. It attracts people from all over the world. Almost 2 million people gather for this annual gathering. One of the largest of such annual gatherings is held in Bangladesh. The Bengali gathering, called &quot;Bishwa Ijtema&quot; (World Gathering), converges followers from around the world in Tongi near Dhaka, Bangladesh, with an attendance exceeding 2 million people. The second largest Tabligh Jamaat gathering takes place in Raiwind, Pakistan which was attended by approximately 1.5 million people in 2004. In 2011 Pakistan divided the Ijtema into two parts and a total of 1 million people attended each of the two Ijtema.

===Methodology===
The method adopted by Muhammad Ilyas was to organise units (called &quot;jamaats&quot;, meaning &quot;Assembly&quot;) of at least ten persons and send them to various villages or neighborhoods to preach. These outings, &quot;Dawah&quot; tours (see below), are now organised by Tablighi Jamaat leaders. In these tours, emphasis is laid on &quot;A hadith about virtues of action&quot; (imitating Muhammad). In the ahadith (reported sayings of Muhammad) of &quot;fazail&quot; (virtues) these has been called &quot;Eemaan&quot; (faith) and &quot;Ihtisab&quot; (for the sake of Allah) and Tablighi Jamaat believes this is the most vital deriving force for reward in &quot;akhirah&quot; (afterlife).
The Tablighi Jamaat founder Ilyas preached that knowledge of virtues and &quot;A&#x27;amalu-Saliha&quot; (Good Deeds and Actions) takes precedence over the knowledge of &quot;Masa&#x27;il&quot; (jurisprudence). Knowing jurisprudence detail (Fara&#x27;id (mandates) and Sunan (traditions) of Salat) is useful only if a person is ready to perform rituals such as offering Salat.
They insist that the best way of learning is teaching and encouraging others, with the books prescribed by Tabligi Jamaat Movement in the light of Quran and Hadith stories of Prophets, &quot;Sahaba&quot; (Companions of Prophet) and &quot;Awlia Allah&quot; (&quot;Friends of Allah&quot;). A collection of books, usually referred as &quot;Tablighi Nisaab&quot; (Tablighi Curriculum), is recommended by Tabligh Jamaat elders for general reading. This set includes four books namely (&quot;Hayatus Sahabah&quot;, &quot;Fazail-e-Amaal&quot;, &quot;Fazail-e-Sadqaat&quot; and &quot;Muntakhab Ahadith&quot;).

In its early days and in South Asia, the Tabligh movement aimed to return to orthodoxy and &quot;purify&quot; the Muslim religio-cultural identity of heterodox or &quot;borderline&quot; Muslims who still practised customs and religious rites connected with Hinduism. Especially to counteract the efforts of Hindu proselytising movements who targeted these often recently converts from Hinduism. Unlike common proselytising movements, Tablighi Jamaat has mostly focused on making Muslims &#x27;better and purer&#x27; and ideally &quot;religiously perfect&quot;, rather than preaching to the non-Muslims. This is because (it believes) dawah to non-Muslims will only be effective (or will be much more effective) when a Muslim reaches &quot;perfection&quot;.

==Organisation==

Tablighi Jamaat follows an informal organisational structure and keeps an introverted institutional profile.
It has been described as &quot;a free-floating religious movement with minimal dependence on hierarchy, leadership positions, and decision-making procedures.&quot;
It keeps its distance from the mass media and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership. The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues, mainly to avoid the disputes that would accompany these endorsements. As an organisation, Tabligh Jamaat does not seek donations and is not funded by anyone; in fact, members have to bear their own expenditures. Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred to as &quot;Tablighi Nisaab&quot; [Tablighi Curriculum]). The emphasis has never been on book learning but rather on first-hand personal communication.

The organisation&#x27;s activities are coordinated through centers called &quot;Markaz&quot;. It also has country-wise centers in over 200 countries to coordinate its activities. These centers organize volunteer, self-funding people in groups (called &quot;jamaats&quot;), averaging ten to twelve people, to remind Muslims to remain steadfast on the path of Allah. These &quot;jamaats&quot; and preaching missions are self-funded by their respective members.

Ameer is the title of supervisor (doyen) in the Tabligh Jamaat, and the attribute largely sought is the quality of faith rather than the worldly rank. The ameer of Tabligh Jamaat is appointed for life by a central consultative council (&quot;shura&quot;) and elders of the Tabligh Jamaat. The first emir was Muhammad Ilyas Kandhalawi, later succeeded by his son Maulana Muhammad Yusuf Kandhalawi and then by Inamul Hasan Kandhlawi, and the current emir is Muhammad Saad Kandhlawi. Sometime in 1992, 3 years before the time of his demise, Inamul Hasan Kandhlawi formed a 10-member advisory committee to appoint an emir (ameer). This 10-member advisory committee consisted of Saeed Ahmed Khan, Mufti Zainul Abideen, Muhammad Umar Palanpuri, Izhar-ul-Hasan Kandhlawi, Zubair-ul-Hassan Kandhlawi, Miyaji Mehraab, Haji Abdul Wahhab, Haji Abdul Muqeet, Haji Afzal, Muhammad Saad Kandhlawi, and Khalid Siddiqui Aligarhi.

==Role of women==
In Tablighi Jamaat, women are encouraged to stay at home, and to choose a life of &quot;segregation between female and male&quot;. However they also engage in proselytizing activities, discussing among themselves in small groups the basics of Tabligh and traveling with their husbands (or another &quot;mahram&quot;) on proselytizing trips. Tabligh inculcates in them that dawah is also important alongside taking care of their spouses or taking care of their children.

According to a 1996 study by Barbara Metcalf, the Tablighi Jamaat has encouraged women to participate since the beginning of the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first &quot;jamaat&quot; of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Accompanied by a close male relative, (&quot;mahram&quot;), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe hijab by covering their faces and hands. &quot;Jamaats&quot; of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings.

Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of &quot;da&#x27;wa&quot; tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in everyday life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation, 6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.

==Criticism and controversy==
=== Lack of political activism ===
Tabligh Jamaat has been criticised—especially by Hizb ut-Tahrir and Jamaat-e-Islami—for its neutral political stance and failure to assist Islamist forces in the fight against secular or non-Islamist opponents. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat&#x27;s neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an Islamic constitution in Pakistan (1950s), Islam vs socialism (1969–1971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement (1977). The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped it operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of Ayub Khan (1960s) and Indira Gandhi (1975–77), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.

The difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that mere political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat&#x27;s attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. It insists that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.

Nasiruddin Albani in his book &quot;Darsush Shaikhul Albani&quot; talks about Tabligh Jamaat&#x27;s aloofness from politics,
===Ideological opposition===
Tablighi Jamaat has received criticism in the Indian subcontinent from the Barelvi movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on &quot;da&#x27;wa&quot; tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women&#x27;s participation by providing childcare.

Tablighi Jamaat has been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe hijab for which the movement has been accused of keeping women &quot;strictly subservient and second string&quot;.

Before the rule of Prince Muhammad bin Salman, Salafist and Wahhabi ulema in Saudi Arabia issued rulings &quot;declaring Tablighis to be deviants and forbidding participation in Tablighi activities unless the reason for the participation is to criticize&quot; the alleged deviancy. They also issued fatwa prohibiting Tablighi literature and preaching in that country.

===Allegations of extremism===
;Denials of extremism
Tablighi Jamaat focuses on religion and generally avoids political activities and debates, claiming that the reformation of society will be achieved through personal spiritual renewal. It has been criticized by some Muslims for being too pacifist/quietist.
Its leaders have denied any links with terrorism, denounced Al-Qaeda,
but admit to not controlling its membership.

At least three western experts on Islam have testified to its apolitical, quietist and/or peaceful character:
*&quot;peaceful and apolitical preaching-to-the-people movement&quot; (Graham E. Fuller).
*&quot;completely apolitical and law abiding&quot; (Olivier Roy).
*&quot;an apolitical, quietist movement of internal grassroots missionary renewal&quot; (Barbara D. Metcalf).
According to the American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC), the Tablighi Jamaat teaches that &quot;jihad&quot; is &quot;primarily as personal purification rather than as holy warfare&quot;. Because of its disavowal of violent jihad, the Tablighi activities have been banned in Saudi Arabia and some Islamist groups have accused the Tabligh of weakening support for jihad amongst Muslims.
Fred Burton, Scott Stewart, Mumtaz Ahmad, and Shireen Khan Burki explain the connection between TJ and jihadism by the opinions that
* TJ shares much with groups that have been accused of breeding jihadis -- Salafis, Wahhabis and other &#x27;revivalist&#x27; Islamist movements. They share the same conservative Islamic values and lifestyle, strict Islamic belief system and rejection of secularism; they &quot;share the same core ideology and ultimate objectives (the expansion of &quot;Dar al Islam&quot; and the establishment of a global Caliphate)&quot;. According to US officials (the U.S. Government has closely monitored Tablighi Jamaat since September 2001), though the Tablighis do not have a direct link with terrorism, the teachings and beliefs of Tablighi Jamat have been a cornerstone for joining in radical Muslim groups.
*By asking Muslims to &quot;shun politics and public affairs&quot;, TJ leaves &quot;a gap&quot; in members&#x27; worldview/belief system; since &quot;some people find they cannot ignore what is happening in the world around them, especially when that world includes wars&quot;. When jihadist groups &quot;offer religiously sanctioned prescriptions as to how &#x27;good Muslims&#x27; should deal with life&#x27;s injustices&quot;, some TJ members listen.
*In addition, Mumtaz Ahmad notes, its &quot;apolitical stance&quot; has helped reassure Muslim and non-Muslim states, governments and others who put severe restrictions on politically activist Islamic groups; it allows TJ to penetrate and operate in these societies.
* Thus TJ provides &quot;a cover, a conduit and a fertile recruiting ground for jihadi organizations such as Al Qaeda and Lashkar-i-Taiba&quot;. TJ has been said to enable Al-Qaida &quot;by supporting recruitment in radical madrassas and fundraising at mosques all over Pakistan.&quot; Law enforcement officials says that Tablighi Jamaat&#x27;s presence all around the world and its apolitical stance have been exploited by militant groups. A former homeland security employee described Tablighi Jamaat as a &quot;trans-national Islamist network&quot;. According to Alex Alexiev, &quot;perhaps 80% percent of the Islamist extremists have come from Tablighi ranks, prompting French intelligence officers to call Tablighi Jamaat the &#x27;antechamber of fundamentalism.&#x27;&quot;
* In addition, some argue Tablighi Jamaat is not as apolitical as it might first appear. According to Patrick Sukhdeo, TJ is an extremely secretive group and the core of the group does not disclose how it operates. Despite claims of being apolitical, it has ties with the political and military sector of countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The Tablighi Jamaat operates in every sense as a secret society in this country [Britain], as much as elsewhere [...] Its meetings are held behind closed doors. We don&#x27;t know who attends them. How much money it has. It publishes no minutes or accounts. It doesn&#x27;t talk about itself. It is extremely difficult to penetrate.

Some have compared the group&#x27;s ideology to Khawarij whereas others point out that the Tablighi Jamaat takes a &quot;traditionalist&quot; approach to Islam in contrast to Khawarij&#x27;s extremist and often heretical approach.

The Tablighi Jamaat tried to expand the Abbey Mills Mosque into the largest mosque in the United Kingdom. The plan attracted controversy, and the Tabligh was denied permission.

Since 2016, Tableeghi Jamat has functioned as two groups after a bitter division, one led by Maulana Saad Kandhelvi with headquarters in India, and the other led by a collective Shura with headquarters in Punjab, Pakistan and Bangladesh. There have been at least three violent clashes, one in Delhi, India and two in Bangladesh.

=== Bans of the group in different countries ===
Tablighi Jamaat has been banned in Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, Russia and Saudi Arabia. In some Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, where its puritanical preachings are viewed as extremist. In February 2020, a counter-terrorism operation in Russia led to the arrest of seven Tablighis and dismantled the terrorist cell affiliated to the Tablighi Jamaat. According to Russian intelligence, the terrorist cell was involved in dissemination of materials and radicalization. The Tablighi Jamaat has been banned in Russia since 2009. The Supreme Court of Russia also recommended the Tablighi Jamaat to be included into the list of terrorist groups monitored by the Kremlin. On 10 December 2021, Saudi Arabia further warned against Tablighi Jamaat, calling it a &quot;danger to society&quot; and &quot;one of the gates of terrorism&quot;, while all forms of innovated Islamic preaching are already banned in the kingdom. The announcement was made by the country&#x27;s Minister of Islamic Affairs, Abdullatif Al Al-Sheikh. All other Arab countries specifically Gulf Arabic countries including United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman have Tablighi Jamat Maraakez (centres) and many locals are openly involved in Tabligh activity.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

Tablighi Jamaat attracted significant public and media attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==== Malaysia ====

Between 27 February and 1 March 2020, the movement organised an international mass religious gathering at the Masjid Jamek in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The Tablighi Jamaat gathering has been linked to more than 620 COVID-19 cases, making it the largest-known centre of transmission of the virus in Southeast Asia. The Sri Petaling event resulted in the biggest increase in COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, with almost two thirds of the 673 confirmed cases in Malaysia linked to this event by 17 March 2020. Most of the COVID-19 cases in Brunei originated here, and other countries including Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines have traced their cases back to this event. By 20 May 2020, Director-General of Health Noor Hisham Abdullah confirmed that 48% of Malaysia&#x27;s COVID-19 cases (3,347) had been linked to the Sri Petaling tabligh cluster.

==== Indonesia ====

Despite the outbreak, Tablighi Jamaat organised a second international mass gathering on 18 March in Gowa Regency near Makassar in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Though the organisers initially rebuffed official directives to cancel the gathering, they subsequently complied and cancelled the gathering.

==== Pakistan ====

Yet another gathering was organised in Pakistan near Lahore at Raiwind, for 250,000 people. The event was &quot;called off&quot; in response to the officials&#x27; requests, but the participants had already gathered and communed together. When they returned, the virus travelled with them, including two cases in the Gaza strip. During testing, around 40 members of the Tablighi Jamaat were found to be COVID-infected. Another 50 people including four Nigerian women, suspected to be the carriers of the virus were quarantined 50 km from Lahore. In Hyderabad, Sindh, 38 members of the organisation were found to be positive for coronavirus. Raiwind, the place where the event was held has been locked down by Pakistani authorities and the police arrested Tablighi Jamaat members from their offices in Sindh and Punjab for violating the law.

Ninety-four more Tableeghi Jamaat members tested positive for the coronavirus on 31 March 2020 in Hyderabad, in the Sindh province.

==== India ====

The Tablighi Jamaat wanted to arrange the program somewhere in Vasai, Maharashtra. After the outbreak of COVID-19 in Maharashtra, the Government of Maharashtra and Mumbai Police called off the meeting. After the rejection from the Government of Maharashtra, the Nizamuddin faction the Tablighi Jamaat held the religious congregational program (Ijtema) in Nizamuddin West, Delhi. There were also other violation of rules by foreign speakers including misuse of tourist visa for missionary activities and not taking 14-day home quarantine for travellers from abroad.

The Nizamuddin Markaz Mosque added that the officials there&quot;met the Ld. DM and apprised him of the stranded visitors and once again sought permission for the vehicles arranged by us,&quot; to clear the Markaz premises and take the devotees back home.

&quot;Under such compelling circumstances there was no option for Markaz Nizamuddin but to accommodate the stranded visitors with prescribed medical precautions till such time that situation becomes conducive for their movement or arrangements are made by the authorities,&quot; the Tablighi Jamaat HQ said.

On 21 March the Markaz directed everyone &quot;not to venture out until 9 PM as desired by the Prime Minister of India, therefore the plans to move back to their native places by way of means other than railways also did not materialise.&quot;

At least 24 of the attendees had tested positive for the virus among the 300 who showed symptoms by 31 March 2020. It is believed that the sources of infection were preachers from Indonesia. Many had returned to their states and also housed foreign devotees without the knowledge of local governments. and eventually started local transmissions especially in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir and Assam. The entire Nizamuddin West area has been cordoned off by the police as of 30 March, and medical camps have been set up. After evacuation from the markaz, of the scores of jamaat attendees, 167 of them were quarantined in a railway facility in south east Delhi amid concerns over their safety and transmission of the virus. The Tablighi Jamaat gathering emerged as one of India&#x27;s major coronavirus hotspots in India, after 1445 out of 4067 cases were linked to attendees according to the Health Ministry. On 18 April 2020, Central Government said that 4,291 cases (or 29.8% Of the total 14,378 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India) were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat, and these cases were spread across 23 states and Union Territories.

Questions have been raised as to how the Delhi Police, which under direct control of the Union Home Ministry headed by the Home Minister &amp; the then Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah allowed this event to proceed in the midst of a pandemic, while a similar event was prohibited in Mumbai by the Maharashtra Police. Once the COVID lockdown came into effect in Delhi from 22 March onwards, the missionaries remaining in the Nizamuddin Markaz were trapped, and the functionaries began to seek assistance from the authorities for their evacuation. As of 4 April, more than 1000 cases, representing 30% all confirmed cases in India, were linked to the Nizamuddin event. Some 22,000 people that came in contact with the Tablighi Jamaat missionaries had to be quarantined. On 31 March 2020, an FIR was filed against Muhammad Saad Kandhlawi and others by Delhi Police Crime Branch. On 8 April 2020, the Delhi Police traced Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad Kandhalvi in Zakirnagar in South-East Delhi, where he claimed to be under self-quarantine.

People associated with the ruling Hindutva-aligned Bharatiya Janata Party called out Indian Hindus to socially boycott Indian Muslims. This drew criticism from Arab leaders and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation; the Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded: &quot;the virus did not discriminate between people on the basis of faith, community, race or nationality&quot;.

On 12 October 2020, Mumbai court discharged the members with the order stating they didn&#x27;t act negligently to spread COVID and didn&#x27;t disobey to the orders of the Indian authorities.

==Notable members==
The Tablighi Jamaat has no membership lists nor formal procedures for membership, which makes it difficult to quantify and verify affiliations. One of the most famous and popular contemporary leaders of the Tablighi Jamaat is the Pakistani preacher Maulana Tariq Jamil who has amassed a huge online social media following.

The former chief minister of the Pakistani province of Punjab, Pervaiz Elahi is also a strong supporter of the Tablighi Jamaat. During his tenure in 2011, 75 kanals of land (, ) were purchased for a Tablighi Jamaat mosque at the Raiwind Markaz.

In India, Munawar Faruqui, an Indian stand-up comedian, and Sana Khan, an ex-Bollywood star, and Arif Khan, an ex-Bollywood actor, are associated with Jamaat.

The Former Pakistan Presidents- Farooq Leghari and Muhammad Rafiq Tarar were believed to be associated with the movement, the Indian president Dr Zakir Hussain was also affiliated with tabligh jammat

Singers, actors and models, including Attaullah Essa Khailwi, Gulzar Alam, Bacha, Alamzeb Mujahid, and Junaid Jamshed are also affiliated with the movement.

Former Lieutenant General and head of Inter-Services Intelligence Javed Nasir and General Mahmud Ahmed of the Pakistan Army both became members of Tablighi Jamaat during their service. The Tablighi Jamaat also has a notable following among Pakistani professional cricketers: Shahid Afridi, Mohammad (formerly &quot;Youhana&quot;) Yousuf and the former cricketers Saqlain Mushtaq, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mushtaq Ahmed, Saeed Anwar and Saeed Ahmed are active members. Mohammad Yousuf&#x27;s conversion from Christianity to Islam is widely attributed to the influence of the Tabligh Jamaat.

In Malaysia, prominent actors and singers such as Azmil Mustapha, Nabil Ahmad, Aliff Aziz, Anuar Zain, Amar Asyraf, Dato&#x27; Nash and Dr Sam have all been involved with Tablighi Jamaat. One of Malaysia&#x27;s most prominent actress Neelofa, has also participated in Tablighi Jamaat&#x27;s Tours with her husband (PU Riz), as a result of which she now dons the Islamic face veil ever since.

<text>Hrvatski nogometni klub Rijeka (), commonly referred to as HNK Rijeka, is a Croatian professional association football club from the city of Rijeka.

HNK Rijeka competes in Croatia&#x27;s top division, Supersport HNL, of which they have been members since its foundation in 1992. During the reconstruction of Stadion Kantrida, their traditional home ground, they have been based at Stadion Rujevica. Rijeka&#x27;s traditional home colours are all white.

The club was founded in 1904, with the football team being active at last since 1906, and following the tumultuous political changes that swept the border city of Rijeka in the following decades, it changed its name to U.S. Fiumana in 1926, to S.C.F. Quarnero in 1946, to NK Rijeka in 1954, and finally HNK Rijeka in 1995. Rijeka is the third-most successful Croatian football club, having won one Croatian First League title, two Yugoslav Cups, six Croatian Cups, one Croatian Super Cup, Serie C 1940–41, the Italian Federal Cup 1927–28 and the 1977–78 Balkans Cup.

== History ==

=== 1906–1926 ===
The club was founded on the 21st of April 1904 as &quot;Club Sportivo Olimpia&quot; by Antonio Marchich, Aristodemo Susmel, Agesilao Satti, Carlo Colussi, the brothers Romeo and Alessandro Mitrovich during the time Rijeka was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire as a Corpus Separatum of the Hungarian Crown. The club was originally founded as a tennis-lawn, football, swimming, cycling and athletics club. The first official activities of the football section recorded by contemporary chronicles happened on the 25th November 1906, with historians still investigating the football activities in the previous 2,5 years. For lack of better data, this date is currently officially taken as the beginning of HNK Rijeka as a football club. This also makes Rijeka the oldest still active association football club on the territory of today&#x27;s Republic of Croatia.

While many clubs in town and the region often had specific ethnic leanings, Olimpia intentionally had a very international soul, with Italian, Croatian, Hungarian, and German players all playing and working with each other in unison. The oldest line-up known from Rijeka&#x27;s pioneer years was: Duimovic, Smoivar, Penka, Brosnich, R. Mittrovich, Lenardon, Satti, Novodnik, A. Mittrovich, Paulovatz, Cittovich (captain). Initially, the club played its matches on the main Scoglietto square, in front of the local Honved HQ, but moved to Kantrida stadium during the following decade (and the stadium changed its name to Campo Sportivo Olympia). Initially, Olimpia played in black and white garments, but in the 1910s, the club also used a fully white kit.
During the following years, Olimpia will be joined by several other local football clubs from the city of Rijeka and will continue the legacy of Fiumei Atletikai Club as the main city club, when Atletico discontinued its football section in the course of the 1910s. Among the many clubs being founded in town during these years, a side, in particular, will soon rise as fierce arch-rival to Olimpia: &quot;Doria&quot; (later renamed into &quot;CS Gloria&quot;) arose from the proletarian classes and the humble old town dwellers of the industry-rich port town on the Adriatic. While &quot;Olimpia&quot; was associated with the wealthier classes, mostly players from working-class families performed for &quot;Gloria&quot;; therefore, the club found most of its sympathisers among the poorer part of the population. Olimpia was renamed to &quot;Olympia&quot; on 9 January 1918 during a meeting of its board and the new president became the Fiuman writer Antonio de Schlemmer, possibly as an anti-irredentist move. During these years, it achieved its first major local and international successes: it became the champion of the Free State of Fiume championship in 1921, and it won several Julian March and North-Eastern Italian championships in the following years, soon becoming the strongest side in the Alpe-Adria region.

=== 1926–1943 ===
On 2 September 1926, following Mussolini&#x27;s reforms of the FIGC and the 1924 Fiume putsch led by Italian fascists, which brought to the annexation of the independent Free State of Fiume to Italy, Olympia was forced to merge with its arch-rival Gloria into the &quot;Unione Sportiva Fiumana&quot;. Pietro Pasquali was picked as the new president of the club. Two years later, Fiumana won its first national trophy when it reached first place in the Italian Federal Cup. The following season saw the club playing in the Italian Serie A, with some of the biggest Italian clubs such as Ambrosiana (today&#x27;s Inter, also forced into a brand image change by the new regime), Juventus and Napoli played at the Kantrida stadium (renamed to Stadio Borgomarina in those years). Despite a decent performance in Serie A, the city, now impoverished by the annexation and cut off from its natural economic hinterland, was not in the financial position to compete with the biggest cities in Italy and following these successes, the club had to see many of its stars signed by major Italian sides. During most of the 1930s and 1940s, the club competed in the second and third tier of the Italian competitions. At the reopening of a refurbished Kantrida (then renamed Stadio del Littorio) in 1935, Fiumana hosted AS Roma. In June 1941, it became champion of the newly created Italian Serie C.
Serie C&#x27;s last season before the fall of fascist Italy in 1943 saw Fiumana end in third place. Mostly from workers&#x27; families, the players leaned heavily toward the partisan movement, often joining it outright. They didn&#x27;t participate in the Italian Social Republic championships and the Adriatic Littoral championship set up by the German occupational force. Nonetheless, the players kept playing several matches with other local clubs and against sides organised or brought in by the German occupational authorities. Worth mentioning are the excessive celebrations for some victories against the German sides that brought several players to be imprisoned and sent to various concentration camps in Germany, and a last ceremonial game between the old legends of Olympia and Gloria that was held on 15 June 1944 while allied planes were bombing the city&#x27;s surroundings. Most Fiumana players joined the partisan movement and helped the Yugoslav liberation movement, with many ending up in imprisonment and being sent to concentration camps.

=== 1943–1954 ===
Following the liberation of the city from the Nazi occupation and the subsequent occupation by Yugoslav troops, and due to the uncertain future status of the city during the long Paris peace conference, the club resumed its activities in the post-war period under the slightly rebranded name of &quot;Rappresentativa Sindacale Fiumana&quot;. It went on playing several games against the most notable teams of the newly constituted Yugoslav state, beating Dinamo Zagreb 4–2, Akademičar Zagreb 7–2 and Metalac Beograd 2–0. During the interim post-war year, and before the first edition of the Yugoslav First League, R.S. Fiumana played against some of its future Balkan rivals. The authorities also set up an unofficial city tournament among factories named after Fiumana&#x27;s late captain Giovanni Maras, who died heroically in partisan combat on the nearby Mount Risnjak. Despite Maras and most of his colleagues&#x27; partisan allegiance and the many hardships endured by them in Nazi concentration camps, the name Fiumana came soon to be considered too Italian for a city that the Yugoslav occupational authorities were trying to annex by force before the official peace treaty could be signed.

As in most other cities in Yugoslavia, in 1946 the communist authorities established a new identity for the city&#x27;s most representative club in order for it to take part in the upcoming Yugoslav championship and rebranded and restructured the club into Società Cultura Fisica Quarnero (S.C.F. Quarnero), which later added also the bilingual title Sportsko Društvo Kvarner. The new name followed the geographic neutral naming conventions requested to local councils by the central authorities in Belgrade in order to approve the reestablishment of the local sport club activities and to participate in competitions. The initiative came from Ettore Mazzieri, the city&#x27;s sports commissioner for the Yugoslav military administration and a previous Fiumana manager. The first match with the Quarnero identify was played on 7 August 1946, bringing revenge against Hajduk Split for the loss from the previous year. The club began the new course with a resounding 2–0 against the best Yugoslav side of the time. Quarnero initially continued to play in the Fiumana &quot;amaranto&quot; colours, but started switching colours after the first few championships games, and continued appearing with new kits every few matches until season 1957–58. Luigi Sošić and, in particular, Giovanni Cucera took over the role of the first post-war president, shaping the new communist direction of the club. At the same time, all former Fiumana players and staff carried on playing in the renamed club for the next few years before the Italian exodus slowly forced many of them to leave the city after the season 1947–48. As all clubs in Yugoslavia had to transform general sports clubs following the Stalinist model imposed by Belgrade in 1945, S.C.F. Quarnero incorporated 11 other sections in addition to football, including boxing, fencing, basketball and tennis. The international tennis champion Orlando Sirola started his career at the club before his exile.

The authorities in Belgrade soon decided that Rijeka&#x27;s club should be invited to participate in the first Yugoslav First League in 1946–47 as an external guest, representing the occupied Zone B of the Julian March region, but only after a play-off with the Pula-based club Unione Sportiva Operaia. When the city of Rijeka was assigned to Yugoslavia in February 1947, and Tito broke all ties with Stalin in 1948, most Yugoslav clubs underwent a further re-organisation. Thus, in 1948, Quarnero became once again an all-football club, and the name was also modified into &quot;Società Calcio Quarnero – Nogometni Klub Kvarner&quot;. During the early period playing in Yugoslavia&#x27;s competitions, Kvarner reached moderate success in various national and local leagues. Still, the club was relegated at the end of their inaugural season in the Yugoslav First League in 1946–47 due to a purely political decision to favour Ponziana, after Quarnero had already secured its stay in the first league during the season. Upon securing Rijeka for Yugoslavia, the Belgrade authorities were now trying to pander to Trieste&#x27;s residents through sport in the hope of annexing also that city to Yugoslavia.

The club continued to play with mixed results in Yugoslav football&#x27;s second and third divisions. The club achieved mediocre results over the next ten years, concurrently with Rijeka&#x27;s autochthonous population slowly leaving hometown over the years. Consequently, the club lost many of its best players because many opted to leave Yugoslavia and move overseas.

In 1954, following rising ethnic tensions around the Trieste Crisis and the subsequent elimination of all forms of bilingualism in the city, paired with a desire to have a brand more recognizable and associated the club was further renamed into &quot;NK Rijeka&quot;.

=== 1954–1991 ===

Given the political interferences in the club&#x27;s life and the continuous mistreatment of ethnic Italians, many of Quarnero&#x27;s best players were forced to join the Fiuman exodus, and the club lingered between the second and third tier of the Yugoslav competition for the next several years. Following new Italian-Yugoslav tensions that arose during the Trieste Crisis, and the subsequent &quot;de facto&quot; abolition of the city&#x27;s full bilingual rights by the communist authorities in Belgrade, the club changed its name once again, into the now completely monolingual &quot;NK Rijeka&quot; (Rijeka Football Club) on 2 July 1954, giving up onto the Italian language in its brand image for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. Rijeka started to use a white kit for the second time in its history in a match in Šibenik in the 1957–58 second league season. During the previous seasons, the kit colours were constantly changing, depending on what was available to the management at any given time and what the sponsors could offer. The main kit remained white since. Rijeka returned to the First League in 1958 and remained in the top tier for 11 consecutive seasons until 1969, when it got relegated once again to the Yugoslav Second League. Despite finishing at the top in four (out of five) seasons of the second league, due to three failed promotion play-off attempts, the club only gained promotion back to the top tier in 1974. Rijeka remained in the top tier until the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, with varying but improving results.

The club&#x27;s greatest successes during this period are two Yugoslav Cup titles in 1978 and 1979 and a runner-up finish in 1987, when Rijeka lost the final in the penalty shoot-out. The club never managed to finish the season higher than fourth place in the Yugoslav First League. In 1984, the club came closest to a Yugoslav championship title, finishing only two points behind Red Star Belgrade. Rijeka were also the best placed Croatian club in the Yugoslav First League in 1965, 1984 and 1987.

=== 1991–present ===

Following the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1992, Rijeka joined the Croatian First Football League in its inaugural season. In 1995, the club changed its name to &quot;HNK Rijeka&quot;, adding the prefix &quot;Croatian&quot; to its name, following the example of many other clubs during the Croatian War for Independence. Today, Rijeka remains one of only four founding member clubs of the HNL to have never been relegated and is regarded as one of the country&#x27;s top three clubs. Since the Croatian independence, the club won its first-ever league title in 2017, ending Dinamo Zagreb&#x27;s run of 11 consecutive titles, and was a runner-up eight times. Rijeka has also won six Croatian Cups, including back-to-back titles in 2005 and 2006 and most recently in 2019 and 2020. The club also won the cup in 2014 and in 2017, which helped them secure a historic Double in that year.

A refereeing error denied Rijeka their first championship title in the final round of the 1998–99 season. With one match to play, Rijeka was one point ahead of Croatia Zagreb, needing a home win against Osijek to secure the title. With the match tied at 1–1, in the 89th minute, Rijeka forward Admir Hasančić converted a cross by Barnabás Sztipánovics. However, moments later, assistant referee Krečak raised his flag, and referee Šupraha disallowed Rijeka&#x27;s winning goal for an alleged offside. Following an investigation, 3D analysis revealed Hasančić was not, in fact, in an offside position, and that Rijeka was wrongfully denied their first championship title. An investigation by &quot;Nacional&quot; revealed Franjo Tuđman, the president of the Republic of Croatia and an ardent Croatia Zagreb supporter, earlier in 1999 ordered the country&#x27;s intelligence agencies to spy on football referees, officials and journalists, to ensure the Zagreb club wins the league title.

=== HNK Rijeka in the European competitions ===
Rijeka participated in UEFA competitions on 24 occasions, including 12 consecutive appearances since 2013–14. The greatest success was the quarter-final of the 1979–80 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where they lost to Italian giants Juventus 2–0 on aggregate. The most memorable result in Europe was the home win (3–1) against eventual winners Real Madrid in the 1984–85 UEFA Cup. Controversially, in the return leg at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, which Rijeka lost 3–0, three of their players were sent off. Madrid scored their first goal from a dubious penalty in the 67th minute with Rijeka already down to ten men. Over the next ten minutes, two additional Rijeka players were sent off, most notably Damir Desnica. While Desnica received the first yellow card because he did not stop play after Schoeters blew his whistle, the second yellow was issued because he allegedly insulted the referee. However, unbeknownst to the referee, Desnica had been a deaf-mute since birth. With Rijeka reduced to eight players, Madrid scored two additional goals, progressed to the next round and eventually won the trophy.

In 2013, after winning 4–3 on aggregate against VfB Stuttgart, Rijeka qualified for the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League group stage. Rijeka also participated in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League group stage, where they defeated Feyenoord and Standard Liège and drew with title-holders and eventual winners Sevilla. In 2017, Rijeka reached the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League play-off, where they lost 3–1 on aggregate to Greek champions Olympiacos, and automatically qualified for the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League group stage. In the group stage, they recorded a famous home win (2–0) against AC Milan. In 2020–21 Rijeka reached the group stages of the Europa League for the fourth time in eight years but once again failed to progress to the knockout stages. In 2021–22, 2023–24 and 2024–25, Rijeka was eliminated in the play-off round of UEFA Conference League.

=== Private ownership ===
In February 2012, Gabriele Volpi – an Italian businessman and the founder of Orlean Invest, as well as the owner of football club Spezia and water polo club Pro Recco – injected much-needed capital into the club. With the privatization process complete by September 2013, Volpi, through Dutch-based Stichting Social Sport Foundation, owned 70% of the club, with the City of Rijeka in control of the remaining 30%. On 29 December 2017 it was announced that chairman Damir Mišković, through London-based Teanna Limited, acquired the majority stake in the club from Stichting Social Sport Foundation.

=== Record transfers ===
In January 2015, Rijeka sold their star striker Andrej Kramarić to Leicester City for a club-record £9.7 million transfer fee.

== Stadium ==

The club initially played at the Honved training field in front of today&#x27;s Popular University of Rijeka in the central &quot;Scoglietto&quot; suburb of Rijeka. During the 1920s, the club was allowed to build a new and, at the time, modern facility in Scoglietto, and toward the end of the decade, it started using Stadion Kantrida as its primary field, naming it &quot;Campo Sportivo Olympia&quot;. Kantrida was the club&#x27;s traditional home ground for over 95 years (with a short hiatus between 1947 and 1951 due to refurbishing) until July 2015. Since August 2015, Rijeka has been based at the newly built Stadion Rujevica, a modern all-seater with a capacity of 8,279. Stadion Rujevica is part of Rijeka&#x27;s new training centre and is the club&#x27;s temporary home ground. Following the club&#x27;s move to Rujevica, plans emerged to build a new, state-of-the-art, all-seater Stadion Kantrida. The project was on hold for close to a decade as the club was seeking funding and co-investors to make the project viable. In December 2023, plans were unveiled that, in addition to the stadium, investors plan to build a commercial complex, which may include three residential highrise towers and a hotel, with a total cost exceeding €100 million. The new Kantrida stadium will be located at the previous location but rotated 90 degrees from the previously proposed location, facing north–south. The facility is designed to accommodate 12,000 to 14,000 spectators and will meet UEFA&#x27;s fourth-category standards.

== Support ==
Rijeka&#x27;s ultras group is called &quot;Armada Rijeka&quot;, or simply Armada. The group has been active since 1987, but some forms of organised (albeit not registered as associations) support were present and following the club already in the decades before, with the earliest reported in the 1920s.

During most home matches, the majority of the seats are occupied by season ticket holders. For the 2023–24 season, the club has more than 6,200 season ticket holders and 15,300 members.

== Rivalries ==

Rijeka&#x27;s greatest rivalry nowadays is with Hajduk Split. Since 1946, the Adriatic derby has been contested between the two most popular Croatian football clubs from the Adriatic coast, Rijeka and Hajduk. Other rivalries exist with other major clubs in Croatia Dinamo Zagreb and a milder with Osijek. The primary regional derby is with Istra Pula. The origins of the Rijeka–Pula rivalry date back to the clashes between Fiumana and Grion Pola since the late 1920s. The city derby with Orijent is probably the oldest, with its roots in the clashes between CS Olimpia and CS Gloria against Orijent and the other more successful in those early years Sušak-based club, Victoria.

<text>Dag the Wise or Dagr spaki was a mythological Swedish king of the House of Ynglings (dated to the 4th century by 16th-century historiographer Johannes Magnus). He was the son of Dyggvi, the former king. According to legend, he could understand the speech of birds and had a sparrow that gathered news for him from many lands. When the bird was killed on one of these trips, Dag invaded Reidgotaland (considering the date and location, apparently Gothiscandza), in order to avenge it. There he was ambushed by a thrall and killed.

The earliest two versions based on &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, i.e. &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; and &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; (see below) say that Dag was succeeded by his sons Alrekr and Eírikr who in their turn were succeeded by Dag&#x27;s grandson Agne (in &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; incorrectly called &quot;Hogne&quot;):

&quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;:
&quot;Íslendingabók&quot; only lists the line of succession: &quot;x Dyggvi. xi Dagr. xii Alrekr. xiii Agni. xiiii Yngvi&quot;&quot;.

However, in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Snorri Sturluson gives Agne as Dag&#x27;s son and successor, and the two brothers Alrekr and Eiríkr as his grandsons.

This is what Snorri tells of Dag:


Then Snorri quoted &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; (9th century):
The fact that &quot;Skjótansvað&quot;/&quot;Vápnavað&quot; appear both in &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; and in &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;&#x27;s earlier summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; but not in Snorri&#x27;s later quotation from it, suggests that all of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; was not presented by him.

<doc id="896132" wikidata="Q2355703" url="?curid=896132" title="Fiona Ma">
<text>Fiona Ma (born March 4, 1966) is an American politician and accountant. She has been serving as the California state treasurer since January 7, 2019. She previously was a member of the California Board of Equalization (2015–2019), the California State Assembly (2006–2012), and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors (2002–2006).

A member of the Democratic Party, Ma was the first Asian American woman to serve as California Assembly Speaker Pro Tempore, the second highest-ranking office in the California Assembly. Ma is also only the second Certified Public Accountant (CPA) to be elected to the Board of Equalization. She was selected as Chairperson of the California Board of Equalization in 2016, and ordered three external audits of the agency.

In March 2019, Ma announced she would run for the 2026 California gubernatorial election. In March 2023, she announced that she would be running for the 2026 California lieutenant gubernatorial election instead.

==Early life and education==
Ma is the oldest of three children born to William and Sophia Ma, both Chinese immigrants. Her grandfather, Lieutenant General , was the first mayor of Kunming, Yunnan and is of Bai ethnicity.

Born and raised in New York, she attended Baker Elementary School before graduating from Great Neck North Middle and High Schools. Her father, William Ma, was a mechanical engineer who later specialized in construction claims and litigation before he retired. Her mother, Sophia (née Doo), was a high school art teacher for 20 years before moving the family to San Francisco to be closer to her parents. Rev William Doo was posted as a minister at the San Francisco Swatow Christian Church in San Francisco&#x27;s Sunset District.

Ma earned a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting from Rochester Institute of Technology, a Master of Science in taxation from Golden Gate University, and a Master of Business Administration from Pepperdine University. She is a CPA.

== Career ==
Ma is an active member of the California Society of Certified Public Accountants (CalCPA), Governmental Accounting Standards Advisory Council (GASAC). Additionally, she is a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) and had a small role in the short film My Name Is Moe.

Ma was appointed to the Assessment Appeals Board of San Francisco by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1995. That same year, she was a part-time district representative for then-State Senator John Burton. She served as Burton&#x27;s district representative until her election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 2002. She was responsible for helping constituents with Medi-Cal, Workers&#x27; Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, Franchise and Employment Development Department taxes, and professional licensing.

=== San Francisco Board of Supervisors ===
Ma was later elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from 2002 to 2006 representing District 4, the Sunset District, Outer Sunset, Parkside, Outer Parkside, and Pine Lake Park. While serving on that board, her legislative focus was a campaign to shut down massage parlors claimed to traffic persons into the country and use them for prostitution. As a Supervisor, she also started her advocacy regarding banning some chemicals from children&#x27;s toys - passing an ordinance to &quot;prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of any toy or child-care article…if it contains bisphenol-A or other specified chemicals.&quot;
=== California Assembly ===
Ma was elected to represent California&#x27;s 12th Assembly District (including San Francisco, Daly City, Colma and Broadmoor) from November 2006 to November 2012, serving the maximum of three terms.

Ma won the Democratic nomination in that district against fellow Democrat Janet Reilly in the state primary election of June 6, 2006. The campaign was one of the more expensive legislative primary races in the state.

On November 7, 2006, Ma received 70 percent of the vote (as expected for Democratic candidates to partisan offices).

Ma was appointed Assembly majority whip by the speaker of the assembly, Fabian Núñez, a position which she held for 4 years. In 2010, Speaker of the Assembly John Pérez appointed Ma to the position of Speaker pro Tempore, a position which she held for her final 2 years as the California Assembly.

As an assemblywoman, Ma continued her work around safety in children&#x27;s toys, writing legislation banning chemicals in products for babies and small children. The bill became law in October 2007 and took effect in January 2009. Ma&#x27;s legislation was later incorporated into Senator Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 enacted on August 15, 2008.

==== Committee membership ====
=== California Board of Equalization ===
On November 4, 2014, Ma won election to district 2 of the California State Board of Equalization. She received 1,448,657 votes, or 68.5% of the vote. District 2 covers nearly 10 million people along California&#x27;s coastline from Oregon to Santa Barbara. On, February 24, 2016, the Board selected Ma as its chair. As chair, Ma also sits on the California Franchise Tax Board.

=== California state treasurer ===

On May 17, 2016, Ma announced she was opening her campaign to run for California treasurer in the 2018 election. On June 5, 2018, she finished first in the nonpartisan open primary, and then defeated Republican Greg Conlon in the November 6 election. On January 7, 2019, she was sworn in as the first woman of color and the second CPA to ever serve as California State Treasurer.

==== Head banker and strengthening state finances ====
In her first year in office, Wall Street&#x27;s Fitch Ratings and Moody&#x27;s upgraded California&#x27;s general obligation bonds, citing improved fiscal management, and stating California&#x27;s budget reserves had &quot;never been stronger&quot;. Ma stated her goal to help create &quot;lower borrowing costs, a favorable interest rate environment, improved ratings, and a continued commitment to building reserves&quot;. In the first quarter of 2019, Ma sold more bonds than any other state treasurer in America, including a different bond issuance almost every week during March and April. From July to December 2019, her office sold an additional $7.65 billion of bonds. In November 2019, the nonpartisan California Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office reported on the Treasurer&#x27;s cost-cutting impact stating: &quot;the State Treasurer has been able to refinance much of the state&#x27;s bond debt. Consequently, much of the state&#x27;s outstanding debt now carries a lower interest rate resulting in lower annual costs.&quot;
Overall in 2019, Ma&#x27;s office oversaw $85 billion in bonds and $85 billion to $100 billion (an all-time high) in short term investments. &quot;I believe in checks and balances, accountability and also being proactive,&quot; Ma told Bloomberg news. Ma&#x27;s priorities for California&#x27;s bond program include:
* Refinancing bonds at a lower interest rate
* Allocating bonds to affordable and low cost housing
* Environmentally focussed bonds
* Broadening efforts to include women, minority and veteran-owned broker-dealer firms to manage bond issuances
* helping local city governments to manage their finances soundly
* statewide infrastructure projects and voter approved bonds such as clean water and high-speed rail.

==== Green financing and environmental policy ====
Ma chaired the inaugural meeting of the California Green Bond Market Development Committee on June 5, 2019 to &quot;establish California as the world&#x27;s green bond leader&quot; by developing standards for what qualifies as green bonds, and incorporating green bonds into the financing of state infrastructure projects.
Ma launched the Small Business Energy Efficiency Financing and the Affordable Multifamily Energy Efficiency Financing programs in October 2019 to help small business, nonprofits and affordable housing owners to reduce the cost of financing energy efficiency improvements. She also co-sponsored the California Recycling Market Development Act to promote California&#x27;s recycling programs, AB 1583 authored by Assemblymember Susan Eggman and signed in to law by Governor Newsom.
Ma also chairs the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA), which assists the state in meeting its greenhouse gas goals and works with the private market. CAEATFA operates the CA Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing Program, which has provided more than $825 million in sales tax exclusions for over 200 green projects that support solar manufacturing, geothermal, renewable fuels, and biogas production. Ma also chairs the California Pollution Control Financing Authority (CPCFA), providing $16.2 billion in low-cost financing. CPCFA was the first statewide financing authority to sign the Green Bond Pledge, vowing to meet climate bond principles in all of its projects. In December 2020, Ma&#x27;s office enrolled the 1,000th loan of the Residential Energy Efficiency Loan Program, to a Yuba County homeowner to install a highly efficient HVAC and smart thermostat.

==== Affordable housing ====
Ma&#x27;s office oversees private activity bonds and state housing tax credits that are used to build and maintain low-income housing and keep rents in these units affordable for 55 years. In 2019, her office sold over $180 million of bonds for the California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) program to provide affordable loans to veterans. 
Ma also sold $500 million (in 2019) and $450 million (in 2020) in revenue bonds for California&#x27;s No Place Like Home (NPLH) program, an effort to develop permanent supportive housing for homeless and mentally ill people. This &quot;social bond,&quot; to fund projects that produce positive social outcomes, won the Bond Buyer Magazine&#x27;s Deal of the Year award in 2020.
In September 2020, Ma released policy reports on affordable housing for community college students, working with the Southern California Association of Non-Profit Housing. With the California School Finance Authority (CSFA), Ma&#x27;s office issued $87 million in bonds to build 352 beds for Santa Rosa Junior College.
In October 2020, the CTCAC chaired by Ma approved $91 million in tax credits for 2,846 units of low-income housing in counties heavily damaged by the Camp, Tubbs, Thomas, and Mendocino Complex wildfires in 2017 and 2018.

==== Protecting families, consumers and small business ====
In June 2019, Ma announced the launch of the CalSavers Retirement Savings Program, which offers an IRA retirement savings option to employees who don&#x27;t currently have one through their employer.

In 2019, the &quot;Scholar Dollars&quot; program as part of ScholarShare 529 awarded more than $300,000 to 20 K-8 California public schools to fund technology, music, art, theater, computer science, sports, and other programs. In 2020, Ma sponsored a law to protect ScholarShare 529 accounts from being seized by debt collectors.

As part of Governor Gavin Newsom&#x27;s Master Plan for Aging, Ma co-sponsored three bills addressing the needs of older adults, people with disabilities and family caregivers: AB 1287 (Nazarian), AB 1382 (Aguiar-Curry), and SB 611(Cabellero). In 2019, the Treasurer Office&#x27;s CalABLE program was expanded to allow anyone with a disability diagnosed before the age of 26 to
open up an account and save up to $15,000 a year.

In 2020, as part of the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (iBank), Ma began administering the California Rebuilding Fund, a new public-private partnership to support California&#x27;s small businesses. The fund is part of the California Governor&#x27;s Office of Economic Development.

==== High-speed rail ====
In her first year as treasurer, Ma appointed Dr Beverly Scott, adjunct professor at the Mineta Transportation Institute of San Jose State University, and Frederick Jordan, president of Bay Area construction company F.E. Jordan Associates Inc, to the California High-Speed Rail Peer Review Group. Ma also provided support to the SoCal-to-Las Vegas Brightline West high-speed rail project connecting Southern California and Las Vegas, Nevada when she announced approval of a $300 million bond issuance for the project.

==== Cannabis banking ====
In 2019, Ma sponsored SB 51, by Senator Majority Leader Bob Hertzberg, to allow private banks and credit unions to apply for state licensing which would allow licensed cannabis-related businesses to open accounts and deposit income.

==== Collecting sales tax revenue from Amazon ====
On April 25, 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation that Ma had pushed to require out-of-state and online retailers like eBay, Etsy, and Amazon (company) to collect sales taxes in line with the practices of local California businesses, eliminating an unfair advantage that Amazon and other out-of-state and online businesses had claimed.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
During the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 2020, all Ma&#x27;s operations were considered essential services and kept fully-open and operational. Ma&#x27;s office and agencies she chaired took the following actions:
* assembled resources for taxpayer relief, food sources for needy families, and financial resources for small business. 
* Extended deadlines for business for the CalSavers retirement program and supported Governor Newsom and the State Franchise Tax Board in extending deadlines for California tax returns.
* Launched $5 million emergency loan program for hospitals and health facilities in small, rural and district communities.
* Increased bond money available to build additional 4,054 units of affordable housing including the first housing to target LGBT elders in the Davis region.
* Pushed forward on $600 million in bonds for the Southern California to Las Vegas high speed rail project including 1,250 workforce housing units, 30,000 construction jobs and 1,000 permanent jobs.
In May 2020, Ma began operating the COVID-19 Emergency HELP Loan Program to provide financial assistance to health facilities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

By May 2020, California had spent $2.2 billion on safety gear to prevent coronavirus infection. No-bid contracts were used because of the emergency and unprecedented need for personal protective equipment. The state&#x27;s standard purchasing processes were disrupted and Ma&#x27;s office, which normally just carries out final stages of financial transactions, took on an oversight role.

==== 2023 Writers Guild of America strike ====

On August 30, 2023, Ma sent letters to Netflix, The Walt Disney Company, Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery Channel, Apple Inc., Paramount Global and Amazon, telling them to return to negotiations and settle the strikes.

===Accusations of impropriety===
In summer of 2021, a former staffer filed a civil rights complaint against Ma, alleging sexual harassment and wrongful termination for declining the harassing behavior. In court filings, Judith Blackwell complained that Ma created a hostile work environment by making overt and unwanted advances while the two shared a hotel room on work trips. Such behavior included exposing her bare rear end to Blackwell on multiple occasions. Ma also gave Blackwell many gifts, such as jewelry, a prime parking spot and marijuana edibles, up until the time she was fired according to Politico. Ma is also accused of accepting inappropriate gifts.

Ma had also shared hotel rooms 13 times with her chief of staff over a two-year period. And while the practice of sharing rooms with subordinates does not violate departmental policy, the situation was criticized. Ma has denied any wrongdoing in her defense against Blackwell and said the sharing of hotel rooms was a cost-saving measure.

== Personal life ==
She is married to Jason Hodge, a Ventura County firefighter of Native American descent and an Oxnard Port Commissioner with the Port of Hueneme in Ventura County.

== Electoral history ==
==Political positions==

=== Business taxes ===
A priority for Ma while on the Board of Equalization was to get everyone to pay &quot;their fair share of taxes&quot;, particularly &quot;the $8 billion in unpaid taxes in the underground economy.&quot; This included efforts to get Amazon to collect sales tax on transactions from third-party sellers as a way of helping local brick-and-mortar retailers to compete – estimated at between $431 million and $1.8 billion in new revenue for California every year.
In her first year, Ma also advocated for e-cigarettes to be taxed like tobacco products, as a way to deter vaping and smoking, and to pay for health-costs caused by tobacco use. Two years later in 2017, voters passed Prop. 56 with a nearly 2/3 majority, collecting $1.7 billion in new tobacco taxes which was spent on anti-smoking programs and funding Medi-Cal payments for the poor.
Ma also identified the cannabis industry as &quot;the largest shadow economy in California&quot; with &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars that disappear into an underground cannabis economy&quot;.

=== Tax relief for citizens and small business ===
After 2015&#x27;s Valley Fire, Ma proposed a new law (enacted the following year) that granted some tax relief to businesses that suffer losses from a natural disaster like the Valley Fire. 
Ma has also actively supported California&#x27;s Earned Income Tax Credit to give cash back to low-income individuals, and promoted expansion of the program to minimum wage earners and independent contractors.

=== Clean government reforms ===
Within months of joining the Board of Equalization, Ma became &quot;very, very frustrated&quot; with the agency&#x27;s fiscal conditions and mishandling of state tax accounts. She initiated three external audits of the agency. The audits exposed a culture of mismanagement, nepotism and political use of state resources. Ma co-sponsored legislation to toughen campaign reporting requirements for BOE members. She then led the effort to ask the Governor to appoint a public trustee to take over the agency, and called on CA Attorney General Xavier Becerra to assign independent legal counsel for the agency. Ma laid out a list of reforms which was incorporated into the &quot;Taxpayer Transparency and Fairness Act of 2017&quot;, the biggest restructuring of the Board of Equalization in its 138-year history. The law was signed by Governor Jerry Brown in June 2017 and supported by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, Senate President Kevin de León, and former BOE member Controller Betty Yee.

=== Women and diversity ===
In 2016, she received Emerge California&#x27;s Woman of the Year Award and was a speaker at the Ascend Conference, the largest non-profit Pan-Asian business conference in America. Among her many other activities, Ma also celebrated Women&#x27;s Equality Day at the Kelley House in Mendocino and spoke to students at the Future Chinese Leaders of America in Los Angeles.

=== Requiring consent to plastinate a corpse ===
On February 23, 2007, Ma introduced a bill requiring commercial exhibitors of plastinated corpses to obtain a county permit, which would be dependent on proof of consent from the decedent or next of kin. It passed the Senate on August 15, 2008 and was vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on September 26, citing a budget delay.

=== Banning toxic chemicals ===
Ma has passed legislation banning some chemicals in plastics and children&#x27;s toys. As a Supervisor in San Francisco, she authored and passed an ordinance to &quot;prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of any toy or child-care article…if it contains bisphenol-A or other specified chemicals.&quot; As a California State Legislator she passed a similar bill. This language was later used by Senator Dianne Feinstein in the federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law in 2008.

<doc id="896135" wikidata="Q170040" url="?curid=896135" title="FC Rubin Kazan">
<text>FC Rubin Kazan (; ) is a Russian professional football club based in the city of Kazan. They play in the Russian Premier League. Founded in 1958, Rubin played its first-ever top flight season in 2003. It has remained there through the 2021–22 season, winning the Russian Premier League championship in 2008 and 2009. After one season in the second tier, the club returned to the RPL for the 2023–24 season. The club also won the 2011–12 Russian Cup. The team plays in the Ak Bars Arena.

==History==
FC Rubin Kazan was previously called Iskra from 1958 to 1964 and Rubin-TAN from 1992 to 1993. The name &quot;Rubin&quot; means &quot;Ruby&quot;.

Having never played in the Soviet Top League, the football club joined the Russian First Division in 1992 and fell to the Russian Second Division in 1994. The mayor of Kazan at the time, Kamil Iskhakov, purchased the team in 1996. Rubin won the Second Division in 1997 and was promoted back to the First Division the following season. The next four seasons, the team finished above 8th place. Finally winning the title in 2002, Rubin was promoted to the Russian Premier League for the first time in 2003. Rubin finished third in its debut season to qualify for the UEFA Cup. The team faced a setback in the 2004 campaign finishing in 10th place, but 2005 saw them finish fourth, again qualifying the team for the UEFA Cup.

===The Flower of Sentyabrev&#x27;s Epoch (1958–1965)===

The year of 1958 came, and the team formed a part of Class B of the USSR Championship, because of successful performances and the Class B expanding. The debut was on 20 April in Kherson. The team lost to local &quot;Spartak&quot; 2–4. In 1958 &quot;Iskra&quot; took 14th place.

In 1959 &quot;Iskra&quot; was headed by a 50-year-old specialist Nikolay Sentyabrev. Within the next 12 years the post of a head coach of the team was occupied.

The 1960 season was even more successful. After the first round having only one defeat from &quot;Zvezda&quot; (Perm) the kazanners were among the leaders of the zone. But during the second half &quot;Iskra&quot; improved and finished 4th.

In 1960, Tsentralnyi stadium was founded. On 21 August 1960 &quot;Iskra&quot; played a debut game in a new arena against Metallurg (Kamensk-Uralsky) – 2–1.

In 1961 the kazanners again spent the strong first half of the championship and looked much worse in the second round. The gap from the leaders was one point. That year &quot;Iskra&quot; made its way to the last 16 of the USSR Cup, where it lost a rematch to Dynamo (Moscow). In 1962 and 1963 the kazanners took traditional 3rd place.

The year of 1964 became the turning-point. Unsuccessful start of the championship was compensated with 15 matches without a loss in a row at the finish. As a result – second position in the zone and an ability to continue struggle for Class A entrance. But the final round was unfortunate at this time.

During the off-season the club&#x27;s name was changed to Rubin. In decisive game against &quot;Sokol&quot; (Saratov) &quot;Rubin&quot; has won 2–1 (Teterkin, Golubev) and got a ticket to Class A first time in its history. &quot;Rubin&quot; returned to Kazan with silver medals.

===The End of Sentyabrev&#x27;s Epoch (1966–1971)===

Season 1966 was due to answer the question whether Rubin, a newcomer of Class A, was able to gain a foothold and to survive a competition with more experienced clubs. Club coaches counted on the footballers succeeded in the previous year. First three games were played away. After a zero draw in Batumi and a loss from &quot;Kuban&quot; in Krasnodar the kazanners gained revenge from &quot;Spartak&quot; in Nalchik for the loss in the final of 1965. 2–1 – that was the first win in Class A.

Kazan had to wait for the grand opening of the season until May, 2. That day 22,000 spectators greeted the win over &quot;Dynamo&quot; from Kirovabad. In the final table &quot;Rubin&quot; stands at the honorable 5th position.

Next year of 1967 considerable changes happened in the squad. The leaders of last years Fomin, Golubev and Novichkov finished to play for the team. &quot;Rubin&quot; had to start forming the middle line from the beginning.

A the final standings &quot;Rubin&quot; has raised its position if to compare with the previous season, it was the 4th position. In USSR Cup the kazanners succeeded in achieving final, where they lost to &quot;Chornomorets&quot; (Odesa) – 1–3. Next year of 1968 Kazan club reduced its positions – the 5th place, but some noticeable events occurred during the season.

In the season of 1969 &quot;Rubin&quot; was close to change the Second Group of Class A for the First one. At the Second Stage &quot;Rubin&quot; in one point left behind the winner – &quot;SKA&quot; (Khabarovsk). And the team repeated the success of 1967, reached final of USSR Cup, where has lost to &quot;Sudostroitel&quot; Nikolaev at the extra-time.

In 1970 the structure of the football tournament was modified. United First League was made, and 22 best-of-1969 teams were included.

On a legal ground &quot;Rubin&quot; took his place among them. The debut was April, 11 in Krasnodar (0–1). After that an outdoor draw followed in Kharkov with &quot;Metallist&quot; – 1–1, Viktor Kolotov scored the first goal in the First league. Later followed several wins. In the season-1970 &quot;Rubin&quot; resulted at the 8th position. Hard times came. The season of 1971 the team finished at the last 22nd position and has left the First league.

===White line, black line (1972–1977)===

In 1972 &quot;Rubin&quot; has been participating in the 5th zone of the Second League, which included mainly clubs of Povolzhye and Middle Asia. During the whole season the kazanners experienced serious problems in the attack. Frankly speaking, after the 21nd matchday the team had only 14 goals scored (5 of them were annulled because 2 teams has left the tournament). In the last game of the year &quot;Rubin&quot; has beat &quot;Torpedo&quot; from Togliatii 1–0 and took the 7th place and left the opponent on the 8th one.

The season of 1973 was to be more successful. After a year&#x27;s interval Murad Zadikashvili has returned from Kutaisi. Three clubs has started to change each other in the top of the league in the struggle for the only ticket to the Semifinal tournament. These teams were &quot;Uralmash&quot; (Sverdlovsk), &quot;Rubin&quot; and &quot;Kord&quot; from Balakovo. Kazanners were the second ones at the final lap. &quot;Uralmash&quot; had just 3 points more. In RSFSR Cup, which was held as an alternative to USSR Cup, &quot;Rubin&quot; reached Semi-final (the club&#x27;s best result in this tournament), where lost 0–1 to &quot;Vulkan&quot; (Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky) in an outdoor game.
That year (1973) on May, 1 a 24-year-old masseur Eugeny Golov started to work in &quot;Rubin&quot;. From that moment &quot;Rubin&quot; has become an integral part of his life. He had passed all steps of a club hierarchy: masseur – doctor – administrator – first president (since 1990) – director (1995–99 and since 2005).

Before the season of 1974 &quot;Rubin&quot; has practically lost no players of a senior squad. In the final table &quot;Rubin&quot; was the 2nd. In a stubborn struggle kazanners could stand up for this position in a semi-final pellet in Frunze and in a final in Sochi. As a result – an overall 2nd place in the Second League and a pass to the First League.

In 1975 the team was headed by Boris Batanov from &quot;Torpedo&quot; (Moscow), a specialist with a name, indeed, he had a success only as a footballer. After the first half of the year &quot;Rubin&quot; was 17th, and Batanov has left a captain&#x27;s bridge, which was occupied by Yuri Markov again. Kazanners took 13 points in last 8 games and finished on 11th position.

The beginning of 1976 has encouraged. However, after that 21 matches without any win followed. As a result – the 17th place and a difficultly saved registration in the First League.

In 1977 an attempt to renew a team was undertaken. Result was the last 20th place.

===The times of stagnation (1978–1991)===

In 1978, the organizers of the competitions have identified &quot;Rubin&quot; in internationalist 4th zone, where in addition to Russian clubs were 13 teams of three republics – Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Kazan started poorly, taking on a long Georgian-Armenian exit, which consisted of 6 matches, only 2 points. But slowly the team began to build momentum, and, eventually, ended the season in 6th place.

In the season of 1979 Kazan set anti-record – 19th place in the second league. During the season in 23 guest matches had been won only 1 game.

In 1980, instead of Aleksei Alekseevich Beryuchevskogo, who led the &quot;Rubin&quot; in two previous seasons, to the post of head coach came Valeriy Salnikov. To the end of the season Kazan came in 10th place, and again left without a head coach.

The next attempt to find a suitable mentor for the team finally succeeded in 1981. Credibility, which was enough for the next 7 years (with a break in 1983–84), get Vladimir Mikhailov, in past well-known football player of Moscow Torpedo. In the final table in 1981, Rubin was in 5th place.

In the next in 1982 an attempt was made to win in the zone. In a bitter struggle with Chelyabinsk &quot;Lokomotiv&quot; Kazan in the end gave the first line to the Ural team. Vadim Popov scored 24 goals, updating the club record for the season. Season-1983 did not become a logical continuation of the 1982th, only a 5th place in the zone. In 1984, Rubin participated even worse. With the transfer Vadim Popov to Omsk Irtysh in the attack appeared unsolvable problems. Toothless team action in the attack was partly offset confident playing defensive line, led by Kikhtenko and Martynov, so Rubin could not fall below 10th place.

The game in attack was fixed in season 1985, when to the team came Vladimir Gavrilov, best scorer of &quot;Rubin&quot; in its history. His scoring quality Gavrilov showed in the season-1986, when with 27 balls he became the best scorer of the second league. We can only guess how things would have developed for &quot;Rubin&quot; in the next 1987, if Gavrilov stays in the team. But he decided to try his strength in the first league and moved to the Voronezh &quot;Fakel&quot;, and when in autumn after the injury he returned to Kazan, the fans saw on the field only a pale shadow of a formidable striker.

Two of the final season of 80-ths did not bring positive emotions. Moving up did not work, and Rubin began to sink lower and lower on the standings. In 1988, the team score points, mainly due to competently organized games in the defensive by the coach Alexei Alexandrovich Semyonov, who replaced Mikhailov.

At the end of the season-1989, which Kazan finished on 12th place, to the post of head coach of &quot;Rubin&quot; came one of the oldest and most respected football coaches of the country, honored trainer of Russia – Ivan Zolotukhin. &quot; Grandfather&quot; – respectfully called Zolotukhin players and fans.

In 1990, before the team set the goal – to get into the &quot;buffer&quot; league (intermediate between the first and second), for which it was necessary to take place not less than the second. After a magnificent season, Kazan scored equal points with Togliatti &quot;Lada&quot; and gave her a second line due to a smaller number of victories. The following season, &quot;Rubin&quot; make up for all the previous failures. During the Championship from Moscow came a striker Sergei Surov, who together with Vladimir Gavrilov and 20-year-old Oleg Nechaev for three scored 44 goals, making the most formidable line of attack in the zone. Most of all got &quot;EVM&quot; from Ruzayevka, which Kazan scored seven unanswered goals (the biggest victory of the &quot;Rubin&quot; in the championships of the USSR). As a result, the first round Rubin passed without a single defeat. Unbeaten run was interrupted only in the 32 round, but by the time Kazan was unequivocal leader of the tournament. To finish of the championship in 1991, Rubin came first, finishing with dignity &quot;Soviet&quot; phase of its history.

===A step away from total collapse (1992–1995)===

After the collapse of the Soviet Union broke up into separate tournaments and the championship of the Union. The result is that instead of the union &quot;buffer&quot; league &quot;Rubin&quot; was the first league of first Championship of Russia. In season 1992, it consisted of three territorial zones. Kazan had been included in the central.

In winter, from Moscow came the tragic news – on 13 February died Ivan Zolotukhin.

After Zolotukhin a head coach of Rubin became Alexander Ivchenko, previously worked with Omsk Irtysh. In the off-season left the team: Kalachev Igor, Sergei Surov and who decided to continue a career in Poland, Vladimir Gavrilov. Ivchenko brought from Omsk scorer Marat Mulasheva and midfielder Sergei Osipov, came from the Kirov technically Moiseev.

The first game in the championship of Russia on 25 April Rubin lost to Metallurg Magnitogorsk (0–1). Then, in Bashkortostan got its first victory – over Gastello from Ufa, the only goal scored Vadim Potapov. In Kazan, the fans saw their team on 6 May, when in a double-edged uncompromising struggle was beaten Chelyabinsk &quot;Zenit&quot; (3–2). FC Rubin Kazan during the season was in the area 5–7 positions. The leadership in the area immediately took KAMAZ, which in the end got the only ticket to the major league.

In 1993, &quot;Rubin&quot; got a task to take in the tournament of central zone of the first league place no lower than seventh. The reason for this was that from next season the best in the championship-93 teams of three zones were to form a single first league (the current first division), in which representatives from the central zone were &quot;booked&quot; 7 vacancies.

Shortly after the start of the championship refused to finance the team its chief sponsor CAPO Gorbunov. In June, recently approved in the position of head coach Victor Avraamovich Lukashenko left &quot;Rubin&quot;. The new coach became Mourad Vahtangovich Zadikashvili. Difficult financial situation was fixed after selling in Volgograd &quot;Rotor&quot; team leaders Oleg Nechaev and Rustem Khuzin (but soon returned to &quot;Rubin&quot; till the end of the season on loan). In the end the season Kazan finished on 8th place, only losing a point to Nizhnekamsk &quot;Neftechimik&quot; and dropped into the second league.

The following year, 1994, coaches Zadikashvili and Semenov assemble a team literally bit by bit. Because of the continuing financial problems from the last season in the team left only 6 players: Grishin, Danilin, Ravil, Blagov, Tatarkin and Kamkov, the rest went to other clubs. Rubin had to resort to the services of veterans and young students of urban football. At the beginning of the season, the first time in the history of the club did there was no money to go to the next game in Gorodishe and Volzhski. As a consequence, two technical defeat of 0–3 and a warning that in case of repeated failure to appear, the team will be disqualified from the tournament. Later, Kazan for the third time staying at home, this time ignoring Tula. Fortunately, and for this act &quot;Rubin&quot; was not disqualified from the championship. One of the key games of the season took place on 2 October in Yoshkar-Ola. 5 minutes before the final whistle, the only goal was scored by our captain, Rubin Ravil, thereby leaving the local &quot;Druzhba&quot; in last place. Residence in the second division was maintained.

In the off-season club finally &quot;divorced&quot; with CAPO Gorbunov and was dependent only on the city. Resolution of the head of administration of Kazan on 13 March 1995 No. 276 were registered municipal institution &quot;Football Club Rubin&quot;.

Already during the tournament-1995 in the club there were personnel changes. Instead of a retired Zadikashvili came to the team Vladimir Borisovich Saveliev and Oleg Flegontov, who became head coach, respectively, and the director of the team. Due to intense activity guideline &quot;tandem&quot; Golov-Flegontov, in a short time managed to attract to the team several good level players, who helped the club does not fall lower rank. Only in the final round of the championship determined the fourth failure, who left the second league (with the other three all was clear much earlier). It became &quot;Torpedo&quot; from Pavlov. It had a point less than Rubin.

Kazan team, at the last moment managed to jump off the footboard of the train going to the third league.

===Recovering lost ground (1996–2002)===
The turning point in the modern history of Rubin Kazan came in 1996, when the patron of the club, Kamil Iskhakrov, became the mayor of Kazan, and helped to improve the financial health of the club. In addition, he set up a two-part goal for the club: to first advance to the first league, and then to the Premier League. With the club finances in order, Rubin Kazan were able to prepare for the season under more relaxed circumstances. As head coach, the experienced Igor Volchok was hired; he too devoted himself to the goal set out by Iskharov. Eighteen new players came to Rubin Kazan, including some who had played for the club previously: Sergey Moiseyev, Rashid Zainutdinov, and Oleg Mironov. In addition, two skilled forwards joined the proceedings: Vladimir Pantyushenko and Rustam Zabirov. The result was that Rubin Kazan finished in 6th place in 1996.

In the following year, 1997, the goal to reach the first league became more complicated through the fact that, according to the rules, only one club from the central zone of the second league could qualify. For this year, Rubin Kazin was strengthened by the return of some of its best players: Sergei Kharlamov, Rustem Bulatov, Airat Ahmetgaliev, Rustem Khuzin. Valery Aleskarov from Nizhnekamsk performed duties as goalkeeper, and Andrey Knyazev from Magnitogorsk played at the top. Having taken the lead in their zone after the third round, the club went on to soldify its position and were actually able to finish first, scoring 102 points out of 120 possible. Thus, the goal of returning the club to the first division was fulfilled. Furthermore, adding to the success of the club in this season, Rubin Kazan managed to win 13 games in a row. Andrey Knyazev was the best scorer of the season, scoring 30 goals (25 of them in the championship). The 1997 season is also notable for Rubin Kazan in that it was the first time in 22 years that the club had a reserve team.

Rubin Kazan went on to excel in the Cup of Russia in 1997–98. First, they beat Fakel Voronej, then Lokomotive Nizhniy Novgorod, and then Arsenal from Tula. In the game against Tula, a goal by Airat Ahmetgaliev became decisive, as it was scored only two minutes before the end of the match, delighting the 15,000 fans in the Tsentralny stadium. Later in 1998, Volchok retired as head coach, and was replaced by Alexander Sergeyevich Irkhin, although he would only last for the remainder of the season. In the first division championship of this year, Rubin Kazan finished in 7th place.

In December 1998, one of Russia&#x27;s most acclaimed coaches, Pavel Sadyrin took over training duties from Irkhin. He too, however, would only stay for one contract year, enjoying little success with Rubin Kazan, which again finished in 7th place in the 1999 season. In order to fulfil with ambition of playing in the top division of the Russianc championship, Victor Petrovich Antihovich was hired for the 2000 season. At this point, fifteen players left the team, four of which moved into top division clubs: Okroshidze, Bulatov, and Lysenko transferred to CSKA Sennikov, while Khuzin went to Amkar Perm. During the 2000 season, Saratov &quot;Sokol&quot; was the clear favorite for the 1st place, while Rubin Kazin struggled with Torpedo-ZIL for the second qualifying slot to the top division. In a dramatic meeting at the end of the season, Kazan was in 3td place, behind Torpedo by only two points.

The 2001 season did not begin well for Rubin Kazan. As a consequence, there was another change of coaches, as Antihovic was replaced by Kurban Bekievich Berdiyev from Smolensk Kristall. Under his leadership, the club finished the season in 8th place. In the following year, a number of qualified players with experience from the top division were invited to the club: David Chaladze, Gennady Semin, Michail Sinev, and Andrei Konovalov. Overall, the season was a great success, with the club winning 22 of 34 games, and only suffering six defeats. Striker David Chaladze tied with Vyacheslav Kamoltsev for the title of best scorer; both scored 20 goals. Chaladze became the third player in the club&#x27;s history to scoring four goals in one game, in the match against Krasnoyarsk Metallurg.

===2003–2005===

2003 saw great changes in Rubin Kazan, as a result of the arrival of a large number of foreign players, including MacBeth Sibaya, Pape Kebe, Andrés Scotti, Tomáš Čížek, and Jiří Novotný. The season began with a defeat against CSKA Moscow. This was followed by the team&#x27;s first victory in a difficult game against Torpedo-Metallurg. Victories at home over Torpedo Moscow (3–1) and Spartak Moscow (1–0) pulled the club up to a mid-table position. This was followed by 10 matches without defeat, which took Kazan to second place. Fortune changed quickly when a serious injury to goalkeeper Sergei Kozko led to a losing streak. After a home defeat to Zenit St. Petersburg, Rubin dropped to 5th place. Winning the last 3 games of the season — against Krylia Sovetov, Torpedo-Metallurg and reigning champions CSKA Moscow — Rubin Kazan unexpectedly snatched third place.

In 2004 Rubin began on an optimistic note. Almost nobody left the team, and incoming transfers looked promising. The first victory in the 2005 season came only in the 8th round over Spartak (2–0). It allowed Rubin to leave the last place. Then Kazan managed to climb in the standings, but 7 games without a win once again led Rubin in the danger zone, out of which the team managed to climb only due to a good finish of the season. Tenth place, of course, was seen as a failure after the excellent 2003 season. The UEFA Cup ended in the third round, after a 2–0 away victory Rubin lost their home match 0–3.

===2006–2009===

In 2006, Rubin had a new president when the head of the club became Alexander P. Gusev, who replaced Kamil Iskhakov. The team did well enough in the Russian Premier League to take part in European cup competitions. In August Rubin the second time in its history played in UEFA Cup. In the second qualifying round Kazan easily passed Belarusian BATE Borisov (3–0 at home and 2–0 away). The next stage Kazan lost to Parma from Italy (both matches 0–1). Russian Championship Rubin finished on fifth position, which allowed it to play next season in Intertoto Cup.

In the 2007 season, again there was a major refurbishment of the team. Rubin added a number of players, but many players left the team before 2008, due to the poor performance of the team: 10th position in the championship of Russia and the defeat in UEFA Intertoto Cup by old rivals Rapid Vienna. The season was further marred by the death of defender Lenar Gilmullin, a Kazan native who played for the first team.

In 2008, Rubin won the league championship to qualify for the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League Group stage, making them the easternmost team to play in the competition. Their championship season began with a league record seven consecutive wins, including victories against defending champions Zenit St. Petersburg. Rubin clinched its first championship in club history and became only the third club from outside Moscow to win the Russian Premier League (after Spartak-Alania Vladikavkaz and Zenit St. Petersburg).

On 20 October 2009, Rubin recorded an upset over Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League by winning 2–1 at Camp Nou. This was followed by a 0–0 draw at home two weeks, also against Barcelona. On 21 November 2009, Rubin secured a 0–0 draw against Zenit St. Petersburg to win the Russian Premier League championship for the second season in a row.

===2009 controversy===
In September 2009, Rubin were the unknowing participants in a bizarre transfer saga involving four Levski Sofia players (Zhivko Milanov, Youssef Rabeh, Darko Tasevski and Zé Soares). The Bulgarian champions received a fax, supposedly from the Kazan team, offering to buy the footballers. The quoted sum was €7 million. On 20 September 2009, the four players, accompanied by a Levski representative, travelled to Moscow to undergo a medical examination, but the deal fell through, as the phony Rubin representative offered lower salaries than those originally agreed. Official Rubin representatives denied any knowledge of the whole affair, maintaining that they knew nothing about the players in question. It turned out that Levski had fallen victims to fraudsters. It is thought that the incident was masterminded to defraud bookmakers by placing large bets against Levski in their derby match against city rivals CSKA Sofia.

===Cups successes (2009–2012)===

In 2010 Kazan Team started the year with the victory in &quot;Commonwealth of Independent States Cup&quot;. In this tournament &quot;Rubin&quot; was presented by Junior team led by Yuri Utkulbayev. In the final Kazan team beat FC Aktobe, the champion of Kazakhstan with the score 5–2. In March &quot;Rubin&quot; won the Russian Super Cup for the first time. In the frosty &quot;Luzhniki&quot; Kazan team won CSKA with the score 1–0.

On UEFA Champions League 2010–11 &quot;Rubin&quot; got once again in the group with the great team of European football &quot;Barcelona&quot;. The score of the match in Kazan was 1–1. On the return match Catalan Club won with the score 2–0. The victory in the home match with Copenhagen and 3 draws gave a chance to take the 3rd place in the group and had a UEFA Europa League&#x27;s qualification for Round of 32, where Kazan team lost to FC Twente from the Netherlands (0–2 and 2–2).

In 2010 &quot;Rubin&quot; took the 3rd place in Russian Championship, so that was the second bronze medal in the history of &quot;Rubin&quot;. Due to the mentioned &quot;Rubin&quot; got a chance to start in UEFA Europa League for the third time, this time from the Qualification Round. There &quot;Rubin&quot; knocked out one of the strongest clubs of East Europe, &quot;Dynamo Kyiv&quot; with the score 2–0 and 2–1, but after &quot;Rubin&quot; lost to French &quot;Lyon&quot; (1–3 and 1–1) and went to UEFA Europa League. In the second most prestigious European club football tournament Kazan team took the second place in the group and reached the Round of 32, where &quot;Rubin&quot; lost to Greek &quot;Olympiacos&quot; (0–1 and 0–1).

In the end of May 2012 there were the new changes at the management of the club. Dmitry Samarenkin, the president of the club, left his post. By the decision of the Supervisory Board Valery Sorokin was appointed to the position. In summer there was another assignment, Andrey Gromov was appointed to the position of Director General. In July &quot;Rubin&quot; in the match for Russian Super Cup won &quot;Zenit&quot; from Saint Petersburg with the score 2–0 and became the trophy winner.

In the first match of the championship, Rubin defeated Kuban in Krasnodar, with a score of 2–0. Goals were scored by Alan Kasaev and Christian Noboa. The second round was held in Kazan Terek Grozny, with Rubin again winning 2–0. Goals: Gökdeniz Karadeniz and Christian Noboa. In the third round in Makhachkala Rubin lost to local Anji. In the fourth round a match against Spartak Nalchik ended in a draw. In the fifth round, Rubin suffered a major defeat by CSKA Moscow 2–0. In the sixth round Rubin played against Amkar Perm to a draw, 1–1, with the only Rubin goal scored by Alexander Ryazantsev. An Amkar player helped the Rubin Captain Roman Sharonov cut the ball into his own net. In the seventh round there was another draw in Samara playing against Krylya Sovetov, with a
score of 2–2. In the eighth round, Rubin faced Premier League newcomers FC Krasnodar at home, the score of 2–1 was in favor of Kazan: two goals for Rubin scored by Gökdeniz Karadeniz, while Roman Sharonov again scored an own goal.

===2012–2022===
On 18 October 2018, the club was banned by UEFA for one year from participating in European competition due to FFP violations. The club did not qualify for either the 2019–20 season or 2020–21 season of the Champions League or Europa League and therefore, the ban expired. On 19 December 2019, Leonid Viktorovich Slutsky became head coach of Rubin.

<text>In Norse mythology, Dyggvi or Dyggve (Old Norse &quot;Useful, Effective&quot;) was a Swedish king of the House of Ynglings. Dyggvi died and became the concubine of Hel, Loki&#x27;s daughter. Dyggvi was succeeded by his son Dag the Wise. According to Snorri Sturluson, Dyggvi was the nephew of Dan, the eponymous ancestor of Denmark, through his sister Drott, and was the first to be called King by his family.

==Attestations==
Snorri Sturluson wrote of Dygvvi&#x27;s father Domar in his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; (1225):

About Dyggvi&#x27;s mother Snorri had more to say:

In his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Snorri Sturluson included a piece from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; composed in the 9th century:

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation:

The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; also cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and it also gives Dyggvi as the successor of Dómarr and the predecessor of Dagr: &quot;ix Dómarr. x Dyggvi. xi Dagr&quot;.

<doc id="896148" wikidata="Q267574" url="?curid=896148" title="Aalborg Boldspilklub">
<text>Aalborg Boldspilklub is a Danish sports club based in the city of Aalborg. The club is also known as AaB for short (cf. logo) or Aalborg BK. Through time the club has had branches in cricket, tennis, ice hockey, handball, and basketball, but currently controls teams in football, American football, and floorball. All teams are competing in the top-flight Danish league in their respective sport. The kit sponsor for the club is Adidas, and the principal sponsor for the football team is the regional bank Spar Nord.

AaB was founded on 13 May 1885 by English engineers who were building Jutland&#x27;s railway system, and the first years was concentrated on the game of cricket. It was initially named &quot;Aalborg Cricketklub&quot; (Aalborg Cricket club) but the name of the club was changed to &quot;Aalborg Boldklub&quot; (Aalborg ballclub) in 1899. Football was adopted on an amateur basis in 1902, and has since been the main sport, as the name was changed to the current &quot;Aalborg Boldspilklub af 1885&quot; (Aalborg Ball Game Club of 1885) in 1906.

== Sections ==

=== Professional ===
==== Football ====

The club established a men&#x27;s football team in 1902. The team has been a part of the Danish Superliga championship since 1987, winning four championships in 1995, 1999, 2008 and in 2014. As well as three Danish cups in 1966, 1970 and 2014.

AaB became the first Danish team ever to participate in the UEFA Champions League Group Stage in 1995. AaB also qualified for the 2008–09 Champions League and qualified for the UEFA Cup in the same season after a 3rd-place finish in their Champions League group.

====Handball====

Handball was adopted by AaB in 2003, when the local men&#x27;s team Aalborg HSH was bought and renamed &quot;AaB Håndbold&quot; (AaB handball). Since then, the club has played in the Danish top-flight handball league, though they have never won the league title. In May 2007, AaB published the plans to take over the women&#x27;s handball team of Aalborg DH, as a part of the AaB Håndbold brand, as Aalborg DH did not pass a due diligence test, the takeover was never completed. With the expanded handball section, the men&#x27;s team have moved their games to Aalborg DH&#x27;s venue, Gigantium Arena. AaB Håndbold was owned by AaB A/S until January 2011. In January 2011 the license was given to the new company &quot;Aalborg Håndbold A/S&quot;.

====Ice hockey====

AaB also owned the professional ice hockey team AaB Ishockey, formed by the merger of AaB Ishockey and IK Aalborgwhich, and affiliated with the amateur youth development of Aalborg Ishockey Klub (AIK). AaB Ishockey won the 1981 Danish championship. From 2004 to 2007, AaB Ishockey won four silver medals in a row.

AaB Ishockey ceased operations at the end of the 2011/2012 season, replaced by the Aalborg Pirates.

<doc id="896153" wikidata="Q3034674" url="?curid=896153" title="Domar">
<text>In Norse mythology, the Swedish king Domar (Old Norse &quot;Dómarr&quot;, &quot;Judge&quot;) of the House of Ynglings was the son of Domalde. He was married to Drott, the sister of Dan the Arrogant who gave his names to the Danes. Drott and Dan are in this work said to be the children of Danp son of Ríg.

His rule lasted long and after the sacrifice of his father Domalde, the crops were plentiful and peace reigned. Consequently, there is not much to tell about his reign, and when he died at Uppsala, he was transported over the Fyris Wolds (Fyrisvellir) and burnt on the banks of the river, where a stone was raised over his ashes.

He was succeeded by his son Dyggvi.

==Attestations==
Snorri Sturluson wrote of Domar in his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; (1225):

The information about Domar&#x27;s marriage appears after Snorri has presented Domar&#x27;s son Dyggvi (Danish tongue refers to the Old Norse language as a whole and not only to the dialect of Denmark):

As for Domar, Snorri included a piece from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; (9th century):

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation:

The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and also gives Dómarr as the successor of Dómaldr and the predecessor of Dyggvi: &quot;viii Dómaldr. ix Dómarr. x Dyggvi&quot;.

<doc id="896157" wikidata="Q2715224" url="?curid=896157" title="Dan (king)">
<text>Dan (or [[Halfdan the Old|Halfdan]]) is the name of one or more of the legendary earliest kings of the Danes and Denmark, as mentioned in medieval Scandinavian texts.

==The &quot;Lejre Chronicle&quot;==
The &quot;Chronicle of Lejre&quot; (&quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;), written around 1170, introduces a primeval King Ypper of Uppsala, whose three sons were Dan, who later ruled Denmark; Nori, who later ruled Norway; and Østen, who later ruled the Swedes. Dan apparently first ruled in Zealand, as the Chronicle states that it was when he saved his people from an attack by Emperor Augustus that the Jutes and the men of Fyn and Scania also accepted him as king. Consequently, the resulting expanded country of Denmark was named after him. Dan&#x27;s wife was named Dana, and his son was named Ro.
==The &quot;Rígsthula&quot;== 
The Eddic poem &quot;Rígsthula&quot; tells how the god Ríg (said to be Heimdall) fathered a mortal son named Jarl. Jarl had twelve sons with Erna Herse&#x27;s daughter, the youngest of whom was named Kon the Young (Old Norse &quot;Konr Ungr&quot;). This name is understood to be the origin of the title &quot;konungr&quot; (&#x27;king&#x27;), although the etymology is, in fact, untenable. One day, while hunting and snaring birds in the forest, a crow spoke to him and suggested that he would gain more by going after men, praising the wealth of &quot;Dan and Danp.&quot; The poem breaks off incomplete at that point.

==The &quot;Skjöldungasaga&quot;==
According to Arngrímur Jónsson&#x27;s Latin epitome of the lost &quot;Skjöldungasaga,&quot; made in 1597:

Ríg (Rigus) was a man not the least among the great ones of his time. He married the daughter of a certain Danp [Old Norse &quot;Danpr&quot;], lord of Danpsted, whose name was Dana; and later, having won the royal title for his province, left as his heir his son by Dana, called Dan or Danum, all of whose subjects were called Danes.

This tradition is similar to that of the &quot;Rígsthula&quot;.

This Dan married Olof, the daughter of Wermund, and thus became brother-in-law to Offa of Angel, mentioned in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Dan initially ruled in Jutland but later conquered Zealand from King Aleif, creating the kingdom of Denmark.

==Ynglinga saga==
Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; relates the story of King Dygvi of Sweden:

Dygvi&#x27;s mother was Drótt, a daughter of King Danp, the son of Ríg, who was first called &quot;konungr&quot; [&#x27;king&#x27;] in the Danish tongue [(Old Norse)]. His descendants always afterwards considered the title of &quot;konungr&quot; the title of highest dignity. Dygvi was the first of his family to be called &quot;konungr&quot;, for his predecessors had been called &quot;dróttinn&quot; [&#x27;chieftain&#x27;], and their wives &quot;dróttning&quot;, and their court &quot;drótt&quot; [&#x27;war band&#x27;]. Each of their race was called Yngvi, or Ynguni, and the whole race together Ynglingar. Queen Drótt was a sister of King Dan Mikilláti, from whom Denmark took its name.

Here, Ríg is the father of Danp, who is the father of Dan. The title &quot;Mikilláti&quot; can be translated as &#x27;Magnificent&#x27; or &#x27;Proud&#x27;.

Snorri does not clarify whether this Dan is also descended from King Fridfrodi, or Peace-Fróði, whom Snorri presents as ruling in Zealand as a contemporary of Fjölnir, son of Frey, six generations before King Dygvi. Snorri writes further:

In the time when the kings we have been speaking of were in Uppsala, Denmark had been ruled over by Dan Mikilláti, who lived to a very great age; then by his son, Fróði Mikilláti, or the Peace-loving, who was succeeded by his sons Halfdan and Fridleif, who were great warriors.

This peaceful Fróði appears to be a duplicate of the earlier Fróði.

In his preface to the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; (which includes the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;), Snorri writes:

The Age of Cairns began properly in Denmark after Dan Mikilláti had raised for himself a burial cairn, and ordered that he should be buried in it on his death, with his royal ornaments and armour, his horse and saddle-furniture, and other valuable goods; and many of his descendants followed his example. But the burning of the dead continued, long after that time, to be the custom of the Swedes and Northmen.

==Sven Aagesen==
In his &quot;Brevis historia regum Dacie&quot;, the 12th-century historian Sven Aagesen mentions Danu Elatus, &#x27;the Proud,&#x27; presumably Dan Mikilláti, and makes him the successor to Uffi, that is, Offa, son of Wermund, thus agreeing with the &quot;Skjöldungasaga&quot;. He states that this Dan was such a powerful king that he had another king as his page and two nobles to hold his horse.
==The &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==

Saxo Grammaticus, in his &quot;Gesta Danorum,&quot; presents three different Danish monarchs named Dan, either splitting a single monarch into multiple figures or properly distinguishing those whom others have confused.

Saxo begins his history with two brothers named Dan and Angul, sons of one Humbli, who were made rulers by the consent of the people because of their bravery. However, they were not referred to as &#x27;kings,&#x27; as that usage was not common at the time.

Angul is the eponym of the region of Angul, and from his people eventually came the English, who gave their name to England. Dan fathered two sons, Humblus and Lotherus, by his wife Grytha.

Neither son is otherwise known, although a king named Humli is a leader of the Huns in the Old Norse &quot;Battle of the Goths and Huns&quot;. Lotherus may have some relation to the Norse god Lóðurr or to the exiled king Heremod mentioned in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, or possibly to both. According to Saxo, Lotherus is the father of the famous hero Skioldus.

The second king called Dan appears much later in Book 4 as the son of Uffi, son of Vermund (that is, Offa of Angel, son of Wermund). However, Saxo mentions him only briefly, describing him as a warlike king who scorned his subjects and squandered his wealth, having greatly degenerated from his ancestors.

He is succeeded by King Huglek, followed by Fróði the Active, and then by the third Dan. Saxo does not specifically provide the parentage of any of these kings. Of this Dan, Saxo recounts only an anecdote: when Dan was twelve years old and tired of the arrogance of Saxon ambassadors who demanded tribute under the threat of war, he bridged the river Elbe with ships, crossed over, and won a great victory.

This Dan is the father of Fridlef, who is the father of Frothi. In this lineage, one can recognize Fridleif and his son Fróði, both of whom are often mentioned in Norse sources. The latter, at least by parentage, is the Peace-Fróði introduced by Snorri early in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;.
==The Song of Eric==
The &#x27;Song of Eric&#x27; was once considered a valuable source for Migration Period history but is now regarded as inauthentic fakelore created during the 16th century.

The ballad deals with Eric, the first king of Geatland (&quot;fyrsti konunger i Götalandinu vidha&quot;). He sent a troop of Geats southward to a country named Vetala, where no one had yet cultivated the land. Accompanying them was a wise man who was to uphold the law. Eventually, a king named Humli appointed his son Dan to rule the settlers, and after Dan, Vetala was named &quot;Denmark&quot;.

The song was first published in a Latin translation in Johannes Magnus&#x27;s &quot;Historia de omnibus gothorum sueonumque regibus&quot; (1554). He states that the original song was widely sung in Sweden at that time.

<text>Domalde, &quot;Dómaldi&quot; or &quot;Dómaldr&quot; (Old Norse possibly &quot;Power to Judge&quot;) was a legendary Swedish king of the House of Ynglings, cursed by his stepmother, according to Snorri Sturluson, with &quot;ósgæssa&quot;, &quot;ill-luck&quot;. He was the son of Visbur.

==Attestations==

The luck of the king is the luck of the land, and Domalde&#x27;s rule was marked by bad crops and starvation. The first autumn, the Swedes sacrificed oxen at the temple at Uppsala, but the next harvest was not better. The second autumn, they sacrificed men, but the following crops were even worse.

The third year many Swedes arrived at Gamla Uppsala at the Thing of all Swedes and the chiefs decided they had to sacrifice the king. They sprinkled the statues of the gods with his blood (see Blót) and the good harvests returned.

He was succeeded by his son Domar whose reign was prosperous.

Snorri Sturluson wrote of Domalde in his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; (1225):

Snorri included a piece from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; (9th century) in his account in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;:

:Translation: ‘It happened earlier that the sword-bearers [WARRIORS] reddened the ground with [the blood of] their leader. And the army of the land bore bloody weapons away from the lifeless Dómaldi when the race of the Swedes, eager for good harvests, had to sacrifice the enemy of the Jótar [= Dómaldi].’

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation:

The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and also gives Dómaldr as the successor of Visburr and the predecessor of Dómarr: &quot;vii Visburr. viii Dómaldr. ix Dómarr&quot;.
