<text>Bruno Alfred Döblin (; 10 August 1878 – 26 June 1957) was a German novelist, essayist, and doctor, best known for his novel &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; (1929). A prolific writer whose œuvre spans more than half a century and a wide variety of literary movements and styles, Döblin is one of the most important figures of German literary modernism. His complete works comprise over a dozen novels ranging in genre from historical novels to science fiction to novels about the modern metropolis; several dramas, radio plays, and screenplays; a true crime story; a travel account; two book-length philosophical treatises; scores of essays on politics, religion, art, and society; and numerous letters—his complete works, republished by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag and Fischer Verlag, span more than thirty volumes. His first published novel, &quot;Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lung&quot; (&quot;The Three Leaps of Wang Lun&quot;), appeared in 1915 and his final novel, &quot;Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende&quot; (&quot;Tales of a Long Night&quot;) was published in 1956, one year before his death.

Born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), to assimilated Jews, Döblin moved with his mother and siblings to Berlin when he was ten years old after his father had abandoned them. Döblin would live in Berlin for almost all of the next forty-five years, engaging with such key figures of the prewar and Weimar-era German cultural scene as Herwarth Walden and the circle of Expressionists, Bertolt Brecht, and Thomas Mann. Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;, Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the Nazi dictatorship. Works by Döblin were also considered &quot;Asphalt literature&quot;. He spent 1933–1940 in France and then was forced to flee again at the start of the Second World War. Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in Los Angeles, where he converted to Catholicism. He moved to West Germany after the war but did not feel at home in postwar Germany&#x27;s conservative cultural climate and returned to France. His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties, and his literary work was met with relative neglect.

Despite the canonic status of &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;, Döblin is often characterized as an under-recognized or even as a forgotten author; while his work has received increasing critical attention (mostly in German) over the last few decades, he is much less well known by the reading public than other German novelists such as Thomas Mann, Günter Grass or Franz Kafka.

==Life==

===Early life===
Bruno Alfred Döblin was born on 10 August 1878 at the house at Bollwerk 37 in Stettin (Szczecin), a port city in what was then the Province of Pomerania. He was the fourth of five children born to Max Döblin (1846–1921), a master tailor from Posen (Poznań), and Sophie Döblin (1844–1920), née Freudenheim, the daughter of a merchant. His older brother was actor Hugo Döblin. His parents&#x27; marriage was characterized by a tension between Max&#x27;s multifaceted artistic interests—to which Döblin would later attribute his and his siblings&#x27; artistic inclinations—and Sophie&#x27;s cool pragmatism. The Döblins were assimilated Jews, and Alfred became aware of a broad, societal anti-Semitism early on.

His parents&#x27; marriage dissolved in July 1888, when Max Döblin eloped with Henriette Zander, a seamstress twenty years his junior, and moved to America to start a new life. The catastrophic loss of his father was a central event in Döblin&#x27;s childhood and would be formative for his later life. Shortly thereafter, in October 1888, Sophie and the five children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small shabby apartment on the Blumenstraße in Berlin&#x27;s working-class east. Döblin&#x27;s parents briefly reconciled in 1889, when Max returned penniless from America; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889, but when it came to light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life, Sophie and the children returned to Berlin in September 1889.

The sense of being déclassé, along with rocky experiences at school, made this a difficult time for Döblin. Although he had early been a good student, starting in his fourth year of &quot;Gymnasium&quot; his performance tended toward the mediocre. Furthermore, his oppositional tendencies against the stern conventionality of the patriarchal, militaristic Wilhelminian educational system, which stood in contrast to his artistic inclinations and his free thought, earned him the status of a rebel among his teachers. Despite his hatred for school, Döblin early became a passionate writer and reader, counting Spinoza, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, as well as Heinrich von Kleist, Friedrich Hölderlin, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky among his most important early influences. He wrote his first novel, &quot;Jagende Rosse&quot; (&quot;Rushing Steeds&quot;), before completing school and dedicated it to the &quot;Manes of Hölderlin&quot;. He sent a copy to the prominent critic and philosopher Fritz Mauthner who returned it a few days later. However, wishing to hide his artistic inclinations from his mother, Döblin had sent the manuscript under a false name, and was not able to retrieve it at the post office; he thus had to rewrite it entirely.

===1900–1914: University years and early career===

After receiving his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1900, Döblin enrolled at Friedrich Wilhelm University (now Humboldt University of Berlin) and began studying general medicine. In May 1904 he moved to Freiburg im Breisgau to continue his studies, concentrating on neurology and psychiatry. He began his dissertation (&quot;Disturbances of memory in Korsakoff&#x27;s Psychosis&quot;) in the winter semester of 1904–1905 at the Freiburg psychiatric clinic. His dissertation, completed in April 1905, was published that year by Berlin&#x27;s Klett Verlag. He applied for assistantships in Berlin and in Stettin, where he was apparently turned down on account of his Jewish origins, before taking a short-lived position as assistant doctor at a regional asylum in Regensburg. On 15 October 1906 he took up a position at the Berlin psychiatric clinic in Buch where he worked as an assistant doctor for nearly two years. He then transferred to the city hospital &quot;Am Urban,&quot; where he dedicated himself to internal medicine with a renewed interest. He opened his first private practice in October 1911 at Blücherstrasse 18 in Berlin&#x27;s Kreuzberg neighborhood, before moving the practice to Frankfurter Allee 184 in Berlin&#x27;s working-class east.
While working in Buch he met Friede Kunke, a 16-year-old nurse from a Protestant background with whom he became romantically involved. In the spring of 1909 he began seeing the 21-year-old Erna Reiss, a medical student and daughter of a wealthy Jewish factory owner. Despite his continued involvement with Kunke, at the urging of his family he was reluctantly engaged to Reiss on 13 February 1911 and married her on 23 January 1912; his older brother Hugo and Herwarth Walden served as best men. During the early part of his engagement to Reiss, he had been unaware that Kunke was pregnant: their son Bodo was born on 14 October 1911 and was raised by his grandmother, Elise Kunke, in Schleswig-Holstein following Friede&#x27;s death from tuberculosis in 1918. Until the end of his life, Döblin maintained loose contact with Bodo, and his treatment of Friede became a lasting source of guilt. Döblin&#x27;s first son with Erna Reiss, Peter Döblin, was born on 27 October 1912, and was baptized a Protestant. Peter later attended Schule am Meer, where he was registered as such.
During his studies in Berlin, Döblin had written his second novel, &quot;Der Schwarze Vorhang&quot; (&quot;The Black Curtain&quot;). The novel portrays the developing sexuality of its protagonist, Johannes, and explores the themes of love, hate, and sadism; in its use of literary montage, &quot;The Black Curtain&quot; already presages the radical techniques that Döblin would later pioneer in &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;. Introduced by a mutual acquaintance, Döblin met Georg Lewin, a music student better known as Herwarth Walden, who founded the Expressionist journal &quot;Der Sturm&quot; in 1910. &quot;Der Sturm&quot;, modeled after Karl Kraus&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Die Fackel&quot; (&quot;The Torch&quot;), would soon count Döblin among its most involved contributors, and provided him with a venue for the publication of numerous literary and essayistic contributions. Through Walden Döblin made the acquaintance of poet Else Lasker-Schüler. At regular meetings at the Café des Westens on Kurfürstendamm or at the wine bar Dalbelli, Döblin got to know the circle of artists and intellectuals that would become central to the Expressionist movement in Berlin, including Peter Hille, Richard Dehmel, Erich Mühsam, Paul Scheerbart, and Frank Wedekind, among others. In October 1911 he met the painter Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, who painted several portraits of Döblin between 1912 and 1914 and illustrated some of Döblin&#x27;s literary works. Döblin&#x27;s early novel &quot;Der Schwarze Vorhang&quot; was published in &quot;Der Sturm&quot;, and in November 1912 the Munich publishing house Georg Müller published his collection of novellas under the title &quot;Die Ermordung einer Butterblume und andere Erzählungen&quot;. In May 1913, he completed his third novel &quot;The Three Leaps of Wang Lun&quot; (&quot;Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun&quot;). Published in 1916, this historical novel about political uprising in 18th-century China was a literary breakthrough for Döblin, earning him literary acclaim, public recognition, and the prestigious Fontane Prize. He began writing &quot;Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine&quot; (&quot;Wadzek&#x27;s Struggle with the Steam Turbine&quot;) the following year, completing it by December 1914 although it was not published until 1918.

===1915–1933: The First World War and the Weimar years===

To avoid conscription, Döblin volunteered in December 1914 and was posted to Saargemünd (Sarreguemines) as a doctor. Despite sharing in the widespread early enthusiasm for the war among German intellectuals, he soon developed a pacifist disposition. His son Wolfgang was born on 17 March 1915, followed by the births of Klaus on 20 May 1917 and Stefan on 7 December 1926. In Saargemünd the family lived in a small apartment at Neunkircherstraße 19; due to their financial situation they had to give up their Berlin apartment at the end of February 1915.
At the end of August, 1916, Döblin was awarded the Fontane Prize (including a monetary award of 600 Marks) for &quot;The Three Leaps of Wang Lun&quot; (&quot;Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun&quot;). Following this recognition, Döblin set himself to work on his historical novel &quot;Wallenstein&quot;, set during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Döblin had to interrupt work on the novel in March 1917 because he had caught typhus, but was able to use the university library at Heidelberg during his convalescence in April and May to continue researching the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Back in Saargemünd he came into conflict with his superiors due to the poor treatment of the patients; on 2 August 1917 he was transferred to Hagenau (Haguenau) in Alsace, where the library of nearby Strassbourg helped complete &quot;Wallenstein&quot; by the beginning of 1919.

At the beginning of 1919, Döblin moved into his new apartment and medical practice at Frankfurter Allee 340 in Berlin. The immediate postwar period was a turbulent time for him—his financial situation was dire, and the death of his sister Meta on 12 March 1919 as the result of an injury sustained during skirmishes between the Spartacists and nationalist troops in Berlin showed how volatile the situation in Germany was in the aftermath of the November Revolution. The years during and immediately after the war also marked Döblin&#x27;s growing politicization; although he never joined a party he identified with the political left. During this time Döblin wrote a number of satirical and polemical political essays under the pseudonym &quot;Linke Poot,&quot; a dialectical variation of &quot;Linke Pfote&quot; (Left Paw), eleven of which were published in 1921 in a volume called &quot;Der deutsche Maskenball&quot; (&quot;The German Masked Ball&quot;).

In February 1921, he met the 21-year-old photographer Charlotte (&quot;Yolla&quot;) Niclas; the close romantic relationship between the two was to last many years, despite their age difference. The same year, following a family vacation to the Baltic coast, he began preparatory work on his science fiction novel &quot;Berge Meere und Giganten&quot; (&quot;Mountains Seas and Giants&quot;), which would be published in 1924. In 1920 Döblin joined the Association of German Writers (&quot;Schutzverband Deutscher Schriftsteller&quot;), and in 1924 he became its president. In November 1921 he began reviewing plays for the &quot;Prager Tagblatt&quot;, and in 1925 joined the &quot;Gruppe 1925&quot;, a discussion circle of progressive and communist intellectuals including Bertolt Brecht, Johannes R. Becher, Ernst Bloch, Hermann Kasack, Rudolf Leonhard, Walter Mehring, Robert Musil, Joseph Roth, Ernst Toller, Kurt Tucholsky, and Ernst Weiß, among others. It was likely Brecht, who counted Döblin among his significant influences, who introduced him to Erwin Piscator in 1928.

 At the end of September 1924, he set out on a two-month trip through Poland, subsidized by the Fischer Verlag and prompted in part by the anti-Semitic pogroms in Berlin&#x27;s Scheunenviertel of 1923, an event that awakened Döblin&#x27;s interest in Judaism. His description of his travels to Warsaw, Vilnius, Lviv, and Kraków, among other cities, was published in November 1925 under the title &quot;Reise in Polen&quot; (&quot;Journey to Poland&quot;). From 1926 to 1927 Döblin worked on his free verse epic &quot;Manas&quot;, about a figure from Indian mythology, which was published in May 1927. &quot;Manas&quot;, like his philosophical tract &quot;Das Ich über der Natur&quot; published the same year, proved to be a failure with the public. Thus despite his continued rise to prominence within the intellectual world of the Weimar Republic—in 1928, for example, he was elected to the prestigious Prussian Academy of Arts with the persistent support of Thomas Mann—literary and economic success continued to elude Döblin.

This changed with the October 1929 publication of his novel &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; which earned him national and global fame. One of the best known appraisals of the novel is Walter Benjamin&#x27;s essay, &quot;Die Krisis des Romans&quot; (&quot;The Crisis of the Novel&quot;) which sees in &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; radical use of montage a solution to the impasses of the traditional novel. Döblin soon began transforming &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; into a radio play and agreed to cowrite the screenplay for the film version that premiered on 8 October 1931. The early 1930s marked the high point of Döblin&#x27;s fame. During this time he busied himself with lectures, readings, and the effort to contribute to a collective intellectual response to the growing power of the National Socialists. Just over a month after Hitler&#x27;s ascension to power, Döblin left Germany, crossing into Switzerland on 2 March 1933.

=== 1933–1957: Exile and later life ===

After a brief stay in Zürich, the family moved to Paris. Döblin&#x27;s closest acquaintances during this time were Claire and Yvan Goll, Hermann Kesten, Arthur Koestler, Joseph Roth, Hans Sahl, and Manès Sperber. Here he also saw Robert Musil, with whom he had kept up a sporadic relationship for over a decade, for the last time. Döblin finished his novel &quot;Babylonische Wandrung&quot; at the end of 1933. In 1935, he began work on his &quot;Amazon Trilogy&quot;, which narrates the colonization and Christianization of South America and was published in 1937–1938. During this time he also began work on his four-part novel project &quot;November 1918&quot; about the revolution in Germany at the end of the First World War. He acquired French nationality in October 1936. In May 1939, he briefly visited the United States to take part in a PEN congress in New York. With other writers, he met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House, and saw his old Berlin acquaintance Ernst Toller again, who was suffering from severe depression and killed himself shortly thereafter.

After the start of the Second World War the family fled Paris, while Döblin&#x27;s manuscripts were stored in the basement of the Sorbonne. Between the start of the war in 1939 and the German occupation of France in 1940, Döblin worked for the French ministry of information, writing counter-propaganda texts against Nazi Germany with a group of French Germanists and journalists, as well as artists like Frans Masereel.

In 1940, aged 62, Döblin was again uprooted by the German invasion of France, and spent weeks in a refugee camp in Mende. During this time, he began attending mass at the cathedral in Mende, taking a turn towards Christianity that would culminate in his religious conversion the following year. On 3 September 1940, Alfred, Erna, and Stefan boarded the &quot;Nea Hellas&quot; in Lisbon, reaching New York six days later; in October they moved to Los Angeles. Döblin worked briefly for Metro Goldwyn Mayer writing screenplays for $100 a week, but his contract expired in October 1941 and was not renewed, despite the interventions of Thomas Mann and others. Alfred, Erna, and Stefan were baptized as Roman Catholics in Hollywood&#x27;s Blessed Sacrament Church on 30 November 1941.

Döblin completed work on &quot;November 1918&quot; in the spring of 1943, but was unable to find a publisher. The only work of his that was published in German during his American exile was a private printing of 250 copies of the &quot;Nocturno&quot; episode from &quot;November 1918&quot;. Döblin was embittered by his isolation and setbacks in exile, drawing a strong distinction between his own situation and that of more successful writers less oppressed by material concerns, such as Lion Feuchtwanger and Thomas Mann. In honor of his 65th birthday, Helene Weigel organized a party on 14 August 1943 in Santa Monica. In attendance were Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Bertolt Brecht, among others. Heinrich Mann gave a speech, Fritz Kortner, Peter Lorre, and Alexander Granach read aloud from Döblin&#x27;s works, and he was presented with notes of congratulation and praise from Brecht, Max Horkheimer, and Alfred Polgar, among others. Compositions by Hanns Eisler were performed, and Blandine Ebinger sang Berlin chansons. Yet the festivities were dampened when Döblin gave a speech in which he mentioned his conversion to Catholicism; the religious, moral tone proved alienating, and fell on unsympathetic ears.
In 1945, Döblin&#x27;s 18-year-old son Stefan was called up for military service in the French army. That spring had brought the good news that Klaus was alive and in Switzerland after a period working for the French resistance, and the grim tidings that Wolfgang was dead, having committed suicide five years to avoid being captured by troops of the Wehrmacht. In October 1945, Alfred and Erna arrived in New York, sailing aboard the &quot;Argentine&quot; back to Europe. They first settled in Baden-Baden, where Döblin worked for the French military government as official representative for the office of public education; he was tasked with approving manuscripts for publication, and vehemently opposed the approval of any texts by authors who had sympathized with National Socialism, such as Ernst Jünger or Gottfried Benn. In postwar Germany&#x27;s conservative cultural climate, Döblin was unable to draw on his earlier success as an author, yet continued his literary engagement with a series of publications and journals that aimed to rebuild Germany&#x27;s intellectual and cultural life, reintroducing the literature banned by the Nazis and fostering the growth of younger writers. Despite these efforts, Döblin was disappointed by the apparent continuity between the Nazi years and the postwar climate. His growing pessimism was fueled by his sense of isolation and marginalization within the postwar German literary scene. In 1953, Alfred and Erna returned to Paris despite the invitation by Brecht and Johannes R. Becher to settle in East Berlin.

His last novel, &quot;Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende&quot; (&quot;Tales of a Long Night&quot;), was published in 1956, and was favorably received. Döblin&#x27;s remaining years were marked by poor health (he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease) and lengthy stays in multiple clinics and hospitals, including his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Freiburg University. Through the intervention of Theodor Heuss and Joachim Tiburtius, he was able to receive more money from the Berlin office in charge of compensating victims of Nazi persecution; this, and a literary prize from the Mainz Academy in the sum of 10,000 DM helped finance his growing medical expenses.

Alfred Döblin died in the hospital in Emmendingen on 26 June 1957 and was buried two days later in the village cemetery at Housseras next to his son Wolfgang. Erna soon joined them in the same cemetery when after turning on the gas tap in the family apartment in Paris on 15 September, she forgot to light the flame.

==Major works==

===&quot;The Three Leaps of Wang Lun&quot;===

&quot;Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun&quot; (&quot;The Three Leaps of Wang Lun&quot;) was Döblin&#x27;s third novel (although it was the first to be published as a book), and garnered him the Fontane Prize. Published in 1916, (although back-dated to 1915), this epic historical novel narrates upheaval and revolution in 18th-century China, and was favorably received by critics, who praised its detailed and exotic depictions of China. &quot;Wang Lun&quot; also had an influence on younger German writers, including Lion Feuchtwanger, Anna Seghers, and Bertolt Brecht; for the latter, &quot;Wang Lun&quot; provided an impulse for the development of the theory of epic theatre. In commercial sales, it is Döblin&#x27;s most successful novel after &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;.

===&quot;Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine&quot;===
Döblin&#x27;s 1918 comic novel has been seen, in its experimental narrative technique, its refusal to psychologize its characters, and its depictions of Berlin as modern metropolis, as a precursor to Döblin&#x27;s better-known &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;. &quot;Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine&quot; (&quot;Wadzek&#x27;s Battle with the Steam Turbine&quot;) tells the story of Wadzek, a factory owner locked in a losing battle with a more powerful competitor. His futile and increasingly delusional countermeasures culminate in the fortification and quixotic defense of his family&#x27;s garden house in suburban Reinickendorf. Following the dissipation of this endeavor, he suffers a breakdown and finally flees the country, eloping aboard a steamship bound for America that is powered by the steam turbines of his victorious competitor. Döblin wrote the novel in the fall of 1914, submitting it to extensive stylistic revisions while serving as a doctor on the Western front; it was published in May 1918 by the Fischer Verlag. In its stringent refusal of a tragic tone, the book earned the praise of a young Bertolt Brecht.

===&quot;Wallenstein&quot;===

Although Döblin&#x27;s 1920 epic about the Thirty Years&#x27; War was in general favorably received by critics, he was disappointed with the reception because he felt he had created in &quot;Wallenstein&quot; a peerless work; as a consequence, he wrote a scathing critique of critics which he published in 1921 under the title &quot;Der Epiker, sein Stoff und die Kritik&quot; (&quot;The Epic Poet, his Material, and Critique&quot;). The novel centers on the tension between Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor and his general, Albrecht von Wallenstein; Wallenstein represents a new type of warfare characterized by ruthless &quot;Realpolitik&quot; and capitalist expansion while Ferdinand becomes increasingly overwhelmed by the course of events and gradually retreats from politics altogether. Döblin&#x27;s approach to narrating the war differed from prevailing historiography in that, rather than interpreting the Thirty Years&#x27; War primarily as a religious conflict, he portrays it critically as the absurd consequence of a combination of national-political, financial, and individual psychological factors. Döblin saw a strong similarity between the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the First World War, during which he wrote &quot;Wallenstein&quot;. The novel is counted among the most innovative and significant historical novels in the German literary tradition.

===&quot;Berge Meere und Giganten&quot;===

Döblin&#x27;s 1924 science fiction novel recounts the course of human history from the 20th to the 27th century, portraying it as a catastrophic global struggle between technological mania, natural forces, and competing political visions. &quot;Berge Meere und Giganten&quot; (&quot;Mountains Seas and Giants&quot;) presciently invokes such topics as urbanization, the alienation from nature, ecological devastation, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Stylistically and structurally experimental, it was regarded as a difficult work when it first came out and has often polarized critics. Among others, Günter Grass has praised the novel&#x27;s continued relevance and insight. On June 15, 2021, Galileo Publishing released the first English translation of the novel, by Chris Godwin, under the title &quot;Mountains Oceans Giants: An Epic of the 27th Century.&quot;

===&quot;Manas&quot;===
This remarkable but almost totally neglected epic in free verse immediately preceded Döblin&#x27;s best-known work &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;. That both works were closely associated in Döblin&#x27;s mind is shown by a remark in his Afterword to the 1955 East German edition of his big-city masterpiece: it was &quot;Manas with a Berlin accent&quot;, Praised on its publication by Robert Musil among others (&quot;I assert with confidence that this work should have the greatest influence!&quot;) it has attracted strangely little attention from Döblin scholars. 
&quot;Manas&quot; Part 1 tells the story of a war-hero suddenly struck with an existential realisation of Death. He demands to be taken to Shiva&#x27;s Field of the Dead in the high Himalaya to commune with Souls on their way to dissolution. Having imbibed several dreadful life stories he falls unconscious, and his body is invaded by three demons who plan to use it to go down to the human world. Manas&#x27; guardian, Puto, attempting to drive out the demons, inadvertently kills the body, and Manas&#x27;s soul wafts back onto the Field. Puto conveys the body back to Udaipur, then returns to the mountains to fight the demons. 
In Part 2, Savitri, Manas&#x27; wife, refuses to believe her husband is dead, and makes her arduous way up into the mountains to find him. Shiva becomes aware of her presence on his Field, and makes contact across their different dimensions. Savitri is able to couple with Manas&#x27; soul, and he is reborn into his body. Savitri, revealed now as the Universal Female, rejoins Shiva on Mount Kailash.
In Part 3, the reborn Manas rejoices in his physicality, but does not understand where he fits into the world. He comes upon Puto fighting the three demons, captures them, and is carried by them back down into the world. A village priest declares that Manas and the demons make up a single new terrible being: likely meaning a human no longer innocent but equipped with Id, Ego and Superego. When Manas destroys a temple, Shiva comes down to subdue him, but Manas&#x27; Ego calls out to the natural world, and Shiva has to release him, transforming the demons into sleek winged panthers on which Manas rides to connect Souls longing to return with humans tired of life. 
This powerful and sometimes puzzling story is told in a vigorous, direct and dramatic language, with constantly shifting moods and voices. In order to make it more accessible to English readers in the absence of any guidance from reviewers, the translator C D Godwin has adapted it as a Play for Voices, available for download at the website Beyond Alexanderplatz: Alfred Döblin&#x27;s OTHER writings, in English.

===&quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;===

Generally considered Döblin&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; has become an iconic text of the Weimar Republic. Published in 1929, its innovative use of literary montage as well as its panoramic portrayal of a modern metropolis have earned it a place among the key works of literary modernism. &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; tells the story of Franz Biberkopf, who as the novel opens has just been released from prison for killing his lover. Although he seeks to become respectable, he is quickly drawn into a struggle &quot;with something that comes from without, that is unpredictable and looks like a destiny.&quot; Biberkopf suffers a series of setbacks and catastrophes, including the murder of his lover and the loss of an arm. The novel earned Döblin global recognition and literary celebrity, and was translated into English in 1931 by Eugene Jolas, a friend of James Joyce. It has been filmed twice, once in the 1931 &quot;Berlin-Alexanderplatz&quot;, directed by Phil Jutzi and starring Heinrich George as Biberkopf, and then again in Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s 1980 14-part television film. In a 2002 poll of 100 noted writers from around the world, &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; was named among the top 100 books of all time.

===&quot;November 1918: A German Revolution&quot;===

&quot;November 1918: A German Revolution&quot; (&quot;November 1918, eine deutsche Revolution&quot;) is a novel tetralogy about the German Revolution of 1918–1919. The four volumes—Vol. I: &quot;Bürger und Soldaten&quot; (&quot;Citizens and Soldiers&quot;), Vol. II &quot;Verratenes Volk&quot; (&quot;A People Betrayed&quot;), Vol. III, &quot;Heimkehr der Fronttruppen&quot; (&quot;Return of the Frontline Troops&quot;), and Vol. IV, &quot;Karl und Rosa&quot; (&quot;Karl and Rosa&quot;)—together comprise the most significant work from Döblin&#x27;s period of exile (1933–1945). The work was highly praised by figures such as Bertolt Brecht, and critic Gabriele Sander has described &quot;November 1918&quot; as representing the culmination of Döblin&#x27;s work in the genre of the historical novel.

===&quot;Tales of a Long Night&quot;===

&quot;Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende&quot; (&quot;Tales of a Long Night&quot;) (1956) was Döblin&#x27;s last novel. Set in England immediately after the Second World War, the novel narrates the story of Edward Allison, an English soldier who had been badly wounded during the war. Back among his family, Edward must deal with his war trauma, long buried family conflicts, and his destabilized sense of self. The novel treats such themes as the search for the self, guilt and responsibility, the struggle between the sexes, war and violence, and religion, among others. Döblin wrote the novel between August 1945 and October 1946, although it was not published until a decade later. Upon its 1956 release by the East Berlin publishing house Rütten &amp; Loening, the novel was well received. The reference to Hamlet in the German title was likely motivated by Döblin&#x27;s reading of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s interpretation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

==Legacy==

Döblin is generally considered one of the most important German writers of the twentieth century; yet popular perception of his work rests almost exclusively on &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;, considered the canonical German novel of the modern metropolis (&quot;Großstadtroman&quot;). His writing is characterized by an innovative use of montage and perspectival play, as well as what he dubbed in 1913 a &quot;fantasy of fact&quot; (&quot;Tatsachenphantasie&quot;)—an interdisciplinary poetics that draws on modern discourses ranging from the psychiatric to the anthropological to the theological, in order to &quot;register and articulate sensory experience and to open up his prose to new areas of knowledge.&quot; His engagement with such key movements of the European avant-garde as futurism, expressionism, dadaism, and &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot; has led critic Sabina Becker to call him &quot;perhaps the most significant representative of literary modernism in Berlin.&quot;

In a 1967 essay, Günter Grass declared: &quot;Without the Futurist elements of Döblin&#x27;s work from &quot;Wang Lun&quot; to &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;, my prose is inconceivable.&quot; Döblin was also an influence on writers such as W.G. Sebald and Bertolt Brecht; as Brecht wrote in 1943, &quot;I learned more about the essence of the epic from Döblin than from anyone else. His epic writing and even his theory about the epic strongly influenced my own dramatic art.&quot;

Modern, well-edited, critical volumes of almost the complete œuvre have been appearing in German since the 1980s, published by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag and, since 2008, by the Fischer Verlag; and the Internationale Alfred-Döblin Kolloquien have been held every two years since the early 1980s. But only a handful of other works of fiction have ever appeared in English translations: &quot;The Three Leaps of Wang Lun&quot; (trans. C. D. Godwin, Chinese University Press, Hong Kong, 1991), and the &quot;November 1918&quot; trilogy: &quot;A People Betrayed&quot; (which also includes &quot;The Troops Return&quot;) and &quot;Karl and Rosa&quot; (trans. John E. Woods, Fromm International, 1983 and 1987); &quot;Tales of a Long Night&quot; (trans John E Woods, From International, 1987; and the lesser-known big-city novel &quot;Men without Mercy&quot; (trans. Trevor and Phyllis Blewitt, Howard Fertig, 1976). Two works of autobiography have also been translated: &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Journey&quot; (trans. Edna McCown, Paragon House, 1992), the harrowing account of Döblin&#x27;s flight and exile in the 1940s; and the account of his mid-1920s &quot;Journey to Poland&quot; (trans J. Neugroschel, I. B. Tauris, 1991).

Döblin&#x27;s papers and manuscripts are housed at the German Literature Archive in Marbach am Neckar.

<text>Zerbst () is a town in the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Until an administrative reform in 2007, Zerbst was the capital of the former Anhalt-Zerbst district.

==Geography==
Zerbst is situated in the Anhalt-Wittenberg region, with its town centre located on the river Nuthe about northeast of the Elbe, halfway between Magdeburg and Wittenberg.

With the 1 January 2010 local government reform, the 21 formerly independent communities of the disbanded &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; (municipal association) Elbe-Ehle-Nuthe were incorporated into the town. Zerbst today counts about 24,000 inhabitants and, at , is the fifth largest town in Germany by area. The current municipal area stretches from the Elbe in the southwest up to the Fläming Heath and the state border with Brandenburg in the northeast.

=== Divisions ===
The town Zerbst consists of Zerbst proper and the following 24 &quot;Ortschaften&quot; or municipal divisions:

*Bias
*Bornum
*Buhlendorf
*Deetz
*Dobritz
*Gehrden
*Gödnitz
*Grimme
*Güterglück
*Hohenlepte

==History==
In the 8th century the area east of the Elbe was settled by Polabian Slavs (Sorbs). Part of the border region with the adjacent Saxon region around Magdeburg in the west, it was incorporated into the &quot;Gau Ciervisti&quot; of the Saxon Eastern March (&quot;Marca Geronis&quot;) about 937 in the course of the German &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;.
It is not clear when Zerbst was founded; however, the name &quot;Ciervisti&quot; mentioned as early as 949 may already refer to a fortified Slavic settlement. The chronicles by Prince-Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg recorded the first mention of a town as &quot;Zirwisti urbs&quot; in 1018, giving an account of the occupation by the Polish duke Bolesław I Chrobry during the German–Polish War with King Henry II in 1007. In the early 12th century the Ascanian ruler Albert the Bear had the fortress rebuilt, and the adjacent settlement was first fortified with town walls about 1250.

In 1307 Prince Albert I of Anhalt acquired the city of Zerbst from the Barby comital family, starting a centuries-long rule by the Ascanian princely House of Anhalt. His descendants continued to rule the Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst until in 1396 it was divided between Prince Sigismund I and his brother Albert IV, and the residence was moved to Dessau.

In 1375 Zerbster Bitterbier was first mentioned; by the Middle Ages the town had 600 breweries.
Following the Reformation Zerbst became a Calvinist centre. From 1582 to 1798 the &quot;Francisceum Gymnasium Illustre&quot; was an important Calvinist college. From 1603 to 1793 Zerbst again was the residence of the Anhalt-Zerbst princes, whose rule included among others also the Lordship of Jever in East Frisia. From 1722 to 1758, the Baroque composer Johann Friedrich Fasch resided there and was employed as a &quot;Hofkomponist&quot; and later &quot;Hofkapellmeister&quot;. To honour his memory, the Fasch Festivals have taken place in the city since 1983.

In 1745 Princess Sophie Auguste Friederike of Anhalt-Zerbst married Peter, Crown Prince of Russia, the heir apparent to the Russian throne. As Catherine II (the Great) she herself reigned as Empress of Russia from until ).

In 1797 Zerbst became a component of the Principality of Anhalt-Dessau.

From 1891 to 1928 a horse-drawn tram was operated in Zerbst, one of the longest surviving among such tram in Germany.

In the later part of the Second World War a Nazi labour camp was established on the edge of the military airfield, housing so-called &quot;First-degree Hybrids&quot; and &quot;Jüdisch Versippte&quot; (i.e., people with some Jewish blood, enough in Nazi terms to justify badly mistreating them but not killing them outright). 700 inmates from there were used for hard labour in road and airport construction as well as peat digging.

On 16 April 1945 – just a few weeks before the final surrender of Nazi Germany – some eighty percent of Zerbst was destroyed in an Allied air raid.

The old town was rebuilt in the following decades resulting in a fundamental change of the townscape, as only a few historical structures were preserved or reconstructed.

On 1 July 2006, the town of Zerbst was renamed Zerbst/Anhalt. A year later, on 1 July 2007, the town of Zerbst/Anhalt was incorporated together with several other municipalities of the Zerbst administrative district, creating the renewed Anhalt-Bitterfeld administrative district with its capital at Köthen.

<text>Clair Engle (September 21, 1911July 30, 1964) was an American politician who served as a United States Senator from California from 1959 until his death in 1964. A member of the Democratic Party, he is best remembered for participating in the vote breaking the filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the U.S. Senate while partially paralyzed and unable to speak, shortly before his death from a brain tumor. Engle previously served in the California State Senate from January to August 1943 and in the U.S. House of Representatives from August 1943 until January 1959.

== Early life==

Engle was born in Bakersfield, to Fred Engle, a rancher who had been a teacher and a lawyer, and his wife, Carita. His parents named him after his aunt, who had assisted in his birth, and his name would become the source of many folksy stories over the years.

Like his two brothers, he was active in outdoor activities and attended public schools in Shasta and Tehama counties. His fellow students at Red Bluff High School elected him their student body president.

In 1928, he enrolled at Chico State Teachers College, and he graduated in 1930. He then attended University of California Hastings College of the Law, and graduated in 1933. Although Engle had a reputation for straight-laced religiosity at both institutions, he eloped to marry his first wife, Hazel. They divorced in 1948 and Engle married his second wife, Lucretia Caldwell, a congressional secretary from San Jose.

==Early career==
Admitted to the California bar in 1933, Engle set up a practice in Corning and soon ran for District Attorney of Tehama County. Just 23 years old at the time of his victory, he would hold that office from 1934 to 1942.

In 1942, he won election to the California Senate, representing Tehama, Glenn and Colusa counties but ended up serving in that body for little more than a few months. His main accomplishment was passing a law to allow the conversion of unused fairgrounds in order to house migrant farmworkers and ease a severe labor shortage.

== U.S. Representative ==

On August 31, 1943, Engle was elected as a Democrat to represent California&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in the 78th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Harry Lane Englebright. Although the district had more Republican than Democratic voters, Englebright&#x27;s widow and another candidate split the Republican vote.

Engle was elected to a full term in 1944 and re-elected to the following six Congresses, serving until January 3, 1959. At that time, the district consisted of 18 counties in northern California, and only the district in Nevada was physically larger. Thus, Engle used his pilot&#x27;s license to campaign and meet with constituents. He was dubbed the &quot;flying congressman&quot; and once flew solo to his home in California from the Hybla Valley Airport in Alexandria, Virginia.

He was sometimes jokingly referred to as &quot;Congressman Fireball&quot; because of his activity, his colorful language, the location of the geologically active Mount Lassen in his district, and the clouds of smoke from his cigars.

In the U.S. House of Representatives he became Chairman of the U.S. House Committee on War Claims for the 79th Congress and Chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs for the 84th Congress and the 85th Congress.

He sponsored several major expansions of the California Central Valley Project as well as the Saline Water Conversion Research Program, and a low-interest loan program relating to small irrigation projects. He also became known as a key supporter of the Taft–Hartley Act, which did not prevent him from being nominated by both parties when he sought re-election.

== U.S. Senator ==
Engle won election as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1958, the year of a Democratic landslide. He defeated the incumbent governor Goodwin J. Knight, thus becoming the first Democrat elected to that Senate seat in the 20th century. He succeeded William F. Knowland, who had given up the seat in an unsuccessful run for governor, losing to Pat Brown.

Engle began his term on January 3, 1959. He worked with Senator Thomas Kuchel to pass the San Luis water project, the West Coast electric power intertie and the Point Reyes National Seashore. Engle also promoted federal public transit assistance and civil rights legislation to assist his urban constituents.

However, on August 24, 1963, Senator Engle underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor, which left him partially paralyzed, forcing him to miss several Senate sessions, and he ultimately withdrew from his re-election campaign. On April 13, 1964, the gravity of Engle&#x27;s health problems was evident as he attempted to introduce a resolution calling for a delay in constructing the Bodega Bay Nuclear Power Plant at Bodega Head, located in Sonoma County. He was given permission to speak, but was unable to do so; a colleague presented the resolution instead. Engle did not return to the Senate floor for nearly two months.

Engle officially ended his re-election campaign on April 28, 1964, just four days after undergoing his second brain operation in eight months. He chose not to endorse either of his Democratic challengers, California State Controller Alan Cranston or former presidential press secretary Pierre Salinger. That decision came because state Democratic leaders refused to endorse him unless he provided details concerning his health.

On June 10, 1964, during the roll call for the historic, successful effort to break the filibuster on what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when the clerk reached &quot;Mr. Engle&quot;, there was no reply. The tumor had robbed Engle of his ability to speak. Slowly lifting an arm, he pointed to his eye, thereby signaling his affirmative vote (&quot;aye&quot;). The cloture vote was 71–29, four votes more than the two thirds required to end the filibuster. Nine days later, the Senate approved the Act itself.

==Death and legacy==
Engle died in Washington, D.C., a month and a half later, aged 52. He was survived by his parents, his wife and his daughter from his first marriage, Yvonne Engle Childs. The Senate Chaplain led the memorial service at Fort Myer, Virginia, which Chief Justice Earl Warren attended. Approximately 3,000 mourners attended his funeral in Red Bluff at the First Methodist Church. He was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery.

Trinity Lake, in California&#x27;s Trinity County, was renamed for him, but the name Trinity Lake continued to be commonly used; eventually, the lake&#x27;s original name was officially restored. The city of Shasta Lake named a park and community center after him. His papers are held in the library at California State University, Chico.

<doc id="896467" wikidata="Q4413141" url="?curid=896467" title="Carrier oil">
<text>Carrier oil, also known as base oil or vegetable oil, is used to dilute essential oils and absolutes before they are applied to the skin in massage and aromatherapy. They are so named because they &quot;carry&quot; the essential oil onto the skin at a safe concentration. Diluting essential oils is a critical safety practice when using essential oils. Essential oils alone are volatile; they begin to dissipate as soon as they are applied. The rate of dispersion varies based on factors such as viscosity, vapour pressure, and the molecular weight of the volatile components. Carrier oils do not contain a concentrated aroma, unlike essential oils, though some, such as olive, have a mild distinctive smell. Neither do they evaporate like essential oils, which are more volatile. The carrier oils used should be as natural and unadulterated as possible. Many people feel organic oils are of higher quality. Cold-pressing and maceration are the two main methods of producing carrier oils.

There is a range of different carrier oils, each with a various therapeutic properties. Choosing an oil will depend on the area being massaged, the presenting conditions and the clients sensitivity and requirements. For massage, viscosity is a major consideration; for example, grape seed oil is typically very thin, while olive oil is much thicker. Sunflower, sweet almond and grape seed oils have viscosities midway between these extremes. Carrier oils can be easily blended to combine their properties of viscosity, acceptability, lubrication, absorption, aroma and so forth.

&quot;Infused oils&quot; are a combination of a carrier oil and plant material and they can be either commercially or domestically prepared. A base oil, often sunflower, is placed in an airtight container with the appropriate plant material for a time. Calendula and carrot oils are produced in this way.

High quality oils sold for culinary use are often eminently suitable for massage use, and are economical; those obtained by cold pressing are preferred. All carrier oils should be kept cool, and away from strong light, to retard rancidification. Rancid oils should be avoided. Refrigerating oils helps preserve their freshness but some oils should not be refrigerated (e.g. avocado). Very cold oils may appear cloudy, but regain their clear state on returning to room temperature.

Sources passionately disagree on the suitability of mineral oil as a carrier oil. In the United States, food grade mineral oil is highly refined and purified to meet the stringent requirements of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Mineral oil marked as &quot;USP&quot; also meets the standards of the U.S. Pharmacopeia.

==Varieties==
True carrier oils are generally cold-pressed or macerated vegetable oils taken from, among others:
*Apricot oil
*Grape seed oil
*Avocado oil
*Olive oil
*Sesame oil
*Evening primrose oil
*Canola (rapeseed oil)
*Camellia seed oil
*Sunflower oil
*Marula oil
*Jojoba oil
*Emu oil
*Castor oil
*Borage seed oil
*Nuts:
**Walnut oil
**Peanut oil
**Pecan oil
**Macadamia oil
**Fractionated coconut oil
**Hazelnut oil
**Cocoa butter
**Sweet almond oil

==Safety aspects==
Peanuts are legumes, not true nuts, but they share with true nuts the risk of causing allergic reactions, even in minute amounts. Pure peanut and nut-derived oils are not usually allergenic (as they do not typically contain the proteinaceous part of the plant), but avoiding them may be safer, as serious peanut and nut allergy is widespread, oil purity cannot be guaranteed, and other hypoallergenic oils are easily substituted.

<doc id="896469" wikidata="Q2585693" url="?curid=896469" title="Efficacy">
<text>Efficacy is the ability to perform a task to a satisfactory or expected degree. The word comes from the same roots as &quot;effectiveness&quot;, and it has often been used synonymously, although in pharmacology a distinction is now often made between efficacy and effectiveness.

The word &quot;efficacy&quot; is used in pharmacology and medicine to refer both to the maximum response achievable from a pharmaceutical drug in research settings, and to the capacity for sufficient therapeutic effect or beneficial change in clinical settings.

== Pharmacology ==

In pharmacology, efficacy () is the maximum response achievable from an applied or dosed agent, for instance, a small molecule drug. Intrinsic activity is a relative term for a drug&#x27;s efficacy relative to a drug with the highest observed efficacy. It is a purely descriptive term that has little or no mechanistic interpretation.

In order for a drug to have an effect, it needs to bind to its target, and then to affect the function of this target. The target of a drug is commonly referred to as a receptor, but can in general be any chemically sensitive site on any molecule found in the body. The nature of such binding can be quantified by characterising how tightly these molecules, the drug and its receptor, interact: this is known as the affinity. Efficacy, on the other hand, is a measure of the action of a drug once binding has occurred. The maximum response, , will be reduced if efficacy is sufficiently low.

The definition of efficacy has been object for discussion. The only way in which absolute measures of efficacy have been obtained is by single ion channel analysis of ligand gated ion channels. It is still not possible to do this for G protein-linked receptors.

In the case of the glycine receptor and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (muscle type), it has been proposed by Sivilotti &quot;et al&quot;. that opening of the ion channel involves two steps after agonist is bound. Firstly a conformation change to a higher affinity (but still shut) form, followed by the conformation change from shut to open. It was found that partial agonism results from deficiency in the first step, and that the opening and shutting steps are essentially the same for both full and partial agonists. This has been confirmed and extended by Sine and colleagues (2009). The implication of this work is that efficacy has to be defined by at least two equilibrium constants (or, more generally, by four rate constants).

The combined influences of affinity and efficacy determine how effectively a drug will produce a biological effect, a property known as potency.

== Medicine ==
In medicine, efficacy is the capacity for beneficial change (or therapeutic effect) of a given intervention (for example a drug, medical device, surgical procedure, or a public health intervention). Establishment of the efficacy of an intervention is often done relative to other available interventions, with which it will be compared. Specifically, efficacy refers to &quot;whether a drug demonstrates a health benefit over a placebo or other intervention when tested in an ideal situation, such as a tightly controlled clinical trial.&quot; These studies focus on a primary parameter to be shown statistically different between placebo and intervention groups. Comparisons of this type are called &#x27;explanatory&#x27; randomized controlled trials, whereas &#x27;pragmatic&#x27; trials are used to establish the &quot;effectiveness&quot; of an intervention regarding also non-specific parameters.

Effectiveness refers to &quot;how the drug works in a real-world situation&quot;, and is &quot;often lower than efficacy because of interactions with other medications or health conditions of the patient, sufficient dose or duration of use not prescribed by the physician or followed by the patient, or use for an off-label condition that had not been tested.&quot;

In agriculture and forestry, efficacy is used to describe whether a pesticide is effective in controlling a pest or disease.

==Theology==
===Scripture===
In Protestant Theology (esp. in Lutheran but also in Calvinist doctrine) &quot;efficacy&quot; is an attribute of Scripture. The efficacy of Scripture means that it is united with the power of the Holy Spirit and with it, not only demands, but also creates the acceptance of its teaching and that this teaching produces faith and obedience. Efficacy further means that Holy Scripture is not a dead letter, but rather, the power of the Holy Spirit is inherent in it and that Scripture does not compel a mere intellectual assent to its doctrine, resting on logical argumentation, but rather it creates the living agreement of faith. The Smalcald Articles affirm, &quot;in those things which concern the spoken, outward Word, we must firmly hold that God grants His Spirit or grace to no one, except through or with the preceding outward Word.&quot; The Formula of Concord teaches that when humans reject the calling of the Holy Spirit, it is not a result of the Word being less efficacious. Instead, contempt for the means of grace is the result of &quot;the perverse will of man, which rejects or perverts the means and instrument of the Holy Ghost, which God offers him through the call, and resists the Holy Ghost, who wishes to be efficacious, and works through the Word...&quot;

<text>2nd Canadian Division Support Base Valcartier (2 CDSB Valcartier), formerly known as and commonly referred to as Canadian Forces Base Valcartier (CFB Valcartier), is a Canadian Forces base located in the municipality of Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier, north northwest of Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The 2nd Canadian Division is stationed at the base, comprising the 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group and the 2nd Canadian Division Support Group.

== Origins ==
CFB Valcartier was originally erected as a military training camp in August 1914 as part of the mobilization of the Canadian Expeditionary Force at the onset of World War I.

Inaugurated by Jean Chrétien, then Prime Minister of Canada, in 1995, a high bronze figure of a World War I soldier (1995) by André Gauthier at the entrance to CFB Valcartier commemorates the training of Canadian Army volunteers for the European battlefields in World War I.

The site was also used as an internment camp for &quot;enemy aliens&quot;, mainly eastern Europeans. The name Valcartier comes from the town of Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier, of which a large section was expropriated in order to create the military training camp. Due to its proximity to the Port of Quebec, Valcartier became the largest military camp on Canadian soil, including some 32,000 men, 8,000 horses, and one black bear

In 1968, after the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces, the title 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group was assigned to the brigade group established in CFB Valcartier.

== Geography ==
The base is and is located in the Quebec City region, of Quebec, Canada.

== Military presence ==
Currently, Valcartier is home to the 2nd Canadian Division. The division has two formations: 2nd Canadian Division Support Group (2 CDSG) and 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (5 CMBG).

*CFB Valcartier&#x27;s budget is $687.4 million annually. The base employs 7,700 people (6,200 military and 1,500 civilians). There are also 9,000 military reserve forces who are related to the base. Annually, the salary costs are $558 million. This sum represents half of the $1.2 billion spent on salaries by the Department of National Defence in Quebec each year. Also, the base spends $131 million locally each year.

== Contaminated water ==
In 1997, a cancer-causing chemical, trichloroethylene, was found in the water supply of CFB Valcartier and the nearby town of Shannon, Quebec. Trichloroethylene, which has been linked to liver cancer, was used for degreasing metal parts at the base for decades. The Shannon Citizens Committee (Regroupement des Citoyens de Shannon) launched a class-action lawsuit against the Department of National Defence in 2003.

<text>Berlin Alexanderplatz () is a 1929 novel by Alfred Döblin. It is considered one of the most important and innovative works of the Weimar Republic. In a 2002 poll of 100 noted writers, the book was named among the top 100 books of all time.

==Summary==
The story concerns a murderer, Franz Biberkopf, fresh from prison. When his friend murders the prostitute on whom Biberkopf has been relying as an anchor, he realizes that he will be unable to extricate himself from the underworld into which he has sunk. He must deal with misery, lack of opportunities, crime and the imminent ascendency of Nazism. During his struggle to survive against all odds, life rewards him with an unsuspected surprise, but his happiness does not last as the story continues.

==Focus and narrative technique==
The novel is set in the working-class district near Alexanderplatz in 1920s Berlin. Although its narrative style is sometimes compared to that of James Joyce&#x27;s, critics such as Walter Benjamin have drawn a distinction between &quot;Ulysses&quot;’ interior monologue and &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;&#x27;s use of montage. Oliver Kamm, writing in the London &quot;Times&quot;, says Döblin&#x27;s methods are more akin to Kafka in his use of &quot;&quot;erlebte Rede&quot; (roughly, experienced speech — a blending of first-person and third-person narrative)&quot;. The novel is told from multiple points of view, and uses sound effects, newspaper articles, songs, speeches, and other books to propel the plot.

==Translations==
The novel was translated into English in 1931 by Eugene Jolas, a friend of James Joyce. The translation was not well received; it particularly was criticised for the way in which it rendered everyday working-class speech. A 2018 English translation by Michael Hofmann, published by &quot;New York Review Books&quot;, was given a starred review from &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, which called it &quot;vigorous and fresh&quot; and a &quot;welcome refurbishing of a masterpiece of literary modernism&quot;. According to Oliver Kamm, &quot;Dialogue is the most difficult thing to get right in translation&quot; which Hofmann has rendered &quot;in cockney dialect. It reads fluently, even at the risk of being possibly obscure to a non-British audience&quot;.

==Film adaptations==

The novel has been adapted three times for film. In 1931 &quot;Berlin-Alexanderplatz&quot; was directed by Piel Jutzi. Döblin worked on the adaptation, along with Karlheinz Martin and Hans Wilhelm. The film starred Heinrich George, Maria Bard, Margarete Schlegel, Bernhard Minetti, Gerhard Bienert, Albert Florath and Paul Westermeier.

The second adaptation, &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;, was directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Produced for and shown on German television in 1980 as a 14-part miniseries, it also has been shown theatrically. It runs for 15 hours (NTSC and film releases expand the runtime by a half hour). Upon its release in New York City, ticket holders were required to come to the theatre for three consecutive nights to see the entire film.

Both films were released in November 2007 by the Criterion Collection in the US in a multi-disc DVD. A Region 2 edition of the Fassbinder version was released in the UK by Second Sight in October that year.

Burhan Qurbani directed the most recent film adaptation, &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;, which premiered at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival in 2020. Qurbani&#x27;s version recontextualised the lead role of Franz as Francis, an Afro-German refugee from Guinea-Bissau.

<text>Used in perfumery and aromatherapy, absolutes are similar to essential oils. They are concentrated, highly aromatic, oily mixtures extracted from plants. Whereas essential oils are produced by distillation, boiling, or pressing, absolutes are produced through solvent extraction, or more traditionally, through enfleurage.

== Production ==
First, plant material is extracted with a hydrocarbon solvent, such as hexane, to yield concrete. The concrete is then extracted with ethanol. The ethanol extract is cooled (e.g., to −15 °C) to solidify waxes, and cold filtered to yield a liquid extract. When the ethanol evaporates, an oil—the absolute—is left behind.

Traditionally, the absolute was obtained by enfleurage, where the resulting pomade was extracted with ethanol to yield the absolute.

==Character and use==
Some raw materials are either too delicate or too inert to be steam-distilled and can only yield their aroma through solvent extraction. Examples of these are jasmine and beeswax. Absolutes in demand include rose, jasmine, tuberose, jonquil, ylang-ylang, mimosa, boronia, lavender, lavandin, geranium, clary sage, violet, oakmoss, tonka bean.

Rose oil, jasmine absolute, tuberose absolute, tobacco absolute, orris root oil, ambrette seeds oil, angelica root oil, and orange flower oil are valuable and expensive fragrance and flavor ingredients.

Residual solvents may remain in the absolutes. Therefore, some absolutes are considered undesirable for aromatherapy.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-95 (; NATO reporting name: &quot;Bear&quot;) is a large, four-engine turboprop-powered strategic bomber and missile platform. First flown in 1952, the Tu-95 entered service with the Long-Range Aviation of the Soviet Air Forces in 1956 and was first used in combat in 2015. It is expected to serve the Russian Aerospace Forces until at least 2040.

A development of the bomber for maritime patrol is designated the Tu-142, while a passenger airliner derivative was called the Tu-114.

The aircraft has four Kuznetsov NK-12 engines with contra-rotating propellers. It is the only propeller-powered strategic bomber still in operational use today. The Tu-95 is one of the loudest military aircraft, particularly because the tips of the propeller blades move faster than the speed of sound. Its distinctive swept-back wings are set at an angle of 35°. The Tu-95 is the only propeller-driven aircraft with swept wings built in large numbers.

== Design and development ==

The design bureau, led by Andrei Tupolev, designed the Soviet Union&#x27;s first intercontinental bomber, the 1949 Tu-85, a scaled-up version of the Tu-4, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress copy. A new requirement was issued to both Tupolev and Myasishchev design bureaus in 1950: the proposed bomber had to have an un-refueled range of , far enough to threaten key targets in the United States. Other goals included the ability to carry an load over the target.

Tupolev was faced with selecting a suitable type of powerplant: the Tu-4 showed that piston engines were not powerful enough for such a large aircraft, and the AM-3 jet engines for the proposed T-4 intercontinental jet bomber used too much fuel to give the required range. Turboprop engines were more powerful than piston engines and gave better range than the turbojets available at the time, and gave a top speed between the two. Turboprops were also initially selected for the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress to meet its long range requirement, and for the British long-range transport aircraft, the Saunders-Roe Princess, the Bristol Brabazon Mk 2 and the Bristol Britannia.

Tupolev proposed a turboprop installation and a Tu-95 design with this configuration was officially approved by the government on 11 July 1951. It used four Kuznetsov coupled turboprops, each fitted with two contra-rotating propellers with four blades each, with a nominal power rating. The engine, advanced for its time, was designed by a German team of ex-Junkers prisoner-engineers under Ferdinand Brandner. The fuselage was conventional with a mid-mounted wing with 35 degrees of sweep, an angle that ensured that the main wing spar passed through the fuselage in front of the bomb bay. Retractable tricycle landing gear was fitted, with all three gear strut units retracting rearwards, with the main gear units retracting rearwards into extensions of the inner engine nacelles.

The Tu-95/I, with 2TV-2F engines, first flew in November 1952 with test pilot Alexey Perelet at the controls. After six months of test flights this aircraft suffered a propeller gearbox failure and crashed, killing Perelet. The second aircraft, Tu-95/II, used four 12,000 eshp Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprops which proved more reliable than the coupled 2TV-2F. After a successful flight testing phase, series production of the Tu-95 started in January 1956.

For a long time, the Tu-95 was known to U.S./NATO intelligence as the Tu-20. While this was the original Soviet Air Force designation for the aircraft, by the time it was being supplied to operational units it was already better known under the Tu-95 designation used internally by Tupolev, and the Tu-20 designation quickly fell out of use in the USSR. Since the Tu-20 designation was used on many documents acquired by U.S. intelligence agents, the name continued to be used outside the Soviet Union. Initially, the United States Department of Defense evaluated the Tu-95 as having a maximum speed of with a range of . These numbers had to be revised upward numerous times.

Like its American counterpart, the B-52, the Tu-95 has continued to operate in the Russian Aerospace Forces while several subsequent iterations of bomber design have come and gone. Part of the reason for this longevity was its suitability, like the B-52, for modification to different missions. Whereas the Tu-95 was originally intended to drop free-falling nuclear weapons, it was subsequently modified to perform a wide range of roles, such as the deployment of cruise missiles, maritime patrol (Tu-142), and even civilian airliner (Tu-114). An AWACS platform (Tu-126) was developed from the Tu-114. An icon of the Cold War, the Tu-95 has served not only as a weapons platform but as a symbol of Soviet and later Russian national prestige. Russia&#x27;s air force has received the first examples of a number of modernised strategic bombers in Tu-95MSs following upgrade work. Enhancements have been confined to the bomber&#x27;s electronic weapons and targeting systems. Modernization of the first batch was completed in March 2020.

=== Tu-116 ===


Designed as a stopgap in case the Tu-114A was not finished on time, two Tu-95 bombers were fitted with passenger compartments. Both aircraft had the same layout: office space, a passenger cabin consisting of two sections which could each accommodate 20 people in VIP seating, and the rest of the cabin configured as a normal airliner. Both aircraft were eventually used as crew ferries by the various Tu-95 squadrons. One of these machines is preserved at Ulyanovsk Central Airport.

=== Modernization ===

Starting in the 2000s, the Russian Air Force started to study different options for the modernisation of its Tu-95MS fleet. Even before the start of the modernisation program, in 2003 the aircraft were made compatible with the Kh-555 missile. Then, the proper modernisation program was initiated. Development officially started when a research and development contract was issued to Tupolev by the Russian Defence Ministry, on 23 December 2009. The modernisations are applied to only the Tu-95MS16s using the K-016 &quot;Sprut&quot; missile initialisation system, and not to the aircraft using the older K-012 &quot;Osina&quot; (the K-016 allows the use of longer-ranged Kh-55SM missiles); in other words, only the aircraft manufactured from 1986 onwards are modernised. In total, this represents a fleet of between 30 and 35 aircraft. The program is divided into two steps: the first one consists of making the aircraft compatible with Kh-101/102 cruise missiles. These are too big to fit in the internal missile bay; hence, new external hardpoints are added. A total of eight Kh-101/102s can be carried under four double missile pylons, in addition to six Kh-55/55SM/555s in the internal rotary missile launcher. Several pieces of equipment are also replaced in this first step of the modernisation, including the satellite signal reception system, the instrument landing system, and other navigation systems. The first Tu-95 modernized to carry the Kh-101/102 missiles was the Tu-95MS &quot;Saratov&quot;, rolled out at the Beriev aircraft plant in Taganrog in early 2015. It was transferred to the Russian Air Force in March 2015. Since 2015, the serial modernisation is carried out also by the Aviakor aircraft plant in Samara at a rate of three aircraft per year. The first Tu-95 modernized by Aviakor was the Tu-95MS &quot;Dubna&quot;, transferred to the Russian Aerospace Forces on 18 November 2015. In the future, Tu-95MSs are to be upgraded with the SVP-24 sighting and computing system from the Russian company Gefest &amp; T.

The second step of the modernisation program is also the most extensive one, and is known as Tu-95MSM. It includes the installation of the new Novella NV1.021 passive electronically scanned array radar instead of the current Obzor-MS, a new S021 navigation system and the Meteor-NM2 airborne defense complex. In addition, the aircraft modernized to the &quot;MSM&quot; variant will be equipped with upgraded Kuznetsov NK-12MPM turboprop engines, together with new AV-60T propellers, reducing the vibration level by 50%. Lastly, the tail turret has been removed. The first Tu-95MSM made its maiden flight on 22 August 2020. A new contract on upgrading Tu-95MS strategic missile-carrying bombers to the Tu-95MSM level was signed in August 2021.

== Operational history ==
=== Soviet Union ===

The Tu-95RTs variant in particular was a veritable icon of the Cold War as it performed a maritime surveillance and targeting mission for other aircraft, surface ships and submarines. It was identifiable by a large bulge under the fuselage, which reportedly housed a radar antenna that was used to search for and detect surface ships.

A series of nuclear surface tests were carried out by the Soviet Union in the early- to mid-1960s. On 30 October 1961, a modified Tu-95 carried and dropped the AN602 device named &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot;, the most powerful thermonuclear device ever detonated. Video footage of that particular test exists since the event was filmed for documentation purposes. The footage shows the specially adapted Tu-95V plane – painted with anti-flash white on its ventral surfaces – taking off carrying the bomb, in-flight scenes of the interior and exterior of the aircraft, and the detonation. The bomb was attached underneath the aircraft, which carried the weapon semi-externally since it could not be carried inside a standard Tu-95&#x27;s bomb bay, similar to the way the B.1 Special version of the Avro Lancaster did with the ten-tonne Grand Slam &quot;earthquake bomb&quot;. Along with the &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot;, the Tu-95 proved to be a versatile bomber that would deliver the RDS-4 Tatyana (a fission bomb with a yield of forty-two kilotons), RDS-6S thermonuclear bomb, the RDS-37 2.9-megaton thermonuclear bomb, and the RP-30-32 200-kiloton bomb.

The early versions of the bomber omitted crew amenities, with dank and dingy interiors lacking a toilet or a galley. Though flying the Tu-95 was uncomfortable, especially during the routine 10-hour mission trips twice a week, constant training ensured a high degree of combat readiness and around 1,200 flight-hours annually.

Due to the nature of their mission, Tu-95 bomber crews were often some of the best available in the Soviet Air Force. As part of their nuclear strike mission, bomber crews would undertake frequent missions into the Arctic to practice transpolar strikes against the United States. Unlike their American counterparts, however, Tu-95 aircraft did not fly missions carrying &quot;live&quot; nuclear weapons. This practice, a result of live ammunition being housed in special bunkers on the bases and a lengthy loading process (done via servicing trench below the bomb bay and taking up to two hours) was seen as a hindrance to overall mission readiness.

During the Falklands War Tu-95s carried out intelligence-gathering flights around Ascension Island.

=== Russia ===
In 1992, newly independent Kazakhstan began returning the Tu-95 aircraft of the 79th Heavy Bomber Aviation Division at Dolon air base to the Russian Federation. The bombers joined those already at the Far Eastern Ukrainka air base.

On 17 August 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia was resuming strategic aviation flights by sending its bombers on long-range patrols, a practice that had ended with the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Fighters from NATO members are often sent to intercept and escort Tu-95s as they perform their missions along the periphery of NATO airspace, often close to each other.

Russian Tu-95s reportedly took part in a naval exercise off the coasts of France and Spain in January 2008, alongside Tupolev Tu-22M3 &quot;Backfire&quot; strategic bombers and Beriev A-50 &quot;Mainstay&quot; airborne early-warning aircraft.

During the Russian Stability 2008 military exercise in October 2008, Tu-95MS aircraft fired live air-launched cruise missiles for the first time since 1984. The long range of the Kh-55 cruise missile means the Tu-95MS can once again serve as a strategic weapons system.

In July 2010, two Russian Tu-95MS set a world record for a non-stop flight for an aircraft in the class, spending more than 43 hours in the air. They flew through the Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific oceans as well as the Sea of Japan, covering in total more than with four mid-air refuelings. The primary goal of the endurance flight was to evaluate the performance of the aircraft during such a long flight, in particular monitoring the engines and other systems.

On 17 November 2015, Tu-95s had their combat debut, being employed for the first time in long-range airstrikes as part of the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War. On 17 November 2016, Tu-95MSs performed their first combat deployment, launching the Kh-101 cruise missiles on several militant positions in Syria.

On 5 December 2017, two Tu-95MSs and two Il-76MD transport aircraft landed for the first time at the Biak Air Base in Indonesia. The bombers covered more than with aerial refueling before landing at the air base. During the course of their visit, the Tu-95 crews conducted their first patrol flights over the southern Pacific, staying airborne for more than eight hours.

Tu-95MS/MSM bombers reportedly took part in the opening assault on Ukraine during the initial phase of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. On 6 March 2022, according to Ukrainian sources, Tu-95MS and Tu-160 strategic bombers launched eight cruise missiles, presumably the Kh-101, at the Havryshivka Vinnytsia International Airport from the Black Sea area. On 26 June 2022, spokesman of the Ukrainian Air Force Yurii Ihnat reported four to six Kh-101 cruise missiles were launched by Tu-95MS and Tu-160s at Kyiv from the Caspian Sea area. The bombers reportedly flew from Astrakhan.

On 5 December 2022, explosions were reported at two Russian airbases: the one at Engels-2 reportedly damaged two Tu-95s. Subsequently on 6 December satellite photos show that one Tu-95MS &quot;Bear-H&quot; had caught fire and had to be covered in foam. A Tu-22M was also damaged. The attack was carried out by modernised Tu-141 drones.

== Incidents ==
* On 8 June 2015, a Tu-95 engine caught fire while taking off from the Ukrainka airbase in Russia. As a result, one crew member was killed.

<doc id="896491" wikidata="Q808495" url="?curid=896491" title="Barnhouse Settlement">
<text>The Neolithic Barnhouse Settlement is sited by the shore of Loch of Harray, Orkney Mainland, Scotland, not far from the Standing Stones of Stenness, about 5 miles north-east of Stromness.

It was discovered in 1984 by Colin Richards. Excavations were conducted between 1986 and 1991, over time revealing the base courses of at least 15 houses. The houses have similarities to those of the early phase of the better-known settlement at Skara Brae in that they have central hearths, beds built against the walls and stone dressers, and internal drains, but differ in that the houses seem to have been free-standing. The settlement dates back to circa 3000 BC.

Pottery of the grooved ware type was found, as at the Stones of Stenness and Skara Brae. Flint and stone tools were found, as well as a piece of pitchstone thought to have come from the Isle of Arran.

The largest of the original buildings was &quot;House 2&quot;. It was double-sized, featuring a higher building standard than the other houses and unlike the others was rebuilt up to five times. &quot;House 2&quot; seems to have remained in use throughout the inhabited period of the settlement. The houses were clustered around a central open area which was divided into areas for making pottery and the working of flint, bones and hides. Evidence suggests that Barnhouse was abandoned around 2600 BC.

After Barnhouse ceased to be occupied, another structure was added, partially on top of the earlier building sites. Known as &quot;Structure 8&quot;, this building had a room about 7 m (23 ft) square with walls 3 m (10 ft) thick and an entrance facing towards the north west so that the midsummer sunset shines along the passageway, with similarities to some chambered cairns. The structure was surrounded by a clay platform. The entrance through this was aligned with Maeshowe. The structure is assumed to have served as a ceremonial site rather than as a dwelling. It is thought to be closely linked with the nearby Stones of Stenness. Some of the hearth slabs from the structure may have been moved to the Stones.

This site is accessible to the public via a footpath from the Standing Stones of Stenness.

<doc id="896494" wikidata="Q13012" url="?curid=896494" title="João Guimarães Rosa">
<text>João Guimarães Rosa (; 27 June 1908 – 19 November 1967) was a Brazilian novelist, short story writer, poet and diplomat.

Rosa only wrote one novel, &quot;Grande Sertão: Veredas&quot; (known in English as &quot;The Devil to Pay in the Backlands&quot;), a revolutionary text for its blend of archaic and colloquial prose and frequent use of neologisms, taking inspiration from the spoken language of the Brazilian backlands. For its profoundly philosophical themes, the critic Antonio Candido described the book as a &quot;metaphysical novel&quot;. It is often considered to be the Brazilian equivalent of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.In a 2002, poll by the Bokklubben World Library, &quot;Grande Sertão: Veredas&quot; was named among the best 100 books of all time. Rosa also published four books of short stories in his lifetime, all of them revolving around the life in the sertão, but also addressing themes of universal literature and of existential nature. He died in 1967 — the year he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature — due to a heart attack.

==Biography==
Guimarães Rosa was born in Cordisburgo in the state of Minas Gerais, the first of six children of Florduardo Pinto Rosa (nicknamed &quot;seu Fulô&quot;) and Francisca Guimarães Rosa (&quot;Chiquitinha&quot;). He was self-taught in many areas and studied several languages from childhood, starting with French before he was seven years old. He later claimed,

Still a child, he moved to his grandparents&#x27; house in Belo Horizonte, where he finished primary school. He began his secondary schooling at the Santo Antônio School in São João del-Rei, but soon returned to Belo Horizonte, where he graduated. In 1925, at only 16, he enrolled in the College of Medicine of Federal University of Minas Gerais.

On June 27, 1930, he married Lígia Cabral Penna, a sixteen-year-old girl, with whom he was to have two daughters, Vilma and Agnes. In that same year, he graduated and began his medical practice in Itaguara, where he stayed for nearly two years. In this town, Rosa had his first contact with elements from the sertão. With the break of the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, Guimarães Rosa served as a volunteer doctor of the Public Force (&quot;Força Pública&quot;) heading to the so-called Tunel sector in Passa-Quatro, Minas Gerais, where he came into contact with the future president Juscelino Kubitschek, at that time the chief doctor of the Blood Hospital (&quot;Hospital de Sangue&quot;). Later on, he became a civil servant through examination. In 1933, he went to Barbacena in the position of Doctor of the 9th Infantry Battalion. Rosa later recalled that the experiences from his time as a doctor and a soldier were significant for his formation as a writer.

In the following year, Rosa began his diplomatic career. In 1938, he served as assistant-consul in Hamburg, Germany, where he met his future second wife, Aracy de Carvalho Guimarães Rosa, the only Brazilian woman to be officially granted the title of Righteous among the nations for her assistance to Jews escaping the Third Reich.

In 1963, he was chosen by unanimous vote to enter the Brazilian Academy of Letters (&quot;Academia Brasileira de Letras&quot;) in his second candidacy. After postponing his acceptance for four years, he finally assumed his position in 1967, just three days before passing away in the city of Rio de Janeiro, victim of a heart attack, at the summit of his diplomatic and literary career.

==Work==
===&quot;Sagarana&quot;===
Although Guimarães Rosa began to write with poetry, his only volume of verse, “Magma”, was relinquished by the author and was only published posthumously. In turn, Rosa began pursuing a literary career by inscribing a collection of twelve short-novels in a contest, in 1938, whose jury was chaired by the then already prestigious Graciliano Ramos. The older writer denied him the first prize. Ramos himself later explained his devaluation of the first drafts of a work later known as &quot;Sagarana:&quot; in spite of the author&#x27;s talent and the many beauties of the collection, he thought that the uneven quality of the stories and their often exaggeratedly long passages resulted in a work that was incoherent and immature.
Guimarães Rosa extenuously reviewed his work, until finally considering it ready for publication only in 1946.

In its mature form, already noticeable in &quot;Sagarana&quot;, Rosa&#x27;s style vastly differs from that of Ramos. The latter&#x27;s succinct, dry expression is in harsh contrast with the former&#x27;s exuberance of detail and quality of language, rich in vocabulary and adventurous in its exploration of the grammar of the Portuguese language, qualities the Ramos himself would endow as his fellow writer&#x27;s greatest virtues.

“Sagarana” is a portmanteau word crafted from the union of “saga” (homonym in Portuguese for saga) and “rana” (Tupi for “in the manner of”), thus translating as “(stories) in the manner of folk legends”. The book is composed of nine short-novels, three less than the original version submitted to the contest eight years earlier. All of these find their setting in the sertão and nearly all revolve around the figure of the jagunço, a mercenary-like figure that serves as a militia to farmers and secures the order in the Brazilian backlands. Rosa, however, would craft this outlaw manner of living to a type of existential condition according to which bravery and faith are the two driving forces of life. Antonio Candido related this treatment to a view of the jagunço that was inspired by the medieval knights and their values.

Rosa brings to his narratives the regional aspects of the &quot;sertão&quot;. His use of language closely follows the dialect of the &quot;sertanejos&quot; – inhabitants of the &quot;sertão&quot;–, employing regional terms and variations of words, as well as borrowing their traditions and customs. Furthermore, he takes advantage of the geography and the wildlife of the sertão to structure the stories. Vivid descriptions of landscapes (most notably in the short-novel &quot;São Marcos&quot;, “Saint Mark”, where mystical lore of popular witchcraft and the vividness of nature are blended together) and animals, especially bird flocks and groups of cattle, populate the pages of the book, not only in an attempt to capture the backdrop of the geographic &quot;sertão&quot;, but also in close correspondence with the plot of the stories and as an extended metaphor for the solitude of man and his pursuit of transcendence. This is not, however, limited to the content of his stories. The noted narrative &quot;O Burrinho Pedrês&quot; (&quot;The Brindled Donkey&quot;), for example, contains anthological passages where Rosa intensely manipulates the sonority of the sentences, whether mimicking the metric of the traditional verse-form of the popular songs of the sertão or employing onomatopoeia and alliteration and juxtaposing several words that relate to the field of cattle breeding to textually recreate the sounds of the passing herds. Rosa would sustain and develop these characteristics through his later work.

The most prestigious of these stories is the last, &quot;A Hora e Vez de Augusto Matraga&quot; (“The Time and Turn of Augusto Matraga”), referred to by Rosa as a sort of “key&quot; to the collection 

The hagiography of a worldly man, it recounts the redemption of a wealthy farm-owner named Augusto Esteves, or Nhô Augusto, a vicious person likened to all sorts of debauchery, who is betrayed and beat to nearly death, being finally left stranded in the deserted backlands and marked with a branding iron. Two old &quot;sertanejos&quot; rescue him and give him cares in their house; during his convalescence, a priest administers blessings to him and promises the violated man that all persons are intended to a particular and decisive moment of salvation. Once cured, he proclaims his wish to go to heaven &quot;nem que seja a porrete&quot; (&quot;even though by a cudgel&quot;), and engages vigorously in farm working and good deeds and finds the companionship and friendliness of the jagunço leader Seu Joaõzinho Bem-Bem, who, reckoning the man&#x27;s vocation to arms, invites him to his group, an offer which Nhô Augusto refuses in order to comply with his wish of ascending towards God.

Rosa later describes a scene where the explendour of nature is revealed to him through the bright colors of the flowers and the liberty of the birds. Affected by this revelation, Augusto departs to wander through the &quot;sertão&quot; in search of his “time and turn”. His demand only finds completion through a fight to death with the very leader of jagunços he once befriended. It is through a violent insurgence against what he sees as an unjust deed performed by the jagunços that Nhô Angusto ascends to a saint-like contention.

===&quot;Corpo de Baile&quot;===

Guimarães Rosa next book was &quot;Corpo de Baile&quot; (roughly, &quot;Corps de Ballet&quot;), published then years later, in 1956. For the second edition, the collection was divided into three parts, now usually published separatedly: &quot;Noites do Sertão&quot; (“Nights of the Sertão”); &quot;Manuelzão e Miguelim&quot; (a play on words with the names of two characters from the stories, using Portuguese augmentative and diminutive suffixes, translating reasonably as “Big Manuel and Little Miguel”); and, “No Urubuquaquá, no Pinhém” (“In the Urubuquaquá, in the Pinhém”, the names being locations in the stories).

Such policy of publication, although authorized by the author himself, breaks the original structure of the book, whose complexity is often remarked. The very name of the collection points to this fact: the &quot;corps de ballet&quot; it refers to are the conjunction of symbols and ideias that figure repeatedly across the seven short-novels, reappearing here and there in this or that manner in order to gain yet another level of meaning. This &quot;dancing&quot; of motifs and metaphors takes place inside and outside of the stories. Among them, Rosa notably elects figures from astrology to compose and ordinate the plots and the relations between themselves, crafting a book-long sequence of a single meaning. Such progress is mimicked by the story &quot;Recado do Morro&quot; (&quot;Message from the Hills&quot;), which, accordingly, occupied the middle of the book, being the fourth story in the original publication.
&quot;Recado do Morro&quot; is also significant in its treatment of the ideia of a language of the &quot;sertão&quot; itself. In the story, a group of five sertanejos is escorting a German naturalist in an expedition through the state of Minas Gerais. Parallel to their own discovery of the &quot;sertão&quot;, another journey is recounted, following step by step the march of the travelers: that of a message given by the very backlands that is spread unpretensiously, much in the manner of an anecdote, by the marginal members of the region&#x27;s society. First heard from a hill by a madman who lives in the caves of the backlands, he recounts the message to his brother, an impoverished traveler, who, by his turns, tells the message to a child. /The child proceeds to tell the message to a travel guide, the guide to a prophetic hermit, who takes it to be a sign of the Revelation and lavishly repeats the message to a city&#x27;s congregation; it is then heard by a neurotic man who, finally, recounts it to the poet and singer Laudelim. Each time the message is told, its conveyors slightly alter its contents, until the poet ultimately gives it the form a mythical ballad, which he sings at a party attended by the expedition members. Only then it becomes clear that the message all along was a warning to their leader, Pedro Orósio.

Pedro, a handsome and viril man, is altogether hated for the relations he maintains with the wives of the other sertanejos. The men who he has fooled intended to have their revenge by letting him drunk and subsequently murdering him. Upon listening to the ballad, Pedro Orósio understands its hermetic symbolism to refer to himself and his pretentious men, which proves to be correct, and he is capable of saving his life after being warned by the &quot;message of the hill&quot;.

One can see here an illustration by Guimarães Rosa of how he himself understood his writing. Rosa intervenes the descriptions of the landscapes found by the German man&#x27;s expedition with the successive versions of the story that the madmen, the child and finally the poet retell. Thus, he describes how a certain knowledge presented in nature is captured and mysteriously understood by those naïve or lunatic figures – something which is further established in &quot;Campo Geral&quot; – and becomes comprehensible through a poetic treatment, while accompanying a scientific discovery of the &quot;sertão&quot;, a discovery that is incapable of revealing the true secrecies it uncovers.

===&quot;Grande Sertão: Veredas&quot;===

Rosa published his masterpiece, &quot;Grande Sertão: Veredas&quot; (literally, “Great Backlands: Paths”, but translated as &quot;The Devil to Pay in the Backlands&quot;, to Guimarães Rosa&#x27;s disapproval
) in the same year. His sole novel, the book began as yet another short-novel that he continuously expanded and is written in the form of a monologue by the jagunço Riobaldo, who details his life to an educated listener, whose identity, while unknown, defines him as an urban man. Riobaldo mixes the wars of the jagunços, which form the most straightforward part of the novel&#x27;s plot, with his musings on life, the existence of God and the Devil – his greatest concern –, the nature of human feelings and the passage of time and memory, as well as several short anecdotes, often allegories illustrating a point raised in his narrative.

The book can be seen, as it was by the author, as an adaptation of the faustian motif to the sertão. Riobaldo&#x27;s account frequently returns to the central topic of his discourse, which he proclaims as the reason for his telling his life-story, as he expects, albeit ironically so, an answer from his listener: whether or not the Devil, and therefore evil, exists. Riobaldo is anguished by the idea he may have conducted a pact with the Devil, although he is uncertain, and he often dismisses the superstitions and beliefs of the &quot;sertanejos&quot; as stupidities. The interpretation of this supposed pact vary widely. Antonio Candido viewed it as an act of self-assurance, a symbolic deed by which Riobaldo can take hold of himself and of all his potential, something which allows him to become a powerful warrior who can extend vastly the power of his gang and avenge the betrayal of Joca Ramiro. In this, Candido insists, the pact is analogous to the initiation rites of the chivalric romances, through which the wan childe becomes a worthy knight. Willi Bolle, on the other hand, in a materialistic view of the book, which he considers to demonstrate the formation of the social order in the &quot;sertão&quot;, sees the pact as an attempt by Riobaldo to socially ascend from his condition of a poor jagunço to the upper class of the rich farmers, an ascension which is the actual conclusion of the book.

All this is conducted by the motif of the star-crossed love affair. Riobaldo is torn between two contrasting loves: Diadorim, another &quot;jagunço&quot;, to whom he refers as a “demoniac love”, and Otacília, an ordinary beauty from the backlands, a godly love for times of peace. He has the company of Diadorim for most of his life, though their love remains unconsummated, but unites with Otacília only once his days as a jagunço are over and behind.

The matter of the Diadorim&#x27;s identity is highly problematic. Though a woman, Diadorim passes off as a man, under the name of Reinaldo, to enter the male-exclusive world of the jagunços. Her true gender is only revealed to Riobaldo after her death. This points to a frequent theme of Riobaldo&#x27;s mussings: the inconstancy of things. According to Walnice Galvão, Riobaldo seems to reason that nothing ever is nor remains, but inside everything is its potential negation, which might easily suppress its anterior positive form. This fact is recounted several times by Riobaldo, often in sensorial metaphors, such as his description of poisonous rocks lying in the bottom of a clear river, or the stories he recounts of good men becoming vile and vile men becoming good. To her, the pact must be seen, in accordance with his perception, as an agreement with evil that results in great accomplishments and personal growth and a subsequent approximation towards God.

Furthermore, the novel might be seen as an attempt of memory, and therefore his speech, to retrieve that which has been irrevocably lost and attach personal meaning to it. Reality, therefore, becomes only a linguistic construction, made possible by the interaction of two persons. The novel closes with the sentence: “Travessia. O homem humano.” (“Crossing. The human human-being.”) followed by the symbol of infinity, a nod to the never-ending extension of life and its retelling.

===Later works===

&quot;Grande Sertão: Veredas&quot; was followed by &quot;Primeiras Estórias&quot; (“First Stories”), a collection of twenty-one short-stories, published in 1962. Very famous among these is &quot;A Terceira Margem do Rio&quot; (lit., “The Third Bank of the River”) made into a film of the same name and the inspiration behind a homonymous song by Caetano Veloso. The story, addressing the themes peculiar to Rosa&#x27;s oeuvre and told in first person from the point of view of an observer, recounts the absurd event of a man who decides to live inside a boat in the middle of a water stream, giving no explanation for his actions nor achieving, apparently, anything with it.

His last collection published in life was &quot;Tutameia – Terceiras Estórias&quot; (“Tutameia – Third Stories”), “tuttameia” being a neologism that breaks up as “butterfly&#x27;s skeleton”, roughly meaning “ninharia”, or &quot;something of low value&quot;.

Two posthumous works followed: &quot;Estas Estórias&quot; (“These Stories”), another collection of short-novels, and ‘’Ave, Palavra’’ (a pun on the double-meaning of the word “ave”, which signifies both bird and an archaic salutation, being translated literally as “Bird, Word” or “Hail, Word”), a work of miscellany, compromising short-stories, poems, journal entries and travel notations.

<text>A magazine, often simply called a mag, is an ammunition storage and feeding device for a repeating firearm, either integral within the gun (internal/fixed magazine) or externally attached (detachable magazine). The magazine functions by holding several cartridges within itself and sequentially pushing each one into a position where it may be readily loaded into the barrel chamber by the firearm&#x27;s moving action. The detachable magazine is sometimes colloquially referred to as a &quot;clip&quot;, although this is technically inaccurate since a clip is actually an accessory device used to help load ammunition into a magazine or cylinder.

Magazines come in many shapes and sizes, from integral tubular magazines on lever-action and pump-action rifles and shotguns, that may hold more than five rounds, to detachable box magazines and drum magazines for automatic rifles and light machine guns, that may hold more than fifty rounds. Various jurisdictions ban what they define as &quot;high-capacity magazines&quot;.

==Nomenclature==

With the increased use of semi-automatic and automatic firearms, the detachable magazine became increasingly common. Soon after the adoption of the M1911 pistol, the term &quot;magazine&quot; was settled on by the military and firearms experts. Although the term &quot;clip&quot; is often used to refer to detachable (never fixed) magazines, this usage remains a point of strong contention. The defining difference between a clip and a magazine is the presence of a feed mechanism, typically a spring-loaded follower, which a clip lacks. Whereas a magazine consists of four parts — a spring, a spring follower, a body, and a base — a clip may be constructed of one continuous piece of stamped metal and contain no moving parts. Examples of clips include moon clips for revolvers; &quot;stripper&quot; clips, such those used in association with speedloaders for military (e.g., 5.56×45mm NATO) ammunition; and &quot;en bloc&quot; clips for M1 Garand rifles.

==History==
The earliest firearms were loaded with loose powder and a lead ball, and to fire more than a single shot without reloading required multiple barrels, such as in pepper-box guns, double-barreled rifles, double-barreled shotguns, or multiple chambers, such as in revolvers. The main problem with these solutions is that they increase the bulk and/or weight of a firearm, over a firearm with a single barrel and/or single chamber. However, many attempts were made to get multiple shots from loading a single barrel through the use of superposed loads. While some early repeaters such as the Kalthoff repeater managed to operate using complex systems with multiple feed sources for ball, powder, and primer, easily mass-produced repeating mechanisms did not appear until self-contained cartridges were developed in the 19th century.

===Early tubular magazines===

The first successful mass-produced repeating weapon to use a &quot;tubular magazine&quot; permanently mounted to the weapon was the Austrian Army&#x27;s Girandoni air rifle, first produced in 1779.

The first mass-produced repeating firearm was the Volcanic Rifle which used a hollow bullet with the base filled with powder and primer fed into the chamber from a tube called a &quot;magazine&quot; with an integral spring to push the cartridges in to the action, thence to be loaded into the chamber and fired. It was named after a building or room used to store ammunition. The anemic power of the Rocket Ball ammunition used in the Volcanic doomed it to limited popularity..

The Henry repeating rifle is a lever-action, breech-loading, tubular magazine-fed repeating rifle, and was an improved version of the earlier Volcanic rifle. Designed by Benjamin Tyler Henry in 1860, it was one of the first firearms to use self-contained metallic cartridges. The Henry was introduced in 1860 and was in production until 1866 in the United States by the New Haven Arms Company. It was adopted in small quantities by the Union Army in the American Civil War and was favored for its greater firepower than the standard issue carbine. Many later found their way Westward and was famed both for its use at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and being the basis for the iconic Winchester lever-action repeating rifle, which is still in production to the present day. The Henry and Winchester rifles would go on to see service with a number of militaries including Turkey. Switzerland and Italy adopted similar designs.

The second magazine-fed firearm to achieve widespread success was the Spencer repeating rifle, which saw service in the American Civil War. The Spencer used a tubular magazine located in the butt of the gun instead of under the barrel and it used new rimfire metallic cartridges. The Spencer was successful, but the rimfire ammunition did occasionally ignite in the magazine tube and destroy the magazine. It could also injure the user.

The new bolt-action rifles began to gain favor with militaries in the mid-1880s and were often equipped with tubular magazines. The Mauser Model 1871 was originally a single-shot action that added a tubular magazine in its 1884 update. The Norwegian Jarmann M1884 was adopted in 1884 and also used a tubular magazine. The French Lebel Model 1886 rifle also used 8-round tubular magazine.

Tubular magazines remain common on many makes and models of shotgun.

===Integral box magazines===
The military cartridge was evolving as the magazine rifle evolved. Cartridges evolved from large-bore cartridges (.40 caliber/10 mm and larger) to smaller bores that fired lighter, higher-velocity bullets and incorporated new smokeless propellants. The Lebel Model 1886 rifle was the first rifle and cartridge to be designed for use with smokeless powder and used an 8 mm wadcutter-shaped bullet that was drawn from a tubular magazine. This would later become a problem when the Lebel&#x27;s ammunition was updated to use a more aerodynamic pointed bullet. Modifications had to be made to the centerfire case to prevent the spitzer point from igniting the primer of the next cartridge inline in the magazine through recoil or simply rough handling. This remains a concern with lever-action firearms today.

Two early box magazine patents were the ones by Rollin White in 1855 and William Harding in 1859. A detachable box magazine was patented in 1864 by the American Robert Wilson. Unlike later box magazines this magazine fed into a tube magazine and was located in the stock of the gun. Another box magazine, closer to the modern type though non-detachable, was patented in Britain (No. 483) by Mowbray Walker, George Henry Money and Francis Little in 1867. James Paris Lee patented a box magazine which held rounds stacked vertically in 1875, 1879 and 1882 and it was first adopted by Austria in the form of an 11mm straight-pull bolt-action rifle, the Mannlicher M1886. It also used a cartridge clip which held 5 rounds ready to load into the magazine. One of the first detachable box magazines with a double-stack staggered-feed was the Schmidt-Rubin of 1889. Other examples include the patent of Fritz von Stepski and Erich Sterzinger of Austria-Hungary in May 1888 and the British patents by George Vincent Fosbery in 1883 and 1884. James Paris Lee is sometimes claimed to have invented the double-stack, staggered-feed detachable box magazine but he didn&#x27;t design one until 1892 for the Mark II Lee-Metford, three years after the Schmidt-Rubin. The first pistol with a double-stack, staggered-feed magazine was the Mauser C96 although it was an integral design fed by stripper clips. The first detachable double-stack, single-feed magazine for pistols was probably the one patented by the American Elbert H. Searle in 1904 and adopted by Arthur Savage though he didn&#x27;t apply it in practice to his designs until much later. One of the first double-stack, single-feed box magazines was patented in November 1888 by an English inventor called Joseph James Speed of Waltham Cross. Another was patented in May 1887 by the Austro-Hungarian Karl Krnka.


The bolt-action Krag–Jørgensen rifle, designed in Norway in 1886, used a unique rotary magazine that was built into the receiver. Like Lee&#x27;s box magazine, the rotary magazine held the rounds side-by-side, rather than end-to-end. Like most rotary magazines, it was loaded through a loading gate one round at a time, this one located on the side of the receiver. While reliable, the Krag–Jørgensen&#x27;s magazine was expensive to produce and slow to reload. It was adopted by only three countries, Denmark in 1889, the United States in 1892, and Norway in 1894.

====Clip-fed revolution====
A clip (called a &quot;charger&quot; in the United Kingdom) is a device that is used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into the magazine or cylinder of a firearm. This speeds up the process of reloading the firearm as several rounds can be loaded at once, rather than one round being loaded at a time. Several different types of clips exist, most of which are made of inexpensive metal stampings that are designed to be disposable, though they are often re-used.

The first clips used were of the &quot;en bloc&quot; variety, developed by Ferdinand Mannlicher and first adopted by the Austro-Hungarian Army, which would be used Austro-Hungarians during the first world war in the form of the Mannlicher M1895, derivatives of which would be adopted by many national militaries. The Germans used this system for their Model 1888 Commission Rifle, featuring a 5-round &quot;en bloc&quot; clip-fed internal box magazine. One problem with the &quot;en bloc&quot; system is that the firearm cannot be practically used without a ready supply of (mostly disposable) clips. Paul Mauser would solve this problem by introducing a stripper clip that functioned only to assist the user in loading the magazine quickly: it was not required to load the magazine to full capacity. He would continue to make improved models of rifles that took advantage of this new clip design from 1889 through 1898 in various calibers that proved enormously successful, and were adopted by a wide range of national militaries. In 1890 the French adopted the 8mm Lebel Berthier rifles with 3-round internal magazines, fed from &quot;en bloc&quot; clips; the empty clips were pushed from the bottom of the action by the insertion of a loaded clip from the top.

In the late 19th century, there were many short-lived designs, such as the M1895 Lee Navy and Gewehr 1888, eventually replaced by the M1903 Springfield rifle and Gewehr 98 respectively. The Russian Mosin–Nagant, adopted in 1891, was an exception. It was not revolutionary; it was a bolt-action rifle, used a small-bore smokeless powder cartridge, and a fixed box magazine loaded from the top with stripper clips, all of which were features that were used in earlier military rifles. What made the Nagant stand out was that it combined all the earlier features in a form that was to last virtually unchanged from its issue by Russia in 1894 through World War II and with its sniper rifle variants still in use today.

====Magazine cut-off====
A feature of many late 19th and early 20th century bolt-action rifles was the magazine cut-off, sometimes called a feed interrupter. This was a mechanical device that prevented the rifle from loading a round from the magazine, requiring the shooter to manually load each individual round as he fired, saving the rounds in the magazine for short periods of rapid fire when ordered to use them. Most military authorities that specified them assumed that their riflemen would waste ammunition indiscriminately if allowed to load from the magazine all the time. By the mid-20th century, most manufacturers deleted this feature to save costs and manufacturing time; it is also likely that battlefield experience had proven the futility of this philosophy.

====Final fixed-magazine developments====
One of the last new clip-fed, fixed-magazine rifles widely adopted that was not a modification of an earlier rifle was the M1 Garand. The M1 Garand was the first gas-operated semi-automatic rifle adopted and issued in large numbers as the standard service rifle of any military in the world. The M1 Garand was fed by a special eight-round &quot;en bloc&quot; clip. The clip itself was inserted into the rifle&#x27;s magazine during loading, where it was locked in place. The rounds were fed directly from the clip, with a spring-loaded follower in the rifle pushing the rounds up into feeding position. When empty, the bolt would lock open, and a spring would automatically eject the empty clip with a distinctive pinging sound, leaving the rifle ready to be quickly reloaded. The M14 rifle, which was based on incremental changes to the Garand action, switched to a detachable box magazine. However, the M14 with magazine attached could also be loaded via 5-round stripper-clips.

The Soviet SKS carbine, which entered service in 1945, was something of a stopgap between the semi-automatic service rifles being developed in the period leading up to World War II, and the new assault rifle developed by the Germans. The SKS used a fixed magazine, holding ten rounds and fed by a conventional stripper clip. It was a modification of the earlier AVS-36 rifle, shortened and chambered for the new reduced power 7.62×39mm cartridge. It was rendered obsolete for military use almost immediately by the 1947 introduction of the magazine-fed AK-47 assault rifle, though it remained in service for many years in Soviet Bloc nations alongside the AK-47. The detachable magazine quickly came to dominate post-war military rifle designs.

===Detachable box magazines===

Firearms using detachable magazines are made with an opening known as a &quot;magazine well&quot; into which the detachable magazine is inserted. The magazine well locks the magazine in position for feeding cartridges into the chamber of the firearm, and requires a device known as a magazine release to allow the magazine to be separated from the firearm.

The Lee–Metford rifle, developed in 1888, was one of the first rifles to use a detachable box magazine, and the spare one could be optionally worn on soldier equipment, although with the adoption of the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield Mk I this became only detachable for cleaning and not swapped to reload the weapon. However, the first completely modern removable box magazine was patented in 1908 by Arthur Savage for the Savage Model 99 (1899), although it was not implemented on the 99 until 1965. James Paris Lee&#x27;s patent of November 4, 1879, Number 221,328 would have been before Arthur Savage&#x27;s magazine. Lee&#x27;s magazine was also used on the Remington Lee model 1899 factory sporting rifle. Other guns did not adopt all of its features until his patent expired in 1942: It has shoulders to retain cartridges when it is removed from the rifle. It operates reliably with cartridges of different lengths. It is insertable and removable at any time with any number of cartridges. These features allow the operator to reload the gun infrequently, carry magazines rather than loose cartridges, and to easily change the types of cartridges in the field. The magazine is assembled from inexpensive stamped sheet metal. It also includes a crucial safety feature for hunting dangerous game: when empty the follower stops the bolt from engaging the chamber, informing the operator that the gun is empty before any attempt to fire.

The first successful semi-automatic pistol was the Borchardt C-93 (1893) and incorporated detachable box magazines. Nearly all subsequent semiautomatic pistol designs adopted detachable box magazines.

The Swiss Army evaluated the Luger pistol using a detachable box magazine in 7.65×21mm Parabellum and adopted it in 1900 as its standard sidearm. The Luger pistol was accepted by the Imperial German Navy in 1904. This version is known as Pistole 04 (or P.04). In 1908 the German Army adopted the Luger to replace the Reichsrevolver in front-line service. The Pistole 08 (or P.08) was chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum. The P.08 was the usual side arm for German Army personnel in both World Wars.

The M1911 semi-automatic pistol set the standard for most modern handguns and likewise the mechanics of the handgun magazine. In most handguns the magazine follower engages a slide-stop to hold the slide back and keep the firearm out of battery when the magazine is empty and all rounds fired. Upon inserting a loaded magazine, the user depresses the slide stop, throwing the slide forward, stripping a round from the top of the magazine stack and chambering it. In single-action pistols this action keeps the hammer cocked back as the new round is chambered, keeping the gun ready to begin firing again.

During World War One, detachable box magazines found favor, being used in all manner of firearms, such as pistols, light-machine guns, submachine guns, semi-automatic and automatic rifles. However, after the War to End All Wars, military planners failed to recognize the importance of automatic rifles and detachable box magazine concept, and instead maintained their traditional views and preference for clip-fed bolt-action rifles. As a result, many promising new automatic rifle designs that used detachable box magazines were abandoned. An important development that took place during this war was the invention of Schmeisser&#x27;s Cone in 1916 by Hugo Schmeisser which allowed high-capacity double-stack, single-feed box magazine using guns to function reliably although it wasn&#x27;t implemented on any of his designs until after World War One. The first reliable high-capacity double-stack, staggered-feed box magazine was developed by an American designer called Oscar V. Payne for the Thompson submachine gun around the same time as Schmeisser&#x27;s Cone.

As World War II loomed, most of the world&#x27;s major powers began to develop submachine guns fed by 20- to 40-round detachable box magazines. However, of the major powers, only the United States would adopt a general-issue semi-automatic rifle that used detachable box magazines: the M1 carbine with its 15-round magazines. As the war progressed the Germans developed the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle concept with its 30-round detachable magazine. After WWII, automatic weapons using detachable box magazines were developed and used by all of the world&#x27;s armies. Today, detachable box magazines are the norm and they are so widely used that they are simply referred to as magazines or &quot;mags&quot; for short.

==Function and types==

All cartridge-based single-barrel firearms designed to fire more than a single round of ammunition without manual reloading require some form of magazine designed to store and feed cartridges into the firearm&#x27;s action. Magazines come in many shapes and sizes, with the most common type in modern firearms being the detachable box type. Most magazines designed for use with a reciprocating bolt firearm (tube fed firearms being the exception) make use of a set of feed lips which stop the vertical motion of the cartridges out of the magazine but allow one cartridge at a time to be pushed forward (stripped) out of the feed lips by the firearm&#x27;s bolt into the chamber. Some form of spring and follower combination is almost always used to feed cartridges to the lips which can be located either in the magazine (most removable box magazines) or built into the firearm (fixed box magazines). There are also two distinct styles to feed lips. In a single-feed design the top cartridge touches both lips and is commonly used in single-column box magazines, while a staggered feed magazine (sometimes called &quot;double-feed&quot; magazine, not to be confused with the firearm malfunction) consists of a wider set of lips so that the second cartridge in line forces the top cartridge against one of the lips. The staggered-feed design has proven more resistant to jamming in use with double-column magazines than single-feed variants, since the narrowing of a magazine tube to a single-feed induces extra friction which the magazine springs needs to overcome. Some magazine types are strongly associated with certain firearm types, such as the fixed &quot;tubular&quot; magazine found on most modern lever-action rifles and pump-action shotguns. A firearm using detachable magazines may accept a variety of types of magazine, such as the Thompson submachine gun, most variations of which would accept box or drum magazines. Some types of firearm, such as the M249 and other squad automatic weapons, can feed from both magazines and belts.

===Tubular===
Many of the first repeating rifles and shotguns, particularly lever-action rifles and pump-action shotguns, used magazines that stored cartridges nose-to-end inside of a spring-loaded tube that typically runs parallel underneath the barrel, or inside of the buttstock. Tubular magazines are also commonly used in .22 caliber bolt-action rimfire rifles, such as the Marlin Model XT. Tubular magazines and centerfire cartridges with pointed (spitzer) bullets present a safety issue: a pointed bullet may (through the forces of recoil or simply rough handling) strike the next round&#x27;s primer and ignite that round, or even cause a chain ignition of other rounds, within the magazine. The Winchester Model 1873 used blunt-nosed centerfire cartridges as the .44-40 Winchester. Certain modern rifle cartridges using soft pointed plastic tips have been designed to avoid this problem while improving the aerodynamic qualities of the bullet to match those available in bolt-action designs, therefore extending the effective range of lever-actions.

===Box===
The most popular type of magazine in modern rifles and handguns, a box magazine stores cartridges in a column, either one above the other or in staggered zigzag fashion. This zigzag stack is often identified as a &quot;double-column&quot; or &quot;double-stack&quot; (The double-stack is much more common because of its ability to store more rounds), since a staggered column is actually two single side-by-side vertical columns offset by half of the diameter of a round. As the firearm cycles, cartridges are moved to the top of the magazine by a follower driven by spring compression to either a single-feed (center-feed) position or side-by-side (staggered-feed) positions. Box magazines may be integral to the firearm or removable:
* An &quot;internal box&quot;, &quot;integral box&quot; or &quot;fixed&quot; magazine (also known as a &quot;blind&quot; box magazine when lacking a floorplate) is built into the firearm and is not easily removable. This type of magazine is found most often on bolt-action rifles. An internal box magazine is usually charged through the action, one round at a time. Military rifles often use stripper clips, a.k.a. chargers, permitting multiple rounds, commonly 5 or 10 at a time, to be loaded in rapid sequence. Some internal box magazines use &quot;en bloc&quot; clips that are loaded into the magazine with the ammunition and that are ejected from the firearm when empty.
* A &quot;detachable box&quot; magazine is a self-contained mechanism capable of being loaded or unloaded while detached from the host firearm. They are attached via a slot in the firearm receiver, usually below the action, to the side of the action, or on top of the action. When necessary, the magazine can easily be detached from the firearm and replaced by another. This significantly speeds the process of reloading, allowing the operator quick access to ammunition. This type of magazine may be straight or curved, the curve being necessary if the rifle uses rimmed ammunition or ammunition with a tapered case. Detachable box magazines may be metal or plastic. The plastic magazines are sometimes partially transparent so the operator can easily check the remaining ammunition. Box magazines are often affixed to each other with clamps, clips, tape, straps, or built-in studs to facilitate faster reloading: see jungle style.

There are, however, exceptions to these rules. The Lee–Enfield rifle had a detachable box magazine only to facilitate cleaning. The Lee–Enfield magazine did open, permitting rapid unloading of the magazine without having to operate the bolt-action repeatedly to unload the magazine. Other designs, like the Breda Modello 30, had a fixed protruding magazine from the right side that resembled a conventional detachable box, but it was non-detachable and only reloaded by using 20 round stripper clips.

Box magazines may come in straight, angled, or curved forms depending if the cartridges are tapered rimmed/rimless or bottlenecked. Straight or slightly curved magazines work well with straight-sided rimless cartridges, angled magazines work well with straight-sided rimmed/rimless cartridges and curved magazines work well with rimmed/rimless tapered cartridges.

Pistol magazines are often single- or double-stack with single-feed, which may be due to this design being slimmer at the top which can simplify the design of the pistol frame with regards to grip thickness. 

====Horizontal====

The FN P90, Kel-Tec P50, and AR-57 personal defense weapons use horizontally mounted feeding systems. The magazine sits parallel to the barrel, fitting flush with the top of the receiver, and the ammunition is rotated 90 degrees by a spiral feed ramp before being chambered. The Heckler &amp; Koch G11, an experimental assault rifle that implements caseless ammunition, also functions similarly with the magazine aligned horizontally over the barrel. Rather than being positioned laterally to the barrel like with the aforementioned examples, ammunition is positioned vertically with the bullet facing downward at a 90-degree angle relative to the barrel where it is fed into a rotary chamber before firing. The AR-57, also known as the AR Five-seven, is an upper receiver for the AR-15 rifle lower receiver, firing FN 5.7×28mm rounds from standard FN P90 magazines.

====Casket====
Another form of box magazine, sometimes referred to as a &quot;quad-column&quot;, can hold a large amount of ammunition. It is wider than a standard box magazine, but retains the same length. Casket magazines can be found on the Suomi KP/-31, Hafdasa C-4, Spectre M4, QCW-05 and on 5.45×39mm AK rifle derivatives, and now the Kel-Tec CP33 as well. Magpul has been granted a patent for a STANAG-compatible casket magazine, and such a magazine was also debuted by SureFire in December 2010, and is now sold as the MAG5-60 and MAG5-100 high capacity magazine (HCM) in 60 and 100 round capacities, respectively, in 5.56mm for AR-15 compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept STANAG 4179 magazines. Izhmash has also developed a casket magazine for the AK-12. Desert Tech have also released the QMAG-53 compatible Quattro-15 lower receiver for the AR-15.

====Tandem====
A tandem magazine is a type of box magazine with another magazine placed in front. When firing, the bolt travels further back past the front section magazine until the rear section is empty, then uses the front section. Firearms using tandem magazines are the Special Purpose Individual Weapon (SPIW) and Gerasimenko VAG-73.

===Rotary===
The rotary (or spool) magazine consists of a cylindrical sprocket actuated by a torsion spring, with cartridges fitting between the tooth bar of the sprocket, which is mounted on a spindle parallel to the bore axis and rotates each round sequentially into the feeding position. Rotary magazines may be fixed or detachable, and are usually of low capacity, generally 5 to 10 rounds, depending on the caliber used. John Smith patented a rotary magazine in 1856. Another rotary magazine was produced by Sylvester Roper in 1866 and was also used in the weapons by Anton Spitalsky and the Savage Model 1892. Otto Schönauer first patented a spool magazine in 1886 and his later design, patented in 1900, was used on bolt-action rifles produced at least until 1979, among them Mannlicher–Schönauer adopted by the Greek Army in 1903. The M1941 Johnson rifle also uses a rotary magazine. The design is still used in some modern firearms, most notably the Ruger American series, the semi-automatic Ruger 10/22, the bolt-action Ruger 77/22 and the Steyr SSG 69.

====Capsule====
A capsule magazine functions similar to a box magazine, but the spring and follower is stowed away when the magazine bottom is flipped open. The cartridges are loosely dumped into the magazine and spring-fed to the chamber when the bottom is closed.
On the Krag-Jørgensen the magazine is wrapped around the bolt-action to save vertical space and ease loading from the side.

The Krag-Jorgensen bolt-action rifle is the only firearm to use this type of magazine and it was adopted by the militaries of Denmark, Norway, and the United States in the late 19th century.

===Drum===

Drum magazines are used primarily for light machine guns. In one type, a moving partition within a cylindrical chamber forces loose rounds into an exit slot, with the cartridges being stored parallel to the axis of rotation. After loading of the magazine, a wound spring or other mechanism forces the partition against the rounds. In all models a single column is pushed by a follower through a curved path. From there the rounds enter the vertical riser either from a single or dual drums. Cylindrical designs such as rotary and drum magazines allow for larger capacity than box magazines, without growing to excessive length. The downside of a drum magazine&#x27;s extra capacity is its added weight that, combined with the gun, can affect handling and prolonged use. Drum magazines can be more difficult to incorporate into combat gear compared to more regular, rectangular box magazines.

Many drum-fed firearms can also load from conventional box magazines, such as the Soviet PPSh-41 submachine gun, RPK light machine gun, and the American Thompson submachine gun.

The term &quot;drum&quot; is sometimes applied to a belt box for a belt-fed machine gun, though this is just a case that houses a length of ammunition belt, not a drum magazine.

====Saddle-drum====
Before WWII the Germans developed 75-round saddle-drum magazines for use in their MG 13 and MG 15 machine guns. The MG 34 machine guns could also use saddle-drum magazine when fitted with a special feed cover. The 75 rounds of ammunition were evenly distributed in each side of the magazine with a central feed &quot;tower&quot; where the ammunition is fed to the bolt. The ammunition was fed by a spring force, with rounds alternating from each side of the double drum so that the gun would not become unbalanced.

===Pan===
Pan magazines differ from other circular magazines in that the cartridges are stored perpendicular to the axis of rotation, rather than being parallel, and are usually mounted on top of the firearm. This type is used on the Lewis Gun, Vickers K, Bren Gun (only used in anti-aircraft mountings), Degtyaryov light machine gun, and American-180 submachine gun. A highly unusual example was found on the Type 89 machine gun fed from two 45-round quadrant-shaped pan magazines (each magazine held nine of the five-round stripper clips).

===Helical===
Helical magazines extend the drum magazine design so that rounds follow a spiral path around an auger-shaped rotating follower or &quot;drive member&quot;, allowing for large ammunition capacity in a relatively compact package (compared to a regular box magazine of similar capacity). Early helical magazine designs include that patented by an unidentified inventor through the patent agent William Edward Newton in 1857 and the internal magazine of the Evans Repeating Rifle, patented in the late 1860s. This type of magazine is used by the Calico M960, PP-19 Bizon, CS/LS06 and KBP PP90M1. The North Korean military uses a 100- to 150- round helical magazine in the Type 88 assault rifle. Helical magazines offer substantially more ammunition carriage; however, they are inherently complex designs. As such, they can be difficult to load and may decrease the reliability of feeding the weapon.

===Hopper===
The hopper magazine is a very unusual design. Unlike many other types of magazine-fed machine guns, which commonly used either box magazines or belts to feed ammunition into the firearm&#x27;s action, the hopper magazine functioned differently. It would use stripper clips from an infantryman or machine gunner to supply ammunition for the machine gun to operate. This could be accomplished at any time, by just dropping the entire stripper clip into the hopper magazine.

The Japanese Type 11 light machine gun was the only weapon system that used a hopper magazine. This light machine gun was fed by standard 6.5×50mmSR Arisaka stripper clips that were used by riflemen armed with the Type 38 bolt action rifle. The hopper is located on the left side of the receiver and held 6 of the 5-round clips, for a total of 30 rounds of ammunition. The hopper magazine was designed with a series of mechanical teeth activated by a cam track on the gas piston to pull cartridges off each clip and into the action. After the fifth and final round from each stripper clip was fed and fired, the empty clip would then fall out the bottom of the hopper magazine and the next fully loaded stripper clip would then be dropped into place for feeding. There is a spring-loaded follower that applied pressure on top of the clips to hold them in place so they would not fall out while the weapon was being transported or fired.

==STANAG magazine==

A &quot;STANAG magazine&quot; or &quot;NATO magazine&quot; is a type of detachable magazine proposed by NATO in October 1980. Shortly after NATO&#x27;s acceptance of the 5.56×45mm NATO rifle cartridge, Draft Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 4179 was proposed in order to allow NATO members to easily share rifle ammunition and magazines down to the individual soldier level. The U.S. M16 rifle magazine was proposed for standardization. Many NATO members subsequently developed or purchased rifles with the ability to accept this type of magazine. However, the standard was never ratified and remains a &quot;Draft STANAG&quot;.

The STANAG magazine concept is only an interface, dimensional, and control (magazine latch, bolt stop, etc.) requirement. Therefore, it not only allows one type of magazine to interface with various weapon systems, but also allows STANAG magazines to be made in various configurations and capacities. The standard STANAG magazines are 20, 30, and 40 round box magazines, but there are many other designs available with capacities ranging from one round to 60 and 100 round casket magazines, 90 round snail-drum magazines, and 100 round and 150 round double-drum magazines.

==High-capacity magazines==

In the United States, a number of states have passed laws that ban magazines which are defined as &quot;high-capacity&quot; by statute. High-capacity or large-capacity magazines are generally those defined by statute to be capable of holding more than 10 to 15 rounds, although the definitions will vary by state. Other nations impose restrictions on magazine capacity as well. In Canada, magazines are generally limited to 5 rounds for rifles and shotguns (with some exceptions) and 10 rounds for handguns (with some exceptions), depending on the firearm.

<text>Esther Jane Williams (August 8, 1921 – June 6, 2013) was an American competitive swimmer and actress. She set regional and national records in her late teens on the Los Angeles Athletic Club swim team. Unable to compete in the 1940 Summer Olympics because of the outbreak of World War II, she joined Billy Rose&#x27;s Aquacade, where she took on the role vacated by Eleanor Holm after the show&#x27;s move from New York City to San Francisco. While in the city, she spent five months swimming alongside Olympic gold-medal winner and &quot;Tarzan&quot; star Johnny Weissmuller. Williams caught the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer scouts at the Aquacade. After appearing in several small roles, and alongside Mickey Rooney in an Andy Hardy film and future five-time co-star Van Johnson in &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;, Williams made a series of films in the 1940s and early 1950s known as &quot;aquamusicals&quot;, which featured elaborate performances with synchronised swimming and diving.

Every year from 1945 to 1949, Williams had at least one film among the 20 highest-grossing films of the year. In 1952, Williams appeared in her only biographical role, as Australian swimming star Annette Kellerman in &quot;Million Dollar Mermaid&quot;, which went on to become her nickname while she was at MGM. Williams left MGM in 1956 and appeared in a handful of unsuccessful feature films, followed by several extremely popular water-themed network television specials, including one from Cypress Gardens, Florida.

Williams was also a successful businesswoman. Before retiring from acting, she invested in a &quot;service station, a metal products plant, a manufacturer of bathing suits, various properties and a successful restaurant chain known as Trails.&quot; She lent her name to a line of swimming pools, retro swimwear, and instructional swimming videos for children, and served as a commentator for synchronized swimming at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

==Early years==
Esther Jane Williams was born on August 8, 1921, in Inglewood, California, the fifth and youngest child of Louis Stanton Williams (January 19, 1886  – June 10, 1968) and Bula Myrtle (née Gilpin; October 8, 1885 – December 29, 1971).

The two lived on neighboring farms in Kansas and carried on a nine-year courtship until June 1, 1908, when they eloped and set off for California. However, they ran out of money in Salt Lake City, Utah, and settled there. Esther&#x27;s brother, Stanton (September 4, 1912 – March 3, 1929) was discovered by actress Marjorie Rambeau, which led to the family (including sisters Maurine and June, and brother David) moving to the Los Angeles area to be near the studios. Louis Williams purchased a small piece of land in the southwest area of town and had a small house built there. Esther was born in the living room, which was also where the family slept until Louis Williams was able to add bedrooms. In 1929, Stanton Williams died after his colon burst. He was 16 years old.

In 1935, Bula Myrtle Williams invited 16-year-old Buddy McClure to live with her family. McClure had recently lost his mother and Bula was still grieving over the death of her son, Stanton. Esther recounted in her autobiography that one night, when the rest of the family was visiting relatives in Alhambra, McClure raped her. She was terrified to tell anyone about the incident and waited two years before finally revealing the truth to her parents. Williams&#x27; mother seemed unsure about her story, claiming McClure was &quot;sensitive&quot; and felt sympathetic toward him when he admitted his guilt. However, Bula Williams then banished him from her home. McClure joined the United States Coast Guard, and Williams never saw him again.

==Career==

===Competitive swimming===

Williams was enthusiastic about swimming in her youth. Her older sister, Maurine, took her to Manhattan Beach and to the local pool. She took a job counting towels at the pool to pay the five-cent entry fee, and while there, had swimming lessons from the male lifeguards. From them, she learned the &quot;male only&quot; swimming strokes, including the butterfly, with which she would later break records.

Her medley team set the record for the 300-yard relay at the Los Angeles Athletic Club in 1939, and was also national AAU champion in the 100 meter freestyle, with a record-breaking time of 1 minute 9.0 seconds. By age 16, Williams had won three US national championships in breaststroke and freestyle swimming.

Williams graduated from Washington High School (now known as Washington Preparatory High School) in Los Angeles in 1939, where she served as class vice president, and later president. However, Williams never trained in swimming while there.

During her senior year of high school, Williams received a D in her algebra course, preventing her from getting a scholarship to the University of Southern California. She enrolled in Los Angeles City College to retake the course. In 1939, Williams expressed interest in pursuing a degree in physical education in order to teach it one day. To earn money for tuition, Williams worked as a stock girl at the I. Magnin department store, where she also modeled clothing for customers and appeared in newspaper advertisements.

While Williams was working at I. Magnin, she was contacted by Billy Rose&#x27;s assistant and asked to audition as a replacement for Eleanor Holm in his Aquacade show. Williams impressed Rose and she got the role. The Aquacade was part of the Golden Gate International Exposition, and Williams was partnered with Olympic swimmer and &quot;Tarzan&quot; star Johnny Weissmuller, who, Williams wrote in her autobiography, repeatedly tried to seduce her. Despite this, Williams remained with the show until it closed on September 29, 1940. Williams had planned to compete in the 1940 Summer Olympics, which were cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II. Sometime in the mid to late 1950s, NBC built a large studio with a huge swimming pool on Avenue M between E 14th and E 15th St. in Brooklyn, New York. The intent was, according to local rumors, that Esther Williams was going to have a show from the studio. It never occurred. The building remained empty until 1959/1960, when the “Steve Allen Show” was brought to the studios and televised live on Sunday evenings.

===Acting===
It was at Aquacade that Williams first attracted attention from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer scouts. MGM&#x27;s head, Louis B. Mayer, had been looking for a female sports star for the studio to compete with Fox&#x27;s figure skating star, Sonja Henie. Williams signed her contract with MGM in 1941. 

In her contract were two clauses: the first being that she receive a guest pass to The Beverly Hills Hotel where she could swim in the pool every day, and the second that she would not appear on camera for nine months to allow for acting, singing, dancing, and diction lessons. Williams wrote in her autobiography, &quot;If it took nine months for a baby to be born, I figured my &#x27;birth&#x27; from Esther Williams the swimmer to Esther Williams the movie actress would not be much different.&quot;
While top stars at the studios such as Judy Garland, Betty Grable, and Shirley Temple took part in bond tours during the war, Williams was asked to take in hospital tours. At this point, Williams had achieved pin-up status because of the number of photographs of her in bathing suits. To prepare, Williams and her publicity assistant would listen to Bob Hope and Jack Benny&#x27;s radio programs, retelling the funniest jokes while at the hospitals. Williams also invited GIs to dance with her on stage and take part in mock screen tests. The men would receive a card telling them their lines, and they would act out the scene in front of the other soldiers. These tests were always romantic scenes to which the men were required to refuse multiple times. When the men said the final, &quot;No&quot;, Williams would pull at her tear-away skirt and sweater leaving nothing but a gold lamé swimsuit. The scenes would always end with the men giving in and kissing her after that stunt. Her hospital tours continued into the 1950s. A (forged) signed, waterproof portrait of Williams was circulated among men in the United States Navy for a &quot;capture the Esther&quot; competition. This competition continues to this day in the Royal Australian Navy, which holds in its archives an &quot;original&quot; forged signed portrait while maintaining a &quot;capturable&quot; image for use in the fleet.

===1940s===
Three weeks after Williams signed her contract, George Sidney directed her first screen test. According to Williams&#x27;s autobiography, the studio used this test to get Lana Turner back in line with the terms of her contract and as punishment for Turner&#x27;s having eloped with Artie Shaw. Williams screen tested with the leading man, Clark Gable, for the film &quot;Somewhere I&#x27;ll Find You&quot;. However, when Turner divorced Shaw after four months of marriage, she rejoined the film. Following several short subject films, Williams appeared as Sheila Brooks in &quot;Andy Hardy&#x27;s Double Life&quot;. Sheila was a student with whom Andy falls in love. Next was a small part in the film &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;, starring Spencer Tracy and Irene Dunne. It was here she first worked with Van Johnson, with whom she would partner in five films.

&quot;Bathing Beauty&quot;, previously titled &quot;Mr. Coed&quot;, starred Red Skelton as a man who enrolls in a women&#x27;s college to win back his swimming instructor fiancée, played by Williams. This was her first Technicolor musical. The studio changed the title of the film to showcase Williams. Almost all of the film&#x27;s posters featured Williams in a bathing suit, though the swimming sequences make up a small portion of the film. Her date to the premiere at the Astor Theater in New York City was future husband Ben Gage. For the event, MGM publicity set up a six-story-tall billboard of Williams diving into Times Square with a large sign that said &quot;Come on in! The story&#x27;s fine!&quot;
Williams appeared in the film &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; as herself. This was followed by the musical &quot;Thrill of a Romance&quot;. Van Johnson co-starred as a decorated war veteran who falls in love with Williams while on her honeymoon. &quot;Thrill of a Romance&quot; was the 8th highest-grossing film of 1945. Williams had to help Johnson swim, and she placed her hand under his back to keep him afloat. The studio&#x27;s publicity department tried to put the two together in public as much as possible in the hopes of encouraging a romance, even though Williams was involved with Gage at the time. When asked why they didn&#x27;t date, Johnson replied, &quot;because I&#x27;m afraid she can&#x27;t get her webbed feet into a pair of evening sandals.&quot;

Williams tried a more serious role in &quot;The Hoodlum Saint&quot; (1946), with William Powell and Angela Lansbury. Audiences expected Powell&#x27;s Nick Charles persona and rejected the idea of a romance between Williams and Powell onscreen due to their age difference. She also appeared in &quot;Easy to Wed&quot;, a remake of 1936&#x27;s &quot;Libeled Lady&quot;, with Johnson and Lucille Ball. It was the first singing part in a film for Williams, who had Harriet Lee as her singing teacher.

&quot;Fiesta&quot; (originally called &quot;Fiesta Brava&quot;) starred Williams as Ricardo Montalbán&#x27;s twin sister, Maria, who pretends to be her bullfighting brother in hopes of luring him back home. Audiences, and Williams, thought the film was silly, as Williams and Montalbán had vastly different accents. Montalbán was born in Mexico and was a native Spanish speaker while Williams had a mid-western accent picked up from her Kansas-born parents. Production was difficult with a multitude of problems. By 1947, Gage and Williams were married. Gage had traveled to Mexico for the making of the film. He got into a fight with an employee of the cast&#x27;s hotel, was arrested, and subsequently thrown out of the country. The director of photography, Sidney Wagner, and one other crew member died of cholera from eating contaminated street food. Many of the film&#x27;s stuntmen were sent to the hospital after being gored by bulls. Director Dick Thorpe hadn&#x27;t wanted the bulls killed (as they usually were at the end of a bullfight) because he believed them to be too expensive to replace.

After filming was completed on &quot;Fiesta&quot;, Williams appeared in the romance &quot;This Time for Keeps&quot; (1947) with singer Johnnie Johnston. In 1948, Williams signed a contract with swimwear company Cole of California to appear as their spokesperson, and Williams and the other swimmers in her films wore Cole swimsuits. Since the aqua-musicals were an entirely new genre, the studio&#x27;s costume designers had little experience creating practical swimsuits. William&#x27;s plaid flannel swimsuit for &quot;This Time for Keeps&quot; was so heavy that she was dragged to the bottom of the pool, and had to unzip the suit, swimming naked to the edge of the pool to avoid drowning. Cole swimsuits used latex, which meant zippers were no longer necessary. While filming &quot;Skirts Ahoy!&quot; (1952), Williams discovered that members of the WAVES program received thin, cotton, shapeless swimsuits as part of their uniforms. Williams modeled a Cole swimsuit for the Secretary of the Navy and explained that the new swimsuits helped support women&#x27;s figures. The United States Navy ordered 50,000 suits immediately.

Filming &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; (1949) was, according to Williams in her autobiography, an experience of &quot;pure misery.&quot; A period musical starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, the two male leads&#x27; characters were players in a baseball team owned by K.C. Higgins, Williams&#x27;s role. She claimed that Kelly and co-writer Stanley Donen treated her with contempt and went out of their way to make jokes at her expense. The film was well-received critically and became a major commercial success, raking in $3.4 million in rentals and becoming the 11th highest-earning film of the year. Williams made &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (also 1949) around the same time with co-stars Ricardo Montalbán, Red Skelton and Betty Garrett, who had also been in &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game.&quot; In the film, Williams sings &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; with Montalbán. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 22nd Academy Awards. Williams and Montalbán were originally slated to sing &quot;(I&#x27;d Like to Get You on a) Slow Boat to China&quot;, but studio censors thought the song was too sexual (interpreting the word &quot;get&quot; as &quot;have&quot;) and instead gave them &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside.&quot; &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Daughter&quot; became the 10th highest-grossing film of 1949.

===1950s===

Williams made &quot;Duchess of Idaho&quot; (1950), shot on location in Sun Valley, Idaho, co-starring Van Johnson and John Lund. MGM paired her with Howard Keel for three films, &quot;Pagan Love Song&quot; (also 1950), &quot;Texas Carnival (1951&quot;) and later &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Darling&quot; (1955). They both had cameos in the film &quot;Callaway Went Thataway&quot; (1951).

In &quot;Million Dollar Mermaid&quot; (1952), Williams portrayed Annette Kellermann, a real-life Australian swimming and diving star. Williams co-starred with Victor Mature, who played Kellermann&#x27;s husband and manager, James Sullivan. The two engaged in a passionate affair during filming. Williams often called this her favorite film and named her autobiography after it. Williams also won the &quot;Henrietta Award&quot; at the 1952 Golden Globes, for World Film Favorite – Female. &quot;Easy to Love&quot; (1953), also with Van Johnson, was filmed on location in Cypress Gardens, where a swimming pool in the shape of the state of Florida had been built specifically for the film. Williams was pregnant during shooting, but still performed all her own waterskiing stunts.

In &quot;Dangerous When Wet&quot; (also 1953), Williams worked with three important male co-stars – Tom and Jerry and her future husband Fernando Lamas. During casting, Lamas told Williams he did not want to star in the film with her because he only wanted to be involved in &quot;important pictures&quot;. His part had to be rewritten to persuade him to take part in the film. 

In 1953, Williams had been on maternity leave for three months while pregnant with her daughter Susan, and assumed she would go straight to work on the film &quot;Athena&quot; when she returned. However, production started without her, and the studio cast Jane Powell in the lead role, rewriting much of the premise that Williams and writers Leo Pogostin and Chuck Walters had come up with. The studio moved her to &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Darling.&quot; Two more films were planned, &quot;Bermuda Encounter&quot; and &quot;Olympic Venus&quot;, about the first Olympic swimmers; however, these were never made.

Many of her MGM films, such as &quot;Million Dollar Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Darling&quot;, contained elaborately staged synchronized swimming scenes, with considerable risk to Williams. She broke her neck filming a 115 ft dive off a tower during a climactic musical number for the film &quot;Million Dollar Mermaid&quot; and was in a body cast for seven months. She subsequently recovered, although she continued to suffer headaches as a result of the accident. Her many hours spent submerged in a studio tank resulted in ruptured eardrums numerous times. She also nearly drowned after not being able to find the trapdoor in the ceiling of a tank. The walls and ceiling were painted black and the trapdoor blended in. Williams was pulled out only because a member of the crew realized the door was not opening.

===After MGM===
After 15 years of appearing in films, Williams was threatened with contract suspension from MGM after refusing the lead role in &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot; (eventually released in 1956), a musical remake of 1939&#x27;s &quot;The Women&quot;. The role of Mary would have been rewritten to be an aquacade star (and was eventually filled by June Allyson as &quot;Kay&quot;, a nightclub singer). Williams redecorated her dressing room to accommodate returning star Grace Kelly, packed her terry cloth robes and swimsuits and drove off the studio lot. As a result of leaving her contract, Williams lost almost $3 million in deferred contract payments, which had been taken from her paychecks over the previous 14 years and put aside as both a nest egg and a tax deferral. She was, however, still able to collect on the $50,000 signing bonus from when she first signed her contract.

In 1956, she moved to Universal International and appeared in a non-musical dramatic film, &quot;The Unguarded Moment&quot; (1956). After that, her film career slowly wound down. She later admitted that husband Fernando Lamas preferred her not to continue in films. She would, however, make occasional appearances on television, including mystery guest appearances for &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, and two aqua-specials, &quot;The Esther Williams Aqua Spectacle&quot; held in London at The Empire Pool Wembley in 1956 and &quot;Esther Williams at Cypress Gardens&quot; which was telecast on August 8, 1960. More than half of all television sets in use in the United States were tuned in to watch the &quot;Cypress Gardens&quot; special. In 1966, Williams was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame.

==Later years==
Williams retired from acting in the early 1960s and later turned down the role of Belle Rosen, a character with a crucial swimming scene, in &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;. (The role eventually went to Shelley Winters.)

She continued to lend her name to a line of retro women&#x27;s swimwear. Williams said, &quot;Women worldwide are fighting a thing called gravity ... I say to women when I talk to them, &#x27;You girls of 18 have until about 25, 30 at the most, and then you have to report to me. My suits are quality fabric. She went on: &quot;I put you in a suit that contains you and you will swim in. I don&#x27;t want you to be in two Dixie cups and a fish line.&quot;

She was also the namesake of a company that manufactures swimming pools and swimming pool accessories. She came out with a line of &quot;Swim, Baby, Swim&quot; videos, which helped parents teach their children how to swim. She also appeared as a commentator for synchronized swimming at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Williams met her fourth husband as a result of his calling her to coordinate her appearance. She co-wrote her autobiography, &quot;The Million Dollar Mermaid&quot; (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1999), with popular media critic and author Digby Diehl. In 1994 she made her first new big-screen appearance in 31 years as one of the hosts of the retrospective &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot;.

In a 2007 interview with Diane Sawyer, Williams admitted that she had recently suffered a stroke. &quot;I opened my eyes and I could see, but I couldn&#x27;t remember anything from the past&quot;, she said. In June 2008, Williams was able to attend Cyd Charisse&#x27;s funeral, albeit in a wheelchair.

In April 2010, Williams appeared at the first Turner Classic Movies Classic Film Festival in Hollywood, California, alongside two-time co-star Betty Garrett. Their film, &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1949), was screened at the pool of the Roosevelt Hotel, along with a performance of the Williams-inspired synchronized swimming troupe, The Waterlilies. South Beach Miami&#x27;s 2010 Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Swim, a showcase of designer swimwear, included a Williams suit, complete with a beach summer theme and sand palette with aqua accents.

In 2000, an account of Williams&#x27;s life and career appeared in the Swedish book &quot;Esther Williams — Skenbiografin&quot; (&quot;Esther Williams: The Fake Biography&quot;) written by Jane Magnusson, in which the author shares with readers her own fascination for art swimming as a genre and, here, in particular, Williams as—to the author—both a bewildering and mesmerizing front figure and icon in this field.

==Personal life==
===Political views===
Williams was a registered Republican.

===Marriages===
Williams married four times. She met her first husband, Leonard Kovner, while attending Los Angeles City College. She later wrote in her autobiography &quot;The Million Dollar Mermaid&quot; that &quot;he was smart, handsome, dependable ... and dull. I respected his intelligence, and his dedication to a future career in medicine. He loved me, or so he said, and even asked me to marry him.&quot; They were married in the San Francisco suburb of Los Altos on June 27, 1940. On their split she said &quot;I found, much to my relief, that all I needed for my emotional and personal security was my own resolve and determination. I didn&#x27;t need a marriage and a ring. I had come to realize all too quickly that Leonard Kovner was not a man I could ever really love.&quot; They divorced on September 12, 1944.
She married singer/actor Ben Gage on November 25, 1945; they had three children, Benjamin Stanton (born August 6, 1949), Kimball Austin (October 30, 1950 – May 6, 2008) and Susan Tenney (born October 1, 1953). In her autobiography, she portrayed Gage as an alcoholic parasite who squandered $10 million of her earnings. Gage and Williams separated in 1952, and divorced in April 1959.

During the filming of &quot;Pagan Love Song&quot; in Hawaii, Williams learned she was pregnant with her third child, and notified the studio in California. Gage had met a man at the hotel who owned a ham radio and persuaded the man to let them use it to call California. What they failed to realize at the time, though, was that anyone could be listening in on their conversation, and news of her pregnancy was broadcast to the entire West Coast.

She disclosed in her autobiography that she had an affair with actor Victor Mature while they were working on &quot;Million Dollar Mermaid&quot;, citing that at the time her marriage was in trouble and, feeling lonely, she turned to Mature for love and affection, and he gave her all she wanted. The affair stopped while Williams was recovering from her fall during the shooting of &quot;Million Dollar Mermaid.&quot; She was romantically linked with Jeff Chandler. She claims in her autobiography that Chandler was a cross-dresser and that she broke off the relationship. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, many friends and colleagues of Chandler&#x27;s rebutted Williams&#x27; claims. Jane Russell commented, &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard of such a thing. Cross-dressing is the last thing I would expect of Jeff. He was a sweet guy, definitely all man.&quot;

She married her former lover, Argentine actor/director, Fernando Lamas on December 31, 1969. She later claimed that for 13 years she lived in total submission to him. She had to stop being &quot;Esther Williams&quot; and could not have her children live with her. In return, he would be faithful. Nonetheless, they remained married until Lamas&#x27;s death from pancreatic cancer on October 8, 1982.

She resided in Beverly Hills with actor husband Edward Bell, whom she married on October 24, 1994.

===LSD===
In September 1959, Cary Grant told &quot;Look&quot; magazine that he had taken LSD under a doctor&#x27;s supervision, and it had changed his life. Grant&#x27;s therapist, Mortimer Hartman, described LSD as &quot;a psychic energizer which empties the subconscious and intensifies emotion and memory a hundred times&quot;. Grant said that, with the help of LSD, he had &quot;found that [he] had a tough inner core of strength&quot;, and that when he was young, he &quot;was very dependent upon older men and women. Now, people [came] to [him] for help.&quot; Williams stated that she wanted to be one of those people. As she said in &quot;Million Dollar Mermaid&quot;, &quot;At that point, I really didn&#x27;t know who I was. Was I that glamorous femme fatale? ... Was I just another broken-down divorcée whose husband left her with all the bills and three kids?&quot; Shortly after reading the article, she contacted Grant. He called his doctor and made an appointment for her. Williams said LSD seemed like instant psychoanalysis.

==Death and legacy==
Esther Williams died in her sleep on June 6, 2013, from natural causes, in her Los Angeles home. She was 91. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.

On her death, CNN quoted her International Swimming Hall of Fame biography, saying, &quot;Her movie career played a major role in the promotion of swimming, making it attractive to the public, contributing to the growth of the sport as a public recreation for health, exercise, water safety – and just plain fun.&quot; Her stepson Lorenzo Lamas tweeted she was &quot;The best swim teacher and soul mom.&quot; Actress Annabeth Gish tweeted a tribute, writing that Esther Williams was an &quot;elegant, gracious movie star, legend and neighbor&quot;. Film historian Leonard Maltin called her &quot;a major, major star, a tremendous box office attraction.&quot;

For her contribution to the motion-picture industry, Williams has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street. She left her hand and footprints in front of the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on August 1, 1944.

Williams was mentioned in the &quot;Court Charades&quot; sketch in the 1970 &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; episode &quot;The Spanish Inquisition&quot; where Eric Idle mentions her to which Graham Chapman responds &quot;How can you find the defendant &#x27;Not Esther Williams&#x27;?&quot;

Scarlett Johansson&#x27;s character DeeAnna Moran in the 2016 Coen Brothers film &quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot; shares several similarities with Williams, most notably being an aquamusical star who becomes pregnant during production.

==Archive==
Esther Williams donated her personal film archive, including twenty home movies, to the Academy Film Archive. The Academy Film Archive has subsequently preserved several of these home movies.

==Filmography==


==Box office rankings==
For a number of years, US movie exhibitors voted Esther Williams among the most popular film stars in the country:
*1947 – 24th most popular star
*1948 – 11th
*1949 – 8th
*1950 – 8th – also 2nd most popular star in the UK
*1951 – 5th most popular female star
*1952 – 12th
*1953 – 12th
*1954 – 25th
With the exception of &quot;The Hoodlum Saint&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Darling&quot;, no film in which Williams starred for MGM lost money and some were extremely profitable.

<text>PS &quot;Kingswear Castle&quot; is a steamship. She is a coal-fired river paddle steamer, dating from 1924 with engines from 1904. After running summer excursions on the River Medway and the Thames for many years she returned to the River Dart in Devon in December 2012 to run excursions from 2013 onwards on the river she was built on and for. &quot;Kingswear Castle&quot; is listed as part of the National Historic Fleet of ships of &quot;Pre-eminent National Significance&quot;.

==History==

The &quot;Kingswear Castle&quot; was built by Philip &amp; Sons of Dartmouth in 1924 for service on the River Dart, following sister ships &quot;Compton Castle&quot; and &quot;Totnes Castle&quot;, and was operated by the River Dart Steamboat Co. Her predecessor of the same name from 1904 is now a rotted and barely recognisable hulk in the River Dart, but the engines were re-used in the current steamboat.

&quot;Kingswear Castle&quot; was chartered to the United States Navy during World War II, and was used for carrying stores and personnel at Dartmouth. In 1965 &quot;Kingswear Castle&quot; was withdrawn from service and became the first purchase of the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society (PSPS) two years later. She was then taken to the Isle of Wight and was moored at Island Harbour Marina from August 1967 to June 1971. However, due to her deteriorating condition, she was then taken to the River Medway.

After various difficulties and a great deal of restoration work she was finally brought into service again in 1985, and was operated by the Paddle Steamer Kingswear Castle Trust based at Chatham Historic Dockyard in Kent, in association with the PSPS.

On 18 December 2012 she returned to the River Dart again, under charter to the Dartmouth Steam Railway and Riverboat Company, to run passenger trips around Dartmouth Harbour and up river to Totnes.

<text>Verio is a global web hosting provider headquartered in the United States. Incorporated in 1996 in Denver, Colorado, it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Communications, which acquired the company in 2000. Verio was formed from a consolidation of over 200 smaller Internet service providers (ISPs) and web hosting services.

==History==
Verio was founded by Darin Brannan and Justin Jaschke, and several senior management team members subsequently joined from OneComm/Nextel. The company idea, including the initial business plan and pitch deck, began in the halls of Norwest Venture Partners after several months of market diligence and target acquisition discussions. Venture Capitalists George J. Still, Jr. and Darin Brannan from Norwest Venture Partners ultimately teamed with Steven C. Halstedt from the Centennial Funds and Steve Schovee from Telecom Partners to syndicate and launch the business in 1996.

In order to validate the strategy and raise capital, Brett Sharenow and Lynn Morris from Morris Associates were hired to create the first detailed engineering-driven financial model consisting of ISPs, core network infrastructure, and server farms, allowing Verio to raise substantial funds ($1.1 billion) from principal founders, several top tier VC&#x27;s, NTT and institutional investors with which to purchase target acquisitions and build out centralized back office, support, national sales and infrastructure.
By the year 2000, Verio had purchased 55 ISP/Hosting companies, most in the U.S. but some in Europe. During this time Verio went public on the NASDAQ, trading under the symbol VRIO, with a market value exceeding $1 billion. Shortly after the IPO, in early 2000, Verio was sold to NTT at a per-share price of $73, a total cost slightly exceeding $5 billion. Because NTT was a 53% Japanese government-owned company, foreigners were not allowed to own NTT stock, according to Japanese law at the time, and therefore the buy-out was a 100% cash deal, making it one of the highest grossing deals of the dotcom era. The United States Congress held hearings over the transaction to ensure it did not violate national security concerns. The Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation expressed concern that the Japanese government, which owned 53 percent of NTT at the time, could gain access to classified information should the U.S. government use Verio&#x27;s network to tap Internet communications during an investigation. To placate these concerns, NTT agreed to form a separate division within the company staffed only by U.S. citizens to handle any work in support of government investigations. As a result, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States recommended that President Clinton allow the $5.5 billion purchase to proceed. The deal also prompted scrutiny of Japan&#x27;s openness to foreign telecom competitors.

Shortly after the announced deal, the NASDAQ stock market crashed in the spring of 2000 in the dot-com bubble burst. The agreed price of $73 remained and NTT and Verio completed the transaction by the fall of 2000.

Verio continues to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of NTT Communications.

At the end of 2005, the backbone and some dedicated hosting centers moved to NTT America, with the web hosting business staying with Verio. The European arm, Verio Europe, was moved in its entirety to NTT Europe. In October 2006, Verio Europe was renamed NTT Europe Online.

In late May 2015, Verio Shared SMB hosting division, as a business unit of NTT America, Inc. (“NTT America”), was sold to The Endurance International Group, Inc. Endurance continues to provide web hosting, email and domain name services under the Verio name.

==Some of the ISPs purchased by Verio==
Verio was initially built on a business model known as a &quot;rollup&quot;, composed entirely of smaller companies operating under the Verio brand name. By the year 2000, Verio had purchased more than 50 small ISPs and hosting companies, most in the US but also in Europe, ranging in price from under US$1 million to over US$100 million per ISP. These companies were often mature and well-known brand names in their local markets — more well known than Verio — and often continued to operate with a great deal of local autonomy even after purchase by Verio. Some of the companies purchased by Verio were leading pioneers in the internet industry (Digital Nation, NorthWestNet), representing the first wave of commercial ISP access and hosting in regional markets around the US and Europe.

<doc id="896529" wikidata="Q538721" url="?curid=896529" title="Hotter than Hell (album)">
<text>Hotter than Hell is the second studio album by American hard rock band Kiss, released on October 22, 1974, by Casablanca Records. It was certified gold on June 23, 1977, having shipped 500,000 copies. The album was re-released in 1997 in a remastered version. It peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts at No. 100, without the benefit of a hit single. Many of the album&#x27;s songs were live staples for the band, including &quot;Parasite&quot;, &quot;Hotter than Hell&quot;, &quot;Let Me Go, Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, and &quot;Watchin&#x27; You&quot;.

==Composition and recording==
The production team of Kenny Kerner and Richie Wise, who had produced the group&#x27;s first album, was again chosen for the follow-up. The pair had just relocated to Los Angeles, and Kiss made the trek to the west coast to commence recording, the first the band had done outside their native state of New York. The band members, all hailing from New York City, immediately developed a dislike for their new surroundings. Paul Stanley&#x27;s guitar was stolen on his first day in Los Angeles. The working title for the album was &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;. 

Formally, &quot;Hotter than Hell&quot; is darker than the band&#x27;s first album. This is partly due to the murkier production values, but also the lyrical content of some of the songs. &quot;Goin&#x27; Blind&quot;, which details a doomed romance between a 93-year-old and a 16-year-old girl, was a song written by Simmons and Stephen Coronel during their days with Wicked Lester. The original title was &quot;Little Lady&quot;, and the song&#x27;s original second verse lyric, revived by Simmons for their &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; appearance, as well as on Alive IV, suggests that the song&#x27;s narrator is a sea captain addressing a mermaid.

Although the album featured two songs composed and one song co-composed by lead guitarist Ace Frehley, he did not sing on any of them; his lack of confidence in his singing abilities at that time led to Frehley delegating lead vocal duties to other members of the band, with &quot;Parasite&quot; and &quot;Strange Ways&quot; going to Gene Simmons and Peter Criss, respectively. Frehley&#x27;s guitar solo on &quot;Strange Ways&quot; has been referred to as one of his best.

&quot;Hotter than Hell&quot; featured many more overdubs than the first album. While Kerner and Wise wanted to produce a record that captured Kiss as a live act, they decided to take advantage of the experience the band had gained as recording artists.

In an interview with Songfacts&#x27; Greg Prato in 2013, Richie Wise shouldered the blame for the album&#x27;s sub-par sonics. &quot;For whatever reason, moving to California, my head wasn&#x27;t in the right place. It was more of a chore than it was out of love, that album. And my heart and soul didn&#x27;t get there. I don&#x27;t remember having any breathing time. It was just too much exhale. It wasn&#x27;t enough [to] inhale/exhale. Not enough give and take. I was going through a bunch of changes at that time. I moved from New York to California. I&#x27;d never moved like that in my life, made a big move. It was just a big time for me, and &quot;Hotter than Hell&quot; took a back seat. And I apologize for that.&quot;

==Cover art==
The album is well known for its striking cover designed by John Van Hamersveld. The front featured Japanese manga-influenced artwork, and the back cover showed individual band shots taken by Norman Seeff at a wild party and a composite of all four band members&#x27; makeup designs.

The photoshoot took place on August 18, 1974 in Los Angeles. The photo session included a wild party with many people, getting drunk for it.

On August 24, 1974, Ace Frehley was involved in a car accident. One day later, another photo session took place with Seeff. Due to Frehley having stitches on the left side of his face, he did the photoshoot with only half of his makeup.

The Japanese character on the bottom of the album cover () is &quot;chikara&quot;, which means &quot;power&quot;. It would later be used on various forms of Kiss material during the 1970s and 1980s, most prominently on Eric Carr&#x27;s drum kit. The Japanese characters on the top-right corner of the album cover (地獄 の さけび) are &quot;Jigoku no Sakebi&quot;, which means &quot;shout/scream of hell&quot; or &quot;hell&#x27;s shout/scream&quot;. The Japanese katakana characters used for each member had transliteration errors. The characters for Peter Criss are ピータ・クリース (&quot;pita kurīsu&quot;) when it should have been ピーター・クリス &quot;pītā kurisu&quot;. Paul Stanley&#x27;s last name was incorrectly transliterated as スタンリィ (&quot;sutanryi&quot;) when it should have been スタンレー &quot;sutanrē&quot;. Gene Simmons&#x27; first name is incorrectly spelled ジイン (&quot;jiin&quot;) when it should have been ジーン &quot;jīn&quot;, and finally Ace Frehley&#x27;s first and last name were spelled エイス フューリ (&quot;eisu fyūri&quot;) when the characters should have been エース・フレーリー &quot;ēsu furērī&quot;.

==Release and reception==
Despite the intense touring schedule Kiss maintained in 1974, &quot;Hotter than Hell&quot; failed to outperform the band&#x27;s first album and fared considerably worse. This was due partly to the fact that Casablanca&#x27;s distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records had ended. The publicity push behind the album was not nearly as strong as it had been for the debut album. One notable exception was a television commercial aired to promote the album. The only single released from the album, &quot;Let Me Go, Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, was distributed in low numbers and failed to chart. Four months after the album was released, Kiss was pulled off of the tour and called back into the studio to record a follow-up. &quot;Hotter than Hell&quot; was certified gold on June 23, 1977.

<text>Christopher Lydon (born 1940 in Boston, Massachusetts) is an American media personality and author. He was the original host of &quot;The Connection&quot;, produced by WBUR and syndicated to other NPR stations, and created &quot;Open Source&quot;, a weekly radio program on WBUR.

==Education==
Lydon is a graduate of Boston&#x27;s Roxbury Latin School and Yale University.

==Journalistic history==
Lydon is a former journalist with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and anchored &quot;The Ten-O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on WGBH in Boston, Massachusetts.
After WGBH cancelled its nightly news program, he moved to WBUR, where in 1994 he became host of &quot;The Connection&quot;. In 2001, he and his longtime producer Mary McGrath were fired after a high-profile contract dispute with WBUR. McGrath&#x27;s and Lydon&#x27;s claim, rejected by the station, was that they, not WBUR, were the true creators of &quot;The Connection&quot; - moving it far beyond the initial WBUR template to become the successful, widely syndicated program.

During his tenure on &quot;The Connection&quot;, Lydon frequently discussed Internet topics, and his &quot;Radio Open Source&quot; blog became a launchpad for international broadcasts and other activities.
While a fellow at Harvard Law School&#x27;s Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society in 2003, Lydon began recording in-depth interviews focused on blogging and politics, posting the downloadable audio files as part of his blog. Dave Winer, also a Berkman Fellow, created an RSS enclosure feed for Lydon&#x27;s MP3 interview files, an event credited with sparking the growth of podcasting.
Lydon is credited with creating the first podcast ever recorded in July 2003.

He also launched the political site &quot;Bopnews&quot; (for &quot;Blogging of the President&quot;) during the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign.

On May 30, 2005, Lydon returned to the air on University of Massachusetts Lowell&#x27;s radio station WUML and Boston&#x27;s WGBH with a new show called &quot;Open Source&quot;, syndicated through Public Radio International. Including a blog and podcast, the program promised to &quot;use blogs to be a show about the world.&quot; On October 16, 2006, the Lowell, Massachusetts newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; announced that &quot;Radio personality Christopher Lydon&#x27;s lucrative and controversial contract with UMass Lowell to broadcast an hourlong radio show will not be renewed when it expires in December.&quot; Upon notice of the UMass Lowell discontinuance, Lydon began actively seeking new funders for the program. In November 2007, Lydon partnered with Brown University&#x27;s Watson Institute for International Studies to continue producing Radio Open Source.

In 2013, Lydon was often a guest commentator on Thursdays on WGBH Radio&#x27;s &quot;Boston Public Radio&quot; show. In 2014, Lydon returned to WBUR with a weekly radio program, &quot;Open Source&quot;.

==Politics==
Lydon was a candidate for mayor of Boston in 1993. He finished sixth out of eight candidates in the nonpartisan primary.

<text>The Connection was a public radio call-in program from WBUR that ran from 1994 to 2005. Originally hosted by Christopher Lydon (1994–2001), and (after a series of short-term fill-in hosts) followed by Canadian Dick Gordon (2001–2005), it was syndicated to as many as 66 public radio stations in the United States.

In March 2001, Lydon was dismissed after negotiations for renewal of his contract broke down. Lydon now hosts WBUR&#x27;s &quot;Open Source&quot;.

Dick Gordon became the show&#x27;s host just after the September 11, 2001 attacks. He eventually took the program to Baghdad for 10 days in April 2003.

&quot;The Connection&quot; was abruptly canceled after the August 5, 2005 broadcast, and Gordon laid off. Gordon says that the circumstances surrounding his termination were not explained well, though it is believed that WBUR was presumably not able to continue carrying the show.

WBUR filled &quot;The Connection&quot;&#x27;s 10 a.m. to noon timeslot with &quot;On Point&quot;, a similar program previously aired in the 7-9 p.m. timeslot. Gordon now hosts &quot;The Story with Dick Gordon&quot; at North Carolina Public Radio.

&quot;The Connection&quot;&#x27;s theme song was the jazz tune &quot;Cantaloupe Island&quot; by Herbie Hancock, performed by Us3 in their rendition titled &quot;Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)&quot;.

<doc id="896538" wikidata="Q4756428" url="?curid=896538" title="Andrew Briscoe">
<text>Andrew Briscoe (November 25, 1810 – October 4, 1849) was a merchant, revolutionary, soldier, and jurist. He was an organizer of the Texas Revolution, attending the Convention of 1836 and signing the Texas Declaration of Independence. He fought in three major battles, including the victory at San Jacinto. He was the first Chief Justice of Harrisburg County, Texas.

==Early life==
Andrew was born in Claiborne County, Mississippi on November 25, 1810. He was the son of prominent Mississippi state legislator Parmenas Briscoe (1784–1850), and his second wife, Mary &quot;Polly&quot; Montgomery (1794–1845). He had one half-brother from his father&#x27;s first marriage, four full brothers, and six full sisters. Andrew and his full brother, James Montgomery Briscoe, emigrated to Texas in the 1830s.

==Career==
Briscoe emigrated to Texas, gained Mexican citizenship in 1833, then settled in Anahuac, Texas, where he opened a store. He was among the local businessmen who protested the manner in which Mexican authorities collected import duties. He was jailed with DeWitt Clinton Harris, catalyzing an armed confrontation led by William B. Travis, the second of the Anahuac Disturbances. He volunteered on behalf of the Texian rebels at the Battle of Concepción, Siege of Bexar, and led Company A, Infantry Regulars at the decisive Battle of San Jacinto.

Briscoe signed the Texas Declaration of Independence.

Briscoe was a delegate to the Texas Convention of 1836. After Texas Independence, President Sam Houston appointed him to serve as the first Chief Justice of Harrisburg County, later renamed Harris County, Texas. After his term ended in 1839, he retired from office and became a cattle dealer. In 1839, he planned a new railroad from town of Harrisburg, Texas to the Brazos River. He hired workers to grade a roadbed and lay ties for about two miles before running short of capital.

==Personal life==
In August 1837, Briscoe married Mary Jane Harris in Harris County. Harris was a surviving daughter of Jane BIrdsall Harris, and John Richardson Harris, who had received a land grant from the Austin Colony, founded Harrisburg, Texas, and was the namesake of Harris County.

In 1837, the Briscoes resided in a house at the northwest corner of Main Street and Prairie Avenue in Houston. This dwelling constructed by builder-architect, Thomas William Ward, a small Greek Revival house on a large lot with a variety of flowering trees and fruit trees. They lived in this house until 1839, when they sold it to John Birdsall.

==Death and legacy==
In the spring of 1849, Briscoe moved with his family to New Orleans, where he lived until his death on October 4. Surviving Briscoe were his wife and four children. He is buried in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas.

Briscoe County, Texas, is named in his honor.

<doc id="896543" wikidata="Q3226944" url="?curid=896543" title="Only You Can Save Mankind">
<text>Only You Can Save Mankind (1992) is the first novel in the Johnny Maxwell trilogy of children&#x27;s books and fifth young adult novel by Terry Pratchett, author of the &quot;Discworld&quot; sequence of books. The following novels in the &quot;Johnny Maxwell Trilogy&quot; are &quot;Johnny and the Dead&quot; (1993) and &quot;Johnny and the Bomb&quot; (1996). The setting of the novels in the modern world was a departure for Pratchett, who wrote more regularly in fantasy world settings.

==Plot summary==
Twelve-year-old Johnny receives a pirate edition of the new video game &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot; from his friend Wobbler. However, he has not been playing for long when the ScreeWee Empire surrenders to him. After accepting the surrender he finds himself inside the game in his dreams, where he must deal with the suspicious Gunnery Officer as well as the understanding Captain, and work out exactly what they&#x27;re all supposed to do now.

This might all be the result of an over-active imagination except that the ScreeWee have disappeared altogether from everyone else&#x27;s copy of the game. With the help of another player, Kirsty, who calls herself &quot;Sigourney&quot; (as in Weaver), Johnny must try to get the ScreeWee home.

==Ideas and themes==
It plays with the effects of perception. For instance, since Kirsty refuses to see the ScreeWee as anything other than alien monsters who exist to be shot, they are much less human-like in her presence than when only dealing with Johnny.

Wobbler writes a computer game entitled &quot;Journey to Alpha Centauri&quot;. The game is meant to be played in real-time, meaning it would take three thousand years to finish the journey. If the game were actually played for three thousand years, the player would be rewarded with a message saying &quot;Welcome to Alpha Centauri. Now go home&quot;. This inspired an interactive fiction game developed by Julian Fleetwood, &quot;Journey to Alpha Centauri (In Real Time)&quot;. It was released in 1998, with the same premise of requiring three thousand years of game play to complete.

==Adaptations==
In 1996, &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot; was adapted into a three-part radio drama on BBC Radio 4, starring Tim Smith as Johnny.

In 2004, a musical adaptation for the stage was premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, with music by Leighton James House and lyrics by Shaun McKenna. A UK national tour is planned for opening in late 2011 with director Nikolai Foster. The album was released online November 23, 2009. A national CD release came out in April 2010.

<text>Elsa Morante (; 18 August 1912 – 25 November 1985) was an Italian novelist, poet, translator and children&#x27;s books author. Her novel &quot;La storia&quot; (&quot;History&quot;) is included in the Bokklubben World Library List of 100 Best Books of All Time.

==Life and career==
Elsa Morante was born in Rome in 1912, the daughter of Irma (née Poggibonsi), a schoolteacher, and Augusto Morante. Her mother came from a Jewish family in Modena. When she was a teenager Morante discovered that Francesco Lo Monaco, a family neighbour, was her biological father. Except for a brief period during World War II, she resided in Rome until her death in 1985.

Morante started writing at an early age. Without having much support from her parents, she relied mostly on self-education. She began writing short stories in the mid-1930s. Some were published in various publications and journals, including periodicals for children. Her first book, a collection of short stories called &quot;Il Gioco Segreto&quot; (The Secret Game), was published in 1941. In the same year, she married fellow novelist and film critic Alberto Moravia. In 1942 she wrote her first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Le Bellissime avventure di Caterì dalla Trecciolina&quot; (republished in 1959 as &quot;Le straordinarie avventure di Caterina&quot;).

During the German occupation of Italy late in World War II, Morante and Moravia, fearful because of their Jewish heritage, fled Rome to repair in Southern Lazio, in a village near Fondi and where there were several poor families of shepherds, called in the past, with an offensive term, &quot;ciociari&quot; in the modern Roman dialect. The experience would inspire Morante&#x27;s &quot;La storia&quot; (1974) and Moravia&#x27;s &quot;La Ciociara&quot; (translated in English in 1957 as &quot;Two Women&quot; and later made into a film by Vittorio De Sica). During her time in the territory of Fondi, she began translating the work of Katherine Mansfield. Morante decided to briefly return to war-torn Rome at great personal risk to retrieve the manuscript of what would be her first published &quot;Menzogna e sortilegio&quot; and get winter clothes.

At the end of the war, Morante and Moravia met the American translator William Weaver, who helped them to break into the English-speaking market. Her first novel, 1948&#x27;s &quot;Menzogna e sortilegio&quot;, won the Viareggio Prize, and was published in the United States in 1951 as &quot;House of Liars&quot;. Despite her international success, Morante found the English translation quite disappointing.

Morante&#x27;s next novel, &quot;L&#x27;isola di Arturo&quot;, was published in 1957 and won the Strega Prize. In 1961 Morante and Moravia separated, without divorcing, and Morante&#x27;s writing became more sporadic. She destroyed much of the work written during that period, although she did publish a novel, &quot;The Andalusian Shawl&quot; (1963), and a poem, &quot;The Adventure&quot;. Her next work, &quot;Il mondo salvato dai ragazzini&quot; (&quot;The World Saved by Children&quot;), a mix of poetry and songs mostly addressed to her new lover, artist Bill Morrow, was published in 1968. In 1963 Pier Paolo Pasolini invited Morante to select the music for his film &quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot;. She also collaborated in casting the actors.

In 1974 Morante published &quot;La storia&quot;, a book chronicling the events surrounding Rome during World War II. It became a national bestseller in Italy, partially due to Morante&#x27;s insistence that publisher Einaudi would put it out in an economical paperback edition. Despite its commercial success, the book provoked furious and at times negative reactions from left-wing literary critics, who disliked its anti-ideological tone. After Pier Paolo Pasolini wrote a negative review of the book, Morante broke off their friendship. &quot;La storia&quot; was adapted into a Rai television series in 1986.

Morante&#x27;s final novel, &quot;Aracoeli&quot; (1982), has been perceived as a summary of all the motifs and trends present in her writing, such as the innocence of childhood and the importance of creating fantastic worlds to escape from dreary realities.

The first English-language biography of Morante, &quot;A Woman of Rome&quot;, by Lily Tuck, was published in 2008.

== Major themes ==
Morante cultivated a love for music, books and cats. Her favorite books included The Iliad, Don Quixote, and Hamlet. She was also interested in Freudian psychology, Plato and Simone Weil. Southern Italy is also used as the backdrop for much of her work. Most of Morante&#x27;s greatest works are shaped by her choices and experiences in life and are reflected in her protagonists. One of the central themes in Morante&#x27;s work is Narcissism. The majority of Morante&#x27;s leading characters use autobiography as a way to seek self-therapy and hope. Narration becomes a leading tool. Her writing is essential for the formation of a positive consciousness about her personal memories. Another important aspect of Morante&#x27;s work is the metaphor of love. According to her, love can be passion and obsession, and can lead to despair or destruction. This trajectory is connected to her love for a nine-year-old boy when she was only two and a half years old. According to her, her first love was a heaven, but then it transformed into a hell. The metaphor of love can easily be traced back to one of her most famous poems, &quot;Alibi.&quot; Love and Narcissism are themes well connected to each other. Most of Morante&#x27;s characters seek love, not because they have true feelings for the person they fell in love with, but because they need to cover the feelings of emptiness from their childhood. It is through love and narcissism that Morante introduces other themes such as the role of motherhood and the meaning of childhood experiences.

<doc id="896549" wikidata="Q3304580" url="?curid=896549" title="Reggie and the Full Effect">
<text>Reggie and the Full Effect is an American rock band, the solo project of James Dewees, the former keyboardist for The Get Up Kids. It has released seven full-length albums, the latest in 2018, and has toured with various associated acts in their promotion.

==History==
===Early years (1998–2004)===
In the mid-1990s when he was playing with Coalesce, Dewees recorded four songs on a cassette tape as a joke, and would hand them out at concerts. After Matt Pryor received one, he urged Dewees to contact Ed Rose to record the material. With Pryor&#x27;s help, Dewees recorded and released Reggie and the Full Effect&#x27;s first album, &quot;Greatest Hits 1984–1987&quot;, on Second Nature Recordings in 1999.

In April 2000, Reggie released their second full-length, &quot;Promotional Copy&quot;, on Vagrant Records. The album caused much confusion in stores because of the album art, which is styled in the same manner as a promotional recording which is not intended to be sold. A similar joke fell flat when &quot;Under the Tray&quot; was released in February 2003. When the CD case was opened, buyers were shocked to find that there was no disc waiting for them in its usual resting place. Instead, the disc had been placed under the tray (hence the album title). On subsequent pressings, Vagrant added an illustration to show purchasers where to find the CD. This album contained the single &quot;Congratulations Smack and Katy&quot;, which would be the tune behind Reggie&#x27;s first music video and appear in the video game &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot;.

===&quot;Songs Not to Get Married To&quot; (2005–2006)===
Reggie&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Songs Not to Get Married To&quot;, was released on March 29, 2005. Most of the music from this album was inspired by the divorce Dewees went through with his first wife, Megan. Sean Ingram of Coalesce and ex-From Autumn to Ashes lead singer Ben Perri both appear on the album, as well as The Get Up Kids bandmates Rob Pope and Ryan Pope.

The album contained three singles, the most of any Reggie album to date. The lead single was for the song &quot;Get Well Soon&quot;, and included a video chronicling the Loch Ness Monster struggling with a divorce, mirroring the album&#x27;s themes. &quot;Get Well Soon&quot; is featured in the 2006 video game &quot;Saints Row&quot;. The second single was for &quot;Take Me Home, Please&quot;. A music video was released, although it did not receive the push that &quot;Get Well Soon&quot; did. Reggie also released a music video for &quot;Love Reality&quot;, a song by Dewees&#x27; alter-ego, Fluxuation. This remains the only music video that the band has released for a non-Reggie persona.

After the album&#x27;s release, Dewees embarked on an extensive tour to promote the album, including stints with Alkaline Trio, My Chemical Romance and Hellogoodbye.

===&quot;Last Stop: Crappy Town&quot; and farewell tour (2006–2008)===
Reggie and the Full Effect dropped off of the Warped Tour in the summer of 2006 to record a follow-up to &quot;Songs Not to Get Married To&quot; with producer Sean Beavan. It was confirmed by a MySpace bulletin that Reggie would release the song &quot;F Train&quot; from his new album exclusively for 24 hours on his MySpace profile on October 31, 2006. The song is much heavier than his other releases, and is very reminiscent of Dewees&#x27; former band, Coalesce.

In July 2007, speculation of Reggie coming to an end began through a message posted on his MySpace page. Later, Dewees posted a message that they had not broken up. However, soon afterward the official Reggie and the Full Effect MySpace page was taken down.

On April 8, 2008, Alternative Press announced that they had received details on the new album from Reggie and the Full Effect. The 12-song album is called &quot;Last Stop: Crappy Town&quot; and was produced by Sean Beavan. The album was initially shelved by Vagrant Records for being &quot;too heavy&quot; and distant from Reggie records of the past. A concept album about Dewees&#x27; drug addiction and subsequent rehab, it was originally to be self-titled &quot;Reggie and the Full Effect&quot;. The original concept had 15 tracks that formed one solid piece of music, each track flowing seamlessly from the last. After a year and a half, Vagrant put the album in the hands of a new mixer, removed 3 tracks and released &quot;Last Stop: Crappy Town&quot; on June 17, 2008. In mid-April 2008, the band&#x27;s MySpace page was reactivated. On August 27, 2008, the band announced via MySpace the release of a B-side entitled &quot;Shit Sandwich&quot; available for free download.

It was announced via MySpace that the band would be doing their final tour from August 20 to September 14, 2008, with Leathermouth. However, in an interview with Lawrence.com on June 30, 2008, Dewees made comments about his disappointment that the band would not be touring through his hometown of Kansas City, Missouri, and that he hoped they could play shows there on future tours. This brought into question whether or not this would be the last for the band. At shows on this tour, Dewees announced that the &#x27;Final Tour&#x27; thing was just a joke and a ploy to get more people to show up.

He also spoke about fan reaction to the more serious tone of the album saying that &quot;Reggie fans feel betrayed that there are no Common Denominator and no Fluxuation songs on this record. It&#x27;s like, shit wasn&#x27;t very fun and happy – it was actually pretty fucking spooky and serious. I can&#x27;t pretend that it didn&#x27;t happen ... It took time, and now that I feel comfortable getting back to being a silly jackass, cool.&quot;

In that same interview, Dewees confirmed that he is currently writing a full album for his British electropop alter-ego &quot;Fluxuation&quot;, one that had been rumored for some time. Dewees had performed 2 half done songs at some of the last tour dates. However, he has not mentioned a release for his other pseudonym, &quot;Common Denominator&quot;.

At the end of the Farewell Tour, Dewees said, in the September 8, 2008 interview with Mishmash Magazine, that he will be &quot;jumping right back into things&quot; musically. Though he has not disclosed details of his plans, he did say that they involve &quot;an old band from the &#x27;90s and early 2000s.&quot; The musical plans Dewees has announced were rumored to be a reunion of his former band The Get Up Kids, and these rumors about their reunion were confirmed by the band on November 13, 2008, and the band played their first show since 2005 on November 16, 2008 in Kansas City.

===Post-&quot;farewell tour&quot; (2008–2013)===
On November 3, 2010, for the first time since 2008, Dewees spoke about the band. He confirmed the band would reunite for a one-off New Year&#x27;s Eve performance on December 31, 2010, at the Theatre of Living Arts in Philadelphia. Dewees confirmed that the show would include surprise guests, also being the band&#x27;s only planned reunion performance, with no plans to reunite and perform again in the future, calling it a &quot;mini reunion&quot;. During the show, the band debuted a new dance-pop-influenced song entitled &quot;Someone Please Tell Mark&#x27;s Vagina to Shut Up&quot;, which was sung by Dewees as Fluxuation.

It was announced in December 2012 that James Dewees and Matt Pryor would be doing a five-date tour in January 2013 on the East Coast. They plan to be playing Reggie and the Full Effect, The Get Up Kids, The New Amsterdams, and Pryor&#x27;s solo material on this tour. In the lead-up to the tour, Pryor and Dewees did a weekly podcast called &quot;Tuesdays With Reggie&quot;; they discussed topics ranging from Dewees&#x27; drug addiction, rehab and the end of Reggie in 2008 to a potential sixth studio album, tentatively titled &quot;No Country for Old Musicians&quot;.

===&quot;No Country For Old Musicians&quot; (2013–2014)===

On March 13, 2013, Dewees launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding project to fund a new album, &quot;No Country For Old Musicians&quot;. The Kickstarter succeeded and Dewees recorded the album over the summer of 2013, releasing it on November 19, 2013 in conjunction with Pure Noise Records. The band played Riot Fest Chicago in September 2013, before embarking on a tour in early 2014 in support of the record. Opening acts on the tour included Buffalo, NY&#x27;s Pentimento and Michigan&#x27;s Dads.

===Say Anything/Saves The Day/Reggie and The Full Effect Album Anniversaries Tour (2014)===
On September 4, 2014, Alternative Press announced a tour featuring Say Anything, Saves the Day, and Reggie and The Full Effect. Say Anything would perform their debut full-length, &quot;...Is A Real Boy&quot;, in full to celebrate its 10th anniversary. Saves The Day performed &quot;Through Being Cool&quot; in full for its 15th anniversary. Reggie and the Full Effect performed &quot;Under The Tray&quot; in full for its 11th anniversary. The tour was over 6 weeks and featured the members of Buffalo, NY&#x27;s Pentimento as The Full Effect. The tour began November 14 in San Diego where up until the day after Thanksgiving, the band performed in pilgrim costumes with Dewees as a cooked turkey. Post-Thanksgiving, the band performed as elves with Dewees as Santa.

===&quot;41&quot; (2017-present)===
On December 6, 2017, Pure Noise announced the release of the seventh album by Reggie and the Full Effect, titled &quot;41&quot;. The album was titled after Dewees&#x27; age at the time, and in conjunction with its cover, lampoons the motif of Adele&#x27;s discography (particularly &quot;21&quot;). Pure Noise also released the single, &quot;The Horrible Year&quot;, as well as announcing a spring 2018 tour with Senses Fail. The album was released on February 23, 2018.

Former drummer Billy Johnson, who was a member of the band from 2006 to 2014, died on February 13, 2018.

==Format==
Dewees plays nearly every instrument on Reggie and the Full Effect recordings, including bass guitar, drums, and keyboards. Each album also includes songs by alternate personas, acted out by Dewees in various styles. Fluxuation (who is reminiscent of artists from the new wave and New Romantic styles), and Common Denominator, a Finnish Metal band with more industrial learnings similar to that of Germany&#x27;s Rammstein.

Reggie&#x27;s lineup for live performances has always changed frequently, but often contained members of The Get Up Kids, Coalesce, The Esoteric, and My Chemical Romance – with whose projects Dewees has also collaborated. Other members of the live show have included musicians from the bands Hot Rod Circuit, The Anniversary, From Autumn to Ashes, Ultimate Fakebook, Morning Again, Poison the Well, Shots Fired, and Slipknot. The current live lineup includes 3 members of the band Pentimento. Many of these musicians have also contributed to the recording of various albums, including Matt Pryor, Rob Pope, &amp; Ryan Pope of The Get Up Kids, Paul Gray of Slipknot, Cory White of Coalesce and The Esoteric, Frank Iero of My Chemical Romance and Jeramiah Pauly of Pentimento.

<text>Internet Neutral Exchange (INEX) is an Internet exchange located in Ireland, operating three VLANs at points of presence in Dublin at Equinix DB1 - Citywest, BT - Citywest, Equinix DB2 (Formerly Data Electronics) - Kilcarbery Park, Interxion DUB1 and DUB2 - Park West and Equinix DB3 - Northwest Business Park, Ballycoolin and a separate exchange, INEX Cork, at CIX in Cork.

The system provides a modern layer 2 ethernet switching network supporting IPv4 and IPv6 peerings on three VLANs, with supported access speeds of 1 Gbit/s, 10 Gbit/s and 100 Gbit/s. The membership of INEX includes most of the large/medium Internet service providers (ISPs) based in Ireland, a growing number of digital content providers, the Irish Government network, VoIP providers and mobile operators. There is an associate membership category for non-trafficking organisations that have an interest in networking within the Irish IP community.

&quot;Internet Neutral Exchange Association Company Limited by Guarantee&quot; is incorporated as a company limited by guarantee and is registered at the Companies Registration Office in Dublin, No. 253804. Each of its members is entitled to vote at general meetings. INEX maintains an executive board of 7 people, elected from its member representatives, and all board members must resign after two consecutive years service. Board members may be re-elected.

==History==

Planning for INEX started in 1996 and it became operational in April 1997 with the backing of its four founding members; EUnet Ireland, HEAnet, Indigo and Telecom Internet with the objective of locally exchanging IP traffic between Irish-based ISPs, rather than using an external exchange or transit providers. As of October 2018, the Association had 103 full, 5 pro-bono, and 23 associate members.

In late 2019, a number of directors resigned over disagreements on the company&#x27;s governance. A subsequent letter to members announced an outside consultant would be appointed to “undertake a root and branch review of Inex and its corporate structure”.

<text>A bota bag is a traditional Spanish liquid receptacle, used mainly as a wineskin. It is often made out of leather (when made of goatskin it is simply known as a goatskin), and is typically used to carry wine, although any liquid can be filled into it.

== Construction ==

Traditionally, bota bags were lined with goat bladders, in other cases tree sap or other resins were used to prevent liquids from seeping through. Modern bota bags have a plastic liner and nozzle.

== Variants ==

The &quot;zahato&quot; is the traditional goatskin bottle of the Basque shepherds. With its narrow nozzle, it is possible to drink &quot;zurrust&quot;, i.e. intercepting the jet without touching the bottle. The name of &quot;zahato&quot; or &quot;zahako&quot; (variants: &quot;xahako&quot; , &quot;zarako&quot;) is a diminutive &quot;zahat-to/-ko&quot; of &quot;zahagi&quot; &#x27;big goatskin bottle&#x27;. Its manufacturer is a &quot;zahatogile&quot;.

The zahato is made of two pieces of tanned and close-cropped goatskin. Softened, they are cut out on a last and are sewn on their sides. Then the bottle is turned up, seam and hair inside. After drying, it is inflated, then coated with pitch to make it impermeable. The nozzle, traditionally in horn, is fixed by a red collar. The zahato is carried across the shoulder with the red cord which surrounds it along the seam.

<text>Heeswijk is a Dutch village. It is located in the province of North Brabant, in the south of the Netherlands.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in the 12th century as &quot;Albertus de Essuic&quot;, and means &quot;settlement in the shrubbery&quot;. Heeswijk is a stretched out settlement in the valley of brook and dates from the Early Middle Ages.

The Premonstratensian abbey was established in the late-12th century as an outpost of the Berne Abbey. In 1546, &quot;Het Slotje&quot; was built for the monks as an L-shaped building with a square tower in the corner. After the Berne Abbey was dissolved in 1648, some monks moved to the , an enclave of Palatinate-Neuburg within the Dutch Republic, and founded a new abbey in Heeswijk. Between 1857 and 1868, a neoclassic monastery was built and a wing was added between the old and new buildings.

The Catholic St Willibrordus Church was built between 1895 and 1896. The tower was damaged during World War II and replaced after the war. Heeswijk Castle was originally built in the 12th century. In 1835, it was nearly doubled in size by Baron van den Bogaerde.

Heeswijk was home to 225 people in 1840. Heeswijk was a separate municipality until 1969, when it merged with the adjacent village of Dinther. Since 1 January 1994 it has been part of the larger municipality of Bernheze, which comprises Heesch, Heeswijk-Dinther, Loosbroek, Nistelrode and Vorstenbosch.,

<doc id="896572" wikidata="Q7422533" url="?curid=896572" title="Sarah Lewitinn">
<text>Sarah Lewitinn (born February 3, 1980), also known by her nickname Ultragrrrl, is an American record producer, music critic, DJ, blogger, and music director for the Canadian fashion brand, Aritzia. She began her career as an assistant editor at &quot;Spin Magazine&quot;, and soon helped champion rock bands like My Chemical Romance and The Killers, which led to her starting her own record label, Stolen Transmission. In 2006, &quot;New York&quot; magazine named Lewitinn as one of the most &quot;influential people in music&quot;, citing that &quot;Like it or not, she has more power than any print music critic.&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in New York City to Egyptian-Jewish parents, Lewitinn was raised and educated in Tenafly, New Jersey. She began her career as a teenager writing for the AOL-based ABC Kidz site before interning at Spin Magazine. It was at that time she received the moniker of &quot;Ultragrrrl&quot;, by which she continues to be known. After briefly working at the defunct Kurt Andersen-run Inside.com in 1999, Lewitinn was hired as an assistant to Michael Hirschorn at VH1. Lewitinn graduated with a degree in Advertising and Marketing from Fashion Institute of Technology in 2001.

In 2002, she was the first manager for both rock bands stellastarr* and My Chemical Romance, both prior to their first major record deals. Her blog, Ultragrrrl.com (launched in July 2003), further established her as a taste-maker in the New York indie rock scene, as did her early championing of the rock band The Killers before they were signed to Island Def Jam. She returned to Spin several months later, this time as an assistant editor with her own column, &quot;Making out with Ultragrrrl.&quot; In 2005, Lewitinn quit Spin to start her own record label, Stolen Transmission in partnership with Island Def Jam and Rob Stevenson, the Island Def Jam A&amp;R executive responsible for signing The Killers as well as Fall Out Boy, Thrice, and The Bravery. Bands which were signed or had releases by Stolen Transmission include The Oohlas, The Horrors, PlayRadioPlay!, Monty Are I, Permanent ME, Schoolyard Heroes, The Photo Atlas, Innerpartysystem, and Bright Light Fever. Though Stolen Transmission severed its official relationship with Island Def Jam in December 2007, Lewitinn edited IDJ&#x27;s parent company Universal Music Group&#x27;s short-lived website, Dance Hall.

In January 2008, Lewitinn, along with Stevenson, launched For The Win! Media, an Internet marketing company focused on promoting bands and Web sites. Clients have included Pet Shop Boys, Lady Sovereign, The Verve and The Futureheads as well as the film &quot;Anvil! The Story of Anvil&quot;. However, in August 2008, Stevenson was named president of EMI&#x27;s Virgin US label. In November 2008, Lewitinn became a featured presenter and on-air talent for FUSE&#x27;s show &quot;Fuse On Tour&quot; where she presents &quot;The Ultragrrrl Report&quot;. Lewitinn left for The Win! Media in 2009 and is now a member of the Digital Strategy Team at the public relations firm Edelman. Sarah provided a lot of smart counsel at Edelman but she was often criticized for throwing around the F bomb and not being &quot;office trained.&quot;

Lewitinn is also a DJ and, along with New York-based publicist Karen Ruttner, threw a weekly party also called &quot;Stolen Transmission&quot; at various locations on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, including Pete Wentz&#x27;s bar, Angels &amp; Kings. The Stolen Transmission party won two Paper Magazine Nightlife Awards for People&#x27;s Choice Best Party in 2005 and 2006 and Lewitinn herself won People&#x27;s Choice for Best Deejay those two years as well. In October 2009, Lewitinn went on tour as the backing DJ for Grammy-nominated R&amp;B singer-songwriter Melanie Fiona. Lewitinn also joined the 9th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians&#x27; careers.

Lewitinn has published two books, both released by Simon Spotlight, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster. Her first was &quot;The Pocket DJ&quot;, a guide to &quot;building the best music library&quot;, divided into &quot;Essential Genres&quot; the best music of certain eras and genres, &quot;Essential Artists&quot; a list of musicians who are important to pop culture or have &quot;a profound influence on music&quot; including such diverse artists as Eminem, The Beatles, Nirvana, Madonna, Björk and Queen, &quot;Celebrity Playlists&quot;, recommended music from DJs, musicians and others and &quot;Other Playlists&quot;, a list of various situations with recommended songs for them, ranging from pool parties to playlists for going back to school. Her second book, &quot;Pocket Karaoke&quot; featured karaoke song lists, including those contributed by Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran and Mikey Way of My Chemical Romance.

In January 2021, Lewitinn began a romantic partnership with the world-renowned chef, Daniel Patterson, after meeting the same month on a dating app during the coronavirus pandemic. They were married in August 2022, in Copenhagen. and live together in Los Angeles, CA.

<text>Throughput accounting (TA) is a principle-based and simplified management accounting approach that provides managers with decision support information for enterprise profitability improvement. This approach identifies the factors which limit an organization&#x27;s ability to reach its goals, and then focuses on simple measures that drive behavior in key areas aimed at reaching those goals.

TA was proposed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt as an alternative to traditional cost accounting. It differs from costing, in it is cash focused and does not allocate all costs (variable and fixed expenses, including overheads) to products and services sold or provided by an enterprise, and it does not replace the need to prepare formal company accounts, although promoters of TA note that management decisions are not generally based on formal company accounts anyway.

Only costs that vary totally with units of output (see the definition of TVC below) e.g. raw materials, are allocated to products and services. These costs are deducted from sales to determine Throughput. Throughput Accounting is a management accounting technique used as the performance measure in the Theory of Constraints (TOC). It is the business intelligence used for maximizing profits, however, unlike cost accounting that primarily focuses on &#x27;cutting costs&#x27; and reducing expenses to make a profit, Throughput Accounting primarily focuses on generating more throughput. Conceptually, Throughput Accounting seeks to increase the speed or rate at which throughput (see definition of T below) is generated by products and services with respect to an organization&#x27;s constraint, whether the constraint is internal or external to the organization. Throughput Accounting is the only management accounting methodology that considers constraints as factors limiting the performance of organizations.

Management accounting is an organization&#x27;s internal set of techniques and methods used to maximize shareholder wealth. Throughput Accounting is thus part of the management accountants&#x27; toolkit, ensuring efficiency where it matters as well as the overall effectiveness of the organization. It is an internal reporting tool. Outside or external parties to a business depend on accounting reports prepared by financial (public) accountants who apply Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and enforced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other local and international regulatory agencies and bodies such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Throughput Accounting improves profit performance with better management decisions by using measurements that more closely reflect the effect of decisions on three critical monetary variables (throughput, investment (AKA inventory), and operating expense — defined below).

== History ==
When cost accounting was developed in the 1890s, labor was the largest fraction of product cost and could be considered a variable cost. Workers often did not know how many hours they would work in a week when they reported on Monday morning because time-keeping systems were rudimentary. Cost accountants, therefore, concentrated on how efficiently managers used labor since it was their most important variable resource. Now however, workers who come to work on Monday morning almost always work 40 hours or more; their cost is fixed rather than variable. However, today, many managers are still evaluated on their labor efficiencies, and many &quot;downsizing&quot;, &quot;rightsizing&quot;, and other labor reduction campaigns are based on them.

TA is a more recent development than cost accounting: Corbett&#x27;s &quot;Throughout Accounting&quot;, for example, was published in 1999.

== The concepts of Throughput Accounting ==
Goldratt argues that, under current conditions, labor efficiencies lead to decisions that harm rather than help organizations. Throughput Accounting, therefore, removes standard cost accounting&#x27;s reliance on efficiencies in general, and labor efficiency in particular, from management practice. Many cost and financial accountants agree with Goldratt&#x27;s critique, but they have not agreed on a replacement of their own and there is enormous inertia in the installed base of people trained to work with existing practices.

Constraints accounting, which is a development in the Throughput Accounting field, emphasizes the role of the constraint, (referred to as the Archemedian constraint) in decision making.

Goldratt&#x27;s alternative begins with the idea that each organization has a goal and that better decisions increase its value. The goal for a profit maximizing firm is stated as increasing net profit now and in the future. Profit maximization seen from a Throughput Accounting viewpoint, is about maximizing a system&#x27;s profit mix without Cost Accounting&#x27;s traditional allocation of total costs. Throughput Accounting actions include obtaining the maximum net profit in the minimum time period, given limited resource capacities and capabilities. These resources include machines, capital (own or borrowed), people, processes, technology, time, materials, markets, etc. Throughput Accounting applies to not-for-profit organizations too, where they develop their goal that makes sense in their individual cases, and these goals are commonly measured in goal units.

Throughput Accounting also pays particular attention to the concept of &#x27;bottleneck&#x27; (referred to as &quot;constraint&quot; in the Theory of Constraints) in the manufacturing or servicing processes.

Throughput Accounting uses three measures of income and expense: 

* Throughput (T) is the rate at which the system produces &quot;goal units&quot;. When the goal units are money (in for-profit businesses), throughput is net sales (S) less totally variable cost (TVC), generally the cost of the raw materials (T = S – TVC). Note that T only exists when there is a sale of the product or service. Producing materials that sit in a warehouse does not form part of throughput but rather investment. (&quot;Throughput&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;throughput contribution&quot; and has similarities to the concept of &quot;contribution&quot; in marginal costing which is sales revenues less &quot;variable&quot; costs – &quot;variable&quot; being defined according to the marginal costing philosophy.)
* Investment (I) is the money tied up in the system. This is money associated with inventory, machinery, buildings, and other assets and liabilities. In earlier Theory of Constraints (TOC) documentation, the &quot;I&quot; was interchanged between &quot;inventory&quot; and &quot;investment.&quot; The preferred term is now only &quot;investment.&quot; Note that TOC recommends inventory be valued strictly on totally variable cost (TVC) associated with creating the inventory, not with additional cost allocations from overhead.
* Operating expense (OE) is the money the system spends in generating &quot;goal units.&quot; For physical products, OE is all expenses except the cost of the raw materials. OE includes maintenance, utilities, rent, taxes and payroll.

Organizations that wish to increase their attainment of their goal should therefore require managers to test proposed decisions against three questions. Will the proposed change:

# Increase throughput? How?
# Reduce investment (inventory) (money that cannot be used)? How?
# Reduce operating expense? How?

The answers to these questions determine the effect of proposed changes on system wide measurements:

# Net profit (NP) = throughput – operating expense = T – OE
# Return on investment (ROI) = net profit / investment = NP/I
# TA Productivity = throughput / operating expense = T/OE
# Investment turns (IT) = throughput / investment = T/I

These relationships between financial ratios as illustrated by Goldratt are very similar to a set of relationships defined by DuPont and General Motors financial executive Donaldson Brown about 1920. Brown did not advocate changes in management accounting methods, but instead used the ratios to evaluate traditional financial accounting data.

== Explanation ==

:formula_1

:formula_2

For example: The railway coach company was offered a contract to make 15 open-topped streetcars each month, using a design that included ornate brass foundry work, but very little of the metalwork needed to produce a covered rail coach. The buyer offered to pay $280 per streetcar. The company had a firm order for 40 rail coaches each month for $350 per unit.

:The cost accountant determined that the cost of operating the foundry vs. the metalwork shop each month was as follows:

:The company was at full capacity making 40 rail coaches each month. And since the foundry was expensive to operate, and purchasing brass as a raw material for the streetcars was expensive, the accountant determined that the company would lose money on any streetcars it built. He showed an analysis of the estimated product costs based on standard cost accounting and recommended that the company decline to build any streetcars.

:However, the company&#x27;s operations manager knew that recent investment in automated foundry equipment had created idle time for workers in that department. The constraint on production of the railcoaches was the metalwork shop. She made an analysis of profit and loss if the company took the contract using throughput accounting to determine the profitability of products by calculating &quot;throughput&quot; (revenue less variable cost) in the metal shop.

:After the presentations from the company accountant and the operations manager, the president understood that the metal shop capacity was limiting the company&#x27;s profitability. The company could make only 40 rail coaches per month. But by taking the contract for the streetcars, the company could make nearly all the railway coaches ordered, and also meet all the demand for streetcars. The result would increase throughput in the metal shop from $6.25 to $10.38 per hour of available time, and increase profitability by 66 percent.

== Relevance ==
One of the most important aspects of Throughput Accounting is the relevance of the information it produces. Throughput Accounting reports what currently happens in business functions such as operations, distribution and marketing. It does not rely solely on GAAP&#x27;s financial accounting reports (that still need to be verified by external auditors) and is thus relevant to current decisions made by management that affect the business now and in the future. Throughput Accounting is used in Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM), Drum Buffer Rope (DBR)—in businesses that are internally constrained, in Simplified Drum Buffer Rope (S-DBR) —in businesses that are externally constrained (particularly where the lack of customer orders denotes a market constraint), as well as in strategy, planning and tactics, etc.

<doc id="896580" wikidata="Q4593838" url="?curid=896580" title="Tornado outbreak of April 15–16, 1998">
<text>The tornado outbreak of April 15–16, 1998, also known as the 1998 Nashville tornado outbreak, was a two-day tornado outbreak that affected portions of the Midwestern United States, Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on April 15 and April 16, 1998, with the worst of the outbreak taking place on the second day. On that day, 13 tornadoes swept through Middle Tennessee—two of them touching down in Nashville, causing significant damage to the downtown and East Nashville areas. Nashville became the first major city in nearly 20 years to have an F2 or stronger tornado make a direct hit in the downtown area.

In addition, the outbreak produced several other destructive tornadoes in Middle Tennessee. One of them, southwest of Nashville, was an F5 tornado—one of only two (the only official one) ever recorded in the state (the other, unofficial however, being in Pinson, Tennessee in 1923). That tornado remained mainly in rural areas of Wayne and Lawrence counties. Other tornadoes during the 2-day outbreak struck Arkansas, Alabama, Illinois, and Kentucky.

12 people were killed by tornadoes during the outbreak: two in Arkansas, three in Kentucky, and seven in Tennessee (one in Nashville, three in Wayne County, and three more elsewhere).

This tornado outbreak occurred at the end of the record-setting 1997–1998 El Niño event.

==Meteorological synopsis==
One week after the Birmingham tornado outbreak took place across Alabama and Georgia on April 8–9, 1998 and several other Midwestern and Eastern United States states on April 6–7, a similar pattern developed across the Midwest and southeastern United States starting on April 16, 1998. A very strong low pressure system developed across the central part of North America and was associated with a long cold front. Ahead of the storm, the warm moist air generated from the Gulf of Mexico increased the likelihood for a significant weather event. On April 15, activity developed across the Mid-Mississippi Valley and southern Ohio Valley where several tornadoes touched down in Illinois starting in the late afternoon before moving into Arkansas during the overnight hours where the first fatalities were reported.

On April 16, as the main low-pressure system was near the Great Lakes and its cold front crossing the Mississippi River, dew points reached the mid to upper 60s across the Tennessee Valley while later in the day, CAPE values reached 1600 J/kg while dry air intrusion was also on the rise increasing the threat of severe weather across the area. As the bulk of the supercells moved out of Arkansas, the tornadic activity was slower during the morning hours before re-intensifying west of Nashville early in the afternoon. Major tornadoes struck from southern Tennessee to southern Kentucky with additional storms as far north as Michigan and several other storms in Alabama across Walker and Cullman Counties, which was slightly north of the areas that were hardest hit by the previous outbreak.
==Confirmed tornadoes==

===Downtown Nashville===


This tornado, rated F3, touched down near the intersection of Charlotte Pike and Forty-Sixth Avenue and traveled directly through downtown Nashville. The tornado manifested itself as a large area of rapidly rotating rain curtains and dark clouds, rather than a traditional funnel. After crossing the Cumberland River, it passed through East Nashville, Donelson, and Hermitage before finally lifting northwest of Lebanon in extreme northern Wilson County. An ROTC student from Vanderbilt University was trapped under a fallen tree in Centennial Park and later died from his injuries. The tornado blew many windows out of office buildings. Many large buildings, including skyscrapers, were damaged. The TPAC building had over 100 windows blown out. 30 small airplanes were damaged at Cornelia Fort Airport. 35 total buildings in downtown Nashville were deemed structurally unsound after the tornado. The tornado blew down 3 construction cranes on the construction site of the Tennessee Oilers&#x27; football stadium near the Cumberland River, before crossing the river. Many signs were downed throughout downtown as well.

The tornado continued east and hit the residential section of East Nashville. At least 300 homes were damaged in East Nashville, many of which lost a good part of their roofs, with a few destroyed. Trees were uprooted and telephone poles were knocked down in this area. A nursing home was hit and all the residents had to be evacuated. A church, which was well over 100 years old, received major damage. It then re-crossed the Cumberland River, where more trees were downed and more homes and other buildings were damaged across Donelson and Hermitage. Over a thousand trees were blown down at Andrew Jackson&#x27;s home, The Hermitage. Some of those trees were well over 200 years old, with a few having been planted by Andrew Jackson himself.

The tornado moved into Wilson County, downing many trees, power lines, and signs. Several homes suffered mostly roof damage in the area. A baseball field and a lumber yard were damaged in Mt. Juliet. Part of the roof was taken off a bank in Mt. Juliet as well. The tornado then continued across rural Wilson County and produced sporadic damage before it dissipated just south of the Cumberland River in extreme northern Wilson County. A 2013 reanalysis noted that tornado would have likely been rated EF2 if the Enhanced Fujita Scale was operational at that time.

Nearly 22 years later, a long-tracked high-end EF3 tornado passed just north of Downtown Nashville just after midnight on March 3, 2020. That tornado moved along a more easterly path that intersected with the path of this tornado in East Nashville. It then continued east along Interstate 40 through Wilson and Smith counties. That tornado killed five people, injured 220, and caused $1.504 billion in damage, making it the 6th costliest tornado in US history.
===Deerfield-Lawrenceburg, Tennessee===

No fatalities were reported with this F5 wedge tornado as it touched down just inside Wayne County and traveled through sparsely populated areas of Lawrence County, west and northwest of Lawrenceburg. There were 21 injuries, however. It did not significantly affect any towns along its path.

However, many large and well-built homes with anchor bolts were completely leveled with some swept clean from their foundations, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards. One truck was rumored to have been taken about , though this was never confirmed. A 200-foot section of grass was scoured away at a pasture, leaving only bare soil behind. Clumps of dirt were pulled up as well. Many trees and power lines were downed as well as 75 utility poles. Some of the trees were completely debarked, and several livestock were killed as well.

It is the most recent Tennessee F5/EF5 and only official one as the March 11, 1923 Pinson tornado took place before the introduction of the Fujita scale and before records were officially kept.

This tornado originally extended from Hardin County southeast of Savannah through Wayne, Lawrence, Giles, and Maury counties as one long-track F5. A 2013 reanalysis determined there were three separate tornadoes with distinct path breaks. The first tornado was rated high-end F4 in Hardin and Wayne counties. The second was the F5 tornado in Lawrence County, and the third, another rated F4, tracked from northern Lawrence through Giles and Maury counties. Due to the media coverage surrounding the Nashville tornado, this tornado has been referred to as &quot;The Forgotten F5&quot;.
===Other tornadoes===
====South Central Kentucky====
South Central Kentucky also received severe weather from this outbreak. The most notable of the storms that occurred in South Central Kentucky that day was a particularly strong supercell storm that dumped baseball-sized hail on central Warren County including the Bowling Green central business district and Western Kentucky University causing massive amounts of damage to cars as well as structures. The storm also caused flash flooding in the area of WKU&#x27;s main campus. The damage from the hail was so great that it seemed to overshadow the F3 tornado event happening in the southern part of the county, which was more rural. The tornado then moved into Barren County actually crossing a bend in the northern portion of Barren River Lake near the small town of Lucas. The tornado then would pass just south of downtown Glasgow and cross the Cumberland Parkway just west of the Barren/Metcalfe county line. It would then dissipate right at that county line. An F2 was later spawned by this supercell in Metcalfe County, crossing the Cumberland Parkway in the western part of the county and passing just to the south of the county seat, Edmonton.

<doc id="896590" wikidata="Q1386101" url="?curid=896590" title="Vesa Toskala">
<text>Vesa Tapani Toskala (born May 20, 1977) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey goaltender.

After initially playing for his hometown team Ilves of the SM-liiga, Toskala played the majority of his professional career in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the San Jose Sharks, Toronto Maple Leafs and Calgary Flames.

==Early career==
Toskala was selected by San Jose in the fourth round, 90th overall, in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. Toskala turned heads with his stellar play in the 1998–99 season with Ilves of the Finnish SM-liiga, where he went 21–12–0 with a 2.14 goals against average, a 0.916 save percentage and five shutouts. The next season, playing a style that modeled after Markus Korhonen, Toskala played with Färjestad BK of the Swedish Elitserien and posted an impressive 2.59 GAA. Toskala considered quitting hockey to attend school full-time, until the San Jose Sharks enticed him to North America.

Toskala is the only San Jose Sharks goalie to record a multiple point game. He had two assists against Chicago on February 3, 2007.

===North American career===
In his first North American season in 2000–01, Toskala played for the Kentucky Thoroughblades of the American Hockey League (AHL). Splitting time with second-year pro and Finnish compatriot Miikka Kiprusoff, he played 44 games, posting a 22–13–5 record with a 2.77 goals against average and a 0.911 save percentage, quickly adapting to the North American game and played three games for Kentucky in the playoffs. The next year, after the team&#x27;s move to Cleveland, he took over the starting role after Kiprusoff was recalled to the San Jose Sharks, and in 62 games, he went 19–33–7 with a 2.99 GAA and a 0.912 save percentage. That season, he led the league in games played and saves made (1,845). When Kiprusoff fell to injury, Toskala was called up to San Jose to serve as back-up to regular starter Evgeni Nabokov. Toskala received ten minutes of playing time in his first stint in the NHL, where he stopped the two shots he faced.

===San Jose Sharks===
In the 2002–03 NHL season, after Evgeni Nabokov and the Sharks could not settle on a contract, Toskala served as Kiprusoff&#x27;s backup. When Kiprusoff faltered, Toskala stepped in and played admirably, going 4–3–1 with a 2.35 GAA and a 0.927 save percentage. He earned his first shutout in a 25-save effort against the Detroit Red Wings. After Nabokov was re-signed, however, Toskala was sent back to the Sharks&#x27; minor league affiliate in Cleveland, where he struggled, going 15–30–2 with a 3.21 GAA and a 0.903 save percentage. Nonetheless, at the end of the regular season, the Sharks recalled Toskala, meaning the Sharks now carried three goaltenders on their roster. Since Nabokov was the established starter, Kiprusoff and Toskala fought for the backup position; Toskala &quot;won&quot; the battle when Kiprusoff was eventually traded to the Calgary Flames. Although playing in 28 games and posting a 12–8–4 record with a 2.06 GAA and a 0.930 save percentage, Toskala did not make an appearance in the playoffs.

2005–06 proved to be a career year for Toskala. He began as the backup to Evgeni Nabokov, but after a start on February 8, he posted a record of 17–2–2, leading the team to a playoff berth. Toskala&#x27;s goals-against-average fell from 3.25 to 2.55, while his save percentage increased from 0.872 to .900. This earned him the nickname &quot;The Finnish Horse&quot; from Sharks broadcaster Dan Rusanowsky. Toskala&#x27;s play earned him several accolades and relegated Nabokov to the role of backup goaltender. On February 27, the Sharks re-signed Toskala to a two-year contract extension worth US$2.75 million. Toskala finished the playoffs with 2.45 goals-against-average and a 0.910 save percentage.

Since both Toskala and Nabokov were seen as number one goalies, the Sharks attempted to trade one or the other before the season began. No trade occurred, and coach Ron Wilson opted to alternate starts between the two. Through 71 games, Toskala played in 35 games, starting 31 and posting a 2.45 GAA, along with three shutouts. Nabokov received the nod after that, playing in San Jose&#x27;s remaining regular season and playoff games.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
On June 22, during the 2007 NHL Entry Draft weekend, Sharks general manager Doug Wilson traded Toskala and forward Mark Bell to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for the club&#x27;s 2007 first (13th overall, Lars Eller ) and second round draft picks, both of which were later traded to the St. Louis Blues, as well as Toronto&#x27;s fourth round pick in 2009, which was eventually traded to the Nashville Predators.

The Toronto Maple Leafs subsequently signed Toskala to a two-year contract. He and goaltender Andrew Raycroft shared starts until late November, when Toskala&#x27;s GAA and save percentage improved dramatically. He recorded two shutouts in December and the NHL named him best goaltender of the month.
On March 18, 2008, in a match against the New York Islanders, Toskala suffered an embarrassing blunder. On a Leafs power play, defenceman Rob Davison of the Islanders attempted to clear the puck out of his defensive zone. Taken from 174 feet, the shot bounced five times before eventually bouncing over Toskala&#x27;s glove and into the net. It was only Davison&#x27;s third goal in 187 career games.

In the 2009 NHL regular season opener on October 9, 2008, the official scoresheet between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Detroit Red Wings listed Toskala as the Maple Leafs captain. Coach Ron Wilson stated that the scoresheet was a mistake.

On March 4, 2009, Toskala announced that he would be undergoing season-ending surgery to repair a torn acetabular labrum. The Maple Leafs claimed goalie Martin Gerber off of re-entry waivers to replace him.
For the first game of the following season, on October 1, 2009, Toskala was the Maple Leafs starting goaltender in an overtime loss to the Montreal Canadiens. Toskala would lose his first four starts before being replaced as the Leafs&#x27; starting goaltender.

In late 2009, a prank he pulled on interviewer Zdenek Matejovsky received coverage from Finnish news and 424 000 views on YouTube (note: the original video was removed). Matejovsky, who doesn&#x27;t understand Finnish, had been hired by the Finnish TV channel MTV3 to interview Toskala in English and have him respond in Finnish, but Toskala instead made a joke out of it and responded to the serious questions with humorous, unrelated answers. Matejovsky continued with the businesslike questions while having no idea what Toskala was saying.

===Calgary Flames===
Toskala was traded to the Anaheim Ducks along with Jason Blake for Jean-Sébastien Giguère on January 31, 2010,

The Ducks then traded Toskala to the Calgary Flames for backup Curtis McElhinney right before the NHL trade deadline on March 3, 2010, having never appeared in net for the Ducks in his short stint. He was reunited with his former Sharks teammate Miikka Kiprusoff in Calgary. On March 7, in his first game as a Flame, Toskala stopped 27 shots en route to a 5–2 victory. In his second game, he backstopped the Flames to a 3–2 victory over the Colorado Avalanche. On June 6, 2010, it was revealed by Flames general manager Darryl Sutter, that Toskala would not return with the Flames for the 2010–11 season.

===AIK IF===
On November 1, 2010, due to AIK IF of the Elitserien (SEL) suffering from injuries, Toskala signed a one-month contract with the club. Playing in two games, he posted a .898 save percentage and 3.07 goals against average.

===Ilves and retirement===
In June 2011, Toskala signed a contract to return to his hometown team Ilves for the 2011–12 season. With a decline in form and lingering injury at season&#x27;s end, Toskala retired from hockey on October 2, 2012.

==Personal life==
Toskala spent two years in Finland training to be a chef, although he claims that he was &quot;not particularly good.&quot;

After graduation, Redgrave landed a succession of high-profile stage acting roles: in the 1988 stage production of Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Easter&quot;; in &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; in Belfast, Northern Ireland; as Emily in Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot;; as Irina in a 1990 revival of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; in London&#x27;s West End with her aunts Vanessa Redgrave and Lynn Redgrave; in 1993 with Colin Firth in Alexander Griboyedov&#x27;s &quot;Chatsky&quot; at the Almeida Theatre, London; and in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in 2001 at the Albery Theatre (now the Noël Coward Theatre), London, playing Titania alongside Dawn French as Bottom.

First appearing in &quot;The Power of Three&quot; (2012) with the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), Kate is the commander-in-chief of the fictional military organisation UNIT, a role previously occupied by her father before his retirement. The character returned in the fiftieth anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013), which was simulcast on television and in cinemas across the world in 94 countries, earning a Guinness World Record for the world&#x27;s largest ever simulcast of a TV drama.

Kate would go on to become a recurring character in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, with Redgrave reprising the role in episodes with the Twelfth (Peter Capaldi), Thirteenth (Jodie Whittaker), Fourteenth (David Tennant) and Fifteenth (Ncuti Gatwa) Doctors.

<doc id="896598" wikidata="Q3182941" url="?curid=896598" title="Johnny Maxwell">
<text>Johnny Maxwell is a fictional character in a series of three children&#x27;s books by Terry Pratchett. He is a young boy (twelve in the first book, but a teenager in the later ones) living in the (fictional) typical late-20th-century English town of Blackbury (also the setting of Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Truckers&quot;).

Johnny has a difficult home life. Over the course of the three books his parents split up and he and his mother move in with his grandfather. This may be why he starts seeing things no one else sees, including an alien surrender party, ghosts and a time travelling bag lady. On the other hand, it is possible that he sees them because they are actually there and he lacks the filters that stop most people noticing how amazing the world is (a favourite theme of Pratchett&#x27;s).

Apart from this tendency Johnny is almost unnaturally normal. His friend Kirsty often gets exasperated by his tendency to simply accept that strange things happen to him, rather than doing something about it. He has a strong sense of fair play, which leads to him fighting for what&#x27;s right even when he has no idea what&#x27;s going on.

Pratchett has said that Johnny is based, very loosely, on an idea of what Richmal Crompton&#x27;s &quot;Just William&quot; character would be like in a 1990s setting.

==The Gang==
Johnny has a sort of a gang consisting of the kids who hang around with each other because they don&#x27;t fit into any of the school cliques. They are:

*Stephen &#x27;Wobbler&#x27; Johnson. Johnny&#x27;s best friend and the second main character in the book. He is overweight and heavily into computers, an expert at piracy. He wants to be a nerd, but they wouldn&#x27;t let him join. It is his considered opinion that Johnny is mental. His real name is Stephen Johnson in the books, although the television adaptation of &quot;Johnny and the Bomb&quot; gives it as Walter. In &quot;Johnny and the Bomb&quot; Wobbler got stuck in 1941- due to the gang&#x27;s actions in the past accidentally changing history so that he was never born and therefore couldn&#x27;t return to the future where he didn&#x27;t exist- and grew up to be a billionaire calling himself Sir John (Sir Walter in the TV version) but, due to the time travel and multiple timelines involved, where and if this happened is questionable. Certainly a Wobbler returned successfully from 1941.
*Simon &#x27;Bigmac&#x27; Wrigley. An asthmatic skinhead who is deeply embarrassed by his instinctive grasp of mathematics. He lives with his brother in a rundown tower block on the edge of Blackbury. He is not exactly a criminal but has a confused grasp of car ownership. He has a casual friendship with Yo-less, and shows confusion when he is asked to justify why he has a jacket covered in swastikas and pro-Hitler slogans. Wrigley hides his true emotions, and, as seen in &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot; overtries to be, as he puts it &quot;hard&quot;, hanging out near pubs with boys years older than he is. Wrigley is constantly bullied by his older brother, although he knocks his brother out during &quot;Johnny and the Dead&quot;. He is strangely intelligent, and is probably the third most intelligent in the gang, after Kirsty and Yo-less. A running gag is his attraction to cars with the keys still in the ignition. He has apparently stolen and crashed the minister of education&#x27;s car, and was thrown into juvenile hall. His favourite band is Heavy Mental. Wrigley&#x27;s best friend is undoubtedly Wobbler, while he appears to dislike Kirsty. His relationship with Johnny is unclear, although he treats him with a mix of pity and cruelty.
*Yo-less. A West Indian boy so nicknamed by Johnny because he doesn&#x27;t say &quot;Yo!&quot;. Interested in Star Trek, train spotting, Morris dancing and brass band music. His reaction to those who are surprised a black kid has such &quot;uncool&quot; hobbies varies from amusement to irritation. When faced with genuine racism he has a brittle anger that manifests itself in cold, almost emotionlessly delivered, sarcasm.
*Kirsty. (Also known as Sigourney, Kimberly, Klytemnestra and Kasandra). Unlike the rest of the gang, Kirsty is a highly organised person who knows exactly where she&#x27;s going in life. She is highly intelligent but has very poor people skills, something she views as a character flaw in everyone else. She is trying to get Johnny&#x27;s life organised since he is clearly incapable of doing it himself, but hasn&#x27;t realised that he doesn&#x27;t especially &quot;want&quot; his life organised. He finds her very easy to talk to since she never listens. Unlike her most obvious &quot;Discworld&quot; counterparts, Susan Sto Helit and Granny Weatherwax, Kirsty has a tendency to romanticise things hidden beneath her practicality and finds Johnny&#x27;s down-to-Earth attitude to things almost as annoying as his lack of direction.

==Recurring characters==
*Mrs Tachyon
*Sergeant Comely
*Arthur Maxwell

==The novels==
The Johnny Maxwell books are:
*&quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot;
*&quot;Johnny and the Dead&quot;
*&quot;Johnny and the Bomb&quot;

==Other media==
In 1995 a serial based on &quot;Johnny and the Dead&quot; was made for Children&#x27;s ITV. Johnny was played by Andrew Falvery.

In 1996 BBC Radio 4 dramatised &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot;. Johnny was played by Tim Smith.

A CBBC serial based on &quot;Johnny And The Bomb&quot; was broadcast in January 2006. Johnny was played by George MacKay.

==&quot;I just see things other people don&#x27;t see&quot;==
Regarding whether the things that happen to Johnny really do happen or are all a matter of perception, as Johnny escapes his problems by projecting fantasy onto reality, Pratchett has said:

&quot;I can&#x27;t be having with that pernicious rubbish ... To Johnny it&#x27;s all real, and that&#x27;s what counts ... He deals with all the problems on their own terms and half the time he&#x27;s projecting reality onto fantasy... So: is what happens in the books real? Yes. Does it all happen in Johnny&#x27;s head? Yes.&quot;

<text>Scott Christopher Thornton (born January 9, 1971) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey winger who played in the National Hockey League. Scott and former Sharks teammate Joe Thornton are first cousins.

==Playing career==
Thornton was drafted in the first round (third overall) by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. He played thirty-three games for the team his rookie season, accumulating one goal and three assists. He also played left wing for the Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Dallas Stars and San Jose Sharks. He was signed by San Jose as a free agent on July 1, 2000. In his first season with San Jose, he had a career year, scoring twenty goals playing alongside gritty centre Mike Ricci.

He signed a two-year contract $3.42 million contract extension in the 2003–04 season. The first season of the extension coincided with the 2004–05 NHL lockout, and after the second year, Thornton became an unrestricted free agent when the Sharks declined to pick up the one-year team option in his contract. On July 1, 2006, he signed a 2-year, $3 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings. During the 2006–07 season, Thornton was placed on injured reserve due to a wrist injury and missed 23 games as a result.

Thornton announced his retirement on July 28, 2008.

<doc id="896605" wikidata="Q2591737" url="?curid=896605" title="Lillix">
<text>Lillix () was a pop rock band from Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada, formed in 1997 when the early members were in high school. The band was originally an all-girl group under the name Tigerlily composed of guitarist Tasha-Ray Evin, keyboardist Lacey-Lee Evin, bassist Louise Burns, and drummer Sierra Hills. In 2001 the band was signed by Maverick Records and changed their name to Lillix as there was another band called Tigerlily. Hills left in 2002 and was replaced by Kim Urhahn, and later by Alicia Warrington, a future &quot;WWE NXT&quot; ring announcer under the name Alicia Taylor. Urhahn has been among a rare group of left-handed female drummers. The band was considered on hiatus from late 2006 through 2009 due to the folding of their label, Maverick Records, and officially disbanded after the release of their independent third album in 2010. Their debut album &quot;Falling Uphill&quot; was an international success, selling more than half a million copies worldwide.

== Career ==

=== 2001–06: &quot;Falling Uphill&quot; and &quot;Inside the Hollow&quot; ===

Under their original name of Tigerlily, the group sent their demo to an industry lawyer named Jonathan Simkin, who liked the band&#x27;s sound and helped promote them to record labels. The group ultimately ended up signing with Maverick Records in 2001 and changed their name to Lillix. Their debut album &quot;Falling Uphill&quot; was released in Canada and the United States on 27 May 2003 and in Japan on 27 August. &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; was released as the band&#x27;s first single in the spring of 2003 and reached 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Top 40 airplay chart. It was followed that fall by &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, which did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart but did reach number 48 on the &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; CHR/Pop Top 50 chart tracking airplay on contemporary hit radio stations. &quot;Falling Uphill&quot; also featured a cover of &quot;What I Like About You&quot; by The Romantics, which was featured on the 2003 &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; soundtrack, and serves as the theme song for the comedy series of the same name. The band received two nominations at the 2004 Junos. The album has sold more than half a million copies worldwide making it their best selling album.

The second album, &quot;Inside the Hollow&quot;, was released in Canada on 29 August 2006 and in Japan on 6 September. The only single from this album is &quot;Sweet Temptation (Hollow)&quot;. This album&#x27;s release featured drummer Alicia Warrington in October 2005.

=== 2007–10: Hiatus, &quot;Tigerlily&quot;, and disbandment ===
Maverick Records folded in 2007 as part of restructuring after becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Warner Music Group the previous year, and Lillix was not picked back up by Warner Bros. Records, leaving them without a record label. In April 2008, Lillix moved to Vancouver and was preparing to record a new album. On 15 March 2009, the band introduced a new member, Britt Black, and announced the recording of a new single, &quot;Dance Alone&quot;. The song was released on 14 June. It was followed in March 2010 by &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; and was later accompanied by a music video directed by Colin Minihan that premiered on 7 August. The title of the new album was announced on 17 July, to be &quot;Tigerlily&quot; in honour of their original band name.

&quot;Tigerlily&quot; was released in Canada on 24 August and later released in Japan along with two bonus tracks. The first single released was &quot;Dance Alone&quot;, which did not chart but achieved moderate airplay. The album was met by positive reviews; music journalists such as Kate MacRae from &quot;Chart Attack&quot; have stated that &quot;Tigerlily has some pretty good tracks (&quot;7 Days&quot;, &quot;Back Up Girl&quot; and &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot;), Lillix&quot;. In November 2015, an interview with Lacey-Lee was published by SonicBids Blog discussing the band&#x27;s label (Maverick) folding and the struggles they faced afterwards.

<text>John James Rigas (November 14, 1924 – September 30, 2021) was an American businessman who was one of the founders of Adelphia Communications Corporation, which at its peak was one of the largest cable TV companies in the United States. He was also the majority owner of the Buffalo Sabres franchise of the National Hockey League. In 2005, he was convicted on multiple charges of fraud and sentenced to 15 years in prison, serving nine of those years before being released due to declining health.

==Beginnings==
Rigas was born in Wellsville, New York, to Greek immigrants James and Eleni (Brazas) Rigas, who sought a better life in the United States for their children. John had three siblings: Gus, Mary, and Katherine. James was an entrepreneur of some repute in Wellsville, beginning as a shoe-shine man, then in 1921 introducing the Texas hot to Wellsville. The Texas hot stand remains in operation, currently co-owned by John&#x27;s nephew, Chris Rigas. John&#x27;s first job was, at the age of nine, busing tables. After graduating from Wellsville High School, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and was placed in the 20th Armored Division in 1943, seeing combat in France. His division ended up being involved in the liberation of Dachau concentration camp in April 1945. After the war ended he returned to life in Wellsville and, soon afterward, enrolled at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. He studied engineering and earned a bachelor of science degree in management engineering. He was also a member of the Nu Theta chapter of Phi Mu Delta. He then returned to Wellsville, only to take a job with the Sylvania corporation in Emporium, Pennsylvania.

==Business career==
In 1952, Rigas started his first business venture by buying a movie theater in Coudersport, Pennsylvania, a town midway between Wellsville and Emporium. He borrowed the money from his family and friends, including his godfather, James Lucas, to purchase the theater and started operating it in the evenings while he worked days at the Sylvania plant.

The Rigas cable television enterprise first started in Coudersport when the family purchased the town&#x27;s TV cable franchise. Always looking to grow his company, John had teamed with his brother Gus to start Adelphia after buying out his partners. They borrowed heavily to buy more and more suburban cable companies and avoided city franchises. Eventually, Adelphia became the largest cable provider outside Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and South Florida and had systems reaching over 30 states and over 5.6 million customers. Adelphia also launched product lines such as high-speed cable Internet service and long-distance telephone service.

Rigas was honored numerous times, including honorary degrees by three universities. In 1997 he bought the Buffalo Sabres from team co-founder Northrup R. Knox, installing his son Timothy as team president. After considering buying a professional baseball franchise, Rigas opted to relaunch the Wellsville Nitros as a collegiate summer baseball team in 1998. His political contributions include a total of $50,750 to the Republican Party, with which he had affiliation, and placed a strong value in conservative Republican family values.

==Criminal indictment and incarceration==
Rigas resigned from his position as CEO of Adelphia in May 2002 after being indicted for bank fraud, wire fraud, and securities fraud. His sons Timothy and Michael, as well as James Brown and Michael Mulcahey, were also charged with participation in these crimes. The executives were accused of looting the corporation by concealing $2.3 billion in liabilities from corporate investors and of using corporation funds as their funds.

John Rigas was convicted of the charges in the summer of 2004, and on June 27, 2005, was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. Adelphia Corporation filed for bankruptcy after it acknowledged that the three Rigases had taken $3.1 billion in loans that were not recorded on the books. In 2005 John and Timothy were charged with tax evasion and pleaded not guilty in October 2005. On January 27, 2012, the charge of tax evasion was officially dismissed. Following John&#x27;s arrest, the NHL virtually stripped him of his authority over the Sabres. After more than a year as a ward of the league, the franchise was purchased by another western New York multibillionaire, Tom Golisano.

On May 24, 2007, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld John&#x27;s and Timothy&#x27;s 2004 convictions on 17 of the original 18 counts. On June 27, 2007, John and Timothy were ordered to report to prison on August 13 for their fraud convictions. On August 13 John and Timothy reported to the Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, located about 45 minutes northwest of Raleigh, North Carolina, unsuccessful in their request to be allowed to serve their time together at a facility close to their homes in Coudersport, Pennsylvania. On November 1, 2007, after a 20-day bidding war involving 31 bidders, the palatial $30 million former Adelphia Headquarters building in Coudersport was sold to an undisclosed buyer at auction for $3.4 million.

On March 3, 2008, the Supreme Court rejected the final appeal without comment. The case was &quot;Rigas v. U.S.&quot;, 07-494. John&#x27;s original release date was September 4, 2020, but a federal judge reduced his sentence by three years, and his new release date was scheduled to be January 23, 2018. Rigas applied for a presidential pardon in January 2009, but George W. Bush left office without making a decision. Rigas sold his house in Indigo Run, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, to pay for legal fees. Sometime during the week of November 6, 2011, both John and Timothy were transferred to the Low Security Facility of the Allenwood Federal Correctional Complex in Pennsylvania. The Allenwood FCC is located 2 miles north of Allenwood on Route 15, about 11 miles south of Williamsport.

==Illness and death==
On December 14, 2015, Rigas&#x27; lawyers announced that he was terminally ill with bladder cancer and had between one and six months to live. Rigas was diagnosed with cancer before his conviction and, under his sentencing, could seek compassionate release if he had less than three months to live. Judge Kimba Wood issued an order allowing for Rigas&#x27;s release on February 19, 2016. Rigas was alive and well enough to make public appearances by June 2016.

Rigas died in Coudersport, Pennsylvania, on September 30, 2021, at the age of 96.

<text>Shitmat is an English breakcore artist and mashup producer, one of several monikers used by Henry Collins. Shitmat became known in the early 2000s for releases on the Ad Noiseam and Planet Mu labels. He also set up his own label, Wrong Music and put on parties in Brighton. His 2012 project Mash Hits remixed every UK number one single from 1952 onwards. He then stopped the Shitmat project, restarting it again in 2016.

== Background ==
Shitmat is used as a pseudonym by artist Henry Collins, who also uses monikers such as Kyler, Armand Van Hard-On and Misty Conditions. DJ Slipmatt took exception to the name when they were both on the same lineup and insisted on Shitmat&#x27;s name being written in smaller text.

In the early 2000s, Shitmat set up the label Wrong Music and put on events in Brighton. He became known for his mashup productions which blended jungle, breakcore and plunderphonics, released on Ad Noiseam, Planet Mu and his own label. In the 2016 release &quot;Killababylonkutz 2&quot;, Collins produced eleven different tracks all featuring the Baby Cham vocal &quot;Babylon Bwoy&quot;, combined with the Ghostbusters theme tune or music from Slayer, Vengaboys and NOFX. Shitmat termed this genre &quot;mashcore&quot;, as represented by the track &quot;There’s No Business Like Propa&#x27; Rungleclotted Mashup Bizznizz&quot;, played by John Peel.

Shitmat has performed at a number of festivals, including SuperSonic Festival (2006), Hokaben Festival (2008), Glade Festival, Glastonbury Festival (2009), All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties (2010) and Dour Festival (2011).

In 2012, Shitmat decided to remix every UK number one single since 1952, in a project called Mash Hits. This meant working with over 1,200 tracks from artists such as John Lennon, David Bowie, David Cassidy, David Essex and David Sneddon. All the Davids were rolled together into one mashup track.

Shitmat announced in December 2012 that he was ready to kill off his moniker, stating 
&quot;It’s basically time for me to move on, progress, evolve and let the other music I make take the front seat. I’ve always enjoyed experimenting with humour and heavy music but for me, I’d like to launch and explore some of my other projects and ideas&quot;. He planned to release a new album under the name Tafkas (The artist formerly known as Shitmat) on Love Love records. He then restarted the project in 2016, telling Vice News that &quot;I have resurrected Shitmat. I decided I still like DJing, making mashups and being that dickhead&quot;.

<doc id="896632" wikidata="Q1326489" url="?curid=896632" title="Savings and loan crisis">
<text>The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s (commonly dubbed the S&amp;L crisis) was the failure of approximately a third of the savings and loan associations (S&amp;Ls or thrifts) in the United States between 1986 and 1995. These thrifts were banks that historically specialized in fixed-rate mortgage lending. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) closed or otherwise resolved 296 thrifts from 1986 to 1989, whereupon the newly established Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) took up these responsibilities. The two agencies closed 1,043 banks that held $519 billion in assets. The total cost of taxpayers by the end of 1999 was $123.8 billion with an additional $29.1 billion of losses imposed onto the thrift industry.

Starting in 1979 and through the early 1980s, the Federal Reserve sharply increased interest rates in an effort to reduce inflation. At that time, thrifts had issued long-term loans at fixed interest rates that were lower than prevailing deposit rates. Attempts to attract more deposits by offering higher interest rates led to liabilities that could not be paid-for by the lower interest rates at which they had loaned money. Nor could outflowing deposits simply be paid out by sale of now less-valuable assets. The end result was that about one third of S&amp;Ls became insolvent, causing a first wave of failures in 1981–83.

When the problem became apparent, Congress acted to permit thrifts to engage in new lending activities with the hope that they would diversify and become more profitable. This included issuance of adjustable-rate mortgages and permission to enter into commercial real estate lending. Lower capital requirements and permissive accounting standards also allowed weaker thrifts to continue operating even though under the old rules or US GAAP they would have been insolvent. These changes allowed for substantial risk-taking and thrift industry growth. Many new thrifts were formed in the American southwest and levered themselves to substantial size rapidly. The regional concentration of thrift investments there, along with thrifts&#x27; inexperience in the new types of lending they had entered, proved highly fragile. When property prices in those regions dropped in 1986, a second and larger wave of failures started.

The thrift deposit insurer, FSLIC, was unable to pay for all these failures and became insolvent. FSLIC&#x27;s financial weakness, along with congressional pressure, also forced regulators to engage in regulatory forbearance. This allowed insolvent thrifts to remain open and tied FSLIC to capital injections. Attempts to recapitalize FSLIC arrived both too late and in insufficient amounts. Failures continued to mount through 1988 and by February 1989, congressional legislation – the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 – was brought to establish the Resolution Trust Corporation to wind down all remaining insolvent thrifts. The law also brought more stringent capital regulations for thrifts and an increase in supervisory resources. Responsibility for thrift supervision and thrift deposit insurance were also transferred, respectively, to the then-new Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

==Causes==

Thrift institutions originated in the 19th century with the goal of pooling resources among members to make loans with which to purchase residential properties. The industry grew rapidly at over 10% annually in the postwar period amid government support for home financing. At the time, thrifts were regulated by two – or three, if state regulators are included, – institutions. Examinations were conducted by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB); but supervisory authority was separate and resided in regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Conflict of interest concerns also existed in the privately-owned home loan banks, leading to poor working relationships between federal employee examiners and the private supervisors. Delays between examinations and their reports arriving to supervisors also meant that supervisory action, if it were to be taken, would be months late. Weak enforcement powers, along with thrifts&#x27; rights to contest unfavourable reports, meant the Federal Home Loan Bank Board was highly deferential to bank management.

=== Interest rate increases ===

The early 1980s saw a recession along with high interest rates, which stressed both thrift and other banking institutions considerably. Negative net interest margins, due to the low interest earned on assets with high deposit interest expenses needed to retain deposits, caused a wave of thrift failures between 1981 and 1983. Federal regulations, especially Regulation Q, placed caps on deposit interest rates. Depositors responded by withdrawing their cash and depositing them in money market mutual funds. In response to these outflows, Congress passed the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 which phased out Regulation Q interest rate caps and expanded thrift lending powers to include construction loans. The deposit insurance limit was also raised from 40,000 to 100,000 dollars per account. The phase-out of deposit interest rate caps, however, caused thrifts&#x27; deposit interest expenses to increase substantially as they scrambled to retain depositors. The resulting decline in profitability led to a wave of thrift failures in 1981–83.

Many of these failures were outside of their managers&#x27; control. The high and volatile interest rates in the early 1980s meant that even thrifts with diversified residential mortgage portfolios, constrained by existing price caps, became unable to meet their obligations. The historical institutional characteristics of thrift institutions – low loss rates accompanied by low earnings and capital – were stable but severely challenged by these market conditions.

=== Deregulation and commercial lending ===

The 1981 Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act completed a process of deregulation that provided relief to weak thrifts by allowing their deposit insurer, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), to provide direct capital injections through &quot;net worth certificates&quot;. The Garn–St. Germain Act also hugely expanded thrift lending powers, allowing them to engage in commercial real estate and line-of-credit lending, which many thrifts eagerly exploited. Between 1980 and 1986, thrifts&#x27; residential mortgage holdings as a proportion of assets fell from over 80 percent to less than 60.

These new lending powers were not accompanied by any increase in supervisory resources or powers. The view at the time was that the interest rate environment would quickly ease, allowing for thrifts to restructure their asset portfolios, and that expanded lending powers would allow for thrifts to diversify their portfolios and engage in more profitable lending activities. It was expected that thrifts would continue being the relatively docile institutions they had then always been and diversify their portfolios prudently; few believed at the time that these deregulatory episodes would allow thrifts engage in excessively risky lending. 

Many of the loans made under expanded lending powers were concentrated in rapidly-growing states such as California, Florida, and Texas. Lax state supervision and highly permissive leverage restraints allowed thrifts in these states to expand rapidly, taking on considerable risk concentrated in these business lines and geographic regions. The highly-sensitive nature of commercial real estate values to local economic conditions made these thrifts highly sensitive to those local economic conditions. These issues were compounded by the relative inexperience of thrift staff in evaluating risks of commercial lending and equity investments.

The deregulatory policy of the Reagan administration, enforced by its appointment of thrift executive Edwin J. Gray, reduced thrift examinations between 1981 and 1984 by 26 percent. Normalized per institution or by assets held, FSLIC-insured institutions&#x27; supervisory resources were stretched. However, Gray&#x27;s position reversed after the fraud-induced failure of Texas-based Empire Savings and Loan: he spent the next two years increasing examination resources and tightening financial regulations. Such efforts were, however, not supported by industry groups or the Reagan administration.

=== Forbearance ===
Attempts to smooth over rough market environments included considerable regulatory forbearance: when a regulator decides not to apply regulations that normally would disrupt the operation of a bank. The FHLBB therefore progressively lowered net worth requirements from five percent in 1980 to three percent in 1982. Lax phase-in rules also meant that many newer savings and loan institutions could be required to have net worth requirements lower than three percent; in fact, new institutions could be levered from two million dollars in capital to $1.3 billion in assets (a multiple of 650) in about a year.

FHLBB also chose to adopt regulatory accounting principles which allowed institutions to defer reporting of losses and treat more instruments as capital. Accounting rules over supervisory goodwill (a type of intangible asset) were also liberalized, making it easier for thrifts to purchase insolvent thrifts. Since this substituted for the normal cash injections from FSLIC due to the insurer&#x27;s limited financial resources, this utilised such goodwill as essentially an accounting fiction. Such lenient accounting rules, however, also had the effect of preventing the FHLBB from intervening against thinly-capitalised institutions whose balance sheets were supported by intangibles. Policy responses chosen by the Reagan administration, and adopted by the FHLBB under pressure, also led to demands not to use taxpayer money. Along with political demands not to alarm the public by closing institutions, these constraints forced FHLBB into a policy of &quot;hiding the poor condition of [thrifts] behind accounting gimmicks&quot;.

By 1983, even though the interest rate environment had substantially eased, a tenth of thrifts were insolvent on a GAAP basis, with those institutions controlling 35 percent of thrift industry assets. Even so, such institutions were allowed to continue operating and thereby exposed taxpayers to eventual losses through their failure and following deposit insurance claims.

=== Fraud ===
Several high-profile casualties of the crisis involved fraud. A variety of methods were identified. For example, a thrift officer could extract compensation and other benefits from origination fees on low-quality loans. Alternatively, they could collude with developers to book paper profits that were extracted and eventually placed on the government, or simply pay themselves high compensation until the thrift became bankrupt, and place the responsibility for paying off depositors onto FSLIC. William K. Black gained considerable notoriety for his leadership in prosecuting Charles Keating, who was temporarily successful in blocking Black&#x27;s investigations, because campaign contributions coordinated by Keating had saved Jim Wright from financial ruin and elevated him to the Speaker of the House. Keating also had bought support from five US Senators, but it was not enough to keep him out of prison. Black said that many senior executives can find accountants and auditors willing to conspire to commit fraud; he coined the term &quot;control fraud&quot; to describe this phenomenon.

However, such fraud was not the core reason for the crisis. Estimates of the number of failures that involve fraud or insider abuse ranges considerably due to the difficulty in detecting fraud and distinguishing it from bad business judgment. An Office of the Comptroller of the Currency study in 1988 indicated fraud in 11 percent of failures between 1979–87; a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation study in 25 percent of failures in 1989; a Resolution Trust Corporation study in 1992 found fraud in 33 percent of its cases; and a 1994 General Accounting Office study reported 26 percent of banks that failed in 1990–91 had issues with fraud. The most clear cases of fraud both within and without of the thrift system were concentrated in a few large institutions that had grown substantially and were alleged to have conspired to manipulate junk bond markets with thrift directors for personal gain.

Regardless, there was fraud and insider abuse in many cases. The Crime Control Act of 1990, after the crisis, established a special counsel to investigate and prosecute fraud in financial institutions. Between 1988 and 1992, the Department of Justice sent 1,706 bankers to prison and found guilty verdicts in 2,603 cases. Expert estimates as of a Congressional Budget Office report in 1992 as to the proportion of losses due to fraud eventually borne by the government range from three to 25 percent, with a more narrow consensus estimate in the range 10–15 percent (corresponding to taxpayer losses of 16–24 billion dollars).

== Thrift failures ==
Realisation of interest-rate risk in the early 1980s led to a short series of failures that impelled a deregulatory episode from 1980–81. The failure of Empire Savings and Loan in 1984 also drove the FHLBB to reverse course and tighten regulations on thrifts. Such actions were too late, however, since the poor loans had already been made and were already on thrift balance sheets.

The condition of the banking system as a whole was also not entirely solid. The rapidly changing legal environment, along with new financial technologies, also destabilised commercial banks. 1984 saw the largest commercial bank failure to date, that of Continental Illinois, which was infamously branded &quot;too big to fail&quot;. The bank failed amid a rise in foreign non-performing loans (mostly in Latin America) and an electronic bank run. The FDIC stepped in to prevent the failure of almost 2,300 smaller banks which had their money in Continental and a general panic.

Moreover, even by 1983, FSLIC&#x27;s reserves were clearly inadequate for the thrifts that had already by that time failed: with just a bit more than six billion dollars in reserve, outstanding claims by that point already totalled $25 billion.

=== Intensification ===

Losses reported by thrifts through to 1985 were mostly deferred due to the lax accounting rules in place and covered by positive real estate values in the southwestern United States. The first major thrifts to go were in Ohio and Maryland in 1985. That March, Home State Savings Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio collapsed after a depositor run triggered by news that it had lost $540 million in a securities scam. Not insured by the federal government via FSLIC, it was instead insured by a private state insurance program. This program became promptly insolvent and the governor, Richard F. Celeste, ordered the first bank holiday since the Great Depression. In Maryland, that May, Old Court Savings and Loans similarly failed. The panic also spread across Maryland thrifts, which also insured by their state and not the federal government. The governor, Harry R. Hughes, capped deposit withdrawals; by June, the Maryland legislature ordered all state-insured thrifts either to become FSLIC members or liquidate in six months. The thrift failures in Ohio and Maryland cost those states&#x27; taxpayers some 250 million dollars.

A sharp regional recession in the southwestern United States and Texas, caused by a drop in oil prices, caused a fall in the value of commercial real estate in those areas. Thrifts in those states, highly exposed to local commercial real estate prices through their heavy aggressive lending activities, quickly became insolvent. Pressure compounded on banks due to follow-on real estate effects and an 1980s farm crisisagricultural recession in Great Plains states. The elimination of favorable tax treatment for real estate construction in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 also contributed to a slowdown in constructing lending and lowered real estate values.

=== FSLIC recapitalization ===
The failures in 1985–86 were extremely expensive for FSLIC. Resolving those failures cost $7.4 billion in 1985 and $9.1 billion in 1986. This brought the FSLIC reserve fund to less than $2 billion on the eve of 1987. Compounding this, the size of the thrift industry had expanded considerably, meaning that the money in that reserve fund was spread thin. FSLIC&#x27;s immediate response to raise revenue by increasing deposit insurance premia. It also sought to restrict thrift taking of brokered deposits, which it viewed as fuelling thrift growth. However, those regulations were stuck down by a federal court and may regardless have done little to enforce asset quality. Further regulations in 1984–85 attempted to slow the growth of thrift institutions and change the calculation of regulatory capital to better match current conditions; regulatory personnel were also taken on to examine banks for compliance with these regulations. 

Credit losses, however, came too quickly for this re-regulatory push to have much impact. With insufficient resources to handle those losses, FSLIC&#x27;s sought to defer sale of institutions and assets so that they could be handled with the limited resources on hand. The Reagan administration recognized by April 1986 that FSLIC was itself approaching insolvency; it asked Congress for $15 billion to pay for FSLIC costs through bonds sold against future FSLIC premia. Little was done on the matter and the issue of insolvency was played down to avoid alarm and unfavorable press. By January 1987, the problems were of such magnitude that it was the first piece of business in the new session. However, specifics of the funding bill were harshly debated. The thrift industry group, supported by House Speaker Jim Wright, insisted on less than $7.5 billion and compulsory regulatory forbearance. While the administration resented the inclusion of regulatory forbearance, public news of FSLIC&#x27;s impending (or already actual) insolvency in a GAO report led the administration to accept regulatory forbearance for more money. The resulting Competitive Equality Banking Act was signed on August 11, 1987, giving FSLIC $10.8 billion through sale of bonds via an off-balance sheet government entity. It also required thrift supervisors not to close thrifts that had equity ratios of more than 0.5 percent which met rather lax business viability criteria.

The effect of the 1987 act was that risky institutions were unrestrained in their risk-taking behaviors. They then attempted to &quot;gamble for resurrection&quot;, hoping that even riskier lending would allow them to get sufficient profits to stave off bankruptcy. The effect of assistance also engendered moral hazard, where owners could accrue profits from risky loans but place losses at the feet of taxpayers.

At the end of 1988, 2,969 thrifts remained active. This was over three hundred less than in 1985 and over a thousand less than in 1980. These failures were highly geographically concentrated: a third of the failures from 1985 forward occurred in just three states: California, Texas, and Florida; Texas accounted for 40 percent of thrift failures in the worst year of the crisis, 1988. Faced with so man institutions, FHLBB, under its new chairman M. Danny Wall, attempted to sell off hundreds of insolvent thrifts in receivership. These sales could only be accomplished with substantial government support and although it allowed FSLIC to dispose of almost 200 thrifts by the end of 1988, some 250 insolvent institutions with $81 billion in assets remained.

=== FIRREA and the RTC ===

The number of banks that were formally insolvent under FHLBB regulatory guidelines at the end of 1988 was 250, however, the number insolvent after excluding intangible assets more than doubled to 508. These insolvent thrifts continued to lose money rapidly. Moreover, FSLIC at the same time was itself insolvent. The new president, George H. W. Bush, announced a proposal on February 6, 1989, to resolve the thrift failures. The plan included three major elements: a temporary agency would be created with 50 billion dollars in funding to liquidate the insolvent thrift institutions with that money being raised via another off-balance sheet vehicle paid for by higher insurance premia on the thrift industry; the FHLBB and FSLIC would be dissolved, with supervisory powers devolving to the incipient Office of Thrift Supervision within the Treasury Department and the FDIC; regulations would be tightened as well, with regulatory capital no longer including intangibles such as goodwill and doubled to six percent within two years. On August 9, 1989, the proposals brought by Bush were passed essentially unchanged as the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 into law. Many other regulatory provisions were also included, such as risk-based capital applied to thrifts, re-imposition of restrictions on thrifts&#x27; non-residential mortgage portfolios, and funding for financial crimes prosecutions.

The Resolution Trust Corporation, created by the act, sold or liquidated all remaining thrifts. Those institutions remained for the time being in operation under conservatorship. The RTC was also given generous amounts of time to sell assets in small tranches: buyers were more willing to purchase smaller portions and the RTC was also able to assess and market its assets. The closure of FSLIC and the creation of RTC only to sell or liquidate insolvent institutions also forced thrift owners to take fewer risks since they knew that assistance would no longer be forthcoming. In 1989 the RTC disposed of 37 thrifts at a cost of $51 billion, which came under fire from congressional leadership. The next year, 1990, saw the sale of 315 institutions at a cost of $20 billion. Congress, although criticizing the RTC for its ballooning staff, appropriated an additional $30 billion in March 1991. Late in that year, many of the assets bundled into mortgage-backed and commercial-paper backed securities. Amid a funding deficiency, the RTC was forced to shut down operations in 1991, but after new appropriations in 1993, the RTC was wound down by year-end 1996. Overall, it recovered 78 percent of the book value of all assets and disposed of 747 thrift institutions with $402.6 billion in assets.

== Scandals ==

A number of high-profile thrift failures and scandals also emerged from the crisis. Notable institutions included:
* Lamar Savings and Loan (Austin, TX), led by Stanley Adams, which cost $2 billion to resolve;
* Vernon Savings and Loan (Dallas, TX), led by Don Dixon, which on resolution had 94 percent of loans non-performing; and
* Columbia Savings and Loan (Beverly Hills, CA), led by Thomas Spiegel, was closed in January 1991 at the cost of $3.25 billion.

Especially publicized was the insolvency of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, led by influential Republican donor and political figure Charles Keating. Between 1984 and 1989 it grew five-fold, investing mainly in commercial property and equities. After supervisors recommended the thrift be seized for criminal fraud in 1987, Keating leaned on senators Dennis DeConcini (D-AZ), John McCain (R-AZ), Alan Cranston (D-CA), John Glenn (D-OH), and Donald Riegle (D-MI) to curtail the investigation. When it became known that the five men, later dubbed the Keating Five, had received $1.3 million in campaign contributions, they became embroiled in a congressional ethics investigation. Eventually, the matter was dropped by the new FHLBB chairman, Danny Wall, who later resigned in December 1989 for failure to take action against Lincoln, which failed that year at a cost of $2.6 billion. Keating was eventually prosecuted and convicted, but the convictions were overturned due to incorrect jury instructions and, later, a poisoned jury. Eventually, in 1999, he pled guilty and was sentenced to time served.

Other figures were similarly drawn in to allegations of fraud and corruption. Neil Bush, the son of then-vice president George H. W. Bush, was hauled before Congress and sued by the FDIC for his involvement in Silverado Savings and Loan (Denver, CO), which failed in December 1989.

== Consequences ==

Thrifts were not the only financial institutions adversely affected in the 1980s. Many banks failed as well. Between 1980 and 1994, 1,617 commercial banks failed (9.14 percent of all banks) with total assets of $206 billion. However, the overlapping regional banking crises in the 1980s were far less severe on the commercial banking side because the FDIC remained solvent. Moreover, the federal commercial bank regulators were more proactive in their approaches to limit growth and enforce capital requirements; the FDIC&#x27;s financial solvency meant, unlike FSLIC, a policy of regulatory forbearance was not forced on it by circumstance.

In just the years 1986 to 1995, the number of federally insured thrifts about halved from 3,234 to 1,645. 1,043 thrifts failed with total assets of over $519 billion. Congress ultimately appropriated $105 billion to the Resolution Trust Corporation, though only $91.3 billion were ever used. After banks repaid loans through various procedures, by the end of 1999, taxpayers suffered combined FSLIC and RTC expenses of $123.8 billion with an additional $29.1 billion (approximately 19 percent) of losses imposed onto the thrift industry. Approximately $60 billion of those losses were attributable to regulatory forbearance as required by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987.

The higher insurance premia along with regulatory burdens, without concomitant legal powers, that were enacted by FIRREA led to progressive exits from the thrift industry over the 1990s as thrifts re-chartered themselves as commercial banks. Changes in thrift powers also meant that they lost their distinctiveness vis-à-vis commercial banks: between 1980 and 1995 the share of 1–4 family mortgages originated by thrift institutions fell from 47 percent to 15. In the aftermath of the crisis, even the words &quot;savings and loan&quot; became less common as thrift institutions renamed themselves merely as &quot;bank&quot; or &quot;savings bank&quot;.

Bank regulators&#x27; powers were also strengthened. The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 expanded federal banking agencies&#x27; examination authority, requiring annual inspections and sufficient examination staff for those inspections. Moreover, the agencies received prompt corrective action powers to compel banks to recapitalize when falling below certain capital thresholds. Such orders were also backed up by further powers to suspend banks&#x27; legal authority to do certain types of business, to ban fragile banks from paying out dividends, or to replace bank directors. Furthermore, restrictions were also imposed on how long banks could stay open while below minimum regulatory capital requirements, putting a &quot;hard stop&quot; of 90 days after which a bank must be placed into receivership. Public awareness of the problems of a lack of geographic diversification enforced by law also may have played a role in the passage of the Riegle–Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which lifted historical restrictions on banks operating across state lines.

<doc id="896634" wikidata="Q6089636" url="?curid=896634" title="It! The Terror from Beyond Space">
<text>It! The Terror from Beyond Space is an independently made 1958 American science fiction horror film, produced by Robert Kent, directed by Edward L. Cahn, that stars Marshall Thompson, Shawn Smith (Shirley Patterson), and Kim Spalding. The film was distributed by United Artists as a double feature with &quot;Curse of the Faceless Man&quot;.

The story involves Earth&#x27;s second mission to Mars to discover the fate of the Challenge 141 and its crew. Only a single survivor is found still alive from that crashed spaceship. The survivor, the expedition&#x27;s former commander, claims that his crew were killed by a hostile Martian life form. No one from the rescue ship believes him until the creature, now a stowaway, begins hunting the crew on their return trip to Earth.

The film&#x27;s premise has been cited as an inspiration for screenwriter Dan O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s screenplay for Ridley Scott&#x27;s classic 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1973, a nuclear-powered spaceship blasts off from Mars for Earth, bringing with it the sole survivor of the first mission, Col. Edward Carruthers. He is suspected of having murdered the other nine members of his crew for their food and water rations, on the premise that he had no way of knowing if or when an Earth rescue mission would ever arrive. Carruthers denies this allegation, attributing his crew&#x27;s deaths to a hostile humanoid life form on the Red Planet.

Commander Col. Van Heusen is unconvinced and makes sure that Carruthers is constantly accompanied by another member of his crew. While the ship was on the Martian surface, an emergency hatch had been left open, allowing the creature easy access. The crew are at first skeptical that something crawled aboard while they were on Mars. However, when Kienholz investigates odd sounds coming from a lower level, he is killed and his body hidden in an air duct. Next is Gino Finelli. He is found, barely alive, but the creature attacks his would-be rescuer. Bullets have no effect, forcing the crewman to leave Gino behind, much to the distress of his brother Bob. An autopsy of Kienholz&#x27;s body reveals that it has been sucked dry of all fluids.

The crew use hand grenades and gas grenades, but the creature proves to be immune to both. They next try electrocution, also with no effect. When &quot;It&quot; is tricked into going into the spaceship&#x27;s atomic reactor room, they shut the heavily shielded door and expose the creature directly to the ship&#x27;s nuclear pile. It easily crashes through the door and escapes. The creature is so strong that it can tear through the metal hatches separating each of the ship&#x27;s levels. The survivors (except for an injured crewman, who is trapped below in a spot inaccessible to the creature) retreat to the control room on the topmost deck. When Carruthers notices the ship&#x27;s higher-than-normal oxygen consumption rate, he surmises that this is due to the creature&#x27;s larger lung capacity, needed for the thin Martian atmosphere. In a last desperate move, everyone puts on their spacesuits, and Carruthers opens the command deck&#x27;s hull airlock directly to the vacuum of space. A violent decompression follows, and the plan works: &quot;It&quot; suffocates and finally expires, stuck part way through the final hatch.

A press conference is later held on Earth, revealing the details of what happened aboard the rescue ship. The project director emphasizes that Earth may now be forced to bypass the Red Planet &quot;because another word for Mars is Death&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;It! The Terror from Beyond Space&quot; was financed by Edward Small and was originally known as It! The Vampire from Beyond Space. Principal photography took place over a two-week period during mid-January 1958. Small kept changing his mind over whether or not he wanted plastic eyes installed in the creature&#x27;s mask, causing a lot of aggravation for the film&#x27;s makeup artist, Paul Blaisdell.

&quot;It!&quot; was the last film of actor Ray &quot;Crash&quot; Corrigan. Corrigan was set to play the creature, but during pre-production, he did not want to travel over to Topanga Canyon in western Los Angeles County where Paul Blaisdell lived and operated his studio. Therefore, Blaisdell could not take exact measurements of Corrigan&#x27;s head. Consequently, there were final fit problems with the creature&#x27;s head prop: &quot;[Corrigan&#x27;s]...bulbous chin stuck out through the monster&#x27;s mouth, so the make-up man painted his chin to look like a tongue&quot;. Blaisdell then added a bottom row of fangs that covered Corrigan&#x27;s jutting chin.

Blaisdell said working for United Artists wasn&#x27;t nearly as happy an experience as working at AIP was for him. As filming progressed, Ray Corrigan turned up drunk on the set a few times, refused to follow certain directions from Ed Cahn and even damaged the monster suit, causing Blaisdell to be called in to do a couple of quick &quot;patch-up&quot; jobs. Blaisdell said it wasn&#x27;t a happy set, what with Corrigan drunk on and off, and the film&#x27;s female star Shawn Smith constantly in a bad mood, furious that she had been cast in a low-budget monster film. Blaisdell said only Marshall Thompson seemed to be enjoying himself. The creature costume became the property of UA, and wound up a year later showing up in their 1959 John Agar opus, &quot;Invisible Invaders&quot; (without paying Blaisdell for reusing his props).

==Reception==

At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 69% based on , with a weighted average rating of 5.9/10.

&quot;Variety&quot; noted that the creature was the star: &quot;&#x27;It&#x27; is a Martian by birth, a Frankenstein by instinct, and a copycat. The monster dies hard, brushing aside grenades, bullets, gas and an atomic pile, before snorting its last snort. It&#x27;s old stuff, with only a slight twist&quot;. A retrospective film review by Dennis Schwartz favorably compared &quot;It!&quot; with &quot;Alien&quot;, a classic 1979 film that borrowed its creature feature plot liberally from its earlier counterpart.

==Adaptations==
In 1992, Millennium Publications adapted &quot;It! The Terror from Beyond Space&quot; as a short-run comic book series, written by Mark Ellis and Dean Zachary. A further comics adaptation was released by &quot;Midnite Movies&quot; (IDW Publishing) in 2010, for a three-issue run.

<text>Krups is a German kitchen appliance manufacturer. It is part of the Groupe SEB. It is named after its founder, Robert Krups.

The company produces a large variety of household appliances such as coffee makers, toasters, blenders, kettles, waffle makers, egg cookers, hand mixers, food processors, etc.

==History==


The company began in 1846 manufacturing precision scales and mainly industrial balances, in Wald, now a district of Solingen in North Rhine-Westphalia. This was the company&#x27;s principal product for the next 110 years.

In 1951, following the 1950s postwar reconstruction and economic boom in Germany, Krups moved into the lucrative consumer appliance arena. The highly popular &quot;3Mix&quot; (German, &quot;Drei-Mix&quot;) mixing machine was released in 1959 and soon became a fixture in nearly every second West German household, followed in 1961 by the ONKO coffee machine, available as the &quot;F468&quot; until 2014. In 1965, the company launched its first slicer, a highly popular product in Germany where sausage (&quot;wurst&quot;) and cheese are consumed as staples.

In 1979 the Krups Type 223 &quot;Coffina Super&quot; coffee grinder was used as a prop in the film &quot;Alien&quot; as part of the Nostromo spacecraft, and also in &quot;Back to the Future&quot; as &#x27;Mr. Fusion&#x27;. In 1983 the first Krups coffee machines were released.

By 1990, the firm employed 3,000 people in four German factories, as well as one in Limerick, Ireland, with annual revenue of DM541 million. Coffee machines were the most popular product, constituting 40 percent of sales in Germany and 30 percent in the United States. The following year Krups undertook a joint venture with Nestlé to produce the &quot;Nespresso&quot; machine.

In 1999 the Krups Irish factory in Limerick, formerly employing 800 people, closed. Two years later, following bankruptcy, Krups joined Groupe SEB, which subsequently reoriented Krups as a premium brand and employed designer Konstantin Grcic.

<doc id="896652" wikidata="Q212582" url="?curid=896652" title="The Valley of Gwangi">
<text>The Valley of Gwangi is a 1969 American fantasy Western film produced by Charles H. Schneer and Ray Harryhausen, directed by Jim O&#x27;Connolly, written by William Bast, and starring James Franciscus, Richard Carlson, and Gila Golan.

Creature stop-motion effects were by Harryhausen, the last dinosaur-themed film that he animated. He had inherited the film project from his mentor Willis O&#x27;Brien, responsible for the effects in the original &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). O&#x27;Brien had planned to make &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; decades earlier but died in 1962 before it could be realized. Producer Charles Scheer called it &quot;probably the least of the movies Ray and I made together.&quot;

==Plot==

In 20th century Mexico, T.J. Breckenridge hosts a rodeo. Her former lover, Tuck Kirby, a former stuntman working for Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show, wants to buy her out. Along the way, he is followed by Lope, a Mexican boy who intends to join the rodeo on a quest for fame and fortune. T.J. is not interested in Tuck, who is still attracted to her. T.J. accepts Tuck when he saves Lope from a bull.

T.J. has an ace she hopes will boost attendance at her show – a horse called El Diablo. Tuck meets British paleontologist Horace Bromley, who is working in a nearby Mexican desert. Bromley shows Tuck fossilized horse tracks, and Tuck notes their similarity to El Diablo&#x27;s feet. Tuck sneaks Bromley into the circus for a look at El Diablo, which Bromley declares to be an &quot;Eohippus&quot;.

The horse came from a place known as the Forbidden Valley. Romani Tia Zorina claims that the horse is cursed, and demands that it be returned. Later, she and the other Romani collaborate with Bromley to steal El Diablo and release it back in the valley. Bromley hopes to follow the horse to its home in search of other prehistoric specimens. Carlos, an ex-member of the Romani tribe now working for T.J.&#x27;s circus, walks in on the theft and tries to stop it, but is knocked out.

Tuck arrives just as the Romani posse leaves. Carlos sees him as he is regaining consciousness. Tuck notices that the horse is missing, and sets off after Bromley. T.J. and her crew discover Carlos, who claims that Tuck stole El Diablo for himself. Carlos, T.J., and the others decide to follow Tuck and Bromley into the valley.

In the Forbidden Valley, Tuck, T.J., and the rest of the group meet up and discover why the valley is said to be cursed when a &quot;Pteranodon&quot; swoops down and snatches Lope. However, due to the extra weight, it falls back to the ground. After Carlos kills the &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, they spot an &quot;Ornithomimus&quot;, which they chase after to capture it. It is eventually killed by Gwangi, a Tyrannosaurus, which chases Bromley and the rest of the group. However, a &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; appears and drives Gwangi away; while the group learn of Carlos&#x27;s lie from Lope.

Gwangi pursues the group to their base camp. They try to rope him down, but he breaks free when the &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; reappears. Gwangi kills the &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; and later kills Carlos, but is knocked out by a rockslide while trying to exit the valley in pursuit of the rest of the group.

Securing the creature with ropes, Tuck and the other men in the group take Gwangi back to town to be put on display in T.J.&#x27;s show. On the opening day, a dwarfed Romani who works for Tia Zorina sneaks in and begins to unlock Gwangi&#x27;s cage to free him, only to be killed when Gwangi breaks free. The crowd flees as Gwangi attacks, and Tia Zorina is trampled to death in the chaos. Bromley is crushed by a broken piece of the cage, and Gwangi kills an Asian elephant before rampaging through the town. Tuck, accompanied by T.J. and Lope, tries to hide the crowd in a cathedral, but Gwangi breaks in. Tuck urges the crowd out through a back exit, leaving himself inside with Gwangi, T.J. and Lope.

Gwangi tries to eat them, but is distracted when the cathedral&#x27;s organ is accidentally sounded off. Tuck then wounds him with a flag and throws a torch onto the floor near Gwangi, setting the building on fire. Tuck and the others escape, leaving Gwangi trapped in the collapsing building. Shrieking as he is burned alive, Gwangi is crushed to death by the debris, as Tuck, T.J., Lope, and the townspeople look on.

===Development===
The story of &quot;Gwangi&quot; was originally conceived by Willis O&#x27;Brien (1886–1962), the man who created the special effects for the original &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). The plot was inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s book &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1912), with added elements from &quot;King Kong&quot; (capturing a creature and bringing it to civilization where it runs amok). News of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s project first appeared in June 1941.

In O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s scenario, then called &quot;Valley of the Mists&quot;, cowboys discover an Allosaurus in the Grand Canyon. After finally roping the dinosaur, they put it in a Wild West show but the creature, now called &quot;Gwangi&quot;, breaks free and fights lions from the show that have also escaped. After killing the lions, Gwangi goes on a rampage around the town and is run off a cliff by a man in a truck.

O&#x27;Brien worked on the project at RKO Pictures during most of 1942. The studio cancelled the production, reportedly because of research done that the public did not want to see a picture about dinosaurs.

According to Harryhausen the project &quot;didn&#x27;t get to the shooting stage. They built a series of dioramas in three-dimensional cardboard cutouts for each set-up. I saw those and I saw a lot of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s drawings at the time, but that&#x27;s as far as it got.&quot;

O&#x27;Brien went on to make &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; for RKO instead.

In 1949, Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper reported that Jesse Lasky was going to Central America to film scenes for &quot;Valley of the Mists&quot; with O&#x27;Brien, with a script by Richard Landau. However, no film resulted.

Seven years after O&#x27;Brien died in 1962, &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; was released in 1969. A similar film &quot;The Beast of Hollow Mountain&quot; (1956 United Artists / produced by a Mexican film company and also employing stop-motion effects, but not by Harryhausen), was the only other feature film in the history of cinema to have the unusual story combination of cowboys and dinosaurs.

====Ray Harryhausen====
In the late 1960s, Ray Harryhausen and producer Charles Schneer decided to reunite after several years of making films apart. Harryhausen suggested reviving two old O&#x27;Brien projects, &quot;War Eagles&quot;, which had been developed for MGM, and &quot;Gwangi&quot; which had been done for RKO. Schneer did not see how they could get a script out of &quot;War Eagles&quot; but was enthusiastic about the &quot;Gwangi&quot; script and bought the rights from O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s widow. Although O&#x27;Brien was the creator of the original &quot;Gwangi&quot; story, an on-screen credit for him was not included in &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; .

Schneer had the script rewritten by William Bast and offered the project to Columbia, who had made all Scheer&#x27;s previous collaborations with Harryhausen. The studio turned it down but Warner Bros agreed to finance. James O&#x27;Connelly signed to direct.

Harryhausen said they decided to keep the story&#x27;s early 20th Century time period to eliminate the &quot;cliches about the army moving in with tanks and missiles.&quot;

Gwangi was described in O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s original script as an &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, although O&#x27;Brien apparently did not draw much distinction between &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, as he also referred to the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; in the original King Kong (modeled by Marcel Delgado) as an &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. According to Ray Harryhausen, his own version of Gwangi (and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Gwangi too, as well as Delgado&#x27;s &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;) was based on a Charles R. Knight painting of a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; – one of the two most famous paintings by Knight, and one that is instantly recognizable by the eye being placed too far forward on the skull (this was based on concurrently incomplete skeletal remains and the eye was mistakenly placed in one of the antorbital fenestrae), as well as ultimately and incorrectly portraying Tyrannosaurus with a three-fingered hand. This famous Tyrannosaurus image is also reflected in Harryhausen&#x27;s &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot; in &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot;. In an interview featured on the &quot;Valley of Gwangi&quot; DVD, Harryhausen said &quot;We sometimes called it an &quot;Allosaurus&quot;... They&#x27;re both meat eaters, they&#x27;re both Tyrants... one was just a bit larger than the other.&quot; Gwangi was scaled to be 14 feet tall, within the size range of an average adult &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; (although not the largest), and at the upper limit of the largest &quot;Allosaurus&quot; specimens.

===Special effects===
&quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; was the last dinosaur-themed film that Harryhausen animated, and he made much use of his experience in depicting extinct animals from his earlier films. Close to a year was spent on the special effects (there were more than 300 &#x27;Dynamation&#x27; cuts in the film, a record number for Harryhausen), with the roping of Gwangi being the most labor-intensive animated sequence. It was achieved by having the actors hold on to ropes tied to a &quot;monster stick&quot; that was in the back of a jeep. The jeep and stick when filmed with Gwangi are on a back rear projection plate and hidden by his body, and the portions of rope attached to his body are painted wires that are matched with the real ropes. The coordination of Gwangi&#x27;s animation with live actors on horseback (and the horses appearing to react to Gwangi) was particularly difficult to film, and the source of an editorial lapse in a following scene. Gwangi bites through the ropes around his neck when first lassoed and later has his jaws roped together when unconscious. However, he is then shown being transported in a cart again held only by ropes around his neck but with jaws now un-bound.

The first animated sequence in the film is a diving act done by T.J. and her horse. Because it was decided that it was too risky to have a rider and horse jump off a 40-foot (12-meter) high platform into a tank of water, a model horse and rider were used. After tempting Gila Golan&#x27;s horse to jump from a mock-up platform onto a trampoline, the film cut to an animated model suspended on wires (actually, it was just a tiny toy horse and rider bought in a toy store). The splash was real, triggered by an electric charge inside the tank.

After local Gypsies steal the &quot;Eohippus&quot;, it is released back into the Forbidden Valley. For all the scenes where the cowboys are chasing the creature, the animated model was used. However, in one long shot, a baby goat was used instead because the model would have been too small.

The pterosaurs were mistakenly given bat&#x27;s wings (with elongate fingers supporting the membrane; pterosaurs had one finger forming the wing&#x27;s leading edge but none on the membrane). The wings appear to mimic those of a pterosaur from an earlier Harryhausen film, &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; (1966). Close-up sequences of the pterosaurs in Gwangi were provided by life-size models. For the scene when Lope is snatched from his horse by the &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, the boy was raised by wires painted out in the studio and Harryhausen animated the eight-inch-(20-centimeter) high model pterosaur to correspond with his movements. However, once the creature gets up to a certain altitude the real boy was replaced with a model which was used until he crawls away from the creature which is being killed by Carlos on the ground. Bromley the paleontologist correctly identifies it as a pterodactyl (the classification of pterosaurs that &quot;Pteranodon&quot; is a part of) while he is inspecting it on the ground.

The scene where Gwangi pounces on the &quot;Ornithomimus&quot; has been copied many times in dinosaur films, primarily in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, when the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; pounces on the &quot;Gallimimus&quot;. The smaller dinosaur had never appeared on the film screen before and although its movements were unlikely it was one of Harryhausen&#x27;s favorite sequences in the film. The battle between Gwangi and the &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; features battle moves, such as biting, stabbing, butting and pinning. After Gwangi is captured, he is wheeled back to town in a cart; and for several of the long shots of this scene the crew built and used a full-sized mock-up of Gwangi, again because an actual model would have been far too small.

Harryhausen originally planned to have used a real elephant in some of the scenes for the fight with Gwangi. This did not work out because he wanted to have used a 15-foot (5-meter) tall elephant (the world&#x27;s biggest elephant was two feet shorter than this). So, the live 8-foot (2-meter) elephant was only used in the beginning when a woman is seen briefly riding on its back. For some of the elephant fight scenes, Harryhausen used the animation table as the bullring floor.

For Gwangi&#x27;s death scene, a number of special effects were used. When the torch hits the ground near Gwangi, the flames are seen quickly developing and surrounding Gwangi. The flames were added in by double printing the camera. The outside of the burning church was a mixture of composites: the lower half was the real church photographed on location in Spain, and the upper, burning half was a miniature, again added in by double printing the camera.

The model of the &quot;Eohippus&quot; was supposed to have toes but appears to have regular hooves with &#x27;toes&#x27; painted on (the sound effects of the animal moving also resemble hooves). The model of the &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; featured an inflatable air &#x27;bladder&#x27; to simulate the animal breathing heavily after its combat with Gwangi (a feature first used in models made for much earlier films by Marcel Delgado).

Some of the models used in the film were reused model armatures from earlier films. Gwangi, the &quot;Ornithomimus&quot; and the &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; were all made from the &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, the &quot;Phorusrhacos&quot; and the &quot;Triceratops&quot;, who were stripped down and had their armatures modified for further use. The actual model of Gwangi was about 14 inches (36 cm) high and the &quot;Ornithomimus&quot; was about 5 inches (13 cm) high. A solid-latex, non-armatured model of Gwangi was also used for the scenes when he knocks himself out while trying to exit the valley in pursuit of the cowboys (but, Harryhausen was never pleased with this, as the solid model did not look right).

===Casting===
Actress Gila Golan was cast at the insistence of Warner Bros. Her Israeli accent was so strong that all of her lines were redubbed on the film by a voice actress.

Actor Laurence Naismith, who plays Professor Bromley, had earlier appeared in Harryhausen&#x27;s &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; as the shipbuilder Argos.

====Location shooting====

The film was filmed in Almería and Cuenca, Spain. The bullring scenes were shot in Almería&#x27;s Plaza de Toros and the finale at Cuenca&#x27;s cathedral. Some scenes with dinosaurs like the &quot;Pteranodon&quot; scene or the fight between the &quot;Epanterias&quot; and &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; were filmed in Almería, in Tabernas Desert. The unusual rock formations of Ciudad Encantada near Cuenca were used for the forbidden valley.

Scheer says the director &quot;lost interest in the middle of shooting. I don&#x27;t think he enjoyed it. He just didn&#x27;t have his heart in it, when he was halfway through.&quot;

According to Bast, &quot;the director was monumentally stupid. Charlie opted for someone who matched his own insensitivity. O’Connolly started tampering with the script as they were leaving. I thought, &#x27;This is going to be a mess&#x27;.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
According to Harryhausen, &quot;we got trapped in a change of management shuffle at Warner Bros. If only they had publicized it properly! They just dumped the picture on the market. A lot of people who would have loved it never got a chance to see it, never knew it was playing.&quot;

&quot;&quot;The new administration didn&#x27;t give it the kind of release I expected,&quot; said Schneer. &quot;They didn&#x27;t know how to market our type of picture as well as Columbia did. It was their money and their property, and they did what they wanted. I had no rapport with that new management. There was nothing I could do to change their minds.&quot;

===Critical reception===
Schneer later said he &quot;wasn&#x27;t very keen about&quot; the film. &quot;Because of the subject matter and the period in which it was set, it just didn&#x27;t have the same appeal to me that our other pictures had. The central image of the cowboys roping the dinosaur was imaginative, but it didn&#x27;t hold up for feature length.&quot;

The film currently sits at an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on an aggregate of ten reviews.

==Comic book adaptation==
* Dell Movie Classic: &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; (December 1969)

==Legacy==
By the time of the film&#x27;s release, interest in monster movies of this type was waning. Management at Warner Bros. and Warner Bros.-Seven Arts also changed, and the film was released with little promotional effort on a double-bill with a biker film; it thus missed its target audience and was not as successful as earlier Harryhausen efforts. It has since become a cult classic.

Among the critics, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;generally run-of-the-mill monster rally.&quot;

The scene where Gwangi suddenly appears from behind a hill and snatches the fleeing &quot;Ornithomimus&quot; in his jaws was later copied in Steven Spielberg’s big-budget dinosaur film, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

During the 1980s hit TV series &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot;, anytime a television was shown on in the series, &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; was on the screen.

In episode 2–28 (2000) of the American version of the TV series &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, the scene of Tuck fighting the pterodactyl was used for the green screen video during the Newsflash segment.

Artist Mark Cline&#x27;s 2005 attraction Dinosaur Kingdom was inspired by &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot;.

Justin Parpan&#x27;s 2007 children&#x27;s read-aloud book, &quot;Gwango&#x27;s Lonesome Trail&quot; (Red Cygnet Press, Inc., ) features a prehistoric dinosaur named &quot;Gwango&quot; roaming the contemporary American Southwest.

In the episode &quot;The One Where Joey Speaks French&quot; (2004) of the situation comedy &quot;Friends&quot; (1994), Ross Geller watches the film while in a hospital.

In the 2011 animated film, &quot;Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur&quot;, during a night time chase scene through the town a movie theatre can be seen in the background playing two dinosaur-themed monster movies, &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; (1953) [another Ray Harryhausen film from Warner Bros].

In July 2018, &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; was shown at the Pickwick Theater in Park Ridge, Illinois as part of the G-Fest convention events going on in Rosemont, Illinois. Playing on a double-bill with another 1960&#x27;s dinosaur fantasy film using stop-motion animation (albeit not by Harryhausen), &quot;Dinosaurus!&quot;.

<doc id="896657" wikidata="Q5127844" url="?curid=896657" title="Class-based programming">
<text>Class-based programming, or more commonly class-orientation, is a style of object-oriented programming (OOP) in which inheritance occurs via defining &quot;classes&quot; of objects, instead of inheritance occurring via the objects alone (compare prototype-based programming).

The most popular and developed model of OOP is a class-based model, instead of an object-based model. In this model, objects are entities that combine &quot;state&quot; (i.e., data), &quot;behavior&quot; (i.e., procedures, or &quot;methods&quot;) and &quot;identity&quot; (unique existence among all other objects). The structure and behavior of an object are defined by a class, which is a definition, or blueprint, of all objects of a specific type. An object must be explicitly created based on a class and an object thus created is considered to be an instance of that class. An object is similar to a structure, with the addition of method pointers, member access control, and an implicit data member which locates instances of the class (i.e., objects of the class) in the class hierarchy (essential for runtime inheritance features).

==Encapsulation==
Encapsulation prevents users from breaking the invariants of the class, which is useful because it allows the implementation of a class of objects to be changed for aspects not exposed in the interface without impact to user code. The definitions of encapsulation focus on the grouping and packaging of related information (cohesion) rather than security issues.

==Inheritance==
In class-based programming, inheritance is done by defining new classes as extensions of existing classes: the existing class is the parent class and the new class is the child class. If a child class has only one parent class, this is known as &quot;single inheritance,&quot; while if a child class can have more than one parent class, this is known as &quot;multiple inheritance.&quot; This organizes classes into a hierarchy, either a &quot;tree&quot; (if single inheritance) or &quot;lattice&quot; (if multiple inheritance).

The defining feature of inheritance is that both interface and implementation are inherited; if only interface is inherited, this is known as interface inheritance or &quot;subtyping.&quot; Inheritance can also be done without classes, as in prototype-based programming.

==Critique==
Class-based languages, or, to be more precise, typed languages, where subclassing is the only way of subtyping, have been criticized for mixing up implementations and interfaces—the essential principle in object-oriented programming. The critics say one might create a bag class that stores a collection of objects, then extend it to make a new class called a set class where the duplication of objects is eliminated. Now, a function that takes an object of the bag class may expect that adding two objects increases the size of a bag by two, yet if one passes an object of a set class, then adding two objects may or may not increase the size of a bag by two. The problem arises precisely because subclassing implies subtyping even in the instances where the principle of subtyping, known as the Liskov substitution principle, does not hold. Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing formulated the principle succinctly in a 1994 paper as follows:
&quot;Subtype Requirement&quot;: Let be a property provable about objects of type . Then should be true for objects of type where is a subtype of . 

Thus, normally one must distinguish subtyping and subclassing. Most current object-oriented languages distinguish subtyping and subclassing, however some approaches to design do not.

Also, another common example is that a person object created from a child class cannot become an object of parent class because a child class and a parent class inherit a person class but class-based languages mostly do not allow to change the kind of class of the object at runtime. For class-based languages, this restriction is essential in order to preserve unified view of the class to its users. The users should not need to care whether one of the implementations of a method happens to cause changes that break the invariants of the class. Such changes can be made by destroying the object and constructing another in its place. Polymorphism can be used to preserve the relevant interfaces even when such changes are done, because the objects are viewed as black box abstractions and accessed via object identity. However, usually the value of object references referring to the object is changed, which causes effects to client code.

==Example languages==

Although Simula introduced the class abstraction, the canonical example of a class-based language is Smalltalk. Others include PHP, C++, Java, C#, and Objective-C.

<doc id="896658" wikidata="Q5372884" url="?curid=896658" title="Emma Lee French">
<text>Emma Louise Batchelor Lee French (April 21, 1836 – November 16, 1897), better known as Emma Lee French, was an English nurse born in Uckfield, East Sussex. She travelled to Utah and Arizona in the United States, where she became well known as a carer for the sick.

==Journey to Salt Lake City==
After being converted to Mormonism, Emma Lee arrived in Chicago from England. She then headed to Iowa, where she pushed a cart filled with goods given by her church. She then left for Salt Lake City, Utah. She pushed the cart herself for the 1,400 mile walk, as one of the many Mormon handcart pioneers.

She joined a company of her church&#x27;s members for that trip, of which 150 died during snowstorms. Many others suffered from other illness, such as frozen feet, noses and other diseases. Emma Lee helped care for them, eventually leading to most of them fully recovering. During the trip, she also served as midwife to a pregnant woman, carrying her in the cart as the woman was close to delivering. 

==Life with John D. Lee==
Upon arriving in Salt Lake City, she worked for one year as an indentured servant to pay for her trip from England. Afterwards, she met John D. Lee, a prominent man among Latter-day Saints members. Brigham Young married the couple on January 7, 1858. Emma was John’s 17th wife. 

John D. Lee was eventually convicted for his participation in the Mountain Meadows massacre that left 140 people dead. Before this, John and Emma Lee were followed by federal marshals for about twenty years. At one time John Lee was tried but was freed after a hung jury. In 1868, George Hicks, a columnist from Harmony, Utah, wrote in a local newspaper that the Lees had to leave town in ten days or John would be hanged.

Emma then spoke personally with George Hicks, warning him not to keep making threats against her and her husband. Hicks relented, never speaking against the Lees on his column again. He did, however, complain about the Lees to the town&#x27;s Bishop, who proposed that Hicks and Lee should be baptized together. Emma Lee agreed, but not without complaining; she told the bishop she&#x27;d do it &quot;seeing that (the bishop) are so inconsiderate as to require a woman to be immersed when the water is full of snow and that too for defending the rights of her husband&quot;. She continued on, saying: &quot;Perhaps if (the bishop&#x27;s) backside gets wet in ice water (he) will be more careful how (he) decide again&quot;. Impressed by her speech, the bishop then agreed not to go on with the baptism.

Lee was ordered to carry out important tasks for the Mormons, and in 1871, he was sent to the Colorado River, near the border between Arizona and Utah, to establish a ferry service in a location now known as Lee&#x27;s Ferry. 

Because, under Mormon doctrine, John Doyle Lee was allowed to have multiple wives, he had to travel much of the time, to attend to his other wives and children. Lee often left to visit his &quot;gold mines&quot;. As a consequence, Emma Lee was left to attend both the ferry and her children. When Emma Lee left Lonely Dell after Lee&#x27;s death, she had several coffee cans of gold. At one time there was a gold map showing the location of the mine which is now under Lake Powell.

In 1873, a settlement of Navajo people came up near the Lee home. Fearful for her children&#x27;s fate, she decided to befriend the Navajos, and discovered that the tribe&#x27;s chief was a friend of her husband&#x27;s. They spent one night at the Navajo camp, after which the Navajo left. At one time, a Navajo Chief came into Emma&#x27;s lodge to attack her, but Emma had a steaming pot of water on the stove. She threw the hot water into his face. Later, the chief came back and apologized and asked medical attention for the burns. Afterwards, he told his tribe that Emma was a very powerful woman and had a great spirit and to leave her alone. Another time, a group of warriors camped nearby. Emma heard them talking about killing her and the children. In response, she took the children and camped with the Navajos.

Later that year, Emma Lee gave birth to her sixth baby. With John Doyle gone, she had to ask the oldest person besides her at the Lee house, her son John Jr., to help her cut the umbilical cord. They did this task to perfection, and a daughter was safely born.

John Doyle Lee was caught by the US Army, tried again for the Meadow Mountain Massacre, found guilty, and shot by a firing squad on March 23, 1877, and buried at the site of the massacre. With small children and economically in need, Emma Lee sold the ferry to the LDS Church for 100 milk cows in 1879. She was helped by a Civil War veteran, Franklin French. French was a wandering gold prospector.

==Life with Franklin French==
On August 9, 1879, Emma Lee and French married, in Snowflake, Arizona. They found a home near Holbrook, Arizona. Afterwards, they moved to the White Mountains. The White Mountain Apaches rose up in 1882 and killed 150 settlers that night. Emma was warned just before the attack on her ranch and was able to escape with her children and some ranch hands. She heard the shooting of the livestock and saw the smoke from the burning buildings. Later, French sued the government for $10,000 for the loss of the ranch, but the land was resurveyed and was found to be on Apache land.

In 1887 she and Franklin moved to Winslow, Arizona, and established a dairy ranch. At that time, the Santa Fe railroad was being built. Many times, the railroad would send a special train to bring Emma to help take care of the railroad workers injuries. She was known as &quot;Dr. French&quot;, although she had no official medical title. She helped multiple women, including Navajos and prostitutes, give birth. 

In 1888, her daughter, Victoria Lee, committed suicide. In 1892, her son Ike confronted a man who was trying to seduce his wife and was murdered by the man.

==Death==
On November 17, she was fixing breakfast when she said &quot;I don&#x27;t feel too well&quot; and suffered a heart attack. A crowd of businessmen, Navajos and prostitutes kept vigil outside her home as she lay in bed dying that night.

Her funeral was one of the largest held in Winslow. The Santa Fe railway stopped their trains as a tribute to her.

Her tombstone is in the old cemetery in Winslow, Arizona, marked as &quot;Dr. French&quot;.

<text>20 Million Miles to Earth (also known as The Beast from Space) is a 1957 American science-fiction monster film directed by Nathan Juran and featuring stop-motion animation by Ray Harryhausen. It stars William Hopper, Joan Taylor, and Frank Puglia. Set in Italy, the film centers on an alien lifeform from Venus that arrives via a crashed rocket, and begins rapidly growing.

The film was produced by Charles H. Schneer&#x27;s Morningside Productions for Columbia Pictures. The screenplay was written by Bob Williams and Christopher Knopf from an original treatment by Charlott Knight and Harryhausen. It was released theatrically in June 1957, to positive reviews.

==Plot==

The first U.S. spaceship to Venus, the XY-21, crashes into the Mediterranean sea off the coast of Italy. Fishermen in their boats head to the spacecraft, enter it through a hole, and pull two spacemen from the nose-down craft before it completely sinks.

In Washington, D.C., Major General A.D. McIntosh discovers that the missing spaceship, piloted by Colonel Bob Calder, has been located. As McIntosh flies to the site, Pepe, a little boy, finds a translucent cylinder marked “USAF” on the beach. It contains a gelatinous mass egg, which he sells to Dr. Leonardo, a zoologist studying sea creatures. Meanwhile, Leonardo&#x27;s granddaughter Marisa, a third-year medical student, is summoned to take care of the injured spacemen. When Calder regains consciousness, he finds his crewmate, Dr. Sharman, dying as his eight other crewmen did.

After Marisa returns to the trailer shared with her grandfather, a small creature hatches from the egg, and Leonardo locks it in a cage. By morning, the creature has tripled in size. McIntosh arrives, accompanied by scientist Dr. Justin Uhl, and meets with two representatives of the Italian government, informing them the spaceship has returned from Venus. Leonardo and Marisa hitch the trailer to their truck and head for Rome. Calder&#x27;s spacecraft carried a sealed metal container bearing an unborn Venusian species. As police divers begin to search for it, McIntosh offers a half-million lira reward for the capsule&#x27;s recovery, prompting Pepe to lead them to the empty container. When Pepe tells them that he sold the mass to Dr. Leonardo, McIntosh and Calder pursue him.

That night, Leonardo discovers that the creature has grown to human size. Soon after, it breaks out of the cage and heads to a nearby farm, terrorizing the animals. The creature eats sulfur and rips open several bags it discovers in a barn. While feeding, the creature is attacked by the farmer&#x27;s dog, and the creature maims the dog, alerting the farmer. Calder and the others reach the barn, trapping the creature inside. Calder explains that the creature is not dangerous unless provoked. However, he provokes it by trying to prod the creature with a pole into a cage-like cart, and the creature injures the farmer after he stabs the creature with a pitchfork. After the creature breaks out of the barn and disappears into the countryside, the police commissioner insists that it must be destroyed.

After the Italian government grants Calder permission to capture the creature alive, he devises a plan to ensnare it in an electric net dropped from a helicopter. The Italian police conduct their own pursuit, shooting at it with flamethrowers and rifles. Gunfire has little effect on the creature, as it has no heart or lungs. Aware that sulfur is the creature&#x27;s food of choice, Calder uses bags of sulfur as bait, luring the creature to a secluded site and subduing it with an electric jolt from the net. Later, at the American Embassy in Rome, McIntosh briefs the press corps and allows three reporters to view the creature, which has been placed in the Rome zoo. There, Calder explains that the creature is being sedated with a continuous electric shock so it can be studied. Marisa, who is aiding her uncle, begins flirting with Calder. Suddenly, electrical equipment shorts out and the creature awakens.

The creature, now gargantuan in size, battles a zoo elephant and sends the panicked patrons scurrying. Taking their fight to the streets of Rome, the two beasts destroy cars and damage buildings. The creature maims the elephant and continues its rampage. Calder rams the creature with his car and tracks the creature to the River Tiber, where it submerges. Soldiers lob grenades into the river, and the creature surfaces, destroying the Ponte Sant&#x27;Angelo. It destroys part of the Temple of Saturn, killing a few soldiers, and heads for the Colosseum. As the creature disappears into the ruins, Calder charges after it with a group of bazooka-carrying soldiers, driving it to the top of the structure. Calder scores a direct bazooka hit. Direct fire from a tank then destroys the ledge the creature is clinging to, and it plunges to its death. A relieved Marisa runs into Calder&#x27;s arms.

==Cast==

In addition, Ray Harryhausen, credited for the film&#x27;s &quot;Technical Special Effects&quot; (the stop-motion animation), has an uncredited cameo as a person throwing peanuts to a zoo elephant.

==Production==
The film was based on a concept by Ray Harryhausen called &quot;The Giant Ymir&quot;.

&quot;20 Million Miles to Earth&quot; began production in Rome, Italy in September 1956, using only William Hopper of the main cast, and moved to the U.S. from October 30 to November 9 of that year. Rome was chosen as the location for filming because Harryhausen wanted to vacation there. The working title of the film was &quot;The Giant Ymir&quot;, and it has also been released as &quot;The Beast from Space&quot;. All references to the name Ymir were removed from the released version of the film, as Harryhausen was concerned that audiences might confuse it with the Arabic title &quot;Emir&quot;. Most of the noises made by Ymir are recordings of elephant noises played at a higher speed.

It was the first of three collaborations between Harryhausen, Schneer, and Nathan Juran. Juran only directed the American sequences, while Schneer and Harryhausen directed the Italian sequences.

=== Colorization ===
Ray Harryhausen wanted the film to be shot in color, but the filmmakers were not given a budget large enough to accommodate color filming. In 2007, five years after the death of the film&#x27;s director, Harryhausen worked with restoration and colorization company Legend Films to create a colorized version of the film. That version, along with the original theatrical black-and-white version, was released on July 31, 2007 on DVD as part of a 50th Anniversary Edition of the film.

There are minor differences between the two versions. One example: the black-and-white version begins in &quot;A Fishing Village in Sicily&quot; (the fictional Gerra), not Sperlonga, Italy.

==Reception==
&quot;20 Million Miles to Earth&quot; has an 80% positive rating at the film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on ten reviews.

Marco Lanzagorta of &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave the film 9 out of 10 stars, calling it &quot;required viewing for those interested in modern cinema&quot;.

&quot;Time Out&quot; wrote: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about the dotty script or cardboard performances - just sit back and watch this gelatinous blob in action.&quot;

The &quot;Radio Times&quot; called the film: 

==Legacy==
The four-issue comic book mini-series &quot;20 Million Miles More&quot; (2008), released by TidalWave Productions as part of their Ray Harryhausen Signature Series, picked up the story 50 years after the events of the film. A preview of the first issue was included on the 50th Anniversary DVD release of the film.

<text>Cartridge number 1 in the official Philips line of games for the Philips Videopac contains three games: Race, Spin-out, and Cryptogram. In the United States, it was distributed for the Magnavox Odyssey² as Speedway / Spin-out / Cryptologic.

==Gameplay==

===&quot;Race&quot;===
&quot;Race&quot; is a fairly simple game where you control a car travelling on an infinite straight stretch of road. You start from a standstill, and move the stick up to accelerate, down to decelerate, right and left move the car sideways. The object is to keep driving for as long as possible, without crashing into any of the other cars. If you ever slow to a stop then your car gets run over.

===&quot;Spin-out&quot;===
&quot;Spin-out&quot; is a two-player game, in which each player controls a car around a loop of racetrack. The winner is the one who completes three or fifteen laps the fastest, there are time penalties for crashing into a wall or spinning when hit by the other car.

===&quot;Cryptogram&quot;===
&quot;Cryptogram&quot; is also for two players, one types in a message of up to fourteen characters, then hits enter to scramble it. The other player types in what they think it is, and loses points for each incorrect letter, in a similar fashion to hangman.

==Reception==
The cartridge was reviewed by &quot;Video&quot; magazine in its &quot;Arcade Alley&quot; column where it was praised as &quot;a good showcase for the [Odyssey²]&#x27;s capabilities&quot; whose varied gameplay is &quot;well calculated to whet the arcade addict&#x27;s appetite for more&quot;. The three constituent games were reviewed individually as well with &quot;Speedway&quot; receiving faint criticism for its overly easy slow speed setting, &quot;Spin-Out&quot; being described as &quot;best with two players&quot;, and &quot;Crypto-logic&quot; praised as &quot;an easy way for parents to help their school-age children with spelling.&quot;

<doc id="896699" wikidata="Q846467" url="?curid=896699" title="Theophory in the Bible">
<text>Theophory is the practice of embedding the name of a god or a deity in, usually, a proper name. Much Hebrew theophory occurs in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible). The most prominent theophory involves names referring to:
* El, a word meaning &quot;might&quot;, &quot;power&quot; and (a) &quot;god&quot; in general, and hence in Judaism, &quot;God&quot; and among the Canaanites the name of the god who was the father of the 70 Sons of God, including Yahweh and Baal.
* Yah, a shortened form of Yahweh.
* Levantine deities (especially the storm god, Hadad) by the epithet &quot;baal&quot;, meaning &quot;lord&quot;. In later times, as the conflict between Yahwism and the more popular pagan practices became increasingly intense, these names were censored and &quot;baal&quot; was replaced with &quot;bosheth&quot;, meaning &quot;shame&quot;.

===Incorrect El theophory===
The name &quot;Abel&quot;, which appears to refer to El, in fact is not an instance of theophory. &quot;Abel&quot; can be translated as &quot;breath&quot;, &quot;temporary&quot; or &quot;meaninglessness&quot; and is the word translated as &quot;vanity&quot; in in the King James Version.

The name &quot;Jael&quot; also appears to refer to El in English, but contains ayin rather than the aleph of El.

The name &quot;Eli&quot; also appears to refer to El in English, but contains ayin rather than aleph.

The name &quot;Rachel&quot; also appears to refer to El in English, but contains chet.

&quot;Ba&#x27;al&quot; is a generic term meaning &quot;master&quot;; it can also be translated &quot;Lord&quot;. In the Bible, it is frequently a reference to Hadad, although it is sometimes used to refer to other specific deities, including Yahweh, and on other occasions is used to refer to an arbitrary &quot;lord of this area&quot;.

:&quot;Jerub-baal&quot; – the lord contends

===Bosheth===
In later biblical and Jewish writing, some of the theophories in Ba&#x27;al were bowdlerised, with &quot;ba&#x27;al&quot; replaced by &quot;bosheth&quot; (&quot;(the) shameful (thing)&quot;):
:Ishbosheth, from Ishba&#x27;al, &quot;man of ba&#x27;al&quot;.

<text>Agaete is a municipality of Las Palmas province, on the Canary Islands, Spain.

== Geography ==
It is in the north-west of Gran Canaria island, and is enclosed by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Gáldar to the north-east, and Artenara to the south. Agaete&#x27;s area is with a population of (2003).

== Tourism ==
The port of Agaete, Puerto de las Nieves, used to be the preferred place to get a view of El Dedo de Dios, a natural monument on the coastline, before the latter was destroyed during tropical storm Delta in November 2005. The port is a common end point for day tours from more touristic areas of the island.

== Archaeology ==
El Maipes necropolis is on the outskirts of the town, in the south-east near the football ground.

<text>Musician is cartridge number 31 in the official Magnavox/Philips line of games for the Philips Videopac. It came in a cardboard box roughly double the size of a standard Videopac game box, containing a keyboard overlay in the style of a piano keyboard; the cartridge, in a standard Videopac box with a single sheet where the manual would usually be; and a landscape format manual, over double the size of a standard game manual.

The purpose of the set is to turn the user&#x27;s Videopac into a musical keyboard. It supports recording and editing sequences of up to 81 notes, although there is no way to save apart from writing a composition down on music manuscript. In the manual there are the following pieces of sheet music:

* &quot;Badinerie&quot; (Bach)

<doc id="896721" wikidata="Q7190767" url="?curid=896721" title="Pickaxe Pete">
<text>Pickaxe Pete is a video game released in 1982 as cartridge number 43 for the Philips Videopac console. It was published in North America for the Magnavox Odyssey² as Pick Axe Pete!. In Brazil, it was re-branded as Didi na Mina Encantada (&quot;Didi in the Enchanted Mine&quot;) for the Odyssey, featuring the character Didi from the TV series &quot;Os Trapalhões&quot; on the game cover. &quot;Pickaxe Pete&quot; is a platform game that followed in the wake of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; before the term existed; a 1982 issue of &quot;Joystik&quot; magazine labeled it a &quot;climbing game&quot;. It was designed and programmed by Ed Averett, who wrote the majority of the games for the system. 

A U.S. national competition, &quot;The &quot;Pick Axe Pete&quot; Pick-Off,&quot; was held at the World&#x27;s Fair in October 1982.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a miner named Pickaxe Pete who starts in the middle of the screen with a pick-axe. There are three doors from which boulders are coming, bouncing down the mine-shafts; every time Pete destroys one of these he gains 3 points, although the axe wears out after a while and disappears. When two boulders collide, they explode, and out comes either a pick-axe which floats to the bottom of the screen, a key which floats to the top, or nothing. If Pete has no axe, the player can either jump over boulders (gaining him 1 point), or get to the bottom of the mine to retrieve a new axe (gaining a 5-point bonus). If Pete collects a key then he can enter the doors, which lead him to the next level.

==Reception==
In a December 1982 review, US magazine &quot;Joystik&quot; called the game &quot;Odyssey&#x27;s new entry in the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; lookalike contest&quot;. The reviewer gave it a 3/10 for graphics and 7/10 for gameplay and concluded:

<doc id="896723" wikidata="Q652549" url="?curid=896723" title="K.C. Munchkin!">
<text>K.C. Munchkin!, released in Europe as Munchkin, is a maze game for the Magnavox Odyssey 2. Its North American title is an inside reference to then president of Philips Consumer Electronics, Kenneth C. Menkin.

Designed and programmed by Ed Averett, &quot;Munchkin&quot; is very heavily based on Namco&#x27;s 1980 arcade game &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, but not a direct clone. It was, however, similar enough for Atari to sue Philips and force them to cease production of &quot;Munchkin&quot;. Atari was exclusively licensed to produce the first play-at-home version of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, but &quot;Munchkin&quot; hit store shelves in 1981, a year before Atari&#x27;s game was ready. Atari initially failed to convince a U.S. district court to halt the sale of &quot;Munchkin&quot;, but ultimately won its case on appeal. In 1982, the appellate court found that Philips had copied &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and made alterations that &quot;only tend to emphasize the extent to which it deliberately copied the Plaintiff&#x27;s work.&quot; The ruling was one of the first to establish how copyright law would apply to the look and feel of computer software.

== Pac-Man dispute ==

Atari sued Philips for copyright infringement, arguing that &quot;Munchkin&quot; copied &quot;Pac-Man&quot; with its substantial similarities as evidence. In &quot;Atari, Inc. v. North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp.&quot;, the court noted twenty-two similarities, but also nine differences:&quot;&quot; 

* There are only 12 pills (called &quot;munchies&quot;) in each maze, which begin in four groups of three but move through the maze independently and at speeds that increase as each one is eaten. The final munchie moves at the same speed as the Munchkin and must be intercepted rather than followed.
* The super-pills are called &quot;blinking munchies&quot; because they flash and change colour.
* Some of the mazes become invisible as soon as the player starts moving.
* It has a programmable mode, where the player can create mazes.
* It has a random mode, where a new map is generated each time the game is played.
* The box where eaten ghosts regenerate rotates, so the ghosts may exit from any side. Also, the player character is free to enter the box and, if powered up, can consume new monsters at the moment they regenerate. Although the box is always at the center of any maze, the maze design allows walls to be placed against the box so it doubles as a revolving door and danger zone to pass through.
* The ghosts are called &quot;munchers&quot;, and the player&#x27;s character is called &quot;Munchkin&quot;.
* There are three munchers rather than four ghosts.
* Compared with the Atari 2600 version of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Munchkin&quot; has fewer objects on the game board but renders them with more color and animation.
* When the Munchkin is killed by the munchers, the score resets itself back to zero.

After &quot;Munchkin&quot; was forced off the market, Philips released a sequel called &quot;K.C.&#x27;s Krazy Chase!&quot; (&quot;Crazy Chase&quot; outside the U.S.) which implicitly depicts the conflict between Phillips and Atari by pitting the Munchkin character against an insectoid, tree-eating opponent called the Dratapillar, which very strongly resembles the antagonist of Atari&#x27;s &quot;Centipede&quot;. In &quot;Crazy Chase&quot;&#x27;s maze, the Munchkin character powers up and advances not by eating pills, but by devouring the Dratapillar&#x27;s segmented body. Redesigned to avoid another copyright dispute, the Munchkin character rolls through Crazy Chase&#x27;s mazes without the continuous chomping motion characteristic of Pac-Man.

<doc id="896725" wikidata="Q6000561" url="?curid=896725" title="Illusory promise">
<text>In contract law, an illusory promise is one that courts will not enforce. This is in contrast with a contract, which is a promise that courts will enforce. A promise may be illusory for a number of reasons. In common law countries this usually results from failure or lack of consideration (see also consideration under English law).

Illusory promises are so named because they merely hold the illusion of contract. For example, a promise of the form, &quot;I will give you ten dollars if I feel like it,&quot; is purely illusory and will not be enforced as a contract.

It is a general principle of contract law that courts should err on the side of enforcing contracts. Parties entering into the arrangement presumably had the intention of forming an enforceable contract, and so courts generally attempt to follow this intention.

A promise conditioned upon an event within the promisor&#x27;s control is not illusory if the promisor also &quot;impliedly promises to make reasonable effort to bring the event about or to use good faith and honest judgment in determining whether or not it has in fact occurred.&quot;

Methods of finding potentially illusory contracts enforceable include:
* Implied-in-law &quot;good faith&quot; terms
* Implied-in-fact terms
* Bargaining for a chance

==Implied-in-law &quot;good faith&quot; terms==
Many contracts include &quot;satisfaction clauses&quot;, in which a promisor can refuse to pay if he isn&#x27;t subjectively satisfied with the promisee&#x27;s performance. Strictly speaking, this is an illusory promise, since the promisor has no actual legal burden to pay if he chooses not to. However, courts will generally imply in law that the promisor must act in good faith and reject the deal only if he is genuinely dissatisfied. As another example, if a contract promises a promisee a certain percentage of the proceeds of a promisor&#x27;s business activities, this is illusory, since the promisor doesn&#x27;t have to do anything: any percentage of zero is zero. However, courts may find that the promisor made an implied promise to use reasonable efforts to try to make money, and cite him for breach of contract if he does absolutely nothing. The U.C.C. in contracts exclusive to both sides requires &quot;best efforts&quot; in such contracts. This may be read to be the same as a good faith effort, but is seen by some courts as a higher duty.

==Implied-in-fact terms==
Judges will often infer terms into the contract that the parties did not explicitly cite. For instance, in the &quot;satisfaction clause&quot; case, judges might infer that the parties intended a &quot;reasonableness test&quot; - that the clause could be satisfied if a reasonable person would be satisfied by the promisee&#x27;s performance, regardless of whether the promisor himself asserts he is satisfied. (This interpretation is often used in cases in which a performance can be objectively evaluated, such as with the construction of a warehouse; the implied-in-law interpretation above is preferred where satisfaction is more subjective, as with the painting of a portrait.)

==Bargaining for a chance==
Many judges would consider the &quot;bargaining for a percentage of the proceeds&quot; example above an enforceable contract, even without an implied-in-fact or implied-in-law good faith term. They would view the opportunity to enter into a business relationship to itself be acceptable consideration. Put differently, the mere possibility that the promisor would do business is a valuable product of the bargain even if he does not do anything. Of course, if the promisor entered into the relationship purely with the intent of fraudulently harming the promisee, he could be cited for fraud or bad faith principles that apply to all contracts.

==Changes to a &quot;contract&quot; without notification==
The &quot;terms and conditions&quot; of some websites and Software applications may be deemed an illusory contract and unenforceable if the language can be changed at any time by the company without notifying users and giving them a chance to accept the new changes.

In &quot;Douglas v. U.S. District Court ex rel Talk America&quot;, the court found a telephone service provider could not change the terms of its service contract by merely posting a revised contract on its website because &quot;an offeree cannot assent to an offer unless he knows of its existence.&quot;

<text>Daniel Chee Tsui (, born February 28, 1939) is an American physicist. He is currently serving as the Professor of Electrical Engineering, emeritus, at Princeton University. Tsui&#x27;s areas of research include electrical properties of thin films and microstructures of semiconductors and solid-state physics.

Tsui won the Nobel Prize in Physics of 1998 with Robert B. Laughlin and Horst L. Störmer &quot;for their discovery of a new form of quantum fluid with fractionally charged excitations.&quot;

==Biography==
Tsui was born into a Chinese agricultural family with two illiterate parents in Fanzhuang (Henan) (), Baofeng, Henan, Republic of China, on February 28, 1939. Born in the midst of Second World War, Tsui described his early childhood memories as being &quot;filled with the years of drought, flood and war which were constantly on the consciousness of the inhabitants of my over-populated village.&quot;

In 1951, Tsui left for Hong Kong to attend Pui Ching Middle School in Kowloon, beginning his formal education at the level of sixth grade in his second year in Hong Kong. Tsui recalled facing difficulties due to his lack of familiarity with Cantonese dialect used.

Upon graduating in 1957, Tsui was admitted to the National Taiwan University Medical School, but due to uncertainties over whether he would be able to return to his family in China, he remained in Hong Kong to enroll in Special Classes Centre, a special two-year government program intended to prepare high school graduates for entrance into the University of Hong Kong. While preparing for the entrance examination to the University of Hong Kong in spring of 1958, Tsui was awarded a full scholarship to attend Augustana College, his church pastor&#x27;s Lutheran alma mater in the United States. Accepting the scholarship, Tsui arrived at Augustana College just after Labor Day of 1958.

After spending three years at Augustana College, Tsui graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1961 as the only student of Chinese descent in his college. Tsui continued his study in physics at the University of Chicago, from where he received his Ph.D. in physics in 1967 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;de Haas-van Alphen effect and electronic band structure of nickel&quot;, under the supervision of Royal Stark. He remarked that due to the influence of prominent Chinese theoretical physicists and Nobel laureates C. N. Yang and T. D. Lee, both of whom studied at the University of Chicago, he had always known that he wanted to pursue graduate studies in physics at the institution.

While a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Tsui met Linda Varland, who was an undergraduate student there at the time, and the two married after the latter&#x27;s graduation. Tsui is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Tsui and Varland have two daughters, Aileen and Judith. Judith graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Princeton University with a B.A. in anthropology in 1991 and is now an associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

After receiving his Ph.D. and then remaining in Chicago for a year of postdoctoral research, Tsui joined the research staff at Bell Laboratories to perform research in solid state physics in 1968. At Bell Laboratories, instead of studying mainstream topics of interest in semiconductor physics such as optics and high energy band-structures or their applications in devices, Tsui devoted his attention to a new field called the physics of two-dimensional electrons.

Tsui and Störmer made the groundbreaking discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect in 1982, while Laughlin provided a theoretical interpretation for the discovery the following year. This discovery will eventually be the reason of their winning of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Shortly after the discovery, Tsui departed from Bell Laboratories and joined the faculty of the department of electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton University with the support of two Nobel laureates in February 1982. After 28 years at Princeton, Tsui transferred to emeritus status in 2010.

He was also an adjunct senior research scientist in the physics department of Columbia University, and a research professor at Boston University.

Tsui is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
2022, Tsui is among only three of Chinese Nobel laureates who voiced their support for Ukraine.

<text>Sylver coinage is a mathematical game for two players, invented by John H. Conway. The two players take turns naming positive integers that are not the sum of nonnegative multiples of previously named integers. The player who names 1 loses. For instance, if player A opens with 2, B can win by naming 3 as A is forced to name 1. Sylver coinage is an example of a game using misère play because the player who is last able to move loses.

Sylver coinage is named after
James Joseph Sylvester, who proved that if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;
are relatively prime positive integers, then (&quot;a&quot; − 1)(&quot;b&quot;  − 1) − 1 is the largest number that is not a sum of nonnegative multiples of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Thus, if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the first two moves in a game of sylver coinage, this formula gives the largest number that can still be played. More generally, if the greatest common divisor of the moves played so far is &quot;g&quot;, then only finitely many multiples of &quot;g&quot; can remain to be played, and after they are all played then &quot;g&quot; must decrease on the next move. Therefore, every game of sylver coinage must eventually end. When a sylver coinage game has only a finite number of remaining moves, the largest number that can still be played is called the Frobenius number, and finding this number is called the coin problem.

== Example ==
A sample game between A and B:
* A opens with 5. Now neither player can name 5, 10, 15, ...
* B names 4. Now neither player can name 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, or any number greater than 11. (Example: 27 = 4·3 + 5·3)
* A names 11. Now the only remaining numbers are 2, 3, 6, and 7.
* B names 6. Now the only remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 7.
* A names 7. Now the only remaining numbers are 2, and 3.
* B names 2. Now the only remaining number is 3.
* A names 3, leaving nothing for B, and wins.

Each of A&#x27;s moves was to a winning position.

==Analysis==
Unlike many similar mathematical games, sylver coinage has not been completely solved, mainly because many positions have infinitely many possible moves. Furthermore, the main theorem that identifies a class of winning positions, due to R. L. Hutchings, guarantees that such a position has a winning strategy but does not identify the strategy. Hutchings&#x27;s Theorem states that any of the prime numbers 5, 7, 11, 13, …, wins as a first move, but very little is known about the subsequent winning moves: these are the only winning openings known.

When the greatest common divisor of the moves that have been made so far is 1, the remaining set of numbers that can be played will be a finite set, and can be described mathematically as the set of gaps of a numerical semigroup. Some of these finite positions, including all of the positions after the second player has responded to one of Hutchings&#x27; winning moves, allow a special move that Sicherman calls an &quot;ender&quot;.
An ender is a number that may only be played immediately: playing any other number would rule it out. If an ender exists, it is always the largest number that can still be played. For instance, after the moves (4,5), the largest number that can still be played is 11. Playing 11 cannot rule out any smaller numbers, but playing any of the smaller available numbers (1, 2, 3, 6, or 7) would rule out playing 11, so 11 is an ender. When an ender exists, the next player can win by following a strategy-stealing argument. If one of the non-ender moves can win, the next player takes that winning move. And if none of the non-ender moves wins, then the next player can win by playing the ender and forcing the other player to make one of the other non-winning moves. However, although this argument proves that the next player can win, it does not identify a winning strategy for the player. After playing a prime number that is 5 or larger as a first move, the first player in a game of sylver coinage can always win by following this (non-constructive) ender strategy on their next turn.
If there are any other winning openings, they must be 3-smooth numbers (numbers of the form for non-negative integers and ).
For, if any number that is not of this form and is not prime is played, then the second player can win by choosing a large prime factor of .
The first few 3-smooth numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12, are all losing openings, for which complete strategies are known by which the second player can win.
By Dickson&#x27;s lemma (applied to the pairs of exponents of these numbers), only finitely many 3-smooth numbers can be winning openings, but it is not known whether any of them are. In 2017,
 offered a $1000 prize for determining who wins in the first unsolved case, the opening move 16, as part of a set of prize problems also including Conway&#x27;s 99-graph problem, the minimum spacing of Danzer sets, and the thrackle conjecture.

<text>Xenoarchaeology, a branch of xenology dealing with extraterrestrial cultures, is a hypothetical form of archaeology that exists mainly in works of science fiction. The field is concerned with the study of the material remains to reconstruct and interpret past life-ways of alien civilizations. Xenoarchaeology is not currently practiced by mainstream archaeologists due to the current lack of any material for the discipline to study.

==Etymology==
The name derives from Greek &quot;xenos&quot; (ξένος) which means &#x27;stranger, alien&#x27;, and archaeology &#x27;study of ancients&#x27;.

Xenoarchaeology is sometimes called &quot;astroarchaeology&quot; or &quot;exoarchaeology&quot;, although some would argue that the prefix exo- would be more correctly applied to the study of human activities in a space environment.

Other names for xenoarchaeology, or specialised fields of interest, include Probe SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), extraterrestrial archaeology, space archaeology, SETA (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Artifacts), Dysonian SETI, Planetary SETI, SETT (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Technology), SETV (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Visitation), extraterrestrial anthropology, areoarchaeology and selenoarchaeology.

==Justification==
It is arguably the case that, due to the immense distances between stars, any evidence we discover of extraterrestrial intelligence, whether it be an artifact or an electromagnetic signal, may come from a long-vanished civilization. Thus the entire SETI project can be seen as a form of archaeology. Additionally, due to the extreme age of the universe, there may be a reasonable expectation for astrobiology research to produce evidence of extinct alien life prior to the discovery of alien life itself.

The study of alien cultures might offer us glimpses into our own species&#x27; past or future development.

Vicky Walsh argued for the existence of &quot;exo-artifacts&quot; using the principle of mediocrity and the Drake equation. She proposed that a theoretical and speculative field of archaeology be established in order to test outlandish claims and to prepare for a time when undeniably extraterrestrial artifacts needed to be analysed. &quot;If it is possible to construct an abstract archaeology that can be tested and refined on earth and then applied to areas beyond our planet, then the claims for ETI remains on the moon and Mars may really be evaluated in light of established archaeological theory and analysis&quot;.

Ben McGee similarly proposed the creation of a set of interdisciplinary, proactive xenoarchaeological guidelines, arguing that identifying suspected artifacts of astrobiology is all that is required to justify establishing a methodology for xenoarchaeology. He emphasized the necessity of proactive xenoarchaeological work in order to avoid future bias, mischaracterization, and information mismanagement, and he cites three scenarios under which such a methodology or set of guidelines would be useful, those being &quot;remote sensing&quot; of a potential xenoarchaeological artifact, encountering an artifact during &quot;human exploration,&quot; and &quot;terrestrial interception&quot; of an artifact.

==History==
The origins of the field have been traced to theories about a hypothetical Martian civilization based on observations of what were perceived as canals on Mars. These theories, of which Percival Lowell was the most famous exponent, were apparently inspired by a mistranslation of a quote by Giovanni Schiaparelli.

The 1997 Theoretical Archaeology Group conference featured a session on &quot;archaeology and science fiction&quot;.

The 2004 annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association featured a session &quot;Anthropology, Archaeology and Interstellar Communication&quot;.

==Planetary SETI==
Planetary SETI is concerned with the search for extraterrestrial structures on the surface of bodies in the Solar System. Claims for evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts can be divided into three groups, the Moon, Mars, and the other planets and their satellites.

Examples of sites of interest include the &quot;bridge&quot; sighted in the Mare Crisium in 1953, and the &quot;Blair Cuspids&quot;, &quot;an unusual arrangement of seven spirelike objects of varying heights&quot; at the western edge of the &quot;Mare Tranquillitatis&quot;, photographed by the Lunar Orbiter 2 on 20 November 1966. In 2006, Ian Crawford proposed that a search for alien artifacts be conducted on the Moon.

Percival Lowell&#x27;s mistaken identification of Martian canals was an early attempt to detect and study an alien culture from its supposed physical remains. More recently, there was interest in the supposed Face on Mars, an example of the psychological phenomenon of pareidolia.

The Society for Planetary SETI Research is a loose organization of researchers interested in this field. The organization does not endorse any particular conclusions drawn by its members on particular sites.

==Probe SETI, or SETA==

A great deal of research and writing has been done, and some searches conducted for extraterrestrial probes in the Solar System. This followed the work of Ronald N. Bracewell.

Robert Freitas, Christopher Rose and Gregory Wright have argued that interstellar probes can be a more energy-efficient means of communication than electromagnetic broadcasts.

If so, a solar centric Search for Extraterrestrial Artifacts (SETA) would seem to be favored over the more traditional radio or optical searches. Robert A. Freitas coined the term SETA in the 1980s.

On the basis that the Earth-Moon or Sun-Earth libration orbits might constitute convenient parking places for automated extraterrestrial probes, unsuccessful searches were conducted by Freitas and Valdes.

==Dysonian SETI==
In a 1960 paper, Freeman Dyson proposed the idea of a Dyson sphere, a type of extraterrestrial artifact able to be searched for and studied at interstellar distances. Following that paper, several searches have been conducted.

In a 2005 paper, Luc Arnold proposed a means of detecting smaller, though still mega-scale, artifacts from their distinctive transit light curve signature. &quot;(see Astroengineering)&quot;.

==Fringe theories==
A subculture of enthusiasts studies purported structures on the Moon or Mars. These controversial &quot;structures&quot; (such as the Face on Mars) are not accepted as more than natural features by most scientists, examples of the pareidolia phenomenon.

Palaeocontact or ancient astronaut theories, espoused by Erich von Däniken and others, are further examples of fringe theories. These claim that the Earth was visited in prehistoric times by extraterrestrial beings.

==Science fiction==

Xenoarchaeological themes are common in science fiction. Works about the exploration of enigmatic extraterrestrial artifacts have been satirically categorized as Big Dumb Object stories.

Some of the more prominent examples of xenoarchaeological fiction include Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, H. Beam Piper&#x27;s short story &quot;Omnilingual&quot;, and Charles Sheffield&#x27;s Heritage Universe series.

<text>A truss bridge is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss, a structure of connected elements, usually forming triangular units. The connected elements, typically straight, may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads. There are several types of truss bridges, including some with simple designs that were among the first bridges designed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A truss bridge is economical to construct primarily because it uses materials efficiently.

== Design ==
The nature of a truss allows the analysis of its structure using a few assumptions and the application of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion according to the branch of physics known as statics. For purposes of analysis, trusses are assumed to be pin jointed where the straight components meet, meaning that taken alone, every joint on the structure is functionally considered to be a flexible joint as opposed to a rigid joint with the strength to maintain its shape, and the resulting shape and strength of the structure are only maintained by the interlocking of the components. This assumption means that members of the truss (chords, verticals, and diagonals) will act only in tension or compression. A more complex analysis is required where rigid joints impose significant bending loads upon the elements, as in a Vierendeel truss.

In the bridge illustrated in the infobox at the top, vertical members are in tension, lower horizontal members in tension, shear, and bending, outer diagonal and top members are in compression, while the inner diagonals are in tension. The central vertical member stabilizes the upper compression member, preventing it from buckling. If the top member is sufficiently stiff then this vertical element may be eliminated. If the lower chord (a horizontal member of a truss) is sufficiently resistant to bending and shear, the outer vertical elements may be eliminated, but with additional strength added to other members in compensation. The ability to distribute the forces in various ways has led to a large variety of truss bridge types. Some types may be more advantageous when the wood is employed for compression elements while other types may be easier to erect in particular site conditions, or when the balance between labor, machinery, and material costs has certain favorable proportions.

The inclusion of the elements shown is largely an engineering decision based upon economics, being a balance between the costs of raw materials, off-site fabrication, component transportation, on-site erection, the availability of machinery, and the cost of labor. In other cases, the appearance of the structure may take on greater importance and so influence the design decisions beyond mere matters of economics. Modern materials such as prestressed concrete and fabrication methods, such as automated welding, and the changing price of steel relative to that of labor have significantly influenced the design of modern bridges.

=== Model bridges ===
A pure truss can be represented as a pin-jointed structure, one where the only forces on the truss members are tension or compression, not bending. This is used in the teaching of statics, by the building of model bridges from spaghetti. Spaghetti is brittle and although it can carry a modest tension force, it breaks easily if bent. A model spaghetti bridge thus demonstrates the use of a truss structure to produce a usefully strong complete structure from individually weak elements.

==United States==
In the United States, because wood was in abundance, early truss bridges would typically use carefully fitted timbers for members taking compression and iron rods for tension members, usually constructed as a covered bridge to protect the structure. In 1820, a simple form of truss, Town&#x27;s lattice truss, was patented, and had the advantage of requiring neither high labor skills nor much metal. Few iron truss bridges were built in the United States before 1850.

Truss bridges became a common type of bridge built from the 1870s through the 1930s. Examples of these bridges still remain across the US, but their numbers are dropping rapidly as they are demolished and replaced with new structures. As metal slowly started to replace timber, wrought iron bridges in the US started being built on a large scale in the 1870s. Bowstring truss bridges were a common truss design during this time, with their arched top chords. Companies like the Massillon Bridge Company of Massillon, Ohio, and the King Bridge Company of Cleveland, became well-known, as they marketed their designs to cities and townships.

The bowstring truss design fell out of favor due to a lack of durability, and gave way to the Pratt truss design, which was stronger. Again, the bridge companies marketed their designs, with the Wrought Iron Bridge Company in the lead. As the 1880s and 1890s progressed, steel began to replace wrought iron as the preferred material. Other truss designs were used during this time, including the camel-back. By the 1910s, many states developed standard plan truss bridges, including steel Warren pony truss bridges.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Pennsylvania and several states continued to build steel truss bridges, using massive steel through-truss bridges for long spans. Other states, such as Michigan, used standard plan concrete girder and beam bridges, and only a limited number of truss bridges were built.

==Roadbed types==
The truss may carry its roadbed on top, in the middle, or at the bottom of the truss. Bridges with the roadbed at the top or the bottom are the most common as this allows both the top and bottom to be stiffened, forming a box truss. When the roadbed is atop the truss, it is a deck truss; an example of this was the I-35W Mississippi River bridge. When the truss members are both above and below the roadbed it is called a through truss; an example of this is the Pulaski Skyway, and where the sides extend above the roadbed but are not connected, a pony truss or half-through truss.

Sometimes both the upper and lower chords support roadbeds, forming a double-decked truss. This can be used to separate rail from road traffic or to separate the two directions of road traffic.

Since through truss bridges have supports located over the bridge deck, they are susceptible to being hit by overheight loads when used on highways. The I-5 Skagit River bridge collapsed after such a strike; before the collapse, similar incidents had been common and had necessitated frequent repairs.

==Multiple spans==
Truss bridges consisting of more than one span may be either a continuous truss or a series of simple trusses. In the simple truss design, each span is supported only at the ends and is fully independent of any adjacent spans. Each span must fully support the weight of any vehicles traveling over it (the live load).

In contrast, a continuous truss functions as a single rigid structure over multiple supports. This means that the live load on one span is partially supported by the other spans, and consequently it is possible to use less material in the truss. Continuous truss bridges were not very common before the mid-20th century because they are statically indeterminate, which makes them difficult to design without the use of computers.

A multi-span truss bridge may also be constructed using cantilever spans, which are supported at only one end rather than both ends like other types of trusses. Unlike a continuous truss, a cantilever truss does not need to be connected rigidly, or indeed at all, at the center. Many cantilever bridges, like the Quebec Bridge shown below, have two cantilever spans supporting a simple truss in the center. The bridge would remain standing if the simple truss section were removed.

==Truss types used in bridges==

Bridges are the most widely known examples of truss use. There are many types, some of them dating back hundreds of years. Below are some of the more common designs.

=== Allan truss ===

The Allan truss, designed by Percy Allan, is partly based on the Howe truss. The first Allan truss was completed on 13 August 1894 over Glennies Creek at Camberwell, New South Wales and the last Allan truss bridge was built over Mill Creek near Wisemans Ferry in 1929. Completed in March 1895, the Tharwa Bridge located at Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory, was the second Allan truss bridge to be built, the oldest surviving bridge in the Australian Capital Territory and the oldest, longest continuously used Allan truss bridge. Completed in November 1895, the Hampden Bridge in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia, the first of the Allan truss bridges with overhead bracing, was originally designed as a steel bridge but was constructed with timber to reduce cost. In his design, Allan used Australian ironbark for its strength. A similar bridge also designed by Percy Allen is the Victoria Bridge on Prince Street, Picton, New South Wales. Also constructed of ironbark, the bridge is still in use today for pedestrian and light traffic.

=== Bailey truss ===

The Bailey truss was designed by the British in 1940–1941 for military uses during World War II. A short selection of prefabricated modular components could be easily and speedily combined on land in various configurations to adapt to the needs at the site and allow rapid deployment of completed trusses. In the image, note the use of pairs of doubled trusses to adapt to the span and load requirements. In other applications the trusses may be stacked vertically, and doubled as necessary.

=== Baltimore truss ===

The Baltimore truss is a subclass of the Pratt truss. A Baltimore truss has additional bracing in the lower section of the truss to prevent buckling in the compression members and to control deflection. It is mainly used for rail bridges, showing off a simple and very strong design. In the Pratt truss the intersection of the verticals and the lower horizontal tension members are used to anchor the supports for the short-span girders under the tracks (among other things). With the Baltimore truss, there are almost twice as many points for this to happen because the short verticals will also be used to anchor the supports. Thus the short-span girders can be made lighter because their span is shorter. A good example of the Baltimore truss is the Amtrak Old Saybrook – Old Lyme Bridge in Connecticut, United States.

=== Bollman truss ===
The Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge at Savage, Maryland, United States is the only surviving example of a revolutionary design in the history of American bridge engineering. The type was named after its inventor, Wendel Bollman, a self-educated Baltimore engineer. It was the first successful all-metal bridge design (patented in 1852) to be adopted and consistently used on a railroad. The design employs wrought iron tension members and cast iron compression members. The use of multiple independent tension elements reduces the likelihood of catastrophic failure. The structure was also easy to assemble.

Wells Creek Bollman Bridge is the only other bridge designed by Wendel Bollman still in existence, but it is a Warren truss configuration.

=== Bowstring truss ===
The bowstring truss bridge was patented in 1841 by Squire Whipple. While similar in appearance to a tied-arch bridge, a bowstring truss has diagonal load-bearing members: these diagonals result in a structure that more closely matches a Parker truss or Pratt truss than a true arch.

===Brown truss===
In the Brown truss all vertical elements are under tension, with exception of the end posts. This type of truss is particularly suited for timber structures that use iron rods as tension members.

===Brunel truss===
See Lenticular truss below.

===Burr arch truss===

This combines an arch with a truss to form a structure both strong and rigid.

=== Cantilever truss ===
Most trusses have the lower chord under tension and the upper chord under compression. In a cantilever truss the situation is reversed, at least over a portion of the span. The typical cantilever truss bridge is a &quot;balanced cantilever&quot;, which enables the construction to proceed outward from a central vertical spar in each direction. Usually these are built in pairs until the outer sections may be anchored to footings. A central gap, if present, can then be filled by lifting a conventional truss into place or by building it in place using a &quot;traveling support&quot;. In another method of construction, one outboard half of each balanced truss is built upon temporary falsework. When the outboard halves are completed and anchored the inboard halves may then be constructed and the center section completed as described above.

=== Fink truss ===
The Fink truss was designed by Albert Fink of Germany in 1854. This type of bridge was popular with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The Appomattox High Bridge on the Norfolk and Western Railway included 21 Fink deck truss spans from 1869 until their replacement in 1886.
There are also inverted Fink truss bridges such as the Moody Pedestrian Bridge in Austin, Texas.

===Howe truss===
The Howe truss, patented in 1840 by Massachusetts millwright William Howe, includes vertical members and diagonals that slope up towards the center, the opposite of the Pratt truss.
In contrast to the Pratt truss, the diagonal web members are in compression and the vertical web members are in tension. Few of these bridges remain standing. Examples include Jay Bridge in Jay, New York; McConnell&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge in Slippery Rock Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania; Sandy Creek Covered Bridge in Jefferson County, Missouri; and Westham Island Bridge in Delta, British Columbia, Canada.
=== K-truss ===
The K-truss is named after the &quot;K&quot; formed in each panel by the vertical member and two oblique members. Examples include the Südbrücke rail bridge over the River Rhine, Mainz, Germany, the bridge on I-895 (Baltimore Harbor Tunnel Thruway) in Baltimore, Maryland, the Long–Allen Bridge in Morgan City, Louisiana (Morgan City Bridge) with three 600-foot-long spans, and the Wax Lake Outlet bridge in Calumet, Louisiana

=== Kingpost truss ===
One of the simplest truss styles to implement, the king post consists of two angled supports leaning into a common vertical support.

=== Lattice truss (Town&#x27;s lattice truss) ===

This type of bridge uses a substantial number of lightweight elements, easing the task of construction. Truss elements are usually of wood, iron, or steel.

=== Lenticular truss ===

A lenticular truss bridge includes a lens-shape truss, with trusses between an upper chord functioning as an arch that curves up and then down to end points, and a lower chord (functioning as a suspension cable) that curves down and then up to meet at the same end points. Where the arches extend above and below the roadbed, it is called a lenticular pony truss bridge. The Pauli truss bridge is a specific variant of the lenticular truss, but the terms are not interchangeable.

One type of lenticular truss consists of arcuate upper compression chords and lower eyebar chain tension links. Brunel&#x27;s Royal Albert Bridge over the River Tamar between Devon and Cornwall uses a single tubular upper chord. As the horizontal tension and compression forces are balanced these horizontal forces are not transferred to the supporting pylons (as is the case with most arch types). This in turn enables the truss to be fabricated on the ground and then to be raised by jacking as supporting masonry pylons are constructed. This truss has been used in the construction of a stadium, with the upper chords of parallel trusses supporting a roof that may be rolled back. The Smithfield Street Bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is another example of this type.
An example of a lenticular pony truss bridge that uses regular spans of iron is the Turn-of-River Bridge designed and manufactured by the Berlin Iron Bridge Co.

The Pauli truss is a variant of the lenticular truss, &quot;with the top chord carefully shaped so that it has a constant force along the entire length of the truss.&quot; It is named after , whose 1857 railway bridge (the ) spanned the Isar near Munich. (&quot;See also Grosshesselohe Isartal station&quot;.) The term Pauli truss is not interchangeable with the term lenticular truss and, according to Thomas Boothby, the casual use of the term has clouded the literature.

=== Long truss ===

The Long truss was designed by Stephen H. Long in 1830. The design resembles a Howe truss, but is entirely made of wood instead of a combination of wood and metal. The longest surviving example is the Eldean Covered Bridge north of Troy, Ohio, spanning . One of the earliest examples is the Old Blenheim Bridge, which with a span of and a total length of long was the second-longest covered bridge in the United States, until its destruction from flooding in 2011.

The Busching bridge, often erroneously used as an example of a Long truss, is an example of a Howe truss, as the verticals are metal rods.

=== Parker (camelback) truss ===

A Parker truss bridge is a Pratt truss design with a polygonal upper chord. A &quot;camelback&quot; is a subset of the Parker type, where the upper chord consists of exactly five segments. An example of a Parker truss is the Traffic Bridge in Saskatoon, Canada. An example of a camelback truss is the Woolsey Bridge near Woolsey, Arkansas.

=== Partridge truss ===

Designed and patented in 1872 by Reuben Partridge, after local bridge designs proved ineffective against road traffic and heavy rains. It became the standard for covered bridges built in central Ohio in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

=== Pegram truss ===

The Pegram truss is a hybrid between the Warren and Parker trusses where the upper chords are all of equal length and the lower chords are longer than the corresponding upper chord. Because of the difference in upper and lower chord length, each panel is not square. The members which would be vertical in a Parker truss vary from near vertical in the center of the span to diagonal near each end, similar to a Warren truss. George H. Pegram, while the chief engineer of Edge Moor Iron Company in Wilmington, Delaware, patented this truss design in 1885.

The Pegram truss consists of a Parker type design with the vertical posts leaning towards the center at an angle between 60 and 75°. The variable post angle and constant chord length allowed steel in existing bridges to be recycled into a new span using the Pegram truss design. This design also facilitated reassembly and permitted a bridge to be adjusted to fit different span lengths. There are twelve known remaining Pegram span bridges in the United States with seven in Idaho, two in Kansas, and one each in California, Washington, and Utah.

=== Pennsylvania (Petit) truss ===
The Pennsylvania (Petit) truss is a variation on the Pratt truss. The Pratt truss includes braced diagonal members in all panels; the Pennsylvania truss adds to this design half-length struts or ties in the top, bottom, or both parts of the panels. It is named after the Pennsylvania Railroad, which pioneered this design. It was once used for hundreds of bridges in the United States, but fell out of favor in the 1930s and very few examples of this design remain. Examples of this truss type include the Lower Trenton Bridge in Trenton, New Jersey, the Fort Wayne Street Bridge in Goshen, Indiana, the Schell Bridge in Northfield, Massachusetts, the Inclined Plane Bridge in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the Easton–Phillipsburg Toll Bridge in Easton, Pennsylvania, the Connecticut River Bridge in Brattleboro, Vermont, the Metropolis Bridge in Metropolis, Illinois, and the Healdsburg Memorial Bridge in Healdsburg, California.

=== Post truss ===

A Post truss is a hybrid between a Warren truss and a double-intersection Pratt truss. Invented in 1863 by Simeon S. Post, it is occasionally referred to as a &quot;Post patent truss&quot; although he never received a patent for it. The Ponakin Bridge and the Bell Ford Bridge are two examples of this truss.

=== Pratt truss ===

A Pratt truss includes vertical members and diagonals that slope down towards the center, the opposite of the Howe truss. The interior diagonals are under tension under balanced loading and vertical elements under compression. If pure tension elements (such as eyebars) are used in the diagonals, then crossing elements may be needed near the center to accept concentrated live loads as they traverse the span. It can be subdivided, creating Y- and K-shaped patterns. The Pratt truss was invented in 1844 by Thomas and Caleb Pratt. This truss is practical for use with spans up to and was a common configuration for railroad bridges as truss bridges moved from wood to metal. They are statically determinate bridges, which lend themselves well to long spans. They were common in the United States between 1844 and the early 20th century.

Examples of Pratt truss bridges are the Governor&#x27;s Bridge in Maryland; the Hayden RR Bridge in Springfield, Oregon, built in 1882; the Dearborn River High Bridge near Augusta, Montana, built in 1897; and the Fair Oaks Bridge in Fair Oaks, California, built 1907–09.

The Scenic Bridge near Tarkio, Montana, is an example of a Pratt deck truss bridge, where the roadway is on top of the truss.

===Queenpost truss===
The queenpost truss, sometimes called &quot;queen post&quot; or queenspost, is similar to a king post truss in that the outer supports are angled towards the center of the structure. The primary difference is the horizontal extension at the center which relies on beam action to provide mechanical stability. This truss style is only suitable for relatively short spans.

===Smith truss===

The Smith truss, patented by Robert W Smith on July 16, 1867, has mostly diagonal criss-crossed supports. Smith&#x27;s company used many variations of this pattern in the wooden covered bridges it built.

While most all of the bridges built in the 19th century in the Jackson County, Ohio, area used the Smith truss design, the Johnson Road Covered Bridge is the last known surviving example in the state.

===Thacher truss===

The Thacher truss combines some of the characteristics of a Pratt truss with diagonals under tension and of a Howe truss with diagonals under compression, which is rare.

=== Truss arch ===
A truss arch may contain all horizontal forces within the arch itself, or alternatively may be either a thrust arch consisting of a truss, or of two arcuate sections pinned at the apex. The latter form is common when the bridge is constructed as cantilever segments from each side as in the Navajo Bridge.

===Vierendeel truss===
The Vierendeel truss, unlike common pin-jointed trusses, imposes significant bending forces upon its members—but this in turn allows the elimination of many diagonal elements. It is a structure where the members are not triangulated but form rectangular openings, and is a frame with fixed joints that are capable of transferring and resisting bending moments. While rare as a bridge type due to higher costs compared to a triangulated truss, it is commonly employed in modern building construction as it allows the resolution of gross shear forces against the frame elements while retaining rectangular openings between columns. This is advantageous both in allowing flexibility in the use of the building space and freedom in selection of the building&#x27;s outer curtain wall, which affects both interior and exterior styling aspects.

=== Waddell truss ===
Patented 1894 (); its simplicity eases erection at the site. It was intended to be used as a railroad bridge.

One example was the Waddell &quot;A&quot; Truss Bridge in Parkville, Missouri.

=== Warren truss ===
The Warren truss was patented in 1848 by James Warren and Willoughby Theobald Monzani, and consists of longitudinal members joined only by angled cross-members, forming alternately inverted equilateral triangle-shaped spaces along its length, ensuring that no individual strut, beam, or tie is subject to bending or torsional straining forces, but only to tension or compression. Loads on the diagonals alternate between compression and tension approaching the center, with no vertical elements, while elements near the center must support both tension and compression in response to live loads. This configuration combines strength with economy of materials and can therefore be relatively light. The girders being of equal length, it is ideal for use in prefabricated modular bridges. It is an improvement over the Neville truss which uses a spacing configuration of isosceles triangles.

=== Whipple truss ===

A Whipple truss, named after its inventor Squire Whipple, is usually considered a subclass of the Pratt truss because the diagonal members are designed to work in tension. The main characteristic of a Whipple truss is that the tension members are elongated, usually thin, and at a shallow angle, and cross two or more bays (rectangular sections defined by the vertical members).

=== Wichert truss ===

The Wichert truss is a modified type of continuous truss which is statically determinate and helps avoid some of the other shortcomings of continuous trusses. It was patented in 1930 by Pittsburgh-based civil engineer Edward Martin Wichert (1883–1955).

The defining feature of this truss type is a hinged kite-shaped section above each intermediate support. Only about ten Wichert truss bridges were ever built, mostly in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Of these, one of the best known is the Homestead Grays Bridge in Pittsburgh.

<text>William Gilbert (20 May 1804 – 3 January 1890) was an English writer and Royal Navy surgeon. He wrote a considerable number of novels, biographies, histories, essays (especially about the dangers of alcohol and the plight of the poor) and popular fantasy stories, mostly in the 1860s and 1870s. Some of these have been reprinted in recent decades and are still available today. He is best remembered, however, as the father of dramatist W. S. Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan.

==Life and career==
Gilbert was born at Bishopstoke, Hampshire, the eldest son of William (1780–1812), a grocer in Commercial Row, Blackfriars, London, and his wife Sarah &quot;née&quot; Mathers (1782–1810). Both his parents died of tuberculosis by the time William was seven years old, and thereafter, he and his younger siblings, Joseph and Jane, were raised in London by their mother&#x27;s sister and her husband, Mary &quot;nee&quot; Mathers (1770–1865) and John Samuel Schwenck (1780–1861), a childless and financially comfortable couple. Gilbert&#x27;s father had also left the children legacies that would be invested by their uncle until the youngest had reached age 21, so Gilbert&#x27;s would not be due to him until age 26. With the three young Gilbert children, the Schwencks soon moved from Lambeth to a larger house in Clapham, where they raised the children with affection.

Gilbert served the East India Company as a midshipman from 1818 (age 14) to 1821 but was unhappy with the conditions, and so he quit the service. He then spent several years in Italy, returning to England about 1825. There he studied at Guy&#x27;s Hospital and served as an assistant surgeon in the navy, and then he entered the Royal College of Surgeons in 1830. At this time, he received his annuity from his father&#x27;s estate, giving him financial independence, and also published a volume of his poetry. He first married Mary Ann Skelton in 1832, who died two years later at around age 20. By this time, he had privately published another book, but after the death of his wife, he published no more for many years. He married Anne Mary Bye Morris (1811–1888), age 24, on 14 February 1836. She was the daughter of Thomas Morris (1760–1849), an apothecary, and Christiana &quot;nee&quot; Sutherland (1777–1845). The couple&#x27;s famous son, W. S. Gilbert, was born on 18 November 1836 at the Morris&#x27;s house in Southampton Street. The Gilberts then moved to Hammersmith, near Anne&#x27;s sister Harriet and her family.

In 1838, Gilbert took his wife and toddler on a long trip to Italy, where he had lived as a young man. There, their daughter Jane Morris Gilbert (1838–1906) was born. In 1841, Gilbert&#x27;s brother and sister, Joseph and Jane, both died of tuberculosis. Gilbert received some property owned by his sister and became a potential co-guardian to Joseph&#x27;s two young sons, together with the Schwencks. In 1843, his daughter Mary Florence (1843–1911) was born. In early 1845, Gilbert decided to take custody of his two young nephews from their mother, Catherine, who had begun a relationship with an officer of the East India Company. She brought a custody lawsuit and her children were returned to her. Amid considerable publicity critical of Gilbert and the Schwencks, Gilbert fled with his young family to Boulogne, France, where his daughter, Anne Maude (1845–1932), was born. The family lived there for two years and returned to London in 1847, moving to Brompton.

Gilbert and Anne &quot;led an increasingly quarrelsome life&quot; in London.

===Early writing career===
Gilbert began his writing career around 1857. He was concerned, throughout his life, with the welfare of the poor and served as honorary secretary of the Society of the Relief of Distress. His interest in the poor is evident in his writing, and one of his recurring themes was that poverty and alcohol, not genealogy, was the major cause of crime and the main factor in one&#x27;s later fortunes. This theme would also be seen in his son&#x27;s writing. One of the elder Gilbert&#x27;s first pieces was a pamphlet entitled, &quot;On the Present System of Rating for the Relief of the Poor in the Metropolis&quot; (1857). In 1858, anonymously, Gilbert published &quot;Dives and Lazarus, or the adventures of an obscure medical man in a low neighbourhood.&quot; The book was a fictional account focusing on what Gilbert saw as the increasing disparity in the lives of the rich and the poor. A similar theme pervades another early Gilbert novel, &quot;The Weaver&#x27;s Family&quot; (1860). This theme continued to concern Gilbert throughout his career including in &quot;Contrasts; dedicated to the ratepayers of London&quot; (1873) and in one of his fiercest attacks on social abuses, &quot;The City; An Inquiry into the Corporation, its livery companies, and the administration of their charities and endowments&quot; (1877), describing how 50,000 working-class people were evicted from their dwellings to make room for the Metropolitan Railway. In an age of male chauvinism, Gilbert also wrote several articles about discrimination against women.

In 1859, Gilbert published a novel, &quot;Margaret Meadows, A Tale for the Pharisees&quot;. This was made into a play called &quot;Mary Warner&quot; by Tom Taylor in 1869, who was forced to pay Gilbert a settlement for plagiarising his novel. Gilbert&#x27;s most successful early novel was &quot;Shirley Hall Asylum: Or the Memoirs of a Monomaniac&quot; (1863), which told the stories of inmates of a lunatic asylum from the point of view of an escapee driven mad by trying to solve the problem of perpetual motion. Gilbert&#x27;s first novel published under his own name was &quot;Christmas Tale: The Rosary, a Legend of Wilton Abbey&quot; (1863). The story purports to be the written confession of one Alicia Longspée, who had been Lady Abbess of the Benedictine Convent at Wilton in the 15th century. Gilbert&#x27;s next novel, &quot;De Profundis, a tale of the social deposits&quot; (1864) is the story of a foundling rescued by a Scottish Fusilier Guardsman stationed in London. The foundling grows up to marry the guardsman&#x27;s daughter. Another 1864 book was &quot;The Goldsworthy Family, or the country attorney&quot;, about an unethical lawyer.

Gilbert&#x27;s 1865 book, &quot;The Magic Mirror&quot; (about a mirror that grants wishes), containing stories with a moral was illustrated by his multi-talented son. Gilbert also wrote histories and articles and stories for numerous periodicals (often anonymously), including &quot;Cornhill&quot;, &quot;Temple Bar&quot;, &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Quiver&quot;, &quot;The Contemporary Review&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Magazine&quot;, &quot;Good Things&quot;, &quot;Good Words&quot;, &quot;Strahan&#x27;s Boy&#x27;s and Girl&#x27;s (sic) Annual&quot; and &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot;.

Among Gilbert&#x27;s best-known, and most popular, works were his &quot;Innominato&quot; tales of the supernatural, published in various magazines, including &quot;Argosy&quot;, and finally collected in &quot;The Wizard of the Mountain&quot; (1867). One of the best-known is &quot;The Last Lords of Gardonal&quot; (1867). These stories concerned the adventures of an enigmatic wizard and astrologer called the Innominato (in English, &quot;Nameless&quot;), in 14th century Italy, who tried to use his powers to help people.

===Later years===
In 1868, Gilbert wrote &quot;The Doctor of Beauweir, an autobiography&quot;, told from the point of view of a South Wales medic. &quot;King George&#x27;s Middy&quot; (1869), also illustrated by W. S. Gilbert, relates the adventures of a Leicestershire squire&#x27;s son who becomes a midshipman and is marooned of the coast of Africa. Another 1869 novel was Sir Thomas Branston. Later that year, Gilbert produced his most famous biography, &quot;Lucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara: a biography: Illustrated by rare and unpublished documents&quot;. In this work, Gilbert concluded, after extensive research, that there was no evidence of the acts of gross immorality of which Borgia was accused, including murder. This was followed in 1870 by &quot;The Inquisitor, or the Struggle in Ferrara&quot;, about the life of Renée of France, Duchess of Ferrara, set in 1554.

In 1871, the novel &quot;Martha&quot; was followed by &quot;The Landlord of the &quot;Sun&quot;&quot;, again describing a descent into degradation, this time involving a villainous seducer, an illegitimate child and drunkenness, and, in 1873, by &quot;Clara Levesque.&quot; Another theme that was seen in Gilbert&#x27;s writings was his dislike of established religion and the Roman Catholic Church in particular. Two works on this theme included &quot;Facta non-Verba: a comparison between the good works performed by the ladies in Roman Catholic convents in England, and the unfettered efforts of their Protestant sisters&quot; (1874) and &quot;Disestablishment from a Church point of view&quot; (1875).

Gilbert had a mercurial temper and was difficult to live with, imposing arbitrary restrictions on his wife and daughters. After many years of strained relations with his wife, Gilbert left home and separated from her in 1876 after forty years of marriage. He left his wife and daughters substantial incomes and the family home, assuming that he would be able to earn a good living from his writing. However, he soon became seriously ill and appeared to be dying, and his doctors advised him not to write. His wife did not assist in his care and did not, ultimately, allow him to return home. Her son appealed to her on his father&#x27;s behalf, but she would not change her mind. W. S. Gilbert apparently never contacted his mother again. Instead, Gilbert went to live with Jane, his only married daughter, and her husband in The Close at Salisbury, where he resided for the rest of his life.

In 1877, Gilbert published &quot;Them Boots&quot;, another description of characters from the lowest class of society, as well as &quot;The City&quot;. Pursuing another favourite theme, the dangers of drink, Gilbert also published in 1877 &quot;Nothing but the Truth, an unvarnished picture of the effects of intemperance&quot;, and example of his many writings about the dangers of alcohol. 1879 saw the publication of &quot;Mrs. Dubosq&#x27;s Bible&quot;, about a French Huguenot group in Spitalfields in the 18th century, and the possession of a 1650 Geneva Bible by a poor person. In 1880, &quot;Memoirs of a Cynic&quot; was a protest against cruelty and hypocrisy. This was followed in 1881 by &quot;Modern Wonders of the World, or the new Sinbad&quot;, a series of 10 stories told to London children by Hassan, the son of an Egyptian slave dealer. His last book, published in 1882, &quot;Legion, or the modern demoniac&quot;, returns to Gilbert&#x27;s campaign against drink, which, he illustrated, leads to &quot;crime, profligacy, suicide, homicide, brutality, cruelty, pauperism, idiocy and insanity.&quot;

Gilbert died at the age of 86 and was buried in The Close at Salisbury.

<doc id="896781" wikidata="Q665413" url="?curid=896781" title="Little Havana">
<text>Little Havana () is a neighborhood of Miami, Florida, United States. Home to many Cuban exiles, as well as many immigrants from Central and South America, Little Havana is named after Havana, the capital and largest city in Cuba.

Little Havana is noted as a center of social, cultural, and political activity in Miami. Its festivals, including the Calle Ocho Festival, Viernes Culturales/Cultural Fridays, the Three Kings Parade and others, have been televised to millions of people every year on different continents. It is also known for its landmarks, including Calle Ocho (SW 8th Street/Tamiami Trail), and its Walk of Fame (for famous artists and Latin personalities, including Celia Cruz, Willy Chirino, Gloria Estefan, Thalía, Julio Iglesias, and Desi Arnaz), the Cuban Memorial Boulevard, Plaza de la Cubanidad, Domino Park, the Tower Theater, José Martí Park, the Firestone/Walgreens Building, St. John Bosco Catholic Church, Municipio de Santiago de Cuba and others.

Máximo Gómez Park, also known as Domino Park is an integral part of Little Havana. Located on the historic Calle Ocho (8th Street) it is a place for Cuban immigrants to gather, drink coffee, smoke cigars, and play dominos. The park has also become a tourist destination, where non-Cubans can engage with immigrants.

Little Havana is the best known Cuban exile neighborhood in the world. It is characterized by its street life, restaurants, music and other cultural activities, small business enterprises, political passion, and great warmth among its residents.

In 2015, Little Havana was included in the National Trust for Historic Preservation&#x27;s annual list of 11 Most Endangered Places. In 2017, the Trust declared it a national treasure.

==History==
===Origins===
Originally a lower-middle-class Southern and thriving Jewish neighborhood in the 1930s, &quot;Little Havana&quot; emerged in the 1960s as the concentration of Cubans in the area grew sharply. Today, &quot;Little Havana&quot; refers to the neighborhood lying immediately west of Downtown Miami, stretching west from the Miami River for roughly two and a half miles. This sobriquet was applied to the Shenandoah and Riverside neighborhoods in the 1960s, following the beginnings of a vast influx of Cuban refugees there. Little Havana is famous as the cultural and political capital of Cuban Americans, and the neighborhood is a center of the Cuban exile community.

===Cuban solidification===

In the 1960s, the number of Cubans fleeing the Castro regime led the area to become a hotbed of counter-revolutionary activity. Arriving residents expected their stay in Miami would be temporary, hoping Castro would be deposed. By 1970, the neighborhood was more than 85% Cuban; rather than return to Havana, where Castro remained in power, Cuban Americans began permanently settling in neighborhoods across Miami. Little Havana, however, remained the main landing point for new immigrants and a stronghold for Cuban-owned businesses.

===Contemporary population===
As of 2011, Little Havana boasts the highest concentration of Hispanics (98%) in Miami. Within the Hispanic population, the Cuban population has experienced a substantial decrease from 84% in 1979 to 58% in 1989; groups of Hispanics from other places, especially Nicaragua, Honduras, and other Central American countries, have substantially increased since the late 1990s. Despite the increasing diversity, most neighborhood businesses are still Cuban-owned.

==Borders==
* Western Border: Southwest 37th Avenue
* Eastern Border: Southwest 3rd Avenue 
* Northern Border: Northwest 7th Street 
* Southern Border: Southwest 22nd Street (Coral Way)

== Demographics ==
As of 2000, Little Havana had a population of 49,206 residents, with 19,341 households, and 11,266 families residing in the neighborhood. The median household income was $15,213.16. The ethnic makeup of the neighborhood was 85.08% Hispanic or Latino of any race (mainly Cubans, but also many Nicaraguans and Honduran Americans, as well as other Latinos), 3.79% Black or African American (not including Afro-Cubans, Afro-Nicaraguans, Afro-Hondurans, and other Afro-Latinos), 10.14% Non-Hispanic White, and 0.96% of other races.

==South River Drive Historic District==

The South River Drive Historic District is a historic district within the City of Miami&#x27;s Little Havana neighborhood. In 1987, the Miami City Commission created the locally designated district. Later that year, the National Park Service added the district to the National Register of Historic Places. Located on the eastern end of the neighborhood along the Miami River, the district is just west of Downtown Miami. The district includes 428, 438 Southwest 1st Street, 437 Southwest 2nd Street, 104, 109, 118 Southwest South River Drive. It contains 9 historic buildings.

The South River Drive Historic District derives its significance from both its architectural and cultural history. Developed principally in the first two decades of the twentieth century, the historic district contains the city&#x27;s oldest extant group of vernacular frame buildings near the Miami River.

==Riverview Historic District==
Designated on April 7, 2015 by the Historic and Environmental Preservation Board, the Riverview Historic District is a city of Miami historic district located west of Downtown Miami within the Little Havana neighborhood.

The locally designated historic district comprises single and multi-family residences and commercial structures in the Bungalow, Mission, Mediterranean Revival, and Miami Modern styles of architecture.

== Viernes Culturales ==
Viernes Culturales (English: &quot;Cultural Fridays&quot;) is an artistic, cultural, and social arts and culture fair that takes place on the last Friday of each month in the historic Little Havana neighborhood of Miami in the heart of Calle Ocho (8th St. SW between 14th and 17th Avenues).

The event consists of outdoor musical performances on a stage and along the sidewalks of Calle Ocho, art exhibits along the sidewalk and in plazas and open spaces, visits to art galleries and cultural centers, cuisine tasting at participating restaurants, and films, art exhibits, and educational programs at the historic Tower Theatre. Free walking tours, led by Miami historian Dr. Paul George leave from the Tower Theater at 7pm during each festival day.

Little Havana hosts its annual Calle Ocho street festival (part of the overall Carnaval Miami celebration), one of the largest in the world, with over one million visitors attending Calle Ocho alone. It is a free street festival with a Caribbean carnival feel sponsored by the Kiwanis Club of Little Havana.

Calle Ocho is where different ethnic communities wear colors or flags representing pride in their heritage. Flags from Colombia to Nicaragua to Puerto Rico to Costa Rica and even Ireland flood the streets. Foods from different countries are usually present for purchase, and popular Latin music like reggaeton, salsa, bachata and merengue can be heard throughout the festival.

In 1977 tensions among Miami&#x27;s different ethnic groups were running high. Eight Cuban-Americans, mostly from the Kiwanis of Little Havana, were trying to come up with ideas to address the situation. They considered a bicycle race on SW Eighth Street (Calle Ocho). It was turned down because the organizers feared that it would pit one ethnic group against another. Willy Bermello came up with the idea of doing something similar to the block parties and street festivals of Philadelphia. Calle Ocho was born.

The festival takes place between 27th Ave and 4th Ave along Southwest 8th Street. Over 30 stages and hundreds of street vendors participate in the live music street festival now in its 4th decade. Calle Ocho earned an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records when 119,986 people formed the world&#x27;s longest conga line on March 13, 1988.

In 2010, the Florida legislature identified the Calle Ocho-Open House 8 festival as the official state festival.

<doc id="896785" wikidata="Q767528" url="?curid=896785" title="Nisyros">
<text>Nisyros also spelled Nisiros (; ) is a volcanic Greek island and municipality located in the Aegean Sea. It is part of the Dodecanese group of islands, situated between the islands of Kos and Tilos.
Its shape is approximately round, with a diameter of about , and an area of . Several other islets are in the direct vicinity of Nisyros, the largest of which is Gyali, with a population of 22 citizens. The Municipality of Nisyros includes Gyalí, as well as uninhabited Pacheiá, Pergoússa, Kandelioussa, Ágios Antónios and Strongýli. It has a total land area of and a total population of 1,048 inhabitants (2021).

== Geology ==

The island has a wide caldera, and was formed within the past 150,000 years, with three separate eruptive stages, ranging from explosive and effusive andesitic eruptions to explosive and effusive dacitic and rhyolitic activity. Its coasts are generally rocky or pebbled, but there are also a few sandy beaches (mainly in the northeastern part). The volcano is currently active but not erupting, and fumaroles are found at the craters. It has had four historical eruptions, all of which had a VEI of 2. Almost all of its eruptions involved phreatic activity. The latest eruptive activity was a steam explosion in 1888, after small ash eruptions in 1871 and 1873, and earthquakes are frequent. A period of seismic unrest in 1996–1997 led an international team of scientists to initiate monitoring of the volcanic unrest, as part of the European Union sponsored Geowarn project. The entire volcanic complex includes the seafloor between Nisyros and Kos, the island of Gyali and a part of Kos island.

== Geography ==

Nisyros can experience the Meltemi Etesian wind through June - August. This is most obvious on the eastern and western flanks of the volcano, where trees are bent towards the south from the force of the winds. The wind may be especially strong on the island due to jet effects as it passes over Kos.

==Climate==
According to the station of the National Observatory of Athens, Nisyros has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;) with mild winters and hot summers. Nisyros has an average annual temperature of around 20.0°C and an average annual precipitation of around 350 mm (May 2017-Mar 2023).

== Geothermal energy ==
Nisyros has one of the most important, high enthalpy, geothermal fields in Greece, with a fluid temperature of over 350°C and a high pressure of 18bar, while, based on feasibility studies, the geothermal potential of the island is at least 50MW.

Over time, efforts have been made by the operator, PPC Renewables, to exploit geothermal energy in the area for energy production. 

The most recent plan was to gradually create and operate a geothermal plant with a capacity of 20 to 25MW in cooperation with international specialized institutions. Given the estimated energy needs of Nisyros (1–2MW), it was considered possible to supply electricity to the neighbouring islands of Kos, Tilos, Kalymnos, and Leros. However, long-lasting protests by the local community of Nisyros have blocked any plans to exploit the geothermal field for years. Indeed, in 1997 the Municipality of Nisyros held a referendum on the issue, with the result being 87% against the plans of the PPC.

Entities of Nisyros, such as the Nisyros Studies Company, some municipal authorities, and many scientists of the sector, have expressed their objections to the plans of PPC Renewables, raising safety issues due to the particular danger of the volcano of Nisyros, the seismic activity that often follows similar drilling, and the management of toxic waste. A point of friction was the fact that the local community felt that it had been ignored in the decision-making process and in the planning of the project.

== Settlements ==
The island is reachable by ship from Piraeus, Rhodes and Kos, and in summer, there are many daily trips from the village of Kardamena on Kos. There is also a heliport. The main town and port of the island is Mandraki (pop. 660). Other villages are Paloi (239), Nikia (61), and Emporeios (27). According to the 2011 census, the municipality&#x27;s resident population is 1,008 (including 21 on Gyali), although in summer it is augmented by many tourists as well as expatriate Nisyrians who visit the island for their vacations. Tourism is not so heavily developed as on other Greek islands. Deposits of perlite and pumice on Gyali provide much of the wealth of the island. The island used to be self-sufficient, and many crops were grown on its terraced slopes. Today, though, they are cultivated on a smaller scale.

== History ==
According to Greek mythology, the island was formed when Poseidon cut off a part of Kos and threw it onto the giant Polybotes to stop him from escaping. The ancient name of the Nisyros was &quot;Porphyris&quot;. Ancient walls, dating from the 5th century BC, part of the acropolis of the island, are found near Mandraki.

It was apparently also a source of millstones used in some of the earliest watermills, being referred to by epigrammatist Antipater of Thessalonica in the 1st century BC.

The island is mentioned by Homer in the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

In Roman times it became part of the Insulae province.

Between X-XI centuries, Genoese captains and adventurers who had a private fleet organized in clans united by family ties, exercised sovereignty and maritime control on behalf of the Byzantines, and these clans in exchange for the protection of the seas were given a concession to exploit raw materials, rights of trade and collection of customs duties.

The Knights Hospitaller in 1315 were allowed to settle on the island upon payment of rent to Genoese government ruled by the Vignolo family, and they built the crusader castle.

In the following centuries there were clashes between Turks and Venetian crusaders, and with uncertain outcomes the island passed to the Ottomans in 1566; then passed almost 4 centuries later from the Ottomans to the Italians in 1911 during the Italo-Turkish War, along with the rest of the Dodecanese islands. It finally was annexed to the Greek Kingdom after the Second World War, in 1947.

== Christianity ==
The patron saint of the island is New Martyr Niketas of Nisyros. Many Orthodox Christian churches are found on the island, as well as four monasteries which are not inhabited by monks today, although various celebrations take place in them. The largest monastery is the one of &quot;Panagia Spiliani&quot; (Blessed Virgin Mary of the cave) at Mandraki; it is built beside the medieval castle erected by the Knights Hospitaller.

===Diocese of Nisyrus===
Nisyrus was a suffragan of Rhodes, but the bishopric faded. Known bishops included Matthaeus de Cheselles (appointed 1436), Pierre Fridaricus (served from the 1480s), Pedro Xague (appointed 1560), and Jerónimo Clavijo (appointed 1564).

=== Latin titular see ===
The diocese was nominally restored in 1927 as Titular See of the lowest (Episcopal) rank, initially named Nysirus (Curiate Italian Nisiro), and renamed Nisyrus in 1928.

It has been vacant for decades, having had the following incumbents:
* Francesco Fellinger (26 February 1929 – 22 July 1940)
* Augusto Osvaldo Salinas Fuenzalida, Picpus Fathers (SS.CC.) (9 February 1941 – 3 August 1950)
* Elizeu Simões Mendes (21 August 1950 – 19 September 1953)
* Carlos Maria Jurgens Byrne, Redemptorists (C.SS.R.) (7 February 1954 – 17 December 1956) (later Archbishop)
* Augusto Trujillo Arango (25 April 1957 – 31 March 1960) (later Archbishop)
* Auguste Joseph Gaudel (1 September 1960 – 8 August 1969)

== Culture ==
A traditional product of Nisyros is &quot;soumada&quot;, a non-alcoholic almond-flavoured drink.

== Twinning ==
Mandraki is twinned with the following municipalities:
* Lapithos, Cyprus

== Notable natives and residents ==
* John Catsimatidis, New York City owner of Gristedes

<doc id="896792" wikidata="Q1095699" url="?curid=896792" title="Clark Gillies">
<text>Clark Gillies (April 7, 1954 – January 21, 2022) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He played for the New York Islanders and Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League between 1974 and 1988. Gillies served as captain of the Islanders from 1977 to 1979, and won the Stanley Cup four years in a row with them, from 1980 to 1983. In 958 career games, Gillies recorded 319 goals, 378 assists, and 1,023 penalty minutes. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Early life==
Gillies grew up in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Once asked where his hometown is located, he famously joked, &quot;Six feet from the moose&#x27;s ass.&quot; Gillies started skating at around the age of four. His father insisted that Clark learn to skate and keep his balance before allowing him to bring a hockey stick onto the ice. He began playing ice hockey casually at the age of six and in organized leagues at the age of seven. He played with a local team in Moose Jaw until it ceased operation. As one of the bigger players on the ice, he was often engaged in fights with players on other teams, which he felt added to the fun of playing.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Gillies&#x27; first professional sports experience was in baseball. In 1970, at 16, Gillies signed with the Houston Astros and played three years of minor league baseball in Covington, Virginia. He hit .241 in 86 games as a catcher/first baseman. He platooned at first base in 1972 with future Islander teammate Bob Bourne. Gillies suffered from homesickness and continued to play hockey during the off season. He eventually moved on to play in the Western Canada Hockey League with the Regina Pats. The Pats had been scouting another player at the time, but were impressed by Gillies, who was a bigger player for the era (he would be listed at and ). During his tenure with the Pats, Gillies accrued 570 penalty minutes in 201 games. In 1974, his final season for Regina, Gillies had 46 goals and 66 assists, was named to the league&#x27;s First All-Star team, and the team won the 1974 Memorial Cup as Canadian major junior hockey champions.

===Professional career===
Gillies was the fourth overall selection in the first round of the 1974 NHL Amateur Draft by the New York Islanders. He was also picked by the World Hockey Association&#x27;s Edmonton Oilers in the WHA draft, but signed with the Islanders, making the team out of training camp. It was during his rookie season of 1974–75, in the playoffs, that Gillies established himself as one of the toughest players in the National Hockey League (NHL) when beating up enforcer Dave Schultz.

In the latter half of the 1976–77 season, Gillies was named team captain; however, in spite of Gillies&#x27; articulate speaking manner and amiable nature, he never felt completely comfortable as captain. Gillies captained the Islanders through two disappointing seasons, in part because the Islanders appeared to lack team toughness. During the pre-season of 1979–80 Gillies allowed Denis Potvin to take over as captain.

During the 1980 playoffs, Gillies got the best of Terry O&#x27;Reilly, one of the Boston Bruins&#x27; toughest players, several times, helping to fuel the Islanders&#x27; drive to the Stanley Cup. Gillies was used during this series as the Islanders&#x27; chief protector and enforcer, and in taking on this role, Gillies allowed his team to battle through a violent series with the Bruins. Gillies, now totally comfortable with his role with the team, flourished individually and collectively, as the Islanders won the Stanley Cup in four consecutive years, from 1980 to 1983, during Gillies&#x27; tenure.

Gillies scored over 30 goals for four straight seasons (starting in 1975–76) as part of the &quot;Trio Grande&quot;, the Islanders&#x27; top forward line with Mike Bossy and Bryan Trottier, and again in 1980–81 and 1981–82. In 1977 he finished tenth in the voting for the Hart Trophy for most valuable player in the NHL. In 1978 and 1979 he led all left-wingers for most votes for the All-Star game, and was named to the NHL First All-Star Team as a left-winger at the conclusion of these two seasons. In 1981, he played for the Canadian national team in the Canada Cup, scoring seven points in seven games.

After scoring only four goals in 55 games in 1985–86, Gillies was left unprotected in the NHL waiver draft, and was claimed by the Buffalo Sabres. While wearing number 39 in Buffalo, Gillies retired after playing a season and a half with the Sabres. On December 7, 1996, Gillies&#x27; No. 9 was retired by the Islanders.

Gillies was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2002. Although his overall statistics were respectable but not considered Hall of Fame caliber, his role as an aggressive playmaker (power forward) was key for Trio Grande linemates Bossy and Trottier to thrive, as was his clutch scoring ability (54 game-winning goals).

He was also inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal life and death==
Gillies&#x27; nickname, &quot;Jethro&quot;, came from teammate Ed Westfall, based on the character Jethro Bodine in the TV series &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

When Gillies, per tradition, got to have the Stanley Cup with him for 24 hours after the Islanders won it for the first time in 1980, he let his dog, a German shepherd, eat from it. &quot;Why not?&quot; he responded to critics. &quot;He&#x27;s a good dog.&quot;

Gillies, who was honoured by the Islanders on December 13, 2014, remained active in the Long Island community. He was a business development manager at Protective Wealth Consultants in Huntington, New York. He played in 30 to 40 charity softball games per year. He was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Hockey Category with the Class of 1998.

He was married to Pam, who is also from Moose Jaw. They lived in Greenlawn, New York. His son-in-law, Justin Bourne, is the son of his former teammate Bob Bourne, and worked as an assistant coach of the Toronto Marlies. His nephew, Colton Gillies, played in the NHL between 2008 and 2013. He was not related to Trevor Gillies, who also played for the Islanders.

Gillies died of cancer at his residence in Greenlawn on January 21, 2022, at the age of 67.

<doc id="896795" wikidata="Q16983161" url="?curid=896795" title="Washington and Lee Mock Convention">
<text>Washington and Lee Mock Convention is a simulated presidential nominating convention and is held every four years, during the early stages of the U.S. Presidential Primary, at Washington and Lee University. Although Oberlin College has the distinction of having the oldest student-run mock political convention in the country, W&amp;L&#x27;s convention has the reputation for being the most accurate. It often receives gavel-to-gavel coverage on C-SPAN.

The convention simulates the nomination process for whichever party does not currently hold the presidency. Since its inception in 1908, the student body has been correct 21 out of 28 times, with only three incorrect predictions since 1948. Since 1948, they have never incorrectly predicted the Republican nominee for president.

The 2008 Mock Convention projected Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee for that election year. The Mock Convention was mistaken, however, as Barack Obama was eventually elected as the nominee. The 2012 Mock Convention projected Mitt Romney as the Republican nominee. In 2016, the Mock Convention projected Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee on the first ballot. In 2020, the Washington and Lee Mock Convention predicted incorrectly again, predicting Bernie Sanders would win the nomination, after his early victory in New Hampshire. Sanders dropped out of the race in April 2020, and Vice President Joe Biden would go on to win the nomination and the election. In 2024, which was again a Republican mock convention, the Mock Convention again correctly predicted that Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee; Trump would go on to be elected to his second term in November 2024.

==Organization history==

In the spring of 1908, William Jennings Bryan, a front-runner for the Democratic presidential candidacy, announced a visit to Lexington, Virginia, arousing interest in Washington and Lee&#x27;s already political-minded campus. To capitalize on the furor, The Forum, W&amp;L&#x27;s leading political organization at the time, organized a replica of the upcoming Democratic Convention. The event was an enormous success, owing to the highly political student body: according to the Lexington Gazette, &quot;The young gentlemen entered into the meeting with the zest of seasoned politicians plus the enthusiasm of collegians&quot;. After fierce (and occasionally chaotic) debate, the campus correctly predicted Bryan to be the 1908 Democratic nominee.
With the exception of the 1920 and 1944 elections, the Mock Convention has occurred every four years since the original 1908 election. The state delegations are known to go to great lengths for accuracy: the 1952 state chair for California, David Constine, developed a correspondence with California Governor Earl Warren, one of the leading candidates. As it rose in prominence, the convention gathered an impressive docket of speakers, including Harry S. Truman and former Vice President Alben W. Barkley. Delivering the April 30, 1956 keynote address in Doremus Gymnasium, broadcast live on the radio, then-Sen. Barkley, vice president during President Truman&#x27;s 1949-53 term, who had been reelected to the Senate in 1954 without seniority as Kentucky&#x27;s junior senator after having previously served as Majority Leader, was good-naturedly recounting this rise and fall from lowly congressman to senator to Leader to President of the Senate as vice president to return backbencher when he suddenly collapsed from a heart attack and died, his last words, paraphrased from Psalm 84:10: &quot;I would rather be a servant in the house of the Lord than to sit in the seats of the mighty!&quot; Since then, the motto of Mock Convention has been a slight alteration of these last words, &quot;It is better to be of service than to sit in the seats of the mighty.&quot;

In addition to the convention itself, W&amp;L hosts a large number of formal and informal celebrations in honor of the Convention and its honored guests, including parades, parties, and balls. These events have seen some of the Convention&#x27;s most famous stories. In 1972, then-governor Jimmy Carter&#x27;s speech at Mock Con was missed by his own press secretary, who had been celebrating with a group of W&amp;L students and alumni. Before his famous MTV appearance, Bill Clinton played an impromptu concert for students at an off-campus party for the 1988 Convention. By 1996, the Mock Convention was acknowledged by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious mock conventions.&quot;

<text>The Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic (BNR; , ), also known as the Belarusian Democratic Republic, was a state proclaimed by the Council of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in its Second Constituent Charter on 9 March 1918 during World War I. The Council proclaimed the Belarusian Democratic Republic independent in its Third Constituent Charter on 25 March 1918 during the occupation of contemporary Belarus by the Imperial German Army.

The government of the Belarusian Democratic Republic never had power over the whole territory of Belarus. In 1919, it co-existed with an alternative Soviet Russia-controlled Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia (which later became part of the Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic), moving its seat of government to Vilnius and Hrodna, but ceased to exist due to the partition of the whole Belarusian territory between the Bolshevik Red Army and the Polish Armed Forces as a result of the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921.

Currently, its government in exile, the Rada (Council) of the Belarusian Democratic Republic is the oldest still functioning government in exile.

== Name ==
In some historical documents, the &quot;White Ruthenian Democratic Republic&quot; phrase was used initially. In the current scholarship, &quot;Belarusian Democratic Republic&quot; and &quot;Belarusian National Republic&quot; names dominate. The Rada BNR uses the &quot;Belarusian Democratic Republic&quot; name. It also appears in the publications originating in Belarus. The &quot;Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic&quot; appears in publications, however, its use is comparatively limited, e.g. it does not appear in the titles of scholarly publications.

== History ==
After the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, active discussions started in Belarus about either gaining autonomy within the new Russian Republic or declaring independence. Deputies of most Belarusian regions and of different political powers, including the Belarusian Socialist Assembly, the Christian democratic movement and the General Jewish Labour Bund, formed a Belarusian National Council in late 1917. The Council started working on establishing Belarusian governmental institutions. Both the Bolsheviks and Germans refused to recognize it and interfered in its activity. However, the Germans saw an independent Belarus as part of the implementation of their plan for buffer states within Mitteleuropa. The Bolsheviks had negotiations with the Belarusian Democratic Republic regarding eventual recognition, but later decided instead to establish a pro-Soviet government of Belarus – the Soviet Socialist Republic of Byelorussia.

Parallel with negotiations that started between the Germans and Bolsheviks, the Belarusian Council started actively demanding recognition of autonomous status for Belarus, with continuing internal discussions on whether it should become an autonomous region within Russia or declare national independence.

On 21 February 1918, the German army captured Minsk. On the same day, the Belarusian Council passed the First Constituent Charter declaring the council the only legitimate power on the territory of Belarus. Neither the occupying authorities, nor its government in Berlin, however, were interested in the idea of an independent Belarusian state.

On 3 March, Germans and Bolsheviks signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. On 6 March, the Belarusian Council passed the Second Charter declared the establishment of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic. The Council became the provisional government of Belarus and was renamed the Council of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic.

On March 25, 1918, the All-Belarusian Congress proclaimed the independence of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic (Bielaruskaja Narodnaja Respublika, abbreviated as BNR). As the German army retreated, the Government of the BNR left Minsk in December 1918 for the Lithuanian Republic, and in the spring of 1919 went into exile.

===Territory===
In its Third Constituent Charter, the following territories were claimed for BNR: Mogilev Governorate (province), as well as Belarusian parts of Minsk Governorate, Grodno Governorate (including Belastok), Vilna Governorate, Vitebsk Governorate, and Smolensk Governorate, and parts of bordering governorates populated by Belarusians, rejecting the then split of the Belarusian lands between Germany and Russia. The areas were claimed because of a Belarusian majority or large minority (as in Grodno and Vilna Governorate), although there were also numbers of Lithuanians, Poles and people speaking mixed varieties of Belarusian, Lithuanian and Polish, as well as many Jews, mostly in towns and cities (in some towns they made up a majority). Some of the Jews spoke Russian as their native tongue; others spoke Yiddish.

===Military===

There were attempts to create an armed forces of the newly established Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic. Belarusian military units started to form within the disorganized Imperial Russian Army already in 1917.

According to the historian Oleg Latyszonek, about 11,000 people, mostly volunteers, served in the Army of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic.

General Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz supported the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic and openly positioned his army as a Belarusian national army. In 1920, his units became a part of the led by the Russian SR revolutionary Boris Savinkov which established the short-lived during its actions against the Red Army. 

The major military action of the Army of the People&#x27;s Republic was the failed Slutsk defence action in late 1920. The Council of the BNR, based at that time in Lithuania, sent officers to help organize armed anti-Bolshevik resistance in the town of Slutsk. These events formed the basis of Vasil Bykau&#x27;s story and the film based on it &quot;On Black Slash-and-Burn Fields&quot;.

===Foreign relations===

During its short existence, the government of Belarus established close ties with the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, organized food supplies to Belarus from Ukraine and thereby prevented hunger in the country.

Beginning in 1918, Anton Łuckievič, the prime minister of Belarus, met with Vladimir Lenin hoping to gain recognition for the independence of Belarus by Soviet Russia. The Belarusian delegation even proposed the creation of a federation with the RSFSR and the adoption of the Soviet Constitution in Belarus in exchange for Russia recognizing the independent status of Belarus, but Lenin did not agree to these proposals.

In 1919, a delegation of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic under Prime Minister Anton Łuckievič participated in the Paris Peace Conference, attempting to gain international recognition of the independence of Belarus. On the way to the conference, the delegation was received by Czechoslovak president Tomáš Masaryk in Prague. During the conference, Łuckievič had meetings with the exiled foreign minister of Admiral Kolchak&#x27;s Russian government Sergey Sazonov and the prime minister of Poland Ignacy Jan Paderewski.

In October 1919 the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic was officially recognized by Estonia and in December 1919 by Finland. On November 11, 1920, the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic signed a treaty with the government of Lithuania in which both states declared to recognize each other and to cooperate together.

===Other actions===
The government also managed to create between 150 and 350 schools and preparations for the creation of a university in Minsk were initiated.

==Exile==

In December 1918, the German army retreated from the territory of Belarus and the Red Army moved in to establish the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia. The Rada (Council) of the BNR moved to Hrodna, the center of a semi-autonomous Belarusian region within the Republic of Lithuania. During the subsequent 1919–1920 Soviet-Polish War, the Rada went into exile and facilitated an anti-Communist struggle within the country during the 1920s.

In 1925, the exiled Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic (Rada BDR) discussed relinquishing its authority in favor of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic controlling the eastern part of Belarus. Despite many members of the democratic government advocating this idea, the proposal was not approved.

During World War II, the Belarusian government-in-exile, based in Prague, refused to cooperate with Nazi Germany or with the Belarusian Central Rada, the pro-German puppet government and issued statements in support of the Western Allies.

The advance of the Red Army in 1945 forced the BNR&#x27;s Rada to relocate to the western part of Germany, occupied by British and American troops. In February 1948, the Rada passed a special manifesto, by which it declared its return to activity. In April 1948, the Rada, together with deputies of the Belarusian post-war refugees, held a conference in Osterhofen, Bavaria.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, similar governments-in-exile of the neighboring countries (Lithuania, Poland and others) handed back their mandates to the corresponding independent governments.

Upon declaration of independence of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1990, it was stated then that the Rada was ready to hand its status to a democratically elected parliament of Belarus. The parliament of Belarus of that time had been elected under Soviet rule. However, these plans were dropped after president Alexander Lukashenko, elected in the 1994 presidential election, established an authoritarian regime accompanied by a return to Soviet policies in regards to Belarusian language and culture.

The Rada BNR still exists as a government in exile and attempts to lobby for interests of the Belarusian diaspora in countries where it has its deputies.

Since the late 1980s, March 25, the Independence Day of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, is widely celebrated by the Belarusian national democratic opposition as &quot;Freedom Day&quot; (). It is usually accompanied by mass opposition rallies in Minsk and by celebration events of the Belarusian diaspora organizations supporting the Belarusian government in exile.

==Symbols==

A national flag of three stripes – white-red-white – was adopted, as well as a state seal (Pahonia) based on an emblem of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

==Presidents==
Chairpersons of the Council of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic:
* Jan Sierada (1918)
* Jazep Losik (1918–1919; acting)
* Piotra Krečeŭski (1919–1928)
* Vasil Zacharka (1928–1943)
* Mikoła Abramčyk (1944–1970)
* Vincent Žuk-Hryškievič (1970–1980)
* Jazep Sažyč (1980–1997)
* Ivonka Survilla (1997–present)

==Archives==
In 1998, Belarusian linguist and translator published a two-volume collection of BNR archives (&quot;Архівы Беларускай Народнай Рэспублікі. Менск-Вільня-Прага-Нью-Ёрк&quot;). The total size of the two volumes is more than 1700 pages. Essentially these are the processed and re-organized documents from the Lithuanian archival fund #582 in Vilnius and they constitute roughly 60% of all the BNR official documents from 1918. Another 20% of BNR official documentation is located in the Minsk archives, and the fate of the remaining 20% is unknown.

<text>The Caldecott Tunnel is a four-bore highway tunnel through the Berkeley Hills between Oakland and Orinda, California. Its four bores carry California State Route 24. Named after Thomas E. Caldecott, former mayor of Berkeley, it opened in 1937 as a two-bore tunnel. The third bore opened in 1964 and the fourth bore in 2013. Currently, the two oldest bores carry eastbound traffic and the two newest bores carry westbound traffic.

==Description==
The east–west tunnel is signed as a part of California State Route 24 and connects Oakland to central Contra Costa County. It is named after Thomas E. Caldecott (1878–1951), who was mayor of Berkeley in 1930–1932, a member of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors in 1933–1945, and president of Joint Highway District 13, which built the first two bores.

Bore 1 (the southernmost bore) and Bore 2 were completed in 1937; they are in length and today carry two lanes each of eastbound traffic. Bore 3, completed in 1964, is in length. Bore 4 (the northernmost bore), completed in 2013, is in length. Bores 3 and 4 carry two lanes each of westbound traffic.

The active Hayward Fault runs just west of the western portals of the tunnel.

==History==

In the 19th century, traffic over the Berkeley Hills in this area went up Harwood Canyon, now known as Claremont Canyon (behind the Claremont Hotel). The road leading up the canyon from the west was initially called Harwood&#x27;s Road, later changed to Telegraph Road, and finally, Claremont. The road on the other side of the hills became known as Fish Ranch Road, its current name, some time after 1870, the year the Oakland Trout Company incorporated its fish and frog farm in the vicinity. An inn and stage coach stop called the Summit House once existed at the summit.

The idea of a tunnel through the hills began as early as 1860. In that year, the idea was proposed and rejected by the citizens of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. It was revived in 1871 in a private attempt led by L.W. Kennedy which however failed after boring about 200 feet into the hills from the east side of the hills above the location of today&#x27;s Caldecott Tunnel when water was struck, washing out the work. Bankruptcy followed and the effort, which came to be known as the &quot;old Kennedy tunnel&quot; was abandoned. A franchise was subsequently granted to a group of developers who passed the franchise onto another group. The proposal languished until the turn of the century.

Just before the end of the 19th century, the tunnel idea was revived and discussed by business and government representatives of Contra Costa and Alameda Counties. These discussions led to a new tunnel construction project at the approximate location of the old Kennedy tunnel attempt. The work on the Contra Costa side proceeded based on the old tunnel alignment while work on the Alameda County side started from the top of Temescal Canyon. On the west side, the project involved the construction of a proper approach road. The new road, dubbed &quot;Tunnel Road&quot;, was built from the top of Russell Street in Berkeley (later realigned with Ashby Avenue) at the foot of Claremont Canyon and ran around the spur separating that canyon from Temescal Canyon, climbing along the slope of the spur to the summit of the Berkeley Hills until it reached the west portal of the new tunnel. The west end of the tunnel was at about while the east end of the tunnel is now in private property owned by the East Bay Regional Park District, on the former site of the Canary Cafe. 

The tunnel was dedicated on November 4, 1903 as the &quot;Inter-County Tunnel&quot;. A system of lighting a small fire with a newspaper was used to control this one-way traffic. The tunnel height was increased in 1915 by 3 feet to accommodate larger vehicles. After the new Broadway (Caldecott) tunnel was opened at the end of 1937, the old tunnel was used mostly by pedestrians until it was sealed in 1947.

===Original twin bores===
In November 1926, the Counties of Alameda and Contra Costa, and the City of Oakland agreed to the construction of a new tunnel through the Berkeley Hills to replace the old, small, decrepit and increasingly inadequate existing tunnel. In 1929, Alameda and Contra Costa County formed Joint Highway District 13 to accomplish this goal. Surveys and preliminary work on the approaches began in 1931.

On June 17, 1934, construction of the first two bores of the Caldecott Tunnel began.

The project included an extension of Broadway from its existing termination point below the hills some two miles from the planned west portal of the new tunnel. This required some major earth-moving efforts, both cutting and filling as well as buttressing, especially up in Temescal Canyon. This included filling in one of the inlets of Lake Temescal as well as part of the upper canyon where Broadway was to run.

The entire project was completed in 1937, and the tunnel opened to traffic on December 5 of that year. The tunnel was named the Broadway Low Level Tunnel (commonly shortened to Broadway Tunnel), since the principal through access was from Broadway in Oakland, and was located below the portal of the old Inter County Tunnel. However, access from Ashby Avenue was retained as it was designated the connecting thoroughfare from the Eastshore Highway (re-engineered as a freeway in the mid 1950s) and the new San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, and dubbed State Highway 24. The approach to the east portal on the other side of the Berkeley Hills was via Mount Diablo Boulevard, also at that time part of State Highway 24.

In 1960, the Broadway Low Level Tunnel was renamed, becoming the Caldecott Tunnel.

===Third bore and traffic reversal===

By 1960, the Division of Highways had rebuilt the eastern approach to the tunnel into a freeway. With Contra Costa County accessible by freeway, its change from an agricultural community into a major suburb accelerated.

The Division of Highways purchased sufficient right-of-way to the north of the existing twin bores to build another pair of bores. Given the traffic counts and the expense of tunnel construction, the construction of two additional bores would have been seen as unnecessary and extravagant. However, with the traffic count exceeding 50,000 vehicles per day, the state embarked on a project to build a third bore at the Caldecott Tunnel.

The project broke ground in 1960 and was opened to traffic in October 1964. When the third bore was opened, the other bores were closed one at a time for maintenance, including the installation of a continuous row of fluorescent lights. The new third bore made it possible to provide four lanes to accommodate the heavier commute-direction traffic by reversing the traffic flow of the middle bore.

The third bore also brought new technology to the tunnel with the installation of the &quot;pop-up&quot; lane control. Plastic lane delineators were set in tubes within the pavement. With the touch of a button, water would fill tubes to cause the delineators to pop up from the pavement; the middle bore was closed to one direction of travel, while opening it to another. During the week, the middle bore of the Caldecott was reversed between 2:00 am and 5:00 am to favor westbound traffic, and then switched again sometime between 11:30 am and noon to favor eastbound traffic. Ballgames, concerts and other events made balancing weekend traffic through the tunnel very difficult. It was not uncommon to reverse the middle bore six times on a Saturday or Sunday. The pop-up system still required substantial manpower to implement. While it did eliminate the need to set down individual cones to separate traffic, Caltrans maintenance workers had to direct traffic out of the closing lanes to prevent vehicles from getting caught on the wrong side of the pop-up delineators.

A portion of the material excavated for the third bore was used in the construction of embankments for the MacArthur Freeway project between the MacArthur Maze and Broadway in Oakland.

In the late 1960s, the Grove-Shafter Freeway was completed and replaced Broadway as the main route to the Caldecott Tunnel from Oakland as well as replacing Ashby for traffic coming from San Francisco. Ashby Avenue and Tunnel Road were redesignated State Highway 13 and aligned with the new Warren Freeway through the Montclair District of Oakland. The Grove-Shafter Freeway was then designated State Highway 24. In 1980, the freeway was renamed after William Byron Rumford.

===Tunnel fire===

On April 7, 1982, an accident involving a gasoline tanker truck in the third (then-northernmost) bore set off the Caldecott Tunnel fire. The accident caused major damage and the bore was closed to traffic for several months while repairs were made, with traffic temporarily reverting to the pre-third-bore configuration. During the fire, the tunnel acted as a natural chimney, venting the smoke, flames and heat uphill towards the eastern entrance to the tunnel. The accident and fire killed seven people, most of whom were overcome by toxic smoke. The fire occurred shortly after midnight when there were few cars in the tunnel; had it occurred during normal commute hours, hundreds could have died. As a result of the fire, it is now illegal to transport hazardous material in a tanker truck through the tunnel, except between the light-traffic hours of 3:00 am and 5:00 am.

===Oakland firestorm===
On October 20, 1991, the catastrophic Oakland firestorm started on the ridge north of the Caldecott Tunnel. The fire spread quickly west down both sides of the west portal of the tunnel and jumped from the East to the West side of highway 13, eventually killing 25 people and destroying over 3,000 homes, apartments and condominiums.

===Awards===
The Caldecott Tunnel was designated a City of Oakland Landmark in 1980, and received a Preservation Award from the Art Deco Society of California in 1993.

===Fourth bore===
To relieve traffic congestion in the reverse commute direction, the California Department of Transportation began planning for a fourth bore in 2000. In 2007, the California Transportation Commission approved the final funding needed to build the fourth bore. Construction started in 2010. Commencement of the project was stalled as a result of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, but was quickly back on track as a beneficiary of President Obama&#x27;s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Construction got underway until completion in 2013. Much of the excavated material from the bore was trucked to Treasure Island for use in soil augmentation and remediation during the subsequent redevelopment of the island.

The fourth bore contains a roadway with two traffic lanes, one shoulder, and one shoulder, ventilation, air and traffic monitoring systems, traffic lights, and electronic message boards. There are emergency exits to the third bore. When the fourth bore was opened to traffic, the need for the daily traffic reversal was eliminated; two bores (four lanes) serve each direction at all times, although individual bores may be closed during periods of light use for maintenance purposes.

==Weather phenomena==

Weather conditions can vary greatly from one end of the tunnel to the other. In summer, for example, motorists may enter the tunnel from the east where it is sunny and warm, and emerge on the west end into fog and cold. In winter, during spells of inland tule fog, the reverse can occur.

==In popular culture==
*The Caldecott Tunnel appears in many of Rick Riordan&#x27;s books, acting as an entrance to Camp Jupiter. In &quot;The Tyrant&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, it is the site of the final battle between the protagonists Apollo and Frank Zhang and the Roman emperors Commodus and Caligula.

<doc id="896809" wikidata="Q3124586" url="?curid=896809" title="Peter Wright (MI5 officer)">
<text>Peter Maurice Wright CBE (9 August 191626 April 1995) was a principal scientific officer for MI5, the British counter-intelligence agency. His book &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, written with Paul Greengrass, became an international bestseller with sales of over two million copies. &quot;Spycatcher&quot; was part memoir, part exposé detailing what Wright claimed were serious institutional failures he investigated within MI5. Wright is said to have been influenced in his counterespionage activity by James Jesus Angleton, counter-intelligence chief of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1954 to 1975.

==Early life==
Peter Wright was born at 26 Cromwell Road, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the son of (George) Maurice Wright CBE, director of research for the Marconi Company, who was one of the founders of signals intelligence during the First World War. Wright was educated at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford College, an independent boarding school for boys in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Hertfordshire, and St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford. 

==Career==

Wright graduated shortly before the Second World War and soon followed in his father’s footsteps, taking a job at the Admiralty&#x27;s Research Laboratory. He remained there throughout the war and in 1946 began work as a Principal Scientific Officer at the Services Electronics Research Laboratory.

According to his own account, Wright’s work for MI5, initially part-time, started in the spring of 1949 when he was given a job as a Navy Scientist attached to the Marconi Company. According to &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, during his stint there, Wright was instrumental in resolving a difficult technical problem. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) sought Marconi&#x27;s assistance with a covert listening device (or &quot;bug&quot;) that had been found in a replica of the Great Seal of the United States presented to the United States ambassador in Moscow in 1945 by the Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union. Wright determined that the bugging device, dubbed The Thing, was actually a tiny capacitive membrane (a condenser microphone) that became active only when 330 MHz microwaves were beamed to it from a remote transmitter. A remote receiver could then have been used to decode the modulated microwave signal and permit sounds picked up by the microphone to be heard. The device was eventually attributed to the Soviet inventor Léon Theremin.

==Intelligence career highlights==
In 1954, Wright was recruited as principal scientific officer for MI5. According to his memoirs, he then was either responsible for, or intimately involved with, the development of some of the basic methods of ELINT, for example:

* Operation ENGULF (MI5): acoustic cryptanalysis—recording the sound of the settings of Egyptian Hagelin cipher machines in 1956.
* Operation RAFTER (MI5): remote detection of passive radio receivers used by Soviet illegals through detecting emanations from the local oscillator, in 1958 (a technique now more commonly used to enforce payment of television licences). The program eventually expanded into airborne operations, where receivers were detected from transport planes, thus giving the general area where mobile ground detection could be initiated. This was done by flooding the vicinity with vans that at best could pinpoint buildings or blocks. However, the method was less successful against mobile receivers.
* Operation STOCKADE (MI5/GCHQ): analysis of compromising emanation from French cipher machine cables in 1960. They used broad band radio detection of the cables, and were actually able to read the original plain text along the low-grade cipher sequence. Surprisingly, murmurs of high-grade ciphers could sometimes be read from the same cable, which after comparison to the cable fed signal, gave a path to even that cipher&#x27;s plain text leakage. From 1960 to 1963 the MI5 and GCHQ could read cipher traffic to and from the French embassy in London.

Wright worked as the first chairman of the new Radio Operations Committee (ROC) when it was formed in 1960. The technical staffs from the earlier separate and competitive British intelligence organizations finally began to combine their efforts, thus allowing the methods used in ENGULF and RAFTER to be expanded into domestic and foreign intelligence operations that would last into the late 1960s. According to Wright, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ had not functioned together or shared information as effectively since the war.

In 1964, Wright became chairman of a joint MI5/MI6 committee, codenamed FLUENCY Working Party, appointed to find Soviet agents and moles in Britain. For six years beginning in 1964 he regularly interviewed Anthony Blunt, a member of the Cambridge Five, trying to glean more information from him about other Soviet agents.

==Claims about Roger Hollis, the Wilson Plot et al.==

While serving in MI5, Wright became aware that, since the 1930s, Soviet espionage agencies had been infiltrating the British government’s military and education establishments with the help of close-knit left-wing homosexual circles at Oxford and Cambridge, especially the Cambridge Apostles. With like-minded MI5 officers, Wright became alert to the fact that some senior figures in the intelligence services, in politics, and in the trade unions had been recruited long ago as Soviet agents.

After Soviet spy Kim Philby&#x27;s defection to the USSR in 1963, following what Wright refers to as a warning by &quot;a fifth man, still inside&quot;, he became convinced that the KGB had penetrated the highest levels of MI5, claiming in &quot;Spycatcher&quot; that Roger Hollis was the highest-placed Soviet mole within the service. Wright went so far as to begin to make, as he himself put it, &quot;his own &#x27;freelance&#x27; inquiries into Hollis&#x27;s background&quot; shortly before the latter&#x27;s retirement.

According to Wright, his initial, unspecified suspicion was aroused by his analysis of the KGB&#x27;s reaction to the arrest of Soviet operative Gordon Lonsdale in January 1961. The KGB appeared to have had foreknowledge of the arrest, and Wright deduced that Lonsdale may have been sacrificed to protect a more important Soviet spy in Britain. His suspicions were further strengthened by Hollis&#x27;s apparent obstruction of any attempt to investigate information from several defectors that there was a mole in MI5; and his discovery that Hollis had concealed relationships with a number of suspicious persons, including Claud Cockburn, a communist journalist who was at the time suspected of connections to Soviet intelligence; and Agnes Smedley, at a time when Smedley was in a relationship with Soviet spymaster Richard Sorge.

Later during his investigations, Wright examined the debriefings of Soviet defector Igor Gouzenko and found to his surprise that the revelations of that debriefing were neither reported nor recorded. After a lengthy check, he discovered that it had been Hollis who was sent to Canada to interview Gouzenko. Gouzenko had provided Hollis with clear information about Alan Nunn May&#x27;s meetings with his Soviet handlers and noted that the man who met him seemed to be in disguise, not interested in his revelations, and discouraged him from further disclosures.

Gouzenko had not known about Klaus Fuchs, but he had named a low level suspected GRU agent, Israel Halperin, a mathematician who was later completely cleared of any suspicions of espionage. When the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched Halperin&#x27;s lodgings, they found the name of Fuchs in his address book. Fuchs immediately ceased contact with his handler, Harry Gold, and shortly afterwards took a long vacation in Mexico. Wright alleges in &quot;Spycatcher&quot; that Gouzenko himself deduced later that his interviewer might have been a Soviet double agent and was probably afraid that Gouzenko might recognize him from case photos that Gouzenko might have seen in KGB or GRU files, which would explain why Hollis was disguised.

According to Wright, the FLUENCY Working Party, an inter-agency committee created to examine all the hitherto unsolved allegations about penetration of the British security apparatus, unanimously concluded, among other things, that Hollis was the likely individual for allegations levelled by Gouzenko and fellow defector Konstantin Volkov. The committee submitted its final report shortly after Hollis retired in late 1965 as MI5 Director-General, but an investigation of Hollis was not authorized by his successor, Martin Furnival Jones, who nevertheless authorized the investigation of his deputy, Michael Hanley. A retired civil servant, Burke Trend, later Lord Trend, was summoned during the early 1970s to review the Hollis case. After studying the case for a year, Trend concluded that the evidence was inconclusive for either convicting or clearing Hollis; this was announced in March 1981 by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

On the basis of his interviews with Sir Dennis Proctor and friends, Wright also alleged in &quot;Spycatcher&quot; that Proctor, former Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Power, was at the very least, by Proctor&#x27;s own account, an unwitting source of secret information to the Soviets via his close friend and Soviet spy Guy Burgess, from whom he had kept no secrets. Wright&#x27;s investigation was also focused on Labour prime minister Harold Wilson, suspicions about whom were initially triggered amongst the MI5 leadership by James Jesus Angleton, chief of counterintelligence for the CIA. The MI5 investigation into Wilson&#x27;s background, however, failed to produce any conclusive evidence.

When Wright retired in 1976, Wilson was again prime minister. Dame Stella Rimington, MI5 Director-General from 1992 to 1996, later wrote in 2001 that she believed that in a &quot;Panorama&quot; programme in 1988, Wright had retracted an allegation made in his book about the MI5 group of thirty officers who plotted to overthrow Wilson&#x27;s government. She also criticised Wright who, according to her, was &quot;a man with an obsession, and was regarded by many as quite mad and certainly dangerous.&quot; Rimington alleged that Wright was a disruptive and lazy officer, who as special advisor to the Director-General had a habit of taking case files that interested him from other officers, failing to return them to their proper place, and failing to write up any interviews he conducted.

Wright&#x27;s case against Hollis was re-stated by Chapman Pincher in his book, &quot;Treachery: Betrayals, Blunders, and Cover-ups: Six Decades of Espionage Against America and Great Britain&quot; (2009). But in its obituary of Pincher in 2014, &quot;The Times&quot; discredited the journalist&#x27;s theory (&quot;Paranoia Hollisiensis&quot;) and asserted that Hollis had not been a Soviet spy.

==Retirement, &quot;Spycatcher&quot; publication, and later life==

Upon his retirement in 1976, Wright was denied a full pension on a technicality and emigrated to the town of Cygnet, Tasmania, Australia, where he bred Arabian horses.

In a bid to quell rumours that he had been the &quot;fifth man&quot; of the Cambridge Five, Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild&lt;ref name=&quot;nickdavies/1987/03/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; paid Wright&#x27;s airfare from Australia to meet with Pincher in writing &quot;Their Trade Is Treachery&quot; (1982). Wright received royalties of £30,000 for this collaboration.

After Heinemann announced the release of &quot;Spycatcher&quot; in 1985, the British government in 1985 attempted to ban its publication in Australia. In 1987, the Supreme Court of New South Wales ruled against the British government, Wright being represented in court by Malcolm Turnbull, later prime minister of Australia. Turnbull&#x27;s tough questioning of Robert Armstrong, Thatcher&#x27;s cabinet secretary, led Armstrong to admit in court that a letter he had written that was presented in Wright&#x27;s book was ″economical with the truth″. The subsequent appeals against the decision were definitively dismissed in 1988, the High Court of Australia concluding in its decision on the case: ″[...] The appellant&#x27;s claim for protection (whether injunctive or by way of accounts or damages) ought to have been refused simply on the ground that the Court would not, in the absence of statutory direction, protect the intelligence secrets and confidential political information of the United Kingdom Government.″ By then, the US edition of &quot;Spycatcher&quot; was already an international best-seller. The book sold nearly two million copies and made Wright a millionaire.

According to the documents released in 2015, the Australian government, then led by Bob Hawke, heeded the advice from British counterparts and lent support to the UK government&#x27;s bid to suppress publication, despite being aware that Australia&#x27;s national security was not ″directly threatened″ by Wright&#x27;s manuscript. A memorandum prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said among other things: ″The British are seeking to avoid discussion of any of Wright&#x27;s specific allegations, arguing that, for the purposes of the trial, they can all be assumed to be true and even then Wright&#x27;s breach of confidentiality would be a breach of contract and inequitable.″

In the opinion of the official historian of MI5, Christopher Andrew, Turnbull&#x27;s ″brilliant″ conduct of the &quot;Spycatcher&quot; case humiliated the British establishment and triggered much-needed reform in the intelligence services. In 2011, Turnbull said that ″Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s iron will made &quot;Spycatcher&quot; a global bestseller″. The affair influenced the enactment of the official secrets legislation of 1989 by hastening it and probably making its provisions more severe. In 1991, the European Court of Human Rights found that the attempts of the British government to ban the book had violated the right of the author to freedom of speech.

The accuracy of various allegations made in &quot;Spycatcher&quot; was questioned in a review published by the Center for the Study of Intelligence, an in-house think tank for the CIA. While admitting (on page 42) that the book included &quot;factual data&quot;, the document stated that it was also &quot;filled with [unspecified] errors, exaggerations, bogus ideas, and self-inflation&quot;. The review added (on page 45) that &quot;Gen. Oleg Kalugin, former Chief of Counterintelligence&quot; had confirmed to Wright that Hollis had not worked for the KGB but did not include a discussion of the possibility that Hollis might have worked with the GRU.

Wright went on to publish &quot;The Encyclopaedia of Espionage&quot; in 1991 and reportedly was writing a fictional spy thriller at the time of his death on 26 April 1995, aged 78. The obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot; opined: ″No British intelligence officer other than Kim Philby caused more mayhem within Britain&#x27;s secret services and more trouble for British politicians than Peter Wright.″

<doc id="896811" wikidata="Q923442" url="?curid=896811" title="Tornado Alley">
<text>Tornado Alley, also known as Tornado Valley, is a loosely defined location of the central United States and Canada where tornadoes are most frequent. The term was first used in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska. Tornado climatologists distinguish peaks in activity in certain areas and storm chasers have long recognized the Great Plains tornado belt.

As a colloquial term there are no definitively set boundaries of Tornado Alley, but the area common to most definitions extends from Texas, through Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, North Dakota, Montana, Ohio, and eastern portions of Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming. Research suggests that the main alley may be shifting eastward away from the Great Plains, and that tornadoes are also becoming more frequent in the northern and eastern parts of Tornado Alley where it reaches the Canadian Prairies, Ohio, Michigan, and Southern Ontario.

== Geographical area ==
Over the years, the location(s) of Tornado Alley have not been clearly defined. No definition of tornado alley has ever been officially designated by the National Weather Service (NWS). Thus, differences in location are the result of the different criteria used.

According to the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) FAQ, &quot;Tornado Alley&quot; is a term used by the media as a reference to areas that have higher numbers of tornadoes. A study of 1921–1995 tornadoes concluded almost one-fourth of all significant tornadoes occur in this area.

Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, Michigan, and western Ohio are sometimes included in Tornado Alley. Some research suggests that tornadoes are becoming more frequent in the northern parts of Tornado Alley where it reaches the Canadian Prairies.

No place on earth is entirely free of tornadoes, however, they occur much more frequently in the United States, particularly in the Central states, between the Rocky Mountains to the west and Appalachian Mountains to the east. Texas has the most overall number of tornadoes of any state. Per data collected through 2007, Kansas and Oklahoma ranked first and second respectively in the number of tornadoes per area. However, in 2013 statistics from the National Climatic Data Center reported Florida ranked first in tornadoes per area, although Florida is not a part of Tornado Alley. Florida&#x27;s high ranking on the tornado list also has to do with the fact that the state sees a high number of waterspouts, small tornadoes that form over water. Although strong land-tornadoes have hit Florida and reports show Florida has a very high number of overall tornadoes, the tornadoes in the state seldom reach the velocity of those that may occur in the Southern Plains. In the United States, tornadoes typically occur in late spring and early summer during the changing season patterns as a warm air mass typically collides with a cold air mass resulting in tornadoes.

Another criterion for the location of Tornado Alley can be where the strongest tornadoes occur more frequently.

Tornado Alley can also be defined as an area reaching from central Texas to the Canadian Prairies and from eastern Colorado to western Ohio.

Some researchers argue that there are several Tornado Alleys. In addition to the Texas/Oklahoma/Kansas core, such other areas include the Upper Midwest, the lower Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley, and the lower Mississippi valley, which may have respective distinguishing characteristics. A coherent conception considers that there is a single Tornado Alley in the United States and Canada, and that this can simply be subdivided into smaller areas based on regional attributes.

The extension of the North American tornadically active in the southeastern U.S., notably the lower Mississippi Valley and the upper Tennessee Valley, are sometimes called by the nickname &quot;Dixie Alley&quot;, coined in 1971 by Allen Pearson, former director of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC). A 2018 study found in the U.S., over the study period 1979–2017, an overall eastward shift of tornado frequency and impacts - toward Dixie Alley. The study found, since 1979, relatively-lower tornado frequency and impacts in parts of the traditional Tornado Alley, especially areas from north-central Texas toward the Houston, TX area, and relatively-higher tornado frequency and impacts in parts of the Mid-South, especially eastern Arkansas, the greater Memphis, TN area and northern Mississippi - all areas near the heart of Dixie Alley - see especially Figure 4.

In Tornado Alley, warm, humid air from the equator meets cool to cold, dry air from Canada and the Rocky Mountains. This creates an ideal environment for tornadoes to form within developed thunderstorms and supercell.

== Origin of the term ==
The term &quot;tornado alley&quot; was first used in 1952 by U.S. Air Force meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush (1915–1982) and Captain Robert C. Miller (1920–1998), as the title of a research project to study severe weather in parts of Texas and Oklahoma.

== Impact ==
Despite the elevated frequency of destructive tornadoes, building codes, such as requiring strengthened roofs and more secure connections between the building and its foundation, are not necessarily stricter compared to other areas of the United States and are markedly weaker than some hurricane prone areas, such as south Florida. One particular tornado-afflicted town, Moore, Oklahoma, managed to increase its building requirements in 2014. Other common precautionary measures include the construction of storm cellars and the installation of tornado sirens. Tornado awareness, preparedness, and media weather coverage are also high.

The southeastern United States is particularly prone to violent, long track tornadoes. Much of the housing in this region is less robust compared to other areas in the United States, and many people live in mobile homes. As a result, tornado-related casualties in the southern United States are higher. Significant tornadoes occur less frequently than in the traditionally recognized tornado alley; however, very severe and expansive outbreaks occur every few years.

== Frequency of tornadoes ==
These figures, reported by the National Climatic Data Center for the period between 1991 and 2010, show the seventeen U.S. states with the highest average number of EF0-EF5 tornadoes per per year.
# Florida: 12.3
# Kansas: 11.7
# Maryland: 9.9
# Illinois: 9.7

== Tornadoes in Canada ==
Canada records the second most tornadoes in the world after the United States. The average number of tornadoes per equal area of land is highest in the southern parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario.

Roughly half of all Canadian tornadoes strike the Canadian Prairies and Northern Ontario as far east as Lake Superior. Together, these regions make up the northernmost border of the U.S. Tornado Alley. Tornadoes up to F5 in strength have been documented in this region.

Another third of Canadian tornadoes strike Southern Ontario and Quebec, especially in the region between the Great Lakes and the nation&#x27;s capital city, Ottawa. Tornadoes do not often hit lake shadow regions, although they are not unknown, and some, such as the 2011 Goderich tornado, have been violent. However, most Ontario tornadoes are concentrated in a narrow corridor from Windsor to Ottawa as well as through portions of Central Quebec. Tornadoes up to F4 in strength have been documented in this region.

In more recent years, an emerging trend has suggested that the Ottawa Valley is seeing an increasing number of frequent and violent tornadoes. The 2018 National Capital Region Outbreak spawned a high-end EF3+ and high-end EF2 which caused catastrophic damage to areas in both Ottawa and Gatineau. 2023 saw 5 tornadoes of varying intensities strike the region, including two EF1 tornadoes which touched down in the Barrhaven suburb within minutes of one another. This phenomenon, while still in the preliminary stages of study, has led some to name this hotspot &quot;Tornado Valley&quot;.

Southwestern Ontario weather is strongly influenced by its peninsular position between the Great Lakes. As a result, increases in temperature in this region are likely to increase the amount of precipitation in storms due to lake evaporation. Increased temperature contrasts may also increase the violence and possibly the number of tornadoes.

Northern Ontario between the Manitoba border and Lake Superior is also prone to severe tornadoes, but tornadoes in this area are believed to be underestimated due to the extremely low population in this region.

<text>The Trollenberg Terror (U.S. title: The Crawling Eye; also known as Creatures from Another World ) is a 1958 British science fiction horror film produced by Robert S. Baker and Monty Berman and directed by Quentin Lawrence. The film stars Forrest Tucker, Laurence Payne, Janet Munro, and Jennifer Jayne. The special effects are by Les Bowie. The story is based on a 1956 British ITV &quot;Saturday Serial&quot; television programme written by George F. Kerr, Jack Cross and Giles Cooper under the collective pseudonym of &quot;Peter Key&quot;. The film was released as &quot;The Crawling Eye&quot; in the United States on 7 July 1958 by Distributors Corporation of America and as &quot;The Trollenberg Terror&quot; in the United Kingdom in October 1958 by Eros Films. It played on a double bill with the British science fiction film &quot;The Strange World of Planet X&quot;, retitled &quot;Cosmic Monsters&quot; for its American release.

&quot;The Trollenberg Terror&quot;″s storyline concerns United Nations troubleshooter Alan Brooks, later joined by journalist Philip Truscott, investigating unusual accidents occurring in the area of a resort hotel on the fictional Mount Trollenberg in Switzerland. Brooks suspects that these deaths are related to a series of similar incidents which occurred three years earlier in the Andes Mountains, which involved an unexplained radioactive cloud formation believed by locals to be inhabited.
==Plot==
On the Swiss mountain Trollenberg, one of three climbers is suddenly killed, his head ripped from his body. Two sisters, Anne and Sarah Pilgrim, a London mind-reading act, are travelling by train to Geneva when Anne faints as the train passes the mountain. Upon waking, Anne insists that they must get off at the next stop.

UN troubleshooter Alan Brooks, in the same train compartment as the sisters, is going to Trollenberg&#x27;s observatory to meet with Professor Crevett. Crevett goes on to explain that, despite a series of climbing accidents, no bodies are ever found, and an always-stationary radioactive cloud is regularly observed on the mountain&#x27;s south face. Brooks mentions similar incidents that took place in South America in the Andes three years earlier, just before a similar radioactive cloud vanished without a trace. Local rumors circulated that something was alive in the heavy mist of the cloud.

Anne is giving a mind-reading demonstration at the nearby hotel when she &quot;sees&quot; two men in a base camp hut on the mountain. Dewhurst is asleep when the other man, Brett, under some kind of mental compulsion, walks outside as the cloud envelopes the hut. Anne suddenly faints again. Brooks phones the hut, Dewhurst answers, screams, and then the connection suddenly goes dead.

A rescue party, including Brooks, climbs up to the camp hut looking for both men. Anne, in a trance-like state, urges the rescuers to stay away. Inside the hut, the rescuers discover that everything is frozen solid, despite the door being locked from the inside. Dewhurst&#x27;s body is found under a bed with its head missing. A spotter plane arrives and circles overhead, and a man is spotted a half mile away. The first rescuer finds a rucksack at that location with a severed head inside. He is set upon and killed by Brett, who also kills the second rescuer when he arrives.

Later at the hotel, Brett suddenly staggers in, claiming that he had been lost on the mountain. Soon after, he attacks Anne with a knife, but Brooks manages to subdue him. Brett sustains a severe head gash during the struggle, but no blood flows from the wound. He is heavily sedated and locked away. Brooks recalls to journalist Philip Truscott a similar incident in the Andes that followed a similar pattern: a man murdered an elderly woman who allegedly had psychic abilities like those displayed by Anne. The killer&#x27;s body was discovered to have been dead for at least 24 hours prior to his murder of the old woman. Brett escapes his improvised cell and resumes his hunt for Anne, this time armed with a handaxe. Before he can reach her, Brooks dispatches him with a pistol. Brett&#x27;s flesh appears crystallized upon inspection and rapidly decomposes in the heat.

The cloud has begun to move down the mountainside towards the hotel, so the guests retreat up to the fortified observatory. A mother realises that her young daughter is missing as they enter the cable car. In a thickening mist, a giant tentacled creature with a single huge eye appears at the hotel, smashing down the front door. Brooks manages to rescue the child from the lobby, both of them narrowly escaping. They return to the cable car, but the delay gives the mist a chance to reach the car platform. The transport motor begins to freeze, starting and stopping, the cable slipping, but the cable car arrives safely. The single cloud has now split into five while converging on the observatory.

Hans, who left the hotel by car, suddenly turns up at the observatory. Once inside, he begins exhibiting the same obsession with Anne. Hans tries to strangle her, but Brooks and Truscott stop him as Brooks stabs him. As the monsters near the observatory, everyone makes Molotov cocktails to combat them. By radio, Alan orders an aerial firebombing raid against the observatory, which has reinforced walls and concrete roof that can withstand the assault.

Truscott strikes one of the creatures with a Molotov cocktail, setting it ablaze. He is caught by a tentacle from another monster now atop the observatory&#x27;s roof. Brooks sets that one ablaze with another Molotov cocktail, forcing it to drop Truscott. Later, Truscott firebombs another creature that manages to breach a portion of thick wall to get at Anne. The aerial firebombing assault begins and successfully torches the remaining monsters.

==Cast==
† Reprising role from TV version.

==Production==
&quot;The Trollenberg Terror&quot; was the final film shot at Southall Studios, one of the earliest pioneer film studios in the United Kingdom, and was one of the last films released by Distributors Corporation of America.

Mitchell&#x27;s role was originally meant to be played by Anton Diffring, but Diffring pulled out of the part at the last minute. It was an early film role for Janet Munro.

==Reception==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Several sequences in this Alpine science fiction production are genuinely alarming, although much more could have been made of the dramatic moments. The film gives the impression of having been shot and edited in a great hurry and the characteristic addiction to close-ups of such details as severed heads and melting flesh is more in evidence than in most science fiction pieces. More accomplished direction might have resulted in a film as effective as the &quot;Quatermass&quot; film series&quot;.

In the 1 January 1959 issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, film critic Richard W. Nason reviewed the double feature starring Forrest Tucker and opined that &quot;...&quot;The Crawling Eye&quot; and &quot;The Cosmic Monsters&quot; do nothing to enhance or advance the copious genre of science fiction&quot;.

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: &quot;Efficiently suspenseful British cheapie marred by awful special effects. Two bits of cotton wool stuck on a mountain photo make do for the cloudy snowscapes in veteran Hammer scriptwriter Jimmy Sangster&#x27;s screen version of the BBC [sic] TV series. Forrest Tucker is miscast as the hero, but Janet Munro is affecting as the telepathic heroine the aliens seize as their mouthpiece.&quot;
Film historian and critic Leonard Maltin considered &quot;The Trollenberg Terror&quot; as &quot;ok, if predictable&quot;, a feature that showed its humble origins, being adapted by Jimmy Sangster from the British TV series (also called &quot;The Trollenberg Terror&quot;) about cloud-hiding alien invaders on a Swiss mountaintop. Maltin noted that the film was &quot;hampered by low-grade special effects&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The main title music from &quot;The Crawling Eye&quot; was featured on the album &quot;Greatest Science Fiction Hits V&quot; by Neil Norman and his Cosmic Orchestra, released in 1979 on GNP Crescendo Records.

&quot;The Trollenberg Terror&quot; was one of the inspirations for writer/director John Carpenter&#x27;s 1980 horror film &quot;The Fog&quot;.

In Stephen King&#x27;s 1986 horror novel &quot;It&quot; one of the protagonists, Richie Tozier, watches the film and it terrifies him. A crawling-eye creature later appears as a manifestation of It, the novel&#x27;s title monster.

Under the title &quot;The Crawling Eye&quot;, the film was the first of many productions to be mocked on the TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, after the series moved from KTMA to The Comedy Channel. The episode aired on 11 November 1989. It was also briefly mentioned at the end of the season 10 finale (the original series finale) covering &quot;&quot;.

A scene of the film was briefly seen in the 1998 film Small Soldiers when the Gorgonites, Slamfist, and Ocula are watching a wrestling match on television and one of them accidentally hits the TV remote which changes the channel showing a scene of the film&#x27;s crawling eye creature.

The &quot;Freakazoid&quot; episode &quot;The Cloud&quot; spoofed the film&#x27;s opening credits, as well as key elements of the plot, though with the victims being turned into clowns instead of being killed.

A song called &quot;Crawling Eye&quot; was featured on American horror punk band the Misfits&#x27; 1999 album &quot;Famous Monsters&quot;; the song&#x27;s lyrics directly referenced the plot of the film.

The film was shown on the MeTV show &quot;Svengoolie&quot; on 26 November 2022.

In the 2023 &quot;Riverdale&quot; episode &quot;Betty &amp; Veronica Double Digest&quot;, a 4D screening of the film is held to increase popularity of a financially struggling movie theater.

<text>The Skeena River is the second-longest river entirely within British Columbia, Canada (after the Fraser River). Since ancient times, the Skeena has been an important transportation artery, particularly for the Tsimshian and the Gitxsan—whose names mean &quot;inside the River of Mist&quot;, and &quot;people of the River of Mist,&quot; respectively. The river and its basin sustain a wide variety of fish, wildlife, and vegetation, and communities native to the area depend on the health of the river. The Tsimshian migrated to the Lower Skeena River, and the Gitxsan occupy territory of the Upper Skeena.

During the Omineca Gold Rush, steamboat services ran from the sea to Hazelton, which was the jumping-off point for the trails to the goldfields. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established a major trading post on the Skeena at what became called Port Simpson, British Columbia (&quot;Lax Kw&#x27;alaams&quot;), where nine tribes of the Tsimshian nation settled about 1834. Other tribes live elsewhere in BC, and descendants of one group in Metlakatla, Alaska.

== Geography ==
The Skeena originates south of the Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park in north western British Columbia, forming a divide with the Klappan River, a tributary of the Stikine River. It flows for before it empties into Chatham Sound, Telegraph Passage and Ogden Channel, east of the Dixon Entrance, all part of the Pacific Ocean. The Skeena drains of land with a mean annual discharge of .

===Course===

The Skeena River originates at the southern end of Spatsizi Plateau, in a valley between Mount Gunanoot and Mount Thule, south of the Stikine River watershed. The abandoned track of BC Rail&#x27;s Dease Lake Extension runs along the river in its upper course. It flows south-east, between the shallow peaks of the Skeena Mountains, through the McEvoy and Jackson flats. It continues in this direction until it passes the Slamgeesh Range, then flows westwards to Fourth Cabin, when it turns south through a shallow canyon below Poison Mountain. After Kuldo it takes an eastward turn, then flows south again below Cutoff Mountain and Mount Pope. It continues through rolling hills to the community of Kispiox and then Hazelton, where it receives the waters of Morice-Bulkley River, and turns south-west. The Yellowhead Highway and a Canadian National Railway track follow the course of the Skeena on this section. At Kitwanga, the river is crossed by Highway 37, and then turns south around the Seven Sisters Peaks and Bulkley Ranges, through the Skeena Provincial Forest, then between the Nass Ranges and Borden Glacier, past the ferry crossing at Usk, through the Kitselas Canyon, and then through the Kleanza Creek Provincial Park. It then flows south-west through the city of Terrace, where the river widens. It continues westwards, followed by the Highway 16 and Canadian National Railway line, passes near the Exchamsiks River Provincial Park, then flows into the Dixon Entrance at Eleanor Passage, between Port Edward and Port Essington, facing De Horsey Island.

== Wildlife ==
The Skeena supports a wide variety of fish and wildlife. The British Columbia Ministry of the Environment, through BC Parks, has designated a number of Ecological Reserves along the course of the river.

=== Fish ===
The Skeena is well known for its sport fishing, most notably salmon. The Skeena is also very important to the commercial fishing industry. For example, numbering 5 million spawning salmon a year, the Skeena is second only to the Fraser River in Canada in its capacity to produce sockeye salmon. However, in the last 40 years there has been a decrease in some of the fish species, leading to strict fishing regulations for the commercial fishery.

The following types of Pacific salmon can be found in the Skeena:
*Chinook salmon, sometimes known as king, Tyee, spring, Quinnat, tule, or blackmouth salmon.
*Chum salmon, sometimes known as dog or calico salmon.
*Coho salmon, sometimes known as silver salmon.
*Pink salmon, sometimes known as humpback salmon.
*Sockeye salmon, sometimes known as red salmon or blueback salmon.
Other anadromous species:
*Steelhead, anadromous form of rainbow trout

=== Bears ===
The rare Kermode bear lives in and near the Skeena Valley from Prince Rupert to Hazelton. The region is also home to many black bears and brown bears. Grizzly bears are less common in the area but the Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary is located nearby.

== History ==

===Indigenous peoples===
The Skeena River watershed is the ancient homeland of the Tsimshian, Gitxsan, and Wet&#x27;suwet&#x27;en people.

During the 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic thousands of indigenous people were evicted from large semi-permanent camps near Victoria and forced to return to their homelands, spreading smallpox throughout the Pacific Northwest coast. Groups of Tsimshian thus brought smallpox from Victoria to the Fort Simpson area, whence it spread widely starting in June 1862. Through the summer indigenous people arrived regularly at the fort to trade, contributing to the spread of smallpox throughout the Northern Coast, up the Skeena River and the Nass River into the British Columbia interior, devastating the Wetʼsuwetʼen and other interior First Nations. All Tsimshianic peoples suffered high death rates from smallpox in 1862–63: About 67% among the Southern Tsimshian, 23% for the Coast Tsimshian, 37% among the Nisga&#x27;a, and about 22% among the Gitxsan.

=== Fur trading ===
The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s local headquarters were at Port Simpson, although Port Essington was also used extensively as a port for its sternwheelers.

=== Riverboats ===
While canoes played a crucial role on the Skeena for centuries, the age of the steamboat heralded a new era of boating on the Skeena. The first steam-powered vessel to enter the Skeena was the &quot;Union&quot; in 1864. In 1866 the &quot;Mumford&quot; attempted to ascend the river but was only able to reach the Kitsumkalum River. It was not until 1891 that the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sternwheeler the &quot;Caledonia&quot; successfully negotiated through the Kitselas Canyon and reached Hazelton. A number of other steamers were built around the turn of the century, in part due to the growing fish industry and the gold rush.

== SkeenaWild Conservation Trust ==
In 2007 SkeenaWild Conservation Trust was formed to promote projects and initiatives by conservationists, First Nations in Canada, and local communities to protect the natural sustainability of the Skeena watershed and its wild salmon ecosystems. The organization has a large payroll and is dependant on convincing the public that salmon are in crisis. One of SkeenaWild&#x27;s main goals is to develop and implement a strategy for long-term stewardship of forest carbon in the Skeena watershed.

<doc id="896822" wikidata="Q3393796" url="?curid=896822" title="Value-level programming">
<text>Value-level programming refers to one of the two contrasting programming paradigms identified by John Backus in his work on programs as mathematical objects, the other being function-level programming. Backus originally used the term object-level programming but that term is now prone to confusion with object-oriented programming.

Value-level programs are those that describe how to combine various &quot;values&quot; (i.e., numbers, symbols, strings, etc.) to form other values until the final &quot;result values&quot; are obtained. New values are constructed from existing ones by the application of various value-to-value functions, such as addition, concatenation, matrix inversion, and so on.

Conventional, von Neumann programs are value-level: expressions on the right side of assignment statements are exclusively concerned with building a value that is then to be stored.

==Connection with Data Types==
The value-level approach to programming invites the study of the space of values under the value-forming operations, and of the algebraic properties of those operations. This is what is called the study of data types, and it has advanced from focusing on the values themselves and their structure, to a primary concern with the value-forming operations and their structure, as given by certain axioms and algebraic laws, that is, to the &quot;algebraic study of data types&quot;.

==Connection with Lambda Calculus languages==
Lambda calculus-based languages (such as Lisp, ISWIM, and Scheme) are in actual practice value-level languages, although they are not thus restricted by design.

To see why typical &quot;lambda style&quot; programs are primarily value-level, consider the usual definition of a value-to-value function, say 
 f = λ&quot;x&quot;.E
here, &quot;x&quot; must be a value variable (since the argument of f is a value by definition) and E must denote a value too (since f&#x27;s result is a value by definition). Typically, E is an expression involving the application of value-forming functions to value variables and constants; nevertheless, a few value-forming functions having &quot;both&quot; function and value arguments do exist and are used for limited purposes.

If the term &quot;values&quot; is defined to include the value variables themselves, then the value-level view of programming is one of building values by the application of existing programs (value-forming operations/functions) to other values. Lambda-style programming builds a new program from the result-value by lambda-abstracting the value variables.

<doc id="896825" wikidata="Q3334310" url="?curid=896825" title="HMCS Terra Nova">
<text>HMCS &quot;Terra Nova&quot; (DDE 259) was a that served in the Royal Canadian Navy and later the Canadian Forces from 1959 until 1997. After her final refit, she was a guided missile destroyer.

She was the sixth ship of her class and the first Canadian war ship to bear the name &quot;Terra Nova&quot;. The ship&#x27;s badge honours the Terra Nova River on Newfoundland as well as an earlier civilian ship, , which gained fame during a scientific exploration voyage to Antarctica. They are represented as a river and the Antarctic (symbolized by a penguin) on the ship&#x27;s badge.

==Design and description==
Based on the preceding design, the &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class ships had the same hull and propulsion, but different weaponry. Initially the &quot;St. Laurent&quot;-class had been planned to be 14 ships. However the order was halved, and the following seven were redesigned to take into improvements made on the &quot;St. Laurent&quot;-class ships. As time passed, their design diverged further from that of the &quot;St. Laurent&quot;-class ships 

The ships had a displacement of , at deep load. They were designed to be long with a beam of and a draught of . The &quot;Restigouche&quot;s had a complement of 214.

The &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class ships were by powered by two English Electric geared steam turbines, each driving a propeller shaft, using steam provided by two Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. They generated giving the vessels a maximum speed of .

The &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class ships were equipped with SPS-10, SPS-12, Sperry Mk 2 and SPG-48 radar along with SQS-501 and SQS-503 sonar.

===Armament===
The &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class ships diverged from the &quot;St. Laurent&quot;-class ships in their weaponry. The &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class ships were equipped with two twin mounts of Vickers /70 calibre Mk 6 dual-purpose guns forward and maintained a single twin mount of 3-inch/50 calibre Mk 22 guns aft used in the preceding class. A Mk 69 fire control director was added to control the new guns. They were also armed with two Limbo Mk 10 mortars and two single Bofors 40 mm guns. However the 40 mm guns were dropped in the final design. The 3 in/70 mounting was placed in the &#x27;A&#x27; position and the 3 in/50 mounting was placed in the &#x27;Y&#x27; position.

The destroyers were also equipped beginning in 1958 with Mk 43 homing torpedoes in an effort to increase the distance between the ships and their targets. The Mk 43 torpedo had a range of at . They were pitched over the side by a modified depth charge thrower.

===Improved Restigouche Escorts (IRE)===
As part of the 1964 naval program, the Royal Canadian Navy planned to improve the attack capabilities of the &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class. Unable to convert the vessels to helicopter-carrying versions like the &quot;St. Laurent&quot;s due to budget constraints, instead &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class ships were to receive variable depth sonar (VDS) to improve their sonar range, placed on the stern, and the RUR-5 anti-submarine rocket (ASROC). The destroyers also received a stepped latticed mast. Called the Improved Restigouche Escorts (IRE), &quot;Terra Nova&quot; was the first to undergo conversion, beginning in May 1965. The conversion took ten months to complete, followed by sea trials. The sea trials delayed the conversion of the next ship for four years. By 1969, the budget for naval programs had been cut and only four out of the seven (&quot;Terra Nova&quot;, &quot;Restigouche&quot;, &quot;Gatineau&quot; and &quot;Kootenay&quot;) would get upgraded to IRE standards and the remaining three (&quot;Chaudière&quot;, &quot;Columbia&quot;, and &quot;St. Croix&quot;) were placed in reserve.

The ASROC launcher replaced the 3 in/50 cal twin mount and one Mk 10 Limbo mortars aft. The ASROC was rocket-propelled acoustically guided Mk 44 torpedo that had a minimum range of and a maximum range of .

===Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX)===
The Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) refit for the four surviving &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class ships was announced in 1978. An effort by Maritime Command to update their existing stock of naval escorts, the DELEX program affected 16 ships in total and came in several different formats depending on the class of ship it was being applied to. On average, the DELEX refit cost $24 million per ship. For the &quot;Restigouche&quot;s this meant updating their sensor, weapon and communications systems. The class received the new ADLIPS tactical data system, new radar and fire control systems and satellite navigation. They were also fitted with a triple torpedo tube mounting to use the new Mk 46 torpedo. The ships began undergoing their DELEX refits in the early 1980s. However, by the time the ships emerged from their refits, they were already obsolete as the Falklands War had changed the way surface battles were fought.

===Gulf War refit===
With the advent of the Gulf War in August 1990, Maritime Command was asked to have a fleet of ships available to send to the Persian Gulf, preferably three ships. The and the replenishment ship would be made part of the task force; however, all the other &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class vessels were in refit. Maritime Command chose from among the remaining fleet the vessel with the best electronic countermeasures suite, &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, to deploy with the task force. &quot;Terra Nova&quot; was quickly altered to make her ready for an active war zone. The ship&#x27;s ASROC system was landed and instead two quad Harpoon surface-to-surface missile systems were installed. A Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapon system was placed on the quarterdeck in place of the landed Limbo ASW mortar, and two 40 mm/60 calibre Boffin guns were installed in single mounts where the ship&#x27;s boats were. The ship was also fitted with new chaff, electronic and communications systems. &quot;Restigouche&quot; received a similar refit before deploying as &quot;Terra Nova&quot;″s intended replacement in the Persian Gulf in 1991.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Terra Nova&quot;, named for river in Newfoundland and Labrador, was laid down on 14 November 1952 by Victoria Machinery Depot Co. Ltd at Victoria, British Columbia. The ship was launched on 21 June 1955 and commissioned at Victoria on 6 June 1959 with the classification DDE 259.

Following her commissioning, &quot;Terra Nova&quot; joined the ceremonies for the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in July 1959. The following year, in August, with sister ships , and , she took part in the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator&#x27;s death off Lisbon. After work ups, the ship was assigned to the Fifth Canadian Escort Squadron. In March 1961, the destroyer escort was among the ships that took part in a combined naval exercise with the United States Navy off Nova Scotia.

In March 1965, &quot;Terra Nova&quot; and &quot;Gatineau&quot; participated in the search for a Royal Canadian Air Force Canadair CP-107 Argus that had disappeared north of San Juan, Puerto Rico. In May, the ship began her IRE refit. As the first to undergo the conversion, &quot;Terra Nova&quot; tested the new SQS-505 sonar for several months before the refit was considered completed. In all the conversion took ten months to complete. However &quot;Terra Nova&quot;″s sea trials delayed the conversion program by four years. During this period, the ship first transferred from to the Third Canadian Escort Squadron in January 1966, before being transferred to the west coast as part of the re-ordering of naval forces following the Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces in 1968. She was one of four &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class vessels that were transferred to the west coast, to replace the s in the Second Canadian Escort Squadron. The ship returned to duty on 4 May 1971 at Esquimalt, British Columbia. From 29 January to 26 June 1973, &quot;Kootenay&quot; and &quot;Terra Nova&quot; were deployed off the coast of Vietnam as part of the Canadian contribution to the International Commission of Control and Supervision following the end of the Vietnam War.

In November 1981, cracks were found in the superheater headers of . Inspections were ordered for the &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class vessels, of which &quot;Terra Nova&quot; was found to have similar issues. The ship was repaired and back in service within six months. In May 1983, the ship made a four-day visit to China on behalf of the Department of External Affairs. &quot;Terra Nova&quot; was taken in hand on 21 November 1983 for her DELEX refit, performed at Esquimalt. She returned to service on 9 November 1984.
On 12 December 1989, &quot;Terra Nova&quot; transferred to the east coast in exchange for as part of the reorganization of the fleet. Due to a shortage of &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers, &quot;Terra Nova&quot; was selected for deployment as part of Canada&#x27;s contribution to Operation Desert Shield. She received a Gulf War refit before deploying and sailed for the Persian Gulf with the destroyer &quot;Athabaskan&quot; and the replenishment ship &quot;Preserver&quot; on 24 August 1990. They arrived in theatre on 27 September and &quot;Terra Nova&quot; performed her first patrol on 1 October. &quot;Terra Nova&quot; returned to Halifax on 7 April 1991. The Task Group was assigned to the international coalition maritime interdiction force in the central Persian Gulf which consisted of a variety of coalition naval forces on station through the fall of 1990. After Operation Desert Storm began in January, the Canadian Naval Task Group undertook escort duties for hospital ships and other coalition naval vessels.

In October 1992, &quot;Terra Nova&quot; began a refit at Port Weller Dry Dock in St. Catharines, Ontario, reentering service in 1993. On 22 February 1994, &quot;Terra Nova&quot; boarded the private vessel , seizing of cocaine. That same year, &quot;Terra Nova&quot; was part of the blockade enforcing United Nations resolutions on Haiti from 28 April to 18 July, rescuing two boatloads of refugees during this tour. She returned to blockade duty from 7 September to 19 October.

On 11 July 1997, the ship was taken out of active service and paid off on 1 July 1998. The ship was sold in October 2009, along with &quot;Gatineau&quot; for $4,258,529 to Aecon Fabco for scrapping. The ships were towed to Pictou, Nova Scotia in mid-November 2009 for breaking up. During the scrapping process, &quot;Terra Nova&quot; sank at her moorings. The hulk was later raised by crane.
