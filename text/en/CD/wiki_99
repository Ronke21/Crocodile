<text>Shawn Dwayne Marion (born May 7, 1978) is an American former professional basketball player who played 16 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Marion finished his career as a four-time NBA All-Star, a two-time member of the All-NBA Team and a one-time NBA champion, helping the Dallas Mavericks win their maiden title in 2011. Nicknamed &quot;The Matrix&quot; by former NBA player Kenny Smith during the preseason of his rookie year, he was widely regarded as one of the most versatile players in the league because of his athleticism and ability to play and defend many positions. He was also known for his unorthodox shooting form.

==Early life==
Marion was born in Waukegan, Illinois which is about an hour north of Chicago, and played high school basketball in Clarksville, Tennessee, at Clarksville High School, where he was a teammate of fellow future NBA player Trenton Hassell. Marion lettered three years in basketball, and during his high school career he earned All-Region and District honors and was nominated as a McDonald&#x27;s All-American. As a senior, he averaged 26.4 points and 13.1 rebounds, led his team to the Final 8 of the Tennessee Class AAA State Tournament, earned MVP honors, and was selected to the first-team Tennessee All-State Team.

==College career==
After high school, Marion attended Vincennes University, a junior college in Indiana, for two years. He was a first-team All-American selection as a sophomore and a second-team All-American selection as a freshman. As a freshman in 1996–97, he appeared in 36 games and averaged 23.3 points and 12.8 rebounds (462 total). He shot 56 percent from the field (324-for-516) and 69 percent from the free throw line (124-for-178). His 838 total points as a freshman established him as the second-highest single-season total in school history. As a sophomore in 1997–98, he appeared in 36 games and averaged 23.5 points (847 total points) and 13.1 rebounds (471 total). He shot 60 percent from the field (331-for-549), 38 percent from 3-point range (21-for-56) and 75 percent from the free throw line (122-for-163). He was subsequently named the 1998 NJCAA David Rowlands Male Student Athlete of the Year. He averaged 23.4 points (1,685 total points) in his career and is Vincennes University&#x27;s second all-time leading scorer.

In May 1998, Marion signed a National Letter of Intent to play for UNLV.

As a junior at UNLV in 1998–99, Marion averaged 18.7 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.5 steals and 1.9 blocks in 29 games. He was named to the Western Athletic Conference Mountain Division First Team, All-Newcomer Team and All-Defensive Team.

In March 1999, Marion said his intention was to stay for his senior season, graduate and try to win an NCAA championship. But while trying to gauge where he stood with the NBA scouts, he learned he was highly regarded and that he was looking at going no lower than the middle of the first round. As a result, he declared for the 1999 NBA draft in April.

==Professional career==

===Phoenix Suns (1999–2008)===
Marion was selected by the Phoenix Suns with the ninth overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft. Due to a left knee injury, Marion missed 31 games between December and February of the 1999–2000 season. He was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team and in 51 games (38 starts), he averaged 10.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 1.0 blocks, 0.8 steals and 24.7 minutes. He averaged 17.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.7 steals, 1.4 blocks and 36.2 minutes in 78 starts during the 2000–01 season. He played for the Sophomores in the Rookie Challenge during the NBA All-Star Weekend and finished with 18 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 steals and 1 block in 24 minutes. He increased his averages to 19.1 points and 9.9 rebounds in 2001–02, and again in 2002–03 to 21.2 points with 9.5 rebounds. He was named an NBA All-Star for the first time in 2003.

In 2003–04, Marion averaged 19.0 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 2.1 steals, 1.3 blocks and 40.7 minutes in 79 games (79 starts). He led the NBA in total steals (167) and joined 2003–04 MVP Kevin Garnett as the only two players to rank in the top 30 in scoring (19th), rebounds (14th), steals (2nd), blocks (27th) and minutes (2nd). Following the season, he played for the U.S. national team at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

In 2004–05, Marion started all 81 games for the Suns in which he appeared and averaged 19.4 points (.476 FG%, .833 FT%), 11.3 rebounds, 2.01 steals, 1.9 assists, 1.47 blocks and 38.8 minutes. He was named Western Conference Player of the Week twice (weeks ending November 28 and December 19), was named a reserve on the Western Conference All-Star Team, and was selected to the All-NBA Third Team. He was the only player in 2004–05 to be ranked in the top 25 in scoring (23rd), rebounding (3rd), steals (4th), blocks (23rd) and minutes (9th). He also became only the second player in NBA history (joining David Robinson, 1991–92) to rank in the top five in rebounding and steals in the same season since the league began tracking steals in 1973–74. During NBA All-Star Weekend, he was a member of the Phoenix team that won the Shooting Stars Competition.
In 2005–06, Marion started each of the 81 games he appeared in for the Suns and averaged 21.8 points (.525 FG%, .809 FT%), 11.8 rebounds, 1.98 steals, 1.8 assists, 1.69 blocks and 40.3 minutes. He was named Western Conference Player of the Month for the month of February, and was named Western Conference Player of the Week for the week ending January 1. He was once again named a reserve on the Western Conference All-Star Team and was selected to the All-NBA Third Team for the second consecutive year. He became the first player in NBA history to finish in the top five in both rebounding and steals in consecutive years since the 1973–74 season. He was joined by Kevin Garnett, Elton Brand and Yao Ming as the only players in the NBA to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in the 2005–06 season. On February 22, 2006, he scored a career-high 44 points against the Boston Celtics. He became only the second Suns player in franchise history (after Charles Barkley) to record three consecutive 30-point/15-rebound games (February 22–27). He also became the first Sun since Barkley to record a 30-point/20-rebound game with 31 points and an NBA season-high (and personal career-high) 24 rebounds against the Charlotte Bobcats on February 25.

In 2006–07, Marion led the NBA in total steals (156) and received seven first place votes and finished fourth in the voting for Defensive Player of the Year. He scored his 10,000th career point in the season-opener against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 31, 2006. He was once again named a reserve on the Western Conference All-Star Team.

In September 2007, with trade rumors swirling around him, Marion declared he wanted out of Phoenix. Marion had been mentioned in trade scenarios involving the Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Lakers. He said he would welcome a trade to the Lakers to play with his good friend Kobe Bryant. During the summer, Marion had reportedly prevented a three-team deal that would have sent him to Boston with an extension, Garnett to Phoenix, and draft picks to Minnesota.

On November 9, 2007, Marion tied his career high with 24 rebounds in the Suns&#x27; 106–101 win over the Miami Heat.

===Miami Heat (2008–2009)===
On February 6, 2008, Marion was acquired by the Miami Heat, along with Marcus Banks, from the Suns in exchange for Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. On March 8, 2008, he participated in the first replayed NBA game since 1982, as the Heat played the Atlanta Hawks to settle a disputed last 51.9 seconds from their encounter on December 19, 2007. Marion, who had played for the Suns on December 19 and participated in the replayed 51.9 seconds, officially went down as having played for two different teams on the same day.

=== Toronto Raptors (2009) ===
On February 13, 2009, Marion and Banks were traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Jermaine O&#x27;Neal and Jamario Moon. On April 16, Marion scored a season-high 34 points and grabbed 11 rebounds during a 109–98 win over the Bulls, during the last game of the season.

===Dallas Mavericks (2009–2014)===

On July 9, 2009, Marion was acquired by the Dallas Mavericks in a sign-and-trade deal with the Raptors, with Marion receiving a five-year contract worth an estimated $39 million. Marion was a steady performer for the Mavericks during the 2009–10 season, but he was not a primary option. His average of 12 points per game was the lowest since his rookie season. He also averaged a career-low 6.4 rebounds per game.

Having been a starter his whole career, Marion was relegated to a bench role for the 2010–11 season, with Caron Butler taking over the starting small forward position. However, Butler sustained a season-ending injury on January 1, 2011, and by the end of the season, Marion was starting again. Marion was the Mavericks&#x27; starting small forward throughout their playoff run, a run that resulted in a trip to the NBA Finals. In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Marion scored 26 points. In the NBA Finals, Marion helped the Mavericks defeat the Miami Heat in six games to win their maiden NBA championship. Marion averaged 13.7 points, 6.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists during the six games, with his best effort coming in Game 2 when he had 20 points. During the season, Marion joined Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, Kevin Garnett and Julius Erving as the only players with 1,500 steals and 1,000 blocks.

In the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Marion was the only player or shorter to lead his team in rebounding (7.4 rpg, 465 total rebounds). He became the first Maverick or shorter to lead Dallas in rebounding since Jay Vincent did so in 1984–85 (8.9 rpg). On March 13, 2012, against the Washington Wizards, Marion moved into 100th place on the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list.

On December 18, 2012, against the Phoenix Suns, Marion eclipsed the 16,000-point plateau, becoming the 95th player in league history with at least 16,000 career points. He joined Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone and Kevin Garnett as the only players in NBA history with at least 16,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals and 1,000 blocks. On January 27, 2013, against Phoenix, Marion played in his 1,000th NBA game, becoming the 107th player in NBA history to reach the milestone. On March 6, 2013, against the Houston Rockets, Marion passed Rod Strickland for 25th place on the NBA&#x27;s all-time steals list.

On January 3, 2014, against the Los Angeles Clippers, Marion passed the 17,000-point mark and joined Olajuwon, Malone and Garnett as the only players with at least 17,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals and 1,000 blocks. For the 2013–14 season, Marion posted a career-low 13.4 PER, struggled with consistency on offense, and struggled defensively at times.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (2014–2015)===
On September 9, 2014, Marion signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers. In December 2014, he became the first player in NBA history with 15,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, 1,000 blocks and 500 3-pointers. On January 21, 2015, Marion announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2014–15 season. Marion missed time in February and March with a strained left hip. Marion returned to the NBA Finals in June 2015; however, he did not appear in any of the Cavaliers&#x27; six games, a series Cleveland lost 4–2 to the Golden State Warriors.

On June 18, 2015, Marion announced his retirement from the NBA after 16 seasons.

==National team career==
Marion played for the United States national team at the 2001 Goodwill Games in Brisbane, 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis, and 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, winning gold in Brisbane and bronze in Athens.

<text>The Battle of the Bismarck Sea (2–4 March 1943) took place in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) during World War II when aircraft of the U.S. Fifth Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) attacked a Japanese convoy carrying troops to Lae, New Guinea. Most of the Japanese task force was destroyed, and Japanese troop losses were heavy.

The Japanese convoy was a result of a Japanese Imperial General Headquarters decision in December 1942 to reinforce their position in the South West Pacific. A plan was devised to move some 6,900 troops from Rabaul directly to Lae. The plan was understood to be risky, because Allied air power in the area was strong, but it was decided to proceed because otherwise the troops would have to be landed a considerable distance away and march through inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads before reaching their destination. On 28 February 1943, the convoy – comprising eight destroyers and eight troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighter aircraft – set out from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul.

The Allies had detected preparations for the convoy, and naval codebreakers in Melbourne (FRUMEL) and Washington, D.C., had decrypted and translated messages indicating the convoy&#x27;s intended destination and date of arrival. The Allied Air Forces had developed new techniques, such as skip bombing, that they hoped would improve the chances of successful air attack on ships. They detected and shadowed the convoy, which came under sustained air attack on 2–3 March 1943. Follow-up attacks by PT boats and aircraft were made on 4 March on life boats and rafts. All eight transports and four of the escorting destroyers were sunk. Of 6,900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea, only about 1,200 made it to Lae. Another 2,700 were rescued by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul. The Japanese made no further attempts to reinforce Lae by ship, greatly hindering their ultimately unsuccessful efforts to stop Allied offensives in New Guinea.

==Background==

===Allied offensives===
Six months after Imperial Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the United States won a strategic victory at the Battle of Midway in June 1942. Seizing the strategic initiative, the United States and its Allies landed on Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands in August 1942, beginning the Solomon Islands Campaign. The battle for Guadalcanal ended in victory for the Allies with the withdrawal of Japanese forces from the island in early February 1943. At the same time, Australian and American forces in New Guinea repelled the Japanese land offensive along the Kokoda Track. Going on the offensive, the Allied forces captured Buna–Gona, destroying Japanese forces in that area.

The ultimate goal of the Allied counter-offensives in New Guinea and the Solomons was to capture the main Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain, later codified as Operation Cartwheel, and clear the way for the eventual reconquest of the Philippines. Recognising the threat, the Japanese continued to send land, naval, and aerial reinforcements to the area in an attempt to check the Allied advances.

===Japanese plans===
Reviewing the progress of the Battle of Guadalcanal and the Battle of Buna–Gona in December 1942, the Japanese faced the prospect that neither could be held. Accordingly, Imperial General Headquarters decided to take steps to strengthen the Japanese position in the South West Pacific by sending Lieutenant General Jusei Aoki&#x27;s 20th Division from Korea to Guadalcanal and Lieutenant General Heisuke Abe&#x27;s 41st Division from China to Rabaul. Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura, the commander of the Japanese Eighth Area Army at Rabaul, ordered Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi&#x27;s XVIII Army to secure Madang, Wewak and Tuluvu in New Guinea. On 29 December, Adachi ordered the 102nd Infantry Regiment and other units under the command of Major General Tōru Okabe, the commander of the infantry group of the 51st Division, to move from Rabaul to Lae and advance inland to capture Wau. After deciding to evacuate Guadalcanal on 4 January, the Japanese switched priorities from the Solomon Islands to New Guinea, and opted to send the 20th and 41st Divisions to Wewak.
On 5 January 1943, the convoy, which consisted of five destroyers and five troop transports carrying Okabe&#x27;s force, set out for Lae from Rabaul. Forewarned by Ultra, United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft spotted, shadowed and attacked the convoy, which was shielded by low clouds and Japanese fighters. The Allies claimed to have shot down 69 Japanese aircraft for the loss of 10 of their own. An RAAF Consolidated PBY Catalina sank the transport . Although destroyers rescued 739 of the 1,100 troops on board, the ship took with it all of Okabe&#x27;s medical supplies. Another transport, , was so badly damaged at Lae by USAAF North American B-25 Mitchells that it had to be beached. Nonetheless, the convoy succeeded in reaching Lae on 7 January and landing its troops, but Okabe was defeated in the Battle of Wau.

Most of the 20th Division was landed at Wewak from naval high speed transports on 19 January 1943. The bulk of the 41st Division followed on 12 February. Imamura and Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa, the commander of the South East Area Fleet, developed a plan to move the command post of the headquarters of the Japanese XVIII Army and the main body of the 51st Division from Rabaul to Lae on 3 March, followed by moving the remainder of the 20th Division to Madang on 10 March. This plan was acknowledged to be risky because Allied air power in the area was strong. The XVIII Army staff held war games that predicted losses of four out of ten transports, and between 30 and 40 aircraft. They gave the operation only a 50–50 chance of success. On the other hand, if the troops were landed at Madang, they faced a march of more than over inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads. To augment the three naval and two army fighter groups in the area assigned to protect the convoy, the Imperial Japanese Navy temporarily detached 18 fighters from the aircraft carrier &#x27;s fighter group from Truk to Kavieng.

===Allied intelligence===
The Allies soon began detecting signs of preparations for a new convoy. A Japanese floatplane of the type normally used for anti-submarine patrols in advance of convoys was sighted on 7 February 1943. The Allied Air Forces South West Pacific Area commander – Lieutenant General George Kenney – ordered an increase in reconnaissance patrols over Rabaul. On 14 February, aerial photographs were taken that showed 79 vessels in port, including 45 merchant ships and six transports. It was clear that another convoy was being prepared, but its destination was unknown. On 16 February, naval codebreakers in Melbourne (FRUMEL) and Washington, D.C., finished decrypting and translating a coded message revealing the Japanese intention to land convoys at Wewak, Madang and Lae. Subsequently, codebreakers decrypted a message from the Japanese 11th Air Fleet to the effect that destroyers and six transports would reach Lae about 5 March. Another report indicated that they would reach Lae by 12 March. On 22 February, reconnaissance aircraft reported 59 merchant vessels in the harbour at Rabaul.

Kenney read this Ultra intelligence in the office of the Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area – General Douglas MacArthur – on 25 February. The prospect of an additional 6,900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur, as they might seriously affect his plans to capture and develop the area. Kenney wrote out orders, which were sent by courier, for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) in New Guinea. Under the Fifth Air Force&#x27;s unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea. This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt.

Kenney informed Whitehead of the proposed convoy date, and warned him about the usual Japanese pre-convoy air attack. He also urged that flying hours be cut back so as to allow for a large strike on the convoy, and instructed him to move forward as many aircraft as possible so that they could be close to the nearby captured airfields around Dobodura, where they would not be subject to the vagaries of weather over the Owen Stanley Range. Kenney flew up to Port Moresby on 26 February, where he met with Whitehead. The two generals inspected fighter and bomber units in the area, and agreed to attack the Japanese convoy in the Vitiaz Strait. Kenney returned to Brisbane on 28 February.

==Allied tactics==
In the South West Pacific, a conventional strategic bombing campaign was out of the question, as industrial targets in Japan were well beyond the range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Therefore, the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged; clearly, a change of tactics was in order. Group Captain Bill Garing, an RAAF officer on Kenney&#x27;s staff with considerable experience in air-sea operations, including a tour of duty in Europe, recommended that Japanese convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes and directions.

The Allied Air Forces adopted some innovative tactics. In February 1942, the RAAF began experimenting with skip bombing, an anti-shipping technique used by the British and Germans. Flying only a few dozen feet above the sea toward their targets, bombers would release their bombs which would then, ideally, ricochet across the surface of the water and explode at the side of the target ship, under it, or just over it. A similar technique was mast-height bombing, in which bombers would approach the target at low altitude, , at about , and then drop down to mast height, at about from the target. They would release their bombs at around , aiming directly at the side of the ship. The Battle of the Bismarck Sea would demonstrate that this was the more successful of the two tactics. The two techniques were not mutually exclusive: a bomber could drop two bombs, skipping the first and launching the second at mast height. In addition, as regular bomb fuses were designed to detonate immediately on impact, which would catch the attacking aircraft in its own bomb blast at low altitude attacks, crews developed a delayed-action fuse. Practice missions were carried out against the wreck of the , a liner that had run aground in 1923.

In order for bombers to conduct skip or mast-height bombing, the target ship&#x27;s antiaircraft artillery would first have to be neutralized by strafing runs. For the latter task, Major Paul I. &quot;Pappy&quot; Gunn and his men at the 81st Depot Repair Squadron in Townsville, Queensland, modified some USAAF Douglas A-20 Havoc light bombers by installing four machine guns in their noses in September 1942. Two fuel tanks were added, giving the aircraft more range. An attempt was then made in December 1942 to create a longer range attack aircraft by doing the same thing to a B-25 medium bomber to convert it to a &quot;commerce destroyer&quot;, but this proved to be somewhat more difficult. The resulting aircraft was nose-heavy despite added lead ballast in the tail, and the vibrations caused by firing the machine guns were enough to make rivets pop out of the skin of the aircraft. The tail guns and belly turrets were removed, the latter being of little use if the aircraft was flying low. The new tactic of having the B-25 strafe ships would be tried in this battle.

The Fifth Air Force had two heavy bomber groups. The 43rd Bombardment Group was equipped with about 55 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. Most of these had seen hard war service over the previous six months and the availability rate was low. The recently arrived 90th Bombardment Group was equipped with Consolidated B-24 Liberators, but they too had maintenance problems. There were two medium groups: the 38th Bombardment Group, equipped with B-25 Mitchells, and the 22nd Bombardment Group, equipped with Martin B-26 Marauders, but two of the former&#x27;s four squadrons had been diverted to the South Pacific Area, and the latter had taken so many losses that it had been withdrawn to Australia to be rebuilt.

There was also a light group, the 3rd Attack Group, equipped with a mixture of Douglas A-20 Havocs and B-25 Mitchells. This group was not just short of aircraft; it was critically short of aircrew as well. To make up the numbers the USAAF turned to the RAAF for help. Australian aircrew were assigned to most of the group&#x27;s aircraft, serving in every role except aircraft commander. In addition to the RAAF aircrew with the USAAF squadrons, there were RAAF units in the Port Moresby area. No. 30 Squadron RAAF, which had arrived in Port Moresby in September 1942, was equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter. Both the aircraft and the squadron proved adept at low level attacks. Also in the Port Moresby area were the 35th and 49th Fighter Groups, both equipped with Bell P-39, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters, but only the last were suitable for long range escort missions.

==Battle==

===First attacks===
The Japanese convoy – comprising eight destroyers and eight troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighters – assembled and departed from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul on 28 February. During the January operation, a course was followed that hugged the south coast of New Britain. This had made it easy to provide air cover, but being close to the airfields also made it possible for the Allied air forces to attack both the convoy and the airfields at the same time. This time, a route was chosen along the north coast, in the hope that the Allies would be deceived into thinking that the convoy&#x27;s objective was Madang. Allied air attacks on the convoy at this point would have to fly over New Britain, allowing interdiction from Japanese air bases there, but the final leg of the voyage would be particularly dangerous, because the convoy would have to negotiate the restricted waters of Vitiaz Strait. The Japanese named the convoy &quot;Operation 81.&quot;
The destroyers carried 958 troops, while the transports took 5,954. All the ships were combat loaded to expedite unloading at Lae. The commander of the Japanese XVIII Army – Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi – travelled on the destroyer , while that of the 51st Division – Lieutenant General Hidemitsu Nakano – was on board the destroyer . The escort commander – Rear Admiral Masatomi Kimura of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla – flew his flag from the destroyer . The other five destroyers were , , , and . They escorted seven Army transports: (2,716 gross register tons), (950 tons), (5,493 tons), (6,494 tons), (3,793 tons), (2,883 tons) and (6,870 tons). Rounding out the force was the lone Navy transport (8,125 tons). All the ships carried troops, equipment and ammunition, except for the &quot;Kembu Maru&quot;, which carried 1,000 drums of avgas and 650 drums of other fuel.

The convoy, moving at , was not detected for some time, because of two tropical storms that struck the Solomon and Bismarck Seas between 27 February and 1 March, but at about 15:00 on 1 March, the crew of a patrolling B-24 Liberator heavy bomber spotted the convoy. Eight B-17 Flying Fortresses were sent to the location but failed to locate the ships.
At dawn on 2 March, a force of six RAAF A-20 Bostons attacked Lae to reduce its ability to provide support. At about 10:00, another Liberator found the convoy. Eight B-17s took off to attack the ships, followed an hour later by another 20. The B-17s were planned to rendezvous with P-38 fighters from the 9th Fighter Squadron, but the B-17s arrived early and faced the Japanese fighters on their own for the initial air battle until the P-38s arrived. They found the convoy and attacked with bombs from . They claimed to have sunk up to three merchant ships. &quot;Kyokusei Maru&quot; had sunk, carrying 1,200 army troops, and two other transports, &quot;Teiyo Maru&quot; and &quot;Nojima&quot;, were damaged. Eight Japanese fighters were destroyed and 13 damaged in the day&#x27;s action, while nine B-17s were damaged.

The destroyers &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and &quot;Asagumo&quot; plucked 950 survivors of &quot;Kyokusei Maru&quot; from the water. These two destroyers, being faster than the convoy since its speed was dictated by the slower transports, broke away from the group to disembark the survivors at Lae. The destroyers resumed their escort duties the next day. The convoy – without the troop transport and two destroyers – was attacked again on the evening of 2 March by 11 B-17s, with minor damage to one transport. During the night, PBY Catalina flying boats from No. 11 Squadron RAAF took over the task of shadowing the convoy.

===Further attacks===
By 3 March, the convoy was within range of the air base at Milne Bay, and eight Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers from No. 100 Squadron RAAF took off from there. Because of bad weather only two found the convoy, and neither scored any hits, but the weather cleared after they rounded the Huon Peninsula. A force of 90 Allied aircraft took off from Port Moresby, and headed for Cape Ward Hunt, while 22 A-20 Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF attacked the Japanese fighter base at Lae, reducing the convoy&#x27;s air cover. Attacks on the base continued throughout the day.

At 10:00, 13 B-17s reached the convoy and bombed from medium altitude of 7,000 feet, causing the ships to maneuver, which dispersed the convoy and reduced their concentrated anti-aircraft firepower. The B-17s attracted Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, which were in turn attacked by the P-38 Lightning escorts. A B-17 broke up in the air, and its crew took to their parachutes. Japanese fighter pilots machine-gunned some of the B-17 crew members as they descended and attacked others in the water after they landed. Five of the Japanese fighters strafing the B-17 aircrew were promptly engaged and shot down by three P-38s which were also lost. The Allied fighter pilots claimed 15 Zeros destroyed, while the B-17 crews claimed five more. Actual Japanese fighter losses for the day were seven destroyed and three damaged. B-25s arrived shortly afterward and released their 500-pound bombs between 3,000 and 6,000 feet, reportedly causing two Japanese vessels to collide. The result of the B-17 and B-25 sorties scored few hits but left the convoy ships separated, making them vulnerable to strafers and masthead bombers, and with the Japanese anti-aircraft fire being focused on the medium-altitude bombers this left an opening for minimum-altitude attacks.

The 13 Beaufighters from No. 30 Squadron RAAF approached the convoy at low level to give the impression they were Beauforts making a torpedo attack. The ships turned to face them, the standard procedure to present a smaller target to torpedo bombers, allowing the Beaufighters to maximise the damage they inflicted on the ships&#x27; anti-aircraft guns, bridges and crews in strafing runs with their four nose cannons and six wing-mounted machine guns. On board one of the Beaufighters was cameraman Damien Parer, who shot dramatic footage of the battle; it was later included in the newsreel &quot;The Bismarck Convoy Smashed&quot;. Immediately afterward, seven B-25s of the 38th Bombardment Group&#x27;s 71st Bombardment Squadron bombed from about , while six from the 405th Bombardment Squadron attacked at mast height.

According to the official RAAF release on the Beaufighter attack, &quot;enemy crews were slain beside their guns, deck cargo burst into flame, superstructures toppled and burned&quot;. Garrett Middlebrook, a co-pilot in one of the B-25s, described the ferocity of the strafing attacks: 

&quot;Shirayuki&quot; was the first ship to be hit, by a combination of strafing and bombing attacks. Almost all the men on the bridge became casualties, including Kimura, who was wounded. One bomb hit started a magazine explosion that caused the stern to break off, and the ship to sink. Her crew was transferred to &quot;Shikinami&quot;, and &quot;Shirayuki&quot; was scuttled. The destroyer &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot; was also hit and fatally damaged. Its crew was taken off by &quot;Yukikaze&quot;. The destroyer &quot;Arashio&quot; was hit, and collided with the transport &quot;Nojima&quot;, disabling her. Both the destroyer and the transport were abandoned, and &quot;Nojima&quot; was later sunk by an air attack.
Fourteen B-25s returned that afternoon, reportedly claiming 17 hits or near misses. By this time, a third of the transports were sunk or sinking. As the Beaufighters and B-25s had expended their munitions, some USAAF A-20 Havocs of the 3rd Attack Group joined in. Another five hits were claimed by B-17s of the 43rd Bombardment Group from higher altitudes. During the afternoon, further attacks from USAAF B-25s and Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF followed.

All seven of the transports were hit and most were burning or sinking about southeast of Finschhafen, along with the destroyers &quot;Shirayuki&quot;, &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot; and &quot;Arashio&quot;. Four of the destroyers – &quot;Shikinami&quot;, &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, &quot;Uranami&quot; and &quot;Asagumo&quot; – picked up as many survivors as they could and then retired to Rabaul, accompanied by the destroyer , which had come from Rabaul to assist. That night, a force of ten U.S. Navy PT boats – under the command of Lieutenant Commander Barry Atkins – set out to attack the convoy. Two boats struck submerged debris and were forced to return. The other eight arrived off Lae in the early hours of 4 March. Atkins spotted a fire that turned out to be the transport &quot;Oigawa Maru&quot;. &quot;PT-143&quot; and &quot;PT-150&quot; fired torpedoes at it, sinking the crippled vessel. In the morning, a fourth destroyer – &quot;Asashio&quot; – was sunk when a B-17 hit her with a bomb while she was picking up survivors from &quot;Arashio&quot;. Only one destroyer, &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, was undamaged among the four surviving destroyers.
Some 2,700 survivors were taken to Rabaul by the destroyers. On 4 March, another 1,000 or so survivors were adrift on rafts. On the evenings of 3–5 March, PT boats and planes attacked Japanese rescue vessels, as well as the survivors from the sunken vessels on life rafts and swimming or floating in the sea. This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination and promptly returned to active service, as well as being retaliation for the Japanese fighter planes attacking survivors of the downed B-17 bomber. While many of the Allied aircrew accepted these attacks as being necessary, others were sickened. On 6 March, the Japanese submarines and picked up 170 survivors. Two days later, &quot;I-26&quot; found another 54 and put them ashore at Lae. Hundreds made their way to various islands. One band of 18 survivors landed on Kiriwina, where they were captured by &quot;PT-114&quot;. Another made its way to Guadalcanal, only to be killed by an American patrol.

On 4 March the Japanese mounted a retaliatory raid on the Buna airfield, the site of a base that the Allies had captured back in January, though the fighters did little damage. Kenney wrote in his memoir that the Japanese reprisal occurred &quot;after the horse had been stolen from the barn. It was a good thing that the Nip air commander was stupid. Those hundred airplanes would have made our job awfully hard if they had taken part in the big fight over the convoy on March 3rd.&quot;

On Goodenough Island, between 8 and 14 March 1943, Australian patrols from the 47th Infantry Battalion found and killed 72 Japanese, captured 42 and found another nine dead on a raft. One patrol killed eight Japanese who had landed in two flat-bottomed boats, in which were found some documents in sealed tins. On translation by the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section, one document turned out to be a copy of the Japanese Army List, with the names and postings of every officer in the Japanese Army. It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army, including many units that had never before been reported. A mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit. Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan.

==Aftermath==
The battle was a disaster for the Japanese. Out of 6,900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea, only about 1,200 made it to Lae. Another 2,700 were saved by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul. About 2,890 Japanese soldiers and sailors were killed. The Allies lost 13 aircrew, 10 of whom were lost in combat while three others died in an accident. There were also eight wounded. Aircraft losses were one B-17 and three P-38s in combat, and one B-25 and one Beaufighter in accidents. MacArthur issued a communiqué on 7 March stating that 22 ships, including twelve transports, three cruisers and seven destroyers, had been sunk along with 12,792 troops. Army Air Force Headquarters in Washington, D.C., looked into the matter in mid-1943 and concluded that there were only 16 ships involved, but GHQ SWPA considered the original account accurate. The victory was a propaganda boon for the Allies, with one United States newsreel claiming the Japanese had lost 22 ships, 15,000 troops, and 102 aircraft. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, on its front page on March 4, 1943, cited the loss by the Japanese of 22 ships, 15,000 troops and 55 aircraft.

The Allied Air Forces had used 233,847 rounds of ammunition, and dropped two-hundred and sixty-one 500-pound and two-hundred and fifty-three 1,000-pound bombs. They claimed 19 hits and 42 near misses with the former and 59 hits and 39 near misses from the latter. Of the 137 bombs dropped in low level attacks, 48 (35 percent) were claimed to have hit but only 29 (7.5 percent) of the 387 bombs dropped from medium altitude. This compared favourably with efforts in August and September 1942 when only 3 percent of bombs dropped were claimed to have scored hits. It was noted that the high and medium altitude attacks scored few hits but dispersed the convoy, while the strafing runs from the Beaufighters had knocked out many of the ships&#x27; anti-aircraft defences. Aircraft attacking from several directions at once had confused and overwhelmed the Japanese defences, resulting in lower casualties and more accurate bombing. The results therefore vindicated not just the tactics of mast height attack but of mounting coordinated attacks from several directions. The Japanese estimated that at least 29 bombs had hit a ship during the battle. This was a big improvement over the Battle of Wau back in January, when Allied aircraft attacked a Japanese convoy consisting of five destroyers and five troop transports travelling from Rabaul to Lae, but managed to sink just one transport and beach another.
Imamura&#x27;s chief of staff flew to Imperial General Headquarters to report on the disaster. It was decided that there would be no more attempts to land troops at Lae. The losses incurred in the Bismarck Sea caused grave concern for the security of Lae and Rabaul and resulted in a change of strategy. On 25 March a joint Army-Navy Central Agreement on South West Area Operations gave operations in New Guinea priority over those in the Solomon Islands campaign. The XVIII Army was allocated additional shipping, ordnance and anti-aircraft units, which were sent to Wewak or Hansa Bay. Of the defeat, Rabaul staff officer Masatake Okumiya said, &quot;Our losses for this single battle were fantastic. Not during the entire savage fighting at Guadalcanal did we suffer a single comparable blow. We knew we could no longer run cargo ships or even fast destroyer transports to any front on the north coast of New Guinea, east of Wewak&quot;.

The planned movement of the 20th Division to Madang was revised in the light of events in the Bismarck Sea. The operation was postponed for two days, and the destination was altered from Madang to Hansa Bay further west. To reduce the Allied air threat, the Allied airfield at Wau was bombed on 9 March and that at Dobodura on 11 March. Three Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground and one P-40 was lost in the air but Allied fighters claimed nine Japanese aircraft. The transports reached Hansa Bay unscathed on 12 March and the troops made their way down to Madang on foot or in barges. The 20th Division then became involved in an attempt to construct a road from Madang to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys. It toiled on the road for the next few months but its efforts were ultimately frustrated by the New Guinea weather and the rugged terrain of the Finisterre Range.

Some submarines were made available for supply runs to Lae but they did not have the capacity to support the troops there by themselves. An operation was carried out on 29 March in which four destroyers delivered 800 troops to Finschhafen but the growing threat from Allied aircraft led to the development of routes along the coast of New Guinea from Madang to Finschhafen and along the north and south coasts of New Britain to Finschhafen, thence to Lae using Army landing craft. It was by this means that the remainder of the 51st Division finally made the trip to Lae in May. The necessity of delivering troops and supplies to the front in this manner caused immense difficulties for the Japanese in their attempts to halt further Allied advances. After the war, Japanese officers at Rabaul estimated that around 20,000 troops were lost in transit to New Guinea from Rabaul, a significant factor in Japan&#x27;s ultimate defeat in the New Guinea campaign.

In April, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto used the additional air resources allocated to Rabaul in Operation I-Go, an air offensive designed to redress the situation by destroying Allied ships and aircraft in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The operation was indecisive and Yamamoto became a casualty of Allied intelligence and air power in the Solomon Islands on 18 April 1943.

==Game theory==
In 1954, O. G. Haywood Jr., wrote an article in the &quot;Journal of the Operations Research Society of America&quot; in which game theory was used to model the decision-making in the battle. Since then, the name of the battle has been applied to this particular type of two-person zero-sum game.

As a very brief summary, the scenario modeled revolves around the decision Lt. General Kenney had to make just prior to the real-life battle. The Japanese commander had to choose one out of two courses of action: sail his convoy north of the New Britain island, or south of it. General Kenney likewise had to choose: focus any reconnaissance efforts north of the island, or south of it. This means there are four possible outcomes, and game theory explains Gen. Kenney&#x27;s real-life decision to concentrate his reconnaissance airplanes north of New Britain.

<text>U.S. Route 163 (also U.S. Highway 163, US 163) is a U.S. Highway that runs from US 160 northward to US 191 in the U.S. states of Arizona and Utah. The southernmost of its length are within the Navajo Nation. The highway forms part of the Trail of the Ancients, a National Scenic Byway. The highway cuts through the heart of Monument Valley and has been featured in numerous movies and commercials.

The highway was designated in 1970, replacing Arizona State Route 464 and Utah State Route 47 as well as a portion of the old alignment of US 160 in Utah. In 1981, US 191 was routed over the northern section of US 163, effectively truncating the northern terminus to Bluff, Utah, from Crescent Junction. The state of Utah briefly had plans for a different routing of US 163 north of Bluff. These plans were rejected, resulting in discrepancies between the signed route and the official designation by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that were not resolved until 2008. The route number does not follow the numbering convention for U.S. Highways, as the number 163 would normally be used for a spur of US 63; however, these two highways have never connected.

==Route description==
===Arizona===

The southern terminus of US 163 is at a junction with US 160 south of Kayenta in Navajo County and Navajo Nation. The road continues to the south of this junction as Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Route 591. US 163 heads north from US 160 to the west of the Kayenta Airport as it passes through the town of Kayenta. The highway curves toward the northeast in Kayenta before it curves back toward the north. As it continues north, the highway goes through an s-curve, resulting in a northeasterly heading. US 163 continues this heading as it heads toward Monument Valley and crosses into Utah. The state of Arizona has designated an stretch of the highway, from approximately north of the US 160 junction to the Utah border, as a scenic route.

===Utah===

The Utah portion of the highway begins in Monument Valley, in San Juan County. Just after it enters Utah, the highway junctions with the Monument Valley Visitors center. The highway proceeds northeast until the town of Mexican Hat where the highway both crosses the San Juan River and exits the Navajo Nation. From Mexican Hat, the highway travels east crossing the Comb Ridge toward its terminus in Bluff. A significant portion of the Utah portion of the route north of the Navajo Nation is inside the boundaries of the Bears Ears National Monument. Formerly, the route continued along what is now signed US 191 to I-70, however the portion north of Bluff was not signed after the creation of US 191 and was formally removed in 2008. The length of US 163 in Utah has been designated the Bluff to Monument Valley Scenic Byway by the Utah State Legislature and forms part of the Trail of the Ancients National Scenic Byway. All highways in Utah are codified in law; US 163 is defined at Utah Code §72-4-122(3). While Monument Valley and US 163 have been featured in numerous western movies, a specific view area near Utah mile marker 13 has recently been given the nickname &quot;Forrest Gump hill&quot;, as a location from the movie Forrest Gump. It has become common for fans of the film to re-create the scene where the title character ends a cross country jogging along this point on US 163.

==History==

The modern routing of US 163 in Utah was initially designated as State Route 47, in 1910. SR 47 extended to Monticello at a junction with then U.S. Route 160. In Arizona, the road appeared on maps as early as 1935, but it was an unimproved dirt road. The Arizona portion was added to the state highway system in 1960 when it was designated as State Route 464.

In 1970, US 163 was designated along SR 464 in Arizona and SR 47 in Utah as part of a re-alignment of U.S. highways in the Four Corners region. With the re-alignment, US 160 was re-routed into Arizona instead of Utah. US 163 also absorbed the former route of US 160 to its former terminus at Interstate 70 at Crescent Junction. In 1981, AASHTO approved a new iteration of U.S. Route 191 that absorbed much of the alignment of US 163. Utah truncated US 163 at Bluff. The truncation was made without approval from AASHTO, as the AASHTO logs placed the northern terminus of US 163 at I-70 at Crescent Junction.
The state of Utah signed a joint intent with the Navajo Nation and San Juan County in 1986 to construct a new highway to connect Bluff with Montezuma Creek. Businesses in Monument Valley asked the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) to request extensions of US 163 and US 666 using this new road. The proposal would have US 163 run from Cedar City to US 160 near Cortez, Colorado along the routes of State Route 14, U.S. Route 89, Arizona State Route 98, U.S. Route 160, the current US 163, the new road from Bluff to Montezuma Creek, and Colorado State Highway 41. The proposal for US 666 would extend to Richfield via upgrades to State Route 95 and State Route 24. UDOT submitted the proposal for US 666 to AASHTO, which was rejected. AASHTO cited that the route was not direct, and SR-24 was not built to U.S. Highway standards. UDOT did not pursue the extension of US 163, even though the Utah state legislature had approved the new road from Bluff to Montezuma creek as route 163.

With this extension, the Utah definition of US 163 conflicted with the AASHTO definition. UDOT resolved this discrepancy by signing the extended portion as State Route 163. In 2004, the plan to extend US 163 was abandoned, and the extension was renumbered SR-162 to &quot;make the state route numbers run synonymous with the U.S. route designation.&quot; Although the state changed the definition of US 163 back to match the national definition in 2004, the portion north of Bluff remained unsigned. In October 2008, UDOT requested and obtained approval to truncate US 163 to the junction with US 191 resolving the discrepancy.

The highway corridor became controversial in 2016 with the designation of Bears Ears National Monument. The area near where US 163 crosses the Comb Ridge was included in some versions of the monument proposal, but excluded as a concession to local concerns in other versions. The proclamation signed by President Obama in 2016 did not include the Comb Ridge area, however, was included with subsequent boundary changes by succeeding presidents.

<text>Tarabish, also known by its slang term &quot;bish&quot;, is a Canadian trick-taking card game of complex rules derived from belote, a game of the Jass family. The name is pronounced &quot;tar-bish&quot;, despite the spelling. It is played primarily by the people of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, in Canada, where, according to one source, it was brought in 1901 by a Lebanese immigrant George Shebib. On the other hand, following comprehensive research Kennedy (1996) states that opinions as to its origin vary and that no &quot;definitive roots may ever be determined.&quot;

==Object==

The game is over when one or both teams accumulate 500 points or more. Points are counted at the end of each hand and both teams always count their points. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.

===The deck===
A tarabish deck consists of a normal English pattern deck of playing cards with the 2 through 5 of each suit removed. In preparation for the hand the dealer shuffles the cards in the usual manner. When finished the person to the right of the dealer cuts the cards. The cutter must leave at least four cards in each portion of the deck. Once the cards have been cut, no further shuffling is allowed. Bespoke tarabish packs were produced by Ocean of Sydney, Nova Scotia in the 1970s. These contained 40 cards (6–A in each suit) together with a rules leaflet.

The 36 tarabish cards are dealt in groups of three beginning with eldest hand (the player to the left of the dealer) and proceeding clockwise until all the cards are dealt. The four players look at their first six cards; the last three, called the kitty, remain face down until after the auction is over and a trump suit has been chosen.

===Cards value===
In the plain suits, cards rank and score in the standard ace–ten order; in the trump suit the Jack and Nine are promoted above the ace to become the highest two cards with correspondingly higher card point values.

===The bid===
There is an auction to determine the trump suit for the hand. Eldest hand opens the bidding to choose the trump suit. If eldest passes, the decision passes to the next person and so on. In the most popular variation, if the bid reaches the dealer, the dealer is forced to choose a trump suit. The less popular variation allows the dealer to pass in which case the hand is complete and the deal passes to the next player.

The team that &#x27;goes&#x27; must accumulate more than half of the points for that hand. If they get fewer than half, it is a &#x27;bait&#x27; or &#x27;bate&#x27; and their points go to their opponents. If they get exactly half the points it is a &#x27;half-bait&#x27; in which case they score zero while their opponents of course get to score their own points.

===The play===
Play begins with eldest hand and proceeds clockwise until each player has played a card. Each player must follow suit by playing a card of the same suit as the first card of each trick. A player who does not have a card of the same suit must play a trump if able. Lacking both, a player may play any card. Players must always head the trick if possible, i.e. on playing a trump they must overtrump any trumps already played. The person who played the highest card to the trick collects the cards and leads to the next trick.

It is important collect tricks neatly as they may need to be referred to in the event of a misplay. Completed tricks must be kept face down. A player may suspend play at any time and ask to see the last completed trick but none before it. Once a trick is turned over it is considered complete.

===Misplay===
Failure to comply with the aforegoing rules is called a &#x27;misplay (or reneg)&#x27;. A player who suspects someone has &#x27;misplayed (re-negged)&#x27; may stop the hand by verbally saying &#x27;misplay (or reneg)&#x27;. It is verified by examining the over-turned tricks and identifying the trick where the misplay is believed to have occurred.

If a team is successful in proving the &#x27;misplay&#x27;, that team then receives all points from the hand that the &#x27;misplay&#x27; occurred in. However, if they wrongly announce a &#x27;misplay&#x27;, the opponents receive all the points for that hand.

As an example, suppose the king of trumps is played and the second player plays a 6 of trumps to the trick. If later, the second player plays the 9 of trumps, an observant tarabish player will realize that someone did not &#x27;play to beat&#x27; the &#x27;trump king&#x27; during the opening trick. It&#x27;s at this time the observant player can then call a &quot;misplay&#x27; (also referred to as &#x27;renegging&#x27;).

At any time a player may throw his cards and forfeit the points that have been played.

===Scoring===

Upon completion of each hand, teams count the points in their winning tricks to determine the scores. Base score for a hand is 162 points, before any runs or &quot;Bella&quot; is counted. This is derived from 62 points in trump values, 90 points in non trump values, and 10 points for taking the last trick.

The calling team must be able to score at least one more than half the points available (82 by default), otherwise all points are awarded to the opposition. This is known as &quot;going bait&quot;.

The highest possible score for a team in 1 hand is 282 (2 &quot;50&#x27;s&quot; and Bella) since only the highest straight is counted, but a single player can have more than 1 straight if their hand contains the highest straight among players.

===Runs===

There are two types of runs. Runs in Tarabish are according to the customary card rank as in Poker (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A). So the three best trumps (J, 9, A) do not make a run.

*A twenty is a run of three cards in a row of the same suit. (e.g. 6, 7, 8 of hearts or 9, 10, J of clubs)
*A fifty is a run similar to a &quot;twenty&quot; however it is a run of four cards in a row. If a player happen to have 5 or 6 cards in a row it is still just a fifty and the extra cards are in no way significant when comparing to other runs.
*A player with a run must announce to the other players that they have a run before they play their first card. A player must show his or her run immediately before playing their second card.

One player can have multiple runs, but only one player can count runs in a hand. If more than one player announces a run, the player with the &quot;best&quot; run according to the following will get to count all of their runs. If a player has multiple runs, their best run is used for the following comparison:

* A fifty always beats a twenty.
* When comparing two runs of the same size, the one with the highest rank is best.
* A run in trumps beats a run of the same size and rank in non-trumps.
* Two runs of the same size and rank in non-trumps cancel each other out. In this case no one counts their runs even if one player has multiple runs. If a player announces a run, but fails to show it before the play of their second card, the run is not counted. A popular version suggests that if a player called a fifty but forgets to show it, before the third card is played, a twenty can be shown and counted, but only other players.

===Bella===

Bella (or Bells) is when a player has a king and queen of the trump suit in the same hand and is worth an additional 20 points when called. The player MUST call bella when playing the last of the 2 cards to get the points. Common practice allows to instead call the first of the bells rather than the last. This is advantageous in remembering to call it, but gives others information about one&#x27;s hand and may be detrimental in giving away points if going bait.
* Official rules state that calling &quot;first of bells&quot; is table-talk and an automatic forfeiture of points since it is telling one&#x27;s partner of another guaranteed trump held in the hand.

In the event that bella is part of a valid run, the player has the option to announce &quot;Bella&quot; when they show their run or wait until played.

==Tarabish terms==

*Bait - The team which &quot;calls&quot; trump and fails to accumulate at least one point more than half the points available. See bête
*Half bait - The team which &quot;calls&quot; trump accumulates exactly half the available points. The calling team receives a score of zero, the non-calling team receives full credit for their score (1/2 of the total score of the hand).
*Bella - When a player has the King and Queen of trump in a single hand.
*Run - Three or four cards in sequence in the same suit.
*Twenty - A run of three cards.
*Fifty - A run of four cards.
*Misplay or renege - When a player doesn&#x27;t follow the lead suit, or doesn&#x27;t beat trump when he can. If a misplay is called against a team, all the points go to the team who called the misplay. See renege.
*Last - Final trick earning an additional 10 points to the winning team.
*Kitty - The three cards that are hidden to a player until after a trump is called.
*Playing to beat - If at any time a player is forced to play a trump, he must beat the best trump card on the table.
*Linganer - A 3-card run consisting of 6-7-8, named after the former 876 Lingan Coal Mine.
*Johnny and the nerf - The jack and 9 of trump, respectively.
*50 with the bells - Calling and showing a 3 or 4-card run that includes the king and queen of trump (bella). In more informal circumstances, can be called 50 with the nuts and sluts.
*Dry ten - When a player has only the 10 in a suit, after being dealt their cards
*Forced - A popular variation. If a team has over 400 points, that team is forced to call trump. Therefore, they are not allowed to pass trump call to the dealer if the dealer is on the opposite team. If both teams are over 400 points, the team with the higher points is &#x27;forced&#x27;.

<doc id="903209" wikidata="Q7337559" url="?curid=903209" title="River Lambourn">
<text>The River Lambourn is a chalk stream in the English county of Berkshire. It rises in the Berkshire Downs near its namesake village of Lambourn and is a tributary of the River Kennet, which is itself a tributary of the River Thames.

The river is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and Special Protection Area under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds.

==Perennial River==
The upper reaches of the river are seasonal, with a perennial source derived from a number of springs located upstream of the village of Great Shefford. At times when the water table in the chalk aquifer feeding the river is high (usually between November and March) the source of the river migrates upstream. Along the bourn section of the river are located the villages of Eastbury and East Garston, while along the perennial section of the river are the villages of Great Shefford, Welford, Boxford, Bagnor, Donnington and Shaw. Below Shaw is the confluence of the River Lambourn with the River Kennet, located between Newbury and Thatcham. The River Lambourn itself has a single perennial tributary, the Winterbourne Stream, which joins it at the village of Bagnor. 

==Lambourn Valley Way==

The Lambourn Valley Way from the Uffington White Horse to Newbury generally follows the River Lambourn from Lambourn to Donnington Castle, in many places using the embankments of the old Lambourn Valley Railway.

==Upper Lambourn and Lynch Wood==
The highest source of the Lambourn is on the Maddle Road in the village of Upper Lambourn, near the Wiltshire and Oxfordshire borders. It emerges from a rainwater drain and occasionally flows down a channel between the road and pavement. In the village it runs underground in a pipe until re-emerging alongside the road opposite The Malt Shovel and along Malt Shovel Lane. At this point it is usually little more than a damp, muddy ditch, and remains so until halfway through Lynch Wood. Here it is fed by several springs, two of which are close to the Goose Green road, forming a short stream that runs ten feet downhill into the river. These springs quickly fill the channel and the river swells ten to twenty feet wide and over three feet deep, submerging several fallen trees. Although bourne until Great Shefford the river was not dry below Lynch Wood in 2007–08. However, it dried up in June–July 2009 and the riverbed remained dry until January 2010 due to 4-5 inches of snow melting in a thaw. It dried up again from the summer of 2010 until the spring of 2012, when increased rainfall filled the river, since when the adjacent roads in Upper Lambourn, Lambourn and Eastbury have been regularly flooded.

==Lambourn to Thatcham==

The river leaves the wood and enters Lambourn under a bridge crossed by the Goose Green Road, here it flows more quickly as the channel narrows to four to six feet across and six to eight inches deep. It is constricted by the houses built on the riverbank, which were partially flooded in July 2007 as numerous weeds clogged the river under the many small bridges (and even one garden shed) built over it. It passes by The Lamb and the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service and runs between the houses on the south side of the Newbury Road and the playing fields to the north of Bockhampton Road. There is a ford next to the Bockhampton Road bridge which is used by horses (and accidentally by a car in March 2009, which had to be pulled out) and the river leaves the town through Bockhampton Manor Farm. Bernard&#x27;s Ford is found to the west of Eastbury, which is also suitable only for tractors and horses. Here the Lambourn forced its banks in July 2007 and flowed down the Newbury Road for over a hundred yards before rejoining the river. The Lambourn runs through the middle of Eastbury, and past The Plough Inn, which holds The Great Eastbury Duck Race on the river in May. In East Garston there are many houses are built on one bank with their own bridges from the front door to the road opposite. The river splits into several channels at Great Shefford, and is joined by many small streams, which join as it leaves the village under the A338 Swan Bridge and behind The Swan. From Lambourn to Newbury the river remains roughly parallel to the Newbury Road (which becomes the Lambourn Road) which crosses it many times. In Newbury it runs between Donnington and Speen and south of Shaw House until it joins the River Kennet to the south of The Nature Discovery Centre. The River Kennet joins the River Thames at Reading.

==Flow regime==
The River Lambourn is almost unique for a chalk stream in southern England in that its flow regime remains near-natural in form; not being significantly modified by groundwater abstraction. Ironically, this situation developed because of a major groundwater abstraction project. In the 1960s the long term water supply situation for London was regarded as vulnerable and one avenue investigated to rectify this was to use untapped water resources naturally stored in the chalk aquifer of low population density areas of south east England. One such area was the West Berkshire Downs, including the catchment of the River Lambourn. The plan was to abstract groundwater from the chalk aquifer during times of drought and then use the existing river system as a natural conduit to transport the water to London, via the River Kennet and the River Thames.

An area in the catchment of the River Lambourn was selected as a pilot study to assess the feasibility of the project, and the Lambourn Valley Pilot Scheme was undertaken between 1967 and 1970. The final conclusion from the pilot study was that the overall scheme appeared feasible and a significant number of large abstraction boreholes and observation boreholes, together with pipelines and control equipment, were installed in the Lambourn catchment and also in other nearby river catchments. The project, named the Thames Groundwater Scheme, was completed in 1976 to coincide with the most serious drought in 50 years, but on final testing of the scheme it was found that the effective increase in river flow downstream was minimal, and essentially the project was a failure.

Almost all of the infrastructure for the project (now known as the West Berkshire Groundwater Scheme) is still in place and maintained, albeit on a rather shoestring budget. But the lasting legacy of the scheme is that the catchment has been preserved as a near-natural groundwater system, almost totally unaffected by groundwater abstractions. This factor made it an ideal candidate for selection as one of the flagship research sites for the NERC LOCAR research project investigating permeable (i.e. groundwater dominated) catchments.

==The Second Battle of Newbury, 1644==
In 1644 the Royalist Army of King Charles I of England took up a defensive position in the triangle where the River Lambourn meets the River Kennet, with fortifications at Shaw House and Speen. Here it was attacked by the Parliamentarian Armies in the Second battle of Newbury on 27 October 1644.

<text>U.S. Route 264 (US 264) is an east–west United States Highway located completely within the U.S. state of North Carolina, running for . Its western terminus is located at Interstate 87 (I-87), I-440, and US 64 in Raleigh. US 264 is a freeway between Raleigh and Wilson, with segments running concurrently with I-87, I-587, I-795, and US 64. The highway is largely parallel to I-587 between Wilson and Greenville and primarily serves smaller communities such as Saratoga and Farmville. East of Greenville, US 264 is an important highway connecting communities such as Washington, Belhaven, Swan Quarter, and Engelhard. The eastern terminus of US 264 is located at US 64 in Manns Harbor. 

Prior to the establishment of US 264, North Carolina Highway 91 (NC 91) running along the general corridor between Zebulon and Engelhard. In 1932, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) approved the establishment of US 264 between Zebulon and Engelhard, running concurrently with NC 91. By 1935, the eastern terminus of NC 91 was truncated to Zebulon, removing the concurrency with US 264. US 264 was extended east to Nags Head by 1951, running along its own routing between Engelhard and Manns Harbor and concurrently with US 64 from Manns Harbor to Nags Head. Improvements to the highway were gradually made, including the creation of a freeway between Zebulon and Greenville. The freeway was completed by 2003 with the final segment opening near Sims. US 264 was extended west from Zebulon to Raleigh in 1997, with the new routing completely concurrent with US 64. In 2021, I-587 was established running along the US 264 freeway between I-95 in Wilson and US 264 and NC 11 Bypass in Greenville. US 264 was subsequently removed from the freeway between Wilson and Greenville and was placed along portions of its old routing and a concurrency with NC 11 Bypass. 

==Route description==
===Raleigh to Wilson===

The western terminus of US 264 is located at an interchange with I-87, I-440, and US 64 in Raleigh. Beyond the interchange, I-87, I-440, and US 64 travel south and west toward I-40, while I-440 travels north and west toward US 1. US 264 travels east concurrently with I-87 and US 64 along a freeway. The highways interchange with New Hope Road (exit 4) before crossing Crabtree Creek and the Neuse River. I-87, US 64, and US 264 continue east, meeting Hodge Road at exit 6 and the eastern terminus of I-540 at exit 7. Beyond the interchange with I-540, the freeway travels to the south of Knightdale.

The incomplete interchange only has access to I-795 south from I-587 east and US 264 east, while traffic along I-795 north can only access I-587 west and US 264 west at exit 43C. A nearby interchange with US 301 provides further access to I-795 and to the northern terminus of US 117. I-587 and US 264 turn to follow an easterly direction before crossing over two railroads owned and operated by CSX Transportation. The highways meet Black Creek Road, Old Stantonsburg Road, and NC 58 at interchanges south of Wilson. Additionally, I-587 and US 264 cross over the Carolina Coastal Railway between Old Stantonsburg Road and NC 58. Beyond NC 58, the freeway makes an s-shaped curve before reaching a diamond interchange between Wilson and Saratoga. US 264 exits the freeway at the interchange and turns to the southeast toward Saratoga. The eastern terminus of US 264 Alternate is also located at the interchange.

North of the river, US 264 and NC 11 Bypass meet NC 33 at a diamond interchange and then turn to the east. US 264 meets US 13, NC 11, and NC 903 at a partial cloverleaf interchange, marking the northern terminus of NC 11 Bypass and the end of the freeway. The highway continues as a non-controlled access divided highway through an industrial area of Greenville. It turns to the southeast and continues straight for approximately before turning to the south. US 264 then intersects US 264 Alternate and NC 33 at Pactolus Highway. US 264 turns to the east at the intersection travelling along a non-controlled access divided highway which somewhat parallels the Tar River.

As US 264 continues east on Pactolus Highway, it leaves the city of Greenville and reenters rural Pitt County. It passes to the south of Pactolus and intersects the southern terminus of NC 30 east of the community. US 264 then turns to the south and travels approximately east of NC 30 until crossing Tranters Creek, a tributary of the Tar River, and entering Beaufort County. The highway continues southeast and enters Washington from the northwest, picking up the name 5th Street. US 264 meets US 17 at a diamond interchange northwest of downtown Washington. It continues southeast along 5th Street and intersects US 17 Business and the western terminus of NC 92 at Bridge Street. US 264 and NC 92 run concurrently along Bridge Street to the southeast. The highway turns to the northeast west of an intersection with Harvey Street, and changes names to John Small Avenue at an intersection with 5th Street. It then turns to the east near Highland Drive, crosses Runyon Creek, and leaves Washington to the east. 

===Washington to Manns Harbor===

US 264 and NC 92 continue to travel east from Washington through an exurban area of Beaufort County. The highways intersect NC 32 in the community of Bunyan and then enter a rural area. Approximately east of Bunyan, NC 92 splits from US 264 and continues southeast towards Bath. US 264 turns to the northeast near the NC 92 intersection but soon returns to an easterly orientation. The highway continues to travel east through rural Beaufort County, crossing Tankard Creek and Pungo Creek. East of the Pungo Creek crossing, US 264 turns toward Pantego following a northeasterly orientation. US 264 enters Pantego from the southwest where it picks up the name Main Street. The highway crosses a tributary of the Pungo River before intersecting NC 99 at Pungo Road. US 264 and NC 99 begin a concurrency and travel east along Main Street, crossing a branch of the Carolina Coastal Railway at an at-grade crossing. The highways then leave the town and turn to the southeast toward Belhaven, roughly paralleling the railroad. US 264 and NC 99 enter Belhaven from the northwest and pick up the name Main Street. Northwest of downtown Belhaven, US 264 intersects NC 99 and US 264 Business, marking the end of the NC 99 concurrency. At the intersection, US 264 turns to the northeast, bypassing downtown Belhaven. The highway continues east, intersecting US 264 Business once more in a rural area northeast of Belhaven. US 264 continues east for until crossing another tributary of the Pungo River and entering into Hyde County.
After entering Hyde County, US 264 travels for until intersecting NC 45. At the intersection, NC 45 turns to follow concurrently with US 264, and the highways begin a turn to the southeast. US 264 and NC 45 continue southeast for until turning to the south and crossing the Intracoastal Waterway along the Walter B. Jones Bridge. The highways continue south for approximately through rural Hyde County passing the community of Scranton to the east. Near Hodges Road, the highways turn to the east and continue for approximately before turning to the southeast. US 264 and NC 45 continue for another until NC 45 diverges from the highway northwest of Swanquarter, marking the end of the US 264 and NC 45 concurrency. The highway turns to the east, bypassing Swanquarter to the north. Northeast of Swanquarter, US 264 intersects NC 94 at Main Street. US 264 and NC 94 run concurrently to the northeast toward Lake Mattamuskeet. As it approaches the lake, the highway turns to follow alongside its southern shoreline. US 264 intersects NC 94 west of New Holland, marking the end of the US 264 and NC 94 concurrency. It then continues northeast through New Holland and Lake Landing toward Engelhard. As it approaches the community, US 264 turns to the east near an intersection with Lake Road.

The highway then turns to the east and crosses the Long Shoal River where it enters into Dare County. Approximately east of the Long Shoal River, US 264 turns to the southeast. It remains in a southeasterly orientation for before briefly turning to the east and then begins a gradual turn to the north. The remainder of the route largely parallels shoreline of the Pamlico or Croatan Sound. In the vicinity of Stumpy Point, the highway runs adjacent to the shoreline of Stumpy Point Bay. On the north side of the bay, it intersects Bayview Drive which provides access to the community of Stumpy Point. US 264 continues north through the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge for before turning to the northwest. The highway continues northwest for before making a final turn to the northeast. US 264 travels for an additional before intersecting its eastern terminus at US 64 west of Manns Harbor in Dare County. 

===Scenic byways===
Pamlico Scenic Byway is an byway from Washington to Manns Harbor. US 264 overlap several sections of the byway. The byway is noted for its history, scenic views, and the three national wildlife refuges that the route goes through. Other roads and highways that make-up the byway are: NC 32, NC 45, NC 92, and NC 94.

==History==
Established in 1932, US 264 started from US 64/NC 90, in Zebulon, to the community of Engelhard, in Hyde County. The route was overlapped entirely with NC 91 and was paved west of Swan Quarter. In 1934, NC 91 was removed along the route; in 1935, US 264 was paved from Swan Quarter to Engelhard.

Sometime between 1948-&#x27;50, US 264 was moved south around Wilson, on Ward Boulevard; the old route became US 264 Alternate, which later became US 264 Business in 1960 till 1980-&#x27;84.

Sometime between 1951-&#x27;52, US 264 was extended east from Engelhard to Manns Harbor, where it connected back with US 64. It continued east, overlapped with US 64, ending at Whalebone Junction with US 158 and NC 12.

Sometime between 1953-&#x27;54, US 264 was bypassed Farmville and Greenville; the old routes became US 264 Alternate, eventually both were decommissioned by 1990. By 1958, US 264 was moved north around Swan Quarter, replaced by NC 45 and NC 94. In 1962-&#x27;63, US 264 was bypassed north around Belhaven, old route through town becoming US 264 Business.

Between 1972-&#x27;78, US 264 was moved onto a Super-2 routing north of Sims, Bailey, and Middlesex. Much of the old route become US 264 Business, which is today part of US 264 Alternate. In 1979, the Super-2 was upgraded to freeway standards.

Between 1987-&#x27;90, US 264 was moved onto new freeway south of Wilson; the old route along Ward Boulevard became part of the current US 264 Alternate route. Also during this time, US 264 was upgraded to freeway standards east of Farmville to Greenville. Between 1991-&#x27;93, US 264 was moved north onto new freeway, bypassing Farmville.

Sometime between 1994 and 1999, US 264 was extended west from Zebulon, to the junction with I-440 in Raleigh. This would later change on July 8, 2005, when the Knightdale Bypass was completed.

In August 2002, US 264 was truncated east at Manns Harbor.

In 2004, US 264 was rerouted, between I-95 and NC 121, onto new freeway, south of Wilson. In 2007, part of this route was overlapped with I-795.

In 2016, construction began on a bypass between US 264 in Greenville, where it connects with the city&#x27;s Stantonsburg Road, to NC 11 as it passes through Ayden.

On June 22, 2022, I-587 was officially established from I-95, near Wilson, to NC 11 Bypass, in Greenville; as a result of the new designation, US 264 was realigned back to its former routing from north of Saratoga to Greenville.
==Junction list==


















==Special routes==

===Middlesex–Greenville alternate route===

Established around 1984, US 264 Alternate was a renumbering of the Middlesex business loop, which followed the original alignment of US 264 from Middlesex to Wilson. In 2004, it was extended east to Greenville, absorbing US 264 alternate between Farmville and Greenville. In June 2022, after approval from AASHTO in 2021 Annual Meeting, mainline US 264 was rerouted back along its former routing between north of Saratoga to Greenville with US 264 Alternate decommissioned along that section. The still existing portions of the alternate route are now two segments, with the Zebulon–Wilson western segment and the Greenville eastern segment.








===Middlesex business loop===

Established by 1978, it was a renumbering of mainline US 264, which was moved onto new routing north of Bailey, Middlesex, and Sims. Originally, US 264 business ran from NC 581 to near Interstate 95; it was extended west to NC 39 in 1979. In 1984, the entire route was redesignated to US 264 Alternate.

===Wilson business loop===

U.S. Route 264 Business (US 264 Business) was a business route of US 264 through the city of Wilson. 

The routing of US 264 Business was once part of US 264 prior to 1950. In 1950, US 264 was rerouted and the former alignment through downtown Wilson along Raleigh Road and Nash Street became US 264A. In 1960, US 264A was renamed to US 264 Business. The highway remained the same until 1972, when it was removed from Bynum Street, Vance Street, Pender Street, and parts of Raleigh Road and Nash Street. Instead, US 264 Business was routed to follow Hines Street between Raleigh Road Parkway and East Nash Street. In 1977, US 264 Business was decommissioned.
&#x27;

===Farmville alternate route===

Established around 1954 as a renumbering of mainline US 264, it traversed through downtown Farmville, via Wilson Street and Moye-Turnage Road. It was decommissioned by 1990 when US 264 bypassed north of Farmville and its former alignment south of Farmville became its alternate route. NC 121 replaced the eastern half of the former route from US 264 Alt to Main Street.

===Wilson–Greenville alternate route===

Established around 1990 as a renumbering of mainline US 264; which traversed from Farmville to Greenville. In 2002, it was extended west of Farmville to Wilson, replacing part of NC 121 and NC 91. In 2004, it was absorbed by the Middlesex-Greenville alternate route.

===Greenville alternate route===

Established by 1954 as a renumbering of mainline US 264, it traversed through downtown Greenville via Dickinson Avenue and East 10th Street. In 1960, it was renumbered as US 264 Business.

The route of the Greenville and Raleigh Plank Road, which was established in 1853, became part of the route of US 264 between Greenville and Wilson, North Carolina. Although no longer maintained after the company went bankrupt in 1861, the route was still used as an unpaved track and Right of way by horse and motor traffic. State senator James Leonidas Fleming, who established East Carolina University in Greenville, was killed in an early automobile accident along the plank road in 1909.

===Greenville business loop===

Established in 1960 as a renumbering of US 264 Alternate, it remained unchanged till 1990, when it was decommissioned.

===Belhaven alternate route===

U.S. Route 264 Alternate (US 264A) was established around 1954-1957 as a renumbering of mainline US 264, it traversed through downtown Belhaven, via Main Street and Pamlico Street. In 1960, it was renumbered as US 264 Business.

===Belhaven business loop===

U.S. Route 264 Business (US 264 Bus) was established in 1960, the route follows the original US 264 alignment through downtown Belhaven, via Main Street and Pamlico Street.

&#x27;

===Manns Harbor–Manteo Bypass===

U.S. Route 264 Bypass (US 264 By-pass) was established in 1999 as a new primary routing bypassing Manns Harbor and Manteo, while also providing direct access between Nags Head and the mainland. Its main feature is the Virginia Dare Memorial Bridge, which is a divided four-lane bridge crossing over the Croatan Sound. Sharing a complete concurrency with US 64 Bypass throughout its existence, it was removed in 2003 when US 264&#x27;s eastern terminus was relocated further west.

<text>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation is a non-fiction book written by Lynne Truss, the former host of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Cutting a Dash&quot; programme. In the book, published in 2003, Truss bemoans the state of punctuation in the United Kingdom and the United States and describes how rules are being relaxed in today&#x27;s society. Her goal is to remind readers of the importance of punctuation in the English language by mixing humour and instruction.

Truss dedicates the book &quot;to the memory of the striking Bolshevik printers of St. Petersburg who, in 1905, demanded to be paid the same rate for punctuation marks as for letters, and thereby directly precipitated the first Russian Revolution&quot;. She added this dedication as an afterthought after remembering the factoid when reading one of her radio plays.

== Overview ==
There is one chapter each on apostrophes; commas; semicolons and colons; exclamation marks, question marks and quotation marks; italic type, dashes, brackets, ellipses and emoticons; and hyphens. Truss touches on varied aspects of the history of punctuation and includes many anecdotes. Contrary to usual publishing practice, the US edition of the book left the original British conventions intact.

==Title==
The title of the book is a syntactic ambiguitya verbal fallacy arising from an ambiguous or erroneous grammatical constructionand derived from a joke popularised by Ursula Le Guin (a variant on a &quot;bar joke&quot;) about bad punctuation:


The joke turns on the ambiguity of the final sentence fragment. As intended by the author, &quot;eats&quot; is a verb, while &quot;shoots&quot; and &quot;leaves&quot; are the verb&#x27;s objects: a panda&#x27;s diet consists of shoots and leaves. However, the erroneous introduction of the comma gives the mistaken impression that the sentence fragment comprises three verbs listing in sequence the panda&#x27;s characteristic conduct: it eats, then it shoots, and finally it leaves.

== Reception ==
The book was a commercial success. In 2004, the US edition became a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller. In a 2004 review, Louis Menand of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; pointed out several dozen punctuation errors in the book, including one in the dedication, and wrote that &quot;an Englishwoman lecturing Americans on semicolons is a little like an American lecturing the French on sauces. Some of Truss&#x27;s departures from punctuation norms are just British laxness.&quot;

In &quot;The Fight for English: How Language Pundits Ate, Shot and Left&quot; (Oxford University Press 2006), linguist David Crystal analyses the linguistic purism of Truss and other writers through the ages. In 2006, English lecturer Nicholas Waters released &quot;Eats, Roots &amp; Leaves&quot;, criticising the &quot;grammar fascists&quot; who &quot;want to stop the language moving into the 21st century&quot;. This view was shared by dyslexic English comedian and satirist Marcus Brigstocke in a 2007 episode of &quot;Room 101&quot;, in which he blames Truss&#x27;s book for starting off a trend in which people have become &quot;grammar bullies&quot;.

In July 2006, Putnam Juvenile published a 32-page follow-up for children entitled &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: Why, Commas Really Do Make a Difference!&quot;. Based on the same concept, this version covers only the section on comma usage and uses cartoons to explain the problems presented by their poor usage.

<text>Darrell T. Rankin (born February 14, 1957) is a Canadian peace activist and former communist politician. He was briefly the leader of the Communist Party of Canada (Ontario) in 1995, and formerly led the Communist Party of Canada (Manitoba) from 1996 to 2019. His partner, Cheryl-Anne Carr, was also active with the Communist Party. Rankin left the Communist Party in 2019.

==Early life and career==
Rankin was born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta, and became involved in radical left politics through an early opposition to the Vietnam War. His grandparents were active in the Communist Party of Canada, which Rankin joined in 1978. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Alberta.

He lived in Ottawa, Ontario, from 1983 to 1995, and was a leading figure in the Canadian Peace Alliance and the Ottawa Disarmament Coalition. A newspaper report from 1986 listed him as an articling lawyer, although it is not clear if he continued in this direction. He participated in protests against the Gulf War in 1991.

==CPC-Ontario leader==
In 1992, a majority of delegates at the Communist Party&#x27;s national convention voted to abandon Marxism-Leninism and pursue a social democratic alternative. Rankin was a part of the minority group led by Miguel Figueroa that opposed the change, and continued to support traditional communist principles. The party split, and the minority group won the rights to the Communist Party name through an out-of-court settlement.

Rankin was appointed as interim leader of the Communist Party of Canada (Ontario) in April 1995, and led the party in the 1995 provincial election. The national party had fallen to only 500 members in this period, and the Ontario party ran a low-profile campaign with only five candidates and an $8,000 budget. Rankin challenged New Democratic Party Premier Bob Rae in York South, and focused on issues such as health, education, social programs and full employment.

In June 1995, Rankin contributed an article entitled &quot;Observations on the Setbacks to Socialism&quot; to the Communist Party discussion journal &quot;The Spark!&quot; (not to be confused with the Trotskyist organization of the same name). The piece examined then-recent events in Eastern Europe, including the fall of the Soviet Union.

==CPC-Manitoba leader==
Rankin moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1995 following the Ontario election. The Communist Party of Canada (Manitoba) had been without effective leadership for several years, and Rankin was chosen as the party&#x27;s provincial organizer before the year was over. He coordinated the CPC-M&#x27;s 75th anniversary banquet in early 1996, and was elected party leader later in the year. He subsequently led the party in the 1999, 2003 and 2007 provincial elections.

In January 2004, Rankin was challenged for the CPC-M leadership by Paul Sidon. He received 79 per cent of delegate support, against 21 per cent for Sidon.

Rankin is a founding member of Peace Alliance Winnipeg and a member of the No War Coalition (Manitoba). He helped organize protests against the 1999 Kosovo Conflict, the 2001 NATO invasion of Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He wrote an article for the &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot;, the newspaper of the Communist Party, supporting Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s policies in Kosovo in order to protect Serbians from Albanians in the region whom Rankin labelled as &quot;Fascists&quot;. He continued to write occasional articles for &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot;. In November 2007, he organized a party at Winnipeg&#x27;s Ukrainian Labour Temple to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Russian Revolution.

Rankin has campaigned for public office several times, although he has never been elected. In March 2006, he was the leader of Communist Party of Canada&#x27;s Peace and Disarmament Coalition. He is not related to Naomi Rankin, the leader of the Communist Party of Canada - Alberta. Rankin ran in Winnipeg Centre during the 2015 federal election.

<text>U.S. Route 165 is a north–south United States highway spur of U.S. Highway 65. It currently runs for 412 miles (663 km) from U.S. Route 90 in Iowa, Louisiana north to U.S. Highway 70 in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The route passes through the states of Arkansas and Louisiana. It passes through the cities of Monroe and Alexandria in Louisiana. A segment of US 165 serves as a routing of the Great River Road within Arkansas.

===Louisiana===

From its southern terminus in Iowa at US 90 (near Lake Charles), US 165 follows a diagonal north south route, passing through the casino town of Kinder, where it intersects US 190.
Just south of Alexandria it merges with US 71 and they join through the west side of the city, across the Red River and into Pineville. A new four-lane (two lanes in each direction) bridge was built beside the aging OK Allen Bridge (named the Curtis-Coleman Bridge) and was opened in 2016. At that time, the OK Allen bridge was demolished. Past the bridge, the two highways meet US 167 and 71 parts with 165. Going on through the Kisatchie National Forest the rest of the highway to Monroe is forest land, farmland, and small towns. Crossing I-20 in Monroe, the highway&#x27;s largest city, it proceeds to Bastrop and crosses the Arkansas line a few miles north of the town. Due to the Louisiana DOT TIMED Project, US 165 is now a four lane divided highway from Iowa to Bastrop.
US 165 passes near three federal prisons: USP Oakdale and two near Pollock. Also, near Oakdale is the ruins of Camp Claiborne, an abandoned WWII military post.

===Arkansas===
The route enters Arkansas south of Wilmot in Ashley County. US 165 passes through bayous and marshlands before it intersects Highway 52 and Highway 173 in the town. Further north, in Parkdale, the route intersects Highway 8 and Highway 209. In Portland, US 165 intersects Highway 160 before entering Montrose. In the southern part of Montrose US 165 passes under U.S. Route 82, intersecting US 82 Business (US 82B) downtown. US 165 continues north near Cut-off Creek Wildlife Management Area to enter Drew County. Only serving the extreme southeastern corner of the county, US 165 runs through Jerome near the Jerome Elementary School No. 22. The highway enters Chicot County near Dermott where it intersects Highway 208 and Highway 35. Northeast of town, the route intersects its parent route (US 65), which form a concurrency to Dumas.

The route breaks from US 65 at Pickens Street, with Highway 277 shooting from the route east of Cypress Creek. The route forms a concurrency north with Highway 1 for beginning at Back Gate. US 165/AR 1 intersect Highway 212 before crossing the Arkansas River on the Pendleton Bridge.

Upon entering Arkansas County, the route passes the A.M. Bohnert Rice Plantation Pump#2 Engine and through sectioned farmland before meeting US 165B in Gillett. US 165/AR 1 continue north to De Witt, with AR 1 breaking east and US 165 turning due west. The route has a junction with Highway 11 at Eldridge Corner after which US 165 turns due north. This segment of US 165 was formerly AR 11 and is preserved in part by the National Register of Historic Places as Old AR 11 – Kauffman Road. The route enters Stuttgart after an intersection with 22nd Street. US 165 skirts the eastern edge of the city as Park Avenue before it turns west to intersect US 63 and enter Prairie County. The route only has one junction in its within the county, Highway 343.

The route next enters Lonoke County. Now within the Little Rock metro area, the route serves the southern part of the county with many rural junctions. Along its path, the route runs west through Humnoke, Allport, Coy (all with populations under 300 as of 2010) while intersecting Highway 13 and Highway 31 prior to England. US 165 turns northeast in England after a junction with Highway 256. US 165 passes through the Keo Commercial Historic District in Keo and later the Toltec Mounds Archeological State Park before entering Pulaski County.

Entering North Little Rock, the route has a junction with I-440 before terminating at Broadway Street (US 70).

====Great River Road====
The Great River Road is designated as a National Scenic Byway in the state of Arkansas. Established in 1938, the route is actually a series of roads which connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico along the Mississippi River. The portion of US 165 from the beginning of its concurrency with US 65 near Dermott north to De Witt is part of the Great River Road in Arkansas. The designation follows AR 1 north from De Witt and US 65 south of Dermott.

==History==
US 165 was established in 1926 on a route extending from Iowa, Louisiana to McGehee, Arkansas. A proposed extension north to Corning, Arkansas in 1946 was deferred. The route was extended to its current North Little Rock terminus in 1982.

The Louisiana portion was generally aligned with the existing State Route 24 south of Alexandria and State Route 14 north of Alexandria. Both had been designated in 1921 and remained co-signed with US 165 until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering.

US 165 replaced Arkansas Highway 11 in much of Arkansas County, Arkansas. Highway 11 was the main route through the area since its designation in the original 1926 state highway system. Some of this original pavement has been preserved by the National Register of Historic Places as Old AR 11 – Kauffman Road.

US 165 Business travels north while meeting LA 180, a former segment of the Jefferson Highway auto trail, and crossing the Pineville Expressway before ending at an intersection with its parent route.
===Alexandria bypass route===

US 165 Bypass was the original designation for the current route of US 165 through Alexandria and Pineville. Until 1961, when it was moved to the bypass, US 165 was routed along the current business route.

<text>U.S. Route 167 is a north-south United States Highway within the U.S. states of Louisiana and Arkansas. It runs for from Ash Flat, Arkansas at U.S. Route 62/U.S. Route 412 to Abbeville, Louisiana at Louisiana Highway 14. It goes through the cities of Little Rock, Arkansas, Alexandria, Louisiana, and Lafayette, Louisiana.

Some of the highway&#x27;s route has been combined with or parallels Interstate 49 in Louisiana. Between Junction City, Arkansas, and Ruston, Louisiana, U.S. 167 runs concurrent with U.S. 63.

==Route description==
===Louisiana===

U.S. Highway 167 in Louisiana runs in a north–south direction from the national southern terminus at Louisiana Highway 14 Business (LA 14 Bus.) in Abbeville to the Arkansas state line at Junction City.

The route cuts through the center of Louisiana for roughly its entire length and passes through two of the state&#x27;s metropolitan areas, Lafayette and Alexandria. Between those cities, US 167 ranges in character from an urban freeway to a lightly traveled two-lane collector. During this stretch, it overlaps the southern of Interstate 49 (I-49) from Lafayette through Opelousas before making a diversion through rural Evangeline Parish to serve the small city of Ville Platte.

US 167 follows a combination of I-49 and the Pineville Expressway through Alexandria and Pineville, crossing the Red River via the twin-span Purple Heart Memorial Bridge. US 167 remains a surface four-lane highway through northern Louisiana and is the primary north–south route through Winnfield, Jonesboro, and Ruston. The northern portion of the route, beginning at the I-20 interchange in Ruston, also carries the first of US 63.

On its southern end, US 167 began near Colfax, Louisiana when designated as one of the original numbered U.S. Highways in 1926. However, the route was extended to Abbeville in 1949 over a number of existing state highways, more than doubling its length within Louisiana. Since that time, US 167 has experienced several alignment shifts as freeways were constructed in its two urban areas. More recently, all but approximately of the route was widened to four lanes as part of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) TIMED program.

====Abbeville to Lafayette====
From the south, US 167 begins at an intersection with LA 14 Bus. (Port Street) in the Vermilion Parish city of Abbeville, located in southern Louisiana. The route heads north on Park Avenue, an undivided four-lane thoroughfare, and crosses mainline LA 14 (West Summers Drive). US 167 travels due north from Abbeville and becomes a divided four-lane highway on a wide right-of-way upon entering rural surroundings. The highway will repeat this pattern throughout the majority of its distance in Louisiana. Passing through Maurice, US 167 has a brief concurrency with LA 92. The highway then curves to the northeast and crosses into Lafayette Parish.

US 167 enters the suburban outgrowth of Lafayette and crosses the city limits just beyond a junction with LA 733 (East Broussard Road). The highway, locally known as Johnston Street, becomes a busy commercial corridor near the Acadiana Mall and intersects several major thoroughfares on the southwest side of town, including LA 3073 (Ambassador Caffery Parkway) and LA 3025 (College Road). Nearing the downtown area, US 167 passes the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, located at a junction with US 90 Bus./LA 182 (University Avenue). The route turns northwest onto the Evangeline Thruway, a one-way pair, and overlaps US 90 for about ten blocks. This short stretch represents the only non-freeway six-lane portion of US 167 in Louisiana. On the north side of town, the highway passes through a cloverleaf interchange with I-10 at exit 103, connecting with Baton Rouge to the east and Lake Charles to the west. This interchange also marks the southern terminus of I-49.

====I-49 concurrency and rural two-lane====
US 167 utilizes the alignment of I-49 for the next . The freeway initially carries six lanes of traffic but quickly narrows to four through lanes. The highway crosses from Lafayette into Carencro at exit 2, which connects to LA 98 (Gloria Switch Road). Carencro proper is served by exit 4, connecting with LA 726. North of Carencro, I-49/US 167 intersects the parallel LA 182 before crossing into St. Landry Parish.

In St. Landry Parish, the freeway cuts through the adjacent communities of Sunset and Grand Coteau, served by exit 11 to LA 93. Further north, the route skirts the eastern edge of the city of Opelousas, which is accessed by exit 18 to LA 31 (Creswell Lane) and exit 19 to US 190. US 167 departs from the alignment of I-49 at the next exit and heads west through a point known as Nuba and a junction with LA 10 and LA 182.

Narrowing to an undivided two-lane highway, US 167 travels northwest, overlapping LA 10 into Evangeline Parish. Here, the highway enters the city of Ville Platte and diverges onto the one-way pair of LaSalle and Main Streets through the center of town. During this stretch, US 167 intersects and briefly overlaps LA 29. After narrowing to two lanes again, US 167 turns due north at the western edge of Ville Platte and separates from LA 10. The highway passes to the east of Millers Lake and through an area known as Bayou Chicot, where it intersects LA 106. A few miles later, US 167 reaches a T-intersection with LA 13 in Turkey Creek. US 167 turns north to continue the path of LA 13 and travels several miles through a very sparsely populated area.

====Alexandria metropolitan area====
US 167 crosses into Rapides Parish just north of Clearwater and crosses under I-49 at exit 61. Soon afterward, it reaches a T-intersection with US 71 near Meeker and departs from the last stretch of two-lane pavement along its route. US 167 turns northwest and follows the alignment of US 71 alongside the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) line for the next through Lecompte, Lamourie, and Chambers. In Chambers, the highway passes the Louisiana State University at Alexandria, located about south of the Alexandria city limits.

Upon entering Alexandria, the principal city of central Louisiana, US 71 and US 167 engage into an interchange with I-49 at exit 80. (This interchange is also exit 63 on US 71.) US 167 takes the entrance ramp to begin another concurrency with I-49, while US 71 proceeds straight ahead onto MacArthur Drive co-signed as US 167 Bus. This time, the freeway begins with four through lanes and widens to six lanes further into town. On the edge of the business district, US 167 departs from I-49 a final time via exit 84 and transitions onto the Pineville Expressway joined with LA 28. As the highway elevates to begin the approach onto the Red River bridge, ramps connect to LA 1 and LA 28 Bus. via the grade-level one-way pair of Casson and Fulton Streets. This interchange also reconnects US 167 Bus. to the parent route, though it is not signed here. US 167 proceeds over the six-lane twin-span Purple Heart Memorial Bridge and crosses from Alexandria into the smaller adjacent city of Pineville.

US 167 is predominantly a grade-level four-lane freeway through the Pineville area with exits that do not utilize a numbering scheme. Tight diamond interchanges connect with LA 1250 (Shamrock Street) to Downtown Pineville and LA 107 toward Marksville. LA 28 departs to the east toward Jonesville at the next exit. US 167 curves northwest on the Pineville Expressway through Kingsville and intersects US 165, the main route connecting Alexandria with Monroe. Shortly afterward, in the community of Tioga, US 167 joins US 71 again briefly until the latter splits off toward Shreveport. Just before crossing into Grant Parish, the freeway ends as US 167 intersects LA 3225 at Creola.

====North Louisiana====
US 167 enters the Kisatchie National Forest at Prospect and remains within its boundaries throughout Grant Parish and into Winn Parish. Notable junctions along this stretch include LA 8 at Bentley, LA 123 in Dry Prong, and LA 500 at Packton. About north of Packton, US 167 curves due west onto East Lafayette Street in the town of Winnfield. The route overlaps US 84 and LA 34 through the center of town, where it crosses over the Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) railway line and transitions onto West Court Street. With the other highways departing to the south and west, US 167 resumes its northerly course out of Winnfield, passing through Dodson and into Jackson Parish.

US 167 follows the CPKC into the town of Jonesboro, where it travels along Old Winnsboro Road. After beginning a concurrency with LA 147, US 167 intersects LA 4 (East Main Street) in the center of town. Just north of Jonesboro, US 167 passes through the adjacent communities of Hodge and North Hodge, where LA 147 turns off to the northwest. US 167 winds its way through Quitman, Ansley, and Clay before crossing into Lincoln Parish.

In Lincoln Parish, US 167 proceeds north into the city of Ruston and diverges onto the one-way pair of Vienna and Trenton Streets. The route overlaps US 80 for nine blocks and also begins a longer concurrency with LA 146 at California Avenue. Heading out of the business district, US 167 passes through an interchange with I-20, connecting with Shreveport to the west and Monroe to the east. This interchange also marks the southern terminus of US 63, and the two highways will remain paired throughout the remainder of their distance in Louisiana. North of Ruston, the rural surroundings return once again. While passing through Vienna, LA 146 departs to the west. US 167 proceeds through Unionville and Dubach before crossing into Union Parish.

In Union Parish, the highway enters Bernice, where it follows another one-way pair (Cherry and Plum Streets). In this small town, LA 2 Alt. utilizes the alignment of US 167 to reconnect to its parent route, LA 2. In Lillie, US 167 intersects the northern terminus of LA 15 just west of Spearsville. The route then curves northwest toward Junction City, located on the Arkansas state line. US 167 follows Main Street through town and intersects LA 9 (West Fifth Street). At 3rd Street, the highway crosses the state line into Junction City, Arkansas and proceeds northward co-signed with US 63 toward El Dorado.

====Route classification and data====
US 167 has several different functional classifications over the course of its route, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). The route is classified as an urban principal arterial through most of the cities it serves. Outside of town, the majority of the route serves as a rural minor arterial south of Alexandria and as a rural principal arterial northward. Two notable exceptions are the portions running concurrent with I-49, which are classified as urban and rural interstates, and the portion between Ville Platte and Turkey Creek, which is a rural major collector. Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 53,500 vehicles in Lafayette and 56,100 in Alexandria, both along concurrencies with I-49. The lowest count reported was 1,110 vehicles north of Turkey Creek.

Several pieces of the southern half of US 167 are included in the state-designated system of tourist routes known as the Louisiana Scenic Byways. The portion between Abbeville and Lafayette is part of the Jean Lafitte Scenic Byway, and much of the route through Evangeline Parish is part of the Zydeco Cajun Prairie Scenic Byway.

===Arkansas===

Highway 167 enters Arkansas at Junction City, a twin city with Junction City, Louisiana. Entering the state, Highway 167 is paired with U.S. Highway 63. The highways runs northeast through rural Union County to a junction with Highway 7 near the historic Joel Smith House. The three highways begin a concurrency intersect U.S. Highway 82 shortly after entering El Dorado. North of this junction is a grade-separated intersection with U.S. Highway 82B and U.S. Highway 167B, leading into downtown El Dorado and the El Dorado Commercial Historic District. The next intersection is with Main Street and is also grade-separated. Highway 63 breaks from the aforementioned concurrency to the east toward Warren. Following an interchange with Champagnolle Road, Highway 167 ends its overlap with Highway 7 by exiting the freeway and heading north toward Calion. This intersection also serves as the northern terminus for Highway 167B, with Highway 7 continuing north toward Smackover.
Highway 167 runs north through sparsely populated parts of southern Calhoun County prior to entering Hampton, the county seat. The highway intersects U.S. Highway 278 (Main Street) and passes by the historic Calhoun County Courthouse and the Hampton Waterworks, both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the northern part of the county, Highway 167 meets another of its three business routes in the state, which runs into downtown Thornton. Highway 167 continues northeast to a junction with U.S. Highway 79, and the two routes begin a concurrency toward Fordyce.

==History==
===Original southern terminus and extensions===
US 167 was designated in November 1926 as one of the original routes of the numbered U.S. Highway system. At that time, it was a much shorter route with a southern terminus at US 71 between Aloha and Colfax, northwest of Alexandria. The entire route within Louisiana followed an auto trail organized in 1919 known as the Pershing Way. Like the more well-known and established Jefferson Highway, the Pershing Way was promoted as an international highway stretching from New Orleans to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. However, the two followed entirely different routes through Louisiana that intersected in Alexandria. While the Jefferson Highway traveled diagonally across the state, the Pershing Way made an &quot;L&quot; by heading west from New Orleans to Lafayette via the Old Spanish Trail (another auto trail and the predecessor of US 90) before turning north and cutting through the center of the state. When Louisiana implemented a numbering system for its state highways in 1921, the Pershing Way was designated as State Route 5. Once the state began signposting its U.S. Highways in 1928, they remained co-signed with their respective state designations until a renumbering of the system in 1955 eliminated such concurrencies.

Since its creation in 1926, the southern terminus of US 167 has been moved twice. In 1932, the highway was shifted south of Winnfield to follow State Route 99, an early addition to the state highway system that had recently been paved. This change took the highway through Dry Prong to a different junction with US 71 near Creola, slightly extending the route and allowing a more direct connection with Alexandria. The original alignment was a gravel route that followed what is now LA 471 through Verda to Atlanta and LA 34 from Atlanta to Winnfield.

US 167 assumed its full length in Louisiana in 1949, when the designation was extended over existing highways southward to Abbeville. State Route 43 carried the highway from Abbeville to Lafayette with the old Pershing Way (Route 5) taking it from there as far as Nuba, a point between Opelousas and Washington. The remainder of the distance to Alexandria was primarily composed of State Route 22 to Ville Platte, State Route 23 to Bayou Chicot, State Route 218 to Turkey Creek, State Route 26 to Meeker, and the concurrent US 71/State Route 1 into the city.

===Early routings and special routes in Alexandria and Lafayette===
In Alexandria, US 167 initially followed a path similar to its current business route and that of US 165. I-49 and the Pineville Expressway did not yet exist, and the primary through-town route followed MacArthur Drive, Lee Street, Bolton Avenue, and Murray Street into the downtown area. The highway crossed the Red River via the Murray Street Bridge, now demolished and replaced with the parallel Jackson Street Bridge. It continued through Pineville on Main Street, Military Highway, and Jefferson Highway to the modern junction of US 71 and US 165. The route then followed US 71 to Tioga and LA 3225 to Creola.

Shortly after its extension through Alexandria, a bypass route for US 167 was designated that followed MacArthur Drive (then known as the Alexandria Bypass) around the city and across the O.K. Allen Bridge upriver. Portions of this route were part of the existing US 71 Byp. and a new US 165 Byp. By 1953, mainline US 167 was routed over the O.K. Allen Bridge via Bolton Avenue, and the bypass was truncated to the intersection of Bolton Avenue and MacArthur Drive, which was a traffic circle at that time. This routing remained in effect until the early 1960s when US 167 was moved out of Downtown Alexandria altogether and absorbed the bypass route, which was then deleted.

In Lafayette, the route&#x27;s other urbanized area, US 167 followed Johnston Street into town as it does today. However, it originally turned north onto University Avenue (then known as College Avenue) across US 90 and followed the present route of LA 182 through Carencro, Sunset, and Opelousas. The portion along University Avenue between Johnston and Cameron Streets in Lafayette was concurrent with US 90, as the Evangeline Thruway did not yet exist. Over the years, US 90 was shifted back-and-forth from its original routing through the courthouse square (with University Avenue signed as a bypass route) to the University Avenue alignment (with the courthouse alignment signed as a business route). During one short period in the mid-1950s when the former configuration was in effect, mainline US 167 was also routed through the courthouse square with a bypass route designated along University Avenue. The courthouse square route was as follows: Johnston Street, Jefferson Street, Main Street, St. John Street, and Cameron Street to University Avenue.

==Bannered and suffixed routes==
===Alexandria business route===
U.S. Highway 167 Business (US 167 Bus.) runs in a north–south direction through the Rapides Parish city of Alexandria. It follows the former path of US 167 through town before it was shifted onto the newly completed I-49 in 1994.

From the south, US 167 Bus. begins at an interchange with I-49 (exit 80) and US 71 (exit 63) at the southern end of Alexandria. Mainline US 167 travels concurrently with I-49 to the north of the interchange and US 71 to the south. The business route heads northwest on MacArthur Drive, a divided four-lane highway with frontage roads, co-signed with US 71. It then turns northward onto Lee Street and becomes an undivided four-lane highway. After serving as a corridor for small commercial establishments for nearly , US 167 Bus. cuts through a residential neighborhood via the one-way pair of Mason and Overton Streets. A dozen blocks later, the route reaches an intersection with Bringhurst Street. Here, US 167 Bus. proceeds straight ahead co-signed with LA 1 and LA 28 Bus.

The travel lanes converge as the highway immediately heads through an underpass of the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) line and crosses under both the elevated I-49 and Pineville Expressway (US 167/LA 28). For the next four blocks, US 167 Bus. diverges again onto the one-way pair of Casson and Fulton Streets near the southeast corner of the downtown area, effectively serving as frontage roads of the Pineville Expressway. Ramps connect to southbound I-49/US 167 and to the Pineville Expressway (northbound US 167 and eastbound LA 28) as the latter increases in elevation to cross the Red River via the twin-span Purple Heart Memorial Bridge into Pineville.

US 167 Bus. is classified as an urban principal arterial by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). The average daily traffic volume in 2013 ranged from 7,300 to 24,400 vehicles with the highest counts recorded near the I-49 and US 167 interchanges at either end of the route. The posted speed limit is along MacArthur Drive, reduced to otherwise.

<text>An SQL INSERT statement adds one or more records to any single table in a relational database.

==Basic form==
Insert statements have the following form:

The number of columns and values must be the same. If a column is not specified, the default value for the column is used. The values specified (or implied) by the statement must satisfy all the applicable constraints (such as primary keys, constraints, and constraints). If a syntax error occurs or if any constraints are violated, the new row is not added to the table and an error returned instead.

Example:
INSERT INTO phone_book (name, number) VALUES (&#x27;John Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-1212&#x27;);
Shorthand may also be used, taking advantage of the order of the columns when the table was created. It is not required to specify all columns in the table since any other columns will take their default value or remain null:
Example for inserting data into 2 columns in the phone_book table and ignoring any other columns which may be after the first 2 in the table.
INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES (&#x27;John Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-1212&#x27;);
==Advanced forms==

===Multirow inserts===
A SQL feature (since SQL-92) is the use of &quot;row value constructors&quot; to insert multiple rows at a time in a single SQL statement:
INSERT INTO tablename (column-a, [column-b, ...])
VALUES (&#x27;value-1a&#x27;, [&#x27;value-1b&#x27;, ...]),
 (&#x27;value-2a&#x27;, [&#x27;value-2b&#x27;, ...]),


This feature is supported by IBM Db2, SQL Server (since version 10.0 - i.e. 2008), PostgreSQL (since version 8.2), MySQL, SQLite (since version 3.7.11) and H2.

Example (assuming that &#x27;name&#x27; and &#x27;number&#x27; are the only columns in the &#x27;phone_book&#x27; table):

INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES (&#x27;John Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-1212&#x27;), (&#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-2323&#x27;);

which may be seen as a shorthand for the two statements

INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES (&#x27;John Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-1212&#x27;);
INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES (&#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-2323&#x27;);

Note that the two separate statements may have different semantics (especially with respect to statement triggers) and may not provide the same performance as a single multi-row insert.

To insert multiple rows in MS SQL you can use such a construction:

INSERT INTO phone_book
SELECT &#x27;John Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-1212&#x27;
UNION ALL
SELECT &#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-2323&#x27;;

Note that this is not a valid SQL statement according to the SQL standard () due to the incomplete subselect clause.

To do the same in Oracle use the DUAL table, which always consists of a single row only:

INSERT INTO phone_book
SELECT &#x27;John Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-1212&#x27; FROM DUAL
UNION ALL
SELECT &#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;,&#x27;555-2323&#x27; FROM DUAL

A standard-conforming implementation of this logic shows the following example, or as shown above:

INSERT INTO phone_book
SELECT &#x27;John Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-1212&#x27; FROM LATERAL ( VALUES (1) ) AS t(c)
UNION ALL
SELECT &#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;,&#x27;555-2323&#x27; FROM LATERAL ( VALUES (1) ) AS t(c)

Oracle PL/SQL supports the statement, where multiple insert statements are terminated by a :

INSERT ALL
INTO phone_book VALUES (&#x27;John Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-1212&#x27;)
INTO phone_book VALUES (&#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-2323&#x27;)
SELECT * FROM DUAL;
In Firebird inserting multiple rows can be achieved like this:

INSERT INTO phone_book (name, number)
SELECT &#x27;John Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-1212&#x27; FROM RDB$DATABASE
UNION ALL
SELECT &#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;, &#x27;555-2323&#x27; FROM RDB$DATABASE;

Firebird, however, restricts the number of rows than can be inserted in this way, since there is a limit to the number of contexts that can be used in a single query.

===Copying rows from other tables===
An statement can also be used to retrieve data from other tables, modify it if necessary and insert it directly into the table. All this is done in a single SQL statement that does not involve any intermediary processing in the client application. A subselect is used instead of the clause. The subselect can contain joins, function calls, and it can even query the same table into which the data is inserted. Logically, the select is evaluated before the actual insert operation is started. An example is given below.

INSERT INTO phone_book2
SELECT *
FROM phone_book
WHERE name IN (&#x27;John Doe&#x27;, &#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;)

A variation is needed when some of the data from the source table is being inserted into the new table, but not the whole record. (Or when the tables&#x27; schemas are not the same.)

INSERT INTO phone_book2 (name, number)
SELECT name, number
FROM phone_book
WHERE name IN (&#x27;John Doe&#x27;, &#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;)

The statement produces a (temporary) table, and the schema of that temporary table must match with the schema of the table where the data is inserted into.

==Default Values==
It is possible to insert a new row without specifying any data, using default values for all columns.
However, some databases reject the statement if no data is given, such as Microsoft SQL Server, and in this case the keyword can be used.
INSERT INTO phone_book
VALUES ( DEFAULT )
Sometimes databases also support alternative syntax for this; for example, MySQL allows omitting the keyword, and T-SQL can use instead of .
The keyword can also be used in normal insertion to explicitly fill a column using that column&#x27;s default value:
INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ( DEFAULT, &#x27;555-1212&#x27; )
What happens when a column does not specify a default value is database dependent.
For example, MySQL and SQLite will fill in with a blank value (except when in strict mode), while many other databases will reject the statement.

==Retrieving the key==
Database designers that use a surrogate key as the primary key for every table will run into the occasional scenario where they need to automatically retrieve the database-generated primary key from an SQL statement for use in other SQL statements. Most systems do not allow SQL statements to return row data. Therefore, it becomes necessary to implement a workaround in such scenarios. Common implementations include:

* Using a database-specific stored procedure that generates the surrogate key, performs the operation, and finally returns the generated key. For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, the key is retrieved via the special function, while in SQLite the function is named .
* Using a database-specific statement on a temporary table containing last inserted row(s). Db2 implements this feature in the following way:
SELECT *
FROM NEW TABLE (
 INSERT INTO phone_book
 VALUES ( &#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;,&#x27;555-2323&#x27; )
) AS t

**Db2 for z/OS implements this feature in the following way.
SELECT EMPNO, HIRETYPE, HIREDATE
FROM FINAL TABLE (
 INSERT INTO EMPSAMP (NAME, SALARY, DEPTNO, LEVEL)
 VALUES(&#x27;Mary Smith&#x27;, 35000.00, 11, &#x27;Associate&#x27;)

* Using a statement after the statement with a database-specific function that returns the generated primary key for the most recently inserted row. For example, for MySQL.
* Using a unique combination of elements from the original SQL in a subsequent statement.
* Using a GUID in the SQL statement and retrieving it in a statement.
* Using the clause in the SQL statement for MS-SQL Server 2005 and MS-SQL Server 2008.
* Using an statement with clause for Oracle.
INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ( &#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;,&#x27;555-2323&#x27; )
RETURNING phone_book_id INTO v_pb_id

* Using an statement with clause for PostgreSQL (since 8.2). The returned list is identical to the result of a .
**Firebird has the same syntax in Data Modification Language statements (DSQL); the statement may add at most one row. In stored procedures, triggers and execution blocks (PSQL) the aforementioned Oracle syntax is used.
INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ( &#x27;Peter Doe&#x27;,&#x27;555-2323&#x27; )
RETURNING phone_book_id

* Using the function in H2 returns the last identity inserted.
SELECT IDENTITY();
==Triggers==
If triggers are defined on the table on which the statement operates, those triggers are evaluated in the context of the operation. triggers allow the modification of the values that shall be inserted into the table. triggers cannot modify the data anymore, but can be used to initiate actions on other tables, for example, to implement auditing mechanism.

<text>U.S. Route 169 (US 169) is a north-south U.S highway that currently runs for 966 miles (1,555 km) from the city of Virginia, Minnesota, to Tulsa, Oklahoma, at Memorial Drive.

==Route description==

===Oklahoma===

US 169 is a major north–south highway spanning in Oklahoma. The southern terminus for US 169 is Memorial Drive. The highway connects Tulsa, Oklahoma to the south with the Kansas state border to the north at South Coffeyville, Oklahoma. US 169 travels through Tulsa, Rogers, and Nowata counties.

US 169 has undergone several widening projects that have brought US 169 to freeway and expressway standards. The highway is two lanes between Talala, Oklahoma and South Coffeyville except for a short four-lane portion north of Nowata, Oklahoma and ending at State Highway 28.

An Alternate US 169 passes through Nowata following the original path of US 169. The alternate route begins at the intersection of Choctaw Avenue and reconnects with US 169 south of Nowata at its intersection with Maple Street.

In January 2005, Oklahoma Department of Transportation began a $16.8 million widening project on a mile-long stretch of US 169 (officially named &#x27;Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway&#x27;, although this name is rarely used by Tulsans) from Interstate 244 (I-244) to I-44. The project widened the highway from four to six lanes, adding one lane in each direction. The project was completed in April 2006. This stretch of US 169 is traveled by approximately 106,000 vehicles per day.

===Kansas===

US 169 enters the state at Coffeyville as a four-lane road, and is a four-lane highway for about till the edge of the Coffeyville Industrial Park. A segment runs around Chanute is a freeway with fully controlled access with center concrete barrier, with two lanes in each direction. US 169 runs concurrently with US 59 and K-31 starting about south of Garnett and diverges northeast again immediately south of Garnett. The intersection immediately south of Garnett used to be a &quot;braided&quot; intersection with Stop and Yield signs. It was identified as a high crash location in 2001, and was rebuilt as a roundabout that opened in April 2006. The Kansas Department of Transportation is rebuilding or planning to rebuild several other rural intersections as roundabouts for increased safety. In Garnett, 6th Avenue (from US 169 to US 59 is also known as Business US 169. Going south, it veers off from US 169 about a mile and a half north of the US 169/US 59/K-31 roundabout intersection and travels west and south on 6th Avenue from US 169 to US 59/K-31 (Maple St.) before turning south onto US 59/K-31 and running concurrently with them, ending at the US 169/US 59/K-31 roundabout intersection. At Osawatomie the road becomes a full freeway; as well as, running concurrent with K-7. In southern Johnson County 169 becomes an expressway until its junction with I-35 in Olathe.

From this point to the Missouri state line, US 169 alternates between freeways and surface streets. It follows I-35 to Shawnee Mission Parkway in Overland Park, then travels east to Rainbow Boulevard. US 169 then follows surface streets to its junction with I-70 near downtown Kansas City. US 169 and I-70 enter Missouri together just after crossing the Kansas River.

===Missouri===
US 169 exits I-70 shortly after both roads enter Missouri via the Lewis and Clark Viaduct. It crosses the Missouri River by the Buck O&#x27;Neil Bridge and serves Kansas City Downtown Airport. Northbound, US 169 becomes a freeway at 5th Street south of the Missouri River, however southbound it ceases being a freeway north of the airport. An at-grade private driveway exists just south of the intersection with Route 9 as well as for airport access. At the northern end of the city, an intersection was reconstructed at NE 108th Street in November 2013. US 169 is a freeway through I-435. This segment is also known as Arrowhead Trafficway, although this road neither passes nor approaches Arrowhead Stadium.

US 169 is a four-lane rural expressway until it reaches Smithville, where it reverts to a two-lane rural highway. In St. Joseph, it forms most of the Belt Highway, a major commercial strip on the eastern edge of town, paralleling just inside I-29. US 169 angles northeastward out of St. Joseph, passing through many rural communities before exiting Missouri north of Grant City.

US 169 intersects I-29 three times in Missouri: once in Gladstone, and twice in St. Joseph.

===Iowa===
US 169 enters Iowa just south of Redding. It intersects I-80 near De Soto. US 169 becomes an expressway at US 20, south of Fort Dodge. At Iowa Highway 7 on the northwest side of Fort Dodge it reverts to a two-lane highway again. This is changing, however, as a two-phase, $11 million project began in the spring of 2010 to widen the route to four lanes from Fort Dodge to Humboldt. US 169 passes through Humboldt and Algona before it leaves Iowa north of Lakota.

===Minnesota===

US 169 is a major north–south highway in Minnesota. It enters the state at Elmore. Shortly after, it junctions with I-90 at Blue Earth. It passes Mankato, crossing the Minnesota River. Between Mankato and the Twin Cities, US 169 is largely a rural highway. Before entering Le Sueur, US 169 crosses the Minnesota River again. At Shakopee, US 169 becomes a freeway, crossing the Minnesota River for a third time. The freeway ends in Champlin. US 169 crosses the Mississippi River at Anoka and follows concurrently with US 10 to Elk River, where US 169 splits off northbound through central Minnesota. The rest of the route in Minnesota is largely rural. The route passes the western side of Mille Lacs Lake. It terminates at US 53 in Virginia, in the Iron Range.

==History==

In Kansas, US 169 used to run concurrent with US 69 from I-35 through Downtown Kansas City, Kansas and the Fairfax District across the Platte Purchase Bridge to I-635 until splitting at I-29 in Missouri.

In Missouri, US 169 replaced Route 1 from Kansas City to St. Joseph, Route 4 from St. Joseph to Stanberry, and all of Route 29 from Stanberry to Iowa. The part of Route 1 north of Kansas City had been Route 33 south of, and Route 50 north of, Grayson from 1922 to 1926.

Prior to 2008, US 169 traveled east on I-435 in Lenexa and Overland Park, Kansas, and then it traveled north on Metcalf Avenue.

Prior to 1981, US 169 entered the Minneapolis, Minnesota.

<doc id="903241" wikidata="Q1284754" url="?curid=903241" title="Miladinov brothers">
<text>The Miladinov brothers (, ), Dimitar Miladinov (18101862) and Konstantin Miladinov (18301862), were Bulgarian poets, folklorists, and activists of the Bulgarian national movement in Ottoman Macedonia. They are best known for their collection of folk songs called &quot;Bulgarian Folk Songs&quot;, considered a milestone in Bulgarian literature, the greatest literary work in the history of Bulgarian folklore studies and the genesis of folklore studies during the Bulgarian National Revival. They also contributed to Bulgarian ethnography through their collection of folk material. Their third brother Naum (18171897) helped compile this collection too. Konstantin Miladinov is also famous for his poem Taga za Yug (Grief for the South) which he wrote during his stay in Russia.

In North Macedonia, the Miladinov brothers are celebrated as Macedonians who laid the foundation of the Macedonian national awakening and literary tradition. Many of the Miladinov brothers&#x27; original works have been unavailable to the general public and only censored versions, and redacted copies of them have been published there.

== Family and background ==
The mother of the Miladinov brothers was Sultana Miladinova. Her father was an Aromanian from Magarevo who moved to Ohrid and studied in Moscopole with Daniel Moscopolites. Sultana&#x27;s mother was a native of Ohrid and the granddaughter of &quot;sakellarios&quot; Pop Stefan, who was so fond of his pupil Dimitrius of Ioannou that he let him marry her. The brothers&#x27; father, Hristo Miladinov, was also from Magarevo. He was a pottery merchant, who moved to Struga in around 1810. The family had eight children, six sons and two daughters.

After the conquest of the Balkans by the Ottoman Empire, the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; disappeared as a designation for several centuries. Names such as &quot;Lower Moesia&quot; and &quot;Bulgaria&quot; were used for the northern and central parts of the modern Macedonian region. The name was revived in the early 19th century with the new Greek state and was affirmed in the modern area as a result of Hellenic religious and school propaganda. However, the Bulgarian national revival is considered to have opposed Greek domination of Bulgaria&#x27;s Slavic language and culture. The Miladinov brothers deliberately avoided using the term &quot;Macedonia&quot; in reference to the region, arguing that it presents a threat to the Bulgarian people there, and proposed the name &quot;Western Bulgaria&quot; instead. Miladinov and other educated Macedonian Slavs worried that the use of the designation &quot;Macedonian&quot; would imply an identification with the Greek nation.

== Dimitar Miladinov ==

Dimitar Miladinov was born around 1810 in the town of Struga in the Ottoman Empire (today North Macedonia), in the family of a potter named Hristo Miladinov and his wife, Sultana. Dimitar was the eldest of eight children, six boys and two girls.

In his youth, Dimitar was sent by his father to the Monastery of Saint Naum on Lake Ohrid, to receive basic education. Having spent four years at the monastery, at the age of twelve he continued his education in a Greek school in the town of Ohrid. Shortly after graduating as an outstanding student around 1830, he was invited by the citizens and spent two years teaching in the same school. Following the death of his father and the birth of his youngest brother Konstantin, Dimitar worked briefly as a bookkeeper in the trade chamber of the town of Durrës, today in Albania. From 1833 to 1836 he studied in Ioannina, in what was considered to be one of the best Greek high schools, where he mastered the Greek language. After graduating, Dimitar returned to Ohrid and continued teaching.

As a teacher, in 1836, Dimitar introduced the Bell-Lancaster method and expanded the school curriculum, adding philosophy, arithmetics, geography, Old Greek, Greek literature, Latin and French. He quickly became popular and respected among his students and peers. After two years, he left Ohrid and returned to Struga. From 1840 to 1842 he was a teacher in Kukush, today in Greece. He became active in the town&#x27;s social life, strongly opposing the phanariotes. In May 1845, the Russian Slavist Viktor Grigorovich visited him in Ohrid and realised that Miladinov had improper knowledge of Bulgarian language, and under his influence, Miladinov gained interest in Bulgarian. As his interest grew, he developed a Bulgarian national consciousness. Dimitar travelled around the Macedonian region, collecting folk material, which he informed Grigorovich about. In a letter written in Greek on 20 August 1852, he complained that most of the Bulgarians of Macedonia used Greek as the language of education and were considered Greeks. He called for opposition to the hellenisation of the Bulgarians. At the initiative of Dimitar, and with the approval of the city&#x27;s fathers, in 1858, the Greek language was banished from the churches and substituted with Church Slavonic. During this period, he translated the Acts of the Apostles into Bulgarian to make it available for church usage. In 1859, upon hearing that the town of Ohrid had officially demanded from the Ottoman government the restoration of the Bulgarian Patriarchate, Dimitar left Kukush and went to Ohrid to help. There, he translated Bible texts into Bulgarian. Dimitar tried to introduce the Bulgarian language into the Greek school in Prilep in 1856, causing an angry reaction from the local Grecomans. In a letter to &quot;Tsarigradski Vestnik&quot; (Tsarigrad Newspaper) on 26 March 1860, he wrote: &quot;In the holy Ohrid district, there is not a single Greek family, except for three or four Vlachs now, and all the others are purely a Bulgarian tribe.&quot; Due to his endeavours, the Greek bishop Miletos denounced Miladinov as a Russian agent. He was accused of spreading pan-Slavic ideas and was imprisoned in Istanbul, later to be joined by his supporting brother Konstantin. On 11 January 1862, he died in prison from typhus.

== Konstantin Miladinov ==
Konstantin Miladinov was the youngest son in the family of the potter Hristo Miladinov. He was born in 1830 in Struga. He studied in an elementary school in Ohrid. After his graduation from the Hellenic Institute at Ioannina and the University of Athens, where he studied literature, at the initiative of his brother, Dimitar, In 1856, he went to Russia. He arrived in Odessa and because he was short of money, the &quot;Bulgarian Society&quot; in that city financed his trip to Moscow. Konstantin enrolled at the Moscow University to study Slavic philology. While at the University of Athens, he was exclusively exposed to the teachings and thinking of ancient and modern Greek scholars. In Moscow, he came in contact with prominent Slavic writers and intellectuals. 

While in Moscow he desired to see the river Volga. At the time of his youth, the universal belief was that the Bulgars had camped on the banks of the river, had crossed it on their way to the Balkans and the origin of the name &quot;Bulgarians&quot; had come from the river&#x27;s name. After seeing the river, he wrote his impressions down in a letter to a friend: &quot;O, Volga, Volga! What memories you awake in me, how you drive me to bury myself in the past! High are your waters, Volga. I and my friend, also a Bulgarian, we dived and proudly told ourselves that, at this very moment, we received our true baptismal…&quot; While staying in Russia, he wrote his poem called Taga za Yug (Grief for the South), expressing his homesickness. Other poems he wrote include &quot;Bisera&quot; (Pearl), &quot;Zhelanie&quot; (Desire), &quot;Kletva&quot; (An Oath), &quot;Dumane&quot; (A Saying), &quot;Na chuzhdina&quot; (Abroad). 

He also helped his older brother Dimitar in editing the materials for the collection of Bulgarian songs, that Dimitar had collected in his field work. Konstantin had to transcribe the collected songs from the Greek alphabet in which they were recorded, into the Cyrillic alphabet. Initially, Konstantin tried to find assistance among Russian scholars to have the collection of folk songs published. After failing to find assistance, he went to Vienna to look for sponsors. The collection was subsequently published in Croatia with the support of the bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer, who was one of the patrons of Slavonic literature at that time. In a private letter to Bulgarian National Revival activist Georgi Rakovski on 8 January 1861, Konstantin Miladinov expressed concern over the use of the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; as it could have been used to justify Greek claims to the region and the local Bulgarian population, so he suggested that the region should be called &quot;Western Bulgaria&quot; instead. Shortly after the publication of the collection, he found out that his brother was jailed. He went to Istanbul to help him. Denounced by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as a dangerous Russian agent, he was arrested on 5 August 1861. It is unknown if he was placed in the same cell as his brother or whether he saw him. He died on 7 January 1862 in prison from typhus.

== Naum Miladinov ==
Naum Miladinov was the brother of Dimitar and Konstantin. He was born in 1817 and finished primary school in Struga. Later he went with his brother Dimitar to Duras, where Naum learned to play the violin. After that, together with Dimitar, Naum graduated from the Ioannina Greek High School and worked as his assistant teacher. From 1841 to 1844 he studied at the Halki seminary, where he graduated in music and grammar. In 1843 he wrote a music textbook and prepared a Greek grammar. After returning to Struga, Naum became involved in the activities of his brothers and became a proponent of the Bulgarian National Revival. He assisted in collecting materials for the collection &quot;Bulgarian Folk Songs&quot;. The folk songs collected by him are also notated. After 1878 he settled in the newly established Principality of Bulgaria. Naum received a national pension as a Bulgarian educator. He wrote a biography of his brothers, but failed to publish it. He died in 1897 in Sofia.

The two brothers are honoured in the history of the Bulgarian National Revival in the 19th century. The collecting of the folk material was well-received by its contemporaries - Lyuben Karavelov, Nesho Bonchev, Ivan Bogorov, Kuzman Shapkarev, Rayko Zhinzifov and others. The Russian scholar Izmail Sreznevsky, in his opinion about the collection, pointed out in 1863: &quot;It can be seen by the published collection that the Bulgarians are far from lagging behind other peoples in poetic abilities and even surpass them with the vitality of their poetry…&quot; Parts of the collection were also translated into Czech, Russian and German. Elias Riggs, an American linguist in Constantinople, translated nine songs into English and sent them to the American Oriental Society in Princeton, New Jersey. In a letter from June 1862, Riggs wrote: &quot;…The whole present an interesting picture of the traditions and fancies prevailing among the mass of the Bulgarian people.&quot;
The collection also had an impact on the development of modern Bulgarian literature, because its songs inspired the Bulgarian poets – Ivan Vazov, Pencho Slaveikov, Kiril Hristov, Peyo Yavorov, etc. Dimitar&#x27;s daughter Tsarevna Miladinova continued his Bulgarian nationalist efforts, co-founding the Bulgarian Girls&#x27; High School of Thessaloniki in 1882. Her son, (1884-1962) was a prominent Bulgarian jurist and historian, a professor of Bulgarian medieval law, and a specialist in Byzantine law at the Sofia University.

In post-war Yugoslav Macedonia, the Miladinov brothers were appropriated by the historians as part of the &quot;Macedonian National Revival&quot; and their original works were hidden from the general public. The Macedonian national museum did not display their original works. Their works were claimed to be Macedonian, despite them stating in their works that they were Bulgarians. Per political scientist Alexis Heraclides, the Miladinov brothers were among &quot;the earliest pioneers of a sense of Macedonian identity, as least as conceived by contemporary Macedonian historians and other scholars&quot;. The official view in North Macedonia is that the Miladinov brothers were Macedonians who spoke Macedonian and contributed to Macedonian literature. Their ethnicity is disputed between North Macedonia and Bulgaria.

Monuments honouring the brothers are in Blagoevgrad and Pliska, Bulgaria, and Struga, North Macedonia. There are streets, schools and chitalishta named after them in Bulgaria. Today in North Macedonia there are also schools named after the Miladinov brothers, but the pupils there do not have the access to the works of their schools&#x27; patrons in original, while redacted copies of them have been available there, without the designation &quot;Bulgarian&quot; in them.

The Miladinov brothers&#x27; hometown of Struga hosts the international Struga Poetry Evenings festival in their honour, including a poetry award named after them. The Miladinovi Islets near Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, are named after the brothers.

<text>U.S. Route 270 (US 270) is a spur of US 70. It travels for from Liberal, Kansas at US 54 and US 83 to White Hall, Arkansas at Interstate 530 (I-530) and US 65. It travels through the states of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. It travels through the cities of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Hot Springs, Arkansas, and McAlester, Oklahoma.

==Route description==

===Kansas===

US 270 begins in the southeast part of Liberal, Kansas, at an intersection with US 83 (running north–south through the intersection) and US 54. US 270 follows the south leg of this intersection, following US 83 south. US 270 only spends in Kansas before crossing into Oklahoma. Seward County is the only Kansas county that US-270 serves.

===Oklahoma===

US 270 enters Oklahoma in Beaver County, the eastern third of the Oklahoma Panhandle. From here it continues east along US 64, then south towards Beaver, the county seat, along SH-23. South of Beaver, the road joins with US 412 (OK) and SH-3, the latter of which US 270 will overlap with through most of northwest Oklahoma. After leaving the Panhandle and picking up US 183 near Fort Supply, the highways turn southwest towards Woodward. US 412 splits away in Woodward. US 270, concurrent with US 183 and SH-3, proceed southeast toward Seiling. West of Seiling, US 183 splits off to the south, but in Seiling, it is replaced by US 281. The routes continue southwest to Watonga, where US 270/281 turn south along SH-8, while SH-3 continues due east to concur with SH-33. In Geary, US 270 splits off on an independent alignment, looping through Calumet before joining with Interstate 40.

US 270 remains concurrent with I-40 from Exit 115 through Exit 181, a distance of . US 270, attached to I-40, runs through the core of the Oklahoma City Metro area, passing through the western suburbs of El Reno and Yukon into Oklahoma City proper. The partnership runs just south of Downtown and the Bricktown entertainment district on the Crosstown Expressway. Major interchanges with I-44 and I-35 (the latter involving a concurrency with the interstate and its accompanying US Highway, US 62) are found in the city. I-40/US 270 also serve two eastern suburbs of Oklahoma City, Del City and Midwest City and form the northern boundary between Midwest City&#x27;s civilian areas and Tinker Air Force Base. US-270 finally exits from I-40 on the west side of Shawnee.

US 270 serves most of the towns anchoring the area east of Oklahoma City, including Shawnee, Tecumseh, Seminole, Wewoka, and Holdenville. It continues southeast to the city of McAlester, a major southeastern Oklahoma city. It also serves many of the small towns east of McAlester, such as Krebs, Alderson, Bache, Haileyville, and Hartshorne.

After passing through Hartshorne, the roads curves to the northeast before turning onto a due east course taking it through Wilburton, Red Oak, and Wister. In Wister, it turns south, running across Wister Lake&#x27;s dam, and proceeding southeast to Heavener. There, it meets US 59, which it will follow for the rest of its time in Oklahoma. The town highways head south from Heavener, passing through the Wister Wildlife Management Area before entering the Ouachita National Forest. The route serves as the northern terminus of US 259 near Page. The road then squeezes into a valley between Black Fork Mountain and Rich Mountain. In this valley, it crosses the state line into Arkansas.

===Arkansas===

US 270 enters Arkansas with US 59, and runs east to Acorn, where it meets US 71. The route then travels 15 miles north on US 71 to Y City where it splits off and continues east. The route then meets AR 88 in Pencil Bluff and AR 27 in Mt. Ida before heading to Hot Springs. Entering the city, US 270 meets US 70 southwest of town and runs concurrent with it around Hot Springs using the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway before leaving the freeway and running along Malvern Avenue southeast of the city. US 270 intersects with I-30 just outside Malvern, running a short distance northeast on the freeway before interchanging with the George Hopkins Loop bypass and running south around the city. After meeting with US 67 east of town, the alignment then turns east-southeast meeting AR 229 in Poyen and AR 190/AR 291 in Prattsville before crossing paths with US 167 in Sheridan. The route trails east towards Pine Bluff terminating at and interchanging with I-530/US 65 in White Hall.

Directly east of this interchange, the highway used to continue along Sheridan Road before terminating at AR 365/Dollarway Road in northwest Pine Bluff. This former section of the route is now signed AR 365 Spur.

==History==
The route was extended into Arkansas in 1931, supplanting State Road 8 from Oklahoma to Acorn and State Road  6 between Y City and Hot Springs. The roadway was mostly gravel or graded earth, with some segments in the Ouachita Mountains still under construction upon designation. In 1935, the US 270 designation supplanted the remainder of State Road 6 between Hot Springs and US 65 west of Pine Bluff. By this time, the entire route was gravel surfaced.

Between February 1937 and January 1938, US-270 was extended into Kansas, and overlapped K-27 from Johnson north to US-50 in Syracuse, where it terminated. KDOT requested that US-270 be extended north along K-27 to I-70 south of Goodland. This request was denied by the American Association of State Highway Officials in an October 14, 1967 meeting. In a November 14, 1980 resolution, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved a request by KDOT to truncate US-270 to its current terminus in Liberal. Then in a May 18, 1981 resolution, US-270 was truncated to Liberal and the designation was removed from K-27.
==Future==
In Arkansas, it has been proposed that part of AR-51 will become part of US-270. On I-30&#x27;s current concurrency with US-270, going east, drivers can take exit 99 and make a right on US-270 East. If drivers make a left when they take exit 99, they must make a left to get on I-30 West/US-270 West because there is currently no outlet past that. That road has been proposed to be extended to AR-51. This will form the future northern terminus of AR-51. This means that drivers can make a left to get on AR-51 South and will have to make a right to get on US-270 West. Then, US-270 will meet the current US-270. Drivers can make a left to get on the future US-270 Business East and must make a right to get on US-270 West, just like AR-51 did. From east to west, the future US-270 will go through the cities of Rockport, Butterfield, and Magnet Cove.

<text>Grand Rapids Community College (GRCC) is a public community college in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

==History==
Grand Rapids Junior College was established on September 21, 1914, after University of Michigan faculty passed a resolution encouraging the establishment of junior colleges in Michigan. Grand Rapids Junior College was the first junior college in Michigan. The college operated out of Central High School, 421 Fountain St. NE, until 1924. The course offerings, based on University of Michigan offerings, were mathematics, history, rhetoric and composition, German, Latin, biology, and physics. All of them were focused on college transfer. The college&#x27;s first graduating class numbered 49 students, who paid $60 per year for tuition. The following year, to encourage enrollment, tuition was reduced to $40 per year for Grand Rapids residents and $50 for nonresidents. In 1918 Grand Rapids Junior College received its initial accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.

In 1944 the college acquired the Main Building from Grand Rapids Public Schools. Grand Rapids Public Schools Superintendent Arthur W. Krause closed Davis Technical High School to save costs and gave the building to Grand Rapids Junior College. The Main Building was renamed the Raleigh J. Finkelstein Hall in March 2019.

In 1990, Grand Rapids residents voted to separate the Junior College from the public school system and in 1991 GRJC became Grand Rapids Community College.

==Campuses==
Grand Rapids Community College has several campuses located throughout West Michigan.

GRCC&#x27;s main Campus in located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. GRCC&#x27;s downtown learning spaces include a Main Campus and DeVos Campus. These campuses are located adjacent to Grand Rapids Medical Mile and Heritage Hill Historic District.

Due to its location in downtown Grand Rapids, GRCC is close to local festivals and art shows such as ArtPrize and Festival of the Arts.

In addition to the main campus, Grand Rapids Community College has the GRCC Lakeshore Campus in Holland, Michigan at 12335 James St, Holland, located in the Shops at West Shore, and the Leslie Tassell MTEC, which houses career training programs. The Phyllis Fratzke Early Childhood Learning Laboratory houses daycare and early childhood programs.

==Facilities==
GRCC&#x27;s 11-block downtown campus includes several classroom buildings, including the historic Raleigh J. Finkelstein Hall, the Library and Learning Resource Center, Spectrum Theater, the Wisner-Bottrall Applied Technology Center, the Alfred P. Smith Music Building, the Gerald R. Ford Fieldhouse with a natatorium, the Student Center, and the Calkins Science Center, and the Cook Academic Building, which includes many of the college&#x27;s health careers programs. The Wisner-Bottrall Applied Technology Center includes The Heritage Restaurant, Fountain Hill Brewery, and the Secchia Piazza, all part of the college&#x27;s Secchia Institute for Culinary Education. College Park Plaza includes faculty offices and the Communications Department. The Juan R. Olivarez Student Plaza was named after the former president—the first Hispanic college president in Michigan—and includes a lion head fountain and veterans memorial. The DeVos Campus, located at 415 Fulton Street E. includes the Administration Building, Stewart White Hall, Sneden Hall, Steven C. Ender Hall and the Custer Alumni House.

==Athletics==
Grand Rapids Community College&#x27;s athletic teams compete as the Raiders in men&#x27;s baseball, basketball, golf, and cross country, and in women&#x27;s basketball, softball, cross country, and volleyball. A men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer program is scheduled to start in fall 2023. The college&#x27;s teams participate in Michigan Community College Athletic Association (MCCAA) competition. The school has won 70 MCCAA titles and been awarded the MCCAA All-sports Trophy 16 times.

GRCC is a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and has won numerous NJCAA district and regional championships and has appeared in national tournaments several times. The baseball team has won five NJCAA tournaments and the school has been national runner-up five times in five different sports. In addition, the Raiders&#x27; football team was honored by the NJCAA as the non-scholarship team national champion in 2005 and 2009, has played in national championship games in 1956, 1988, and 2005, and has played in 10 other bowl games.

Former GRCC sports include men&#x27;s cross country, swimming and diving, track and field, tennis, and wrestling, and women&#x27;s swimming and diving and tennis. GRCC discontinued its football team in January 2012.

<text>USS &quot;Fairfax&quot; (DD-93) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, later transferred for World War II service first to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Richmond&quot; (G88), a , and then to the Soviet Navy as Zhivuchy.

==Service history==
===USS &quot;Fairfax&quot;===
Named in honor of Rear Admiral Donald Fairfax, she was launched 15 December 1917 by Mare Island Navy Yard; sponsored by Mrs. H. George; and commissioned 6 April 1918, Lieutenant Commander Stanford Caldwell Hooper in command.

&quot;Fairfax&quot; arrived at Hampton Roads 6 June 1918 for convoy escort duty out of Newport News. She guarded convoys of troop transports to midocean meeting points with escorts who had come out of English and French ports to meet them. &quot;Fairfax&quot; also guarded convoys moving between coastal ports, and patrolled off the coast until 16 October, when she stood down Hampton Roads bound for Brest, France, escorting a troop convoy. On 18 October, she left her convoy to rescue 86 survivors of torpedoed , a Naval Overseas Transport Service ship, and on 27 October, arrived at Brest for patrol and escort duty in European waters.

On 3 December 1918, &quot;Fairfax&quot; arrived in the Azores to meet and escort to Brest, the transport &quot;George Washington&quot; carrying President Woodrow Wilson to the Peace Conference. She sailed for home 21 December, reaching Norfolk, Virginia 8 January 1919. Her post war operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean were broken in May 1919, when she sailed to the Azores to take up station as an observer of the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic made by Navy seaplanes. On 19 June 1922, she was decommissioned at Philadelphia, and placed in reserve.

Recommissioned 1 May 1930, &quot;Fairfax&quot; operated primarily on training cruises for members of the Naval Reserve during the following 2 years, based at Newport, Rhode Island, and Camden, New Jersey. On 12 March 1932 she sailed from Hampton Roads for San Diego, California, arriving 26 March. On the west coast, too, her primary duty was training reservists, but she also took part in gunnery exercises and fleet problems off Mexico, Central America, and the Panama Canal Zone.

&quot;Fairfax&quot; took part in the Presidential Review taken by Franklin D. Roosevelt in San Diego in March 1933, and then sailed for the East coast, where she continued her reserve training duty. She also patrolled in Cuban waters, and in the summers of 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940 sailed out of Annapolis training midshipmen of the Naval Academy. Between October 1935 and March 1937, she served with the Special Service Squadron out of Coco Solo and Balboa, Canal Zone, operating primarily on the Atlantic side of the Canal Zone.

The destroyer joined in representing the United States Navy at the opening of the New York City World&#x27;s Fair in April 1939, and after World War II broke out in Europe that fall, operated on neutrality patrol along with her training duties. On 21 November 1940, she arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she was decommissioned 26 November, and transferred to Great Britain under the destroyers for-land-bases exchange agreement.

===HMS &quot;Richmond&quot;===
The former &quot;Fairfax&quot; was commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Richmond&quot;, with the pennant number G88, on 5 December 1940. She arrived at Plymouth, England, on 1 February 1941, undergoing a refit to better suit her for escort work. This refit was completed in March, but &quot;Richmond&quot; ran aground at Holyhead on 23 March while on passage to Liverpool, and was under repair at Southampton until June.

Following repair, &quot;Richmond&quot; joined the Newfoundland Escort Force, responsible for escorting transatlantic convoys between Newfoundland and mid-Atlantic, when British based ships took over the escort. In October 1941, the ship returned across the Atlantic for refit at Cardiff, this continuing until December that year. &quot;Richmond&quot; then joined the 27th Escort Group based at Greenock on the Clyde. On 26 March &quot;Richmond&quot; formed part of the escort for the Arctic convoy PQ 14 on the initial leg from Scotland to Iceland, but was badly damaged in collision with the merchant ship &quot;Francis Scott Key&quot; and was under repair at Liverpool until July. In September 1942, &quot;Richmond&quot; joined the Halifax, Nova Scotia based Western Local Escort Force, escorting convoys from North American ports to off Newfoundland. In February 1943 &quot;Richmond&quot; was involved in another collision, this time with the merchant ship SS &quot;Reinholt&quot;, being sent to Liverpool for repair. In June 1943, she returned to Halifax, and convoy operations along the Canadian coast, serving as part of the Royal Canadian Navy from June until December 1943, when to free her crew for more modern escorts, she returned to the United Kingdom and was laid up on the Tyne. On 16 July 1944 she was transferred to the Soviet Navy.

===&quot;Zhivuchy&quot;===

The former &quot;Richmond&quot; was commissioned in the Soviet Navy as &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; (rus. Живучий, &quot;Survivable&quot;) on 24 August 1944. On 17 August 1944, &quot;Zhivuchy&quot;, as a member of the Russian Transfer Force, sailed to meet convoy JW 59. The convoy was attacked by U-boats until the convoy reached the Soviet Union on 25 August. On 22–23 November &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; was a member of the escort of convoy BK 38 comprising six transports and three tankers sailing from Archangel to Murmansk. At the beginning of December 1944, &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; was targeted by using a T5 acoustic torpedo. The torpedo missed and in response, the submarine was hunted by &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; and &quot;Deyatelny&quot;. On 6 December, &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; was among the Soviet vessels sent to augment the escort of convoy JW 62. The convoy arrived in the Soviet Union on 7 December. Before the return convoy RA 62 could sail, the Soviet Navy sent out a destroyer force, of which &quot;Zhivichy&quot; was a part of, to attack U-boats lying in wait at the entrance to Kola Inlet. During the engagement, &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; was targeted by on 9 December, which missed. The sinking of is disputed, with Soviet sources claiming &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; rammed and sunk the submarine while Rohwer claims that sank the submarine using depth charges.
From 3–5 January 1945, the Soviet convoy BK 41 sailed from Archangel to Murmansk composed of 14 ships. &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; was part of the initial escort, however on 4 January the escort was strengthened. The convoy reached port safely. On 7 January, &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; sailed with convoy JW 63 as part of its escort. Eight merchant vessels were brought from Kola Inlet to Molotovsk. On 16 January, &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; was part of the covering group for Soviet convoy KB 1 sailing from Kola Inlet to the White Sea. On 21 and 24 January &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; was among the destroyers sent to hunt U-boats between Jokanga and Kola. On 5 February &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; was among the escort for Soviet convoy BK 2 sailing from Archangel to Murmansk. On 11 February, the destroyer joined the escort of convoy JW 64 in order to escort 15 merchant vessels traveling to the White Sea. On 16 February, &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; was among the vessels sent to drive the gathered U-boats from the entrance to Kola Inlet. &quot;Zhivuchy&quot; was among the Soviet escorts for convoy RA 65 from Archangel to the Barents Sea from 21 to 25 March 1945. The Soviet Union returned the ship on 24 June 1949 to Britain, which sold her for scrap in July of that year.

<text>U.S. Route 176 (US 176) is a spur of US 76 in the U.S. states of North Carolina and South Carolina. The U.S. Highway runs from US 25 Business and North Carolina Highway 225 (NC 225) in Hendersonville, North Carolina, east to US 52 in Goose Creek, South Carolina. US 176 serves the transition region between the Blue Ridge Mountains and Foothills of Western North Carolina and the Upstate, Midlands, and Lowcountry regions of South Carolina. The highway passes through and connects Spartanburg, one of two major cities in the Upstate, and Columbia, the South Carolina state capital and central city of the Midlands. US 176 parallels and serves as a secondary highway to Interstate 26 (I-26) except for between Spartanburg and Columbia, where the U.S. Highway deviates from the I-26 corridor to serve Union.

==Route description==
US 176 spans in North Carolina and runs in South Carolina. The U.S. Highway is a part of the National Highway System in four locations in South Carolina. US 176 is part of the national system from I-85 Business near Spartanburg to South Carolina Highway 295 (SC 295) near Pacolet, during which the U.S. Highway is concurrent with either I-585 or SC 9. The highway&#x27;s second stretch of National Highway System is along its concurrency with SC 72 around Whitmire. US 176 is also part of the system along its concurrencies with US 21, US 76, and US 321 on Elmwood Street and Huger Street north of SC 12 in Columbia. The highway&#x27;s final section in which it is included in the National Highway System is during its concurrency with US 21 and US 321 from I-26 in Cayce to where US 321 splits from US 176 and US 21 south of Cayce.

===Hendersonville to Spartanburg===

US 176 begins at the southern end of Main Street in the city of Hendersonville. Main Street heads north into the downtown area as US 25 Business; the road also continues south as NC 225 (Greenville Highway). US 176 and US 25 Bus. head east concurrently along Spartanburg Highway, a four-lane highway with a center turn lane that heads through a commercial area and crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s W Line. The highway leaves Hendersonville and heads southeast through the town of East Flat Rock. US 25 Bus. reaches its southern terminus at US 176&#x27;s diamond interchange with US 25. US 176 reduces to two lanes and continues along a curvaceous path through the Blue Ridge Mountains, crossing the Green River. The road crosses the Henderson–Polk county line into the city of Saluda. US 176 and the railroad separate temporarily east of Saluda as they descend through the narrow valley of the North Pacolet River, with the railroad descending the inactive Saluda Grade, once the steepest standard gauge Class I railroad grade in the country.

At the opening of the North Pacolet River valley, US 176 follows Trade Street through the town of Tryon, where the highway meets the western end of NC 108 (Lynn Road). Southeast of Tryon, the U.S. Highway enters South Carolina, where it clips the northeastern corner of Greenville County. US 176 continues into Spartanburg County as Asheville Highway. In the town of Landrum, US 176 follows Howard Avenue and intersects SC 14 (Rutherford Street). The highway continues southeast across the South Pacolet River and through Campobello, the site of the highway&#x27;s junctions with SC 11 (Pine Street) and SC 357 (Holly Springs Road). US 176 passes through the hamlet of Gramling before passing through the town of Inman, where the highway expands to four lanes with intermittent center turn lane and intersects SC 292, which heads north as Main Street and south as Lyman Road.

US 176 expands to a four-lane divided highway just west of its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-26. On the northern edge of the unincorporated community of Southern Shops, the highway has a partial directional interchange with SC 56, which continues straight as Asheville Highway into Spartanburg while US 176 follows Pine Street. There is no access from northbound SC 56 to eastbound US 176. Just east of the SC 56 interchange, US 176 has a diamond interchange with I-85. At Upper Valley Falls Road, the U.S. Highway becomes a freeway between Southern Shops to the south and Valley Falls to the north. US 176 has a diamond interchange with Valley Falls Road and a partial cloverleaf interchange with East Campus Boulevard; both roads provide access to the University of South Carolina Upstate. Just east of East Campus Boulevard is US 176&#x27;s partial cloverleaf interchange with I-85 Business; there is no access to East Campus Boulevard from the ramp from southbound I-85 Business to westbound US 176.

US 176 continues east concurrent with I-585, with two-way frontage roads on both sides of the freeway. Just east of I-85 Business, there are ramps from eastbound US 176 and to westbound US 176 with the frontage roads. The frontage roads connect with California Avenue, which is accessed from the other direction by a half-diamond interchange after that street&#x27;s overpass. East of the California Avenue interchange, US 176 has a pair of diamond interchanges with SC 9 and US 221 as the U.S. Highway enters the city of Spartanburg. SC 9 heads north from the three-ramp partial diamond interchange as Boiling Springs Road; the roadway continues south as Church Street as SC 9 joins US 176 in a concurrency. The movement from SC 9 to westbound US 176 is made via California Avenue. The interchange with US 221 (Whitney Road) is a diamond interchange; there, I-585 reaches its southern terminus and US 176 continues as a six-lane divided highway through a commercial area. US 176 and SC 9 pass the campus of Wofford College, including Gibbs Stadium and Benjamin Johnson Arena, and the headquarters of the Southern Conference, of which Wofford is a part, and crosses Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Charlotte District. Southeast of the railroad, US 176 and SC 9 meet the eastern end of SC 296 (Daniel Morgan Avenue), pass along the west side of Converse College, and intersect US 29 (St. John Street) on the east side of downtown Spartanburg.

===Spartanburg to Columbia===

US 176 and SC 9 head east out of Spartanburg as a four-lane highway with center turn lane. Just west of the town of Pacolet, the road passes under the W Line, expands to a divided highway, and meets the eastern end of SC 295 (Southport Road). East of SC 295, SC 9 splits east as Pine Street to pass through Pacolet while US 176 bypasses the town to the south. The U.S. Highway intersects SC 150 (Glenn Springs Road) before entering Union County, where the highway&#x27;s name becomes Furman L. Fendley Highway. US 176 bypasses Jonesville while SC 9 passes directly through; east of the town, SC 9 veers east while SC 18 begins to parallel US 176 southeast to Union. US 176 intersects SC 215 (Buffalo West Springs Highway) and runs concurrently with the state highway on a four-lane road with center turn lane along the west side of town. The highways run concurrently with SC 49 between Rice Avenue, which SC 49 uses to bypass downtown Union, and Main Street. As US 176 and SC 215 curve east, they intersect SC 496 (Industrial Park Road/Union Boulevard), which is signed as SC 49 Truck. The bypass ends on the southern edge of town at the southern terminus of SC 18 (Pinckney Street). SC 215 heads east on Beltline Road while US 176 turns south onto Whitmire Highway.

US 176 continues south as a two-lane road, enters Sumter National Forest, and crosses the Tyger River. At the southern end of Union County, the U.S. Highway meets SC 72 and SC 121 (Carlisle Whitmire Highway) at a directional intersection. The three highways run concurrently on a four-lane undivided highway and cross the Enoree River into Newberry County and the town of Whitmire. There, SC 72 continues to the center of town on Union Street while US 176 and SC 121 follow Watson Street along the edge of town and head south as a two-lane road that crosses Duncan Creek. At Indian Creek, the U.S. Highway and state highway diverge southeasterly and southerly, respectively, shortly before US 176 exits the national forest at its junction with SC 34. US 176 has an oblique junction with SC 219 west of Pomaria, SC 773 within the town, and SC 202 east of the town. The highway meets the western end of SC 213 (Parr Road) west of the town of Peak before entering Richland County.

US 176 gradually edges closer to I-26 before meeting the Interstate at a partial cloverleaf interchange on the edge of the suburban area surrounding Columbia. The highway meets US 76 (Dutch Fork Road) at an oblique intersection and the two U.S. Highways head east together into the town of Irmo. The highways expand to a four-lane road with center turn lane and diverge at their partial cloverleaf interchange with I-26 (James F. Byrnes Expressway), at which US 76 joins the Interstate to head into Columbia. US 176 drops to two lanes and continues southeast into the town of St. Andrews, where the highway has an oblique junction with SC 60 (Lake Murray Boulevard) just west of Harbison State Forest. The highway expands to a four-lane road with center turn lane, passes by the Broad River Correctional Institution, and passes through the downtown area of St. Andrews, then has a diamond interchange with I-20. US 176 enters the city of Columbia, passes the Dutch Square mall, and curves east to cross the Broad River, the Columbia Canal, and Norfolk Southern&#x27;s W Line on the Broad River Bridge.

US 176 continues on the east side of the river as River Drive. At its junction with Clement Avenue and SC 16 (Sunset Drive), River Drive veers southeast and becomes two lanes. US 176 crosses over a CSX rail line before reaching an oblique intersection with Main Street, where the highway begins a lengthy concurrency with US 21 and US 321. The highways follow four-lane Main Street to the Elmwood Park Historic District, where the highways gain a fourth route, US 76, when they turn west onto six-lane divided Elmwood Avenue at the northern edge of downtown Columbia. One block to the west, the four U.S. Highways meet the western end of SC 48 (Assembly Street). A few blocks further to the west, Elmwood Avenue becomes a freeway carrying I-126 and US 76 west out of downtown Columbia; US 176, US 21, and US 321 exit the freeway at a full Y interchange onto six-lane divided Huger Street. South of another crossing of the W Line, the highways intersect the westbound and eastbound directions of SC 12 at Taylor Street and Hampton Street, respectively. South of their intersection with US 1 and US 378 (Gervais Street), US 176, US 21, and US 321 pass two blocks west of the Columbia Amtrak station before they reach Blossom Street, which carries US 21 Connector and US 76 Connector east through the University of South Carolina campus. The U.S. Highways follow four-lane divided Blossom Street west across the Congaree River out of the city of Columbia into Lexington County.

===Columbia to Goose Creek===
US 176, US 21, and US 321 follow Knox Abbott Drive, a four-lane street with center turn lane, west through the city of Cayce, where they intersect SC 2 (State Street) and SC 35 (12th Street). The highways briefly enter the city of West Columbia when they veer southwest onto Charleston Highway. The U.S. Highways pass under a rail line and have an oblique junction with SC 302 (Edmund Road) before re-entering Cayce. US 176, US 21, and US 321 become a divided highway as they pass historic Columbia Speedway, pass over another rail line, and meet the southern end of SC 2 (Frink Street) at a directional intersection that lacks a connection from the south-heading U.S. Highways to northbound SC 2. The U.S. Highways continue south as a four-lane road plus center turn lane that crosses a pair of creeks before expanding to a six-lane divided highway and meeting I-26 at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Just south of that interchange, US 176, US 21, and US 321 meet ramps from the southern terminus of I-77 (Veterans Memorial Freeway) opposite Fish Hatchery Road.

The three U.S. Highways reduce to four lanes and cross over CSX&#x27;s Columbia Subdivision east of the town of Pine Ridge. US 321 continues south toward Gaston and Swansea while US 176 and US 21 head southeast along Charleston Highway, which drops to two lanes. The two U.S. Highways meet I-26 at a partial cloverleaf interchange and briefly parallel the Interstate as they enter Calhoun County, where the highway is known as Old State Road. The highways diverge at Sandy Run, where US 21 heads south on Columbia Road toward Orangeburg and US 176 continues on Old State Road. West of St. Matthews, the U.S. highway runs concurrently with SC 6 between Caw Caw Road and Bridge Street. US 176 intersects US 601 (St. Matthews Road) and crosses over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s SC Line south of the county seat of Calhoun County. The highway intersects SC 33 (Cameron Road) in the town of Cameron before leaving Calhoun County.

Shortly after entering Orangeburg County, US 176 intersects US 301 (Five Chop Road) just west of the latter highway&#x27;s junction with SC 47. The highway intersects SC 210 (Vance Road) at the crossroads of Providence northwest of the U.S. Highway&#x27;s diamond interchange with I-95. At Wells, US 176 has a five-way intersection with US 15 (Bass Drive) and SC 45 (Branchdale Highway). The highway meets the eastern end of SC 314 (Bunch Ford Road) west of the town of Holly Hill and SC 310 (Camden Road) just inside the town limits. In the center of town, US 176 has a pair of intersections with SC 453, Eutaw Road and Gardner Boulevard, on either side of a grade crossing of CSX&#x27;s Charleston Subdivision.

US 176 enters Berkeley County by crossing the Dean Swamp, a tributary of the Four Hole Swamp. The U.S. Highway, which is named State Road, intersects SC 27 (Old Gilliard Road) and SC 311 shortly after entering the highway. US 176 heads southeast through a mixture of swamp and forest with occasional farmland before entering the suburban area around Charleston at its junction with US 17 Alternate (Live Oak Drive) on the edge of the city of Goose Creek. The highway continues as St. James Avenue, a four-lane road with center turn lane. US 176 expands to six lanes shortly before reaching its eastern terminus at an oblique intersection with US 52 (Goose Creek Boulevard). There is no direct access from eastbound US 176 to northbound US 52; that movement is made via Thomason Boulevard a few blocks to the northwest.

==Major intersections==




























==Special routes==
===Spartanburg alternate route===

U.S. Route 176 Alternate (US 176 Alt.) was an alternate route in Spartanburg. It was established around 1938 after mainline US 176 was rerouted onto Asheville Highway and Church Street; the alternate route continued along the old route via Magnolia, Howard, and Main Streets. In 1948, it was downgraded to secondary road S-42-2. Some map inserts of the time list it as &quot;US 176 Optional&quot; (US 176 Opt.).

===Spartanburg connector route 1===

U.S. Route 176 Connector (US 176 Conn.) is a connector route that connects US 221 (North Church Street) in the northern part of Spartanburg with I-585/US 176/SC 9 (North Pine Street) just north of the city. It is known as North Church Street and is an unsigned highway.

===Spartanburg connector route 2===

U.S. Route 176 Connector (US 176 Conn.) is a connector route that connects US 221 (North Church Street) with I-585/US 176/SC 9 (North Pine Street) in the northern part of Spartanburg. It travels just north of Spartanburg Medical Center. It is known as East Wood Street and is an unsigned highway.

===Union business loop===

U.S. Route 176 Business (US 176 Bus) was a business loop through downtown Union, via Thompson Boulevard and Pinckney Street. It was established around 1956, when the Duncan Bypass was completed and mainline US 176 was realigned along it. Around 1990, US 176 Bus was decommissioned and replaced by an extension of SC 18.

=== Union connector ===

U.S. Route 176 Connector (US 176 Conn.) is a connector route in Union. It connects US 176 (North Duncan Avenue) and South Carolina Highway 18 (SC 18; Thompson Road), along Connector Road. Its entire length is part of SC 18 Truck.

It officially appears on county and state maps, while highway signage identifies it as &quot;TO&quot; US 176. It was created when US 176 was rerouted onto new alignment north of Union, with the elimination of US 176 Business and extension of SC 18; Connector Road was originally part of Duncan Bypass, built around 1956.

===Whitmire connector route===

U.S. Route 176 Connector (US 176 Conn.) is a connector route in the eastern part of Whitmire. It connects South Carolina Highway 72 (SC 72; Church Street / Union Street) and US 176 (Watson Street). It shares the Church Street name with SC 72 and is an unsigned highway.

<text>Sidney Johnston Catts (July 31, 1863 – March 9, 1936) was an American politician, businessman, and anti-Catholic activist. He served as the 22nd governor of Florida from 1917 to 1921 as a member of the Prohibition Party, despite being a Democrat for most of his career. He became involved in criminal procedures due to his activities as governor and for business activities. Although he was later acquitted, he went bankrupt in the process.

==Early life==

Sidney Johnston Catts was born on his father&#x27;s plantation in Pleasant Hill, Alabama on July 31, 1863, to Adeline Rebecca Smyly and Samuel W. Catts, a Confederate captain, and was named after Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston. In 1866, his nurse accidentally stabbed one of his eyes with a pair of scissors while cutting pictures causing him to lose sight in it.

He earned a law degree from Cumberland School of Law at Cumberland University in 1882. In 1885, he was ordained as a pastor and worked in Alabama until 1910, when he moved to Florida. He later became an insurance salesman and then a teacher. In November 1886, he married Alice May Campbell, a relative of Lord Colin Campbell.

==Career==
===U.S. House of Representatives campaigns===

In March 1904, Catts announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination against James Thomas Heflin to represent Alabama&#x27;s 5th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. During the campaign Catts gave $250 to another politician to canvass a county, but that politician later placed a bet using the money that Heflin would win. Heflin defeated Catts in the primary and following his defeat Catts endorsed Heflin.

On April 7, 1930, he announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination in Florida&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, but was defeated by incumbent Representative Tom Yon in the Democratic primary.

===1916 gubernatorial campaign===

In 1914, Catts announced that he would run for the Democratic nomination for governor of Florida. Catts would be the first political candidate to campaign using an automobile in Florida (a Ford Model T). This would give him an advantage by visiting areas in the state that were isolated and did not receive of other candidates who wanted to visit towns that were close to or on railroads. For many in the state, it would be the first time they would ever see a car. He would compete against William V. Knott who called &quot;economy in government&quot; , equalizing tax laws, making pensions for Civil War veterans bigger and improving roads. Catts would also mount a loudspeaker to his car as well. He would once claim that a group of Catholics in Apalachicola were planning to assassinate him and he said that his would force him to bring revolvers with him.

==== Democratic primary and recount ====
Catts would win the Democratic Party&#x27;s primary that was held on June 6, 1916. The Bryan Primary law would require that voting provide for a first and second choice ballot in the case of a runoff. Many voters didn&#x27;t understand the procedure and ended up casting only first choice ballots. Some of the election officials would insist later on that voters were not aware the second choice votes were supposed to be counted as well. Both Catts and Knots would accuse each other of voter fraud. When all ballots were counted it was announced that Catts received 33,429 votes while Knott got 33,169. Knott would go to court demanding that a recount occur. Catts would say that he would run in the general election no matter what would legally happen. The Florida Supreme Court would rule on August 9 that Knott had won the primary by 21 votes. The Prohibition Party would hold a convention during late June where they nominated Catts for governor. On October 10, Catts would ask for the Prohibition Party to have him as a candidate in the main election.

After the primary, he would take 7 trips across the state between June and November. During this time most of his messaging from prior to the primaries would remain the same. However, he would attack the Catholic church saying that they had provided funds that were used for the recount.

=== Governorship ===

==== Inauguration ====

Catts was inaugurated as governor on January 2, 1917. During the parade, cars would be used for the first time and replace buggies that were previously used with 50 cars participating in the parade. The Model T that Catts had used was adorned with a sign saying: &quot;THIS IS THE CAR THAT GOT ME HERE&quot; and his son Rozier would drive the car for him. Democratic justices of the Florida Supreme Court would refuse to take their places that were designated in the parade until Catts&#x27; attorney, W.W. Flournoy persuaded them to. The inauguration itself would be the first Florida inauguration to filmed. In his inauguration speech, Catts stated:Your triumph is no less in this good hour in beautiful Florida, for you have withstood the onslaughts of the county and state political rings, the corporations, the railroads, the fierce opposition of the press and organization of the negro voters of this state against you and the power of the Roman Catholic hierarchy against you. Yet over all of these the common people of Florida, the everyday cracker people have triumphed.
Towards the end of the day, an inaugural ball and banquet would be held. He and his wife would refuse to participate in the inaugural ball. Catts would opt out of having the traditional punch that was served at the inaugural banquet.

==== Tenure ====
During his first message to the state legislature Catts would call for statewide prohibition, abolition of the convict lease system, an inheritance tax that would be graduated, more power for the state tax commission to investigate large corporations that were avoiding taxation, manual labor colleges for boys and girls, elimination of the Bryan primary law, taxation of church property and adoption of a guarantee law for banks. His address to the legislature was described as being well received by the press in Florida. The 1917 session of the state legislature would accomplish close to nothing in the end.

At the onset of World War I as Florida teemed with a never-before-seen wave of Anti-German sentiment, Catts attempted to exploit this to further his own anti-Catholic and racist agendas. The governor publicly theorized that the German-American monks of Saint Leo Abbey in Pasco County were planning to arm Florida&#x27;s black community for a popular revolt in favor of Kaiser Wilhelm II, after which Pope Benedict XV would take over Florida and move the Holy See to nearby San Antonio (itself a largely German and Catholic community) and close all Protestant churches. These speeches caused some German-Americans in the area to migrate to other parts of the United States. The abbot of St. Leo, Right Rev. Charles Mohr, OSB, published several dignified responses to these conspiracy theories. In support of the St. Leo monks, many Pasco County Protestants made it a point to appear in public with local Catholics. Because of the backlash, Catts was forced to tone down his rhetoric when in the area.

In April 1917, he admitted that he sent an insulting letter to Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory asking for Black Campbell, his brother-in-law who was in federal prison due to stealing $1,000 while serving as a bookkeeper in an Alabama bank, to be given a pardon.

In, 1919 Catts publicly labeled black residents as part of &quot;an inferior race,&quot; and refused to criticize two lynchings. He was quoted in the press as saying that &quot;only the vagrant, vagabond, worthless negro is lynched&quot;. When the NAACP complained about these lynchings, Catts wrote denouncing the organization and blacks generally, declaring that &quot;Your Race is always harping on the disgrace it brings to the state by a concourse of white people taking revenge for the dishonoring of a white woman, when if you would . . . [teach] your people not to kill our white officers and disgrace our white women, you would keep down a thousand times greater disgrace.&quot;

During April 1919, Catts would request the US Department of Labor abolish the Florida Division of Negro Economics. He would also say at the same time that he wanted the US Employment Service&#x27;s head to be replaced with a personal friend of his. He accused the black officers of the Division of inciting race riots and also said they encouraged miscegenation.

Mulberry in Polk County would witness strikes from phosphate miners starting in May 1919. 3,000 workers who were both black and white would end up participating. Catts along with Sheriff Logan would tour the strike zone. After doing the tour he would make an announcement saying he was in support of those who were striking. The mining companies would respond to strikes by importing black laborers as replacements for those who were on strike. Miners who were on strike would at one point ambush a car convoy carrying these workers in the outskirts of Bartow killing a strikebreaker and wounding a mine guard who was a deputy sheriff. Another significant event during the strikes was when a group of 4 white guards from Prairie Pebble Mine would fire on Mulberry, resulting in the deaths of 3 African Americans. Sheriff Logan would arrest and jail the guards in Bartow. Catts would end up removing Logan from his office because he felt he did not do enough to prevent violence in the first place.

==Later life==

Catts was ineligible to run for reelection in 1920, and he ran for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, but lost by a large margin to incumbent Democratic Senator Duncan U. Fletcher.

On April 14, 1921, the Florida Senate voted to approve a resolution that would order a legislative investigation into Catts&#x27; pardons and appointments due to rumors about him accepting bribes in exchange for them and the state house voted to approve it four days later. On May 5 he was indicted by the Bradford county grand jury for accepting a $700 bribe to pardon J. J. Coleman, who was given life imprisonment in 1918 for the murder of a deputy sheriff, but resisted arrest for five days before surrendering. However, on May 19 a federal warrant against him was issued for the involuntary servitude of two black people forced to work on his plantation and was arrested two days later and stated that &quot;my enemies won&#x27;t let me alone&quot; when arrested. While on bond awaiting trial Catts spoke at an Independence Day celebration in Macon, Georgia despite protests from members of the board of aldermen who stated that it was improper to have somebody that was indicted for criminal charges speak. On August 16, 1921, he stated that he was confident that he would be acquitted on all charges. In November his initial indictment was recharged and two other indictments were also issued. On May 16, 1922, his defense&#x27;s motion to dismiss the indictments against Catts&#x27; bribery charges was accepted by the judge. On July 21 he filed a petition of voluntary bankruptcy as he had $44,000 in liabilities and less than $2,000 in assets. On November 20 he was acquitted by an all white jury for the involuntary servitude and bribery charges and the federal charges against him were later dropped.
Shortly after he left office he became involved in a company with F. L. Jester and in September 1921, he was called before a superior court for questioning for his involvement in a fraudulent business.

Catts ran for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1924 and 1928, but lost both times. During the 1928 presidential election he was one of the Democrats who supported Republican Herbert Hoover over Democrat Al Smith, who was Catholic.

On April 9, 1929, Catts was indicted by a federal grand jury in Jacksonville for aiding and abetting in counterfeiting money with multiple other people in a plan to distribute $1,000,000 in counterfeited money. His first trial in October resulted in a mistrial and was acquitted at his second trial.

Catts would end up spending the final 8 years of his life in DeFuniak Springs where he would get involved with real estate and farming there.

On March 9, 1936, Catts died at his home, Sun Bright, in DeFuniak Springs, Florida at the age of 72. In 1979, the house he lived in from 1924 to 1936 was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

== Personal life ==
His wife Alice gave birth to a son, Sidney J. Catts Jr. on July 22, 1894, in Fort Deposit, Alabama. Catts Jr. would become a lawyer and eventually go into politics just like his father did. One of his sons, Rozier would eventually marry a Catholic woman from Key West. Catts would accept her as part of the family and say that any father should welcome the wife of his son no matter what her religion is. When Catts moved back to DeFuniak Springs for the final 8 years of his life, he was known to distill and drink peach brandy.

Catts was involved with Freemasonry. He was also a Woodman of the World and a member of the Knights of Pythias.

<text>Foxfire is a 1996 American teen drama film directed by Annette Haywood-Carter. Based on the Joyce Carol Oates novel &quot;&quot;, it examines the coming of age of four high school girls who meet up with a mysterious and beautiful drifter.

==Plot==
Maddie Wirtz is a high school senior living in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon. Her plans to coast through her last school year before college are waylaid when she meets another teenage girl, &quot;Legs,&quot; a drifter who takes shelter from the rain inside Maddie&#x27;s school. The same day she meets them, Legs convinces Maddie and fellow students Rita Faldes and Violet Kahn to confront Mr. Buttinger, a teacher who has been sexually harassing Rita and Violet. Maddie, Rita, and Violet flee after the confrontation turns violent, witnessed by student Goldie Goldman, who flees with them. Later, Legs finds Maddie at her house from the address in a notebook Maddie dropped in Mr. Buttinger&#x27;s classroom. Legs spends the night at Maddie&#x27;s house and bonds with her further in the morning before school.

At school, Maddie, Rita, Violet, and Goldie are suspended for the confrontation with Mr. Buttinger, despite their explanation of what happened. After getting kicked out of school, the girls go to an abandoned house where Maddie suggested Legs stay, finding Legs there. All five girls quickly form a close bond, with the abandoned house as their &quot;headquarters&quot; and engaging in further acts of rebellion, such as breaking into the school to retrieve part of Maddie&#x27;s art school application (which the principal refused to let her get before she got kicked out) and Legs tattooing a flame on all of them. Legs and Maddie also learn Goldie&#x27;s father physically abuses her. Everything culminates when the girls crash a car stolen from a group of boys who were about to rape Maddie in &quot;revenge&quot; for what happened to Mr. Buttinger.

Though not seriously injured, the girls go on trial for stealing the car, with the boys and one of their girlfriends, Cindy, lying about the events leading up to it. Legs is sent to a juvenile prison and the group flounders without her, with Goldie starting to use heroin. Eventually, Cindy, feeling guilty, tells the judge the truth, leading to Legs&#x27; release.

The girls&#x27; reunion is tempered by Legs learning of Goldie&#x27;s addiction; Maddie has taken her to the abandoned house to detox. To help her, Legs leads Maddie, Rita, and Violet to Goldie&#x27;s house to demand $10,000 from her parents to send Goldie to rehab. The situation escalates when Goldie&#x27;s father refuses and Legs, holding him at gunpoint, forces the others to take him to the abandoned house. He is tied to a chair while the girls try to think of what to do next, and the tension rises as Legs begins taking her own paternal frustrations out on him. Amid the chaos, Rita accidentally shoots Goldie&#x27;s father in the shoulder.

Panic ensues and the girls resolve to get Goldie&#x27;s father to the hospital. When Goldie, Rita, and Violet leave with Goldie&#x27;s father, Maddie realizes Legs is missing. She finds Legs walking along the bridge, looking for a ride to another town. Both girls make proposals, Maddie for Legs to stay with her and the others and Legs for Maddie to join her on the road. Sad but resolute, the two eventually go their separate ways. Legs gets a truck to stop and boards as Maddie watches it disappear.

In a voice-over, it is revealed that Maddie reunited with her boyfriend, finished high school, and went on to attend art school in New York City. She travels the world, always stopping at airports and bus stops along the way. Although none of the group ever see Legs again, they still get together once in a while and strengthen their bond over the past.

<text>Sandals are an open type of shoe, consisting of a sole held to the wearer&#x27;s foot by straps going over the instep and around the ankle. Sandals can also have a heel. While the distinction between sandals and other types of footwear can sometimes be blurry (as in the case of &quot;huaraches&quot;—the woven leather footwear seen in Mexico, and peep-toe pumps), the common understanding is that a sandal leaves all or most of the foot exposed. People may choose to wear sandals for several reasons, among them comfort in warm weather, economy (sandals tend to require less material than shoes and are usually easier to construct), and as a fashion choice. Usually, people wear sandals in warmer climates or during warmer parts of the year in order to keep their feet cool and dry. The risk of developing athlete&#x27;s foot is lower than with enclosed shoes, and the wearing of sandals may be part of the treatment regimen for such an infection.

==Name==
The English word &quot;&quot; derives under influence from Middle French from the Latin and is first attested in Middle English in the form . The Latin term derived from Greek &quot;sandálion&quot; (), the diminutive of &quot;sándalon&quot; (), of uncertain origin. In Greek, the names referred to particular styles of women&#x27;s sandals rather than being the general word for the category of footwear. Similarly, in Latin, the name was also used for slippers, the more common term for Roman sandals being , whence English &quot;sole&quot;. The English words &quot;sand&quot; and &quot;sandalwood&quot; are both false cognates.

== History ==

Although some other kinds of footwear like carbatina are as simple to make, sandals are the oldest known footwear at present. Pairs of sagebrush sandals discovered in 1938 at Fort Rock Cave in Oregon, USA, were later dated to 10,500 to 9,300years ago.

The ancient Egyptians wore sandals made of palm leaves, papyrus, andat least in grave goodsgold. Egyptian statues and reliefs show sandals both on the feet and carried by sandal-bearers. According to Herodotus, papyrus footwear was part of the required dress of the Egyptian priests. The sandals of Mesopotamia (&quot;Biblical sandals&quot;) were typically made of rawhide and straw (dried grasses). The wealthy sometimes used gems or gold or silver beads on the thongs.

Straw shoes, sometimes in the form of sandals and sometimes carbatinae, were ubiquitous Chinese footwear in antiquity.

In Ancient Greece, &quot;sandalia&quot; proper were a kind of sandal principally worn by women. The sole was made of wood, cork, or leather and the upper chiefly consisted of a strap between the big toe and second toe and another around the ankle. The sandal of Homer was the &quot;pédila&quot; (). By the Classical Period, the general term for sandals was &quot;hypódēma&quot; (). Most forms included a strap across the toes (, &quot;zygòs&quot;), another strap between the big and second toe, and a third across the instep (); this last was frequently made with metal shaped like a heart or leaf. The &quot;rhaḯdia&quot; () extended the straps of the sandal up the calf. Some Greek sandalslike the women&#x27;s &quot;tyrrēniká&quot; ()employed wooden soles. The effeminate baxea (, &quot;páxeia&quot;) was usually made of willow leaves, twigs, or fibers and was associated with comic actors and philosophers. The tragedians wore the cothurnus (, &quot;kóthornos&quot;), sandal-like boots that rose above the midcalf and typically incorporated platform soles that led to others wearing them to appear taller. By the Hellenistic Period, some sandals show evidence of extreme ornamentation. One found from the settlements in Greek Crimea was a platform design with 12 separate layers in its sole and gold decoration.

Because of the general discomfort of the typical upper-class calceus, it was standard in ancient Rome to switch to sandals ( or ) or slippers at home and it was considered an oddity of Augustus that he seldom did so. However, wearing comfortable shoes in public was considered effeminate and discussion of the habit was used as an insult by politicians and writers. Scipio the Elder, Verres, Antony, Germanicus, and Caligula were all pointedly reproached for doing so and the stigma did not die off until at least the reign of Hadrian. Because shoes were removed when reclining on couches to dine, it was normal to wear slippers or sandals to meals even at other houses. Because of the stigma, however, when a litter carried by slaves could not be used between the two houses, it was considered proper to walk to the other house in calcei while carrying the shoes to be removed under the arm. The guest would change in the entryway and then have slaves remove the second pair of shoes in the dining room.

In his autobiography Edward Carpenter told how sandals came to be made in England:
== Construction ==
A sandal may have a sole made from rubber, leather, wood, tatami or rope. It may be held to the foot by a narrow thong that generally passes between the first and second toe, or by a strap or lace, variously called a latchet, sabot strap or sandal, that passes over the arch of the foot or around the ankle. A sandal may or may not have a heel (either low or high) or heel strap.

== Variants ==
* Barefoot sandals, footwear with the appearance of sandals but lacking a sole.
* Birkenstock sandals, a comfortable and trendy sandal made from cork.
*Caligae, a heavy-soled classical Roman military shoe or sandal for marching, worn by all ranks up to and including centurion
* Carbatina, open footwear worn in ancient Greece, Italy and the Middle East
* Clip-on sandals or clip-toe sandals, similar to flip-flops
* Crocs, clog like shoes from a synthetic, rubbery, waterproof material, created in the United States in 2002
* Clog can be formed as a heavy sandal, having a thick, typically wooden sole
* Crochet sandals
* Fisherman sandal is a type of T-bar sandal originally for men and boys. The toes are enclosed by a number of leather bands interwoven with the central length-wise strap that lies along the instep. An adjustable cross strap or bar is fastened with a buckle. The heel may be fully enclosed or secured by a single strap joined to the cross strap. The style appears to have originated in France.
* Flip-flops (called thongs in Australia) are typically cheap and suitable for beach, pool, or locker room wear
* Geta, a classical Japanese form of elevated thong, traditionally of cryptomeria wood; the crosspiece is referred to as a &quot;ha&quot;, which translates to &quot;tooth&quot;
* Grecian sandal, sandals from Greece and Salento (Italy), a (generally flat or low) sole attached to the foot by interlaced straps crossing the toes and instep, and fastening around the ankle. A similar style is sometimes called gladiator sandal
* High-heeled sandal, a type of sandal with an elevated heel. They allow the wearer to have an open shoe while being less casual or more formal, depending on the style of the sandal.
* Hiking and trekking sandals are designed for hiking or trekking in hot and tropical climates, usually using robust rubber outsole, suitable for any terrain, and softer EVA or Super EVA foam insole. These sandals are usually shaped to support the arched contour of the foot. The straps are usually made of polyester or nylon webbing for quick drying after exposure to water and to minimize perspiration. Also suitable for many other adventure sports and activities where quick drying and reduced perspiration is required, including rafting, traveling, paragliding, skydiving.
* Ho Chi Minh sandals is one name for a homemade or cottage industry footwear, the soles cut from an old automobile tire and the straps cut from an inner tube. Made and worn in many countries, they became wider known in the US as worn by the rural people of Indochina during the Vietnam War, leading to the name.
* Huarache, a Mexican sandal, with sole made of a tire tread, or huarache (running shoe), a flat sandal used by minimalist runners.
* Jelly sandals or jelly shoes were originally a version of the classic fisherman sandal made in PVC plastic. They were invented in 1946 by Frenchman Jean Dauphant in response to a post-war leather shortage. Later designs featured translucent soft plastic in bright colours; hence the later name of jelly sandals or jellies. Recently, a whole range of styles have been produced in this material, mainly for women and girls, but the classic unisex design remains popular.

* Jipsin, a traditional Korean sandal made of straw
*Ojota, an extremely durable Peruvian sandal made of recycled tires that is traditionally worn in the Andes by Quechua people.

The toe is often pierced with a pattern of holes or slots. The sole is low-heeled and usually of crepe rubber, stitched-down to the upper. First seen in Europe and America in the early 20th century, by the 1950s they were very common for boys and girls up to their teens, but are now mainly worn by much younger children. This style or similar styles are also called &quot;Mary Jane&quot; shoes.

<text>USS &quot;Monticello&quot; (LSD-35) was a , the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Monticello, Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s home in Virginia.

&quot;Monticello&quot; was laid down on 6 June 1955 by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., Pascagoula, Mississippi; launched on 10 August 1956; sponsored by Mrs. Harry R. Sheppard, wife of Congressman Harry R. Sheppard of California; and commissioned on 29 March 1957.

==Service history==
After outfitting and trials off the East Coast, Monticello arrived at her home port, NS San Diego, on 27 May 1957 to join Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet, and immediately began shakedown training. She continued to operate off the Pacific coast, joining in major amphibious training operations which took her to Eniwetok in 1958 and Hawaii and Alaska in 1959, serving usually as primary control ship. Such operations, involving ships of all types along with underwater demolition teams and Marines, keep the fleet at top readiness for any challenge of diplomatic crisis or war itself.

On 14 November 1960, &quot;Monticello&quot; sailed for a seven-month deployment with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific. She was combat-loaded with part of a Marine reinforced battalion landing team, and was alerted four times during the Laos crisis, steaming with and four escorting destroyers in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Siam. Returning to San Diego in July, &quot;Monticello&quot; joined in a joint Army-Navy-Air Force amphibious exercise at San Juan Island, Washington, in September, then returned to fleet training operations from her home port.

&quot;Monticello&quot; sailed on 18 February 1962 in JTF 8 for nuclear weapons tests at Christmas Island, first carrying cargo between Christmas Island and San Diego, and then acting as command ship during tests of antisubmarine weapons, as part of Operation Dominic. In June, she sailed again to Christmas Island to aid in closing down the test operation, and continued to a second 7th Fleet tour of duty highlighted by a large amphibious exercise at Okinawa. She returned to San Diego and a program of training with Camp Pendleton marines, necessary overhaul, and refresher training early in December.

She again joined the 7th Fleet&#x27;s Amphibious Ready Group from January to October 1964, taking part in SEATO as well as U.S. exercises.

After operating on the Atlantic coast through much of 1965, &quot;Monticello&quot; headed back to the western Pacific in August. Early in 1966, she steamed to South Vietnam for &quot;Operation Double Eagle&quot; the longest and largest amphibious operation of the Vietnam War up to that time. It enabled Allied forces to engage Viet Cong near Thac Tru and secure a beachhead in a key area. At the operation&#x27;s conclusion, on 26 February, she headed for Subic Bay en route home via Hong Kong, Yokosuka, and Pearl Harbor.

After overhaul at San Pedro and training along the Pacific coast, &quot;Monticello&quot; got underway from San Diego on 13 January 1967, heading for the Far East. Much action awaited her in Vietnam. She served as primary command ship for Operation Beacon Hill I in Quảng Trị Province from 20 March to 2 April and Beacon Star there from 22 April to 12 May. She joined in Operation Bell in the latter half of May, in Operations Beacon Torch and Bear Chain in July, and in August participated in Operation Kangaroo Kick, an amphibious feint off Huế, and Operation Belt Drive, again at Quang Tri. Relieved at Da Nang in September. &quot;Monticello&quot; returned to San Diego on 13 October. After an overhaul that lasted until early 1968, &quot;Monticello&quot; conducted refresher training and local operations out of San Diego. In November of that year, she once again deployed to Vietnam where she remained into 1969.

: [&quot;1969-1985&quot;]

&quot;Monticello&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1985 and transferred to the US Maritime Administration on 2 August 1991. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 24 February 1992 and she was sold on 29 September 1995 to Pegasus Inc for scrapping. She was repossessed by the Navy on 1 July 1997 after the failure of Pegasus to dismantle the ship and was re-transferred to the United States Maritime Administration and docked in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, Benicia, California. Ex-&quot;Monticello&quot; was environmentally cleaned to be used for target practice by Marad Contract #N00140-03C-A002 from 9 March through 27 April 2006 and then the vessel was returned to the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet.

Ex-&quot;Monticello&quot; was withdrawn from the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, Benicia, California on 27 June 2010, to be towed to Hawaii for sinking, in July 2010, as part of the RIMPAC 2010 exercise. She was sunk as a target in the Pacific Ocean off Kauai, Hawaii, on 14 July 2010 by aircraft of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Patrol Squadron 4 (VP-4) and Patrol Squadron 40 (VP-40).

<doc id="903303" wikidata="Q902470" url="?curid=903303" title="Diazotroph">
<text>Diazotrophs are bacteria and archaea that fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) in the atmosphere into bioavailable forms such as ammonia.

A diazotroph is a microorganism that is able to grow without external sources of fixed nitrogen. Examples of organisms that do this are rhizobia and &quot;Frankia&quot; and &quot;Azospirillum&quot;. All diazotrophs contain iron-molybdenum or iron-vanadium nitrogenase systems. Two of the most studied systems are those of &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;Azotobacter vinelandii&quot;. These systems are studied because of their genetic tractability and their fast growth.

==Etymology==
The word diazotroph is derived from the words &quot;diazo&quot; (&quot;di&quot; = two + &quot;azo&quot; = nitrogen) meaning &quot;dinitrogen (N2)&quot; and &quot;troph&quot; meaning &quot;pertaining to food or nourishment&quot;, in summary dinitrogen utilizing. The word &quot;azote&quot; means nitrogen in French and was named by French chemist and biologist Antoine Lavoisier, who saw it as the part of air which cannot sustain life.

==Types==
Diazotrophs are scattered across Bacteria taxonomic groups (as well as a couple of Archaea). Even within a species that can fix nitrogen there may be strains that do not. Fixation is shut off when other sources of nitrogen are available, and, for many species, when oxygen is at high partial pressure. Bacteria have different ways of dealing with the debilitating effects of oxygen on nitrogenases, listed below.

===Free-living diazotrophs===
* Anaerobes—these are obligate anaerobes that cannot tolerate oxygen even if they are not fixing nitrogen. They live in habitats low in oxygen, such as soils and decaying vegetable matter. &quot;Clostridium&quot; is an example. Sulphate-reducing bacteria are important in ocean sediments (e.g. &quot;Desulfovibrio&quot;), and some Archean methanogens, like &quot;Methanococcus&quot;, fix nitrogen in muds, animal intestines and anoxic soils.
* Facultative anaerobes—these species can grow either with or without oxygen, but they only fix nitrogen anaerobically. Often, they respire oxygen as rapidly as it is supplied, keeping the amount of free oxygen low. Examples include &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Paenibacillus polymyxa&quot;, &quot;Bacillus macerans&quot;, and &quot;Escherichia intermedia&quot;.
* Aerobes—these species require oxygen to grow, yet their nitrogenase is still debilitated if exposed to oxygen. &quot;Azotobacter vinelandii&quot; is the most studied of these organisms. It uses very high respiration rates, and protective compounds, to prevent oxygen damage. Many other species also reduce the oxygen levels in this way, but with lower respiration rates and lower oxygen tolerance.
* Oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (cyanobacteria) generate oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, yet some are able to fix nitrogen as well. These are colonial bacteria that have specialized cells (heterocysts) that lack the oxygen generating steps of photosynthesis. Examples are &quot;Anabaena cylindrica&quot; and &quot;Nostoc commune&quot;. Other cyanobacteria lack heterocysts and can fix nitrogen only in low light and oxygen levels (e.g. &quot;Plectonema&quot;). Some cyanobacteria, including the highly abundant marine taxa &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; and &quot;Synechococcus&quot; do not fix nitrogen, whilst other marine cyanobacteria, such as &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; and &quot;Cyanothece&quot;, are major contributors to oceanic nitrogen fixation.
* Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria do not generate oxygen during photosynthesis, having only a single photosystem which cannot split water. Nitrogenase is expressed under nitrogen limitation. Normally, the expression is regulated via negative feedback from the produced ammonium ion but in the absence of N2, the product is not formed, and the by-product H2 continues unabated [Biohydrogen]. Example species: &quot;Rhodobacter sphaeroides&quot;, &quot;Rhodopseudomonas palustris&quot;, &quot;Rhodobacter capsulatus&quot;.

===Symbiotic diazotrophs===
* Rhizobia—these are the species that associate with legumes, plants of the family Fabaceae. Oxygen is bound to leghemoglobin in the root nodules that house the bacterial symbionts, and supplied at a rate that will not harm the nitrogenase.
* Frankias—&#x27;actinorhizal&#x27; nitrogen fixers. The bacteria also infect the roots, leading to the formation of nodules. Actinorhizal nodules consist of several lobes, each lobe has a similar structure as a lateral root. Frankia is able to colonize in the cortical tissue of nodules, where it fixes nitrogen. Actinorhizal plants and Frankias also produce haemoglobins. Their role is less well established than for rhizobia. Although at first, it appeared that they inhabit sets of unrelated plants (alders, Australian pines, California lilac, bog myrtle, bitterbrush, &quot;Dryas&quot;), revisions to the phylogeny of angiosperms show a close relatedness of these species and the legumes. These footnotes suggest the ontogeny of these replicates rather than the phylogeny. In other words, an ancient gene (from before the angiosperms and gymnosperms diverged) that is unused in most species was reawakened and reused in these species.
* Cyanobacteria—there are also symbiotic cyanobacteria. Some associate with fungi as lichens, with liverworts, with a fern, and with a cycad. These do not form nodules (indeed most of the plants do not have roots). Heterocysts exclude the oxygen, as discussed above. The fern association is important agriculturally: the water fern &quot;Azolla&quot; harbouring &quot;Anabaena&quot; is an important green manure for rice culture.
* Association with animals—although diazotrophs have been found in many animal guts, there is usually sufficient ammonia present to suppress nitrogen fixation. Termites on a low nitrogen diet allow for some fixation, but the contribution to the termite&#x27;s nitrogen supply is negligible. Shipworms may be the only species that derive significant benefit from their gut symbionts.

==Cultivation==
Under the laboratory conditions, extra nitrogen sources are not needed to grow free-living diazotrophs. Carbon sources (such as sucrose or glucose) and a small amount of inorganic salt are added to the medium. Free-living diazotrophs can directly use atmospheric nitrogen (N2). However, while cultivating several symbiotic diazotrophs, such as rhizobia, it is necessary to add nitrogen because rhizobia and other symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria can not use molecular nitrogen (N2) in free-living form and only fix nitrogen during symbiosis with a host plant.

==Application==
===Biofertilizer===

Diazotroph fertilizer is a kind of biofertilizer that can use nitrogen-fixing microorganisms to convert molecular nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (which is the formation of nitrogen available for the crops to use). These nitrogen nutrients then can be used in the process of protein synthesis for the plants. This whole process of nitrogen fixation by diazotroph is called biological nitrogen fixation. This biochemical reaction can be carried out under normal temperature and pressure conditions. So it does not require extreme conditions and specific catalysts in fertilizer production. Therefore, produce available nitrogen in this way can be cheap, clean and efficient. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria fertilizer is an ideal and promising biofertilizer.

From the ancient time, people grow the leguminous crops to make the soil more fertile. And the reason for this is: the root of leguminous crops are symbiotic with the rhizobia (a kind of diazotroph). These rhizobia can be considered as a natural biofertilizer to provide available nitrogen in the soil. After harvesting the leguminous crops, and then grow other crops (may not be leguminous), they can also use these nitrogen remain in the soil and grow better.

Diazotroph biofertilizers used today include Rhizobium, Azotobacter, Azospirilium and Blue green algae (a genus of cyanobacteria). These fertilizer are widely used and commenced into industrial production. So far in the market, nitrogen fixation biofertilizer can be divided into liquid fertilizer and solid fertilizer. Most of the fertilizers are fermented in the way of liquid fermentation. After fermentation, the liquid bacteria can be packaged, which is the liquid fertilizer, and the fermented liquid can also be adsorbed with sterilized peat and other carrier adsorbents to form a solid microbial fertilizer. These nitrogen-fixation fertilizer has a certain effect on increasing the production of cotton, rice, wheat, peanuts, rape, corn, sorghum, potatoes, tobacco, sugarcane and various vegetables.

==Importance==
In organisms the symbiotic associations greatly exceed the free-living species, with the exception of cyanobacteria.

Biologically available nitrogen such as ammonia is the primary limiting factor for life on earth. Diazotroph plays an important roles in nitrogen cycle of the earth. In the terrestrial ecosystem, the diazotroph fix the (N2) from the atmosphere and provide the available nitrogen for the primary producer. Then the nitrogen is transferred to higher trophical levels and human beings. The formation and storage of nitrogen will all influenced by the transformation process. Also the available nitrogen fixed by the diazotroph is environmentally sustainable, which can reduce the use of fertilizer, which can be an important topic in agricultural research. 

In marine ecosystem, prokaryotic phytoplankton (such as cyanobacteria) is the main nitrogen fixer, then the nitrogen consumed by higher trophical levels. The fixed N released from these organisms is a component of ecosystem N inputs. And also the fixed N is important for the coupled C cycle. A greater oceanic inventory of fixed N may increase the primary production and export of organic C to the deep ocean.

<text>U.S. Route 278 (US 278) is a parallel route of US 78. It currently runs for from Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, to Wickes, Arkansas at US 71/US 59, passing through five states in the process. Landmarks along its route include the Department of Energy&#x27;s Savannah River Site in South Carolina and the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in eastern Mississippi. There are several universities located along the highway including the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Mississippi, Delta State University, and the University of Arkansas at Monticello.

==Route description==

===Arkansas===

US 278 begins at an intersection with US 59/US 71 in the town of Wickes in southwestern Arkansas. From Wickes, US 278 continues eastward near Gillham Lake to an overlap with US 70 through Dierks. Continuing south, US 278 overlaps Highway 26 for at Center Point. Further south the route continues into Nashville. The route overlaps US 371 and later Highway 27 upon entering Nashville.

Entering Hempstead County, the highway winds through rural areas to Ozan and Washington, before meeting US 278 Business (US 278B) outside Hope. The highway crosses over Interstate 30 (I-30) shortly after entering the city limits and overlaps Highway 29 and Highway 32. US 278/AR 29/AR 32 intersect US 67 in east Hope. South of this junction AR 29 splits and US 278/AR 32 continues southeast. Further along this route, AR 32 turns southeast to Willisville and US 278 runs toward Camden.

The route intersects Highway 53 in rural Nevada County, overlaps US 371 in Rosston, and has a junction with Highway 57 upon entering Ouachita County. In Camden, US 278 intersects Highway 24 before it meets US 278B and US 79B prior to overlapping US 79. US 278 breaks from US 79 near Harrell Field shortly before entering East Camden. US 278 continues into Calhoun County and Hampton and a junction with US 371. The east edge of town brings an intersection with Highway 274 as US 278 continues to Harrell and Highway 160 before entering Bradley County. Aside from Banks, where US 278 has a junction with Highway 275, the route runs through rural country until Warren, where US 278 almost entirely bypasses the city to the south while US 278B runs downtown, including a brief overlap with US 63B. US 278 has an intersection with US 63/AR 8 along the southern edge of Warren before serving as the eastern terminus for US 278B. Further east the highway intersects Highway 172, which gives access to the Warren Prairie Natural Area just east of the Drew County line.

The route continues to Monticello to McGehee, where it meets US 65. US 278 overlaps US 65 southward for until they separate in Lake Village. There, US 65 splits off and US 278 overlaps US 82 east to the Mississippi River, where US 82/US 278 crosses into Mississippi.

Long-term plans are to move US 278 to the Charles W. Dean Bridge, which is part of the proposed extension of I-69.

===Mississippi===

US 82/US 278 goes through Greenville to Leland, where US 278 separates from US 82 at US 61. US 278 then joins US 61 northward through Cleveland before splitting in Clarksdale. East of Clarksdale, it overlaps Mississippi Highway 6 through Batesville, Oxford, and Pontotoc before reaching Tupelo. At Tupelo, MS 6 separates from US 278 while US 278 overlaps US 45 south to New Wren. From New Wren, US 278 continues east through Amory before entering Alabama.

===Alabama===

US 278 enters Alabama between Greenwood Springs, Mississippi, and Sulligent, Alabama. As in Georgia, this and all U.S routes are partnered with state routes; however, there are few instances throughout the state where the state route number is posted. From the Mississippi state line to Guin, US 278 is paired with State Route 118. From Hamilton to the Georgia state line, US 278 is paired with State Route 74.

US 278 junctions with US 431 at Gadsden. The two routes overlap until they split at Attalla. US 278 overlaps US 43 between Hamilton and Guin. Prior to the completion of Corridor X (Future I-22), these two routes also overlapped US 78 between these two towns; eastbound US 78 traveled in the same direction as westbound US 278.

===Georgia===
In Atlanta, US 278 runs along Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway (Bankhead Highway), North Avenue, briefly along Piedmont Road and Ponce de Leon Avenue. Outside the Perimeter, US 278 runs along Covington Highway. In Lithonia, Georgia, at the intersection with Turner Hill Road (SR 124), US 278 merges with I-20 for . It leaves I-20 at exit 90, in Covington, Georgia.

US 278 is co-signed with a state route for its entire length in Georgia, as are all U.S. Highways in the state. From the Alabama line into Lithia Springs, it is co-signed with SR 6. From Lithia Springs through Atlanta, it is merged with US 78/SR 8. In Atlanta, US 278 merges further with other highways including SR 10 and US 23 before splitting off at Ponce de Leon Ave. and East Lake Road near Decatur. In Avondale Estates, SR 12 is paired with US 278, all the way into Thomson. There, US 278 merges with US 78/SR 10 to the South Carolina line.

===South Carolina===

After crossing the Savannah River, US 278 bypasses North Augusta, South Carolina, en route to Beech Island and Johnson Crossroads. It then winds through a corner of the Savannah River Site. The route then continues onward through the towns of Allendale, Fairfax, Hampton, Varnville, Ridgeland, and Hardeeville where it meets I-95. US 278 shares the route between Ridgeland and Hardeeville with US 17.

Upon reaching Hardeeville, the route heads eastward toward the Atlantic with major new developments lining the spine of the road from Hardeeville through Sun City and Bluffton before crossing over the bridge to Hilton Head Island. US 278 ends at US 278 Business on the southern portion of Hilton Head Island, just outside Sea Pines Plantation.

==History==
In 1954, US 278 was extended from Guin, Alabama, to Augusta, Georgia. The extension was routed along US 43 from Guin to Hamilton, Alabama, then over SR 74 to the Georgia state line. In Georgia, US 278 was routed over SR 6 to Atlanta and SR 12 to Augusta. A further extension from Augusta to Jacksonboro, South Carolina, in 1955 was denied by AASHO in 1955.

In 1989, US 278 was rerouted through Dallas, Georgia; the former route through town was redesignated US 278 Byp. AASHTO approved another relocation through Rockmart, Georgia, in 1990; the former route through town became US 278 Bus. A third relocation the following year in Cedartown, Georgia, was also approved.

Alabama rerouted a section of US 278 in Guin over a section of SR 118 in 1995. At the same time, South Carolina rerouted the highway in Ridgeland over US 17 and SC 88.

Mississippi and Arkansas extended US 278 westward in 1997 from US 45 in Nettleton, Mississippi, to US 71 in Wickes, Arkansas. The following year, the highway was relocated on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina; the former routing because US 278 Bus.

Alabama relocated US 278 in Gadsden in 2000. Until early 2005, US 278 was only signed in Mississippi from the Alabama state line to US 45 west of Amory. US 278 in western Alabama was formerly routed through Haleyville via current SR 195 and SR 129. In 2014, Alabama relocated US 278 in Cullman.

<text>U.S. Route 378 (US 378) is a spur of US 78 in the U.S. states of Georgia and South Carolina. The U.S. Highway runs from US 78, Georgia State Route 10 (SR 10), SR 17, and SR 47 in Washington, Georgia, east to US 501 Business in Conway, South Carolina. US 378 connects the Central Savannah River Area in both states with the Midlands and Pee Dee regions of South Carolina. The U.S. Highway&#x27;s western portion, which connects Washington and Lincolnton in Georgia and McCormick, Saluda, and Lexington in South Carolina, is mainly a rural highway. US 378 is a major suburban and urban highway through Lexington and South Carolina&#x27;s state capital, Columbia. The highway has a lengthy concurrency with US 76 between Columbia and Sumter and serves as a major route between the Midlands and the Myrtle Beach area, between which the highway has a business route through Lake City.

US 378 has a length of in Georgia and spans in South Carolina. The U.S. Highway is a part of the National Highway System from US 178 in Saluda east to US 501 and US 701 in Conway.

===Georgia===

US 378 begins at an intersection on the eastern edge of the city of Washington with US  78, SR 10, and SR 17, which form the north–south axis of the junction, and US 78 Business, SR 47, SR 10 Business, and SR 17 Business, which heads west on Robert Toombs Avenue toward downtown Washington. US 378 and SR 47 head east on Lincolnton Road, also known as Joe Wheeler Highway, which starts as a four-lane divided highway but becomes two lanes a short distance east of the intersection. Shortly after the Wilkes–Lincoln county line, the highways, now part of Washington Highway, meet the western end of SR 220, a C-shaped route through southern Lincoln County. US 378 and SR 47 gradually curve north and enter the city of Lincolnton as Washington Street. SR 47 splits east from the U.S. Highway and SR 43 begins to run concurrently with US 378 at their intersection with Elm Street. The highways pass along the west side of downtown Lincolnton and curve northeast, meeting the southern end of SR 79 (Goshen Street) before leaving the city.

US 378 and SR 43 continue northeast on McCormick Highway, which meets the northern end of SR 43 Connector (Old Petersburg Road) a short distance east of the city limits at Wright&#x27;s Crossing. The highways cross the Soap Creek branch of the Savannah River reservoir known as Clarks Hill Lake in Georgia and Lake Strom Thurmond in South Carolina.

===South Carolina===
====State line to Saluda====
US 378 and SR 43 meet the eastern end of SR 220 just west of Elijah Clark State Park. SR 43 reaches its northern terminus at the state line at the thalweg of the Savannah River in the center of the lake crossing. US 378 enters Sumter National Forest and crosses the Little River branch of the lake, on the east side of which is Baker Creek State Park. The highway continues to the town of McCormick, through which the highway follows Gold Street. US 378 intersects SC 28 (Mine Street) on the west side of downtown; US 221 leaves its concurrency with SC 28 coming from Augusta and joins US 378 through the downtown area. The U.S. Highways have a grade crossing of CSX&#x27;s McCormick Subdivision and diverge on the east side of town, with US 221 heading northeast as Greenwood Highway.

US 378 leaves McCormick, passes McCormick County Airport, and forms the southern boundary of Sumter National Forest east of the town. East of Liberty Hill, where the highway fully enters the national forest, the road crosses the McCormick–Edgefield county line. US 378 again forms the southern boundary of Sumter National Forest from its intersection with SC 67 (Callison Highway). The highway also intersects US 25 and SC 430 (Meeting Street Road) while passing along the northern tier of Edgefield County. US 378 leaves the national forest shortly after entering Saluda County. The highway enters the town of Saluda along Church Street and intersects Main Street, which carries US 178, SC 39, and SC 121. Two blocks to the east, US 378 turns north onto Jennings Street, then turns east on Travis Avenue at its junction with SC 194, which heads north on Jennings Street, and US 178 Connector, which heads west on Travis Avenue to connect with US 178.

====Saluda to Sumter====
US 378 crosses the Little Saluda River and leaves Saluda along Columbia Highway. After crossing Clouds Creek, the highway meets SC 391 (Prosperity Highway/Summerland Highway) at a roundabout and enters Lexington County. East of the Hollow Creek and Horse Creek branches of Lake Murray, US 378 expands to a four-lane road with center turn lane. The highway becomes concurrent with US 1 (Main Street) on the western edge of the town of Lexington. After US 1 splits southeast to head to the center of town, US 378 continues on Columbia Avenue, then has a brief concurrency with SC 6 along Lake Drive. The U.S. Highway exits the town along Sunset Boulevard. US 378 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-20 and a single-point urban interchange with I-26 before entering the city of West Columbia. The highway meets the northern ends of SC 35 (12th Street) and SC 12 Connector (9th Street), which provides access to westbound SC 12. East of the connector route, US 378 becomes a four-lane undivided highway. The highway has a partial interchange with SC 12 (Jarvis Klapman Boulevard) that only allows access to and from Columbia.

US 378 meets US 1 (Meeting Street) and the northern end of SC 2 (State Street) just before the two U.S. Highways cross the Congaree River on the four-lane Gervais Street Bridge into Richland County and the city of Columbia. The highways follow four-lane divided Gervais Street past EdVenture and the South Carolina State Museum and intersect Huger Street, which carries US 21, US 176, and US 321. US 378 and US 1 cross over Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s W Line and pass through the Congaree Vista neighborhood. At the intersection with SC 48 (Assembly Street), the highways pass between the South Carolina State House and Capitol Center. US 378 begins its long concurrency with US 76 when the latter highway turns onto Gervais Street from Bull Street. The three U.S. Highways cross over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Columbia District rail line before reaching Millwood Avenue, where US 1 turns north and US 378 and US 76 turn south. Gervais Street continues east as an unnumbered street several blocks through a residential area before reaching its eastern terminus.

US 378 and US 76 follow Millwood Avenue, a four-lane street with center turn lane, southeast to an oblique intersection with Devine Street. Devine Street carries US 21 Connector and US 76 Connector west through Five Points and the University of South Carolina campus. The U.S. Highways continue east along Devine Street to their intersection with SC 16 (Beltline Boulevard), where the road expands to six lanes. A short distance to the east, US 378 and US 76 have an intersection with SC 760 (Fort Jackson Boulevard), which heads east toward the namesake military installation, and a second US 76 Connector that follows Cross Hill Road north to SC 16. East of their intersection with a third US 76 Connector, which heads east on Wildcat Road and west on Rosewood Drive, the U.S. Highways continue as Garners Ferry Road. US 378 and US 76 meet the western end of SC 262 (Leesburg Road) just west of the U.S. Highways&#x27; and state highway&#x27;s partial cloverleaf interchanges with I-77 (Veterans Memorial Freeway). Southeast of I-77, the road becomes a four-lane divided highway, leaves the city of Columbia, and meet the northern end of SC 768 (Pineview Road). US 378 and US 76 enter a rural area and pass through Horrell Hill, where they meet the northern end of SC 769 (Congaree Road), pass McEntire Joint National Guard Base, and have a junction with the western end of SC 764 (Old Eastover Road). The U.S. Highways have a diamond interchange with US 601 (McCords Ferry Road) and an intersection with SC 263 (Vanbloken Road) north of Eastover before they cross the Wateree River into Sumter County.

====Sumter to Conway====
East of the extensive swamp surrounding the Wateree River, US 378 and US 76 pass south of the village of Stateburg and intersect SC 261 (Kings Highway). East of SC 441, Peach Orchard Road/Patriot Parkway), the U.S. Highways enter the city of Sumter, through the western portion of which they follow Broad Street. US 378 and US 76 have a trumpet interchange with Shaw Drive, the main access to Shaw Air Force Base, and follow the southern boundary of the military reservation. East of the base, the highways pass through a commercial area and meet the northern end of SC 120 (Alice Drive) just west of where Broad Street continues along US 76 Business while the U.S. Highways continue along the Robert E. Graham Freeway. Just east of the business route, US 378 and US 76 have a half-diamond interchange with US 521 (Camden Highway) allowing access with US 521 to and from the east; the other movements are made via US 76 Business and Jefferson Road. A pair of frontage roads parallels the freeway; the U.S. Highways have right-in/right-out interchanges with the frontage roads just west of the overpass of US 15 (Main Street). The frontage roads end at the freeway&#x27;s diamond interchange with US 401. US 378 and US 76 cross a rail spur before highways exit the city of Sumter and the frontage roads reappear along the freeway. The U.S. Highways diverge at their partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern end of US 76 Business (Liberty Street); US 76 heads east as Florence Highway while US 378 continues southeast along the freeway to East Sumter, where it ends at the eastern terminus of SC 763 (Myrtle Beach Highway).

US 378 continues east as Myrtle Beach Highway, a four-lane divided highway. The highway crosses the Black River and intersects SC 527 (Brick Church Road) at McBrides Corner. US 378 has an acute junction with SC 53 (Narrow Paved Road) and a diamond interchange with I-95 before entering Clarendon County, where the route follows Clarence Coker Highway. The highway becomes undivided as it enters the town of Turbeville. US 378 runs concurrently with US 301 along four-lane undivided Main Street, which intersects SC 58 (Gamble Street) one block north of the US 378–US 301 junction. The two U.S. Highways split near the northern end of town, with US 378 continuing east as a four-lane road with center turn lane. The highway enters Florence County, where its name changes to Turbeville Highway, then returns to the county line and runs atop the southern boundary of Florence County. During this stretch, the county to the south of the highway becomes Williamsburg County. Soon after US 378 fully enters Florence County, the highway intersects SC 341 (Olanta Highway). The two highways briefly run together before SC 341 continues straight concurrent with US 378 Business on Lake City&#x27;s Main Street while US 378 splits northeast to bypass Lake City. North of the town, the U.S. Highway has a diamond interchange with US 52 (Ron McNair Boulevard). US 378 crosses over CSX&#x27;s Charleston Subdivision before collecting the eastern end of US 378 Business (Myrtle Beach Highway).

The U.S. Highway meets the southern end of SC 908 south of Brittons Neck before it curves east and crosses the Little Pee Dee River into Horry County. US 378 expands to a four-lane road with center turn lane shortly after passing Conway-Horry County Airport and enters the city of Conway as Wright Boulevard. West of downtown, the U.S. Highway has an oblique intersection with Church Street, which carries US 501 through the intersection and US 701 north of the intersection. Southbound US 701 continues south on Church Street to a ramp to 4th Avenue while northbound US 701 runs concurrently with US 378 from 4th Avenue, which heads west as US 701 toward Georgetown and east as SC 905.

==History==

In the early part of the 21st century, the bridge crossing the Georgia–South Carolina state line over the Savannah River was deemed to be &quot;structurally deficient&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t until 2014 that Alabama-based Scott Bridge Company began construction on a replacement for the bridge. It wasn&#x27;t determined that the bridge was in danger of collapse; rather, the term was used in reference to a possible crack or split in the concrete of the bridge. Construction began in April 2010. However, in 2012, construction was halted due to a &quot;rare chemical reaction&quot;, known as delayed ettringite. This condition caused the support columns of the bridge to swell up and begin splitting. It was the first time this condition was ever encountered in Georgia. It was discovered after personnel from GDOT, Scott Bridge Company, and scientists from the Georgia Institute of Technology conducted a thorough examination of the bridge and supporting structure. In Spring 2014, construction resumed, using a new method in which water cools freshly-poured concrete while it cures. The $36.2 million bridge opened on December 21, 2016.

=== South Carolina Highway 54 ===

South Carolina Highway 54 (SC 54) was a state highway that was established around 1926 from SC 3 (now US 76 Business) in Sumter east to SC 4 (now US 301) in Turbeville. In 1929, it was extended to the east to end at SC 341 in Lake City. In 1939, SC 54, along with US 52 and SC 341, was extended farther into Lake City. Then, SC 54 was extended to SC 51 in Salem. Between 1943 and 1947, its path just west of the Lynches River was straightened out. In late 1951, it was decommissioned; most of its path was redesignated as part of US 378.

==Major intersections==

























==Special routes==
===Sumter business loop===

U.S. Route 378 Business (US 378 Bus.) was a business route of US 378 that existed in Sumter. It used Broad Street, Liberty Street, and Myrtle Beach Boulevard. It was established in 1958 as a renumbering of mainline US 378 through downtown Sumter.

===Lake City business loop===

U.S. Route 378 Business (US 378 Bus.) is a business route of US 378 through Lake City. The highway travels from US 378 and South Carolina Highway 341 (SC 341) west of the city to US 378 east of the city. US 378 Bus. begins heading east from US 378 (Turbeville Highway) concurrent with SC 341 along two-lane Main Street. The two highways enter the city just east of Lake City Memorial Park. In the center of the city, US 378 Bus. and SC 341 have an intersection with US 52 (Ron McNair Boulevard). One block after their grade crossing of CSX&#x27;s Charleston Subdivision, the highways diverge. The main highway continues east on Main Street while the business route turns north onto Church Street. US 378 Bus. leaves the city limits at its crossing of Lake Swamp and reaches its eastern terminus at US 378 (Myrtle Beach Highway).

===Conway truck route===

U.S. Route 378 Truck (US 378 Truck) is a truck route of US 378 that partially exists in Conway and Red Hill. It directs truck traffic onto US 501, South Carolina Highway 544 Connector (Red Hill 1) (SC 544 Conn.), US 501 Business (US 501 Bus.), SC 90, Old Reaves Ferry Road, and SC 905. Its entire length is concurrent with US 701 Truck. It is loosely signed, frequently in Conway and Red Hill, and infrequently outside the city limits of both locales.

<text>The Toyota A Series engines are a family of inline-four internal combustion engines with displacement from 1.3 L to 1.8 L produced by Toyota Motor Corporation. The series has cast iron engine blocks and aluminum cylinder heads. To make the engine as short as possible, the cylinders are siamesed.

The development of the series began in the late 1970s, when Toyota wanted to develop a completely new engine for the Toyota Tercel, the successor of Toyota&#x27;s K engine. The goal was to achieve good fuel efficiency and performance as well as low emissions with a modern design. The A-series includes one of the first Japanese mass-production DOHC, four-valve-per-cylinder engines, the 4A-GE, and a later version of the same engine was one of the first production five-valve-per-cylinder engines.

Toyota joint venture partner Tianjin FAW Xiali produces the 1.3 L 8A and resumed production of the 5A in 2007.


==1A==
The 1.5 L 1A was produced between 1978 and 1980. All variants were belt-driven 8-valve counter-flow SOHC engines with a single, twin-barrel downdraft carburetor. It used Toyota&#x27;s Turbulence Generating Pot (TGP) lean combustion system to meet Japanese emissions standards at the time with only an oxidation (2-way) catalyst. The 1A engine was only long.

===1A-C===
Applications:
* AL10 Tercel

===1A-U===
Using Toyota two-way catalyst.

Output:
* at 5,600 rpm and at 3,600 rpm (compression at 9.0:1)

Applications:
* AL10 Tercel/Corsa (Japan only)

==2A==
The 1.3 L 2A was produced from 1979 through 1989. 2A engines in 1982 onwards AL20 Tercels have a slightly different valve cover and timing belt cover than early AL11 Tercels, as well as an automatic choke, and automatically controlled hot air intake (HAI) system. It also has higher compression ratio, and reformulated combustion chambers to improve the fuel economy and emissions. All variants used belt-driven SOHC eight-valve counter-flow cylinder heads with a single downdraft carburetor.

==3A==
The 1.5 L 3A was produced from 1979 through 1989. The 3A engine is the successor of Toyota&#x27;s first A engine, the 1A. All variants were belt-driven eight-valve counter-flow SOHC engines but no longer used Toyota&#x27;s &quot;Turbulence Generating Pot&quot; pre-combustion system from the 1A.

===3A-SU===
Twin carburetted swirl-intake version with Toyota TTC-C catalytic converter, introduced in August 1984 along with a facelift for the Tercel (and its sister variants) in Japan. Features two variable-venturi carburetors, which Toyota wanted to test in Japan before launching them in export along E series engine, albeit in single carburetted version. Because of the swirl-intake, the sealing surface between cylinder head and valve cover is different from other SOHC A-engines, featuring vertical curves on the manifold side of the head. Thus, those parts are not interchangeable between each other. The swirl was supposed to improve burning of the air-fuel mixture, thus enabling cleaner emissions, improving fuel economy, and increasing power.

Output:
* at 6,000 rpm (compression at 9.3:1)

Applications:
* AL21 Corolla II 1984–1986 (Japan only)
* AL21/25 Corsa 1984–1989 (Japan only)
* AL25 Sprinter Carib 1984–1988 (Japan only)
* AL21/25 Tercel 1984–1989 (Japan only)

==4A==
The 4A was produced from 1980 through 2002. All 4A engines have a displacement of . The cylinder bore was enlarged from the previous 3A engines at , but the stroke remained the same as the 3A at , giving it an over-square bore/stroke ratio which favours high engine speeds.

Numerous variations of the 4A design were produced, from basic SOHC 8-valve all the way to DOHC 20-valve versions. The power output also varied greatly between versions, from at 4,800 rpm in the basic California-spec 4A-C to at 6,400 rpm in the supercharged 4A-GZE.

===4A, 4A-C, 4A-L, 4A-LC===

The basic 4A is a SOHC 8 valve carburated engine which produces at 4800 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm, though the power and torque output figures vary between different regions of the world. in European versions, the combustion chambers were reformulated in early 1986, resulting in an increase of 2 hp, up to at 5600 rpm, along with improvements in fuel economy and emissions.

North American market engines:
* 4A-LC 1.6 L I4, 8-valve SOHC, at 4800 rpm

* 4A-C 1.6 L I4, 8-valve SOHC, at 5200 rpm

European (and other) market engines: (excepting Sweden and Switzerland)
* 4A-L 1.6 L, I4, 8-valve SOHC, at 5600 rpm, and torque at 4000 rpm (compression at 9.0:1) (Indonesia)
* 4A-L 1.6 L, I4, 8-valve SOHC, at 5600 rpm, and torque at 3600 rpm (compression at 9.3:1) (Europe)

===4A-F===
A narrow-valve (22.3°) DOHC 16-valve carburetor-equipped version, the 4A-F, was produced from 1987 through 1990. Output was at 6,000 rpm and at 3,600 rpm (compression at 9.5:1, EU spec). This engine featured an aluminum-alloy cylinder head with scissor-gear driven twin overhead camshafts, centered spark plugs, and employed pent-roof combustion chambers which were designed to improve thermal efficiency. It also featured a fully counterweighted crankshaft with five journals and eight balance weights. This engine was the first of the A series engines to utilize Toyota&#x27;s &quot;High-Mecha Twin Cam&quot; system, where both camshafts are geared together with the intake camshaft being driven off of the exhaust camshaft via scissor gears. The 4A-F was designed to provide more powerful torque in the low-to-mid RPM range as well improve top-end power output.


Applications:
* AT171 Carina II 1987–1992 (Europe only)
* AE92/95 Corolla 1987–1992 (excluding Japan)

===4A-FE===


The fuel injected 4A-FE is the successor of the carbureted 4A-F, manufactured from 1987–2001. Toyota designed this engine with fuel economy in mind. The 4A-FE is basically the same as the 4A-F (introduced in the sixth generation of Corollas), the most apparent difference being the electronic fuel injection system as noted by the &#x27;E&#x27;. The engine was succeeded by the 3ZZ-FE, a 1.6-liter engine with VVT-i technology.

There are three generations of this engine, which can be identified by the external shape of the engine. The first generation (1987–1996) featured a plate on the head which read &quot;16 valve EFI&quot; and fuel injectors in the head.

The second generation had a higher profile cam design in the head, a cam cover with ribs throughout its length, and fuel injectors in the intake manifold runners. Mechanically, the late-model engines received MAP load sensing and redesigned pistons, intake ports, and intake manifold. The second generation engine was produced from 1992–1998 (1993–1996 in the US).

The third generation (1996–2001) was released exclusively for the Asian market (Japan, Philippines, Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia) only. Although it is very similar to the second generation externally, it only has a slight difference in the top section of the intake manifold and throttle body. This last generation also has a higher additional output of compared to the second generation.

&quot;Note: power and torque specs for North America and Europe are from the 1988–1992 Corollas.&quot; 

The 4A-FE is different from the 4A-GE in terms of performance and power. Although both have the same displacement and are DOHC, they were optimized for different uses. The first obvious difference are the valves, the engine&#x27;s intake and exhaust valves were placed 22.3° apart (compared to 50° in the G-Engines). The second is that it employed Toyota&#x27;s &quot;High-Mecha Twin Cam&quot; system, where both camshafts are geared together with the intake camshaft being driven off of the exhaust camshaft via scissor gears (both camshafts on the G-Engine are rotated by the timing belt instead). Some of the less directly visible differences were poorly shaped ports in the earlier versions, a slow burning combustion chamber with heavily shrouded valves, less aggressive camshaft profiles, a cast crankshaft (rather than a forged crankshaft in the 4A-GE), ports of a small cross sectional area, a very restrictive intake manifold with long runners joined to a small displacement plenum and other changes. Even though the valve angle is closer to what is considered in some racing circles to be ideal for power (approximately 25 degrees), its other design differences and the intake which is tuned for a primary harmonic resonance at low RPM means that it has about 10% less power compared to the 4A-GE engine. This engine design improves fuel efficiency and torque, but compromises power. Power ratings varied from in the US market.

===4A-GE (16-valve)===


The 4A-GE was a series of high-performance four-cylinder twincam engines made by Toyota in collaboration with Yamaha Motor Corporation. The cylinder head was developed by Yamaha and was built at Toyota&#x27;s Shimoyama plant alongside the 4A and 2A engines. The reliability and performance of these engines has earned them a fair number of enthusiasts and a fan base as they are a popular choice for an engine swap into other Toyota cars such as the KE70 and KP61. New performance parts are still available for sale even today because of its strong fan base. Production of the various models of this version lasted for five generations, from May 1983 through 1991 for the 16-valve versions and up to 2000 for the 20-valve 4A-GE versions.

==== First Generation &quot;Blue Top&quot; (Early Bigport) ====
The first-generation 4A-GE which was introduced in May 1983 replaced the &quot;2T-G&quot; as Toyota&#x27;s most popular twincam engine. This engine was identifiable via silver cam covers with the lettering on the upper cover painted black and blue, as well as the presence of three reinforcement ribs on the back side of the block. It was extremely light and strong for a production engine using an all-iron block, weighing in at only - over fifteen percent reduction compared to 2T-GEU. It was also 4 dB quieter. While originally conceived of as a two-valve design, Toyota and Yamaha changed the 4A-GE to a four-valve after a year of evaluation.

The 4A-GE produced at 6,600 rpm and of torque at 4,800 rpm in the American market. The use of a vane-type air flow meter (AFM), which restricted air flow slightly but produced cleaner emissions that conformed to the U.S. regulations, limited the power considerably - the Japanese model, which uses a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor, was originally rated at . However, this was a gross power rating and the engine was later re-rated at in net output. Nonetheless, Japanese cars tested no faster than their American counterparts despite their higher power rating and a lower curb weight.

Yamaha designed the engine for performance; the valve angle was a relatively wide 50 degrees, which at the time was believed to be ideal for high power production. Today, many modern high-revving engines have decreased the valve angle to 20 to 25 degrees, allowing for a more smaller and compact cylinder head and is now believed to be ideal for high-revving engines with high specific power outputs. Despite this, most high-performance racing engines still employ wide valve angles which allow for straighter ports and more efficient air flow.

The first-generation 4A-GE is nicknamed the &quot;bigport&quot; engine because it had intake ports of a very large cross-sectional area. While the port cross-section was suitable for a very highly modified engine at very high engine speeds, it caused a considerable drop in low-end torque due to the decreased air speeds at those rpm. To compensate for the reduced air speed, the first-generation engines included the T-VIS feature, in which dual intake runners are fitted with butterfly valves that opened at approximately 4,200 rpm. The effect is that at lower rpm (when the airspeed would normally be slow) four of the eight runners are closed, which forces the engine to draw in all its air through half the runners in the manifold. This not only raises the airspeed which causes better cylinder filling, but due to the asymmetrical airflow a swirl is created in the combustion chamber, meaning better fuel atomization. This enabled the torque curve to still be intact at lower engine speeds, allowing for better performance across the entire speed band and a broad, flat torque curve around the crossover point. During rising engine speed, a slight lurch can occur at the crossover point and an experienced driver will be able to detect the shift in performance. Production of the first-generation engine model lasted until May 1987.

==== Second Generation &quot;Red &amp; Black Top&quot; (Late Bigport) ====
The second-generation 4A-GE produced from June 1987 to May 1989 featured larger diameter bearings for the connecting-rod big ends and added four additional reinforcement ribs on the back of the engine block, for a total of seven. The T-VIS feature is retained, as well as the MAP sensor (MAF sensor in the US-market). It is visually similar to the first-generation engine (only the upper cam cover now featured red and black lettering) and the US-market power output was only increased to . The first- and second-generation engines are very popular with racers and tuners because of their availability, ease of modification, simple design, and lightness.

==== Third Generation &quot;Red Top&quot; (Smallport) ====
The third-generation appeared in June 1989 and was in production until June 1991. This engine has the silver cam covers with the words only written in red, hence the nickname &quot;red top&quot;. Toyota increased the compression ratio from 9.4:1 to 10.3:1. To correct the air-speed problems of the earlier generations, the intake ports in this cylinder head were re-designed to have a smaller cross-section, and hence it has been nicknamed the &quot;smallport&quot; head. This change in the intake ports negated the need for the earlier twin-runner intake manifold and it was replaced with a single-runner manifold. Additional engine modifications to extend life and reliability included under-piston cooling oil squirters, thicker connecting rods and other components. Also of note, the pistons were changed to utilize a fully floating gudgeon pin unlike the pressed-in pins of the earlier versions. Other internal revisions were made to the pistons. They were slightly modified to make space for the under-piston cooling oil squirters found in this engine version. In addition to this, the piston ring size were changed to (top ring), 1.5mm (second ring) and (oil ring), this change in size made it difficult to obtain as compared to the earlier 16 valves versions of the 4A-GE (top ring), (second ring), (oil ring). All non-US market 4A-GEs continued to use a MAP sensor, while all of the US-market 4A-GE engines came with a MAF sensor. For US-market cars, this revision increased the power to at 7200 rpm with a torque of at 4800 rpm. In non-US market cars, this revision produced at 7200 rpm and torque at at 4800 rpm.

The 4A-GE engine was first introduced in the 1983 Sprinter Trueno AE86 and the Corolla Levin AE86. The AE86 marked the end of the 4A-GE as a rear wheel drive (RWD or FR) mounted engine. Alongside the RWD AE86/AE85 coupes, a front wheel drive (FWD or FF) Corolla was produced and all future Corollas/Sprinters were based around the FF layout. The AW11 MR2 continued use of the engine as a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, transversely-mounted midship. The engine was retired from North American Corollas in 1991, although it continued to be available in the Geo Prizm GSi (sold through Chevrolet dealerships) from 1990 to 1992. All 4A-GE engines (including the 20-valve versions below) feature a forged crankshaft rather than a cheaper and more commonly used cast version.

Clarification: In the U.S. market, the 4A-GE engine was first used in the 1985 model year Corolla GT-S only, which is identified as an &quot;AE88&quot; in the VIN but uses the AE86 chassis code on the firewall as the AE88 is a &quot;sub&quot; version of the AE86. The 4A-GE engines for the 1985 model year are referred to as &quot;blue top&quot; as opposed to the later &quot;red top&quot; engines, because the paint color on the valve covers is different, to show the different engine revision, using different port sizes, different airflow metering, and other minor differences on the engine.

The American Spec AE86 (VIN AE88, or GT-S) carried the 4A-GE engine. In other markets, other designations were used. Much confusion exists, even among dealers, as to which models contained what equipment, especially since Toyota split the Corolla line into both RWD and FWD versions, and the GT-S designation was only well known as a Celica version at that time.

===4A-GE (20-valve)===
====Fourth Generation &quot;Silver Top&quot;====
The fourth-generation 4A-GE engine was produced from 1991 to 1995. It has silver cam covers with chrome lettering, hence the nickname &quot;silver top&quot;. This engine yet again features a completely new cylinder head which uses five valves per cylinder instead of four. It uses Toyota&#x27;s Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system on the intake cam, an increased compression ratio (10.5:1), and the intake system was replaced with a short manifold with individual throttles and velocity stacks, however the vane-type airflow meter was retained, requiring the use of a plenum. The previous 16-valve head used a sharply curved intake port, while the 20-valve engine used a very upright straight port. This engine produces at 7,400 rpm with of torque at 5,200 rpm.

In South Africa, the 7A-FE engine was used in place of the 20-valve 4A-GE engine in 1993 despite other countries (except North America) moving towards the new engine, as South African fuel was not suitable at the time for the 20-valve 4A-GE engines. The 20-valve 4A-GE engine would eventually arrive in the Corolla RXi and RSi in the &quot;black top&quot; revision in 1997.

====Fifth Generation &quot;Black Top&quot;====
The fifth-generation 4A-GE engine produced from 1995 to 2000 is the final version of the 4A-GE engine and has black cam covers. It uses Toyota Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system on the intake cam. This engine is commonly known as the &quot;black top&quot; due to the color of the valve cover, and yet again features an even higher compression ratio (11:1). The air flow sensor was replaced by a MAP sensor, the diameter of the four individual throttle bodies was increased from , the exhaust ports diameter were increased by 3 mm, the intake cam lift was increased from , and the intake ports were significantly improved in shape and contour, with the width of the opening at the head increased as well. Additionally, the black top had a lighter flywheel, a larger plenum, lighter connecting rods and revised rubber velocity stacks, and was also offered in 1997 with a six-speed C160 transaxle. This revision increased the power to at 7,800 rpm with of torque at 5,600 rpm. The &#x27;Blacktop&#x27; has become a favorite among enthusiasts and is used as an easy power upgrade for the early Toyota Corolla models, especially for use in the drift scene. Due to the relatively high state of tuning of the stock engine, most power/torque gains come from higher lift cams and engine management. 

It has been believed that Toyota&#x27;s power figures for the 20-valve engines are inflated; this statement was more than likely caused by people using less than 100 RON fuel (Japanese premium fuel standard) that both 20-valve engines require.

===4A-GZE===
The 4A-GZE was a supercharged version of the 4A-GE produced in various forms from August 1986 through 1995. All three generations shared forged and ceramic coated pistons, a SC12 Roots type supercharger, and a stronger 7-rib block and crankshaft, similar to the 1987–1989 &quot;Late Bigport&quot; second-generation 4A-GE.

The 4A-GZE is popular for turbo conversions, as many parts do not need to be modified to support the extra boost.

====First Generation====
The first-generation 4A-GZE produced peak manifold pressure. It used dished, forged and coated pistons with an 8.0:1 compression ratio. Compared to the 4A-GE, the main differences for the long block were casting holes for a knock sensor and coolant bypass pipes, lower duration cam timing (232º), the upgraded pistons, different valve covers, and the omission of T-VIS. The first-generation 4A-GZE was rated at at 6400 rpm and at 4400 rpm.

The 4A-GZE was first used in the 1986 supercharged Toyota MR2 AW11 until May 1989. It was also used in the 1987–1989 Toyota Corolla AE92 and Sprinter AE92 (Japan-only). Despite having the same specifications, the MR2 was equipped with a distributor and a single ignition coil while the Corolla and Sprinter was equipped with a distributor-less design and twin coil packs.

Applications:
* AW11 MR2 1986–1989 (Japan, 1988–1989 North America)
* AE92 Corolla 1987–1989 (Japan only)
* AE92 Sprinter 1987–1989 (Japan only)

====Second Generation====
In late 1989, the 4A-GZE was updated with an 8.9:1 compression, and MAP D-Jetronic load sensing and a smaller supercharger pulley producing . These updated 4A-GZE engines were rated at and . It can be denoted by a gray cover on the top-mounted intercooler with an emblem reading &quot;Twin Cam 16 Supercharger&quot;. While this cover was also used on early AE92s with the first-generation 4A-GZE, the lack of AFM and its subsequent replacement with MAP in the later AE92s makes this generation easily recognizable.

Applications:
* AE92 Corolla 1989–1991 (Japan only)
* AE92 Sprinter 1989–1991 (Japan only)

====Third Generation====
In mid 1991, the 4A-GZE was further upgraded with the &quot;smallport&quot; cylinder head and the block was equipped with piston skirt oil jets for cooling. These minimal updates further increased output to and . It can be denoted by a black cover on the top-mounted intercooler with an emblem featuring Toyota&#x27;s then-new logo followed by the word &quot;Supercharger&quot;. While its naturally aspirated counterpart (4A-GE) used five valves per cylinder for a total of 20 valves in its redesigned cylinder head during this timeframe, the 4A-GZE&#x27;s cylinder head remained unchanged and continued to use four valves per cylinder for a total of 16 valves.

Applications:
* AE101 Corolla 1991–1995 (Japan only)
* AE101 Sprinter 1991–1995 (Japan only)

===Racing Applications===
Due to its durability, performance and relatively low cost, 4A-GE and 4A-GZE engines and their derivatives have been popular for both professional and amateur racing since their introduction. The most notable application of the 4A-GE in racing was as in the Formula Atlantic series, where in full race trim the engine will produce at 10,000 rpm.

==5A==

The 5A was produced from 1987 through 2006. The carbureted 5A-F was produced in 1987 and the fuel injected 5A-FE was produced that year and again from 1995 through 1998. Both used a cylinder bore and stroke of and had 4 valves per cylinder with DOHC heads using the narrow-valve (22.3°) angle. It uses the same &quot;High-Mecha Twin Cam&quot; system from the 4A-F and 4A-FE.

===5A-F===
Output for the carb version was at 6000 rpm and at 3600 rpm.

Applications:
* AT170 Carina 1988–1990 (Japan only)
* AE91 Corolla 1987–1989 (Japan only)
* AT170 Corona 1987–1989 (Japan only)
* AE91 Sprinter 1987–1989 (Japan only)

===5A-FE===
Output for the 1987 FI version was at 6000 rpm and at 4800 rpm. A later one produced at 5600 rpm and at 4400 rpm.

Toyota joint venture partner Tianjin FAW Xiali produces the 5A-FE (dubbed 5A+) for its Vela and Weizhi (C1) subcompact sedans. This version produces at 6000 rpm and at 4400 rpm.

* AE100 Sprinter Marino 1992–1998 (Japan only)
* AXP42 Vios 2002–2006 (China only)

===5A-FHE===
Same as the first generation 5A-FE, only more aggressive tune for more output. Called an EFI-S engine.

This engine produces up to due to slightly larger throttle than the standard 5A-FE and different cam profiles. 

Applications:
* AE91 Corolla 1989–1992 (Japan only)
* AE91 Sprinter 1989–1992 (Japan only)
* AE91 Toyota G Touring 1994–1999 (Japan only)
* AE100 Toyota G Touring 1994–1999 (Japan only)

==6A==

The 6A-FC was produced from 1989 through 1992. It is the only 1.4 variant of the A-series engines. Output is and .

It is a 4-valve, narrow-valve angle DOHC engine using Toyota&#x27;s &quot;High-Mecha Twin Cam&quot; system, mainly installed in Australian and European market Corollas.

===6A-FC===
Applications:
* AE90 Corolla and Holden Nova 1989–1992 (Australia only)

==7A==
The 7A was produced from 1990 through 2002. Cylinder bore and stroke was . The largest production A-series engine was the 7A-FE, produced from 1993 through 2002. It is a 4-valve DOHC narrow-valve angle economy engine stroked out from the 4A, also reusing the 4A-FE&#x27;s &quot;High-Mecha Twin Cam&quot; concept. It is a non-interference type engine.

An early Canadian version produced at 5600 rpm and at 2800 rpm. The common (1993 to 1995 North American) version is rated at at 5600 rpm and at 2800 rpm. The engine output was changed for the 1996 to 1997 (North American) version mainly due to a different antipollution system and different intake which made it rate at at 5200 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm.

In the United States, the 7A-FE&#x27;s most common application was in the 1993–1997 Corolla (7th generation). The engine was also used in some 1994–1999 Celicas (6th generation) at the base ST trim level, as well as the Toyota Corolla&#x27;s clone, the Geo Prizm.

The Indonesian and Russian version of the 7A-FE has the strongest naturally aspirated output, with at 6000 rpm and at 4400 rpm, with 9.5 compression ratio. It appears in the eighth generation Corolla (AE112).

In the Australian market, the AE112 Corolla Sportivo had a turbocharged and intercooled 7A-FE, sometimes unofficially referred to as a 7A-FTE. Output was at 5,600 rpm, torque at 3600 rpm, thanks to an IHI RHF4B turbocharger with 0.55 bar of boost pressure. This was a conversion rather than a ground-up turbo design, with the same 9.5:1 compression ratio as the naturally aspirated 7A-FE. Only 110 Corolla Sportivos were built.

Toyota never made a wide-valve angle high-performance engine based on the 7A called the &quot;7A-GE&quot;, however many enthusiasts have created one using a combination of 7A-FE parts (block and crank), 4A-GE parts (head, pistons) and custom connecting rods. The 7A-FE has a smaller crank journal and smaller wrist pins (press fit), and so a few companies have made special rods to accommodate these builds. Likewise, an unofficial supercharged &quot;7A-GZE&quot; has also been built from 7A-FE parts (block, crank), 4A-GZE parts (head, pistons) and custom connecting rods.

==8A==
The 8A was produced from 1990 through 2006 by Tianjin FAW Xiali for its Daihatsu and Toyota-based subcompacts. It uses the same cylinder bore of as the 5A but with a reduced stroke of . It uses a four valves per cylinder DOHC head with narrow-valve angles. The &quot;High-Mecha Twin Cam&quot; system from the 4A-FE and 5A-FE was retained. Compression ratio is 9.3:1.

<text>Supagroup is an American rock and roll band from New Orleans, Louisiana. Their current lineup includes vocalist and rhythm guitarist Chris Lee, lead guitarist Benji Lee, bassist Brian &quot;Bruiser&quot; Broussard, and drummer Leon Touzet. Chris Lee is married to former White Zombie bassist Sean Yseult. In early 2003, the band won the New Orleans regional poll in The 2nd Annual Independent Music Awards for their song &quot;She&#x27;s Hot (I&#x27;m On A Roll).&quot;

==Background==
Supagroup was formed in 1996 by Chinese American brothers Chris Lee and Benji Lee from Anchorage, Alaska while students at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. 
They have headlined with Vince Neil of Mötley Crüe, Queens of the Stone Age, Supersuckers, Fu Manchu, Drive-By Truckers and Alice Cooper, among others. In 2004, Supagroup received a standing ovation for Alice Cooper, something Cooper claimed hasn&#x27;t happened since Guns N&#x27; Roses opened his shows. The band commonly calls their followers supagroupies.

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, was self-produced and self-released on their own Prison Planet label. They followed that with a live album. In 2001, &quot;Rock and Roll Tried to Ruin My Life&quot;, produced by Jack Endino, was released in a limited quantity. 2004&#x27;s self-titled album was produced by Benji Lee and Trina Shoemaker. The band&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Fire for Hire&quot; includes a number of studio versions of songs that first appeared on their &quot;We Came to Rock You&quot; live album, as well as songs influenced by the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina.

<text>U.S. Route 177 (US-177) is a spur of U.S. Route 77. It currently runs for 233 miles (375 km) from South Haven, Kansas at US-81 to Madill, Oklahoma at US-70. It passes through the states of Kansas and Oklahoma.

==Route description==

===Oklahoma===

US-177 begins concurrent with State Highway 199 at the US-70 junction near Madill, Oklahoma. From this point, it heads northwest, serving as the southern terminus of State Highway 1 and the main street of Mannsville. The route turns northward in Dickson, where it splits from SH-199. East of Gene Autry, it is the eastern end of SH-53. US-177 then runs through the Chickasaw National Recreation Area and the town of Sulphur, where it has a brief concurrency with SH-7. On the north side of Sulphur lies an interchange with the Chickasaw Turnpike.

US-177 continues north into western Garvin County, serving as the eastern terminus of SH-29 and crossing SH-19 in Stratford. The route then cuts across the narrow eastern tip of McClain County, where it begins concurrencies with both State Highway 59 and State Highway 3W. The three highways then cross the Canadian River into Pottawatomie County, where they meet SH-39 at a four-way stop in Asher.

Near unincorporated Pearson, SH-59 splits off to the east. US-177/SH-3W continue north to Tecumseh, where they have an interchange with SH-9. At this interchange, US-270 joins the concurrency. The three highways run along the west side of Shawnee. At the Interstate 40 interchange, SH-3W reunites with SH-3E, and the unified SH-3 (along with US-270) follows I-40. US-177 continues northward alone.

After crossing into Lincoln County, US-177 meets US-62 in Jacktown. Just west of Warwick, it meets SH-66 (old Route 66), and then passes under Interstate 44 (the Turner Turnpike), with no interchange. I-44 is accessed through the SH-66 – Wellston (Exit 157) interchange. US-177 then continues north, connecting to the town of Carney via SH-40A, the shortest state highway in Oklahoma. West of Tryon, it intersects State Highway 105. It then enters Payne County just south of the Cimarron River.

In Payne County, US-177 almost immediately passes through the town of Perkins. North of that community, it has a one-mile (1.6 km) concurrency with State Highway 33. It then passes through the county seat, Stillwater, the home of Oklahoma State University. There, it intersects SH-51. North of Stillwater, it serves as the western terminus of the Cimarron Turnpike Spur. Farther north, in Noble County, it crosses US-64 and the mainline of the Cimarron Turnpike. It then has a four mile (6.4 km) concurrency with State Highway 15.

US-177 then enters its final county in Oklahoma, Kay County. It serves Ponca City, where it begins a wrong-way concurrency with its parent, US-77, as well as US-60 (which is signed the &quot;correct&quot; direction). The routes split near Tonkawa. US-177 then runs through Blackwell and Braman. North of Braman, the route is the northernmost exit on Interstate 35 in Oklahoma. Six miles (9.7 km) after the I-35 junction, US-177 leaves Oklahoma.

===Kansas===
US-177 then enters Sumner County, Kansas near Hunnewell. Only 4 mi (6.4 km) north of the state line, US-177 ends at US-81 in downtown South Haven, Kansas. The terminus is less than a mile from the western terminus of US-166 (also on US-81) north of town.

==History==
Originally, the highway functioned as a shortcut for Wichita to Oklahoma City traffic traveling between US-81 at South Haven, KS and US-77 at Three Sands Jct, Oklahoma (where US-77 and State Highway 156 intersect outside Marland, Oklahoma today).

During the 1960s, the highway was extended south to Madill, Oklahoma, replacing the entire length of State Highway 40 from Ponca City, Oklahoma to then-US-66 (near Wellston, Oklahoma) and the portion of State Highway 18 between Shawnee, Oklahoma and Madill, Oklahoma (the segment between US-66 and Shawnee was constructed at this time). Vestiages of these highways remain in spur routes State Highway 40A, located entirely in Carney, Oklahoma and State Highway 18A, located south of Sulphur, Oklahoma.

During this extension, the alignments of US-77 and US-177 were altered in North Central Oklahoma as follows:

US-77 was relocated to run north from Three Sands Jct to Tonkawa, Oklahoma on the former route of US-177, then east on US-60 to Ponca City, Oklahoma. This also involved a new US-60 alignment between Tonkawa, Oklahoma and Ponca City, Oklahoma, where US-60, US-77, and US-177 all overlap on the same highway (which results in northbound US-77, eastbound US-60, and southbound US-177 traffic running in the same compass direction: east).

==Junction list==
















==State Highway 40A==
State Highway 40A is an highway in Lincoln County, Oklahoma. It is numbered after State Highway 40, the predecessor to US-177. It is the shortest state highway in Oklahoma.

The highway connects US-177 to the town of Carney, Oklahoma. It has a 25 mph (40 km/h) speed limit.

<text>WrestleMania 2 was the second annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). The event took place on April 7, 1986 (a Monday), making it the only WrestleMania that was not held on the traditional Sunday until the two-night WrestleMania 36 in April 2020. The event took place at three venues simultaneously: the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, the Rosemont Horizon in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois, and the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles, California.

Each venue had its own card of four matches each, totaling 12 matches for WrestleMania 2. The main event in Uniondale was a boxing match pitting Mr. T against Roddy Piper. In Chicago, the main event saw The British Bulldogs challenge The Dream Team for the Tag Team Championship. The main event in Los Angeles featured WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan defending his title against King Kong Bundy in a steel cage match. The undercard in Uniondale also saw WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage defend his title against George Steele, while the event in Chicago featured a 20-man battle royal involving WWF wrestlers and National Football League players.

==Production==
===Background===

Following the success of WrestleMania I in 1985, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) scheduled a second WrestleMania for the following year, thus establishing WrestleMania as an annual pay-per-view (PPV) event for the promotion. Unlike the previous year, WrestleMania 2 was scheduled to be held at three venues simultaneously on Monday, April 7, 1986: the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, the Rosemont Horizon in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois, and the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles, California. Each location was scheduled to have its own card of four matches each.

===Broadcasters===
The event featured separate commentary and announce teams in each location. The commentating teams consisted of Vince McMahon and Susan Saint James in New York; Gorilla Monsoon, Gene Okerlund, and Cathy Lee Crosby in Chicago; and Jesse Ventura, Alfred Hayes, and Elvira in Los Angeles. The ring announcers were Howard Finkel (New York), Chet Coppock (Chicago), and Lee Marshall (Los Angeles).

===Celebrities===

Ray Charles sang a rendition of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; before the show at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in New York. Celebrity guests in attendance for the New York segment included: Cab Calloway, Darryl Dawkins, G. Gordon Liddy, Joan Rivers, Joe Frazier, Lou Duva, Herb, and Susan Saint James. Celebrity guests in attendance for the Chicago segment included: Clara Peller, Dick Butkus, Ed Jones, Ozzy Osbourne, Bill Fralic, Ernie Holmes, Harvey Martin, Jim Covert, Russ Francis, William Perry, and Cathy Lee Crosby. The Los Angeles segment included celebrity guests Ricky Schroder, Robert Conrad, Tommy Lasorda, and Elvira.

===Storylines===
The card featured 12 matches, which resulted from scripted storylines and had results predetermined by the WWF. Building to the event, storylines between characters played out on WWF&#x27;s primary television programs, &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot;, &quot;All-Star Wrestling&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot; and &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;.
Three of the main-event feuds were set up on the March 1, 1986, &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event V&quot;. The main feud heading into WrestleMania 2 was between Hulk Hogan and King Kong Bundy, with the two battling over the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Although they had wrestled occasionally before, their first nationally televised encounter was on the November 2, 1985, &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event III&quot; where Hogan teamed up with André the Giant against André&#x27;s rivals Bundy and Big John Studd. Hogan and André won the match by disqualification. On March 1, Hogan defended his WWF title against The Magnificent Muraco. Just as Hogan was about to pin Muraco, Bundy ran into the ring and—with Muraco&#x27;s help—initiated a 2-on-1 assault on Hogan, repeatedly crushing him with his body weight (with a move called the &quot;Avalanche&quot;) to break his ribs. Hogan had a very serious (scripted) injury, while Bundy (gloating over his actions) challenged Hogan for the title. With revenge on his mind, Hogan decided not to heed his doctor&#x27;s advice and accepted the challenge; a match was then booked between the two in a steel cage for the WWF title.

The second feud heading into the event was between Mr. T and Roddy Piper. Piper established himself as the top heel in the WWF in 1984. A year later he joined Paul Orndorff and Bob Orton to feud with Hulk Hogan and Mr. T who defeated them in the main event of the first-ever WrestleMania. The Piper-Mr. T feud restarted in 1986 after their real-life hatred for each other became known, prompting the WWF to turn their animosity for one another into a feud. Piper and others in the locker room disliked Mr. T because he was an actor and had no prior wrestling training. In response, Mr. T became a special WWF boxer and began competing in boxing matches. On the March 1 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event V&quot;, Mr. T defeated Orton in a boxing match. After the match, Piper distracted Mr. T, allowing Orton to attack from behind and start a 2-on-1 assault. Mr. T then demanded revenge, leading to his boxing match against Piper.

The third main feud heading into WrestleMania was between The Dream Team (Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake) and The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) over the WWF Tag Team Championship. On August 24, 1985, Beefcake and Valentine won the tag titles from The U.S. Express (Barry Windham and Mike Rotundo). The British Bulldogs challenged Beefcake and Valentine for their titles immediately after their win. They retained their titles against the Bulldogs at a house show on September 11 by getting disqualified. They again defended the titles against the Bulldogs &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event V&quot;, where they emerged victorious against them. After the Bulldogs twice failed to win the titles, Dream Team agreed to defend their titles against them for a final time with a title match set at WrestleMania.

The other major feud heading into WrestleMania 2 was between Randy Savage and George Steele. Its genesis came after Steele, who used a neanderthal, &quot;missing link&quot;-type gimmick, became smitten with Savage&#x27;s manager, the beautiful Miss Elizabeth (Savage&#x27;s real-life wife, although unacknowledged on television). Their first meeting took place on a &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event IV&quot; aired shortly before Savage won the Intercontinental Championship. Steele would frequently be distracted by Elizabeth, which Savage used to his advantage. Along with former champion Tito Santana (who was on the Los Angeles segment of the event), Steele became one of Savage&#x27;s top challengers for the title.

==Event==
WrestleMania 2 emanated from three arenas: Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, the Rosemont Horizon in Rosemont, Illinois and the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles.

===New York===

In the first match of the show in the New York arena, Paul Orndorff faced The Magnificent Muraco. In the early part of the match, Orndorff body slammed Muraco. As the crowd reacted and Orndorff celebrated, he turned towards Mr. Fuji and made a racist slanty-eyed gesture followed by an Italian salute. This controversial moment is edited out of most home video versions of the match and is edited out of the version shown on the WWE Network. Both men fought to a double count-out.

Next was a WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship match between Randy Savage and George Steele, where Savage was seconded by his real-life wife Miss Elizabeth. Late in the match, Steele became the first man to ever kick out of Savage&#x27;s signature elbow from the top turnbuckle. Savage pinned Steele with a roll-up and put both of his feet on the ropes for leverage. As a result, Savage retained the Intercontinental Heavyweight Title.

The third match from the Coliseum was between Jake Roberts and George Wells. Roberts hit a DDT on Wells and pinned him to win the match. After the match, Roberts allowed his snake Damian to slither over Wells, who foamed from the mouth.

The last match was a boxing match between Mr. T and Roddy Piper. T was seconded by boxer Joe Frazier while Piper was seconded by boxing trainer Lou Duva. Piper was disqualified for bodyslamming T at 1:15 in the fourth round.

===Chicago===
The first match from the Chicago portion of WrestleMania 2 was a WWF Women&#x27;s Championship match between The Fabulous Moolah and Velvet McIntyre. McIntyre attempted a splash on Moolah from the second turnbuckle, but Moolah sidestepped and McIntyre missed the move. Moolah took advantage and pinned McIntyre to retain her title.

The second match was a flag match between Corporal Kirchner and Nikolai Volkoff. Freddie Blassie seconded Volkoff. He threw his cane to Volkoff, but Kirchner caught it and hit Volkoff with it and then pinned him for the victory.

The third match was a 20-man battle royal involving WWF wrestlers and National Football League players including: Jimbo Covert, Bill Fralic, Russ Francis, Ernie Holmes, Harvey Martin and William &quot;The Refrigerator&quot; Perry. The WWF stars included: André the Giant, Ted Arcidi, Tony Atlas, The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), The Killer Bees (B. Brian Blair and Jim Brunzell), Hillbilly Jim, The Iron Sheik, King Tonga, Pedro Morales, Bruno Sammartino, Danny Spivey and Big John Studd. In the end of the match, André the Giant and both members of the Hart Foundation were the final three participants. André first eliminated Neidhart and then Hart to win the battle royal.

The last match was a WWF Tag Team Championship match between The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) and The Dream Team (Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake). Ex-Black Sabbath lead singer Ozzy Osbourne and Lou Albano seconded the Bulldogs. After 13 minutes of back-and-forth action, Smith pushed Valentine into the corner where Valentine knocked heads with Dynamite Kid. Kid fell to the floor while Smith pinned Valentine to win the tag titles and end Dream Team&#x27;s seven-month reign.

===Los Angeles===
In Los Angeles, there were four more matches. Ricky Steamboat faced Hercules in the first match. Hercules tried to hit a flying bodypress but missed it. Steamboat followed by hitting a flying body press of his own for a pinfall victory.

Adrian Adonis, seconded by Jimmy Hart, defeated Uncle Elmer after a diving headbutt.

The Funk Brothers faced Junkyard Dog and Tito Santana in a tag team match. Jimmy Hart accompanied the Funk brothers. Hoss Funk distracted the referee. Hart took advantage and gave his megaphone to Terry Funk, who hit Junkyard Dog and then pinned him to get the win.
Finally, the main event of WrestleMania 2: a WWF World Heavyweight Championship steel cage match in which Hulk Hogan defended his title against King Kong Bundy. Hogan&#x27;s ribs were heavily taped due to an assault by Bundy on the March 1, 1986, edition of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event V&quot; where Bobby Heenan seconded Bundy.

At the start, Bundy removed the tape from Hogan&#x27;s ribs. However, Hogan fought back and rammed Bundy&#x27;s head into the steel cage. He tried to hit a scoop slam on Bundy but missed it. Bundy hit an avalanche and a big splash on Hogan. However, Hogan &quot;Hulked up&quot; and hit a power slam on Bundy followed by a leg drop. He climbed the steel cage, but Bundy caught his legs. Hogan kicked Bundy and climbed over the top of the steel cage and down to the floor to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Hogan caught Heenan inside the cage; as Bundy was reeling from the match, Hogan rammed Heenan&#x27;s head into the cage before atomic dropping him outside.

==Reception==

Critical response to the show was poor, with the decision to host the show in three locations being highly criticized. John Canton, of TJRwrestling.net said: &quot;I&#x27;m sure that the idea of doing this show from three different venues sounded like a good idea on paper to Vince McMahon, but it was not effective in terms of producing a quality program.&quot; &quot;Voices of Wrestling&quot;″s Bryan Rose commented that he could &quot;see why WWE went with just one arena from this point forward&quot;. Jason Powell of &quot;prowrestling.net&quot; was also happy to learn that subsequent WrestleManias would not be held in three arenas, saying &quot;Overall, WrestleMania 2 was excessive. The idea of running the show in three separate markets was an ill-conceived cash grab and I&#x27;m happy they never went down that road again.&quot;


John Canton, of &quot;TJR Retro&quot; was also very critical of the show&#x27;s promoted main events. He commented that &quot;every one of the big matches on the show was a disappointment from the Hogan/Bundy cage match, the battle royal and the Piper/Mr. T boxing match. If the big matches are that poor it hurts the whole show.&quot;

&quot;411Mania.com&quot;″s Rob McNew also had a negative opinion of the three &quot;main&quot; matches. McNew gave the boxing match 1 star out of 5 stars, saying: &quot;Big pull-apart brawl afterward. Absolute crap that took way too long and ended in a non-finish.&quot; He gave the steel cage match between Hogan and Bundy 2 stars, saying it &quot;felt more like a &quot;Saturday Night Main Event&quot; match than a WrestleMania main event&quot;. McNew awarded the entire event a score of 2 out of 10 and said: &quot;It lacks the historical significance of WrestleMania I to even watch it for that purpose. This was three hours of pain I&#x27;d love to have back. Thankfully the WWF would redeem themselves in a huge way the next year, but for this show, huge disappointment.&quot;
However, of the WWF Tag Team Championship match, McNew said: &quot;Tremendous match that breaks the streak of suck that had been this show thus far. One of the things that I really liked about this match was it seemed to break from the traditional tag team formula. There was no extended face in peril sequence nor was there a hot tag at any point. Easily the match of the night.&quot; He awarded it three and a half stars out of five. Despite general poor reviews for WrestleMania 2, Brandon Stroud from &quot;Uproxx&quot;, called the event superior to WrestleMania I, commenting: &quot;WrestleMania 2 is (believe it or not) a gigantic improvement over WrestleMania I... It&#x27;s not the best show ever—it&#x27;s nowhere near as important as III, and we wouldn&#x27;t get a great-in-total WrestleMania until X—but it&#x27;s the kind of thing that kicks your ass when you&#x27;re a kid, and that&#x27;s important.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Randy Savage and George Steele continued their feud with each other throughout 1986. This led to two rematches for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event IX&quot; in early 1987, both times with the Intercontinental title on the line and the second time with the management services of Elizabeth on the line; Steele lost both times. Savage also feuded intensely with Hogan, but was unsuccessful in winning the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from him.

The new WWF Tag Team Champions The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) prepared to face challenging tag teams. On October 4, 1986, &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event VII&quot;, they defeated former champions Dream Team (Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake) in a two out of three falls match to retain the titles.

Hulk Hogan continued his WWF World Heavyweight Championship reign. In addition to Savage, his top competition during 1986 included &quot;Adorable Adrian&quot; Adonis, Hercules Hernandez, Kamala and, in his biggest feud of the year, Paul Orndorff. A storyline was developed focusing on the friendship between Hogan and Orndorff with Adrian Adonis eventually starting trouble between the two causing Orndorff to turn against Hogan. Bundy, meanwhile, would team with Big John Studd on occasion (and begin his feud with The Machines). He would also challenge Hogan on-and-off for the World Heavyweight Championship during the next year and a half, until leaving the WWF in early 1988.

Following his battle royal win, André the Giant&#x27;s career was at a crossroads. Not yet evident to fans, he was beginning to suffer the health effects of his terminal illness known as acromegaly, a syndrome resulting from an excessive production of growth hormone that led to his gigantic size. Because of his health, a planned tour of Japan and accepted a starring role in the movie &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, André took a brief hiatus from the ring. To explain his absence, a storyline was devised to have André no-show for a tag team match pitting him and a partner of his choosing against long-time rivals Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy. André would then be suspended at the insistence of manager Bobby Heenan. André would return but compete under a mask as part of a new team called The Machines. Studd and Bundy insisted—but were never able to prove—that André and &quot;The Giant Machine&quot; were the same person.

WrestleMania 2 marked the last major pay-per-view appearance for Roddy Piper during his initial heel run. Shortly before the event, he taped four weeks worth of &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; segments that would air on the WWF&#x27;s syndicated programs in April, and then took a four-month hiatus from the ring.
When Piper returned to the WWF in August, he became a face and began a violent feud with Adonis, who had in the meantime started his own &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;-type talk show called &quot;The Flower Shop&quot;. Jesse &quot;the Body&quot; Ventura also took a leave of absence after WrestleMania 2; like Piper, he filmed several weeks worth of his talk show segment, &quot;The Body Shop&quot;, to air in the coming weeks. Afterward, The Magnificent Muraco would be the fill-in host of the segment until the final installment, aired August 30, 1986. In late August, Ventura returned for television tapings of the first &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, continuing his role as a heel-favoring color commentator.

WrestleMania 2 was seen as a financial success from a pay-per-view purchase standpoint, earning an estimated $5 million, leading Cable Television Business Magazine to compliment the event stating &quot;If anything, we learned from (WrestleMania), it&#x27;s that the right promotion makes an event successful&quot;. The magazine also described how Cablevision saw an increase in 5,300 subscribers the week of the pay-per-view alone compared to new subscriber numbers on average of 300 to 400 while stating it was the third-most purchased pay-per-view event ever to that point. WrestleMania 2 would air in reruns on Showtime in July 1986 even after some of the storylines that were started at the event had concluded.

<text>Carlos Francisco Delfino (born 29 August 1982) is an Argentine professional basketball player for Baltur Cento of the Italian Serie A2 Basket. Standing at , he plays at the small forward and shooting guard positions. He is also noted for his defense and three point shooting skills.

==Professional career==
===Early years===
The son of Carlos and Cristina Delfino, he began his professional career playing in the Argentine Basketball League for Olimpia de Venado Tuerto in the 1998–99 season, and he then transferred to Unión de Santa Fe in 1999–2000.

===Italian clubs===
Delfino moved to Italy in 2000 and played four seasons in the Italian A League, the first two with Reggio Calabria and the other two seasons with Skipper Bologna.

In his first season in Italy, he played for Reggio Calabria. In just under 21 minutes per game he averaged 8.8 points, 2.5 rebounds and 1.9 steals. He scored a season-high 25 points in his second game against Scavolini Pesaro, making five of eight three-point attempts. He scored 15 points in just 20 minutes against Cordivari Roseto and tallied 14 points apiece against Paf Bologna, Muller Verona and Kinder Bologna. He hit at least one three-pointer in 19 of 24 games.

In his first season with Skipper Bologna, he moved into the starting lineup in the third game of the season and averaged about 26 minutes. He scored 18 points, including shooting 3-of-5 from three-point range, versus Euro Roseto and posted double-doubles against Benetton Treviso (13 points, 13 rebounds), Oregon Scientific Cantù (15 points, 11 rebounds) and Pippo Milano (14 points, 11 rebounds). He suffered torn ligaments in his ankle late in the season, but returned in late May.

===Detroit Pistons (2004–2007)===
Beginning in 2004, Delfino signed to play for the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association, who made him the 25th pick in the first round of the 2003 NBA draft, making him the first Argentine player ever to be selected in the first round of the NBA draft. In November 2004, he suffered a knee injury that kept him on the injured list for over three months. He had an operation in the U.S. and then another in Argentina, where he recovered. However, Delfino did not immediately return to form after his rehabilitation, and was left off the Pistons&#x27; 2005 playoff roster. After he recovered from the knee injury, Delfino averaged 15.3 minutes, 3.9 points, 1.8 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game in 30 games under coach Larry Brown. Many regarded Brown as having limited space for Delfino&#x27;s offensive creativity. It was perceived that under the Pistons upcoming new coach Flip Saunders, that Delfino would thrive.

In his second season on the Pistons&#x27; active roster, Carlos averaged 10.7 minutes, 3.6 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 0.6 assists per game. Delfino played off the bench substituting for either Tayshaun Prince or Richard Hamilton. He had three straight games where he scored in double digits before being sidelined for the next 4 with the flu. Delfino became an important change-of-pace player in Flip Saunders&#x27; offensive scheme.

===Toronto Raptors===
On June 15, 2007, the Detroit Pistons traded Delfino to the Toronto Raptors for 2nd-round draft picks in both the 2009 NBA draft and the 2011 NBA draft. The 2007–08 season was his most productive in the NBA, as he averaged 9 points, 4.4 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game during the regular season.

On June 16, 2009, the Toronto Raptors extended a qualifying offer to Delfino.

===Khimki===
In the summer of 2008, Delfino signed a 3-year contract with the Russian Super League club Khimki Moscow Region. Delfino was one of the highest-paid basketball players in Europe, earning about US$10 million per season, plus a house, a car and a driver, and savings on taxes. He averaged 13.0 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 1.5 steals per game in Europe&#x27;s secondary level competition, the EuroCup, during the 2008–09 season.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2009–2012)===
On August 18, 2009, the Raptors signed and traded Delfino to the Milwaukee Bucks along with Roko Ukić in exchange for Amir Johnson and Sonny Weems.

Delfino had a breakout season with the Bucks, as he posted career highs in points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game and blocks per game, while playing 30 minutes per game. He also played a major role in the playoffs, shooting a career-high .405 from behind the 3-point line.

===Houston Rockets (2012–2013)===
On August 20, 2012, Delfino signed with the Houston Rockets. After being a starter for three years in Milwaukee, Delfino became the sixth man for the Rockets in 2012–13. On June 30, 2013, Delfino was waived by the Rockets.

Delfino&#x27;s final NBA game ever was during Game 5 of the 2013 Western Conference First Round on May 1, 2013. In that game, Houston would defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder 107 - 100 with Delfino playing for 10 minutes and the only stat he recorded was 1 assist. He missed the entire second half due to discomfort in his right foot, which was later found to have a fracture that caused him to miss the rest of the playoffs.

=== Injury-riddled seasons (2013-2016) ===
Delfino spent the next three years off the court due to various complications to the injury suffered while playing for Houston, which required nine surgical interventions. On July 17, 2013, Delfino signed with the Milwaukee Bucks. However, he never appeared in a game for the Bucks during the 2013–14 season due to his broken foot. On August 26, 2014, Delfino was traded, along with Miroslav Raduljica and a 2015 second-round draft pick, to the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Jared Dudley and a 2017 conditional first-round draft pick. Three days later, he was waived by the Clippers.

=== Comeback (2016-2017)===
Delfino made his return to the courts in 2016 when he joined Argentina&#x27;s senior basketball team at the Summer Olympics. On March 6, 2017, Delfino signed with the Argentine team Boca Juniors. There, he joined his brother Lucio, who was also recovering from injury.

On September 27, 2017, Delfino signed with Spanish club Baskonia. On October 26, 2017, Delfino finished his stint with Baskonia.

=== Return to Italy (2018–2023)===
On July 3, 2018, Delfino came back to Italy after 14 years and signed a deal with Italian club Auxilium Torino.

On February 27, 2019, Delfino returned to Bologna and signed on the Lavoropiù Bologna.

After one year where Delfino didn&#x27;t play anywhere, Jasmin Repeša, new coach of VL Pesaro, wanted him in his new team and he was the first hire for the season 2020-21 for Pesaro.

==National team career==
Delfino was a member of Argentina&#x27;s junior national team that won the bronze medal at the 2001 FIBA Under-21 World Championship that was held in Saitama, Japan. Delfino was also a part of the senior Argentine national basketball team that won the gold at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He also played with Argentina&#x27;s senior national team at the 2006 FIBA World Championship and at the 2008 Summer Olympics, where he helped Argentina to win the bronze medal.

In 2011, he won the gold medal in the 2011 FIBA Americas Championship, held in Mar del Plata.

After years of absence following injury, he played with Argentina&#x27;s senior basketball team at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

In 2022, Delfino won the gold medal in the 2022 FIBA AmeriCup held in Recife, Brazil. He was the Argentina&#x27;s starting small forward in the tournament

<doc id="903330" wikidata="Q2175043" url="?curid=903330" title="U.S. Route 277">
<text>U.S. Route 277 (US 277, US-277) is a north–south United States Highway that is a spur route of U.S. Route 77. It no longer connects to its parent route, US 77, although it does intersect another one of its spur (U.S. Route 377). It runs for 633 miles (1,019 km) across Oklahoma and Texas. US 277&#x27;s northern terminus is in Newcastle, Oklahoma at Interstate 44, which is also the northern terminus of the H.E. Bailey Turnpike. Its southern terminus is in Carrizo Springs, Texas at U.S. Route 83. It passes through the states of Oklahoma and Texas.

Most of U.S. 277&#x27;s route through the two states overlaps other U.S. highways. Those include U.S. 62 from Newcastle to Chickasha, Oklahoma, U.S. 62 and U.S. 281 from five miles (8 km) west of Elgin, Oklahoma, to Lawton, U.S. 281 from Lawton to Wichita Falls, Texas, U.S. 82 from Wichita Falls to Seymour, Texas, and U.S. 83 from Anson, Texas to Abilene, Texas. Through the Lawton area and again from Randlett, Oklahoma, to near downtown Wichita Falls, U.S. 277 is also co-signed with I-44.

==Route description==

===Texas===
The highway begins at an intersection with US 83 in Carrizo Springs, about 60 miles northwest of Laredo. The highway runs in an east-west direction, until reaching Eagle Pass. From here to Del Rio, the highway parallels the Rio Grande at the U.S.-Mexico border. The highway overlaps US 377 for about 26 miles, with the highways passing the Amistad National Recreation Area.

US 277 crosses I-10 near Sonora, before traveling to Eldorado and eventually San Angelo. The highway overlaps both US 67 and US 87 in the city. In Abilene, the highway overlaps with US 83 and US 84, with the latter leaving shortly after. US 83 leaves in Anson, traveling to Aspermont, while US 277 travels to Stamford. In Seymour, US 82 begins an overlap with US 277. The two highways enter the city of Wichita Falls, with US 82 leaving the highway at US 281/US 287. US 277 joins US 281/287 and the three highways travel into the downtown area of the city, where I-44 begins. US 287 leaves the freeway, while I-44/US 277/US 281 travel to Burkburnett, before crossing the Red River into Oklahoma.

===Oklahoma===

U.S 277 and 281 enter into Oklahoma with Interstate 44 from Texas by crossing the Red River. After six miles, U.S. 277-281 leave the H.E. Bailey Turnpike and run concurrently for three miles eastward with U.S. 70. On the outskirts of Randlett, this ends as U.S. 277-281 turn northward and pass under I-44 (with no interchange there) before entering Cookietown. North of Cookietown, U.S. 277-281 travel along SH 5. Near the town of Geronimo, U.S. 277-281 join I-44 at Exit 30 to bypass Lawton, but separate once again along with U.S. 62 north of the city at Exit 46. After a distance just under four miles, U.S. 277 separates from U.S. 62-281 and heads east for the town of Elgin. The route proceeds from there to serve several other towns bypassed by I-44, such as Fletcher, Cyril, and Cement, crossing the turnpike twice without direct access. Entering the town of Chickasha with U.S. 81, U.S. 277 turns east along U.S. 62 and follows it all the way to its northern terminus at I-44 near Newcastle.

From Newcastle to the Red River north of Wichita Falls, Texas, U.S. 277 (and concurrent sections of U.S. 62, U.S. 81 and U.S. 281) serves as an alternate free route to the two sections of the H.E. Bailey Turnpike between Oklahoma City and the Red River from Newcastle southwest of Oklahoma to near Medicine Park north of Lawton and from near Geronimo south of Lawton to Randlett just north of the Red River near Burkburnett, Texas.
==History==
When US 277 was commissioned in 1930, it ended at the Mexico–United States border in Del Rio, Texas. It was extended southeast to its present terminus in 1952. The original northern terminus was in Oklahoma City at its intersection with parent route US 77 and US 62. The northern terminus remained there until 1964. when it was truncated to its present terminus following the completion of the H.E. Bailey Turnpike and the connecting US 62 freeway into Oklahoma City, which would become I-44 in the 1980s. The section of highway through Wichita Falls was recently upgraded to a freeway. Known as Kell Boulevard, the freeway opened in late-2009/early-2010.

As of February 2010, US 277 allows a speed limit of only in Dimmit County, Texas.

==Future==
On March 15, 2022, a bill was signed by President Joe Biden that added the extension of I-27 north to Raton, New Mexico, and south to Laredo to the Interstate Highway System. The extension would utilize the US 277 corridor between San Angelo and Carrizo Springs, Texas.

===Former Lawton business route===

The former route of U.S. 277 (and 281) through the City of Lawton via 2nd Street and 11th Street (and a diagonal street connecting those two streets) has been designated as U.S. 281 Business since the completion of Lawton&#x27;s Pioneer Expressway (now I-44) in 1964 from present I-44 Exit 39-B to Exit 33. Present U.S. 281 Business and former U.S. 277-281 follows 2nd Street south of I-44 (Exit 39B) into the downtown area and south of Lee Boulevard (Oklahoma 7), curves into the diagonal route to 11th Street and still locally designated by the City of Lawton as Highway 277 even though it is officially designated as U.S. 281 Business. From the end of the diagonal route at 11th and Tennessee Avenue south past the Lawton-Fort Sill Regional Airport to Exit 33 of Interstate 44, the former U.S. 277-281 and current U.S. Business 281 route follows 11th Street. South of this point, U.S. 281 Business ends/begins and current U.S. 277-281 continues to run concurrent with I-44 for another 3 miles to Exit 30 (the starting/ending point for the southern section of the H.E. Bailey Turnpike), bypassing 3 miles of the former U.S. 277-281 concurrency that followed 11th Street south of Lawton until the completion of the present I-44 route south of Lawton in 1964, when the former highway reverted to local jurisdiction. At Exit 31, Oklahoma 36 begins its route to Chattanooga and Grandfield west of I-44 while U.S. 277-281 uses the same route east of the interstate for a half-mile and turning south toward Geronimo, over the continuation of Lawton&#x27;s 11th Street.

<doc id="903339" wikidata="Q1144225" url="?curid=903339" title="Nucleus RTOS">
<text>Nucleus RTOS is a real-time operating system (RTOS) produced by the Embedded Software Division of Mentor Graphics, a Siemens Business, supporting 32- and 64-bit embedded system platforms. The operating system (OS) is designed for real-time embedded systems for medical, industrial, consumer, aerospace, and Internet of things (IoT) uses. Nucleus was released first in 1993. The latest version is 3.x, and includes features such as power management, process model, 64-bit support, safety certification, and support for heterogeneous computing multi-core system on a chip (SOCs) processors.

Nucleus process model adds space domain partitioning for task and module isolation on SOCs with either a memory management unit (MMU) or memory protection unit (MPU), such as those based on ARMv7/8 Cortex-A/R/M cores.

== Supported platforms ==

Nucleus supports many embedded processors including leading ARMv7 Cortex A, R, and M devices. Recent releases support ARMv8 64-bit devices. The official website has a full list of supported devices. It includes 32-bit MCUs and MPUs, configurable devices, and 32-bit and 64-bit multi-core processors.

== History ==
Nucleus 1.x was released first in 1993 by Accelerated Technology (ATI) as Nucleus PLUS. It soon became one of the most commonly used RTOSs in the embedded market. Following its early success there, ATI added support for networking, graphics, and file systems, which accelerated adoption.

Mentor Graphics acquired ATI in March 2002, which was soon followed by the second generation of Nucleus RTOS. Version 2.x was released in 2003, improving its portability across different architectures and tool sets. New components like IPv6, Flash memory file system and Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0 were added. Mentor replaced the legacy Codelab debugger with EDGE development tools which included compiler tools, debugger, simulator, and profiler.

Mentor Graphics introduced the 3rd generation Nucleus in 2010. Version 3.x was intended for both high-end microprocessor units (MPUs), microcontroller units (MCUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). For devices with limited memory resources, Nucleus was designed to scale down to a memory size of &lt;10 kilobytes (KBs) for both code and data.

Nucleus 3.x introduced support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) both unsupervised uAMP and supervised sAMP (using Mentor Embedded Hypervisor). Other additions in Nucleus 3.x:
* Integrated power management support for kernel and middleware components; includes support for DVFS, tick suppression, and sleep modes including hibernation.
* Process model for memory partitioning to support dynamic loading and unloading of application modules. Loadable processes are supported on both high end MPUs and low end MCUs with or without hardware memory management support.
* Wireless support
* IoT protocols
* Safety certification for aerospace, medical, industrial and automotive
* Support for ARM TrustZone
* Mentor embedded multi-core framework for IPC and processor life cycle management for AMP designs (both supervised sAMP and unsupervised uAMP)
* Runtime tracing support with host side analysis tools

In addition to the new features in version 3.x, Nucleus moved business model from &quot;a la carte&quot;, to one unified package.

Mentor acquired CodeSourcery in Dec 2010 to replace the EDGE development tools with the Sourcery CodeBench. Sourcery CodeBench comprises a compiler tool-chain, debugger, and trace analysis tools. The compiler tool-chain is based on GNU tool-chain. The debugger and integrated development environment (IDE) are based on Eclipse. Sourcery CodeBench supports ARM, IA-32, MIPS, and PPC architectures with built-in workflows and OS awareness for Nucleus RTOS and Mentor Embedded Linux.

Nucleus 3.x introduced a unified build and configuration system with which the Kernel is configured through a single file and builds as a single library. Like menuconfig in Linux, a user interface (UI) based configuration tool integrated with CodeBench provides the user with graphically selectable components to customize the kernel at build time. The Nucleus configuration system allows for user customization to integrate new tool-chains, architecture support and build properties.

==Major components==
Nucleus RTOS components include:
# Kernel
# Services
# Connectivity
# File system
# Networking
# IoT Framework
# Wireless
# Security
# UI &amp; graphics

=== Kernel ===
* Real-time kernel with priority based pre-emptive scheduling
* Support for dynamic linking using loadable modules
* Interfaces for C++, &quot;Portable Operating System Interface&quot; (POSIX), and &quot;The Real-time Operating system Nucleus&quot; (TRON) microITRON
* SMP/AMP, supervised and unsupervised
* SMP support and runtime control for bound computation domain and affinities to processor cores for tasks and interrupts
* Support for 64-bit architectures
* Scalable to fit memory constrained devices
* Built-in power management framework
* Source code for all components

=== Services ===
* Run-level initialization and registry
* POSIX: kernel, networking, and file system
* Shell and tracing
* Debug agent
* C++
* Power management services

=== Connectivity ===
Nucleus supports the ability to connect to other devices through various interfaces including:
* USB 2.0 and 3.0
* USB Host, Function, and On-The-Go (OTG) stacks
* Bluetooth with many advanced profiles enabled (A2DP, AVRCP, HFP, HSP, etc.)
* Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), PCI-X and PCIe
* Controller Area Network (CAN) and CANopen
* Secure Digital (SDIO)
* SPI, QSPI
* Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C)

=== File system ===
Unlike Windows and Unix-like operating systems, Nucleus does not need a file system to work. However, for complex uses needing local storage, Nucleus supports several file systems including FAT, SAFE (fault tolerant), and LWEXT.

==== Multiple simultaneous file systems ====
* File Allocation Table (FAT)
* SAFE (high reliability power fail safe)
* LWEXT
* Install-able third-party file systems

==== Multiple media support ====
* CD-ROM
* Hard drive
* RAM disk
* NOR and NAND flash
* USB drive
* SD MMC
Nucleus provides support for different file systems and storage media through a virtual file system application programming interface (API) that allows access to the supported file systems and storage devices using the same functions calls regardless of the underlying storage format.

=== Networking ===
The Nucleus networking stack is a dual IPv4 and IPv6 stack that supports over 60 networking protocols. Nucleus networking stack supports POSIX and provides an easy to use socket based application interface. A brief list of the supported protocols include:
* Internet protocol suite (UDP, TCP/IP)
* Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), network address translation (NAT)
* Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE)
* File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Telnet, Secure Shell (SSH)
* Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Network Time Protocol (NTP)
* Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and HTTPS
* JSON-XML, WebSockets

=== Security ===
Nucleus supports a wide variety of encryption options for secure communications to protect data at rest or in transit. Nucleus ships with OpenSSL and an OpenSSL-like package wolfSSL (formerly CyaSSL) that is far smaller than OpenSSL for designs needing encryption but limited in memory capacity. Security protocols to protect data in transit include IPsec/IKE, SSH/SSL/TLS/DTLS. Encryption includes DES, 3DES, AES, SHA-256. Public-key cryptography algorithms include RSA. Support includes X.509, RADIUS, and 802.1X.

=== Wireless ===
Several Wi-Fi modules from different chip-makers like QCA, Broadcom, TI, and CSR are supported: 
* IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n
* IEEE 802.15.4
* Bluetooth, Bluetooth LE

=== UI graphics ===
Nucleus 3.x supports OpenGL and leading 3rd party UI libraries. Nucleus supports the Qt UI framework which has been optimized for code size and integrated into CodeBench for debugging and tracing. Other UIs supported include Embedded Wizard and Socionext CGI Studio.

=== IoT ===
Recent releases of Nucleus include support for HTTPS, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), MQTT and 6LoWPAN.

Nucleus has also announced support for Microsoft Azure cloud computing framework.

=== Industrial ===
Nucleus has been integrated with 3rd party industrial stacks from industry leaders. Industrial stack support includes OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) host and client and EtherNet/IP from Softing and EtherCAT from KoenigPa.

=== Multi-core ===
Nucleus supports asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) mode and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) mode for leading 32 and 64-bit heterogeneous multi-core SoCs. Nucleus is also capable of running as a GOS with Mentor Embedded Hypervisor.

When operating in AMP mode, Nucleus RTOS can coexist with other instances of Nucleus, Linux, and/or bare machine (metal) programs distributed on the other processors. In this mode, each processor is running independently and behaves as a separate system within the SoC. Mentor Embedded Multicore Framework provides interprocess communication between operating systems on the various cores, and processor life cycle management. SMP operation entails having a instantiation of Nucleus RTOS manage multiple cores simultaneously. Nucleus can distribute its operations across all cores on a multi-core device, or any subset of cores. For this purpose Nucleus offers runtime API support for bound computation domain, and control tasks and interrupt affinities for core assignment.

=== Product packages ===
Nucleus RTOS is packaged as follows:
* Nucleus ReadyStart Edition ReadyStart which includes the runtime system, middleware, BSP (all in source code) and the IDE, debugger, compiling tools, trace bundle in a single package. Nucleus Ready Start comes in versions packaged for ARM, MIPS and PPC. Nucleus ReadyStart adds specialized eclipse plugins to CodeBench to provide simplified build and configuration workflows and debugging enhancements including kernel awareness, loadable module support, tracing and profiling tools.
* Nucleus Source Code Edition contains the runtime system and middleware packaged to support unique architectures and/or different tool chains

=== Safety certification===
Nucleus SafetyCert has been certified for the highest levels of safety for DO-178C, IEC 61508, IEC 62304, and ISO 26262.

<text>Julie Elaine Doiron (born June 28, 1972) is a Canadian singer-songwriter of Acadian heritage. She has been the bass guitarist and co-vocalist for the Canadian indie rock band Eric&#x27;s Trip since its formation in 1990. She has released ten solo albums, beginning with 1996&#x27;s &quot;Broken Girl&quot;, and is also the lead singer for the band Julie and the Wrong Guys.

== Early life ==
Julie Elaine Doiron was born in Moncton, New Brunswick. She graduated from École Mathieu-Martin, a francophone high school in Dieppe, in 1990.

==Career==
Doiron started playing guitar (later switching to bass) in Eric&#x27;s Trip at the age of 18, having joined the band at the insistence of her then-boyfriend, Eric&#x27;s Trip guitarist Rick White. Shortly before the band&#x27;s break-up in 1996, she released a solo album under the name Broken Girl, which followed two previous 7-inch EPs (&quot;Dog Love, Pt. 2&quot; &amp; &quot;Nora&quot;) also released under that name. All of her subsequent material has been released under her own name. She started her own label, Sappy Records, to release several of her solo efforts. Although most of her solo material has been written and performed in English, she also released an album of French language material, &quot;Désormais&quot;, as well as several EPs of material sung in Spanish.

In 1999, Doiron performed at the 1999 Stardust Picnic festival at Historic Fort York, Toronto. That year she recorded an album with the Ottawa band Wooden Stars, which was the first time she had worked with a band since the end of Eric&#x27;s Trip. Also in 1999, she was featured in a film, entitled Salt, which was filmed that fall. The film was created by the National Film Board of Canada, and released in 2000. She shared a Juno Award for &quot;Julie Doiron and the Wooden Stars&quot; in March 2000.

Eric&#x27;s Trip reunited in 2001, and have played shows periodically ever since. She has also appeared as a guest musician on albums by The Tragically Hip (2000s &quot;Music at Work&quot;), Gordon Downie (2001&#x27;s &quot;Coke Machine Glow&quot;, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Nudes&quot; and 2010&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Bounce&quot;), and Herman Düne. In 2006 she helped launch SappyFest with Paul Henderson and Jon Claytor as an extension of the reinstated Sappy Records. She has also released a split record co-credited to the alternative country band Okkervil River, and collaborated with Frederick Squire and American musician Phil Elverum on the 2008 Mount Eerie album &quot;Lost Wisdom&quot;. She played with indie rock band Shotgun &amp; Jaybird until their demise in 2007. She also played drums as part of a short-lived duo with Fred Squire. Initially called &quot;Blue Heeler&quot;, they changed their name to &quot;Calm Down Its Monday&quot;, and released a split 7-inch EP on K Records, with two solo Doiron songs on the flip side.

Apart from her musical career, Doiron is an avid photographer, having published a book of her photographs entitled &quot;The Longest Winter&quot; with words by Ottawa writer Ian Roy. She often does her own promotional photos and cover artwork along with her ex-husband, painter Jon Claytor.

Her album &quot;Woke Myself Up&quot; was shortlisted for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize.

In 2009, Doiron told a reporter from &quot;The Strand&quot;, a college newspaper at the University of Toronto, that she and Chad VanGaalen were exploring the possibility of collaborating on an album. She appeared on a track from VanGaalen&#x27;s EP of &quot;Soft Airplane&quot; B-sides that year, but no further news pertaining to a potential album collaboration has been released.

During the tour to support the 2009 album &quot;I Can Wonder What You Did with Your Day&quot;, the mayor of Bruno, Saskatchewan proclaimed June 7, 2009, as &quot;Julie Doiron Day&quot;. Doiron performed at the local All Citizens arts centre on that day.

Over the three-year period between &quot;I Can Wonder&quot; and her 2012 album &quot;So Many Days&quot;, Doiron moved several times, residing at different times in Montreal, Toronto and Sackville. While living in Toronto, she had difficulty making ends meet due to the city&#x27;s high cost of living, and began teaching yoga classes, and performing a weekly residency at the Saving Gigi club, to help pay the bills. By the time &quot;So Many Days&quot; was released in the fall of 2012, she had moved back to Sackville.

In July 2014, Doiron&#x27;s song &quot;The Life of Dreams&quot;, from &quot;I Can Wonder What You Did with Your Day&quot;, appeared in an iPhone commercial.

In 2016, Doiron collaborated with musicians Jon McKiel, C.L. McLaughlin, Michael C. Duguay, James Anderson and Chris Meaney on the project Weird Lines, whose self-titled album was released on Sappy Futures in July. She then collaborated with Eamon McGrath, Mike Peters and Jaye Schwarzer on the project Julie and the Wrong Guys, which released a self-titled album in 2017 on Dine Alone Records. In 2017 and 2018, Doiron has also released several EPs of Spanish language renditions of her own previously recorded songs.

In 2021 Doiron released the album &quot;I Thought of You&quot;. Her first full-length solo recording in nine years, it includes musical contributions from Daniel Romano and Dany Placard. The song &quot;August 10&quot; from &quot;Broken Girl&quot; became popular on TikTok in late 2024 and early 2025, leading to the song reaching #12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs chart on January 16, 2025. On February 3, 2025, The Numero Group announced a campaign to reissue Broken Girl on vinyl for the first time and Lonliest In The Morning back in print for the first time since its initial release cycle in the 90s. The Numero Group also announced Julie would be joining the line up for the Numero 22 anniversary show in April 2025.

== Personal life ==
Doiron has moved several times throughout her career, living in Montreal for six years until moving to Sackville in 2004 with the release of &quot;Goodnight Nobody&quot;. When she was married to Jon Claytor, they had three children. As of 2022, Doiron was in a relationship with Quebec-based musician Dany Placard, with whom she released a collaborative album &quot;Julie &amp; Dany&quot; that year.

<text>The Glimmerglass Festival (formerly known as Glimmerglass Opera) is an American opera company. Founded in 1975 by Peter Macris, the Glimmerglass Festival presents an annual season of operas at the Alice Busch Opera Theater on Otsego Lake eight miles (13 km) north of Cooperstown, New York, United States. The summer-only season usually consists of four productions performed in rotating repertory. Glimmerglass is well known for producing new, lesser-known, and rare works, many of which in years past have been co-produced with the New York City Opera. It is the second-largest summer opera festival in the United States, currently led by artistic and general director Robert Ainsley, who succeeded Francesca Zambello in 2022.

==History==
Until 2011, the company operated under the name Glimmerglass Opera. The company presented its first season in the summer of 1975, when four performances of &quot;La bohème&quot; were staged in the auditorium of the Cooperstown High School. In the years since, it has grown considerably and now offers more than 40 performances of four operas, nearly always in new productions, each summer.

Operas have been performed in repertory since 1990. For the first seventeen seasons, all operas were sung in English. Since 1992, the operas have, with some exceptions, been performed in their original language with projected titles in English. Several works have had their American or world premieres at Glimmerglass. The 1999 season featured the world premiere of &quot;Central Park&quot;, three one-act operas performed as a single work, a joint commission by Glimmerglass Opera, New York City Opera, and Thirteen/WNET&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot;, which telecast it on PBS in January 2000. The telecast was nominated for an Emmy Award.

Paul Kellogg was the general director of Glimmerglass Opera from 1979 to 1996 and the artistic director from 1996 to 2006. Esther Nelson took on the role of general director from 1996 to 2003. Stewart Robertson was music director of Glimmerglass Opera from 1988 to 2006. In October 2008, Glimmerglass Opera announced the appointment of David Angus as the company&#x27;s next music director, starting in the summer of 2010. Francesca Zambello became artistic and general director of the newly renamed Glimmerglass Festival in 2011 and Joseph Colaneri was appointed music director in 2013. Zambello stood down at the close of the 2022 season; she was succeeded by Robert Ainsley.

The Young American Artists program, established in 1988, brings singers in the first stages of their professional careers to study and perform at Glimmerglass. These young artists are chosen annually from hundreds of applicants from throughout the United States. In addition to rehearsing and performing, Young Artists receive musical coaching, attend classes in diction and acting, and are given instruction in such non-performing skills as audition techniques, role preparation, and the business aspects of managing a career. Administrators from many of the world&#x27;s leading opera houses visit Glimmerglass throughout the summer and hear the Young Artists in performance. In the course of the summer each Young Artist gives a solo song recital at venues in Cooperstown and nearby Cherry Valley, a feature of the Glimmerglass season that has become extremely popular with opera patrons and the local community.

==Alice Busch Opera Theater==
The Glimmerglass Festival&#x27;s Alice Busch Opera Theater, which opened in June 1987, was built on of farmland donated by Tom Goodyear, its first chairman. The 914-seat theater is notable for its pastoral setting, for being the first American opera house built since 1966, and for its sliding walls, closed only while singers are on-stage and in foul weather. The theater was designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates.

The new theater was built to move the performances from a high school auditorium with poor acoustics and sight lines and no orchestra pit to a building with an interior designed specifically for opera performances. The exterior design was inspired by local farm buildings to fit with the surrounding landscape and to promote a less formal and more relaxed atmosphere suitable for a summer theater. For environmental and cost efficiencies, the building was designed to use only natural ventilation, without any mechanical heating or cooling.

==Recent festival seasons==
The Festival&#x27;s 2010 season featured four new productions, including Copland&#x27;s &quot;The Tender Land&quot;, and Handel&#x27;s &quot;Tolomeo&quot;. During the 2011 season Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Médée&quot; was presented. Also, a double bill featuring the world premiere of &quot;A Blizzard on Marblehead Neck&quot;, with music by Jeanine Tesori set to Tony Kushner&#x27;s libretto (a story inspired by the life of Eugene O&#x27;Neill) along with &quot;Later the Same Evening&quot;, a one-act opera based on characters in five of Edward Hopper&#x27;s paintings with a score by John Musto from a libretto by Mark Campbell.

In 2012, the festival featured Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;, Lully&#x27;s &quot;Armide&quot;, Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; and the musical &quot;The Music Man&quot;. &quot;Armide&quot; was presented in collaboration with Opera Atelier of Toronto, Canada, and &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; presented in collaboration with Cape Town Opera of South Africa.

The 2015 festival included Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Catone in Utica&quot;, and Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;.

2016&#x27;s season featured Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;, Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La gazza ladra&quot; (billed as &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot;), and Ward&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot;.

The 2017 season included Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, Händel&#x27;s &quot;Xerxes&quot;, Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;The Siege of Calais&quot;, Victor Simonson and Paige Hernandez&#x27;s &quot;Stomping Grounds&quot;, and Derrick Wang&#x27;s &quot;Scalia/Ginsburg&quot;.

For 2019&#x27;s season, the festival commissioned Jeanine Tesori und Tazewell Thompsons opera &quot;Blue&quot; which picks up the issue of African-American teenage boys having become an &#x27;endangered species&#x27; and a prime target of police brutality in the United States. The work is one of the very few in opera history that features a solely African-American cast.

<text>In economics and marketing a universe is a population to be studied or measured.

In economics a population to be measured is described as a &quot;universe&quot;, and the measures which are generated are intended to reflect the behavior of that population. Different statistical surveys may measure related, but different, universes and have to be adjusted to reflect this difference. For example, the American Bureau of Labor Statistics has a household survey and an establishment survey to measure employment. The differences in the populations and behavior that these two surveys measure are said to be the differences in their &quot;universe&quot;.

The word has a similar meaning in marketing, where it describes the activity in a given population. For example, ASCAP measures airplay in different radio &quot;universes&quot; to determine royalties for different songs, because e.g. air play in the &quot;classical&quot; universe is compensated differently from popular music. It also fundamental to television audience measurement: advertisers buy into programmes based on the ratings in different demographic universes and those different universes will cost different amounts. For example, a hair dye ad campaign may buy 1000 Gross Rating Points (GRP) in the Women 25-44 universe in order to target that particular audience, rather than a demographic irrelevant to their product.

<doc id="903354" wikidata="Q7872733" url="?curid=903354" title="USS Paul Revere">
<text>USS &quot;Paul Revere&quot; (APA/LPA-248) was the lead ship of the &quot;Paul Revere&quot; class of attack transport in the United States Navy. She was named for the early patriot and Founding Father, Paul Revere (1735–1818). She later served in the Spanish Navy as &quot;Castilla&quot; (L-21).

The ship was designed under project SCB 14 and laid down as Maritime Administration Hull 27 on 15 May 1952 by the New York Shipbuilding Corp., Camden, New Jersey, and was launched on 11 April 1953 as SS &quot;Diamond Mariner&quot;, sponsored by Mrs. Franklin Ewers. The ship was delivered to MARAD on 22 December 1953, and was operated by the Prudential Steamship Corporation for MARAD until placed in the Maritime Reserve Fleet on 24 July 1954. She was acquired by the US Navy on 14 September 1956, classified APA-248 and named &quot;Paul Revere&quot; on 4 June 1957, converted by Todd Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California, and commissioned at Long Beach, California on 3 September 1958.

==Service history==

===1958–1964 ===
After shakedown, &quot;Paul Revere&quot; spent the next full year participating in a series of amphibious training operations: &quot;Rocky Shoals&quot; at San Diego in November 1958, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; at Camp Pendleton in February 1959, &quot;PACNAMIDLEX&quot; at Del Mar, California in August, &quot;Clear Ridge&quot; off California in September, and &quot;Totem Pole&quot; at Kodiak, Alaska during November.

During 1960–1961, she was assigned &quot;Ready APA&quot; duty, in which she maintained on board, at all times, a fully equipped and reinforced battalion of landing troops to be put ashore on short notice at any trouble spot in the Pacific. On 21 March 1961 trouble flared in Laos, and &quot;Paul Revere&quot; commenced patrolling the waters off the coast of Southeast Asia. She remained in the area in a ready status for a total of fifty-four days until tensions eased, then resumed her normal South China Sea patrol.

In January 1962, after returning to the U.S., &quot;Paul Revere&quot; accomplished a most dramatic rescue, when one of several helicopters engaged in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises plunged into the ocean. Operating several hundred yards from the scene, she launched a manned boat which returned the three crewmen of the helicopter to the ship for medical treatment, all in the space of six minutes.

Following overhaul, she spent the last five or six months of 1962 in the Western Pacific. This deployment included the ports of Subic Bay, Hong Kong, and several ports in Japan. The year 1963 saw her complete a successful WestPac deployment and another rigorous schedule of training operations.

Departing San Diego on 28 January 1964 for her fourth WestPac deployment en route to Pearl Harbor &quot;Paul Revere&quot; participated in &quot;Coco Palm&quot;, a merchant convoy sailing exercise. From Pearl Harbor she sailed to Buckner Bay in preparation for one of the largest amphibious operations since the end of World War II. This exercise, called &quot;Back Pack&quot;, involved over 50,000 American and Nationalist Chinese personnel and over 125 ships. It was conducted off the southwestern coast of Taiwan and terminated on 12 March. &quot;Paul Revere&quot; also participated in &quot;Ligtas&quot;, a combined SEATO exercise in the Philippines during May, and operation &quot;Minute Hand&quot;, conducted at Numazu, Japan in July. While returning to the states in August 1964 USS &quot;Turner Joy&quot; and USS &quot;Maddox&quot; were fired upon by North Vietnamese vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin. &quot;Paul Revere&quot; was turned around and went back to Okinawa and picked up 2,500 Marines and sailed for Vietnam. She went up the Saigon River to aid in the salvage of . Returning to the United States, she joined another convoy exercise, &quot;Mad Bull&quot;, and arrived San Diego in October.

===Vietnam, 1964–1972===
&quot;Paul Revere&quot; spent the first seven months of 1965 conducting training operations off the coast. In August it lifted elements of the 1st Marine Division to Okinawa and during October and November it transported personnel of South Korea&#x27;s Tiger Division to Qui Nhon, South Vietnam from Pusan. From 7–18 November it conducted its first actual combat assault as a unit involved in Operation Blue Marlin, with Marine battalions embarked. The ship was involved in a similar operation called Operation Double Eagle at Quảng Ngãi Province, landing the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division, on 28 January 1966. It continued lift support for Marine units in Vietnam through March and then returned to San Diego on 19 April. Personnel aboard &quot;Paul Revere&quot; were eligible for hostile fire pay for the months of November 1965 as well as January and February 1966.

&quot;Paul Revere&quot; resumed coastal operations on its return, until May 1967 when it again deployed to the Far East. As a unit of the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) off the coast of Vietnam it engaged in operations &quot;Belt Drive&quot;, &quot;Fortress Sentry&quot;, &quot;Formation Leader&quot; and &quot;Knox&quot;. The ship returned to San Diego on 16 December and commenced coastal operations. For meritorious service from 17 August to 11 November 1967 during sustained amphibious operations against communist insurgent forces in the Republic of Vietnam, &quot;Paul Revere&quot; was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the first ship of its type to receive the award.

During 1968 the ship participated in training cruises for Naval Reservists and Midshipmen, including a special familiarization cruise for Sea Cadets. It also continued its upkeep and training preparations for its next coming deployment in January 1969.

Having been redesignated LPA-248 on 1 January 1969, &quot;Paul Revere&quot; deployed on 30 January, departing San Diego as part of ARG &quot;Bravo&quot; (TG 76.5) in company with , , , , and , bound, via Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay, for Southeast Asia. Ports-of-call during the cruise included Pearl Harbor, Subic Bay, Buckner Bay, Okinawa; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Yokosuka, and Hong Kong. &quot;Paul Revere&quot; arrived in its operating area off South Vietnam on 7 March and delivered its cargo to Da Nang and supported combat operations conducted by a USMC Battalion Landing Team which was embarked on board.

Toward the end of the deployment, &quot;Paul Revere&quot; participated in a series of &quot;Keystone&quot; operations beginning with Operation Keystone Eagle on 14 July 1969. After a farewell ceremony on the deep water piers in Da Nang Harbor, the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines boarded &quot;Paul Revere&quot; and sailed for Okinawa in the first increment of America&#x27;s withdrawal from South Vietnam. A photograph of the ship loading Marines appeared in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 9th Marines were transported to Okinawa in two subsequent trips. &quot;Paul Revere&quot; was relieved of duty with ARG &quot;Bravo&quot; (TG 76.5) by on 29 August 1969 at Subic Bay. In an awards ceremony at Naval Station San Diego, Captain Mitchell Karlowicz was awarded the Bronze Star for commanding &quot;Paul Revere&quot; in support of combat operations against the enemy.

On 7 November 1969, USS &quot;Paul Revere&quot; participated in an exercise with several ships and , to test torpedoes on a decommissioned submarine, , which was to be sunk as a target in the SoCal Op Areas. &quot;Bream&quot;, which was operated remotely from &quot;Paul Revere&quot;, was ultimately sunk by naval gunfire from an accompanying cruiser.

&quot;Paul Revere&quot; had a dry dock period at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard from November 1969 to April 1970. During the time in the yards, it was refitted with modern ECM equipment and additional communications hardware to enable the ship to deploy as the flagship for Amphibious Groups I and III on a WestPac cruise in September 1970. The cruise began with &quot;Paul Revere&quot; escorting two new gunboats, and , to Pearl Harbor. During the 1970–71 cruise, under the command of a naval aviator, Captain Charles Lindberg, the ship visited Pearl Harbor, Bangkok, Subic Bay, Okinawa, Sasebo, Keelung, Taiwan; Yokosuka, Hong Kong and Singapore. On the voyage to Singapore &quot;Paul Revere&quot; crossed the equator and initiated the crew&#x27;s &quot;pollywogs.&quot;

The USS Paul Revere LPA-248 deployed for WESTPAC in early summer of 1972. The ship stopped at Eniwetok Atoll where it delivered to the atoll guardians a LCM boat as theirs had been destroyed by a typhoon we spent a full day there. Eniwetok was where the US set off our first hydrogen bomb at and was still highly radioactive at the time. Not knowing some of the crew fished there, BIG FISH and ate them. When not off the Coast of Nam acting as TASK FORCE 76 and the 9th MASRINE AMPHIBIOUS BRIGADE the ship made R&amp;R in Hong Kong, visited Keelung Taiwan, Koshing Taiwan, Subic Bay. In Nam operations electronic eves dropping was a constant operation. The Ship went into Danang Harbor twice during the cruise and took part in FAKE AMPHIBIUS ASSAULTS to DRAW Noth Vietnamese forces away from Quan Tri City in SEP of 1972. During that operation the USS Paul REVER was fired upon by NV forces upon TIGER Island and the ship returned fire and hostile fire ceased. Allied response to the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive The Ship tied up at White Beach Okinawa frequently upon breaks from Nam it was also main HQ the 9th Marines. The USS Paul Revere LPA-248 returned to San Diego during the month of March 1973 and stopped at Pearl Harbor to refuel along the way.

===Post-Vietnam, 1972–decommissioning===

&quot;Paul Revere&quot; made a WESTPAC cruise February to September 1974 and was host to TACRON-1 Unit Delta and Seventh Fleet Amphibious Staff. After departing the US to begin the cruise, after passing Guam, the ship was shadowed by a Russian trawler until reaching its first port of call, White Beach, Okinawa. After Okinawa the next stops were, Subic Bay and the Tonkin Gulf. Skirting just outside the Vietnam combat zone, &quot;Paul Revere&quot; passed near a Russian task force of seven combat ships, mostly destroyers. During which time some of the vessels approached the ship. The next stop was Bangkok, Thailand, and then Singapore. On the way to Jakarta, Indonesia, the crew crossed the equator. Returning briefly to Subic Bay, &quot;Paul Revere&quot; made a hasty run to open water to escape being caught in port during an incoming typhoon. Eventually stopping back at Okinawa. &quot;Paul Revere&quot; continued its &#x27;74 WESTPAC north to South Korea and Japan.

After Vietnam &quot;Paul Revere&quot; was placed in reserve status, home-ported at Terminal Island, Long Beach, California and crewed by Naval Reserve personnel.

Later in 1974, she took on the men and equipment of the 3rd Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington and delivered them to the Marine Corps Camp Pendleton for amphibious operations and desert warfare training. During the voyage, she was followed by a Soviet Union submarine, which was in turn followed by a U.S. Navy submarine.

In February 1975, she took the men and equipment of the 2nd Battalion 2nd Infantry, 9th Infantry division at Fort Lewis Washington and delivered them to San Diego for training at Coronado Naval Base and Camp Pendleton for Amphibious and Range Training.

In the summer of 1977 during her crew&#x27;s annual drill period, she took on board the men and equipment of 2nd Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment (part of 1st Brigade, 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington), and delivered them to Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base for amphibious operations training.

In May 1979, &quot;Paul Revere&quot; served as a training platform for the first Seaman Apprenticeship class to be trained on a US naval vessel. Previously to this all sailor&#x27;s who went to Seaman Apprenticeship training did so on USS &quot;Never Sail&quot; at RTC San Diego, California. At the time, the ship was based out of Long Beach and for two weeks, the students participated in both classroom and OJT instruction. At midpoint in training, &quot;Paul Revere&quot; got underway and spent the weekend at sea and even performed an Unrep.

== &quot;Castilla&quot; (L-21) ==
&quot;Paul Revere&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 January 1980, and subsequently sold through the Security Assistance Program to Spain on 17 January 1980, renamed &quot;Castilla&quot; (L-21). The Spanish Navy decommissioned the ship on 6 June 1998, and in 2000 it was scrapped at Puerto de Santa Maria, Spain, the seaport from which Columbus embarked on his second voyage.

<text>Anarchists have employed certain symbols for their cause since the 19th century, including most prominently the circle-A and the black flag. Anarchist cultural symbols have become more prevalent in popular culture since around the turn of the 21st century, concurrent with the anti-globalization movement and with the punk subculture.

== Flags ==

=== Red flag ===

The red flag was one of first anarchist symbols and it was widely used in late 19th century by anarchists worldwide. Peter Kropotkin wrote that he preferred the use of the red flag. French anarchist Louise Michel wrote that the flag &quot;frightens the executioners because it is so red with our blood. [...] Those red and black banners wave over us mourning our dead and wave over our hopes for the dawn that is breaking.&quot;

Use of the red flag by anarchists largely disappeared after the October Revolution, when red flags started to be associated only with Bolshevism and communist parties and authoritarian, bureaucratic and reformist social democracy, or authoritarian socialism.

=== Black flag ===
The black flag has been associated with anarchism since the 1880s, when several anarchist organizations and journals adopted the name &quot;Black Flag&quot;.

Howard J. Ehrlich writes in &quot;Reinventing Anarchy, Again&quot;:

The origins of the black flag are uncertain. Modern anarchism has a shared ancestry with—among other ideologies—socialism, a movement strongly associated with the red flag. As anarchism became more and more distinct from socialism in the 1880s, it adopted the black flag in an attempt to differentiate itself. It was flown in the 1831 Canut revolt, in which black represented the mourning of liberty lost.

The French anarchist paper &quot;Le Drapeau Noir&quot; (&quot;The Black Flag&quot;), which printed its first issue in August 1883, is one of the first published references to use black as an anarchist color. Black International was the name of a London-based British anarchist group founded in July 1881.One of the first known anarchist uses of the black flag was by Louise Michel, participant in the Paris Commune in 1871. Michel flew the black flag during a demonstration of the unemployed which took place in Paris on March 9, 1883. With Michel at the front carrying a black flag and shouting &quot;Bread, work, or lead!&quot; the crowd of 500 protesters soon marched off towards the boulevard Saint-Germain and pillaged three baker&#x27;s shops before the police arrested them. Michel was arrested and sentenced to six years solitary confinement. Public pressure soon forced the granting of an amnesty. She wrote, &quot;The black flag is the flag of strikes and the flag of those who are hungry&quot;.

The black flag soon made its way to the United States. The black flag was displayed in Chicago at an anarchist demonstration in November 1884. According to the English-language newspaper of the Chicago anarchists, it was &quot;the fearful symbol of hunger, misery and death&quot;. Thousands of anarchists attended Kropotkin&#x27;s 1921 funeral behind the black flag.

=== Bisected flag ===

The colors black and red have been used by anarchists since at least the late 1800s when they were used on cockades by Italian anarchists in the 1874 Bologna insurrection and in 1877 when anarchists entered the Italian town of Letino carrying red and black flags to promote the First International. Diagonally divided red and black flags were used by anarcho-syndicalists in Spain such as the labor union CNT during the Spanish Civil War. George Woodcock writes that the bisected black-and-red flag symbolized a uniting of &quot;the spirit of later anarchism with the mass appeal of the [First] International&quot;.

==Symbols==
=== Circle-A ===


The symbol composed of the capital letter &quot;A&quot; surrounded by a circle is universally recognized as a symbol of anarchism and has been established in global youth culture since the 1970s. An interpretation held by anarchists such as Cindy Milstein is that the &quot;A&quot; represents the Greek (&#x27;without ruler/authority&#x27;), and the circle can be read as the letter &quot;O&quot;, standing for &quot;order&quot; or &quot;organization&quot;, a reference to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&#x27;s definition of anarchism from his 1840 book &quot;What Is Property?&quot;: &quot;As man seeks justice in equality, so society seeks order in anarchy&quot; ().

In the 1970s, anarcho-punk and punk rock bands such as Crass began using the circle-A symbol in red, thereby introducing it to non-anarchists. Crass founder Penny Rimbaud would later say that the band probably first saw the symbol while traveling through France.

=== Black cat ===


The origin of the black cat symbol is unclear, but according to one story it came from an Industrial Workers of the World strike that was going badly. Several members had been beaten up and were put in a hospital. At that time a skinny, black cat walked into the striker&#x27;s camp. The cat was fed by the striking workers and as the cat regained its health, the strike took a turn for the better. Eventually the striking workers won some of their demands, and they adopted the cat as their mascot. 

The Swiss anarchist Théophile Steinlen made use of the black cat (&quot;Le Chat Noir&quot;) in a number of his paintings. In an 1890 oil painting, he depicted a black cat raising a red banner emblazoned with the word &quot;Gaudeamus&quot; (). And in the large landscape painting &quot;Apotheosis of the Cats of Montmartre&quot;, he showed a clowder of cats on the rooftops of a working-class Parisian neighbourhood, beneath the moon. Francophone anarchists like Steilein and Zo d&#x27;Axa were inspired by the independent and undomesticated nature of the cat.

The name &quot;Black Cat&quot; has been used for numerous anarchist-affiliated collectives and cooperatives, including a music venue in Austin, Texas (which was closed following a July 6, 2002 fire) and a now-defunct &quot;collective kitchen&quot; in the University District of Seattle, Washington.

== Slogans ==
&quot;Do as you wish! Do what you want!&quot; is a slogan of Errico Malatesta&#x27;s Anarchist Program. It is explained in his pamphlet &quot;Anarchy&quot;.

The freedom we want, for ourselves and for others, is not an absolute metaphysical, abstract freedom which in practice is inevitably translated into the oppression of the wealthy; but it is real freedom, possible freedom, which is the conscious community of interests, voluntary solidarity. We proclaim the maxim DO AS YOU WISH, and with it we almost summarize our program, for we maintain—and it doesn&#x27;t take much to understand why—that in a harmonious society, in a society without government and without property, each one will WANT WHAT HE MUST DO.


=== No gods, no masters ===
&quot;No gods, no masters&quot; is a phrase associated with anarchist philosophy and the leftist labor movement. Likely dating back to a 15th-century German proverb, it appeared in an 1870 pamphlet by a disciple of Auguste Blanqui and became the title of Blanqui&#x27;s 1880 newspaper &quot;&quot; before it spread throughout the anarchist movement, appearing in Kropotkin&#x27;s 1885 &quot;Words of a Rebel&quot; and an 1896 Bordeaux anarchist manifesto. Sébastien Faure resuscitated the slogan during World War I, after which Paris&#x27;s Libertarian Youth adopted the name. It has appeared on tombstones of revolutionaries, as the slogan of birth control activist Margaret Sanger&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Woman Rebel&quot;, and as the title of a against capital punishment by Léo Ferré. In the 21st century, it has featured as a slogan for the secularization of Croatia.

<text>The Charminar () is a monument located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana. The Charminar&#x27;s long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr, as it is adjacent to the city&#x27;s main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.

The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi River. To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the southwest the richly ornamented Makkah Masjid. It is listed as an archaeological and architectural treasure on the official list of monuments prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India. The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words &quot;chār&quot; and &quot;minar&quot;, translating to &quot;Four Pillars&quot;; the towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches.

==History==
The fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, built the Charminar in 1591 after shifting his capital from Golconda to the newly formed city of Hyderabad.
The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the current caretaker of the structure, mentions in its records, &quot;There are various theories regarding the purpose for which Charminar was constructed. However, it is widely accepted that Charminar was built at the centre of the city, to commemorate the eradication of plague&quot;, a deadly disease which was widespread at that time. According to Jean de Thévenot, a French traveller of the 17th century whose narration was complemented with the available Persian texts, the Charminar was constructed in the year 1591 CE, to commemorate the beginning of the second Islamic millennium year (1000 AH). The event was celebrated far and wide in the Islamic world, thus Qutb Shah founded the city of Hyderabad to celebrate the event and commemorate it with the construction of this building.

The construction began in 1589 and was completed in two years at a cost of Rs. 9 lakhs, which was around 2 lakh huns/gold coins in those times. It is said to weigh around 14000 tonnes with a minimum of 30 feet deep foundation. In 1670, a minaret had fallen after being struck by lightning. It was then repaired at a cost of around Rs. 58000. In 1820, some part of it was renovated by Sikandar Jah at a cost of Rs. 2 lakh.

The Charminar was constructed at the intersection of the historical trade route that connects the city to international markets through the port city of Machilipatnam. The Old City of Hyderabad was designed with Charminar as its centrepiece. The city was spread around the Charminar in four different quadrants and chambers, segregated according to the established settlements. Towards the north of Charminar is the Char Kaman, or four gateways, constructed in the cardinal direction. Additional eminent architects from Persia were also invited to develop the city plan. The structure itself was intended to serve as a mosque and madrasa. It is of Indo-Islamic architecture style, incorporating Persian architectural elements. A sample of Charminar is said to have been created at Dabirpura/Nagaboli graveyard before the actual construction.
Qutb Shah was also among the early poets of Dakhani Urdu. While laying the foundation of Charminar, he performed the prayers in Dakhini couplets, which are recorded as follows:
=== Mughal rule ===
Charminar was later captured and became an icon of Mughal Empire, the Asaf Jah I was the custodian of the famous structure.

80,000 Sepoy units loyal to the Mughal Empire lived within the &quot;garrison of the Charminar&quot; and often viewed it as a sister of the Taj Mahal.
==Structure==

The Charminar masjid is a square structure with each side being long. Each of the four sides has one of four grand arches, each facing a fundamental point that opens directly onto the street in front of it. At each corner stands an exquisitely shaped high minaret, with a double balcony. Each minaret is crowned by a bulbous dome with dainty, petal-like designs at the base. Unlike the minarets of Taj Mahal, Charminar&#x27;s four fluted minarets are built into the main structure. There are 149 winding steps to reach the upper floor. The structure is also known for its profusion of stucco decorations and the arrangement of balustrades and balconies.

The structure is made of granite, limestone, mortar, and pulverised marble, weighing approximately 14,000 tones apiece. Initially the monument was so proportionately planned that when the fort first opened, one could see all four corners of the bustling city of Hyderabad through each of its four grand arches, as each arch faced one of the most active royal ancestral streets.

A mosque is located at the western end of the open roof. The remaining section of the roof served as a royal court during the Qutb Shahi times. The actual mosque occupies the top floor of the four-storey structure. A vault which appears from inside like a dome supports two galleries within the Charminar, one over another. Above those is a terrace that serves as a roof that is bordered with a stone balcony. The main gallery has 45 covered prayer spaces with a large open space in front to accommodate more people for Friday prayers.

The clock on the four cardinal directions was added in 1889. There is a vazu (water cistern) in the middle with a small fountain for ablution before offering prayer in the Charminar mosque.

==Surrounding area==

The area surrounding Charminar is also known by the same name. It is within the ambit of the Charminar constituency.

===Makkah Masjid===
The monument overlooks another grand mosque called the Makkah Masjid. Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the 5th ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, commissioned bricks to be made from the soil brought from Mecca, the holiest site of Islam, and used them in the construction of the central arch of the mosque, hence its name.

===Bazaars===
A market named Laad Bazaar is around Charminar. It is known for its jewelry, especially bangles. The nearby Pathargatti boulevard is also an important business street known for its pearls. In its heyday, the Charminar market had some 14,000 shops. The Bazaars surrounding Charminar were described in the poem &quot;In the Bazaars of Hyderabad&quot; by Sarojini Naidu.

=== Char Kaman and Gulzar Houz ===

Arches in four directions of Charminar are known as Char Kaman. These were built along with the Charminar in the 16th century. These are the &quot;Kali Kaman&quot;, &quot;Machli Kaman&quot;, &quot;Seher-e-Batil ki Kaman&quot; and &quot;Charminar Kaman&quot;. At the centre of these arches is a fountain called the Gulzar Houz. The Char Kaman are in dire need of restoration, and protection from encroachments.

== Influences ==
In 2007, Hyderabadi Muslims living in Pakistan constructed a small-scaled quasi replica of the Charminar at the main crossing of the Bahadurabad neighbourhood in Karachi.

Lindt chocolatier Adelbert Boucher created a scaled model of the Charminar out of 50 kilograms of chocolate. The model, which required three days&#x27; labour, was on display at The Westin, Hyderabad, India on 25 and 26 September 2010.

The Charminar Express is an express train named after the Charminar, which runs between Hyderabad and Chennai.The Charminar also appears on coins and banknotes of the defunct Hyderabadi Rupee, the currency of the erstwhile Hyderabad State.

As an icon of the city of Hyderabad as well as the Telangana State, the structure also appears on the Emblem of Telangana, along with the Kakatiya Kala Thoranam.

==Charminar Pedestrianisation Project (CPP)==
The Charminar Pedestrianisation Project is an initiative aimed at transforming the area around the iconic Charminar monument in Hyderabad, India into a pedestrian-friendly zone. The project was proposed by the government of Telangana in 2016 and is part of a larger effort to improve the city&#x27;s urban infrastructure. The Charminar is a historic monument that attracts millions of visitors each year, but the surrounding area is congested with traffic and is not conducive to walking. The Pedestrianisation Project seeks to address this issue by creating a car-free zone around the monument and improving the overall pedestrian experience.

The project involves the construction of wider sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, and improved lighting, as well as the installation of street furniture and landscaping to create a more attractive and welcoming environment for visitors. The plan also includes the development of a dedicated parking area for visitors to the Charminar, which will be located outside the pedestrian zone.

The project has been met with some controversy, as it involves the relocation of several street vendors and businesses that currently operate in the area. However, proponents of the project argue that the benefits of creating a more pedestrian-friendly environment around the Charminar will outweigh any short-term disruptions.

Overall, the Charminar Pedestrianisation Project represents an important effort to improve the urban infrastructure of Hyderabad and create a more attractive and accessible environment for visitors to one of the city&#x27;s most iconic landmarks. Later during January 2017, the new Government of Telangana introduced a 14-member French Delegation to take over the project to assess the feasibility in developing the monument as an eco-friendly tourism and heritage destination. The team has inspected surrounding areas such as the Gulzar house, Makkah Masjid, Lad Bazar, and Sardar Mahal.

==UNESCO World Heritage Site tentative list==
Charminar, along with the Qutb Shahi Monuments of Hyderabad: the Golconda Fort, and the Qutb Shahi Tombs, were included in the &quot;tentative list&quot; of UNESCO World Heritage Site. The monument was submitted by the Permanent Delegation of India to UNESCO on September 10, 2010.

== Illegal temple structure ==

An illegal temple by the name of Bhagyalakshmi Temple sprouted up at the base of Charminar in the 1960s. The Archaeological Survey of India—which manages the Charminar—has declared the temple structure as an unauthorised construction. The Hyderabad High Court has stopped any further expansion of the temple. While the origin of the temple is currently disputed, the current structure that houses the idol was erected in the 1960s. In 2012, &quot;The Hindu&quot; newspaper published an old photograph showing that the temple structure never existed. The Hindu also released a note asserting the authenticity of the photographs, and clearly stated that there was no temple structure in photos taken in 1957 and 1962. Additionally, it showed photos that provide evidence that the temple is a recent addition: a temple structure can be seen in photos taken in 1990 and 1994. Also, a temple is seen in a photograph taken in 1986, which is kept in the Aga Khan Visual Archive, MIT Libraries&#x27; collections, United States, but not in the earlier ones.

<text>In economics, hyperbolic discounting is a time-&quot;inconsistent&quot; model of delay discounting. It is one of the cornerstones of behavioral economics and its brain-basis is actively being studied by neuroeconomics researchers.

According to the discounted utility approach, intertemporal choices are no different from other choices, except that some consequences are delayed and hence must be anticipated and discounted (i.e., reweighted to take into account the delay).

Given two similar rewards, humans show a preference for one that arrives in a more prompt timeframe. Humans are said to &quot;discount&quot; the value of the later reward, by a factor that increases with the length of the delay. In the financial world, this process is normally modeled in the form of exponential discounting, a time-&quot;consistent&quot; model of discounting. Many psychological studies have since demonstrated deviations in instinctive preference from the constant discount rate assumed in exponential discounting. Hyperbolic discounting is an alternative mathematical model that agrees more closely with these findings.

According to hyperbolic discounting, valuations fall relatively rapidly for earlier delay periods (as in, from now to one week), but then fall more slowly for longer delay periods (for instance, more than a few days). For example, in an early study subjects said they would be indifferent between receiving $15 immediately or $30 after 3 months, $60 after 1 year, or $100 after 3 years. These indifferences reflect annual discount rates that declined from 277% to 139% to 63% as delays got longer. This contrasts with exponential discounting, in which valuation falls by a constant factor per unit delay and the discount rate stays the same.

The standard experiment used to reveal a test subject&#x27;s hyperbolic discounting curve is to compare short-term preferences with long-term preferences. For instance: &quot;Would you prefer a dollar today or three dollars tomorrow?&quot; or &quot;Would you prefer a dollar in one year or three dollars in one year and one day?&quot; It has been claimed that a significant fraction of subjects will take the lesser amount today, but will gladly wait one extra day in a year in order to receive the higher amount instead. Individuals with such preferences are described as &quot;present-biased&quot;.

The most important consequence of hyperbolic discounting is that it creates temporary preferences for small rewards that occur sooner over larger, later ones. Individuals using hyperbolic discounting reveal a strong tendency to make choices that are inconsistent over time – they make choices today that their future self would prefer not to have made, despite knowing the same information. This dynamic inconsistency happens because hyperbolas distort the relative value of options with a fixed difference in delays in proportion to how far the choice-maker is from those options.

==Observations==
The phenomenon of hyperbolic discounting is implicit in Richard Herrnstein&#x27;s &quot;matching law&quot;, which states that when dividing their time or effort between two non-exclusive, ongoing sources of reward, most subjects allocate in direct proportion to the rate and size of rewards from the two sources, and in inverse proportion to their delays. That is, subjects&#x27; choices &quot;match&quot; these parameters.

After the report of this effect in the case of delay, George Ainslie pointed out that in a single choice between a larger, later and a smaller, sooner reward, inverse proportionality to delay would be described by a plot of value by delay that had a hyperbolic shape, and that when the smaller, sooner reward is preferred, this preference can be reversed by increasing both rewards&#x27; delays by the same absolute amount. Ainslie&#x27;s research showed that a substantial number of subjects reported that they would prefer $50 immediately rather than $100 in six months, but would NOT prefer $50 in 3 months rather than $100 in nine months, even though this was the same choice seen at 3 months&#x27; greater distance. More significantly, those subjects who said they preferred $50 in 3 months to $100 in 9 months said they would NOT prefer $50 in 12 months to $100 in 18 months—again, the same pair of options at a different distance—showing that the preference-reversal effect did not depend on the excitement of getting an immediate reward. Nor does it depend on human culture; the first preference reversal findings were in rats and pigeons.

Many subsequent experiments have confirmed that spontaneous preferences by both human and nonhuman subjects follow a hyperbolic curve rather than the conventional, exponential curve that would produce consistent choice over time. For instance, when offered the choice between $50 now and $100 a year from now, many people will choose the immediate $50. However, given the choice between $50 in five years or $100 in six years almost everyone will choose $100 in six years, even though that is the same choice seen at five years&#x27; greater distance.

Hyperbolic discounting has also been found to relate to real-world examples of self-control. Indeed, a variety of studies have used measures of hyperbolic discounting to find that drug-dependent individuals discount delayed consequences more than matched nondependent controls, suggesting that extreme delay discounting is a fundamental behavioral process in drug dependence. Some evidence suggests pathological gamblers also discount delayed outcomes at higher rates than matched controls. Whether high rates of hyperbolic discounting precede addictions or vice versa is currently unknown, although some studies have reported that high-rate discounters are more likely to consume alcohol and cocaine than lower-rate discounters. Likewise, some have suggested that high-rate hyperbolic discounting makes unpredictable (gambling) outcomes more satisfying.

The degree of discounting is vitally important in describing hyperbolic discounting, especially in the discounting of specific rewards such as money. The discounting of monetary rewards varies across age groups due to the varying discount rate. The rate depends on a variety of factors, including the species being observed, age, experience, and the amount of time needed to consume the reward.

==Mathematical model==
===Step-by-step explanation===

Suppose that in a study, participants are offered the choice between taking dollars immediately or taking dollars days later. Suppose further that one participant in that study employs exponential discounting and another employs hyperbolic discounting. Both participants know that they can invest the money they receive today in a savings plan that gives them an interest of . Both of them realize that they should take dollars immediately if the future value of the savings plan will yield more than dollars days later. Each participant correctly understands the fundamental question being asked: &quot;For any given value of dollars and days, what is the minimum amount of dollars, that I should be willing to accept? In other words, how many dollars would I need to invest today to get dollars days from now?&quot; Each will take dollars if is greater than the answer that they calculate, and each will take dollars days from now if is smaller than that answer. However, the methods that they use to calculate that amount and the answers that they get will be different, and only the exponential discounter will use the correct method and get a reliably correct result:

* The exponential discounter thinks &quot;The savings plan adds to its value, in each day, percent of the value that it had the previous day. So every day it multiplies its value once by . So if I hold the investment for days, its value will have multiplied itself by this amount times, making that value of what it was at the start – that is, times what it was at the start. So to figure out how much I would need to start with today to get dollars days from now, I need to divide dollars by .&quot;
* The hyperbolic discounter, however, thinks &quot;The savings plan adds to its value, in each day, percent. Therefore, after days, it adds to its value percent [There lies the hyperbolic discounter&#x27;s error]. So to figure out how much I would need to start with today to get dollars days from now, I need to divide dollars by .&quot;

As becomes very large, the value of becomes much larger than the value of , with the effect that the value of formula_1 becomes much smaller than the value of formula_2 Therefore, the minimum value of (the number of dollars in the immediate choice) that suffices to be greater than that amount will be much smaller than the hyperbolic discounter thinks, with the result that they will perceive -values in the range from formula_1 to formula_4 inclusive as being too small and, as a result, irrationally turn those alternatives down when they are in fact the better investment.

===Formal model===

Hyperbolic discounting is mathematically described as
formula_5

where is the discount factor that multiplies the value of the reward, is the delay in the reward, and is a parameter governing the degree of discounting (for example, the interest rate). This is compared with the formula for exponential discounting:
formula_6

====Comparison====

Consider formula_7 an exponential discounting function with formula_8 and formula_9 a hyperbolic function with formula_10, and suppose both use units of weeks to measure , the delay. Then the exponential discounting a week from &quot;now&quot; () is 
formula_11
and the exponential discounting from weeks of delay to weeks is 
formula_12
so the incremental discount associated with an additional week of delay is the same. For the hyperbolic model using , the discount for a week from now is 
formula_13
which is the same as for in the exponential model, while the incremental discount for an additional week after a delay of weeks is not the same: 
formula_14
From this one can see that the two models of discounting are the same &quot;now&quot;; this is the reason for the choice of interest rate parameters . However, when is much greater than 1, 
formula_15 
so that the hyperbolic discounting of an additional week after a long delay is almost no discount at all, while the exponential discount factor is still 1/2, so there is still substantial discounting in the far future. Hyperbolic discounting places very little discount on an additional week of delay beyond an already large delay, while exponential discounting places a constant discount on every week of delay, whether it is far in the future or the next week.

===Quasi-hyperbolic approximation===
The &quot;quasi-hyperbolic&quot; discount function (sometimes called &quot;beta-delta discounting&quot;), proposed by Laibson (1997), approximates the hyperbolic discount function above in discrete time by

formula_16

where and are constants between 0 and 1; and is the delay in the reward, but now it takes only integer values. The condition states that rewards taken at the present time are not discounted.

Quasi-hyperbolic discounting retain much of the analytical tractability of exponential discounting while capturing the key qualitative feature of hyperbolic discounting.

==Explanations==

===Uncertain risks===
Whether discounting future gains is rational or not—and at what rate such gains should be discounted—depends greatly on circumstances. Many examples exist in the financial world, for example, where it is reasonable to assume that there is an implicit risk that the reward will not be available at the future date, and furthermore that this risk increases with time. Consider paying $50 for dinner today or delaying payment for sixty years but paying $100,000. In this case, the restaurateur would be reasonable to discount the promised future value as there is significant risk that it might not be paid (e.g. due to the death of the restaurateur or the diner).

Uncertainty of this type can be quantified with Bayesian analysis. For example, suppose that the probability for the reward to be available after time &quot;t&quot; is, for known hazard rate λ,
:formula_17

but the rate is unknown to the decision maker. If the prior probability distribution of λ is
:formula_18

then the decision maker will expect that the probability of the reward after time &quot;t&quot; is
:formula_19

which is exactly the hyperbolic discount rate. Similar conclusions can be obtained from other plausible distributions for λ.

==Applications==
More recently these observations about discount functions have been used to study saving for retirement, personal income to drug addiction., borrowing on credit cards, and procrastination. 
It has frequently been used to explain addiction.
Hyperbolic discounting has also been offered as an explanation of the divergence between privacy attitudes and behaviour.

==Present values of annuities==
===Present value of a standard annuity===

The present value of a series of equal annual cash flows in arrears discounted hyperbolically is

:formula_20

where &quot;V&quot; is the present value, &quot;P&quot; is the annual cash flow, &quot;D&quot; is the number of annual payments and &quot;k&quot; is the factor governing the discounting.

==Criticism==
Several alternative explanations of non-exponential discounting have been proposed. An article from 2003 noted that this pattern might be better explained by a similarity heuristic than by hyperbolic discounting. Subjects have also reported changing relative preferences as they see more details of what they are choosing—a “temporal construal” effect.

A study by Daniel Read introduces &quot;subadditive discounting&quot;: the fact that discounting over a delay increases if the delay is divided into smaller intervals. This hypothesis may explain the main finding of many studies in support of hyperbolic discounting—the observation that impatience declines with time–while also accounting for observations not predicted by hyperbolic discounting. However, although these observations depart from exponential discounting, they do not entail preference reversal as time from the choice to the earlier reward increases.

Arousal of appetite or emotion does sometimes lead to preference reversal, and this has been the most widely accepted alternative to a simply hyperbolic function: hyperboloid or quasi-hyperbolic discounting fuses exponential curves with an arousal bump as a visceral reward becomes imminent. Such cases are obviously important, but still do not account for cases where either both or neither choice is made during arousal.

The most obvious objection to hyperbolic discounting is that many or most people learn to choose consistently over time in most situations. Similarly, a 2014 paper criticized the existing studies for mostly using data collected from university students and being too quick to conclude that the hyperbolic model of discounting is correct. Human experiments have frequently reported wide between-subject variations. If overcoming the tendency to temporary preference takes learning, the next obvious task for experimenters is to test theories of how and when this learning occurs (e.g. Ainslie, 2012).

<text>Kaʻula Island, also called Kaʻula Rock, is a small, crescent-shaped island in the Hawaiian Islands.

==Mythology==
In the legend of Papa and Wākea, Kaula is the seventh-born child.

==Geography==
It is located west-southwest of Kawaihoa Point on Niihau, and about west of Honolulu. The island is the top of a volcanic tuff cone that rests on top of a larger, submerged shield volcano. At its highest point, the island reaches a height of . The ocean has carved large sea cliffs on the sides of the island. There is a large cave on the northwest side of the island called Kahalauaola (Shark Cave).

The United States Census Bureau defines Kaula as Census Tract 411 of Kauai County, Hawaii. The 2000 census showed that the uninhabited island had a land area of . Because of erosion, the island is slowly shrinking.

Kaʻula, which he spelled as &quot;Tahoora&quot;, was one of the first five islands sighted by Captain James Cook in 1778.

==Lighthouse==
A lighthouse was completed on the island in 1932 by the United States Lighthouse Service, which became part of the United States Coast Guard in 1939. The lighthouse remained in operation through 1947.

==Military use==
The island has been used as a bombing range by the United States Navy since at least 1952. Inert ordnance is currently used, although live explosive ordnance has been used in the past. There is a risk of unexploded ordnance on the island. Permission from the U.S. Navy is required to land on the island. In 1978, over the objection of the U.S. Navy, the state of Hawaii claimed ownership of Kaula and named the island a State Seabird Sanctuary. A final determination of ownership has not yet been made, and the Navy still uses the southeast point of the island as an aerial bombing and strafing
target.

==Diving==

Kaula is uninhabited, but fishermen and scuba divers frequently visit the island. Five Fathom Pinnacle, west-northwest of Kaula, is also a noted dive spot.

<text>The Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art, commonly known as The Kubert School or Joe Kubert School, is a private for-profit art school focused on cartooning and located in Dover, New Jersey. It teaches the principles of sequential art and the particular craft of the comics industry as well as commercial illustration. It is the only accredited school devoted entirely to cartooning.

The school&#x27;s instructors are full-time professionals working in the industry, many of them graduates of the school themselves, and the instruction is hands-on and practical. The school has a reputation for demanding and intensive coursework. Its alumni include Amanda Conner, Lee Weeks, Andy Price, Ed Piskor, and Alex Maleev, as well as many other comics pencilers and inkers.

== History ==
The Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art was founded in September 1976 by cartoonist Joe Kubert and his wife Muriel in the old Baker mansion on 45 Lehigh Street in Dover; then, from 1984 onwards, Dover&#x27;s former high school, whose tall windows offered optimal lighting. Its first graduating class of 1978 included Stephen R. Bissette, Thomas Yeates, and Rick Veitch.

By 1984, the school offered a three-year program in Cartoon Illustration, Graphic Arts, and Cinematic Animation, accredited by the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools. Approved by the New Jersey Department of Education, the Kubert School advertised itself to veterans and &quot;non-resident alien&quot; students.

In 1993, Dark Horse Comics announced it would begin funding the &quot;Jack Kirby Scholarship&quot; at the school.

Founder and teacher Kubert kept his own studio in the school, later joined by his sons Adam and Andy, who are also comic book professionals and who teach at the school. (In addition to The Kubert School, in the late 1990s, Joe Kubert was offering &quot;Joe Kubert&#x27;s World of Cartooning&quot; correspondence courses to prospective students.)

In the fall of 2019, former student Anthony Marques purchased the school with $2.4 million in combined 7(a) term and 7(a) Express loans through TD Bank&#x27;s Small Business Administration (SBA) Lending Group.

In January of 2025, the school announced that it would be moving from Dover to a new location in Madison, New Jersey. 

==Campus and student body==

There are usually no more than 150 students attending the school at any time. As well as regular weekday classes, the school also holds a weekly class every Saturday, which is available for people who are not enrolled in the main program. The class is on basic lessons in cartooning, and is taught by various alumni.

== Criticism ==
A 2003 article in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; criticized the school for turning out &quot;hack&quot; artists with no individual character. Similarly, Kubert alum Ed Piskor (who only attended the school for one year) criticized the school for its hackneyed approach and outmoded techniques.

<doc id="903383" wikidata="Q486588" url="?curid=903383" title="Shrek the Third">
<text>Shrek the Third (also known as Shrek 3) is a 2007 American animated fantasy comedy film loosely based on the 1990 children&#x27;s picture book &quot;Shrek!&quot; by William Steig. Directed by Chris Miller and co-directed by Raman Hui from a screenplay by Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman, Miller, and producer Aron Warner, and a story conceived by Andrew Adamson, co-director of the previous two installments, it is the sequel to &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004) and the third installment in the &quot;Shrek&quot; film series. The film features Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews, and John Cleese reprising their voice roles from the previous films, along with new additions Justin Timberlake as Arthur Pendragon and Eric Idle as Merlin. In the film, Prince Charming is plotting to overthrow Shrek and Fiona, who have inherited the throne following King Harold&#x27;s death. Shrek has no interest in ruling the kingdom and attempts to convince Fiona&#x27;s underachieving 16-year-old cousin Artie to reign instead.

&quot;Shrek the Third&quot; premiered at the Mann Village Theatre, Westwood in Los Angeles on May 6, 2007, and was theatrically released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on May 18, 2007. Despite mixed reviews, the film was a commercial success, grossing $813 million worldwide on a budget of $160 million, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2007. It was nominated for the Best Animated Film at the 61st British Academy Film Awards. The sequel, &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot;, was released on May 21, 2010.

==Plot==
Shrek and Princess Fiona are to succeed King Harold, but Shrek&#x27;s attempts to serve as the Regent during Harold&#x27;s medical absence end in disaster, since he has no interest in being king of Far Far Away. With his dying breath, Harold tells Shrek of another heir: his nephew and Fiona&#x27;s cousin, Arthur &quot;Artie&quot; Pendragon. Meanwhile, Prince Charming, vowing to avenge the death of his mother, the Fairy Godmother, and become king, goes to the Poison Apple tavern and persuades the fairy tale villains to fight for their &quot;happily ever after&quot;, and help him take over Far Far Away.

Shrek and his friends, Donkey, and Puss in Boots set out to retrieve Artie. As they sail away, Fiona reveals to Shrek that she is pregnant, much to Shrek&#x27;s horror, because he believes he is incapable of raising children. The trio journey to Worcestershire Academy, an elite magical boarding school, where they discover Artie is a scrawny, 16-year-old outcast. At the school pep rally, Shrek tells Artie he has been chosen to be king of Far Far Away. Artie is excited until Donkey and Puss inadvertently frighten him by discussing the king&#x27;s responsibilities. Losing confidence, Artie tries to take control of the ship and steer it back to Worcestershire. Following a scuffle with Shrek, the ship crashes on a remote island where they encounter Artie&#x27;s retired magic teacher, Merlin, who convinces the two to open up to each other.

Fiona and Queen Lillian host a baby shower when Charming and the villains attack the castle. Gingy, Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf, and the Three Little Pigs stall Charming&#x27;s group long enough for the ladies to escape. When one of the pigs accidentally reveals that Shrek has gone to retrieve Artie, Charming sends Captain Hook and his pirates to track them down. Rapunzel, having fallen in love with Charming, betrays Fiona, and the ladies are locked in the castle dungeons.

Captain Hook and his pirates catch up to Shrek on Merlin&#x27;s island. Shrek avoids capture, and Hook reveals Charming&#x27;s takeover of Far Far Away. Shrek urges Artie to return to Worcestershire, but Artie cons Merlin into using his magic to send them to Far Far Away, and while the spell works, it accidentally causes Puss and Donkey to switch bodies. They find Pinocchio and learn that Charming plans to kill Shrek as part of a play. After breaking into the castle, they are caught and taken captive.

Charming prepares to kill Artie to retain the crown. To save Artie&#x27;s life, Shrek lies, claiming that he was just using Artie to replace him as the next king. Charming believes Shrek and allows a disheartened Artie to leave. Donkey and Puss are imprisoned with Fiona, Lillian and the other princesses, where Fiona grows frustrated with their lack of initiative. Lillian smashes an opening in the stone wall of the prison with a headbutt. While the princesses launch a rescue mission for Shrek, Donkey and Puss free Gingy, Pinocchio, and the others along with Dragon and Donkey&#x27;s children. Puss and Donkey convince a leaving Artie that Shrek lied to save his life.

Charming stages a showdown in a musical theater in front of the kingdom. Just as Charming is about to kill Shrek, Fiona, Puss, and Donkey, the princesses and other fairy tale characters confront the villains but are quickly subdued. Artie shows up and gives a speech to the villains, convincing them that they can be accepted into society instead of being outcasts. Inspired by Artie&#x27;s speech, the villains agree to give up their evil ways, while Charming refuses to listen and lunges at Artie with his sword. Shrek blocks the blow, and it appears that he has been stabbed. Charming decrees himself the new king, but Shrek reveals that the former misaimed his sword and pushes Charming aside, while Dragon knocks the stage tower down onto Charming, killing him instantly.

With Charming gone, Artie is crowned the new king of Far Far Away. While the kingdom celebrates, Merlin appears and reverts Puss and Donkey&#x27;s body swap. Later, back at the swamp, Shrek and Fiona begin raising their new triplets, coping with parenthood with help from Donkey, Puss, Lillian, and Dragon.

== Production ==
After the success of &quot;Shrek 2&quot; in May 2004, DreamWorks Animation (DWA) CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg planned a five-film arc that began with &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001) and would conclude with a fifth installment. DreamWorks hired screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot; and &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; fame) to write the screenplay of the film and Jon Zack, who wrote &quot;The Perfect Score&quot;, came on board as a consultant. Unlike the first two films, the film was not directed by Andrew Adamson due to his occupation with &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. Adamson was still involved as an executive producer, and was giving advice approximately every four months on the state of the film. &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; was instead directed by Chris Miller, a story artist on the first film and a head of story on the second, and co-directed by Raman Hui, a supervising animator on the first two films, with Miller and producer Aron Warner also writing the script with Price and Seaman.

The film was developed under the working title of &quot;Shrek 3&quot;. By March 2006, the title of the film was changed to &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;. According to Miller, the reason behind the title change was because they &quot;didn&#x27;t want to just sort of title it like it was just a sequel,&quot; instead they wanted &quot;something to make it stand on its own, give it its own personality and really try to treat it as a chapter in Shrek&#x27;s life.&quot; Hui also remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s about Shrek becoming the new king of Far Far Away; the title sounds kind of royal as well.&quot;

The film was originally going to be released in November 2006; however, in December 2004, the date was changed to May 2007; &quot;The sheer magnitude of the &quot;Shrek&quot; franchise has led us to conclude that a May release date, with a DVD release around the holiday season, will enable us to best maximize performance and increase profitability, thereby generating enhanced asset value and better returns for our shareholders.&quot; Katzenberg explained. &quot;Flushed Away&quot;, another film from DreamWorks Animation, was instead given the slot of November 2006. The release date change was also the day after Disney/Pixar changed the release date of &quot;Cars&quot;, from November 4, 2005 to June 9, 2006.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Shrek the Third&quot; opened in 4,122 North American cinemas on May 18, 2007, grossing $38 million on its first day, which was the biggest opening day for an animated film at the time. It grossed a total of $121.6 million in its first weekend, the best opening weekend ever for an animated film, and the second-highest opening for a film in the United States in 2007, behind &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. It held the animated opening weekend record for nine years until it was surpassed by &quot;Finding Dory&quot;″s $135.1 million debut in 2016. At the time, its opening weekend was the third-highest of all time in these regions.

&quot;Shrek the Third&quot; grossed $322.7 million in the United States, and $490.7 million overseas, bringing its cumulative total to $813.4 million. The film was the fourth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 2007, and the second-highest-grossing film in the United States that year. In addition, it was the highest-grossing animated film of 2007, and the third-highest-grossing animated film ever, trailing only behind &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. The film sold an estimated 46,907,000 tickets in North America.

The film was released in the United Kingdom on June 29, 2007, and topped the country&#x27;s box office for the next two weekends, before being dethroned by &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Shrek the Third&quot; received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of , making it the lowest-rated film in the &quot;Shrek&quot; franchise by the website to date. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Shrek the Third&quot; has pop culture potshots galore, but at the expense of the heart, charm, and wit that made the first two &quot;Shreks&quot; classics.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale, a step down from the first two films&#x27; &quot;A&quot;.

Some critics were confused as to the film&#x27;s target demographic. Carina Chocano of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt themes about career and parenting anxieties, the lifestyle of celebrities, as well as its humor, would be above children: &quot;Does a kids&#x27; movie really need, among other similar touches, a Hooters joke? I, for one, wouldn&#x27;t want to have to explain it.&quot; Nonetheless, she also found certain moments to be funny: &quot;Shrek&#x27;s anxiety dream about procreating is fabulously surreal, and King Harold&#x27;s deathbed scene, with its grimaces and false alarms, is pure kiddie comedy at its best.&quot; David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s &quot;slightly snarky wit is aimed almost entirely at parents... this one never touched my heart or got under my skin. It&#x27;s a movie at war with itself: a kiddie movie that doesn&#x27;t really want to be one.&quot;

Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, saying the film &quot;wasn&#x27;t awful, but it&#x27;s bland, with a barrel-scraping averageness. There are no new ideas, no very funny new characters...&quot; He called the character Merlin a &quot;frankly unfunny new character&quot; and considered the character to be a &quot;rip-off of Albus Dumbledore from the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise&quot;. He stated that the film contained &quot;no decent musical numbers, incidentally, and the one cover version is bizarrely chosen. For Harold&#x27;s funeral, we get a rendering of ... Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. Er ... huh? Because it&#x27;s kind of sad and it has &quot;die&quot; in the title?&quot;

&quot;The Times&quot; of London rated it 2 out of 5.

A. O. Scott from &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;at once more energetic and more relaxed [than its predecessors], less desperate to prove its cleverness and therefore to some extent, smarter.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
==Soundtrack==
==Home media==
The film was released on both DVD and HD DVD on November 13, 2007. The DVD was released in separate pan and scan and widescreen formats. The film and special features on the HD DVD version were presented in 1.78:1 widescreen high-definition 1080p and feature a Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 audio soundtrack, and special features for both formats include several deleted scenes, features, trailers, commentary, music videos, and exclusively on the HD DVD version, some web-enabled and HDi Interactive Format features such as a special trivia track, a film guide, and an interactive coloring book which can be downloaded as of street date.

Following Paramount&#x27;s decision to discontinue HD DVD production (making &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; the only DreamWorks Animation film to be released on that format), the film was subsequently released on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2008. It was re-released on Blu-ray as part of the &quot;Shrek&quot;: The Whole Story boxset on December 7, 2010 before receiving another separate release on August 30, 2011, and on Blu-ray 3D on November 1, 2011 as a Best Buy exclusive. &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on September 12, 2023, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.

DVD and Blu-ray sales gathered revenue of $179.1 million.

==Marketing==

&quot;Shrek the Third&quot; was widely anticipated and DreamWorks backed the film with a large marketing campaign, with toys, books, games, clothes, and many other items becoming available throughout 2007. A video game based on the film was released for the Wii, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation Portable, PC, and Nintendo DS.

In May 2007, &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; was made into a mobile video game, developed by Gameloft. Shrek n&#x27; Roll, an action puzzle game based on the film, was released for the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade on November 14, 2007.
A pinball machine based on the film has also been produced by Stern Pinball.

===Satirical marketing effort===
Adult Swim comedy team Tim and Eric, annoyed by the amount of advertisement they had witnessed in the months approaching the release of the film, decided to independently &quot;promote&quot; &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; in a series of internet videos
as well as appearances on television and radio to encourage people to see the film.

==Controversy==
In the beginning of the film, in Prince Charming&#x27;s dinner theater, coconuts are revealed to be the source of the sound effect for horses&#x27; hoof beats. This same joke was used in &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, which also starred John Cleese and Eric Idle. Idle walked out of the premiere (though later reentered after calming himself down) and claimed to be considering suing the producers of &quot;Shrek&quot; for the unauthorized use of this gag, while the producers claim they were honoring Idle and Cleese by putting the part in.

==Sequels==
The film was followed by a sequel, &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot;, which was released in theaters on May 21, 2010, and will be followed by &quot;Shrek 5&quot;, which is in development and set for December 23, 2026.

==Notes==

# In July 2014, the film&#x27;s distribution rights were purchased by DreamWorks Animation from Paramount Pictures and transferred to 20th Century Fox before reverting to Universal Studios in 2018.

<text>U.S. Route 280 (US 280) is a spur of U.S. Highway 80. It currently runs for 392 miles (631 km) from Blitchton, Georgia, at US 80 to Birmingham, Alabama at I-20/I-59. For much of its route, US 280 travels through rural areas and smaller cities in southern Georgia and east central Alabama. Once the highway approaches Birmingham, it is a major suburban route. Numerous shopping centers are located on US 280 throughout northern Shelby County and southern Jefferson County.

US 280 is the main connector between Birmingham, AL and Auburn, AL, and this stretch is sometimes known as the “War Eagle Highway.“

Through Talladega County, Alabama, US 280 is known as the Jim Nabors Highway, in honor of the Sylacauga, Alabama, native known for portraying the television character Gomer Pyle. The historical designation of US-280 and Alabama SR 38 is the Florida Short Route.

For many years, US 280 and SR 38 was considered one of the more dangerous routes in Alabama, due to the number of large stretches of narrow two-lane roadway leading southeastwardly from Birmingham. Work was completed in 2006 making US 280 a four-lane highway throughout the entire state of Alabama. This project began in the 1970s. As a result, US 280 now bypasses numerous small towns in east Alabama, including Goodwater, Jackson&#x27;s Gap, Camp Hill and Waverly.

In Georgia, US 280 from Columbus to I-16 is also a Governor&#x27;s Road Improvement Program (GRIP) corridor known as &quot;Power Alley&quot;.

==Route description==
===Alabama===
US 280 terminates concurrently with U.S. 31 at I-20/I-59. US 31 continues onward at this point. The route continues through downtown Birmingham with US 31. They junction with US 11 and US 78 and climb over Red Mountain into Mtn. Brook as a section of highway called the Red Mountain Expressway. Here, US 280 splits off of US 31 at a highly complex interchange with elements of a Directional-T and a Parclo.

It continues on somewhat of a freeway through Mtn. Brook, eventually reaching The Summit, a huge outdoor mall. It also junctions with I-459 at this point, at a Parclo-like interchange which is being modified to better suit traffic.

The route continues through one of the more developed areas of east Birmingham and eventually climbs over Double Oak Mountain into Shelby County and Chelsea. It continues east to Harpersville, which is home to its junction with US 231 north and SR 25. US 280 continues with US 231 until it reaches the Coosa River, which it crosses into Talladega County. It eventually reaches Sylacauga, which is home to its junction with US 231 south and SR 21. This specific junction is a diamond interchange, commonly used on freeways.

The route continues south-east through northern Coosa County until it has another diamond interchange with SR 9. It then passes through Kellyton, which is home to its minor junction with SR 115.

It crosses into Tallapoosa County just before entering Alexander City, which is home to Russell Athletic. US 280 junctions with SR 22 and SR 63 in the city. It then proceeds through slightly hilly terrain to Dadeville. It junctions with SR 49, which connects the route to the Talladega National Forest/Cheaha State Park. It leaves Dadeville, promptly enters Camp Hill, junctions with SR 50, and enters the southwestern corner of Chambers County, and then crosses into Lee County.

The route then reaches The Bottle, which is named for the bright orange wooden replica of a Nehi soda bottle which stood in the location from 1924 to 1936.  It crosses into Auburn, which is barely skimmed by US 280 as it then crosses into nearby Opelika. The route junctions with US 29/I-85. It joins the freeway with them and continues through I-85&#x27;s junction with SR 51. It then splits off of the road with US 431. It continues on a heavily traveled road into Russell County, and eventually to Phenix City, which is actually in the Eastern Time Zone due to its close proximity with Columbus, Georgia across the Chattahoochee River. It junctions with US 80. The route then leaves US 431 behind and crosses the Chattahoochee River, leaving Alabama and entering Georgia in Columbus. US 280 has a length of in Alabama.

US 280 has the unsigned designation of State Route 38 (SR 38) throughout its length in Alabama.

===Georgia===

US 280 begins in Georgia at the state&#x27;s border with Alabama in Columbus. There it is paired with State Route 520 and U.S. Route 27. It maintains this designation as it passes through Fort Moore. Upon arriving in Cusseta, US 280/GA 520 diverge from US 27 and continue southeast to Richland, where US 280 splits off from GA 520. From here, US 280 continues on its own east, passing through Plains (the boyhood home of Jimmy Carter) and becomes cosigned with State Route 30 in Americus. US 280/SR 30 then continue east-southeast, crossing I-75 in Cordele, still continuing east through mainly rural areas of the southern portion of the state, passing through smaller towns such as McRae–Helena, Mount Vernon, Vidalia, and Pembroke. The highway then turns to the northeast as it leaves Pembroke, crossing I-16 at exit 143. Still continuing northeast, the highway then terminates in Blichton at U.S. Route 80.

===National Highway System===
Except for the easternmost portion between I-16 and the eastern terminus, the entire length of US 280 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation&#x27;s economy, mobility, and defense.

==History==
Prior to the completion of the Elton B. Stephens Expressway in Birmingham, US 31, US 78, and US 280 traveled concurrently until they intersected US 11 at the intersection of 1st Avenue North and 24th Street.

<text>Social Text is a peer-reviewed academic journal published by Duke University Press. Since its inception by an independent editorial collective in 1979, &quot;Social Text&quot; has addressed a wide range of social and cultural phenomena, covering questions of gender, sexuality, race, and the environment. Each issue covers subjects in the debates around feminism, Marxism, neoliberalism, postcolonialism, postmodernism, queer theory, and popular culture. The journal has since been run by different collectives over the years, mostly based at New York City universities. It has maintained an avowedly progressive political orientation and scholarship over these years, if also a less Marxist one. Since 1992, it is published by Duke University Press.

The journal gained notoriety in 1996 for the Sokal affair, when it published a nonsensical article that physicist Alan Sokal had deliberately written as a hoax. The editorial board, according to Editor Andrew Ross, published the article as a good faith attempt by Sokal, a well-known physicist, to develop a social theory of his field. Ross claims that the editorial board asked Sokal to revise and resubmit his article, but Sokal refused, and so the editors decided to publish the paper as a prominent physicist’s best attempt to develop theory. 

The editors of the journal were awarded the 1996 Ig Nobel Prize for literature by &quot;eagerly publishing research that they could not understand, that the author said was meaningless, and which claimed that reality does not exist&quot;. The journal did not practice academic peer review, and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist. The Sokal article has never been retracted by the journal.

<text>U.S. Route 283 is a spur of U.S. Route 83. It currently runs for 731 miles (1,175 km) from Brady, Texas at U.S. Route 87 to Lexington, Nebraska at U.S. Route 30. It passes through the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska.

==Route description==

===Texas===


===Oklahoma===
US-283 enters Oklahoma from Texas in rural Jackson County at a crossing of the Red River. It runs concurrently with State Highway 5 for several miles past Elmer and continues north to Altus, the largest Oklahoma town on the route. At the intersection of U.S. Highway 62 in Altus, SH-5 splits off and 283 joins with State Highway 6 for the next before it takes a western bend to the town of Mangum. The route continues northwesterly until it crosses I-40 at Sayre.

Through northwestern Oklahoma, US-283 passes through very sparsely populated areas and is the main north–south traffic corridor. After passing through Cheyenne, 283 meanders through Black Kettle National Grassland then crosses the Canadian River. It continues north to Arnett where it joins with State Highway 51 west for then turns north again passing through Shattuck and Laverne following part of State Highway 15 along the way. North of Laverne, 283 turns west for to visit the town of Rosston then turns north again to cross the Cimarron River shortly before leaving the state for Kansas.

Some points of interest along US-283 in Oklahoma include the Museum of the Western Prairie in Altus; the Old Greer County Museum in Mangum; Black Kettle National Grassland and the Washita Battlefield National Historic Site near Cheyenne and the Shattuck Windmill Museum.

===Kansas===

US-283 enters from Oklahoma south of Englewood in Clark County, and passes through largely unpopulated areas of the county until joining up for a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 160. Following the split, US-283 continues north through Minneola before making its way into Dodge City, the only town with a population of more than 3,300 the highway passes through in the Sunflower State.

At Dodge City, US-283 jogs east. It meets with U.S. Route 400, but the two highways do not stay joined for long; US-400 splits and heads southeast towards Greensburg, while US-283 continues eastbound past the Dodge City Regional Airport. After passing the airport, the route then bends northeast before joining U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 56 for a brief stint.

US-50 and US-56 split east towards Kinsley, and US-283 resumes a due northerly course through open fields before reaching Jetmore, where K-156 crosses in an east–west direction. K-156 heads to Garden City westbound and Great Bend eastbound. The highway continues on another stretch through sparsely populated farmland before reaching Ness City and K-96, the first of two junctions in Ness County. The other junction in the county is at K-4 near Ransom.

The highway reaches Interstate 70 in WaKeeney, and makes a brief jog east through downtown WaKeeney before turning back to the north. US-283 between Ransom and I-70 was closed for much of 2006 as part of a major reconstruction program.

The highway continues north to Hill City, where it crosses U.S. Route 24. The route stays on course until it reaches southern Norton County, where it has a brief concurrency with K-9. At the split, K-9 continues west to Lenora, and US-283 resumes a straight northerly direction until the city of Norton, where after crossing U.S. Route 36, it reaches Nebraska later.

With the exception of small sections in Dodge City, all portions of US-283 in Kansas are two-laned.

===Nebraska===
U.S. Highway 283 enters Nebraska south of Arapahoe. At Arapahoe, US 283 meets U.S. Highway 6 and U.S. Highway 34. It continues north through Elwood, then turns northeast. Near Lexington, US 283 crosses the Platte River and intersects Interstate 80. It continues north into Lexington as a divided highway, turns back to a 2 lane road, crosses the Union Pacific railroad tracks via an overpass, and after taking 2 right turns on city streets, it ends at an intersection with U.S. Highway 30.

===Texas===

US 385 is designated as a part of the La Entrada al Pacifico trade corridor from Interstate 10 in Fort Stockton to Interstate 20 in Odessa. The section from Fort Stockton to McCamey runs concurrently with US 67. From McCamey, the route proceeds to Crane in Crane County.

From Crane to Odessa, US 385 intersects with U.S. Highway 62 in Seminole and continues northward to Brownfield, where US 385 continues northward towards Levelland and crosses by Texas State Highway 86 in Dimmitt, as well as U.S. Highway 84 in Littlefield. From Littlefield, US 385 continues northward until it crosses Interstate 40 and then goes in a half circle to Hartley, where US 385 joins U.S. Highway 87. US 385 and US 87 follow a northwest track until the two meet U.S. Highway 54 then split, with US 385 continuing northward until it exits Texas at the Oklahoma border.

On rural US 385, the speed limit is 75 mph in all counties going south of Gaines County starting between Seminole and Andrews down to US 90 in Marathon.

===Oklahoma===
In Oklahoma, US-385 runs through Cimarron County at the end of the Oklahoma panhandle. Fourteen miles north of the border, it joins with US-56, US-64, and US-412. The three highways run northeast into the county seat, Boise City. In the middle of town, the highways come to a traffic circle surrounding the Cimarron County Courthouse. The traffic circle serves six highways (with most passing through): U.S. Routes 56, 64, 385 and 412, and State Highways 3 and 325.

After leaving the circle, US-385 heads northward, overlapping US-287 and SH-3, the state&#x27;s longest state highway. SH-3 ends at the state line while US-287/385 continue north into Colorado.

The section of US-385 that overlaps SH-3 is also signed as Governor George Nigh&#x27;s Northwest Passage, after the governor of Oklahoma responsible for improvements to the corridor.

===Colorado===
U.S. 385 passes north–south through the easternmost counties of Colorado. It enters the state south of Campo on an overlap with U.S. Route 287. The overlap continues north until Lamar. At Lamar, the route turns east on an overlap with U.S. Route 50 and this overlap ends in Granada. The highway turns north at Granada and meets Interstate 70 at Burlington and Interstate 76 at Julesburg. The highway leaves Colorado northwest of Julesburg.

===Nebraska===

U.S. 385 passes north–south through the Nebraska Panhandle. It enters Nebraska south of Chappell and overlaps U.S. Route 30 between Chappell and Sidney. At Sidney, it turns north, meeting U.S. Route 26 at Bridgeport. It passes through Alliance before intersecting U.S. Route 20 at Chadron. It exits the state northwest of Chadron. Throughout its entire length in Nebraska, US 385 is known as the Gold Rush Byway, one of nine scenic byways in the state.

===South Dakota===

U.S. 385 enters South Dakota south of Oelrichs. It is overlapped with U.S. Route 18 between Oelrichs and Hot Springs. U.S. 385 turns north and enters Wind Cave National Park before turning west to go through Pringle. At Custer, it begins an overlap with U.S. Route 16, which ends near Hill City. U.S. 385 gradually turns in a northwesterly direction and ends at an intersection with U.S. Route 85 at Deadwood.

Legally, the South Dakota section of U.S. 385, with the exception of concurrencies with U.S. 16 and U.S. 18 and a gap at Wind Cave National Park, is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-235.

==History==

Today&#x27;s US 385 is the second route to bear the number. The original route eventually became part of US 87. This US 385 designation was decommissioned around 1935.

The current US 385 first appeared in 1959. Originally, the route continued along US 287 north of Lamar, Colorado, splitting in Kit Carson to follow US 40 east to meet up with the present-day alignment in Cheyenne Wells.

In South Dakota, in 2009, the South Dakota Department of Transportation designated US 16/US 385 between Custer and Hill City, which passes by the Crazy Horse Memorial, now being carved in the Black Hills. This segment of US 385 is also a part of the George Hearst Memorial Highway.

<text>Chapecó () is a municipality in the state of Santa Catarina, in the Southern Region of Brazil. Being a major industrial, financial and educational center, it is a major producer of industrialized food products. Considered a medium city, with a population estimated at 224,013 inhabitants, it is among the four most important cities in the state. It belongs to the Meso-region of Western Santa Catarina and to the Microregion of Chapecó.

Distant 550 km from the state capital, Florianópolis, it is Headquarters of the Metropolitan Region of Chapecó, and exerts significant influence not only in the Catarinense West but also in the Northwest Rio Grande do Sul and Southwest of Paraná, from an economic, cultural, or political point of view.

Chapecó became known worldwide through its association football club Chapecoense and the aftermath of LaMia Flight 2933 which killed 71, including most of the team&#x27;s roster and staff.

With the titles of &quot;Brazil&#x27;s agribusiness capital&quot; and &quot;Brazil&#x27;s business tourism capital&quot;, the planned town constructed in the form of a chess grid also has universities attracting students from all over Brazil. The main educational institutions are UFFS, UCEFF, UNOCHAPECÓ, UNOESC and UDESC.

== History ==

Until the 19th century, the area around Chapecó land was under indigenous (mainly Kaingang) and Spanish control, mostly unoccupied by European people and subject to border issues and armed conflicts. Brazilian control was in fact established as a military colony in 1882. Its official status as a municipality was established by state government decree after the Contestado War on August 25, 1917. Its area was then given to a private colonization company which began selling land to people coming mainly from the neighboring state of Rio Grande do Sul. Most of its inhabitants are descended from Italian, German and Polish immigrants.

== Demography ==

The region has always been the subject of disputes because of its strategic importance as a border region. During the Contestado War, airplanes were used for the first time in the history of America for the purpose of recognition and support for war operations. Colonized by Italian and German immigrants, mainly from Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná, São Paulo and the coast of Santa Catarina, the city today attracts several inhabitants thanks to its development.

It is one of the cities with the highest number (in percentage) of buildings in Santa Catarina. According to the IBGE, Chapecó has almost 16% of its population living in apartments, gaining in percentage of cities such as Joinville, Itajaí and Blumenau.

== Economy ==

This region of the state is home of some of the largest meat processing and exporting industrial enterprises such as Sadia and Seara Foods; the farmers are organized in agricultural cooperatives. Chapecó is known as a Brazilian agro-industrial capital, specialized in pork, poultry and technology involved. The city is headquarters of Aurora Central Cooperative and has a plant of BRF S.A. since 1973.

Other major economic sectors are metal mechanics specialized in equipment for slaughterhouses and transportation, plastics and packaging, furniture, beverages, software development and biotechnology. Civil construction and trade are also important source of income.

Chapecó is served by Serafin Enoss Bertaso Airport.

===Sports===

Football is the great passion of the Chapecoenses. The Chapecoense Football Association, known among its fans as a &quot;Hurricane from the west&quot;, Chape and verdão, a team from Santa Catarina, has as its last title the Campeonato Catarinense de Futebol de 2020 - Série A. Its headquarters is in Arena Condá, with a capacity of over 22,000 people and located in the East Zone of the city. The team had spent three consecutive years in the C Series of the Brazilian Championship (2010, 2011 and 2012), before beginning a rapid rise through the Brazilian football pyramid by reaching the second division in 2013 and entering the Serie A Brasileirão in 2014, where it currently resides. The team was among the best teams in South America, reaching the quarterfinals of the 2015 Copa Sudamericana and reaching the final of the 2016 Copa Sudamericana.

On November 29, 2016, Chapecoense team members and staff boarded LaMia Flight 2933 to play the first leg of the 2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals against Atlético Nacional in Medellín, Colombia. The plane crashed in the mountains a few miles south of the city. Seventy-one of the seventy-seven people on board died, including all of the club&#x27;s coaching staff and all but three of the players. A wave of commotion abated in the football world in the days and weeks after, playing tribute to the club; Atlético Nacional requested that CONMEBOL, the governing football association for South America, award the 2016 title to Chapecoense, which was granted.
== Education ==
Founded in 2009, the headquarters and main campus of the Federal University of Fronteira Sul (, UFFS) are in Chapecó, while its smaller campuses are located in Laranjeiras do Sul and Realeza in Paraná, and Cerro Largo, Erechim, and Passo Fundo in Rio Grande do Sul. One of the campuses of Universidade do Oeste de Santa Catarina (Unoesc) as well as campuses of other educational institutions such as UCEFF, UNOCHAPECÓ, and UDESC are also located in Chapecó.

== Other ==
The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chapecó.

<text>U.S. Route 189 is a spur of U.S. Route 89. It currently runs for 322 miles (518 km) from Provo, Utah at Interstate 15 to Jackson, Wyoming. The highway was not part of the original 1926 U.S. Highway system. The highway was created in the 1930s, absorbing former U.S. Route 530 and a portion of U.S. Route 30S. The portion through Provo Canyon (between Provo and Heber City, Utah) has been designated the Provo Canyon Scenic Byway by the state of Utah.

==Route description==

===Utah===
US-189 begins in Provo where it is known as University Avenue, referring to Brigham Young University. The highway then winds up Provo Canyon passing by Deer Creek Reservoir and paralleling the route of the Heber Creeper (now known as the Heber Valley Railroad). The portion in Provo Canyon is designated the Provo Canyon Scenic Byway by the state legislature. The highway exits Provo Canyon near Heber City, Utah.

At Heber City US-189 meets U.S. Route 40 and is co-signed with Route 40 all the way to its junction with I-80.

Prior to the construction of the Jordanelle Reservoir, the highway continued north concurrent with the former alignment of US-40 that is now under water. US-40 and 189 separated at Hailstone, also now under the lake. US-189 emerged from the lake shore along the route now signed State Route 32. SR-32 and former US-189 join I-80 in Wanship. Prior to the completion of Interstate 80 in eastern Utah US-189 formed the main streets of Coalville and other communities now bypassed by I-80.

The Utah section of US-189 is defined in Utah Code Annotated § 72-4-124(2). The Utah Code does not contain the concurrent alignment along US-40 and I-80, but the concurrent portion is included in Utah Department of Transportation maps of the area.

===Wyoming===
US 189 enters Wyoming from the west co-routed with Interstate 80. The routes separate east of Evanston, at exit 18, where US 189 proceeds north through the town of Kemmerer, home of the JC Penney Mother Store which is located along the route. US 189 continues north, eventually following the western shore of Fontenelle Reservoir and passing Names Hill before entering La Barge, passing what is left of the Moondance Diner, which was moved to the town from New York City in 2007, and is famous from many movies and television shows. The route then continues north along the Green River towards the neighboring towns of Big Piney and Marbleton. This area is heavily developed by the Oil and Natural Gas industries. The route then cuts across the northern part of the Green River Basin through the town of Daniel and intersects with US 191 at Daniel Junction and runs concurrently to the north. Continuing north, the road traverses increasingly mountainous terrain, entering the Bridger-Teton National Forest and passing through the small community of Bondurant before descending through the narrow Hoback River Canyon to an intersection with US 26 and rejoining its parents route, US 89 at Hoback Junction.

==History==

There was a US-189 in the initial 1926 plan for U.S. Highways, which ran from Nephi to Pigeon Hollow Junction. This route is currently the eastern half of State Route 132.

In 1938, a second iteration of US 189 was created using several state routes. The portion from Provo to Heber City in Utah was numbered State Route 7. Although signed US-189 starting in 1938 this road retained the SR-7 designation until 1977.

US-189 replaced US-530, designated in 1926, between the modern junctions of I-80 with US-40 at Silver Creek Junction and I-84 at Echo. Between Echo and Evanston, Wyoming US-189 was originally concurrent with US-30S. As portions of I-80 were complete, US-189 was moved from the old US-30S alignment to the freeway alignment.

Prior to the construction of the Jordanelle Reservoir, the US-189 designation alternated between two routes between Hailstone and Wanship. For most of this era, US-189 was routed along what is now State Route 32 via Kamas. However, there are some years the official Utah Highway Map shows the road through Kamas designated as US-189 Alternate, with the main route of US-189 concurrent with the routes of US-40 and what is now I-80.

In 1985 the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) began plans to relocate US-40 and US-189 to prepare for the construction of the Jordanelle Reservoir. As late as 1989, UDOT still intended move US-189 to an alignment on the northern shore of the proposed reservoir. On January 18, 1990 the Federal Highway Administration sent a letter to UDOT recommending that US-189 not be moved to this new alignment. The stated reason was this new routing would result in traveling &quot;out-of-direction&quot;. AASHTO agreed, and authorized a change of plan for the route of US-189 to run concurrent with US-40. UDOT agreed, and this new road was instead signed as extension of State Route 248. The portion of the former route of US-189 not submerged by the new lake was designated State Route 32 after months of negotiations with county officials.

However, although US-189 was now officially concurrent with US-40 between Heber City and Silver Creek Junction, this segment was signed only as US-40, and an &quot;END US-189&quot; sign was posted in Heber City. This lasted until late 2017, when the end signs were removed and US-189 signs were added to the US-40 concurrency. US-189 remains unsigned on the I-80 concurrency between Silver Creek Junction and the Wyoming state line.

<text>The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins (sometimes known as the WBS Penguins) are a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League, and are the AHL affiliate of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Pittsburgh Penguins. They play at the Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza in Wilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania, just outside the city of Wilkes-Barre. They have won the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy twice for having the best record in the regular season.

==History==

The Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; top minor league affiliate throughout the 1990s was the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the IHL. However, in the mid-1990s, the IHL began moving away from being a developmental league and more towards being an independent minor league. For this reason, the Penguins wanted their top minor league affiliate in the AHL. The Penguins purchased the dormant Cornwall Aces AHL franchise from the Colorado Avalanche in 1996, but left the team inactive until the 1999–2000 season due to construction delays at their intended home–a new arena in Wilkes-Barre Township. The team is affectionately referred to as the &quot;Baby Penguins&quot; by fans. Their mascot is Tux the penguin, who wears number No. 99 in reference to the team&#x27;s first season, in 1999.

The Penguins have gone to the Calder Cup final three times but have never won the championship. The team went all the way to the finals in their second season, losing to the Saint John Flames in six games. The Penguins returned to the finals in their fifth season, but were swept by the Milwaukee Admirals. They most recently made it to the finals in 2008 by way of beating the Portland Pirates in a seven-game series in the Eastern Conference finals. They went on to play the Chicago Wolves in the final, but lost the series in six games.

The WBS Penguins won the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy for the best finish in the regular season, in 2011, with 117 points. Goaltender Brad Thiessen was named the recipient of the Aldege &quot;Baz&quot; Bastien Memorial Award, an award given to the AHL&#x27;s most outstanding goaltender for each season. He posted a record of 35–8–1 in 46 appearances, along with a 1.94 goals-against-average and a .922 save percentage. Head coach John Hynes won the Louis A. R. Pieri Memorial Award, awarded to the most outstanding AHL coach of the season. Despite the best regular season finish in team history, the Penguins were eliminated in the second round of the 2011 playoffs by the Charlotte Checkers in six games.
The Penguins have made the playoffs in all but four seasons of their existence. The Penguins held a playoff streak of 16 seasons from the 2002–03 season to the 2017–18 season.

Prior to the 2009–10 season, they held the inaugural Penguins Black and Gold Game, an intra-squad game which featured members of the Pittsburgh and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins and was the first ever head-to-head meeting between Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. The game was a complete sellout and tickets never reached the general public. The Penguins organization held its second Black and Gold Game prior to the 2010–11 season on September 19, 2010.

In 2009, they also spawned an affiliated youth level organization, the Wilkes-Barre Junior Pens. The team is based out of the Ice Rink at Coal Street Park, which also serves as a practice facility for the Penguins.

The Penguins&#x27; biggest rivals had been the Philadelphia Phantoms, the AHL affiliate of Pennsylvania&#x27;s other NHL team, the Philadelphia Flyers. After that team moved to Glens Falls, New York, (as the Adirondack Phantoms) the Hershey Bears, also located in Pennsylvania, became the major rivals of the Penguins (they are currently the AHL affiliate of another rival of the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Washington Capitals). In 2014, the Adirondack Phantoms relocated back to eastern Pennsylvania as the Lehigh Valley Phantoms.

<text>&quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot; is episode 16 of season two of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. It was written by Marti Noxon and first broadcast on The WB on February 10, 1998.

In this episode, Cordelia breaks up with Xander after her friends mock her. Xander retaliates by attempting a love spell to &quot;put her through the same hell&quot;, and he gets a little more than he had bargained for.

==Plot==
During a patrol through the cemetery, Xander shows Buffy a silver necklace he intends to give to Cordelia the following night for Valentine&#x27;s Day. The next day at school, Xander witnesses Amy Madison use magic to avoid a homework assignment. Soon after, Giles runs into Jenny Calendar; however, their relationship remains frosty, with Giles deciding talking to Buffy is more important than making amends with Jenny. Giles warns Buffy that Angelus becomes particularly vicious around Valentine&#x27;s Day, and suggests she stays indoors for the following nights. Meanwhile, Cordelia is insulted by Harmony and the Cordettes, revealing to Cordelia that her relationship with Xander is not as secret as she once thought.

Angel competes with Spike for Drusilla&#x27;s affection. Spike, who is still in a wheelchair after the events of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line,&quot; gives her a gold necklace, whereas Angel gives her a human heart, fresh and bloody, saying, &quot;I knew you&#x27;d like it. I found it in a quaint little shop girl.&quot;

Xander gives the necklace to Cordelia, but she breaks up with him under pressure from her friends. Xander is heartbroken, and blackmails Amy into casting a love spell upon Cordelia so he can take revenge by breaking up with her. However, as he intended to use the spell for revenge rather than its true purpose, the magic goes wrong, with Cordelia becoming the only woman &quot;not&quot; to be affected by the spell (protected by her necklace).

The following day, Xander is shocked to find Cordelia repels his advances, and retreats to the library. Buffy makes it clear that she is attracted to Xander, but Amy interrupts them and tells Xander she believes the spell went wrong. She begins to act similarly to Buffy, so Xander rushes home and finds Willow in his bed, where she attempts to seduce him.

The following day, all of the girls of Sunnydale High obsessively start following Xander around the corridors and Harmony criticises a shocked Cordelia for breaking up with Xander. Xander seeks help from Giles, who is appalled by Xander&#x27;s foolishness. Giles goes looking for Amy, so that she can reverse the spell, while Xander barricades himself in the library. However, Buffy gets in and attempts to seduce a reluctant Xander. Amy also arrives, and becomes jealous of Buffy, ultimately casting a spell that changes Buffy into a rat. An angry Giles orders Xander to go home, while he attempts to make Amy reverse the spells. Oz looks for the Buffy-rat to ensure that she is not hurt.

As Xander is leaving the school, he finds the spell is becoming stronger and more uncontrollable. He saves Cordelia from an attack by Harmony and a group of girls. Xander and Cordelia seek shelter in Buffy&#x27;s home, locking Joyce out when she too falls under the spell. While in Buffy&#x27;s room, Xander is pulled out of the window by Angelus, who intends to kill him to upset Buffy. Xander is saved by an infatuated Drusilla. Just as Drusilla is about to turn Xander into a vampire, a group of girls from the school arrive to save him, then Cordelia saves him from the girls. Xander barricades himself in the basement with Cordelia, who is touched to learn that Xander performed the spell for her. The love-crazed mob breaks through the door and attacks Xander and Cordelia just as Giles and Amy manage to lift the spell. Buffy regains human form and the mob disperse, uncertain of why they were there in the first place. The next day Buffy and Xander talk about events and decide it could be worse. Cordelia comes by with her friends and they make fun of Xander when Cordelia suddenly snaps, tells her friends she is way cooler than any of them because she makes up her own mind about what she wants, and she will date who she wants to. She then catches up with Xander and they walk away together holding hands.

==Themes==
Essayist Theresa Basile compares the episode&#x27;s complex treatment of the dangerous nature of love spells with the classic Shakespeare comedy &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. &quot;Giles states that the reason the spell backfired is because Amy performed it improperly. Two other explanations are heavily implied in the episode, though. One potential reason is that Cordelia didn&#x27;t respond to the spell because she already loved Xander. The other reason is that Xander&#x27;s intentions behind the spell weren&#x27;t &#x27;pure&#x27;&quot; - Amy tells him, &quot;Intent has to be pure with love spells.&quot; Basile says, &quot;Cordelia doesn&#x27;t really want to break up with Xander, but feels pressured to end the relationship because she doesn&#x27;t want to lose favor with her popular friends. ... Xander, meanwhile, receives confirmation that even his most sincere, gentle efforts will end in rejection, that even if a girl likes him and he likes her back, she won’t like him &quot;enough&quot; to stand up to her friends. No wonder his feelings are hurt. At the end of the episode, though, after he does something damaging and colossally stupid, &quot;then&quot; Cordelia decides to get back together with him. I&#x27;m not sure the lesson about violating consent really sinks in when the result is getting his girlfriend back.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Vox&quot; ranked this episode at #68 out of the 144 &quot;Buffy&quot; episodes, calling it &quot;a marvel of tonal balancing: The Xander A-plot is slapstick and funny with a core of heartbreak, and the subplot of Angel musing on the perfect Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for Buffy keeps the menace and subtle horror of the season&#x27;s central plot running through the background.&quot;

Noel Murray of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praised the acting of &quot;Nicholas Brendon, who gets to do slow-burns, double-takes and head-palms — all the classic business of the comic actor — throughout the episode, while also getting to display how deeply wounding this whole Cordelia situation is.&quot; He admired the subplot with Angel, &quot;who lurks around the edges of the episode like a malicious presence, reminding Buffy and the audience at home that he could strike at any time.&quot;

Reviewer Billie Doux called the episode &quot;a delight from beginning to end. None of that wussy lovey dovey Valentine&#x27;s Day stuff... It&#x27;s topical, funny, silly, romantic, clever, horrifying, and has a great moral for all of us: being yourself is more important than pleasing the masses.&quot; Mark Oshiro observes that Xander had been &quot;written with one note&quot; and been &quot;running with that for twenty-seven straight episodes. And now, this long character arc has come to fruition in a terrifying and hilarious way,&quot; though the episode is difficult, being &quot;inherently about one man violating the consent of EVERY single woman in the entirety of Sunnydale, possibly the world... [T]he show takes what was awful about Xander in the past (his creepy opinions of attractive women) and then &quot;actively uses that against him&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="903430" wikidata="Q848371" url="?curid=903430" title="Lichen planus">
<text>Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease that affects the skin, nails, hair, and mucous membranes. It is not an actual lichen, but is named for its appearance. It is characterized by polygonal, flat-topped, violaceous papules and plaques with overlying, reticulated, fine white scale (Wickham&#x27;s striae), commonly affecting dorsal hands, flexural wrists and forearms, trunk, anterior lower legs and oral mucosa. The hue may be gray-brown in people with darker skin. Although there is a broad clinical range of LP manifestations, the skin and oral cavity remain as the major sites of involvement. The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be the result of an autoimmune process with an unknown initial trigger. There is no cure, but many different medications and procedures have been used in efforts to control the symptoms.

The term lichenoid reaction (lichenoid eruption or lichenoid lesion) refers to a lesion of similar or identical histopathologic and clinical appearance to lichen planus (i.e., an area which resembles lichen planus, both to the naked eye and under a microscope). Sometimes dental materials or certain medications can cause lichenoid reactions. They can also occur in association with graft versus host disease.
==Classification==

&quot;Lichen planus&quot; lesions are so called because of their &quot;lichen-like&quot; appearance and can be classified by the site they involve, or by their morphology.

===Site===
Lichen planus may be categorized as affecting mucosal or cutaneous surfaces.
* &quot;Cutaneous&quot; forms are those affecting the skin, scalp, and nails.
* &quot;Mucosal&quot; forms are those affecting the lining of the gastrointestinal tract (mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, anus), larynx, and other mucosal surfaces including the genitals, peritoneum, ears, nose, bladder and conjunctiva of the eyes.

===Pattern===
Lichen planus lesions can occur in many different forms or morphologies:

;Papular
:Papular form is the classic cutaneous lichen planus (CLP) lesion characterized by shiny, red or purple-colored, flat-topped papule. Lesions may have a thin, transparent, and adherent scale. Fine whitish points or lacy lines (Wickham&#x27;s striae) may be seen on the surface of well-developed papules.
;Annular
:&#x27;Ring-shaped&#x27; lesions that develop gradually from single small pigmented spots into circular groups of papules with clear, unaffected skin in the center. The ring-like lesions may very slowly enlarge, co-join and morph into larger irregular (serpentine) bands, sometimes accompanied by lines (See Linear, below). Annular CLP is uncommon and classically involves the male genitalia (glans penis and penile shaft), groin, axilla and also the extremities.
;Linear
: Papules are arranged in a line (the &quot;Blaschko line&quot;). This pattern may develop secondary to trauma (koebnerization) or, uncommonly, as a spontaneous, isolated eruption, usually on the extremities, and rarely on the face.
; Hypertrophic
: This pattern is characterized by hyperkeratotic thick pruritic red-brown to purple-gray plaques with follicular accentuation. Hypertrophic CLP commonly involves the extremities, especially the interphalangeal joints and the anterior legs in a symmetrical distribution. This form is also known as &quot;lichen planus verrucosus&quot;.
; Atrophic
: This morphology is characterized by the presence of a few well-demarcated, white-bluish papules or plaques with central superficial atrophy. Atrophic CLP is the clinical endpoint of chronic annular or hypertrophic LP with atrophic lesions. The use of potent topical corticosteroids for a long-term may predispose the patient to developing atrophic lesions.
; Bullous
: This morphology is characterized by the development of vesicles and bullae with the skin lesions. This is a rare variant of lichen planus, and also known as &quot;vesiculobullous lichen planus&quot;.
; Actinic
: Rare form presenting as nummular patches or plaques with a hypopigmented halo surrounding a hyperpigmented center. Actinic CLP is more prevalent in African Americans, Indians, and Middle-Eastern individuals and commonly affects the sun-exposed areas.
; Ulcerative
: This morphology is characterized by chronic, painful bullae and ulceration of the feet, often with cicatricial sequelae evident. This is a rare variant of lichen planus.
; Pigmented 
: This morphology is characterized by hyperpigmented, dark-brown macules in sun-exposed areas and flexural folds. This is a rare variant of lichen planus.
; Follicular
: Characterized by follicular, flat, elevated or hemispherical erythematous papules with or without keratoses presenting in groups or disseminated. The Graham‐Little‐Piccardi‐Lasseur syndrome, seen in a familial pattern and also predominantly in women, is characterized by the appearance of follicular LP on the trunk with LP follicularis decalvans on the scalp. Follicular LP on the scalp is more likely to lead to scarring alopecia.
; Inverse
: Characterized by extensive erythematous lesions with poorly defined borders and in part with lichenification. Inverse LP typically affects the axillae, inguinal creases, limb flexures and submammary region. Pigmentation of the individual lesions at these inverse locations are typical. Additionally, keratotic papules and erosions with a bizarre configuration can occur.

===Overlap syndromes===
Occasionally, lichen planus is known to occur with other conditions. For example:
* Lupus erythematosus overlap syndrome. Lesions of this syndrome share features of both lupus erythematosus and lichen planus. Lesions are usually large and hypopigmented, atrophic, and with a red to blue colour and minimal scaling. Telangectasia may be present.
* Lichen sclerosus overlap syndrome, sharing features of lichen planus and lichen sclerosus.

==Signs and symptoms==
Although lichen planus can present with a variety of lesions, the most common presentation is as a well defined area of purple-coloured, itchy, flat-topped papules with interspersed lacy white lines (Wickham&#x27;s striae). This description is known as the characteristic &quot;6 Ps&quot; of lichen planus: planar (flat-topped), purple, polygonal, pruritic, papules, and plaques. This rash, after regressing, is likely to leave an area of hyperpigmentation that slowly fades. That said, a variety of other lesions can also occur.

===Skin===
Variants of cutaneous lichen planus are distinguished based upon the appearance of the lesions and/or their distribution. Lesions can affect the:
* Extremities (face, dorsal hands, arms, and nape of neck). This is more common in Middle Eastern countries in spring and summer, where sunlight appears to have a precipitating effect.
* Palms and soles
* Intertriginous areas of the skin. This is also known as &quot;inverse lichen planus&quot;.
* Nails characterized by irregular longitudinal grooving and ridging of the nail plate, thinning of the nail plate, pterygium formation, shedding of the nail plate with atrophy of the nail bed, subungual keratosis, longitudinal erthronychia (red streaks), and subungual hyperpigmentation. A sand-papered appearance is present in around 10% of individuals with nail lichen planus.
* Hair and scalp. The scalp is rarely affected by a condition known as lichen planopilaris, acuminatus, follicular lichen planus, and peripilaris, characterised by violaceous, adherent follicular scale with progressive scarring alopecia. While lichen planus and lichen planopilaris may occur together, aside from sharing the term &#x27;lichen&#x27; and revealing inflammation on skin biopsy, there is neither established data on their co-occurrence nor data to suggest a common etiology. Lichen planopilaris is considered an orphan disease with no definitive prevalence data and no proven effective treatments.
Other variants may include:
* &quot;Lichen planus pemphigoides&quot; characterized by the development of tense blisters atop lesions of lichen planus or the development vesicles de novo on uninvolved skin.
* &quot;Keratosis lichenoides chronica&quot; (also known as &quot;Nekam&#x27;s disease&quot;) is a rare dermatosis characterized by violaceous papular and nodular lesions, often arranged in a linear or reticulate pattern on the dorsal hands and feet, extremities, and buttock, and some cases manifest by seborrheic dermatitis-like eruption on the scalp and face; also palmo plantar keratosis has been reported.
* &quot;Lichenoid keratoses&quot; (also known as &quot;benign lichenoid keratosis&quot;, and &quot;Solitary lichen planus&quot;) is a cutaneous condition characterized by brown to red scaling maculopapules, found on sun-exposed skin of extremities. Restated, this is a cutaneous condition usually characterized by a solitary dusky-red to violaceous papular skin lesion.
* &quot;Lichenoid dermatitis&quot; represents a wide range of cutaneous disorders characterized by lichen planus-like skin lesions.

===Mucous membranes===

Lichen planus affecting mucosal surfaces may have one lesion or be multifocal. Examples of lichen planus affecting mucosal surfaces include:
* &quot;Esophageal lichen planus&quot;, affecting the esophageal mucosa. This can present with difficulty or pain when swallowing due to oesophageal inflammation, or as the development of an esophageal stricture. It has also been hypothesized that it is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
* &quot;Genital lichen planus,&quot; which may cause lesions on the glans penis or skin of the scrotum in males, and the vulva or vagina in females. Symptoms may include lower urinary tract symptoms associated with stenosis of the urethra, painful sexual intercourse, and itching. In females, &quot;Vulvovaginal-gingival syndrome&quot;, is severe and distinct variant affecting the vulva, vagina, and gums, with complications including scarring, vaginal stricture formation, or vulva destruction. The corresponding syndrome in males, affecting the glans penis and gums, is the &quot;peno-gingival syndrome&quot;. It is associated with HLA-DQB1.

====Mouth====

Oral lichen planus (also termed &quot;oral mucosal lichen planus&quot;), is a form of mucosal lichen planus, where lichen planus involves the oral mucosa, the lining of the mouth. This may occur in combination with other variants of lichen planus. Six clinical forms of oral lichen planus (OLP) are recognized:

; Reticular
: The most common presentation of oral lichen planus (OLP) is characterised by the net-like or spider web-like appearance of lacy white lines, known as Wickham&#x27;s striae. This is usually asymptomatic. Reticular OLP may progress to the more severe subtypes, such as the erosive form, if left untreated.
; Erosive or ulcerative
: The second most common form and the most advanced form of oral lichen planus, is characterised by oral ulcers presenting with persistent, irregular areas of redness, ulcerations and erosions covered with a yellow slough. This can occur in one or more areas of the mouth. In 25% of people with erosive oral lichen planus, the gums are involved, described as desquamative gingivitis (a condition not unique to lichen planus). This may be the initial or only sign of the condition. Involvement of the dorsum of the tongue might cause an altered sense of taste (dysgeusia).
; Papular
: This form is characterized by small white pinpoint papules that are asymptomatic. Hence, they can be easily missed during a routine checkup. It is referred to as the initial and transient phase of OLP.
; Plaque-like
: Large, homogenous white patches are characteristic of this form which may resemble leukoplakia. This form is more prevalent in tobacco smokers.
; Atrophic
: This form is a common presentation that has similarities to the erosive form. It has a more prominent atrophic lesion on a background of erythema with radiating white striae at the margins. Atrophic oral lichen planus may also manifest as desquamative gingivitis.
; Bullous
: Rare form of OLP characterized by fluid-filled vesicles ranging in size from 1 to 2 mm to several cm in diameter. The vesicles or bullae appear white or gray-purple in color and are fluctuant. The fluid in the vesicles are usually clear but may be hemorrhagic or purulent upon secondary infection. These rupture easily and they leave an ulcerated, painful surface.

These types often coexist in the same individual. Oral lichen planus (OLP) tends to present bilaterally as mostly white lesions on the inner cheek, although any mucosal site in the mouth may be involved. Other sites, in decreasing order of frequency, may include the tongue, lips, gingivae, floor of the mouth, and very rarely, the palate.

Generally, oral lichen planus tends not to cause any discomfort or pain, although some people may experience soreness when eating or drinking acidic or spicy foodstuffs or beverages. When symptoms arise, they are most commonly associated with the atrophic and ulcerative subtypes. These symptoms can include a burning sensation to severe pain. They may also experience mucosal bleeding in response to mild trauma, such as toothbrushing. Additionally, the Koebner phenomenon (the development of new lesions at sites of trauma) is not only present in cutaneous lichen planus (CLP) but can also occur in the setting of OLP.

Residual postinflammatory hyperpigmentation has been reported in association with OLP, manifesting as brown to black pigmentation on the oral mucosa and may most likely occur in dark-skinned individuals.

OLP may occur as a sole manifestation of the disease or in conjunction with other clinical manifestations of LP, including cutaneous LP, genital LP, nail LP, and lichen planopilaris (scalp LP).

==Causes==
Cutaneous LP is a self-limiting condition. It usually resolves within 6 to 12 months. Oral LP is a non infectious, chronic inflammatory condition that involves the oral mucosa and may be accompanied by skin lesions. The etiology of oral LP are unknown.

It is not clear whether the mechanisms causing isolated oral LP are different from those causing oral LP with cutaneous LP. An immune-mediated mechanism where basal keratinocytes are being targeted as foreign antigens by activated T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, has been proposed. Upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and cytokines associated with T-helper 1 immune response, may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of lichen planus.

Stress is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of oral LP. Patients with anxiety and depression are reported more commonly with oral LP if compared to normal healthy individuals. Some studies have indicated that stressful events can induce LP lesions in otherwise healthy individuals. However, a cause effect relationship between stress and the onset of oral LP has not been demonstrated.

Autoimmune response to epithelial self-antigens remains a possibility. A single study of cutaneous LP reported evidence in support of autoimmunity by expanding in vitro T cells isolated from the skin lesions of two patients, followed by testing the ability of these T cells to kill autologous keratinocytes (cytotoxicity).

Several potential triggers of oral LP have been proposed over the years, mainly

# Hypersensitivity reaction
#* Restorative material (e.g. amalgam and composite) or drugs can cause hypersensitivity reaction and lead to oral LP.
#* Oral LP usually resolve upon removal of the trigger, as is characteristics of oral LP
# Viral infection

== Pathogenesis ==
Oral LP is considered to be a T-cell mediated chronic inflammatory tissue reaction that results in a cytotoxic reaction against epithelial basal cells. The inflammatory infiltrate in oral LP is primarily composed of CD8+ T cells. A potential pathway for CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in oral LP is described as follows:

Antigens presented on MHC 1 molecules activates CD8+ T cells on keratinocytes or by encounters with activated CD4+ helper T cells or cytokines produced by activated CD4+ helper T cells

Activated CD8+ T cells induce keratinocyte apoptosis through various mechanisms such as secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, secretion of granzyme B, or Fas-Fas ligand interactions. Chemokines are produced by activated CD8+ T cells that attract additional inflammatory cells, thereby promoting continued inflammation.

Other mechanisms that have been proposed include:
* upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases that disrupt the epithelial basement membrane zone and allow entry of immune cells into the epidermis,
* the release of proinflammatory mediators and proteases by mast cells, and
* perturbations in the innate immune response that may involve toll-like receptors.

Oral LP may also be caused by genetic factor which influence the immune function. A separate study performed in China found an association between a polymorphism in the TNF-alpha gene and risk for oral LP in a subset of patients. An Italian study found a significant increase in a genetic polymorphism of the first intron of the interferon (IFN)-gamma promoter in patients with oral LP compared with controls.

==Diagnosis==

=== Skin ===
Patient history and clinical presentation need to be taken to diagnose lichen planus. Patients with suspected cutaneous lichen planus need to be evaluated clinically through patient interviews and physical examinations. Patients should be questioned about their medication history, any history of pruritus or genital pain and history of dysphagia or odynophagia. Examination of entire cutaneous surface including the scalp, oral cavity and external genitalia need to be included. Wickham&#x27;s striae often can be seen during microscopic examination of cutaneous lesions of lichen planus.

To confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous lichen planus, a skin biopsy can be done. A punch biopsy of sufficient depth to the mid dermis is usually significant. Immunofluorescence studies are not always needed. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) can be useful in patients with bullous lesions to differentiate the condition from an autoimmune vesiculobullous disease.

=== Mouth ===
A diagnosis of oral lichen planus (LP) is confirmed through review of the patient history, physical examination, and histologic findings.

The clinical evaluation should include a patient history that assesses the following:
* History of LP involving other body sites or other skin disorders that may present with similar findings (e.g., autoimmune blistering diseases)
* Presence of associated symptoms (e.g., pain, burning)
* Medication the patients are taking within the few weeks to months after drug initiation e.g. antihypertensives, antidepressants, diuretics, antidiabetics, NSAIDs, etc. to evaluate for the possibility of an oral lichenoid drug eruption
* History of dental restorations, use of dental appliances, or oral exposure to substances that may cause oral lichenoid contact eruptions (e.g. dental composites, cobalt chromium based dentures etc.)

A full examination that includes the evaluation of the mucosal and cutaneous surfaces, including the vulva, vagina, penis, scalp, and nails should be performed. Thorough examination may lead to the detection of extraoral manifestations of LP that provide additional support for the diagnosis or the identification of clinical findings that suggest another diagnosis.

Tissue biopsies of oral LP help to confirm the diagnosis and are particularly of value for erythematous and erosive LP, which share features with multiple other mucosal disorders, including oral malignancy. Biopsies to confirm oral LP are less essential in patients who present with classic reticular LP, particularly in patients in whom a diagnosis of LP has already been confirmed through biopsy of an extraoral manifestation of this disorder.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

==== Skin ====

# Lichenoid drug eruption
#* The cutaneous manifestations resemble idiopathic lichen planus.
# Chronic graft-versus-host disease
#* The history of preceding hematopoietic cell transplant is helpful for diagnosis
# Psoriasis
# Atopic dermatitis
# Cutaneous lupus erythematosus
# Discoid lupus erythematosus

====Mouth====

=====Oral lichenoid drug reaction=====
Lichenoid drug eruptions may be caused by a variety of systemic medications and share clinical features with oral LP. Histologic findings of a deep mixed infiltrate with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils (with or without eosinophils) and perivascular inflammation favor this diagnosis.

=====Oral lichenoid contact reaction (allergic contact mucositis)=====
Oral lichenoid contact reactions may be caused by a variety of substances. The clinical and histologic features of oral lichenoid contact reactions are similar to oral LP. Patch testing and recognition of the proximity of an offending substance to the eruption can aid with diagnosis.

=====Autoimmune blistering diseases=====
Mucous membrane pemphigoid and other autoimmune blistering diseases may present with oral erosions and desquamative gingivitis similar to that seen in erosive LP. Biopsies for routine histologic examination and direct immunofluorescence are useful for distinguishing these disorders from oral LP.

=====Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)=====
Lacy, reticulated plaques or erosions that resemble oral LP may occur in GVHD. The histologic findings of these disorders are also similar. The patient history is useful for differentiating chronic GVHD from oral LP. Oral involvement in acute GVHD is less well characterized than chronic GVHD, but has been associated with erythematous, erosive, ulcerative, or lichenoid oral lesions.

=====Leukoplakia=====

Leukoplakia is a manifestation of squamous epithelial hyperplasia that may be a precursor to oral squamous cell carcinoma. White patches or plaques usually appear on the oral mucosa. To rule out malignancy, a biopsy of leukoplakia is indicated.

=====Oral squamous cell carcinoma=====
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can present as erythematous or white patches, ulcers, or exophytic masses. The highest risk for oral SCC may occur in patients with erythematous or erosive oral LP. A biopsy is indicated.

=====Leukoedema=====
Leukoedema is a common, benign finding in the oral cavity that presents as white-gray, somewhat translucent plaques on the mucosa. The buccal mucosa is the most common site for involvement. Symptoms are absent, and no treatment is necessary.

=====Oropharyngeal candidiasis=====
Oropharyngeal candidiasis (also known as thrush) is a common infection that has a predilection for infants, older adults with dentures, immunosuppressed individuals, and individuals utilizing intraoral corticosteroid therapy. Patients present with white plaques or erythematous patches on the buccal mucosa, palate, tongue, or oropharynx that may be mistaken for reticular LP.

=== Histopathology ===

The histologic findings of oral LP can offer strong support for the diagnosis, but are not pathognomonic. Clinical correlation is required. Common histologic findings of oral LP include:
* Parakeratosis and slight acanthosis of the epithelium
* Saw-toothed rete ridges
* Liquefaction (hydropic) degeneration of the basal layer with apoptotic keratinocytes (referred to as Civatte, colloid, hyaline, or cytoid bodies)
* An amorphous band of eosinophilic material at the basement membrane composed of fibrin or fibrinogen.
* A lichenoid (band-like) lymphocytic infiltrate immediately subjacent to the epithelium.

Nonetheless, interpreting the histopathological features of oral LP has been associated historically with high intra-observer and inter-observer variabilities.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for lichen planus, and so treatment of cutaneous and oral lichen planus is for symptomatic relief or due to cosmetic concerns. When medical treatment is pursued, first-line treatment typically involves either topical or systemic corticosteroids, and removal of any triggers. Without treatment, most lesions will spontaneously resolve within 6–9 months for cutaneous lesions, and longer for mucosal lesions.

===Skin===
Many different treatments have been reported for cutaneous lichen planus, however there is a general lack of evidence of efficacy for any treatment. The mainstay of localized skin lesions is topical steroids. Additional treatments include retinoids, such as acitretin, or sulfasalazine. Narrow band UVB phototherapy or systemic PUVA therapy are known treatment modalities for generalized disease.

===Mouth===
Reassurance that the condition is benign, elimination of precipitating factors and improving oral hygiene are considered initial management for symptomatic OLP, and these measures are reported to be useful. Treatment usually involves topical corticosteroids (such as betamethasone, clobetasol, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone) and analgesics, or if these are ineffective and the condition is severe, then systemic corticosteroids may be used. Calcineurin inhibitors (such as pimecrolimus, tacrolimus or cyclosporin) are sometimes used. While topical steroids are widely accepted as first line treatment for mucosal lichen planus, there is only weak evidence to support their effectiveness for erosive oral lichen planus.

==Prognosis==
Cutaneous lichen planus lesions typically resolve within six months to a year. However, some variant such as the hypertrophic variant might persist for years if left untreated or unmonitored.

It is found that cutaneous lichen planus does not carry a risk of skin cancer. In contrast to cutaneous LP, which is self limited, lichen planus lesions in the mouth may persist for many years, and tend to be difficult to treat, with relapses being common.

Although this condition was first described almost a century ago, it has been reported that its associated oral cancer risk has been exaggerated.
Overall, it is found that patients with erythematous or erosive oral lichen planus have a higher risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma compared to patients diagnosed with other variants.

Due to the possibility that oral LP may increase risk for oral cancer, patients with oral lichen planus are encouraged to avoid activities known to increase the risk for oral cancer, such as smoking and alcohol use.

Patients with oral lichen planus should be followed-up at least every 6 to 12 months, to assess the disease activity, changes in symptoms or even detect early signs of malignancy.

==Epidemiology==
The overall estimated prevalence of lichen planus in worldwide population is in the range of 0.2% to 5%.

It generally occurs more commonly in females, in a ratio of 3:2, and most cases are diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 60, but it can occur at any age.

Lichen planus can occur in patients as diverse cutaneous manifestations alone or in combination with mucosal lichen planus and, or lichen planus of the nails. Study shows that frequency of mucosal involvement of lichen planus patients is 30- 70%.

Oral lichen planus is relatively common, It is one of the most common mucosal diseases. The prevalence in the general population is about 1.27–2.0%, and it occurs more commonly in middle aged people. Oral lichen planus in children is rare. About 50% of females with oral lichen planus were reported to have undiagnosed vulvar lichen planus.

Some studies suggest that cutaneous lichen planus is more commonly found in men whilst oral lichen planus lesions are more commonly found in women.

==History==
Lichen planus was first described in 1869 by Erasmus Wilson as an inflammatory disorder with unknown etiology. Initially, the characteristic surface markings or striae was described by Weyl in 1885. In 1895, Wickham further explained the characteristic of the lesion, now known as Wickham striae. Further on, Darier explained the presence of such characteristic markings by correlating with an increase thickness of the granular cell layer. The coexistence of oral, cervical and stomach lichen planus lesions were described by Guogerot and Burnier in 1937. A similar variant of mucosal lichen planus as the vulvovaginal-gingival syndrome with erosive lesions involving oral and vulvovaginal mucosa were introduced by Pelisse and colleagues in year 1982.

The origin of the word is believed to be from the Greek word &quot;Leichen&quot;, which means tree moss, and also from Latin word &quot;planus&quot;, which means flat and even surface.

<doc id="903431" wikidata="Q3151385" url="?curid=903431" title="Surprise (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>&quot;Surprise&quot; is episode 13 of season two of the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. It was written by Marti Noxon and first broadcast on The WB on January 19, 1998. &quot;Surprise&quot; is part one of a two-part story. Part two, &quot;Innocence,&quot; was broadcast the next day.

== Plot ==
Buffy has a vivid dream where a very &quot;alive&quot; Drusilla dusts Angel, which she fears is prophetic and realizes that Spike and Drusilla may still be alive. Oz finally asks Willow out on a date. She accepts, but remembers the Scoobies are planning a surprise party for Buffy&#x27;s 17th birthday and instead invites him to the party.

Elsewhere, Drusilla, strong as Buffy dreamed, arranges her own gala event, while Spike, using a wheelchair but quite &quot;alive&quot; as well, directs his gang to collect scattered pieces of the demon The Judge, a hoped-for ally who has the ability to burn humanity from people, to reassemble for her present.

Jenny Calendar gets a visit from her mysterious Uncle Enyos, who reveals her Gypsy past; they discuss her responsibilities ensuring that Angel continues to suffer. Enyos orders Jenny to separate Angel from the Slayer. On their way to Buffy&#x27;s surprise party, Buffy and Jenny intercept a piece of the Judge and bring it to the party, deducing Drusilla&#x27;s plot. Following her Gypsy orders, Jenny encourages Angel on a mission to prevent the dire consequences of reassembling the Judge – he must take the Judge&#x27;s arm by cargo ship to &quot;the remotest region possible.&quot; While Angel gives Buffy a Claddagh ring for her birthday during their tearful parting at the dock, Spike&#x27;s vamps manage to steal the arm back, scrubbing the mission.

Later at the library, Buffy has another informative dream, and takes Angel to investigate Spike and Drusilla&#x27;s lair at the factory. They discover the Judge is fully assembled and activated, and Spike and Drusilla capture and taunt the two, debating who will die first. They narrowly escape into the sewer system, then return to Angel&#x27;s apartment exhausted and drenched from the rain. Still suffering from successive threats of losing one another, Angel and Buffy confess feelings each has been trying to suppress. They make love for the first time and fall asleep in each other&#x27;s arms. Suddenly, in a flash of lightning and a crash of thunder, Angel bolts awake and runs out into the storm, calling Buffy&#x27;s name in anguish.

==Production==
===Filming===
According to &quot;Buffy, the Vampire Slayer: The Watcher&#x27;s Guide&quot; by Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder, filming at the docks occurred in San Pedro, California. The water was warmer than expected because of a warm El Niño current.

Sarah Michelle Gellar discussed love scenes in an interview with British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2002:

==Continuity==
In Buffy&#x27;s dream at the beginning of the episode, Willow is sitting at a table with a cappuccino and an organ grinder&#x27;s monkey. She says to the monkey, &quot;L&#x27;hippo a pique ses pantalons&quot; (&quot;The hippo stole his pants&quot;). This is a back reference to Oz&#x27;s jokes about animal crackers at the end of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line, Part 2.&quot; Willow must have told Buffy about the amusing incident. Also, Willow helps Buffy study for a French class in &quot;School Hard.&quot;

Oz and Willow have their first date, commencing one of the longest relationships on the show.
Angel is transformed into Angelus, becoming the Big Bad of season 2.
Spike and Drusilla are established as worthy adversaries, allowing for Spike&#x27;s eventual return appearances in seasons 3 and 4; and for his permanent placement as a regular cast member for seasons 5, 6, and 7.
Buffy&#x27;s birthday gift from Angel, her Claddagh ring, not only comes to signify her lost love for the rest of season 2, but also plays an important part in the beginning of season 3: First as a resonant antecedent to Scott Hope&#x27;s impromptu gift, and then as a mystical focus for Angel&#x27;s return from Acathla&#x27;s hell dimension.

==Broadcast==
&quot;Surprise&quot; drew a viewing audience of 2.3 million households.

It was the last episode to air on a Monday in the United States. It aired on Tuesdays from the next episode onward, so the second part (&quot;Innocence&quot;) was shown the next day. Myles McNutt explains,

==Reception==
&quot;Vox&quot; ranked it at #16 out of the 144 episodes, saying that it &quot;is the last episode of &quot;Buffy&quot; before it becomes a different show. Up until this point, it&#x27;s been a smart, charming, and sharply written but also goofy and campy take on adolescence and its demons. After &quot;Innocence,&quot; it&#x27;s an immortal piece of television. &quot;Surprise&quot; is the episode that gets it there, and it does so with aplomb. There&#x27;s an almost palpable sense of foreboding hanging over everything... It&#x27;s an episode that promises everything is about to change, and while a lot of TV makes that promise, Buffy actually delivers.&quot;

Myles McNutt writes that &quot;by merging romance with tragedy, and by turning its central character into an unwitting agent of terrifying change, &quot;Buffy&quot; moves beyond the limitations of teenage drama to something that strikes deeper into the limitations of the human condition. ... [T]he show isn&#x27;t interested in drawing out the mystery of how things are going to change, but rather focused on demonstrating what has been changed, how it&#x27;s been changed, and what the ramifications of this are to the series&#x27; future.&quot;

Billie Doux writes that the &quot;symbolic dream sequences work incredibly well with the plot. Broken plates, white nightgowns, rings dropping to the floor, wonderful symbols of lost virginity.&quot;

==Notes==
:1.In &quot;What&#x27;s My Line, Part 2,&quot; Oz says to Willow, &quot;The monkey is the only cookie animal that gets to wear clothes... Like, is the hippo going - man, where are my pants? I have my hippo dignity. And you know the monkey&#x27;s just [&quot;in a French accent&quot;], &#x27;I mock you with my monkey pants!&#x27;&quot; He adds, &quot;All monkeys are French.&quot;
