<text>The Jack Benny Program, starring Jack Benny, is a radio and television comedy series. The show ran for over three decades, from 1932 to 1955 on radio, and from 1950 to 1965 on television. It won numerous awards, including the 1959 and 1961 Emmy Awards for Best Comedy Series, and is generally regarded as a high-water mark in 20th-century American comedy.

Throughout his career, Jack Benny played the same character: A pompous, vain, and stingy man who played the violin badly but was convinced of his own talent. Although technically the star of his show, Benny was constantly the butt of jokes from his cast members, including Mary Livingstone (Sayde Marks Benny, his real-life wife); Phil Harris, his band leader; Kenny Baker or Dennis Day, his tenors; Don Wilson, his portly announcer; and Rochester Van Jones (Eddie Anderson), his African American valet.

As radio historian John Dunning explains, &quot;Unlike Bob Hope, Jack Benny didn&#x27;t &quot;tell&quot; jokes. On his show, Jack &quot;was&quot; the joke. Everything revolved around him and his comic foibles, with Benny serving as &#x27;straight man.&#x27; The other characters on the show were the comedians, making wisecracks, remarks, and asides about Benny&#x27;s stinginess, his vanity, or his lousy violin-playing.&quot;

== Format ==
On both television and radio, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; used a loose show-within-a-show format, wherein the main characters were playing versions of themselves. The show often broke the fourth wall, with the characters interacting with the audience and commenting on the program and its advertisements.

In his first years on radio (c. 1932–1935), Jack Benny followed the format of many other radio comedians, standing at the microphone, telling jokes and stories, and introducing band numbers. As the characters of Jack and his cast became more defined, the show took on a &quot;variety show&quot; format, blending sketch comedy and musical interludes.

The show usually opened with announcer Don Wilson doing a commercial for the sponsor (e.g. Jell-O or Grape Nuts Flakes), accompanied by a musical number from the orchestra. Wilson would then introduce Jack Benny as the &quot;Master of Ceremonies&quot; and banter with him. Gradually, the rest of the cast members—including Mary Livingstone, bandleader Phil Harris, and tenor Kenny Baker or Dennis Day—would &quot;walk on&quot; to join the conversation. The banter between Benny and the regulars generally covered the news of the day, Jack&#x27;s latest exchange in his ongoing feud with Fred Allen, or one of the running jokes on the program, such as Jack&#x27;s stinginess, his age, or his vanity, Phil&#x27;s habitual drunkenness, egotism, or illiteracy, Don&#x27;s obesity, Dennis&#x27;s stupidity, or Mary&#x27;s letters from her mother.

As the show progressed, Jack might be interrupted by a phone call from his valet, Rochester (Eddie Anderson), reporting some problem at Benny&#x27;s home (e.g. with Jack&#x27;s pet polar bear, Carmichael, or with his crazy wartime boarder, Mr. Billingsley). Occasionally, Andy Devine or the Jewish character, Schlepperman (Sam Hearn), would make an appearance. At some point, Jack would tell the tenor that it was time for their singing number (&quot;Sing, Kenny!&quot; or &quot;Dennis, let&#x27;s have your song.&quot;). Don Wilson would insert another commercial for the sponsor, and the band would do a &quot;Big Band&quot; number (ostensibly led by Phil Harris, although conductor Mahlon Merrick actually led the band).

The second half of the show would be devoted to a comedy sketch. Jack might leave the studio and go home to handle some problem (e.g. getting Carmichael to take his medicine). Or there would be a miniplay (e.g., &quot;Buck Benny Rides Again&quot; or a murder mystery starring Jack as Police Captain O&#x27;Benny), or a satire of a current movie (e.g., &quot;Snow White and the Seven Gangsters&quot;). In some episodes, Jack closed the show with brief instructions to his band leader (&quot;Play, Phil.&quot;), and the band would play a final musical number, as Don Wilson did a final commercial.

Over the years, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; evolved into the modern domestic situation comedy form, crafting particular situations and scenarios from the fictionalized life of Jack Benny, the radio star. For example, an entire show might be devoted to Jack taking a violin lesson, instructed by his harried violin teacher, Professor LeBlanc (played by Mel Blanc). Common situations included hosting parties, nights on the town, income-tax time, contract negotiations, &quot;backstage&quot; interactions between Jack and his cast during show rehearsals at the radio studio, traveling in the Maxwell, or traveling by train or plane to and from Jack&#x27;s many personal appearances throughout the country (hence the &quot;Train leaving on track five&quot; running gag).

The sitcom shows usually opened at Jack&#x27;s house in Beverly Hills, with Jack handling some common domestic task (e.g. Spring cleaning or organizing the pantry), with help from Rochester. As the show progressed, Jack would receive visits or phone calls from Mary Livingstone, Phil Harris or Bob Crosby (who replaced Harris as the radio show&#x27;s &quot;band leader&quot; in 1952), and Dennis Day. Following an exchange with Day, Benny would order him to &quot;rehearse&quot; a song (&quot;Let&#x27;s hear the song that you&#x27;re going to sing on my show tomorrow night.&quot;), and Dennis would sing a number. Don Wilson would bring the Sportsmen Quartet over to Jack&#x27;s house, to sing a new commercial for the sponsor, Lucky Strike Cigarettes, to Benny&#x27;s consternation.

Later in the show, Jack might step out to handle some common errand, such as going to the dentist, or visiting a store to buy a new suit, where the dentist or store clerk would inevitably turn out to be Frank Nelson. While on these errands, he might encounter Mr. Kitzel (Artie Auerbach), the race track tout (Sheldon Leonard) or John L.C. Sivoney (Frank Fontaine). In other shows, Jack might fall asleep while reading a book in his study (e.g. &quot;I Stand Condemned&quot; or &quot;The Search for the Elephant&#x27;s Graveyard&quot;), and dream that he was the star of the story he was reading.

In the 1950s, as &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; gravitated to television, the &quot;domestic sitcom&quot; became the show&#x27;s standard format, often with Benny introducing the episode onstage. Scripts and storylines from radio show episodes were re-used and adapted for TV episodes, with the writers using visual gags and settings (e.g. Jack&#x27;s underground vault) that had previously been described on air and left to the radio listeners&#x27; imaginations.

==Radio==

Jack Benny first appeared on radio as a guest of Ed Sullivan in March 1932. He was then given his own show later that year, with Canada Dry Ginger Ale as a sponsor – &quot;The Canada Dry Ginger Ale Program&quot;, beginning May 2, 1932, on the NBC Blue Network and continuing there for six months until October 26, moving the show to CBS on October 30. With Ted Weems leading the band, Benny stayed on CBS until January 26, 1933.

Arriving at NBC on March 3, Benny did &quot;The Chevrolet Program&quot; until April 1, 1934, with Frank Black leading the band. He continued with &quot;The General Tire Revue&quot; for the rest of that season, and in the fall of 1934, for General Foods as &quot;The Jell-O Program Starring Jack Benny&quot; (1934–42), and when sales of Jell-O were affected by sugar rationing during World War II, &quot;The Grape Nuts Flakes Program Starring Jack Benny&quot; (later the &quot;Grape Nuts and Grape Nuts Flakes Program&quot;) (1942–44).

On October 1, 1944, the show became &quot;The Lucky Strike Program Starring Jack Benny&quot;, when American Tobacco&#x27;s Lucky Strike cigarettes took over as his radio sponsor, through to the mid-1950s. By that time, the practice of using the sponsor&#x27;s name as the title began to fade.

The show returned to CBS on January 2, 1949, as part of CBS president William S. Paley&#x27;s &quot;raid&quot; of NBC talent in 1948–49. There it stayed for the remainder of its radio run, which ended on May 22, 1955. CBS aired repeats of previous 1953–55 radio episodes from 1956 to 1958 as &quot;The Best of Benny&quot; for State Farm Insurance, which later sponsored his television program from 1960 through 1965.

In October, 1934, General Foods agreed to take up sponsorship from the struggling tire-maker, using the show (now airing on the Blue network) to promote its low-selling Jell-O desserts. Beginning from this point, Benny was heard Sunday evenings at 7, at the time seen as a &quot;graveyard slot&quot;. However, this was eventually associated with Benny, who appeared in that very time spot for his remaining 21 years on radio (counting his TV shows, he would broadcast on Sundays for a record 28 consecutive years).

In the fall of 1935, Don Bestor was replaced by Johnny Green as the maestro, while Parker was replaced by Michael Bartlett, who himself left after 13 weeks, with Kenny Baker taking over. In early 1936, Harry Conn left the program after creative conflicts with Benny, who had to resort to vaudeville writers Al Boasberg and Edmund Beloin through the end of the season.

In 1936, after a few years of broadcasting from New York, Benny moved the show to Los Angeles, allowing him to bring in guests from among his show-business friends, including Frank Sinatra, James Stewart, Judy Garland, Barbara Stanwyck, Bing Crosby, Burns and Allen (George Burns was Benny&#x27;s closest friend), and many others. Burns, Allen, and Orson Welles guest-hosted several episodes in March and April 1943 when Benny was ill with pneumonia, while Ronald Colman and his wife Benita Hume appeared often in the 1940s as Benny&#x27;s long-suffering neighbors.

The 1936–37 season brought many changes instrumental to the development of the show. Aside from having a new writing team (Beloin and Bill Morrow, with script doctoring by Boasberg), Benny returned to the NBC Red Network and established the program in Hollywood. Benny had already done a number of shows on the West Coast for two yearsfeaturing Jimmie Grier as guest conductorwhenever he was doing movie work. Green was replaced by Phil Harris.

During this period, the Benny character gradually became that of the vain, miserly, untalented performer for which he would be recognized, while the &quot;ditzy&quot; role went from Mary to Kenny, and Don Wilson would become the target of jokes about his weight. Halfway through the season, the famous &quot;feud&quot; with Fred Allen began, climaxing with a visit to New York, after which Eddie Anderson was cast as a porter for the train trip back to Los Angeles. His character was so well received that it was decided to have Anderson join the cast as Rochester Van Jones, Benny&#x27;s valet. In 1939, Kenny Baker chose to leave the show and was replaced by Dennis Day.

In 1941, NBC celebrated Benny&#x27;s 10th anniversary in radio in an unprecedented manner, broadcasting part of a banquet dedicated to him, in which the network conceded the Sunday 7:00 to 7:30 pm slot to Benny instead of the sponsor, as it was the custom during the Golden Age of Radio.

In 1942, due to sugar shortages during war time, General Foods switched their sponsor product from Jell-O to Grape-Nuts. World War II affected the show as Harris joined the Merchant Marines, being absent from the program from December 1942 until March 1943. That fall, Morrow joined the Army and Beloin left the show; they were replaced by Milt Josefsberg, John Tackaberry, George Balzer, and Cy Howard, the latter of whom was soon replaced by Sam Perrin. The new writers emphasized sitcom situations instead of the film parodies prevalent in earlier years. Also during this time, Hilliard Marks, the brother of Benny&#x27;s wife, Mary Livingstone, became the show&#x27;s full-time producer.

In early 1944, Dennis Day enlisted in the Navy, not returning until 1946. He was temporarily replaced by tenor Larry Stevens. In October, 1944, after 10 years with General Foods, American Tobacco&#x27;s Lucky Strike became Benny&#x27;s sponsor, an association that lasted until 1959.

The show switched networks to CBS on January 2, 1949, as part of CBS president William S. Paley&#x27;s notorious &quot;raid&quot; on NBC talent in 1948–49. It stayed there for the remainder of its radio run, ending on May 22, 1955. In 1952, Harris was replaced by Bob Crosby. CBS aired repeat episodes from 1956 to 1958 as &quot;The Best of Benny&quot;.

=== Sponsors ===
In the early days of radio and in the early television era, airtime was owned by the sponsor, and Benny incorporated the commercials into the body of the show. Sometimes, the sponsors were the butt of jokes, though Benny did not use this device as frequently as his friend and &quot;rival&quot; Fred Allen did then, or as cast member Phil Harris later did on his successful radio sitcom. Nevertheless, for years, Benny insisted in contract negotiations that his writers pen the sponsor&#x27;s commercial in the middle of the program (leaving the sponsor to provide the opening and closing spots) and the resulting ads were cleverly and wittily worked into the storyline of the show. For example, on one program, Don Wilson accidentally misread Lucky Strike&#x27;s slogan (&quot;Be happy, go Lucky&quot;) as &quot;Be Lucky, go happy&quot;, prompting a story arc over several weeks that had Wilson unable to appear on the show due to being traumatized by the error.

In fact, the radio show was generally not announced as &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;. Instead, the primary name of the show tied to the sponsor. Benny&#x27;s first sponsor was Canada Dry Ginger Ale from 1932 to 1933. Benny&#x27;s sponsors included Chevrolet from 1933 to 1934, General Tire in 1934, and Jell-O from 1934 to 1942.

&quot;The Jell-O Program Starring Jack Benny&quot; was so successful in selling Jell-O, that General Foods could not manufacture it quickly enough when sugar shortages arose in the early years of World War II, and the company stopped advertising the dessert mix. General Foods switched the Benny program from Jell-O to Grape-Nuts from 1942 to 1944, and it was &quot;The Grape Nuts Program Starring Jack Benny&quot;. Benny&#x27;s longest-running sponsor, was the American Tobacco Company&#x27;s Lucky Strike cigarettes, from 1944 to 1955, when the show was usually announced as &quot;The Lucky Strike Program starring Jack Benny&quot;.

=== Writers ===
Benny employed a small group of writers, most of whom stayed with him for many years. This was in contrast to many successful radio or television comedians, such as Bob Hope, who changed writers frequently. One of Benny&#x27;s writers, George Balzer, noted: &quot;One of the nice things about writing for Jack Benny was that he never denied your existence. On the contrary, he publicized itnot just in conversations, but in interviews and on the air.&quot;

Historical accounts like those by longtime Benny writer Milt Josefsberg indicate that Benny&#x27;s role was essentially as head writer and director of his radio programs, though he was not credited in either capacity. In contrast to Fred Allen, who initially wrote his own radio scripts and extensively rewrote scripts produced in later years by a writing staff, Jack Benny was often described by his writers as a consummate comedy editor rather than a writer &quot;per se&quot;. George Burns described Benny as &quot;the greatest editor of material in the business. He&#x27;s got the knack of cutting out all the weak slush and keeping in only the strong, punchy lines.&quot;

Jack Benny has a reputation as a master of timing. Since his days in radio, he often explored the limits of timing for comedic purposes, like pausing a disproportionate amount of time before answering a question. Balzer described writing material for Benny as similar to composing music, with one element being the rhythm of delivery as equivalent to musical tempo.

=== Theme music ===
During his early radio shows, no recurring theme was used, with the program instead opening each week with a different then-current popular song. Throughout the Jell-O and Grape-Nuts years, announcer Don Wilson would announce the name of the show, some of the cast, then state &quot;The orchestra opens the program with [name of song].&quot; The orchestra number would continue softly as background for Don Wilson&#x27;s opening commercial.

Starting in the Lucky Strike era, Benny adopted a medley of &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; and &quot;Love in Bloom&quot; as his theme music, opening every show. &quot;Love in Bloom&quot; was later the theme of his television show. His radio shows often ended with the orchestra playing &quot;Hooray for Hollywood&quot;. The TV show ended with one of two bouncy instrumentals written for the show by his musical arranger and conductor, Mahlon Merrick.

Benny sometimes joked about the propriety of &quot;Love in Bloom&quot; as his theme song. On a segment often played in &quot;Tonight Show&quot; retrospectives, Benny talks with Johnny Carson about this. Benny says he has no objections to the song in and of itself, only as &quot;his theme.&quot; Proving his point, he begins reciting the lyrics slowly and deliberately: &quot;Can it be the &quot;trees.&quot; That fill the &quot;breeze&quot;. With rare and magic perfume. Now what the hell has that got to do with &quot;me?&quot;&quot;

===Racial attitudes===
Eddie Anderson was the first black man to have a recurring role in a national radio show, which was significant because at the time, black characters were not uncommonly played by white actors in blackface. Although Eddie Anderson&#x27;s Rochester may be considered a stereotype by some, his attitudes were unusually sardonic for such a role. As was typical at the time in depicting class distinctions, Rochester always used a formal mode of address to the other (White) characters (&quot;Mr. Benny&quot;, &quot;Miss Livingstone&quot;) and they always used a familiar mode in speaking to him (&quot;Rochester&quot;), but the formal mode when speaking to him about another White character (&quot;Mr. Benny&quot; when speaking to Rochester but &quot;Jack&quot; when speaking to Jack).

In many routines, Rochester gets the better of Benny, often pricking his boss&#x27; ego, or simply outwitting him. The show&#x27;s portrayal of black characters could be seen as advanced for its time. In a 1956 episode, African American actor Roy Glenn plays a friend of Rochester&#x27;s, and he is portrayed as a well-educated, articulate man not as the typical &quot;darkie stereotype&quot; seen in many films of the time.

Glenn&#x27;s role was a recurring one on the series, where he was often portrayed as having to support two people on one unemployment check (i.e., himself and Rochester). Black talent was also showcased, with several guest appearances by The Ink Spots and others. Once, when Benny and his cast and crew were doing a series of shows in New York, the entire cast, including Eddie Anderson, stayed in a prominent New York hotel. Shortly after they decamped at the hotel, a manager told Benny that some White guests from Mississippi had complained to him about Anderson staying in the hotel. He asked Benny to please &quot;do something about it.&quot; Benny assured him that he would fix the matter. That evening, Benny moved all his people into another hotel, where Anderson would not be made to feel unwelcome. Jack Benny was a man of serious integrity.

=== Line flubs ===
In the Golden Age of Radio, line flubs were common during live broadcasts, especially on a show like &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, which used sophisticated humor and complex, well-written scripts. When they happened, Jack would laugh along with the audience, ad lib a joke or two, and continue on with the show, although the line flubs clearly annoyed him. When Eddie Anderson, who had a habit of missing rehearsals, would flub his lines on the air, Jack would sometimes shout in mock indignation, &quot;Just &quot;one&quot; rehearsal! That&#x27;s &quot;all&quot; I ask!&quot;

As professional as he was, even Jack himself was not immune to flubs. On the November 6, 1949 episode, in a sketch where he was on a yacht cruise, Jack told the boat captain that he had been &quot;on the Navy&quot; during World War I, instead of &quot;in the Navy.&quot; The episode featured so many line flubs that the following week&#x27;s episode, November 13, was built around Jack calling a meeting of his cast to discuss their mistakes in the previous week&#x27;s episode.

Mary Livingstone had several flubs that became notorious running gags for weeks after they happened. On the October 27, 1946 episode, during a lunch counter sketch, Mary mistakenly ordered a &quot;chiss sweeze sandwich,&quot; instead of a &quot;Swiss cheese sandwich.&quot; On the December 3, 1950 episode, Jack told the story of how he met his valet, Rochester. According to Jack, he was driving his car, made a turn into a garage owned by Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy, and accidentally hit Rochester&#x27;s car – while it was up on the grease rack. At the end of the show, Mary asked Jack, &quot;How could you possibly hit a car when it was up on the grass reek?&quot;

Unfortunately, these line flubs may have contributed to Mary Livingstone developing a bad case of &quot;mike fright.&quot; In the radio show&#x27;s final years (1952–1955), Mary&#x27;s character appeared less and less. When the show was transcribed (pre-recorded), Mary&#x27;s daughter, Joan Benny, would fill in for her mother when the cast recorded the episode in front of a live studio audience, and Mary would later dub in her lines from the safety of her living room at home.

On the broadcast of January 8, 1950, journalist Drew Pearson was the subject of a joke gone wrong. Announcer Don Wilson was supposed to say he heard that Jack bought a new suit on Drew Pearson&#x27;s broadcast, but accidentally said &quot;Dreer Pooson&quot;. Later in the show, comedic actor Frank Nelson was asked by Benny if he was the doorman. Changing his original response at the suggestion of the writers, Nelson said, &quot;Well, who do you think I am, Dreer Pooson?&quot; The audience laughed for almost 30 seconds. (According to several sources on the show, including writer Sam Perrin, Jack collapsed in laughter on hearing Nelson&#x27;s ad lib, and it was several minutes before he could continue. On the recording of the January 8, 1950 episode, Jack&#x27;s laughter is not heard. However, since the show was transcribed, it may have been edited out of the final broadcast.)

The line flubs would occasionally cause the show to run overtime. When this happened, Jack would cut the &quot;coda joke&quot; at the end of the episode, and sign off with the customary statement, &quot;We&#x27;re a little late, so good night, folks.&quot;

=== Running gags ===

Benny teamed with Fred Allen for the best-remembered running gag in classic radio history, in terms of character dialogue. Benny alone sustained a classic repertoire of running gags in his own right, though, including his skinflint radio and television persona, regular cast members&#x27; and guest stars&#x27; reference to his &quot;baby blue&quot; eyes, always sure to elicit a self-satisfied smirk or patently false attempt at modesty from Benny, perpetually giving his age as 39, and ineptitude at violin playing, most frequently demonstrated by futile attempts to perform Rodolphe Kreutzer&#x27;s Étude No. 2 in C major.

In fact, Benny was a quite good violinist who achieved the illusion of a bad one, not by deliberately playing poorly, but by striving to play pieces that were too difficult for his skill level. In one of his show&#x27;s skits, Benny is a USO performer in the Pacific playing his violin when he comes under fire; Benny still plays his violin when two Japanese surrender to himall the other enemy soldiers committed suicide rather than endure listening to Benny&#x27;s terrible music.

A skit heard numerous times on radio, and seen many times on television, had Mel Blanc as a Mexican in a sombrero and serape sitting on a bench. Jack Benny sits down and begins a conversation. To each question asked by Benny, Blanc replies &quot;Sí&quot;. When Benny asks his name, Blanc replies &quot;Sy&quot;, which would prompt the exchange, &quot;Sy?&quot;, &quot;Sí.&quot; And when Benny asks where Blanc is going, Blanc replies, &quot;to see his sister&quot;, &quot;Sue&quot; (&quot;Sue?&quot;, &quot;Sí.&quot;), who of course &quot;sews&quot; for a living (&quot;Sew?&quot;, &quot;Sí.&quot;).

A running gag was Benny age always being 39a guest on the show was Rod Serling who is the mayor of a town where no one recognizes Benny; Jack runs off screaming for help while Serling breaks the fourth wall and remarks to the audience that anyone who has been 39 for as long as Benny has is a resident of this &quot;Zone&quot; (i.e., Twilight Zone).

A running gag in Benny&#x27;s private life concerned George Burns. To Benny&#x27;s eternal frustration, he could never get Burns to laugh. Burns, though, could crack Benny up with the least effort. An example of this occurred at a party when Benny pulled out a match to light a cigar. Burns announced to all, &quot;Jack Benny will now perform the famous match trick!&quot; Benny had no idea what Burns was talking about, so he proceeded to light up. Burns observed, &quot;Oh, a new ending!&quot; and Benny collapsed in helpless laughter.
Benny even had a sound-based running gag of his own: his famous basement vault alarm, allegedly installed by Spike Jones, ringing off with a shattering cacophony of whistles, sirens, bells, and blasts before ending invariably with the sound of a foghorn. The alarm rang even when Benny opened his safe with the correct combination. The vault also featured a guard named Ed (voiced by Joseph Kearns) who had been on post down below, apparently, before the end of the Civil War, the end of the Revolutionary War, the founding of Los Angeles, on Jack&#x27;s 38th birthday and even the beginning of humanity.

In one appearance, Ed asked Benny, &quot;By the way, Mr. Benny ... what&#x27;s it like on the outside?&quot; Benny responded, &quot;... winter is nearly here, and the leaves are falling.&quot; Ed responded, &quot;Hey, that must be exciting,&quot; to which Benny replied (in a stunningly risqué joke for the period), &quot;Oh, nopeople are wearing clothes now.&quot;

In one episode of the Benny radio show, Ed the Guard actually agreed when Benny invited him to take a break and come back to the surface world, only to discover that modern conveniences and transportation, which had not been around the last time he had been to the surface, terrorized and confused him. (Ed thought a crosstown bus was &quot;a red and yellow dragon&quot;.) Finally, Ed decides to return to his post fathoms below and stay there. The basement vault gag was also used in the cartoon &quot;The Mouse that Jack Built&quot; and an episode of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;.

A separate sound gag involved a song Benny had written, &quot;When You Say I Beg Your Pardon, Then I&#x27;ll Come Back to You&quot;. Its inane lyrics and insipid melody guaranteed that it would never be published or recorded, but Benny continued to try to con, extort, or otherwise inveigle some of his musical guests (including The Smothers Brothers and Peter, Paul and Mary) to perform it. However, none ever made it all the way.

In keeping with his &quot;stingy&quot; schtick, on one of his television specials he remarked that, to his way of looking at things, a &quot;special&quot; is when the price of coffee is marked down.

==== The orchestra ====
Another popular running gag concerned the social habits of Benny&#x27;s on-air orchestra, who were consistently portrayed as a bunch of drunken ne&#x27;er-do-wells. Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby, the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being too drunk to play properly, using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show and so enamored of liquor that the sight of a glass of milk would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who had found him passed out in the street at 4 am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.

Crosby also got consistent laughs by frequently joking about his more famous brother Bing Crosby&#x27;s vast wealth.

==== Christmas shopping ====
One popular scenario that became a tradition on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; was the annual &quot;Christmas Shopping&quot; episode, in which Benny would go to a local department store to do his shopping. Each year, Benny would buy a ridiculously cheap Christmas gift for Don Wilson, from a harried store clerk played by Mel Blanc. Benny would then drive Blanc to insanity by exchanging the gift countless times throughout the episode.

In the 1946 Christmas episode, for example, Benny buys shoelaces for Don, and is unable to make up his mind whether to give Wilson shoelaces with plastic tips or metal tips. After exchanging them repeatedly, Mel Blanc is heard screaming insanely, &quot;Plastic tips! Metal tips! I can&#x27;t stand it anymore!&quot;

A variation in 1948 was with an expensive wallet, but repeatedly changing the greeting card, prompting Blanc to shout, &quot;I haven&#x27;t run into anyone like you in 20 years! Oh, why did the governor have to give me that pardon!?&quot; Benny then realizes that he should have gotten Don a wallet for $1.98, whereupon the store clerk responds by committing suicide.

Over the years, in the Christmas episodes, Benny bought and repeatedly exchanged cuff links, golf tees, a box of dates, a paint set (water colors or oils), and a gopher trap. In later years, Benny would encounter Mel Blanc&#x27;s wife (played by Jean Vander Pyl or Bea Benaderet) or the clerk&#x27;s psychiatrist at the store, and drive them crazy, as well.

One Christmas program had Crosby agonizing over what to get Remley: Benny: &quot;Well, why don&#x27;t you get him a cordial; like a bottle of Drambuie?&quot; Crosby: &quot;That&#x27;s a nice thought, Jack, but Drambuie&#x27;s an after-dinner drink.&quot; Benny: &quot;So?&quot; Crosby: &quot;So Remley never quite makes it &#x27;til after dinner.&quot;

==== The Maxwell ====

Starting with the October 24, 1937, radio show, when Jack proudly announced the purchase of his car, a running joke began that Benny drove an old Maxwell automobile, a brand that went out of business in 1925. Although some details such as the car&#x27;s body style and its exact model year varied over the years, what remained constant was that Benny&#x27;s old car was so worn out that it would barely run, but the miserly Benny insisted he could get a few more miles out of it.

Many of the sound effects for the car&#x27;s clattering engine came from an actual old motor that the sound-effects shop had salvaged from a Los Angeles junkyard. When a sound-effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine, Mel Blanc quickly improvised a vocal imitation of a sputtering car engine starting up noisily that was so funny, it became a regular feature of the show.

The ongoing saga of the Maxwell was initially interrupted after just five years, when on the October 18, 1942, broadcast, Jack took his car to a local junkyard and contributed it to the World War II junk salvage drive, receiving $7.50 in war stamps in exchange. However, much of the radio audience may have remained unaware that the Maxwell was ever gone, because before long Benny was heard traveling around in a decrepit old car again, and by the end of the 1940s, his car was once more specifically identified as a Maxwell.

When the &quot;Jack Benny Program&quot; premiered on television in 1950, a 1916 Maxwell Model 25 Tourer became one of the production&#x27;s standard props. Benny&#x27;s Maxwell later became a 1923 Tourer. Benny often made public appearances in Maxwells. He drove a Maxwell onto the stage in one of his last television specials.

By 1941, Jack Benny&#x27;s Maxwell had become such a well-known aspect of popular culture that it was referenced in the Billy Mills song &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with the Sound Effects Man&quot; as heard on the June 17, 1941, &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; radio show and later performed on a 1943 recording by Spike Jones. The automobile was also featured in the 1943 Benny film &quot;The Meanest Man in the World&quot;. Benny and his archaic auto were featured in a series of television and print ads for Texaco from the 1950s through the 1970s.

A series of gags was built around the premise that Benny appreciated the value of Sky Chief brand gasoline in keeping his car running smoothly, but was too cheap to buy more than one gallon at a time. In the classic cartoon &quot;The Mouse that Jack Built&quot;, Benny and his wife are driven by Rochester in a sputtering Maxwell car. In another gag Benny comes home and Rochester reports that he has just reported to the Police that the Maxwell was stolen 3 hours after it happened. When Benny asks why he waited so long, Rochester replies that it was when he stopped laughing.

Many people believe that Benny appears behind the wheel of his Maxwell in the 1963 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, but in fact, it was a 1932 Cadillac. The long shots for the scene were shot months before Benny was castwith a stunt driver at the wheeland the role was intended for Stan Laurel (which is why the character wears a derby, which Benny almost never did). When Laurel ultimately passed on appearing, Jack agreed to play the role. According to the commentary on the Criterion edition of the film, his close-ups were filmed on a rear-projection stage at the Paramount studio.

==== The BennyAllen feud ====
On April 5, 1936, Benny began his famous radio feud with rival Fred Allen when he satirized Allen&#x27;s show.Allen kicked the feud off on his own show on December 30, 1936, after child violinist Stuart Canin gave a performance of François Schubert&#x27;s &quot;The Bee&quot; credibly enough that Allen wisecracked about &quot;a certain alleged violinist&quot; who should by comparison be ashamed of himself. Benny, who listened to the Allen show, answered in kind at the end of his January 3, 1937, show, and the two comedians were off and running.

For a decade, the two went at it back and forth, so convincingly that fans of either show could have been forgiven for believing they had become blood enemies. In reality, the two men were close friends and mutual admirers. Benny and Allen often appeared on each other&#x27;s show during the ongoing feud; numerous surviving episodes of both comedians&#x27; radio shows feature each other, in both acknowledged guest spots and occasional cameos. On one Christmas program, Allen thanked Benny for sending him a Christmas tree, but then added that the tree had died. &quot;Well, what do you expect,&quot; quipped Allen, &quot;when the tree is in Brooklyn and the sap is in Hollywood.&quot;

Benny in his memoir (&quot;Sunday Nights at Seven&quot;) and Allen in his &quot;Treadmill to Oblivion&quot; later revealed that each comedian&#x27;s writing staff often met together to plot future takes on the mock feud. If Allen zapped Benny with a satirization of Benny&#x27;s show (&quot;The Pinch Penny Program&quot;), Benny shot back with a parody of Allen&#x27;s &quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot; called &quot;&quot;Clown&quot; Hall Tonight&quot;, and their playful sniping (&quot;Benny was born ignorant, and he&#x27;s been losing ground ever since&quot;) was also advanced in the films &quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s in the Bag!&quot;.

Perhaps the climax of the feud came during Fred Allen&#x27;s parody of popular quiz-and-prize show &quot;Queen for a Day&quot;. Calling the sketch &quot;King for a Day&quot;, Allen played the host and Benny a contestant who sneaked onto the show using the alias Myron Proudfoot. Benny answered the prize-winning question correctly and Allen crowned him &quot;king&quot; and showered him with a passel of almost meaningless prizes.

Allen proudly announced, &quot;Tomorrow night, in your ermine robe, you will be whisked by bicycle to Orange, New Jersey, where you will be the judge in a chicken-cleaning contest,&quot; to which Benny joyously declared, &quot;I&#x27;m &quot;king&quot; for a day!&quot; At this point a professional pressing-iron was wheeled on stage, to press Benny&#x27;s suit properly. It didn&#x27;t matter that Benny was still &quot;in&quot; the suit. Allen instructed his aides to remove Benny&#x27;s suit, one item at a time, ending with his trousers, each garment&#x27;s removal provoking louder laughter from the studio audience.

As his trousers began to come off, Benny howled, &quot;Allen, you haven&#x27;t seen the &quot;end&quot; of me!&quot; At once Allen shot back, &quot;It won&#x27;t be long &quot;now!&quot;&quot; The laughter was so loud and chaotic at the chain of events that the Allen show announcer, Kenny Delmar, was cut off the air while trying to read a final commercial and the show&#x27;s credits. (Allen was notorious for running overtime often enough, largely thanks to his ad-libbing talent, and he overran the clock again this time.)

Benny was profoundly shaken when in 1956 Allen suddenly died at age 61 from a heart attack. In a statement released on the day after Allen&#x27;s death, Benny said, &quot;People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life. My answer is always the same: You couldn&#x27;t have such a long-running and successful feud as we did, without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it.&quot; Allen himself wrote, &quot;For years people have been asking me if Jack and I are friendly. I don&#x27;t think that Jack Benny has an enemy in the world. ... He is my favorite comedian and I hope to be his friend until he is forty. That will be forever.&quot;

=== Preservation ===
The radio series was one of the most extensively preserved programs of its era, with the archive almost complete from 1936 onward and several episodes existing from before that (including the 1932 premiere). 

A few episodes from the series&#x27; later years remain missing, however, such as the shows from September 30 and October 7, 1951.

The March 28, 1948 episode of the radio series was chosen by the Library of Congress as a 2004 selection for preservation in the National Recording Registry.

==Television==
Jack Benny made his TV debut in 1949 with a local appearance on Los Angeles station KTTV, then a CBS affiliate. On October 28, 1950, he made his full network debut over CBS Television.

The regular and continuing &quot;Jack Benny Program&quot; was telecast on CBS from October 28, 1950, to September 15, 1964. Benny&#x27;s television shows were occasional broadcasts in his early seasons on TV, as he was still firmly dedicated to radio. It became a bi-weekly show in the 1954–55 season, then a weekly show in the 1960–1961 season, and moved to NBC for its final season, airing from September 25, 1964, to September 10, 1965.

343 episodes were produced. His TV sponsors included American Tobacco&#x27;s Lucky Strike (1950–59), Lever Brothers&#x27; Lux (1959–60), State Farm Insurance (1960–65), Lipton Tea (1960–62), General Foods&#x27; Jell-O (1962–64), and Miles Laboratories (1964–65).

The television show was a seamless continuation of Benny&#x27;s radio program, employing many of the same players, the same approach to situation comedy, and some of the same scripts. The suffix &quot;Program&quot; instead of &quot;Show&quot; was also a carryover from radio, where &quot;program&quot; rather than &quot;show&quot; was used frequently for presentations in the nonvisual medium. Occasionally, in several live episodes, the title card read &quot;The Jack Benny Show&quot;.

The &quot;Jack Benny Program&quot; appeared infrequently during its first two years on CBS-TV. Benny moved into television slowly. In his first season (1950–1951), he only performed on four shows, but by the 1951–1952 season, he was ready to do one show roughly every six weeks. In the third season (1952–1953), the show was broadcast every four weeks. During the 1953–1954 season, the &quot;Jack Benny Program&quot; aired every three weeks.

From 1954 to 1960, the program aired every other week, rotating with such shows as &quot;Private Secretary&quot; and &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;. After the radio show ended in 1955, Benny took on another biweekly series, becoming a regular on &quot;Shower of Stars&quot;, CBS&#x27;s hourlong comedy/variety anthology series. He effectively appeared almost every week on one of the two series. On &quot;Shower of Stars&quot;, Benny&#x27;s character finally turned 40, throwing a large birthday party for the occasion.

Beginning in the 1960–1961 season, the &quot;Jack Benny Program&quot; began airing every week. The show moved from CBS to NBC prior to the 1964–65 season. During the 1953–54 season, a few episodes were filmed during the summer and the others were live, a schedule that allowed Benny to continue doing his radio show. In the 1953–1954 season, Dennis Day had his own short-lived comedy and variety show on NBC, &quot;The Dennis Day Show&quot;, which was a continuation of his early stint on &quot;The RCA Victor Show&quot;, on which he had begun appearing on an alternate-week basis beginning in early 1952.

Live episodes (and later live-on-tape episodes) of the &quot;Jack Benny Program&quot; were broadcast from CBS Television City with live audiences. Early filmed episodes were shot by McCadden Productions at Hollywood Center Studios and later by Desilu Productions at Red Studios Hollywood with an audience brought in to watch the finished film for live responses. Benny&#x27;s opening and closing monologues were filmed in front of a live audience. From the late 1950s until the last season on NBC, though, a laugh track was used to augment audience responses. By this time, all shows were filmed at Universal Television.

In Jim Bishop&#x27;s book &quot;A Day in the Life of President Kennedy&quot;, John F. Kennedy said that he was too busy to watch most television, but that he made the time to watch the &quot;Jack Benny Program&quot; each week.

Outside of North America (being also one of the most popular shows on the CBC), one episode reportedly aired first in the United Kingdom (where one episode was filmed). Benny had also been a familiar figure in Australia since the mid- to late 1930s with his radio show, and he made a special program for ATN-7 &quot;Jack Benny In Australia&quot; in March 1964, after a successful tour of Sydney and Melbourne.

=== End ===
James T. Aubrey, the president of CBS Television and a man known for his abrasive and judgmental decision-making style, infamously told Benny in 1963, &quot;you&#x27;re through.&quot; Benny was further incensed when CBS placed an untested new sitcom, the &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot; spinoff &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, as his lead in. Benny had had a strong ratings surge the previous year when his series was moved to Tuesday nights with the popular &quot;Red Skelton Hour&quot; in the time slot prior to his.

He feared a separation of their two programs might prove fatal. Early that fall, he announced his show was moving back to NBC, where he was able to get the network to pick up another season. Benny&#x27;s fears proved to be unfounded; his ratings for the 1963–64 season remained strong, while &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; emerged as the most popular new series that fall.

In his unpublished autobiography, &quot;I Always Had Shoes&quot; (portions of which were later incorporated by Benny&#x27;s daughter, Joan, into her memoir of her parents, &quot;Sunday Nights at Seven&quot;), Benny said that he made the decision to end his TV series in 1965. He said that while the ratings were still good (he cited a figure of some 18 million viewers per week, although he qualified that figure by saying he never believed the ratings services were doing anything more than guessing), advertisers complained that commercial time on his show was costing nearly twice as much as what they paid for most other shows, and he had grown tired of what was called the &quot;rat race&quot;.

===Syndication===

As with the radio shows, most of the television series has lapsed into the public domain, although several episodes (particularly those made from 1961 onward, including the entire NBC-TV run) remain under copyright. During his lone NBC season, CBS aired repeats on weekdays and Sunday afternoons. 104 episodes personally selected by Benny and Irving Fein, Benny&#x27;s associate since 1947, were placed into syndication in 1968 by MCA TV. Telecasts of the shows in the late evening were running as late as 1966.

Four early-1960s episodes were rerun on CBS during the summer of 1977. Edited 16mm prints ran on the CBN Cable Network in the mid-1980s. Restored versions first appeared on the short lived HA! network in 1990. As of 2011, the series has run on Antenna TV, part of a long-term official syndication distribution deal. The public domain television episodes have appeared on numerous stations, including PBS, while the radio series episodes have appeared in radio drama anthology series such as &quot;When Radio Was&quot;.

===Home media===
Public-domain episodes have been available on budget VHS/Beta tapes (and later DVDs) since the late 1970s. MCA Home Video issued a 1960 version of the classic &quot;Christmas Shopping&quot; show in 1982 and a VHS set of 10 filmed episodes in 1990. In 2008, 25 public-domain episodes of the show, long thought lost, were located in a CBS vault. The Jack Benny Fan Club, with the blessing of the Benny estate, offered to fund the digital preservation and release of these sealed episodes. CBS issued a press statement that any release was unlikely.

June 2013 had the first official release of 18 rare live Benny programs from 1956 to 1964 by Shout! Factory. This set, part of Benny&#x27;s private collection at the UCLA film and television library, included guest shots by Jack Paar, John Wayne, Tony Curtis, Gary Cooper, Dick Van Dyke, Rock Hudson, Natalie Wood, and President Harry Truman, and the only TV appearance with longtime radio foe Ronald Colman.

=== Television episodes ===

==Cast and characters==
=== Main cast ===
* Jack Benny as himself – The protagonist of the show, Benny is a comic, vain, penny-pinching miser, insisting on remaining 39 years old on stage despite his actual age, and often playing the violin badly.
* Eddie Anderson as Rochester Van Jones, Jack&#x27;s valet and chauffeur – Early in the show&#x27;s run, he often talked of gambling or going out with women. Later on, he complained about his salary.
* Don Wilson as himself – Don generally opened the show and also did the commercials. He was the target of Jack&#x27;s jokes, mostly about his weight.
* Eugene McNulty as Dennis Day – A vocalist perpetually in his 20s (by the time of the last television series, McNulty was 49 years old), he was sweet but not very bright. When called upon, he could use a wide variety of accents, which was especially useful in plays. He usually sang a song about 10 minutes into the program. If the episode was a flashback to a previous time, a ruse would be used such as Dennis singing his song for Jack so he could hear it before the show. McNulty adopted the name &quot;Dennis Day&quot; as his stage name for the rest of his career.
* Sadie Marks as Mary Livingstone – A sarcastic comic foil, her varying roles all served as, to use the description of Fred Allen, &quot;a girl to insult (Jack).&quot; Marks, who in real life was Benny&#x27;s wife, later legally changed her name to &quot;Mary Livingstone&quot; in response to the character&#x27;s popularity. Her role on the program was reduced in the 1950s due to increasing stage fright, and Livingstone finally retired from acting in 1958.
* Phil Harris as himself – A skirt-chasing, arrogant, hip-talking bandleader, he constantly put Jack down (in a mostly friendly way). He referred to Mary as &quot;Livvy&quot; or &quot;Liv&quot;, and Jack as &quot;Jackson&quot;. Harris explained this once by saying it&#x27;s &quot;as close as I can get to jackass and still be polite&quot; Spun off into &quot;The Phil Harris–Alice Faye Show&quot; (1946–1954) with his wife, actress Alice Faye. Harris left the radio show in 1952 and his character did not make the transition to television apart from a guest appearance.
* Mel Blanc as Carmichael the Polar Bear, Professor Pierre LeBlanc, Sy the Mexican, Polly (Jack&#x27;s parrot), the Maxwell, and many other assorted voices – An occasional running gag went along the lines of how the various characters Mel portrayed all looked alike. He was also the sound effects of Jack&#x27;s barely functional Maxwell automobilea role he played again in the Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;The Mouse that Jack Built&quot;. Another participating voice actor was Bert Gordon. Mel also played a train-station announcer, whose catchphrase was, &quot;Train leaving on Track Five for Anaheim, Azusa, and Cuc-amonga.&quot;
* Frank Nelson as the &quot;Yeeee-essss?&quot; man – He was always the person who waited on Jack wherever he was, from the railroad-station agent, to the store clerk, to the doorman, to the waiter. When Jack asked if he was what he was working as, Frank would respond with a sarcastic quip (In one episode, he had played a floorwalker, and when Jack asked if he was the floorwalker, Frank responded with &quot;Well, what do you think I am with this carnation? A float in the rose parade?&quot;) Frank always delighted in aggravating Jack, as he was apparently constantly aggravated by Jack&#x27;s presence.
* Sheldon Leonard – A racetrack tout (originated by Benny Rubin), he frequently offered unsolicited advice to Benny on a variety of racing-unrelated subjects. Ironically, he never gave out information on horse racing, unless Jack demanded it. One excuse the tout gave was, &quot;Who knows about horses?&quot; His catchphrase was &quot;Hey, bud... c&#x27;mere a minute&quot;.
* Joseph Kearns as Ed, the superannuated security guard in Jack&#x27;s money vault – Ed had allegedly been guarding Jack&#x27;s vault since (variously) the founding of Los Angeles (1781), the American Civil War, the American Revolutionary War, or when Jack had just turned 38 years old. Burt Mustin took over the role on television following Kearns&#x27; death in 1962. (In the 1959 cartoon &quot;The Mouse that Jack Built&quot;, Mel Blanc played the part of Ed, who asks if the U.S. had won the war, then asks what would be done with the Kaiser). Kearns also played other roles, that of Dennis Day&#x27;s father, that of a beleaguered IRS agent, his dentist, and often of a clerk when it was not necessary to have Frank Nelson antagonize Jack.
* Artie Auerbach as Mr. Kitzel – He originally appeared on Al Pearce&#x27;s radio show in the late 1930s, where his famous catch phrase was, &quot;Hmmmm... eh, could be!&quot;, and several years later as a regular on &quot;The Abbott &amp; Costello Show&quot;, who originally started out as a Yiddish hot dog vendor selling hot dogs during the Rose Bowl. In later episodes, he went on to lose his hot dog stand, and move on to various other jobs. A big part of his schtick involved garbling names with his accent, such as referring to Nat King Cole as &quot;Nat King Cohen&quot;, or mentioning his favorite baseball player, &quot;Rabbi Maranville&quot;. He often complained about his wife, an unseen character who was described as a large, domineering woman who, on one occasion, Kitzel visualized as &quot;...from the front, she looks like Don Wilson from the side!&quot; He often sang various permutations of his jingle, &quot;Pickle in the middle and the mustard on top!&quot; Kitzel was often heard to say, &quot;Hoo-hoo-HOO!&quot; in response to questions asked of him.
* Bob Crosby – In 1952, Crosby replaced Phil Harris as the bandleader, remaining until Benny retired the radio show in 1955. In joining the show, he became the leader of the same group of musicians who had played under Harris. Many of his running jokes focused on his apparent inability to pronounce &quot;Manischewitz&quot;, his own family, and the wealth and lifestyle of his older brother, Bing Crosby.
* Benny Rubin – Played a variety of characters on both the radio and television versions. His most memorable bit was as an information-desk attendant. Jack would ask a series of questions that Rubin would answer with an ever-increasingly irritated, &quot;I don&#x27;t know!&quot; followed by the punchline {among them: &quot;Well, if you &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; know, why are you standing behind that counter?&quot;/&quot;I gotta stand behind something; somebody stole my pants!&quot; or &quot;I missed a payment, and they nailed my shoes to the floor!&quot;}.
* Dale White – Harlow Wilson, the son of Don and Lois Wilson, on television. His catchphrase, &quot;You never did like me!&quot;, is usually uttered when Jack and he end up embroiled in an argument, though he once said it to his own mother.
* Verna Felton as Mrs. Lucretia Day, Dennis&#x27; frighteningly domineering mother – She often came to near blows with Jack in her efforts to prevent him from taking advantage of Dennis, and she was often portrayed as working various masculine jobs such as a plumber, trucker, or karate instructor. Although she cares deeply for her son, Dennis&#x27; zany behavior aggravates her to no end, and the show has alluded to her hilariously myriad attempts at killing and abandoning him.
* Bea Benaderet and Sara Berner as Gertrude Gearshift and Mabel Flapsaddle, a pair of telephone switchboard operators – They always traded barbs with Jack (and sometimes each other) when he tried to put through a call. Whenever the scene shifted to them, they subtly plugged a current picture in an insult such as &quot;Mr. Benny&#x27;s line is flashing!&quot; &quot;Oh, I wonder what Dial M for Money wants now?&quot; or &quot;I wonder what Schmoe Vadis wants now?&quot;
* Jane Morgan and Gloria Gordon as Martha and Emily – A pair of elderly ladies, they were irresistibly attracted to Jack.
* Madge Blake and Jesslyn Fax, as television counterparts to Martha and Emily, were the president and vice president, respectively, of the Jack Benny Fan Club, Pasadena chapter.
* Butterfly McQueen played Butterfly, the niece of Rochester. She worked as Mary Livingstone&#x27;s maid.

=== Other cast members include ===
* Ronald Colman and his wife, Benita as themselves – They were among Benny&#x27;s most popular guest stars on the radio series, portraying his long-suffering next-door neighbors. On the show, the Colmans were often revolted by Jack&#x27;s eccentricities and by the fact that he always borrowed odds and ends from them (at one point, leading Ronald to exclaim, &quot;Butter? Butter, butter!!! Where does he think this is, Shangri-La?&quot;). Dennis Day often impersonated Ronald Colman.
* James Stewart and his wife, Gloria as themselves – Recurring guest stars on the television series, they played Benny&#x27;s often-imposed-upon neighbors, in roles similar to those performed by Ronald and Benita Colman.
* Frank Parker was the show&#x27;s singer during the early seasons on radio from New York.
* Kenny Baker – The show&#x27;s tenor singer, he originally played the young, dopey character. He was replaced by Dennis Day.
* Andy Devine – Jack&#x27;s raspy-voiced friend, he lived on a farm with his ma and pa. He usually told a story about his folks and life around the farm. His catchphrase was &quot;Hiya, Buck!&quot;

* Sam Hearn as Schlepperman – A Jewish character, he spoke with a Yiddish accent (his catch phrase: &quot;Hullo, Stranger!&quot;). He would return again as the &quot;Hiya, Rube!&quot; guy, a hick farmer from the town of Calabasas, who always insisted on referring to Jack as &quot;rube&quot;.
* Ed Beloin as Mr. Billingsley – He was Benny&#x27;s polite but eccentric boarder. He appeared in the early 1940s.
* Larry Stevens – A tenor singer, he substituted for Dennis Day from November 1944 to March 1946, when Dennis served in the Navy.
* Mary Kelly  as the Blue Fairy – A clumsy, overweight fairy, she appeared in several storytelling episodes. Kelly had been an old flame of Jack&#x27;s, who had fallen on hard times. Benny was unsure of whether to give Kelly a regular role and instead appealed to friend George Burns, who put her on his show in 1939 as Mary &quot;Bubbles&quot; Kelly, best friend to Gracie.
* Gisele MacKenzie – A singer and violin player, she guest-starred seven times on the program.
* Blanche Stewart  contributed a variety of characters and animal sounds.
* Barry Gordon  played Jack Benny as a child in a skit where Jack played his own father.
* Johnny Green was the band leader until 1936, when Phil Harris joined the show.
* Harry Baldwin  – Jack Benny&#x27;s secretary, who also played &quot;The Knocking Man,&quot; a character who would knock on the door, enter, say something ridiculous, then leave. He also played a variety of other roles.

<doc id="884488" wikidata="Q433417" url="?curid=884488" title="Keith Carradine">
<text>Keith Ian Carradine ( ; born August 8, 1949) is an American actor. In film he is known for his roles as Tom Frank in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot;, E. J. Bellocq in Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;, and Mickey in Alan Rudolph&#x27;s &quot;Choose Me.&quot; On television he is known for his roles as Wild Bill Hickok on the HBO series &quot;Deadwood&quot;, FBI agent Frank Lundy on the Showtime series &quot;Dexter&quot;, Lou Solverson in the first season of FX&#x27;s &quot;Fargo&quot;, Penny&#x27;s father Wyatt on the CBS sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, and U.S. President Conrad Dalton on the CBS political drama &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;.

He is a member of the Carradine family of actors that began with his father, John Carradine.

==Early life==
Carradine was born in San Mateo, California. He is a son of actress and artist Sonia Sorel (née Henius), and actor John Carradine. His full brothers are Christopher and Robert Carradine, both of whom are actors. His paternal half-brothers are Bruce and David Carradine. His maternal half-brother is Michael Bowen. His maternal great-grandfather was biochemist Max Henius, and his maternal great-grandmother was the sister of historian Johan Ludvig Heiberg.

Carradine&#x27;s childhood was troubled; he has said that his father drank and his mother &quot;was a manic depressive paranoid schizophrenic catatonic—she had it all.&quot; His parents divorced in 1957, when he was eight years old. A bitter custody battle led to his father gaining custody of him and his brothers, Christopher and Robert, after the children had spent three months in a home for abused children as wards of the court. Keith said of the experience, &quot;It was like being in jail. There were bars on the windows, and we were only allowed to see our parents through glass doors. It was very sad. We would stand there on either side of the glass door crying.&quot; He was raised in San Mateo primarily by his maternal grandmother, and he rarely saw either of his parents. His mother was not permitted to see him for eight years following the custody settlement.

Carradine attended Ojai Valley School, where he was active in the school&#x27;s theater department, performing in productions of &quot;Aria da Capo&quot; and &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;. After high school, Carradine entertained the thought of becoming a forest ranger, and enrolled at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. &quot;I had this idyllic fantasy of sitting somewhere communing with nature and chatting with the bears,&quot; he recalled, &quot;[but] I didn&#x27;t want to have to learn anything.&quot; He changed his major to drama after enrolling, but dropped out after one semester and returned to California, moving in with his older half-brother, David, who encouraged him to pursue an acting career, paid for his acting and vocal lessons, and helped him get an agent.

==Career==
===Stage===
As a youth, Carradine had opportunities to appear on stage with his father in the latter&#x27;s productions of Shakespeare. Thus, he had some background in theater when he was cast in the original Broadway run of &quot;Hair&quot; (1969), which launched his acting career. In that production he started out in the chorus and worked his way up to the lead roles playing Woof and Claude. He said of his involvement in &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;I really didn&#x27;t plan to audition. I just went along with my brother, David, and his girlfriend at the time, Barbara Hershey, and two of their friends. I was simply going to play the piano for them while they sang, but I&#x27;m the one the staff wound up getting interested in.&quot;

His stage career is further distinguished by his Tony-nominated performance for Best Actor (Musical) as the title character in the Tony Award-winning musical, &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot; in 1991, for which he also received a Drama Desk Award nomination. He won the Outer Critics Circle Award for &quot;Foxfire&quot; with Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, and appeared as Lawrence in &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; at the Imperial Theater. In 2008, he appeared as Dr. Farquhar Off-Broadway in &quot;Mindgame&quot;, a thriller by Antony Horowitz, directed by Ken Russell, who made his New York directorial debut with the production. In March and April 2013, he starred in the Broadway production of &quot;Hands on a Hardbody&quot;. He was nominated for the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for his work.

===Film===

Carradine&#x27;s first notable film appearance was in director Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; in 1971. That same year, he co-starred with Kirk Douglas and Johnny Cash in &quot;A Gunfight&quot;. His next film, &quot;Emperor of the North Pole&quot; (1973), was re-released with a shorter title &quot;Emperor of the North.&quot; Carradine played a young aspiring hobo. The film was directed by Robert Aldrich and also starred Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine. Carradine then starred in Altman&#x27;s film &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; (1974), then played a principal character, a callow, womanizing folk singer, Tom Frank, in Altman&#x27;s critically acclaimed film &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975; see &quot;Music and songwriting&quot;). He had difficulty shaking the image of Tom Frank following the popularity of the film. He felt the role gave him the reputation of being &quot;a cad.&quot;

In 1977, Aldrich said &quot;I think that Keith Carradine, if he&#x27;s careful—I don&#x27;t think he is careful—and if he&#x27;s prudent about the selection of his parts, can be a great big movie star. I think that whoever&#x27;s advising him is making some terrible selections about material. Because I think the guy is gifted, he&#x27;s talented, he&#x27;s attractive.&quot;

In 1977, Carradine starred opposite Harvey Keitel in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Duellists&quot;. &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; followed in 1978. He has acted in several offbeat films of Altman&#x27;s protege Alan Rudolph, playing a disarmingly candid madman in &quot;Choose Me&quot; (1984), an incompetent petty criminal in &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot; (1985), and an American artist in 1930s Paris in &quot;The Moderns&quot; (1988).
He appeared with brothers David and Robert as the Younger brothers in Walter Hill&#x27;s film &quot;The Long Riders&quot; (1980). Keith played Jim Younger in that film. In 1981, he appeared again under Hill&#x27;s direction in &quot;Southern Comfort.&quot; In 1994, he had a cameo role as Will Rogers in Rudolph&#x27;s film about Dorothy Parker, &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot;. He co-starred with Daryl Hannah as homicidal sociopath John Netherwood in the thriller &quot;The Tie That Binds&quot; (1995). In 2011, he starred in &quot;Cowboys and Aliens&quot;, an American science fiction western film directed by Jon Favreau also starring Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde. Carradine traveled to Tuscany in 2012 to executive produce and star in John Jopson&#x27;s Edgar Allan Poe inspired film &quot;Terroir&quot;. In 2013, he starred in &quot;Ain&#x27;t Them Bodies Saints&quot;, which won the 2013 Sundance Film Festival award for cinematography. In 2016 Keith played Edward Dickinson, father of Emily Dickinson, in &quot;A Quiet Passion&quot;, a biographical film directed and written by Terence Davies about the life of the American poet.

In 2016, Carradine returned to star in his fourth Alan Rudolph film &quot;Ray Meets Helen&quot;, which was the final screen appearance of Sondra Locke.

===Music and songwriting===
His brother, David, said in an interview that Keith could play any instrument he wanted, including bagpipes and the French horn. Like David, Keith integrated his musical talents with his acting performances. In 1975, he performed a song he had written, &quot;I&#x27;m Easy&quot;, in the movie &quot;Nashville&quot;. It was a popular hit, and Carradine won a Golden Globe and an Oscar for Best Original Song for the tune. This led to a brief singing career; he signed a contract with Asylum Records and released two albums – &quot;I&#x27;m Easy&quot; (1976) and &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; (1978). His song &quot;Mr. Blue&quot; was number 44 in the Canadian AC charts in April 1978. In 1984, he appeared in the music video for Madonna&#x27;s single &quot;Material Girl&quot;. In the early 1990s, he played the lead role in the Tony Award–winning musical &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot;.

===Television===
In 1972, Carradine appeared briefly in the first season of the hit television series, &quot;Kung Fu,&quot; which starred his brother, David. Keith played a younger version of David&#x27;s character, Kwai Chang Caine. In 1984, he starred in the TV movie &quot;Scorned and Swindled&quot; alongside Tuesday Weld. In 1987, he starred in the highly rated CBS miniseries &quot;Murder Ordained&quot; with JoBeth Williams and Kathy Bates. Other TV appearances include &quot;My Father My Son&quot; (1988), a television film. In 1983, he appeared as Foxy Funderburke, a murderous pedophile, in the television miniseries &quot;Chiefs&quot;, based on the Stuart Woods novel of the same name. His performance in &quot;Chiefs&quot; earned him a nomination for an Emmy Award in the &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Special&quot; category. Carradine also starred in the ABC sitcom &quot;Complete Savages&quot;, and he played Wild Bill Hickok in the HBO series &quot;Deadwood&quot;.

Carradine hosted the documentary &quot;Wild West Tech&quot; series on the History Channel in the 2003–2004 season, before handing the job over to his brother, David. In the 2005 miniseries &quot;Into the West&quot;, produced by Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks, Carradine played Richard Henry Pratt. During the second and fourth seasons of the Showtime series &quot;Dexter&quot;, he appeared numerous times as FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy. Carradine is credited with guest starring twice on the suspense-drama &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, as the psychopathic serial killer Frank Breitkopf. Other shows he appeared in include &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; (as Penny&#x27;s father Wyatt), &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (&quot;First Flight&quot; episode) and the Starz series &quot;Crash&quot;. Carradine also made a guest appearance on &quot;NCIS&quot; in 2014. Also in 2014, he had a recurring role as Lou Solverson in the FX series &quot;Fargo&quot;, followed by a recurring role as President Conrad Dalton on &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;. He was promoted to series regular starting with the show&#x27;s second season.

In July 2016, Carradine hosted a month-long series of Western films on Turner Classic Movies. He appeared in dozens of wraparounds on the channel, discussing such films as &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, featuring his father, and &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot;, in which he himself appears in a small role.

===Video games===
In 2012, Carradine lent his voice to the video game &quot;&quot;, voicing the primary antagonist Blake Dexter.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Carradine met actress Shelley Plimpton when they starred in the Broadway musical &quot;Hair&quot;. She was married to actor Steve Curry, although they were separated; she and Carradine became romantically involved. After Carradine left the show and was in California, he learned that Shelley was pregnant and had reunited with Curry. He met his daughter, Martha Plimpton, when she was four years old, after Shelley and Steve Curry had divorced. He said of Shelley, &quot;She did a hell of a job raising Martha. I was not there. I was a very young man, absolutely terrified. She just took that in, and then she welcomed me into Martha&#x27;s life when I was ready.&quot;

Carradine married Sandra Will on February 6, 1982. They were separated in 1993, before Will filed for divorce in 1999. The couple had two children: Cade Richmond Carradine (born July 19, 1982) and Sorel Johannah Carradine (born June 18, 1985). In 2006, Will pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury for lying to a grand jury about her involvement in the Anthony Pellicano wire tap scandal. She hired and then became romantically involved with Pellicano after her divorce from Carradine. According to FBI documents, Pellicano tapped Carradine&#x27;s telephone and recorded calls between him and girlfriend Hayley Leslie DuMond at Will&#x27;s request, along with DuMond&#x27;s parents. Carradine filed a civil lawsuit against Will and Pellicano which was settled in 2013 before it went to trial.

On November 18, 2006, Carradine married actress Hayley DuMond, in Turin, Italy. They met in 1997 when they co-starred in the Burt Reynolds film &quot;The Hunter&#x27;s Moon&quot;.

<doc id="884492" wikidata="Q4407194" url="?curid=884492" title="The Longest Most Meaningless Movie in the World">
<text>The Longest Most Meaningless Movie in the World is an underground movie made in the UK that runs to 48 hours long, created as a collaboration by respectively French and British filmmakers Vincent Patouillard as directors and Anthony Scott in production in association with the Swiss Film Centre and the London Film-Makers&#x27; Co-op workshop (both located in London).

No actual footage was shot for the project, which instead consists entirely of outtakes, commercials, strips of undeveloped film, Academy leader, discarded reels recovered from Wardour Street dustbins, and other filmic cast-off material, creating a seemingly endless stream of news-reel and stock footage. Many segments are shown upside down, in reverse, or without sound. Some are shown many times over to wear out the viewer. At one point, a commercial starring Donald Campbell advertising a boys&#x27; adventure magazine is looped forty times, amounting to half an hour&#x27;s worth of video. The film notably features Hermine Demoriane, Roger Dixon, Graham Stevens, Carla Liss and Martine Meringue.

It was originally released in 1968 at the Arts Lab and the Cinémathèque Française, being one of the first films made by London Film-Makers&#x27; Co-op. It was subsequently aired at various locations within the next 2 years. As the title proclaims, it was indeed the longest film ever made at the time of its release (as British artist David Curtis notes, it most likely had the lowest production value to any film as well), but has since been superseded by other films. The current longest film ever made is &quot;Logistics&quot;.

<text>Robert Motherwell (January 24, 1915 – July 16, 1991) was an American abstract expressionist painter, printmaker, and editor of &quot;The Dada Painters and Poets: an Anthology&quot;. He was one of the youngest of the New York School, which also included Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko.

Trained in philosophy, Motherwell then became an artist regarded as among the most articulate spokesmen and the founders of the abstract expressionist painters. He was known for his series of abstract paintings and prints which touched on political, philosophical and literary themes, such as the &quot;Elegies to the Spanish Republic&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Robert Motherwell was born in Aberdeen, Washington on January 24, 1915, the first child of Robert Burns Motherwell II and Margaret Hogan Motherwell. The family later moved to San Francisco, where Motherwell&#x27;s father served as president of Wells Fargo Bank, but returned to Cohasset Beach, Washington, every summer during his youth. Another Aberdeen native with a home at Cohasset Beach was Lance Wood Hart, painter and art teacher, who became Motherwell&#x27;s early mentor. Due to the artist&#x27;s asthmatic condition, Motherwell was reared largely on the Pacific Coast and spent most of his school years in California. There he developed a love for the broad spaces and bright colours that later emerged as essential characteristics of his abstract paintings (ultramarine blue of the sky and yellow ochre of Californian hills). His later concern with themes of mortality can likewise be traced to his frail health as a child.

Between 1932 and 1937, Motherwell briefly studied painting at California School of Fine Arts, San Francisco and received a BA in philosophy from Stanford University. At Stanford, Motherwell was introduced to modernism through his extensive reading of symbolist and other literature, especially Mallarmé, James Joyce, Edgar Allan Poe, and Octavio Paz. This passion stayed with Motherwell for the rest of his life and became a major theme of his later paintings and drawings.

At the age of 20, Motherwell took a grand tour of Europe, accompanied by his father and sister. They began in Paris, then traveled to Amalfi, Italy. The next stops were Switzerland, Germany, The Netherlands and London. The group ended their tour in Motherwell, Scotland.

According to Motherwell, the reason he went to Harvard was that he wanted to be a painter, although his father urged him to pursue a more secure career: &quot;And finally after months of really a cold war he made a very generous agreement with me that if I would get a Ph.D. so that I would be equipped to teach in a college as an economic insurance, he would give me fifty dollars a week for the rest of my life to do whatever I wanted to do on the assumption that with fifty dollars I could not starve but it would be no inducement to last. So with that agreed on Harvard then—it was actually the last year—Harvard still had the best philosophy school in the world. And since I had taken my degree at Stanford in philosophy, and since he didn&#x27;t care what the Ph.D. was in, I went on to Harvard.&quot;

At Harvard, Motherwell studied under Arthur Oncken Lovejoy and David Wite Prall. He spent a year in Paris to research the writings of Eugène Delacroix, where he met American composer Arthur Berger who advised him to continue his education at Columbia University, under Meyer Schapiro. In 1939, Lance Wood Hart, then a professor of drawing and painting at the University of Oregon, invited Motherwell to join him in Eugene, OR to assist in teaching his classes for a full semester.

==The New York School and the Surrealists==

In 1940, Motherwell moved to New York to study at Columbia University, where he was encouraged by Meyer Schapiro to devote himself to painting rather than scholarship. Schapiro introduced the young artist to a group of exiled Parisian Surrealists (Max Ernst, Duchamp, Masson) and arranged for Motherwell to study with Kurt Seligmann. The time that Motherwell spent with the Surrealists proved to be influential to his artistic process. After a 1941 voyage with Roberto Matta to Mexico—on a boat where he met Maria Emilia Ferreira y Moyeros, an actress and his future wife—Motherwell decided to make painting his primary vocation. The sketches Motherwell made in Mexico later evolved into his first important paintings, such as &quot;The Little Spanish Prison&quot; (1941) and &quot;Pancho Villa, Dead and Alive&quot; (1943).

Matta introduced Motherwell to the concept of &quot;automatic&quot; drawing or automatism, which the Surrealists used to tap into their unconscious. The concept had a lasting effect on Motherwell, further augmented by his meeting with the artist Wolfgang Paalen. Motherwell&#x27;s encounter with Paalen prompted him to prolong his stay in Mexico for several months, in order to collaborate with him. Motherwell&#x27;s noted &quot;Mexican Sketchbook&quot; visually reflects the resulting change: while the first drawings are influenced by Matta and Yves Tanguy, later drawings associated with Motherwell&#x27;s time with Paalen show more plane graphic cadences and details distinguished from the earlier period. Paalen also introduced Motherwell to André Breton, via a letter. Motherwell&#x27;s seminal trip to Mexico has been described as a little-known but important factor in the history and aesthetics of abstract expressionism. In 1991, shortly before his death, Motherwell remembered a &quot;conspiracy of silence&quot; regarding Paalen&#x27;s innovative role in the genesis of abstract expressionism.

Upon return from Mexico Motherwell spent time developing his creative principle based on automatism: &quot;What I realized was that Americans potentially could paint like angels but that there was no creative principle around, so that everybody who liked modern art was copying it. Gorky was copying Picasso. Pollock was copying Picasso. De Kooning was copying Picasso. I mean I say this unqualifiedly. I was painting French intimate pictures or whatever. And all we needed was a creative principle, I mean something that would mobilize this capacity to paint in a creative way, and that&#x27;s what Europe had that we hadn&#x27;t had; we had always followed in their wake. And I thought of all the possibilities of free association—because I also had a psychoanalytic background and I understood the implications—might be the best chance to really make something entirely new which everybody agreed was the thing to do.&quot;

Thus, in the early 1940s, Robert Motherwell played a significant role in laying the foundations for the new movement of abstract expressionism (or the New York School): &quot;Matta wanted to start a revolution, a movement, within Surrealism. He asked me to find some other American artists that would help start a new movement. It was then that Baziotes and I went to see Pollock and de Kooning and Hofmann and Kamrowski and Busa and several other people. And if we could come with something. Peggy Guggenheim who liked us said that she would put on a show of this new business. And so I went around explaining the theory of automatism to everybody because the only way that you could have a movement was that it had some common principle. It sort of all began that way.&quot;

In 1942 Motherwell began to exhibit his work in New York and in 1944 he had his first one-man show at Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s &quot;Art of This Century&quot; gallery; that same year the MoMA was the first museum to purchase one of his works. From the mid-1940s, Motherwell became the leading spokesman for avant-garde art in America. His circle came to include William Baziotes, David Hare, Barnett Newman, and Mark Rothko, with whom he eventually started the Subjects of the Artist School (1948–1949). In 1949 Motherwell divorced Maria and in 1950 he married Betty Little, with whom he had two daughters.

Motherwell was a member of the editorial board of the Surrealist magazine &quot;VVV&quot; and a contributor to Wolfgang Paalen&#x27;s journal &quot;DYN&quot;, which was edited from 1942 to 1944 in six issues. He also edited Paalen&#x27;s collected essays &quot;Form and Sense&quot; in 1945 as the first issue of &quot;Problems of Contemporary Art&quot;.

In 1948 Motherwell executed the image which would prove to be the germ of the &quot;Elegies to the Spanish Republic&quot;, one of his best known series of works. During 1947–48, Motherwell collaborated with the art critic Harold Rosenberg and others to produce &quot;Possibilities&quot;, an art review. During the latter year Motherwell created an image incorporating Rosenberg&#x27;s poem &quot;The Bird for Every Bird&quot;, meant for inclusion in the review&#x27;s second issue. The top half was a handwritten, stylized rendering of the poem&#x27;s final three lines, and the bottom half was a visual element consisting of roughly rendered black ovoid and rectangular forms against a white background. The stark image was meant to &quot;illustrate&quot; the violent imagery of the poem in an abstract, non-literal way; Motherwell therefore preferred the term &quot;illumination&quot;. The second issue of &quot;Possibilities&quot; did not materialize, and Motherwell placed the image in storage. He rediscovered it roughly one year later and decided to rework its basic elements. This led to the &quot;Elegies to the Spanish Republic&quot; which Motherwell continued to produce for the rest of his life; several years later Motherwell retroactively titled the original image &quot;Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 1&quot;, recognizing it as the series&#x27; starting point. A representative example is &quot;Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 110&quot; (1971) which employs the same visual motif of rough ovoid and rectangular forms. The series&#x27; abstract imagery has been interpreted as representing violence in Hispanic culture, not necessarily related to the Spanish Civil War of its title. For example, Motherwell himself and others have compared the images to the display of a dead bull&#x27;s genitalia in the Spanish bullfighting ring.

In 1948, Motherwell, William Baziotes, Barnett Newman, David Hare, and Mark Rothko founded the Subjects of the Artist School at 35 East 8th Street. Well attended lectures were open to the public with speakers such as Jean Arp, John Cage and Ad Reinhardt. The school failed financially and closed in the spring of 1949. Throughout the 1950s Motherwell taught painting at Hunter College in New York and at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. Cy Twombly, Robert Rauschenberg and Kenneth Noland studied under and were influenced by Motherwell. At this time, he was a prolific writer and lecturer, and in addition to directing the influential Documents of Modern Art Series, he edited &quot;The Dada Painters and Poets: An Anthology&quot;, which was published in 1951.

From 1954 to 1958, during the break-up of his second marriage, he worked on a small series of paintings which incorporated the words Je t&#x27;aime, expressing his most intimate and private feelings. His collages began to incorporate material from his studio such as cigarette packets and labels, becoming records of his daily life. He was married for the third time, from 1958 to 1971, to fellow abstract painter Helen Frankenthaler. Because Frankenthaler and Motherwell were both born into wealth and known to host lavish parties, the pair were known as &quot;the golden couple&quot;.

==Mature years==
In 1958–59, Motherwell was included in &quot;The New American Painting&quot; exhibition, initiated by the Museum of Modern Art, which traveled across Europe. In 1958 he and Frankenthaler spent a three-month honeymoon in Spain and France, during which he began painting with a new energy that he attributed to her influence. The &quot;Two Figures&quot; series he made that year shows &quot;the brightening power of Helen&#x27;s colors&quot; on his work.

During the 1960s, Motherwell exhibited widely in both America and Europe and in 1965 he was given a major retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art; this show subsequently traveled to Amsterdam, London, Brussels, Essen, and Turin. In 1962, Motherwell and Frankenthaler spent the summer at the artists&#x27; colony at Provincetown, Massachusetts, where the coastline inspired the &quot;Beside the Sea&quot; series of 64 paintings, the oil paint splashed with full force imitating the sea crashing on the shore in front of his studio. The 1963 untitled oil on canvas painting in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art exemplifies this stage in the artist&#x27;s career.

In 1964, Motherwell created a mural-sized painting entitled &quot;Dublin 1916, with Black and Tan&quot;, which is in the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY. The size and content suggest that Motherwell intended to create a monument to heroism in the tradition of Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;.

In 1965 Motherwell worked on another prominent series called the &quot;Lyric Suite&quot;, named after Alban Berg&#x27;s string quartet. Motherwell recalled, &quot;I went to a Japanese store to buy a toy for a friend&#x27;s kid, and I saw this beautiful Japanese paper and I bought a thousand sheets. And I made up my mind, this was in the beginning of April 1965, that I would do the thousand sheets without correction. I&#x27;d make an absolute rule for myself. And I got to 600 in April and May, when one night my wife and I were having dinner and the telephone rang. And it was Kenneth Noland in Vermont saying that I should come immediately. And I said, &#x27;what&#x27;s happened?&#x27; And he said, &#x27;David Smith&#x27;s been in an accident&#x27;.&quot; Smith, the sculptor, was Motherwell and Frankenthaler&#x27;s friend. The couple drove hastily to Vermont, arriving 15 minutes after Smith had died. Motherwell stopped work on the series. He said of them: &quot;And then one year I had them all framed, and I like them very much now. I should also say that I half painted them and they half painted themselves. I&#x27;d never used rice paper before except occasionally as an element in a collage. And most of these were made with very small, I mean very thin lines. And then I would look at amazement on the floor after I&#x27;d finished. It would spread like spots of oil and fill all kinds of strange dimensions.&quot;

In 1967 Motherwell began to work on his &quot;Open&quot; series. Inspired by a chance juxtaposition of a large and small canvas, the Open paintings occupied Motherwell for nearly two decades. The Opens consist of limited planes of colour, broken up by minimally rendered lines in loosely rectangular configurations. As the series progressed, the works became more complex and more painterly, as Motherwell worked through the possible permutations of such reduced means.

The late 1960s saw Motherwell using Gauloises packets and cartons in many collages, including an extensive series with the packets surrounded by bright red acrylic paint, often with incised lines in the painted areas.

In 1972 Motherwell married the artist-photographer Renate Ponsold and moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, where they lived in a carriage house with a hayloft aerie, a barn and a guest cottage adjoining a large studio. He had begun living there full-time beginning in the fall of 1971 after his divorce with Helen Frankenthaler was finalized. Motherwell set up different studios for different modes of production (painting, collage, printmaking) throughout the property. During the 1970s, he had retrospective exhibitions in several European cities, including Düsseldorf, Stockholm, Vienna, Paris, Edinburgh, and London. In 1977, Motherwell was given a major mural commission for the new wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

In 1983, a major retrospective exhibition of Motherwell&#x27;s work, organized by Douglas G. Schultz, was held at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York.

From 1983 to 1985, this exhibition was subsequently shown at major museums, Los Angeles County Museum of Art San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Seattle Art Museum, Corcoran Gallery of Art, and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Another retrospective was shown in Mexico City, Monterey, and Fort Worth, Texas, in 1991.

In 1985, Motherwell was awarded the Edward Macdowell Medal.

In 1988, Motherwell worked with the publisher Andrew Hoyem of Arion Press on a limited edition of the modernist novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, by James Joyce. Motherwell produced 40 lithographs for the project.

==Death and legacy==
Motherwell died in Provincetown, Massachusetts on July 16, 1991. On his death, Clement Greenberg, champion of the New York School, left in little doubt his esteem for the artist, commenting that &quot;although he is underrated today, in my opinion he was one of the very best of the abstract expressionist painters&quot;.

The Dedalus Foundation was set up by Robert Motherwell in 1981 to foster public understanding of modern art and modernism through its support of research, education, publications, and exhibitions. When Motherwell died, he left an estate then estimated at more than $25 million and more than 1,000 works of art, not including prints. His will was filed for probate in Greenwich and named as executors his widow, Renate Ponsold Motherwell, and longtime friend Richard Rubin, a professor of political science at Swarthmore College.

On July 20, 1991, several hundred people attended a memorial service for Motherwell on the beach outside his Provincetown home. Among them were the writer Norman Mailer and the photographer Joel Meyerowitz, both Provincetown summer residents. Speakers included the poet Stanley Kunitz, who read a poem that was a favorite of Motherwell&#x27;s, William Butler Yeats&#x27;s &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot;. Others in attendance included family members, friends, other artists, and Senator Howard Metzenbaum, an acquaintance of Motherwell&#x27;s.

<text>Independent radio indicates a radio station that is run in a manner different from usual for the country it broadcasts in.

Conversely, in places such as the United States, where commercial broadcasters are the norm, independent radio is sometimes used to refer to non-commercial educational radio stations that are primarily supported by listener contributions and are thus &quot;independent&quot; of commercial advertising concerns. With the advent of large commercial broadcast radio network companies, and the general adoption of the term &quot;public radio&quot; in the United States to refer to non-religious radio-oriented listener-supported stations, the term has also been used to refer to commercial radio stations that are run &quot;independently&quot; of the large radio conglomerates.

<text>Prehistoric warfare refers to war that occurred between societies without recorded history.

The existence—and the definition—of war in humanity&#x27;s hypothetical state of nature has been a controversial topic in the history of ideas at least since Thomas Hobbes in &quot;Leviathan&quot; (1651) argued a &quot;war of all against all&quot;, a view directly challenged by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in a &quot;Discourse on Inequality&quot; (1755) and &quot;The Social Contract&quot; (1762). The debate over human nature continues, spanning contemporary anthropology, archaeology, ethnography, history, political science, psychology, primatology, and philosophy in such divergent books as Azar Gat&#x27;s &quot;War in Human Civilization&quot; and Raymond C. Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Warless Societies and the Origin of War&quot;. For the purposes of this article, &quot;prehistoric war&quot; will be broadly defined as a state of organized lethal aggression between autonomous communities.

==Paleolithic==
Some scientists argue that humans have a predisposition for violence. Chimpanzees, the great apes genetically closest to humans, are known to wage wars over territories and resources.

According to cultural anthropologist and ethnographer Raymond C. Kelly, population density among the earliest hunter-gatherer societies of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; was probably low enough to avoid armed conflict. The development of the throwing-spear and ambush hunting techniques required cooperation, which made potential violence between hunting parties very costly. The need to prevent competition for resources by maintenance of low population densities may have accelerated the migration out of Africa of &quot;H. erectus&quot; some 1.8 million years ago as a natural consequence of conflict avoidance.

Hypotheses which suggest that genocidal violence may have caused the extinction of the Neanderthals have been offered by several authors, including Jared Diamond and Ronald Wright. The hypothesis that early humans violently replaced Neanderthals was first proposed by French paleontologist Marcellin Boule (the first person to publish an analysis of a Neanderthal) in 1912. However, several scholars have formed alternative theories as to why the Neanderthals died out, and there is no clear consensus as to what caused their extinction within the current scientific community.

Kelly believes that this period of &quot;Paleolithic warlessness&quot; persisted until well after the appearance of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; some 315,000 years ago, ending only at the occurrence of economic and social shifts associated with sedentism, when new conditions incentivized organized raiding of settlements.

None of the many cave paintings of the Upper Paleolithic depicts people attacking other people explicitly, 
but there are depictions of human beings pierced with arrows
both of the Aurignacian-Périgordian (roughly 30,000 years old) and the early Magdalenian (c. 17,000 years old), possibly representing &quot;spontaneous confrontations over game resources&quot; in which hostile trespassers were killed; however, other interpretations, including capital punishment, human sacrifice, assassination or systemic warfare cannot be ruled out.

It has also been suggested that lack of evidence of Paleolithic warfare is due to differences in archaeology resulting in less evidence being likely to survive to be analysed compared to other eras. Since Paleolithic humans lived in small, mobile bands, with low population densities and less durable structures, while also existing further back in history, this results in a lower probability of finding clear evidence as well as that evidence not decaying by the modern day. Furthermore, humans only began to bury their dead 150,000 years ago and not all cultures did so (some preferring to remove them by cremation or exposure), limiting remains that can be found. The absence of fortifications could also be due to the fact that fortifications would be inefficient to construct for a society that is primarily nomadic and that only spends a short period of time in one place. Kissel et al. argue that while the general scarcity of evidence from the period suggests warfare may not have been common, it does not support the hypothesis that war was absent.

==Epipaleolithic==
The most ancient archaeological record of what could have been a prehistoric massacre is at the site of Jebel Sahaba, committed against a population associated with the Qadan culture of far northern Sudan. 
The cemetery contains a large number of skeletons that are approximately 13,000 to 14,000 years old, with 24 out of 59 skeletons presenting arrowheads embedded in their skeletons, which indicates that they might have been the casualties of warfare. It has been noted that the violence, if dated correctly, likely occurred in the wake of a local ecological crisis. Initially, Jebel Seheba was believed to be the site of a singular battle. However re-examination of the remains has superseded this thesis. The co-occurrence of healed and unhealed lesions among 41 individuals was found to strongly support sporadic and recurrent violence between the social groups of the Nile valley.

At the site of Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, numerous 10,000-year-old human remains were found with possible evidence of major traumatic injuries, including obsidian bladelets embedded in the skeletons, that should have been lethal. According to the original study, published in January 2016, the region was a &quot;fertile lakeshore landscape sustaining a substantial population of hunter-gatherers&quot; where pottery had been found, suggesting storage of food and sedentism. The initial report concluded that the bodies at Nataruk were not interred, but were preserved in the positions the individuals had died at the edge of a lagoon. However, evidence of blunt-force cranial trauma and lack of interment have been called into question, casting doubt upon the assertion that the site represents early intragroup violence.

The oldest rock art depicting acts of violence between hunter-gatherers in Northern Australia has been tentatively dated to 10,000 years ago.
The earliest, limited evidence for war in Mesolithic Europe likewise dates to c. 10,000 years ago, and episodes of warfare appear to remain &quot;localized and temporarily restricted&quot; during the Late Mesolithic to Early Neolithic period in Europe. Iberian cave art of the Mesolithic shows explicit scenes of battle between groups of archers. A group of three archers encircled by a group of four is found in Cova del Roure, Morella la Vella, Castellón, Valencia. A depiction of a larger battle (which may, however, date to the early Neolithic), in which eleven archers are attacked by seventeen running archers, is found in Les Dogue, Ares del Maestrat, Castellón, Valencia. At Val del Charco del Agua Amarga, Alcañiz, Aragon, seven archers with plumes on their heads are fleeing a group of eight archers running in pursuit.

Early war was influenced by the development of bows, maces, and slings. The bow seems to have been the most important weapon in early warfare, in that it enabled attacks to be launched with far less risk to the attacker when compared to the risk involved in melee combat. While there are no cave paintings of battles between men armed with clubs, the development of the bow is concurrent with the first known depictions of organized warfare consisting of clear illustrations of two or more groups of men attacking each other. These figures are arrayed in lines and columns with a distinctly garbed leader at the front. Some paintings even portray still-recognizable tactics like flankings and envelopments. However, it has also been argued that these paintings should be interpreted with caution due to the fact that it is not self-evident that the cultures that made them intended to depict actual events or if they were intended to be symbolic or otherwise possess a different meaning.

==Neolithic ==
Systemic warfare appears to have been a direct consequence of the sedentism as it developed in the wake of the Neolithic Revolution.
An important example is the massacre of Talheim Death Pit (near Heilbronn, Germany), dated right on the cusp of the beginning European Neolithic, at 5500 BC. Investigation of the Neolithic skeletons found in the Talheim Death pit in Germany suggests that prehistoric men from neighboring tribes were prepared to brutally fight and kill each other in order to capture and secure women. Researchers discovered that there were women among the immigrant skeletons, but within the local group of skeletons there were only men and children. They concluded that the absence of women among the local skeletons meant that they were regarded as somehow special, thus they were spared execution and captured instead. The capture of women may have indeed been the primary motive for the fierce conflict between the men.

Other speculations about the reasons for violence among Linear Pottery Culture settlements in Neolithic Europe include vengeance, conflicts over land and resources, and kidnapping of slaves. Some of these theories related to the lack of resources are supported by the discovery that various fortifications bordering indigenously inhabited areas appear to have not been in use for very long. A mass burial site at Schletz was also fortified, which serves as evidence of violent conflict among tribes and means that these fortifications were built as a form of defense against aggressors. The massacre of Schletz occurred at the same time as the massacre at Talheim and several other massacres. More than 200 Neolithic people were killed during the massacre in the Linear Pottery settlement area of Schletz 7000 years ago. 

More recently, a similar site was discovered at Schöneck-Kilianstädten, with the remains of the victims showing &quot;a pattern of intentional mutilation&quot;.
While the presence of such massacre sites in the context of Early Neolithic Europe is undisputed, diverging definitions of &quot;warfare proper&quot; (i.e. planned campaigns sanctioned by society as opposed to spontaneous massacres) has led to scholarly debate on the existence of warfare in the narrow sense prior to the development of city states in 20th-century archaeology. In the summary of Heath (2017), accumulating archaeology has made it &quot;increasingly harder&quot; to argue for the absence of organised warfare in Neolithic Europe.

Bioarchaeologists have found from the skeletal remains of more than 2,300 early farmers from 180 sites in northwestern Europe between 8,000 and 4,000 years ago that more than one in ten suffered weapon injuries.

During the period of expansion of hunter-gatherer groups associated with the Pitted Ware culture in southern Scandinavia, the Funnelbeaker farmers constructed a number of defensive palisades, which may mean that the two peoples were in conflict with each other. There is archaeological evidence of high levels of violence among the people of the Pitted Ware culture. 

The 8500-year-old Kennewick Man, a prehistoric Paleoamerican man, and Ötzi, who lived and died in the European Alps some 5,200 years ago, were probably killed in warfare.

Warfare in pre-Columbian North America has served as an important comparandum in the archaeological study of the indirect evidence for warfare in the Neolithic. A notable example is the massacre at the Crow Creek Site in South Dakota (14th century).

==Chalcolithic to Bronze Age==

The onset of the Chalcolithic (Copper Age) saw the introduction of copper weapons. Organised warfare between early city states was in existence by the mid-5th millennium BC. Excavations at Mersin, Anatolia show the presence of fortifications and soldiers&#x27; quarters by 4300 BC.

Excavation work undertaken in 2005 and 2006 has shown that Hamoukar was destroyed by warfare by around 3500 BC-—probably the earliest urban warfare attested so far in the archaeological record of the Near East. Continued excavations in 2008 and 2010 expand on that.

Archaeological evidence suggests that Proto-Indo-Iranian-speaking Abashevo society was intensely warlike. Mass graves reveal that inter-tribal battles involved hundreds of warriors of both sides. Warfare appears to have been more frequent in the late Abashevo period, and it was in this turbulent environment in which the Sintashta culture emerged. The spread of spoke-wheeled chariots has been closely associated with early Indo-Iranian migrations. The earliest known chariots have been found in Sintashta culture burial sites, and the culture is considered a strong candidate for the origin of the technology, which spread throughout the Old World and played an important role in ancient warfare. 

Military conquests expanded city states under Egyptian control. Babylonia and later Assyria built empires in Mesopotamia while the Hittite Empire ruled much of Anatolia. Chariots appear in the 20th century BC, and become central to warfare in the Ancient Near East from the 17th century BC. The Hyksos and Kassite invasions mark the transition to the Late Bronze Age. Ahmose I defeated the Hyksos and re-established Egyptian control of Nubia and Canaan, territories again defended by Ramesses II at the Battle of Kadesh, the greatest chariot battle in history. The raids of the Sea Peoples and the renewed disintegration of Egypt in the Third Intermediate Period marks the end of the Bronze Age.

The Tollense valley battlefield is the oldest evidence of a large scale battle in Europe. More than 4,000 warriors from Central Europe fought in a battle on the site in the 13th century BC.

Mycenaean Greeks () invested in the development of military infrastructure, while military production and logistics were supervised directly from the palatial centers. The most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor was the boar&#x27;s tusk helmet. In general, most features of the later hoplite panoply of classical Greek antiquity, were already known to Mycenaean Greece.
The Late Bronze Age collapse was a time of widespread societal collapse during the 12th century BC, between and 1150. It was sudden, violent, and culturally disruptive for many Bronze Age civilizations, and it brought a sharp economic decline to regional powers, notably ushering in the Greek Dark Ages. Historian Robert Drews argues for the appearance of massed infantry, using newly developed weapons and armour, such as cast rather than forged spearheads and long swords, a revolutionizing cut-and-thrust weapon, and javelins. Such new weaponry, in the hands of large numbers of &quot;running skirmishers&quot;, who could swarm and cut down a chariot army, would destabilize states that were based upon the use of chariots by the ruling class. That would precipitate an abrupt social collapse as raiders began to conquer, loot and burn cities.

The Bronze Age in China traverses the protohistoric and historic periods. Battles utilizing foot and chariot infantry took place regularly between powers in the North China Plain.

==Iron Age==

Early Iron Age events like the Dorian invasion, Greek colonialism and their interaction with Phoenician and Etruscan forces lie within the prehistoric period. Germanic warrior societies of the Migration period engaged in endemic warfare (see also Thorsberg moor and Illerup Ådal). Anglo-Saxon warfare lies on the edge of historicity, its study relying primarily on archaeology with the help of only fragmentary written accounts.

There are around 3,300 structures that can be classed as hillforts or similar &quot;defended enclosures&quot; within Britain. Hillforts in Britain are known from the Bronze Age, but the great period of hillfort construction was during the British Iron Age, between 700 BC and the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD. The reason for the emergence of hillforts in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture.

==Endemic warfare==

In warlike cultures, war is often ritualized with a number of taboos and practices that limit the number of casualties and the duration of the conflict. This type of situation is known as endemic warfare. Among tribal societies engaging in endemic warfare, conflict may escalate to actual warfare occasionally for reasons such as conflict over resources or for no readily understandable reason.

Warfare is known to every tribal society, but some societies developed a particular emphasis on the formation of a warrior culture (such as the Nuer of South Sudan, the Māori of New Zealand, the Dugum Dani of Papua, the Yanomami (dubbed &quot;the Fierce People&quot;) of the Amazon. The culture of inter-tribal warfare has long been present in New Guinea.

<text>The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple () is a lost Chinese silent film serial directed by Zhang Shichuan, widely considered to be the founding father of Chinese cinema. The film is adapted from the novel &quot;The Tale of the Extraordinary Swordsman&quot;.

&quot;The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple&quot;, in 16 parts, is among the longest films ever produced and the longest major release, running 27 hours in total. The Mingxing Film Company production was released in 19 feature-length parts between 1928 and 1931. No copies have survived. The craze of the film series eventually led the Kuomintang to ban all wuxia films by the early 1930s because wuxia was thought to be inciting anarchy and rebellion.

<doc id="884510" wikidata="Q6414382" url="?curid=884510" title="Kintigh Generating Station">
<text>The Kintigh Generating Station, also known as Somerset Operating Co. LLC of the Upstate New York Power Producers was a 675-megawatt coal-fired power plant located in Somerset, New York, United States. The plant was owned by AES Corporation until bankruptcy. Its unit was launched into service in 1984. Coal is provided to the plant via the Somerset Railroad. The waste heat is dumped into Lake Ontario, resulting in a warm-water plume visible on satellite images. The plant&#x27;s 625-foot smoke stack can be seen across Lake Ontario from the shores of Toronto, Pickering, Oshawa, and Ajax, Ontario. It can also be seen from points along the Niagara Escarpment, including Lockport, NY, approximately 20 miles south. Power from the plant is transferred by dual 345kV power lines on wood pylons, which run south from the plant through rural agricultural land. In Royalton, NY they split at their physical junction with the dual circuit 345-kV Niagara-to-Edic transmission line, owned by the New York Power Authority, one circuit heads west to a substation at Niagara Falls, the other heads east to Station 80 south of Rochester. This bulk electric transmission constraint, created by the Somerset plant tie-in and forcing wheeling through 230kV and 345kV transmission lines to the Homer City Coal Plant east of Pittsburgh, PA, and returning to NY at the Watercurry substation outside Elmira, will be resolved through the Empire State Line proposal approved by NY Independent System Operator (NYISO).

The plant&#x27;s electric power was sold in the NYISO wholesale electric markets. The plant was the last coal-fired plant remaining in operation in New York and officially shut down on March 31, 2020. This in effect fulfilled Governor Cuomo&#x27;s pledge to phase out coal by 2020, enforced by current regulation requirements which will be in effect on December 31, 2020.

==History==
The Somerset Nuclear Power Plant was proposed by New York State Electric &amp; Gas in 1974 as two General Electric 1,200 MW units, but the project was canceled in 1975.

In 1975, NYSEG announced it was changing its construction plans because a geologic fault had been found 40 miles away in Attica. Extra retrofitting costs would have made a nuclear plant infeasible versus a reinforced coal . A 650 MW coal plant was built at the site and went into service in 1984 ahead of schedule and under budget.

In 2012, the plant was sold to Upstate New York Power Producers along with the Cayuga plant that AES also owned. The transfer occurred as the result of a bankruptcy settlement with AES&#x27;s creditors. It was noted in the approving public service commission order that the 5 creditors that own the new organization provided AES $550 million in financing to acquire the facility in 1999. One of the five creditors included the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.

===Kintigh Electric Energy Production (2006-2012)===
In 2016, Upstate New York Power Producers sold the Kintigh facility and the Cayuga facility to Riesling Power, LLC.

In March 2020, the Kintigh facility was retired.

==Environmental impacts==

In 2010, the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit research and advocacy association, published a report evaluating the environmental and health effects attributable to fine particle pollution from coal-fired U.S. power plants, specifically mentioning the Kintigh Generating Station. The report focused on air pollution from soot, heavy metals, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Alleging that fine particle pollution from coal power plants is responsible for 13,000 deaths annually in the United States, it posited that the Kintigh Generating Station&#x27;s fine particle pollution caused 11 preventable deaths a year, 19 heart attacks and 170 asthma attacks. The Research and Policy Center of Environment New York has also been critical of the Kintigh Generating Station, claiming in 2011 that the plant emits almost 3.8 million mass tons of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide each year.

<text>Jón Sigurðsson (17 June 1811 – 7 December 1879) was the leader of the 19th century Icelandic independence movement.

==Biography==
Born at Hrafnseyri, in Arnarfjörður in the Westfjords area of Iceland, he was the son of Þórdís Jónsdóttir and pastor Sigurður Jónsson. In 1833, he moved to Denmark to study grammar and history at the University of Copenhagen. While in Denmark, Jón developed syphilis and was bedridden for an extended period. According to historian , Jón showed little interest in politics prior to his bout with syphilis.

After completing his education, Jón began to work at the Arnamagnæan Institute, which was then the home of the manuscripts of the Icelandic sagas. He became an expert on the sagas and on Icelandic history. He never graduated from university, as Icelandic politics grew to consume all his time.

Before Jón moved to Denmark he proposed to his cousin, , and she and her father, Jón&#x27;s uncle, accepted the proposal. However Jón and Ingibjörg did not marry until 1845, when Jón came to Iceland for the first time since 1833 to sit at the restored Alþing. Jón had been elected to the Althing in 1844 as an MP for Ísafjörður county. He managed to hold on to this seat throughout his life although he did not attend all sessions of the Althing. In all, he came to 13 of the 17 sessions that were held in his lifetime. He also attended the National Assembly of 1851. There he led the Icelanders in their resistance to the adoption of Denmark&#x27;s 1849 constitutional reform. The constitution was never formally adopted in Iceland, and after years of struggle the Danish Government granted Iceland a limited constitution in 1874 giving autonomy in internal affairs. Until then the Althing had only been an advisory body to the Danish government and king. He served as speaker of the Althing from 1875 to 1877.

Jón&#x27;s way of communicating with the Icelandic nation from Denmark where he lived and worked was to publish an annual magazine called Ný félagsrit (New Association Writings). It was published almost every year from 1841 to 1873 with Jón always being the main contributor and financial backer.

The home of Jón and Ingibjörg in Copenhagen became a centre for all Icelanders in the city. They had no children except for one foster-son who was Jón&#x27;s nephew. However, a contemporary remarked that &quot;all Icelanders are their children&quot;.

Jón was a classical liberal, unlike most of his contemporary and subsequent nationalists. Historian Gunnar Karlsson describes him in the following fashion, Jon Sigurdsson was by no means a typical 19th-century national hero. He was not an extreme nationalist and for his time, was rather devoid of romanticism. Above all, he was a protagonist of modernization, democracy, human rights and economic progress... Jon&#x27;s career was not typical for a leader of a liberation movement either. He was never arrested for his political activity or spent a single night in prison. On the contrary, for most of his life he was sustained by rather generous research grants from various scholarly institutions, more or less funded by the Danish treasury.Jón never requested full autonomy for Iceland during his lifetime. Jón called for greater self-rule, arguing that &quot;the country should be allowed to govern itself as much as possible, in order for the great energy, which is inherent in the country but lies dormant, to be revived and to mature.&quot;

He died in Copenhagen in 1879.

==Legacy==

His birthday, 17 June, was chosen as Iceland&#x27;s National Holiday to recognize his efforts toward Icelandic independence.

He is often referred to as President (&quot;Jón forseti&quot;) by Icelanders. The main reason for this is that he served as the president of Althing several times, for the first time in 1849. He also served as the President of the Copenhagen Department of Hið íslenska bókmenntafélag (the Icelandic Literature Society). He is currently pictured on Iceland&#x27;s 500 krónur bill, and 

The apartment which Jón and Ingibjörg rented at Øster Voldgade 12 in Copenhagen from 1852 is called &quot;Jónshús&quot; and has been the property of the Icelandic government since 1967. It serves as a cultural center for Icelanders in Denmark, and as housing for academics on sabbatical. A plaque on the corner with Stokhusgade commemorates that he used to live in the building.

<text>Charles (; 6 March 18236 October 1891) was King of Württemberg from 25 June 1864 until his death in 1891. Charles I married Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia in 1846 and ascended to the throne in 1864. Despite their marriage, the couple had no children, likely due to Charles&#x27; homosexuality. Charles was involved in several scandals, including a close relationship with American Charles Woodcock. In 1870, the couple adopted Olga&#x27;s niece, Vera Konstantinovna. Charles I aligned with Austria during the Austro-Prussian War but later sided with Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War, joining the new German Empire in 1870. He died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, William II.

==Early life==

Charles was born on 6 March 1823 in Stuttgart as the only son of King William I and his third wife Pauline Therese (1800–1873). As the king&#x27;s eldest son he became Crown Prince of Württemberg. His father&#x27;s first wife was Princess Caroline Augusta, daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt. After their 1814 divorce, without issue, he married his first cousin, Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia, daughter of Emperor Paul I of Russia and Princess Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg. Catherine died in 1819 after having two daughters, Princess Marie Friederike Charlotte of Württemberg (wife of Alfred, Count von Neipperg) and Princess Sophie of Württemberg (wife of King William III of the Netherlands). From his parents marriage, he had two sisters, Princess Catherine (who married Prince Frederick of Württemberg) and Princess Augusta (wife of Prince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach).

His paternal grandparents were King Frederick I of Württemberg and Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (a daughter of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick
and Princess Augusta of Great Britain, elder sister to King George III). His grandmother&#x27;s younger sister, Princess Caroline married King George IV. His maternal grandparents were Duke Louis of Württemberg and Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg.

Charles studied in Berlin and Tübingen.

==Reign==

Charles acceded to the throne of Württemberg upon his father&#x27;s death on 25 June 1864 and was crowned on 12 July 1864. More liberal-leaning than his father, he replaced Chief Minister Joseph von Linden with Karl von Varnbüler, and restored freedom of the press and association on 24 December 1864 followed by universal suffrage introduced for the People&#x27;s Deputies of the Second Chamber on 26 March 1868.

In relation to foreign policy, after siding with Austria in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, he moved closer to the Kingdom of Prussia. Following the Battle of Sadowa, he enacted a secret military treaty with Prussia (which became public in 1867) and recognized the dissolution of the German Confederation in 1866. Nevertheless, an anti-Prussian attitude was officially represented by the Court, the government and the people.

Because of the alliance, Württemberg took Prussia&#x27;s side in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 to 1871. At the end of October 1870 the king withdrew to Friedrichshafen and in October 1870, signed one of the November treaties, joining the North German Confederation which began on 1 January 1871 and renamed itself the German Empire. He was represented at the Palace of Versailles at the Proclamation of the German Empire by his cousin, Prince August of Württemberg.

The King showed a tendency to withdraw into private life in other ways, going around the country and, later, spending time in Nice. In doing so, he was accused of having neglected the obligations incumbent on him as a constitutional body, including by having up to 800 unsigned documents accumulate in one case. On the one hand, it was a nuisance for the administration, but on the other hand it was also convenient for the government who was largely able to rule without interference from the King.

As a result of Württemberg being a Federal State of the German Empire since 1871, there were considerable restrictions on its sovereignty. Württemberg lost its previous international position, but gained greater security both internally and externally. Postal and telegraph services, financial sovereignty, cultural maintenance and railway administration remained in Württemberg hands, and the Kingdom of Württemberg also had its own military administration.

==Personal life==
On 18 January 1846, he became engaged in Palermo to the 23-year-old Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, the daughter of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia and Charlotte of Prussia (a daughter of King Frederick William III of Prussia and sister to William I, German Emperor). Olga&#x27;s grandmother, Empress Maria Feodorovna, was the younger sister of Charles&#x27; grandfather, King Frederick. They married on 13 July 1846 at Peterhof Palace in Petergof, Saint Petersburg. The young couple moved to Stuttgart, and from 1854 until Charles&#x27; accession in 1864, lived at the Crown Prince Palace () built between 1846 and 1850 at state expense on Königstraße, corner of Schloßplatz (which was demolished in ). For their summer residence, the crown prince couple stayed at Villa Berg, which had been designed by Christian Friedrich von Leins according to their own ideas and is considered one of the first Renaissance Revival style buildings in Germany.

The couple had no children, perhaps because of Charles&#x27; homosexuality, and, in 1870, Olga and Charles I adopted Olga&#x27;s niece Vera Konstantinovna, the daughter of her brother Grand Duke Konstantin.

After a stay at Bebenhausen Palace where he spent his autumns at Bebenhausen (and had tasked architect with renovating the palace&#x27;s rooms), he returned to Stuttgart on 3 October 1891, three days before his death on 6 October 1891. He was succeeded as King of Württemberg by his nephew, William II. His wife died a year later, on 30 October 1892, and was buried together with him in the Old Castle in Stuttgart.

===Homosexuality===

Charles I became the object of scandal several times for his closeness with various men. A first &quot;intimate&quot; long-standing &quot;heart friendship&quot; was with his adjutant general, Baron Wilhelm von Spitzemberg. Another friend was Richard Jackson of Cincinnati, the secretary of the U.S. Consulate. Charles&#x27; most notorious relationship was with the American Charles Woodcock, a 30-year-old he met in 1883. The King made Woodcock his chamberlain and even elevated him as to Freiherr Woodcock-Savage in 1888. Charles I and Charles Woodcock became inseparable, going so far as to appear together in public dressed identically. It was less the king&#x27;s homosexuality than the fact that Woodcock used his position to exercise significant influence over the king&#x27;s personnel decisions that became a scandal. This did not go unnoticed by the press, and together with the political establishment, headed by Prime Minister Hermann von Mittnacht, the King was put under intense pressure to give up Woodcock. In 1889, however, Charles found a new friend in Wilhelm Georges, the technical director of the royal theater. The relationship with Georges lasted until the King&#x27;s death two years later.

<text>The Trossachs (; ) generally refers to an area of wooded glens, braes, and lochs lying to the east of Ben Lomond in the Stirling council area of Scotland. The name is taken from that of a small woodland glen that lies at the centre of the area, but is now generally applied to the wider region.

The wooded hills and lochs of the area may be considered to represent a microcosm of a typical highland landscape, and the woodlands are an important habitat for many species. Much of the Trossachs area is protected by various different conservation designations, including the Great Trossachs Forest [[National nature reserve (Scotland)|National Nature Reserve]].

The Trossachs form part of the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, which was established in 2002. The area has long been visited by tourists due to the relative proximity of major population centres such as Glasgow and Stirling, and remains popular with walkers, cyclists and tourists. Scenic boat rides on Loch Katrine are popular with visitors: the steamer SS Sir Walter Scott, launched in 1899, remains in operation. The Great Trossachs Path, one of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails, is a 48 km route suitable for walkers, cyclists and horse riders. It runs between Callander in the east and Inversnaid on the banks of Loch Lomond in the west, passing along the northern shores of Loch Katrine and Loch Arklet.

== Name and etymology ==
The name &quot;Trossachs&quot; involves the Brittonic root &quot;trōs&quot; meaning &quot;across&quot; (c.f. Welsh &quot;traws&quot;), perhaps conserving the compound &quot;trawsfynydd&quot; meaning &quot;cross-hill&quot;.

Also suggested is a derivation from a Gaelic word for &quot;bristly&quot;.

==Geography==

The Trossachs glen lies between Ben A&#x27;an to the north and Ben Venue to the south, with Loch Katrine to the west and Loch Achray to the east. It lies at the centre of the wider region, which is generally regarded as being bounded by Glen Gyle to the south, with the western boundary being the road between Stronachlachar and Aberfoyle. Loch Doine, Loch Voil, and Loch Lubnaig form the northern and eastern boundary of the area.

The A821 road between Aberfoyle and Callander runs through this glen, and is the main access route into the Trossachs from the south and east. The section between Aberfoyle and the Trossachs glen runs through the Achray Forest, reaching a height of 238 m above sea level at the summit of the Duke&#x27;s Pass. The main route to Callander continues east via the north shores of Loch Achray and Loch Venachar, whilst a branch of the A821 heads west to finish at the western end of Loch Katrine. No public road continues along the shore of Loch Katrine, although the Great Trossachs Path allows walkers and cyclists to follow the northern shore round to Stronachlachar on the western shore. From here a minor road heads west to Loch Lomond. Stronachlachar can also be reached by the B829 road from Aberfoyle, which passes north of Loch Choin and Loch Ard.

The small town of Callander and the village of Aberfoyle lie at the edge of the Trossachs, however Brig o&#x27; Turk is the only settlement of any size within the Trossachs. The Lake of Menteith, situated near Aberfoyle, lies about six miles (10 km) to the south east of the glen, on the edge of the Trossachs area. The lake is a fishing destination that features the ruins of Inchmahome Priory on one of its islands, Inchmahome, where Mary, Queen of Scots was taken as a child before being taken to France for her protection.

==History==

There are several prehistoric sites in the area, including a cup and ring marked rock and burnt mounds in Glen Finglas. There are crannogs on Loch Ard and Loch Venachar, and an Iron Age hill fort at Dunmore.

The Trossachs were one of the first parts of Scotland to become a recognised tourist destination due to the area&#x27;s position on the southern edge of the highlands and the quality of the scenery, which may be considered to represent a microcosm of a typical highland landscape. The poet William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited the area, with Dorothy publishing an account of their visit in &quot;Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland&quot; in 1803.

The scenic charms of the area came to popularity with Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s 1810 poem &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;, extending his romantic portrayal of Scotland&#x27;s past from border ballads to poems of a medieval past rich in chivalry and symbolism. The poem gives a roll call of Trossachs place names, the lady herself being found on Loch Katrine. Scott followed up with his 1817 historical novel &quot;Rob Roy&quot; romanticising the outlaw cattle thief Raibert Ruadh, who was born by Loch Katrine and buried at nearby Balquhidder.

The leading Victorian art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900) and the Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais (1829–1896) spent the summer of 1853 together at Glenfinlas in the Trossachs. Millais started a painting of John Ruskin during the visit, which he finished the following year. The painting is held in a private collection, but was on show at an exhibition on the Pre-Raphaelites at Tate Britain in London during 2004. John Ruskin himself was especially interested in the rock formations in the area and undertook his own studies of these.

The Trossachs Hotel was built on the north bank of Loch Achray in response to the growing number of tourists visiting the region. The building now functions as the Tigh Mor Trossachs holiday apartments, owned by the Holiday Property Bond (HPB). In 1859, a dam was built at the eastern end of Loch Katrine and connecting aqueducts were added to as part of a new main water supply to Glasgow. At the expense of the Glasgow water company, Queen Victoria had a holiday house built overlooking the loch. The queen never stayed in the house, named &quot;Royal Cottage&quot;, as the windows were broken by the 21-gun salute that welcomed her, and the cottage later became accommodation for the employees of Scottish Water.

==Nature and conservation==

The forests of the Trossachs comprise both areas of ancient, semi-natural and traditionally managed woodland alongside commercial forestry plantations. The native woodland is largely deciduous, whilst the commercial forestry consists mostly of conifers. 

Fauna found in the woods of the Trossachs include black grouse, capercaillie and goshawk; mammal species include red and roe deer, red squirrel and pine marten. Beavers are also now present in the area, with signs of beaver activity being observed on Loch Achray during a survey undertaken over the winter of 2017–18; the beavers are assumed to have spread there from the existing population on the River Tay. 

Species of fish found in the lochs of the Trossachs include brown trout, perch and pike, and the lochs are also a habitat for osprey and otter. Arctic char are known to have lived in Loch Venachar and Loch Achray, but as of 2006 it was believed that they were no longer present. The more farmed areas of the Trossachs provide areas of marshland that are habitat for wildfowl and waders, with both wintering and breeding species recorded. In 2011 the pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly - a species considered rare in Britain - was found to be living around Loch Katrine, the first time the species had been identified in the area for 25 years.

Much of the Trossachs area is protected via several different conservation designations.

===Great Trossachs Forest National Nature Reserve===
The Great Trossachs Forest is a project that aims to deliver a 165 km2 forest in the heart of the Trossachs in order to develop a wide range of habitats for invertebrates, mammals, birds and other wildlife. Since 2015 the area, which covers much of the core area of the Trossachs around Loch Katrine and Loch Arklet (including the Trossachs glen), has been classified as national nature reserve with the title &quot;Great Trossachs Forest National Nature Reserve&quot;. The reserve is considered to be a &quot;forest in the making&quot;, and is managed jointly by Forestry and Land Scotland, RSPB Scotland and Woodland Trust Scotland. The reserve is classified as a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The project aims to deliver a varied landscape that provides habitats for species that are otherwise rare in Britain, including black grouse, golden eagle, osprey, wildcat, pine marten, red squirrel, water vole and otter.

===Other conservation designations===
A smaller area (378 ha) of the Trossachs is protected as a Special Area of Conservation due to importance of the existing native forest. The Trossachs are also defined as a national scenic area, being one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. Areas of forestry owned by Forestry and Land Scotland within the Trossachs form part of the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park, and the entire area lies within the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.

==Government and politics==
The Trossachs area forms part of the council area of Stirling; at the most local level there is a Trossachs Community Council.

The area is part of the registration county of Perth, lying in the most westerly part of the county, close to the border with County of Stirling. The area is represented in the Scottish Parliament as part of the constituency of Stirling, which elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the plurality (first past the post) method of election. The area also forms part of the Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region, which elects seven additional members, in addition to nine constituency MSPs, to produce a form of proportional representation for the region as a whole. At Westminster the Trossachs area is represented as part of a constituency also entitled Stirling, however this constituency, which elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, has different boundaries from the Scottish Parliament constituency.

==Hills and lochs==

The chief hills of the Trossachs are:
*Ben Venue (729 m)
*Ben A&#x27;an (454 m)
*Ben Ledi (879 m)
*Benvane (821 m)
*Ceann na Baintighearna (771 m)
*Stob a&#x27; Choin (865 m)

*Loch Arklet
*Loch Achray
*Loch Venachar
*Loch Drunkie
*Loch Voil
*Loch Doine
*Loch Lubnaig
*Loch Chon
*Loch Dubh

<doc id="884529" wikidata="Q289692" url="?curid=884529" title="Amber (Dutch singer)">
<text>Marie-Claire Cremers (born 9 May 1969), known professionally as Amber, is a Dutch-born singer, songwriter, label owner, and executive producer. She is best known for her hits &quot;This Is Your Night&quot;, &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;, and &quot;Sexual (Li Da Di)&quot;. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her as the 34th-most successful dance artist of all time. The magazine later declared her the #7 Dance Singles Sales Artist of the 2000s.

Amber is extremely popular among dance club music enthusiasts and especially in the gay community. She is an outspoken LGBTQ advocate who has headlined dozens of Pride celebrations, earning her recognition as one of the &quot;Queens of Pride&quot;.

Recently, Amber&#x27;s career has experienced a resurgence. Tommy Boy Records, the singer&#x27;s original label now owned by Reservoir Media, began releasing previously vaulted remixes of her songs to digital platforms worldwide in 2022. Six of 9 releases have been Top 3 hits on the iTunes US Dance Albums Chart, four going all the way to #1: &quot;Above the Clouds (Remixes),&quot; &quot;Love One Another (Remixes),&quot; &quot;Colour of Love (Remixes),&quot; and &quot;If You Could Read My Mind (25th Anniversary Edition)&quot;. The success of the 2022 and 2023 re-releases of Amber&#x27;s singles reignited interest in her catalog. Her &quot;This is Your Night (1996),&quot; &quot;Amber (1999),&quot; and &quot;Naked (2002)&quot; CDs charted on the Amazon Euro Pop and Dance Pop Bestsellers charts in Summer and Fall 2023 with &quot;Naked&quot; placing as high as #23.

==Career==

=== 1996–1997: &quot;This is Your Night&quot; ===
Amber&#x27;s music career took off when one of her demos, &quot;This Is Your Night&quot;, was released by Tommy Boy Records. The single was on the Hot 100 chart for one year in 1996 and 1997. The song was later used in the film &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; and appeared on many dance compilations.

A full-length album of the same name soon followed, which spawned two additional hit singles: &quot;Colour of Love&quot; and the Hani remix of &quot;One More Night&quot;.

=== 1998–1999: &quot;Amber&quot; ===
In 1999, Amber released her self-titled second album, which garnered the most mainstream attention thus far. The album was preceded in 1998 by the single &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;, both a cover version of the 1970 song of the same name by Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot and a collaboration with Ultra Naté and Jocelyn Enriquez; the trio recorded and performed the track under the name Stars on 54 for the closing scene and end credits of the Miramax film &quot;54&quot;. 

The first official single from &quot;Amber&quot; was &quot;Sexual (Li Da Di)&quot;, which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 17 weeks at #1 on the Singles Sales Chart. The album also included the #1 dance hits &quot;Above the Clouds&quot; and &quot;Love One Another&quot;. The former song as well as the album track &quot;Object of Your Desire&quot; later gained additional exposure when licensed for the television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.

In addition to the four American singles, German label ZYX also released &quot;Do That To Me One More Time&quot; and &quot;I Found Myself in You&quot;. &quot;Do That to Me One More Time&quot; was recorded exclusively for the European market and issued with an accompanying video that was shot in Manhattan.

=== 2000: &quot;The Hits Remixed&quot; ===
Amber&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Hits Remixed&quot;, was released in 2000. The album included remixes of all of her singles to that time, including &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;, as well as the non-album track &quot;Taste the Tears&quot;, which she recorded for the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Taste the Tears&quot; was written by Diane Warren and produced by Thunderpuss.

Remixes of &quot;Love One Another&quot; and &quot;Taste the Tears&quot; were commissioned to promote the album. &quot;Love One Another&quot;, which peaked at #1 on the Billboard Dance Club Play Chart, thus became the fourth overall single from &quot;Amber&quot; and the first from &quot;The Hits Remixed&quot;.

In addition to her own recordings, Amber co-wrote &quot;Bless You Child&quot;, which Bette Midler recorded on her 2000 album &quot;Bette&quot;, with Billy Steinberg and Rick Nowels. She also sang on Nile Rodgers&#x27; charity single &quot;We Are Family&quot;; Amber can be seen sharing the microphone with Dionne Warwick in the music video, directed by Spike Lee. 

Another milestone was achieved in 2001 when Cher covered &quot;Love One Another&quot; for her album &quot;Living Proof&quot;. In 2003, the song returned to #1 in Cher&#x27;s recording (as a double A-side with &quot;When the Money&#x27;s Gone&quot;) and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording, an accolade that Amber shared as co-songwriter.

=== 2001–2003: &quot;Naked&quot; and departure From Tommy Boy ===
Amber&#x27;s third album, &quot;Naked&quot;, was released in early 2002. Musically, Amber continued the path she had started with: she continued to co-write her own songs and lyrics and attempted even more of a departure from her original Eurodance sound. Three singles were culled from the album: &quot;Yes&quot;, 

The lead single &quot;Yes&quot; was written by Steinberg, Nowels, and Marie-Claire D&#x27;Ubaldo, who had previously penned Amber&#x27;s &quot;Above the Clouds&quot; as well as Celine Dion&#x27;s &quot;Falling Into You&quot;. The track used lyrics from James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which were licensed from Joyce&#x27;s estate; Joyce was credited as co-songwriter. Mainstream radio&#x27;s reaction to &quot;Yes&quot; was reminiscent of the attitude towards &quot;Sexual (Li Da Di)&quot; two years earlier. Programmers expressed concern about the perceived sexual subtext of the track and the use of the word &quot;breast&quot;. It was suggested that Amber change the lyric from &quot;breast&quot; to &quot;breath&quot;, which she refused to do.

Two further singles were released from the album: &quot;The Need to Be Naked&quot; and &quot;Anyway (Men Are From Mars)&quot;. The latter was Amber&#x27;s first single written entirely on her own.

Amber bought out her contract with Tommy Boy Records after the promotional cycle for &quot;Naked&quot;, citing creative differences. According to Amber, she was unhappy with the direction of her career as well as how the label had handled the marketing of &quot;Naked&quot;.

=== 2004–2005: &quot;My Kind of World&quot; ===
Following her departure from Tommy Boy, Amber created her own label, JMCA Enterprises, through which she issued her fourth album, &quot;My Kind of World&quot;, in 2004. The album&#x27;s moodier tone and more intimate songs were a departure from her previous uptempo dance music. Amber nevertheless released remixes for three singles: &quot;You Move Me&quot;, &quot;Voodoo&quot;, and &quot;Just Like That&quot;.

The same year, she released &quot;Undanced&quot;, a collection of previously unreleased remixes.

=== 2006–2011: Re-recordings and non-album singles ===
After promotion for &quot;My Kind of World&quot; had run its course, Amber collaborated with Sweet Rains on the stand-alone single &quot;Melt with the Sun&quot;. The single was released on December 12, 2006, and was remixed by Tracy Young, Hex Hector, and Lance Jordan among others.
In 2007, Amber re-recorded many of the tracks from her second and third albums for digital release, as well as &quot;Undanced II&quot;, which included entirely unreleased songs as well as demos and remixes. The following year, she re-released her debut single &quot;This Is Your Night&quot; with new remixes. She followed up by collaborating with Zelma Davis of C+C Music Factory fame on a cover of &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot;. Both songs were accompanied by new music videos. 

In 2009, she released &quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe in Hate (Drip Drop)&quot; after discovering the track on the MySpace page of singer/songwriter Kelly Mueller. In 2011, she issued her final new recording to date, a remake of &quot;One More Night&quot;.

=== 2022–present: Further reissues ===
In 2022, Tommy Boy Records, now under new ownership, began reissuing Amber&#x27;s hit singles with previously unreleased remixes, including:
*&quot;Sexual (Li Da Di)&quot; (Plasma Trance Remix – Extended) (May 2022)
*&quot;The Hits Remixed – Extended&quot; (June 2022)
*&quot;Above the Clouds&quot; (July 2022)
*&quot;Love One Another&quot; (August 2022)
*&quot;Colour of Love&quot; (September 2022)
*&quot;This Is Your Night&quot; (Special Edition) (June 2023)
*&quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot; (25th Anniversary Edition) (July 2023)
*&quot;Being with You&quot; (August 2023)
*&quot;Colour of Love&quot;, Part II (September 2023)
*&quot;One More Night&quot; (October 2023)
*&quot;Sexual (Li Da Di)&quot; (February 2024)

On May 31, 2024, a 25th anniversary edition of &quot;Amber&quot; was released on CD and vinyl. The set includes the original album as well as remixes.

<text>Kelvindale () is a district in the West End of the city of Glasgow, Scotland. Kelvindale shares the G12 postcode with the neighbouring residential districts of Kelvinside, Hillhead, Hyndland, Dowanhill, as well as Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow Clyde College (Anniesland) and the University of Glasgow, and is also close to the Anniesland and Wyndford areas of the city. The area is characterised by traditional interwar housing, formed of tenements and semi-detached houses.

==Construction==
Construction started in the late 1920s with work being undertaken by the City Corporation. This was followed up in the early 1930s by the Glasgow-based housebuilding company Mactaggart &amp; Mickel. The houses were intended for rent rather than for sale, they consisted of semi detached villas. A proportion of these houses were set aside for rent by Glasgow Corporation. The Corporation extended the building down Kelvindale Road towards Collins Paper Mill. Subsequently in the 1930s the Western Heritable Investment Company extended the district considerably by building the last range of pre-war tenements at Dorchester Avenue, Ripon Drive, etc. between 1934 and 1938. These tenements are unique since they are built on concrete rafts due to the heavy mine workings in the district from the Garscube Estate. They were planned as four-storey, but due to Scots law they were reduced to three stories.

The district is dominated by the Temple gas holders (erected in 1891, now de-commissioned and Category B listed in 2018) which were reputed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom. During the Second World War the Royal Air Force stationed a balloon unit on what is now ex-MoD housing on Dorchester Avenue. The large fields were once used for grazing horses and cattle but are now the site of more tenement building and the Kelvindale Primary School. Gibson Hall, a former Glasgow Caledonian University Hall of Residence which stood on Dorchester Avenue, was recently demolished to make way for a new build. Flanders House, built for soldiers of the Great War, was demolished in 2006 and has been replaced by a modern construction.

Many of the street names in the area are named after places in England: these include Dorchester, Hertford and Leicester Avenues, Colchester, Chelmsford, Manchester, Kendal, Penrith, Northampton, Ripon, Southampton, Weymouth and Winchester Drives, and Beaconsfield Road. A few are named after Scottish placenames, including Grandtully Drive and Fortingall Avenue.

In the early 2000s, Kelvindale remained a desirable family area near the city&#x27;s West End. In 2007, Bryant Homes controversially removed a large number of trees from a local lane to provide better access to a new housing development. The actor Robert Carlyle was among those who protested against the felling. In July 2009, a suspected arson attack caused considerable damage to the site. One partially constructed four story housing block burnt to the ground and the only occupied building on the site was evacuated.

==Transport==
Kelvindale railway station was opened on 26 September 2005. It is situated on the line from Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) to Anniesland, an extension of the Maryhill Line.

Several bus routes including the frequent 6 and 6A services operate along the nearby A82 road Great Western Road. While the 94 service operates both ways along Kelvindale Road - Cleveden Road along Dorchester Avenue and Gt Western Road via the nearby Wyndford Estate to and from Knightswood/Anniesland Cross. The M4 service operates both ways along Dorchester Avenue and Cleveden Road to Partick Bus Station.

The Kelvin Cycle Way which links into the Forth and Clyde Canal cycle path runs through the area.

== Education ==

Kelvindale Primary School is a non-denominational state primary school located in Kelvindale. The increasing number of residents in the 1920s lead to the desire for a local primary school, as children had to travel to Hyndland Primary School (located on the present day site of Hyndland Secondary School) in the neighbouring district of Hyndland. After the second world war, an annexe of Hyndland Primary School was built in Kelvindale (within the present day grounds of Cleveden Secondary School. The two concrete huts were thought to have catered for the first three years of primary school education. In 1963, Kelvindale Primary School was built. The original school consisted of one building with 8 classrooms, and opened its doors on 24 August 1964 with a roll of 248 pupils. Over the years, the school roll increased requiring an annexe of two classrooms to be built in 1971. Another addition came in 1977, when a building specifically to house the infants was opened. The football pitch was sold to become flats and subsequently a new AstroTurf pitch was built opening in late 2006.

==Notable buildings==
Kelvindale contains St. John&#x27;s Renfield Church (the local Church of Scotland parish church), Glasgow Nuffield Hospital, Cleveden Secondary School and Kelvindale Primary School.

In recent years, at Cleveden Secondary School and Kelvindale Primary School, the ash football pitches have been sold and replaced by new astroturf pitches.

Historic images of the Kelvindale area can be found on the Virtual Mitchell website.

<doc id="884545" wikidata="Q2248798" url="?curid=884545" title="Lake Vyrnwy">
<text>Lake Vyrnwy (, or &quot;&quot;) is a reservoir in Powys, Wales, built in the 1880s for Liverpool Corporation Waterworks to supply Liverpool with fresh water. It flooded the head of the Vyrnwy () valley and submerged the village of Llanwddyn.

The Lake Vyrnwy Nature Reserve and Estate that surrounds the lake is jointly managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and Hafren Dyfrdwy and is a popular destination for ornithologists, cyclists and hikers. The reserve is designated as a national nature reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Special Protection Area, and a Special Area of Conservation.

==Geography==
Lake Vyrnwy is a reservoir in Powys, Wales, created in 1888 by flooding the head of the River Vyrnwy () valley. 
The river flows from the dam into Shropshire where it converges with the River Severn near the village of Melverley on the Welsh border and outflows into the Bristol Channel.

When the reservoir is full, it is deep, contains , and covers an area of , the equivalent of around 600 football pitches. The lake has a perimeter of with a road that goes all the way around it. Its length is .

311 brooks, waterfalls and rivers flow into the lake and are named after the mountains or hillsides they flow from. The main ones, clockwise from the west side of the dam, are named &quot;Afon Hirddu, Eunant, Afon Eiddew, Afon Naedroedd, Afon Cedig&quot; and &quot;Afon Y Dolau Gwynionew.&quot;

On the northern edge of the lake is a small hamlet called Rhiwargor where the rivers Afon Eiddew and Afon Naedroedd meet. Up the valley of Afon Eiddew is a waterfall known locally as Pistyll Rhyd-y-meincau, commonly known as Rhiwargor waterfall.

===Climate===
==Construction==

In 1879, George Deacon was instructed to prepare the parliamentary plans for the Vyrnwy Dam. The valley was chosen because of its size, favourable geology and its source, the River Vyrnwy, having a large water catchment area.

Thomas Hawksley was appointed as engineer-in-chief and prepared the design for a stone dam. Dam construction with great blocks of Welsh slate started in 1881 and was completed in 1888. Hawksley resigned in 1885 because of a conflict with George Deacon who was appointed as joint engineer. The dam was the first large stone-built dam in the United Kingdom and cost £620,000 (equivalent to £ million in ). Earlier dams in Britain had been built using great earth embankments to hold back the water. In 1889, shortly after completion, the lake was stocked with 400,000 Loch Leven trout.

Between 1881 and 1892 the aqueducts carrying water to Liverpool were constructed.

Construction of the dam flooded the village of Llanwddyn. The residents of the village were not consulted about the proposal for a dam and opposed the plan. Their relocation involved the demolition of a church, two chapels, three inns, ten farmhouses, and 37 houses. A new settlement to house them was built lower down the valley by Liverpool Corporation.

==Description ==
The Vyrnwy dam is high from the bottom of the valley, and thick at the base; it is long and has a road bridge running along the top. It is decorated with 31 arches each spanning and two small towers each with four corner turrets rising above the road surface. The dam was the first to be constructed with drainage tunnels designed to prevent a build up of pressure beneath the base. It is listed as a Grade I historic building by Cadw.

The dam was the first to carry water over its crest instead of in a channel at the side. At the bottom of the dam is a body of water known as a stilling basin necessary to absorb the energy when the water flows over the crest and into the valley, and to stop the water eroding the foundations of the dam.

A power house located under the west tower contains an electrical generator driven by water leaving the reservoir. Before mains electricity arrived in the 1960s this was the area&#x27;s only source of power.

About from the dam is the reservoir&#x27;s straining tower. Standing only from the shore, its purpose is to filter or strain out material in the water with a fine metal mesh, before the water flows along the aqueduct to Liverpool. Its architecture represents Gothic revival, built at the same time as the dam. The tower as a whole is tall, of which is above top water level, and is topped with a pointed copper-clad roof, coloured light green.

The west and east towers release compensation water into the River Vyrnwy through huge valves; the river would dry up unless a minimum flow was maintained. Depending on the levels downstream, the reservoir can release from of compensation water daily. The flow is measured by Natural Resources Wales at a weir a few hundred metres downstream.

==Water supply==

===19th century===
The water from Lake Vyrnwy is carried in the &quot;Vyrnwy Large Diameter Trunk Main&quot; (LDTM) aqueduct which originally consisted of two pipelines, made largely of cast iron. To help maintenance work on the diameter cast-iron tunnel which took the aqueduct under the Mersey, riveted steel piping was also used, which was to become the norm for trunk water-main piping.

The aqueducts cross the valley floor near Penybontfawr and then runs north of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant and Efail-rhyd on the north-east of the Tanat Valley. The aqueducts are largely underground although there are some visible surface features including air valves, the Cileos valve house, the Parc-uchaf balancing reservoirs, and a deep cutting to the west of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant.

Brick and concrete-lined tunnels carried pipes at Hirnant, Cynynion and Llanforda, and a fourth was later added at Aber, so that the Hirnant tunnel could be made accessible for maintenance.

===20th century===
From 1926 to 1938 the first section of a third pipeline was laid using bituminous-coated steel. in 1946, a fourth pipeline was added south of Oswestry to increase capacity to 227 million litres per day.

In 1978–81, the pipe crossings beneath the Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal were reorganised. 
After privatisation of the water companies, responsibility for the Vyrnwy Dam and associated structures fell to Severn Trent Water, and since 2018 to its subsidiary company Hafren Dyfrdwy. 
The rights to the water abstraction are with United Utilities for drinking water supply to Liverpool.

===21st century===
In 2013, United Utilities commenced a major refurbishment of the entire of the &quot;LDTM&quot; aqueduct, which was scheduled for completion in 2020.
As of 2014 water provision relied on three parallel, 80 km long gravity pipelines, in diameter delivering up to per day into reservoirs at Prescot, east of Liverpool, which supplied customers in Cheshire and Merseyside.

==Nature reserve and conservation==

Lake Vyrnwy is a designated Nature Reserve. The RSPB has several bird hides around the lake, where a number of rare species of birds are known to be breeding, including the peregrine falcon, the pied flycatcher, the common redstart, the Eurasian siskin and the wood warbler. Every spring they host a dawn chorus tour.

Around 90 species of bird have been recorded as breeding on the reserve, and six species of bat, including the pipistrelle and brown long-eared bat. Butterfly species include purple hairstreaks, commas and peacocks. Dragonflies include golden ringed, common hawker and four spotted chaser.

Managing the moorland helps improve the habitat for red grouse and the short-eared owl.
Heather moorland which grows on the mountains around the lake is now being restored. In the past, heather was burnt, cut and the seeds collected to be sowed where the heather has gone. Burning at the Lake Vyrnwy moorland is no longer carried out, as the burning can have negative consequences for water management, namely water colouration.

Sheep, cattle and ponies also graze on the heather, managed by tenant farmers who farm the moorland in accordance with organic agriculture.

Broadleaf trees are being planted to replace coniferous trees, and man-made features such as hedgerows and dry-stone walls are also being restored, and wildflower areas are being restored to help insects, birds and other wildlife.

==Tourism==

===Wood sculpture===
Llanwddyn has had since 1995 a sculpture park in the valley below the dam, containing many wooden carved works. There are large wooden picnic benches in the shape of leaves and trees on the west side of the lake at Llechwedd Ddu. Near the old village on the beach is a sculpture of dolphins which, when the lake rises in a flood, appear to be jumping out of the water. Several totems are carved into standing trees and re-erected fallen trunks.

===Recreation===
Activities in the area include sailing, hiking on Glyndŵr&#x27;s Way, rock climbing, cycling, walking and horse riding. The Lake Vyrnwy Half Marathon is conducted annually. The RSPB have laid out seven waymarked trails ranging from in a range of habitats.

===Tallest tree===
The site was once home to the tallest tree in the UK, a Douglas Fir high. This was damaged in stormy weather during the winter of 2010-2011 and had to be felled at 124 years old in March 2011. A stump was left intact, which in autumn 2011 had its top carved into a tall giant outstretched hand. A nearby Douglas Fir is now, at , the tallest tree in Wales.

<text>The Faroese Communist Party () was founded at a conference in Tórshavn 14th-15 June 1975. In 1974 a communist group had started organizing in the Faroe Islands which preceded the foundation conference. The chairman of KFF used to be Egon Thomsen and the party secretary Tórður Jóansson. Between 1975 and 1978 the publication of the KFF was &quot;Tíðin&quot;, from 1983 to 1993 the publication was &quot;Fríu Føroyar&quot;. The KFF enjoyed relations with the Communist Party of Denmark (DKP), but was not a section of the party. The party ceased activity in 1993.

<doc id="884570" wikidata="Q327594" url="?curid=884570" title="Final Fantasy XII">
<text>is a 2006 role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix. The twelfth main installment of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, it was first released for the PlayStation 2 in March 2006. It introduced several innovations to the series: an open world; a seamless battle system; a controllable camera; a customizable &quot;&quot; system, which lets the player control the artificial intelligence (AI) of characters in battle; a &quot;license&quot; system, which determines what abilities and equipment can be used by characters; and hunting side quests, which allows the player to find and defeat increasingly difficult monsters in the game&#x27;s open world. &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; also includes elements from previous games in the series, such as Chocobos and Moogles.

The game takes place in Ivalice, where the empires of Archadia and Rozarria are waging an endless war. Dalmasca, a small kingdom, is caught between the warring nations. When Dalmasca is annexed by Archadia, its princess, Ashe, creates a resistance movement. During the struggle, she meets Vaan, a young adventurer who dreams of becoming a sky pirate in command of an airship. They are quickly joined by a band of allies; together, they rally against the tyranny of the Archadian Empire.

&quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; was both a critical and commercial success, earning several Game of the Year awards and selling over six million copies on the PlayStation 2 by November 2009. In 2007, a sequel titled &quot;Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings&quot; was released for the Nintendo DS and, in that same year, an expanded version of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, titled &quot;Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System&quot;, was released on the PlayStation 2 exclusively in Japan. A high-definition remaster of the &quot;International Zodiac Job System&quot; version, &quot;The Zodiac Age&quot;, was released worldwide for the PlayStation 4 in July 2017, for Windows in February 2018, and for the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One in April 2019.

==Gameplay==
Throughout the game, the player directly controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies. Unlike previous games in the series, the player can also control the camera with the right analog stick, allowing for a 360° view of the surroundings. While in towns and cities, the player may only see from the perspective of Vaan, but any character may be controlled in the field. The world of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain as seen in the earlier &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the overworld on foot, Chocobo, or by airship. Players may save their game to a memory card using save crystals or gate crystals, and may use the latter to teleport between gate crystals. An in-game bestiary provides incidental information about the world of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;.

&quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; restructures the system of earning gil, the currency of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games; instead of gil, most enemies drop &quot;loot&quot; which can be sold at shops. This ties into a new battle mechanic which rewards the player with improved loot for slaying a particular type of enemy multiple times in a row. Selling different types of loot also unlocks a bazaar option in shops, which provides items at a lower cost, or items exclusive to the bazaar.

===Battle system===
Excluding the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; is the first entry in the main &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series not to include random encounters. Instead, enemies are visible in the overworld and the player may choose to fight or avoid them. Battles unfold in real time using the &quot;Active Dimension Battle&quot; (ADB) system. Battles begin when the party comes within range of an aggressive enemy, the party attacks an enemy, or a story event initiates a confrontation. When a character or enemy begins an action, target lines connect characters to other party members or enemies; different colors represent the different types of action. The player may swap to and issue commands to any of the three characters in the party, but guest characters are controlled by artificial intelligence (AI). Battle commands are initiated through a series of menus, and include Attack, Magicks, Technicks, Mist, Gambits, and Items. The player may switch any active character with an inactive character at any time, unless the active character is targeted by an attack or ability. Characters who are knocked out may also be substituted.

A new feature in the game is the &quot;gambit&quot; system, which allows the player to program each character to perform certain commands in battle in response to specified conditions. Using gambits, the player may set reactions to different stimuli for each character. Each gambit consists of three parts: a target, an action, and a priority. The target specifies which ally or foe to act on and the condition for applying the action. For example, the target &quot;Ally: HP &lt; 70%&quot; causes the character to target any ally whose hit points have fallen below 70%. The action is the command to be performed on the target. The priority determines which gambit to perform when multiple gambits are triggered. These heuristics guide the characters when acting autonomously, though player-directed commands are always given top priority.

In &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, a mysterious phenomenon known as &quot;Mist&quot; is the key energy which allows characters to cast summoning magic and perform &quot;Quickenings&quot;. After defeating an Esper in combat, the player will be able to summon it to the battlefield. Similar to &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, the summoned creatures become active participants in battle, as opposed to the cinematic attacks seen in previous games in the series. Unlike &quot;X&quot;, however, Espers follow hidden gambits, rather than the player&#x27;s direct command. The summoner remains an active member in the fight, able to attack and cast support magic, instead of leaving the party or standing idle while the summoned creature fights. An Esper will leave the battle if either the summoner or itself is knocked out, its time limit expires, or it executes its special attack. Some Espers have origins in &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and &quot;Tactics Advance&quot; and others are derived from the final bosses of previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games such as Chaos, the final boss of the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, and Zeromus, the final boss of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;.

&quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; introduces &quot;Quickenings&quot;, a new Limit Break system unique compared to those in previous games in the series. Characters learn Quickenings by progressing to specific panels on the License Board. Each character can learn three Quickenings, which are unique to that character. Characters may string together Quickenings into large combo attacks, called Mist Chains, via timed button presses. If a Mist Chain reaches a certain length, a final strike will be initiated at the end of the Quickening cycle, called a Concurrence.

===Growth system===
As in many role-playing games (RPGs), characters &quot;level up&quot; each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character&#x27;s statistics and improves performance in battle. Statistics include hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; strength, the power of the character&#x27;s physical attacks; and magic, the potency of the character&#x27;s magical spells.

In addition to leveling up, players may improve their characters via the License Board. The License Board is an array of panels that contain &quot;licenses&quot; which allow a character to perform certain actions. The board is split into two parts; the upper part comprises Magick, Technick, Accessory, and Augment (stat increases and other permanent buffs) licenses, and the bottom part comprises mostly Weapon and Armor licenses. To use a Magick, Technick, or piece of equipment, the character must obtain its corresponding license by spending the required amount of LP (License Points). LP are earned in battle along with the experience points. Like the Sphere Grid in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, all characters may obtain all licenses on the board, but each Quickening and Esper license may only be activated by a single character.

==Plot==
===Setting===

&quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; is set within the land of Ivalice during an age when &quot;magic was commonplace&quot; and &quot;airships plied the skies, crowding out the heavens&quot;. At this time, magicite, a magic-rich mineral, is commonly used in magic spells and in powering airships—a popular form of transportation in Ivalice. Ivalice is divided into three continents: Ordalia, Valendia, and Kerwon. Ordalia is located in the western part of Ivalice. The Rozarrian Empire makes its home in the vast inland plains of this continent as the eastern portion of it is largely desert and &quot;jagd&quot;—lawless regions so rich in Mist, the ethereal manifestation of magicite, that airships cannot function. Valendia is the home of Imperial Archadia, where lush highlands dot the landscape. Central to the story is Dalmasca, a small kingdom between the two continents and empires. Located in the middle of the Galtean Peninsula of Ordalia, Dalmasca is surrounded by an expanse of desert. The temperate climate of Dalmasca differs from the cold environs of Kerwon to the south and the lush plains of Valendia and Ordalia. During this time, Ivalice is beset by the pending war between the forces of Rozarria and Archadia. Caught between the two powerful Empires, Dalmasca and a number of smaller nations have already been subjugated by Archadia two years before the game begins.

===Characters===

The six main playable characters in &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; are Vaan (Bobby Edner/Kouhei Takeda), an energetic orphan of Rabanastre who dreams of becoming a sky pirate; Ashe (Kari Wahlgren/Mie Sonozaki), a determined princess of Dalmasca who lost her father and her husband in the Archadian invasion; Basch (Keith Ferguson/Rikiya Koyama), a disgraced knight of Dalmasca charged with treason for slaying the king; Balthier (Gideon Emery/Hiroaki Hirata), a gentlemanly sky pirate who pilots his airship, the &quot;Strahl&quot;; Fran (Nicole Fantl/Rika Fukami), Balthier&#x27;s partner and a Viera exile whose knowledge extends to legends and myths; and Penelo (Catherine Taber/Marina Kozawa), Vaan&#x27;s childhood friend who accompanies him on journeys to &quot;keep an eye on him&quot;.

The Archadian Empire is ruled by House Solidor, headed by Emperor Gramis (Roger L. Jackson/Hidekatsu Shibata). The emperor&#x27;s sons are Vayne (Elijah Alexander/Nobuo Tobita) and Larsa (Johnny McKeown/Yuka Imai), the former a military genius and the game&#x27;s main antagonist, and the latter a charismatic seeker of peace. Judge Magisters, upholders of Archadian law, protect House Solidor and execute every command issued by the ruling family. The technological marvels of airships and synthetic nethicite—a form of magicite that absorbs Mist—are thanks to Doctor Cid (John Rafter Lee/Chikao Ōtsuka), a prominent researcher from Archadia. The Resistance against Archadia includes Dalmascan knight Vossler (Nolan North/Masaki Terasoma), an ally of Basch; Marquis Halim Ondore IV (Tom Kane/Akio Nojima), the game&#x27;s narrator and ruler of the skycity Bhujerba; Reddas (Phil LaMarr/Takayuki Sugo), a sky pirate based in the port at Balfonheim; and the Rozarrian Empire, of which Al-Cid Margrace (David Rasner/Norio Wakamoto) is a prince of the ruling family. The mythos of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; revolves around a character known as Dynast-King Raithwall, a man who once united Ivalice to create the Galtean Alliance in ages past.

===Story===
In Dalmasca&#x27;s capital city of Rabanastre, Princess Ashelia (Ashe) of Dalmasca and Prince Rasler of Nabradia have just wed, as the Archadian Empire invades the two countries. Rasler is killed in the war, the city of Nabudis is destroyed in a single explosion, and the Dalmascan King Raminas is assassinated moments after signing a treaty of surrender. Marquis Ondore announces that the assassin was Dalmascan captain Basch, who has been sentenced to death, and that Princess Ashe has committed suicide.

Two years later, Vaan, a Rabanastre street urchin, ignores his friend Penelo&#x27;s objections and infiltrates the palace during a dinner celebrating the appointment of Archadian prince Vayne Solidor as consul. In the treasury he finds a piece of magicite, a powerful magical crystal. He is discovered by Balthier and Fran, a pair of sky pirates looking for the magicite. The three escape as Dalmascan Resistance forces assault the palace, and in the sewers they meet the Resistance leader, Amalia, before being captured by Archadian forces. In the dungeons they meet Basch, who was imprisoned but not killed, and who states his twin brother Gabranth was the one to kill the king. The four then escape together back to Rabanastre. There they discover Penelo has been kidnapped and taken to the floating city of Bhujerba.

In Bhujerba, they meet Lamont, a curious boy who is Vayne&#x27;s younger brother, Larsa, in disguise. After they rescue Penelo, Basch confronts the Marquis over his lies, but the party is captured and detained aboard the Archadian airship &quot;Leviathan&quot;, headed by Judge Ghis. On the &quot;Leviathan&quot;, the party is reunited with Amalia, who is revealed to be Princess Ashe. Ghis takes the magicite, which is revealed to be a royal Dalmascan artifact, &quot;deifacted nethicite&quot;. The party escapes, but as Ashe had planned to use the magicite as proof that she was the princess, the group journeys to collect another of the pieces of nethicite, the Dawn Shard. They are again captured by Ghis; when he tries to use the Dawn Shard in the &quot;Leviathan&quot; rather than the &quot;manufacted&quot; (artificially made) magicite it normally uses, his entire airship fleet is destroyed in a mirror of the destruction of Nabudis, and the party flees again.

They encounter Larsa, who seeks a peace treaty between Dalmasca and the empire. The group and Larsa go to Mt. Bur-Omisace to seek the Gran Kiltias Anastasis, Ivalice&#x27;s religious leader, and beg his approval of Ashe as queen of Dalmasca. There they also meet Al-Cid Margrace, who is in talks with Larsa to avert a war between Rozarria and Archadia. Their plans are curtailed when Anastasis is killed by Archadia, and soon afterwards the Archadian emperor Gramis dies and Vayne ascends the throne.

The party journeys to Archadia, where they discover Doctor Cid, the creator of manufacted magicite, who directs them to go to Giruvegan to find the source of nethicite. In Giruvegan, Ashe encounters the makers of nethicite, the immortal Occuria, who &quot;pull the strings of history&quot;; they give her the Treaty Blade to cut new pieces from the Sun-cryst, the source of all nethicite and its power. She learns that Venat, one of the Occuria, has defected to put the &quot;reins of History back in the hands of Man&quot;, manipulating Vayne in his quest to conquer Ivalice and leading Cid to create manufacted magicite to reduce the relative power of the Occuria.

Ashe and the party journey to the Sun-cryst, where she decides not to take her revenge by following the Occuria&#x27;s wishes, but instead destroy the Sun-cryst. The party defeats Gabranth, who reveals that he killed King Raminas, and destroys the crystal. Al-Cid tells them that the Dalmascan Resistance, led by Ondore, is about to fight Archadia in Rabanastre, but the Archadian forces now include the Sky Fortress &quot;Bahamut&quot;. They infiltrate the &quot;Bahamut&quot;, and find Larsa failing to dissuade his brother Vayne from his plans for war. They defeat Vayne and Venat, and Ashe and Larsa announce the end of the conflict to the battlefield. Larsa becomes the Archadian emperor and Ashe the Queen of Dalmasca; Basch replaces his brother Gabranth as Larsa&#x27;s protector; Vaan and Penelo fly an airship to meet Balthier and Fran for another adventure.

==Development==
Development for &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; began in December 2000 and was headed by &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; director Yasumi Matsuno and &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; director Hiroyuki Ito. Matsuno provided the original concept and plot but was forced to bow out a year before release due to health concerns. The team was restructured as a consequence: the new directorial duo consisted of Ito and Hiroshi Minagawa, while Akitoshi Kawazu of &quot;SaGa&quot; series fame became the game&#x27;s executive producer. Series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi was disappointed by Matsuno&#x27;s departure and declined to play the game beyond its introduction.

The desire to move away from random encounters was present since the beginning of development. This desire fueled the development of the Active Dimension Battle system so players could seamlessly move from battle to exploration. The gambit system was conceived early on as a way to facilitate this change. Battle system designer Hiroshi Tomomatsu said that it gradually moved away from a complex and rigid formula to the more flexible form seen in the final version of the game. Ito drew inspiration for gambits from plays in American football where each team member has a specific job to do based on the conditions and desired outcome. As for the license system, he explained that needing &quot;licenses&quot; to perform certain actions was a natural extension of the rigid structured society of Archadia, as epitomized by its Judges.

At the early stages of development, Minagawa revealed that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the technical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.

Design inspiration came from a mix of medieval Mediterranean countries as demonstrated by the architectural styles found throughout Ivalice along with many of the races populating the region. The art team, led by art directors Hideo Minaba and Isamu Kamikokuryō, visited Turkey, which influenced the game&#x27;s Mediterranean-style setting. The developers also used styles and deco from other sources including areas in India and New York City. Of note is the use of Sanskrit in the city of Bhujerba. Phrases such as &quot;svagatam&quot; (welcome) and titles like &quot;parijanah&quot; (guide) are lifted directly from Sanskrit. Minaba mentions that the team tried to bring out Arabic culture in the design of the game. War is a prominent theme of the game and the developers stated that the cutscene battles are influenced by Ancient Rome. When asked to comment on the fan observation of &quot;Star Wars&quot; similarities, Minaba replied that although he was a fan of the series, it was not necessarily an influence to the game&#x27;s designs. It has also been noted that the similarities originate from &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;, the 1958 Akira Kurosawa film that inspired &quot;Star Wars&quot;.
The developers initially planned to return to the &quot;big-headed&quot; character designs of previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, but settled on similar proportions as characters in &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, the team&#x27;s previous game, as development progressed. Basch was the first character designed and the developers considered him the &quot;hero&quot; of the story at the time. Vaan and Penelo were added last and became the heroes in the final version of the plot. The developers were motivated by the commercial failure of &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, which featured a &quot;strong man in his prime&quot; as the protagonist, and switched the focus to a younger protagonist as a result. Vaan&#x27;s early designs were described as effeminate, but with the casting of Kouhei Takeda as his voice and motion capture actor, Vaan became less feminine and more &quot;active, upbeat, bright and positive&quot;. Comments were made about the similarity between character designer Akihiko Yoshida&#x27;s creations and those of Tetsuya Nomura, another Square Enix character designer. Yoshida felt this comparison was sparked by the choice of color used by both artists, which was based on maintaining consistent color between the characters and the environments. Non-human characters and races play a prominent role in the game, which was influenced by an interest in history among the developers.

Miwa Shoda wrote a storyline for the game premised on the basis of the cutscenes and world setting that had already been finished when she joined the team. Scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe in turn fleshed out Shoda&#x27;s plot into a script. During the English localization process, Alexander O. Smith, who had previously worked on &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, acted as producer and translator. While still preserving the meaning behind the Japanese script, Smith made the decision to use different dialects of English to reproduce the regional differences in pronunciation found in the Japanese version. He also tried to distance the game from the &quot;flat reads&quot; found in other dubbed work by casting voice actors who had experience in theatre work. In terms of general changes, the localization team introduced widescreen 16:9 ratio support and reinserted scenes that were left out of the original Japanese version for political reasons and to preserve an &quot;All Ages&quot; CERO rating.

A playable demo of the game was shipped with the North American release of &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot; in November 2005. To commemorate the release of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, playable demos of the English version were available at DigitalLife&#x27;s Gaming Pavilion in New York City on October 11, 2006, a day dubbed &quot;&quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; Gamer&#x27;s Day&quot;. Additionally, Square Enix gave fans the chance to cosplay as characters from &quot;XII&quot;. Each person was asked to show Square Enix three photos of his or her costume for a chance to win a trip to New York and participate in the &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; Gamer&#x27;s Day event.

&quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; once held the Guinness World Record for longest development period in a video game production, with a total of five years, spanning from 2001 until its release in 2006. At a &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; &quot;postmortem&quot; at MIT in March 2009, Hiroshi Minagawa mentioned that several years of production were devoted to the creation of custom tools used for the development of the game. It was also listed as 8th on the Guinness top 50 games of all time in 2009.

===Music===

Hitoshi Sakimoto composed and arranged most of the game&#x27;s soundtrack, with Hayato Matsuo and Masaharu Iwata creating seven and two tracks respectively. Nobuo Uematsu, following his departure from Square Enix in 2004, only contributed the ending song, &quot;Kiss Me Good-Bye&quot;. Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu&#x27;s footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way. &quot;Kiss Me Good-Bye&quot; was performed in both English and Japanese by Angela Aki. Aki&#x27;s style of playing the keyboard while singing reminded Uematsu of his childhood idol, Elton John, which was one of the reasons he chose her. The English version of the song was featured in both the Japanese and North American versions of the game. In addition to the theme song, violinist Taro Hakase co-composed, arranged, and performed the game&#x27;s ending credits theme, &quot;Symphonic Poem &quot;Hope&quot;&quot;, along with Yuji Toriyama.

Two promotional soundtracks were released before the original soundtrack, &quot;Symphonic Poem &quot;Hope&quot;&quot; and &quot;The Best of the Final Fantasy XII Soundtrack&quot;, on March 1 and 15, 2006, respectively. The former contains all the music used in the game&#x27;s trailer performed by Taro Hakase, including &quot;Symphonic Poem &quot;Hope&quot;&quot;. The original soundtrack itself was released two months later in Japan on May 31. It consists of 4 CDs with 100 tracks, and includes promotional tracks not in the final version of the game. The CD single for &quot;Kiss Me Good-Bye&quot; was released on the March 15, 2006. A limited edition was also released, featuring a DVD containing the music video for &quot;Kiss Me Good-Bye&quot;. Tofu Records has released an abridged version of the original soundtrack, which contains 31 songs, including &quot;Kiss Me Good-Bye&quot;.

==Merchandise==
On March 16, 2006, Sony Computer Entertainment Japan released a special &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; package, which contained a PlayStation 2 game system, the &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; game, a standard DualShock controller, and a vertical console stand. The Japanese third-party manufacturer Hori also released &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; memory cards on the day of the game&#x27;s release; stickers of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; characters are included. Game peripheral maker Logicool (Logitech&#x27;s Japanese branch) released a special edition &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; controller on the same day. Suntory produced &quot;Final Fantasy XII Potion&quot;—a drink containing such ingredients as royal jelly, chamomile, sage, thyme, and marjoram. The drinks became commercially available in Japan on March 7. Suntory also released a &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; Premium Box, which came with a &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; collector&#x27;s card. The Potion was a limited edition product and is no longer available. &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; was also adapted into a manga by . Square Enix published the series in a total of five &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes from December 22, 2006, to August 22, 2009.

Studio BentStuff published three Ultimania books in 2006: &quot;Final Fantasy XII Battle Ultimania&quot; and the &quot;Final Fantasy XII Scenario Ultimania&quot; on June 16, and &quot;Final Fantasy XII Ultimania Ω&quot; on November 24. The &quot;Battle Ultimania&quot; provides a description and analysis of the new battle system and its components, and developer interviews. The &quot;Scenario Ultimania&quot; describes the main scenarios in the game, profiles on the characters and areas in Ivalice, developer interviews, and details on each location. The last guide, the &quot;Ultimania Ω&quot;, includes voice actor interviews, the complete story of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; including additional character profiles, a collection of artworks and illustrations, the complete play guide, and a novella written by Benny Matsuyama, author of &quot;Hoshi wo Meguru Otome&quot; from the &quot;Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω Guide&quot;. Another Ultimania edition, the &quot;Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System Ultimania&quot;, was released on September 6, 2007, as a guide book for the International Zodiac version of the game. The game was re-released as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box&quot; Japanese package in December 2012.

For the North American release, a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; was available through GameStop and EB Games. This edition includes the original game packaged in a metallic case along with a special bonus disc, which contains &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; developer interviews, an art gallery, U.S. and Japanese trailers, and a featurette, &quot;History of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;&quot;, which gives a brief overview of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. On January 26, 2007, Square Enix Product Blog revealed full-color Gabranth, Ashe, Balthier, and Vaan figures.

In 2007, Balthier was featured in &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions&quot; as a playable character.

==Reception==
&quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; according to review aggregator Metacritic. It was the sixth game to receive a perfect score from the Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot;. It is also the second Yasumi Matsuno game to garner a perfect score, the first being &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;. The game was praised for its graphics, scenarios, game system, and the freshness it brought to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. It was praised for its seamless transitions between full motion video segments and the in-game engine, and was voted number one for Best Art Style on &quot;IGN&quot;″s weekly Top Ten. &quot;Newtype USA&quot; named &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; its &quot;Game of the Month&quot; for November 2006, praised the gameplay, graphics, and story, and called it &quot;the best RPG to have been released for any Sony platform&quot;.

Although &quot;GameSpot&quot; lauded the gambit and license systems as an innovative and in-depth way for the player to control the characters, it criticized them for being too complicated and difficult to adjust to, especially for newer players of the series. The reviewer also criticized the sometimes tedious back and forth travel. On the other hand, GameSpot took particular note of the &quot;excellent&quot; voice cast. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the game&#x27;s rich storyline and artistic direction, shown through its &quot;sheer depth of character&quot;. It also assuaged criticism that the gambit system would &quot;let the game play itself&quot;, countering that gambits do not function without a player. However, &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that while &quot;still extremely strong&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; has one of the series&#x27; weaker soundtracks.

Executive producer Akitoshi Kawazu was pleased by &quot;Famitsu&quot; rating but admitted that he thought the game was not perfect; he felt that the storyline did not meet some fans&#x27; expectations. Kawazu expressed his frustration and regrets regarding the storyline, citing creative differences between the PlayOnline and &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; members of the development team.

&quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; was named best PlayStation 2 game and best RPG by numerous video game journals and websites, including &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;GameSpy&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot;. Both &quot;Edge&quot; and &quot;Famitsu&quot; awarded it Game of the Year 2006. The Japan Game Awards 2006 honored &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; with their &quot;Grand Award&quot; and &quot;Award for Excellence&quot; and the PlayStation Awards 2006 bestowed the &quot;Double Platinum Prize&quot;. It was selected for the list &quot;Top 100 New Japanese Styles&quot;, a list of &quot;products and services originating in Japan to serve as a mark of excellence&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; also received nominations in such categories as best RPG, story, art direction, character design and original musical score at the AIAS&#x27; Interactive Achievement Awards, Game Developers Choice Awards, BAFTA Video Games Awards, Spike Video Game Awards, and the Satellite Awards.

==Sequels and re-releases==
=== &quot;International Zodiac Job System&quot; ===
An expanded version of the game, &quot;Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System&quot;, was released in Japan on August 10, 2007. It includes twelve license boards (instead of the original game&#x27;s one), each corresponding to a different Zodiac sign and job. The player can control guest characters and summons, and hold L1 to double the game&#x27;s running speed.

A sequel&quot;, Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings&quot;, was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007. It takes place one year after the events of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; and follows the adventures of Vaan. The game is one of four in the &quot;Ivalice Alliance&quot; series, which also includes &quot;International Zodiac Job System&quot;.

=== &quot;Fortress&quot; ===
&quot;Fortress&quot;, an action game developed by Grin, was to have been a spin-off game that took place following the events of &quot;Revenant Wings&quot;. Square Enix cancelled the project after six months of development.

=== &quot;The Zodiac Age&quot; ===
In July 2017, Square Enix released &quot;Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age&quot;, a high-definition remaster of the Japanese-only &quot;International Zodiac Job System&quot; for the PlayStation 4. It adds trophy support, a remastered soundtrack with a few new tracks, and improved technical performance. &quot;The Zodiac Age&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Remake/Remaster&quot; at &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Best of 2017 Awards, and won &quot;Best Remaster&quot; at &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Best of 2017 Awards and 2017 RPG of the Year Awards. The remaster also received favorable reviews. &quot;The Zodiac Age&quot; was largely developed by Virtuos, who previously developed &quot;Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster&quot; for Square Enix.

A version for Windows was released via Steam on February 1, 2018. The port included support for higher display resolutions and 60 frames-per-second rendering, options to switch between three different versions of the soundtrack, and immediate access to the post-game modes. Versions for the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One were released on April 30, 2019.

== Legacy ==
The gambit system inspired similar systems used in other games such as &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot; and &quot;Pillars of Eternity II&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; also used the gambit system as a base for its &quot;Trust System&quot;, a mechanic that pairs online players with story characters controlled by artificial intelligence. The game also incorporated several regions and characters from &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; into its game world, alongside other games from the Ivalice universe with Yasumi Matsuno as a guest creator. Michael-Christopher Koji Fox, the translation director of &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; indicated in an interview that the team have a lot of people who worked on &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; and &quot;is one of the games they wanted to borrow heavily from because they thought it was really cool, and they really liked the imagery and lore that it had&quot;. &quot;Astria Ascending&quot; used its job system seen in later re-releases as a source of inspiration for its gameplay system. &quot;The Diofield Chronicle&quot; used the game as one source of inspiration for its controls and player movement. The localization of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; was praised as a high point of the series and video games as a whole. Lead localizers Alexander O. Smith and Joseph Reeder went on to collaborate again on &quot;Tactics Ogre: Wheel of Fortune&quot;, the remake of a previous Yasumi Matsuno game, with its localization also receiving high praise. Producers of &quot;The Zodiac Age&quot; said that they were considering another game set in the Ivalice universe, adding that earlier projects faded away due to original development members working on other games.

<doc id="884583" wikidata="Q1294582" url="?curid=884583" title="Roman School">
<text>In music history, the Roman School was a group of composers of predominantly church music, in Rome, during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, polyphonic perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.

== History and characteristics ==

While composers had almost certainly been working in Rome continuously for the thousand years since the time of Gregory the Great, the development of a consistent style around the middle of the 16th century, due in part to the musical requirements of the Counter-Reformation, led to their being grouped together by music historians under this single label.

The music of the Roman School can be seen as the culmination of a development of polyphony through the infusion of music of the Franco-Netherlandish school during the last hundred years. Franco-Netherlandish composers had long been coming to Italy to live and work—Josquin, Obrecht, Arcadelt, and many others made the long journey, and their musical style was decisive on the formation of the Italian styles. Under the guidance of the Vatican, and with the Sistine Chapel Choir being one of the finest of the time, it was perhaps inevitable that the stylistic center of sacred polyphony would turn out to be Rome.

The Council of Trent, which met from 1545 to 1563, had a significant impact on the music of the Roman School: indeed it can be argued that these reforms in the Roman Catholic Church, which were part of the Counter-Reformation, &quot;defined&quot; the music of the Roman School. The Council of Trent recommended that sacred music, especially for use in church, be written in a dignified, serious style. The Council allowed polyphony—a common misconception is that they banned it outright, but this is false—however they did require that text which was sung be clearly understandable. In addition, while they did not ban the use of secular melodies as source material for masses and motets, such use was discouraged.

The combination of the reforms of the Council of Trent with the presence of the extremely talented composers inheriting the Franco-Netherlandish style, was the production of a body of music which has sometimes been held to represent the peak of perfection of Renaissance polyphonic clarity. The subject matter of &quot;16th Century Counterpoint&quot; or &quot;Renaissance Polyphony&quot; as taught in contemporary college music curricula is invariably the codified style of the Roman School, as it was understood by Johann Fux in the early 18th century. It is important to recognize, though, that the &quot;Palestrina style&quot; was not the only polyphonic style of the time, though it may have been the most internally consistent. The polyphonic style of Palestrina may have been the culmination of a hundred years of development of the Franco-Netherlandish style, but it was one of many streams in the late 16th century, and significantly contrasts with the music of the Venetian school to the north, as well as the music being produced in France and England at the same time.

Other composers living and working in Rome, while not considered members of the Roman School, certainly influenced them. The most famous of these is probably Luca Marenzio, whose madrigals were wildly popular in Italy and elsewhere in Europe; some of the composers of the Roman School borrowed his expressive techniques, for instance word painting, for occasional use in a liturgical setting.

While the Roman School is considered to be a conservative musical movement, there are important exceptions. Rome was the birthplace of the oratorio, in the work of Giovanni Francesco Anerio and Emilio de&#x27; Cavalieri; the score for Cavalieri&#x27;s &quot;Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo&quot; is the earliest printed score which uses a figured bass. The style is similar to the style of monody being developed in Florence at approximately the same time; indeed there was considerable competition between composers in those two musical centers. The success of &quot;Rappresentatione&quot; was such that the monodic style became common in much Roman music in the first several decades of the 17th century.

Later composers of the Roman School included Gregorio Allegri, composer of the famous Miserere (c.1630). This piece was guarded closely by the papal chapel; it was considered so beautiful that copies were not allowed to circulate. A favorite story involves the 14-year-old Mozart, who made the first illegal copy by transcribing it from memory after hearing it only twice. Many of the later composers of the Roman School continued to write in the polyphonic style of the 16th century, known then as the &quot;stile antico&quot;, or the &quot;prima pratica&quot;, in distinction to the newer styles of monody and concertato writing which defined the beginning of the Baroque era.

<doc id="884589" wikidata="Q909609" url="?curid=884589" title="Attachment theory">
<text>Attachment theory is a psychological and evolutionary framework, concerning the relationships between humans, particularly the importance of early bonds between infants and their primary caregivers. Developed by psychiatrist and psychoanalyst John Bowlby (1907–90), the theory posits that infants need to form a close relationship with at least one primary caregiver to ensure their survival, and to develop healthy social and emotional functioning.

Pivotal aspects of attachment theory include the observation that infants seek proximity to attachment figures, especially during stressful situations. Secure attachments are formed when caregivers are sensitive and responsive in social interactions, and consistently present, particularly between the ages of six months and two years. As children grow, they use these attachment figures as a secure base from which to explore the world and return to for comfort. The interactions with caregivers form patterns of attachment, which in turn create internal working models that influence future relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bretherton/Mul&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Separation anxiety or grief following the loss of an attachment figure is considered to be a normal and adaptive response for an attached infant.

Research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 70s expanded on Bowlby&#x27;s work, introducing the concept of the &quot;secure base&quot;, impact of maternal responsiveness and sensitivity to infant distress, and identified attachment patterns in infants: secure, avoidant, anxious, and disorganized attachment. In the 1980s, attachment theory was extended to adult relationships and attachment in adults, making it applicable beyond early childhood. Bowlby&#x27;s theory integrated concepts from evolutionary biology, object relations theory, control systems theory, ethology, and cognitive psychology, and was fully articulated in his trilogy, &quot;Attachment and Loss&quot; (1969–82).

While initially criticized by academic psychologists and psychoanalysts, attachment theory has become a dominant approach to understanding early social development and has generated extensive research. Despite some criticisms related to temperament, social complexity, and the limitations of discrete attachment patterns, the theory&#x27;s core concepts have been widely accepted and have influenced therapeutic practices and social and childcare policies.

==Attachment==
Within attachment theory, &quot;attachment&quot; means an affectional bond or tie between an individual and an attachment figure (usually a caregiver/guardian). Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver, these bonds are based on the child&#x27;s need for safety, security, and protection—which is most important in infancy and childhood. Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate that bonds exist. In child-to-adult relationships, the child&#x27;s tie is called the &quot;attachment&quot; and the caregiver&#x27;s reciprocal equivalent is referred to as the &quot;care-giving bond&quot;. The theory proposes that children attach to carers instinctively, for the purpose of survival and, ultimately, genetic replication. The biological aim is survival and the psychological aim is security. The relationship that a child has with their attachment figure is especially important in threatening situations. Having access to a secure figure decreases fear in children when they are presented with threatening situations. Not only is having a decreased level of fear important for general mental stability, but it also implicates how children might react to threatening situations. The presence of a supportive attachment figure is especially important in a child&#x27;s developmental years. In addition to support, attunement (accurate understanding and emotional connection) is crucial in a caregiver-child relationship. If the caregiver is poorly attuned to the child, the child may grow to feel misunderstood and anxious.

Infants form attachments to &quot;any&quot; consistent caregiver who is sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. The quality of social engagement is more influential than the amount of time spent. The biological mother is the usual principal attachment figure, but the role can be assumed by anyone who consistently behaves in a &quot;mothering&quot; way over a period of time. Within attachment theory, this means a set of behaviours that involves engaging in lively social interaction with the infant and responding readily to signals and approaches. Nothing in the theory suggests that fathers are not equally likely to become principal attachment figures if they provide most of the child care and related social interaction. A secure attachment to a father who is a &quot;secondary attachment figure&quot; may also counter the possible negative effects of an unsatisfactory attachment to a mother who is the primary attachment figure.

Some infants direct attachment behaviour (proximity seeking) towards more than one attachment figure almost as soon as they start to show discrimination between caregivers; most come to do so during their second year. These figures are arranged hierarchically, with the principal attachment figure at the top. The set-goal of the attachment behavioural system is to maintain a bond with an accessible and available attachment figure. &quot;Alarm&quot; is the term used for activation of the attachment behavioural system caused by fear of danger. &quot;Anxiety&quot; is the anticipation or fear of being cut off from the attachment figure. If the figure is unavailable or unresponsive, separation distress occurs. In infants, physical separation can cause anxiety and anger, followed by sadness and despair. By age three or four, physical separation is no longer such a threat to the child&#x27;s bond with the attachment figure. Threats to security in older children and adults arise from prolonged absence, breakdowns in communication, emotional unavailability or signs of rejection or abandonment.

===Behaviours===
The attachment behavioural system serves to achieve or maintain proximity to the attachment figure.

Pre-attachment behaviours occur in the first six months of life. During the first phase (the first two months), infants smile, babble, and cry to attract the attention of potential caregivers. Although infants of this age learn to discriminate between caregivers, these behaviours are directed at anyone in the vicinity.

During the second phase (two to six months), the infant discriminates between familiar and unfamiliar adults, becoming more responsive toward the caregiver; following and clinging are added to the range of behaviours. The infant&#x27;s behaviour toward the caregiver becomes organized on a goal-directed basis to achieve the conditions that make it feel secure.

By the end of the first year, the infant is able to display a range of attachment behaviours designed to maintain proximity. These manifest as protesting the caregiver&#x27;s departure, greeting the caregiver&#x27;s return, clinging when frightened, and following when able.

With the development of locomotion, the infant begins to use the caregiver or caregivers as a &quot;safe base&quot; from which to explore. Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present because the infant&#x27;s attachment system is relaxed and it is free to explore. If the caregiver is inaccessible or unresponsive, attachment behaviour is more strongly exhibited. Anxiety, fear, illness, and fatigue will cause a child to increase attachment behaviours.

After the second year, as the child begins to see the caregiver as an independent person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed. Children begin to notice others&#x27; goals and feelings and plan their actions accordingly.

===Tenets===
Modern attachment theory is based on three principles: 
# Bonding is an intrinsic human need. 
# Regulation of emotion and fear to enhance vitality.
# Promoting adaptiveness and growth. 
Common attachment behaviours and emotions, displayed in most social primates including humans, are adaptive. The long-term evolution of these species has involved selection for social behaviours that make individual or group survival more likely. The commonly observed attachment behaviour of toddlers staying near familiar people would have had safety advantages in the environment of early adaptation and has similar advantages today. Bowlby saw the environment of early adaptation as similar to current hunter-gatherer societies. There is a survival advantage in the capacity to sense possibly dangerous conditions such as unfamiliarity, being alone, or rapid approach. According to Bowlby, proximity-seeking to the attachment figure in the face of threat is the &quot;set-goal&quot; of the attachment behavioural system.

Bowlby&#x27;s original account of a sensitivity period during which attachments can form of between six months and two to three years has been modified by later researchers. These researchers have shown there is indeed a sensitive period during which attachments will form if possible, but the time frame is broader and the effect less fixed and irreversible than first proposed.

With further research, authors discussing attachment theory have come to appreciate social development is affected by later as well as earlier relationships. Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver, or the occasional care of a small number of other people. According to Bowlby, almost from the beginning, many children have more than one figure toward whom they direct attachment behaviour. These figures are not treated alike; there is a strong bias for a child to direct attachment behaviour mainly toward one particular person. Bowlby used the term &quot;monotropy&quot; to describe this bias. Researchers and theorists have abandoned this concept insofar as it may be taken to mean the relationship with the special figure differs &quot;qualitatively&quot; from that of other figures. Rather, current thinking postulates definite hierarchies of relationships.

Early experiences with caregivers gradually give rise to a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviours about the self and others. This system, called the &quot;internal working model of social relationships&quot;, continues to develop with time and experience.

Internal models regulate, interpret, and predict attachment-related behaviour in the self and the attachment figure. As they develop in line with environmental and developmental changes, they incorporate the capacity to reflect and communicate about past and future attachment relationships. They enable the child to handle new types of social interactions; knowing, for example, an infant should be treated differently from an older child, or that interactions with teachers and parents share characteristics. Even interaction with coaches share similar characteristics, as athletes who secure attachment relationships with not only their parents but their coaches will play a role in the growth of athletes in their prospective sport. This internal working model continues to develop through adulthood, helping cope with friendships, marriage, and parenthood, all of which involve different behaviours and feelings.

The development of attachment is a transactional process. Specific attachment behaviours begin with predictable, apparently innate, behaviours in infancy. They change with age in ways determined partly by experiences and partly by situational factors. As attachment behaviours change with age, they do so in ways shaped by relationships. A child&#x27;s behaviour when reunited with a caregiver is determined not only by how the caregiver has treated the child before, but on the history of effects the child has had on the caregiver.

=== Cultural differences ===
In Western culture child-rearing, there is a focus on single attachment to primarily the mother. This dyadic model is not the only strategy of attachment producing a secure and emotionally adept child. Having a single, dependably responsive and sensitive caregiver (namely the mother) does not guarantee the ultimate success of the child. Results from Israeli, Dutch and east African studies show children with multiple caregivers grow up not only feeling secure, but developed &quot;more enhanced capacities to view the world from multiple perspectives.&quot; This evidence can be more readily found in hunter-gatherer communities, like those that exist in rural Tanzania.

In hunter-gatherer communities, in the past and present, mothers are the primary caregivers, but share the maternal responsibility of ensuring the child&#x27;s survival with a variety of different allomothers. So while the mother is important, she is not the only opportunity for relational attachment a child can make. Several group members (with or without blood relation) contribute to the task of bringing up a child, sharing the parenting role and therefore can be sources of multiple attachment. There is evidence of this communal parenting throughout history that &quot;would have significant implications for the evolution of multiple attachment.&quot;

In &quot;non-metropolis&quot; India , where a family normally consists of 3 generations (and sometimes 4: great-grandparents, grandparents, parents, and child or children), the child or children would have four to six caregivers from whom to select their &quot;attachment figure&quot;. A child&#x27;s &quot;uncles and aunts&quot; (parents&#x27; siblings and their spouses) also contribute to the child&#x27;s psycho-social enrichment.

Although it has been debated for years, and there are differences across cultures, research has shown that the three basic aspects of attachment theory are, to some degree, universal. Studies in Israel and Japan resulted in findings which diverge from a number of studies completed in Western Europe and the United States. The prevailing hypotheses are: 1) that secure attachment is the most desirable state, and the most prevalent; 2) maternal sensitivity influences infant attachment patterns; and 3) specific infant attachments predict later social and cognitive competence.

==Attachment patterns==


===Secure attachment===
A toddler who is securely attached to his or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child&#x27;s temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child&#x27;s attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver&#x27;s sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child&#x27;s needs will create securely attached children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.

In the traditional Ainsworth et al. (1978) coding of the Strange Situation, secure infants are denoted as &quot;Group B&quot; infants and they are further subclassified as B1, B2, B3, and B4. Although these subgroupings refer to different stylistic responses to the comings and goings of the caregiver, they were not given specific labels by Ainsworth and colleagues, although their descriptive behaviours led others (including students of Ainsworth) to devise a relatively &quot;loose&quot; terminology for these subgroups. B1&#x27;s have been referred to as &quot;secure-reserved&quot;, B2&#x27;s as &quot;secure-inhibited&quot;, B3&#x27;s as &quot;secure-balanced&quot;, and B4&#x27;s as &quot;secure-reactive&quot;. However, in academic publications the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply &quot;B1&quot; or &quot;B2&quot;, although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology. Secure attachment is the most common type of attachment relationship seen throughout societies.

Securely attached children are best able to explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent&#x27;s assistance is helpful, educates the child on how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.

===Anxious-ambivalent attachment===
Anxious-ambivalent attachment is a form of insecure attachment and is also misnamed as &quot;resistant attachment&quot;. In general, a child with an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed showing behaviours such as crying or screaming. The child is generally ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant, C1) or helplessness (ambivalent passive, C2) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.

The C1 (ambivalent resistant) subtype is coded when &quot;resistant behavior is particularly conspicuous. The mixture of seeking and yet resisting contact and interaction has an unmistakably angry quality and indeed an angry tone may characterize behavior in the preseparation episodes&quot;.

Regarding the C2 (ambivalent passive) subtype, Ainsworth et al. wrote:

Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999) found that children with abusive childhood experiences were more likely to develop ambivalent attachments. The study also found that children with ambivalent attachments were more likely to experience difficulties in maintaining intimate relationships as adults.

===Dismissive-avoidant attachment===

An infant with a dismissive-avoidant pattern of attachment will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as dismissive-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.

Infants are depicted as dismissive-avoidant when there is:

Ainsworth&#x27;s narrative records showed that infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure when they had a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The infant&#x27;s needs were frequently not met and the infant had come to believe that communication of emotional needs had no influence on the caregiver.

Ainsworth&#x27;s student Mary Main theorized that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situation Procedure should be regarded as &quot;a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection&quot; by de-emphasising attachment needs.

Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organizing avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver—avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion (&quot;disorganized distress&quot;), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.

===Disorganized/disoriented attachment===
Beginning in 1983, Crittenden offered A/C and other new organized classifications (see below). Drawing on records of behaviours discrepant with the A, B and C classifications, a fourth classification was added by Ainsworth&#x27;s colleague Mary Main. In the Strange Situation, the attachment system is expected to be activated by the departure and return of the caregiver. If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered &#x27;disorganized&#x27; as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganized/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. Lyons-Ruth has urged, however, that it should be more widely &quot;recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior&quot;.

The benefit of this category was hinted at earlier in Ainsworth&#x27;s own experience finding difficulties in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth&#x27;s students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behaviour was &quot;without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behavior, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress&quot;.

There is rapidly growing interest in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers. However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new &#x27;D&#x27; classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as &quot;open-ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished&quot;, as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated as if they were the same thing. Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a &#x27;strategy of desperation&#x27; and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger).

Crittenden also argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more &#x27;emergency&#x27; versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that &quot;even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent&quot;. However, &quot;the presumption that many indices of &#x27;disorganization&#x27; are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children&#x27;s capacity for response.&quot; For example, &quot;Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person.&quot;

Main and Hesse found most of the mothers of these children had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, fifty-six per cent of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, while emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.

=== Categorization differences across cultures ===
Across different cultures deviations from the Strange Situation Protocol have been observed. A Japanese study in 1986 (Takahashi) studied 60 Japanese mother-infant pairs and compared them with Ainsworth&#x27;s distributional pattern. Although the ranges for securely attached and insecurely attached had no significant differences in proportions, the Japanese insecure group consisted of only resistant children, with no children categorized as avoidant. This may be because the Japanese child rearing philosophy stressed close mother infant bonds more so than in Western cultures. In Northern Germany, Grossmann et al. (Grossmann, Huber, &amp; Wartner, 1981; Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, &amp; Unzner, 1985) replicated the Ainsworth Strange Situation with 46 mother infant pairs and found a different distribution of attachment classifications with a high number of avoidant infants: 52% avoidant, 34% secure, and 13% resistant (Grossmann et al., 1985). Another study in Israel found there was a high frequency of an ambivalent pattern, which according to Grossman et al. (1985) could be attributed to a greater parental push toward children&#x27;s independence.

=== Later patterns and the dynamic-maturational model ===
Techniques have been developed to guide a child to verbalize their state of mind with respect to attachment. One such is the &quot;stem story&quot;, in which a child receives the beginning of a story that raises attachment issues and is asked to complete it. This is modified for older children, adolescents and adults, where semi-structured interviews are used instead, and the way content is delivered may be as significant as the content itself. However, there are no substantially validated measures of attachment for middle childhood or early adolescence (from 7 to 13 years of age).

Some studies of older children have identified further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behaviour in infancy can develop into a child using caregiver-controlling or punitive behaviour to manage a helpless or dangerously unpredictable caregiver. In these cases, the child&#x27;s behaviour is organized, but the behaviour is treated by researchers as a form of disorganization, since the hierarchy in the family no longer follows parenting authority in that scenario.

American psychologist Patricia McKinsey Crittenden has elaborated classifications of further forms of avoidant and ambivalent attachment behaviour, as seen in her dynamic-maturational model of attachment and adaptation (DMM). These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3, respectively), but also other patterns such as compulsive compliance with the wishes of a threatening parent (A4).

Crittenden&#x27;s ideas developed from Bowlby&#x27;s proposal: &quot;Given certain adverse circumstances during childhood, the selective exclusion of information of certain sorts may be adaptive. Yet, when during adolescence and adulthood the situation changes, the persistent exclusion of the same forms of information may become maladaptive&quot;.

Crittenden theorizes the human experience of danger comprise two basic components:

# Emotions provoked by the potential for danger, which Crittenden refers to as &quot;affective information.&quot; In childhood, the unexplained absence of an attachment figure would cause these emotions. A strategy an infant faced with insensitive or rejecting parenting may use to maintain availability of the attachment figure is to repress emotional information that could result in rejection by said attachment figure.
# Causal or other sequentially ordered knowledge about the potential for safety or danger, which would include awareness of behaviours that indicate whether an attachment figure is available as a secure haven. If the infant represses knowledge that the caregiver is not a reliable source of protection and safety, they may use clingy and/or aggressive behaviour to demand attention and potentially increase the availability of an attachment figure who otherwise displays inconsistent or misleading responses to the infant&#x27;s attachment behaviours.

Crittenden proposes both kinds of information can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a &#x27;strategy&#x27; to maintain the availability of an attachment figure (see disorganized/disoriented attachment for type distinctions). Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened, and Type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. In contrast, Type B strategies use both kinds of information without much distortion. For example, a toddler may have come to depend upon a Type C strategy of tantrums to maintain an unreliable attachment figure&#x27;s availability, which may cause the attachment figure to respond appropriately to the child&#x27;s attachment behaviours. As a result of learning the attachment figure is becoming more reliable, the toddler&#x27;s reliance on coercive behaviours is reduced, and a more secure attachment may develop.

===Significance of patterns===
Research based on data from longitudinal studies, such as the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and the Minnesota Study of Risk and Adaption from Birth to Adulthood, and from cross-sectional studies, consistently shows associations between early attachment classifications and peer relationships as to both quantity and quality. Lyons-Ruth, for example, found that &quot;for each additional withdrawing behavior displayed by mothers in relation to their infant&#x27;s attachment cues in the Strange Situation Procedure, the likelihood of clinical referral by service providers was increased by 50%.&quot;

There is an extensive body of research demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children&#x27;s functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, but it is a liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children&#x27;s peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.

Studies have suggested that infants with a high-risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may express attachment security differently from infants with a low-risk for ASD. Behavioural problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting and the degree of risk in the family environment.

Some authors have questioned the idea that a of categories representing a qualitative difference in attachment relationships can be developed. Examination of data from 1,139 15-month-olds showed that variation in attachment patterns was continuous rather than grouped. This criticism introduces important questions for attachment typologies and the mechanisms behind apparent types. However, it has relatively little relevance for attachment theory itself, which &quot;neither requires nor predicts discrete patterns of attachment.&quot;

There is some evidence that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. There has been a common tendency observed by researchers that males demonstrate a greater tendency to engage in criminal behaviour which is suspected to be related to males being more likely to experience inadequate early attachments to primary caregivers. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.

==Changes in attachment during childhood and adolescence==
Childhood and adolescence allows the development of an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual&#x27;s state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual&#x27;s state of mind alone in forming new attachments.

Age, cognitive growth, and continued social experience advance the development and complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining. For example, four-year-olds are not distressed by separation if they and their caregiver have already negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.

Ideally, these social skills become incorporated into the internal working model to be used with other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual coregulation of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.

The attachment system used by adolescents is seen as a &quot;safety regulating system&quot; whose main function is to promote physical and psychological safety. There are 2 different events that can trigger the attachment system. Those triggers include, the presence of a potential danger or stress, internal and external, and a threat of accessibility and/or availability of an attachment figure. The ultimate goal of the attachment system is security, so during a time of danger or inaccessibility the behavioural system accepts felt security in the context of the availability of protection. By adolescence we are able to find security through a variety of things, such as food, exercise, and social media. Felt security can be achieved through a number of ways, and often without the physical presence of the attachment figure. Higher levels of maturity allows adolescent teens to more capably interact with their environment on their own because the environment is perceived as less threatening. Adolescents teens will also see an increase in cognitive, emotional and behavioural maturity that dictates whether or not teens are less likely to experience conditions that activate their need for an attachment figure. For example, when teenagers get sick and stay home from school, surely they want their parents to be home so they can take care of them, but they are also able to stay home by themselves without experiencing serious amounts of distress. Additionally, the social environment that a school fosters impacts adolescents attachment behaviour, even if these same adolescents have not had issues with attachment behaviour previously. High schools that have a permissive environment compared to an authoritative environment promote positive attachment behaviour. For example, when students feel connected to their teachers and peers because of their permissive schooling environment, they are less likely to skip school. Positive-attachment behaviour in high schools have important implications on how a school&#x27;s environment should be structured.

Here are the attachment style differences during adolescence:

* Secure adolescents are expected to hold their mothers at a higher rate than all other support figures, including father, significant others, and best friends.
* Insecure adolescents identify more strongly with their peers than their parents as their primary attachment figures. Their friends are seen as a significantly strong source of attachment support.
* Dismissing adolescents rate their parents as a less significant source of attachment support and would consider themselves as their primary attachment figure.
* Preoccupied adolescents would rate their parents as their primary source of attachment support and would consider themselves as a much less significant source of attachment support.

==Attachment styles in adults==

Attachment theory was extended to adult romantic relationships in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles of attachment have been identified in adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.

=== Securely attached ===

Securely attached adults have been &quot;linked to a high need for achievement and a low fear of failure (Elliot &amp; Reis, 2003)&quot;. They will positively approach a task with the goal of mastering it and have an appetite for exploration in achievement settings (Elliot &amp; Reis, 2003). Research shows that securely attached adults have a &quot;low level of personal distress and high levels of concern for others&quot;. Due to their high rates of self-efficacy, securely attached adults typically do not hesitate to remove a person having a negative impact from problematic situations they are facing. This calm response is representative of the securely attached adult&#x27;s emotionally regulated response to threats that many studies have supported in the face of diverse situations. Adult secure attachment comes from an individual&#x27;s early connection with their caregiver(s), genes and their romantic experiences.

Within romantic relationships, a securely attached adult will appear in the following ways: excellent conflict resolution, mentally flexible, effective communicators, avoidance of manipulation, comfortable with closeness without fearfulness of being enmeshed, quickly forgiving, viewing sex and emotional intimacy as one, believing they can positively impact their relationship, and caring for their partner in the way they want to be cared for. In summation, they are great partners who treat their partners very well, as they are not afraid to give positively and ask for their needs to be met. Securely attached adults believe that there are &quot;many potential partners that would be responsive to their needs&quot;, and if they come across an individual who is not meeting their needs, they will typically lose interest quickly.

=== Anxious-preoccupied ===
Anxious preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They tend to be less trusting, have less positive views about themselves than their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. The anxiety that adults feel prevents the establishment of satisfactory defence exclusion. Thus, it is possible that individuals that have been anxiously attached to their attachment figure or figures have not been able to develop sufficient defences against separation anxiety. Because of their lack of preparation these individuals will then overreact to the anticipation of separation or the actual separation from their attachment figure. The anxiety comes from an individual&#x27;s intense and/or unstable relationship that leaves the anxious or preoccupied individual relatively defenceless.

In terms of adult relationships, if an adult experiences this inconsistent behaviour from their romantic partner or acquaintance, they might develop some of the aspects of this attachment type. Besides, insecurity and distress about relationships can be driven by individuals who exhibit inconsistent connection or emotionally abusive behaviours. However, a secure relationship can also reduce anxious behaviour and be a resource for safety and support.

=== Dismissive-avoidant ===

Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with conflict by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Adults lack the interest of forming close relationships and maintaining emotional closeness with the people around them. They have a great amount of distrust in others, but at the same time possess a positive model of self; they would prefer to invest in their own ego skills. They try to create high levels of self-esteem by investing disproportionately in their abilities or accomplishments. These adults maintain their positive views of self, based on their personal achievements and competence rather than searching for and feeling acceptance from others. These adults will explicitly reject or minimize the importance of emotional attachment and passively avoid relationships when they feel as though they are becoming too close. They strive for self-reliance and independence. When it comes to the opinions of others about themselves, they are very indifferent and are relatively hesitant to internalize positive feedback from their peers. Dismissive avoidance is considered to be the result of defensive deactivation and disconnection to avoid potential rejection, and is in some cases amplified by a genuine disinterest in social connection.

Adults with dismissive-avoidant patterns are less likely to seek social support than other attachment styles. They are likely to fear intimacy and lack confidence in others. Because of their distrust they cannot be convinced that other people have the ability to deliver emotional support. Under a high cognitive load, however, dismissive-avoidant adults appear to have a lowered ability to suppress difficult attachment-related emotions, as well difficulty maintaining positive self-representations. This suggests that hidden vulnerabilities may underlie an active denial process.

=== Fearful-avoidant ===

Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. The dangerous part about the contrast between wanting to form social relationships while simultaneously fearing the relationship is that it creates mental instability. This mental instability then translates into mistrusting the relationships they do form and also viewing themselves as unworthy. Furthermore, fearful-avoidant adults also have a less pleasant outlook on life compared to anxious-preoccupied and dismissive avoidant groups. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.

According to research studies, an individual with a fearful avoidant attachment might have had childhood trauma or persistently negative perceptions and actions from their family members. Apart from these, genetic factors and personality may also have an impact on how an individual behaves with parents as well as how they understand their relationships in their adulthood.

=== Assessing and measuring attachment ===

Two main aspects of adult attachment have been studied. The organization and stability of the mental working models that underlie the attachment styles is explored by social psychologists interested in romantic attachment. Developmental psychologists interested in the individual&#x27;s state of mind with respect to attachment generally explore how attachment functions in relationship dynamics and impacts relationship outcomes. The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual&#x27;s state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested that adults do not hold a single set of working models. Instead, on one level they have a set of rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general. On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.

There are a number of different measures of adult attachment, the most common being self-report questionnaires and coded interviews based on the Adult Attachment Interview. The various measures were developed primarily as research tools, for different purposes and addressing different domains, for example romantic relationships, platonic relationships, parental relationships or peer relationships. Some classify an adult&#x27;s state of mind with respect to attachment and attachment patterns by reference to childhood experiences, while others assess relationship behaviours and security regarding parents and peers.

=== Associations of adult attachment with other traits ===

Adult attachment styles are related to individual differences in the ways in which adults experience and manage their emotions. Recent meta-analyses link insecure attachment styles to lower emotional intelligence and lower trait mindfulness.

==History==
===Maternal deprivation===
The early thinking of the object relations school of psychoanalysis, particularly Melanie Klein, influenced Bowlby. However, he profoundly disagreed with the prevalent psychoanalytic belief that infants&#x27; responses relate to their internal fantasy life rather than real-life events. As Bowlby formulated his concepts, he was influenced by case studies on disturbed and delinquent children, such as those of William Goldfarb published in 1943 and 1945.

Bowlby&#x27;s contemporary René Spitz observed separated children&#x27;s grief, proposing that &quot;psychotoxic&quot; results were brought about by inappropriate experiences of early care. A strong influence was the work of social worker and psychoanalyst James Robertson who filmed the effects of separation on children in hospital. He and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film &quot;A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital&quot; which was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visits by parents.

In his 1951 monograph for the World Health Organization, &quot;Maternal Care and Mental Health&quot;, Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that &quot;the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment&quot;, the lack of which may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This was also published as &quot;Child Care and the Growth of Love&quot; for public consumption. The central proposition was influential but highly controversial. At the time there was limited empirical data and no comprehensive theory to account for such a conclusion. Nevertheless, Bowlby&#x27;s theory sparked considerable interest in the nature of early relationships, giving a strong impetus to, (in the words of Mary Ainsworth), a &quot;great body of research&quot; in an extremely difficult, complex area.

Bowlby&#x27;s work (and Robertson&#x27;s films) caused a virtual revolution in a hospital visiting by parents, hospital provision for children&#x27;s play, educational and social needs, and the use of residential nurseries. Over time, orphanages were abandoned in favour of foster care or family-style homes in most developed countries.

Bowlby&#x27;s work about parental provisions after child birth implicates that maternal deprivation negatively influences the attachment behaviour trajectory of a child&#x27;s life. If a mother experiences post-partum anxiety, stress, or depression, the attachment they have with their child can be disrupted. It is important for pregnant women to have mental-health support pre and post-partum because mental illness often results in low feelings of attachment to their infant.

===Formulation of the theory===
Following the publication of &quot;Maternal Care and Mental Health&quot;, Bowlby sought new understanding from the fields of evolutionary biology, ethology, developmental psychology, cognitive science and control systems theory. He formulated the innovative proposition that mechanisms underlying an infant&#x27;s emotional tie to the caregiver(s) emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure. He set out to develop a theory of motivation and behaviour control built on science rather than Freud&#x27;s psychic energy model. Bowlby argued that with attachment theory he had made good the &quot;deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect&quot; of &quot;Maternal Care and Mental Health&quot;.

====Ethology====
Bowlby&#x27;s attention was drawn to ethology in the early 1950s when he read Konrad Lorenz&#x27;s work. Other important influences were ethologists Nikolaas Tinbergen and Robert Hinde. Bowlby subsequently collaborated with Hinde. In 1953 Bowlby stated &quot;the time is ripe for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests.&quot; Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of &quot;imprinting&quot;, a behaviour characteristic of some birds and mammals which involves rapid learning of recognition by the young, of a or comparable object. After recognition comes a tendency to follow.
Certain types of learning are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range known as a critical period. Bowlby&#x27;s concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.

Ethologists expressed concern about the adequacy of some research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalization to humans from animal studies. Schur, discussing Bowlby&#x27;s use of ethological concepts (pre-1960) commented that concepts used in attachment theory had not kept up with changes in ethology itself. Ethologists and others writing in the 1960s and 1970s questioned and expanded the types of behaviour used as indications of attachment. Observational studies of young children in natural settings provided other behaviours that might indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort on her part and picking up small objects, bringing them to the mother but not to others. Although ethologists tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, they pressed for more data, objecting to psychologists writing as if there were an &quot;entity which is &#x27;attachment&#x27;, existing over and above the observable measures.&quot; Robert Hinde considered &quot;attachment behaviour system&quot; to be an appropriate term which did not offer the same problems &quot;because it refers to postulated control systems that determine the relations between different kinds of behaviour.&quot;

====Psychoanalysis====
Psychoanalytic concepts influenced Bowlby&#x27;s view of attachment, in particular, the observations by Anna Freud and Dorothy Burlingham of young children separated from familiar caregivers during World War II. However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds including &quot;drive theory&quot; in which the motivation for attachment derives from gratification of hunger and libidinal drives. He called this the &quot;cupboard-love&quot; theory of relationships. In his view it failed to see attachment as a psychological bond in its own right rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality. Based on ideas of primary attachment and Neo-Darwinism, Bowlby identified what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis: the overemphasis of internal dangers rather than external threat, and the view of the development of personality via linear &quot;phases&quot; with &quot;regression&quot; to fixed points accounting for psychological distress. Bowlby instead posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.

From early in the development of attachment theory there was criticism of the theory&#x27;s lack of congruence with various branches of psychoanalysis. Bowlby&#x27;s decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on similar problems.

====Internal working model====
The philosopher Kenneth Craik had noted the ability of thought to predict events. He stressed the survival value of natural selection for this ability. A key component of attachment theory is the attachment behaviour system where certain behaviours have a predictable outcome (i.e. proximity) and serve as self-preservation method (i.e. protection). All taking place outside of an individual&#x27;s awareness, This internal working model allows a person to try out alternatives mentally, using knowledge of the past while responding to the present and future. Bowlby applied Craik&#x27;s ideas to attachment, when other psychologists were applying these concepts to adult perception and cognition.

Infants absorb all sorts of complex social-emotional information from the social interactions that they observe. They notice the helpful and hindering behaviours of one person to another. From these observations they develop expectations of how two characters should behave, known as a &quot;secure base script.&quot; These scripts provide as a template of how attachment related events should unfold and they are the building blocks of ones internal working models. An infant&#x27;s internal working model is developed in response to the infant&#x27;s experience based internal working models of self, and environment, with emphasis on the caregiving environment and the outcomes of his or her proximity-seeking behaviours. Theoretically, secure child and adult script, would allow for an attachment situation where one person successfully utilizes another as a secure base from which to explore and as a safe haven in times of distress. In contrast, insecure individuals would create attachment situations with more complications. For example, If the caregiver is accepting of these proximity-seeking behaviours and grants access, the infant develops a secure organization; if the caregiver consistently denies the infant access, an avoidant organization develops; and if the caregiver inconsistently grants access, an ambivalent organization develops. In retrospect, internal working models are constant with and reflect the primary relationship with our caregivers. Childhood attachment directly influences our adult relationships.

A parent&#x27;s internal working model that is operative in the attachment relationship with her infant can be accessed by examining the parent&#x27;s mental representations. Recent research has demonstrated that the quality of maternal attributions as markers of maternal mental representations can be associated with particular forms of maternal psychopathology and can be altered in a relative short time-period by targeted psychotherapeutic intervention.

====Cybernetics====
The theory of control systems (cybernetics), developing during the 1930s and 1940s, influenced Bowlby&#x27;s thinking. The young child&#x27;s need for proximity to the attachment figure was seen as balancing homeostatically with the need for exploration. (Bowlby compared this process to physiological homeostasis whereby, for example, blood pressure is kept within limits). The actual distance maintained by the child would vary as the balance of needs changed. For example, the approach of a stranger, or an injury, would cause the child exploring at a distance to seek proximity. The child&#x27;s goal is not an object (the caregiver) but a state; maintenance of the desired distance from the caregiver depending on circumstances.

====Cognitive development====
Bowlby&#x27;s reliance on Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development gave rise to questions about object permanence (the ability to remember an object that is temporarily absent) in early attachment behaviours. An infant&#x27;s ability to discriminate strangers and react to the mother&#x27;s absence seemed to occur months earlier than Piaget suggested would be cognitively possible. More recently, it has been noted that the understanding of mental representation has advanced so much since Bowlby&#x27;s day that present views can be more specific than those of Bowlby&#x27;s time.

====Behaviourism====
In 1969, Gerwitz discussed how mother and child could provide each other with positive reinforcement experiences through their mutual attention, thereby learning to stay close together. This explanation would make it unnecessary to posit innate human characteristics fostering attachment. Learning theory, (behaviourism), saw attachment as a remnant of dependency with the quality of attachment being merely a response to the caregiver&#x27;s cues. The main predictors of attachment quality are parents being sensitive and responsive to their children. When parents interact with their infants in a warm and nurturing manner, their attachment quality increases. The way that parents interact with their children at four months is related to attachment behaviour at 12 months, thus it is important for parents&#x27; sensitivity and responsiveness to remain stable. The lack of sensitivity and responsiveness increases the likelihood for attachment disorders to development in children. Behaviourists saw behaviours like crying as a random activity meaning nothing until reinforced by a caregiver&#x27;s response. To behaviourists, frequent responses would result in more crying. To attachment theorists, crying is an inborn attachment behaviour to which the caregiver must respond if the infant is to develop emotional security. Conscientious responses produce security which enhances autonomy and results in less crying. Ainsworth&#x27;s research in Baltimore supported the attachment theorists&#x27; view.

In the last decade, behaviour analysts have constructed models of attachment based on the importance of contingent relationships. These behaviour analytic models have received some support from research and meta-analytic reviews.

====Developments since 1970s====
In the 1970s, problems with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) rather than as a type of behaviour with organizing functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child&#x27;s life. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory&#x27;s logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm. The selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter&#x27;s conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.

The biggest challenge to the notion of the universality of attachment theory came from studies conducted in Japan where the concept of &quot;amae&quot; plays a prominent role in describing family relationships. Arguments revolved around the appropriateness of the use of the Strange Situation procedure where &quot;amae&quot; is practised. Ultimately research tended to confirm the universality hypothesis of attachment theory. Most recently a 2007 study conducted in Sapporo in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main and Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.

Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were generally concerned with the concept of infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory&#x27;s cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan&#x27;s argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver&#x27;s behaviours that form the child&#x27;s attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child&#x27;s temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children&#x27;s development.

Psychoanalyst/psychologists Peter Fonagy and Mary Target have attempted to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship through cognitive science as mentalization. Mentalization, or theory of mind, is the capacity of human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression. It has been speculated that this connection between theory of mind and the internal working model may open new areas of study, leading to alterations in attachment theory. Since the late 1980s, there has been a developing rapprochement between attachment theory and psychoanalysis, based on common ground as elaborated by attachment theorists and researchers, and a change in what psychoanalysts consider to be central to psychoanalysis. Object relations models which emphasise the autonomous need for a relationship have become dominant and are linked to a growing recognition in psychoanalysis of the importance of infant development in the context of relationships and internalized representations. Psychoanalysis has recognized the formative nature of a child&#x27;s early environment including the issue of childhood trauma. A psychoanalytically based exploration of the attachment system and an accompanying clinical approach has emerged together with a recognition of the need for measurement of outcomes of interventions.

One focus of attachment research has been the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called &quot;day care wars&quot; of the late-20th century, during which some authors stressed the deleterious effects of day care. As a result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues, including the need for relationship-building by the assignment of a child to a specific care-giver. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to provide this, more infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than in the past. A natural experiment permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families after the end of the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.

Authors considering attachment in non-Western cultures have noted the connection of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby&#x27;s time. As children&#x27;s experience of care changes, so may attachment-related experiences. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers or being cared for outside the home while the mothers work. This social change has made it more difficult for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries. There has been an increase in the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources in first-world countries. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and gained legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby&#x27;s time. Regardless of whether parents are genetically related, adoptive parents attachment roles they will still influence and affect their child&#x27;s attachment behaviours throughout their lifetime. Issues have been raised to the effect that the model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences, as infants often have multiple relationships within the family and in child care settings. It is suggested these multiple relationships influence one another reciprocally, at least within a family.

Principles of attachment theory have been used to explain adult social behaviours, including mating, social dominance and hierarchical power structures, in-group identification, group coalitions, membership in cults and totalitarian systems and negotiation of reciprocity and justice. Those explanations have been used to design parental care training, and have been particularly successful in the design of child abuse prevention programmes.

While a wide variety of studies have upheld the basic tenets of attachment theory, research has been inconclusive as to whether self-reported early attachment and later depression are demonstrably related.

==Neurobiology of attachment==
In addition to longitudinal studies, there has been psychophysiological research on the neurobiology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute to a range of interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.

The quality of caregiving received at infancy and childhood directly affects an individual&#x27;s neurological systems which controls stress regulation. In psychophysiological research on attachment, the two main areas studied have been autonomic responses, such as heart rate or respiration, and the activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, a system that is responsible for the body&#x27;s reaction to stress. Infants&#x27; physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant temperament and the extent to which attachment acts as a moderator. Recent studies convey that early attachment relationships become molecularly instilled into the being, thus affecting later immune system functioning. Empirical evidence communicates that early negative experiences produce pro inflammatory phenotype cells in the immune system, which is directly related to cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, and certain types of cancer.

Recent improvements involving methods of research have enabled researchers to further investigate the neural correlates of attachment in humans. These advances include identifying key brain structures, neural circuits, neurotransmitter systems, and neuropeptides, and how they are involved in attachment system functioning and can indicate more about a certain individual, even predict their behaviour. There is initial evidence that caregiving and attachment involve both unique and overlapping brain regions. Another issue is the role of inherited genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment.

Studies show that attachment in adulthood is simultaneously related to biomarkers of immunity. For example, individuals with an avoidance attachment style produce higher levels of the pro inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) when reacting to an interpersonal stressor, while individuals representing an anxious attachment style tend to have elevated cortisol production and lower numbers of T cells. Although children vary genetically and each individual requires different attachment relationships, there is consistent evidence that maternal warmth during infancy and childhood creates a safe haven for individuals resulting in superior immune system functioning. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.

== Crime ==
Attachment theory has often been applied in the discipline of criminology. It has been used in an attempt to identify causal mechanisms in criminal behaviour – with uses ranging from offender profiling, better understanding types of offence and the pursuit of preventative policy. It has been found that disturbances early on in child-caregiver relationships are a risk factor in criminality. Attachment theory in this context has been described as &quot;perhaps the most influential of contemporary psychoanalytically oriented theories of crime&quot;.

=== History ===
The origins of attachment theory within criminology can be found in the work of August Aichhorn. In applying psychoanalysis to pedagogy, he argued that abnormal child relationships are the underlying problem causing delinquency.

The intersection of crime and attachment theory was further researched by John Bowlby. In his first published work, &quot;Forty-four Juvenile Thieves&quot;, he studied a sample of 88 children (44 juvenile thieves and 44 non-delinquent controls) and determined that child-mother separation caused delinquent character formation, particularly in the development of an &quot;affectionless character&quot; often seen in the persistent offender. 17 of the juvenile thieves had been separated from their mothers for longer than six months during their first five years, and only 2 children from the control group had such a separation. He also found that 14 of the thieves were &quot;affectionless characters&quot; distinguishing them from others by their lack of affection, no emotional ties, no real friendships, and having &quot;no roots in their relationships&quot;.

=== Age distribution of crime ===
Two theories about why the crime peaks around the late teenage years and early twenties are called the developmental theory and life-course theory, and both involve attachment theory. Developmental perspectives argue that individuals who have disrupted childhood attachments will have criminal careers that continue long into adulthood. Life course perspectives argue that relationships at every stage of the life course can influence an individual&#x27;s likelihood of committing crimes.

=== Types of offences ===
Disrupted attachment patterns from childhood have been identified as a risk factor for domestic violence. These disruptions in childhood can prevent the formation of a secure attachment relationship, and in turn adversely affecting a healthy way to deal with stress. In adulthood, lack of coping mechanisms can result in violent behaviour. Bowlby&#x27;s theory of functional anger states that children signal to their caregiver that their attachment needs are not being met by use of angry behaviour. This perception of low support from partner has been identified as a strong predictor of male violence. Other predictors have been named as perceived deficiency in maternal love in childhood, low self-esteem. It has also been found that individuals with a dismissive attachment style, often seen in an antisocial/narcissistic-narcissistic subtype of offender, tend to be emotionally abusive as well as violent. Individuals in the borderline/emotionally dependent subtype have traits which originate from insecure attachment in childhood, and tend to have high levels of anger.

It has been found that sexual offenders have significantly less secure maternal and paternal attachments compared with non-offenders which suggests that insecure attachments in infancy persist into adulthood. In a recent study, 57% of sexual offenders were found to be of a preoccupied attachment style. There is also evidence that suggests subtypes of sexual crime can have different attachment styles. Dismissive individuals tend to be hostile towards others, and are more likely to offend violently against adult women. By contrast, child abusers are more likely to have preoccupied attachment styles as the tendency to seek approval from others becomes distorted and attachment relationships become sexualized.

=== Uses within probation practice ===
Attachment theory has been of special interest within probation settings. When put into practice, probation officers aim to learn their probationer&#x27;s attachment history because it can give them insight into how the probationer will respond to different scenarios and when they are the most vulnerable to reoffend. One of the primary strategies of implementation is to set up the probation officer as a secure base. This secure base relationship is formed by the probation officer being reliable, safe, and in tune with the probationer, and is intended to help give them a partly representational secure relationship that they have not been able to form.

==Practical applications==
As a theory of socioemotional development, attachment theory has implications and practical applications in social policy, decisions about the care and welfare of children and mental health.

===Child care policies===
Social policies concerning the care of children were the driving force in Bowlby&#x27;s development of attachment theory. The difficulty lies in applying attachment concepts to policy and practice. In 2008 C.H. Zeanah and colleagues stated, &quot;Supporting early child-parent relationships is an increasingly prominent goal of mental health practitioners, community-based service providers and policy makers ... Attachment theory and research have generated important findings concerning early child development and spurred the creation of programs to support early child-parent relationships.&quot; Additionally, practitioners can use the concepts of attachment theory that suggests deep relationships which builds attachment security towards mental health interventions. Attachment security has been found to strengthen one&#x27;s ability to cope with stress, anxiety, and maintain that, in turn, can contribute to the person&#x27;s well-being and mental health For example, previous studies have demonstrated that individuals who demonstrate avoidance attachment styles experiences less stress and distress when presented with ostracism. However, finding quality childcare while at work or school is an issue for many families. NIHD recent study convey that top notch day care contributes to secure attachment relationships in children.

People have commented on this matter stating that &quot;legislative initiatives reflecting higher standards for credentialing and licensing childcare workers, requiring education in child development and attachment theory, and at least a two-year associate degree course as well as salary increases and increased stature for childcare positions&quot;. Corporations should implement more flexible work arrangements that recognize child care as essential for all its employees. This includes re-examination of parental leave policies. Too many parents are forced to return to work too soon post childbirth because of company policy or financial necessity. No matter the reason this inhibits early parent child bonding. In addition to this, there should be increased attention to the training and screening of childcare workers. In his article reviewing attachment theory, Sweeney suggested, among several policy implications, &quot;legislative initiatives reflecting higher standards for credentialing and licensing childcare workers, requiring education in child development and attachment theory, and at least a two-year associate degree course as well as salary increases and increased stature for childcare positions&quot;.

Historically, attachment theory had significant policy implications for hospitalized or institutionalized children, and those in poor quality daycare. Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group settings, has deleterious effects on social development. It is plain from research that poor quality care carries risks but that those who experience good quality alternative care cope well although it is difficult to provide good quality, individualized care in group settings.

Attachment theory has implications in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus focusing on the quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along with the impact of step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.

Attachment theory can also inform decisions made in social work, especially in humanistic social work (Petru Stefaroi), and court processes about foster care or other placements. Considering the child&#x27;s attachment needs can help determine the level of risk posed by placement options. Within adoption, the shift from &quot;closed&quot; to &quot;open&quot; adoptions and the importance of the search for biological parents would be expected on the basis of attachment theory. Many researchers in the field were strongly influenced by it.

===Clinical practice in children===
Although attachment theory has become a major scientific theory of socioemotional development with one of the widest research lines in modern psychology, it has, until recently, been less used in clinical practice. The attachment theory focused on the attention of the child when the mother is there and the responses that the child shows when the mother leaves, which indicated the attachment and bonding of the mother and the child. The attention therapy is done while the child is being restrained by the therapists and the responses displayed were noted. The tests were done to show the responses of the child.

This may be partly due to lack of attention paid to clinical application by Bowlby himself and partly due to broader meanings of the word &#x27;attachment&#x27; used among practitioners. It may also be partly due to the mistaken association of attachment theory with the pseudoscientific interventions misleadingly known as &quot;holding therapy&quot;.

====Prevention and treatment====
In 1988, Bowlby published a series of lectures indicating how attachment theory and research could be used in understanding and treating child and family disorders. His focus for bringing about change was the parents&#x27; internal working models, parenting behaviours and the parents&#x27; relationship with the therapeutic intervenor. Ongoing research has led to a number of individual treatments and prevention and intervention programs. In regards to personal development, children from all the age groups were tested to show the effectiveness of the theory that is being theorized by Bowlby. They range from individual therapy to public health programs to interventions designed for foster caregivers. For infants and younger children, the focus is on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver. An assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the caregiver is invariably included, as attachment is a two-way process involving attachment behaviour and caregiver response. Some programs are aimed at foster cares because the attachment behaviours of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses. Modern prevention and intervention programs have proven successful.

====Reactive attachment disorder and attachment disorder====

One atypical attachment pattern is considered to be an actual disorder, known as &quot;reactive attachment disorder&quot; or RAD, which is a recognized psychiatric diagnosis (ICD-10 F94.1/2 and DSM-IV-TR 313.89). Against common misconception, this is not the same as &#x27;disorganized attachment&#x27;. The essential feature of reactive attachment disorder is markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts that begins before age five years, associated with gross pathological care. There are two subtypes, one reflecting a disinhibited attachment pattern, the other an inhibited pattern. RAD is not a description of insecure attachment styles, however problematic those styles may be; instead, it denotes a lack of age-appropriate attachment behaviours that may appear to resemble a clinical disorder. Although the term &quot;reactive attachment disorder&quot; is now popularly applied to perceived behavioural difficulties that fall outside the DSM or ICD criteria, particularly on the Web and in connection with the pseudo-scientific attachment therapy, &quot;true&quot; RAD is thought to be rare.

&quot;Attachment disorder&quot; is an ambiguous term, which may refer to reactive attachment disorder or to the more problematic insecure attachment styles (although none of these are clinical disorders). It may also be used to refer to proposed new classification systems put forward by theorists in the field, and is used within attachment therapy as a form of unvalidated diagnosis. One of the proposed new classifications, &quot;secure base distortion&quot; has been found to be associated with caregiver traumatization.

===Clinical practice in adults and families===
As attachment theory offers a broad, far-reaching view of human functioning, it can enrich a therapist&#x27;s understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns.

==Criticism==
A 2016 article from the &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot; suggests that one&#x27;s attachment could largely be due to heredity; hence, the authors point to the need to focus research on nonshared environmental effects, requiring &quot;behavioral genetic designs that afford differentiating heritability from shared and nonshared environmental influences&quot;. The late Dr. Jerome Kagan was a highly respected psychologist who believed a child&#x27;s behaviour is largely due to temperament, as well as social class and culture, rather than attachment style. 

A 2013 study from Utah State suggests an individual can have different attachment styles in relation to different people and that &quot;parents&#x27; time away from their child was not a significant predictor of attachment.&quot; Attachment theory models are heavily focused on attachment to the mother, not other family members and peers, also noted by Rosjke Hasseldine. Salvador Minuchin suggested that attachment theory&#x27;s focus on the mother-child relation ignores the value in other familial influences: &quot;The entire family—not just the mother or primary caretaker—including father, siblings, grandparents, often cousins, aunts and uncles, are extremely significant in the experience of the child...And yet, when I hear attachment theorists talk, I don&#x27;t hear anything about these other important figures in a child&#x27;s life.&quot;

A 2018 paper proposes that Attachment theory represents a Western middle-class perspective, ignoring the diverse caregiving values and practices in most of the world.

<text>Nash Bridges is an American police procedural television series created by Carlton Cuse. The show stars Don Johnson and Cheech Marin as two Inspectors with the San Francisco Police Department&#x27;s Special Investigations Unit (SIU).

The series ran for six seasons on CBS from March 29, 1996, to May 4, 2001. A total of 122 episodes aired.

A TV film appeared on the USA Network in 2021.

== Premise ==
&quot;Nash Bridges&quot; stars Don Johnson as the eponymous Nash Bridges, an inspector (and later captain) with the San Francisco Police Department&#x27;s elite &quot;Special Investigations Unit&quot;. The show begins with Bridges in his 40s, twice-divorced, and co-parenting his teenage daughter, Cassidy (Jodi Lyn O&#x27;Keefe). Nash convinces recently retired Inspector Joe Dominguez (Cheech Marin), to return to the force and partner with him. Nash and Joe cruise the streets of San Francisco in Nash&#x27;s 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible, a gift from Nash&#x27;s brother Bobby just before Bobby left for the Vietnam War. The car was originally to be painted Curious Yellow, but was switched to factory Caterpillar Yellow, due to lighting and camera appearances. The car was portrayed by several replicas of a 1971 Hemi &#x27;Cuda convertible.

Bobby Bridges was reported as MIA, but turns up in the season 3 episode &quot;Revelations&quot;, played by Jan-Michael Vincent. Nash&#x27;s father, Nick (James Gammon), suffers from mild dementia and has a habit of getting kicked out of nursing homes. He eventually moves in with Nash, and is often involved in comic subplots that are intertwined with some of the show&#x27;s dark humor themes.

Aiding Nash in his police work is the technically savvy Harvey Leek (Jeff Perry), a middle-aged &quot;Deadhead&quot; (a die hard Grateful Dead fan). Another is the young, hotheaded Evan Cortez (Jaime P. Gomez), who has an off-and-on relationship with Cassidy. In later seasons, other inspectors and supporting characters were added or removed from the cast.

For the first sixteen episodes, the commander of the SIU was Lieutenant A. J. Shimamura (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), a character who was said to have returned to his native Hawaii after failing to be promoted to captain. Shimamura&#x27;s departure opened the door for Bridges to be promoted to captain and given command of the SIU.

== Episodes ==

== Cast and characters ==
=== Main ===
* Don Johnson as Inspector/Acting Lieutenant/Captain Nash Bridges: Nash is a seasoned police Inspector in his 40s, with a lifelong devotion to the SFPD. He&#x27;s got a photographic memory and a tendency to call everyone &quot;Bubba&quot; or &quot;Sister.&quot; His personal life isn&#x27;t as balanced as his professional one, starting with his two divorces and a strained relationship with both his aged father and a daughter. An amateur magician with a talent for handcuff tricks, Don Johnson is the only member of the cast to appear in all 122 episodes of the series.
* Cheech Marin as Inspector/Lieutenant Joe Dominguez: At the start of the series, Insp. Dominguez is talked out of retirement to partner with Nash. He is married to a statuesque Swedish woman, Inger, and together they have a daughter, Lucia, and a son, JJ. Dominguez&#x27;s character is light-hearted, often making witty, off-the-cuff observations at crime scenes. He has a penchant for getting involved in get-rich quick schemes, often having to be rescued by Nash. The details of Nash &amp; Dominguez&#x27;s relationship (and why they are such close friends) is revealed during the course of the series: As a young cop with a bright future, Dominguez ruined his reputation by being busted for a DUI. The only person to stand by him was his partner at the time, later revealed to be Nash. In later seasons, Nash &amp; Joe form a private detective agency to make extra money.
* Jodi Lyn O&#x27;Keefe as Cassidy Bridges: Nash&#x27;s daughter who originally aspired to be an actress. Cassidy had a tough relationship with Evan that had them eventually reconciling and about to marry, before Evan was killed. This inspired Cassidy to join the SFPD after his death. She was then assigned to the SIU as a plain-clothes officer, under her father&#x27;s command. By the end of the series, Cassidy relocated to Paris to be with her mother.
* Jeff Perry as Inspector Harvey Leek: A die-hard Grateful Dead fan with a technical background. His wife left him after years of marriage because of his commitment to police work. Best friend to Evan and one of Nash&#x27;s team, and very passionate about his &#x27;72 Ford Ranchero. The Ranchero is seen in the series almost as often as Nash&#x27;s Barracuda until the car was irreparably damaged in a shootout near the end of the fifth season.
* Jaime P. Gomez as Inspector Evan Cortez (seasons 1–5): Best friend to Harvey and the youngest partner of Nash, who suggested he rejoin working with Joe at the beginning of the series. Evan reminded Nash of what he used to be long ago. He had a stormy relationship with Cassidy, which after many ups and downs, ended when he was killed in the line of duty. Evan had reconciled with Cassidy at the time and was engaged to her for a Las Vegas wedding. Previous to that, Evan went through a painful period during the fifth season after his breakup with Cassidy (after he&#x27;d cheated on her on the eve of their wedding) and the loss of his job as a drunk on a downward spiral. With Joe&#x27;s intervention and his own participation in a 12-Step Alcoholics Anonymous program, the character became a Christian and recovering alcoholic. Jaime Gomez appeared in all but six episodes of the series&#x27; first five seasons.
* Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Lieutenant A. J. Shimamura (seasons 1 &amp; 2): A former police superior who worked closely with Nash and the SIU as both co-worker and friend. A. J. held true to a promise that if he wasn&#x27;t promoted to captain, he would leave the force and move back to his native Hawaii, which occurred during the second season.

He also tends to get involved in Joe Dominguez&#x27;s get rich quick schemes. Nick suffers from light dementia and that affliction was dealt with thoughtfully throughout the series. A source of conflict between him and his son was the character&#x27;s preference for his older son, Bobby Bridges, over Nash.
* Mary Mara as Inspector Bryn Carson (season 2; guest seasons 1 &amp; 3): The only female member of the SIU at the beginning of the series, she was often used to go undercover when a woman&#x27;s role was needed.

* Wendy Moniz as Inspector Rachel McCabe (season 6): Cassidy&#x27;s senior partner and a new addition to the SIU in the final season.

* Cress Williams as Inspector Antwon Babcock (season 6): Evan&#x27;s replacement in the final season. Antwon rescued the SIU from an explosion when he drove a car off a pier on his first day.

== Production ==
The show was produced and filmed on location in the San Francisco Bay Area. The show shot on the streets of San Francisco including The Embarcadero and Piers 30 through 32. Neighboring Treasure Island was used as the headquarters for the show. Hangar 2 on Treasure Island was the location of permanent sets including Nash&#x27;s apartment The show employed several hundred local workers including production crews and staff members, carpenters, electricians, set designers, grips, set dressers, props, scenic artists, location managers, costumers, drivers, cameramen, special effects, soundmen, makeup and hair stylists and production assistants. Episode production was nearly $2 million per episode. 

&quot;Nash Bridges&quot; premiered on March 29, 1996, at 10:00pm on CBS.

The show was produced by the Don Johnson Company and Carlton Cuse Productions in association with Rysher Entertainment for the first 4 seasons. In 1999, Paramount Network Television took over Rysher&#x27;s spot after acquiring that company.

The show used three different main theme songs during its initial run. Season 1 used primarily an instrumental piece written by Elia Cmíral. Seasons 2–5 used the theme &quot;I Got a Friend in You&quot; written by Eddie Jobson and sung by Gigi MacKenzie and is by far the most well-known of the show&#x27;s opening themes. Season 6 changed the theme again, using another primarily instrumental piece with a bit of a techno beat to it, this time written by Velton Ray Bunch. A fourth song, also written by Cmíral which was Johnson&#x27;s original choice, sometimes replaces the first season song in syndication.

=== Cancellation ===
The sixth season of &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; would be its last; however, the show was obtaining fair ratings from Nielsen. Following its Friday night ratings battle (which it was losing to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;), the show was canceled. Paramount Network Television, which was producing the show, felt that its $2 million per episode production cost was just too much. CBS was hoping to get a seventh season out of &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, but that failed because Paramount wasn&#x27;t willing to pay, even though at the time, Viacom owned both CBS and Paramount.

Another factor that led to the ending of the series was that Don Johnson wanted out. Johnson was getting tired, and CBS and Paramount had enough episodes to put the series into syndication.

Carlton Cuse went on to become the showrunner for &quot;Lost&quot;. &quot;Lost&quot; co-creator Damon Lindelof had started his television writing career on &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. He sought out Cuse&#x27;s advice on how to run &quot;Lost&quot;.

== Broadcast ==
The show has aired in over 70 countries. It currently airs in the Middle East on MBC&#x27;s newly launched Action block MBC Action, Crime &amp; Investigation Network, WGN America, Universal HD in the United States, TV1 in Australia, 13th Street in The Netherlands and Universal Channel in Serbia and on CBS Action in the United Kingdom. The series currently airs on H&amp;I on Mondays as part of the channel&#x27;s &quot;Day Shift,&quot; starting at 12 p.m. Eastern/11 a.m. Central for five episodes.

CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) released the first three seasons of &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; on DVD in Region 1 in 2008/2009. As of September 2014, these releases have been discontinued and are now out of print.

On September 10, 2014, it was announced that Visual Entertainment (VEI) has sub-licensed the rights to the series from CBS in Region 1 and would release a complete series collection in early 2015. It was subsequently released on November 18, 2014. The 27-disc set contains all 122 episodes of the series.

King Records is releasing all of the seasons on DVD in Region 2, specifically through the Japanese market.

The complete series is also available for streaming on the Plex Inc. streaming service.

== Revival TV film ==
On July 18, 2019, it was reported that USA Network was working with Village Roadshow Entertainment Group, which controlled the Rysher Entertainment intellectual property, to revive &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. The show would reportedly have series star Don Johnson reprising the titular role and serving as one of the showrunners for the project. It was reported to be a two-hour special which, if successful, could serve as a backdoor pilot for a revival of the series. This revival would follow Nash, still running the SFPD&#x27;s SIU and working to adjust to a new boss and to the changes of San Francisco in the 2020s. In May 2021, further casting for the television film was announced, with series stars Cheech Marin and Jeff Perry reported to return for the film along with Johnson.

The film premiered on November 27, 2021. In January 2022, the revival was nominated for the Outstanding TV Movie at the 33rd GLAAD Media Awards.

== Popular culture references ==
* &quot;The Sopranos&quot; character Christopher Moltisanti, when referring to screenwriter &quot;J.T.&quot; Dolan (hired to write the screenplay for &#x27;Cleaver&#x27;) lists &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; as one of his credits.
* In 1997 an episode called &quot;Wild Card&quot; guest starred Philip Michael Thomas (who had been Johnson&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Miami Vice&quot;) reuniting Johnson for the first time on television together since &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, and Tommy Chong (who had been Marin&#x27;s longtime partner in the &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&quot; comedy team) reuniting with Marin. The &quot;Wild Card&quot; episode also contains a nod to Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s iconic &quot;Dave&quot; from their 1972 self-titled debut album. Philip Michael Thomas also guest-starred on an episode called &quot;Out of Miami&quot;. It also featured Steven Bauer, the ex-husband of Johnson&#x27;s ex-wife, Melanie Griffith. He played a Miami drug lord, which is a reference to his main role in the film &quot;Scarface&quot;. A version of the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; theme is heard playing in the background. In an early interview, Johnson compared Bridges to his &quot;Miami Vice&quot; character Sonny Crockett, saying Nash was &quot;the same guy, just... ten years older.&quot;
* In the 1997 season 2 episode, &quot;The Counterfeiters&quot;, another one of Johnson&#x27;s co-stars from &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, John Diehl, guest stars as a criminal posing as an S.I.U. officer.
* Aaron Spelling was so eager to cast Yasmine Bleeth in the role of Heather Lane-Williams on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Titans&quot; in 2000 that his company convinced CBS to grant her an early release from her &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; contract. 
* The first script was written by neighbors Don Johnson and Hunter S. Thompson as a TV movie about a drug-addicted cop, Nash, who dated a known mobster&#x27;s daughter, and his Latino partner. It is said that Thompson appears as a piano player in the pilot but this is an error as it is actually George Michalski, who worked as a Music Consultant for almost the entire run of Nash Bridges.
* There were six different Barracudas made up to resemble the 1971 Hemi Cuda convertible that Nash drove. Five of these were built from 1970 and 1971 Cuda and Barracuda convertibles and the fifth FX car was made from a 1973 coupe converted into a convertible. The fifth FX car and the sixth 440 4-speed Cuda were built and added in the fifth season so most people think there were only four since earlier promo photos only show four of the six used in filming. None of these actually had Hemi engines, but rather 318–440 engines including new Mopar Performance crate motors. Four cars were automatic transmissions and two were 440 4-speed cars. The color of the car as depicted resembles the factory&#x27;s &quot;Curious Yellow&quot; option (an allusion by the factory to the movie &quot;I Am Curious, Yellow&quot;) but, in fact, screen tests proved the factory color did not read well on camera. All show cars were painted an off-the-shelf color from paint distributor Sherwin-Williams.

<text>Desperate Housewives is an American  mystery comedy-drama television series created by Marc Cherry, and produced by ABC Studios and Cherry Productions. It aired for eight seasons on ABC from October 3, 2004, until May 13, 2012, for a total of 180 episodes. Executive producer Marc Cherry served as showrunner. Other executive producers since the fourth season included Bob Daily, George W. Perkins, John Pardee, Joey Murphy, David Grossman, and Larry Shaw.

Set on Wisteria Lane, a street in the fictional town of Fairview in the fictional Eagle State, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; follows the lives of a group of women as seen through the eyes of their friend and neighbor who commits suicide in the pilot episode. The series covers fifteen years of the women&#x27;s lives, which includes a five-year timeline jump in the series&#x27; narrative. The women work through domestic struggles and family life, while being faced with the secrets, crimes, and mysteries hidden behind the doors of their on-the-surface—beautiful, and seemingly perfect, suburban neighborhood.

The series features an ensemble cast, headed by Teri Hatcher as Susan Mayer, Felicity Huffman as Lynette Scavo, Marcia Cross as Bree Van de Kamp, and Eva Longoria as Gabrielle Solis. The supporting cast included Nicollette Sheridan as Edie Britt, Dana Delany as Katherine Mayfair, and Vanessa Williams as Renee Perry. Brenda Strong narrates the series as the late Mary Alice Young, appearing sporadically in flashbacks or dream sequences.

&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was well received by viewers and critics alike, receiving many accolades. It won multiple Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards. From the 2004–05 through the 2008–09 television seasons, its first five seasons were rated amongst the top ten most-watched series. And it remained in the top 10 for the key 18-49 demographic into its 6th season through the 2009–10 television season. In 2007, it was reported to be the most popular show in its demographic worldwide, with an audience of approximately 120 million and was also reported as the third-most-watched television series in a study of ratings in twenty countries. In 2012, it remained the most-watched comedy series internationally based on data from Eurodata TV Worldwide, which measured ratings across five continents; it has held this position since 2006. Moreover, it was the third-highest revenue-earning series for 2010, with $2.74 million per half an hour. The show was ranked at number fifty-six on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;New TV Classics&quot; list.

In August 2011, it was confirmed that the eighth season of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; would be the show&#x27;s last; the series finale aired on May 13, 2012. By the end of the series, it had surpassed &quot;Charmed&quot; with the most episodes in an hour-long television series featuring all female leads.

==Premise==

The first season premiered on October 3, 2004, and introduces the four central characters of the show: Susan Mayer, Lynette Scavo, Bree Van de Kamp and Gabrielle Solis, as well as their families and neighbors on Wisteria Lane. The main mystery of the season is the unexpected suicide of Mary Alice Young, and the involvement of her husband Paul Young (Mark Moses) and their son Zach (Cody Kasch) in the events leading up to it. Susan fights promiscuous neighbour Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan) for the affection of new neighbor Mike Delfino (James Denton), Lynette struggles to cope with her four demanding children, Bree fights to save her marriage to Rex Van de Kamp (Steven Culp) while dealing with her rebellious son Andrew Van de Kamp (Shawn Pyfrom), and Gabrielle tries to prevent her husband Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) from discovering that she is having an affair with their gardener, John Rowland (Jesse Metcalfe). The first season is also marked by mystery surrounding the murder of a neighbour and some secrets revealed about Zach, Mike, and Paul. At the end of the season both Paul and Zach go missing.

The second season premiered on September 25, 2005, and its central mystery is that of new neighbor Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), who moves onto Wisteria Lane with her son Matthew in the middle of the night, from Chicago. She keeps someone prisoner in her basement who tries to escape multiple times. Throughout the season, Bree tries to cope with being a widow, unknowingly begins dating the man who had poisoned her husband, fights alcoholism, and is unable to prevent the gap between her and her son Andrew from growing to extremes, and deals with her daughter Danielle&#x27;s new romance with Matthew Applewhite. Susan&#x27;s love life becomes even more complicated as she has serious conflicts with Mike, and her ex-husband Karl Mayer (Richard Burgi) who is engaged to Edie, also starts to lean towards Susan. Lynette goes back to her career in advertising while her husband Tom Scavo (Doug Savant) becomes a stay-at-home father, and Gabrielle decides to be faithful to Carlos, who is now in prison after being double-crossed by a business partner, and begins preparations to have a child. Paul is framed and sent to jail, not for the murder he committed in the previous season, but for a fake one. Paul&#x27;s son Zack reconnects with his wealthy maternal grandfather.

The third season premiered on September 24, 2006. In the third season, Bree marries Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), whose past and involvement with a recently discovered dead body becomes the main mystery of the season. Meanwhile, Lynette has to adjust to the arrival of Tom&#x27;s previously unknown daughter (Kayla) and her mother (Nora) to the family. The Scavos also experience tension as Tom wants to start a pizzeria. Gabrielle goes through a rough divorce, tries to get back into modelling, but finally finds new love in Fairview&#x27;s new mayor, Victor Lang. After being run over by Orson in the previous season finale, Mike falls into a coma and suffers from amnesia when he wakes up. Edie sees her chance to make her move on Mike, and her family relations are explored throughout the season. Susan loses hope that Mike&#x27;s memory will return and in the process moves on to a handsome Englishman, Ian Hainsworth (Dougray Scott), whose wife is also in a coma, while her daughter Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen) starts dating Edie&#x27;s nephew, Austin McCann (Josh Henderson), of which Susan disapproves. Elderly neighbor Karen McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten) hides something in her freezer. A shooting at the local grocery store leaves two characters dead and changes everyone&#x27;s lives forever.

The fourth season premiered on September 30, 2007, and its main mystery revolves around new neighbor Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) and her family, who return to Wisteria Lane after twelve years away. Lynette battles cancer; the newlywed—but unhappy—Gabrielle starts an affair with her ex-husband Carlos; Susan and Mike enjoy life as a married couple and learn that they are expecting a child; Bree fakes a pregnancy on behalf of her daughter (Danielle Van de Kamp) and plans to raise her teenage daughter&#x27;s illegitimate child as her own; and Edie schemes to hold on to her new love, Carlos, who has moved in with Mike as an interim arrangement. A gay couple from Chicago—Lee McDermott (Kevin Rahm) and Bob Hunter (Tuc Watkins)—become residents of Wisteria Lane. A tornado threatens to destroy everything, and everyone, that the housewives hold dear. In the closing minutes, the characters and their story have flashed forward by five years.

The fifth season premiered on September 28, 2008, with the time period jumping forward five years after the previous season, with some flashbacks to events which happened between the two periods. The season mystery revolves around Edie&#x27;s new husband, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough), who is looking for revenge on someone on Wisteria Lane (later revealed to be Mike because of a road accident Mike and Susan were involved in that killed Dave&#x27;s wife and daughter). Susan and Mike are divorced due to the accident putting pressure on their marriage. Susan deals with being a single mother to son MJ Delfino, and having a new romance with her painter, while Mike starts dating Katherine. Lynette and Tom learn that their now teenage son Porter is having an affair with a married woman whose husband&#x27;s nightclub burns down with all of Wisteria Lane&#x27;s neighbors inside. Gabrielle struggles with Carlos&#x27; blindness, triggered in an injury during the tornado in season 4; two overweight young daughters, Juanita and Celia; and a financial crisis. Bree and Orson have marriage problems because Bree had pressured Orson into doing time in prison for running over Mike and he resents her. She has become too focused on her career as a successful cookbook writer and caterer, and her daughter Danielle had come to claim back her son while Orson was in prison. Edie dies of electrocution after a car crash, before she can expose Dave&#x27;s motives moments after she discovers his secret.

The sixth season premiered on Sunday, September 27, 2009, at 9pm. The main mystery of this season is surrounding new neighbor Angie Bolen (Drea de Matteo) and her family. The first half of the season consists of Julie being strangled by an unknown person, the conflict between Gabrielle and her niece Ana Solis (Maiara Walsh), Karen McCluskey finding new love, Lynette&#x27;s attempts to sue her new boss Carlos for firing her for getting pregnant, Katherine&#x27;s eventual mental breakdown at losing Mike to Susan, and Bree&#x27;s affair with Karl, which ends tragically when Karl&#x27;s hired plane crashes into a building with him and Orson inside, killing Karl and leaving Orson paralyzed. The second half of the season focuses on Katherine experimenting with her sexuality, Lynette unknowingly inviting the Fairview strangler to stay with them before discovering the truth, the conflict between Bree and a son of Rex whom he had before meeting her, and the solving of the Bolen mystery.

The seventh season premiered on September 26, 2010, and its main mystery is Paul Young&#x27;s return to Wisteria Lane with a new wife and with plans of punishing the residents for shunning him during his incarceration, while an old nemesis of his still plans to get her own revenge on him. Lynette&#x27;s best friend from college Renee Perry (Vanessa Williams) moves onto the lane and stirs things up among the other housewives. Gabrielle and Carlos learn an unsettling fact about their daughter Juanita Solis (Madison De La Garza) (who was switched at birth), which ultimately leads them back to Gabrielle&#x27;s home town of Las Colinas. A now divorced Bree starts dating her contractor, and reveals the truth about the death of Carlos&#x27; mother Juanita at the hands of her son Andrew in the second season, consequently ending the friendship between Carlos and Bree. Due to financial problems, Susan and her family have moved off the lane, and Susan is forced to earn money by doing pornography. Following a major riot on the lane, Susan is injured and put on the waiting list for a vital organ donation. Lynette persuades Tom to take an exciting new job, which leads to unprecedented problems in their marriage.

The eighth and final season premiered on Sunday, September 25, 2011. The main mystery of the season is the death of Gabrielle&#x27;s perverted stepfather Alejandro Perez (Tony Plana) at Carlos&#x27; hands, and its cover-up by the four housewives, which occurred in the previous season finale. After the murder, Bree receives a blackmail letter from an unknown person similar to the one Mary Alice had received in the first season. Due to her relationship with detective Chuck Vance (Jonathan Cake), Bree becomes the main character affected by the cover-up of Alejandro&#x27;s murder, and is eventually accused of killing Alejandro herself. A new neighbor, Ben Faulkner (Charles Mesure), moves onto the lane, attracting Renee along the way. Ben is going through severe financial problems, and resorts to a dangerous and unruly loan shark to bail him out. Mike meddles in the business of Ben&#x27;s loan shark in an attempt to protect Renee, but he is eventually shot dead by the loan shark. During the first half of the season, Susan struggles with the guilt of her involvement in the Alejandro case, and during the second half, she tries to deal with both Julie&#x27;s unexpected pregnancy at the hands of Lynette&#x27;s son Preston and Mike&#x27;s death. Following the cover-up of Alejandro&#x27;s murder, Carlos develops an alcohol problem, but Gabrielle persuades him to recover in rehab, which eventually results in Gabrielle and Carlos switching house roles. Tom moves out of the family home, and Lynette struggles to come to terms with how quickly Tom seems to have moved on, until she accepts that she is still in love with him, and decides she will try to win him back. Mrs. McCluskey receives worrying news about her health and decides to end it all, but Bree manages to convince her otherwise.

The two-hour series finale, which aired on Sunday, May 13, 2012, featured the conclusion of Bree&#x27;s court case. To bring the series to a conclusion, there was a wedding, a birth, and a death, and the future of the four main housewives was revealed.

==Cast and characters==

During its premiere season, the show featured thirteen starring actors, all credited in the opening sequence. For the show&#x27;s second year, several actors, mainly child and teenage ones, who had guest starred during the first season, were promoted to series regulars without having their names included in the opening sequence. Instead, they were billed as &quot;also starring&quot; during the first minutes of each episode, together with episode guest stars. This practice continued for the rest of the season.

;Cast Notes
==Production==
The idea for the series was conceived as Marc Cherry and his mother were watching a news report on Andrea Yates. Prior to &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, Cherry was best known for producing and writing episodes of Touchstone Television&#x27;s hit comedy series &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; and its successor, &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;. In addition, he had created or co-created three sitcoms: &quot;The 5 Mrs. Buchanans&quot;, &quot;The Crew&quot;, and &quot;Some of My Best Friends&quot;, none of which lasted longer than a year. Cherry had difficulty getting any television network interested in his new series; HBO, CBS, NBC, Fox, Showtime, and Lifetime all turned the show down. Finally, two new executives at ABC, Lloyd Braun and Susan Lyne, chose to greenlight it, reportedly after &quot;The O.C.&quot; on Fox premiered in 2003 and showed that a soap opera could succeed in prime time.
Marc Cherry stated: &quot;In April 2002, I was absolutely &#x27;desperate.&#x27; I was broke, couldn&#x27;t even land an interview for a screenplay, and was seriously worried about my future. I had just turned forty and was starting to wonder if I wasn&#x27;t one of those poor deluded souls wandering around Hollywood convinced they were talented screenwriters when all evidence pointed to the contrary. But since I have a considerable amount of self-esteem [...], I started writing the first draft of Desperate Housewives, convinced it could turn my life around. Guys, if I hadn&#x27;t seen it right!&quot;.
Shortly thereafter, Disney had both Braun and Lyne fired, following their approval of another new drama series: &quot;Lost&quot;.

The ABC executives were not initially satisfied with the name of the new show, suggesting &quot;Wisteria Lane&quot; and &quot;The Secret Lives of Housewives&quot;, instead. However, on October 23, 2003, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was announced by ABC, presented as a primetime soap opera created by Charles Pratt Jr., of &quot;Melrose Place&quot; fame, and Marc Cherry, who declared the new show to be a mix of &quot;Knots Landing&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999) with a little bit of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. While Cherry continued his work on the show, Pratt was credited as executive producer for the pilot episode only, remaining linked to the show as a consulting producer during the first two seasons.

On May 18, 2004, ABC announced the 2004–2005 lineup, with &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; in the Sunday at 9:00–10:00 p.m. ET slot, which it held all through the run of the show. After only three episodes, on October 20, 2004, ABC announced that &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, along with &quot;Lost&quot;, had been picked up for a full season. A couple of weeks later after &quot;Housewives&quot; premiered the owners of NBC called to see who had passed on the series due to its ratings success.

&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was produced by creator Marc Cherry (Cherry Productions), Austin Bagley and, since 2007, ABC Studios. From 2004 to 2007, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was produced in association with Touchstone Television.

===Production crew===
Cherry, Tom Spezialy, and Michael Edelstein served as executive producers for the show&#x27;s first two seasons. Spezialy, who also served as a staff writer, left his previous position as writer and executive producer for &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; to join the &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; crew. He had also worked as writer and co-executive producer on several shows, among them &quot;Ed&quot;, &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;, and &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;, while Edelstein had been the executive producer of &quot;Threat Matrix&quot; and &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot;.

Second season conflicts arose among the executive producers. Subsequently, Edelstein left the show mid-season, and by the season&#x27;s end, so did Spezialy. For the third year, Cherry was joined by award-winning writer and producer Joe Keenan—of &quot;Frasier&quot; fame—and television movie producer George W. Perkins, who had been a crew member of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; since the show&#x27;s conception. Although receiving praise for his work on the show, Keenan chose to leave &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; after one season to pursue other projects. Replacing him as executive producer for season 4 was Bob Daily, who had joined the crew as a writer and co-executive producer during season 3. Daily&#x27;s previous work include writing for the animated series &quot;Rugrats&quot;, and for &quot;Frasier&quot;. Also joining Cherry, Perkins, and Daily for season 4 were John Pardee and Joey Murphy, who had been with the series since the beginning. Both had also worked on Cherry&#x27;s previous show, &quot;The Crew&quot;, in 1995, as well as on the sitcom &quot;Cybill&quot;.

In the first four seasons, Larry Shaw and David Grossman have been the most prolific directors, together directing more than half of the episodes.

===Filming===

&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was filmed on Panavision 35 mm cameras (except for the final season, which was shot digitally on the Arri Alexa). It was broadcast in standard and widescreen high definition, though it was framed for the 4:3 aspect ratio until the final season.

The set for Wisteria Lane, consisting mainly of facades but also of some actual houses, was located on the Universal Studios Hollywood back lot. It was referred to by film crews as &quot;Colonial Street&quot;, and has been used for several motion pictures and television shows since the mid-1940s. Notable productions that were filmed here include: &quot;So Goes My Love&quot;, &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot;, &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot;, &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, &quot;Bedtime for Bonzo&quot;, &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;, &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and the Doris Day comedies &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot; and &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot;. For the second season of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, the street underwent some significant changes. Among the most noticeable of these changes was the removal of a church facade and a mansion in order to make room for Edie&#x27;s house and a park.

Interior sets were built on sound stages at Universal Studios Hollywood, some of which were duplicated in some form on the Wisteria Lane back lot for filming when conditions required it.

Filming for the series ended April 26, 2012.

===Opening sequence===
The initial idea for the show&#x27;s opening sequence was Cherry&#x27;s. After asking 16 companies to come up with suggestions for how best to realize it, the producers finally hired Hollywood-based yU+co to provide the final version. According to the yU+co&#x27;s official website, the idea behind the sequence is, &quot;to evoke the show&#x27;s quirky spirit and playful flouting of women&#x27;s traditional role in society.&quot; The images featured are taken from eight pieces of art, portraying domesticity and male–female relations through the ages.

The music for the opening was composed by Danny Elfman, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design in 2005. It also has been awarded both a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music in 2005 and the BMI TV Music Award. In 2005, it was included on the album &quot;Music from and Inspired by Desperate Housewives&quot;. In 2017, James Charisma of &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the show&#x27;s opening sequence at the 29th position on a list of &quot;The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time&quot;. When an episode runs long, only the first sequence (the falling apple) is kept. From the fourth season onwards, a shortened synthesized version of the theme (arranged and performed by frequent series composer Steve Jablonsky) is heard, which underscores the falling apple scene, and the photograph of the four lead actresses, crediting Marc Cherry as creator.

===Music===
In addition to the theme composed by Danny Elfman, the first two episodes scored by Elfman&#x27;s former Oingo Boingo bandmate Steve Bartek, and the third episode scored by ex-Police Stewart Copeland, the series underscore music, composed by Steve Jablonsky since the fourth episode of the first season, defines the overall sound of the show by creating a musical counterpoint to the writing style. The score is electronic-based, but every scoring session incorporates a live string ensemble. Jablonsky incorporates recurring themes for events and characters into the score. Hollywood Records produced the first soundtrack album, &quot;Music from and Inspired by Desperate Housewives&quot; (2005), distributed by Universal Music Group. Several of those songs have been used in subsequent seasons.

&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;″ unique style combined with the heavy dialogue and a quick-fire writing style limits the amount of popular music used within the series. The series&#x27; music supervisor, David Sibley, works closely with the producers to integrate these musical needs into the show. In addition to featured performances by central characters such as Susan Mayer singing along with Rose Royce&#x27;s &quot;Car Wash&quot; and Lynette&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Boogie Shoes&quot;, several characters have been accomplished musicians, such as Betty Applewhite (a concert pianist) and Dylan Mayfair (a prodigy cellist).

===Later seasons===
In August 2009, Marc Cherry said that &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; would be on television for a few more years, stating that the series still &quot;has a lot of life left in it.&quot; He told &quot;The Wrap&quot;: He went on to explain that he felt the program had been revitalized by the five-year leap forward for season five, saying: &quot;Yes, I think it worked well. It was a way to start fresh and let everyone start from scratch in a way&quot;.

In October 2009, Cherry signed a two-year deal with ABC that could keep &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; on the air until 2013.
The stars of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; finalized new deals to make way for the eighth season and signed at the price of $12 million.

Cherry hinted that &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; would end in 2013, and in April 2011, Eva Longoria confirmed that there would definitely be an eighth season and expressed hopes for a ninth. &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was officially renewed by ABC on May 17, 2011, for an eighth season.

===Final season===
In August 2011, it was confirmed that the eighth season of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; would be the final season. Eva Longoria tweeted about the end of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;: 

Cherry, the show&#x27;s creator, made a cameo as a mover in the last scene of the final episode.

==Reception==
===Ratings===

===Critical response===
The show was the biggest success of the 2004–05 television season, being well received by both critics and viewers. The pilot episode had 21.3 million viewers making it the best new drama for the year, the highest-rated show of the week, and the best performance by a pilot for ABC, since &quot;Spin City&quot; in 1996.

Along with &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was credited to have turned around ABC&#x27;s declining fortunes. Many critics agreed with Cherry&#x27;s initial comparison to the popular black comedy film &quot;American Beauty&quot;, while its themes and appeal to female viewers were compared to those of the award-winning series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, and its mysteries were said to resemble those of David Lynch&#x27;s classic series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. In its first review, &quot;USA Today&quot; proclaimed the show to be &quot;refreshingly original, bracingly adult and thoroughly delightful&quot; and naming it to be &quot;sort of &quot;Knots Landing&quot; meets &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; by way of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;&quot;.

Following the initial success of the show, the term &quot;desperate housewives&quot; became a cultural phenomenon. This warranted &quot;real-life desperate housewives&quot; features in TV shows, including &quot;The Dr. Phil Show&quot;, and in magazines. Among the more prominent names to declare themselves fans of the show were Oprah Winfrey, who also dedicated an episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; to her visit at the film set; and the former First Lady of the United States, Laura Bush, who, in a comedic speech during a dinner with White House Correspondents&#x27; Association on April 30, 2005, stated, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I am a desperate housewife&quot;, referring to the show. The series ended up being the fourth-most-watched in the United States during the 2004–2005 season, with 23.7 million viewers each week. The first-season finale was watched by 30.62 million American viewers becoming the most watched episode of the series.

For its second year, the show still maintained its ratings—with 22.2 million viewers, it reclaimed its position as the number four most-watched series. The second season&#x27;s premiere was watched by 28.4 million viewers. The episode drew in the second largest audience for the series in its history. However, several critics started to notice a declining quality of the show&#x27;s script, and &quot;USA Today&quot; Robert Bianco suggested that the part of the series getting &quot;less good&quot; was that showrunner Cherry had left much of the series writing in the hands of others. Midway through the season executive producer Michael Edenstein left the show due to conflicts with Cherry and in May 2006, just a couple of weeks prior to the second-season finale, so did Tom Spezialy. After the end of the season, Cherry agreed that the second year&#x27;s script had been weaker and also agreed that it had been a mistake to let go too much of the show. He now stated that he was back full-time, claiming that both he and the writing staff had learned from their mistakes.

The critics generally agreed on the improved quality for the third year, but the overall ratings fell notably from previous seasons. Due to complications from her pregnancy, Marcia Cross was put on bed rest. After filming one episode from her own personal bedroom she was forced to take maternity leave with eight episodes of season three still remaining. It was predicted that the ratings would be down by over 25% since the premiere year. However, for the last three episodes of the season, the rating turned somewhat, and the season ended up with 17.5 million viewers, falling from number four to number ten on the list of most watched shows. While Cross&#x27; departure allowed for the much-underused Edie to have more story, fans noticed a decline in the stories during Cross&#x27; departure. Stories such as Lynette&#x27;s emotional affair with restaurant manager Rick proved unpopular. Furthermore, Susan&#x27;s contrived triangle with Ian and Mike seemed tiresome to many viewers, particularly in an episode where Susan is lost in the woods trying to find Mike. Notable, however, was that the show&#x27;s rating among viewers age 18–24 increased from the previous season.

For its fourth season, the series proved to have staying power. The series averaged 18.2 million viewers. Ratings rose in the ninth episode &quot;Something&#x27;s Coming&quot;, where 20.6 million viewers tuned in to see the heavily marketed tornado episode. The show once again moved back into the top five highest-rated programs in the 2007–2008 season, being the number-one ABC drama and beating popular medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; after falling behind it for the first time in the third season. It also became for the first time the number-one scripted series, beating &quot;&quot;.

Although ratings were down for the fifth season, along with every scripted series on television, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was still the most-watched scripted series on ABC, consistently beating the other ABC flagship shows, &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy,&quot; although the latter is still number one in the 18–49 demographic, followed by &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;.

Similar to the fifth season, ratings were down for the sixth season because of heavy competition in many airings, but the show still managed to remain the second most watched scripted show on ABC and the eleventh most watched scripted show of all broadcast television. The series continued to hit lower ratings, because of competition like the 67th Golden Globe Awards, 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, 2010 Winter Olympics, and the new CBS reality television series &quot;Undercover Boss&quot;. Nevertheless, the sixth season managed to finish in the top twenty overall, both in total viewers and 18–49 demographic audiences. Among scripted shows, it still ranked in the top ten, in both categories.

The seventh season premiered on September 26, 2010, and averaged 11.85 million viewers. The season saw new lows for the series reaching for the first time below 10 million viewers, and saw lows of 2.7 in the 18–49 demographic. For the first half of the season, ratings started strong averaging 12.3 million viewers and 3.9 in the 18–49 demographic which is similar to the second half of the sixth season. However, ratings declined in the second half of the season, after two contiguous episodes had to compete against the 68th Golden Globe Awards and then the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards. The show failed to recover to viewer levels hit in the first half of the season, and continued to receive 9–10 million viewers and 2.7–3.1 in the 18–49 demographic. This was the first time in its history that &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; would not place in the twenty most watched shows of the season, although it would place in the twenty most-watched scripted shows.

The eighth season continued to see declines in the series&#x27; ratings. The season premiered to 9.93 million viewers and a 3.2 in the demo making it the least-watched season premiere in the series&#x27; history. The season began with ratings similar to those of the latter half of season 7, averaging 8–9 million viewers, and between a 2.8 to 3.0 in the 18–49 demographic. However, after the mid-season finale the ratings returned lower, hitting the seven million viewer mark and a 2.2–2.5 in the demo. The season also saw the lowest ratings in the show&#x27;s eight-year run. Opposite the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, which featured a tribute to the then-recently deceased entertainer Whitney Houston, and the mid-season premiere of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; on AMC, the show fell to a 1.8 rating in adults 18–49 and 6.4 million viewers. However unlike the seventh season, the show&#x27;s ratings slightly recovered after the series low and leveled around the eight million viewer mark and a 2.6 in the demo. Despite the series lows, the season finale was able to go out on a season high in the ratings and the highest rated episode in over a year and a half, since March 2011 with &quot;Searching&quot;. The series finale titled &quot;Finishing the Hat&quot; aired May 13, 2012 was viewed by 11.12 million viewers and a 3.2 in the demo. Despite the lows in the ratings the show managed to remain in the top twenty-five-watched shows in the 18–49 demographic, placing at number twenty-five. However, the show dropped out of the top thirty most-watched shows in total viewers, coming in at thirty-fifth place.

In 2006, the American cable network Bravo launched their reality series, &quot;The Real Housewives of...&quot;, in the footsteps of the &quot;real life desperate housewives&quot; phenomenon. That program has taken place in areas such as Orange County (California), Atlanta, and two series within the New York-Tri-State Region, within the City itself and the New Jersey suburbs. According to a survey of twenty countries conducted in 2006 by &quot;Informa Telecoms and Media&quot;, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was the third-most-watched television series in the world, after fellow American series &quot;&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot;. During a fundraising auction for the British child charity ChildLine in December 2006, a walk-on part in &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; had the highest bid, £17,000, beating Daniel Craig&#x27;s James Bond tuxedo from &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

In its first public release of online individual television program rankings, Nielsen Media Research announced that the series had 723,000 unique online viewers in December 2008. &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was the seventh-most-pirated television show of 2009.

In fall 2013, North Korea allegedly executed eighty people for watching banned South Korean soap operas, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; being the most common soap opera. &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was being secretly watched using mp3 players, hard drives, and DVDs.

In September 2015, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; ranked at number one hundred on &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s 100 Favorite TV Shows&quot;, as determined by television industry professionals.

==Accolades==

For its premiere season, the show was awarded seven Primetime Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. The nominations of all of the leading actresses except Eva Longoria for both the Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award received some media interest. While Longoria seemingly wasn&#x27;t bothered, stating for the press that &quot;I&#x27;m new. I just arrived. I didn&#x27;t expect at all to be in the minds of the Academy&quot;, Marc Cherry regarded them being left out as a &quot;horrendous error&quot;. In the end, the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series went to Felicity Huffman, while Teri Hatcher won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Musical or Comedy, as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Actress – Comedy Series.

The show&#x27;s second Golden Globe Award for its first year was for Best Series – Musical or Comedy at the 62nd Golden Globe Awards, while the other Primetime Emmy Awards went to Kathryn Joosten, for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series, for her guest role as Karen McCluskey (beating, among others, fellow cast member Lupe Ontiveros); to Charles McDougall, for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, for his direction of &quot;Pilot&quot;; to Danny Elfman, for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music, for his theme music; for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series of &quot;Pilot&quot;; and for Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series at the 57th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards. The entire cast was awarded the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Cast – Comedy Series (in both 2004 and 2005), and Nicollette Sheridan was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.

In 2006, the show continued to receive several nominations. It was awarded with yet another Golden Globe Award for Best Series – Musical or Comedy at the 63rd Golden Globe Awards, and all the four leading women received Golden Globe Award nominations, although none of them won. The cast ensemble was awarded with another Screen Actors Guild Award, as was Felicity Huffman. Primetime Emmy Award nominations at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards included, among others, guest actress Shirley Knight and supporting actress Alfre Woodard, although none of them resulted in a win. It was nominated for the Pioneer Award at the BAFTA awards but lost to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which at the time was recently revamped.

The show did continue to be nominated in 2007—Felicity Huffman was granted a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for the second time, and guest actresses Laurie Metcalf and Dixie Carter also received Primetime Emmy Award nominations, at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards. The show, along with actresses Marcia Cross and Felicity Huffman, received Golden Globe Award nominations at 64th Golden Globe Awards, and Huffman and the cast ensemble were also nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Awards. None of the Primetime Emmy Award, Golden Globe Award, or Screen Actors Guild Award nominations resulted in any actual awards.

2008 yielded the least nominations with none at the 65th Golden Globe Awards and only the cast being nominated at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. The show was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards, including acting nods towards Polly Bergen and Kathryn Joosten for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Joosten won the show&#x27;s seventh Primetime Emmy Award and first since its debut year.

Nominations continued to decline in later years. Notable nominations included nods towards Beau Bridges and Kathryn Joosten in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Additionally, Brenda Strong received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2011, a notable feat for a category usually dominated by animated series. Also in 2011, Vanessa L. Williams won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series at the 41st NAACP Image Awards and a Satellite Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television. Strong and Joosten received Primetime Emmy Award nominations again at 64th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2012 and Williams won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for the series&#x27; eight and final season in 2013.

Other notable awards include the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite New Television Drama at the 31st People&#x27;s Choice Awards, the Future Classic Award at the 2005 TV Land Awards, the TP de Oro for Best Foreign Series in 2006, and seven Golden Nymph Awards at Monte-Carlo Television Festivals, among others.

==Merchandise==
===Games===
Buena Vista Games released the life simulation computer video game &quot;Desperate Housewives: The Game&quot; on October 5, 2006, in North America, featuring an original story line spanning 12 episodes. The game is set on Wisteria Lane, but the player does not play as any of the housewives, although they frequently appear. A couple of months later, Gameloft released a mobile game based on the series. &quot;The inspiration for Gameloft&#x27;s take on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; comes from the most unlikely place, too—the original Mario Party on the Nintendo 64.&quot;

In 2007, British company Re:creation published &quot;Desperate Housewives Dirty Laundry Game&quot;, a board game based on the third season of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;.

===Soundtrack and literature===

In September 2005, Hollywood Records released a soundtrack album distributed by Universal Music Group, &quot;Music from and Inspired by Desperate Housewives&quot;, featuring music inspired by the series, as well as sound clips taken from the first season of the series. The songs included have been described as promoting &quot;girl power&quot;, and among the artists appearing—all being female—were LeAnn Rimes, Gloria Estefan and Shania Twain. Controversially, no music composed for the series was included on the album.

Two books have been officially released within the &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; franchise. In September 2005, ABC&#x27;s sister company Hyperion Books released &quot;Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors&quot; (), a companion to the first season of the series, written by the production team behind the series. One year later, in October 2006, Hyperion published &quot;The Desperate Housewives Cookbook – Juicy Dishes and Saucy Bits&quot; (). In addition, official wall calendars, featuring shots taken from the series, were published by Andrews McMeel Publishing for 2006, 2007 and 2008.

Four unauthorized books written from different points of view were released in 2006. &quot;Delicious Housewives, A Novel of Erotica&quot;, by author Tamarias Tyree (), from RSVP Press, is an erotic parody of the series featuring the housewives&#x27; sexual misadventures which eventually lead them to an appearance on the &quot;Jerry Springer Show&quot;.

&quot;Reading &#x27;Desperate Housewives&#x27;: Beyond the White Picket Fence&quot; (), from I.B. Tauris, is an academic look at the show by film studies lecturers Janet McCabe and Kim Akass. &quot;Welcome to Wisteria Lane: On America&#x27;s Favorite Desperate Housewives&quot; (), published by BenBella Books, consists of seventeen essays written from a feminist perspective.

===Fashion dolls and fragrances===
In December 2006, it was announced that the characters of Susan, Lynette, Bree, Gabrielle and Edie were to be made into tall fashion dolls, produced by Madame Alexander. In 2007, they were released in a limited edition of 300 pieces each. A fragrance was also launched by Coty Inc. in 2006, titled &quot;Forbidden Fruit&quot;, and was composed of orange blossom, peach, apple, lily, wisteria, jasmine, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla and cedar. In August 2009, a collection of four fragrances by LR Health &amp; Beauty Systems, each based on and titled after a &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; lead character, was presented: Susan&#x27;s fragrance is composed of orange blossom, cedar, sandalwood and white musk, Lynette&#x27;s fragrance is composed of cardamom, star jasmine and musk, Bree&#x27;s fragrance is composed of green apple, white jasmine, raspberry, lily, amber and vanilla, and Gabrielle&#x27;s fragrance is composed of raspberry, pineapple, rose, patchouli and blackberries.

===&quot;Another Desperate Housewife&quot; commercials===
In conjunction with season six, Marc Cherry was commissioned to write eight &quot;mini-episodes&quot; entitled &quot;Another Desperate Housewife&quot;. The episodes were written after the previous season&#x27;s extensive product placement proved unpopular with the fans. The mini-episodes were written to advertise mobile phone company Sprint and involve just three characters. The two main characters are Stephanie (played by Rebecca Staab) and Lance (played by David Chisum) who have moved into the former house of Edie Britt after her death. The third character, Elsa, was Stephanie&#x27;s friend. It is eventually revealed that Lance and Elsa have been having an affair. Stephanie finds out and tells Lance to break it off. Elsa suggests killing Stephanie, but Lance gets a text message indicating he&#x27;s seeing another woman and a furious Elsa shoots him. In truth, Stephanie had sent the message herself. The final mini-episode has Elsa being arrested and Stephanie attracted to a handsome policeman at the scene. Each episode ends with a Mary Alice-like narration saying things such as &quot;This is suspicion on the Now Network&quot; or &quot;This is betrayal on the Now Network.&quot;

===Ask &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;===
For the sixth season of the series, ABC created &quot;Ask &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;&quot; to promote their website. It was presented and sponsored by Sprint, and it was hosted by series creator, Marc Cherry. In each special, Marc Cherry and an actress/actor of the series would answer questions that fans submitted to abc.go.com.

==Adaptations==
On February 26, 2006, The Walt Disney Company announced that four South American versions of the show were about to begin production: one for Argentina, one for Colombia, one for Ecuador and one for Brazil. Later on, the Colombian and Ecuadorean productions merged, leaving three Latin American shows. The Argentine version, titled &quot;Amas de Casa Desesperadas&quot;, began being broadcast in 2006. The first year proved successful enough for a second season to begin production. The first season of the version for Colombia (RCN TV) and Ecuador (Teleamazonas), also titled &quot;Amas de Casa Desesperadas&quot;, began being broadcast in Ecuador in May 2007, and was broadcast five days a week. In addition, &quot;Donas de Casa Desesperadas&quot; began being broadcast on RedeTV! in 2008. The Turkish version titled &quot;Umutsuz Ev Kadınları&quot; aired on Kanal D in Turkey from 2011 until 2013 and on FOX Turkey from 2013 until 2014. In fall 2013, the Disney Media Distribution and the Nigerian television network EbonyLife TV announced that they were producing an African version of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. The series, titled &quot;Desperate Housewives Africa&quot;, was scheduled to premiere in summer 2014 on EbonyLife TV. However, it aired its only season during 2015.

<text>He Shoots, He Scores () is a Canadian &quot;téléroman&quot;, or television drama series, revolving around a fictional ice hockey team based in Quebec City. The series aired from 1986 to 1989 on the Radio-Canada network, and revival series on TQS in 2001 and on TVA from 2004 to 2015.

The first season was filmed in both French and English, the English version appearing on CBC Television as &quot;He Shoots, He Scores&quot;. It was the first television series to air simultaneously in English on CBC and in French on Radio-Canada. (An earlier series, &quot;La famille Plouffe&quot;, had aired on both networks, but not simultaneously; the English version aired approximately a year behind the French series. Each episode of &quot;Lance et Compte&quot;, however, aired in English as &quot;He Shoots, He Scores&quot; in the same &quot;week&quot;.)

The series was scripted by Réjean Tremblay and Louis Caron for the first season, and by Tremblay and Jacques Jacob after that. Following the end of the regular series, a number of television movies continued to air into the 1990s. A new generation of the series started to air in 2001 and a movie was made in 2010.

==Synopsis==

The series was written by Réjean Tremblay and novelist Louis Caron for the first season (later replaced by Jacques Jacob), and tells the story of the fictional National Hockey League team Le National from Quebec City, and its players. The main protagonist is Pierre Lambert (Carl Marotte), the young, handsome player drafted by Le National from the Trois-Rivières Dragons junior team.

In the first series, Pierre Lambert is selected to play for Le National de Québec, his boyhood team, along with his best friend Denis Mercure (Jean Harvey). During that year, Pierre learns how to control himself at the pro level and how to deal with hockey and his love life.

The second series is focused on the World Cup of Hockey. Pierre Lambert is selected to play for Team Canada but personal issues cause him to play poorly. Pierre has to deal with those issues in time to help Canada win the World Cup. The theme of Soviet hockey players wanting to flee their country and play in North America is also included in the series.

In the third installment of the series, with Le National de Québec dealing with big financial difficulties and with an injury-plagued Pierre Lambert, the future in Quebec is in doubt. Pierre Lambert and his friends will have to start winning and find a way to keep Le National in Quebec.

==Background==
&quot;Lance et Compte&quot; is a common Quebec French hockey expression, equivalent to the English &quot;He shoots, he scores&quot; (the latter was originally one of the catchphrases of hockey commentator Foster Hewitt). The team Le National is a direct copy of the real-life Nordiques, up to the logo (the Nordiques have the lower case letter &quot;N&quot; as symbol; the National has a capital &quot;N&quot;). The Dragons are themselves a copy of the Trois-Rivières Draveurs from the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. Copies of real organizations are common in Québécois téléromans. Examples: &quot;La Presse&quot; newspaper is &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; in the episode &quot;Scoop&quot; and the &quot;Sûreté du Québec&quot; police force is the &quot;Sûreté nationale&quot; in &quot;Jasmine&quot;. However in the TV movies that aired immediately following the original series, the real junior team names are used including the Trois-Rivières Draveurs and the Shawinigan Cataractes. The show also became known was known for its occasional somewhat risqué love scenes.

==Incarnations==
In addition to its English airing in Canada, the show was adapted in France as &quot;Cogne et gagne&quot;, with France French dubbing. A well known incarnation of &quot;Lance et Compte&quot; is the series of parody sketches of Rock et Belles Oreilles dubbed &quot;Snappe pis Bourdonne&quot;.

Several TV movies have been made in the franchise and were shown on TVA from 1991 to 1992.
# &quot;Tous pour un&quot;
# &quot;Le Crime de Lulu&quot;
# &quot;Le Moment de vérité&quot;
# &quot;Le Choix&quot;
# &quot;Envers et contre tous&quot;
# &quot;Le Retour du chat&quot;

A new generation of the original series started to air in 2001 with a new breed of players (and presence of the original characters) and aired on TQS. Since 2004, three more series have been aired on TVA and a fourth is currently under production also to be aired on TVA.

&quot;Lance et Compte: La Nouvelle Génération&quot; focuses on a new star named Danny Bouchard. Pierre Lambert is now retired and the agent of Bouchard. Le National de Québec have been playing very poorly for years now and if the team continues losing they might yet again be threatened to move out of the city. With the help of the new coaches, Le National have to find a way to win and fast.

&quot;La Reconquête&quot; focuses on the love life of Danny Bouchard and Marc Gagnon. Bouchard is rapidly turned into a man he is not by his new mistress Valérie Nantel and could result in a dramatic ending. Marc Gagnon also has to find a way to deal with his emotions as he still has feelings for his ex, Suzie Lambert.

&quot;In Lance et Compte: La Revanche&quot;, Pierre Lambert&#x27;s son, Guy, is called up by Le National de Québec in the middle of the season. In his first game, he injures and kills a player from the Montreal Canadiens with a body check into the boards. The series primarily focuses on his trial and his love life but also on the revenge of Annie Girard, Danny Bouchard&#x27;s widow, towards his mistress Valerie Nantel. The theme of steroids in sports has also been included in this installment.

&quot;Le Grand Duel&quot;, the show&#x27;s seventh season aired on TVA in Fall 2009, it focuses on the rivalry between Montreal and Quebec City it also includes Suzie Lambert&#x27;s battle with breast cancer. The theme of child sexual abuse in minor hockey is also included in the series.

A movie called &quot;Lance et Compe: Le Film&quot; (&quot;Lance et Compte: The Movie&quot;) hit the theaters on November 26, 2010. It focused on the crash of the team bus between Roberval and Quebec City. At least half the team and coaches died from the crash.

The 8th season titled &quot;Lance et Compte: La Déchirure&quot; is a direct follow up to the movie.

The 9th and final season titled &quot;Lance et Compte: La Finale&quot;, starring Jason Roy Léveillée and Sarah Dagenais-Hakim as part of a new generation, was broadcast in 2015.

==History==
Akumi County was formerly part of Dewa Province, and was mentioned in the Engishiki records of the early Heian period. The area came to be known as Yuza District from the Sengoku period through the Edo period. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, much of the area was ruled as part of Tsuruoka Domain or its subsidiary domain, Matsumine Domain. Following the Meiji restoration it came under the new province of Uzen Province, which became part of Yamagata Prefecture in 1876. At that time, the area consisted of two towns and 154 villages. The area became and was organized as Akumi District in 1878. 


With the establishment of the municipality system on April 1, 1889, two towns (Sakata and Matsumine) and 27 villages were established. akata was raised to city status on April 1, 1933, and Yura was raised to town status on April 1, 1941. The town of Yawata was created on December 1, 1954, and Hirata was elevated to town status on August 1, 1964. On November 1, 2005, as part of the Heisei period Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan, the city of Sakata and the towns of Hirata, Matsuyama and Yawata merged to form the new city of Sakata.

The Flathead Reservation is home to the Kootenai and Pend d&#x27;Oreilles tribes also. Bitterroot Salish or Flathead originally lived in an area west of Billings, Montana extending to the continental divide in the west and south of Great Falls, Montana extending to the Montana–Wyoming border. From there they later moved west into the Bitterroot Valley. By request, a Catholic mission was built here in 1841. In 1891 they were forcibly moved to the Flathead Reservation.

==Alternative names==

The Bitterroot Salish are known by various names including Salish, Selish, and Flathead. The name &quot;Flathead&quot; was a term used to identify any Native tribes who had practiced head flattening. The Salish, however, deny that their ancestors engaged in this practice. Instead, they believe that this name caught on because of the sign language which was used to identify their people: Pressing both sides of the head with your hands which meant &quot;we the people&quot;.

==Language==

The people are an Interior Salish-speaking group of Native Americans. Their language is also called Salish, and is the namesake of the entire Salishan languages group. The Spokane language (npoqínišcn) spoken by the Spokane people, the Kalispel language (qlispé) spoken by the Pend d&#x27;Oreilles tribe and the Bitterroot Salish (séliš) languages are all dialects of the same language. According to Salish history, the Salish speaking people originally lived as one large nation thousands of years ago. Tribal elders say that the tribes started to break into smaller groups as the population became too big to sustain its needs in just one central location. Centuries afterward, the Salish languages had branched into different dialects from various regions the tribes dispersed to. These regions stretched from Montana all the way to the Pacific Coast. Centuries following the dispersion, the separated groups of Salishan peoples became increasingly distinct which resulted in variations on the language. The Salish language had developed into sub-families with unique languages as well as their own unique dialects. The eastern sub-family is known as Interior Salish. The three dialects within Interior Salish are Flathead (Séliš), Kalispell (Qlispé) and Spokane.

==History==

===Origins===

The tribes&#x27; oral history tells of having been placed in their Indigenous homelands, which is now present-day Montana, from when Coyote killed the nałisqelixw, which literally translates into people-eaters.

Within many of the Coyote stories, there are vivid descriptions relating to the history of the geological events that had occurred near the last ice age. Stories that include &quot;the extension of glaciers down what is now Flathead Lake, the flooding of western Montana beneath a great lake, the final retreat of the bitter cold weather as the ice age came to an end, the disappearance of large animals like giant beaver and their replacement by the present-day smaller versions of those creatures&quot;. Archaeologists have been able to document a continuous occupancy within some sites as far back as 12,600 years ago during the final retreat of the glaciers. Some stories suggest that occupancy can go far back as 40,000 years when the ice age had already begun.

===Bitterroot Valley===

The Bitterroot Salish began to occupy the Bitterroot Valley in the 1700s when pressure from westward-moving Plains tribes pushed them off the plains. About the same time, smallpox swept through the tribe, causing a population decline. The people adapted, practicing a seasonal round and traveling across the continental divide once or twice each year to hunt buffalo. They sought alliances with tribes to the west in order to strengthen their defense against Plains tribes like the Blackfeet.

====St. Mary&#x27;s Mission====

Sometime before Lewis and Clark reached the Bitterroot in 1805, Xalíqs (Shining Shirt), a Salish prophet, foretold that fair-skinned men dressed in black robes would arrive in the valley to teach the people new morals and a new way to pray. These men, who wore crosses and did not take wives, would bring peace, but their coming would be the beginning of the end of all native people. By the 1830s, Jesuit-educated Iroquois trappers had settled in the Bitterroot and told the Salish about the &quot;powerful medicine&quot; of Catholicism. Remembering Xalíqs&#x27;s prophecy, the Salish sent delegations in 1831, 1835, 1837, and 1839 to St. Louis asking for Black Robes to come to the valley. The 1839 delegation convinced Father Pierre-Jean DeSmet, S.J., to visit Salish territory.

In the summer of 1840, 1,600 Salish and Pend d&#x27;Oreilles met DeSmet at Pierre&#x27;s Hole. About 350 chose to be baptized, including several leaders: Tjolzhitsay (Big Face), Walking Bear, and Victor ( Xweɫxƛ̣ ̓cín or Many Horses). DeSmet traveled back east to get funding for a mission, returning to the Bitterroot in September 1841 with five more Jesuit priests. They established St. Mary&#x27;s Mission. Many Salish people chose to adopt elements of Catholicism that were complementary to their own beliefs, including ideas of &quot;generosity, community, obedience, and respect for family.&quot; The Salish also found power in Catholic &quot;chant, prayer, and devotional hymns; a sacred calendar associated with sacred colors; the veneration of sacramental objects and sacred sites; water used for purification&quot;; and other practices. The Salish did not embrace all Catholic teachings, however. They rejected the doctrines of hell and sin. And, when the priests sought to teach them agriculture, most chose to continue their seasonal round. The Jesuits tried to stamp out Salish traditions that contradicted Catholic teachings; they gathered the medicine men and insisted they throw away their sacred bundles into a hole near the church. Much of the generational knowledge of the medicine men was lost due to Jesuit interference.

====Hellgate Treaty====

In 1855, Isaac Stevens, the Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Washington Territory, invited Victor (Xweɫxƛ̣ ̓cín), head chief of the Bitterroot Salish; Tmɫxƛ̣ ̓cín (No Horses or Alexander), head chief of the Pend d&#x27;Oreilles; and Michelle, head chief of the Kootenais to a council in present-day Missoula, Montana. The tribal leaders were told that Stevens wanted to talk about a peace treaty; however, the chiefs and headmen were surprised and angered to discover Stevens&#x27;s primary purpose was to discuss cession of Indian lands. Similar to other negotiations with Plateau tribes, Stevens&#x27;s goal was to concentrate numerous tribes within a single reservation, thereby making way for white settlement on as much land as possible. Stevens attempted to convince the chiefs to sign the Hellgate treaty, relinquishing their territories in exchange for $120,000. The treaty provided for the Flathead Indian Reservation in the lower Flathead River Valley, where the tribes would be moved.

When Xweɫxƛ̣ ̓cín (Victor) refused to relinquish the Bitterroot Valley, Stevens inserted Article 11 into the agreement. This article designated approximately 1.7 million acres in the Bitterroot as a provisional reservation. According to the terms, the valley would be surveyed, after which the president would determine whether the Bitterroot reservation or the Flathead reservation would be &quot;better adapted to the wants of the Flathead tribe.&quot; In the meantime, the U.S. government was to keep white settlers out of the Bitterroot Valley. Father Adrian Hoecken, S.J., who observed the council proceedings, wrote, &quot;What a ridiculous tragi-comedy the whole council proved. It would take too long to write it all down—ah well! Not a tenth of it was actually understood by either party, for Ben Kyser [the translator] speaks Flathead very badly and is no better at translating into English.&quot;

The question of a Bitterroot reservation was left in limbo when Congress failed to ratify the treaty until 1859. In the meantime, Stevens ordered only a cursory survey of the valley, instructing R. H. Lansdale to ride around the two proposed reservations. Stevens instructed Lansdale, &quot;weight must be given to the fact that a large number of Indians prefer the Flathead River reservation.&quot; After riding around the valleys, Lansdale obediently reported, &quot;the northern district is preferable.&quot; Distracted by the Civil War, the U.S. government delayed to settle the Bitterroot question. In the meantime, it failed to uphold its promise to keep settlers out of the valley.

====Garfield Treaty====

After the death of Victor (Xweɫxƛ̣ ̓cín) in 1870, his son Charlo (Sɫm̓xẹ Q̓woxq̣eys, Claw of the Small Grizzly Bear) was chosen as the next chief. White settlers and Montana&#x27;s territorial delegate saw this transition of leadership as an opportunity to force the Salish onto the Flathead reservation. In 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant issued an executive order to remove the Salish from the Bitterroot. In 1872, Congressman James A. Garfield arrived to negotiate the removal. When Charlo refused to leave the valley, Garfield assumed the Salish would change their mind and proceeded &quot;with the work in the same manner as though Charlo [Xweɫxƛ̣ ̓cín], first chief, had signed the contract.&quot; Although the original field copy of the agreement, which remains in the National Archives, has no &quot;x&quot; besides Charlo&#x27;s name, the official copies that Congress had voted on had an &quot;x&quot; by his name. This only enraged the tribe and strengthened their resolve to not leave the Bitterroot Valley, despite declining conditions. In order to secure a signature on the agreement, government officials recognized Arlee as chief. Arlee led a small group of Salish to the Flathead in 1873. Most of the people stayed in the Bitterroot with Charlo, and some received &quot;permanently inalienable&quot; patents to farms in the valley. The government viewed them as U.S. citizens who had severed tribal relations, but the people still saw themselves as an independent tribal community.

====Removal====

The Bitterroot Salish continued to practice their seasonal round in the Bitterroot Valley as long as possible. The devastation of the buffalo herds in the 1870s and 1880s forced them to turn to farming and ranching. They had some success with agriculture until an unprecedented drought in 1889. With food scarce, the people suffered and finally began to consider the U.S. government&#x27;s offer of land on the Flathead Reservation.

In October 1889, retired general Henry B. Carrington arrived in the Bitterroot to negotiate with the Salish and convince them to move to the Flathead once and for all. Carrington tried to gain Charlo&#x27;s trust, first with gifts, then by bringing out the original 1872 Garfield agreement to address Charlo&#x27;s claim that he never signed it. He also made many promises to the people: they would get to pick out good farms on the Flathead reservation, they would receive assistance with plowing and fencing their new farms, every family with children would get a cow, and they would receive rations until the move or until they received money from the sale of their Bitterroot lands. At first, the Salish rejected Carrington&#x27;s offers and refused to sign the agreement. They asked for the &quot;literal execution&quot; of the Hellgate treaty, but Carrington did not acknowledge their request.

Finally, Charlot signed Carrington&#x27;s agreement on November 3, 1889. The Salish were forced to accept removal to the Flathead, making the painful decision to give up their homeland in order to preserve their people and culture. They left the valley on October 15, 1891. Charlot organized the march himself and insisted that it take place without a white military escort. However, Salish oral histories and newspaper accounts indicate that troops were present during the removal. Elders later remembered the three-day, sixty-mile journey as a funeral march. Some historians have nicknamed this event Montana&#x27;s Trail of Tears or the Salish Trail of Tears.

===Flathead Indian Reservation===

During and after the removal to the Flathead, the Salish had to contend with broken government promises. They received insufficient rations. They never received the promised assistance with plowing and fencing or the promised cows. In 1910, the Flathead reservation was opened to white homesteaders through the efforts of Congressman Joseph M. Dixon. The Bitterroot Salish weathered all of these attacks and created a community on the reservation.

In the 1920s, the tribes on the Flathead reservation forced the U.S. government to recognize their ownership interest in the Kerr Dam, or Seli’š Ksanka Qlispe’ Dam. The Salish joined the other tribes on the reservation to create the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT). In 1953, when the U.S. government targeted the tribes for termination, the CSKT cultivated support from Montana politicians and successfully defended against the attack. In the later half of the twentieth century, Salish people completed academic degrees and expanded their political influence. At the same time in the 80s, Agnes Vanderburg established an annual camp to teach traditional skills to the next generation. Tribal management of the bison at the National Bison Range was restored through legislative approval in 2020 and executive approval from Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland under the Biden administration in 2021. Today, the Salish continue their efforts to preserve the tribe and to protect their interests.

<doc id="884637" wikidata="Q1550384" url="?curid=884637" title="Kutenai">
<text>The Kutenai ( ), also known as the Ktunaxa ( ; ), Ksanka ( ), Kootenay (in Canada) and Kootenai (in the United States), are an indigenous people of Canada and the United States. Kutenai bands live in southeastern British Columbia, northern Idaho, and western Montana. The Kutenai language is a language isolate, thus unrelated to the languages of neighboring peoples or any other known language.

Four bands form Ktunaxa Nation in British Columbia. The Ktunaxa Nation was historically closely associated with the Shuswap Indian Band through tribal association and intermarriage. Two federally recognized tribes represent Kutenai people in the U.S.: the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) in Montana, a confederation also including Bitterroot Salish and Pend d&#x27;Oreilles bands.

==Kootenay==
Around 40 variants of the name &quot;Kutenai&quot; have been attested since 1820; two others are also in current use. &quot;Kootenay&quot; is the common spelling in British Columbia, including in the name of the Lower Kootenay First Nation. &quot;Kootenai&quot; is used in Montana and Idaho, including in the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. These two spellings have been used for various placenames on their respective sides of the Canadian-U.S. border, notably the Kootenay River, called the Kootenai River in the United States. &quot;Kutenai&quot; is the common form in the literature about the people, and has been adopted by Kutenai in both countries as an international spelling when discussing the people as a whole. The name evidently derives from the Blackfoot word for the people, &quot;Kotonáwa&quot;, which itself may derive from the Kutenai term &quot;Ktunaxa&quot;. This is supported by an interview with Vernon Finley, previous tribal chairman of the CSKT. He supposes the term to be &quot;given... by some other tribe&quot; and that it was likely &quot;a mispronunciation of whatever that word is,&quot; since &#x27;Kootenai&#x27; holds no meaning in any neighboring language.

In the Kutenai language, &quot;Ktunaxa&quot; is considered the most correct general term for the culture and peoples. Differing etymologies have been suggested, tying the name to the verb for &quot;eating food plain, [meaning] without seasoning,&quot; or alternately to the verb for &quot;licking up blood.&quot; In the same interview referenced above, Finley attests the latter meaning to the image of a Ktunaxa warrior shooting an enemy, drawing out the arrow, and licking the blood from the arrowhead. He also says that, historically, people identified themselves primarily with the name of their band and less so with the broad term Ktunaxa.

It has been attested that some Columbian Plateau groups may have called themselves &quot;Upnuckanick.&quot; &quot;Ksanka&quot;, meaning &quot;people of the standing arrow&quot; is the name of the southeastern-most of the seven bands, who are today primarily associated with what is now northwestern Montana, and are politically organized within the CSKT.

== Communities ==
Four Kutenai bands live in southeastern British Columbia, one lives in northern Idaho, and one lives in northwestern Montana:
;Canada - British Columbia:
*The Ktunaxa Nation Council (KNC) (until 2005 the Ktunaxa/Kinbasket Tribal Council) includes the four Canadian bands:
**Akisqnuk First Nation (&quot;place of two lakes&quot;; also known as the Columbia Lake Indian Band). An Upper Kutenai group, they are headquartered in Akisqnuk, south of Windermere. Reserves include: Columbia Lake #3, St. Mary&#x27;s #1A, ca. 33 km2, population: 264)
** Lower Kootenay Band, (Yaqan Nukiy or Lower Kootenay First Nation). A Lower Kutenai group, they are headquartered in Creston, on the most populous reserve Creston #1 along the Kootenay River, ca. 6 km north of the US-Canada border. Reserves include: Creston #1, Lower Kootenay #1A, #1B, #1C, #2, #3, #5, #4, St. Mary&#x27;s #1A, ca. 26 km2, population: 214)
** St. Mary&#x27;s First Nation (ʔaq̓am or ʔaq̓amniʔk, &quot;deep dense woods&quot;). An Upper Kutenai group, they live along the St. Mary&#x27;s River near Cranbrook. Tribal headquarters are located on the most populous reserve, &quot;Kootenay #1&quot;; reserves include: Bummers Flat #6, Cassimayooks (Mayook) #5, Isidore&#x27;s Ranch #4, Kootenay #1, St. Mary&#x27;s #1A, ca. 79 km2, population: 357)
** Tobacco Plains Indian Band (Tobacco Plains First Nation, ʔa·kanuxunik, &quot;Akan&#x27;kunik&quot;, or &quot;ʔakink̓umⱡasnuqⱡiʔit&quot; - &#x27;People of the place of the flying head&#x27;. An Upper Kutenai band, they live near Grasmere on the east shore of the Lake Koocanusa below the mouth of Elk River, ca. 15 km north of the British Columbia-Montana border. Reserves include: St. Mary&#x27;s #1A, Tobacco Plains #2, ca. 44 km2, population: 165)

Additionally, the Shuswap Indian Band were formerly part of the Ktunaxa Nation. They are a Secwepemc (Shuswap) band who settled in Kutenai territory in the mid-19th century. They were eventually incorporated into the group and intermarried with them, and spoke the Kutenai language. They departed the Ktunaxa nation in 2004 and are now part of the Shuswap Nation Tribal Council. They are located near Invermere, just northeast of Windermere Lake; their reserves include: St. Mary&#x27;s #1A, Shuswap IR, ca. 12 km2, population: 244).

;United States - Idaho:
* Kootenai Tribe of Idaho (&quot;ʔaq̓anqmi&quot; or &quot;ʔa·kaq̓ⱡahaⱡxu&quot;, also called Idaho Ksanka). A Lower Kutenai group, they govern the Kootenai Indian Reservation in Boundary County. Their population is 75.

;United States - Montana:
* Kootenai (&quot;K̓upawiȼq̓nuk&quot; or &quot;Ksanka&quot;) are members of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, along with Bitterroot Salish and Pend d&#x27;Oreilles bands. An Upper Kutenai group, they live mostly on the Flathead Reservation in western Montana. A total population of about 6,800 live on the reservation, while 3,700 live outside the reservation nearby.

== History ==

The Kutenai today live in southeastern British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana. They are loosely divided into two groups: the Upper Kutenai and the Lower Kutenai, referring to the different sections of the Kootenay River (spelled &quot;Kootenai&quot; in the U.S.) where the bands live. The Upper Kutenai are the Akisqnuk First Nation (Columbia Lake Band), the St. Mary&#x27;s Band, and the Tobacco Plains Indian Band in British Columbia, as well as the Montana Kootenai. The Lower Kutenai are the Lower Kootenay First Nation of British Columbia and the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho.

=== Origins ===

Scholars have numerous ideas about the origins of the Ktunaxa. One theory is that they originally lived on the prairies, and were driven across the Rockies by the competing Blackfoot people or by famine and disease. Some Upper Kootenay participated in a Plains Native lifestyle for part of the year, crossing the Rockies to the east for the bison hunt. They were relatively well known to the Blackfoot, and sometimes their relations with them were in the form of violent confrontation over food competition.

Some Ktunaxa remained on or returned to the prairies year-round; they had a settlement near Fort Macleod, Alberta. This group of Ktunaxa suffered high mortality rates, partly because of the depredations of the Blackfoot, and partly because of smallpox epidemics. With numbers sharply reduced, these Plains Ktunaxa returned to the Kootenay region of British Columbia.

Some of the Ktunaxa say that their ancestors came originally from the Great Lakes region of Michigan. To date, scholars have not found either archeological or historic evidence to support this account.

The Ktunaxa territory in British Columbia has archeological sites with some of the oldest human-made artifacts in Canada, dated to 11,500 before the present (BP). It has not been proven whether these artifacts were left by ancestors of the Ktunaxa or by another, possibly Salishan, group. Human occupation of the Kootenay Rockies has been demonstrated by dated sites with evidence of quarrying and flint-knapping, especially of quartzite and tourmaline. This oldest assemblage of artifacts is known as the Goatfell Complex, named after the Goatfell region about 40 km east of Creston, British Columbia on Highway 3. These artifacts have been found at quarries in Goatfell, Harvey Mountain, Idaho, Negro Lake and Kiakho Lake (both near Lumberton and Cranbrook), North Star Mountain just west of Creston on Highway 3, and at Blue Ridge. All these sites are within 50 km of Creston, with the exception of Blue Ridge, which is near the village of Kaslo, quite a distance north on the west side of Kootenay Lake.

Archaeologist Dr. Wayne Choquette believes that the artifacts represented in the Goatfell Complex, dated from 11,500 BP up to the early historical period, show that there has been no break in the archaeological record. In addition, he says that it appears that the technology was local. No evidence supports the conjecture that the region&#x27;s first inhabitants emigrated from this area, nor that they were replaced or succeeded by a different people. Choquette concludes that the Ktunaxa today are the descendants of those first people to inhabit the land.

Other scholars, such as Reg Ashwell, suggest that the Ktunaxa moved to the British Columbia region in the early half of the 18th century, having been harassed and pushed there from East of the Rockies by the Blackfoot. He notes that their language is isolated from that of Salish tribes common to the Pacific Coast. In addition, their traditional dress, many of their customs (such as their use of teepee-style portable dwellings), and their traditional religion have more in common with Plains peoples than with the Coastal Salish.

The Goatfell assemblage of artifacts suggests that prior to 11,500 BP, the people who came to inhabit the Kootenay mountains may have lived in what is now the southwestern United States, during a period when British Columbia was beneath the Cordilleran ice sheet of the last ice age. The Goatfell Complex, and specifically the techniques of manufacture of the tools and points, are part of a tradition of knapping that existed in the North American Great Basin and the intermontane west of the continent in the late Pleistocene. The prevailing theory is that as the glaciers retreated, people moved northward, following the revival of the flora and fauna to the north.

From the time of the first Ktunaxa settlement in the Kootenays, until the historical period beginning in the late 18th century, there is little known of the people&#x27;s social, political, and intellectual development. Stone tool technologies changed and became more complex and differentiated. They were probably big game hunters in their earliest prehistoric phase. The Ktunaxa were first noted in the historical record when mentioned on Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s map, circa 1793.

As temperatures continued to warm, the glacial lakes drained and fish found habitat in the warmer waters. The Lower Kootenay across the Pacific Northwest made fishing a fundamental part of their diet and culture, while maintaining the old traditions of game hunting.

=== Early history ===
Anthropological and ethnographic interest in the Ktunaxa were recorded from the mid-19th century. What these European and North American scholars recorded has to be viewed with a critical eye, since they did not have the theoretical sophistication expected of anthropologists today. They imputed much of their own cultural values into what they were able to observe among the Ktunaxa. But their accounts are the most detailed descriptions of Ktunaxa lifestyles at a time when Aboriginal lifeways all over the world were dramatically changing in the face of settlement by Europeans and European Americans.

The earliest ethnographies detail Ktunaxa culture around the turn of the 20th century. Europeans observed the Ktunaxa enjoying a stable economic life and rich social life, based on a detailed ritual calendar. Their economic life focused on fishing, using fish traps and hooks, and travelling on the waterways in the sturgeon-nosed canoe. They had seasonal and sometimes ritual hunts for bear, deer, caribou, gophers, geese, and the many other fowl in Lower Kootenay country. As mentioned above, the Upper Kootenay often crossed the Rockies to participate in the bison hunt. The Lower Kootenay, however, did not participate in communal bison hunts; these were not important to their economy or culture.

The Ktunaxa conducted vision quests, particularly by a young man in a passage to adulthood. They used tobacco ritually. They practiced a Sun Dance and Grizzly Bear Dance, a midwinter festival, a Blue Jay Dance, and other social and ceremonial activities. The men belonged to different societies or lodges, such as the Crazy Dog Society, the Crazy Owl Society, and the Shamans&#x27; Society. These groups took on certain responsibilities, and membership in a lodge came with obligations in battle, hunting, and community service.

The Ktunaxa and their neighbors the Sinixt both used the sturgeon-nosed canoe. This water craft was first described in 1899 as having some similarity to canoes used in the Amur region of Asia. At the time, some scholars believed in a theory of dispersal, concluding that similarities of artifacts or symbols among cultures represented that a superior culture had transmitted its elements to another culture. Since then, however, most scholars have concluded that many such innovations arose independently among different cultures.

Harry Holbert Turney-High, the first to write an extensive ethnography of the Ktunaxa (focusing on bands in the United States), records a detailed description of the harvesting of bark to make this canoe (67):

A tree ... growing rather high in the mountains is sought. Finding one of the desired size and quality, a man climbed it to the proper height and cut a ring around the bark with his elk-horn chisel or flint knife. In the meantime a helper cut out another ring at the base of the tree. This done, an incision was made down the length of the trunk connecting the two rings. This cut had to be as straight and accurate as possible. A stick of about two inches in diameter was used carefully to pry the bark from the tree. The bark was wrapped up so that it would not dry out on the way to camp. The inside, or tree-side of the bark sheet, became the outside of the canoe, while the outside surface became the inside of the boat. The bark was considered ready for immediate use. There was no scraping or seasoning, nor was it decorated in any way.

Christian missionaries traveled to the Ktunaxa territories and worked to convert the peoples, keeping extensive written records of the process and of their observations of the culture. As a result of their accounts, there is more information about the missionary process than about other aspects of Ktunaxa history at the turn of the 20th century.

The Ktunaxa had been exposed to Christianity as early as the 18th century, when a Lower Kootenay prophet from Flathead Lake in Montana by the name of Shining Shirt spread news of the coming of the &#x27;Blackrobes&#x27; (French Jesuit missionaries) (Cocolla 20). Ktunaxa people also encountered Christian Iroquois sent west by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. By the 1830s the Ktunaxa had begun to adopt certain Christian elements in a syncretic blend of ceremonies. They were influenced less by European missionaries than through their contact with Christian Natives from other parts of Canada and the United States.

Father Pierre-Jean de Smet in 1845-6 was the first missionary to tour the region. He intended to establish missions to minister to Native peoples, and assessing the success and needs of those already established. The Catholic Jesuits had made it a priority to minister to these newly discovered peoples in the New World. While there was missionary activity in Eastern North America for 200 years, the Ktunaxa were not the objects of the church&#x27;s attentions until the mid-late 19th century. Following De Smet, a Jesuit named Philippo Canestrelli lived among the Ksanka people of Montana in the 1880s and 90s. He wrote a much celebrated grammar of their language, published in 1896. The first missionary to take up a permanent post in the Yaqan Nu&#x27;kiy territory, i.e. the Creston Band of Lower Kootenay, was Father Nicolas Coccola, who arrived in the Creston area in 1880. His memoirs, corroborated by newspaper reports and Ktunaxa oral histories, are the basis for the early 20th-century history of the Ktunaxa.

In the first stages of Ktunaxa-European contact, mainly the result of a gold rush that began in earnest in 1863 with the discovery of gold in Wild Horse Creek, the Ktunaxa were little interested in European-driven economic activities. Traders worked to recruit them to trap in support of the fur trade, but few Lower Kootenay found this worthwhile. The Lower Kootenay region is, as mentioned above, remarkably rich in fish, birds, and large game. As the economic life of the Yaqan Nu&#x27;kiy was notably secure, they resisted new and unfamiliar economic activities.

Slowly though, the Yaqan Nu&#x27;kiy began participating in European-driven industries. They served as hunters and guides for the miners at the Bluebell silver-lead mine at Riondel. The richest gold mine ever discovered in the Kootenays was discovered by a Ktunaxa man named Pierre, and staked by him and Father Coccola in 1893.

=== 20th century ===

While there was sometimes conflict between the Yaqan Nu&#x27;kiy and the local settler community at Creston, their relations were more characterized by peaceful coexistence. Their conflicts tended to be over land use. In contrast, relations between the Lower Kootenay and the surrounding European society in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, deteriorated. 

By the turn of the 20th century, some Yaqan Nu&#x27;kiy were engaged in agricultural activities introduced by European settlers, but their approach to the land was different. An example of the type of conflict that repeatedly arose between European settlers and Native farmers is shown by a newspaper article in the &quot;Creston Review&quot; dated Friday, 9 August 1912:

A dispute over the rights to cut hay on the flat lands, between the Indians and the white men, which might have resulted in bloodshed, was settled Wednesday by W.F. Teetzel, government agent, of Nelson, who told both Indians and whites that if violence is done, no one would be allowed to cut hay on government land. ... The principal trouble this year occurred when some Indians threatened Frank Lewis and drove him from the hay he had already cut. The Indians claim they have cut land at this particular place for years while the old-time ranchers say that hay has never before been cut there. Mr. Lewis complained to Policeman Gunn who, as the definite of the Indian reservation is not known was at a loss what to do because no violence was committed whereby he could act. ... Mr. Teetzel arrived from Nelson Wednesday and in conference with Chief Alexander, got him to promise to see that Mr. Lewis got his hay, and warned him to keep the Indians from violence under penalty of losing the right of cutting hay on the flats. This warning he also gave to the white men. This is not the only one of the cases occurring this year. One farmer whose place is located near the reservation has been continually bothered by the Indians cutting his fences and turning their cattle in to graze on his property. 

The &quot;Creston Review,&quot; also reported on 21 June 1912: &quot;[Indian Agent Galbraith] says everything is in good condition and the majority of the Indians are at work picking berries for the ranchers who find their help useful and profitable.&quot;

These examples illustrate the dynamic of relations between two peoples: the Ktunaxa whose lands have been vastly reduced by the introduction of a reserve system, and the European settlers who are constantly looking to expand their access to the land (and later industries).

During the 20th century the Yaqan Nu&#x27;kiy gradually became involved in all the industries of the Creston valley: agriculture, forestry, mining, and later health care, education, and tourism. This process of integration separated the Yaqan Nu&#x27;kiy from their traditional lifeways, yet they have remained a very successful and self-confident community. They gradually gained more control and self-government, with less involvement from the Department of Indian or Aboriginal Affairs. Like most tribes in British Columbia, the Yaqan Nu&#x27;kiy did not have a treaty defining their rights regarding their territory. They have been working for decades on a careful and more or less cooperative treaty negotiation process with the government of Canada. The Creston Band of the Ktunaxa today has 113 individuals living on the reserve, and many others living off-reserve and working in various industries in Canada and the United States.

Feeling that they have lost some traditions that are very important to them, the Ktunaxa are working to revive their culture, and particularly to encourage language study. A total of 10 fluent speakers of Ktunaxa live in both the U.S. and Canada. The Yaqan Nu&#x27;kiy have developed a language curriculum for grades 4–6, and have been teaching it for four years, to develop a new generation of native speakers. They are involved in designing curriculum for grades 7–12, which requires meeting B.C. curriculum guidelines. Concurrent with this, they are recording oral stories and myths, as well as to videotaping the practice of their traditional crafts and technologies, with spoken directions.

==== &quot;Kootenai Nation War&quot; ====
On 20 September 1974, the Kootenai Tribe headed by Chairwoman Amy Trice declared war on the United States government. Their first act was to post tribal members on each end of U.S. Highway 95 that runs through the town of Bonners Ferry. They asked motorists to pay a toll to drive through the land that had been the tribe&#x27;s aboriginal land. (About 200 Idaho State Police were on hand to keep the peace and there were no incidents of violence.) They intended to use the toll money to house and care for elderly tribal members. Most tribes in the United States are forbidden to declare war on the U.S. government because of treaties, but the Kootenai Tribe never signed a treaty.

The United States government ultimately made a land grant of , the basis of what is now the Kootenai Reservation. In 1976 the tribe issued &quot;Kootenai Nation War Bonds&quot; that sold at $1.00 each. The bonds were dated 20 September 1974 and contained a brief declaration of war on the United States. These bonds were signed by Amelia Custack Trice, Tribal Chairwoman, and Douglas James Wheaton Sr., Tribal Representative. They were printed on heavy paper stock and were designed and signed by the western artist Emilie Touraine.

<text>The Pend d&#x27;Oreille or Pend d&#x27;Oreilles ( ), also known as the Kalispel (), are Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau. Today many of them live in Montana and eastern Washington of the United States. The Kalispel peoples referred to their primary tribal range as &quot;Kaniksu&quot;.

Their traditional territory comprised the drainage systems of the Flathead River, Clark Fork, and Pend Oreille rivers. It extended from roughly present-day Plains, Montana, westward along the Clark Fork River, to Lake Pend Oreille and Priest Lake in Idaho, and the Pend Oreille River (&quot;Ntxwe&quot;, meaning &quot;river&quot;) in eastern Washington and into British Columbia (Canada).

They lived in many bands — originally, probably eleven — in their historic lands. They are generally divided geographically and culturally in two groupings:

* the &quot;upstream people&quot; or Upper Kalispel (or &quot;Upper Pend d’Oreille&quot;) are commonly referred to as the Pend d&#x27;Oreille. They were also known as &quot;Kullyspelm&quot; or &quot;Ql̓ispé&quot; (&quot;Camas People&quot;). They are now enrolled in the federally recognized Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation in Montana.

and

* the &quot;downstream people&quot; or Lower Kalispel (or &quot;Lower Pend d’Oreille&quot;) are commonly referred to as the Kalispel. They were also known as &quot;Silkatkmlschi&quot; or &quot;Sɫq̓etkʷmsčin̓t&quot; (&quot;People Living along the Shore of the Broad Water&quot;), because they lived by Flathead Lake (Čɫq̓étkʷ - &quot;Broad Water&quot;). Today many are enrolled in the Kalispel Tribe of Indians in Washington. Some families are members of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe in Idaho.

In addition, some Kalispel are enrolled in the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation in eastern Washington.

Prior to colonization by European-Americans, Chewelah was home to a band of the Lower Kalispel people. The band was known as the &quot;Slet̓éw̓si&quot;, meaning &quot;valley people&quot;. The &quot;Chewelah Band of Indians&quot; is currently part of the Spokane Tribe of Indians of Washington.

==Name==
The name &quot;Pend d’Oreille&quot; (), which means &quot;hangs from ear&quot;, was attributed to them by French-speaking colonists and traders in reference to the large shell earrings worn by these people. The name &quot;Kalispel&quot; is an anglicization of their name in their own language (), which means &quot;Camas people&quot;. Camas is a flower bulb that was a staple of their diet.

==Language==
Their language, Kalispel-Pend d’Oreille, is a Southern Interior Salish language. It is also known as Flathead-Kalispel.

==Reservations==
The Pend d&#x27;Oreille people have two reservations: the Flathead Indian Reservation in western Montana and the Kalispel Indian Reservation in Washington. Also, a small number of Kalispel people live on the Colville Indian Reservation in Washington.

The main part of the Kalispel Reservation is northwest of Newport, Washington, in central Pend Oreille County. The main reservation is an strip of land along the Pend Oreille River, west of the Washington–Idaho border. There is also a small parcel of land in the western part of the Spokane metropolitan area in the city of Airway Heights, with a land area of . This is the site of Northern Quest Resort &amp; Casino, which is operated by the tribe. The total land area of the Kalispel Indian Reservation, located at in Pend Oreille County, is . The nearest outside community is Cusick, near the south end of the reservation.

==History==

The Pend d&#x27;Oreille people are believed to have migrated south from British Columbia. In 1809, the North West Company established a trading post in their territory, calling it Kullyspell House. Jesuits established a Roman Catholic mission there in 1846. In 1855, the tribe split into the upper and lower divisions, with the upper moving to the Flathead Reservation in Montana. One of the two lower bands joined them in 1887.

These people made their weapons and tools from flint, and many other things were shaped with rocks. For housing, the Pend d’Oreille lived in tipis in the summer, as well as lodges in the winter time. These houses were all built out of large cattails, which were in abundance where the people lived. These cattails were woven into mats called “tule mats”, which were attached to a tree branch frame to form a hut. Today a large community building on the Kalispel reservation bears the name “Tule Hut” in reference to this traditional housing.

The tribe traded bison hides for horses and other useful goods. They traditionally made clothing from rabbit pelts and deer hides. They embellished hides with dyes, paints, beads, and porcupine quills.

The Upper Pend d’Oreille of the Flathead Reservation became engaged in a dispute over off-reservation hunting between the tribes and the state of Montana, resulting in the Swan Valley Massacre of 1908.

Long after they were dispossessed of their hereditary lands around Lake Pend Oreille, the Pend d&#x27;Oreille band of Kalispel continued to gather for an annual pow wow on its traditional grounds just east of what is now Sandpoint City Beach. The three-day event included ceremonies, dancing and traditional stick games. The pow wows in Sandpoint were discontinued in the early 1950s.

Since 1975, the Kalispel Tribe has held an annual pow wow at its Usk, Washington, reservation in July or August. The events are open to the public and include a dance contest, traditional foods, stick games and others.

<text>The Club Kids were a New York City-based artistic and fashion-conscious youth movement composed of nightlife personalities active from the late 1980s to 1996. Coined by a 1988 &quot;New York&quot; cover story, the Club Kids crossed over into the public consciousness through appearances on daytime talk shows, magazine editorials, fashion campaigns and music videos. Retrospectively, writers have commented that the Club Kids planted the seeds for popular cultural trends such as reality television, self-branding, influencers and even the &quot;gender revolution&quot;. Known for their outrageous looks, legendary parties and sometimes illicit antics, the Club Kids were seen as the embodiment of Generation X and would prove to be &quot;the last definitive subculture group of the analog world&quot;.

==Background==
The group was first popularized by club promoter Michael Alig, James St. James, DJ Keoki, Ernie Glam, Julie Jewels, It Twins and Michael Tronn in the late 1980s, and, throughout the 1990s, grew to include Amanda Lepore, Waltpaper (Walt Cassidy), Christopher Comp, Jennytalia (Jenny Dembrow), Desi Monster (Desi Santiago), Astro Erle, Keda, Kabuki Starshine, and Richie Rich.

The Club Kids made long-lasting contributions to mainstream art, fashion and popular culture. According to former Club Kid Waltpaper (Walt Cassidy), &quot;The nightclub for me was like a laboratory, a place where you were encouraged and rewarded for experimentation.&quot; At the height of the group&#x27;s popularity, Alig began to spiral into heavy drug use, adding drug dealers to the Club Kids roster and Peter Gatien&#x27;s payroll; an increasing number of Club Kids became addicted to drugs.

The movement began to decline when Rudy Giuliani took office as mayor of New York in 1994, targeting the city&#x27;s nightlife industry with his Quality of Life campaign. It eventually collapsed after Alig was arrested for the killing and dismemberment of his roommate and fellow club kid Andre &quot;Angel&quot; Melendez, and Peter Gatien was charged with tax evasion and deported to Canada.

== Members ==
The term &quot;club kid&quot;, coined by club owner Rudolf Piper, is now widely used as an archetypal style and personality reference, but was originally focused, from 1988 to 2001, on a shifting hierarchical group of New York based personalities that organized and promoted specific nightclub venues, tours to various cities and events, such at the Style Summits and Outlaw Parties; Michael Alig, once estimated, that the group expanded to include up to &quot;750 in the early &#x27;90s at different levels&quot;, Michael Alig and rival personality, James St. James (born James Clark), first identified as &quot;club kids&quot; at nightclubs such at The World and Tunnel in 1988 Other documented personalities include:

== History ==
Alig moved to New York City from his hometown, South Bend, in 1984 and began hosting small events. In 1987, he supplanted Andy Warhol as a leading New York partier; in an article in &quot;Interview&quot;, Alig said: &quot;We were all going to become Warhol Superstars and move into The Factory. The funny thing was that everybody had the same idea: not to dress up but to make fun of people who dressed up. We changed our names like they did, and we dressed up in outrageously crazy outfits in order to be a satire of them—only we ended up becoming what we were satirizing.&quot;

The Club Kids&#x27; aesthetic emphasized outrageousness, &quot;fabulousness&quot;, and sex. Gender expression was fluid, and members embraced DIY. In Musto&#x27;s words: &quot;It was a statement of individuality and sexuality which ran the gamut, and it was a form of tapping into an inner fabulousness within themselves and bringing it out.&quot;

As the group&#x27;s influence grew, they spread from the back rooms of lesser-known clubs to venues such as Area, Rudolf Piper&#x27;s Danceteria, and the Palladium. From there, Alig and his group went on to run Peter Gatien&#x27;s club network, including Club USA, Palladium, Tunnel, and The Limelight. To draw crowds into these venues, Alig and the Club Kids began holding guerilla-style &quot;outlaw parties&quot;, where, fully costumed and ready to party, they would hijack locations like Burger King, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, McDonald&#x27;s, ATM vestibules, the then-abandoned High Line tracks, and the New York City Subway blasting music from a boombox and dancing until the police cleared them out. Alig even &quot;threw a party in a cardboard shantytown rented from its homeless inhabitants&quot;, whom he paid with cash and crack cocaine.

He ensured that such events always happened in the vicinity of an actual club to which the group could decamp. At the height of their cultural popularity, the Club Kids toured the United States (throwing parties, &quot;certifying&quot; those clubs for inclusion in the Club Kids network, and recruiting new members), and appeared on several talk shows, including &quot;Geraldo&quot;, &quot;The Joan Rivers Show&quot;, &quot;The Jane Whitney Show&quot; and the &quot;Phil Donahue Show&quot;. 

As the 1990s began, the front line of the Club Kids became occupied by a younger group of dynamic personalities that were discovered and mentored by Alig, such as Waltpaper, Jennytalia (Jenny Dembrow), Desi Monster (Desi Santiago), Astro Erle, Christopher Comp, Pebbles, Keda, Kabuki Starshine, Sacred Boy, Sushi, Lil Keni, DJ Whillyem, Aphrodita, Lila Wolfe and Richie Rich. Many of these primary Club Kids lived together communally in large triplex apartments, and at the Chelsea Hotel and Hotel 17.

Prominent music personalities, such as Björk, then singer of the band Sugarcubes, were seen hanging with the Club Kids. With techno and the incoming rave scene, fashion began to soften into an ambiguous gender-fluid style, which melded references to the Club Kids with skate, indie, hip-hop, and grunge. Brands began casting street models and club personalities in shows, campaigns and music videos. Actress Chloë Sevigny emerged from the group at this time, and frequently modeled with Waltpaper, Jennytalia, DJ Whillyem, and Karliin Mann for brands like JYSP Johnson, Calvin Klein, and Jean-Paul Gaultier and in various editorials that showcased Rave vs. Club Kid style for magazines, including &quot;Paper&quot;, &quot;Max&quot;, &quot;Project X&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;Details&quot; and &quot;High Times&quot;.

The movement&#x27;s decline was marked by an event on Sunday, March 17, 1996, when Alig and his roommate Robert &quot;Freeze&quot; Riggs killed former Limelight employee and reputed drug dealer Andre &quot;Angel&quot; Melendez. After nine months, Alig and Riggs were arrested. The group dissipated in the mid-1990s after Mayor Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s &quot;Quality of Life&quot; crackdown on Manhattan&#x27;s nightclubs.

Many of the members of the Club Kids distanced themselves from Alig as details of the murder were released and branded by the press and through documentaries such as &quot;Party Monster&quot;. Waltpaper stated in &quot;Interview&quot;: &quot;I would say a lot of the community felt our experience of the time was hijacked by that &quot;Party Monster&quot; narrative...That&#x27;s not the New York I knew. That narrative doesn&#x27;t include the creativity, vibrancy, and cultural impact that I experienced.&quot; For his 2019 book, &quot;New York: Club Kids&quot;, Cassidy weaves an optimistic narrative where a bunch of misfits made a wonderland by being themselves.

<doc id="884669" wikidata="Q1553052" url="?curid=884669" title="Nusaybin">
<text>Nusaybin () is a municipality and district of Mardin Province, Turkey. Its area is 1,079 km2, and its population is 115,586 (2022). The city is populated by Kurds of different tribal affiliation.

Nusaybin is separated from the larger Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli by the Syria–Turkey border.

The city is at the foot of the Mount Izla escarpment at the southern edge of the Tur Abdin hills, standing on the banks of the Jaghjagh River (), the ancient Mygdonius (). The city existed in the Assyrian Empire and is recorded in Akkadian inscriptions as &quot;Naṣibīna&quot;. Having been part of the Achaemenid Empire, in the Hellenistic period the settlement was re-founded as a &quot;polis&quot; named &quot;Antioch on the Mygdonius&quot; by the Seleucid dynasty after the conquests of Alexander the Great. A part of first the Roman Republic and then the Roman Empire, the city (; ) was mainly Syriac-speaking, and control of it was contested between the Kingdom of Armenia, the Romans, and the Parthian Empire. After a peace treaty contracted between the Sasanian Empire and the Romans in 298 and enduring until 337, Nisibis was capital of Roman Mesopotamia and the seat of its governor (). Jacob of Nisibis, the city&#x27;s first known bishop, constructed its first cathedral between 313 and 320. Nisibis was a focus of international trade, and according to the Greek history of Peter the Patrician, the primary point of contact between Roman and Persian empires.

Nisibis was besieged three times by the Sasanian army under Shapur II () in the first half of the 4th century; each time, the city&#x27;s fortifications held. The Syriac poet Ephrem the Syrian witnessed all three sieges, and praised Nisibis&#x27;s successive bishops for their contributions to the defences in his , while the Roman &quot;caesar&quot; Julian () described the third siege in his panegyric to his senior co-emperor, the &quot;augustus&quot; Constantius II (). The Roman soldier and Latin historian Ammianus Marcellinus described Nisibis, fortified with walls, towers, and a citadel, as &quot;the strongest bulwark of the Orient&quot;.

After the defeat of the Romans in Julian&#x27;s Persian War, Julian&#x27;s successor Jovian () was forced to cede the five Transtigritine provinces to the Persians, including Nisibis. The city was evacuated and its citizens forced to migrate to Amida (Diyarbakır) – which was expanded to accommodate them – and to Edessa (Urfa). According to the Latin historian Eutropius, the cession of Nisibis was supposed to last 120 years. Nisibis remained a major entrepôt; one of only three such cities of commercial exchange allowed by Roman law promulgated in 408/9. However, despite several Roman attempts to recapture Nisibis through the remainder of the Roman–Persian Wars and the construction of nearby Dara to defend against Persian attack, Nisibis was not returned to Roman control before it was conquered in 639 by the Rashidun Caliphate during the Muslim conquest of the Levant.

Under Sasanian rule and after, Nisibis was a major centre of the Christian Church, and the bishop of Nisibis attended the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon convened in 410 by the emperor Yazdegerd I (). As a result of this council, the Church of the East was set up, and the bishop of Nisibis became the metropolitan bishop of the five erstwhile Transtigritine provinces. Narsai, formerly a theologian at the School of Edessa, founded the famous School of Nisibis with the bishop, Barsauma, in the 470s. When the Roman emperor Zeno () closed the School of Edessa in 489, the scholars migrated to Nisibis&#x27;s school and established the city as the foremost centre of Christian thought in the Church of the East. According to the Damascene monk John Moschus, the city&#x27;s cathedral had five doors in the 7th century, and the monastic and later bishop of Harran, Symeon of the Olives, was recorded as having renewed several ecclesiastical buildings in the early period of Arab rule. The monasteries of the nearby Tur Abdin, led by the reforms of Abraham the Great of Kashkar, founder of the &quot;Great Monastery&quot; of Mount Izla, underwent substantial revival in the years after the Muslim conquest. However, besides the baptistery known as the Church of Saint Jacob (&quot;Mar Ya‘qub&quot;) and built in 359 by bishop Vologeses, little remains of ancient Nisibis, probably because of ruinous earthquake in 717. Archaeological excavations were conducted in the vicinity of the 4th-century baptistery in the early 21st century, revealing various buildings including the 4th-century cathedral.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===

First mentioned in 901 BCE, Naṣibīna was an Aramean kingdom captured by the Assyrian king Adad-Nirari II in 896. By 852 BCE, Naṣibīna had been fully annexed to the Neo-Assyrian Empire and appeared in the Assyrian Eponym List as the seat of an Assyrian provincial governor named Shamash-Abua.

It was under Babylonian control until 536 BCE, when it fell to the Achaemenid Persians, and remained so until taken by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE.

==== Hellenistic period ====
The Seleucids re-founded the city as Antiochia Mygdonia (), mentioned for the first time in Polybius&#x27; description of the march of Antiochus III the Great against Molon (Polybius, V, 51). The Greek historian Plutarch suggested that the city was populated by descendants of Spartans. Around the 1st century CE, Nisibis () was the home of Judah ben Bethera, who founded a famous yeshiva there.

In 67 BCE, during Rome&#x27;s first war with Armenia, the Roman general Lucullus took Nisibis () from the brother of Tigranes.

Like many other cities in the marches where Roman and Parthian powers confronted one another, Nisibis was often taken and retaken. In 115 CE, it was captured by the Roman Emperor Trajan, for which he gained the name of &quot;Parthicus&quot;, then lost to and regained from the Jews during the Diaspora Revolt. After the Romans again lost the city in 194, it was once more conquered by Septimius Severus, who made it his headquarters and re-established a colony there. The last battle between Rome and Parthia was fought in the vicinity of the city in 217.
=== Late Antiquity ===

With the fresh energy of the new Sassanid dynasty, Shapur I conquered Nisibis, was driven out, and returned in the 260s. In 298, by a treaty with Narseh, the province of Nisibis was acquired by the Roman Empire.

During the Roman–Persian Wars (337–363 CE) Nisibis was unsuccessfully besieged by the Sassanid Empire thrice, in 337, 346 and 350. According to the &quot;Expositio totius mundi et gentium&quot; bronze and iron were forbidden to be exported to the Persians, but for other goods, Nisibis was the site of substantial trade across the Roman–Persian frontier.

Upon the death of Constantine the Great in 337 CE, the Sassanid Shah Shapur II marched against Roman held Nisibis with a vast army composed of cavalry, infantry and elephants. His combat engineers raised siege works, including towers, so his archers could rain down arrows at the defenders. They also undermined the walls, dammed the Mygdonius River and constructed dikes to direct the river against the walls. On the seventieth day of the siege, the water was released and the torrent struck the walls; entire sections of the city walls collapsed. The water passed through the city and knocked down a section of the opposite wall as well. The Persians were unable to assault the city because the approaches to the breaches were impassable due to floodwater, mud and debris. The soldiers and citizens inside the city worked all night and by dawn the breaches were closed with makeshift barriers. Shapur&#x27;s assault troops attacked the breaches, but their assault was repulsed. A few days later the Persian lifted the siege.

Nisibis was besieged a second time in 346 CE. The details of the second siege have not survived. Shapur besieged the city for seventy-eight days and then lifted the siege.

In 350 CE, while the Roman Emperor Constantius II was engaged in a civil war against the usurper Magnentius in the West, the Persians invaded and laid siege to Nisibis for the third time. The siege lasted between 100 and 160 days. The Persian engineers tried several innovative siege technics; using the River Mygdonius to bring down a section of the walls, and creating a lake around the city and using boats with siege engines to bring down another section. Unlike the first siege, as the walls fell, Persian assault troops immediately entered the breaches supported by war elephants. Despite all this they failed to break through the breaches and the attack stalled. The Romans, experts at close-quarter combat, and supported by arrows and bolts from the walls and towers checked the assault and a sortie from one of the gates forced the Persians to withdraw. Shortly after the Persian Army, suffering heavy casualties from combat and disease, lifted the siege and withdrew.

The Roman historian of the 4th century, Ammianus Marcellinus, gained his first practical experience of warfare as a young man at Nisibis under the &quot;magister equitum&quot;, Ursicinus. From 360 to 363, Nisibis was the camp of Legio I Parthica. Because of its strategic importance on the Persian border, Nisibis was heavily fortified. Ammianus lovingly calls Nisibis the &quot;impregnable city&quot; (&quot;urbs inexpugnabilis&quot;) and &quot;bulwark of the provinces&quot; (&quot;murus provinciarum&quot;).

Sozomen writes that when the inhabitants of Nisibis asked for help because the Persians were about to invade the Roman territories and attack them, Emperor Julian refused to assist them because they were Christianized, and he told them that he would not help them if they did not return to paganism.

In 363 Nisibis was ceded to the Sassanian Empire after the defeat of Julian. Before that time the population of the town was forced by the Roman authorities to leave Nisibis and move to Amida. Emperor Jovian allowed them only three days for the evacuation. Historian Ammianus Marcellinus was again an eyewitness and condemns Emperor Jovian for giving up the fortified town without a fight. Marcellinus&#x27; point-of-view is certainly in line with contemporary Roman public opinion.

According to Al-Tabari, some 12,000 Persians of good lineage from Istakhr, Isfahan, and other regions settled at Nisibis in the fourth century, and their descendants were still there at the beginning of the seventh century.

The School of Nisibis, founded at the introduction of Christianity into the city by ethnic Assyrians of the Assyrian Church of the East, was closed when the province was ceded to the Persians. Ephrem the Syrian, an Assyrian poet, commentator, preacher and defender of orthodoxy, joined the general exodus of Christians and re-established the school on more securely Roman soil at Edessa. In the fifth century, the school became a center of Nestorian Christianity, and was closed down by Archbishop Cyrus in 489. The expelled masters and pupils withdrew once more, back to Nisibis, under the care of Barsauma, who had been trained at Edessa, under the patronage of Narses, who established the statutes of the new school. Those that have been discovered and published belong to Osee, the successor of Barsauma in the See of Nisibis, and bear the date 496; they must be substantially the same as those of 489. In 590, they were again modified. The monastery school was under a superior called &quot;Rabban&quot; (&quot;master&quot;), a title also given to the instructors. The administration was confided to a major-domo, who was steward, prefect of discipline and librarian, but under the supervision of a council. Unlike the Jacobite schools, devoted chiefly to profane studies, the School of Nisibis was above all a school of theology. The two chief masters were the instructors in reading and in the interpretation of Holy Scripture, explained chiefly with the aid of Theodore of Mopsuestia. The free course of studies lasted three years, the students providing for their own support. During their sojourn at the university, masters and students led a monastic life under somewhat special conditions. The school had a tribunal and enjoyed the right of acquiring all sorts of property. Its rich library possessed a most beautiful collection of Nestorian works; from its remains Ebed-Jesus, Bishop of Nisibis in the 14th century, composed his celebrated catalogue of ecclesiastical writers. The disorders and dissensions, which arose in the sixth century in the school of Nisibis, favoured the development of its rivals, especially that of Seleucia; however, it did not really begin to decline until after the foundation of the School of Baghdad (832). Notable people associated with the school include its founder Narses; Abraham, his nephew and successor; Abraham of Kashgar, the restorer of monastic life; and ArchbishopElijah of Nisibis.

As a fortified frontier city, Nisibis played a major role in the Roman-Persian Wars. It became the capital of the newly created province of Mesopotamia after Diocletian&#x27;s organization of the eastern Roman frontier. It became known as the &quot;Shield of the Empire&quot; after a successful resistance in 337–350. The city changed hands several times, and once in Sasanian hands, Nisibis was the base of operations against the Romans. The city was also one of the main crossing points for merchants, although elaborate counter-espionage safeguards were also in place.

=== Islamic period ===
The city was taken without resistance by the forces of the Rashidun Caliphate under Umar in 639 or 640. Under early Islamic rule, the city served as a local administrative centre. In 717, it was struck by an earthquake and in 927 it was raided by the Qarmatians. Nisibis was captured in 942 by the Byzantine Empire but was subsequently recaptured by the Hamdanid dynasty. It was attacked by the Byzantines once again in 972. Following the Hamdanids, the city was administered by the Marwanids and the Uqaylids. From the middle of the 11th century onwards, it was subjected to Turkish raids and being threatened by the County of Edessa, being attacked and damaged by Seljuq forces under Tughril in 1043. The city nevertheless remained an important centre of commerce and transport.

In 1120, it was captured by the Artuqids under Necmeddin Ilgazi, followed by the Zengids and Ayyubids. The city is described as a very prosperous one by the period&#x27;s Arab geographers and historians, with imposing baths, walls, lavish houses, a bridge and a hospital. In 1230, the city was invaded by the Mongol Empire. Mongol sovereignty was followed by that of the Ag Qoyunlu, Kara Koyunlu and Safavids. In 1515, it was taken by the Ottoman Empire under Selim I thanks to the efforts of Idris Bitlisi.

=== Modern history ===

On the eve of World War I, Nusaybin had a Christian community of 2000, along with a Jewish population of 600. A massacre of Christians took place in August 1915, after which the Christian community of Nusaybin diminished to 1200. Syrian Jacobites, Chaldean Catholics, Protestants, and Armenians were targeted.

As agreed upon by the governments of France and the new Republic of Turkey in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, the Turkey-Syria border would follow the line of the Baghdad Railway until Nusaybin, after which it would follow the path of a Roman road leading to Cizre. After the establishment of the French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon, Nusaybin lost over 60% of its population to the settlements there, most prominently Qamishli.

Nusaybin was a place on the transit routes of Syrian Jews leaving the country after the 1948 formation of Israel and the subsequent Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. Upon reaching Turkey, after a route that took them through Aleppo and the Jazira sometimes with the help of Bedouin smugglers, most headed for Israel. There had been a large Jewish community in Nisbis since antiquity, many of whom moved to Qamishli in the early 20th century for economic reasons. A synagogue in Jerusalem practises the Nisibis and Qamishli rites today.

==== 21st century ====
Nusaybin made headlines in 2006 when villagers near Kuru uncovered a mass grave, suspected of belonging to Ottoman Armenians and Assyrians killed during the Armenian and Assyrian genocides. Swedish historian David Gaunt visited the site to investigate its origins, but left after finding evidence of tampering. Gaunt, who has studied 150 massacres carried out in the summer of 1915 in Mardin, said that the Committee of Union and Progress&#x27;s governor for Mardin, Halil Edip, had likely ordered the massacre on 14 June 1915, leaving 150 Armenians and 120 Assyrians dead. The settlement was then known as Dara (now Oğuz). Gaunt added that the death squad, named &quot;El-Hamşin&quot; (meaning &quot;fifty men&quot;), was headed by officer Refik Nizamettin Kaddur. The president of the Turkish Historical Society, Yusuf Halaçoğlu, following the Turkish government&#x27;s policy of Armenian genocide denial, said that the remains dated back to Roman times. &quot;Özgür Gündem&quot; reported that the Turkish military and police pressed the Turkish media not to report the discovery.

The Turkish Interior Ministry looked into dissolving Nusaybin city council in 2012 after it decided to use Arabic, Armenian, Aramaic, and Kurmanji on signposts in the town, in addition to the Turkish language.

===== Tensions and violence =====
In November 2013, Nusaybin&#x27;s mayor, Ayşe Gökkan, commenced a hunger strike to protest against the construction of a wall between Nusaybin and the neighboring Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli in Syria. Construction of the wall stopped as a result of this and other protests.

On 13 November 2015, the town was placed under a curfew by the Turkish government, and Ali Atalan and Gülser Yıldırım, two elected members of the Grand National Assembly from the pro-Kurdish Peoples&#x27; Democratic Party (HDP), began a hunger strike in protest. Two civilians and ten PKK fighters were killed by security forces in the ensuing unrest. By March 2016, PKK forces controlled about half of Nusaybin according to &quot;Al-Masdar News&quot; and the YPS controlled &quot;much&quot; of it, according to &quot;The Independent&quot;. The Turkish state imposed eight successive curfews over several months and employed the use of heavy weapons in defeating the Kurdish militants, resulting in large swathes of Nusaybin being destroyed. 61 members of the security forces had been killed by May 2016. By 9 April, 60,000 residents of the city had been displaced, yet 30,000 civilians remained in the city, including in the six neighborhoods where fighting continued. YPS reportedly had 700–800 militants in the city, of which the Turkish army claimed that 325 were &quot;neutralised&quot; by 4 May. A curfew was in place between 14 March and 25 July in the majority of the town. After the fighting ended in a Turkish Army victory, in late September 2016 the Turkish government began demolishing a quarter of the city&#x27;s residential buildings. This rendered 30,000 citizens homeless and caused a mass evacuation of tens of thousands of residents to neighboring towns and villages. Over 6,000 houses were bulldozed. After demolition was completed in March 2017, over one hundred apartment towers were built. The Turkish government offered to compensate homeowners at 12% of the value of their destroyed houses if they agreed to certain relocation conditions.

== Economy ==
As a result of Turkish government policy to close all border crossings with the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, the city&#x27;s border with Syria (i.e. the large Syrian city of Qamishli) has been closed, with claims that the cessation in smuggling has led to a 90% rise in unemployment in the city.

== Transportation ==
Nusaybin is served by the E90 roadway and other roads to surrounding towns. The Nusaybin Railway Station is served by two daily trains. The closest airport is Qamishli Airport five kilometers to the south, in Qamishli in Syria. The closest Turkish airport is Mardin Airport, 55 kilometers northwest of Nusaybin.

== Geography ==

Nusaybin is on the north side of the Syria-Turkey border, which divides it from the city of Qamishli. The Jaghjagh River flows through both cities. The Nusaybin side of the border has a minefield, with a total of some 600,000 landmines having been set by the Turkish Armed Forces since the 1950s. Located to the east is Mount Judi, which people (including Muslims) consider to be the place where the ark of Nuh or Noah (who is regarded as a &quot;Nabi&quot; or Prophet in Abrahamic religions) came to rest.
===Composition===
There are 84 neighbourhoods in Nusaybin District. Fifteen of these (8 Mart, Abdulkadirpaşa, Barış, Devrim, Dicle, Fırat, Gırnavas, İpekyolu, Kışla, Mor-Yakup, Selahattin Eyyübi, Yenişehir, Yenituran and Zeynelabidin) form the central town (&quot;merkez&quot;) of Nusaybin.

=== Climate ===
Nusaybin has a semi-arid climate with extremely hot summers and cool winters. Rainfall is generally sparse.

== Demographics ==
Nusaybin is predominantly ethnically Kurdish. The city&#x27;s people have historically close ties with those of neighboring Qamishli, and cross-border marriages are a common practice. The city also contains a minority Arab population.

In early 20th century, Nusaybin was composed mostly of Arabs who came from Mardin, roughly 500 Jews, and some Assyrians, totaling to 2000 people. Likewise, Mark Sykes recorded Nusaybin as a town inhabited by Chaldeans, Arabs, and Jews. The town was largely Arabic-speaking such that Kurdish families settling in the town eventually learned Arabic. The ethnic and linguistic demographics changed after mid-century. Jews migrated to Israel, and Assyrian population substantially decreased. After dense Kurdish migration in late 20th century, Nusaybin became a largely Kurdish-speaking and Kurdish town.

A very small Assyrian population remains in the city; what remained of the Assyrian population emigrated during the height of the Kurdish-Turkish conflict in the 1990s and as a result of the resumption of the conflict in 2016, only one Assyrian family reportedly remained in the city.

=== Christianity ===
Nisibis (, &quot;Nṣibin&quot;, later Syriac , &quot;Ṣōbā&quot;) had an Assyrian Christian bishop from 300, founded by Babu (died 309). Shapur II besieged the city in 338, 346, and 350, when St Jacob or James of Nisibis, Babu&#x27;s successor, was its bishop. Nisibis was the home of Ephrem the Syrian, who remained until its surrender to the Sassanid Persians by Roman Emperor Jovian in 363. The bishop of Nisibis was the Metropolitan Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Bit-Arbaye. By 410, it had six suffragan sees and as early as the middle of the 5th century was the most important episcopal see of the Church of the East after Seleucia-Ctesiphon. Many of its Nestorian or Assyrian Church of the East and Jacobite bishops were renowned for their writings, including Barsumas, Osee, Narses, Jesusyab and Ebed-Jesus. The Roman Catholic Church has defined titular archbishoprics of Nisibis, for various rites – one Latin and four Eastern Catholic for particular churches &quot;sui iuris&quot;, notably the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Maronite Catholic Church.

When the Syriac Catholic Eparchy of Hassaké was promoted to archiepiscopal rank, it added Nisibi to its name, becoming the Syriac Catholic Archeparchy of Hassaké-Nisibi (not Metropolitan, directly dependent on the Syriac Catholic Patriarch of Antioch).

<text>The Ötztal Alps (, ) are a mountain range in the Central Eastern Alps, in the State of Tyrol in western Austria and the Province of South Tyrol in northern Italy.

==Geography==
The Ötztal Alps are arrayed at the head of the Ötztal valley, a side valley of the Inn river southwest of Innsbruck, Austria. One line of summits forms part of the border between Austria and Italy.

The Ötztal Alps are bordered by the Reschen Pass (1504 m) in the west and the Inn river in the northwest and north. In the east the range is separated from the Stubai Alps by the Ötztaler Ache in the Ötztal, the Timmelsjoch (2474 m) and the Passer river in the Passeier Valley. On the south and southwest, the range is limited by the deep valley of the Etsch river, here known as the Vinschgau.

The Ötztal Alps are surrounded by the following ranges:
* Lechtal Alps
* Mieming Range
* Stubai Alps
* Sarntal Alps
* Ortler Alps
* Sesvenna Alps
* Samnaun Alps

In September 1991, Ötzi the so-called &quot;Iceman&quot; was found on the Hauslabjoch between the peaks Fineilspitze and Similaun.

==Peaks==

The highest point of the Ötztal Alps is Wildspitze , which is also the second highest mountain in Austria (after Großglockner). Wildspitze is on one of several arms that extend north and northeast from the main ridge.

Some of the main peaks of the Ötztal Alps are:

<text>Tabas () is a city in the Central District of Tabas County, South Khorasan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

== History ==
===Early history===
The history of Tabas dates back to pre-Islamic times. It was an important outpost of the Sassanid empire.

Due to its strategic location at the edge of the Great Salt Desert, and at the confluence of many roads, the geographer al-Baladhuri called the city &quot;the Gate of Khurasan&quot;. In the early Islamic period it was known as Tabas al-Tamr () due to a large forest of date palms that grew there, and later as Tabas Gilaki after a famous governor of the city, Abu&#x27;l-Hasan ibn Muhammad Gilaki, who in the mid-11th century had pacified the region. Along with the town of Tabas-e Masina further east, it gave its name to the local district, Tabasayn. In the 10th–11th centuries, the town is described as well fortified, with several villages around. Medieval and geographers note that it was amply supplied with water due to underground wells; the town even featured hot baths, and extensive lemon and orange plantations. In the late 11th century, it became part of the Nizari Ismaili state, and was besieged by the Seljuk Turks under Ahmad Sanjar in 1102.

Tabas was spared when the Mongols attacked Iran. It had a local government incorporating not only Tabas but also Ferdows and Gonabad. After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, it as under the control of the Zangu&#x27;i Arabs as an independent state which included nearby Tun. For a time they even kidnapped Nader Mirza Afshar and placed the Kurds of Khabushan in control of Mashhad.

===Earthquake of 1978===
In 1978, the 7.4 Tabas earthquake affected the city with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). At least 15,000 people were killed. Since then, the city has been rebuilt with many new streets, parks and public buildings.

=== Operation Eagle Claw ===

The failed rescue American operation Operation Eagle Claw on 24–25 April 1980 to free American hostages in Tehran occurred near Tabas in Tabas Country about 127km southwest of Tabas town by the road to Yazd location (33.07020674739667;55.89196171977231). In Iran, the operation is called &quot;amaliat tabas&quot; (Tabas operation), and the significance and aftermath of the failed operation made the city Tabas known in almost every corner of Iran. The Tabas air defense system is accordingly named so.

<text>The Bedford Avenue station is a station on the BMT Canarsie Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Bedford Avenue and North Seventh Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, it is served by the L train at all times. With an annual total of 9,388,289 passengers for 2015, Bedford Avenue is the busiest subway station in Brooklyn outside of Downtown Brooklyn, as well as the busiest station in Brooklyn served by one subway service.

== History ==

Bedford Avenue opened on June 30, 1924, as part of the initial segment of the underground Canarsie Line that originally stretched from Sixth Avenue station in Manhattan to Montrose Avenue station, built by the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) under the Dual Contracts.

As part of the wide scope in the rebuilding of the Canarsie Tubes that were damaged during Hurricane Sandy, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority started renovating the station in 2017. At the Bedford Avenue end of the station, two new street-level stairways were built, platform stair capacity was increased, the mezzanine was expanded, turnstiles were added, and new elevators were installed and opened on August 6, 2020. At the Driggs Avenue end, two new street-level stairways were added, the mezzanine area was redesigned with additional turnstiles installed, and a new platform stairway was built. Substantial completion was projected for November 2020, and MTA officials formally dedicated the new elevators and entrances that October.

New York City councilmember Lincoln Restler founded a volunteer group, the Friends of MTA Station Group, in early 2023 to advocate for improvements to the Bedford Avenue station and four other subway stations in Brooklyn. In 2023, a short barrier was installed at the center of the platforms to reduce the probability of passengers being pushed into the tracks.

==Station layout==
At platform level, Bedford Avenue utilizes a simple island platform setup with two tracks. The track normally used by southbound trains to Canarsie is labeled Q1, and the track normally used by northbound trains to Manhattan is labeled Q2. The Q- prefix denotes that the track is on the Canarsie Line, but this is only used by MTA officials and not by the general public.

The Bedford Avenue station&#x27;s walls have a brown-and-green mosaic pattern with geometric shapes and embellished &quot;B&quot; ornamentation.

There are two mezzanines above the platform: one at Bedford Avenue on the west and one at Driggs Avenue on the east. Two stairs and an elevator rise from the west end of the platform to the Bedford Avenue mezzanine, while a stair from the east end of the platform rises to the Driggs Avenue mezzanine.

===Exits===

There are two sets of entrance and exit points. The western set comprises four street stairs: two stairs each to the southeastern and northeastern corners of Bedford Avenue and North 7th Street. It also comprises a 24-hour booth and an elevator to the northeastern corner of the intersection. The eastern exits are two stairs each to the southeastern and northeastern corners of North 7th Street and Driggs Avenue.

Some of these staircases are original to the station, while others were built as part of the 2019 expansion. The entrances built as part of the expansion are similar to those at Enhanced Station Initiative stations in other parts of the subway system, with next-train countdown clocks and neighborhood wayfinding maps at the exterior of the entrance. The new entrances contain a mural by Marcel Dzama entitled &quot;No Less Than Everything Comes Together&quot;, which depicts a sun and moon rising over fanciful figures.

==Ridership==
Bedford Avenue has experienced a surge in ridership along with the recent gentrification of Williamsburg. In the 1970s, the station had a fairly low annual ridership of 1.2 million, amounting to an average of 3,000 entries during weekdays. In 2000, there were 3.783 million boardings recorded at the station, but after the neighborhood was re-zoned in 2005, the MTA noted even higher ridership. By 2007, ridership had increased over 50%, to 5.776 million annual passengers. In 2008, Bedford Avenue was used by more than 6 million people, making it the 53rd most-used subway station in New York City and one of the busiest in Brooklyn. In , riders used this station.

Between 1998 and 2011, passenger numbers on the L increased three times as much as ridership on the subway system as a whole. As a result, by 2011, many Manhattan-bound L trains were running at their full capacity of 1,160 riders per train by the time they reached the Bedford Avenue station. In 2010, Bedford Avenue surpassed seven million entries for the first time in its history, receiving press for its particularly high weekend passenger volume. Crowding has become such an issue that politicians have called upon the MTA to &quot;create a schedule that is more reflective of ridership patterns.&quot;

<text>The Stubai Alps (, ) is a mountain range in the Central Eastern Alps of Europe. It derives its name from the Stubaital valley to its east and is located southwest of Innsbruck, Austria. Several peaks form the border between Austria and Italy. The range is bounded by the Inn River valley to the north; the Sill River valley (&quot;Wipptal&quot;) and the Brenner Pass to the east (separating it from the Zillertal Alps); the Ötztal and Timmelsjoch to the west (separating it from the Ötztal Alps), and to the south by tributaries of the Passer River and Eisack.

== Geography ==
Important parts of the Stubai Alps show signs of glaciation.
The northern part around the Sellrain valley and the Kühtai is now only lightly glaciated and a popular ski touring destination (Zischgeles, Lampsenspitze, Pirchkogel, Sulzkogel). The High Stubai around the upper Stubai valley is still heavily glaciated and a classic high mountain touring region in the Eastern Alps. Here there is a glacier ski area on the Stubai Glacier.

Together with the Ötztal Alps to the west, with which they are linked by the saddle of Timmelsjoch, the Stubai Alps form one of the biggest mountain blocks of the Eastern Alps.

=== Boundary and neighbouring mountain groups ===
In the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps (AVE) the Stubai are no. 31. 
Their boundary follows the following line:
* in the north, it follows the course of the River Inn
** in the northwest, it follows the Inn from its confluence with the Ötztaler Ache (near Ötztal railway station) to the confluence with the Gurglbach (near Imst), then to the &quot;Mieming Chain&quot; (AVE 4) in the Northern Limestone Alps
** in the north, it follows the River Inn to Innsbruck, which divides the Stubai Alps from the &quot;Karwendel&quot; (AVE 5) in the Northern Limestone Alps
* in the east, it is formed by the Wipptal valley:
** in the northeast it follows the Sill to its confluence with the Schmirnbach (Schmirntal) near St. Jodok, opposite the &quot;Tux Alps&quot; (AVE 33)
** in the southeast, it follows the Sill to the Brenner Pass – Eisack to Sterzing, which separates the Stubai Alps from the &quot;Zillertal Alps&quot; (AVE 35) 
* in the south it follows the lower Ridaunbach – Jaufenbach (Jaufental) – Jaufen Pass – St. Leonhard in Passeier, a line which divides it from the &quot;Sarntal Alps&quot; (AVE 32, which are counted as part of the Central Eastern Alps)
* in the west, it follows the line: Passeiertal – Schönauer Alm – Timmelsjoch – Timmelsbach – Gurgler Ache – Ötztaler Ache (the whole Ötz valley) to its confluence with the Inn, forming the boundary to the &quot;Ötztal Alps&quot; (AVE 30)

=== Subgroups ===

The Alpine Club guide to the Stubai Alps divides the range into 15 subgroups as follows:
* Northern Sellrain Mountains (&quot;Nördliche Sellrainer Berge&quot;), highest peak: Rietzer Grießkogel, 2,884 m

<text>Aharon Lichtenstein (May 23, 1933 – April 20, 2015) was an Orthodox rabbi, Israel Prize laureate and rosh yeshiva who was an authority in Jewish law (&quot;Halakha&quot;).

==Biography==
Aharon Lichtenstein was born to Yechiel Lichtenstein and Bluma née Schwartz in Paris, France, but grew up in the United States, where he studied in Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin under Yitzchak Hutner as well as Ahron Soloveichik. He earned a BA at Yeshiva University in 1953, and &quot;semicha&quot; (&quot;rabbinic ordination&quot;) at YU&#x27;s Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary under Joseph B. Soloveitchik, whose daughter, Tovah, he would later marry. He received an M.A. in 1954 and a PhD in English Literature in 1957 at Harvard University, where he studied under Douglas Bush.

Lichtenstein married Tovah Soloveitchik on January 26, 1960. They had six children: Mosheh, Yitzchak, Meir, Esti, Shai and Tonya.

After serving as Rosh Yeshiva/Kollel at Yeshiva University for several years, Lichtenstein answered Yehuda Amital&#x27;s request in 1971 to join him at the helm of Yeshivat Har Etzion, located in Gush Etzion, and moved to Jerusalem. He maintained a close connection to Yeshiva University as a Rosh Kollel for the Gruss Institute in Jerusalem, an affiliate of Yeshiva University and its rabbinical school, Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary.

In 2005, he and his wife moved to Alon Shvut, where Yeshivat Har Etzion is located.

On January 4, 2006, Yaakov Medan and Baruch Gigi were officially invested as co-roshei yeshiva alongside Amital and Lichtenstein, with an eye toward Amital&#x27;s intention to retire. On October 28, 2008, Lichtenstein&#x27;s eldest son, Mosheh Lichtenstein, was officially invested as co-Rosh Yeshiva, simultaneous with Amital&#x27;s official retirement, this time with an eye toward Aharon Lichtenstein&#x27;s eventual plan to retire.

He was committed to intensive and original Torah study and articulated a bold Jewish worldview embracing elements of modernity within the framework of a Torah life, reflecting the tradition of his teacher and father-in-law, Joseph B. Soloveitchik in line with Centrist Orthodoxy.

Lichtenstein was awarded the Israel Prize for Jewish Literature on Israeli Independence Day: May 6, 2014. He died on April 20, 2015. He was a source of inspiration for a wide circle of Jewry, for both his educational attainments and his intellectual and spiritual leadership. He was especially admired by many centrist Modern Orthodox leaders as well as many in the Religious Zionist camp.

<text>Harry Reasoner (April 17, 1923 – August 6, 1991) was an American journalist for CBS and ABC News, known for his adroit use of language as a television commentator and as one of the original hosts of the news magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; (1968–1970, 1978–1991).

Over the course of his career, Reasoner won three Emmy Awards and a George Foster Peabody Award in 1967.

==Early life==
Reasoner was born on First Street North in Dakota City, Iowa; he and his older sister, Esther, were the children of Eunice (Nicholl) and Harry Ray Reasoner, who married in 1911. Harry Reasoner was taught to read by his parents before entering school, gaining a broad vocabulary from his mother.

Reasoner attended West High School in Minneapolis, where he developed an interest in journalism. He authored a story titled &quot;The Wench of the Week,&quot; which garnered the attention of the principal, who expelled Reasoner, but later let him return following a plea from a fellow student. Reasoner graduated in January 1940, having missed the 1939 class graduation ceremony. He studied journalism at Stanford University and the University of Minnesota, receiving a journalism degree from the latter&#x27;s School of Journalism in 1989 at the age of 66. Reasoner served in the Army during World War II and after the war, he resumed his journalism career with &quot;The Minneapolis Times&quot;. His novel &quot;Tell Me About Women&quot;, about a fading marriage, was written partly during his war service and was first published in 1946.

==Journalism==

After beginning to work in radio with CBS in 1948, Reasoner worked for the United States Information Agency in the Philippines. When he returned to the US, he transitioned into working in television while at station KEYD (later KMSP) in Minneapolis. He ran for city council in Minneapolis as a Republican in 1949 receiving 381 votes (4.4 percent). In 1956, Reasoner joined CBS News in New York. There in addition to commentator and special news narration duties, he eventually hosted a morning news program, &quot;Calendar,&quot; from 1961 to 1963.

===JFK assassination===
Reasoner took part in covering the John F. Kennedy assassination on Friday, November 22, 1963. Walter Cronkite and Charles Collingwood had been switching back and forth to report on the incident for about four hours after Cronkite broke the news at 1:40 p.m. EST. Reasoner took over the anchor chair after Collingwood tossed it to him at 5:49 p.m. EST and opened with the repeat of an announcement by Frank Stanton, the president of CBS, which had already been relayed by Collingwood:

He later reported on the arrival of President Kennedy&#x27;s body in Washington, D.C., and provided details regarding Lee Harvey Oswald, who was then accused only of killing Dallas Police Officer J. D. Tippit; Oswald would be accused of killing the president only hours later. Reasoner left the desk when Cronkite returned to anchor &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; at 6:35 p.m. EST. He reappeared in another studio, approximately two hours later, to narrate a special program called &quot;John F. Kennedy—A Man of This Century&quot;; he talked about Kennedy&#x27;s career and the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, and announced the conclusion of CBS&#x27;s coverage for that day. (Reasoner also anchored the final coverage of the next day, with a CBS News special, titled &quot;A Day to Mourn&quot;.)

Reasoner&#x27;s next appearance came on Sunday, two days later, and as Reasoner was at the anchor desk, Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby while he was being moved in the Dallas City Jail. At that very moment, Roger Mudd was filing a report from Washington which described the President&#x27;s funeral arrangements:

At that moment, CBS abruptly cut back to Reasoner at the newsroom anchor desk with breaking news:

When CBS picked up KRLD&#x27;s live feed of the city jail basement, Oswald was lying on the floor, and Dallas Police were apprehending Ruby. KRLD&#x27;s reporter on the scene, Bob Huffaker, was heard to say, &quot;Oswald has been shot, Oswald has been shot.&quot; After the ambulance carrying Oswald sped out of the jail en route to Parkland Hospital, KRLD switched back to CBS in New York, where Reasoner replayed the tape from the beginning so that viewers could see Ruby shooting Oswald. Several minutes later, he reported that the Dallas Police had released Ruby&#x27;s name. (Oswald&#x27;s death was later announced by Cronkite, who replaced Reasoner at the anchor desk.)

===&quot;60 Minutes&quot;===

In 1968, Reasoner teamed up with Mike Wallace to launch &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, a new newsmagazine series. On &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and elsewhere, he often worked with producer and writer Andy Rooney, who later became a well-known contributor. In a farewell interview on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 2011, Rooney said Reasoner was a great writer in his own right but was lazy, which gave Rooney more opportunities to show his writing skills. Rooney and interviewer Morley Safer agreed that Reasoner enjoyed drinking and was &quot;one of the most companionable fellows&quot; they had ever known.

===To ABC and back===

In November 1970, Reasoner was hired away from CBS by ABC to become an anchor on the network&#x27;s evening newscast. Prior to his hire, the network&#x27;s New York-based broadcast, &quot;ABC Evening News&quot;, was anchored by Howard K. Smith and Frank Reynolds, and in December 1970, Reasoner was moved into Reynolds&#x27;s position (and Reynolds became the network&#x27;s chief Washington correspondent).

Reasoner anchored the news alongside Smith until 1975, when he took the sole anchor position while Smith moved into a commentary role. The next year, however, ABC paired Reasoner with a new co-anchor, former &quot;Today Show&quot; co-host Barbara Walters; ABC had gone to great lengths to hire her away from NBC. Walters and Reasoner did not enjoy a close relationship; Reasoner did not like sharing the spotlight with a co-anchor and also was uncomfortable with Walters&#x27;s celebrity status. Many also believed that Reasoner disliked the idea of a woman anchoring the network news; one woman at ABC told a reporter that he was a &quot;male chauvinist pig.&quot; He had a history of antifeminist editorializing on air. For example, on the December 21, 1971 newscast, he compared the newly launched feminist &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine to tabloid journalism and pornography, claiming that although the &quot;girls&quot; composing it were prettier than other &quot;shock&quot; publishers, their work had no value.

Disclaiming gender bias against Barbara Walters, however, Reasoner said he was &quot;trying to keep an open mind about it.&quot; In another interview, Reasoner said, &quot;I&#x27;ve worked in journalism for women and with women for years. For two years I did a CBS morning news program with a woman. I feel they&#x27;re no worse than men are.&quot;

After two years of co-anchoring &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; with Walters, Reasoner departed the network after nearly eight years in July 1978 and returned to CBS that fall, where he resumed his duties on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Shortly after his departure ABC scrapped &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; altogether and reworked the newscast into &quot;World News Tonight&quot;.

Reasoner stayed with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; until his retirement, on May 19, 1991.

==Personal life==
Reasoner was married twice, first to Kathleen Carroll Reasoner for 35 years until her death in 1986, and then to insurance executive Lois Harriett Weber in 1988. He had seven children by his first marriage: Harry Stuart, Ann, Elizabeth, Jane, Mary Ray, Ellen, and Jonathan. He had six grandchildren: Leslie, Ryan, Samantha, Christian, Ian, and John. Harry Reasoner had two operations for lung cancer, in 1987 and 1989.

==Death==
Reasoner died within three months of his retirement in 1991 from a blood clot in the brain, resulting from a fall at his home in Westport, Connecticut. He is interred at Union Cemetery in Humboldt, Iowa.

<doc id="884723" wikidata="Q1543208" url="?curid=884723" title="Sacroiliac joint">
<text>The sacroiliac joint or SI joint (SIJ) is the joint between the sacrum and the ilium bones of the pelvis, which are connected by strong ligaments. In humans, the sacrum supports the spine and is supported in turn by an ilium on each side. The joint is strong, supporting the entire weight of the upper body. It is a synovial plane joint with irregular elevations and depressions that produce interlocking of the two bones. The human body has two sacroiliac joints, one on the left and one on the right, that often match each other but are highly variable from person to person.

==Structure==

Sacroiliac joints are paired C-shaped or L-shaped joints capable of a small amount of movement (2–18 degrees, which is debatable at this time) that are formed between the auricular surfaces of the sacrum and the ilium bones. However, most agree that only slight movements occur on these joints, with only 3 degrees range of motion during flexion-extension, followed by 1.5 degrees axial rotation, and 0.8 degrees lateral bending. The joints are covered by two different kinds of cartilage; the sacral surface has hyaline cartilage and the iliac surface has fibrocartilage. The SIJ&#x27;s stability is maintained mainly through a combination of only some bony structure and very strong intrinsic and extrinsic ligaments. The joint space is usually 0.5 to 4 mm.

Aging changes the characteristics of the sacroiliac joint. The joint&#x27;s surfaces are flat or planar in early life. Once walking ability is developed, the sacroiliac joint surfaces begin to develop distinct angular orientations and lose their planar or flat topography. They also develop an elevated ridge along the iliac surface and a depression along the sacral surface. The ridge and corresponding depression, along with the very strong ligaments, increase the sacroiliac joints&#x27; stability and makes dislocations very rare. The &quot;fossae lumbales laterales&quot; (&quot;dimples of Venus&quot;) correspond to the superficial topography of the sacroiliac joints.

===Ligaments===
The ligaments of the sacroiliac joint include the following:
* Anterior sacroiliac ligament
* Interosseous sacroiliac ligament
* Posterior sacroiliac ligament
* Sacrotuberous ligament
* Sacrospinous ligament

The anterior ligament is not much of a ligament at all and in most cases is just a slight thickening of the anterior joint capsule. The anterior ligament is thin and not as well defined as the posterior sacroiliac ligaments.

The posterior sacroiliac (SI) ligaments can be further divided into short (intrinsic) and long (extrinsic). The dorsal interosseous ligaments are very strong ligaments. They are often stronger than bone, such that the pelvis may actually fracture before the ligament tears. The dorsal sacroiliac ligaments include both long and short ligaments. The long dorsal sacroiliac joint ligaments run in an oblique vertical direction while the short (interosseous) runs perpendicular from just behind the articular surfaces of the sacrum to the ilium and functions to keep the sacroiliac joint from distracting or opening. The sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments (also known as the extrinsic sacroiliac joint ligaments) limit the amount the sacrum flexes.

The ligaments of the sacroiliac joint loosen during pregnancy due to the hormone relaxin; this loosening, along with that of the related symphysis pubis, permits the pelvic joints to widen during the birthing process. The long SI ligaments may be palpated in thin persons for pain and compared from one side of the body to the other; however, the reliability and the validity of comparing ligaments for pain have currently not been shown. The interosseous ligaments are very short and run perpendicular from the iliac surface to the sacrum, they keep the auricular surfaces from abducting or opening/distracting.

==Function==
Like most lower extremity joints, one of the SI joints&#x27; functions is shock absorption (depending on the amount of available motion at the sacroiliac joint) for the spine, along with the job of torque conversion allowing the transverse rotations that take place in the lower extremity to be transmitted up the spine. The SI joint, like all lower extremity joints, provides a &quot;self-locking&quot; mechanism (where the joint occupies or attains its most congruent position, also called the close pack position) that helps with stability during the push-off phase of walking. The joint locks (or rather becomes close packed) on one side as weight is transferred from one leg to the other, and through the pelvis the body weight is transmitted from the sacrum to the hip bone.

The motions of the sacroiliac joint
*Anterior innominate tilt of both hip bones on the sacrum (where the left and right move as a unit)
*Posterior innominate tilt of both hip bones on the sacrum (where the left and right move together as a unit)
*Anterior innominate tilt of one innominate bone while the opposite innominate bone tilts posteriorly on the sacrum (antagonistic innominate tilt) which occurs during gait
*Sacral flexion (or nutation) Motions of the sacrum occur simultaneous with motion of the ilium so you must be careful in the description of these as isolated motions.
*Sacral extension (or counter-nutation).

The sacroiliac joints like all spinal joints (except the atlanto-axial) are bicondylar joints, meaning that movement of one side corresponds to a correlative movement of the other side.

==Clinical significance==

===Inflammation and dysfunction===

Sacroiliitis refers to inflammation of one or both sacroiliac joints, and is one cause of low back pain. With sacroiliitis, the individual may experience pain in the low back, buttock or thigh, depending on the amount of inflammation.

Common mechanical problems of the sacroiliac joint are often called &quot;sacroiliac joint dysfunction&quot; (also termed SI joint dysfunction; SIJD). Sacroiliac joint dysfunction generally refers to pain in the sacroiliac joint region that is caused by abnormal motion in the sacroiliac joint—either too much or too little motion. It typically results in inflammation of the SI joint, or sacroiliitis.

===Signs and symptoms===
The following are signs and symptoms that may be associated with an SI joint (SIJ) problem:
*Mechanical SIJ dysfunction usually causes a dull unilateral low back pain.
*The pain is often a mild to moderate ache around the dimple or posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) region.
*The pain may become worse and sharp while doing activities such as standing up from a seated position or lifting the knee towards the chest during stair climbing.
*Pain is typically on one side or the other (unilateral PSIS pain), but the pain can occasionally be bilateral.
*When the pain of SIJ dysfunction is severe (which is infrequent), there can be referred pain into the hip, groin, and occasionally down the leg, but rarely does the pain radiate below the knee.
*Pain can be referred from the SIJ down into the buttock or back of the thigh, and rarely to the foot.
*Low back pain and stiffness, often unilateral, that often increases with prolonged sitting or prolonged walking.
*Pain may occur during sexual intercourse; however, this is not specific to just sacroiliac joint problems.
Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is tested using provocative and nonprovocative maneuvers. Nonprovocative sacroiliac joint examination maneuvers would include Gillet Test, prone knee flexion test, supine long sitting test, standing flexion test, and seated flexion test. There is a lack of evidence that these sacroiliac joint mobility maneuvers detect motion abnormalities.

Given the inherent technical limitations of the visible and palpable signs from these sacroiliac joint mobility maneuvers, another broad category of clinical signs has been described called provocative maneuvers. These maneuvers are designed to reproduce or increase pain originating from within the sacroiliac joint. 
When the provocative maneuvers reproduce pain along the typical area, it raises suspicion for sacroiliac joint dysfunction. However no single test is very reliable in diagnosing of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Weakness, numbness, or the loss of a related reflex may indicate nervous system damage.

The current gold standard for diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction emanating within the joint is sacroiliac joint injection confirmed under fluoroscopy or CT-guidance using a local anesthetic solution. The diagnosis is confirmed when the patient reports a significant change in relief from pain and the diagnostic injection is performed on 2 separate visits. Published studies have used at least a 75 percent change in relief of pain before a response is considered positive and the sacroiliac joint deemed the source of pain.

===Pregnancy===

Muscle imbalance, trauma (e.g., falling on the buttock) and hormonal changes can all lead to SIJ dysfunction. Sacroiliac joint pain may be felt anteriorly, however, care must be taken to differentiate this from hip joint pain.

Women are considered more likely to suffer from sacroiliac pain than men, mostly because of structural and hormonal differences between the sexes, but so far no credible evidence exists that confirms this notion. Female anatomy often allows one fewer sacral segment to lock with the pelvis, and this may increase instability.

<text>Naval Air Station Brunswick , also known as NAS Brunswick or the Brunswick Naval Air Station, was a military airport located southeast of Brunswick, Maine, with a number of Navy-operated maritime patrol aircraft. As of November 28, 2009, the last aircraft (P-3 Orions) left. The runways were permanently closed in January 2010. The base operated while the airport operated publicly under the name Brunswick Executive Airport until the base closed on May 31, 2011, as per the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure committee decision. Since then the base is known as Brunswick Landing. The Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority has been managing base redevelopment with high-tech business and industrial park. On April 2, 2011, the airport reopened as Brunswick Executive Airport.

==History==

The Brunswick airport was originally built in 1935 by the New Deal agency the Maine Emergency Relief Administration, a state division of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration after a survey of airports in the state by Capt. Harry M. Jones with the intention of building a chain of airports in coastal towns, inland towns, and lake resorts. It built 1 NW - SE 1800 x 50 gravel runway and 1 E - W 1800x100 graded runway.

===World War II===
Naval Air Station Brunswick was developed and occupied in March 1943, and was first commissioned on April 15, 1943, to train and form-up Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm squadrons with Vought Corsairs, Grumman Avengers and Grumman Hellcats. The 1,487-acre (6 km2) station was built in part on land that was donated by the town of Brunswick. By the early 1940s the town was using most of this land to operate a small municipal airport, which would become the core of the air station.
Operating under the motto, “Built For Business”, the first U.S. squadron to arrive at NAS Brunswick was a heavier-than-air Scouting Squadron (VS1D1). During World War II, pilots from NAS Brunswick as well as those of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm used the station as a base from which they carried out anti-submarine warfare missions with around-the-clock efficiency. The air station had a contingent from the Fleet Air Arm, but the squadrons also practiced at other Naval Auxiliary Air Facilities (NAAF) in Maine before eventual transport to Britain. The station was supporting the Casco Bay NAAF seaplane base on Long Island from May 14, 1943 to December 15, 1946 and auxiliary landing fields Lewiston NAAF until December 1, 1945, Sanford NAAF until February 1, 1946, Rockland NAAF until March 15, 1946, and Bar Harbor NAAF from September 1, 1943 until November 15, 1945. On August 15, 1945 Japan surrendered to Allied forces, ending the war. As a result, NAS Brunswick was scheduled for deactivation.

===Cold War===
The air station was deactivated in October 1946, the land was reverted to caretaker status, and the land and buildings leased jointly to the University of Maine and Bowdoin College. When the station’s facilities were no longer required, the University of Maine and Bowdoin College terminated their leases and in 1949, operations at NAS Brunswick were taken over by the Brunswick Flying Service. This commercial deviation was short-lived however, when the Navy selected the station as a potential center for development of “Services to the Fleet”. Plans were soon placed on the drawing boards to make this a thriving operational air station.

On March 15, 1951, the National Ensign was hoisted, re-commissioning the station as a Naval Air Facility. The station soon became a beehive of activity, as it was slated to become a Master Jet Base. New construction around the base was begun which included dual 8,000-foot runways, and new facilities to replace the temporary structures of World War II, including a modern operations tower capable of handling all the complex flights of a full-scale Naval Air Station. Two outlying fields were also planned to be built, one for gunnery and one for carrier practice landings.
On June 15, 1950, North Korea on Chinese authorization crossed the 38th parallel and invaded their neighbors in South Korea. Acting quickly and on little notice, the American military reversed the post-World War II trend of reduction-in-forces and several subordinate commands stationed at NAS Brunswick were re-commissioned. While not directly involved in combat operations in Korea, its squadrons contributed to the war effort by assuming the many responsibilities of commands who had been deployed to the Pacific.
In 1959, NAS Brunswick’s primary mission was support of Fleet Air Wing Three which was composed of Patrol Squadrons Seven, Ten, Eleven, Twenty One, Twenty Three, and Twenty Six. Flying the P2V Neptune and PB4Y-2 Privateer, the squadrons played a major part in the defense of the North Atlantic area, tracking Soviet submarines around the clock throughout the Cold War.
In 1962, NAS Brunswick and Fleet Air Wing Five began the transition to the P-3A Orion marking the beginning of a new era in Naval Patrol Aviation. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and more encompassing, during the entirety of the Cold War between American and Soviet forces, both the P2V and P-3A became nationally well-known due to their surveillance of Soviet ships in the Atlantic Ocean, leading to a safe resolution.
Fleet Air Wing Five aircraft also played an important part in America’s early crewed space programs in 1965 and 1966, helping to locate Mercury and Gemini capsules after splashdowns.
In 1966, Wing Five began deployments in the Western Pacific. Based at Naval Station Sangley Point in the Philippines, squadrons flew patrol and combat missions in support of Seventh Fleet operations in South East Asia throughout the years of U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
On August 2 of 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein launched an invasion on the neighboring country of Kuwait. In response, the United States launched a wholly defensive mission to the Middle East named Operation Desert Shield. Patrol Squadron Twenty Three was the first East Coast maritime patrol squadron in-theater for Operation Desert Shield, providing maritime surveillance throughout the Red Sea. Patrol Squadron EIGHT participated in joint operations during Desert Storm, flying combat sorties in the effort to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi forces.

===Post Cold War===
At the end of the Cold War in 1991, many maritime patrol squadrons were reduced or relocated. Combat Wing Five disestablished Patrol Squadron 44 in May 1991, Patrol Squadron 23 in December 1994, and Patrol Squadron 11 in August 1997.
During the mid-1990s with the breakup and subsequent conflict in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, Patrol Squadrons 8, 10, 11, 26 from NAS Brunswick were called upon to fly countless sorties in the Adriatic Sea in support of Operation Sharp Guard. Of specific note, Patrol Squadron 10 was the first VP squadron to conduct offensive missile attacks since Vietnam in the 1970s. In 1994, 10,138 enlisted, officers, civilian employees, and family members called NAS Brunswick home.
In the early years of the new millennium, squadrons home ported at NAS Brunswick continued to fulfill their missions by flying intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and maritime patrol sorties in Operation Joint Guardian in Kosovo and Operation Deliberate Forge in Bosnia in support of U.S. and NATO forces. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the U.S., those same squadrons began flying missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in the Middle East.

NAS Brunswick-based crews flew homeland defense maritime patrols off the Atlantic coast as part of Operation Noble Eagle and additional assets were surged in support of OEF operations. Fleet Air Wing Five squadrons were present during the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, and continue to fly in support of ongoing operations.

On October 21, 2008, a P-3 Orion from Patrol Wing Five overshot the runway at Bagram Air Base while landing. The aircraft caught fire and was destroyed but the only injury to the crew was one broken ankle. The aircraft was assigned to CTF-57 in Afghanistan.

===Closure===

After being listed on the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure list, NAS Brunswick began preparing itself for shut down with a mandated September 2011 closure date. In May 2008, Captain Will Fitzgerald relieved Captain George Womack, becoming NAS Brunswick’s 36th and final Commanding Officer, and was tasked with the responsibility of closing the base. In September 2008, NAS Brunswick hosted the 33rd Great State of Maine Air Show for the last time, which boasted an attendance of more than 150,000 people from the local area and out of state. The air show will be held again in August 2017, without the support of a military base. In November 2008, the Patrol Squadron 8 Tigers were the first Fleet Air Wing Five squadron to permanently leave NAS Brunswick on deployment, scheduled to return to their new home port of NAS Jacksonville, Florida. May 2009 saw the last squadron Changes of Command held on base when the reins of the Patrol Squadron 26 Tridents and the Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 62 Nor’Easters (having since been renamed the Nomads) were handed over to new Commanding Officers. In June 2009, the Patrol Squadron 10 Red Lancers departed Brunswick for their new home port of NAS Jacksonville, followed by Special Projects Patrol Squadron 1 and Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 62 in July. The last squadron to leave NAS Brunswick was Patrol Squadron 26, which made their final departures late November 2009. After that, no other aircraft were based at NAS Brunswick.The closure of the NAS Brunswick air field was scheduled for just after the departure of VP-26, which lead directly to the disestablishment of Fleet Air Wing Five in March of the same year. NAS Brunswick no longer supports any home based squadrons. There are still approximately 1681 officers, sailors, and civilian employees actively working on base.

December 23, 2009 marked the last day of Navy Reserve activity at NAS Brunswick when the Navy Operational Support Center lowered the National Ensign and closed its doors for the last time. Captain Scott F. Walton, the NOSC Commanding Officer, had previously been the last C.O. of Patrol Squadron VP-92 Minutemen, a Navy Reserve squadron made up of many local Maine citizens. VP-92 operated out of NAS Brunswick from 1996 to 2007.
At an onsite ceremony on May 31, 2011 the base was officially decommissioned. Navy officials handed over the remaining property to the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority. Property is being redeveloped for civilian use as Brunswick Landing. This started with the opening of the Brunswick Executive Airport. Southern Maine Community College has built a new campus on the site.

==Environmental problems==
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared the base a Superfund Site in 1987 for chemical contamination after open-air detonation of ordnance. From 2007 until 2015, the Navy assessed and removed ordnance from the area, spending $3–4 million on site clean-up. In July 2015, EPA declared the area safe with so called &quot;land use controls&quot;, such as signs and fencing.

In September 2015, it became known that the Navy’s closure draft report mentioned contamination with perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs). They had been &quot;recorded at levels above the EPA’s provisional health advisory&quot;, a number derived from lab tests on animals, at several places, many of which were associated with past use of PFC-containing fire-fighting foam, such as areas around the airplane runway and between hangars. Groundwater is contaminated at the former fire department building and the foam storage building. Restoration Advisory Board members criticized the land use control plan as insufficient, after PFCs found in well water at Pease Air Force Base in neighboring New Hampshire had exposed people including children as blood monitoring has shown.
The Air Force had been testing 82 former and active installations nationwide for PFCs.

<doc id="884734" wikidata="Q672371" url="?curid=884734" title="United States congressional delegations from Idaho">
<text>Since Idaho became a U.S. state in 1890, it has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives, beginning with the 51st United States Congress. Prior to 1890, Idaho sent non-voting delegates to the House of Representatives from 1864 to 1889. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years in general elections, with their re-election staggered. Prior to the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, senators were elected by the Idaho Legislature. Each state elects a varying number of, but at least one, member of the House, depending on population, to two-year terms. Idaho has sent two members to the House in each congressional delegation since the 1910 United States Census.

A total of 63 unique individuals have represented Idaho in Congress; Idaho has had 26 senators and 44 representatives, and 7 have served in both the House and the Senate. Two women from Idaho, Gracie Pfost and Helen Chenoweth, have served in the House, while none have served in the Senate.

Mike Crapo is currently the dean, or longest-serving member of Congress, of the Idaho delegation, having served in Congress since his election to the House of Representatives in 1992. Since 1998, he has been serving in the Senate. Crapo is the second-longest serving senator in Idaho history, after William Borah.

== Current delegation ==

Idaho&#x27;s current congressional delegation in the consists of its two senators and two representatives, all of whom are Republicans. Idaho has not elected a Democratic member of Congress since Walt Minnick was elected in 2008; he was defeated by Republican Raúl Labrador two years later in 2010.

As of April 2023, the Cook Partisan Voting Index, a measure of how strongly partisan a state is, ranked both House districts and both Senate races in Idaho as solidly Republican.

The dean, or longest-serving member of Congress, of the Idaho delegation is currently Mike Crapo, who has been serving in Congress since his election to the House of Representatives in 1992. After serving in the House for three terms, he was elected to the Senate in 1998. Crapo is the second-longest serving senator in Idaho history, after William Borah, and is the first member of the Church of Latter-Day Saints to represent Idaho in the Senate. Mike Simpson, who represents Idaho&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, is tied with Burton L. French as the longest-serving representative from Idaho, both having been elected for thirteen terms.
==United States Senate==
26 people have served as a U.S. senator from Idaho, all of them men. The longest-serving senator from Idaho, William Borah, was an influential Republican legislator who eventually became the dean of the Senate during his 33 years of service. He was known for his political views independent of the Republican Party and influence on the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, eventually becoming its chairman. He was instrumental in the passage of the Sixteenth and the Seventeenth Amendments, establishing the graduated income tax and popular election of Senators, respectively, but opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which prohibited disenfranchisement the right to vote on account of sex. The last Democratic senator from Idaho was Frank Church, who similarly served for 24 years on the Foreign Relations Committee, including two years as chairman. He also served as chairman of the Church Committee, whose reports helped pass the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Senator Jim McClure also rose to leadership positions, including as the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference from 1981 to 1985, and as the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

Senators are elected every six years depending on their class, with each senator serving a six-year term, and elections for senators occurring every two years, rotating through each class such that in each election, around one-third of the seats in the Senate are up for election. Idaho&#x27;s senators are elected in classes II and III.


== United States House of Representatives ==


Since the establishment of Idaho Territory, 44 people have served Idaho in the House of Representatives. Of those, only two have been women: Gracie Pfost, who served in the House from 1953 to 1962, and Helen Chenoweth, who served in the House from 1995 to 2000. No African-Americans have ever served Idaho in the House.

From 1864 to 1890, Idaho elected a non-voting delegate to the House. After statehood in 1890, the state sent one member to the House until 1913, when Idaho gained a seat in the House after the 1910 census. The representatives were elected at-large until Idaho&#x27;s congressional districts were drawn in 1919. Idaho has sent two members to the House in each congressional delegation since then. One member of the House of Representatives is sent from each district via a popular vote. Districts are redrawn every ten years, after data from the US Census is collected.

=== 1864–1890: 1 non-voting delegate ===
Starting on February 1, 1864, Idaho Territory sent a non-voting delegate to the House.



=== 1890–1913: 1 seat ===
Following statehood on July 3, 1890, Idaho had one seat in the House.


=== 1913–present: 2 seats ===
Following the 1910 census, Idaho was apportioned a second seat. It elected both seats statewide at-large on a general ticket, until 1919, when it redistricted into two districts.

<text>An Affair to Remember is a 1957 American romance film directed by Leo McCarey and starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Filmed in CinemaScope, it was distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is considered among the most romantic films of all time according to the American Film Institute. The film was a remake of McCarey&#x27;s 1939 film &quot;Love Affair&quot;, starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer.

==Plot==
Nickie Ferrante, a well-known playboy, meets Terry McKay aboard the transatlantic ocean liner en route from Europe to New York. Each is romantically involved with someone else. After a series of meetings aboard the ship, they establish a friendship. When Terry joins Nickie on a brief visit to his grandmother Janou while the ship is anchored near her home at Villefranche-sur-Mer on the Mediterranean coast, she sees Nickie with new eyes and their feelings become deeper. During their visit, Janou tells Terry that Nickie is a talented painter but destroys most of his paintings because they don&#x27;t meet his standards. As the ship returns to New York City, they agree to reunite at the top of the Empire State Building in six months&#x27; time if they have succeeded in ending their relationships and starting new careers.

On the day of their rendezvous, Terry, hurrying to reach the Empire State Building, is struck down by a car while crossing a street. Gravely injured, she is rushed to the hospital. Meanwhile, Nickie, waiting for her at the observation deck at the top of the building, is unaware of the accident and, after many hours, leaves at midnight, believing that she has rejected him.

After the accident, Terry, now unable to walk, refuses to contact Nickie because of her disability. Instead, she finds work as a music teacher. Nickie has pursued his painting and has his work displayed by Courbet, an art gallery owner. Six months after the accident, Terry sees Nickie with his former fiancée at the ballet. Nickie does not notice her condition because she is seated, and they both say hello.

Nickie learns Terry&#x27;s address and on Christmas Eve pays her a surprise visit. Although he tries to coax her to explain her actions, Terry dodges the subject, never leaving the couch on which she lies. He gives Terry a shawl that Janou, who has died, left for her. As he is leaving, Nickie mentions a painting on which he had been working when they first met, and that it was just given away to a woman who liked it but had no money. He is about to say that the woman was in a wheelchair when he pauses, suddenly suspecting why Terry has been lying still on the couch. He walks into her bedroom and sees the painting hanging on the wall, realizing that she was the woman in the wheelchair. The film ends with the two in a tight embrace as Terry says, &quot;If you can paint, I can walk. Anything can happen, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;

==Cast==
* Cary Grant as Nickie Ferrante
* Deborah Kerr as Terry McKay
* Richard Denning as Kenneth Bradley
* Neva Patterson as Lois Clark
* Cathleen Nesbitt as Janou (Nickie&#x27;s grandmother)
* Robert Q. Lewis as himself (announcer)
* Charles Watts as Ned Hathaway
* Fortunio Bonanova as Courbet
* Marni Nixon as Terry McKay&#x27;s singing voice

==Production==
The film was a remake of McCarey&#x27;s 1939 film &quot;Love Affair&quot;, starring Irene Dunne as Terry and Charles Boyer as the Gallic playboy Michel Marnet. Plans for a &quot;Love Affair&quot; remake were first reported in 1952, which had Fernando Lamas and Arlene Dahl attached to the project.

Cary Grant first worked with McCarey on &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; and did not like McCarey&#x27;s improvisational strategy, but after eventually warming to it, he wished that he had starred in &quot;Love Affair&quot;, and he often visited the set during production. He enjoyed the film when it was released and convinced McCarey years later to remake it starring Grant in Boyer&#x27;s role. McCarey later commented: &quot;Hollywood films all seem to be trying to find a trick way of saying &#x27;I love you.&#x27; What are they trying to prove? Love is the oldest and noblest emotion.&quot; &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; was almost identical to the original on a scene-to-scene basis. McCarey used the same screenplay as was employed for the original film, written by Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart, but Stewart was not included in the credits because he had been blacklisted. Filming took place between February and April 1957.

Grant was reportedly grumpy during filming because his hypnotherapy with his wife caused him to dislike smoking. He also underwent an operation during production to treat a lump on his forehead that resulted from a childhood injury.

The theme song &quot;An Affair to Remember (Our Love Affair),&quot; composed by Harry Warren and with lyrics by Leo McCarey and Harold Adamson, was sung by Vic Damone over the opening credits and by Marni Nixon (who dubbed Kerr) during the film.

==Songs==
* &quot;An Affair to Remember (Our Love Affair)&quot; sung by Vic Damone
* &quot;Continué,&quot; sung by Marni Nixon (dubbing for Deborah Kerr)
* &quot;The Tiny Scout (He Knows You Inside Out)&quot; sung by Marni Nixon (dubbing for Deborah Kerr)
* &quot;Tomorrow Land&quot; sung by Marni Nixon (dubbing for Deborah Kerr)
* &quot;You Make It Easy to Be True&quot;
All of the above;
* Music by Harry Warren
* Lyrics by Harold Adamson and Leo McCarey

==Novelization==
In anticipation of the film&#x27;s release, Avon Books published a paperback novelization of the screenplay. The byline Owen Aherne was a pseudonym for American novelist R.V. Cassill.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the early part of the film fairly enjoyable, with &quot;plenty of humorous conversation that is handled crisply&quot; by the leads, but concluded that the picture goes wrong after the couple disembarks, writing: &quot;The marriage pact seems ridiculously childish for a couple of adult people to make. The lady&#x27;s failure to notify her fiancé of her accident seems absurd. The fact that the man does not hear of it in some way is beyond belief. And the slowness with which he grasps the obvious when he calls upon the lady is just too thick.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; agreed, writing that the film &quot;boasts early amusing reels that ultimately become unbelievably foolish in the quest for audience tears.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; disagreed, calling the romance &quot;never maudlin&quot; and &quot;wholly believable&quot; in a positive review of what it called &quot;a winning film&quot; with &quot;all the ingredients that should make it an ideal women&#x27;s picture.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; was also positive, calling it &quot;more enchanting and delightful than the original&quot; and &quot;so powerful in the closing scenes that one is unable to fight back the tears.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was dismissive, writing that the actors were &quot;tolerable, but the movie is really awfully maudlin.&quot; A generally positive review in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called the film &quot;a lush slice of Hollywood romanticism, unashamedly following most of the familiar conventions of glossy magazine fiction. To judge it on a higher level would normally seem unfair if it were not that here the script does succeed in cutting rather deeper. The relationship between Ferrante and Terry McKay is briskly developed, with an attractive, often touching humor.&quot; The &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; review invoked the 1939 original: &quot;18 years ago we wept and worried over the romantic pangs of Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer in &#x27;Love Affair.&#x27; It seems distinctly unimportant now when misunderstandings disrupt the billing and cooing of Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant in &#x27;An Affair to Remember,&#x27; Leo McCarey&#x27;s interminably extended version of &#x27;Love Affair&#x27;.&quot;

The film holds a 67% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews. In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100. It is one of the BFI&#x27;s &quot;50 great Christmas films currently streaming&quot;.

<text>Ozias Leduc (October 8, 1864 - June 16, 1955) is one of Quebec&#x27;s early painters. He was born in Saint-Hilaire-de-Rouville. Leduc produced many portraits and landscapes.

==Biography==
Leduc was mainly self-taught. Around 1880, he worked with Luigi Cappello, an Italian painter, on church decorations. Around 1881, he was employed at Carli, a manufacturer of statues in Montreal. Around 1883, he worked with Adolphe Rho, decorating another church, this time in Yamachiche. After that, he started working on his own on church decorations. Leduc made a brief trip to Paris and London in 1897 with Suzor-Coté, where he was influenced by the Impressionists. Leduc lived a very solitary life in his home town and was dubbed &quot;the sage of St-Hilaire&quot;. He received an Honorary doctorate from the Université de Montréal in 1938. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. His legacy includes teaching Paul-Émile Borduas. He died in Saint-Hyacinthe in 1955.

==Works==


He is best known for his work decorating the Notre-Dame-de-la-Présentation church in Shawinigan South, Quebec, a project which took him thirteen years, until his death. The work was completed by his assistant, Gabrielle Messier. Notre-Dame-de-la-Présentation church was designated a National Historic Site in 2004 and a federal marker reflecting that status was erected at the church in 2005.

==Recognition==
On May 20, 1988, Canada Post issued &#x27;The Young Reader, Ozias Leduc, 1894&#x27; in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on a painting &quot;The Young Student&quot; (1894) by Ozias Leduc in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario. The painting shows the Ozias Leduc&#x27;s younger brother, concentrating on a picture book, pencil in hand. The 50¢ stamps are perforated 13 X 13.5 and were printed by British American Bank Note Company.

Leduc was named a National Historic Person on January 12, 2018. There are streets named after him in Shawinigan-Sud and Drummondville, a park in Lévis and a secondary school in Mont-Saint-Hilaire.

<text>Thai Americans (; formerly referred to as Siamese Americans) are Americans of Thai ancestry. The Thai American population is racially and ethnically diverse, consisting of many Thais who identify as mixed race.

==History in the United States==
Siamese people were named as one of the many Asian groups excluded from immigrating to the United States by the Immigration Act of 1917. The law was one of many provisions restricting Asian immigration to the United States in the early 20th century.

The 1930 Census recorded just 18 Siamese Americans. According to the MPI Data Hub, there have been a total of 253,585 Thai people who have immigrated to the United States as of 2016. That year, they were 0.0057% of all immigrants. In comparing data from the MPI Data Hub to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are significant inconsistencies of total current population. According to the U.S. Census, there are currently 300,319 Thai people living in the United States today, with an error margin of +/- 14,326.

Thai immigration to the United States proceeded very slowly. It began in earnest during and after the Vietnam War, in which Thailand was an ally of the United States and South Vietnam. Records show that, in the decade between 1960 and 1970, some 5,000 Thais immigrated to the United States. In the following decade, the number increased to 44,000. From 1981 to 1990, approximately 64,400 Thai citizens moved to the United States.

The general trend of Thai immigration can be stated at a relatively steady rising pace save for the peak in 2006, which marks the dissolution of the Thai Parliament in February and a subsequent coup in the following September. From 2007 to 2008, numbers dip back down to regular rate until 2009, which proceeded a year of military and political turmoil due to the disconnect between the monarchic Royal Army and the relatively newly established democratic government in 2006.

According to the 2000 census there were 150,093 Thais in the United States.

In 2009, 304,160 U.S. residents listed themselves as Thais.

==Demographics==
Los Angeles, California, has the largest Thai population outside of Asia. It is home to the world&#x27;s first Thai Town. In 2002, it was estimated that over 80,000 Thais and Thai Americans live in Los Angeles. Other large or sizeable Thai communities are in Clark County, Nevada; Cook County, Illinois; Tarrant County, Texas; Orange County, California; San Bernardino County, California; San Diego County, California; San Francisco, California; Fresno, California; Sacramento, California; King County, Washington; Fairfax County, Virginia; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Albuquerque, NM; Queens, New York; Madison, Wisconsin; Seattle, Washington; and Montgomery County, Maryland. The 2010 U.S. census counted 237,629 Thai Americans in the country, of whom 67,707 live in California.

==Cultural influence on America==
Thai Americans are famous for bringing Thai cooking to the United States. Thai cuisine is popular across the country. Even non-Thai restaurants may include Thai-influenced dishes on their menu like Pad Thai and Thai tea.

Thai culture&#x27;s prominence in the United States is disproportionate to their numbers. The stationing of American troops in Thailand during the Vietnam War exposed the GIs to Thai culture and cuisine, and many of them came home with Thai wives.

==Political involvement==
In 2003, two Thai Americans ran in municipal elections, one in Anaheim, California, the other in Houston, Texas. Both lost.
However, on November 7, 2006, Gorpat Henry Charoen became the first U.S. official of Thai origin when he was elected to the La Palma City Council in California. On December 18, 2007, he became the first Thai-American mayor of a U.S. city.

In 2010, Charles Djou became the first Thai American elected to Congress; he had previously served in the Hawaii State House and Honolulu City Council.

Tammy Duckworth, a Thai-American Iraq War veteran, ran for Congress as a Democrat in Illinois&#x27;s 6th district in the 2006 mid-term election. She was narrowly defeated, and served for two years as Assistant Secretary of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. She was previously the director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. She was considered a likely nominee for appointment to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by Barack Obama&#x27;s election to the Presidency of the United States; however, Roland Burris was appointed instead. On November 6, 2012 Duckworth was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to represent the 8th District of Illinois. On November 8, 2016, she was elected as the junior U.S. senator from Illinois, the seat previously held by Barack Obama.

Bhumibol Adulyadej, the previous King of Thailand, was born at the Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on December 5, 1927. At the time, his father was studying at Harvard University. He is the only American-born monarch in history.

In 2017, Ekamon &quot;Ek&quot; Venin was appointed and later elected to the Borough Council in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. In 2020, he served as Council President and was re-elected to another 3-year term.

<doc id="884756" wikidata="Q21869946" url="?curid=884756" title="The Ugly American">
<text>The Ugly American is a 1958 political novel by Eugene Burdick and William Lederer that depicts the failures of the U.S. diplomatic corps in Southeast Asia.

The book caused a sensation in diplomatic circles and had major political implications. The Peace Corps was established during the Kennedy administration partly as a result of the book. The bestseller has remained continuously in print and is one of the most influential American political novels. It has been called an &quot;iconic Cold War text.&quot;

==Background==
===Authors===
William Lederer was an American author and captain in the U.S. Navy who served as special assistant to the commander in chief of U.S. forces in the Pacific and Asian theater.

Eugene Burdick was an American political scientist, novelist, and non-fiction writer, and served in the Navy during World War II. The two met in the build-up to the Vietnam War.

The authors were disillusioned with the style and substance of U.S. diplomatic efforts in Southeast Asia. They sought to demonstrate through their writings their belief that American officials and civilians could make a substantial difference in Southeast Asian politics if they were willing to learn local languages, follow local customs and employ regional military tactics.

===Historical and political===

The book was very much a product of its times and historical context.

In 1958 the Cold War was in full force, pitting the two geopolitical giants, the United States and the Soviet Union, against each other for military and geopolitical influence and dominance. NATO and the Warsaw Pact divided Europe into two competing visions of the world: the Western world viewed countries in the Eastern Bloc as behind an Iron Curtain, as evidenced by the failed Hungarian Revolution. The Eastern Bloc countered by portraying itself as the liberator of countries that were still in thrall to colonialist machinations, as evidenced by banana republics. The nuclear arms race was underway with the U.S. well ahead initially, but by 1955, the Soviets had exploded a hydrogen bomb and were beginning to catch up, sparking fears of nuclear armageddon.

The Soviet launching of Sputnik into orbit in 1957 gave the Soviets a huge technological and propaganda victory and sparked a crisis of confidence in the United States and worries about falling behind technologically and militarily. In Asia, the French had left Indochina in 1954 after their defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the U.S. became involved in Vietnam to fill the perceived power vacuum. The U.S. and the Soviets struggled for preeminence in the Third World through proxies in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

In the Middle East, the U.S. feared the spread of Communism starting in Egypt and attempted to secure the region&#x27;s most populous and politically powerful country for the West by guarantees of funding for construction of the Aswan Dam, but it was eventually the Soviets who prevailed. Soviet diplomatic and political successes in the Third World left the West worried about losing one country after another to Communism according to the domino theory invoked by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

It was in this atmosphere of fear, mistrust, and uncertainty in the United States about Soviet military and technological might and Communist political success in unaligned nations of the Third World that the novel was published in 1958, with an immediate impact.

Lyman Kirkpatrick, Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency thought it wise to alert the Director of Central Intelligence to send a memo when the book was published and serialized by the Saturday Evening Post. The &quot;Foreign Service Journal&quot;, a monthly publication of the American Foreign Service Association, commented in the Editorial Page that &quot;no thoughtful reader will be able to dismiss &#x27;The Ugly American&#x27; lightly because, with all its errors and distortions, it still states candidly a problem which has long been debated within the Foreign Service itself.&quot;

==Content==

The book depicts the failures of the U.S. diplomatic corps, whose insensitivity to local language, culture, and customs and refusal to integrate were in marked contrast to the polished abilities of Eastern Bloc (primarily Soviet) diplomacy and led to Communist diplomatic success overseas. 

===Literary structure===

====Title====
The title of the novel is a play on Graham Greene&#x27;s 1955 novel &quot;The Quiet American&quot; and was sometimes confused with it.

The &quot;Ugly American&quot; of the book title refers to the book&#x27;s hero, plain-looking engineer Homer Atkins, whose &quot;calloused and grease-blackened hands always reminded him that he was an ugly man.&quot; Atkins, who lives with the local people, comes to understand their needs, and offers genuinely useful assistance with small-scale projects such as the development of a simple bicycle-powered water pump.

====Setting====
The novel takes place in a fictional nation called Sarkhan (an imaginary country in Southeast Asia that somewhat resembles Laos, but which is meant to allude to Vietnam) and includes several real people, most of whose names have been changed. The book describes the United States&#x27; losing struggle against Communism because of the ineptitude and the bungling of the U.S. diplomatic corps stemming from innate arrogance and their failure to understand the local culture. The book implies that the Communists were successful because they practiced tactics similar to those of protagonist Homer Atkins.

====Category and structure ====
The book is written as a series of interrelated vignettes. It was originally commissioned by the publisher as a work of nonfiction, but was changed to a fictionalized novel at an editor&#x27;s suggestion. The authors say in the introduction that the work represents &quot;the rendering of fact into fiction.&quot;

===Plot summary===
In one vignette, a Burmese journalist says, &quot;For some reason, the [American] people I meet in my country are not the same as the ones I knew in the United States. A mysterious change seems to come over Americans when they go to a foreign land. They isolate themselves socially. They live pretentiously. They are loud and ostentatious.&quot;

The American Ambassador &quot;Lucky&quot; Lou Sears confines himself to his comfortable diplomatic compound in the capital. The Soviet ambassador speaks the local language and understands the local culture. He informs his Moscow superiors that Sears &quot;keeps his people tied up with meetings, social events, and greeting and briefing the scores of senators, congressmen, generals, admirals, under secretaries of state and defense, and so on, who come pouring through here to &#x27;look for themselves.&#x27;&quot; Sears undermines the creative efforts to head off the communist insurgency.

===Characters in real life===
According to an article published in &quot;Newsweek&quot; in May 1959, the &quot;real&quot; &quot;Ugly American&quot; was identified as an International Cooperation Administration technician named Otto Hunerwadel, who, with his wife Helen, served in Burma from 1949 until his death in 1952. They lived in the villages, where they taught farming techniques, and helped to start home canning industries.

Another of the book&#x27;s characters, Colonel Hillandale, appears to have been modeled on the real-life U.S. Air Force Major General Edward Lansdale, who was an expert in counter-guerrilla operations.

===Popularity===
The book was serialized in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in the Fall of 1958, and came out as a Book of the Month Club selection in October.

The book became an instant bestseller, going through 20 printings from July to November 1958, remaining on the bestseller list for a year and a half, and ultimately selling four million copies. The book caused a sensation in diplomatic circles. John F. Kennedy was so impressed with the book that he sent a copy to each of his colleagues in the United States Senate. The book was one of the biggest bestsellers in the U.S., has been in print continuously since it appeared, and is one of the most politically influential novels in all of American literature.

After the book had gained wide readership, the term &quot;Ugly American&quot; came to be used to refer to the &quot;loud and ostentatious&quot; type of visitor in another country rather than the &quot;plain looking folks, who are not afraid to &#x27;get their hands dirty&#x27; like Homer Atkins&quot; to whom the book itself referred.

===Reviews===
Given the mood of fear and uncertainty in the U.S. at the time due to Sputnik and other perceived failures in the struggles of the Cold War, a book about diplomatic failures in Southeast Asia was well-aligned with the Zeitgeist and primed to catch attention. The book was lavishly praised in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, with reviewers adding their own anecdotes about boorish behavior on the part of Americans abroad. A reviewer in &quot;Catholic World&quot; linked it to &quot;The Quiet American&quot; and said that the book was trying to answer some of the questions raised by Greene&#x27;s book.

Reviews in some news or opinion publications reflected the varying opinions extant during the Cold War public debate. A reviewer in &quot;Time&quot; called it a &quot;crude series of black-and-white-cartoons&quot; while the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, and &quot;The Nation&quot; also disapproved of overly simplistic characters.

===Impact===

====Contemporary reaction====
The book was published in the waning days of the Eisenhower administration. Reportedly as a result of the book, Eisenhower ordered an investigation of the U.S. foreign aid program. As the presidential campaign of 1960 heated up, the issues raised in the book became a campaign issue for the Democratic Party.

====Presidential politics====
Lasting impacts in the Kennedy administration included President Kennedy&#x27;s national physical fitness program, his statement of America&#x27;s willingness to &quot;bear any burden&quot; in the Third World, the founding of the Peace Corps, the build-up of American Special Forces, and emphasis on counterinsurgency tactics in fighting communists in South Vietnam. According to British documentary film maker Adam Curtis, Senator and future U.S. President &quot;John F. Kennedy was gripped by &quot;The Ugly American&quot;. In 1960, he and five other opinion leaders bought a large advertisement in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saying that they had sent copies of the novel to every U.S. senator because its message was so important.&quot;

President Lyndon Baines Johnson made reference to the term Ugly American in his Great Society speech to a 1964 university graduating class, and it was by then used as a pejorative expression for generally offensive behavior by Americans abroad.

====Peace Corps====
Senator Hubert Humphrey first introduced a bill in Congress in 1957 for the formation of a Peace Corps aimed primarily at development in the Third World, but &quot;it did not meet with much enthusiasm&quot; and the effort failed. The &quot;Ugly American&quot; was published the following year. Senator Kennedy first mentioned the idea of creating a Peace Corps during his campaign for President in 1960 and in March 1961, two months after his inauguration, Kennedy announced the establishment of the Peace Corps. Kennedy and other members of the administration viewed the Peace Corps as their answer to the problems described in &quot;The Ugly American&quot;.

====Criticism====
Presidents, Senators, and Congressmen alluded to the book or quoted from it, either as commentary or to further their objectives, or to criticize it. Senator J. William Fulbright, powerful chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, criticized the book from the Senate floor, declaring that it contained &quot;phony&quot; claims of incompetence, and that it was a follow-up to McCarthy era treason charges. Historian Daniel Immerwahr wrote that the book promoted the idea that Americans, if they conducted themselves properly, could solve the problems of the Third World.

====Long-term impact====
The title entered the English language for a type of character portrayed in the book. The book is one of a very few works of fiction that had a profound and lasting impact on American political debate, along with such works as &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; and &quot;The Jungle&quot;.

In 2009 an article appeared in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; about the book&#x27;s impact since it was first published. The reviewer wrote that &quot;the book&#x27;s enduring resonance may say less about its literary merits than about its failure to change American attitudes. Today, as the battle for hearts and minds has shifted to the Middle East, we still can&#x27;t speak Sarkhanese.&quot;

A 2011 book on Arab–American relations took its title in part from the book, recalled the sense of diplomatic bungling in Southeast Asia portrayed in the book, and pointed out that many Arab commentators likened American mistakes in Iraq to those in Southeast Asia.

==Related works==

Lederer and Burdick later published a 1965 novel called &quot;Sarkhan&quot;, about the Communist threat and Washington politics in Southeast Asia. After thousands of copies which had been available in bookstores seemed to disappear from the shelves, the authors became convinced that government agencies were behind an attempt to suppress the book. After a decade of unavailability, it was republished in 1977 under the title &quot;The Deceptive American&quot;.

== 1963 film ==
The film version of the novel was made in 1963 and starred Marlon Brando as Ambassador Harrison Carter MacWhite. The &quot;Ugly American&quot; received mixed reviews and did poorly at the box office.

<text>The Snoqualmie Indian Tribe () is a federally recognized tribe of Snoqualmie people. They are Coast Salish Native American peoples from the Snoqualmie Valley in east King and Snohomish Counties in Washington state. Other names for the Snoqualmies include Snoqualmu, Snoqualmoo, Snoqualmick, Snoqualamuke, and Snuqualmi.

==History==
Some Snoqualmies settled onto the Tulalip Reservation after signing the Point Elliott Treaty with the Washington Territory in 1855, but many remained in their ancestral homelands around the Snoqualmie Valley and Lake Sammamish. At that time they were one of the largest tribes in the Puget Sound region numbering around 4,000. In 1937 the Federal Government proposed granting a reservation though in the end the land was never given. The tribe lost federal recognition in 1953. In October 1999, the Bureau of Indian Affairs once again granted recognition to the Snoqualmie.

They purchased land for and were granted a reservation near Snoqualmie, Washington, on which the tribe opened the Snoqualmie Casino in 2008. They have tried and failed on several occasions to secure a reservation on their ancestral lands along the Tolt River (a tributary of the Snoqualmie River) until the Snoqualmie Tribe Ancestral Forest was purchased by the tribe at the end of 2021. The in East King County holds environmental, economic, and historic value to the tribe. The land, most recently used for industrial timber, will be sustainably harvested while the ecosystem is managed to support the native plant and wildlife populations.

== Government ==
The Snoqualmie Tribe is governed by a Tribal constitution and an elected Council. The Tribe&#x27;s governing structure includes building codes, health codes and other standard governmental functions.
