<text>There are approximately thirteen nationally recognized public holidays in Ghana, a sub-Saharan country in Africa. The primary National holiday is Independence Day, which is on 6 March. It is a National Day and is set to honor the memory of Ghana&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in 1957.

This is a list of [[public holidays]] in [[Ghana]].

== National holidays ==
== Notes ==
# Introduced by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, National Farmers&#x27; Day was organized as a day’s activity for the nation to honor its hard working farmers, with certificates and prizes, who excelled in their contributions to improve the agricultural sector. In 1988, the first Friday of every December was designated by the government as &quot;Farmers&#x27; Day&quot; and is celebrated as a statutory Public Holiday.
# With the exception of Farmers&#x27; Day which is always on a Friday, when these dates fall at the weekend, the following Monday tends to be declared a holiday.
# Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Day is celebrated in commemoration of the birthday of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the first President of Ghana.
# Constitution Day is a relatively newly designated Public Holiday, which was initially observed on 7 January 2019.

It is not mandatory that all Ghanaian institutions/organizations recognize public holidays. Institutions/organizations that are exempt include The Ghana National Fire Service, food vendors, some category of hotels, health service providers such as hospitals, dealers in pharmaceutical products etc.

<text>Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; &quot;anaerobic&quot; means &quot;without oxygen&quot;. This type of exercise leads to a buildup of lactic acid.
In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise. 

The biochemistry of anaerobic exercise involves a process called glycolysis, in which glucose is converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary source of energy for cellular reactions.

Anaerobic exercise may be used to help build endurance, muscle strength, and power.

== Metabolism ==
Anaerobic metabolism is a natural part of metabolic energy expenditure. Fast twitch muscles (as compared to slow twitch muscles) operate using anaerobic metabolic systems, such that any use of fast twitch muscle fibers leads to increased anaerobic energy expenditure. Intense exercise lasting upwards of four minutes (e.g. a mile race) may still have considerable anaerobic energy expenditure. An example is high-intensity interval training, an exercise strategy that is performed under anaerobic conditions at intensities that reach an excess of 90% of the maximum heart rate. Anaerobic energy expenditure is difficult to accurately quantify. Some methods estimate the anaerobic component of an exercise by determining the maximum accumulated oxygen deficit or measuring the lactic acid formation in muscle mass.

In contrast, aerobic exercise includes lower intensity activities performed for longer periods of time. Activities such as walking, jogging, rowing, and cycling require oxygen to generate the energy needed for prolonged exercise (i.e., aerobic energy expenditure). For sports that require repeated short bursts of exercise, the aerobic system acts to replenish and store energy during recovery periods to fuel the next energy burst. Therefore, training strategies for many sports demand that both aerobic and anaerobic systems be developed. The benefits of adding anaerobic exercise include improving cardiovascular endurance as well as build and maintaining muscle strength and losing weight.
The anaerobic energy systems are:
*The alactic anaerobic system, which consists of high energy phosphates, adenosine triphosphate, and creatine phosphate; and
*The lactic anaerobic system, which features anaerobic glycolysis.

High energy phosphates are stored in limited quantities within muscle cells. Anaerobic glycolysis exclusively uses glucose (and glycogen) as a fuel in the absence of oxygen, or more specifically, when ATP is needed at rates that exceed those provided by aerobic metabolism. The consequence of such rapid glucose breakdown is the formation of lactic acid (or more appropriately, its conjugate base lactate at biological pH levels). Physical activities that last up to about thirty seconds rely primarily on the former ATP-CP phosphagen system. Beyond this time, both aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis-based metabolic systems are used.

The by-product of anaerobic glycolysis—lactate—has traditionally been thought to be detrimental to muscle function. However, this appears likely only when lactate levels are very high. Elevated lactate levels are only one of many changes that occur within and around muscle cells during intense exercise that can lead to fatigue. Fatigue, which is muscle failure, is a complex subject that depends on more than just changes to lactate concentration. Energy availability, oxygen delivery, perception to pain, and other psychological factors all contribute to muscular fatigue. Elevated muscle and blood lactate concentrations are a natural consequence of any physical exertion. The effectiveness of anaerobic activity can be improved through training.

Anaerobic exercise also increases an individual&#x27;s basal metabolic rate (BMR).

== Examples==
Anaerobic exercises are high-intensity workouts completed over shorter durations, while aerobic exercises include variable-intensity workouts completed over longer durations. Some examples of anaerobic exercises include sprints, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and strength training.

<doc id="892490" wikidata="Q7558508" url="?curid=892490" title="Soloflex">
<text>Soloflex refers to both the Soloflex exercise machine and to Soloflex, Inc., the company that created and produces it. Instead of pulleys, the Soloflex used an elastomer Weightstrap made of heavy-duty rubber to create variable resistance. The company started out as Bucksteel Mfg in Roswell, New Mexico, in a small plant on the old Army Air Force base south of town. It is now based in Hillsboro, Oregon.

==History==
Soloflex, Inc. was established in 1978 by Jerry Wilson. The idea behind the weight straps came from Jerry&#x27;s days flying small airplanes. The resistance on the plane&#x27;s controls came from the bungee cord. Jerry used this idea to create the Weightstraps that provide enough resistance to equal large amounts of free weight.

In 1980, the company relocated to Hillsboro, Oregon. After the move to Oregon, Bucksteel changed its name to Soloflex. The company then used model Scott Madsen in an infomercial to promote their product. By 1984, the company&#x27;s sales had grown to $18 million annually. Over time, several additions to the machine were made, such as butterfly attachments and leg extensions. The newest product addition is the Soloflex Whole Body Vibration (WBV) Platform. Vibrating while you are lifting weights is thought to magnify the conditioning effects to help promote faster muscle growth.

==Products==
Soloflex home gym machines use an elastic element to provide resistance. The product also comes with an instructional DVD.

Soloflex&#x27;s WBV Platform made news in July 2007 for a Consumer Reports review that demonstrated it had been using claims from research that may not apply to their machine. &quot;At press time, even the research on its Website involved competitors&#x27; products and lab machines. Some research suggests that certain vibrating machines might help improve strength and balance, but our experts said it&#x27;s unclear whether the Soloflex would. Its vibration levels differ from those studied.&quot;

Soloflex disputed the article&#x27;s comments on burning calories, but did not comment on other claims.

As of April 29, 2023, the Soloflex website was shut down and an email sent from the company confirmed they are shutting down operations

<doc id="892493" wikidata="Q2008746" url="?curid=892493" title="Obed River">
<text>Obed River is a stream draining a part of the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee, the United States. It, and particularly its tributaries, are important streams for whitewater enthusiasts.

The Obed River rises in Cumberland County, Tennessee, just south of Crossville. It is bridged by U.S. Highway 70 between downtown Crossville and the municipal airport, and meets its confluence with the Little Obed River near a bridge on U.S. Highway 70N and an abandoned railroad bridge which was formerly part of the rail system linking Nashville and Knoxville. Shortly thereafter, it is bridged by U.S. Highway 127 and Interstate 40. Except during periods of very high flow, the stream is scarcely visible from these bridges because of the depth of its gorge.

==Obed Wild and Scenic River==
From there the stream enters a rather remote area. After several miles it is bridged by State Route 298 (Genesis Road). From this point to its mouth it is designated as a National Wild and Scenic River along with Clear Creek and Daddys Creek. The area is maintained by the National Park Service.

The direction of flow changes gradually from largely south to north to largely west to east. Shortly after crossing into Morgan County it receives the flow of Daddys Creek, which is a good whitewater rafting stream. Downstream from this is the mouth of Clear Creek. This stream is also part of the Obed River &quot;Wild and Scenic&quot; designation; like Daddys Creek, it too is a premiere whitewater stream during periods of high flow.

===Amenities===
The National Park Service maintains a visitor center located at 208 North Maiden Street in Wartburg. They also maintain the Rock Creek Campground and the Nemo Picnic Area.

==Emory River confluence==
Several miles below the mouth of Clear Creek is the confluence with the Emory River. Although the Obed River is the larger of the two, the river takes the name of the Emory River below the confluence.

<doc id="892498" wikidata="Q2424431" url="?curid=892498" title="Northumberland Park railway station">
<text>Northumberland Park railway station is on the Lea Valley line that forms part of the West Anglia Main Line, serving the ward of Northumberland Park in Tottenham, north London. It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between and . Its three-letter station code is NUM and it is in Travelcard zone 3. It is one of the stations that can be used to access Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

The station and all trains serving it are operated by Greater Anglia. The station was upgraded in 2017 to add an extra track and a new island platform. It had one of north London&#x27;s few level crossings to its immediate north, but this was removed in the rebuilding of the station as a result of the STAR (Stratford to Angel Road) project. Northumberland Park Depot for the London Underground&#x27;s Victoria line is sited adjacent to the station and it is close to Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.

==History==

Northumberland Park was opened on 1 April 1842 as a Halt on the Northern &amp; Eastern Railway. The station was originally named Marsh Lane after the country lane to Tottenham Marshes on which it is situated.

The Northern and Eastern Railway was leased by the Eastern Counties Railway in 1844 who took over operation of the line. The line was initially laid to a gauge of but already this had been identified as non-standard and between 5 September and 7 October 1844 the whole network was re-laid to .

On 1 June 1852 the station was renamed Park station.

The Eastern Counties Railway was taken over by the Great Eastern Railway in 1862.

In 1882 the line through the station became part of a major rail freight artery with the opening of the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway. This provided a link for the Great Eastern Railway from the coal fields in the north to London. This led to a second pair of running lines known as the Slow Lines (the ones that exist today - 2013 - are the old Fast Lines) being added in 1913.

In 1919 as well as the two sets of main lines there were some private sidings serving local industries including Tottenham Gas works. Adjacent to the station was a marshalling yard for goods traffic. The yard was under the control of the station master and had three reception sidings and fourteen sorting sidings. Its purpose was the servicing of the various lineside industries on the southern part of the Lea Valley Lines as well as the Enfield Town and Chingford Branch Line Chingford branch goods depots. Additionally it used to handle the perishable goods traffic as the policy was to keep this apart from more general traffic.

In 1923 operation passed to the London &amp; North Eastern Railway and the station was renamed to its current title, Northumberland Park on 1 July 1923, this is also the name of the surrounding district, in Tottenham, North London.

On 7 January 1931 there was an accident at Northumberland Park when a coal train hit a shunting locomotive which was then propelled into a brake van of another freight train. This resulted in the brake van catching fire and the train guard was burnt to death.

The signal box (built 1914) was located near the level crossing and was raised up on stilts.

In 1940 during World War 2 an unexploded anti-aircraft shell fell on the adjacent marshalling yard.

Following nationalisation in 1948 the station became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways.

Around 1961 the marshalling yard was closed and the site used for the Northumberland Park Depot of London Underground&#x27;s Victoria line. This is the only above ground location where Victoria line stock can be seen and the depot is joined to the main Victoria line at a junction north of Seven Sisters tube station.

The Lea Valley line between Copper Mill Junction and Cheshunt was electrified at 25 kV in 1969. The station was also rebuilt at this time with the work being completed in 1970. Prior to the completion of electrification in 1969, passenger services between Cheshunt and London Liverpool Street through Northumberland Park were normally operated by Class 125 diesel multiple units (which had been purpose-built for the line in 1958).

When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Rail.

The signal box (by this date only controlling the level crossing gates) was closed.

==Recent history==
Following privatisation in 1994 management of the station was initially allocated to a business unit which succeeded the old British Railways structure before being taken over by West Anglia Great Northern (WAGN) in January 1997. Initially owned by Prism Rail, National Express took over operation in July 2000. In 1994 responsibility for the operational infrastructure passed to Railtrack.

In August 2002 signalling control was transferred to the Liverpool Street Integrated Electronic Control Centre (IECC).

The WAGN franchise was replaced in 2003 by the &#x27;One&#x27; franchise although this was later renamed National Express East Anglia.

The following year following financial difficulties Railtrack was superseded by Network Rail.

In February 2012 operation of the station changed once again with Abellio Greater Anglia taking over the Greater Anglia franchise.

In March 2017, following consultation with local authorities and the public, the decision was made to permanently close the ticket office at Northumberland Park. The station is now unmanned with assistance reached via station help points. The New Northumberland Park station will also be constructed without a ticket office.

===Proposals and upgrade===

In 2007 Haringey Council supported proposals for platforms for the Victoria line to be built at Northumberland Park. These would be to the east of the main line platforms between the main line and the Northumberland Park Depot. This was supported by the former Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. It is claimed that this would aid regeneration of the area, and that better transport links would have to be part of plans to increase capacity at White Hart Lane.

In February 2013, the Crossrail task force of business group London First, chaired by former Secretary of State for Transport Andrew Adonis, published its recommendations on Crossrail 2, favouring a route almost identical to the regional option proposed by TfL in 2011. The report was endorsed by Network Rail. If this happens it is likely that few if any main line trains will continue to call at Northumberland Park.

This proposal will see four tracks restored through Northumberland Park to Tottenham Hale and direct links via central London to the south west suburbs.

In 2017, as part of a £170m Lee Valley Rail Programme to build a 5.5 km new track between Stratford and a new Meridian Water railway station, the construction of a new island platform with lifts and a new footbridge at Northumberland Park started. The new platform accommodates the new third track allowing an additional two trains per hour to be operated. The level crossing for cars was closed and removed. The work was completed in 2019.

==Connections==
London Buses Routes 192, 318, 341, 476 and W3 serve the station.

==Services==
All services at Northumberland Park are operated by Greater Anglia. The typical off-peak service is:
* 3 tph to 
* 1 tph to 
* 2 tph to 
On Sundays, the hourly service between Stratford and Bishops Stortford does not run.

When there are events at the nearby Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, some Greater Anglia services to Cambridge, Hertford East (and sometimes Stansted Airport) make additional stops at this station.

<text>Otakhon Latifi (Tajik:Отахон Латифи) (March 18, 1936 – September 22, 1998) was a noted journalist and politician from Tajikistan.

== Early life ==
He was born in the town of Pendjikent. Under the Soviet Union, he was both &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;Izvestiya&quot;&#x27;s correspondent in Tajikistan at various times. He also served as head of the Union of Journalists of Tajikistan.

== Career ==
Latifi branched into politics in 1989, becoming deputy chairman of the Tajik Council of Ministers. He became involved in the peace process that followed the country&#x27;s bloody post-independence civil war. In 1992, he became Deputy Prime Minister, as part of Tajikistan&#x27;s national reconciliation government.

Over time, Latifi became a prominent opposition figure, as a senior member in the United Tajik Opposition. This led to a period in exile in Tehran and Moscow between 1992 and 1997. While in Moscow, on August 4, 1994, Latifi was badly beaten outside his Moscow apartment, and key documents relating to the peace process were stolen.

On his return to Tajikistan in September 1997, he chaired the panel for legal issues under the National Reconciliation Commission, a role which he continued until his death.

== Death ==
On September 22, 1998, at around 8am, Latifi was shot at point blank range outside his apartment in Dushanbe.

== Legacy ==
His murder sparked condemnation from both the government and opposition, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the non-government organization Human Rights Watch. His death was also mentioned in &quot;Time Magazine.&quot;

The murder, which all parties to the conflict agreed was politically motivated, also resulted in the UTO&#x27;s eventual suspension of their role in the government, temporarily bringing the peace process to the point of collapse.

There is still some speculation as to who killed Latifi. Crime figure Abdullo Tursunov was tried and found guilty in June 2000. However, two years before, in January 1998, another man, Ravshan Gafurov was captured by police, and promptly confessed. Gafurov was later killed by police after attempting to escape custody. Tajik police had also claimed that the murder, and several other similar killings, were linked to Islamic Renaissance Party Chairman Said Abdullo Nuri.

<text>Olvido Gara Jova (born June 13, 1963), known professionaly as Alaska, is a Spanish-Mexican singer, songwriter, actress, television host and DJ. She was born and raised in Mexico City, where she spent her first ten years, until she moved to Spain with her family. In Spain, she was a guitarist in the group Kaka de Luxe, until 1979, when she became the vocalist and composer of Alaska y los Pegamoides, a group with which she reached her first number one thanks to &quot;Bailando&quot;, acquiring great recognition at a national level and in some Spanish-speaking countries. From 1983, she was the vocalist and composer of Alaska y Dinarama; group with which she continued releasing albums that reached a wide popularity. Many of her songs have reached number one on the music charts in Spain and wide recognition in several Spanish-speaking countries; her biggest hits include songs such as &quot;Perlas ensangrentadas&quot;, &quot;Rey del Glam&quot;, &quot;Cómo pudiste hacerme esto a mí&quot;, &quot;Ni tú ni nadie&quot;, &quot;A quién le importa&quot;, &quot;La funcionaria asesina&quot;, &quot;Mi novio es un zombi&quot; and &quot;Quiero ser santa&quot;.

Her career has been reinforced by her appearances in different series, films, television and radio programs, for which she has received varied comments. Her best known participation was in &quot;La bola de cristal&quot; (1984-1988), a television program broadcast on Televisión Española during the eighties, which was committed to treating children as adults and reflected the socio-political change brought about by the Spanish transition, as well as the cultural and musical explosion known as the “movida madrileña”. As an actress, her most recognized role was in &quot;Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls on the Heap&quot; (1980), a feature film written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar. Among her work in television stands out her participation as a juror in &quot;Lluvia de estrellas&quot; (2001), as a presenter in &quot;Alaska y Segura&quot; (2014-2015), the Benidorm Fest 2022 and starring in the reality show &quot;Alaska y Mario&quot; (2011-2018), with her husband.

Since 1989 she has been a member of Fangoria, an electronic music group that she leads together with Nacho Canut, who has accompanied her since her musical beginnings. The group began as part of the underground movement, and gained popularity with the release of their second album, &quot;Una temporada en el infierno&quot; (1999). Their greatest hits include songs such as &quot;No sé qué me das&quot;, &quot;Eternamente inocente&quot;, &quot;Retorciendo palabras&quot;, &quot;Miro la vida pasar&quot;, &quot;Entre mil dudas&quot;, &quot;Criticar por criticar&quot;, &quot;Absolutamente&quot;, &quot;Dramas y comedias&quot;, &quot;Geometría polisentimental&quot; and &quot;Espectacular&quot;.

Influenced by several personalities, Alaska is recognized for her changing and transgressive aesthetic sense with respect to music, fashion, live performances and music videos.
== Life and career ==
=== 1963–1976: Early life ===
Olvido Gara Jova was born in Mexico City, Mexico, on June 13, 1963. Her father, Manuel Gara López, was Asturian, and her mother, América Jova Godoy, is Cuban. The Gara family is originally from Gijón, her father having emigrated from Spain in exile during the Spanish Civil War. Alaska is the only daughter of the couple, although she has two step-siblings on her father&#x27;s side, Manuel and Berta. On her mother&#x27;s side, Alaska is related to a large part of the Cuban aristocracy, among them the presidents of the republic Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado and Miguel Mariano Gómez, through her mother América Arias; or the philanthropists Marta Abreu and Rosalía Abreu.

At the age of 10, in 1973, she emigrated to Spain with her parents and her maternal grandmother. For Alaska, the drastic cultural change was a hard blow, so she took refuge in books and comics that replaced the Mexican television culture. Among them was the book &quot;Gay Rock&quot;, by Eduardo Haro Ibars, where she took David Bowie and Lou Reed as cultural references. During her first years in Spain, she studied a course in aesthetics and dramatic art under the influence of glam rock, which determined her aesthetics as an artist. Throughout 1977, Alaska began to frequent the El Rastro in Madrid with her friend El Zurdo. Due to the latter&#x27;s previous musical experience, the idea of creating a magazine and a group arose. Alaska, on the other hand, adopts her artistic name for the fanzine &quot;Bazofia&quot;. The name &quot;Alaska&quot; comes from the song &quot;Caroline Says II&quot; by Lou Reed, in the phrase &quot;All her friends call her Alaska&quot;.

=== 1977–1982: Career beginnings, Kaka de Luxe and Alaska y los Pegamoides ===

During 1977 the punk rock band Kaka de Luxe is born, formed by Alaska, Carlos Berlanga, Nacho Canut, El Zurdo, Manolo Campoamor and Enrique Sierra. The first performance takes place in People, located in the neighborhood of Argüelles, Madrid, where Alaska debuts as the group&#x27;s guitarist. In 1978, thanks to their participation in the Concurso Rock Villa de Madrid, where they came in second place, they released their first EP &quot;Kaka de Luxe&quot; (1977). Finally, in that same year the group dissolved due to differences between the members, and some of the male members began their military service.

Alaska y los Pegamoides was a Spanish band formed in 1979, after the dissolution of the group Kaka de Luxe, which included four of its members: Alaska, Nacho Canut, Manolo Campoamor and Carlos Berlanga. These musicians realized that they shared greater affinities among themselves than with the rest of the members of Kaka de Luxe, and decided to go their separate ways, since their musical and artistic interests were completely different. In its early stages, the band counted with the collaboration of Poch, who would later integrate Ejecutivos Agresivos and form Derribos Arias, as a solo guitarist. Javier Hamilton (better known as Javier Furia), who had been part of Kaka de Luxe, also joined the band to be in charge of backing vocals, although shortly after he joined Radio Futura. The departure of their first drummer, Álvaro de Torres, also a former member of Kaka de Luxe, was due to ideological disagreements, such as his refusal to use a drum machine that Alaska had acquired for her compositions, as well as other conflicts such as a discussion related to Alaska&#x27;s habit of eating pipes during the recordings without offering them to her bandmates.

With the departure of Álvaro, the band incorporated two new members: Ana Curra, whom they met at the emblematic Madrid bar El Penta, and Eduardo Benavente, who joined after passing a test, after Juan Luis Vizcaya, the previous drummer, left the band due to his disagreement with the inclusion of keyboards in the group. The line-up continued to evolve, and another important change was the departure of Manolo Campoamor, who had initially been the vocalist. After his departure, the position was temporarily filled by Carlos Berlanga, until finally Alaska assumed the main role of vocalist, abandoning the guitar. Manolo Campoamor adopted the new identity of Eddie Neopreno and tried to form a new band under that name. Despite these changes, Alaska y los Pegamoides remained active and participated in the tribute concert to Canito, the drummer of Tos, who died in a traffic accident in February 1980. This was the first and only concert of the group in which they used a drum machine instead of a traditional drum kit.

Once this new formation was consolidated, the band recorded their first single, &quot;Horror en el hipermercado&quot;, produced by Julián Ruiz, in 1980. This song was relatively successful, which allowed the recording of their second single, &quot;Otra dimensión&quot;, the following year. In 1981, a parallel group to Pegamoides emerged, Parálisis Permanente, formed by Nacho Canut and Eduardo Benavente, whose sound reflected the British punk tendencies of the time, influenced by bands such as Killing Joke, GBH and The Exploited. In addition, Alaska and Ana Curra participated in the project Negros S.A., together with Los Nikis, while Curra and Benavente created another parallel group called Los Seres Vacíos. All these projects released albums in 1982, just when Alaska y los Pegamoides were enjoying their greatest success. On May 20, 1982, Alaska y los Pegamoides released their only album, &quot;Grandes éxitos&quot;, which included the iconic hit single &quot;Bailando&quot;. Throughout their career, the band experimented with different aesthetics, ranging from colorful pop to a darker image linked to punk and goth.

The dissolution of Alaska y los Pegamoides began to take shape during the recording of their only album, between the end of 1981 and the beginning of 1982, which led to the departure of Carlos Berlanga from the group. Despite this, two more singles were released in 1982, &quot;La línea se cortó&quot; and &quot;En el jardín&quot; (the latter a limited edition flexi disc, which was given away to concertgoers). Meanwhile, Berlanga formed Dinarama with his childhood friend Nacho Canut. Internal tensions within Alaska y los Pegamoides were the trigger for their dissolution, and, after a successful period, the band broke up definitively at the end of 1982.

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
In 1977, Alaska along with Fernando Márquez, Nacho Canut, Carlos Berlanga and Enrique Sierra, among others, formed the band Kaka de Luxe, one of the first Spanish punk rock bands, where she played rhythm guitar. In 1979, Gara, Canut, Berlanga, Ana Curra and Eduardo Benavente formed the band Alaska y los Pegamoides. Alaska was lead singer for the first time with the group &quot;Pegamoides&quot;. They took the name as a tribute to one of the bands they admired: Siouxsie and the Banshees. Due to some artistic differences, Carlos Berlanga left &quot;Pegamoides&quot;, and with Nacho Canut they formed &quot;Dinarama&quot;. At this time, Eduardo Benavente and Ana Curra were involved in Parálisis Permanente, one of the first goth bands in Spain. A few months after Carlos Berlanga left the band, &quot;Pegamoides&quot; split up. In 1982, Alaska joined &quot;Dinarama&quot; and the band released their first album in 1983 titled &quot;Canciones Profanas&quot; under the name &quot;Dinarama + Alaska&quot;. The band decided to use the name &quot;Alaska y Dinarama&quot; in their following album, &quot;Deseo carnal&quot;, and they kept the name until 1989. In 1989, Carlos Berlanga left &quot;Alaska y Dinarama&quot; in the middle of their tour of their last album &quot;Fan Fatal&quot; where all songs are tribute to the bands they loved and admired over the years: Ramones, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Michael Jackson, Depeche Mode, Aviador Dro, Parálisis Permanente, etc.

When &quot;Alaska y Dinarama&quot; split up, Nacho Canut and Alaska decide to call themselves &quot;Fangoria&quot;. They changed their music style to electronic pop, in the style of Pet Shop Boys. They released their first album &quot;Salto Mortal&quot; with Hispavox, their record company since forming &quot;Pegamoides&quot;. After that they left the company and released a trilogy with different independent companies: &quot;Un día cualquiera en Vulcano I&quot;, &quot;Un día cualquiera en Vulcano II&quot; and &quot;Un día cualquiera en Vulcano III&quot;. They did not play many concerts. It was during this period that Alaska became an icon for the LGBT community and became very active supporting Madrid Gay Pride.

Subterfuge, an important indie company released Fangoria&#x27;s next album: &quot;Una Temporada en el Infierno&quot;, considered by some to be a masterpiece of electronic music. Fangoria started selling loads of CDs and the band became very popular. Another album with Subterfuge, &quot;Naturaleza muerta&quot; proved that Fangoria was an amazing electronic band and that Alaska was a fantastic performer. Some creative differences with Subterfuge forced Fangoria to leave its new recording label. In 2004, DRO (Warner) released their next album: &quot;Arquitectura Efímera&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Alaska was the host of a Spanish children&#x27;s show on Televisión Española called &quot;La Bola de Cristal&quot;.

=== 21st century ===
In 2005, Fangoria visited Mexico to promote their new album &quot;Arquitectura efímera&quot;. Alaska appeared on two sketches of Telehit&#x27;s Desde Gayola (a Mexican parody show). In the first sketch, she appeared as herself in an interview with Tesorito, in the second one, she played the character of Galaxia (a DJ) with Supermana, Chef Ornica &amp; Manigüis.

Since 2011, she starred as herself in the MTV Spain reality series &quot;Alaska y Mario&quot;, alongside her husband/manager Mario Vaquerizo.

== Collaborations with other artists ==
In 1980, Alaska appeared as Bom in the Pedro Almodóvar film &quot;Pepi, Luci, Bom y otras chicas del montón&quot;. She has also had cameo roles in films like &quot;Airbag&quot;, &quot;Más que amor, frenesí&quot;, etc.

Alaska has collaborated on the soundtracks of &quot;The Killer Tongue&quot; (&quot;La Lengua Asesina&quot;) with Robert Englund, &quot;The Bear Cub&quot; (&quot;Cachorro&quot;), &quot;Bandid Lover&quot; (&quot;Amante Bandido&quot;) in Miguel Bosé&#x27;s Papito (2007), etc.

== Reception ==
American academic and social critic, Camille Paglia, discovered Fangoria&#x27;s music video &quot;El Cementerio De Mis Sueños&quot; (&quot;The Cemetery of My Dreams&quot;) thanks to a reader of her column on www.salon.com, and had the following to say about Alaska in her column dated 10 January 2008:

<text>Interstate 790 (I-790) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in the city of Utica, New York, in the United States. It runs for from an interchange with New York State Route 5A (NY 5A) and NY 5S in downtown Utica to a pair of interchanges with Genesee Street east of the city. All of I-790 is concurrent with NY 5, and the portion south of NY 49 is also concurrent with NY 8 and NY 12. I-790 connects to exit 31 of the New York State Thruway (I-90) by way of an interchange near its east end. According to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), I-790 follows NY 5 to Genesee Street while the highway leading to Thruway exit 31 is merely a pair of ramps connecting I-790 to its parent. The north–south portion of I-790 between its western terminus and NY 49 is named the North–South Arterial Highway.

==Route description==
I-790 begins at an interchange connecting NY 5A and NY 5S to the North–South Arterial (NY 5, NY 8, and NY 12) on the northern edge of the city of Utica. The route heads northeast from this point, overlapping with NY 5, NY 8, and NY 12 along a six-lane limited-access highway leading away from downtown. As the road leaves the NY 5A and NY 5S junction, it crosses over the CSX Transportation&#x27;s Mohawk Subdivision rail line, which runs along the northern edge of the interchange. Past the tracks, the dense commercial and residential blocks that comprise downtown Utica give way to a mostly undeveloped strip of land surrounding the Mohawk River and Erie Canal. I-790 continues on a northeasterly track across the open area, crossing the Mohawk River and a railroad grade just north of the waterway.

As I-790 crosses the Erie Canal, it enters a complex interchange built around the New York State Thruway (I-90). While NY 8 and NY 12 continue north through the junction, I-790 and NY 5 exit to the southeast, leaving NY 8 and NY 12 to meet NY 49 adjacent to the thruway. The two directions of NY 49 are physically split by the thruway; while the eastbound direction runs along the southern edge of the thruway, the westbound half flanks the thruway&#x27;s westbound lanes. East of the interchange, I-790 and NY 5 take over NY 49&#x27;s split right-of-way, following an identical configuration for about through Utica&#x27;s northern suburbs. I-790 continues east along the thruway to the exit with northbound Genesee Street, where the Interstate Highway designation ends and the highways adjacent to the thruway become solely designated as NY 5.

While I-790 eastbound has an exit leading directly to exit 31 of the thruway, Utica&#x27;s only exit along the highway, there is no direct connection from exit 31 to I-790 westbound. Instead, I-790 westbound uses part of Genesee Street to get between the I-90 interchange and the highways carrying NY 5 along the thruway.

==History==
The portion of the North–South Arterial between Oriskany Street (NY 5A and NY 5S) and River Road was completed in the late 1950s. By 1961, a two-lane, limited-access highway was constructed along the south side of the New York State Thruway between the arterial and Thruway exit 31. The road left the arterial just north of the Erie Canal and had one intermediate interchange with Genesee Street before connecting directly to I-90 at exit 31. The two-lane connector and the section of the North–South Arterial between Oriskany Street and the connector was designated as I-790 by 1965. The connector was rebuilt as a four-lane freeway that straddles I-90. The direct connection from I-90 to I-790 was eliminated at this time, necessitating the use of surface streets and passing through traffic lights for traffic to reach I-790.

==Future==
There are efforts within NYSDOT to renumber NY 49 and NY 365 (from Utica to Thruway exit 33 in the town of Verona) to NY 790, with the eventual plan of renumbering it again as an extension of I-790. The cost for the conversion to Interstate standards is estimated to be between $150 million and $200 million.

US Representative Mike Arcuri introduced legislation in July 2010 that would redesignate the portion of NY 49 from the North–South Arterial in Utica to NY 825 in Rome as part of I-790. The conversion is expected to cost between $1.5 million and $2 million, which would be used to install new signage along the expressway. By adding the Utica–Rome Expressway to the Interstate Highway System, the area would receive approximately $10 million in additional federal highway funding over the next five years. According to Arcuri, the proposed redesignation is part of a larger, long-term goal of creating an Interstate Highway-standard freeway that would begin at Thruway exit 33 in Verona and pass through Rome before ending at Thruway exit 31. The portion of NY 49 east of NY 825 already meets Interstate Highway standards.

<text>The Nkomati Accord (officially known as the &quot;Agreement on Non-Aggression and Good Neighbourliness between Mozambique and South Africa&quot; ) was a non-aggression pact signed on 16 March 1984 between the People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique and the Republic of South Africa. The event took place at the South African town of Komatipoort with the signatories being President of Mozambique Samora Machel and Prime Minister of South Africa P.W. Botha. The treaty&#x27;s stated focus was on preventing Mozambique from supporting the African National Congress to undertake violent actions in South Africa, and for South Africa to stop supplying the RENAMO movement in Mozambique.

The treaty was met with disapproval from members of the SADCC and particularly from the ANC who were aware of the impacts it would have on their liberation struggle. Despite this, both groups acknowledged that Mozambique had essentially been forced into signing the treaty as the country was on the brink of destruction due to the conflict with the South-African backed RENAMO rebels.

Mozambique stood by its side of the Treaty and expelled ANC members from the south of the country, meanwhile the South Africans ignored the deal and stepped up their already extensive support to RENAMO. Captured documents from the main Gorongosa base in 1985 revealed that the South Africans had continued their support in violation of the accord. A permanent peace accord, the Rome General Peace Accords, finally ended the Mozambican Civil War in 1992 and was supervised by the United Nations&#x27; ONUMOZ force until 1994.

<text>Stefania Follini (born 16 August 1961) is an Italian interior designer. She is known for being involved in a 1989 experiment on circadian rhythms, in which she voluntarily isolated herself for four months in an underground room thirty feet down a cave in Carlsbad, New Mexico, away from all outside indications of night and day. The experiment lasted from January 13, 1989, until May 22, 1989. In total, Follini spent some 130 days in the cave, thus breaking the women&#x27;s world record for longest cave isolation.

==Career==
Hailing from Ancona, Italy, Follini worked as an interior decorator. Out of 20 candidates, Follini was chosen for the experiment because she possessed an &quot;introspective nature&quot; and &quot;mental discipline&quot;. At that time, she was 27 years old.

===Experiment===
The scientific experiment commenced on January 13, 1989. It was organised by Pioneer Frontier Explorations and NASA. It took place in the &quot;Lost Cave&quot; in New Mexico. Inside her acrylic glass room, away from all cues to the normal 24-hour daily cycle, her biological clock drifted away from its regular rhythm to following first a 28-hour day, and later on a 48-hour one. She started staying awake for up to more than twenty hours and sleeping up to ten hours at a time. Her only companions were her guitar, a computer, two &quot;friendly mice&quot; named Giuseppe and Nicoletta, a few frogs, and grasshoppers. During the course of the experiment, she was reported to have felt gloomy, with no human to cheer her up. Her only mode of communication was via the computer terminals. To curb her boredom, Follini would decorate the cave with cutouts made from cardboard.

With her slowed-down daily cycle, her meals were more spread out and she lost in weight. Follini mostly fed on beans and rice, which partially resulted in her losing vitamin D. She reported that at one point her menstrual cycle had stopped. She regularly did judo to maintain her strength and flexibility. When she finally emerged from the cave at the experiment&#x27;s end on May 22, 1989, and was asked to guess the date, she estimated that it was March 14 or 15 — only two months from the start of the experiment instead of the four that had actually transpired. She was described as &quot;looking pale and thin&quot; after coming out from the cave. Having spent about 130 days in the cave, she broke the world record for women for the most number of days spent in isolation in a cave.

<text>The Cumbre Vieja (; meaning &quot;Old Summit&quot;) is an active volcanic ridge on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands, Spain. The spine of Cumbre Vieja trends in an approximate north–south direction, comprising the southern half of La Palma, with both summit ridge and flanks pockmarked by dozens of craters and cones. The latest eruption began on 19 September 2021 in a forested area of Las Manchas locality known as Cabeza de Vaca. Voluminous lava flows quickly reached populated areas downslope, fanning out across settlements and banana plantations, destroying thousands of buildings and ultimately pouring over steep cliffs into the ocean to enlarge the island at several locations. The volcano went quiet on 13 December 2021, and on 25 December 2021, the local government declared the eruption to be over.

Cumbre Vieja erupted twice in the 20th century, in 1949 (Volcán San Juan) and in 1971 (Volcán Teneguía).

==Volcanic history==

La Palma is a volcanic ocean island located on the African Plate and is currently—along with Tenerife—one of the most volcanically active of the Canary Islands. Since about 125,000 years ago (~125 ka), all subaerial eruptions on La Palma have been associated with the Cumbre Vieja, with eruptions ranging over the whole 25-kilometre-long ridge. Submarine surveys show that the Cumbre Vieja continues south of (the &quot;Point of the Hot Source&quot;), but no volcanic activity connected with the submarine extension has yet been observed. Historical eruptions on the Cumbre Vieja occurred in 1470, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, and 2021.

Detailed geological mapping shows that the distribution and orientation of vents and feeder dykes within the volcano have shifted from a triple rift system (typical of most volcanic ocean islands) to a single north–south rift. It is hypothesised that this structural reorganisation is in response to evolving stress patterns associated with the development of a possible detachment fault under the volcano&#x27;s west flank. Siebert (1984) showed that such failures are due to the intrusion of parallel and sub-parallel dykes into a rift. This causes the flanks to become over-steep and this inevitably causes the structure of the volcano to become unstable to the point that catastrophic failure may occur. There is no evidence beyond its surface expression that the 1949 section of the rift extends in a north–south direction, nor that there is a developing detachment plane. Research is ongoing.

===1949 eruption===

The only contemporaneous account of the eruption was published in 1950 by one of the scientists—Juan Bonelli-Rubio who witnessed the eruption first hand and recorded details of the various phenomena that occurred during the eruption. All other published accounts are based upon Bonelli-Rubio&#x27;s observations. The next report regarding the eruption was a joint publication by Ortiz and Bonelli-Rubio published in 1951. This drew heavily on Bonelli-Rubio&#x27;s observations and also analysis of various phenomena associated with the eruption. Both accounts are published in Spanish.

The eruption started on 24 June 1949, the feast day of St John, which is why in Spanish texts the eruption is referred to as , which in English is &quot;The Eruption of the Nambroque of St John&#x27;s volcano.&quot; During the 1949 eruption, eruptive activity was located at three vents—Duraznero, Llano del Banco, and Hoyo Negro—mild strombolian activity occurred at the Duraznero vent. Lava was erupted from the Llano del Banco vents, whilst only mild phreatomagmatic emissions occurred at the Hoyo Negro vent. Then on 30 July—the last day of eruptive activity, lava was erupted at the Duraznero fissure and vent. During the eruption on 1 and 2 July, two strong earthquakes with an estimated intensity of VIII on the Modified Mercalli Scale also occurred, the epicentre was calculated to be near Jedey. Following the earthquakes a fracture was noted and it had a length of approximately one and half kilometres. It was traceable to the Hoyo Negro and Duraznero vents, making a total length of about two and half kilometres or about 1/10 of the exposed length of the Cumbre Vieja, and parts of the western half of the Cumbre Vieja ridge had apparently moved about 1 metre sideways and 2 metres downwards towards the Atlantic Ocean. It was only in the vicinity of the Duraznero and Hoyo Negro vents that the vertical displacement attained about 4 metres. As of 2009, the fracture is still visible and still has the same dimensions recorded in 1949.
The timeline for the eruption, according to Bonelli-Rubio, is as follows: The first reported seismic activity was noted on the southern rim of the Caldera de Taburiente on 23 July 1936 at about 23:30 (11.30 pm) local time, with further activity noted over the next two days. During the following years periodic seismic activity occurred, but due to the absence of monitoring equipment, the only reports are those recorded in the media. Then at about 09:00 (local time) on 24 June 1949, the Duraznero vent opened with mildly explosive activity, venting of gases, and rocks; with eruptive activity continuing in this manner until 6 July. During this phase a strong earthquake occurred on 1 July and again on 2 July with an estimated intensity of VIII on the Modified Mercalli Scale. Visits to the summit region revealed a crack about 1.5 km (~1 mile) long which extended in a northerly direction from the (&quot;Black Hole&quot;) and about 1 km (~0.5-mile) south to the Duraznero vent making a total length of about 2.5 km (~1.6-mile), (this crack is the subject of research and heated debate as to whether it indicates initial failure of the western flank—or not). Later analysis placed the epicentre north of the township of Jedey. Eruptive activity at the Duraznero vent ceased on 6 July with only degassing continuing. No eruptive activity occurred on 7 July. On 8 July eruptive activity commenced at the Llano del Banco vents—about 4 km (~2.8miles) north of the Duraznero vent, as lava was erupted and flowed down the western flank. The vents opened progressively up the barranco (ravine), forming a series of en echelon (diagonally side by side), vents. On 10 July the westward flow of lava from the Llano del Banco vents reached the coast at Puerto de Naos and entered the Atlantic Ocean, forming a lava delta, the velocity is estimated at ~14 metres (approximately 46 feet) per sec. On 12 July mildly explosive activity commenced at the Hoyo Negro (Black Hole) with emissions of rocks, fumes and some phreatomagmatic activity indicating that the eruption had encountered ground waters. Activity at the Hoyo Negro ceased on 22 July, but continued at the Llano del Banco vents until 26 July. Only residual fumarolic activity and thermal emissions then occurred until 30 July when the Duraznero vent and fissure re-activated. Lava then flowed from the Duraznero vent and fissure, filling the adjacent crater of El Fraile and created a lava lake. This subsequently overflowed and the lava flowed down the eastern flank towards the ocean. It finally stopped about 30m (about 100 feet) from the ocean. Also later, on 30 July all eruptive activity ceased and only residual fumarolic activity continued until 4 August; thereafter there was only thermal emissions. It is estimated that approximately 60 million cubic metres of lava was erupted during the eruption.

====Volcanic Explosivity Index====

The eruption style ranged from effusive—mildly explosive at the Duraznero and Llano del Banco vents—to mildly explosive at the Hoyo Negro vent and was strombolian in style. It is classed as having a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 2.

====Earthquakes====

The process creating the earthquakes of 1 and 2 July is considered to have been driven by the pressure caused by the rising magma super-heating water trapped within the edifice of the volcano. It is unlikely that the trapped waters could vapourise due to being under considerable pressure. What is postulated is that the waters were heated to a point where they could not absorb further thermal energy in the available space. Continuing heating required the water to expand further and the only way it could do so was to move the flank of the volcano. This caused the two earthquakes that were reported as occurring during the eruption along with the development of the crack.

That the water entrapped within the edifice did not vapourise is shown by the absence of phreatomagmatic explosions except the mildly explosive eruptive activity that occurred at the Hoyo Negro vent from 12 to 22 July: steam escaping explosively from the ground is often a precursor of volcanic activity. Further evidence that vapourisation did not occur is that when Rubio Bonelli visited the rift the following day, the newly opened fissure &quot;... &quot;Was not issuing fumes, vapour, steam, ashes, lava or other materials&quot; ...&quot; In fact at no time during or after was steam or phreatomagmatic activity reported. This reinforces the claim that the waters trapped within the edifice never vapourised, which they would do if the pressure had fallen sufficiently to allow the super-heated water to flash into steam. Only at the Hoyo Negro did any phreatomagmatic activity occur. Unlike the northern sector of the island, the Cumbre Vieja is &quot;dry.&quot; Unlike the northern sector there are no water galleries, and it is therefore unlikely that the earthquake was caused—as claimed by Day et al.; by water becoming superheated by rising magma. Research is continuing.
Due to the lack of seismic monitoring equipment on the island, any claims about seismic activity are based upon personal observation and may not be reliable.

===1971 eruption===
The 1971 eruption occurred at the southern end of the Cumbre Vieja at the Teneguía vent. The eruption was mainly strombolian in style. Lava was erupted. Seismic activity did occur before and during the 1971 eruption but was not on the scale associated with the 1949 eruption. Residual thermal emissions continue.

===2021 eruption===
An earthquake swarm started under Cumbre Vieja on 11 September 2021. It slowly migrated to the surface, with earthquakes up to around 5 on the Richter scale, and over 25,000 recorded in the space of 10 days. On 19 September at 15:15 local time (14:15 UTC), the volcano started erupting, in Cabeza de Vaca in the Montaña Rajada mountains, in the Las Manchas section of El Paso municipality, A yellow warning was issued, covering 35,000 people in the municipalities of Los Llanos de Aridane, Fuencaliente, El Paso and Villa de Mazo, later raising to its highest level—red—due to the eruption. A total of around 7,000 people were evacuated from the area. The eruption stopped on 13 December 2021, and was declared to be over on 25 December 2021.

The role of Special Commissioner for the Reconstruction of the island of La Palma was created in 2022 to coordinate and promote the actions adopted by the General State Administration to repair the damage caused by volcanic eruptions and for the reconstruction of the island of La Palma. It has the rank of Under Secretary. Hector Izquierdo Triana, born in La Palma and secretary of state for finance at that time, was appointed to this responsibility.

==Potential megatsunami==


Day &quot;et al.&quot; (1999) indicated that the Cumbre Vieja may be in the initial stages of failure. The authors of the paper also said that the geological development of La Palma had undergone changes due to the southerly migration of the hotspot and the collapse of the earlier volcanoes. Subsequent to this, a triple-arm rift system had evolved with the eventual closing down of volcanic activity associated with two of the arms—the north-west and north-east rifts. The reasons can only be hypothesised. This caused the southern arm—the Cumbre Vieja—to be the sole location of volcanic activity. As a result, they postulated that the western flank may be in the initial stages of failure.

In October 2000, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) transmitted a &quot;Horizon&quot; programme called &quot;Mega-tsunami: Wave of Destruction&quot;, which suggested that a future failure of the western flank of Cumbre Vieja could cause a megatsunami.

On 18 April 2013, the BBC transmitted a follow-up programme entitled &quot;Could we survive a Mega-Tsunami?&quot; The programme was presented in a &quot;breaking news&quot; reporting style. It painted a scenario in which the western flank of the Cumbre Vieja had collapsed and the initial wave had an amplitude of about 1,000 metres. The programme used computer generated graphics to present a story line that is based on a hypothesis. The programme interviewed several scientific personnel to give credence to the story. One scientist claimed, &quot;This is a true story—only it hasn&#x27;t happened yet!&quot;

Day &quot;et al.&quot; (1999), Ward and Day (2001) and Ward and Day (2005) hypothesize that, during an eruption at some future date, the western half of the Cumbre Vieja—approximately 500 km3 (5 x 1011 m3) with an estimated mass of 1.5 trillion metric tons—will catastrophically fail in a massive gravitational landslide and enter the Atlantic Ocean, generating a so-called mega-tsunami. The debris will continue to travel along the ocean floor as a debris flow. Computer modelling indicates that the resulting initial wave may attain a local amplitude (height) in excess of and an initial that approximates to , and travel at about (approximately the speed of a jet aircraft), inundating the African coast in about one hour, the southern coastlines of the British Isles in about 3.5 hours, and the eastern seaboard of North America in about six hours, by which time the initial wave will have subsided into a succession of smaller ones each about to high. These may surge to several hundred metres in height and be several kilometres apart while retaining their original speed. The models of Day &quot;et al.&quot;; (1999), Ward and Day (2001), suggest that the event could inundate up to inland. If the model is correct, then this scale of inundation would greatly damage or destroy cities along the entire North American eastern seaboard, including Boston, New York City, Miami and many other cities near the Atlantic coast.

There is controversy about the threat presented by the Cumbre Vieja. Current indications are that recent landslides may have been gradual and therefore may not generate tsunamis unless they increase in magnitude. Studies of possible local &#x27;mega-tsunamis&#x27; in the Hawaiian Islands draw distinctions between the tsunami wave periods caused by landslides and subduction-zone earthquakes, arguing that a similar collapse in Hawaii would not endanger Asian or North American coastlines.

Sonar surveys around many volcanic ocean islands including the Canary Islands, Hawaii, Réunion etc., have mapped debris flows on the sea floor. Many of these debris flows, about long and up to thick, contain mega-blocks mixed up with finer detritus. The debris flows are now considered to be a normal process where a volcano sheds some proportion of excess material and thereby makes itself more stable. It is also known to occur on all volcanoes based on the land, in or under the sea.

Moore (1964) was the first geologist to interpret such features depicted on a United States Navy bathymetric chart. The chart showed two features that seem to originate from the Hawaiian islands of Oahu and Molokai.

Moss &quot;et al.&quot; (1999) reported that the western flank of La Palma is static and there is no indication that it has moved since 1949, confirming the dimensions provided by Bonelli-Rubio (1950).

Carracedo &quot;et al.&quot; (2001) state that they consider the crack to be a surface expression which is of a shallow and inactive nature. They also indicate that it should be monitored, but consider the possibility that the edifice is unstable as being almost non-existent.

The Tsunami Society (2002) claim that the model used by Day &quot;et al.&quot; (1999), Ward and Day (2001), and Ward and Day (2005) is wrong. They caution about the claims made by Day &quot;et al.&quot; and Ward and Day, stating that there is no evidence of a mega-tsunami having been generated by volcanic edifice failure.

Ward and Day (2003) reported on the only documented flank collapse of a volcanic island at that time—Ritter Island, that occurred on 13 March 1888 (a tsunami from a volcanic collapse happened subsequently to this paper in 2018 at Anak Krakatoa). Approximately 5 x 109 m3 (6.5 x 109 cu yd) of material—about two orders of magnitude less than the claimed mass of the Cumbre Vieja—generated a landslide which entered the ocean and generated a westerly-directed tsunami. The tsunami inundated adjoining islands and may have killed several hundred people. According to Cooke, damage was inflicted on islands several hundreds of kilometres from Ritter Island. There is no record of inundation occurring at trans-oceanic distances. The tsunami was witnessed by several Europeans living on many of the islands.

Murty &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) claim that it is almost impossible for a trans-oceanic tsunami to be generated in the basin of the Atlantic Ocean, which—if correct—supports the work by many other researchers that the failure of the western flank of the Cumbre Vieja would be unlikely to generate a &quot;mega-tsunami&quot;.

Pérez-Torrado &quot;et al.&quot; (2006) indicate that marine deposits located between above sea level in the Agaete Valley of Gran Canaria resulted, when ~3 x 1010 m3 (3.9 x 1010 cu yd)—one order of magnitude less than that of models of Day &quot;et al.&quot;; (1999), Ward and Day, (2001); and Ward and Day, (2005),—of volcanic material collapsed, forming the Güimar Valle on Tenerife ~830 ka and generating a tsunami. They indicate that this collapse is the only plausible source, and also report that there is no indication that the tsunami propagated beyond Gran Canaria. These deposits date from between 32,000 and 1,750,000 years ago.

Scientists at TU Delft in the Netherlands reported in 2006, that the section of the western flank of the Cumbre Vieja that was conjectured as potentially failing and falling into the Atlantic Ocean to create the hypothesised La Palma mega-tsunami was both too small in mass and volume, and far too stable to break away within the next 10,000 years.

A 2008 paper by Løvholt &quot;et al.&quot; looked into this very worst-case scenario, the most massive slide that could happen (though unlikely and probably impossible right now with the present day geology). They find wave heights in the range in the Canary Isles themselves. But the waves interfere and dissipate as they head out into the Atlantic. They predict a height of for some nearby island systems. For continents, the worst effects are in northern Brazil (), French Guiana (), Mid-Atlantic United States (), Western Sahara (largest prediction at ), and Mauritania (). This is not large enough to count as a megatsunami, with the highest prediction for Western Sahara comparable to the Japanese tsunami, so it would only be a megatsunami locally in the mid-Atlantic Ocean.

<doc id="892527" wikidata="Q7828463" url="?curid=892527" title="Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway">
<text>The Tottenham &amp; Hampstead Junction Railway was a railway line in north London, formed by an act of Parliament, the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway Act 1862, (25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. cc) of 28 July 1862, which today is mostly part of the Gospel Oak to Barking line. It was effectively part of an attempt by the Great Eastern Railway to obtain a west end terminus to complement Bishopsgate railway station in east London.

The line opened on 21 July 1868 between Tottenham North Junction (on the Great Eastern Railway) and Highgate Road. An extension to Kentish Town opened in 1870. An extension to Gospel Oak opened on 4 June 1888.

== History ==

Even before it opened, the line had problems. Plans to extend the western end of this line via a proposed &#x27;London Main Trunk Railway&#x27;, underneath Hampstead Road, the Metropolitan Railway (modern Circle line) and Tottenham Court Road, to Charing Cross were rejected by Parliament in 1864. Instead it was decided to terminate the line at Gospel Oak. The line opened in 1868 with the Great Eastern Railway operating a service between Highgate Road and Fenchurch Street via Tottenham. 
With a very indirect route into central London at one end and no interchange at all at the other, the service was a commercial failure and the planned link to Gospel Oak was never completed. The service ceased operation entirely in January 1870 and a local act, the (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. cix) was passed in August abandoning the railway in its original form.

During 1870, a branch was constructed to Kentish Town and the line reopened as part of the Midland Railway in October, initially running between Moorgate and Crouch Hill via Kentish Town. In 1872 this was extended to South Tottenham &amp; Stamford Hill. This provided an interchange with the Palace Gates Line. A number of new stations were opened, many of them close to existing stations. Most of these were closed in the 1940s.

In 1888, the line was extended to Gospel Oak (as originally planned) although the Kentish Town branch remained the primary route and the Gospel Oak link was abandoned in 1926. 

In 1894 the Tottenham &amp; Forest Gate Railway opened and the service was extended east of South Tottenham &amp; Stamford Hill to Barking and, occasionally, beyond.
In 1901, a bill was passed as the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway Act 1901 (1 Edw. 7. c. cxv) authorising the widening of the railway and other improvements. This was followed by a bill in 1902, the Midland Railway Act 1902 (2 Edw. 7. c. cli) which gave the Great Eastern and Midland railways joint ownership of the line. The line, along with the rest of Britain&#x27;s railways, was nationalised in 1948 and became part of British Rail.

In 1981, the Kentish Town branch was closed and the link to Gospel Oak reinstated. For more recent history see the Gospel Oak to Barking line.

== Stations ==
The line had the following stations (listed from east to west using the original station names):

*Tottenham (existing, service abandoned 1870)
*South Tottenham &amp; Stamford Hill (existing) (added 1872, replacing Tottenham) [now called &#x27;South Tottenham&#x27;]
*St Ann&#x27;s Road (new) (opened 1882, closed 1942)
*Green Lanes (new) (opened 1880) [now called &#x27;Harringay Green Lanes&#x27;]
*Crouch Hill (new)
*Hornsey Road (new) (opened 1872, closed 1943)
*Upper Holloway (new)
*Junction Road (new) (opened 1872, closed 1943)
*Branch:
:*Highgate Road {Low Level} (new) (opened 1900, closed 1918)
:*Kentish Town (existing, added 1870, line abandoned 1981)
*Highgate Road {High Level} (new) (closed 1915)
*Gospel Oak (existing, added 1888, abandoned 1926, line reopened 1981)

== Current status ==
The branch to Kentish Town closed in 1981 because there was not track capacity at Kentish Town because of the introduction of the Thameslink electrification project. The remainder of the line now forms part of the Gospel Oak to Barking line, part of the London Overground.

<text>Interstate 990 (I-990) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway located entirely within the town of Amherst in Erie County, New York, in the United States. It runs in a roughly north–south direction for through the southwestern and central parts of Amherst from an interchange with I-290 north of Buffalo to an intersection with New York Route 263 (NY 263, named Millersport Highway) south of Lockport. The highway serves as a connection between Buffalo, the University at Buffalo, and Lockport (via NY 263 and NY 78). Like I-590 in nearby Rochester, I-990 does not physically meet I-90, its parent Interstate Highway; instead, the highway makes the connection by way of a &quot;sibling&quot; highway (I-290). I-990 is the highest numbered Interstate Highway in the US. 

Plans for an expressway between Buffalo and Lockport were proposed as early as the late 1960s. As originally laid out, the highway would run for and end in Lockport&#x27;s eastern suburbs. By the time the road was added to the Interstate Highway System and designated I-990 in 1979, the proposal had been scaled back to a freeway linking I-290 to North French Road. The route was constructed and opened to traffic in two stages during the 1980s. An extension to NY 263 was finished in 1990 and officially added to I-990 three years later.

==Description==

I-990 begins at a semi-directional T interchange (exit 4) with I-290 (Youngmann Expressway) in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst. After leaving the interchange, I-990, known as the Lockport Expressway, proceeds northward along the western edge of the University at Buffalo&#x27;s Amherst Campus as a four-lane divided expressway. It generally parallels Sweet Home Road (unsigned NY 952T) to exit 1, a northbound-only interchange providing access to Audubon Parkway by way of a two-lane connector to the campus. From here, I-990 gradually bends northeastward, leaving the vicinity of the campus and entering a partial cloverleaf interchange (exit 2) connecting to Sweet Home Road.

The Interstate Highway continues to turn to the northeast as it heads away from exit 2, crossing over Ellicott Creek and Dodge Road (County Route 45). I-990 expands to six lanes just as it enters the nearby exit 3, which connects to Dodge Road and the northern end of the Audubon Parkway. The freeway briefly runs eastward from the junction, paralleling Dodge Road into the hamlet of Getzville, where the expressway passes over NY 270 (Campbell Boulevard). Just after the NY 270 crossing, I-990 bends northward once again and enters exit 4, a diamond interchange with North French Road (CR 299). 

Past North French Road, I-990 bends back to the northeast, crossing Hopkins Road (CR 87) as it approaches an at-grade intersection with NY 263 (Millersport Highway). The junction serves as I-990&#x27;s exit 5 and its northern terminus. Traffic approaching the junction on northbound I-990 is diverted onto what was intended to be a single-lane exit ramp leading to NY 263. A small stub of highway exists east of the exit gore.

==History==

On October 30, 1968, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) nominated 20 proposed highways to be added to the Interstate Highway System as part of a nationwide system expansion authorized by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. One of the submitted roads was the Lockport Expressway, a , $22-million limited-access highway extending in a northeast–southwest direction between I-290 north of Buffalo and a proposed Niagara Falls–Rochester freeway near Lockport. When the city of Niagara Falls released its Regional Highway Plan for the Buffalo–Niagara Falls area in 1971, the Niagara Falls–Rochester highway was scrapped; as a result, the north end of the Lockport Expressway was moved to a point on NY 31 east of Lockport. In between I-290 and NY 31, the highway would intersect the proposed Belt Expressway and NY 78 (Transit Road).

While the outer belt proposal was mostly dropped, the plans to build the Lockport Expressway gained traction in January 1979 when the portion between I-290 and North French Road was added to the Interstate Highway System and designated as I-990. The remainder of the original route was excluded due to a lack of funding. Construction began in 1980 on the part south of Sweet Home Road, and the highway was opened to traffic by 1985. The section leading northeast to North French Road was built during the mid-1980s and completed by 1990. In 1986, NYSDOT began to evaluate ways to improve the highways surrounding the northern terminus of I-990. One of the potential options was an extension of the freeway to NY 263 (Millersport Highway) southwest of Lockport. This option was ultimately selected, and the new section of the freeway was opened to traffic on December 21, 1990. It was officially added to I-990 on October 22, 1993.

In June 2013, I-990 was renamed from the Lockport Expressway to the Staff Sergeant William R. Wilson III Memorial Highway. This is in honor of his contributions to the US military, which included training Afghan soldiers and police to take over the country&#x27;s security. Staff Sergeant Wilson also served two combat deployments to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. As a result, he was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal and Purple Heart. He also received the National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, as well as the Army Service Ribbon and Overseas Service Ribbon. The bill to rename I-990 was sponsored by State Senator Michael Ranzenhofer and Assemblyman Raymond Walter. Signage is now displayed at each terminus showing the new name.

<text>The Fifth Estate is an English-language Canadian investigative documentary series that airs on the national CBC Television network.

The name is a reference to the term &quot;Fourth Estate&quot;, and was chosen to highlight the program&#x27;s determination to go beyond everyday news into original journalism. The program has been on the air since 16 September 1975, and its primary focus is on investigative journalism. The show was launched in 1975 by Ron Haggart. It has engaged in co-productions with the BBC, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, and often with the PBS program &quot;Frontline&quot;.

&quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; is one of two television programs (with &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; being the first) to win an Academy Award, a prize presented to theatrical films: &quot;Just Another Missing Kid&quot;, originally a &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; episode, was released in theatres in the United States and won the 1982 Academy Award for Documentary Feature.

== Controversies ==
===The Savoie scandal===
In 1992, &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; aired an expose of Inspector Claude Savoie of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, accusing him of being corrupt. On 21 December 1992, Savoie shot himself in his office at the RCMP&#x27;s headquarters. Many felt that &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; bore some responsibility for Savoie&#x27;s suicide. Julian Sher of &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; who worked on the Savoie story stated in 2022: &quot;I didn&#x27;t kill him, I didn&#x27;t load the gun, I didn&#x27;t put the gun to his head. He made his choices. I&#x27;m not responsible but if Dan and I had decided not to do the story, if we had not covered this stuff, would he be alive? He might have decided to kill himself when the RCMP (investigated him)...The lesson I learned from that is the consequences of our work. For many of the people we tell stories about, it&#x27;s their lives and sometimes their deaths.&quot;

=== Libel suit ===
The CBC was successfully sued for libel over an episode that aired on 27 February 1996. Two doctors were interviewed for an episode about prescription drugs. Both doctors alleged their interviews were unfairly edited to give the false impression they were involved in kickbacks, cover-ups of patient deaths and other disreputable activities. Cardiologist Martin Myers asked for an apology plus $25,000, while researcher Frans Leenen asked for an apology plus $10,000. The CBC opted to fight the charges in court. The doctors ultimately prevailed. Myers was awarded $200,000, plus interest and costs, while Leenen won $950,000, plus interest and costs that could total over $2 million, a record for Canadian libel. The CBC has no libel insurance. Judges in both cases ruled that journalists at &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; had twisted the facts and acted with malice, with one writing in his decision; &quot;this was sensationalistic journalism of the worst sort and should serve as an embarrassment to this so-called &#x27;flagship&#x27; investigative programme.&quot; The episode&#x27;s host Trish Wood, producer Nicholas Regush, the researcher and executive producer David Studer were assessed punitive and aggravated damages.

=== Iglesia ni Cristo ===
The CBC and &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; were sued in February 2019 by the Iglesia Ni Cristo after officials said one of the show&#x27;s broadcasts defamed their church, calling the show &quot;slanderous&quot; and acting &quot;without evidence.&quot; CBC News responded by stating they stand behind the story.

The episode in question, &quot;Church of Secrets&quot;, which aired on 11 November 2018 and was hosted by Bob McKeown, detailed the controversies surrounding the church, including accusations of financial irregularities, kidnapping, and the murder of a Canadian man. In particular, McKeown interviewed the widow of a murder victim allegedly killed by INC members after a series of verbal altercations, as well as following the story of excommunicated ministerial worker Lowell Menorca II, who sought refugee status in Canada. The news crew also attempted for and were denied an interview with Eduardo V. Manalo after an event in Sacramento. During the attempt for an interview, their vehicle&#x27;s tires were slashed, which McKeown suspected was an act of intimidation by INC, though an INC member denied the allegation.

<doc id="892535" wikidata="Q5157575" url="?curid=892535" title="Griqualand East">
<text>Griqualand East (Afrikaans: &quot;Griekwaland-Oos&quot;), officially known as New Griqualand (Dutch: &quot;Nieuw Griqualand&quot;), was one of four short-lived Griqua states in Southern Africa from the early 1860s until the late 1870s and was located between the Umzimkulu and Kinira Rivers, south of the Sotho Kingdom.

Griqualand East&#x27;s capital, Kokstad, was the final place of settlement for a people who had migrated several times on their journey from the Cape of Good Hope and over the mountains of present-day Lesotho.

The territory was occupied by the British Empire and became a colony in 1874, shortly before the death of its founder and only leader, Adam Kok III. A short while later, the small territory was incorporated into the neighbouring Cape Colony. Though for a long time overshadowed in history by the story of the Voortrekkers, the &quot;trek&quot; of the Griquas has been described as &quot;one of the great epics of the 19th century.&quot;

==History==

===Background===

Before the arrival of migrants from the west and north, the area formed part of the Mpondo kingdom under King Faku, who ruled as sovereign of the ethnically Xhosa dynasty from 1815 to 1867. During his reign, Faku initially welcomed many refugees who came over the territory&#x27;s north-eastern border, fleeing from the incursions and raids by the army of Shaka (leader of the Zulu Kingdom from 1816 to 1828). As Faku eventually realised that his warriors could not defend the eastern part of his kingdom against Shaka, he decided to evacuate the area, leaving behind what became known as &quot;Nomansland&quot; (often spelled &quot;No-man&#x27;s land&quot; in contemporary sources).

Meanwhile, a group of Griquas who had left the Cape of Good Hope in the 18th century
and had settled in the area around present-day Philippolis in 1826 faced the prospect of their area coming under the control of the emerging Orange Free State (Oranje Vrijstaat - officially established as a Boer republic in 1854). In 1861 most of these inhabitants embarked on an exhausting journey, leaving to move southwards over &quot;Ukhahlamba&quot; also called &quot;intaba zokhahlamba&quot; that means mountains of Ukhahlamba (today known as the &quot;Drakensberg&quot; mountain range), but first-hand witnesses give two differing narratives of the reasons and motivations for their last &quot;trek&quot;.

===Arrival and settlement===

According to the account of John Robinson, first Premier of Natal, the inhabitants of Philippolis were invited by Sir George Grey, administrator of the area on behalf of the United Kingdom, to settle in the aforementioned &quot;Nomansland&quot;, south of what had by then become the British colony of Natal. Their settlement there was to avoid a potential conflict with the Free State and simultaneously serve as a buffer against Bushmen and &quot;their predatory raids upon the farmers and natives of Natal&quot; After their leader Adam Kok III had sent an advance party to survey the area, the entire group agreed to the arrangement and arrived there in 1862.

More recently recovered official documents, however, tell the story of a deal that was negotiated between the Colonial Office and the Free State in 1854, long before the Griquas had any knowledge of their fate. The Colonial Office agreed to undertake the expulsion of the entire population in exchange for a settlement of a border conflict between the Afrikaners and the Cape colonists. According to the sources, Adam Kok III and his followers only learned about the plans six years after the official document had been secretly signed. Realising that they could not muster a fighting force that could match the colonial army, and after having voiced their opposition to becoming either subjects to the Crown in the Cape Colony or servants in the Free State, they left their homeland under duress to go into exile in 1863.

Ultimately, all sources agree that the last great Griqua leader&#x27;s followers ended up in the area around Mount Currie and set up a &quot;Laager&quot;, a simple settlement site made up of small huts, where they remained for over half a decade. In 1869, Reverend Dower of the &quot;London Mission Society&quot; visited the place and agreed to establish a church if the people were to move once more. Kok consulted with the populace, and they chose an area farther south of the mountain. The Griquas moved there in 1872, and founded the town of Kokstad, named in honour of their leader.

The state that was established around Kokstad, while Griqua ruled, was populated overwhelmingly by the pre-existing Xhosa speaking peoples, with the Griqua forming only a very small, politically-dominant minority.

===Government===
Though, in historical terms, constantly on the move, with permanent settlements existing only for short intervals, the people of Griqualand East managed to establish a &quot;Raad&quot; (or &quot;Volksraad&quot;), a gathering of 12 members which made decisions on behalf of the Griqua population and formed delegations to deal with the surrounding polities.

====Currency====
In 1867, after the Bank of Durban had begun printing its own banknotes, Kok and his followers embarked on a similar experiment of their own and had about 10,000 one pound-notes printed for use in the area. The plans to actually introduce them never materialised, and, with the exception of a few remaining samples, almost all of them were destroyed without ever being in circulation.
&lt;br&gt;After the move to Kokstad, however, a new venture in introducing a local currency was more successful in 1874; designed by Strachan and Co. and minted in Germany, several coins were used (see picture) and remained in circulation long after the disestablishment of the country.

Confirmation that the Strachan and Co circulated as money in the region from 1874 comes from the local Standard Bank at Kokstad . and the Managing Director of Strachan and Co

====Symbolism====
The seal included in the information-box is a rough replica of a seal shown on the first set of banknotes of 1867 which is the only known and surviving depiction. On the banknote itself, it is flanked to the left and right by a band or ribbon which reads &quot;G | N G&quot; and includes a helm with mantling. The actual implied colours are unknown.&lt;br&gt;The Griqua flag is a vertically flipped version of the &quot;Vierkleur&quot; used by Transvaal and the South African Republic. A single source dates its first documented appearance to 1903, but the flag itself might have been in use earlier; whether or not independent Griqualand East actually deployed it is uncertain.

===British Annexation (1878)===

In the differing sources and versions of history, the end of Griqualand East&#x27;s story is as contested as its beginning, and the reasons for the country&#x27;s dissolution remain hazy. Local Cape sources record an official (but heavily qualified) request in 1869, from Adam Kok III, for the establishment of British rule, on condition that land title be respected and that Griqualand East should under no circumstances be incorporated into the Colony of Natal. Contemporary reports claimed that the Griquas then sold much of their land voluntarily, and that the overall annexation of the territory took place &quot;at the wish of the inhabitants themselves.&quot; On the other hand, opinion among the Griqua people themselves seems to have been divided. 
A quote by Adam Kok III, upon learning of the Colonial Offices&#x27; plans, suggests that there was misunderstanding or even deception involved in the annexation of Griqualand East: &quot;There you have it... we were not consulted. We can say nothing.&quot; The British assumed direct control of the territory in 1874.

What is known for a fact is that the Griqua leader, whose name still adorns the town he founded, died in December 1875 after being severely injured in a wagon-accident. At his funeral, his cousin commented that with Kok&#x27;s death, the Griquas&#x27; last hope for an independent state in Southern Africa had died as well.

After coming under British rule, Griqualand East was administered by the British as a separate colony for several years. During this time, the Colonial Office put considerable pressure on the government of the neighbouring Cape Colony to annex the costly and turbulent territory. However the Cape, newly under a system of responsible government, was reluctant to assume responsibility for Griqualand East due to its considerable expenses and its considerably resentful population.

===Incorporation into the Cape (1879)===
Although initially the Cape had refused to annex the territory, agreement was reached after substantial negotiation and in 1877 the Cape Parliament passed the Griqualand East Annexation Act (&quot;Act 38 of 1877&quot;). 
The act was only promulgated two years later on 17 September 1879, when four magistrates were set up, at Kokstad, Matatiele, Mount Frere and Umzimkulu. The territory was also given two elected seats in the Cape Parliament, which at the time was elected through the multi-racial &quot;Cape Qualified Franchise&quot; system, whereby qualifications for suffrage were applied to all males, regardless of race.

The Griqua people had only ever been a small, ruling minority of the population of Griqualand East. Once independent Griqua rule was ended, the Xhosa speaking Pondo people, who had long constituted the majority of the Griqualand East population, came to own increasing amounts of land in the area, together with newly-arriving European settlers. These demographic factors led to a further dilution of Griqua identity and a century later, under Apartheid, the territory was incorporated into the Xhosa &quot;homeland&quot; of the Transkei.

==Contemporary Griqualand==
When the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the Cape Colony changed its name to &quot;Cape Province&quot;, and during the 1980s, part of former Griqualand East was partitioned off into the Transkei, one of the four nominally independent Bantustans. In 1994, shortly before the first all-inclusive elections, it was incorporated into the southern part of the KwaZulu-Natal province. Kokstad retained its name and is today one of the main cities of the Harry Gwala District Municipality.

<text>Tau Boötis, Latinised from τ Boötis, is an F-type main-sequence star approximately 51 light-years away in the constellation of Boötes. It is a binary star system, with the secondary star being a red dwarf. In 1999, an extrasolar planet was detected orbiting the primary star.

==Stellar components==
The system is a binary. The primary component is a yellow-white dwarf (spectral type F6V) and secondary is a dim red dwarf (spectral type M2). The system is relatively nearby, distance being about 51 light-years. The primary star should be easily visible to the unaided eye under dark skies.

The primary star, Tau Boötis A is a yellow-white dwarf. It is 35 percent more massive and 42 percent larger than the Sun and thus is somewhat brighter and hotter. It is about 1.3 billion years old, making it younger than the Sun as well. Since it is more massive than the Sun, its lifespan is shorter—less than 6 billion years. Tau Boötis is the first star apart from the Sun to be observed changing the polarity of its magnetic field. It is also listed as a suspected variable star. The magnetic activity cycle for this star shows a period of 122 days—much shorter than the solar cycle.

Tau Boötis B (with a capital B, as opposed to the planet) is a dim, 11 mag red dwarf with only about half the mass and radius of the Sun. It orbits the primary star at an average distance of about 220 AU (14 arcseconds) but comes as close as about 28 AU to the primary, giving its orbit a very high eccentricity of about 0.87. One orbit around the primary would take approximately 2400 years to complete.

==Planetary system==
In 1996 the planet Tau Boötis b was discovered orbiting the primary star by a team of astronomers led by R. Paul Butler. There are also some indications of another planet orbiting the star with a period of roughly 5,000 days; however, this could be due to an instrumental effect or a stellar magnetic activity cycle. Tau Boötis and its planet appear to be tidally locked to each other.

===Naming controversy===
The planet and its host star was one of the planetary systems selected by the International Astronomical Union as part of NameExoWorlds, their public process for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host star (where no proper name already exists). The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names, and the IAU announced the new names in mid-December 2015. However, the IAU annulled the vote for the system, as the winning names (&quot;Shri Ram Matt&quot; for the star and &quot;Bhagavatidevi&quot; for the planet) were judged not to conform with the IAU rules for naming exoplanets due to the political activities of the namesake people. The names garnered the majority of the votes cast for the system, and also making up a significant proportion of all votes cast as part of the contest.

<text>Dicynodontia is an extinct clade of anomodonts, an extinct type of non-mammalian therapsid. Dicynodonts were herbivores that typically bore a pair of tusks, hence their name, which means &#x27;two dog tooth&#x27;. Members of the group possessed a horny, typically toothless beak, unique amongst all synapsids. Dicynodonts first appeared in Southern Pangaea during the mid-Permian, ca. 270–260 million years ago, and became globally distributed and the dominant herbivorous animals in the Late Permian, ca. 260–252 Mya. They were devastated by the end-Permian Extinction that wiped out most other therapsids ca. 252 Mya. They rebounded during the Triassic but died out towards the end of that period. They were the most successful and diverse of the non-mammalian therapsids, with over 80-90 genera known, varying from rat-sized burrowers to elephant-sized browsers.

==Characteristics==
The dicynodont skull is highly specialised, light but strong, with the synapsid temporal openings at the rear of the skull greatly enlarged to accommodate larger jaw muscles. The front of the skull and the lower jaw are generally narrow and, in all but a number of primitive forms, toothless. Instead, the front of the mouth is equipped with a horny beak, as in turtles and ceratopsian dinosaurs. Food was processed by the retraction of the lower jaw when the mouth closed, producing a powerful shearing action, which would have enabled dicynodonts to cope with tough plant material. Dicynodonts typically had a pair of enlarged maxillary caniniform teeth, analogous to the tusks present in some living mammals. In the earliest genera, they were merely enlarged teeth, but in later forms they independently evolved into ever-growing teeth like mammal tusks multiple times. In some dicynodonts, the presence of tusks has been suggested to be sexually dimorphic. Some dicynodonts such as &quot;Stahleckeria&quot; lacked true tusks and instead bore tusk-like extensions on the side of the beak.

The body is short, strong and barrel-shaped, with strong limbs. In large genera (such as &quot;Dinodontosaurus&quot;) the hindlimbs were held erect, but the forelimbs bent at the elbow. Both the pectoral girdle and the ilium are large and strong. The tail is short.

&quot;Pentasauropus&quot; dicynodont tracks suggest that dicynodonts had fleshy pads on their feet. Mummified skin from specimens of &quot;Lystrosaurus&quot; in South Africa have numerous raised bumps.

===Endothermy and soft tissue anatomy===
Dicynodonts have long been suspected of being warm-blooded animals. Their bones are highly vascularised and possess Haversian canals, and their bodily proportions are conducive to heat preservation. In young specimens, the bones are so highly vascularised that they exhibit higher channel densities than most other therapsids. Yet, studies on Late Triassic dicynodont coprolites paradoxically showcase digestive patterns more typical of animals with slow metabolisms.

More recently, the discovery of hair remnants in Permian coprolites possibly vindicates the status of dicynodonts as endothermic animals. As these coprolites come from carnivorous species and digested dicynodont bones are abundant, it has been suggested that at least some of these hair remnants come from dicynodont prey. A new study using chemical analysis seemed to suggest that cynodonts and dicynodonts both developed warm blood independently before the Permian extinction. 

== History ==

A 2024 paper posited that rock art of a superficially walrus-like imaginary creature with downcurved tusks created by the San people of South Africa prior to 1835 may have been partly inspired by fossil dicynodont skulls which erode out of rocks in the area.

Dicynodonts have been known to science since the mid-1800s. The South African geologist Andrew Geddes Bain gave the first description of dicynodonts in 1845. At the time, Bain was a supervisor for the construction of military roads under the Corps of Royal Engineers and had found many reptilian fossils during his surveys of South Africa. Bain described these fossils in an 1845 letter published in &quot;Transactions of the Geological Society of London&quot;, calling them &quot;bidentals&quot; for their two prominent tusks. In that same year, the English paleontologist Richard Owen named two species of dicynodonts from South Africa: &quot;Dicynodon lacerticeps&quot; and &quot;Dicynodon bainii&quot;. Since Bain was preoccupied with the Corps of Royal Engineers, he wanted Owen to describe his fossils more extensively. Owen did not publish a description until 1876 in his &quot;Descriptive and Illustrated Catalogue of the Fossil Reptilia of South Africa in the Collection of the British Museum&quot;. By this time, many more dicynodonts had been described. In 1859, another important species called &quot;Ptychognathus declivis&quot; was named from South Africa. In the same year, Owen named the group Dicynodontia. In his &quot;Descriptive and Illustrated Catalogue&quot;, Owen honored Bain by erecting Bidentalia as a replacement name for his Dicynodontia. The name Bidentalia quickly fell out of use in the following years, replaced by popularity of Owen&#x27;s Dicynodontia.

==Evolutionary history==
Dicynodonts first appeared during the Middle Permian in the Southern Hemisphere, with South Africa being the centre of their known diversity, and underwent a rapid evolutionary radiation, becoming globally distributed and amongst the most successful and abundant land vertebrates during the Late Permian. During this time, they included a large variety of ecotypes, including large, medium-sized, and small herbivores and short-limbed mole-like burrowers.

Only four lineages are known to have survived the Great Dying; the first three represented with a single genus each: &quot;Myosaurus&quot;, &quot;Kombuisia&quot;, and &quot;Lystrosaurus&quot;, the latter being the most common and widespread herbivores of the Induan (earliest Triassic). None of these survived long into the Triassic. The fourth group was the Kannemeyeriiformes, the only dicynodonts who diversified during the Triassic. These stocky, pig- to ox-sized animals were the most abundant herbivores worldwide from the Olenekian to the Ladinian age. By the Carnian they had been supplanted by traversodont cynodonts and rhynchosaur reptiles. During the Norian (middle of the Late Triassic), perhaps due to increasing aridity, they drastically declined, and the role of large herbivores was taken over by sauropodomorph dinosaurs.

Fossils of an Asian elephant-sized dicynodont &quot;Lisowicia bojani&quot; discovered in Poland indicate that dicynodonts survived at least until the late Norian or earliest Rhaetian (latest Triassic); this animal was also the largest known dicynodont species.

Six fragments of fossil bone discovered in Queensland, Australia, were interpreted as remains of a skull in 2003. This suggested to indicate that dicynodonts survived into the Cretaceous in southern Gondwana. The dicynodont affinity of these specimens was questioned (including a proposal that they belonged to a baurusuchian crocodyliform by Agnolin et al. in 2010), and in 2019 Knutsen and Oerlemans considered this fossil to be of Plio-Pleistocene age, and reinterpreted it as a fossil of a large mammal, probably a diprotodontid.

With the decline and extinction of the kannemeyerids, there were to be no more dominant large synapsid herbivores until the middle Paleocene epoch (60 Ma) when mammals, distant descendants of cynodonts, began to diversify after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.

==Systematics==

===Taxonomy===
Dicynodontia was originally named by the English paleontologist Richard Owen. It was erected as a family of the order Anomodontia and included the genera &quot;Dicynodon&quot; and &quot;Ptychognathus&quot;. Other groups of Anomodontia included Gnathodontia, which included &quot;Rhynchosaurus&quot; (now known to be an archosauromorph) and Cryptodontia, which included &quot;Oudenodon&quot;. Cryptodonts were distinguished from dicynodonts from their absence of tusks. Although it lacks tusks, &quot;Oudenodon&quot; is now classified as a dicynodont, and the name Cryptodontia is no longer used. Thomas Henry Huxley revised Owen&#x27;s Dicynodontia as an order that included &quot;Dicynodon&quot; and &quot;Oudenodon&quot;. Dicynodontia was later ranked as a suborder or infraorder with the larger group Anomodontia, which is classified as an order. The ranking of Dicynodontia has varied in recent studies, with Ivakhnenko (2008) considering it a suborder, Ivanchnenko (2008) considering it an infraorder, and Kurkin (2010) considering it an order.

Many higher taxa, including infraorders and families, have been erected as a means of classifying the large number of dicynodont species. Cluver and King (1983) recognised several main groups within Dicynodontia, including Eodicynodontia (containing only Eodicynodon), Endothiodontia (containing only Endothiodontidae), Pristerodontia (Pristerodontidae, Cryptodontidae, Aulacephalodontidae, Dicynodontidae, Lystrosauridae, and Kannemeyeriidae), Kingoriamorpha (containing only Kingoriidae), Diictodontia (Diictodontidae, Robertiidae, Cistecephalidae, Emydopidae and Myosauridae), and Venyukoviamorpha. Most of these taxa are no longer considered valid. Kammerer and Angielczyk (2009) suggested that the problematic taxonomy and nomenclature of Dicynodontia and other groups results from the large number of conflicting studies and the tendency for invalid names to be mistakenly established.

<doc id="892543" wikidata="Q488011" url="?curid=892543" title="United Nations Operation in Mozambique">
<text>The United Nations Operations in Mozambique (ONUMOZ, ) was a UN peace mission to Mozambique established in December 1992 under Security Council Resolution 797 with the assignment to monitor the implementation of the Rome General Peace Accords agreed upon by the Mozambican president Joaquim Chissano of FRELIMO, the Front for Liberation of Mozambique, and Afonso Dhlakama of RENAMO, the Mozambican National Resistance. The operation was one of the most significant and extensive UN operations and it sought to demobilize and disarm troops, provide humanitarian aid, and oversee the elections. The operation ended in December 1994.

== Background ==
After Mozambique gained its independence from Portugal, Frelimo whose leaders were now in power, sought to rebuild and expand the state&#x27;s role. Yet this was not an easy task. At the time, there were very few trained Mozambican doctors or teachers, and 95% of the population was illiterate. To help the mission, the Eastern Bloc supplied them with medical staff, teachers, government advisers, and Western volunteers excited to engage in socialist state-building. They thus embarked on a mission to expand the state&#x27;s social services, education, and hospital systems.

However, in the 1980s, the Mozambican Civil War seriously hindered the mission&#x27;s efforts. Renamo sought to overthrow Frelimo with the support of external actors. White regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa were the movement&#x27;s largest donors. After Mozambique gained its independence and Frelimo instituted an African and Marxist government, the white minority rule in Rhodesia could no longer rely on Mozambique for support. Therefore, the Rhodesian Central Intelligence Agency began an operation inside Mozambique with the goal of toppling the Frelimo government. They gathered former soldiers from the colonial army that supported their goal of removing Frelimo from power. Ultimately, this group of soldiers formed Renamo and persuaded many other Mozambicans from rural towns and the countryside to join them. Together, they introduced violence and destruction into the country. They destroyed many schools, roads, and hospitals the socialist state building project had built.

Fighting the Renamo forces left the government, run by Frelimo, with enormous amounts of debt, especially since the Soviet Union was no longer funding them. The government turned to Western donors to escape the dire situation. In 1986 and 1987, they began receiving double the amount of foreign aid, and in 1988, foreign aid comprised 81.2% of their GDP. With the consent of the Mozambican government, the Bretton Woods institution implemented a Structural Adjustment Program. The institution provided debt relief and aid in exchange for a more liberal economy. Frelimo&#x27;s political ideologies were initially socialist, but privatizing companies, reducing the role of the state, and cutting taxes, were the price they had to pay to save the country.

In addition to creating debt, the Civil War also had a devastating impact on people&#x27;s lives. Around 1 million Mozambicans died, and 3 million had to flee their homes or move to another country as a result of the war. Medical facilities were no longer functioning, and infant mortality had risen to the second highest in the world: one in three children died before the age of five. Furthermore, severe droughts plagued the country in 1992, and hunger threatened countless lives.

=== The end of the war and the General Peace Agreement ===
In the late 1980s, both Renamo and Frelimo had become uninterested in fighting. The Mozambican government was recovering from debt and no longer wholeheartedly committed to a Marxist–Leninist government framework. Instead of ‘People’s Republic,’ Mozambique was now solely named ‘Republic.’ The government also instituted freedom of speech and separated the judiciary from the government. They were willing to allow for multi-party democracy and to give up total control of the state. As for Renamo, its funds were depleting. The white rule in Rhodesia ended, and South Africa began to transition toward majority rule in the 1990s. Thus, Renamo lost both of its supporters. Renamo&#x27;s internal support was also waning as they were partially responsible for the ongoing famine. They had destroyed most of the country&#x27;s infrastructure, which led the drought to have a greater impact on the country. Frelimo was also willing to allow Renamo, a place in government, and neither side had the funds to continue the war. Therefore, they decided to sign an agreement declaring a truce.

In July 1990, the two sides first sat down to talk in Rome. An Italian non-governmental organization, the Sant’ Egidio community, and Mario Rafaelli, an Italian politician, helped them write up an agreement. During their first meeting, they agreed only to end the violence in the Beira and Limpopo corridors. However, in later talks in July 1991 and October 1992, both sides agreed to demobilize before the parliamentary and presidential elections. On October 4, 1992, President Chissano, leader of Frelimo, and Afonso Dhlakama, leader of Renamo, signed the General Peace Agreement. As requested by both parties, The United Nations became responsible for ensuring that both sides would remain committed to the General Peace Agreement and that all soldiers would demobilize and disarm before the parliamentary and presidential elections.

Mozambique&#x27;s government requested that the UN begin the operation immediately after the General Peace Agreement was signed, but the UN was only able to come up with a plan three months later. The parties continued to violate the cease-fire agreement making it impossible for the UN to deliver humanitarian aid. Finally, in December 1992, the UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali put forth a plan. The plan was composed of four components: political, military, humanitarian, and electoral. The political component had no specific goals other than overseeing that the operation ran smoothly. The military component directly aimed to promote peace, demobilize and disarm troops, and create a new national army. The humanitarian component assisted refugees and Mozambicans suffering from hunger, while the electoral component oversaw the upcoming elections.

==Mandate==

ONUMOZ&#x27; mandate was:

*To monitor and verify the ceasefire, the separation and concentration of forces, their demobilization and the collection, storage and destruction of weapons;
*To monitor and verify the complete withdrawal of foreign forces and to provide security in the transport corridors;
*To monitor and verify the disbanding of private and irregular armed groups;
*To authorize security arrangements for vital infrastructures and to provide security for United Nations and other international activities in support of the peace process;
*To provide technical assistance and monitor the entire electoral process;
*To coordinate and monitor humanitarian assistance operations, in particular those relating to refugees, internally displaced persons, demobilized military personnel and the affected local population.

==Military==
The military division was in charge of demobilizing active Frelimo and Renamo troops and aimed to do it before the elections. This was a top priority for the mission to ensure long lasting peace.

Demobilization was set to begin in March 1993, but several issues arose between June and September 1993 that stalled the process. Dhlakama declared that he did not think demobilization had to be achieved before the elections. Furthermore, Dhlakama insisted that its troops must wait to demobilize in order to avoid a Frelimo coup. If Renamo troops began to demobilize, they would become militarily vulnerable, and Frelimo would take advantage of the situation to regain complete control. Dhlakama thus requested that 65% of the UN troops be present in the country before he began demobilizing Renamo troops. Additionally, neither side was collaborating with the UN to provide inaccurate lists of troops, weapons, and base.

The UN dealt with such issues by posing threats to both sides. On a visit to Mozambique, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali said that if they continued to refuse to follow through with the plan to demobilize, the UN would withdraw its support.  Aldo Ajello, the Interim Special Representative for Mozambique, also convinced Dhlakama to demobilize by telling him that all of the UN&#x27;s funds would be directed to the government if he did not comply. Boutros-Ghali and Ajello&#x27;s actions were successful, and the government and Dhlakama shared their final troop assembly location lists. The UN program ultimately demobilized 67,042 government troops and 24,648 Renamo troops.

=== The challenge of creating a national army ===
There were also significant challenges to creating the new Mozambican army, The Defence Forces of Mozambique, FADM. The Technical Unit and Reintegration Support Scheme, part of the UN, were in charge of transitioning soldiers out of their former position and into society. Their tasks included registering soldiers, creating documents, and giving them basic survival needs. Once demobilized, they were paid for the next eighteen months, and UNOHAC assisted them with finding new jobs. Such steps were intended to facilitate soldiers’ integration into society but ultimately delayed creating a national army since it was more beneficial for soldiers to demobilize.  The due date for the lists of soldiers for the national army had been set for September 1994, yet only 10,000 soldiers were recruited at that point. In the end, there were 12,000 soldiers in the new army, but they initially expected 30,000 soldiers in total.

== Humanitarian assistance ==
According to the UN, humanitarian assistance was vital to maintaining peace between the two parties. UNOHAC, the Office of Humanitarian Aid Co-ordination, focused on reintegrating Mozambicans refugees and former Frelimo and Renamo soldiers who had demobilized back into society.

Once the GPA was signed, many Mozambicans living outside of the country or internally displaced began to return. The UNHCR assisted with preparing the country to receive the influx of people by repairing roads, health facilities, schools, and food production mechanisms. One challenge to the UN&#x27;s operation was the presence of land mines scattered across the country. In order to properly welcome Mozambicans back into the country, the UN began a demining operation. Although the program initially faced bureaucratic hurdles and worked slowly, it eventually created a Mine Clearance Training Centre and cleared 5,790 kilometres of roads. By the time of the elections in October 1994 elections, 3 million internal displaced persons, 1.1 million refugees, and 200,000 ex-combatants were back in Mozambique.

=== The role of NGOs ===
NGOs played an essential role in the humanitarian assistance branch of the UN mission. Of the 663 million US dollars that UNOHAC received, 180.2 million US dollars were directed to NGOs, and more funds were distributed to NGOs from agencies other than the UN. Different from government agencies, NGOs were politically neutral and could thus access more areas of the country. Furthermore, many donors preferred to fund NGOs to distribute food and revitalize the country&#x27;s education and hospital systems since the government relief agency, DPCCN, was accused of corruption.

NGOs were responsible for delivering food to Renamo-controlled areas. In such areas, international NGOs such as The World Food Programme and European Union, and one national NGO, The Mozambican Red Cross, were the only organizations allowed to enter. In May 1993, 3.8 million people received food aid; 500,000 resided in Renamo-controlled areas. Therefore, NGOs became responsible for delivering food to such restricted areas. By October 1994, 35 NGOs had delivered 116,000 tons of food to Renamo-controlled areas in 75 districts. NGOs were initially supposed to deliver 60% of the food, and the government relief agency, DPCCN, was to distribute 40%. However, since NGOs could access Renamo-controlled areas and had more funds, they ended up distributing 80% of the food.

In addition to distributing food, NGOs funded the country&#x27;s overall development. They directed 25 million US dollars toward multi-sectoral rural projects, 33 US million dollars toward agriculture, 4.1 US million dollars for education, 9.7 US million for water, and 20 US million for health. They fixed roads, bridges, schools, and hospitals.

== Electoral ==
The last aspect of the UN intervention was monitoring the elections. The United Nations Development Programme hired 2,350 observers both foreigners and locals to implement the goal of free and fair elections. They began a civic education campaign where they televised videos explaining the electoral process and convincing people to vote. Furthermore, the UNDP issued photo-identity cards, and ultimately registered 6,363,311 voters, about 81% of the population of eligible voters.

For the first time in their history, Mozambicans elected parliamentary members and a president to represent them. In parliament, Frelimo got 129 seats, Renamo got 112, and the Democratic Union got 9 seats out of 250 seats. The Democratic Union was the only third party to get enough votes to be part of parliament. As for president, Chissano won with 53% of the vote and Dhlakama lost with 33% of the vote.

After losing, Dhlakama claimed the elections were frauded. He insisted that members of Frelimo had influenced the results and that certain voters were impeded from voting. However, the National Election Committee insisted that elections were free and fair and the outcome was ultimately accepted. This led the UN to declare its mission complete.

== The outcome of the intervention ==
Officially, the UN intervention came to a close and many considered it to be a largely successful operation for its breadth and depth. Some argue that what made it successful was that both Frelimo and Renamo were willing, for the most part, to comply with UN&#x27;s demands, end the war, and transition to a multi-party democracy. Others emphasize that the success of this mission can be attributed to UN officials&#x27; flexibility and first-hand learning. While elections were set to happen in 1993, they pushed them back to 1994 since they knew holding elections a year earlier when all troops had not been demobilized would have been disastrous. Officials were responding directly to what was happening on the ground and updating their plans regularly to accommodate changes in the field.

<text>The phrase Imperial and Royal (, ) refers to the court/government of the Habsburgs in a broader historical perspective. Some modern authors restrict its use to the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary from 1867 to 1918. 

During that period, it indicated that the Habsburg monarch reigned simultaneously as the (Emperor of Austria) and as the (King of Hungary), while the two territories were joined in a real union (akin to a two-state federation in this instance). The acts of the common government, which was responsible only for the Imperial &amp; Royal (&quot;I&amp;R&quot;) Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the I&amp;R Ministry of War and the I&amp;R Ministry of Finance (financing only the two other ministries), were carried out in the name of &quot;His Imperial and Royal Majesty&quot;, and the central governmental bodies had their names prefixed with 

== Symbolic employment of or ==

Before 1867, the territories under the control of the Habsburg monarch in Vienna used or the hyphenated interchangeably. Neither of the spellings defined a hierarchy among the Habsburg dynastic kingdoms, principalities, duchies, and other bodies politic. The Habsburg monarchs ruled the kingdoms of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia as their Kings. The title &quot;Emperor&quot; applied to their role as heads of the conglomerate of the mostly German states called the Holy Roman Empire until 1806. The same title, &quot;Emperor&quot;, came to identify their role as rulers of the newly named Austrian Empire that the Habsburgs attributed so from 11 August 1804.

The name &quot;Imperial-Royal Army&quot; was used from 1745, as &quot;Royal&quot; referred to the Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary, which was not part of the Holy Roman Empire, but under Habsburg rule.

After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Hungarians insisted on the (&#x27;and&#x27;), not the hyphen, in all usage in line with the new autonomous status of the kingdom within the Habsburg lands. Use of the phrase was decreed in a letter written by the Emperor on October 17, 1889 for the military, the navy and the institutions shared by both parts of the empire. Subsequently, the abbreviation only referred to the institutions of the &quot;Austrian&quot; part of Austria-Hungary (Cisleithania). The abbreviation (), or (German: ), both meaning &#x27;Royal Hungarian&#x27;, was applied in reference to the governmental bodies of the Kingdom of Hungary (Transleithania).

In official documents, the abbreviation used provides information on the lands targeted:
* or , meaning &quot;imperial (Austria) – royal (Bohemia)&quot;, pertains to the Austrian Empire before 1867 and to the Austrian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867–1918
* , meaning &quot;imperial (Austria) and royal (Hungary)&quot;, pertains to the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867–1918

== Other uses ==

The ubiquity of this phrase in all administrative matters made it a synonym for the Habsburg administration, sometimes referred to as the &quot; monarchy&quot; in Central European publications through the present. Other languages of the Habsburg Monarchy retained the German abbreviation or used it interchangeably with their own − in Croatian, or in Czech, in Hungarian, in Italian, or in Polish, often hyphenated () in Romanian, in Slovak, in Slovenian.

The abbreviation gave rise to the noun &quot;Kakania&quot; (spelling out the letter &quot;K&quot; [kah] twice as well as reminiscent of in the Central European languages). It was intended to describe the Habsburg Monarchy as a state of mind, bureaucratic and with a highly stratified formal society. A discussion of &quot;Kakania&quot; became a highlight of the first volume of Robert Musil&#x27;s novel &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot; (1930).

<text>Ignacio &quot;Nacho&quot; Canut Guillén (born 5 June 1957) is the bass player and the main composer (along with Alaska) of the band Fangoria.

He was also in the music groups Alaska y los Pegamoides and Alaska y Dinarama together with Carlos Berlanga and Alaska.

He started his career with Kaka de Luxe in 1977, one of the first punk bands in Spain. Later, along with Berlanga and Alaska, Nacho Canut formed Alaska y los Pegamoides with Ana Curra and Eduardo Benavente. Alaska y los Pegamoides would become one of the cornerstones of La Movida Madrileña countercultural movement and an important influence for many Spanish punk bands. The name of the band was adopted along the line of Siouxsie and the Banshees (an important and recognizable influence in his music). With this band, Canut achieved hits like &quot;Horror en el Hipermercado&quot;, &quot;Bote de Colón&quot;, &quot;Llegando Hasta el Final&quot; and &quot;Bailando&quot; (which became an international hit). Songs by Alaska y los Pegamoides appeared in 1982 under the title &quot;Grandes Exitos&quot; (Hispavox).

After the dissolution of Alaska y los Pegamoides in 1982, Canut, Berlanga and Alaska formed one of the most successful bands of the Spanish eighties, Alaska y Dinarama. Alaska y Dinarama became one of the first glam bands in Spain. Some of the finest songs ever written in the history of modern Spanish music have been composed by Canut and Berlanga. Among them, &quot;Ni tú ni nadie&quot; and &quot;¿A quién le importa?&quot; became hymns for the LGBT Spanish movement, other hits include the massively successful songs, &quot;Mi novio es un zombi&quot;, &quot;Quiero ser santa&quot; and &quot;Descongélate&quot;.

When Carlos Berlanga left the band, Nacho Canut and Alaska formed a new band, Fangoria in 1989. This band represented a turn from rock to techno-pop, though the rock influence is still felt in certain songs. With this band, he has published nine studio albums, from &quot;Salto Mortal&quot; (1990) to &quot;Absolutamente&quot; (2009). Many of his songs have appeared in films like &quot;Mondays in the Sun&quot;, &quot;la lengua asesina&quot;, &quot;Sex and Lucia&quot; and &quot;Descongélate&quot;.

<text>The Irish Pub of Kabul was a pub in Kabul, Afghanistan; it opened on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, 2003.

Owner Sean Martin McQuade received approval of a local mullah by promising to repair the road adjacent to the club and assist in relocating a nearby school to a larger site. The pub is licensed by the Afghan government, with the caveat that it not sell alcohol to Afghans. When interviewed a staff member of the bar commented, &quot;Our families know what we do, but we tell other people we just work in a restaurant or a guesthouse selling food and soft drinks.&quot; Within 2 months of opening it received warnings of a possible attack and temporarily closed. By September of the next year the bar had moved into a Kabul hotel.

<text>Fangoria are a Spanish electropop duo formed in Madrid in 1989. Consisting of primary vocalist Alaska and keyboardist Nacho Canut.

==History==
In 1977, Alaska, along with Nacho Canut and Carlos Berlanga, formed the band Alaska y los Pegamoides. Later, in 1982, they changed the name to Alaska y Dinarama. The group was popular and influential during La Movida Madrileña. Some of their famous recordings include &quot;¿A quién le importa?&quot; and &quot;Ni tú ni nadie&quot;. The latter was entered for the Spanish heats of the Eurovision Song Contest in 1985 and later covered by the Mexican group Mœnia in 2004 and by the Puerto Rican band Circo in 2005. Their &quot;¿A quién le importa?&quot; also was later covered by Mexican pop musician Thalía in 2002.

In 1989, Carlos Berlanga left, and the band transformed once again, this time adopting the name of the American horror film magazine &quot;Fangoria&quot;. They had already made clear their fascination with American z-movies, with songs like &quot;Mi novio es un Zombi&quot; (My Boyfriend Is a Zombie) and &quot;La rebelión de los electrodomésticos&quot; (The Rebellion of the Household Appliances). With each name change, the band moved further away from punk and further embraced electropop, although strong guitars have generally always been present in their performances.

Since the birth of Fangoria in 1990, Alaska and Nacho Canut have recorded and launched several albums, always in the dance-pop electronica pattern.

Some of their best-known songs include 
* &quot;En la Disneylandia del amor&quot; (1993) 
* &quot;No sé qué me das&quot; (2001)
* &quot;Eternamente inocente&quot;(2001)
* &quot;Retorciendo palabras&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Miro la vida pasar&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Absolutamente&quot; (2009)
* &quot;Dramas y comedias&quot; (2013)
* &quot;Fiesta en el infierno&quot; (2016)

Moreover, &quot;Hombres&quot; and &quot;Me Odio Cuando Miento&quot; were featured in the 2004 movie &quot;Cachorro&quot;. Their lyrics typically revolve around sadness, loneliness, jealousy and desire: these tragic contents usually contrast with the music, which normally is up-tempo and disco-oriented, although they have recorded downtempo songs as well. Some of their singles have been remixed by Marc Almond (formerly of Soft Cell) and Vive la Fête.

In 2009, they released their tenth studio album &quot;Absolutamente&quot;; the first single &quot;Más es Más&quot; was released before the release of the album. Later they released the second single, &quot;La Pequeña Edad de Hielo&quot;. More recently, in 2010, a set of three CDs came out titled &quot;El Paso Trascendental del Vodevil a la Astracanada&quot;. This release consists of Fangoria&#x27;s greatest hits and rare recordings, as well as 15 completely re-made versions of their older hits from their previous bands, such as &quot;Bailando&quot;, &quot;A quién le importa?&quot;, &quot;Ni tú ni nadie&quot; or &quot;Perlas ensangrentadas&quot;.

<text>Placerias (meaning &#x27;broad body&#x27;) is an extinct genus of dicynodonts that lived during the Carnian to the Norian age of the Triassic Period (230–215 million years ago). &quot;Placerias&quot; belongs to a group of dicynodonts called Kannemeyeriiformes, which was the last known group of dicynodonts before the taxon became extinct at the end of the Triassic.

== Description ==

&quot;Placerias&quot; was one of the largest herbivores in the Late Triassic, weighing up to . The largest skull found had a length of &quot;.&quot;

&quot;Placerias&quot; had a powerful neck, strong legs, and barrel-shaped body with possible ecological and evolutionary parallels with the modern hippopotamus, spending much of its time during the wet season wallowing in the water and chewing at bankside vegetation. &quot;Placerias&quot; was closely related to &quot;Ischigualastia&quot; and similar in appearance. &quot;Placerias&quot; used its beak to slice through thick branches and roots with two short tusks that could be used for defence and for intra-specific display. The genus exhibits two morphs, one with short tusks and one with long tusks, which is inferred to be sexual dimorphism, with the longer-tusked individuals presumably being males.

== Discovery ==
Fossils of forty &quot;Placerias&quot; were found near St. Johns, southeast of the Petrified Forest in the Chinle Formation of Arizona. This site has become known as the &#x27;Placerias Quarry&#x27; and was discovered in 1930, by Charles Camp and Samuel Welles, of the University of California, Berkeley. Sedimentological features of the site indicate a low-energy depositional environment, possibly flood-plain or overbank. Bones are associated mostly with mudstones and a layer that contains numerous carbonate nodules. It is also known from the Pekin Formation of North Carolina.

&quot;Placerias&quot; was originally considered the last of the dicynodonts, although other Late Triassic dicynodonts, such as &quot;Lisowicia&quot; and &quot;Pentasaurus&quot; have since been discovered.

<doc id="892555" wikidata="Q614227" url="?curid=892555" title="Danisco">
<text>Danisco A/S is a Danish bio-based company with activities in food production, enzymes and other bioproducts as well as a wide variety of pharmaceutical grade excipients. It was formed in 1989 from the largest Danish industrial merger ever of the two old C.F. Tietgen companies Danish Sugar (founded 1872), and Dansk Handels- og Industri Company (Danisco A/S).

Danisco is one of the world&#x27;s leading producers of ingredients for food and other consumer products and was also one of the biggest sugar producers in Europe until the divestment of its sugar division to Nordzucker in 2009.

Headquartered in Copenhagen, the group has approximately 6,800 employees in more than 80 locations in 40 countries.

Danisco shares were listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and a member of the blue chip OMX Copenhagen 20 index until June 2011, when DuPont completed a US$6.3 billion acquisition of the company. On February 1, 2021, DuPont&#x27;s Nutrition &amp; Biociences business unit, which includes Danisco, spun off from DuPont an merged with IFF through a Reverse Morris Trust transaction.

== Activities ==
The company&#x27;s activities were structured into two lines of business: Food Ingredients and Industrial enzymes. The Food Ingredients business supplied bio-based ingredients for food and beverage products and comprises the business segments Enablers, Cultures, and Sweeteners, while the Industrial Enzymes business (handled by subsidiary Genencor) focuses on industrial biotechnology and encompasses business segments such as Fabric and Household Care (enzymes for laundry and dishwashing detergents), Technical Enzymes (enzymes for bioethanol and carbohydrate processing as well as textile treatment), and Food and Animal Nutrition (enzymes for bread, feed, and brewing applications).

Danisco also had two biochemical projects: DuPont Danisco Cellulosic Ethanol LLC, a biofuels joint venture with DuPont, and a project with Goodyear to develop a new type of synthetic rubber, called bioIsoprene.

On 9 January 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached agreement to buy Danisco for US$6.3 billion. The acquisition was motivated by a desire by DuPont &quot;to gain production of food additives and enzymes used in biofuels.&quot; On 16 May 2011 DuPont announced that its tender offer for Danisco had been successful and that it would proceed to redeem the remaining shares and delist the company.

The food ingredients and enzyme businesses were combined with similar pre-existing efforts at DuPont into two business divisions named &#x27;Nutrition and Health&#x27; and &#x27;Industrial Biosciences&#x27;, and subsequently into one &#x27;Nutrition &amp; Biosciences&#x27; division.

=== Research and development ===
A considerable number of the employees are engaged in research and development of new products for the international food industry. Today, the Group holds more than 9,300 active patents and patent applications. Their work led to the understanding of the mechanism of CRISPR, the bacterial antiviral defense.

<text>Brabrand () is a postal district of Aarhus Municipality, Denmark. South of Brabrand, in the Aarhus river-valley, is the largest recreational area of Aarhus Municipality, comprising the Brabrand Lake and the meadow-lake of Årslev, with surrounding natural sites.

== History ==
Brabrand was originally a village 6–9 km west of Aarhus, founded in the 18th century, by clearing the land by forest burning (the Danish name reflects this), and its economy was initially based on farming and associated trades. The village became a suburb of Aarhus in 1970 and has now merged with the city.

== Description ==
The district of Brabrand is located outside the ring road of Ring 2 and comprise four distinct areas: The old town in the south by the lake, mainly made up of single-family houses. A modern housing area in the west, with a mix of single-family houses and low multi-family houses. An industrial park around the road of &quot;Edwin Rahrs Vej&quot; in the north, and finally the modernist suburban residential area of Gellerup in the east.

The more affluent western part of Brabrand was expanded recently in 2005, with the new residential area of Helenelyst further west. Helenelyst is a mix of modern one-family houses, two-family houses, and 3 story houses, built to accommodate slightly richer middle-class families.

The neighbourhood of Gellerup stands out as an architectural example of the former urban development style, built around several Danish cities in the 1960s. Gellerup is known as a multinational district, where the Middle East is highly represented, also exemplified in the big middle-eastern inspired shopping mall of Bazar Vest. In the southeast of Gellerup, next to the busy Silkeborg Highway, is the shopping mall of City Vest, one of the largest in Denmark.

Along with the retail and service sectors, a number of multi-national companies have a presence in Brabrand.

== Attractions ==
Brabrand is home to several natural and recreational sites, attracting citizens from all over Aarhus. This includes the Brabrand Lake and the Årslev meadow-lake in the south, connected with the city centre of Aarhus by the pathway of Brabrandstien; the newly raised woodland of Gellerup Skov in the southeast; Skjoldhøjkilen in the north; the valley of Langdalen in the west and the forests of Årslev Skov and True Skov also in the west.

Brabrand has several important sports facilities, such as the rowing stadium at the Brabrand Lake, the new sports and community centre of Globus1 at Gellerup, opportunities for mountainbiking, green exercise and motocross in Skjoldhøjkilen, in addition to many small-scale regular sports facilities like tennis courts, soccer fields, a swimminghall, boxing and martial arts clubs, etc..

Brabrand houses one of the few remaining dolmens in the greater Aarhus area. Most of the dolmens in Aarhus, have been demolished long time ago, but what is left is now regarded as special relics of the past to be protected and valued in the landscape, wherever they might be located. The dolmen is called &quot;Årslev Dyssen&quot; (lit.: The Årslev Dolmen) and is dated to have been constructed in the Stone Age, when the first agricultural societies emerged in Scandinavia around 6,000 years ago. Until 1822, there was a stone-coffin across the road of this dolmen, but it was demolished after a somewhat &quot;scientific&quot; excavation, led by Colonel Høegh Guldberg. 700 m to the east of The Årslev Dolmen, there was another dolmen. It was removed for an unknown reason at some point in the 1880s. The history surrounding Årslev Dyssen might be more impressive than its looks. The dolmen grounds are privately owned by the auto company next to it, but publicly accessible.

<text>Michelle Lena &quot;Shelly&quot; Poole (born 20 March 1972) is an English songwriter and singer.

==Career==
Shelly Poole is the daughter of the 1960s recording artist Brian Poole, of Brian Poole and the Tremeloes. With her sister Karen, she formed the band Alisha&#x27;s Attic, and they released their debut album, &quot;Alisha Rules the World&quot;, in 1996. The band secured a Brit nomination and an Ivor Novello nomination for writing the million-seller single &quot;I Am, I Feel,&quot; and two years later a Capitol Radio award for most played song for &quot;The Incidentals&quot;. Alishas Attic were also one of Uk highlights of the Lilith Tour started by Sarah McLachlan. After selling over one million records worldwide and having three top 20 albums, the duo split up in 2001, a year after &quot;The House We Built&quot;, their fourth album for Mercury Records, was released.

Poole married Ally McErlaine, the lead guitarist from the Scottish band Texas, in Glasgow on 5 October 2001. Shelly Poole went on to achieve success writing songs and producing for other artists throughout the late nineties, and to the present day.

In late 2008, Shelly formed the alternative country band Red Sky July, with McErlaine, and Charity Hair. Red Sky July were one of the first of a new wave of UK Country artists securing playlists on BBC Radio 2 and released three albums that entered the UK country charts in the top three. Poole signed to Gary Barlow&#x27;s publishing company, San Remo Live. After San Remo, Poole signed to Stage Three Music, then three years later to BMG as a writer. Poole is currently with Be Unique. .

Shelly is also a guest in the band the Dark Flowers, a collective of writers and artists started by Paul Statham .

==Recordings and songwriting==
As a songwriter, Poole has written tracks for Janet Jackson, Jack Savoretti, Ronan Keating, Boyzone, Westlife, Ward Thomas, Michael Gray, Mark Ronson, Massive Attack, Roachford, and many more. Poole, along with Andy Hill, also wrote the single &quot;I&#x27;ll See You Again&quot;, for the album by Westlife, &quot;Where We Are&quot;.

Her solo album, &quot;Hard Time for the Dreamer&quot;, was released in September 2005 on the Transistor Project record label, and reached the Top 10 of the French and United Kingdom iTunes chart. Two songs from the album, &quot;Anyday Now&quot; and &quot;Totally Underwater&quot;, were featured on an instore Starbucks album in 2006. Included on the album were two duets with Jack Savoretti.

She co wrote and sang on Michael Gray&#x27;s dance release of 2006, &quot;Borderline&quot;, which reached #12 on the UK Singles Chart and #3 on the ARIA club chart. In May 2006, Poole released &quot;Lost in You&quot;. Her following release was &quot;Totally Underwater&quot;, an EP, which included a remix of &quot;Totally Underwater&quot; by Andy Bradfield, and two tracks &quot;One Kiss&quot; and &quot;What You Feel Like&quot;.

<text>Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is a classic lignan, a phenylpropane dimer linked by a bond between positions C8 and C8′, as opposed to a neolignan. It is a natural compound found in the creosote bush (&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot;).

== Medical properties ==
As a lignan, it is a member of one of the major classes of phytoestrogens. While it is commonly asserted that the biological properties of lignans per sé are void, and that only the enterolignans enterodiol and enterolactone, produced from lignans by intestinal bacteria have interesting biological properties, nordihydroguaiaretic acid has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro or in animal models. It is a redox-type inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase.

A 1986 study involved feeding female mosquitos NDGA to test the effect on their average lifespan. While the usual mosquito life span was 29 days, the NDGA-fed mosquitos lived an average of 45 days—an increase of 50 percent. A 2008 study reported that nordihydroguaiaretic acid lengthened the lifespan of male mice, but not of female mice.

The creosote plant has been used in herbal medicine, but its use is controversial. It was widely used during the 1950s as a food preservative and to preserve natural fibers, but was later banned after reports of toxicity during the early 1960s. Recently, it has been used as a nutritional supplement; however, renal toxicity and hepatotoxicity are reported for chronic use of creosote bush and NDGA.

<doc id="892577" wikidata="Q957153" url="?curid=892577" title="Genuflection">
<text>Genuflection or genuflexion is the act of bending a knee to the ground, as distinguished from kneeling which more strictly involves both knees. From early times, it has been a gesture of deep respect for a superior. Today, the gesture is common in the Christian religious practices of the Anglicanism, Lutheranism, the Catholic Church, and Western Rite Orthodoxy. The Latin word , from which the English word is derived, originally meant kneeling with both knees rather than the rapid dropping to one knee and immediately rising that became customary in Western Europe in the Middle Ages. It is often referred to as &quot;going down on one knee&quot; or &quot;bowing the knee&quot;. In Western culture:
* one genuflects on the left knee to a human dignitary, whether ecclesiastical or civil;
* in Christian churches and chapels, one genuflects on the right knee when the Sacrament is not exposed but in a tabernacle or veiled.

Conversely, one kneels with both knees if the Sacrament is exposed.

==History==

In 328 BC, Alexander the Great introduced into his court-etiquette some form of genuflection already in use in Persia, a modification to the tradition of Proskynesis. In the Byzantine Empire even senators were required to genuflect to the emperor. In medieval Europe, one demonstrated respect for a king or noble by going down on the left knee, often remaining there until told to rise. It is traditionally often performed in western cultures by a man making a proposal of marriage. This is done on the left knee.

The custom of genuflecting, as a sign of respect and even of service, arose out of the honor given to medieval kings. In modern times, when the folded flag of a fallen veteran is offered to the family, the presenting officer will go down on his left knee, if the recipient is seated.

== In Christianity ==
Genuflection, typically on one knee, still plays a part in the Anglican, Lutheran, Roman Catholic and Western Rite Orthodox traditions, among other churches; it is different from kneeling in prayer, which is more widespread.

Those for whom the gesture is difficult, such as the aged or those in poor physical condition, are not expected to perform it. Bowing of the head or at the waist, if possible, are common substitutes.

Except for those people, genuflection is still today mandatory in some situations, such as (in the Catholic Church) when passing in front of the Blessed Sacrament, or during the Consecration in the Mass.

In the King James Version of the Holy Scriptures, the verb &quot;to kneel&quot; occurs more than thirty times, both in the Old and in The New Testament.

=== In front of the Blessed Sacrament ===
Genuflection is a sign of reverence to the Blessed Sacrament. Its purpose is to allow the worshipper to engage his whole person in acknowledging the presence of and to honor Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist. It is customary to genuflect whenever one comes into or leaves the presence of the Blessed Sacrament reserved in the Tabernacle. &quot;This venerable practice of genuflecting before the Blessed Sacrament, whether enclosed in the tabernacle or publicly exposed, as a sign of adoration, ...requires that it be performed in a recollected way. In order that the heart may bow before God in profound reverence, the genuflection must be neither hurried nor careless.&quot;

Genuflection to the Blessed Sacrament, the consecrated Eucharist, especially when arriving or leaving its presence, is a practice in the Anglicanism, the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, Lutheranism, and Western Rite Orthodoxy. It is a comparatively modern replacement for the profound bow of head and body that remains the supreme act of liturgical reverence in the East. Since in many Anglican, Roman Catholic and Western Orthodox Churches the Blessed Sacrament is normally present behind the altar, genuflection is usual when arriving or passing in front of the altar at the communion rail.

Only during the later Middle Ages, centuries after it had become customary to genuflect to persons in authority such as bishops, was genuflection to the Blessed Sacrament introduced. The practice gradually spread and became viewed as obligatory only from the end of the fifteenth century, receiving formal recognition in 1502. The raising of the consecrated Host and Chalice after the Consecration in order to show them to the people was for long unaccompanied by obligatory genuflections.

The requirement that genuflection take place on both knees before the Blessed Sacrament when it is unveiled as at Expositions (but not when it is lying on the corporal during Mass) was altered in 1973 with introduction of the following rule: &quot;Genuflection in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, whether reserved in the tabernacle or exposed for public adoration, is on one knee.&quot; &quot;Since a genuflection is, per se, an act of adoration, the general liturgical norms no longer make any distinction between the mode of adoring Christ reserved in the tabernacle or exposed upon the altar. The simple single genuflection on one knee may be used in all cases.&quot; However, in some countries the episcopal conference has chosen to retain the double genuflection to the Blessed Sacrament, which is performed by kneeling briefly on both knees and reverently bowing the head with hands joined.

As a result of the custom of genuflecting to the sacrament, it is customary in some countries, Germany for example, for people attending mass to genuflect before entering their pew during mass and when leaving it. Though the sacrament in its tabernacle is the &quot;recipient&quot; of this sign of respect, it is almost invariably performed in the direction of the (high) altar, and the crucifix above or behind it as being the most easily recognisable landmark in any church (it is also almost always in close proximity to the tabernacle). 

=== Episcopalian practice ===
In the Episcopal Church, genuflection is an act of personal piety and is not required by the prayer book. In some parishes it is a customary gesture of reverence for Christ&#x27;s real presence in the consecrated Eucharistic elements of bread and wine, particularly in parishes with an Anglo-Catholic tradition.

Generally, if the Blessed Sacrament is reserved in the church, it is customary to acknowledge the Lord&#x27;s presence with a brief act of worship on entering or leaving the building – normally, a genuflection in the direction of the place of reservation.

==During the Liturgy==

The General Instruction of the Roman Missal lays down the following rules for genuflections during Mass:

During Mass, three genuflections are made by the priest celebrant: namely, after the showing of the host, after the showing of the chalice, and before Communion. Certain specific features to be observed in a concelebrated Mass are noted in their proper place &quot;(cf. nos. 210-251)&quot;.

If, however, the tabernacle with the Most Blessed Sacrament is present in the sanctuary, the priest, the deacon, and the other ministers genuflect when they approach the altar and when they depart from the sanctuary, but not during the celebration of Mass itself.

Otherwise all who pass before the Most Blessed Sacrament genuflect, unless they are moving in procession.

Ministers carrying the processional cross or candles bow their heads instead of genuflecting.
=== Other genuflections===
In the Byzantine Rite, most widely observed in the Eastern Orthodox Church, genuflection plays a smaller role and prostration, known as &quot;proskynesis&quot;, is much more common. During the holy mystery of reconciliation, however, following confession of sins, the penitent is to genuflect with head bowed before the Gospel Book or an icon of Christ as the confessor - either a bishop or a presbyter - formally declares God&#x27;s forgiveness.

Genuflection or kneeling is prescribed at various points of the Roman Rite liturgy, such as after the mention of Jesus&#x27; death on the cross in the readings of the Passion during Holy Week.

A right knee genuflection is made during and after the Adoration of the Cross on Good Friday.

A genuflection is made at the mention of the Incarnation in the words &quot;et incarnatus est de Spiritu Sancto, ex Maria Virgine, et homo factus est&quot; (&quot;and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man&quot;) in the Creed on the solemnities of Christmas and the Annunciation.

It is common practice that during the recital of the Angelus prayer, for the lines &quot;And the Word was made flesh/And dwelt among us&quot;, those reciting the prayer bow or genuflect.

====Tridentine Mass====
In the Tridentine Mass this genuflection is made on any day on which the Creed is recited at Mass, as well as at several other points:
* at the words &quot;et Verbum caro factum est&quot; (&quot;and the Word became flesh&quot;) in the prologue of the Gospel of John, which is the usual Last Gospel, as well as the Gospel for the third Mass on Christmas.
* at the words &quot;et procidentes adoraverunt eum&quot; (&quot;and falling down they adored him&quot;) in the Gospel for the Epiphany, Matthew 2:1-12 (which before 1960 was also the Last Gospel of the third Mass on Christmas)
* at the words &quot;Adiuva nos ...&quot; during the (identical) Tract said on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in Lent, except on Ember Wednesday. But no genuflection is envisaged when after Septuagesima the same Tract is used in the votive Mass at a time of Mortality (&quot;Missa votiva tempore mortalitatis&quot;)
* at the words &quot;et procidens adoravit eum&quot; (&quot;and falling down he adored him&quot;) at the end of the Gospel for Wednesday in the Fourth Week of Lent, John 9:1-38
* at the words &quot;ut in nomine Iesu omne genu flectatur caelestium, terrestrium et infernorum&quot; (&quot;that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth&quot;) in the Epistle () of Palm Sunday, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross on 14 September (and also, before 1960, the Feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross on 3 May) and in the Epistle () of the votive Mass of the Passion of the Lord.
* at the words &quot;Veni, sancte Spiritus&quot; in the Alleluia before the Sequence on Pentecost Sunday and the Octave of Pentecost and in the votive Mass of the Holy Spirit

In the Maronite Catholic Church, there is an evocative ceremony of genuflection on the feast of Pentecost. The congregation genuflects first on the left knee to God the Father, then on the right knee to God the Son, and finally on both knees to God the Holy Spirit.

=== Genuflecting to a bishop ===
From the custom of genuflecting to kings and other nobles arose the custom by which lay people or clergy of lesser rank genuflect to a prelate and kiss his episcopal ring, as a sign of acceptance of the bishop&#x27;s apostolic authority as representing Christ in the local church, and originally their social position as lords. Abbots and other senior monastics often received genuflection from their monks and often others.

Genuflecting before &quot;greater prelates&quot; (i.e. Bishops in their own dioceses, Metropolitans in their province, Papal Legates in the territory assigned to them, and Cardinals either outside of Rome or in the church assigned to them in Rome) is treated as obligatory in editions of the &quot;Caeremoniale Episcoporum&quot; earlier than that of 1985; during liturgical functions according to these prescriptions, clergy genuflect when passing before such prelates, but an officiating priest and any more junior prelates, canons, etc. substitute a bow of the head and shoulders for the genuflection.

The present Catholic liturgical books exclude genuflecting to a bishop during the liturgy: &quot;A genuflection, made by bending the right knee to the ground, signifies adoration, and therefore it is reserved for the Most Blessed Sacrament, as well as for the Holy Cross from the solemn adoration during the liturgical celebration on Good Friday until the beginning of the Easter Vigil.&quot; But outside of the liturgy some continue to genuflect or kneel to kiss a bishop&#x27;s ring.

Though it is frequently asserted that genuflections are to be made on the left knee when made to merely human authorities, there is no such prescription in any liturgical book.

<text>Uzès (; ) is a commune in the Gard department in the Occitanie region of Southern France. Uzès lies about north-northeast of Nîmes, west of Avignon, and southeast of Alès.

==History==

Originally &quot;Ucetia&quot; or &quot;Eutica&quot; in Latin, Uzès was a small Gallo-Roman &quot;oppidum,&quot; or administrative settlement. The town lies at the source of the Alzon river, at Fontaine d&#x27;Eure, from where a Roman aqueduct was built in the first century AD, to supply water to the city of Nîmes, away. The most famous stretch of the aqueduct is the Pont du Gard, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which carried fresh water over splendid arches across the Gardon river.

Jews were apparently settled there as early as the 5th century. Saint Ferréol, Bishop of Uzès, was said to have admitted them to his table. Complaints were made of him to King Childebert I for this issue, whereupon the bishop was required to turn against them, expelling those Jews from Uzès who would not convert to Christianity. After his death (581), many of the converts who had been baptised returned to Judaism. In 614 the Christian government expelled Jews from the region.

In early 8th century, Uzès was a fortified &quot;civitas&quot; and bishopric under the Archbishop of Narbonne. During the Umayyad conquest of Gothic Septimania, Uzès became the northernmost stronghold of Muslim Spain circa 725. Charles Martel laid siege to the stronghold in 736, but it remained in Gothic-Andalusian hands up to 752. That year counts loyal to Ansemund of Nîmes ceded numerous of strongholds to the Frankish Pepin the Short. In 753 the stronghold rebelled against the Franks after Ansemund&#x27;s assassination, but the uprising was suppressed and a Frankish trustee of Pepin imposed.

In the 13th century, Uzès hosted a small community of Jewish scholars, as well as a community of Cathars.

Like many cloth-manufacturing centers (Uzès was known for its serges), residents of the city and the surrounding countryside had become strongly Protestant during the 16th century, and religious and class conflicts played out in the Wars of Religion. The Languedoc region suffered considerable violence: Protestants trashed and burned many of the city&#x27;s churches. Only two have survived to the 21st century. Saint-Étienne was reconstructed after the violence.

=== Ucetia ===
Ucetia is the name of a Gallo-Roman oppidum in the Roman province of Occitania. Its existence was recorded on a list of eleven other settlements on a stela in Nîmes (ancient Nemausus) on which its name appears as &quot;VCETIAE&quot;. It was under the administration of Nemausus, to which it provided water via a Roman aqueduct. Ucetia was also known as &quot;Castrum Uceciense&quot;, which is in the &quot;Notitia&quot; of the Provinces of Gallia.

In 2017, Roman mosaics were discovered by accident during construction at a local high school, and represented material proof of Ucetia. The mosaics had depictions of animals such as a deer, an owl, an eagle, and bulls. These have been identified as &quot;honor to the Roman gods&quot;. For many European cultures, deer represented deities of the woodlands, and the owl was a symbol of the goddess Athena. Together with the animals, decorations represented water, geometric shapes, colors, and patterns, including a design with ancient swastika-like elements.

Ucetia was inhabited from at least the 1st century B.C. until the 7th century A.D.

==== Ucetia and Pont du Gard ====
Ucetia was known to have been a source of water carried via aqueduct to many communities, especially ancient Nemausus (Nîmes), which grew to a population of about 30,000. The aqueduct system included the Pont du Gard. Construction of the aqueduct led to a &quot;classic Roman tragedy&quot; of greed in the nearby cities and towns that affected Ucetia and other communities.
===Second World War===
From September 1940 to 9 November 1942, PC Cadix operated at Château des Fouzes near Uzès, in Vichy France. 
It was a cryptographer team organized by French major Gustave Bertrand, comprising 15 Polish men from the Polish Cipher Bureau, 9 Frenchmen and 7 Republican Spanish refugees.
From there, they worked against Axis ciphers including the Enigma machine.

==Geography==
===Climate===

Uzès has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Uzès is . The average annual rainfall is with November as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in July, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Uzès was on 28 June 2019; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 2 March 2005.

==Dukes of Uzès==
The title of Duke of Uzès, in the Crussol family, is the premier title in the peerage of France, coming right after the princes of the blood. The title of seigneur d&#x27;Uzès is attested in a charter of 1088. After part of Languedoc was attached to royal demesne (1229), the lords&#x27; (and later dukes&#x27;) military skill and fealty to the Crown propelled their rise through the nobility, until, after the treason of the last Duke of Montmorency, beheaded in 1632, the title of First Duke of France fell to Uzès, who retain their stronghold in the center of town today, which has expanded round the 11th century &quot;Tour Bermond&quot;. If France were a kingdom, it would be the job of the duke of Uzès to cry out, &quot;Le Roi est mort. Vive le Roi!&quot; at each state funeral, and defend the honour of the queen mother. Twenty-one dukes have been wounded or killed as hereditary Champion of France over the centuries.

==Sights==

The present-day city retains the trace of its walls as a circuit of boulevards. A Capuchin chapel, built in 1635 to house the mortal remains of the dukes, occupies the site of a 1st-century AD temple dedicated to the first Roman Emperor, Augustus.
There are monuments of the prestige of the former bishopric, once one of the most extensive of Languedoc, but extinguished at the Revolution, and private houses that witness the wealth that the textile trade brought in the 16th century. The town is also homes to three feudal towers, the Bermonde Tower (part of the &quot;château du Duché&quot;), the Bishop Tower and the Royal Tower.

Uzès Cathedral was destroyed in the Albigensian Crusade, rebuilt, and destroyed again in the 16th century Wars of Religion. Rebuilt again in the 17th century, it was stripped out during the French Revolution. The 11th century Romanesque &quot;Tour Fenestrelle&quot; (&quot;Window Tower&quot;), with its paired windows, is probably the most famous icon of the city. It was listed as a French Historical Monument in 1862.

Uzès is locally famous for its Saturday market. The market offers local produce, but it also boasts textiles made in the region and many tourist delights.

== Economy ==
Tourism is one of the key industrial sectors, alongside the local arts scene and wine making.

The region has a long history in the production of licorice. The German company Haribo maintains a factory and museum in Uzès, which traces its roots back to the licorice factory Henri Lefont opened there in 1862. His company later merged with Ricqlès, and was then taken over by Haribo.

<doc id="892586" wikidata="Q359495" url="?curid=892586" title="Product recall">
<text>A product recall is a request from a manufacturer to return a product after the discovery of safety issues or product defects that might endanger the consumer or put the maker or seller at risk of legal action. Product recalls are one of a number of corrective actions that can be taken for products that are deemed to be unsafe.

The recall is an effort to limit ruination of the corporate image and limit liability for corporate negligence, which can cause significant legal costs. It can be difficult, if not impossible, to determine how costly can be releasing to the consumer a product that could endanger someone&#x27;s life and the economic loss resulting from unwanted publicity. Recalls are costly. Costs include having to handle the recalled product, replacing it and possibly being held financially responsible for the consequences of the recalled product.

A country&#x27;s consumer protection laws may include specific requirements in regard to product recalls. Such regulations may include how much of the cost the maker will have to bear, situations in which a recall is compulsory (usually because the risk is big enough), or penalties for failure to recall. The firm may also initiate a recall voluntarily, perhaps subject to the same regulations as if the recall were compulsory.

==General steps to a product recall==
A product recall usually involves the following steps, which may differ according to local laws: 
* The business gathers information and analyses the problem. The affected products and batches, their locations within the supply chain, and probable causes of the problem are identified. Responsible authorities are informed of the issue and provide assistance. 
* Direct suppliers, customers and logistics providers may be informed to help identify causes of the problem, and to place a precautionary hold on affected products in their possession to help limit the extent of a potential recall.
* The business carries out a risk assessment to decide if a recall is warranted and the scope of the recall. If a recall is warranted, the business notifies the authorities responsible of their intention to recall a product. In some cases the government can also request a recall of a product.
* Product recalls are communicated to affected businesses, consumer groups and customers. Notices may be published on the respective government agency&#x27;s website (if applicable), the business&#x27;s own website and social media platforms, in major daily newspapers, and in stores selling the product. If the owners of an affected product can be reasonably identified (e.g. a vehicle recall, where owners can be identified using the motor vehicle register), notices may be sent directly to them through post or email.
* Typically, the consumer is advised to return the goods, regardless of condition, to the seller for a full refund or modification. Depending on the instructions of the recalling business, the seller returns the product to the recalling business, or may dispose or modify the product on site.
* The seller reports recalled items to the recalling business, allowing them to reconcile the returned amount with the amount produced and determine if there is still product in the supply chain or the possession of end consumers. The recalling business will generally compensate the seller for the disposition or modification of the product.

==Recalls by industry==
===Automotive industry===
In general, the number of recalls has been increasing – with an exception during the economic crisis of 2009–2010 – due to time, cost and market pressure. Per year, global automotive warranties are estimated as US$40 billion, 3–5% loss in sales.

Low-priced production often leads to minor quality, and outsourcing leads to a shift of knowledge concerning techniques and processes. This way, technical failures are more likely to occur due to communication problems between the different parties engaged in the supply chain and missing definitions for technical interfaces. Despite the increasing number of recalls, a Mojo Motors study found only .005 percent of customers ask about recalls when contacting dealerships. Since 1966, 390 million motor vehicles have been recalled in the USA. 29 million cars were recalled in 2018. That number is down from its peak of 50 million in 2016, but on average, recalls are on the rise. More cars have been recalled between 2015 and 2020 than between 2003 and 2014.

Some of the largest automotive recalls include 1.12 million cars recalled by Toyota in December 2022. The recall included various models of Avalon, Camry, Corolla, RAV4, Lexus ES series, RX350 Highlander, and Sienna Hybrid, due to a fault in the Occupant Classification System (OCS) sensors that could cause the airbags not to deploy as designed.

Manufacturers have to notify the owner when there is a recall notice, but in the case of a second, third or fourth owner of the car, the company may be sending the notice to a previous one.

===Food industry===
Over 3000 food products were recalled in the US in 2016 according to the US Food and Drug Administration Enforcement reports. Individual recall events caused by contamination from foreign bodies (physical contamination from metal, glass, plastic, wood etc.) has increased by 76% in 2016 compared with 2015. This increase in 2016 is even more marked when looking at the number of products recalled (as opposed to recall event) due to foreign body contamination. In 2016 there were 422 products recalled due to foreign body contamination, whilst in 2015 there were 108; almost a 300% increase.

====Pet food recalls====
Every year, there are several pet food and treat recalls due to spoiled or tainted ingredients. Perhaps the most known was in 2007. The 2007 pet food recalls involved the massive recall of many brands of cat and dog foods beginning in March 2007. The recalls came in response to reports of renal failure in pets consuming mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company, beginning in February 2007. The recall began voluntarily with the Canadian company Menu Foods on March 16, 2007, when a company test showed sickness and death in some of the test animals. Overall, several major companies have recalled 150 different brands of food comprising more than 5,000 separate pet food products. The FDA and USDA investigation found the food to be intentionally contaminated with the chemical melamine.

However pet food recalls are not rare at all. The 2007 recall stands out and is well known because of the sheer size, scope, and number of animals affected. But pet food recalls occur on a regular basis. For instance, on September 12, 2008, Mars Petcare US announced a voluntary recall of all dry pet food products produced at its plant in Everson, Pennsylvania, citing potential contamination with &quot;salmonella&quot;.

====Snack food recall====
On July 23, 2018, Pepperidge Farm announced that the Flavor Blasted Xtra Cheddar Goldfish crackers were being recalled due to possible salmonella contamination in the whey powder used on them. This recall also affected the Flavor Blasted Sour Cream and Onion, Whole Grain Xtra Cheddar, and Xtra Cheddar and Pretzel varieties.

Also, more snack products were recalled for various safety reasons. Mondelēz Global LLC recalled all Ritz Crackers products that are containing whey after traces of salmonella were detected on the whey powder. The recall includes Ritz cheese cracker sandwiches and mixed cookie and cracker variety packs. Flower Foods recalled all of their Swiss Rolls products sold under the H-E-B, Food Lion, Mrs. Freshley&#x27;s, Baker&#x27;s Treat, Market Square, and Great Value brands due to contamination of salmonella. John Derst&#x27;s Old Fashioned Bread was also affected by the recall. Pinnacle Foods, Inc. issued a recall on all Hungry Man BBQ boneless chicken wing products due to salmonella being detected in the whey powder of the ranch dressing.

===Broadcast industry===

On September 10, 2020, the frequencies of ABS-CBN Channel 2, alongside its digital channels such as Yey!, Asianovela Channel, and Movie Central, as well as terrestrial operations of cable channels such as Cine Mo!, TeleRadyo Serbisyo, Jeepney TV, Myx, and Knowledge Channel on ABS-CBN TV Plus, and other pertinent local TV and radio stations, were recalled by the Philippine National Telecommunications Commission citing the absence of a valid, legislative franchise. The provisional authorities and certificates of public convenience granted to ABS-CBN were also taken away by the said government agency.

<text>Ian Mackinnon Caldwell (born March 18, 1976) is an American novelist known for co-authoring the 2004 novel &quot;The Rule of Four&quot;. His second book, &quot;The Fifth Gospel&quot;, was published in 2015.

==Early life and education==
Caldwell was born on March 18, 1976, in Fairfax County, Virginia, where he later met his future writing collaborator, Dustin Thomason. Both graduated from the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in 1994. Caldwell graduated Phi Beta Kappa with an A.B. in history from Princeton University in 1998 after completing an 127-page-long senior thesis, titled &quot;The French Popular Front and the Debate over Intervention in the Spanish Civil War&quot;, under the supervision of Thomas J. Dandelet. 

==Career==
After college, while working with Thomason on their first novel, Caldwell worked at MicroStrategy in Tyson Corner and taught test preparation for Kaplan, Inc. in Blacksburg. Caldwell is married to his wife, Meredith, who earned her DVM at Virginia Tech. The couple lived in Newport News, Virginia, before moving to Vienna, Virginia. The couple had three children originally, Ethan, Sami, and Luke, with a fourth, Jude, being adopted in 2014.

Upon graduating from their respective colleges, Caldwell began working with Thomason on the novel &quot;The Rule of Four&quot;. After writing together for a summer, the two continued to collaborate online and by telephone for the next five years. The plot centers on four Princeton seniors attempting to solve a mystery related to the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot;, an Italian work from the early Renaissance. The book was published by Dial Press in 2004, spent 49 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and has sold almost 2 million copies. It was often compared to Dan Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; due to its similar style of teaching history through a fictional plot as well as the proximity in date of publication.

It took Caldwell ten years to complete his second work, &quot;The Fifth Gospel&quot;, which was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 2015. This solo work tells the fictional story of two brothers, both priests, exploring the &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, the &quot;fifth&quot; gospel, and how it might lead to reconciliation between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches.

<text>Eurypterus ( ) is an extinct genus of eurypterid, a group of organisms commonly called &quot;sea scorpions&quot;. The genus lived during the Silurian period, from around 432 to 418 million years ago. &quot;Eurypterus&quot; is by far the most well-studied and well-known eurypterid. &quot;Eurypterus&quot; fossil specimens probably represent more than 95% of all known eurypterid specimens.

There are fifteen species belonging to the genus &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, the most common of which is &quot;E. remipes&quot;, the first eurypterid fossil discovered and the state fossil of New York.

Members of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; averaged at about in length, but the largest individual discovered was estimated to be long. They all possessed spine-bearing appendages and a large paddle they used for swimming. They were generalist species, equally likely to engage in predation or scavenging.

==Discovery==

The first fossil of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; was found in 1818 by S. L. Mitchill, a fossil collector. It was recovered from the Bertie Formation of New York (near Westmoreland, Oneida County). Mitchill interpreted the appendages on the carapace as barbels arising from the mouth. He consequently identified the fossil as a catfish of the genus &quot;Silurus&quot;.

It was only after seven years, in 1825, that the American zoologist James Ellsworth De Kay identified the fossil correctly as an arthropod. He named it &quot;Eurypterus remipes&quot; and established the genus &quot;Eurypterus&quot; in the process. The name means &#x27;wide wing&#x27; or &#x27;broad paddle&#x27;, referring to the swimming legs, from Greek ( &#x27;wide&#x27;) and ( &#x27;wing&#x27;).

However, De Kay thought &quot;Eurypterus&quot; was a branchiopod (a group of crustaceans which include fairy shrimps and water fleas). Soon after, &quot;Eurypterus lacustris&quot; was also discovered in New York in 1835 by the paleontologist Richard Harlan. Another species was discovered in Estonia in 1858 by Jan Nieszkowski. He considered it to be of the same species as the first discovery (&quot;E. remipes&quot;); it is now known as &quot;E. tetragonophthalmus&quot;. These specimens from Estonia are often of extraordinary quality, retaining the actual cuticle of their exoskeletons. In 1898, the Swedish paleontologist Gerhard Holm separated these fossils from the bedrock with acids. Holm was then able to examine the almost perfectly preserved fragments under a microscope. His remarkable study led to the modern breakthrough on eurypterid morphology.

More fossils were recovered in great abundance in New York in the 19th century, and elsewhere in eastern Eurasia and North America. Today, &quot;Eurypterus&quot; remains one of the most commonly found and best known eurypterid genera, comprising more than 95% of all known eurypterid fossils.

&quot;E. remipes&quot; was designated the New York State Fossil by the then Governor Mario Cuomo in 1984.

==Description==
The largest arthropods to have ever existed were eurypterids. The largest known species (&quot;Jaekelopterus rhenaniae&quot;) reached up to in length, about the size of a crocodile. Species of &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, however, were much smaller.

&quot;E. remipes&quot; are usually between in length. &quot;E. lacustris&quot; average at larger sizes at in length. However, a single telson (the posteriormost division of the body) of a specimen of this species reaches this length, being long and indicating a specimen of of length, and that is the largest specimen ever described in literature. In the introduction page of &quot;E. remipes&quot; in website of University of Texas at Austin says that the largest specimen ever found was long, currently on display at the Paleontological Research Institution of New York. However, the text section describes the group eurypterid itself rather than &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, so it is not possible to determine in context whether the long specimen is actually from &quot;E. remipes&quot; or another eurypterid.

&quot;Eurypterus&quot; fossils often occur in similar sizes in a given area. This may be a result of the fossils being &quot;sorted&quot; into windrows as they were being deposited in shallow waters by storms and wave action.

The &quot;Eurypterus&quot; body is broadly divided into two parts: the prosoma and the opisthosoma (in turn divided into the mesosoma and the metasoma).

The prosoma is the forward part of the body, it is actually composed of six segments fused together to form the head and the thorax. It contains the semicircular to subrectangular platelike carapace. On the dorsal side of the latter are two large crescent-shaped compound eyes. They also possessed two smaller light-sensitive simple eyes (the median ocelli) near the center of the carapace on a small elevation (known as the ocellar mound). Underneath the carapace is the mouth and six appendages, usually referred to in Roman numerals I-VI. Each appendage in turn is composed of nine segments (known as podomeres) labeled in Arabic numerals 1–9. The first segments which connect the appendages to the body are known as the coxa (plural coxae).

The first pair (Appendage I) are the chelicerae, small pincer-like arms used for tearing food apart (mastication) during feeding. After the chelicerae are three pairs of short legs (Appendages II, III, and IV). They are spiniferous, with predominantly two spines on each podomere and with the tipmost segment having a single spine. The last two segments are often indistinguishable and give the appearance of a single segment having three spines. They are used both for walking and for food capture. The next pair (Appendage V) is the most leg-like of all appendages, longer than the first three pairs and are mostly spineless except at the tipmost segments. The last pair (Appendage VI) are two broad paddle-like legs used for swimming. The coxae of Appendage VI are broad and flat, resembling an &#x27;ear&#x27;.

The ophisthosoma (the abdomen) is composed of 12 segments, each consisting of a fused upper plate (tergite) and bottom plate (sternite). It is further subdivided in two ways.

Based on the width and structure of each segment, they can be divided into the broad preabdomen (segments 1 to 7) and the narrow postabdomen (segments 8 to 12). The preabdomen is the broader segments of the anterior portion of the ophisthosoma while the postabdomen are the last five segments of the &quot;Eurypterus body&quot;. Each of the segments of the postabdomen contain lateral flattened protrusions known as the epimera with the exception of the last needle-like (styliform) part of the body known as the telson. The segment immediately preceding the telson (which also has the largest epimera of the postabdomen) is known as the pretelson.

An alternative way to divide the ophisthosoma is by function. It can also be divided into the mesosoma (segments 1 to 6), and the metasoma (segments 7 to 12). The mesosoma contains the gills and reproductive organs of &quot;Eurypterus&quot;. Its ventral segments are overlaid by appendage-derived plates known as Blattfüsse (singular Blattfuss, German for &quot;sheet foot&quot;). Protected within which are the branchial chambers which contain the respiratory organs of &quot;Eurypterus&quot;. The metasoma, meanwhile, do not possess Blattfüsse.

Some authors incorrectly use mesosoma and preabdomen interchangeably, as with metasoma and postabdomen.

The main respiratory organs of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; were what seems to be book gills, located in branchial chambers within the segments of the mesosoma. They may have been used for underwater respiration. They are composed of several layers of thin tissue stacked in such a way as to resemble the pages of a book, hence the name. In addition, they also possessed five pairs of oval-shaped areas covered with microscopic projections on the ceiling of the second branchial chambers within the mesosoma, immediately below the gill tracts. These areas are known as Kiemenplatten (or gill-tracts, though the former term is preferred). They are unique to eurypterids.

&quot;Eurypterus&quot; are sexually dimorphic. On the bottom side of the first two segments of the mesosoma are central appendages used for reproduction. In females, they are long and narrow. In the males they are very short. A minority of authors, however, assume the reverse: longer genital appendage for males, shorter for females.

The exoskeleton of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; is often covered with small outgrowths known as ornamentation. They include pustules (small protrusions), scales, and striations. They vary by species and are used for identification. For more detailed diagnostic descriptions of each species under &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, see sections below.
==Classification==

The genus &quot;Eurypterus&quot; belongs to the family Eurypteridae. They are classified under the superfamily Eurypteroidea, suborder Eurypterina, order Eurypterida, and the subphylum Chelicerata. Until recently, eurypterids were thought to belong to the class Merostomata along with order Xiphosura. It is now believed that eurypterids are a sister group to Arachnida, closer to scorpions and spiders than to horseshoe crabs.

&quot;Eurypterus&quot; was the first recognized taxon of eurypterids and is the most common. As a consequence, nearly every remotely similar eurypterid in the 19th century was classified under the genus (except for the distinctive members of the family Pterygotidae and Stylonuridae). The genus was eventually split into several genera as the science of taxonomy developed.

In 1958, several species distinguishable by closer placed eyes and spines on their swimming legs were split off into the separate genus &quot;Erieopterus&quot; by Erik Kjellesvig-Waering. Another split was proposed by Leif Størmer in 1973 when he reclassified some &quot;Eurypterus&quot; to &quot;Baltoeurypterus&quot; based on the size of some of the last segments of their swimming legs. O. Erik Tetlie in 2006 deemed these differences too insignificant to justify a separate genus. He merged &quot;Baltoeurypterus&quot; back into &quot;Eurypterus&quot;. It is now believed that the minor variations described by Størmer are simply the differences found in adults and juveniles within a species.

The genus &quot;Eurypterus&quot; derives from &quot;E. minor&quot;, the oldest known species from the Llandovery of Scotland. &quot;E. minor&quot; is believed to have diverged from &quot;Dolichopterus macrocheirus&quot; sometime in the Llandovery. The following is the phylogenetic tree of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; based on phylogenetic studies by O. Erik Tetlie in 2006. Some species are not represented.

==Species==


Species belonging to the genus, their diagnostic descriptions, synonyms (if present), and distribution are as follows:

Eurypterus 
*?Eurypterus cephalaspis – Silurian, England
::Uncertain placement. Only 3 of the specimens described in 1856 are probably &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, the rest probably belonged to Hughmilleriidae. Its name means &#x27;shield head&#x27;, from Greek ( &#x27;head&#x27;), and ( &#x27;shield or bowl&#x27;). Specimens recovered from Herefordshire, England.

*Eurypterus dekayi – Silurian, United States &amp; Canada
::No raised scales on the posterior margin of the carapace or of the three front-most tergites. The rest of the tergites each have four raised scales. Four to six spines on each podomere of Appendages III and IV. Pretelson has large, rounded epimera without ornamentation on the margins. The species is very similar to &quot;E. laculatus&quot;. The species is named after James Ellsworth De Kay. Specimens recovered from New York and Ontario.

*Eurypterus flintstonensis – Silurian, USA
::Probably a synonym of &quot;E. remipes&quot; or &quot;E. lacustris&quot;. Probably named after Flintstone, Georgia (?). Specimen recovered from eastern United States.

*Eurypterus hankeni – Silurian, Norway
::Small &quot;Eurypterus&quot; species, averaging at long. The largest specimen found is about in length. They can be distinguished by pustules and six scales at the rear margin of their carapaces. Appendages I to IV has two spines on each podomere. The postabdomen have small epimera. The pretelson has long pointed epimera. Telson has striations near its attachment to the pretelson. The species is named after Norwegian paleontologist Nils-Martin Hanken, of the University of Tromsø. Found in the Steinsfjorden Formation of Ringerike, Norway.

*Eurypterus henningsmoeni – Silurian, Norway
::&quot;Eurypterus&quot; with broad paddles and metastoma. Postabdomen has small epimera. Pretelson has large rounded epimera with imbricate scales (overlapping, similar to fish scales). It is very similar and closely related to &quot;E. tetragonophthalmus&quot;. The species was named after the Norwegian paleontologist Gunnar Henningsmoen. Found in Bærum, Norway.

*Eurypterus laculatus – Silurian, USA &amp; Canada
::The visual area of the compound eyes of this species are surrounded by depressions. The ocelli and the ocellar mound are small. No pustules or raised scales on the carapace or the first tergite. It is probably closely related to &quot;E. dekayi&quot;. Its specific epithet means &#x27;four-cornered&#x27;, from Latin (&#x27;four-cornered, checkered&#x27;). Found in New York and Ontario.

*Eurypterus lacustris – Silurian, USA &amp; Canada
:::
::One of the two most common &quot;Eurypterus&quot; fossils found. It is very similar to &quot;E. remipes&quot; and often found in the same localities, but the eyes are placed at a more posterior position on the carapace of &quot;E. lacustris&quot;. It is also slightly larger with a slightly narrower metastoma. Its status as a distinct species was once disputed before diagnostic analysis by Tollerton in 1993. Its specific name means &#x27;from a lake&#x27;, from Latin (&#x27;lake&#x27;). Found in New York and Ontario.

*Eurypterus leopoldi – Silurian, Canada
::Frontmost tergite is reduced. Metasoma is rhombiovate in shape with tooth-like projections at the anterior part. The pretelson has serrated edges. the epimera are large, semi-angular with angular striations. The telson is styliform with large angular striations interspersed among smaller more numerous striations. The species is named after Port Leopold and the Leopold Formation where they were collected. Found in the Leopold Formation of Somerset Island, Canada.

*Eurypterus megalops – Silurian, USA
::Specific name means &quot;large eye&quot;, from Greek ( &#x27;big or large&#x27;) and ( &#x27;eye&#x27;). Discovered in New York, United States.

*?Eurypterus minor – Silurian, Scotland
::Small &quot;Eurypterus&quot; with large pustules on the carapace and abdomen. Does not possess the scale ornamentation found in other species of &quot;Eurypterus&quot;. It is the earliest known species of &quot;Eurypterus&quot;. They have large palpebral lobes (part of &quot;cheeks&quot; of the carapace adjacent to the compound eyes), making it easy to mistake their eyes for being oval. This enlargement is more typical of the genus &quot;Dolichopterus&quot; and it may actually belong to Dolichopteridae. The specific name means &#x27;smaller&#x27;, from Latin . Found in the Reservoir Formation of Pentland Hills, Scotland.

*Eurypterus ornatus – Silurian, USA
::Ornamentation of pustules on the entire surface of the carapace and at least the first tergite. Does not possess raised scales. Its specific name means &#x27;adorned&#x27;, from Latin (&#x27;adorned, ornate&#x27;). Recovered from Fayette, Ohio.

*Eurypterus pittsfordensis – Silurian, USA
::The posterior margin of the carapace has three raised scales. Appendages II to IV has two spines per podomere. The metastoma is rhomboid in shape with a deep notch at the front part. The postabdomen has serrated fringes at the middle with small angular epimera at the sides. The pretelson has large, semiangular epimera with angular striations at the margins. The telson is styliform with sparse angular striations at the margins. The name of the species comes from its place of discovery – the Salina shale formations of Pittsford, New York.

*Eurypterus quebecensis – Silurian, Canada
::Has six raised scales on the posterior margin of the carapace but does not possess pustule ornamentation. It is named after the location it was recovered from Quebec, Canada.

*Eurypterus remipes – Silurian, USA, Canada
::The most common &quot;Eurypterus&quot; species. Has four raised scales at the posterior margin of the carapace. Appendages I to IV has two spines on each podomere. Postabdomen has small epimera. Pretelson has small, semiangular epimera with imbricate scale ornamentation at the margins. The telson has serrated margins along most of its length. It is very similar to &quot;E. lacustris&quot; and can often only be distinguished by the position of the eyes. The specific name means &#x27;oar-foot&#x27;, from Latin (&#x27;oar&#x27;) and (&#x27;foot&#x27;). Found in New York and Ontario, and is the state fossil of New York.

*Eurypterus serratus – Silurian, Sweden
::Similar to &quot;E. pittsfordensis&quot; and &quot;E. leopoldi&quot; but can be distinguished by the dense angular striations on their styliform telson. The specific name means &#x27;serrated&#x27;, from Latin (&#x27;sawn [into pieces]&#x27;). Originally discovered from Gotland, Sweden.

*Eurypterus tetragonophthalmus – Silurian, Ukraine &amp; Estonia
:::
::Four raised scales on the posterior margin of the carapce. Appendages II to IV each have two spines on each podomere. Postabdomen has small epimera. The pretelson has large, rounded epimera with imbricate scale ornamentation at the margins. Telson has imbricate scale ornamentations at the margins of the base which become serrations towards the tip. The specific name means &#x27;four-edged eye&#x27;, from Greek ( &#x27;four&#x27;), ( &#x27;angle&#x27;), and ( &#x27;eye&#x27;). Found in the Rootsiküla Formation of Saaremaa (Ösel), Estonia, with additional discoveries in Ukraine, Norway, and possibly Moldova and Romania.
The list does not include the large number of fossils previously classified under &quot;Eurypterus&quot;. Most of them are now reclassified to other genera, identified as other animals (like crustaceans) or pseudofossils, or remains of doubtful placement. Classification is based on Dunlop &quot;et al.&quot;(2011).

==Paleobiology==
&quot;Eurypterus&quot; belongs to the suborder Eurypterina, eurypterids in which the sixth appendage had developed a broad swimming paddle remarkably similar to that of the modern-day swimming crab. Modeling studies on &quot;Eurypterus&quot; swimming behavior suggest that they utilized a drag-based rowing type of locomotion where appendages moved synchronously in near-horizontal planes. The paddle blades are almost vertically oriented on the backward and down stroke, pushing the animal forward and lifting it up. The blades are then oriented horizontally on the recovery stroke to slash through the water without pushing the animal back. This type of swimming is exhibited by crabs and water beetles.

An alternative hypothesis for &quot;Eurypterus&quot; swimming behavior is that individuals were capable of underwater flying (or subaqueous flight), in which the sinuous motions and shape of the paddles themselves acting as hydrofoils are enough to generate lift. This type is similar to that found in sea turtles and sea lions. It has a relatively slower acceleration rate than the rowing type, especially since adults have proportionally smaller paddles than juveniles. But since the larger sizes of adults mean a higher drag coefficient, using this type of propulsion is more energy-efficient.

Juveniles probably swam using the rowing type, the rapid acceleration afforded by this propulsion is more suited for quickly escaping predators. A small &quot;Eurypterus&quot; could achieve two and a half body lengths per second immediately. Larger adults, meanwhile, probably swam with the subaqueous flight type. The maximum velocity of adults when cruising would have been per second, slightly faster than turtles and sea otters.

Trace fossil evidence indicates that &quot;Eurypterus&quot; employed a rowing stroke when in close proximity to the seafloor. &quot;Arcuites bertiensis&quot; is an ichnospecies that includes a pair of crescent-shaped impressions and a short medial drag, and it has been found in upper Silurian eurypterid Lagerstatten in Ontario and Pennsylvania. This trace fossil is very similar to traces made by modern aquatic swimming insects that row such as water boatmen, and is considered to have been made by juvenile to adult-sized eurypterids while swimming in very shallow nearshore marine environments. The morphology of &quot;A. bertiensis&quot; suggests that &quot;Eurypterus&quot; had the ability to move its swimming appendages in both the horizontal and vertical plane.

&quot;Eurypterus&quot; did not swim to hunt, rather they simply swam in order to move from one feeding site to another quickly. Most of the time they walked on the substrate with their legs (including their swimming leg). They were generalist species, equally likely to engage in predation or scavenging. They hunted small soft-bodied invertebrates like worms. They utilized the mass of spines on their front appendages to both kill and hold them while they used their chelicerae to rip off pieces small enough to swallow. Young individuals may also have fallen prey to cannibalism by larger adults.

&quot;Eurypterus&quot; were most probably marine animals, as their remains are mostly found in intertidal shallow environments. The concentrations of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; fossils in certain sites has been interpreted to be a result of mass mating and molting behavior. Juveniles were likely to have inhabited nearshore hypersaline environments, safer from predators, and moved to deeper waters as they grew older and larger. Adults that reach sexual maturity would then migrate en masse to shore areas in order to mate, lay eggs, and molt. Activities that would have made them more vulnerable to predators. This could also explain why the vast majority of fossils found in such sites are molts and not of actual animals. The same behavior can be seen in modern horseshoe crabs.

===Respiration===
Examinations of the respiratory systems of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; have led many paleontologists to conclude that it was capable of breathing air and walking on land for a short amount of time. &quot;Eurypterus&quot; had two types of respiratory systems. Its main organs for breathing were the book gills inside the segments of the mesosoma. These structures were supported by semicircular &#x27;ribs&#x27; and were probably attached near the center of the body, similar to the gills of modern horseshoe crabs. They were protected under platelike appendages (which actually formed the apparent &#x27;belly&#x27; of &quot;Eurypterus&quot;) known as Blattfüsse. These gills may have also played a role in osmoregulation.

The second system are the Kiemenplatten, also referred to as gill-tracts. These oval-shaped areas within the body wall of the preabdomen. Their surfaces are covered with numerous small spines arranged into hexagonal &#x27;rosettes&#x27;. These areas were vascularized, hence the conclusion that they were secondary breathing organs.

The function of the book gills are usually interpreted to be for aquatic breathing, while the Kiemenplatten are supplementary for temporary breathing on land. However, some authors have argued that the two systems alone could not have supported an organism the size of &quot;Eurypterus&quot;. Both structures might actually have been for breathing air and the true gills (for underwater breathing) of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; have yet to be discovered. &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, however, were undoubtedly primarily aquatic.

===Ontogeny===
Juvenile &quot;Eurypterus&quot; differed from adults in several ways. Their carapaces were narrower and longer (parabolic) in contrast to the trapezoidal carapaces of adults. The eyes are aligned almost laterally but move to a more anterior location during growth. The preabdomen also lengthened, increasing the overall length of the ophisthosoma. The swimming legs also became narrower and the telsons shorter and broader (though in &quot;E. tetragonophthalmus&quot; and &quot;E. henningsmoeni&quot; the telsons changed from being angular in juveniles to larger and more rounded in adults). All these changes are believed to be a result of the respiratory and reproductive requirements of adults.

==Paleoecology==
Members of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; existed for a relatively short time, yet they are the most abundant eurypterids found today. They flourished between the Late Llandovery epoch (around 432 million years ago) to sometime during the Přídolí epoch (418.1 million years ago) of the Silurian period. A span of only around 10 to 14 million years.

During this period, the landmasses were mostly restricted to the southern hemisphere of the Earth, with the supercontinent Gondwana straddling the South Pole. The equator had three continents (Avalonia, Baltica, and Laurentia) which slowly drifted together to form the second supercontinent of Laurussia (also known as Euramerica, not to be confused with Laurasia).

The ancestors of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; were believed to have originated from Baltica (eastern Laurussia, modern western Eurasia) based on the earliest recorded fossils. During the Silurian, they spread to Laurentia (western Laurussia, modern North America) when the two continents began to collide. They rapidly colonized the continent as invasive species, becoming the most dominant eurypterid in the region. This accounts for why they are the most commonly found genus of eurypterids today. &quot;Eurypterus&quot; (and other members of Eurypteroidea), however, were unable to cross vast expanses of oceans between the two supercontinents during the Silurian. Their range were thus limited to the coastlines and the large, shallow, and hypersaline inland seas of Laurussia.

They are now only known from fossils from North America, Europe, and northwestern Asia, cratons that were the former components of Laurussia. While three species of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; were purportedly discovered in China in 1957, the evidence of them belonging to the genus (or if they were even eurypterids at all) is nonexistent. No other traces of &quot;Eurypterus&quot; in modern continents from Gondwana are currently known.

&quot;Eurypterus&quot; are very common fossils in their regions of occurrence, millions of specimens are possible in a given area, though access to the rock formations may be difficult. Most fossil eurypterids are the disjointed shed exoskeleton (known as exuviae) of individuals after molting (ecdysis). Some are complete but are most probably exuviae as well. Fossils of the actual remains of eurypterids (i.e. their carcasses) are relatively rare. Fossil eurypterids are often deposited in characteristic windrows, probably a result of wave and wind action.

<text>A Technische Hochschule (, plural: &quot;Technische Hochschulen&quot;, abbreviated &quot;TH&quot;) is a type of university focusing on engineering sciences in Germany. Previously, it also existed in Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands (), and Finland (, ). In the 1970s (in Germany) and the 1980s (in the Netherlands), the &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot; emerged into the (German) or (Dutch). Since 2009, several German universities of applied sciences were renamed as .

== Terminology ==

In German-language countries, the term &quot;Hochschule&quot; is more general than &quot;Universität&quot; (plural: &quot;Universitäten&quot;) and also encompasses universities which do not have the right to confer doctorates and habilitations, in contrast to &quot;Universitäten&quot;. Today, &quot;Universitäten&quot; as well as other &quot;Hochschulen&quot; call themselves &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot; for historical reasons. However, a &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot; with the status of a &quot;Universität&quot; is regarded as a &quot;Technische Universität&quot; despite the name.

== History ==

Since the Middle Ages, higher education institutions in Europe were called a university only if a certain classical of subjects encompassing philosophy, medicine, law and theology was taught. When engineering sciences became more important in academica due to the Industrial Revolution, institutions of tertiary education devoted to these were denied the prestigious denomination &quot;university&quot;, and had to use the more general term &quot;Hochschule&quot; instead.

It was a major breakthrough, then, when in the first half of the 20th century, some &quot;Technische Hochschulen&quot; in Germany and &quot;Technische Hogescholen&quot; in the Netherlands were given the right to award the doctoral degrees, and again later when they were allowed to call themselves universities. This change of status was accompanied by a broader spectrum of academic disciplines and more fundamental research.

While most former &quot;Technische Hochschulen&quot; opted to change their name to &quot;Technische Universität&quot; to reflect their new status, some of them preferred to maintain their traditional and established names, most notably the RWTH Aachen in Germany as well as ETH Zurich and EPF Lausanne in Switzerland.

Starting in 2009, several German universities of applied sciences (&quot;Fachhochschulen&quot;) with a technical focus have changed their names to &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot;.

== In Finland ==

The concept of a TH exists also in Finland as &quot;teknillinen korkeakoulu&quot;, which is equivalent to a TH. Examples include Teknillinen korkeakoulu in Espoo, Tampereen teknillinen korkeakoulu and Lappeenrannan teknillinen korkeakoulu. Similarly to German speaking countries, most of them later changed their name to &quot;teknillinen yliopisto&quot;, which is equivalent to a TU. However, Teknillinen korkeakoulu retained its old name until it merged with two other universities to form the current Aalto University.

<text>Landeck () is a city in the Austrian state of Tyrol, the capital of the district of Landeck.

==Geography==
Landeck is located in the Tyrolean Oberland in the west of the state at an elevation of about . The town is situated in the valley of the Inn River at the confluence with the Sanna tributary, between the Lechtal Alps, part of the Northern Limestone Alps in the north, and the Ötztal Alps and Samnaun Alps ranges of the Central Eastern Alps in the south. 

The Inn valley is an important transport route from Tyrol to the west across the Arlberg massif. In the south, the Reschen Pass at the main chain of the Alps leads to the Vinschgau region in Italian South Tyrol.

===Climate===
==History==

In ancient times, the &quot;Via Claudia Augusta&quot; ran across the Reschen Pass and through the Inn Valley Landeck, connecting the Roman &quot;Italia&quot; peninsula with the &quot;Raetia&quot; province conquered in 15 BC. Throughout the Middle Ages the valley remained an important junction of trade routes leading to Augsburg via the Fern Pass and westwards across the Arlberg. From the late 13th century onwards the Meinhardiner counts of Tyrol controlled the area from their stronghold at Landeck Castle.

Until 1867 Landeck (then spelled &quot;Landek&quot;) formed part of the Habsburg monarchy (Austrian Empire from 1804), except for a short period during the Napoleonic wars (1806-1814) when it was ceded to the Kingdom of Bavaria along with the rest of Tyrol. From 1867 (following the compromise of 1867) it formed part of the Cisleithanian (Austrian) part of Austria-Hungary; the spelling was also changed to &quot;Landeck&quot; in that year. After 1893 the name was officially changed again to &quot;Landeck in Tirol&quot;. Throughout these periods it was the capital of the district of the same name, one of the 21 &quot;&quot; in the Tyrol province.

From 1782 a first pass road was built across the Arlberg at the behest of Emperor Joseph II; it was significantly enlarged until 1824. Landeck received access to the Arlberg railway in 1883. In 1904 it was elevated to the status of a market town, and finally was granted town privileges in 1923.

Landeck was also used as a military base for Austrian mountain troops before the second world war, later, they became a unit of the German Wehrmacht.

During the Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot; to Nazi Germany, Landeck was merged with neighboring Zams in 1939; however, both municipalities again split after World War II. Landeck was also the site of a UNRRA displaced person camp in the French sector of Allied-occupied Austria.

==Population==

==Personalities==
* Raoul Schrott (born 1964), author
* Anna Schuppe (1829-1903), author and composer

== Transport ==

Landeck-Zams station is an important hub for regional coach lines as well as a noteworthy stop for international trains on the Arlberg railway from the Tyrolean capital Innsbruck via the Arlberg Railway Tunnel to Bludenz in Vorarlberg. Landeck is also the terminus of the parallel Inn Valley Autobahn, which continues as &quot;S 16 Schnellstraße&quot; to the Arlberg Road Tunnel in the west.

<text>Between 1889 and 1949, the French Navy built a series of pre-dreadnought, dreadnought, and fast battleships, ultimately totaling thirty-four vessels: twenty-three pre-dreadnoughts, seven dreadnoughts, and four fast battleships. Another seven—five dreadnoughts and two fast battleships—were cancelled in various stages of construction (one of which was converted into an aircraft carrier while being built) and seven more were cancelled before work began. The first battleship construction program followed a period of confusion in strategic thinking in France over the optimal shape of the fleet. At the time, the French naval command consisted of competing factions, with one that favored building fleets of capital ships, continuing the program of traditional ironclad warships that had dominated the fleet in the 1860s and 1870s. The other major faction preferred the &quot;Jeune École&quot; doctrine, which emphasized the use of cheap torpedo boats to destroy expensive capital ships. During the period, naval construction decisions often depended on the Minister of the Navy in office at the time.

A pair of ironclad battleships were cancelled by Admiral Théophile Aube, an adherent of the &quot;Jeune École&quot;, but one of the two was redesigned as the pre-dreadnought following Aube&#x27;s departure. By the end of the decade, the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 that considerably strengthened the Royal Navy provided the justification the battleship faction needed to embark on a similar naval expansion program. The French replied with the &quot;Statut Naval&quot; (Naval Law) of 1890 that projected a total force of twenty-eight battleships. The initial program ordered four ships, with a fifth added during the design process: , , , , and . These were experimental ships, built to different designs but all to the same broad specifications; they were all characterized by pronounced tumblehome and a lozenge arrangement of a mixed-caliber main battery. All five proved to be disappointments, owing to poor stability and poor resistance to underwater attacks.

The navy then began a series of standardized ships designed by a single architect; these were the three and the derivatives and . The initial series of French battleships saw relatively little activity, being primarily occupied with training activities through the 1890s and 1900s. They alternated between the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons before being withdrawn from front-line service at the end of the first decade of the 20th century as more modern battleships entered service. In 1900, the French government passed a new &quot;Statut Naval&quot; to counter growing German naval strength, which resulted in the two - and four s; they were very similar but differed in their secondary battery. These vessels proved to be much more successful than the earlier battleships of the French fleet, and they formed the backbone of the Mediterranean Squadron when war came in 1914.

A new &quot;Statut Naval&quot; in 1906 brought about the construction of the six s and the seven dreadnoughts of the and es. The &quot;Danton&quot;s were pre-dreadnought vessels built after the launch of the British &quot;all-big-gun&quot; rendered such vessels obsolescent, though the French at that time preferred the higher rate of fire of the lighter secondary guns. Convinced of the need to follow suit with dreadnoughts of their own, the French ordered the four &quot;Courbet&quot;s in 1910 followed by three &quot;Bretagne&quot;s in 1912. These would be the last battleships completed for two decades, as World War I forced the French to cancel the and es (ordered for the 1913 and 1915 programs) as industrial and financial resources were diverted to the French Army and financial limitations after the war prevented further construction. During the war, the bulk of the French fleet was occupied with guarding the southern end of the Adriatic Sea to contain the Austro-Hungarian Navy, while older vessels were used elsewhere, particularly during the Dardanelles campaign, where &quot;Bouvet&quot; was sunk in 1915. After the war, the surviving pre-dreadnoughts were either scrapped or reduced to secondary roles.

By the mid-1930s, the French again embarked on a naval construction program to counter the German and Italian fleets, resulting in the two s and fours; of the four &quot;Richelieu&quot;s that were planned, two were cancelled by the start of World War II, and only one was completed in time to see action during the war. A final design, the , was authorized in 1940 after the war began but were cancelled following France&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of France. The two &quot;Dunkerque&quot;s saw limited action during the war, with being sunk during the British attack on Mers-el-Kébir to prevent her from being seized by the Germans. and were also sunk there, and the third member of the class, , was seized by the British and turned over to the Free French Naval Forces. Refloated and returned to Toulon, &quot;Dunkerque&quot; and &quot;Provence&quot; were later scuttled there with the former&#x27;s sister ship when the French intentionally scuttled the fleet to prevent German soldiers from capturing the vessels. &quot;Richelieu&quot; meanwhile was overhauled in the United States and served with the Free French from 1943. , with only one main battery gun turret operational, briefly engaged United States forces during Operation Torch in November 1942, and was eventually completed in the late 1940s. Both she and &quot;Richelieu&quot; served as training ships before eventually being decommissioned in 1968.



==Pre-dreadnought battleships==
===&quot;Brennus&quot;===

&quot;Brennus&quot;, built in the late 19th century, was the first pre-dreadnought battleship of the French Navy. During this period, the French Navy experimented with the &quot;Jeune École&quot;, which emphasized cheap torpedo boats and cruisers instead of the expensive ironclad warships that had dominated naval construction in the 1860s and 1870s, and so the navy ordered a series of experimental designs to determine the most effective ship types. Admiral Théophile Aube, then the Minister of the Navy and a proponent of the &quot;Jeune École&quot;, cancelled a pair of ironclad battleships in 1886, but after Aube left office his successor allowed one of the vessels to be redesigned as a modern pre-dreadnought battleship. &quot;Brennus&quot; was the only vessel built to her design, which had been prepared by Charles Ernest Huin, though it provided the basis for several subsequent ships. She departed from earlier French ironclad battleship designs by introducing a number of innovations. These included a main battery of heavy guns mounted on the centerline, homogeneous steel armor, and the first use of Belleville boilers.

&quot;Brennus&quot; spent the majority of her career in the Mediterranean Squadron, initially serving as its flagship. In 1900, she accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer &quot;Framée&quot;. As newer battleships were commissioned into the fleet, &quot;Brennus&quot; was relegated to the Reserve Squadron in the early 1900s; she spent this period largely inactive with a reduced crew, being reactivated for training exercises with the rest of the fleet. She was used as a training ship from 1908 to 1914. By the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, her old age and poor condition prevented her from seeing action and she was instead reduced to a hulk. She was ultimately stricken from the naval register in 1919 and sold for scrap three years later.

===&quot;Charles Martel&quot;===


&quot;Charles Martel&quot; was the first of a group of five broadly similar battleships ordered during the 1890 construction program as part of the French response to a major British naval construction program. The five ships were built to the same basic design parameters, though the individual architects were allowed to deviate from each other in lesser details. The ships were ordered in response to the British Naval Defence Act of 1889, which had authorized the construction of the eight s; the French law aimed to keep the fleet in a position of relative parity with the Royal Navy. A total of twenty-eight battleships were to be built throughout the program. To keep costs down and minimize objections from the Chamber of Deputies, the displacement of the new ships would be limited to . The basic design for the first ship, &quot;Charles Martel&quot;, was also prepared by Huin, who based it on &quot;Brennus&quot;, though the armament was arranged in the lozenge layout that had been used on a number of older ironclad battleships like the . The ship proved to be a disappointment in service, as did her four half-sisters, all of which suffered from poor stability, largely a result of their pronounced tumblehome and overloaded construction.

The ship spent her career with the Mediterranean Squadron. In 1897, she joined the International Squadron sent to intervene in the 1897–1898 Greek uprising on Crete against rule by the Ottoman Empire. &quot;Charles Martel&quot; served as the flagship of the 2nd Division of the Mediterranean Squadron beginning in 1900 before being transferred to the Reserve Squadron in 1902. There, she served as the flagship until she was replaced in 1903. &quot;Charles Martel&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron in 1910 and was then moved to the newly created 3rd Battle Squadron the next year. She returned to reserve status in 1912 and saw no further activity, ultimately being scrapped in 1922.

===&quot;Carnot&quot;===


&quot;Carnot&quot; was ordered under the same program that produced &quot;Charles Martel&quot;, and like the other vessel, she was largely based on &quot;Brennus&quot; and &quot;Magenta&quot;. But rather than simply repeat the same design, the French Naval Staff decided to allow different naval architects to build several different designs to evaluate the competing proposals for future programs. &quot;Carnot&quot; was designed by Victor Saglio, the Under-director of Naval Construction in Toulon. Compared to &quot;Charles Martel&quot;, &quot;Carnot&quot; was broadly similar, with the same main battery, though she had a smaller superstructure in an attempt to minimize topweight and thus instability that plagued many French capital ships during this period. The ship was nevertheless still too top-heavy and proved to suffer from insufficient stability. Modifications were made to the ship after she was completed, but they did not solve the problem, and like the rest of the ships of the 1890 program, &quot;Carnot&quot; was not a particularly successful vessel.

The ship&#x27;s early career followed a similar trajectory to &quot;Charles Martel&quot;″s; she spent much of it in the Mediterranean Squadron, and she too served with the International Squadron in 1897. She thereafter began alternating stints in the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons; she was with the Northern Squadron in 1901, followed by a brief return to the Mediterranean as part of the Reserve Squadron in 1903. The year 1904 saw her back with the Northern Squadron, where she remained until 1907, when she was assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron in the Mediterranean. In early 1911, the unit was moved to Brest, France, before returning to Toulon later that year, where it was renumbered as the 3rd Squadron. &quot;Carnot&quot; was reduced to reserve in 1913 and was ultimately broken up in 1922.

===&quot;Jauréguiberry&quot;===

&quot;Jauréguiberry&quot; was designed by Amable Lagane, the naval architect who had overseen the construction of one of the &quot;Magneta&quot;-class ironclads, and as a result, the ship was heavily influenced by the earlier vessel, particularly in the vessel&#x27;s comparatively short and wide hull. The Chilean ironclad , then being built in the same shipyard and also designed by Lagane, also proved to be influential. &quot;Capitán Prat&quot;″s secondary battery was mounted in twin-gun turrets to save weight and space, and Lagane adopted that innovation for &quot;Jauréguiberry&quot;, the first time such an arrangement was used on a French battleship. Like her other French contemporaries, she was unstable and suffered from poor seakeeping, a result of their limited displacement.

As with the other battleships built during this period, &quot;Jauréguiberry&quot; had a relatively uneventful peacetime career. She suffered several minor accidents, including a pair of accidental explosions of torpedo compressed air chambers in 1897 and 1905. Also in 1897, she joined &quot;Charles Martel&quot; and &quot;Carnot&quot; in the International Squadron for operations off Crete. In 1913, the ship was assigned to the Training Division, thereafter serving with the Special Division in 1914. After the outbreak of World War I, the ship was sent to cover troopship convoys from North Africa to France and was later stationed in the Syrian Division in early 1915. &quot;Jauréguiberry&quot; then joined the Dardanelles Division for operations against the Ottoman Empire, including supporting the Landing at Cape Helles in April 1915. She then returned to Syria, where she remained largely until 1918 when she was reduced to reserve status. Decommissioned in 1919, she was converted into a barracks ship in 1920 and was ultimately broken up in 1934.

===&quot;Masséna&quot;===

&quot;Masséna&quot; was designed by Louis de Bussy, who had also designed the revolutionary armored cruiser ; like the other members of the 1890 program, &quot;Masséna&quot; was built within the same displacement limitations and accordingly suffered from the same stability and seakeeping problems. She also retained the same lozenge arrangement of her half-sisters. The ship introduced one significant innovation to French capital ship design: the three-shaft arrangement for her propulsion system. All previous French capital ships had used two screws. She was also the first ship to mount the improved 1893 versions of the 305 mm and 274 mm main guns—albeit of an experimental 45-caliber (cal.) version that was later reduced to 40-cal. in later vessels—that was to equip all French battleships for more than a decade.

The ship&#x27;s career was uneventful; she served as the flagship of the Northern Squadron for her first years in service. In 1903, she was transferred to the Reserve Division of the Mediterranean Squadron. For the next several years, she was periodically reactivated to take part in training exercises with the rest of the fleet, before being reduced to reserve again in 1913. Hulked in 1915, &quot;Masséna&quot; was ultimately scuttled in November 1915 to form a breakwater to protect the vessels that evacuated the Allied army that had been defeated in the Gallipoli campaign.

===&quot;Bouvet&quot;===

&quot;Bouvet&quot; was the last and most successful member of the 1890 program; she was the third vessel designed by Huin. He used the experience gathered with &quot;Charles Martel&quot; to produce an improved version in an attempt to correct the faults of the other vessels ordered under the program. &quot;Bouvet&quot;″s superstructure was smaller than the other vessels, and though she was not as top-heavy as the other ships, she still had insufficient stability, which contributed to her eventual loss in 1915. This was largely a result of the pronounced tumblehome and an insufficiently subdivided hull that was not able to cope with underwater damage. The ship was the first major French warship to be completed with an integrated fire-control system that coordinated the rangefinders, observers, and the gun crews with a central command post to direct the aiming of her main guns.

&quot;Bouvet&quot; spent her career in the Mediterranean Squadron, occupied primarily with training exercises and cruises. In 1903, she was involved in a collision with the battleship that saw both vessels slightly damaged and both ships&#x27; captains relieved of duty. She assisted with relief efforts after Mount Vesuvius erupted in 1906 and the following year she was transferred to the 2nd Battle Squadron, part of what was then the Mediterranean Fleet. Unlike her four half-sisters, she remained in active service with the fleet at the outbreak of World War I, and after covering convoys from North Africa, she was sent to the Dardanelles. From February to March 1915, she participated in several attacks on the Ottoman coastal fortifications guarding the straits, culminating in a major attempt to force the straits on 18 March. During the battle, &quot;Bouvet&quot; was heavily engaged by Ottoman artillery, suffered eight hits, but had neutralized one fortress&#x27;s guns before she struck a naval mine that caused uncontrolled flooding. She capsized and sank with heavy loss of life; 24 officers and 619 enlisted men were killed in the sinking.

===&quot;Charlemagne&quot; class===

The Minister of the Navy, Auguste Burdeau, instructed the naval design staff to prepare a new battleship proposal that was limited to in 1892. The weight reduction was to be achieved by returning to twin-gun turrets for the main battery, which would halve the number of turrets and thus reduce the weight that would be expended armoring them. Burdeau initially suggested a battery of two 305 mm guns in a turret forward and two 274 mm guns in a turret aft, but it was determined that the smaller gun would be incapable of penetrating the armor on the latest British battleships, so a uniform battery of 305 mm guns was adopted. The Navy requested several proposals for the new ships, but negative experience with the experimental series of battleships ordered under the 1890 program led to a decision to build three ships to the same plan. During the design process, the various designers found it difficult to stay within the 11,000-ton limit while incorporating the necessary offensive and defensive characteristics. The naval command accepted the growth of the design and in 1893 selected the proposal prepared by Jules Thibaudier, the director of the Arsenal de Rochefort shipyard, with construction beginning on the first of three vessels later that year.

The first two ships—&quot;Gaulois&quot; and —were briefly assigned to the Northern Squadron before being moved to the Mediterranean Squadron in 1899, where they were joined by the next year. The last member of the class became the squadron flagship. The ships were involved in a number of accidents: &quot;Gaulois&quot; collided with the destroyer in 1900 and &quot;Bouvet&quot; in 1903, &quot;Saint Louis&quot; was struck by the destroyer and rammed the submarine in 1911 and 1912, respectively. The new battleship replaced &quot;Saint Louis&quot; as the flagship in 1904, and the three &quot;Charlemagne&quot;s were moved to the North Sea in 1909 and returned to the Mediterranean in 1912. They escorted convoys at the start of World War I and later took part in the Dardanelles campaign, where &quot;Gaulois&quot; was badly damaged by Ottoman artillery fire. &quot;Gaulois&quot; was later torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in 1916 and the other two vessels saw little activity thereafter, being withdrawn from service in mid-1917. &quot;Charlemagne&quot; was sold for scrap in 1923, while &quot;Saint Louis&quot; remained in the navy&#x27;s inventory as a barracks ship until 1931, when she was struck from the naval register and sold two years later.

===&quot;Iéna&quot;===

The Board of Construction requested an improved version of the &quot;Charlemagne&quot; class in 1897, which was to correct the stability problems that perennially plagued French battleships of the period. The Navy Minister asked Thibaudier to design a larger version of the ship, with displacement increased to 12,000 t, as the naval staff had determined that, like the ships of the 1890 program, the &quot;Charlemagne&quot;s represented an attempt to fit too much into a limited displacement. Thibaudier prepared the next design, which was in many respects a simple repeat of the &quot;Charlemagne&quot;s, incorporating relatively minor improvements, including a more effective armor layout (the result of using Harvey armor to reduce the thickness but not the effectiveness of armor) and a heavier secondary battery. &quot;Iéna&quot; retained the pronounced tumblehome of the earlier French battleships, which was a primary cause of the ships&#x27; poor stability. She was nevertheless a good sea-boat and very maneuverable.

On entering service, &quot;Iéna&quot; became the flagship of the 2nd Battle Division in the Mediterranean Squadron. She thereafter embarked on the routine of training exercises and cruises with the rest of the fleet. Her career passed uneventfully, apart from a collision with a torpedo boat off Toulon in 1906 that resulted in the latter&#x27;s sinking. The ship&#x27;s career was cut short in March 1907 when, while in drydock in Toulon, a magazine explosion destroyed the ship. An investigation blamed &quot;Poudre B&quot;, the smokeless propellant used by the French Navy for its shells. The wreck was repaired to make her watertight and was refloated in 1909 for use as a target ship, being partially broken up between 1913 and 1914 off Porquerolles, though parts of the ship remained there until 1957 when final demolition was completed.

===&quot;Suffren&quot;===

The Navy Minister issued a request for a new battleship in 1898 that was to be an improved version of the basic &quot;Charlemagne&quot;/&quot;Iéna&quot; design. The funding for the ship had already been authorized and so displacement was limited to the same as that of &quot;Iéna&quot;. As a result, Thibaudier was constrained in what he could accomplish with the design, and so he considered improvements to stability, the caliber and arrangement of the secondary battery, and the armor layout of the hull. He considered the use of twin-gun turrets for the secondary battery, but concerns over the risk that damage would disable two guns rather than just one and the arrangement for effective fields of fire led the command to reject them. Requests from the various technical sections of the French Navy for increased ammunition storage, improved armor for the secondary battery, and accommodations for a flag officer and his staff complicated Thibaudier&#x27;s task. As a result of the competing requests, the secondary battery could only be strengthened by the addition of a pair of guns. Increases in the ship&#x27;s length necessitated improvements to the Arsenal de Brest shipyard before work could begin.

&quot;Suffren&quot; became the flagship of the 1st Battle Division after her commissioning. Her peacetime career was marked by a number of accidents: she collided with &quot;Saint Louis&quot; in 1905 and the submarine in 1906, nearly sinking the latter. She was moored next to &quot;Iéna&quot; when the latter vessel exploded in 1907; the blast hurled burning fragments that set &quot;Suffren&quot; on fire. She broke her starboard propeller shaft while underway in 1910 and lost power during maneuvers in 1911 and collided with the battleship , though she was not seriously damaged in any of these incidents. During World War I, she took part in the Dardanelles campaign through the end of 1915. In 1916, she joined the main French fleet in Greek waters, where she saw little activity. While en route to Lorient for a refit in November 1916, she was torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat off the coast of Portugal, killing her entire crew.

===&quot;République&quot; class===

The two &quot;République&quot;-class ships were ordered under the 1900 Fleet Law, which was a reaction to the German 1898 Naval Law; the French law called for six new battleships, which were initially to be a homogeneous class. Louis-Émile Bertin prepared the design for the new ships, with an allowed displacement of up to , a major increase over earlier vessels. Bertin correctly perceived the flaws of the narrow belt armor of earlier French battleships, and so designed what was to become &quot;République&quot; with a more comprehensive arrangement. Developments with heavier secondary batteries abroad, particularly with the British s, led to the last four ships being redesigned with more powerful secondary guns, resulting in four-ship . Like many late French pre-dreadnoughts, their lengthy design and construction periods resulted in their completion after the revolutionary British &quot;all-big-gun&quot; battleship .

Both vessels served with the Mediterranean Fleet throughout their careers, initially with the 1st Squadron and, after the ships entered service, with the 2nd Squadron. They took part in convoy escort operations in the first days of World War I and then deployed to the southern Adriatic Sea to engage the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The Austro-Hungarians refused to take the bait, and the French only caught the small protected cruiser , which they sank in the Battle of Antivari. and were later involved in Allied efforts to force Greece to enter the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary, which ultimately succeeded in 1917. &quot;République&quot; was partially disarmed in early 1918 to provide guns for the French Army and thereafter became a training ship, but &quot;Patrie&quot; remained in service until 1919, when she, too, was reduced to a training role. The lead ship was sold for scrap in 1921, but &quot;Patrie&quot; was retained for training purposes until 1936, when she was finally decommissioned and sold the following year.

===&quot;Liberté&quot; class===

Initially meant to be identical to the &quot;République&quot;s, the four &quot;Liberté&quot;-class ships were redesigned after foreign battleships began to carry heavier secondary guns; these included the British &quot;King Edward VII&quot; class, armed with secondaries, which were in turn a response to American and Italian battleships armed with guns. Accordingly, the Naval General Staff requested the last four members of the 1900 program to be redesigned to carry 194 mm guns. Ironically, Bertin had suggested the exact same caliber during the initial design process, which the General Staff rejected over fears that the rate of fire would fall. The two classes were otherwise nearly identical, which has led some historians, including John Jordan and Philippe Caresse, to consider them to be one class with two variants.

The four ships&#x27; service history largely mirrored that of the &quot;République&quot; class. In 1909, , , and traveled to the United States for the Hudson–Fulton Celebration and, in 1911, they joined the &quot;République&quot;s in the 2nd Squadron. In September that year, &quot;Liberté&quot; was destroyed by an accidental explosion while moored in Toulon; the cause of the blast was determined to be the same unstable &quot;Poudre B&quot; that had destroyed &quot;Iéna&quot; in 1907. Along with their squadron mates, the three surviving &quot;Liberté&quot;s escorted convoys early in World War I and took part in the Battle of Antivari. &quot;Vérité&quot; briefly took part in operations against the Ottomans in November and December, and later took part in the operations in Greece in 1916 and early 1917. After securing Greece&#x27;s alliance, the ships returned to the fleet&#x27;s main wartime anchorage at Corfu, where it remained for the rest of the war. Immediately after the German surrender, &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;Démocratie&quot; were sent to the Black Sea to oversee German demilitarization and then to take part in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. War-weary sailors later mutinied in several vessels and forced the French to withdraw in 1919. The three ships saw no further significant service and all were discarded in 1921–1922

===&quot;Danton&quot; class===

Following the beginning of construction of &quot;Liberté&quot;, France began planning for the next major construction program. By this time, France had concluded the &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot; with Britain, and the increasingly powerful German fleet was viewed as the most significant threat; the program of 1906 called for a total of sixteen new battleships to be built by 1919 to counter the Germans. In an effort to control the cost of the next ships to be built, the Minister of the Navy, Gaston Thomson, imposed a limit of . The design staff began its work in the aftermath of the Battle of Tsushima; the French Navy determined that Japanese success in the battle had been the result of the high speed of their ships and the large number of medium-caliber guns that inflicted significant damage to the unarmored superstructures of the Russian warships. As a result, the navy decided to adopt a heavier secondary battery than the preceding &quot;Liberté&quot;s, but decided against following many other major navies then building &quot;all-big-gun&quot; battleships. The naval command determined that replacing the planned guns with single 305 mm guns would have increased displacement over the limit and reduced the rate of fire. The navy did introduce a new, longer 45-cal. version of the 305 mm gun, the Modèle 1906 type. Pressure from Parliament to keep technological pace with foreign navies led the designers to adopt steam turbines, the first time they were used in French capital ships. The navy had initially intended to build three ships as the first stage of the program, but delays during the design process led to the authorization of six ships to account for the slowdown.

After entering service in 1911, all six ships were assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron, where they remained until the outbreak of World War I. Like the rest of the fleet, they escorted convoys from North Africa at the start of the war and then went to the Adriatic, seeing action at the Battle of Antivari, with the exception of , which was being refitted in Toulon at the time. The six &quot;Danton&quot;s remained based at Corfu and Malta for much of the war to blockade the Austro-Hungarian fleet. During this period, portions of the ships&#x27; crews were stripped to provide men for anti-submarine warships to combat the German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats; combined with coal shortages that curtailed operations, the reduction in crews led to crippling morale problems for the fleet. In March 1917, was sunk by a German U-boat. After the war, the surviving ships participated in the intervention in Russia in 1919 and &quot;Mirabeau&quot; was damaged after running aground off the Crimea; she was never repaired and was eventually broken up. The other vessels were modernized in the early 1920s, with the exception of , which was in poor condition. They continued on in secondary roles into the 1930s, and remained in use as a depot ship until 1942, when she was captured by German forces in Toulon, ultimately being bombed and sunk in 1944.

==Dreadnought battleships==
===&quot;Courbet&quot; class===


The French naval command had become convinced by 1909 that the so-called dreadnought battleships were superior to the mixed-battery ships like the &quot;Danton&quot;s, and so the new naval minister, Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère, instructed the design staff to prepare an all-big-gun proposal. Displacement was limited to , which corresponded to contemporary foreign dreadnoughts. Consideration was given to uniform batteries of 240, 274, and 305 mm guns; the Technical Section prepared three designs, the first of which was essentially a repeat &quot;Danton&quot; with increased ammunition storage, the second was a &quot;Danton&quot; variant with the six 240 mm wing turrets replaced by four 305 mm turrets, bringing the total number of guns to twelve. The turrets were arranged in a superfiring pair forward, two wing turrets amidships, and another superfiring pair aft. The third version included a mix of twin and triple turrets, but Boué de Lapeyrère ordered a modified version of the second proposal, and the first two ships were ordered for the 1910 budget. Two more followed in 1911.

Three of the four ships were completed shortly before World War I, and and carried President Raymond Poincaré on a visit to Russia during the July Crisis, the proximate cause of the war. The ships operated with the main fleet during the conflict and saw little activity after the Battle of Antivari; they suffered the same fate as the &quot;Danton&quot;s, with crews being thinned to provide men for more important vessels. &quot;France&quot; and &quot;Jean Bart&quot; were involved in the intervention in Russia in 1919 and after returning to France later that year, were assigned to the new Western Mediterranean Squadron. In 1922 &quot;France&quot; struck an uncharted rock in Quiberon Bay and sank. The three surviving ships were refitted in the late 1920s and early 1930s. They thereafter served in secondary roles, including as training ships and later as barracks ships. remained in service as a training vessel early in World War II and she shelled German forces during the Battle of France in June 1940 before fleeing to Britain and eventually being sunk as a breakwater for the Normandy invasion. &quot;Jean Bart&quot;, which had been renamed &quot;Océan&quot; in 1937, was seized by the Germans in 1942 and used for weapons tests before being bombed and sunk in 1944. &quot;Paris&quot;, the last surviving member of the class, was also evacuated to Britain after the German invasion and was used as a depot ship first in Britain and then in France until 1955.

===&quot;Bretagne&quot; class===


The &quot;Bretagne&quot; class was modeled on the preceding &quot;Courbet&quot; class, using the same hull design as a result of the size constraints of French shipyards. Design work began before the &quot;Courbet&quot;s had been ordered, and the emphasis was on increasing the caliber of the main battery to match foreign development of the so-called superdreadnought type such as the British . The naval high command initially specified a maximum displacement of and a main battery of twelve guns. The 340 mm turrets were significantly heavier than the 305 mm versions used in the &quot;Courbet&quot;s, and the design staff found it impossible to retain six turrets within the prescribed displacement. They submitted a five-turret design, removing one of the wing turrets and moving the other to the centerline amidships, which kept the same ten-gun broadside. In addition, the belt armor was reduced slightly to accommodate for the greater weight of the main battery. A new naval law was passed in 1912 that projected a fleet of twenty-eight battleships by 1920; three ships were authorized for the 1912 budget, which became the &quot;Bretagne&quot;s.

Upon completion, the ships were assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron and sent to join the fleet at Corfu; by this point, the fleet had settled into the blockade of the southern Adriatic and so the &quot;Bretagne&quot;s saw little activity during the war. The ships spent the 1920s and 1930s in the Mediterranean and Atlantic Squadrons, undergoing periodic refits and modernizations, and in the late 1930s, they took part in the non-intervention patrols off Spain during the Spanish Civil War. After the start of World War II, they operated as convoy escorts in the Atlantic and in 1940, as war with Italy became increasingly likely, they were concentrated with the bulk of the French fleet in the Mediterranean as a deterrent. and were in Mers El Kébir when Germany defeated France in June 1940, and during a British operation to neutralize the French fleet, were attacked in the port by the British Force H. &quot;Bretagne&quot; was destroyed and &quot;Provence&quot; was badly damaged, later being refloated and returned to Toulon for repairs, where she was scuttled in 1942 to prevent her capture by the Germans. Meanwhile, was seized by the British while she was moored in Alexandria, Egypt and then turned over to the Free French Naval Forces. She saw action during the last years of the war bombarding German forces in occupied France. After the war, she was used as a training vessel and later a barracks ship, ultimately being scrapped in 1953.

===&quot;Normandie&quot; class===

Before work on the &quot;Bretagne&quot; class had even begun, the French Navy&#x27;s Technical Committee issued a report in late 1911 criticizing the decision to adopt a centerline, amidships turret based on previous experience with ships in the 1880s; the center turret inflicted excessive blast damage on the superstructure. Work on the next design began in early 1912 and three initial versions were prepared; the first was essentially a repeat of &quot;Bretagne&quot; but the other two attempted a radical solution to the problem identified by the Technical Committee. To avoid the central turret, they proposed a new quadruple turret; the first variant used two of these turrets, each with a twin-turret superfiring above them, and the second incorporated four quadruple turrets with 305 mm guns. The General Staff decided to retain the 340 mm gun and preferred the quadruple turret if development could be completed in time, ultimately settling on a finalized version equipped with three quadruple turrets, one forward and two aft. The 1912 naval law had initially called for two ships to be ordered in 1913 and two more in 1914, but an amendment increased the pace to four in 1913 and a fifth in 1914, owing to the increased tension in Europe during this period.

The first two ships were ordered in April 1913, followed by two more in July, and a fifth vessel in January 1914. Work was halted after the outbreak of war, as resources were diverted to more critical projects for the Army and to complete the &quot;Bretagne&quot;s, then much further along in construction. Much of the material that had been assembled for the ships was used for other purposes, including boilers to replace those of older vessels, and main guns converted into railway guns for the Army. After the war, the first four ships were cancelled and parts of those vessels were used to complete as an aircraft carrier. She remained in service during World War II and the French Indochina War and was ultimately scrapped in 1967.

===&quot;Lyon&quot; class===

The amendment to the 1912 naval law called for four ships to be ordered in 1915. Design work for the new vessels began in mid-1913, and since longer graving docks would soon be completed in Brest and Toulon, the new ships would not be limited by infrastructure. The naval command considered increasing the caliber to to keep pace with the latest British battleships of the , but the French did not yet have a gun of that caliber completed, and the delays necessary to design and test it were deemed unacceptable. Additionally, the French expected to be fighting at ranges where the existing 340 mm gun was able to defeat heavy armor, so there was little need to step up to the larger caliber. The 340 mm gun was adopted, but to improve the ships&#x27; firepower, a fourth quadruple turret was added. The ships were allocated to shipyards in late 1913, with work to begin on the first two in January 1915, with the second pair to follow at an unspecified time. Work to complete the design continued into 1914, but the details of the ships&#x27; underwater protection system had not yet been finalized by the time war broke out in August 1914. With the start of the war, the project was cancelled; no work was done and no material was assembled for the vessels.

==Fast battleships==
===&quot;Dunkerque&quot; class===

In the early 1920s, the major naval powers concluded the Washington Naval Treaty to limit battleship construction; under the terms of the treaty, France was limited to a total of of battleship tonnage. All members of the treaty system were barred from building battleships for a decade, apart from France and Italy, both of which had allotted, since their fleets consisted of older vessels. Financial weakness after the war, coupled with indecision over what type of ship to build delayed the construction of new French battleships. The navy initially conceived of small, fast battleships to counter new Italian heavy cruisers that threatened France&#x27;s lines of communication in the Mediterranean. The advent of the German s, armed with guns, necessitated larger, more capable battleships, with armor heavy enough to defeat the German large-caliber guns. This process eventually produced the &quot;Dunkerque&quot; class.

 and were commissioned in the late 1930s; they spent the majority of their peacetime years conducting training. Following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 that started World War II, the ships were initially used as part of the &quot;Force de Raid&quot; (Raiding Force) to hunt down German commerce raiders and to escort convoys. The ships were moored in Mers El Kébir to deter Italy from joining the war when Germany defeated France in May and June 1940, and were to be demilitarized there under the terms of the Armistice of 22 June 1940. Concerned that the Germans would seize the French fleet, the British launched Operation Catapult to neutralize the vessels; during the attack on Mers-el-Kébir, Force H damaged &quot;Dunkerque&quot; but &quot;Strasbourg&quot; was able to escape the harbor and reach Toulon. After a second attack that sank her, &quot;Dunkerque&quot; was refloated and returned to Toulon as well, before both ships were ultimately scuttled in the harbor to prevent the Germans from seizing them in 1942. Both vessels were eventually broken up in the 1950s.

===&quot;Richelieu&quot; class===

The Italian response to the &quot;Dunkerque&quot;s, the first two s, which displaced and were armed with nine 380 mm guns, prompted France to respond in kind. The French considered a scaled-up version of the &quot;Dunkerque&quot; design armed with eight 380 mm or guns, or a version with three triple-turrets. The design staff quickly determined that the weight of the 406 mm battery would preclude the other technical requirements for the ships and decided that 380 mm was the largest caliber that could be carried in the specified displacement. The design was finalized by August 1935 and two ships were ordered and quickly laid down; because the ships were larger than the shipyards available, the builders adopted a plan to build the bulk of the hull on the slipway and then add bows and sterns after moving them to drydocks. Beginning construction of the ships in late 1935 placed France in violation of the naval arms treaty, as the total tonnage exceeded the 70,000 tons allowed before the building holiday expired in 1936. But the French government had objected to Britain failing to uphold its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles by signing a separate Anglo-German Naval Agreement earlier in 1935, which directly undermined the limitations of German armament imposed by Versailles. Two more ships, to be built to modified designs, were projected, but only &quot;Clemenceau&quot; was laid down before the start of the war. She was quickly cancelled, as was the fourth vessel, &quot;Gascogne&quot;.

Neither or was ready in time to see action before France was defeated in 1940. &quot;Jean Bart&quot; was moved to Casablanca and &quot;Richelieu&quot; fled to Dakar before they could be captured by German forces. The latter was attacked by British forces in July and September to prevent her from being turned over to the Germans, but &quot;Jean Bart&quot; was far from complete and so was ignored. In November 1942, the Allies invaded French North Africa and &quot;Jean Bart&quot; initially fired on the invasion fleet before being disabled by the US battleship . After the invasion, which resulted in French forces in North Africa turning to Free France, &quot;Richelieu&quot; was sent to the United States to be completed and modernized. She thereafter served with the British Home Fleet in the Indian Ocean and later in French Indochina, where she ended the war. &quot;Jean Bart&quot; was finally completed after the war; both vessels continued on in service with the French fleet, primarily as training vessels, before being decommissioned in 1968 and broken up.

===&quot;Alsace&quot; class===

After work on the &quot;Richelieu&quot;s began and the international naval treaty system fell apart following Japan&#x27;s and Italy&#x27;s refusal to sign the Second London Naval Treaty, the French Navy began design studies on the next class of battleships that would take advantage of the escalator clause in the treaty that allowed displacement to be increased to and the main battery to be increased to 406 mm (the treaty had added a limit of guns). The design staff prepared several studies in 1939, all of which were derivatives of the three-turret design that had been drawn up during the &quot;Richelieu&quot; design process. The first variant had nine 380 mm guns in triple turrets, with slightly improved protection over the &quot;Richelieu&quot;s and a more powerful secondary battery. The second version was essentially the same, but scaled up for 406 mm guns, and the third featured three quadruple 380 mm turrets. The navy settled on the first version, as the second variation would have introduced a fourth shell caliber to the fleet, thus complicating logistics, and the third design was too large and expensive. Two ships were authorized in April 1940, with construction to begin in 1941 after the aircraft carrier was launched, but following the French collapse in June, the program was cancelled.

<doc id="892612" wikidata="Q3048989" url="?curid=892612" title="Blast injury">
<text>A blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion. Blast injuries occur with the detonation of high-order explosives as well as the deflagration of low order explosives. These injuries are compounded when the explosion occurs in a confined space.

==Classification==

Blast injuries are divided into four classes: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.

===Primary injuries===
Primary injuries are caused by blast overpressure waves, or shock waves. Total body disruption is the most severe and invariably fatal primary injury. Primary injuries are especially likely when a person is close to an exploding munition, such as a land mine. The ears are most often affected by the overpressure, followed by the lungs and the hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal injuries may present after a delay of hours or even days. Injury from blast overpressure is a pressure and time dependent function. By increasing the pressure or its duration, the severity of injury will also increase.

Extensive damage can also be inflicted upon the auditory system. The tympanic membrane (also known as the eardrum) may be perforated by the intensity of the pressure waves. Furthermore, the hair cells, the sound receptors found within the cochlea, can be permanently damaged and can result in a hearing loss of a mild to profound degree. Additionally, the intensity of the pressure changes from the blast can cause injury to the blood vessels and neural pathways within the auditory system. Therefore, affected individuals can have auditory processing deficits while having normal hearing thresholds. The combination of these effects can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus, headache, vertigo (dizziness), and difficulty processing sound.

In general, primary blast injuries are characterized by the absence of external injuries; thus internal injuries are frequently unrecognized and their severity underestimated. According to the latest experimental results, the extent and types of primary blast-induced injuries depend not only on the peak of the overpressure, but also other parameters such as number of overpressure peaks, time-lag between overpressure peaks, characteristics of the shear fronts between overpressure peaks, frequency resonance, and electromagnetic pulse, among others. There is general agreement that spalling, implosion, inertia, and pressure differentials are the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of primary blast injuries. Thus, the majority of prior research focused on the mechanisms of blast injuries within gas-containing organs and organ systems such as the lungs, while primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury has remained underestimated. &quot;Blast lung&quot; refers to severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding or swelling with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these. It is the most common cause of death among people who initially survive an explosion.

===Secondary injuries===
Secondary injuries are ballistic trauma caused by impacts of flying shrapnels and other objects propelled by the explosion. These injuries may affect any part of the body and sometimes result in penetrating trauma with visible bleeding. At times the propelled object may become embedded in the body, obstructing the loss of blood to the outside. However, there may be extensive blood loss within the body cavities. Secondary blast wounds may be lethal and therefore many anti-personnel explosive devices are designed to generate fast-flying fragments.

Most casualties are caused by secondary injuries as shrapnels generally affect a larger area than the primary blast area, because debris can easily be propelled for hundreds or even thousands of meters. Some explosives, such as nail bombs, are deliberately designed to increase the likelihood of secondary injuries. In other instances, the target provides the raw material for the fragments thrown into surrounding, e.g., shattered glass from a blasted-out window or the glass facade of a building.

===Tertiary injuries===
Displacement of air by the explosion creates a blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Injuries resulting from this type of traumatic impact are referred to as tertiary blast injuries. Tertiary injuries may present as some combination of blunt and penetrating trauma, including bone fractures and coup contre-coup injuries. Children are at particularly high risk of tertiary injury due to their relatively smaller body weight.

===Quaternary injuries===
Quaternary injuries, or other miscellaneous named injuries, are all other injuries not included in the first three classes. These include flash burns, crush injuries, and respiratory injuries.

Traumatic amputations quickly result in death, unless there are available skilled medical personnel or others with adequate training nearby who are able to quickly respond, with the ability for rapid ground or air medical evacuation to an appropriate facility in time, and with tourniquets (for compression of bleeding sites) and other needed equipment (standard, or improvised; sterile, or not) also available, to treat the injuries. Because of this, injuries of this type are generally rare, though not unheard of, in survivors. Whether survivable or not, they are often accompanied by significant other injuries. The rate of eye injury may depend on the type of blast. Psychiatric injury, some of which may be caused by neurological damage incurred during the blast, is the most common quaternary injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder may affect people who are otherwise completely uninjured.

==Mechanism==
Blast injuries can result from various types of incidents ranging from industrial accidents to deliberate attacks. High-order explosives produce a supersonic overpressure shock wave, while low order explosives deflagrate and do not produce an overpressure wave. A blast wave generated by an explosion starts with a single pulse of increased air pressure, lasting a few milliseconds. The negative pressure (suction) of the blast wave follows immediately after the positive wave. The duration of the blast wave depends on the type of explosive material and the distance from the point of detonation. The blast wave progresses from the source of explosion as a sphere of compressed and rapidly expanding gases, which displaces an equal volume of air at a very high velocity. The velocity of the blast wave in air may be extremely high, depending on the type and amount of the explosive used. An individual in the path of an explosion will be subjected not only to excess barometric pressure, but to pressure from the high-velocity wind traveling directly behind the shock front of the blast wave. The magnitude of damage due to the blast wave is dependent on the peak of the initial positive pressure wave, the duration of the overpressure, the medium in which it explodes, the distance from the incident blast wave, and the degree of focusing due to a confined area or walls. For example, explosions near or within hard solid surfaces become amplified two to nine times due to shock wave reflection. As a result, individuals between the blast and a building generally suffer two to three times the degree of injury compared to those in open spaces.

==Neurotrauma==
Blast injuries can cause hidden sensory and brain damage, with potential neurological and neurosensory consequences. It is a complex clinical syndrome caused by the combination of all blast effects, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary blast mechanisms. Blast injuries usually manifest in a form of polytrauma, i.e. injury involving multiple organs or organ systems. Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain. Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, reducing the amount of the oxygen delivered to the brain. Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function. Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue or organs also contributes significantly to blast-induced neurotrauma.

Individuals exposed to blast frequently manifest loss of memory of events before and after explosion, confusion, headache, impaired sense of reality, and reduced decision-making ability. Patients with brain injuries acquired in explosions often develop sudden, unexpected brain swelling and cerebral vasospasm despite continuous monitoring. However, the first symptoms of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) may occur months or even years after the initial event, and are therefore categorized as secondary brain injuries. The broad variety of symptoms includes weight loss, hormone imbalance, chronic fatigue, headache, and problems in memory, speech and balance. These changes are often debilitating, interfering with daily activities. Because BINT in blast victims is underestimated, valuable time is often lost for preventive therapy and/or timely rehabilitation.

==Blast wave PTSD research==
In addition to known post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk factors experienced by both civilians and military personnel in combat areas, in early 2018, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; reported that neuropathology specialist, Dr. Daniel &quot;Dan&quot; Perl, had conducted research on brain tissue exposed to traumatic brain injury (TBI), discovering a causal relationship between IED blast waves and PTSD. Perl was recruited to the faculty of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences as a professor of pathology and to establish the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine mandated by Congress in 2008.

==Casualty estimates and triage==
Explosions in confined spaces or which cause structural collapse usually produce more deaths and injuries. Confined spaces include mines, buildings and large vehicles. For a rough estimate of the total casualties from an event, double the number that present in the first hour. Less injured patients often arrive first, as they take themselves to the nearest hospital. The most severely injured arrive later, via emergency services (&quot;upside-down&quot; triage). If there is a structural collapse, there will be more serious injuries that arrive more slowly.

<doc id="892614" wikidata="Q3064990" url="?curid=892614" title="List of battleships of Italy">
<text>Starting in the 1890s, the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Royal Navy) began building a series of modern battleships. Early designs were marked by their small size, light armor, and high speed compared to contemporary foreign counterparts. The first pre-dreadnought battleship design, the , was constrained by budgetary limits imposed by the legislature. Two ships were ordered by the class&#x27;s namesake, Admiral Simone de Pacoret Saint Bon, though the design was also influenced by Benedetto Brin, who replaced di Saint Bon as naval minister after his death. Brin designed the next pair of battleships, the . These ships were larger than the preceding class, and were intended to challenge the Austro-Hungarian s then under construction. Brin himself died during the construction process. Vittorio Cuniberti designed the next class of small pre-dreadnoughts, the , which were the fastest battleships in the world at the time of their completion. These ships all served in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912, where they were primarily used to provide naval gunfire support for the Italian ground troops, as the Ottoman Navy largely confined itself to port.

By the time that the &quot;Regina Elena&quot;s had been built in the early 1900s, the British battleship had been completed, a revolutionary design that rendered all previous battleships obsolete. Therefore, a new dreadnought-type battleship was needed. The new ship was &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot;, and was designed by Rear Admiral Edoardo Masdea. The Italian Navy built five further battleships to two similar designs: the and es. These six dreadnoughts formed the core of the Italian fleet during World War I, as a further four-ship class was cancelled. Both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies adopted cautious fleet policies and neither chose to risk their capital ships in a major engagement; as a result, the Italian battle line spent the war in harbor and did not see combat. Nevertheless, the dreadnought &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; was destroyed by a magazine explosion in August 1916. The pre-dreadnought &quot;Benedetto Brin&quot; was also destroyed by an internal explosion in September 1915, and her sister &quot;Regina Margherita&quot; was sunk by a German mine in December 1916. The remaining battleships of the &quot;Ammiraglio di Saint Bon&quot; and &quot;Regina Elena&quot; classes were discarded after the end of the war.

In the interwar period, the Italian Navy—along with the rest of the major naval powers—was limited by the Washington Naval Treaty, which granted Italy parity with the French Navy. The Italians had worth of battleship tonnage available for new vessels before they would reach their treaty limits, but they avoided new construction in the 1920s due to severe budgetary problems and to avoid a naval arms race with France. These financial limitations also forced the Italians to scrap &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot; in 1928. Nevertheless, the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; decided to make use of its excess tonnage by the early 1930s, which resulted in the four s. Two were finished early in World War II and were used extensively to escort convoys during the North African Campaign. The third ship, &quot;Roma&quot;, was finished in 1942, but was sunk in September 1943 by a German radio-controlled bomb when Italy surrendered to the Allies. The fourth ship, &quot;Impero&quot;, was never finished and was instead sunk by American bombers and scrapped after the end of the war. The two surviving ships, &quot;Littorio&quot; and &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;, were surrendered to the Allies and were later broken up for scrap. Of the surviving members of the &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; class, &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; was scrapped after the end of the war and &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; was surrendered to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Only the two &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;-class battleships survived in Italian service for any significant length of time after the conclusion of hostilities; both served as training ships until the mid-1950s, when they too were broken up for scrap.

==Pre-dreadnought battleships==
===&quot;Ammiraglio di Saint Bon&quot; class===

The first of the Italian Navy&#x27;s modern battleships, the &quot;Ammiraglio di Saint Bon&quot; class were smaller than their contemporaries due to limitations imposed by the Italian government and indecision in the naval design staff over what kind of battleship should be built. They were designed under the supervision of Admiral Simone di Pacoret Saint Bon, the namesake of the lead ship, and Benedetto Brin. Ultimately, the ships&#x27; small size, weak main battery, and slow speed made them ineffective capital ships, since they were not strong enough to engage foreign battleships, and too slow to catch cruisers.

Both ships served in the active duty squadron early in their careers, and participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912. They took part in the Italian offensives in North Africa and the island of Rhodes, but did not see combat with the Ottoman fleet. They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I, and spent the war in Venice. The ships were discarded shortly after the end of the war, both having been stricken in 1920.

===&quot;Regina Margherita&quot; class===

The pattern of experimentation in Italian capital ship construction continued with the &quot;Regina Margherita&quot; class. The negative experience with the &quot;Ammiraglio di Saint Bon&quot; class convinced the constructors, led by Benedetto Brin, to design a larger battleship that could engage its foreign counterparts. The new class was designed specifically to counter the new s of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. For this purpose, the ships were armed with the gun that had become standard for most pre-dreadnought battleships of the day. As was typical for Italian capital ships of the period, armor protection was reduced in order to secure high speed. Brin died during the construction process, and the Italian Navy named the second vessel after him.

The two ships also saw action in the Italo-Turkish War, alongside the &quot;Ammiraglio di Saint Bon&quot; class in the 3rd Division of the fleet. &quot;Benedetto Brin&quot; took part in the attack on Tripoli in October 1911, and both ships were involved in the campaign to seize Rhodes in the eastern Aegean Sea. The &quot;Regina Margherita&quot; class had become obsolete by the outbreak of World War I and had been reduced to training ships. Both were lost during the war: &quot;Benedetto Brin&quot; to an internal explosion in Brindisi in September 1915, and &quot;Regina Margherita&quot; to a German mine in December 1916.

===&quot;Regina Elena&quot; class===

The final class of Italian pre-dreadnoughts were designed by Vittorio Cuniberti, the naval architect whose projected design for the first &quot;all-big-gun&quot; battleship would quickly make the &quot;Regina Elena&quot; class obsolescent. These ships sacrificed two of the 12-inch guns to obtain a powerful secondary battery of twelve guns. Their high speed—the fastest of any battleship then built, including the revolutionary, turbine-powered —permitted them to also engage cruisers.

All four ships served in the 1st Division of the Italian fleet during the Italo-Turkish War, and were the workhorses of the operations off North Africa and in the eastern Mediterranean. During World War I, the ships were primarily based in Brindisi, Taranto, and Valona; they saw no action during the war due to the cautious fleet policies adopted by both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. The ships remained in the Italian fleet for a few years after the war, but all were discarded and broken up for scrap by 1927.

==Dreadnoughts==
===&quot;Dante Alighieri&quot;===

&quot;Dante Alighieri&quot; was the first dreadnought battleship built by the Italian Navy, and was designed by Rear Admiral Edoardo Masdea. Cuniberti&#x27;s call for heavy artillery arranged to emphasize broadside fire led to the placement of four triple 12-inch gun turrets along the centerline. This allowed a broadside of all twelve guns, while the first generation of British dreadnoughts could only fire eight of their guns on the broadside. &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot; was the first battleship to mount her main battery in triple turrets, though the Austro-Hungarian was completed first.

The ship had a very limited service life. At the outbreak of World War I, she was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron, based in Taranto. But due to the policy of restraint adopted by the Italian Navy, &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot; and the other battleships of the Italian fleet saw no action. Financial limitations in the post-war period forced the navy to scrap the ship to reduce the naval budget. The ship was accordingly stricken on 1 July 1928 and sold for scrap.

===&quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; class===
The first design in the second generation of Italian dreadnoughts, the &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; class was also designed by Edoardo Masdea. They were ordered in response to the French s. They remedied many of the deficiencies of the previous design; the most significant improvement was a dramatically more effective arrangement of the main battery. Ten guns were arranged in twin turrets superfiring over triple turrets forward and aft, and a third triple turret was placed amidships. All thirteen guns could fire on the broadside, but the firing arcs for most of the guns were significantly improved.

The three ships had limited careers during World War I, and did not see action. On the night of 2/3 August 1916, &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; was sunk by an internal explosion. She was raised in 1919; the navy planned to repair and modernize her, but lacked sufficient funds, and she was sold in 1923. The two surviving ships were heavily rebuilt in the mid-1930s, and both saw action during World War II. On the night of 11/12 November 1940, both ships were attacked by British torpedo bombers in the Battle of Taranto. &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; was badly damaged, and had not been fully repaired when Italy surrendered in September 1943. &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; meanwhile escaped unscathed, and participated in the battles of Cape Spartivento and First Sirte in November 1940 and December 1941, respectively. After the end of the war, &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; was scrapped, and &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; was surrendered to the Soviet Union. Renamed &quot;Novorossiysk&quot;, she was ultimately sunk in October 1955 by an old German mine left over from World War II. Her wreck was later salvaged in 1957 and broken up thereafter.

===&quot;Andrea Doria&quot; class===

Vice Admiral Giuseppe Valsecchi was responsible for the next battleship design, the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; class. The class comprised two vessels—&quot;Andrea Doria&quot; and &quot;Duilio&quot;—and the design was based on the previous &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; with minor modifications. These two ships were ordered in response to the French . As with the &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot;s, the two &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;-class battleships were significantly modernized in the late 1930s along similar lines: the central turret was removed, the propulsion system was completely replaced with more efficient machinery, and the secondary battery was replaced with new turret-mounted guns.

The two ships entered service in 1916, and were based in Taranto with the rest of the main fleet for the duration of World War I. Both ships were involved in the Corfu incident in 1923. The ships&#x27; modernization work was completed after Italy entered World War II. &quot;Duilio&quot; was damaged at the Battle of Taranto, while &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was not hit. Both ships were present at the First Battle of Sirte, though only &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; engaged British forces. The two ships survived the war, and were the only battleships the Allies permitted Italy to retain after the conclusion of hostilities. They served in the Italian Navy for another decade until they were discarded in the mid-1950s.

===&quot;Francesco Caracciolo&quot; class===
The next Italian battleship design represented a major qualitative step forward. The design was prepared by Rear Admiral Edgardo Ferrati, and was intended to match the latest foreign battleships, such as the British . The new ships were to be armed with a main battery of eight guns and had a top speed of , much faster than any contemporary design. The &quot;Francesco Caracciolo&quot; class was ordered in 1914; the lead ship was laid down that year, and the other three vessels were laid down in 1915. After Italy entered World War I in May 1915, work slowed dramatically, as resources were diverted to more pressing needs. Work on the ships stopped completely by March 1916, and the three ships begun in 1915 were scrapped shortly after the end of the war. In 1919, the Italian Navy considered completing &quot;Francesco Caracciolo&quot; as an aircraft carrier similar to the British or as a floatplane carrier, but both proposals were too expensive for the cash-strapped navy. Ultimately, she was broken up for scrap in 1926.

===&quot;Littorio&quot; class===

The final group of Italian battleships was the &quot;Littorio&quot; class. These ships, which weighed in excess of standard displacement, violated the naval arms limitation system created by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The ships were armed with a battery of nine 15-inch guns in three triple turrets, and they incorporated a novel underwater protection system designed by Umberto Pugliese. &quot;Littorio&quot; and &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; were laid down in 1934 and completed in early 1940; a second pair, &quot;Roma&quot; and &quot;Impero&quot;, were laid down in 1938. &quot;Roma&quot; was finished in mid-1942, while &quot;Impero&quot; was not completed.

The first two ships entered service in August 1940, shortly after Italy joined World War II. &quot;Littorio&quot; was badly damaged in the November 1940 raid on Taranto, and repairs lasted until March 1941. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was undamaged, and later that month took part in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. In March 1941, she was damaged by British torpedo bombers after the inconclusive Battle of Cape Matapan. Both ships were back in action for the First and Second Battle of Sirte in January and March 1942, respectively. By the end of the year, &quot;Roma&quot; was ready for service and replaced &quot;Littorio&quot; as the fleet flagship. After Benito Mussolini fell from power in July 1943, &quot;Littorio&quot; was renamed &quot;Italia&quot;. During the Italian surrender in September 1943, &quot;Roma&quot; was hit by a pair of Fritz-X guided glide bombs; her ammunition magazines blew up in a tremendous explosion and she quickly sank. &quot;Italia&quot; was hit by one Fritz-X and was badly damaged. The United States and Britain received &quot;Italia&quot; and &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;, respectively, in the peace treaty; both ships were scrapped in the late 1940s, as was the incomplete &quot;Impero&quot;.

<doc id="892617" wikidata="Q1983993" url="?curid=892617" title="Nez Perce National Historical Park">
<text>The Nez Perce National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park comprising 38 sites located across the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington, which include traditional aboriginal lands of the Nez Perce people. The sites are strongly associated with the resistance of Chief Joseph and his band, who in June 1877 migrated from Oregon in an attempt to reach freedom in Canada and avoid being forced on to a reservation. They were pursued by U.S. Army cavalry forces and fought numerous skirmishes against them during the so-called Nez Perce War, which eventually ended with Chief Joseph&#x27;s surrender in the Montana Territory.

Nez Perce National Historical Park was established in 1965, and a museum was opened at the park headquarters in Spalding, Idaho, in 1983. The 38 discontiguous sites span three main ecoregions, covering a wide range of elevations and climate. Numerous animal species inhabit the park areas, including several that are considered sensitive.

==History==
The park commemorates the history, culture, and stories of the Nez Perce. It includes sites associated with the Nez Perce War of 1877, when the people resisted takeover by the United States, and the flight of Chief Joseph and his band. The park is administered overall by the National Park Service, and a number of the sites are managed by other federal and state agencies as well as local communities; the park&#x27;s headquarters are located in Spalding, Idaho, east of Lewiston.

The park was established by Congress in 1965. Construction of the planned headquarters site and museum at Spalding were delayed by land acquisition and federal funding Soon after construction began in September 1979, Native American graves were discovered at the site. Remains and artifacts were preserved in consultation with the Nez Perce. Construction of the visitor center and museum was later restarted. The museum opened 

==Sites==
The Nez Perce National Historic Park does not follow the format of most national parks, in that it is composed of dozens of sites spread over four states. The 38 sites are linked by the history of the Nez Perce people, rather than by geographic location. Twenty-six of the sites are on or near the Nez Perce Indian Reservation in Idaho and can be toured in one day. Adjacent states hold the other twelve sites.

Several of the sites are connected by the Nez Perce National Historic Trail, managed by the United States Forest Service. It preserves the route taken by Chief Joseph and his band when they tried to reach Canada in 1877.

The sites include:
* Battle of Bear Paw – Blaine County, Montana
* Battle of the Clearwater – Idaho County, Idaho
* Battle of White Bird Canyon – Idaho County, Idaho
* Big Hole National Battlefield – Beaverhead County, Montana
* Camas Meadows Battle Sites – Clark County, Idaho
* Camas Prairie – Idaho County and Lewis County, Idaho 
* Camp Chopunnish – Idaho County, Idaho
* Joseph Canyon – Wallowa County, Oregon and Asotin County, Washington
* Old Chief Joseph Gravesite – Wallowa County, Oregon
* Weippe Prairie – Weippe, Idaho

==Ecology==
The NPNHP sites cover three main ecoregions. The first, found at the sites in the Palouse grasslands and Missouri Basin, is shortgrass prairie. These flat or slightly rolling prairies include rivers and streams, and have an altitude of about . The second, found in the plateaus of the Columbia and Snake rivers, is sagebrush steppe at around 3,000 ft in altitude; it includes lava fields and flows. The third, found in the sites in the Blue Mountains, Salmon River Mountains, southwestern Montana and northern Rocky Mountains, is conifer and alpine meadows. These high-elevation sites have lower temperatures and greater precipitation than the other ecoregions.

Numerous species of mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds and invertebrates inhabit the various park sites. Several of these species are classified in terms of their status as &quot;threatened,&quot; &quot;endangered&quot; or &quot;sensitive&quot; at the state level. Montana Arctic grayling, mountain plover, swift fox, great grey owl, boreal owl and several fish species are all sensitive species that inhabit the park, while gray wolf and bald eagles are sometimes seen. Managers of the park have several ecological concerns including issues of invasive plant species, the degradation of animal habitat due to human activity, the protection of endangered species, and dealing with effects of climate change.

<doc id="892618" wikidata="Q2261937" url="?curid=892618" title="Seaboard System Railroad">
<text>The Seaboard System Railroad, Inc. was a US Class I railroad that operated from 1982 to 1986.

Since the late 1960s, Seaboard Coast Line Industries had operated the Seaboard Coast Line and its sister railroads—notably the Louisville &amp; Nashville and Clinchfield—as the &quot;Family Lines System&quot;. In 1980, SCLI merged with the Chessie System to create the holding company CSX Corporation; two years later, CSX merged the Family Lines railroads to create the Seaboard System Railroad. 

In 1986, Seaboard renamed itself CSX Transportation, which absorbed the Chessie System&#x27;s two major railroads the following year.

==History==
The Seaboard System&#x27;s roots trace back to SCL Industries, a holding company created in 1968 that combined the Seaboard Coast Line&#x27;s subsidiary railroads into one entity. In 1969, SCL was renamed Seaboard Coast Line Industries, which was known as the Family Lines System from 1972-1982, to better compete with the Southern Railway System. This entity adopted its own logo and colors, but each railroad maintained its own identity. Over time, this caused confusion among customers. In comparison to the neighboring Chessie System, which had four railroads, the Family Lines had six railroads. In 1971 SCL bought out the remaining shares and made the Louisville &amp; Nashville a subsidiary.

On November 1, 1980, Seaboard Coast Line Industries and Chessie System merged under the holding company CSX Corporation. Over the following seven years, the Chessie and Seaboard&#x27;s various railroads were gradually merged into one. 

The first step came on December 29, 1982, when the Seaboard Coast Line and Louisville &amp; Nashville (under the Family Lines entity) were merged to form the Seaboard System Railroad, Inc.

Considered as a &quot;temporary railroad&quot;, the Seaboard System quickly began to merge the smaller railroads that were owned under the Family Lines System entity. This included the Georgia Railroad and the Clinchfield Railroad (1983), South Carolina Pacific Railway (April 30, 1984), Louisville, Henderson &amp; St. Louis Railway (July 1984), Gainesville Midland (1985), Atlanta &amp; West Point Railroad (June 1986) and the Columbia, Newberry &amp; Laurens (June 1986). These mergers simplified equipment and management alongside the Chessie System railroads (Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, Baltimore &amp; Ohio, Western Maryland). 

The Seaboard System renamed itself CSX Transportation on July 1, 1986. On April 30, 1987, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad was merged into the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio. Finally, on August 31, 1987, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio (still under the Chessie System entity for corporate reasons) was merged into CSX Transportation. All the major railroads under CSX Corporation were now one company. (The Western Railway of Alabama would remain an operating subsidiary until December 2002, when it was finally merged into CSX.)

==Equipment colors and painting==
After creation of the Family Lines name, SCLI begin painting locomotives in a standardized paint scheme. When the Seaboard System came into being, the new scheme retained the grey, red, and yellow colors were of the Family Lines scheme. The new Seaboard System also had a new logo featuring a coupled variation font of ITC Eras Demi. The first locomotive to be decorated with the new Seaboard System paint scheme was Uceta GP16 #4802 in October 1982. Because the merger did not occur until December, locomotives after October 1982 were to receive the Seaboard System paint scheme with the existing railroad&#x27;s reporting marks applied.

When the merger officially took effect on January 1, 1983, all former reporting marks were to be either removed or patched with SBD initials. Shortly before taking delivery of the L&amp;N specified EMD SD50&#x27;s, Seaboard adopted a Swis721 type font for reporting marks and numbers, instead of the customized Seaboard Coast Line lettering seen on pre-1983 repaints. To simplify its locomotive roster and meet Chessie System specifications, Seaboard introduced a numbering system that partially became meshed within the Chessie System locomotive fleet, and removed any existing Mars Lights or Gyralights from locomotives. Any new locomotives purchased by Seaboard would be built to meet Chessie specifications; of which only three, EMD SD50, EMD MP15T and GE B36-7, were ordered.

==Heritage Units==

In June 2023, GE ES44AH unit #1982 entered service, being repaired and repainted at CSX shops in Waycross, GA with a CSX blue and yellow color scheme on the front (nose) and cab of the locomotive and throughout the rest of the locomotive, the classic grey Seaboard System scheme. It was numbered #1982 in homage to the year the Seaboard System was created. A second heritage unit featuring The Family Lines System, a GE Evolution Series GE ES44AH unit #1972 entered service in March 2024.

<doc id="892620" wikidata="Q755123" url="?curid=892620" title="Phlegraean Fields">
<text>The Phlegraean Fields (, ; ) is a large caldera volcano west of Naples, Italy. It is part of the Campanian volcanic arc, which includes Mount Vesuvius, about east of Naples. The Phlegraean Fields is monitored by the Vesuvius Observatory. It was declared a regional park in 2003.

The area of the caldera consists of 24 craters and volcanic edifices. Most of them lie under the Gulf of Naples. There are effusive gaseous manifestations in the Solfatara crater, which was believed in ancient Rome to be the home of Vulcan, the god of fire. The area features bradyseismic phenomena, which are most evident at the Macellum of Pozzuoli, misidentified by 18th-century excavators as a temple of Serapis: bands of boreholes left by marine molluscs on marble columns show that the level of the site in relation to sea level has varied. Hydrothermal activity can still be observed at Lucrino, Agnano and the town of Pozzuoli.

At present, the Phlegraean Fields area comprises the Naples districts of Agnano and Fuorigrotta, the area of Pozzuoli, Bacoli, Monte di Procida, Quarto, the Phlegraean Islands, Ischia, Procida and Vivara.

The Solfatara crater was accessible on foot until 2017 and contains many steam-emitting fumaroles and over 150 pools, at the last count, of boiling mud. Several subsidiary cones and tuff craters, one filled by Lake Avernus, lie within the caldera.

==Geochemistry==
The magma underlying the Phlegraean Fields produces lavas of varying composition but generally rich in potassium. Trachyte is the most common eruptive product, unusually alkali-rich in some cases. Peralkaline phonolitic trachyte and latite have also been produced, and there is rare trachybasalt.

== Geological phases ==
Three geological phases or periods are recognised and distinguished.

* First Phlegraean Period. It is thought that the eruption of the Archiflegreo volcano occurred about 39,280 ± 110 years (older estimate ~37,000 years) ago, erupting about of magma ( bulk volume) to produce the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption. Its volcanic explosivity index (VEI) was 7 and it left a large part of eastern Europe covered in ash. 

: It is believed that the resulting ecological crisis wiped out both the last Neanderthal and the first Homo Sapiens populations of the early Upper Paleolithic. Modern humans then repopulated Europe from the east after the eruption and the ice age that took place from 38,000 to 36,000 BC.

: The Phlegrean area is characterised by banks of piperno and pipernoid grey tuff at Camaldoli hill, as in the northern and western ridge of Mount Cumae; other referable deep products are those found at Monte di Procida, recognizable in the cliffs of its coast.

* Second Phlegraean Period, between 35,000 and 10,500 years ago. This is characterized by the Neapolitan yellow tuff that is the remains of an immense underwater volcano, with a diameter of ; Pozzuoli is at its centre. Approximately 12,000 years ago the last major eruption occurred, forming a smaller caldera inside the main caldera, with its centre where the town of Pozzuoli lies today.
* Third Phlegraean Period, between 8,000 and 500 years ago. This is characterized by white pozzolana, the material that forms the majority of volcanos in the Fields. Broadly speaking, it can be said there was initial activity to the southwest in the zone of Bacoli and Baiae (10,000–8,000 years ago); intermediate activity in an area centred between Pozzuoli, [Cleft Mountain] and Agnano (8,000–3,900 years ago); and more recent activity towards the west, which formed Lake Avernus and Monte Nuovo (New Mountain) (3,800–500 years ago).

Volcanic deposits indicative of eruption have been dated by argon at  315,000, 205,000, 157,000 and 18,000  years ago.

=== More recent history ===

In 1538, an eight-day eruption in the area deposited enough material to create a new hill, Monte Nuovo. It has risen about from ground level since 1970.

The volcanic island of Ischia suffered three destructive earthquakes in 1828, 1881, and the most destructive one in 1883, with a magnitude of 4.2–5.2 and causing catastrophic shaking assigned XI (&quot;Extreme&quot;) on the MCS scale. Extreme damage was reported on the island, and over 2,000 residents perished.

A 2009 journal article stated that deformation of the caldera centre near Pozzuoli might presage an eruptive event within decades. In 2012 the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program planned to drill below the earth&#x27;s surface near Pompeii, in order to monitor the massive molten rock chamber below and provide early warning of any eruption. Local scientists were worried that drilling could precipitate an eruption or earthquake; programme scientists said it was no different from industrial drilling in the area. The drilling was halted in 2010, but later resumed. A Reuters article emphasized that the area could produce a &quot;super volcano&quot; that might kill millions.

A study from the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia reported that the volcanic unrest of the Campi Flegrei caldera from January 2012 to June 2013 was characterised by rapid ground uplift of about , with a peak rate of about per month during December 2012. It added that from 1985 to 2011 the dynamics of ground uplift were mostly linked to the caldera&#x27;s hydrothermal system, and that this relation broke down in 2012. The driving mechanism of the ground uplift changed to periodical emplacement of magma within a flat sill-shaped magmatic reservoir about in depth, south from the port of Pozzuoli.

In December 2016, activity became so high that an eruption was feared. In May 2017, a study by University College London and the Vesuvius Observatory published in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; concluded that an eruption might be closer than previously thought. The study found that the geographical unrest since the 1950s has a cumulative effect, causing a build-up of energy in the crust and making the volcano more susceptible to eruption.

On 21 August 2017 there was a magnitude 4 earthquake on the western edge of the Campi Flegrei area. Two people were killed and many more people injured in Casamicciola on the northern coast of the island of Ischia, which is south of the epicentre.

=== Activity since 2020 ===

The reason for the seismicity and bulging ground is not known . According to one model, called the &quot;shallow magma model&quot; in a &quot;Scientific American&quot; article, magma is pushing to break through the surface, making an explosive eruption with magma flow likely. In what has been termed the hot fluids model, steam and hot gases generated deeper underground are the cause. In this case activity could stop abruptly, or lead to a phreatic eruption of hot liquids, gases and rock fragments, rather than lava. While very dangerous, it is less so than a magma eruption. An answer to this question would help to estimate how likely this volcano, and other large volcanoes and supervolcanoes, are to erupt, and what warning signs to look out for.

A February 2020 status report indicated that earth uplift around Pozzuoli continued at steady rates, with a maximum average of 0.7 cm per month since July 2017. Gas emissions and fumarole temperatures did not change significantly. In May 2024 the ground was reported to be rising by 2 cm per month, with the rate increasing.

On April 26, 2020, a moderate earthquake swarm hit Campi Flegrei caldera, with about 34 earthquakes ranging between magnitude 0 and magnitude 3.1 centred around the port city of Pozzuoli. The strongest quake in the sequence was of magnitude 3.1, the strongest at the time since the last major period of unrest and rapid uplift in 1982-1984. However, no new fumaroles were reported.

Volcanic activity was reported in January 2022 to be increasing. In the year to September 2023, seismic activity had intensified, particularly in the later months. On 27 September 2023, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake—the strongest in 40 years—prompted the preparation of contingency plans to evacuate up to 360,000 people in the area. Despite a further 4.0 quake on 2 October, most volcanologists consider that a major eruption is not expected imminently. 

The best-case scenario was deemed to be the activity ending, as happened after much activity on the 1980s. The worst would be an eruption like the one of 1538. A study by Italy&#x27;s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) and University College London (UCL) in June 2023 concluded that the volcano was edging towards &quot;breaking point&quot; and in an &quot;extremely dangerous state&quot;. Nello Musumeci, Italian minister for civil protection, was to ask Neapolitan local officials for an &quot;acceleration in the drafting of exodus plans in the event of an emergency&quot;; he said that evacuation would only be carried out in the event of &quot;extreme necessity&quot;. Mass evacuation plans were to be tested at the end of May 2024.

Intense seismic activity continues in 2024. On 20 May 2024, seismic activity intensified, with a swarm of 150 earthquakes in a few hours, one of magnitude 4.4 causing fear among the population of Pozzuoli and some cracks and minor damage to buildings. Schools and a prison were evacuated.
A new seismic swarm has been ongoing since mid-February 2025 with shocks of maximum magnitude of 3.9.

===Geoheritage designation===
In respect of its 18th and 19th century role in the development of geoscience, not least volcanology, this locality was included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022.

==Wine==
Italian wine, both red and white, under the Campi Flegrei DOC appellation comes from this area. Grapes destined for DOC production must be harvested up to a maximum yield of 12 tonnes/hectare for red grape varieties, and 13 t/ha for white grape varieties. The finished wines need to be fermented to a minimum alcohol level of 11.5% for reds and 10.5% for whites. While most Campi Flegrei wines are blends, varietal wines can be made from individual varieties, provided the variety used comprises at least 90% of the blend and the wine is fermented to at least 12% alcohol for reds and 11% for whites.

Red Campi Flegrei is a blend of 50–70% Piedirosso, 10–30% Aglianico and/or Sciascinoso and up to 10% of other local (both red and white) grape varieties. The whites are composed of 50–70% Falanghina, 10–30% Biancolella and/or Coda di Volpe, with up to 30% of other local white grape varieties.

==Cultural importance==
Campi Flegrei has had strategic and cultural importance.
*The area was the site of quarries for piperno stone, an ignimbrite (welded tuff), a stone that was used to build much of Naples; piperno &quot;is probably the most important building stone of Naples, used over a time-span from at least the Roman age until the beginning of the 20th century.&quot; Piperno stone was used in the construction of Pompeii, along with other stone including Naples yellow tuff, foamy basalt, and limestone.
*The area was known to the ancient Greeks, who had a colony nearby at Cumae, the seat of the Cumaean Sibyl.
*The beach of Miliscola, in Bacoli, was the Roman military academy headquarters.
*Lake Avernus was believed to be an entrance to the underworld, and is portrayed as such in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil. During the civil war between Octavian and Antony, Agrippa tried to turn the lake into a military port, the Portus Julius.
*Baiae, now partially submerged, was a fashionable coastal resort and was the site of summer villas of Julius Caesar, Nero, and Hadrian (who died there).
*In Pozzuoli is the Flavian Amphitheatre, the third-largest Italian amphitheatre after the Colosseum and the Capuan Amphitheatre.
*The Via Appia passed through the &quot;comune&quot; of Quarto, entirely built on an extinguished crater.
*The Cave of Dogs, a famous tourist attraction during the early modern period, is on the eastern side of the Fields.
*Europe&#x27;s youngest mountain, Monte Nuovo, is here. A WWF oasis lies beside the enormous Astroni crater.
*The tombs of Agrippina the Elder and Scipio Africanus are here.
*At Baiae, now in the of Bacoli, the most ancient hot spring complex was built for the richest Romans. It included the largest ancient dome in the world before the construction of the Roman Pantheon.
*Astronomical broadcaster and writer Patrick Moore used to cite these Fields as an example of why the impact craters on the Moon must be of volcanic origin, which was thought to be the case until the 1960s.
*There is a theory that the Campanian Ignimbrite super-eruption around about 39,280 ± 110 years ago contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthals, based on evidence from Mezmaiskaya cave in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia.

<text>Ruś Szlachtowska (&quot;Shlakhtov Ruthenia&quot;) was a name introduced in 1930s by Prof. Roman Reinfuss to denote the region surrounding the villages of Biała and Czarna Woda, Jaworki, and Szlachtowa in the Grajcarek valley in the Pieniny mountains, in the Nowy Targ County of southern Poland.

The region was the westernmost area inhabited by Lemkos. It was separated from the rest of the Lemko Region by the Polish-dominated Poprad valley which led to isolation of the local population and its gradual assimilation with Poles and Slovaks, until Operation Vistula in 1947, when the Lemkos were deported together with the Ukrainians and Boykos to other areas of Poland and to the Soviet Union. Since then, the villages of Jaworki and Szlachtowa were gradually settled by Polish population from Podhale and Spisz, and the remaining two villages do not exist today.

It is not known for certain when the first settlers arrived in the valley, but it was probably not before the 15th century because Jan Długosz states nothing about the settlement in his Liber beneficiorum.

<text>Sociology of disaster or sociological disaster research is a sub-field of sociology that explores the social relations amongst both natural and human-made disasters. Its scope includes local, national, and global disasters - highlighting these as distinct events that are connected by people through created displacement, trauma, and loss. These connections, whether that is as a survivor, working in disaster management, or as a perpetrator role, is non-discrete and a complex experience that is sought to be understood through this sub-field. Interdisciplinary in nature, the field is closely linked with environmental sociology and sociocultural anthropology.

== Overview ==
Many studies in the field of sociology of disaster focus on the link between social solidarity and the vulnerabilities exposed by disasters. Scholarship in this field has observed how such events can produce both social solidarity and social conflict, and more importantly, expose inequalities inherent in the social order by exponentially exacerbating its effects. Studies investigating the emotional impact of disaster state that the emotional responses in these contexts are inherently adaptive. These emotions, when reflected on and processed, lead to post traumatic growth, resilience, increased altruism, and engagement with community.

Early disaster research established the mainstream parameters of what it is to do such research - i.e. a focus on solidarity arising in the aftermath of disasters and that disasters are a consequence of human maladaptation to the hazardous environment.

<doc id="892623" wikidata="Q262673" url="?curid=892623" title="Seaboard Coast Line Railroad">
<text>The Seaboard Coast Line Railroad was a Class I railroad company operating in the Southeastern United States beginning in 1967. Its passenger operations were taken over by Amtrak in 1971. Eventually, the railroad was merged with its affiliate lines to create the Seaboard System in 1983.

At the end of 1970, SCL operated 9,230 miles of railroad, not including A&amp;WP-Clinchfield-CN&amp;L-GM-Georgia-L&amp;N-Carrollton; that year it reported 31,293 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 512 million passenger-miles.

==History==
The Seaboard Coast Line emerged on July 1, 1967, following the merger of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. The combined system totaled , the eighth largest in the United States at the time. The railroad had $1.2 billion in assets and revenue with a 54% market share of rail service in the Southeast, facing competition primarily from the Southern. The seemingly redundant name resulted from the longstanding short-form names of these two major Southeastern railroads. For years, SAL had been popularly known as &quot;Seaboard,&quot; while ACL was known as &quot;the Coast Line.&quot;

Prior to the creation of Amtrak on May 1, 1971, the Seaboard Coast Line provided passenger service over much of its system, including local passenger trains on some lines. Local trains ended when the Amtrak era began. Although several named passenger trains survived through the Amtrak era, many were renamed or combined with other services.

The first expansion for the Seaboard Coast Line came in 1969 with the acquisition of the Piedmont and Northern Railway, which operated about in North and South Carolina. SCL would buy out the remaining shares and gain control of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&amp;N) in 1971, and also bought the Durham and Southern Railway from the Duke family in 1979. In 1978, SCL was approached by the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) and entered negotiations for a potential transcontinental merger, with the L&amp;N being used to connect the two railroads. In May of that year, then-SCL president Prime Osborn III personally called off the merger, but SCL still sold some of their stock to the SP.

On November 1, 1980, CSX Corporation was created as a holding company for the Family Lines and Chessie System Railroad. Effective January 1, 1983, the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad became Seaboard System Railroad after a merger with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and Clinchfield Railroad. For some years prior to this, the SCL and L&amp;N had been under the common ownership of a holding company, Seaboard Coast Line Industries (SCLI), the company&#x27;s railroad subsidiaries being collectively known as the Family Lines System which consisted of the L&amp;N, SCL, Clinchfield and West Point Routes. During this time, the railroads adopted the same paint schemes but continued to operate as separate railroads.

In 1983, CSX combined the Family Lines System units as the Seaboard System Railroad and later CSX Transportation when the former Chessie units merged with the Seaboard in December 1986.

==Notable SCL services==

===Passenger Trains===
====New York - Florida====
*Silver Meteor, inaugurated February 2, 1939
::Inherited from SAL. Initially an all-coach train (Pullman sleepers added in 1941), first streamliner to serve Florida, New York to Tampa/St. Petersburg and Miami. Trains continued beyond Tampa to Sarasota and Venice. Preserving its reputation as &quot;one of the finest [trains] in the country,&quot; the train retained its round-ended observation cars until Amtrak took over operation in 1971. Still in Amtrak service today with updated equipment. 
*Silver Star, inaugurated December 12, 1947
::Inherited from SAL. Streamliner, coach and Pullman cars, New York to Tampa/St. Petersburg and Miami. Still in Amtrak service, with updated equipment (temporarily suspended and merged with the Capitol Limited as the Floridian).
*Champion, December 1, 1939 - October 1, 1979
::Inherited from ACL. Streamliner, coach and Pullman cars, New York to Tampa/St. Petersburg and Miami. Initially continued by Amtrak, it was discontinued in 1979.

::Inherited from SAL. Coach and Pullman cars, New York – Tampa/Miami. Connections in Washington to New York and Boston. The route was cut back to Jacksonville, Florida as the southern terminus in February 1968, and later discontinued in December.

====Winter Only====
*Florida Special, Late 1800s - Spring 1972
::Inherited from ACL. Streamliner, coach and Pullman cars, New York to Tampa/St. Petersburg and Miami. Initially continued by Amtrak, it was discontinued after the 1971-1972 winter season.

====Miscellaneous==== 
*Silver Comet, May 18, 1947 – October 15, 1969
::Inherited from SAL. Streamliner, coach and Pullman cars, New York – Birmingham via Athens and Atlanta. The train was cut back to Washington – Atlanta only by January 1969, then to Richmond – Atlanta only by May, and finally discontinued October 15, 1969.
*Gulf Wind, July 31, 1949 – April 30, 1971
::Inherited from SAL. Coach and Pullman cars, Jacksonville – New Orleans via Tallahassee, Pensacola and Mobile. Handled jointly by SCL and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, with motive power changed at Chattahoochee. The train was not continued by Amtrak in 1971.
*Tidewater, November 1, 1953 – February 1968
::Inherited from SAL. Streamliner, coach and Pullman cars, Portsmouth, Virginia – Jacksonville, Florida, forwarding cars to the &quot;Silver Comet&quot; at Hamlet, North Carolina. Ferries would transport passengers between Norfolk and Portsmouth. Coach only by 1968.
*Palmetto, 1944 – 1968
::Inherited from ACL. All-coach, New York – Savannah. The name and route was later revived by Amtrak in 1976 and still operates today.

===Juice Train===

Juice Train is the popular name for famous unit trains of Tropicana fresh orange juice operated by railroads in the United States. On June 7, 1970, beginning on Seaboard Coast Line railroad, a mile-long Tropicana Juice Train began carrying one million gallons of juice with one weekly round-trip from Bradenton, Florida to Kearny, New Jersey, in the New York City area. The trip spanned one way, and the 60 car train was the equivalent of 250 trucks.

Today it is no longer operated by SCL successor CSX Transportation, a victim of CSX’s PSR operating philosophy. Tropicana refrigerated boxcars are still transported between Florida and New Jersey, however they are now mixed in with Intermodal trains. In the past, the Juice Trains have been the focus of efficiency studies and awards as examples of how modern rail transportation can compete successfully against trucking and other modes to carry perishable products.

==Motive power==

Immediately following the 1967 merger, the newly created SCL network had 1,232 locomotives. The vast majority of the ACL roster contained EMD (Electro-Motive Division of General Motors) locomotives in addition to some General Electric (GE) and Alco models as well as Baldwin switchers, while the SAL rostered mainly EMD and Alco diesels in addition to some GE models and Baldwin switchers. Both railroads had purchased new freight locomotives in the 5 years leading up to the merger. Among the first new locomotives purchased by the Seaboard Coast Line were 28 GE U33B locomotives, acquired in 1967 and 1968. These were followed by 108 GE U36B locomotives between 1970 and 1972. From EMD, SCL purchased SD45 locomotives in 1968, with more to follow in 1971. SD45-2 locomotives were added in 1974. GP40 and GP40-2 locomotives were added to the fleet between 1968 and 1972 for use on through freights and other high priority freight trains. All former SAL locomotives ran for many years in the &quot;Split-image&quot; scheme, still in full SAL paint, but relettered and renumbered SCL. Two GP-7&#x27;s 915 &amp; 981 went from pure SAL to SCL Black without being in split-image and GP-7 944 and RS-3 1156 were never painted black, and retained their SAL paint until retired in 1976. The last operating SCL locomotive in SAL paint was GP-40 1559, former SAL 644, and was repainted at Hamlet, NC in March 1976 according to records. There were former P&amp;N locomotives that retained their P&amp;N scheme from 1969 until 1977, only RS-3&#x27;s 1250 &amp; 1256 and S-4 230 ever were repainted SCL black.

Gainesville Midland SD-40, retained its SAL paint until 1986 when it was repainted Seaboard System 8300, it had been SBD 0010 and 8300 in SAL style &quot;split-image&quot; for several years prior to that.

SCL supplemented its local freight units with orders of GE U18B and EMD GP38-2 locomotives. Some U18B models contained a shorter, and therefore lighter, fuel tank which proved ideal for light density lines. Most units of this type were assigned to the Carolinas. However, in 1978 the SCL decided not to purchase any more locomotives for local service on secondary mainlines and branchlines, instead aging GP7, GP9, and GP18 locomotives would be rebuilt into GP16 models at the Uceta shops.

In the years leading up to the creation of the Seaboard System in 1983, SCL began acquiring the next generation of locomotives from EMD and GE. These orders included GE B23-7 locomotives in 1978 and 1980, including the GE BQ23-7 variant, of which only 10 were built and all belonged to SCL. EMD GP38-2 units were added in 1979 and 1980, and 5 EMD GP40-2 locomotives also delivered in 1980. Six axle GE C30-7 and EMD SD40-2 units were added to the roster between 1979 and 1980.

<doc id="892630" wikidata="Q2632560" url="?curid=892630" title="Policenauts">
<text>is a graphic adventure game developed and published by Konami. It was written and directed by Hideo Kojima, and originally released for the PC-9821 in 1994. A hard science fiction story, &quot;Policenauts&quot; is set in the mid 21st century and follows Jonathan Ingram, an astronaut recently recovered floating in space in cryosleep after an accident at a space colony sent him drifting into space for 24 years. Now a detective in Los Angeles, Ingram travels back to the colony to investigate the murder of his ex-wife and her husband&#x27;s disappearance. As he begins his investigation, he starts to uncover an illegal organ trafficking ring.

Kojima conceived &quot;Policenauts&quot; while working on &quot;Snatcher&quot; (1988), and began development in 1990. He wanted the production quality to match that of major motion pictures, and created a scripting engine to give him more creative control. Drawing creative influences from American buddy television shows, contemporary social debates on anti-Japanese sentiment and organ transplantation, and Japan&#x27;s heightened interest in space travel following the first Japanese man&#x27;s trip to space in 1990, he sought to explore the concept of how living in space may affect human society and life, socially and physiologically. The original PC-9821 release used pixel art, while the 3DO, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn ports featured cel animation by Anime International Company.

An English localization was planned for the Saturn but was eventually cancelled, with Kojima citing technical problems with the translation. After interest in Kojima&#x27;s work grew following the release of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; (1998), demand for a translation built until a fan translation of the PlayStation version was released in 2009. Critics have praised &quot;Policenauts&quot; for its animation, voice acting, and overall presentation; several commentators have analysed its cinematic influences from films in the science fiction, action, comedy, and buddy-cop genres, while others noted its reflection of Kojima&#x27;s fascination with science and technology, and have praised its storyline, technical writing and worldbuilding.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Policenauts&quot; is a graphic adventure game with a point-and-click interface. It has also been called a visual novel and an interactive movie. The player moves a cursor freely across the screen to click on objects to examine them. During conversations, the player is given dialogue options to choose from. Once the right object in the scene has been examined or the dialogue options have been exhausted, the game progresses to the next scene in the story. In versions with cel animation, these scenes the player must examine are stills from the animated cinematics, so the game moves seamlessly between them and cutscenes. There are occasional action scenes where the player must fire a gun at enemies in a first-person perspective. The Sega Saturn version supports a light gun for these segments.

==Plot==
In 2013, Los Angeles Police Department officer Jonathan Ingram (Hideyuki Tanaka) was one of five &quot;Policenauts&quot;, police officers who received astronaut training to protect Beyond Coast, humanity&#x27;s first functional self-supporting space colony. During the test of a new space suit, an accident causes Jonathan to drift into space, presumed dead by his colleagues. In reality, the cryogenic survival system in the suit preserved him, and he is found and revived 25 years later. During that time, Beyond Coast has become the principal development location for potential interstellar travel, and is protected by a dedicated police force dubbed the Beyond Coast Police Department (BCPD).

In 2040, Jonathan has become a private investigator on Earth in Old Los Angeles. He is visited by his former wife Lorraine (Chiyoko Kawashima), who remarried while he was presumed dead. Lorraine asks for Jonathan&#x27;s help in solving the disappearance of her husband, Kenzo Hojo; the only clues are a torn leaf, a set of capsules, and the word &quot;Plato&quot;. Jonathan is reluctant to take her case at first, but after Lorraine leaves his office, she is murdered by a man in a black motorcycle suit. After failing to catch the culprit, Jonathan decides to fulfill Lorraine&#x27;s final request and travels to Beyond, where he is reunited with his former LAPD partner, BCPD Vice Department chief Ed Brown (Shōzō Iizuka), who agrees to help Jonathan investigate the circumstances surrounding Hojo&#x27;s disappearance and Lorraine&#x27;s murder along with Vice Unit members Meryl Silverburgh (Kyoko Terase) and Dave Forrest (Bin Shimada).

During their investigation, Jonathan receives information from Karen (Kikuko Inoue), Lorraine&#x27;s daughter with Hojo, that Hojo was growing increasingly stressed working at Tokugawa Pharmaceuticals, which is helping research medical solutions to health problems caused by living in space. Jonathan and Ed also run into former Policenauts Gates Becker (Osamu Saka) and Joseph Tokugawa (Iemasa Kayumi), the latter of whom Jonathan suspects of being involved. They receive further leads from a former co-worker of Hojo&#x27;s; the informant is later killed and used to lure Jonathan and Ed into an unsuccessful booby trap. Hojo&#x27;s body is eventually found, and Jonathan is framed for the killings. Tokugawa and Becker are revealed to have both been responsible for Jonathan&#x27;s accident, and the prime movers behind an illegal drug and organ trafficking ring designed to counteract the negative side-effects of being in space for long periods of time.

Hojo became involved in the conspiracy to save Karen from her terminal bone cancer, but eventually tried to break away and was murdered. With help from Ed and Meryl, Jonathan storms the Tokugawa headquarters, killing Lorraine&#x27;s assassin and then confronts Becker. When apparently cornered, Jonathan tricks Becker into revealing the whole scheme through a live video feed, exposing the scandal to Beyond Coast. Ed saves Jonathan by killing Becker, while Meryl and the remaining police arrest Tokugawa. Jonathan donates his bone marrow to Karen upon learning that he is her biological father, and returns to Earth.

==Development==

&quot;Policenauts&quot; was developed by Konami and directed by Hideo Kojima. Kojima began to explore concepts for &quot;Policenauts&quot; during the development of &quot;Snatcher&quot; (1988) when memory limitation issues prompted them to take a break. He wanted the game to remain in the adventure genre, feeling it was the best method to express what he wanted with video games. He was also growing frustrated with game development and wanted more creative control. After the release of &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot; (1990), he developed a scripting engine so he could maintain control over when animations and music played instead of the programmers. Development on &quot;Policenauts&quot; began in earnest in 1990 and lasted four years.

Kojima wanted to explore a near future scenario that could realistically occur rather than outlandish science fiction. The game&#x27;s story was influenced by news that captured his interest at the time. One such influence was the public debate over organ transplantation and brain death injuries. Another influence was the rise in anti-Japanese sentiment caused by the American crime film &quot;Rising Sun&quot; (1993). Some Asian-Americans held protests, fearing the negative characterization of Japanese in the film would lead to hate crimes. Space travel was also an influence after Toyohiro Akiyama became the first Japanese person to travel to space in 1990. Concurrently, many NASA documents about space travel and its effects on the human body were being published in Japan for the first time and were hot topics among Kojima&#x27;s friends and family. Kojima was curious as to what effect living in space would have on the human body, relationships, and wondered what facets of humans would be exposed in space. He chose to explore these concepts in &quot;Policenauts&quot;. Kojima mixed his space interests with the aforementioned social issues to build the thematic basis of &quot;Policenauts&quot; and hoped the players would ponder these topics.
Earth was called &quot;Home&quot; in the game while the space colony was named &quot;Beyond&quot;, names chosen to reflect a parent-child relationship. &quot;Beyond&quot; also references the colony&#x27;s distance from Home and the 25 years protagonist Jonathan Ingram passed through during his cryosleep. Kojima hoped that these names would reflect the persistence of human society and relationships, even after extreme technological advances. The colony&#x27;s cylindrical shape was inspired by &quot;Gundam&quot;. &quot;Policenauts&quot; was originally titled &quot;Beyond&quot;, but Konami changed the name after they were unable to trademark it.

Kojima&#x27;s familiarity with film and television influenced the cinematography in &quot;Policenauts&quot;. Though not attempting to use video games as a vehicle for presenting movies, he wanted to fill what he perceived to be a lack of production quality in games. Kojima worked to take the excellence of acting, lighting, direction, and storytelling in filmmaking and match that quality in his games. He took inspiration from American buddy television shows he enjoyed growing up like &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;. The game was originally going to be marketed as a &quot;Cinematic Virtual Reality&quot;. Konami did a trademark search early in development that turned up empty, but by 1994, the &quot;Virtual Reality&quot; term had been trademarked so it was dropped.

== Release ==

&quot;Policenauts&quot; was first released for the PC-9821 on July 29, 1994. Kojima received a letter from a hearing-impaired player after release, upset that modern games like &quot;Policenauts&quot; with its CD-ROM technology were replacing game text with actual speech. Kojima originally omitted subtitles to evoke a cinematic feel, but he added them for following versions to satisfy the players. The first port was for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer and released on September 29, 1995. A short demo with a game glossary, artwork, and design documents was released on April 21, 1995, called the &quot;Pilot Disk&quot;. The 3DO version and subsequent console ports had a drop in display resolution, and used newly animated full motion video in contrast to the animated stills used in the PC version. The visuals were animated by Anime International Company using traditional cel animation techniques.

The next port was for the PlayStation, released on January 19, 1996. A bonus disc called &quot;Policenauts Private Collection&quot; was released concurrently which has most of the same content as the 3DO&#x27;s &quot;Pilot Disk&quot; bonuses plus storyboards and the game script, as well as select shooting segments from the main game. The full motion videos in this version run slower at 15 frames per second (FPS) compared to 24 on the 3DO. Some story details that suggested subplots were also removed. The PlayStation launched while Konami was still developing &quot;Policenauts&quot; for the PC-9821. Seeing the system&#x27;s potential, Kojima promised himself he would make a &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game for the system, though first he ported &quot;Policenauts&quot;. In contrast to computer games, Sony and other console manufacturers ran quality testing on games for their consoles to check for bugs and rate game content. When &quot;Policenauts&quot; was being evaluated, Shuhei Yoshida of Sony Computer Entertainment told Kojima they were discussing the extent of breast jiggling in the game. This version was re-issued on August 7, 2003, through Konami&#x27;s online store, and it was re-released digitally on PlayStation Store on May 14, 2008.

The final port was for the Sega Saturn, released on September 13, 1996. The version comes packaged in a slipcase containing the game case itself and a hardbound art book. It also includes some additional scenes and some modified story details, including the readdition of removed details in the PlayStation version. Kojima insisted that the Saturn port have increased video fidelity, retaining the 3DO&#x27;s original 24 FPS and not using Cinepak encoding. The port also includes light gun support, a concept Kojima had since the inception of a Saturn port. His hope was that players would feel more emotion using the gun in &quot;Policenauts&quot; than in games like &quot;Lethal Enforcers&quot; (1992) which he felt did not evoke empathy. The Saturn version also has some of the content featured in the &quot;Pilot Disk&quot; and &quot;Private Collection&quot; bonus discs released on previous consoles, such as some of the making-of videos and an interview with voice actress Kikuko Inoue (unlocked after completing the game once), as well as the glossary, which is now accessible during play, allowing players to look up keywords whenever they are first used in the story.

===Localization===
An official English translation of &quot;Policenauts&quot; was announced for release on the Sega Saturn in 1996 in North America. It appeared in catalogs with promotional box artwork, but the game never materialized. Kojima discussed making an English translation three times, but encountered translation difficulties. As he explained, the Japanese dialogue was parsed into phrases with flags the program could reference, and making English dialogue work with this system would be too difficult. According to Jeremy Blaustein, who worked in Konami&#x27;s international business department and led the translations of &quot;Snatcher&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; (1998), there were never plans to localize &quot;Policenauts&quot;. He personally felt it was one of Kojima&#x27;s weaker games, not enjoying the &quot;space cowboy&quot; theme and feeling it lacked the tension and humor of &quot;Snatcher&quot;. Industry journalists have speculated in hindsight that Konami may have passed on localization because of &quot;Snatcher&quot;&#x27;s commercial failure and &quot;Policenauts&quot;&#x27; long scenes and protracted dialogue during an era of heightened consumer interest in 3D action games.

After the successful release of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, fan interest grew in &quot;Snatcher&quot; and &quot;Policenauts&quot;. Around 2000, a petition on the Konami of America online message boards prompted the subsidiary to discuss localizing &quot;Policenauts&quot; with Konami of Japan. Their attempts were unsuccessful because Kojima did not want to work on older games. In response to the PS One re-release in 2003, fans organized an email campaign to pressure Konami to localize the game once again. Their attempt was publicized and supported by &quot;IGN&quot;.

Work on an English fan translation began in 2002. In February 2007, the team announced it was nearing completion with a planned release in the second half of the year. Other help was provided by YouTuber Slowbeef. The translation was finally released two years later in August 2009 as a patch for the PlayStation version. It can be played on an emulator, or a PlayStation modified to read CD-Rs by ripping the game files from retail discs, applying the English patch, and burning the patched game to CD-Rs. Because some fans consider the Sega Saturn version a superior port, fans released a translation patch for it in 2016.

==Reception==

In Japan, critics praised &quot;Policenauts&quot; for its high level of presentation. Both &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; and &quot;Famitsu&quot; praised the quality of animation, voice acting, and its engrossing setting. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; felt it was more like a movie than a game and praised its unique blend of genres, but found some of the text difficult to understand and warned that its heavy scientific writing may not be suitable for everyone. &quot;Famitsu&quot; described the narrative as &quot;hardboiled&quot;. Both publications recommended &quot;Policenauts&quot; to fans of adventure games and anime.

The game was also reviewed in contemporary Western publications despite its lack of localization. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; previewed the 3DO version and considered it a sequel to &quot;Snatcher&quot;. They felt the game had an interesting plot, &quot;bizarre and inventive&quot; characters, and appreciated the &quot;level of senseless violence and gratuitous rudity of graphics.&quot; &quot;GameFan&quot; reviewed the PlayStation and Saturn ports; they felt it pushed the genre of interactive movies better than previous games in the genre and praised the game&#x27;s intricate technical details, although they cautioned that its specificity may put off some players. They also praised its suspenseful storytelling, and felt it was worth players&#x27; time even though it emphasized text over action. They concluded that &quot;Policenauts&quot; was &quot;a masterful achievement, a near-future scenario so intricately detailed, well thought out and full of originality it puts Hollywood&#x27;s best attempts at sci-fi to shame.&quot; Konami was busy releasing many sports games at the time, so &quot;GameFan&quot; feared it would not be localized.

=== Retrospective ===
&quot;Policenauts&quot; has continued to receive praise for its writing and presentation in retrospective reviews. Critics highlighted Kojima&#x27;s cinematic influences from science fiction films, buddy cop films, and other Eastern and Western films: in particular, the character designs drew comparisons to &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (1987). Mark Ryan Sallee of &quot;IGN&quot; called the game a manifestation of Kojima&#x27;s film obsessions, and accomplished in its &quot;unique direction and striking moods&quot; thanks to the strength of its animation and vocal performances. Comparing the game&#x27;s production values to anime of the mid-1990s, Bob Mackey of &quot;1Up.com&quot; liked how the game transitioned seamlessly between cutscene and gameplay, and preferred this style of presentation to games with high-quality cinematics that do not complement the gameplay. N. Ho Sang and Peter Tieryas of &quot;Kotaku&quot; wrote that &quot;Its flashes of &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;-esque intrigue give way to the deep metaphysical meanderings that makes for the usual Kojima mind meld on top of fantastic production values and mesmerizing art.&quot;

Kojima&#x27;s fascination with space and future technology was noted in several reviews, and the elaborate detail placed into describing hypothetical technologies and commonplace items was frequently singled out for praise. Critics also felt the game&#x27;s scientific terminology and dark themes were well-translated by fans into English. Regarding the game&#x27;s story, Sallee wrote that the &quot;somber dialogue&quot; progressed it in a unique way. Kurt Kalata of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; criticized the story as predictable, and described it as &quot;empty, merely a buddy cop film with some sci-fi elements&quot;. Parkin found that despite ostensibly being a detective story, the game&#x27;s narrative was thematically concerned with middle age, and was fascinated by the game&#x27;s focus on middle-aged characters as opposed to adolescents in most other games. Sam Bishop of &quot;IGN&quot; also praised the game&#x27;s strong characterization.

The game did receive some criticism. Some felt its moments of sexual humor – notably the option for Jonathan to grope the breasts of many of the game&#x27;s female characters ― conflicted with its otherwise serious tone; Mackey explained that this was a remnant of the game&#x27;s original release on Japanese computers during a time when the market was flooded with hentai games. Concerning criticisms of its slow pace, Mackey wrote that the game requires patience, while Kalata criticized the lack of a dialogue skip option. Parkin wrote that its format is outdated and not for everyone, but still called it &quot;a triumph of gentle interactive storytelling&quot;, and felt it could be enjoyed by those with interests in &quot;thrillers, point and click adventures, science fiction homage and Japanese esoterica&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Policenauts&quot; was not well known in the West until the fan translation was released in 2009. Critics have expressed interest in a re-release or sequel. Sam Bishop of &quot;IGN&quot; included it among a list of games he wanted to see receive a high-definition remaster. N. Ho Sang and Peter Tieryas of &quot;Kotaku&quot; included it on a list of desired sequels, and expressed interest in a proper English port of the original. Writing in 2013, Jon Leo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; wrote that he wanted to see the game re-released for the PlayStation 4, feeling it could be a good mainstream push for visual novels and adventure games. While still working with Konami in 2012, Kojima expressed interest in exploring a follow-up to &quot;Policenauts&quot;, but felt it was difficult to carry out from a business perspective. Bob Mackey of &quot;1UP.com&quot; criticized Konami for failing to acknowledge or pursue localization of &quot;Policenauts&quot; and other non-&quot;Metal Gear&quot; games by Kojima.

In retrospect, the game is often called a spiritual successor to &quot;Snatcher.&quot; Sang and Tieryas wrote that &quot;&quot;Snatcher&quot; was a masterpiece. &quot;Policenauts&quot; took it a step further.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; called them &quot;arguably two of the biggest cyberpunk/sci-fi games to ever grace consoles&quot;, and &quot;Eurogamer&quot; described &quot;Policenauts&quot;&#x27; sci-fi elements as &quot;some of the medium&#x27;s strongest.&quot; Both games are credited for establishing Kojima&#x27;s style that propelled him to excellence with his later games. Some of the &quot;Policenauts&quot; staff went on to hold lead development roles on Kojima&#x27;s later efforts, including the &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series. The character Meryl Silverburgh and the Tokugawa Corporation in &quot;Policenauts&quot; were repurposed for the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series.

<doc id="892649" wikidata="Q2073966" url="?curid=892649" title="Louis Raemaekers">
<text>Louis Raemaekers (April 6, 1869 – July 26, 1956) was a Dutch painter, caricaturist and editorial cartoonist for the Amsterdam newspaper &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; during World War I, noted for his anti-German stance.

==Early life==
He was born and grew up in Roermond, Netherlands during a period of political and social unrest in the city, which at that time formed the battleground between Catholic clericalism and liberalism. Louis’ father published a weekly journal called &quot;De Volksvriend&quot; (Friend of the People) and was an influential man in liberal circles. His battle against the establishment set the tone for his son&#x27;s standpoint several decades later, when he fought against the occupation of neutral Belgium at the start of the First World War. His mother was of German descent. He was trained – and later working – as a drawing teacher and made landscapes and children&#x27;s books covers and illustrations in his free time. In 1906 his life took a decisive turn when he accepted the invitation to draw political cartoons for leading Dutch newspapers, first from 1906 to 1909 for the &quot;Algemeen Handelsblad&quot; and from 1909 onwards for &quot;De Telegraaf&quot;.

==First World War==
Immediately after the Germans invaded Belgium, Louis Raemaekers became one of their fiercest critics. His message was clear: the Netherlands had to take sides for the Allies and abandon its neutral stance. His graphic cartoons depicted the rule of the German military in Belgium, portrayed the Germans as barbarians and Kaiser Wilhelm II as an ally of Satan. His work was confiscated on several occasions by the Dutch government and he was criticized by many for endangering the Dutch neutrality. The minister of Foreign Affairs John Loudon invited Raemaekers, the owner of &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; H.M.C. Holdert and the editor-in-chief Kick Schröder under pressure from the German government to a meeting, at which he requested them to avoid ‘anything that tends towards insulting the German Kaiser and the German army’. It was not possible to prosecute Raemaekers for as long as the country was not under martial law.
But the pressure on him continued, also from Germany: in September 1915 the rumor even started circulating that the German government had offered a reward of 12,000 guilders for Raemaekers, dead or alive, but proof of an official statement has never been found.

Louis Raemaekers achieved his greatest successes outside his native country. He left for London in November 1915, where his work was exhibited in the Fine Art Society on Bond Street. It was received with much acclaim. Raemaekers became an instant celebrity and his drawings were the talk of the town: ‘they formed the subject of pulpit addresses, and during two months, the galleries where they have been exhibited have been thronged to excess. Practically every cartoon has been purchased at considerable prices.’ He decided to settle in England and his family followed in early 1916. His leaving the Netherlands for London was a godsend for all concerned. Henceforth, the Dutch government could distance itself from the cartoonist and his work in its diplomatic relations, thus stabilising its position vis-à-vis Germany, while Raemaekers himself could cease his hopeless campaign to get the Netherlands to abandon its neutral stance. He may also have realised for himself that his aim of persuading his country to take up arms and thus avoid the fate of Belgium was not very realistic. From early 1915 Raemaekers&#x27; cartoons had already appeared in British newspapers and magazines. In early 1916 he signed a contract with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and they appeared in this newspaper on a regular basis for the next two years.
==War propaganda==
The most important aspect of Raemaekers’ career is undoubtedly his role in Allied war propaganda. Soon after his arrival in London he was contacted by Britain&#x27;s War Propaganda Bureau Wellington House namely to ensure the mass distribution of his work both in England and elsewhere in support of Allied propaganda. Forty of his most captive cartoons were published in &quot;Raemaekers Cartoons&quot;, which was immediately translated in eighteen languages and distributed worldwide in neutral countries. This was the beginning of a new phase in his life, one which brought him world renown. Among the Allies and in neutral countries, it was specifically Raemaekers&#x27; alleged neutral status that gave him credibility. This was most effusively expressed by his good friend Harry Perry Robinson, a not totally unbiased journalist from &quot;The Times&quot; in Raemaekers&#x27; album &quot;The Great War: a Neutral’s Indictment&quot; (1916): ‘Raemaekers’ testimony is a testimony of an eye-witness. He saw the pitiable stream of refugees which poured from desolated Belgium across the Dutch frontier; and he heard the tale of the abominations which they had suffered from their own lips. ... His message to the world, therefore, when he began to speak, had all the authority not only of a Neutral who was unbiased, but of a Neutral who knew.’

After the first exhibition in London, many others followed suit, first in the United Kingdom and France, soon afterwards in many countries over the world. Albums, pamphlets, posters, postcards and cigarette cards bearing reproductions of his work soon became also available. His drawings were even recreated as tableaux vivants. The total number of Raemaekers&#x27; cartoons distributed in this major propaganda effort increased quickly into the millions.

==United States==
From the summer of 1916 onwards efforts were made to distribute Raemaekers&#x27; work in the most powerful of the neutral countries, the United States. At the request of Wellington House Raemaekers visited the USA in 1917 to draw attention to his work. The United States had declared war on Germany shortly before, and the Allies hoped that his presence would sway public opinion to their cause. His tour was a triumph. Raemaekers gave lectures and interviews, drew caricatures for the movie cameras, was a popular guest at society functions, and met President Woodrow Wilson and former President Theodore Roosevelt. Soon after his arrival he signed – to everyone&#x27;s surprise – a contract with the International News Service, the syndicate of William Randolph Hearst. The Hearst newspapers were viewed as pro-German and had been cut off from all Allied news sources. But Raemaekers&#x27; own theory: &quot;this is the most important target group because the readers are poisoned daily by tendentious articles&quot; proved successful. Statistics show that by October 1917, more than two thousand American newspapers had published Raemaekers’ cartoons in hundreds of millions of copies. The popularisation of his work is regarded as the largest propaganda effort of the First World War.

==Between the wars==
Following the end of the First World War, Louis Raemaekers settled in Brussels. He was an advocate of the League of Nations and devoted many sketches and articles to the cause of unity in Europe. Meanwhile, he kept a close and suspicious eye on events in Germany. Interest in his work waned in Britain and France, where his war cartoons were still fresh in the public&#x27;s memory. People had had enough of his depictions of atrocities. A Dutch publisher rejected a collection of his illustrations because ‘the public is rather weary of war topics’. In 1927 he created a comic book about TBC named &quot;Gezondheid Is De Grootste Schat&quot;.
In the thirties, however, people began to think that Raemaekers might be right about Germany. He grew more productive, but the artistic and content-related quality of his work suffered proportionately. He remained loyal to &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; until well into the thirties, even after the paper&#x27;s management became pro-German. He took the same stance as during the First World War towards the Hearst Press: these readers were his most important target group.

==Second World War and last years==
Raemaekers fled to the United States shortly before the start of the Second World War and remained there until 1946, when he returned to Brussels. He had not been forgotten in the Netherlands, but it was only on his eightieth birthday, in 1949, that his native country gave him the recognition that he had long desired: he was made an honorary citizen of the City of Roermond. After an absence of almost forty years, Raemaekers returned to the Netherlands in 1953.

He died in Scheveningen near The Hague in 1956.

==Legacy==
In the summer of 1956, &quot;The Times&quot; published the obituary of a man who had enjoyed a worldwide reputation during the First World War: ‘Louis Raemaekers, the biting anti-German cartoonist of the 1914-18 War, died on July 26, 1956 at Scheveningen, near The Hague, at the age of 87. It has been said of Raemaekers that he was the one private individual who exercised a real and great influence on the course of the 1914-18 War. There were a dozen or so people – emperors, kings, statesmen, and commanders-in-chief – who obviously, and notoriously, shaped policies and guided events. Outside that circle of the great, Louis Raemaekers stands conspicuous as the one man who, without any assistance of title or office, indubitably swayed the destinies of peoples.’

<text>Dennis Webster DeConcini (; born May 8, 1937) is an American lawyer, philanthropist, politician and former U.S. senator from Arizona. The son of former Arizona Supreme Court judge Evo Anton DeConcini, he represented Arizona in the Senate as a Democrat from 1977 until 1995. After his re-election in 1988, no Arizona Democrats were elected to the Senate for 30 years until Kyrsten Sinema won his former seat in 2018.

==Early life and education==
DeConcini was born in Tucson, Arizona, the son of Ora (née Webster) and Evo Anton DeConcini.

His father was judge on the Arizona State Superior Court for 10 years, then served as the Arizona Attorney General for one two-year term from 1948 to 1949 before being appointed to the Arizona State Supreme Court, where he served as a judge for four years, from 1949 to 1953. DeConcini received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Arizona in 1959, and his LLB from the University of Arizona in 1963. He then worked as a lawyer for the Arizona Governor&#x27;s staff from 1965 to 1967. DeConcini attended The JAG School at the University of Virginia and entered U.S. Army JAG Corps.

Dennis DeConcini rejoined the law firm of DeConcini McDonald Yetwin and Lacy, which he and his father had co-founded in 1968, after leaving the Senate in 1995.

He is a member of the advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

==Career==
DeConcini served one elected term as Pima County, Arizona, Attorney (1973–1976), the chief prosecutor and civil attorney for the county and school districts within the county.

He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976 as a Democrat, defeated Republican representative Sam Steiger for the open seat left by retiring Republican senator Paul Fannin. DeConcini served three terms in the Senate.

In October 1991, he was one of eight Democrats who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court in a 52-48 vote.

===Panama Canal===
DeConcini sponsored an amendment (the DeConcini Reservation) to the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 which allows the United States &quot;to take such steps as each [the U.S. or Panama] deems necessary, in accordance with its constitutional processes, including the use of military force in the Republic of Panama, to reopen the Canal or restore the operations of the Canal, as the case may be.&quot;
The DeConcini amendment, which establishes the use of US military force in Panama, is written and signed by Omar Torrijos in the Instrument of Ratification, but it is alleged that it does not exist. &quot;The DeConcini amendment does not exist, and I maintained that and I continue to maintain it,&quot; is what Carlos López Guevara expressed.
In the same statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, mentioned above by former negotiator Carlos López Guevara, the De Concini Amendment is addressed, arguing that it &quot;was neutralized by the leadership amendment or Church amendment&quot;, contained in the Treaty of the Panama Canal.
López Guevara spoke about the book &quot;Panama Odyssey&quot; by former US ambassador, William Jorden. &quot;I am going to quote in English what the Senate, President Carter, Undersecretary of State Christopher Warren, Ambassador Jorden and the Panamanian team did, to explain why the Church amendment is the rebellion of a group of liberal senators against the DeConcini amendment,&quot; he said.
&quot;Why was the Church amendment made?&quot; López Guevara asked himself, before answering by quoting Jorden&#x27;s book: To disown (page 563), to undo (page 567) to neutralize (page 567). . 571) to balance (page 571), as content move (page 583), etc.
&quot;These are the arguments that a Panamanian patriot has to use to say that what the Senate did when approving the Church amendment was to eliminate the interventionist effects of the DeConcini amendment, because in this way, it was &quot;neutralized,&quot; said the lawyer.
Asked if the fact that the Church amendment is part of the Panama Canal Treaty, which ends next December, is a reason for it not to have effect on the Neutrality Treaty, which does not end on that date, and which has no termination date, López Guevara responded that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter because it is part of that negotiation.&quot;
&quot;INTERVENTIONIST&quot; PACT.

===Keating Five===
DeConcini was widely noted as a member of the Keating Five in a banking and political contribution ethics investigation during the 1980s which grew out of the U.S. Savings and Loan Crisis. The Senate investigation involved Charles Keating and Lincoln Savings/Continental Homes, the sixth largest employer in the state of Arizona at the time. The Senate Ethics Committee looked into the actions of five United States senators in relation to their actions connected with Charles Keating and concluded that Senators DeConcini, McCain, Glenn and Riegle &quot;broke no laws or Senate ethics rules, but were aggressive in their actions on behalf of Charles Keating.&quot; Specifically, DeConcini was judged to have &quot;acted improperly&quot; and did not run for a fourth term.

===Senate committees===

In the 101st Congress, DeConcini served on the Senate Appropriations Committee, chairing the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government. He also served on the Subcommittees on Defense, Energy and Water Development and Foreign Operations, and on the Senate Judiciary Committee, chairing the Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks. He served on the Subcommittees on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights, the Constitution and the Courts.

In 1993 and 1994, DeConcini chaired the Select Intelligence Committee.

===Appointments===
In February 1995 DeConcini was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the board of directors of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), where he served until May 1999.

In 2006, he and former Del E. Webb Construction Company President Anne Mariucci were selected by Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano to sit on the Arizona Board of Regents.

===Congressional papers===
DeConcini&#x27;s congressional papers are held at the University of Arizona Libraries, Special Collections.

==Business career==
DeConcini served on the board of directors of the Corrections Corporation of America (now known as CoreCivic) from 2008 to 2014. Starting in 2010, some individuals protested his membership on the board, saying his involvement is &quot;not suitable for a public figure like DeConcini.&quot; Although he claims he has not lobbied for harsher immigration laws and sentencing practices, he admits meetings with the Arizona Department of Corrections Director Chuck Ryan and &quot;publicly speaking in favor of&quot; for-profit prisons.

It was alleged that, in 1979, DeConcini had insider knowledge about the proposed route of the Central Arizona Project and that he used this knowledge to purchase land that he resold six years later to the federal government for a gain of almost $1,000,000.

==Philanthropy==

DeConcini is a member of the board of directors of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC), a global nonprofit organization that combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction.

<text>A vehicle bus is a specialized internal communications network that interconnects components inside a vehicle (e.g., automobile, bus, train, industrial or agricultural vehicle, ship, or aircraft). In electronics, a bus is simply a device that connects multiple electrical or electronic devices together. Special requirements for vehicle control such as assurance of message delivery, of non-conflicting messages, of minimum time of delivery, of low cost, and of EMF noise resilience, as well as redundant routing and other characteristics mandate the use of less common networking protocols. Protocols include Controller Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnect Network (LIN) and others. Conventional computer networking technologies (such as Ethernet and TCP/IP) are rarely used, except in aircraft, where implementations of the ARINC 664 such as the Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet are used. Aircraft that use Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) include the Boeing 787, the Airbus A400M and the Airbus A380. Trains commonly use Ethernet Consist Network (ECN). All cars sold in the United States since 1996 are required to have an On-Board Diagnostics connector, for access to the car&#x27;s electronic controllers.

== Background ==
The main driving forces for the development of vehicle network technology have been the advances made in the electronics industry in general and government regulations imposed, especially in the United States, in order to make the automobiles environmentally friendly.

With stringent emission standards for automobiles, it became impossible to attain the required degree of control without the help of on-board computing devices. On-board electronic devices have also contributed substantially to vehicle performance, occupant comfort, ease of manufacture and cost effectiveness.

At one time, a car radio was likely the only electronic device in an automobile, but now almost every component of the vehicle has some electronic feature. Typical electronic modules on today&#x27;s vehicles include the Engine Control Unit (ECU), the Transmission Control Unit (TCU), the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and body control modules (BCM).

An electronic control module typically gets its input from sensors (speed, temperature, pressure, etc.) that it uses in its computation. Various actuators are used to enforce the actions determined by the module (turn the cooling fan on, change gear, etc.). The modules need to exchange data among themselves during the normal operation of the vehicle. For example, the engine needs to tell the transmission what the engine speed is, and the transmission needs to tell other modules when a gear shift occurs. This need to exchange data quickly and reliably led to the development of the vehicle network, as the medium of data exchange.

The automotive industry quickly realized the complexity of wiring each module to every other module. Such a wiring design would not only be complex, it would have to be altered depending on which modules were included in the specific vehicle. For example, a car without the anti-lock brake module would have to be wired differently than one that included anti-lock brakes.

The industry&#x27;s answer to this problem was to create a central network in the vehicle. Modules could be &#x27;plugged&#x27; into the network and would be able to communicate with any other module that was installed on the network. This design was easier to manufacture, easier to maintain and provided the flexibility to add and remove options without affecting the entire vehicle&#x27;s wiring architecture. Each module, a node on the vehicle network, controls specific components related to its function and communicates with the other modules as necessary, using a standard protocol, over the vehicle network.

Networks were not new, but their application to the vehicle was. The networks for the vehicles called for:
*Low cost
*Immunity from external noise
*Ability to operate in harsh environments
*Overall robustness and reliability

Although the vehicle network made modest demands on data throughput, the demand for more on-board computing is continuing to drive changes to these networks to provide higher-speed communication between modules. The control area network include the receiver and transmitter for the host to controller transmission and interlinking between the computers

== Protocols, physical media and connectors ==

There are several network types and protocols used in vehicles by various manufactures. Many companies are encouraging a standard communication protocol, but one has not been settled on.

=== Protocols ===
Common vehicle buses protocols include:
* A²B - (Automotive Audio Bus) An audio distribution protocol developed by Analog Devices
* AFDX
* ARINC 429
*Byteflight
* CAN – (Controller Area Network) an inexpensive low-speed serial bus for interconnecting automotive components
*D2B – (Domestic Digital Bus) a high-speed multimedia interface
*FlexRay – a general purpose high-speed protocol with safety-critical features
*IDB-1394
*IEBus
*I²C
*ISO 9141-1/-2
*J1708 and J1587
*J1850
*J1939 and ISO 11783 – an adaptation of CAN for commercial (J1939) and agricultural (ISO 11783) vehicles
*Keyword Protocol 2000 (KWP2000) – a protocol for automotive diagnostic devices (runs either on a serial line or over CAN)
*LIN – (Local Interconnect Network) a very low cost in-vehicle sub-network
*MOST – (Media Oriented Systems Transport) a high-speed multimedia interface
*Multifunction Vehicle Bus – part of the Train Communication Network IEC 61375.
*SMARTwireX
*SPI
*VAN – (Vehicle Area Network)
*UAVCAN – (Uncomplicated Application-level Vehicular Communication And Networking) mostly used in electric aircraft, drones, satellites, and robotics.

=== Physical transmission media ===
Some examples of physical transmission media use in vehicle networks:
* Single wire
* Twisted Pair
* Fibre optic
* IEEE 1394
* MIL-STD-1553, developed for use in military avionics, it is now widely used in spacecraft too. Adopted for the MiG-35.
* MIL-STD-1773, roughly MIL-STD-1553 with optic cabling
* Power-line communication 

=== Connectors ===

*OBD-2 (16 pin)

Additionally, many major car manufacturers use their own proprietary vehicle bus standards, or overlay proprietary messages over open protocols such as CAN.

*J1939 (9 pin)

Commercial class vehicles have Type-I or Type-II connectors that support CAN based communication per the SAE J1939 protocol.

<text>The Eendracht is a former tidal branch of river Scheldt that has been channelised to form the northern stretch of the Scheldt-Rhine Canal. It flows from the Zoommeer lake (formerly part of the Oosterschelde) near Bergen op Zoom past the town and eponymous island of Tholen towards the former island of Sint Philipsland, where it used to end in the Krabbenkreek estuary. The passage to the estuary has been closed off, however, and an additional stretch of canal was dug to connect the Eendracht to the Krammer lake, itself a former estuary closed off from the sea during the Delta Works. The Eendracht is probably the last remaining remnant of the Striene river.

== Plot summary ==
Roger Shumway, a reporter, is invited to visit Craig Bennett Stiles, a 130-year-old man also known as the Time Traveler. This is the first interview Stiles has granted since after his return from the future, 100 years earlier. Stiles had claimed then that he invented a time machine (which he privately refers to as his &quot;Toynbee Convector&quot;, although he does not reveal the name of the device to anyone until much later). Stiles used the machine to travel forward in time about a hundred years from what was an economically and creatively stagnant society (c. 1984). On returning to that present, he showed evidence — films and other records collected on his journey — showing that humanity developed an advanced civilization with many marvelous and helpful inventions, and a restored natural environment. He also claimed to have then destroyed the machine deliberately to prevent anyone else doing the same.

Initially, people were skeptical of the Traveler&#x27;s claims, but they are unable to explain or disprove the authenticity of the records brought from the future. Inspired by the prospect of a utopian future, many people began projects to fulfill the vision and create the world the Traveler claims to have seen.

A hundred years later, the perfect world of Stiles&#x27; visions has come to pass, just as he saw in his time travel. Now 130 years old, Stiles recounts the story to Shumway. Stiles calmly reveals what really happened, simply stating, &quot;I lied.&quot; Since he knew the people of the world had it in them to create a utopia, he created the illusion of one, to give humanity a goal, and hope. Because of people&#x27;s belief in the illusion, the imagined utopian future became reality. After explaining his actions, Stiles presents Shumway with the evidence of his fraud on several recorded tapes and cassettes. Stiles then steps into a machine of his own creation, which he calls &quot;a real time machine&quot;. Turning the machine on, electricity pulses through it and Stiles&#x27; body, taking his life. Shumway is then left with the decision to either reveal Stiles&#x27; deception to the world or destroy the evidence, thus perpetuating Stiles&#x27; utopian tale. Turning the machine on once again, in order to destroy it, Shumway quietly drops the evidence into an incinerator set into the wall nearby and exits Stiles&#x27; home via a glass elevator.

==Adaptation/ Origin of Title==
Within the story, Stiles says that he chose the name &quot;Toynbee Convector&quot; for his machine, being inspired by &quot;a historian named Toynbee&quot;:
... that fine historian who said any group, any race, any world that did not run to seize the future and shape it was doomed to dust away to the grave, in the past.
This is a reference to Arnold J. Toynbee, who proposed that civilisation must respond to a challenge in order to flourish. This allusion is made more explicit in the television adaptation, written by Bradbury himself for &quot;The Ray Bradbury Theater&quot;. In this adaptation, first broadcast in 1990, Stiles refers to Toynbee by his full name and quotes directly from the author. The episode starred James Whitmore (as Stiles) and Michael Hurst (as Roger Shumway).

His film roles include the voice of Darth Maul in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), Pete in &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), Garthan Saal in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2014), the voice of Big Daddy in &quot;Sing&quot; (2016) and &quot;Sing 2&quot; (2021), and The Sommelier in &quot;John Wick: Chapter 2&quot; (2017).

On television, Serafinowicz created and starred in the comedy shows &quot;Look Around You&quot; (2002–2005) and &quot;The Peter Serafinowicz Show&quot; (2007–2008). He also voiced characters and worked as a creative consultant on &quot;South Park&quot; (2006–2015), portrayed Edgar Covington in &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2013–2015), voiced the Fisher King in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2015), and starred as the title character in the live-action adaptation series &quot;The Tick&quot; (2016).

He has also directed music videos for acts such as Hot Chip and went viral in 2016 for political satire videos in which he dubbed over videos of Donald Trump with a &quot;sassy&quot; voice, a Cockney accent, and a posh English accent.

==Early life==
Peter Szymon Serafinowicz was born into a Catholic family in Liverpool&#x27;s Gateacre suburb on 10 July 1972, the son of post office worker Catherine (née Geary) and scaffolder Szymon Serafinowicz Jr. His father was born and raised in Surrey to a Polish mother and Polish Belarusian father and later moved to Liverpool as an adult. Serafinowicz has a brother, James, a film producer, and a sister Helen, a writer who was married to Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan from 2004 to 2020.

At age three, Serafinowicz moved with his family to the Belle Vale district of Liverpool where he attended Our Lady of the Assumption Primary School. The family moved back to Gateacre when he was 14 and he attended St Francis Xavier&#x27;s College in neighbouring Woolton. He later said: &quot;I had a very happy childhood, but Belle Vale was very rough. I was only about three when we moved there, but I can still remember it looking very shiny, and it was all landscaped. But it was a very poor area, and it became scruffy quite quickly. [...] Gateacre is traditionally seen as one of the posh areas of Liverpool [but] it wasn&#x27;t really that much posher!&quot;

==Career==
Serafinowicz made his broadcasting debut in 1993 on Radio 1 show &quot;The Knowledge&quot;, a spoof documentary about the music industry. From there he went on to perform in Radio 4 shows &quot;Week Ending&quot;, &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Fruit Corner&quot;, &quot;Grievous Bodily Radio&quot;, &quot;The Two Dannys&quot;, and &quot;A Whole New Ball Game&quot;.

On 1 May 1997, he appeared in &quot;The Election Night Armistice&quot; as Moz Bingham, the fictional press secretary to the-then shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, who verbally abuses the BBC&#x27;s Nick Robinson in a spoof phone call over the politician&#x27;s news coverage. In 1998, he appeared on TV in &quot;Comedy Nation&quot; and &quot;You Are Here&quot;. He also had a role in the sitcom &quot;How Do You Want Me?, written&quot; by Simon Nye.

In 1999, he had several guest appearances in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot;, playing protagonist Tim Bisley&#x27;s (Simon Pegg) nemesis, Duane Benzie. He made another cameo appearance in the series when it returned in 2001.

In 2001, he took the lead in BBC Two sitcom &quot;World of Pub&quot;, playing the same character as he had in the show&#x27;s run on Radio 4. He also appeared in &quot;The Junkies&quot;, an internet sitcom. In 2002, he played a scientist in the critically acclaimed &quot;Look Around You&quot;, a series of 10-minute spoofs of 1970s school science programmes on BBC 2. He co-wrote the show with Robert Popper, whom he met on the set of &quot;Spaced&quot;. The show returned in 2005 as a spoof of the BBC TV show &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, with Serafinowicz playing Peter Packard, one of the presenters.

In 2003, he appeared in another sitcom written by Nye, &quot;Hardware&quot;, in which he played the affable Kenny. He reprised this role in the second series in 2004. Also in 2004 he appeared in British romantic zombie comedy &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, playing Pete, the uptight flatmate of principal characters Shaun and Ed. He appeared in boxing film &quot;The Calcium Kid&quot;.

In &quot;Sixty Six&quot;, the 2006 British film about a Jewish boy whose bar mitzvah is scheduled for the same day as the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, Serafinowicz plays Uncle Jimmy. In the week before the 2006 Academy Awards a video circulated on the Internet of a fake news item (called &quot;O! News&quot;, a parody of E! News) about a new Oscar statue, in which Serafinowicz imitated Alan Alda, Paul McCartney and Al Pacino.

A second &quot;O! News&quot; video later appeared, parodying the 2006 &quot;Apple Corps v Apple Computer&quot; lawsuit. This attracted the interest of the BBC, and a pilot was commissioned for &quot;The Peter Serafinowicz Show&quot;. A full series was broadcast on BBC Two in 2007 (with a Christmas special in 2008). For his performance, Serafinowicz was presented with the Best Entertainer prize at the 2008 Rose d&#x27;Or ceremony. The series was also nominated for Best Comedy Programme at the 2009 BAFTA Television Awards.

Serafinowicz made guest appearances on television, including the comedy shows &quot;Smack the Pony&quot; and &quot;Hippies&quot; (both 1999), &quot;Black Books&quot; (2000), &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; (2002) and &quot;Little Britain&quot; (2003), comedy-drama &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot; (1999), ITV drama series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; (2006) and &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2013).

His numerous guest appearances on panel shows for radio and television include regular appearances on &quot;The 99p Challenge,&quot; and on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in 2005, 2006 and 2008; &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot; in 2005, and &quot;QI&quot; in 2003. He also appeared on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; on 19 October 2007; &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; on 8 August 2008 and 30 July 2010 and &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; on 15 October 2009.

In 2008, Serafinowicz was working with Robert Popper on a new television series and website, based on a spoof religion &quot;Tarvuism&quot; for US network Adult Swim. In 2009, he appeared in Universal Films&#x27; &quot;Couples Retreat&quot; as Sctanley, the manager of the Eden Resort, directed by Peter Billingsley.

In 2010, Serafinowicz directed the music video for Hot Chip&#x27;s song &quot;I Feel Better&quot;, their second single from the album &quot;One Life Stand&quot;. He followed this up in 2012 when he directed the music video for the band&#x27;s song &quot;Night &amp; Day&quot;, the first single from their album &quot;In Our Heads&quot;.

On 28 July 2010, Popper and Serafinowicz added a new narration track to an episode of &quot;Out Of Town&quot; by Jack Hargreaves in order to create the spoof film &quot;Markets of Britain, a short film by Lee Titt&quot; 

In 2010, he co-starred with Will Arnett in the FOX sitcom &quot;Running Wilde&quot;, devised by &quot;Arrested Development&quot; creator Mitchell Hurwitz. It premiered on Fox on 21 September 2010, but was cancelled by the network after 13 episodes.

In June 2013, Serafinowicz provided the English language audiobook recording for the Roald Dahl novel &quot;Danny, the Champion of the World&quot;. In July 2013, he made his film directing debut with the dark comedy film &quot;I See What You Did There&quot;, which he wrote, along with Danny Wallace.

In 2014, it was announced that Serafinowicz would play the role of Crowley in the BBC Radio 4 adaption of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;Good Omens&quot;.

That same year, he was featured in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; playing Garthan Saal, a Denarian ranking pilot of the Nova Corps. He appeared in Series 9 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as the voice of The Fisher King.

During 2016, Serafinowicz created a series of YouTube videos entitled &quot;Sassy Trump&quot;, in which he redubed speeches given by Donald Trump with a camp voice. The videos were deleted from his YouTube channel in 2020, but have been re-uploaded by others. He has also created videos dubbing Trump with a Cockney accent and a posh English accent.

Due to Serafinowicz&#x27;s impersonation of Paul McCartney, Matt Berry sang a duet with him on Berry&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Witchazel&quot;. The track in question was &quot;Rain Came Down&quot;, where he was billed as Paul McCartney. He stars in the title role of Amazon&#x27;s &quot;The Tick&quot;, the pilot for which premiered on 19 August 2016. In 2020 Serafinowicz guest starred in the second season of TBS&#x27; &quot;Miracle Workers&quot;.

In September and October 2023, Serafinowicz began touring the UK as his character Brian Butterfield from &quot;The Peter Serafinowicz Show&quot; in the &quot;(Placeholder Name) Tour&quot;. The show toured the UK again in May and June 2024 as &quot;Brian Butterfield&#x27;s Call of Now&quot;. In March 2024, Serafinowicz played Tommy Dixon in the crime series &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;.

In February 2025, Serafinowicz played Johannes Van Der Velde in the BBC comedy drama series &quot;Amandaland&quot;.

==Personal life==
Serafinowicz met actress Sarah Alexander in 2002 when she was in a relationship with actor Gerald Harper, who is 40 years her senior. She left Harper for Serafinowicz and later married him. They live in West London with their son and daughter.

In October 2007, Serafinowicz dropped his attempt to use the Human Rights Act against national newspapers in which he sought to prevent the publication of information revealing that his Belarusian grandfather, Szymon Serafinowicz, was a member of the Nazi-controlled Belarusian Auxiliary Police, and had allegedly killed Jews while serving as police chief.

<text>Peters and Lee were a successful British folk and pop duo of the 1970s and 1980s, comprising Lennie Peters (born Leonard George Sargent, 22 November 1931 – 10 October 1992, Enfield, Middlesex) and Dianne Lee (born Dianne Littlehales, February 1949).

==Background==
Lennie Peters was blinded in one eye during a car accident when he was five years old. A thrown brick blinded his other eye when he was sixteen. Before Peters and Lee, he was a pianist playing the London pub scene. He recorded two singles on the Oriole label, &quot;Let the Tears Begin&quot; and &quot;And My Heart Cried&quot; in 1963 and 1964 respectively. In 1966, he recorded &quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot; for Pye Records and then &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; on the Gemini label in 1970. The latter he would revisit as Peters and Lee in 1976. He teamed up with actress and dancer Dianne Lee (born Dianne Littlehales, February 1949, Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England) in 1970. Lee would provide backing vocals for Peters&#x27; solo act. She was also at the time part of a dance act with her cousin Liz.

Their original act was called &#x27;Lennie Peters and Melody&#x27; until their management International Artists suggested the name &#x27;Peters and Lee&#x27;. Their first performance was with Rolf Harris on 30 April 1970 at a concert in Bournemouth.

==Early success==
The duo entered the TV talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; in February 1973, which they won for a then-record seven times, the second biggest winners of the show of ever, with such songs as &quot;All Change Places&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Confessin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Let It Be Me&quot; and &quot;All I Ever Need is You&quot;. Following their TV success, a record contract was soon signed with Philips Records. They were produced by Philips&#x27; A&amp;R man Johnny Franz, and their management company was International Artists, run by showbiz professionals Phyllis Rounce and Laurie Mansfield. Franz found the song that suited them well, and their recording quickly led to a number one hit; &quot;Welcome Home&quot; sold over 800,000 copies in Britain. A successful first album, &quot;We Can Make It&quot;, followed, which also reached the number one position, selling over 250,000 copies. Further single hits followed with &quot;Don&#x27;t Stay Away Too Long&quot;, which reached number three, &quot;By Your Side&quot; which reached number 39, &quot;Rainbow&quot; which reached number 17, &quot;Closer&quot; and &quot;What is Love&quot; at number 53 and &quot;Hey Mr Music Man&quot; at number 16. In the peak of their popularity they recorded two new songs for a movie called &quot;11 Harrowhouse&quot;, day after day and Long live love. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27QO7yhCOf8)

==TV appearances==
The duo were top of the bill at the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; in 1973. They were also resident guest stars on &quot;The Des O&#x27;Connor Show&quot; had slots on &quot;The Golden Shot&quot;, &quot;Mike and Bernie Winters&#x27; Show&quot;, &quot;Presenting Nana Mouskouri&quot;, &quot;Seaside Special&quot; and David Nixon&#x27;s show.

Peters and Lee had a popular (now lost) TV series of their own &quot;Meet Peters &amp; Lee&quot;, though 3 episodes exist on audio as well as including several Christmas specials made by ATV. &quot;The Peters and Lee Story&quot; was one Christmas special made for 27 December 1975 which starred Mike and Bernie Winters, Cleo Laine and Aiden J Harvey, who won &quot;New Faces&quot; in 1974. A special christmas radio show was produced for christmas day 1976 that exists as an audio. Their success made them household names and frequent appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; also kept their record sales steady.

After the &quot;Smile&quot; album and the 3 singles it spawned did not chart, Lennie and Di chose to split but still had many contracts to fulfill. So it took 2 years to fulfill all they needed to, so by 1980 they announced their farewell tour and LP. Their last television appearance before their split was &quot;London Night Out&quot; in November 1980, in which they performed four songs from their farewell album. And a radio spot on dec 2 at 8pm BBC radio 2 &quot;The last happy song&quot;. Their last regular concert.

==Solo and reunion==
Lee went on to perform mainly in theatre and acting roles, Her first without Lennie was in Sleeping Beauty in Bournmouth, whilst Peters recorded his only solo album &quot;Unforgettable&quot; in 1981 and released three singles, &quot;Record of My Love&quot; in 1981, &quot;Why Me&quot; for Christmas 1982 and &quot;Key Largo&quot; in 1985. Peters also appeared on a few small television slots and appeared briefly as a crime boss in the 1984 film &quot;The Hit&quot;, but without a huge success. Despite their fame, neither Peters nor Lee could repeat the success they enjoyed whilst together.

The pair reunited in 1986 with a new single, &quot;Familiar Feelings&quot;, to perform on the nostalgia circuit. The single was promoted on live from the piccadilly and the grumbleweeds show. The duo went on to record two new albums also, one in 1989 simply called &quot;Peters and Lee&quot; and the last in 1992 for their 21st anniversary, before Peters&#x27; death from bone cancer that same year, aged 60. Their final television appearance was &quot;Pebble Mill&quot; in February 1992 with a short interview and a performance of the hit &quot;Hey Mister Music Man&quot;. Sporting a broken arm, Peters&#x27; illness was apparent. Lee went on to marry Rick Price of Wizzard and recorded a solo album &quot;Chemistry&quot; in 1994.

<doc id="892711" wikidata="Q2908047" url="?curid=892711" title="Herb Washington">
<text>Herbert Lee Washington (born November 16, 1951) is an American world-class sprinter who parlayed his speed into a brief Major League Baseball (MLB) stint in 1974 and 1975 with the Oakland Athletics.

He was replaced in 1975 when the Athletics acquired a baserunning specialist who was also a position player. Washington returned to professional track, then became the owner/operator of numerous McDonald&#x27;s restaurants and a minor league professional hockey franchise. He has held a number of executive posts on varied boards and organizations.

==Early life==
Washington was born in Belzoni, Mississippi, and his family moved to Flint, Michigan, when Washington was an infant. His parents worked in the automotive industry. Washington attended Flint Northern High School until 10th grade, when it was discovered that he lived outside of the school&#x27;s boundaries. Losing a semester of athletic eligibility, Washington was forced to transfer to a rival school, Flint Central High School. There he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.4 seconds, attracting numerous college scholarship offers. Washington chose Michigan State University because he knew that there were a number of black athletes at the school.

At Michigan State, the four-time all-American won one National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title, won seven Big Ten titles, and tied or broke the world record in the 50- and 60-yard dashes several times.

Washington was selected in the 13th round in the 1972 NFL draft by the Baltimore Colts, but did not play for them; he informed the team that he was committed to competing in the Big Ten Conference meet, in addition to attempting to make the US Olympic track team for the 1972 Summer Olympics; at the time, amateur status was a much stricter requirement.

==Track career==
During the 1972 indoor season, he tied Kirk Clayton&#x27;s two-year-old hand-timed world record in the 50-yard dash of 5.0 at a meet in Toronto, which Mel Pender also tied twice a month later. The following week, he set the 60-yard dash record outright, stopping the clock at 5.8 at a home meet in East Lansing. Neither record has been surpassed , as races run in yards are rare, with records for these having been discontinued in 1976, and hand times ceased to be accepted from 1977. A few years later, Washington said that his biggest disappointment had been not qualifying for the 1972 Summer Olympics.

Washington was on the cover of the February 1972 issue of &quot;Track and Field News.&quot; In 1973, Washington again tied the 50-yard record at the same meet in Toronto. Later that summer, Washington won the international Pacific Conference Games 100 metres which was also in Toronto.

==Pro baseball career==
In 1974, Washington was tapped by Oakland A&#x27;s owner Charlie Finley to become the team&#x27;s &quot;designated runner&quot;. Finley and Washington worked out a one-year $45,000 contract with a $20,000 signing bonus. The contract had an unusual clause requiring Washington to grow facial hair before the beginning of the season. Washington had difficulty growing a full mustache, so he used an eyebrow pencil to simulate full facial hair.

Despite having no professional baseball experience, and having last played baseball in high school, Washington was a member of the Athletics 1974 World Series championship team. Finley announced that he would utilize Washington as a &quot;designated runner&quot; and that he did not expect Washington to develop other baseball skills. Washington received coaching on baserunning from Maury Wills. Though Washington&#x27;s teammates recognized his speed, he received a mixed reception from them because of his unusual background. Reggie Jackson said, &quot;He&#x27;s a great athlete, but he&#x27;s not a baseball player.&quot; Pitcher Rollie Fingers said that he thought the idea was &quot;a little crazy&quot; but that Washington &quot;could run like crazy&quot;. Bert Campaneris said that the team could count on Washington to steal a base when needed.

Before the 1974 World Series, team captain Sal Bando said that he did not think Washington should be used in the World Series, noting that Washington might not have a second chance to make up for any mistakes committed during the series. Appearing as a pinch runner for Joe Rudi in game two of the World Series, Washington was picked off first base in a crucial ninth-inning situation by Dodgers reliever Mike Marshall.

Early in the 1975 season, Washington was released. Before the season, the Athletics had acquired Don Hopkins, a pinch running specialist who could also play in the outfield. The Athletics had also acquired a second pinch running specialist, Matt Alexander, just before Washington&#x27;s release.

Washington played in 105 MLB games without batting, pitching, or fielding, playing exclusively as a pinch runner. He had 31 stolen bases in 48 attempts and scored 33 runs during his short career. Washington is one of only seven players to have more game appearances than plate appearances, presumably excluding starting pitchers who played primarily for the American League, and relief pitchers.

Washington&#x27;s 1975 Topps baseball card is the only baseball card ever released that uses the &quot;pinch runner&quot; position label.

==Business career==
Following his 13-month stint as the only &quot;designated runner&quot; in MLB history, Washington joined the professional track and field circuit and remained in competition until 1976. He worked for Michigan Bell as an assistant director of personnel.

In 1980, he moved from Detroit to Rochester, New York, where he opened an inner-city McDonald&#x27;s restaurant. He added his second local McDonald&#x27;s franchise seven months later, and in 1986 he opened a McDonald&#x27;s in suburban Pittsford, New York. He acquired a total of five Rochester-area McDonald&#x27;s franchises. Washington&#x27;s restaurant enterprise, HLW Fast Track Inc., owned 21 McDonald&#x27;s franchises in Ohio and Pennsylvania by 2009; at that time, it was the largest McDonald&#x27;s franchisee owned by an African-American. In 2021, Washington held a press conference to announce he was suing McDonald&#x27;s for systemic racial discrimination. At the time of the lawsuit, Washington owned 14 franchises, down from his high of 27 franchises. Washington alleged that he was being discriminated due to having him operate restaurants with low-volume sales to go with unfair grading. The two sides announced a settlement of the lawsuit on December 16, in which McDonalds purchased 13 restaurants for $33.5 million in exchange for Washington exiting the McDonalds system and dismissing the lawsuit.

Washington was co-chairman of the Small Business Committee of the United Way, and was active in the Urban League of Rochester. Washington was named to the New York State Athletic Commission in 1990. In 1992, he became the chairman of the board of directors of the Buffalo, New York, branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and later was named Director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

In 2005, he founded the Youngstown SteelHounds minor league hockey franchise in the Central Hockey League (CHL). The SteelHounds were removed from the CHL in 2008 for non-payment of league dues. Washington said that he had paid the league&#x27;s expansion team fees but that he owed some money, which he was withholding because the league did not reimburse him for some travel expenses. The International Hockey League (IHL) expressed some interest in picking up the Youngstown team, but the league dropped the idea after no serious meetings were held between the team and the IHL.

==Personal==
Washington married Gisele Gibbs, who also attended Michigan State University, in 1980, and the couple had two children, Terrell and Arielle, both of whom also attended MSU. Washington&#x27;s son Terrell ran track in college, and as of 2012, he was the general manager of his father&#x27;s McDonald&#x27;s franchising company.

<text>Air Force Base Makhado , formerly Air Force Base Louis Trichardt, is an airbase of the South African Air Force. It is the SAAF&#x27;s northernmost base, situated at Louis Trichardt near the border with Zimbabwe, as well as being its most modern, and is known unofficially as &quot;Fighter Town, RSA.&quot;

The base motto is &quot;Castrum Borealis&quot; (Fortress of the North).

==Units hosted==
* 2 Squadron – Fighter squadron
* 85 Combat Flying School
* 102 Squadron – Light transport (reserve)
* 515 Squadron – Security services
* 3 Air Servicing Unit – Maintenance support

==History==
The base was officially opened on 14 October 1987 as AFB Louis Trichardt, but changed its name to match that of the nearby town on 7 November 2003. The town has since reverted to its old name, but the base name remains unchanged. The base uses cheetahs to control wildlife.

<text>A blanket is a swath of soft cloth large enough either to cover or to enfold most of the user&#x27;s body and thick enough to keep the body warm by trapping radiant body heat that otherwise would be lost through conduction.

== Etymology ==
The term arose from the generalization of a specific fabric called &quot;blanke&quot;, a heavily napped undyed woolen weave. A popular theory has that the name derives from an eponymous Thomas Blanket (Blanquette), a Flemish weaver who lived in Bristol, England, in the 14th century.
However, earlier usage of the term is possible as a borrowing of the Old French word &quot;blanket&quot; for the type of fabric, attested as early as 1278 and deriving from the adjective &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;white&quot;. William Shakespeare is recognised as the first person to use the verb &quot;blanket&quot;, meaning to &#x27;cover with or as with a blanket&#x27;. In the play &quot;King Lear&quot;, published in 1608, the character Edgar says: &quot;My face ile grime with filth, Blanket my loynes, else all my haire with knots.&quot;

==History==
An ancient form of blanket is recorded as . The 7th century Chinese traveler and scholar Xuanzang mentioned the stuff in his travelogue of his journey to India in 629–645 CE. He refers to &quot;Kambala&quot; as a woolen material made from sheep or goat&#x27;s hair. He categorized it as a kind of material for clothing. The Sanskrit meaning of Kambala is &#x27;a woolen blanket.&quot; According to India&#x27;s ancient text, the Atharvaveda, kambala is a generic term for materials such as shawls and blankets. Known as &quot;Kambali&quot; in Kannada and Tamil, these thick coarse blankets are woven with sheep wool whose texture is extremely coarse and thick to provide adequate warmth in winter.

 was a type of Kambala from Gandhāra, Ancient Indian scholar Pāṇini mentioned &quot;pandu-kambala&quot; from the upper parts of Gandhara, the place was &quot;Uddiyana,&quot; which was famous for the said blankets. Some more variations of old Indian blankets are &quot;keca-lakah&quot;, &quot;kalamitika&quot;, &quot;talicchakam&quot;, &quot;varavanah&quot;, &quot;sarumitika&quot;, &quot;paristomah&quot;, &quot;samanatabhad&quot;, &quot;turangastaranam&quot;, &quot;varnakam&quot;, &quot;paristomah&quot;, &quot;samanatabhad&quot;. Coarse qualities were used by farmers, and herdsmen. Some of them were used to spread out on the backs of animals like horses, elephants, and bullocks.

==Types==

Many types of blanket material, such as wool, are used because they are thicker and have more substantial fabric to them, but cotton can also be used for light blankets. Wool blankets are warmer and also relatively slow to burn compared to cotton. The most common types of blankets are woven acrylic, knitted polyester, mink, cotton, fleece and wool. Blankets also come with exotic crafting and exotic material such as crocheted afghan or a silk covering. The term blanket is often interchanged with comforter, quilt, and duvet, as they all have similar uses.

== Uses==
Blankets have been used by militaries for many centuries. Militaries are some of the biggest single consumers of woolen blankets. Military blankets tend to be coarse grey, with thick fibers of over 20 microns.

Special blankets known as baby blankets are used to protect infants from the cold. Small children (and some adults) may also use a blanket as a comfort object.

Blankets may be spread on the ground for a picnic or where people want to sit in a grassy or muddy area without soiling their clothing. Temporary blankets have been designed for this purpose.

<text>Gnaeus Papirius Carbo ( – 82 BC) was thrice consul of the Roman Republic in 85, 84, and 82 BC. He was the head of the Marianists after the death of Cinna in 84 and led the resistance to Sulla during the civil war. He was proscribed by Sulla and beheaded by Pompey in Sicily in late 82.

== Life ==
A nephew of Gaius Papirius Carbo (consul for 120 BC), he was a strong supporter of the Marian faction, and took part in the blockade of Rome (87 BC). In 85 BC he was chosen by Lucius Cornelius Cinna as his colleague in the consulship, and extensive preparations were made for carrying out war in Greece against Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who had announced his intention of returning to Italy. Cinna and Carbo declared themselves consuls for the following year, and large bodies of troops were transported across the Adriatic Sea; but when Cinna was murdered by his own soldiers after a major shipwreck, Carbo was obliged to bring them back.

He spent most of 84 BC bolstering his forces in Italy. Convincing the Italians that Sulla would reverse their citizenship and voting rights, it was not difficult for Carbo to raise forces. The urban plebs, moreover, feared of Sulla&#x27;s response to a second civil war after hearing of Sulla&#x27;s vicious sacks of Greek cities. He orchestrated the election of his successors, Scipio Asiaticus and Gaius Norbanus to the consulship for 83 BC and assumed the proconsulship of the nearby province of Cisalpine Gaul. Shortly thereafter, he induced the Senate to deliver a declaring Sulla an enemy of the state and giving the consuls, Asiaticus and Norbanus, the province of Italy.

When Sulla returned from the east in the spring of 83 BC, he defeated Norbanus at the Battle of Mount Tifata, forcing his army to flee to Capua, and induced large defections from Asiaticus&#x27; army. Sulla captured Asiaticus, set him free to show his benevolence, and Norbanus extricated himself from Capua. In response to these setbacks, Carbo marched south from Cisalpine Gaul, but the Marian-allied forces were unable to mount an effective defence against Sulla and his allies.

Carbo induced the Assembly to elect him and Gaius Marius the Younger to the consulship for 82 BC. Carbo went north to Etruria to fight Sulla&#x27;s allies Metellus and Pompey, while Marius the Younger marched on Sulla himself. Marius marched his army south-east into Campania and met Sulla&#x27;s forces at Sacriportus (near Signia). The Battle of Sacriportus ended with Marius&#x27; army being routed (Marius lost 28,000 men; they were either killed, captured, turned coat or fled. Sulla claimed to have only lost 23 men). Marius survived the battle and with 7,000 men he retreated to Praeneste. Although he still had a large army and the Samnites remained faithful to him, Carbo saw that Sulla had won the balance of the conflict. Unable to relieve Praeneste he decided to leave Italy, ostensibly to raise forces in Africa, but never made it farther than Sicily. In 81 BC Sulla sent Pompey to Sicily with a large force (six legions, 120 warships and 800 transport ships). Carbo was soon discovered and arrested by Pompey, who &quot;treated Carbo in his misfortunes with an unnatural insolence&quot;, taking Carbo in fetters to a tribunal he presided over, examining him closely &quot;to the distress and vexation of the audience&quot;, and finally, sentencing him to death.

Although most notable for his role in the chaotic 80s, Carbo had also made a name for himself prior to that period, particularly during his tenure as Tribune of the Plebs in 92 BC. Under his supervision, and with his apparent encouragement, a meeting of the people broke down into disorder. The event was considered significant enough by the Senate to warrant a decree, championed by Lucius Licinius Crassus, placing responsibility for public disorder with the presiding officer; this decree was apparently still active forty years later in the time of Cicero.

As with several of the notable politicians of the 90s and 80s BC, such as Publius Sulpicius, Marcus Antonius the Orator, and Lucius Crassus, Carbo had a reputation for effective oratory. For instance, Cicero writes of one occasion when Carbo made use of a certain clausula (a dichoreus or double trochee – u – x), which was so effective that the audience all gave a shout.

<doc id="892717" wikidata="Q7601961" url="?curid=892717" title="Stark Law">
<text>Stark Law is a set of United States federal laws that prohibit physician self-referral, specifically a referral by a physician of a Medicare or Medicaid patient to an entity for the provision of designated health services (&quot;DHS&quot;) if the physician (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationship with that entity.

The term &quot;referral&quot; means &quot;the request by a physician for the item or service&quot; for Medicare Part B services and &quot;the request or establishment of a plan of care by a physician which includes the provision of the designated health service&quot; for all other services. DHS includes &quot;clinical laboratory services&quot;; &quot;physical therapy services&quot;; &quot;occupational therapy services&quot;; &quot;radiology services, including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography scans, and ultrasound services&quot;; &quot;radiation therapy services and supplies&quot;; &quot;durable medical equipment and supplies&quot;; &quot;parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies&quot;; &quot;prosthetics, orthotics, and prosthetic devices and supplies&quot;; &quot;home health services&quot;; &quot;outpatient prescription drugs&quot;; &quot;inpatient and outpatient hospital services&quot;; and &quot;outpatient speech-language pathology services.&quot; A &quot;financial relationship&quot; includes ownership, investment interest, and compensation arrangements.

The Stark Law contains several exceptions, including physician services, in-office ancillary services, ownership in publicly traded securities and mutual funds, rental of office space and equipment, and bona fide employment relationship. It is named for United States Congressman Pete Stark (D-CA) who sponsored the initial bill.

== History ==

In 1988, Stark introduced an &quot;Ethics in Patient Referrals Act&quot; bill concerning physician self-referrals. Some of the ideas in the bill became law as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. In specific, what is referred to as &quot;Stark I&quot; prohibited a physician referring a Medicare patient to a clinical laboratory if the physician or his/her family member has a financial interest in that laboratory. It was codified in the United States Code, Title 42, Section 1395nn (42 U.S.C. 1395nn, &quot;Limitation on certain physician referrals&quot;).

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 contained what is known as &quot;Stark II&quot; amendments to the original law. &quot;Stark II&quot; extended the &quot;Stark I&quot; provisions to Medicaid patients and to DHS other than clinical laboratory services.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has issued rules in the Federal Register to implement Stark Law, including a 2001 &quot;Phase I&quot; final rule, a 2004 &quot;Phase II&quot; interim final rule, and a 2007 &quot;Phase III&quot; final rule.

Penalties for violations of Stark Law include: denial of payment for the DHS provided; refund of monies received by physicians and facilities for amounts collected; payment of civil penalties of up to $15,000 for each service that a person &quot;knows or should know&quot; was provided in violation of the law, and three times the amount of improper payment the entity received from the Medicare program; exclusion from the Medicare program and/or state healthcare programs including Medicaid; and payment of civil penalties for attempting to circumvent the law of up to $100,000 for each circumvention scheme.

== Physician self-referral ==

Physician self-referral is the practice of a physician referring a patient to a medical facility in which the physician has a financial interest, be it ownership, investment, or a structured compensation arrangement. Critics argue that this practice is an inherent conflict of interest, because the physician benefits from the physician&#x27;s own referral. They suggest that such arrangements may encourage overutilization of services, in turn driving up health care costs. In addition, they believe that it would create a captive referral system, which limits competition by other providers.

Those who defend the practice contend that these problems are not widespread. They argue that physicians who own, invest in, or operate medical facilities are responding to a need for medical services which would otherwise not be met, particularly in medically under-served areas. In addition, it is often the case that physician owned entities present a lower-cost alternative to the facilities that are located at hospitals. This is due mostly to higher overhead costs that hospitals must pass down to their services.

==Enforcement==

Multiple federal entities oversee enforcement of Stark Law. These include the Department of Justice, CMS, and the Department of Health and Human Services. In recent years, enforcement of Stark Law has become increasingly aggressive, largely as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and its amendments to the False Claims Act.

2014 saw some of the largest Stark Law violation settlements to date. On June 9, 2015, the Office of Inspector General issued a fraud alert targeting physician compensation arrangements with hospitals and health systems.

==Risk abatement==

Contracts between physicians and hospitals must fit within the seven safe harbors for Stark Law in order to fully alleviate violation risk: the contract&#x27;s duration must be at least a year; in writing and signed by both parties; specify aggregate payment which is set in advance; payment is reasonable and fair market value; payment must not relate to volume or value of business; the exact services to be performed must be outlined; and be commercially reasonable. Because current processes for monitoring contract compliance and logging physician work hours are often done on paper, the majority of Stark Law violation settlements are the result of technical violations.

Healthcare experts agree that information technology is necessary to streamline hospital processes, including those relating to compliance and Stark Law. Certain electronic health record companies help healthcare systems collect, organize, and store data. Multiple technology solutions exist that specifically automate physician time logging and eliminates Stark Law violation risk.

== Reform proposal ==
The Stark law may impede certain pay for performance value-based arrangements, which led to discussions around reform as of 2019.

<text>Bedding, also called bedclothes or bed linen, is the materials laid above the mattress of a bed for hygiene, warmth, protection of the mattress, and decorative effect. Bedding is the removable and washable portion of a human sleeping environment. Multiple sets of bedding for each bed are often washed in rotation and/or changed seasonally to improve sleep comfort at varying room temperatures. Most standardized measurements for bedding are rectangular, but there are also some square-shaped sizes, which allows the user to put on bedding without having to consider its lengthwise orientation (e.g. a duvet).

In American English, the word &quot;bedding&quot; generally does not include the mattress, while in British English it often does. In Australian and New Zealand English, bedding is often called &quot;manchester&quot;, especially in shops. Manchester was a center of the cotton industry in the late 18th and the 19th century, and into the 20th century, and so cotton goods (principally sheets and towels) were given the name &#x27;Manchester goods&#x27;, which later was simplified to &#x27;manchester&#x27;.

A set of bedding generally consists of at least flat or fitted bed sheet that covers the mattress; a flat top sheet; either a blanket, a quilt, or a duvet. Sometimes with a duvet cover is to be used in addition to or instead of – the top sheet; and a number of pillows with pillowcases, also referred to as pillow shams. (See for more info on all these terms.) Additional blankets, etc. may be added to ensure the necessary insulation in cold sleeping areas. A common practice for children and some adults is to decorate a bed with plush stuffed animals, dolls, and other soft toys. These are not included under the designation of bedding, although they may provide additional warmth to the sleeper.

==Materials==

Lightweight white, solid-color or printed plain weave, satin weave, or flannel cotton or cotton/polyester blends are the most common types of sheeting, although linen and silk may also be used, including in combination. Goose or duck down and other feathers are frequently used as a warm and lightweight filling in duvets, comforters and quilts. But such fill can protrude in part even from tightly woven fabric, and be an irritant for many people, particularly those with allergies. Natural and synthetic down alternatives are marketed. Cotton, wool or polyester batting is commonly used as fill in quilts and down alternative comforters. These are less expensive and more easily laundered than natural down or feathers. Synthetic fibers are best in the form of thermofused (where fibers cross) batting. Thick-woven or knitted wool, cotton, acrylic or other microfiber synthetics, or blends of these, are typically used for blankets. The fabric produced from the cotton warp and weft, cotton warp and lyocell weft has a significant improvement in all manner and is best suited for making bed linen.

==History==
Among the earliest discovered examples of bedding are remnants found in a Paleolithic structure at Ohalo II, Israel. Dating back 23,000 years, these remnants consist of partially charred stems and leaves positioned on the floor surrounding a central hearth. Potential earlier evidence of bedding, dating from the Middle Paleolithic, is evident in Spain&#x27;s Esquilleu cave, displaying the gathering of grass near a hearth.

Around 3400 BC Egyptian pharaohs had their beds moved off the ground and slept on a raised surface. Bed linen was widely evolved in Egypt. It was seen as a symbol of light and purity, as well as a symbol of prosperity. The Egyptian mummies were often wrapped in bed linen. The complexity of applications has increased with research and developments in the area of bed linen materials over the years.

Roman Empire mattresses were stuffed with wool, feather, reeds or hay. The beds were decorated with paint, bronze, silver, jewels and gold. It was rare for a Roman couple to spend the night together. It was more common for each spouse to have a separate room. Researchers believe that the Roman bed was definitely less comfortable than today.

During the Renaissance, mattresses were stuffed with straw and feathers and then covered with silks, velvets or satin material. Embroidered canopies and ornamental hangings as well as the advent of the featherbed led to beds becoming extremely expensive, often willed down from generation to generation.

In the 18th century, Europeans began to use bed frames made from cast iron, and mattresses that were made of cotton. Until that time, assorted vermin were simply accepted as a component of even the most royal beds.

In the 19th century the bed spring was invented, also called the box spring.

In the 20th century United States, consumers bought the inner spring mattress, followed in the 1960s by the water bed (originating on the West Coast), and adoption of Japanese-style futons, air mattresses, and foam rubber mattresses and pillows.

==Elements==
==Terminology==

* Drop: The vertical dimension of a bed skirt.
* Flanged: Including a decorative band of fabric that is straight or tailored; often used to describe pillows or pillow shams.
* Hotel bedding: sheets with a high-thread count and unadorned designs, marketed to replicate the bedding materials that hotels use. The expansion of business travel has created a consumer demand for such products.
* Mako cotton: A high grade of cotton, the long staple or long fibre of Egyptian-grown cotton has more continuous fibres to use when creating threads or yarns. The yarn is smaller in diameter yet stronger than other cottons. Smaller yarn means that more threads per square inch can be used to create stronger fabrics which are lighter in weight yet breathe well. Mako cotton is frequently used to make upscale sheets and towels, which are marketed as a luxury product.
* Palliasse: Bedding made from strong material, filled with organic material, such as straw or horsehair and used as a mattress.
* Pima cotton: A high grade of cotton. It has the long staple similar to Mako cotton, which is what gives it its softness and luster, as well as its durability. Its superior characteristics improve with wear. Pima cotton is used to make upscale sheets, towels and clothing, which are marketed as a luxury product. Peru produces most of the world&#x27;s Pima cotton.
* Pleated: Material that is sewn in folds, like a fan.
* Tailored: Fitted closely, i.e. made to fit the bed exactly.
* Thread count: Usually measured either as the number of threads per square inch (i.e. ) or per 10 cm2 (i.e. ). The two measurement methods will yield different thread count numbers. For example, a count of 250 threads/in2 equals 31.2 threads/cm2.
* Throw blanket (also throw): A small covering usually used for warmth and decoration; it is usually placed at the end of the bed.

==Sizes==
Bedding sizes are made with consideration of the dimensions of the bed and mattress for which it is to be used. Bed sizes vary around the world, with countries having their own standards and terminology.

<doc id="892721" wikidata="Q705465" url="?curid=892721" title="Charlie Simmer">
<text>Charles Robert Simmer (born March 20, 1954) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey forward, most notably for the Los Angeles Kings in the National Hockey League, who was known for his scoring prowess.

==Playing career==
After a junior career with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey Association that saw him score 99 points in his only season (1973–74), Simmer was selected in the third round of the 1974 NHL amateur draft, 39th overall, by the California Golden Seals, where he joined a young field of players such as Larry Patey, Rick Hampton, George Pesut, Al McAdam and Stan Weir. He split his first three professional seasons between the Seals and the Salt Lake Golden Eagles of the CHL, having success in the minors but receiving limited playing time in the NHL. The Seals relocated to Cleveland in 1976, but Simmer did not receive more playing time.

He was traded in 1977 to the Los Angeles Kings, but spent the season with the Springfield Indians of the AHL, winning All-Star accolades. The next season Simmer was promoted halfway through the campaign to the Kings, and scored 21 goals in 39 games.

While with the Kings, he played left wing on the &quot;Triple Crown Line&quot; with Marcel Dionne and Dave Taylor, one of the most potent and famed forward lines of the era. Despite injuries costing him significant playing time, Simmer had back-to-back 56-goal seasons and was further named an NHL first team All-Star in 1980 and 1981. In the latter season, Simmer almost accomplished one of hockey&#x27;s most difficult feats: scoring 50 goals in 50 games. Simmer entered his 50th game with 46 goals and scored three times to finish just shy of the mark; that same night, Mike Bossy became only the second player in NHL history to score 50 in 50. Simmer scored his 50th goal the following night in his 51st game. Simmer&#x27;s shooting percentage of 32.75 in 1981 was, and remains, an NHL record.

Simmer was traded at the beginning of the 1985 season to the Boston Bruins, where despite the cumulative effects of several injuries throughout his career, he starred for three more seasons. In 1986, Simmer won the Bill Masterton Trophy for his perseverance and dedication to hockey.

Simmer played his final NHL season, for the Pittsburgh Penguins, in 1988. He subsequently played the 1989 season for Eintracht Frankfurt in the German Bundesliga and, after a season off, parts of two seasons as a player-coach for the minor league San Diego Gulls before retiring.

==Retirement==
Simmer finished his NHL career with 711 points (342 goals, 369 assists) in 712 career games. At the time of his retirement, he was the last active player in North American professional hockey to have played for the Seals-Barons franchise (though Dennis Maruk was the last alumnus of the franchise to play in the NHL, upon his retirement in 1989.)

He was formerly married to one-time &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate of the Year Terri Welles; the couple had one daughter. Simmer spent years as a color commentator for the Phoenix Coyotes and the Calgary Flames on Sportsnet.

<doc id="892723" wikidata="Q629149" url="?curid=892723" title="Workaholic">
<text>A workaholic is a person who works compulsively. A workaholic experiences an inability to limit the amount of time they spend on work despite negative consequences such as damage to their relationships or health. 

There is no generally accepted medical definition of this condition, although some forms of stress, impulse control disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder can be work-related; ergomania is defined as &quot;excessive devotion to work especially as a symptom of mental illness&quot;.

The phenomenon of hustle culture, while disregarding healthy work–life balance, may exacerbate workaholism.

==Etymology==
The word itself is a portmanteau word composed of &quot;work&quot; and &quot;alcoholic&quot;. Its first known appearance, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, came in Canada in the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; of April 5, 1947, page 6, with a punning allusion to Alcoholics Anonymous:

== Details ==
The term &quot;workaholic&quot; refers to various types of behavioral patterns, with each having its own valuation. For instance, workaholism is sometimes used by people wishing to express their devotion to one&#x27;s career in positive terms. The &quot;work&quot; in question is usually associated with a paying job, but it may also refer to independent pursuits such as sports, music, art, and science. However, the term is more often used to refer to a negative behavioral pattern that is popularly characterized by spending an excessive amount of time on working, an inner compulsion to work hard and a neglect of family and other social relations.

Researchers have found that in many cases, incessant work-related activity continues even after impacting the subject&#x27;s relationships and physical health. Causes of it are thought to be anxiety, low self-esteem, and intimacy problems. Furthermore, workaholics tend to have an inability to delegate work tasks to others and tend to obtain high scores on personality traits such as neuroticism, perfectionism, and conscientiousness.

Clinical psychologist Bryan E. Robinson identifies two axes for workaholics: work initiation and work completion. He associates the behavior of procrastination with both &quot;Savoring Workaholics&quot; (those with low work initiation/low work completion) and &quot;Attention-Deficit Workaholics&quot; (those with high work initiation and low work completion), in contrast to &quot;Bulimic&quot; and &quot;Relentless&quot; workaholics – both of whom have high work completion.

Workaholism in Japan is considered a serious social problem leading to early death, often on the job, a phenomenon dubbed &quot;karōshi&quot;. Overwork was popularly blamed for the fatal stroke of Prime Minister of Japan Keizō Obuchi, in the year 2000. Death from overwork is not a uniquely Japanese phenomenon; in 2013, a Bank of America intern in London died after working for 72 hours straight.

Workaholics tend to be less effective than other workers because they have difficulty working as part of a team, trouble delegating or entrusting co-workers or organizational problems due to taking on too much work at once. Moreover, workaholics often suffer sleep deprivation, which results in impaired brain and cognitive function.

The business risk that workaholism presents is an underestimated risk in companies and human resources management, which can develop into an existential threat to a business.

<text>Vicks DayQuil is an over-the-counter combination medication product used for the temporary relief of common cold and flu symptoms. DayQuil is available in several formulations.

DayQuil was introduced in 1974 under the name &quot;Vicks DayCare&quot; and is currently advertised for daytime use because of its non-drowsy active ingredients. The brand name was reintroduced as &quot; DayQuil&quot; in 1992. DayQuil&#x27;s nighttime counterpart, NyQuil, is also available for the relief of cold and flu symptoms during the night. These products are not intended to cure the common cold or the flu.

==Product selection==
Selecting a product should depend on the specific symptom presentation of the user. Products should be selected with active ingredients limited only to those symptoms, thereby reducing the risk of over treatment with medications that the user is not showing symptoms for. Additionally, careful note should be taken when purchasing multiple over-the-counter cold and flu medicines because many products may contain the same active ingredient. The potential for overdose increases when consumers are unaware of the duplication of active ingredients in these medicines.

==Research==
There are conflicting studies showing the effectiveness of over-the-counter cold medicine in reducing cold and flu symptoms. A number of studies have found acetaminophen (alone and in combination) to be effective and a safe treatment for common cold symptoms such as sore throat and body aches. In contrast, a systematic review including 26 randomized controlled trials compared the use of over-the-counter cough medicines with no treatment in children and adults exhibiting cough in the ambulatory or outpatient setting. Among the studies, there was conflicting evidence of the effectiveness of cough medicines containing an antitussive, antihistamine or decongestant in providing better cough resolution outcomes versus no treatment.

==Social and culture==

===Recreational use===
Abuse and recreational use of dextromethorphan have been reported with over-the-counter preparations and can cause euphoric and dissociative effects at higher than recommended doses.

==Warnings==

===Products containing acetaminophen===
There is a risk of severe liver damage with the concurrent use of acetaminophen products and excessive alcohol use (≥3 alcoholic drinks/day depending on body weight). Acetaminophen is an active ingredient of many over-the-counter single ingredient products (e.g. to treat headache), multiple ingredient combination products as well as prescription-only medications written by a physician. Each formulation also varies per dose. When purchasing over-the-counter medications, avoid purchasing multiple products with acetaminophen ingredients. The suggested maximum daily intake of acetaminophen is limited to &lt;4 grams (4,000 mg) daily in adults or &lt;2.6g (2,600 mg) daily in children &lt;12 years of age to reduce the risk of liver damage.

===Products containing dextromethorphan===
Those prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-i) should avoid the use of DayQuil products containing dextromethorphan within 2 weeks to avoid risks of Serotonin Syndrome.

<text>Gaius Papirius Carbo (c. 163 – 119 BC) was a Roman orator and politician. 
==Career==
Carbo was associated with the populist politician Gaius Gracchus in carrying out the provision of the agrarian law of his brother, Tiberius Gracchus. As tribune of the people in 131 BC, Carbo carried the lex Papiria extending the secret ballot for the enactment and repeal of laws. He also proposed that the tribunes should be allowed to become candidates for the same office in successive years, a response to the fate of Tiberius. The proposal was defeated, having been opposed by Scipio Aemilianus, in whose sudden death in 129 BC Carbo was suspected of having a hand.

Carbo subsequently went over to the anti-populist optimates, and as consul in 120 BC successfully defended Lucius Opimius, when he was impeached for the murder of a citizen (Gaius Gracchus) without a trial. At trial, he said that Gracchus had been justly slain. But the optimates did not trust Carbo, and he was impeached by Lucius Crassus on a similar charge. Feeling that he had nothing to hope for from the optimates and that his condemnation was certain, he committed suicide.

His son, Gaius Papirius Carbo Arvina, was remembered for his attempts to avenge his father&#x27;s fate. He followed his father&#x27;s prosecutor, L. Crassus, to the latter&#x27;s province in 94 BC with the aim of finding a reason to prosecute him. Finding this out, L. Crassus decided not only to forgive the son, but even to grant him a position within his close circle of advisors.

<text>Gaius Papirius Carbo Arvina (c. 124 – 82 BC) was a Roman orator and politician. He was an opponent of the reforms championed by the tribune Marcus Livius Drusus and the orator Lucius Licinius Crassus, and held the plebeian tribunate the year following Drusus&#x27;s murder. He held senior state positions in the interlude between the civil wars of 87 and 83 BC, when his cousin, Gnaeus Carbo, dominated the government. Nevertheless, during the war in 82 his loyalty was seen as suspect, causing Arvina to be murdered by government agents during a meeting of the Senate.

==Life==
Gaius Papirius Carbo Arvina belonged to a large generation of Roman orators whose members were all born around 124 BC and flourished during the youth of Cicero. He came from a family (the Papirii Carbones) which was prominent in Roman politics and the Senate during the late 2nd century and early 1st century BC. His father, Gaius Papirius Carbo, consul in 120 BC, had been an ally of the Gracchi brothers, deserting their cause after their deaths, only to commit suicide in 119 BC after being prosecuted by the young and rising orator Lucius Licinius Crassus.

Arvina grew up with bitter resentment for Crassus and was said to have conceived a lifelong enmity towards him. In 94 BC, Arvina followed Crassus to Gaul, of which the latter had been appointed governor, with the secret intention of gathering evidence with which he might prosecute Crassus for maladministration. Not only did Carbo find nothing incriminating within the governor&#x27;s impeccable administration, but Crassus found out about Carbo&#x27;s intentions and decided, to the surprise of later commentators, to incorporate him into his close circle of advisors. As a result, &quot;the keen and bitter Carbo got nothing from his trip to Gaul, except the realization that his father had been guilty and had been sent into exile by a man of complete integrity&quot;.

In 91 BC, Carbo Arvina was an opponent of the abortive political reforms promoted Crassus and his pupil, the tribune Marcus Livius Drusus. The following year he was a tribune of the plebs, and was very frequently seen giving speeches in the Rostra (denouncing Drusus, who had been murdered the previous year, in one of them). He is known for the law () carried by him and Marcus Plautius Silvanus while tribunes of the people in 90 (or 89), whereby the Roman franchise was offered to every Italian ally domiciled in Italy at the time when the law was enacted, provided he made application personally within sixty days to the praetor at Rome. The object of the law was to conciliate the states at war with Rome and to secure the loyalty of the federate states.

During the interlude between the civil wars of 87 and 82 BC, Arvina made some rare appearances in the courts as an advocate; Cicero describes him as one of the few orators of note still active at the time. He cooperated carefully with the government at the time, which was dominated by Cornelius Cinna and Arvina&#x27;s cousin, Gnaeus Carbo, and held the office of praetor in one of those years. In 82 BC, during the government&#x27;s civil war against the renegade general Sulla, the faction in power became suspicious of Arvina&#x27;s loyalty, notwithstanding his relation to the consul Gnaeus Carbo, and arranged for him and other unreliable senators to be murdered during a senate meeting in the Curia Hostilia. According to Appian, he was slain while still seated. His head was torn off, affixed to a cross, and set up on public display, whereas his corpse was thrown into the Tiber river.

Cicero, who heard the tribunes of 90 BC speak in the popular assemblies, identified Arvina as a second class orator, and described his style of rhetoric as follows: &quot;his language was tolerably nervous, he spoke with ease, and there was an air of authority in his address that was perfectly natural&quot;. Cicero also considered him the only member of the Papirius Carbo family who was a good citizen. Arvina may be the father of Gaius Papirius Carbo, a senator condemned for extortion while as governor of Bithynia.

<text>Harry H. Davis (July 19, 1873 – August 11, 1947) was an American Major League Baseball first baseman who played for the New York Giants (1895–96), Pittsburgh Pirates (1896–98), Louisville Colonels (1898), Washington Senators (1898–99), Philadelphia Athletics (1901–11, 1913–17), and Cleveland Naps (1912). He was the first player to hit for the cycle in American League history, doing so in 1901.

==Early life==

Davis was born in Philadelphia. He had no middle name, but he added the middle initial &quot;H&quot; to distinguish himself from others who shared his first and last names. He attended Girard College; the institution served as an elementary school and high school. Davis, who picked up the lifelong nickname of &quot;Jasper&quot; at Girard, graduated in 1891 and played amateur baseball until beginning his professional baseball career in 1894.

==Career==
After having played the 1900 season for the minor league Providence Grays, he decided to quit baseball, but Athletics manager Connie Mack made him an offer too large to refuse to return to baseball in 1901 with the Athletics. He led the American League in home runs from 1904 to 1907, one of only five players to have ever led their league for four consecutive seasons. He also hit for the cycle on July 10, 1901.
He led the AL in doubles three times and the NL in triples once.

Davis was the starting first baseman and first captain of manager Connie Mack&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics from 1901 to 1910. In 1905 he led the American league in home runs, RBI, runs and doubles, and led the Athletics to the 1905 World Series against the New York Giants. He was the starting first baseman for the 1910 World Champions and hit .353 in the 1910 World Series. In 1911, the 37-year-old Davis was replaced at first base by the younger Stuffy McInnis, and Davis played a reserve role for the 1911 World Champions.

Davis managed the 1912 Cleveland Naps, but left with 28 games left in the season and a record of 54–71. He returned to the Athletics as a player, coach and assistant captain in 1913, amassing only 33 plate appearances over the next five seasons combined.

In 1755 games over 22 seasons, Davis posted a .277 batting average (1841-for-6653) with 1001 runs, 361 doubles, 145 triples, 75 home runs, 951 RBI, 285 stolen bases, 525 bases on balls, .335 on-base percentage and .408 slugging percentage. He finished his career with an overall .978 fielding percentage primarily as a first baseman. In 16 World Series games (1905,&#x27;10,&#x27;11) he batted .246 (15-for-61) with 8 runs, 5 doubles, 7 RBI and 3 walks.

==Later life==
He continued as a coach and scout with Mack&#x27;s Athletics until 1927 and also served as a Philadelphia City Councilman.

Davis died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, August 11, 1947, at the age of 74.

<text>Diploma in Computer Science, originally known as the Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing, was a conversion course in computer science offered by the University of Cambridge. It is equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree in present-day nomenclature but the title &quot;diploma&quot; was retained for historic reasons, &quot;diploma&quot; being the archaic term for a master&#x27;s degree.

The diploma was the world&#x27;s first full-year taught course in computer science, starting in 1953. It attracted students of mathematics, science and engineering. At its peak, there were 50 students on the course. UK government (EPSRC) funding was withdrawn in 2001 and student numbers dropped dramatically. In 2007, the university decided to withdraw the diploma at the end of the 2007-08 academical year, after 55 years of service.

==History==
The introduction of this one-year graduate course was motivated by a University of Cambridge Mathematics Faculty Board Report on the &quot;demand for postgraduate instruction in numerical analysis and automatic computing … [which] if not met, there is a danger that the application to scientific research of the machines now being built will be hampered&quot;. The University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory &quot;was one of the pioneers in the development and use of electronic computing-machines (sic)&quot;. It had introduced a Summer School in 1950, but the Report noted that &quot;The Summer School deals [only] with &#x27;programming&#x27;, rather than the general theory of the numerical methods which are programmed.&quot; The Diploma &quot;would include theoretical and practical work … [and also] instruction about the various types of computing-machine … and the principles of design on which they are based.&quot; With only a few students initially, no extra staff would be needed.

University-supported teaching and research staff in the Laboratory at the time were Maurice Wilkes (head of the laboratory), J. C. P. Miller, W. Renwick, E. N. Mutch, and S. Gill, joined slightly later by C. B. Haselgrove.

In its final incarnation, the Diploma was a 10-month course, evaluated two-thirds on examination and one-third on a project dissertation. Most of the examined courses were shared by the second year (&quot;Part IB&quot;) of the undergraduate Computer Science Tripos course, with some additional lectures specifically for the Diploma students and four of the third year undergraduate (&quot;Part II&quot;) lecture courses also included.

There were three grades of result from the Diploma: distinction (roughly equivalent to first class honours), pass (equivalent to second or third class honours), and fail.

<doc id="892738" wikidata="Q292773" url="?curid=892738" title="Industria Aeronautică Română">
<text>Industria Aeronautică Română (IAR) (now IAR S.A. Brașov), or Romanian Aeronautic Industry in English, is a Romanian aerospace manufacturer. It is based in Ghimbav, near Brașov, Romania.

IAR was founded in 1925 with the aid of the Romanian government, which sought to reduce reliance on foreign companies to supply the Royal Romanian Air Force with aircraft and associated equipment. In addition to its designs, the company built numerous foreign-designed aircraft under license as well. IAR produced a low-wing all-metal monoplane, the IAR 80, during the Second World War; this combat aircraft was extensively used by the nation during the conflict. During the Cold War era, the company branched out into helicopters, securing licensing agreements with France for their designs in the field, leading to the IAR 316 and IAR 330. In 2000, IAR partnered with the multinational helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter Group to create the &quot;Eurocopter Romania&quot; joint venture company. Presently, the company employs around 1,200 specialists including more than 170 engineers; it carries out upgrades, revisions, and overhauls on helicopters and light aircraft.

==History==
===Origins and early years===

To ensure that the Royal Romanian Air Force (the &quot;Aeronautica Regală Română&quot;, or &quot;ARR&quot;) would be supplied with aircraft without reliance on foreign producers, the Romanian government subsidized the creation of three major aircraft manufacturers in the interbellum period. The first was Societatea pentru Exploatări Tehnice (SET) which was founded in Bucharest in 1923. Next came IAR, which was formed in Brașov since 1925. Finally there was Întreprinderea de Construcții Aeronautice Românești (ICAR), which was created in Bucharest in 1932, and operated a factory in Brașov known as &quot;ICA-Brașov&quot; (&quot;Întreprinderea de Construcții Aeronautice - Brașov&quot;).

One of the engineers designing IAR aircraft in the early 1930s was Elie Carafoli. During 1930, IAR&#x27;s first original aircraft, the IAR CV 11, performed its maiden flight; it functioned as an experimental design only. One of its earliest aircraft to reach quantity production was the IAR 14, a trainer aircraft derived from the IAR 12 prototype. The IAR 27 was a more advanced trainer that was introduced in larger quantities during the late 1930s.

In addition to pursuing its own designs, IAR also pursued work via the licensed production of foreign-developed aircraft. Poland&#x27;s innovative PZL P.11 fighter captured the attention of Romanian officials, leading to a batch of 95 aircraft, referred to as the &quot;P.11f&quot;, being built by IAR starting in 1936. The Romanian Air Force was greatly appreciative of the type, which heavily contributed to the decision to also licensed produce its upgraded derivative, the PZL P.24, which had been designed exclusively for the export market. Both models would see combat service during the Second World War.

IAR worked throughout the conflict to produce large numbers of combat aircraft to equip the Romanian military. Perhaps one of the most significant aircraft to be produced by the company was built during these years in the form of the IAR 80, a low-wing monoplane all-metal monocoque fighter and ground-attack aircraft. When it first flew in 1939, the IAR 80 was claimed to be comparable to contemporary designs being deployed by the most advanced military powers, including the British Hawker Hurricane and the German Messerschmitt Bf 109E. An improved model, the IAR 81 fighter aircraft, was designed and produced mid-way through the war as well. The type remained in frontline use until May 1945, when the conflict was brought to an end.

===Cold War era===
After World War II, starting from 1946, the production of IAR was oriented towards the manufacture of tractors. The first tractor produced being the IAR 22.

Between 1945 and 1947, under the coordination of Radu Manicatide and Radu Mărdărescu, IAR developed a microcar, named M.R., and an automobile. However, the company did not persist with road vehicle development in the long term. From 1947, IAR became the &quot;Intreprinderea Metalurgica de Stat&quot; (State Ironworks) and from 1948, the company was renamed to (UTB).
The current IAR was re-established in 1968 at Ghimbav, under the name &quot;Intreprinderea de Construcţii Aeronautice&quot; (ICA). The ICA developed from the former &quot;Intreprinderea de Industrie Locală&quot; (IIL) glider manufacturer. During this time, the company began to produce helicopters, motor gliders and airplanes, besides gliders. Romania arranged multiple licensing agreements with France, resulting in IAR producing Aérospatiale&#x27;s SA 316B Alouette III under the local designation of IAR 316. The company also manufactured a localised version of the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma, designated IAR 330. These rotorcraft were not only manufactured for domestic consumption, such as the Romanian Air Force, but also for the global market; roughly one-third of all IAR 330s were reportedly sold to export customers. During the late 1980s, a Soviet-Romanian partnership led to the development of the Kamov Ka-126 helicopter; only a handful were built before production was terminated shortly following the Romanian Revolution and the collapse of the Communist government.

Since 1968, IAR has produced more than 360 helicopters, along with 830 gliders and including motor gliders, as well as 136 light aircraft.

===Twenty-first century===
During the late 1990s, American aerospace company Bell Helicopters entered negotiations on the topic of acquiring a majority stake in IAR. According to aerospace periodical Flight International, Bell was at one stage set to purchase a 70 percent shareholding in the firm; this arrangement was closely tied to a planned procurement of the AH-1RO Dracula attack helicopter by Romania, which would have been manufactured locally by IAR. However, by 1998, the purchase was put on hold while efforts were made to raise funds for the AH-1RO purchase. Following a period of negotiations, in November 1999, Bell announced that it had abandoned its intentions to take over IAR and to locally produce the AH-1RO.

During 2000, it was announced that the multinational helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter Group was holding discussions over its own bid for IAR. Later that same year, IAR established &quot;Eurocopter Romania&quot; in conjunction with Eurocopter, the former held a 49% stake in the newly created joint venture. In November 2015, Airbus Helicopters announced plans to invest €52 million in a Romanian facility to manufacture the 8.6t H215M Super Puma; this arrangement was reportedly reliant upon an initial order for 16 being placed by the Romanian government to extend the type&#x27;s production.

<doc id="892739" wikidata="Q7824365" url="?curid=892739" title="Top-down parsing language">
<text>Top-Down Parsing Language (TDPL) is a type of analytic formal grammar developed by Alexander Birman in the early 1970s in order to study formally the behavior of a common class of practical top-down parsers that support a limited form of backtracking. Birman originally named his formalism &quot;the TMG Schema&quot; (TS), after TMG, an early parser generator, but it was later given the name TDPL by Aho and Ullman in their classic anthology &quot;The Theory of Parsing, Translation and Compiling&quot;.

== Definition of a TDPL grammar ==

Formally, a TDPL grammar &quot;G&quot; is a quadruple consisting of the following components:

* A finite set &quot;N&quot; of &quot;nonterminal symbols&quot;.
* A finite set Σ of &quot;terminal symbols&quot; that is disjoint from &quot;N&quot;.
* A finite set &quot;P&quot; of &quot;production rules&quot;, where a rule has one of the following forms:
** &quot;A&quot; → ε, where &quot;A&quot; is a nonterminal and ε is the empty string.
** &quot;A&quot; → &quot;f&quot;, where &quot;f&quot; is a distinguished symbol representing &quot;unconditional failure&quot;.
** &quot;A&quot; → &quot;a&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; is any terminal symbol.
** &quot;A&quot; → &quot;BC/D&quot;, where &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; are nonterminals.

=== Interpretation of a grammar ===

A TDPL grammar can be viewed as an extremely minimalistic formal representation of a recursive descent parser, in which each of the nonterminals schematically represents a parsing function. Each of these nonterminal-functions takes as its input argument a string to be recognized, and yields one of two possible outcomes:

* &quot;success&quot;, in which case the function may optionally move forward or &quot;consume&quot; one or more characters of the input string supplied to it, or
* &quot;failure&quot;, in which case no input is consumed.

Note that a nonterminal-function may succeed without actually consuming any input, and this is considered an outcome distinct from failure.

A nonterminal &quot;A&quot; defined by a rule of the form &quot;A&quot; → ε always succeeds without consuming any input, regardless of the input string provided. Conversely, a rule of the form &quot;A&quot; → &quot;f&quot; always fails regardless of input. A rule of the form &quot;A&quot; → &quot;a&quot; succeeds if the next character in the input string is the terminal &quot;a&quot;, in which case the nonterminal succeeds and consumes that one terminal; if the next input character does not match (or there is no next character), then the nonterminal fails.

A nonterminal &quot;A&quot; defined by a rule of the form &quot;A&quot; → &quot;BC/D&quot; first recursively invokes nonterminal &quot;B&quot;, and if &quot;B&quot; succeeds, invokes &quot;C&quot; on the remainder of the input string left unconsumed by &quot;B&quot;. If both &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; succeed, then &quot;A&quot; in turn succeeds and consumes the same total number of input characters that &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; together did. If either &quot;B&quot; or &quot;C&quot; fails, however, then &quot;A&quot; backtracks to the original point in the input string where it was first invoked, and then invokes &quot;D&quot; on that original input string, returning whatever result &quot;D&quot; produces.

=== Examples ===

The following TDPL grammar describes the regular language consisting of an arbitrary-length sequence of a&#x27;s and b&#x27;s:

: &quot;S&quot; → &quot;AS/T&quot;
: &quot;T&quot; → &quot;BS/E&quot;
: &quot;A&quot; → a
: &quot;B&quot; → b
: &quot;E&quot; → ε

The following grammar describes the context-free Dyck language consisting of arbitrary-length strings of matched braces, such as &#x27;{}&#x27;, &#x27;{{}{{}}}&#x27;, etc.:

: &quot;S&quot; → &quot;OT/E&quot;
: &quot;T&quot; → &quot;SU/F&quot;
: &quot;U&quot; → &quot;CS/F&quot;
: &quot;O&quot; → {
: &quot;C&quot; → }
: &quot;E&quot; → ε
: &quot;F&quot; → &quot;f&quot;

The above examples can be represented equivalently but much more succinctly in parsing expression grammar notation as {{code|2=peg|S ← (a/b)*}} and {{code|2=peg|S ← ({S})*}}, respectively.

== Generalized TDPL ==

A slight variation of TDPL, known as Generalized TDPL or GTDPL, greatly increases the apparent expressiveness of TDPL while retaining the same minimalist approach (though they are actually equivalent). In GTDPL, instead of TDPL&#x27;s recursive rule form &quot;A&quot; → &quot;BC/D&quot;, the rule form &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B[C,D]&quot; is used. This rule is interpreted as follows: When nonterminal &quot;A&quot; is invoked on some input string, it first recursively invokes &quot;B&quot;. If &quot;B&quot; succeeds, then &quot;A&quot; subsequently invokes &quot;C&quot; on the remainder of the input left unconsumed by &quot;B&quot;, and returns the result of &quot;C&quot; to the original caller. If &quot;B&quot; fails, on the other hand, then &quot;A&quot; invokes &quot;D&quot; on the original input string, and passes the result back to the caller.

The important difference between this rule form and the &quot;A&quot; → &quot;BC/D&quot; rule form used in TDPL is that &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are never &quot;both&quot; invoked in the same call to &quot;A&quot;: that is, the GTDPL rule acts more like a &quot;pure&quot; if/then/else construct using &quot;B&quot; as the condition.

In GTDPL it is straightforward to express interesting non-context-free languages such as the classic example {a&quot;n&quot;b&quot;n&quot;c&quot;n&quot;}.

A GTDPL grammar can be reduced to an equivalent TDPL grammar that recognizes the same language, although the process is not straightforward and may greatly increase the number of rules required.
Also, both TDPL and GTDPL can be viewed as very restricted forms of parsing expression grammars, all of which represent the same class of grammars.

<text>The Pathfinders were target-marking squadrons in RAF Bomber Command during World War II. They located and marked targets with flares, at which a main bomber force could aim, increasing the accuracy of their bombing. The Pathfinders were normally the first to receive new blind-bombing aids such as Gee, Oboe and the H2S radar.

The early Pathfinder Force (PFF) squadrons were expanded to become a group, No. 8 (Pathfinder Force) Group, in January 1943. The initial Pathfinder Force was five squadrons, whilst No 8 Group ultimately grew to a strength of 19 squadrons. Whereas the majority of Pathfinder squadrons and personnel were from the Royal Air Force, the group also included No 405 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force as well as many individual airmen from the air forces of other Commonwealth countries.

==History==
===Background===
At the start of the Second World War in September 1939 the doctrine of RAF Bomber Command was based on tight formations of heavily armed bombers attacking during daylight and fending off attacks by fighters with their guns. In early missions over France and the Low Countries there was no clear outcome regarding the success of the bombers’ guns: the Luftwaffe lacked widespread radar so their interception efforts were disorganised. On 18 December 1939 a raid by three squadrons of Vickers Wellington against ships in the Heligoland Bight was detected on an experimental Freya radar long before it reached the target area. The British bomber force was met by German fighters that shot down 10 of the 22 bombers, with another two crashing in the sea and three more written off on landing. The Luftwaffe lost only two fighters in return.

Although the causes for this disaster were debated it became clear that bomber forces could not defend themselves. Either bombing raids needed to have fighter escort, which was difficult given the limited range of the fighters, or attacks had to be made at night when the opponent&#x27;s fighters could not see them. In the era before the widespread use of radar and the techniques needed to guide fighters to their targets with radar, night bombing would render the bombers vulnerable only if they were picked up by searchlights, a relatively rare occurrence. Offsetting the advantages of night bombing was the understanding that identifying the targets and attacking them accurately would be much more difficult. This meant a night bomber force was useful only against very large targets such as cities and was one of the reasons daylight bombing was considered.

The Germans had also studied this problem and had invested considerable effort in radio navigation techniques to address it, demonstrating a standard of bombing accuracy during the night raids that daylight forces found difficult. The RAF lacked similar navigation systems, having ignored their development for a number of years and relied almost entirely on dead reckoning and optical instruments such as the Course Setting Bomb Sight. In limited visibility or when the target did not have a clearly distinguishing landmark, accurate bombing was very difficult. Bomber Command pressed ahead with a night bombing campaign starting in 1940. Bomber crews reported good results, turning for home if they lost their way or could not find the target because of the weather and pressing on only if they felt confident they could identify the target with certainty. However it was not long before reports started reaching the UK from observers on the ground that the bombers were never even heard over the targets let alone dropping their bombs nearby. At first these reports were dismissed but as other branches of the UK armed forces complained a report was commissioned.

The result was the Butt Report of 18 August 1941, which noted that by the time the aircraft reached the Ruhr only one in 10 ever flew within five miles of its target. Half of all the bombs carried into combat and dropped—many returned—fell in open country. Only one per cent of all the bombs were even in the vicinity of the target. Clearly something had to be done to address this or, as the other forces suggested, the strategic campaign should simply be dropped. Around this time Frederick Lindemann wrote an infamous report on dehousing, suggesting that the bomber force be directed against German urban areas, destroying as many houses as possible and thus rendering the German workforce unable to work well. Accepting the recommendations of Lindemann&#x27;s report after intense debate, the British began planning a major offensive starting in the spring of 1942 with the aim of destroying German cities. By 1940 the British had started development of a number of night navigation aids and were already testing the Gee hyperbolic navigation system on operations. These would be available in quantity in early 1942, just as the heavy bombers, the Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax, would be arriving in quantity. These technological developments dovetailed with the policy changes influenced by Lindemann&#x27;s report.

===Formation===
Faced with the same navigation problems as the RAF, the Luftwaffe had developed radio aids that were widely used during their bombing campaign, the Blitz of 1940–1941. Lacking enough equipment to install in all their aircraft, an experimental group, Kampfgruppe 100 (KGr 100), was given all available receivers and trained extensively on their use. KGr 100 would fly over their target using these systems and drop flares, at which the following aircraft would then aim their bombs. On rare occasions KGr 100 was used as a pure bombing force, demonstrating the ability to drop bombs within 150 yards of their targets in any weather. The KGr 100 unit itself would, in mid-December 1941, be renamed I.&quot;Gruppe&quot;/Kampfgeschwader 100, as the basis for a new Luftwaffe bomber wing or &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; (battle formation) that bore the same unit number.

The British, who had developed similar navigation aids, faced the same problem of quantity. Bomber Command expected to have only 300 Gee sets available by January 1942, all of them hand-built. Mass-produced models were not expected until May. As it turned out, both predictions proved optimistic. An obvious solution to Bomber Command&#x27;s problems would be simply to copy the German technique of placing all available sets in a lead force. This was first proposed by Group Captain Sidney Bufton. Bomber Command&#x27;s commander-in-chief Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris argued against the idea, with the backing of the majority of his Group commanders. His view was that an elite group would breed rivalry and envy and have an adverse effect on morale. Adding fuel to his argument was his dislike for Bufton. His idea for improving accuracy was to hold competitions within groups to deliver improved bombing. In rebuttal, Sir Henry Tizard, adviser and one of the chief scientists supporting the war effort, responded, &quot;I do not think the formation of a first XV at rugby union makes little boys play any less enthusiastically.”

Studying the German results, notably reports by R. V. Jones, the Air Ministry decided that the technique was sound and they overrode Harris&#x27; objections and forced the issue. Harris responded by suggesting the pathfinders be distributed among the squadrons but again his objections were overruled, since it would not produce the desired result of having the targets clearly marked in advance of the arrival of the main force. A specialist force was formed in August 1942 by transferring existing squadrons from the Bomber Command groups to make up the Path Finder Force (PFF).

The PFF began with five squadrons: one from each of the operational Bomber Command Groups, 1 Group contributed No. 156 Squadron RAF (equipped with the Wellington medium bomber), 2 Group No. 109 Squadron RAF—then &quot;special duties&quot;—(Wellingtons and Mosquitoes), 3 Group No. 7 Squadron RAF (Short Stirling heavy bombers), 4 Group No. 35 Squadron RAF (Halifax) and 5 Group No. 83 Squadron RAF (Lancaster). The PFF was commanded by Australian officer Air Vice-Marshal Don Bennett, who was to be the youngest officer promoted to RAF Air Vice Marshal, at the age of 33, in 1943. Bennett was not the Air Ministry&#x27;s first choice: Harris opposed the first choice, Basil Embry, the leader of 2 Group. The squadrons were located on adjacent airfields within 3 Group at Oakington, Graveley, Wyton and Warboys with a headquarters at RAF Wyton; 3 Group was responsible for the Force administratively though it was under the direct command of Harris.

===Early action===
The PFF was first put into action on the night of 18/19 August 1942, when 118 Bomber Command aircraft attacked Flensburg. PFF bombers were the first 31 aircraft of the raid, including Stirlings, Halifaxes, Lancasters and Wellingtons – from 7, 35, 83 and 156 squadrons. Flensburg, on an inlet of the Baltic, was in theory an easy target for the PFF on their first operation but the winds shifted and the bomber force drifted north of the target to a part of Denmark where the coast also had many inlets. Sixteen PFF crews claimed to have marked the target area and 78 Main Force crews claimed to have bombed it. Reports from Flensburg stated that the town had not been hit but a Danish report showed that the towns of Sønderborg and Abenra and a large area of Denmark up to 25 miles north of Flensburg were hit by scattered bombing. 26 houses were destroyed and 660 were damaged but only four Danish people were injured. The raid was a dismal failure, much to the delight of both Harris and other detractors of the strategic force as a whole.

The PFF&#x27;s second mission was against Frankfurt on the night of 24/25 August. The group once again had great difficulty identifying its target in cloudy conditions and most of the bombs fell in open country north and west of the city. Local reports stated that some bombs fell in the city, causing 17 large and 53 small fires and moderate property damage. Five people were killed, including two anti-aircraft gunners, and 95 people were injured. The outlying villages of Schwalbach and Eschborn were heavily bombed. Six Lancasters, five Wellingtons, four Stirlings and one Halifax were lost, 7.1 per cent of the force. Five Pathfinder aircraft, including that of the commanding officer of 7 Squadron, were among the losses.

The PFF finally proved itself on the night of 27/28 August 1942 against Kassel. There was little cloud over the city and the Pathfinders were able to illuminate the area well. Widespread damage was caused, particularly in the south-western parts of the city. Kassel reported that 144 buildings were destroyed and 317 seriously damaged. Several military establishments were hit and 28 soldiers were killed, more than the civilian toll of 15, with 187 civilians and 64 soldiers injured. Among the buildings severely damaged were all three of the factories of the Henschel aircraft company. Of the 306 aircraft attacking the target, 31 were lost, 10.1 per cent of the force.

The next night the PFF operated against Nuremberg as part of a force of 159 aircraft. Crews were ordered to attack Nuremberg at low altitude and the PFF used new target illuminators adapted from 250 lb bomb casings. Photographs showed that these were placed with great accuracy and the crews of the Main Force claimed to have carried out a good attack. A report from Nuremberg stated that some bombs were dropped as far away as the town of Erlangen, nearly 10 miles to the north, and four people were killed there. In Nuremberg. the number of bombs recorded would indicate that approximately 50 aircraft hit the town. 137 people were killed, 126 civilians and 11 foreigners. 23 bombers were shot down, 14.5 per cent of the force. Most of these were Wellingtons, which lost 34 per cent of their number.

On 1/2 September 1942 the PFF illuminated Saarbrücken as part of a 231-aircraft force, but post-raid analysis showed this to be Saarlouis, 13 miles to the north and situated on a similar bend in the river. The next night a force of 200 bombers was led by accurate marking in Karlsruhe, and the raid was considered a great success, with an estimated 200 fires seen burning. Reconnaissance photographs showed much residential and some industrial damage. A very short report from Karlsruhe says only that 73 people were killed and that three public buildings in the city centre were hit.

===Improved technique===

As the PFF gained experience new problems appeared. Many bombers in the Main Force lost their way to the target and either bombed randomly or turned for home. Another problem was that the illuminators would go out before the raid was complete, leaving the following aircraft to bomb on visible fires, if there were any. This led to the problem of &quot;creepback&quot;, when the newly arriving bombers would drop their bombs on the near side of the fire so they could turn for home earlier. This led to subsequent bombs slowly walking backward along the attack vector, away from the target.

To address these problems the PFF adopted new techniques. Their force was split into three groups for each raid. The &#x27;illuminators&#x27; would drop white target illuminators at points along the attack vector, allowing aircraft to follow these markers over long distances and thus avoid getting lost en route. The &#x27;visual markers&#x27; would drop coloured target indicators on the target, but only if they were sure it had been identified. Finally the &#x27;backers-up&#x27; or &#x27;fire starters&#x27; used the visual markers&#x27; flares as the aim point for their own incendiary bombs to light fires in the proper location, which would burn longer than the flares.

The new technique was first employed on 4/5 September 1942 on a raid of 251 aircraft against Bremen. The weather was clear and the PFF marked the target correctly, with the majority of the following Main Force finding the target and bombing it. The post-raid analysis showed that 460 houses had been destroyed, 1,361 seriously damaged and 7,592 lightly damaged. Added to this list were hundreds of light and medium industrial buildings, including the Weser aircraft works and the Atlas shipyard and associated warehouses. The raid was a complete success.

Another improvement was the introduction of larger bomb casings for the target indicators, starting with the &#x27;Pink Pansy&#x27; in an adapted 4,000 lb casing. Using these for the first time on the night of 10/11 September 479 aircraft attacked Düsseldorf and caused enormous damage. In addition to thousands of houses destroyed or heavily damaged, 39 industrial firms in Düsseldorf and 13 in Neuss were damaged so much that all production ceased, and 19,427 people were bombed out.

===German counterefforts===
The Germans were well aware of the RAF&#x27;s target marking and quickly deduced the basic strategy was a copy of their own from 1940/41. German intelligence reports from later in the war show a wealth of information on the PFF. On the night of 15/16 October 1942 on a raid by 289 aircraft against Cologne, the Germans lit a decoy target indicator that deceived the majority of the Main Force&#x27;s bombs. Only one 4,000 lb, three smaller General Purpose and 210 incendiary bombs hit the city out of a force of almost 70,000 bombs in total.

Follow-up efforts during October and November were mostly small raids, including a number against cities in Italy. Weather and operational problems meant that raids during this period were limited and of greatly varied results.

===New systems, increasing tempo===
On 20/21 December 1942 H. E. Bufton personally led a force of six de Havilland Mosquitos on a raid against a power station at Lutterade, a small town in the Netherlands. Led entirely by the new Oboe navigation system, several bombs fell within 2 km of the target. The test was considered a success. A follow-up under more realistic conditions was carried out on the night of 31 December 1942/1 January 1943 against Düsseldorf, with two Mosquitos leading a force of eight Lancasters. Only one of the Oboes worked but that was enough for the following heavies to bomb on and hit a number of industrial buildings. Another mission by three Mosquitos attacked the German night-fighter control room at Florennes airfield in Belgium, but there was complete cloud cover and the results were not known. It was clear by this point, after less than six months, that the PFF concept was a great advance.

Picked crews from the bomber groups were allowed to transfer and the PFF soon expanded into a completely new Group—designated No 8 Group (PFF)—in January 1943. 

===Master bomber===
On the night of 20/21 June 1943 another change in technique was tested by 60 Lancasters (mostly from 5 Group) against Zeppelin works at Friedrichshafen, which were believed to be making radar. In this raid one of the Lancasters was equipped with new high-frequency radio equipment that allowed it to communicate with the other bombers in the attack force. The follow-up force consisted of several groups, including PFF aircraft, who marked the target based on radio instructions from what would become known as ‘the Master Bomber’. Another group of aircraft were to attempt a new technique, bombing at a specific time after passing a ground feature, in this case the shores of Lake Constance. Nearly 10 per cent of the bombs hit the factory in what was considered a great success.

A combination of these techniques was first used on a large raid to great success on the night of 17/18 August 1943 in Operation Hydra against German rocket research at Peenemünde. A master bomber led 596 aircraft to a series of target indicators dropped at several locations around the target area. By dropping different-coloured indicators and calling aircraft to attack each one in turn, the entire area was heavily bombed. The aircraft from No 5 Group used their time-from-landmark technique again. The estimate has appeared in many sources that this raid set back the V-2 experimental programme by at least two months and reduced the scale of the eventual rocket attack. The V-2 team had to move their testing facilities hastily elsewhere. The Master Bomber became a common feature of large raids.

The United States Army Air Forces operated a similar force within the Eighth Air Force for ‘blind-bombing’ through overcast on daylight missions using H2X radar-equipped bombers, for which it also used the terms Pathfinder, PFF and master bomber.

=== Rivalry in Bomber Command ===
Although the AOCs of the Groups had been mixed in their enthusiasm for the Pathfinder Force, they generally supported it. AVM Roderic Carr (4 Group) was opposed to its creation but had identified Bennett (10 Squadron was in his group) as the sort of person suitable for the job and passed over a squadron of Halifax heavy bombers. AVM Coryton had been a greater opponent but supplied a squadron of the new Avro Lancasters. There was rivalry between 8 Group and 5 Group, driven by the rivalry between Bennett and the commander of 5 Group, Sir Ralph Cochrane. Through the CO of 617 Squadron Leonard Cheshire, Cochrane was an advocate of precision low-level marking and lobbied to be allowed to prove the theory and for 5 Group to attempt targets and techniques that 8 Group would not.

Cheshire marked targets using the fast Mosquito bomber, then later a Mustang fighter bomber. 617 Squadron achieved high levels of accuracy using the Stabilizing Automatic Bomb Sight; with the necessary accuracy of only at the V weapon launch site at Abbeville. 5 Group also invented various techniques, such as the &quot;5 Group corkscrew&quot; to evade enemy fighters, and the &quot;quick landing system&quot;.

===Light Night Striking Force===
The Light Night Striking Force (LNSF) was a development of the Pathfinder Force&#x27;s use of the fast and long-ranged Mosquito bomber, which could carry a sizeable bomb load. Under 8 Group, the number of Mosquito squadrons was built up and used for harassing raids on Germany. To the two (Oboe-equipped) Mosquito squadrons already in the Pathfinder Force, 139 Squadron was added in June 1943, which Bennett intended to use for diversionary raids to draw the German night fighters away from the main force. In February 1944 a raid made entirely by Mosquitos was mounted against Düsseldorf. It was formed of the usual marker aircraft from 105 Squadron and 692 Squadron Mosquitos, each carrying a 4,000 lb &quot;cookie&quot; and backup aircraft with 500 lb delayed action bombs. With Harris&#x27; support, Bennett formed more Mosquito squadrons to expand the LNSF, giving him nine bomber squadrons, as well as the Oboe-equipped markers and 8 Group&#x27;s meteorological Mosquitos. The LNSF achieved 27,239 sorties, their best month being March 1945 with nearly 3,000 sorties. The LNSF suffered the loss of just under 200 aircraft on operations or &quot;damaged beyond repair&quot;. The Pathfinder Force flew a total of 50,490 sorties against some 3,440 targets and at least 3,727 members were killed on operations.

== Tactics ==
The proportion of Pathfinder aircraft to Main Force bombers could vary according to the difficulty and location of the target; 1 to 15 was common, though it could be as low as 1 to 3. By the start of 1944, the bulk of Bomber Command was bombing within 3 miles of the PFF indicators, an appreciable improvement in accuracy since 1942. The success or failure of a raid now largely depended on the Pathfinders&#x27; marker placement and the success of further correction marking.

===Individual tasks===
PFF crews found themselves given ever increasingly sophisticated and complex jobs that were constantly modified and developed tactically during the bombing campaign from 1943 until the end of the war. Some of the more usual tasks were as:

&quot;Finders&quot;; these were 8 Group aircraft tasked with dropping sticks of illuminating flares, firstly at critical points along the bombing route to aid navigation and keep the bomber stream compact and then across the approximate target area. If conditions were cloudy then these were dropped &quot;blind&quot; using H2S navigational radar.

&quot;Illuminators&quot;; were PFF aircraft flying in front of the main force who would drop markers or target indicators (TIs) onto the designated &#x27;aiming point&#x27; already illuminated by the &quot;Finders&quot;. Again, if conditions were cloudy H2S navigational radar was used. These TIs were designed to burn with various and varying colours to prevent the German defenses lighting decoy fires. Various TI&#x27;s were dubbed &quot;Pink Pansies&quot;, &quot;Red Spots&quot;, and &quot;Smoke Puffs&quot;. &quot;Illuminators&quot; could include Mosquitoes equipped with &quot;Oboe&quot; if the target was within the range of this bombing aid.

&quot;Markers&quot;; would then drop incendiaries onto the TIs just prior to the Main Force arrival. Further &quot;Markers&quot; called &quot;Backers-Up&quot; or &quot;Supporters&quot; would be distributed at points within the main bomber stream to remark or reinforce the original TIs as required.

As the war wore on, the role of &quot;Master Bomber&quot; was introduced. This was an idea that had been used by Guy Gibson in the Dam Busters raid. Bennett wanted to lead raids but was denied operational flying as Harris was not prepared to risk losing him. The appointed Pathfinder (usually an experienced senior officer) circled the target, broadcasting radio instructions to both Pathfinders and Main Force aircraft, correcting aiming points and generally co-ordinating the attack. In September 1944, Gibson himself died in a Mosquito after performing as &quot;master bomber&quot; for a raid on Germany.

===Types of marking===
Three types of target marking were developed by the Pathfinders. These were known by the codenames Parramatta, Wanganui and Newhaven – the names coming from locations in Australia, New Zealand and the UK which had links with Pathfinder staff. If the &quot;Oboe&quot; system was used to determine the release point then the word &quot;Musical&quot; was used as a prefix, e.g. &quot;Musical Parramatta&quot;.

;Parramatta
:Parramatta used navigation aids such as H2S radar or Oboe radio signals to drop the markers.

;Newhaven
:Newhaven used illumination flares dropped above the target area to light it up sufficiently for a visual marking by the Pathfinder aircraft.

;Wanganui
:Wanganui was used when the target was obscured by cloud, industrial haze, or a smoke screen. Oboe or H2S was used to release the markers over the unseen target. The target indicators used were on parachutes to give an aiming point that could be seen by the main force. This was also known as &quot;sky marking&quot;.

In all cases, further target Indicators would be dropped in the course of the raid to reinforce the marking and to compensate for earlier TIs either burning out or being extinguished by the bombing.

===Equipment===
For marking the Pathfinders used a number of special &quot;Target Indicator&quot; (TI) markers and bombs. These ejected coloured flares or illuminated the target.
* Candle Aircraft, TI, Bomb, Type H
:the candle was the basic indicator. About 2 feet long and about 2 inches in diameter, it sequentially ejected flare pellets that burned for 15 seconds each. The type H was filled with alternately coloured pellets (red/yellow or red/green or yellow/green), and illuminated for about 5 1/2 minutes in total

Candles and other pyrotechnics were used as the fillings for the various Target Indicator bombs.
* No. 1 Mk 1 TI Bomb
* No. 7 Mk 1 Multi-flash Bomb
* No. 8 Mk 1 Spotfire Bomb

<text>Tag rugby, Flag rugby or Rippa rugby is a non-contact team game in which each player wears a belt that has two velcro tags attached to it, or shorts with velcro patches. The mode of play is based on rugby league with many similarities to touch football, although tag rugby is often deemed a closer simulation of full contact rugby league than touch. Attacking players attempt to dodge, evade and pass a rugby ball while defenders attempt to prevent them scoring by &quot;tagging&quot; – pulling a velcro attached tag from the ball carrier, rather than a full contact tackle. Tag rugby is used in development and training by both rugby league and rugby union communities.

Tag rugby comes in several forms with OzTag, Try Tag Rugby (UK) and Mini Tag being some of the better known variations. Tag rugby has the highest participation levels in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

==History==
According to sportswriter Terry Godwin, writing in 1983, tag rugby was first developed in Gibraltar by the Gibraltar Rugby Football Union. Due to the lack of grass pitches, an alternative variant to rugby union was developed. A cord was tucked into the waistband, and its removal by an opponent with a shout of &quot;tag&quot;, was classed as a &#x27;tackle&#x27;. If the attacking team had failed to score by the fourth &#x27;tackle&#x27; the defending team were given possession of the ball.

The codified version of tag rugby was created and pioneered by physical education teacher Nick Leonard in England in 1990 following an idea given to by a former serviceman called Barry Johns. He are described to Nick how navy servicemen on board ship or whilst playing on hard grounds overseas played the Gibraltar variant of rugby. Leonard then devised a set of rules suitable for children using belts and coloured ribbons attached by Velcro and organised the first ever schools Tag Rugby festival at UCP Marjons, Plymouth in 1991. This annual event celebrated its 20th festival in 2011.

==Tag rugby variants==

=== OzTag ===
OzTag is a non-contact form of rugby league, and can be seen as a variation of British tag rugby. Cronulla Sharks and St George Dragons halfback Perry Haddock introduced the sport in Australia while coaching the 1992 St George Jersey Flegg side. Together with Chris Parkes, the two took the sport to fields across Australia. Today, it is played by over 200,000 players in organised leagues across the country.

Games are usually played over 20 minutes a half. The normal dimensions of the field are 70×50 metres. Eight players in each team are allowed on the field at a time.

The attacking team has five plays or tags to try to score a try or take the ball down field as close to the line as possible. Like most versions of tag rugby, a tackle is made when one of two velcro stripes, known as tags, is removed from the ball carrier&#x27;s shorts.

Players can pass and kick the ball and tries are worth one point and there are no conversions. Kicking in general play is allowed but it must be below shoulder height of the referee and on zero count with no play-the-ball (from playing a knock-on advantage for instance) or after the fourth tag.

For mixed gender games, there is a maximum of four male players per team on the field and a try scored by a female player is worth two points, compared to one point for male players.

=== Mini Tag ===

The rules of under-7s Mini Tag possess some rugby union features, like an unlimited tackle count. It does not have an equivalent of the six tags law and instead tackled players must off-load the ball. Under-8s Mini Tag on the other hand, retains a six tag law (RFU Continuum 3.5.g) which requires that on the 7th tag the referee will stop the game and give the ball to the other side. The restart is with a free pass. For the full set of rules of Mini Tag see the Mini Tag Rulebook.

Mini Tag is currently the only form of rugby permitted by the English RFU for under-7 and under-8 age groups. Mini Tag requires the use of a size 3 rugby ball and does not allow scrums, line-outs or kicking.

==Tag rugby worldwide==

===Australia===
Since its beginnings in 1992, OzTag (or Walla Tag) has grown in popularity across Australia in urban and rural areas. Twenty-eight teams participated in the first season in summer 1992–1993 playing in the Cronulla and St George areas of Sydney. Today, 150,000 players take part in OzTag competitions nationally

There are Oztag competitions running all over Australia, with the largest areas located in Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra. Competing teams are in six divisions: women&#x27;s open, mixed, men&#x27;s open and men&#x27;s over-30s, 35s, and 40s.

===England and Great Britain===
In 2003–04, the English Rugby Football Union introduced Mini Tag into its junior development program called &quot;The Three Stages of the Rugby Continuum&quot;, replacing touch rugby.

Tag rugby also developed via IMBRL (Inter Message Board Rugby League) where message boards representing clubs took part in tournaments and friendly matches. Some developed into full-contact teams, others became tag teams and others folded. In 2008, a Tag Merit League was established based on the RL Merit League format. The league was developed with the intention to encourage new clubs outside the older IMBRL circuit to play tag rugby league. The Merit League operates on normal rugby league laws with tags taking the place of tackles.

In 2009 Try Tag Rugby began running adult tag rugby competitions throughout London using OzTag rules. By the summer of 2011, over 1,000 players were regularly taking part in week night evening leagues across London at locations such as Finsbury Park, Gladstone Park, Wandsworth Town, Tooting Bec, Richmond, Shoreditch, Highbury and Southwark Park. The number of competitions continues to expand with over 240 teams competing across venues in London and Reading in the summer of 2014. Try Tag Rugby also host the annual London Tag Rugby Championships which attracts teams from across the UK and Europe. 42 teams registered for the event in 2013, playing 136 matches under 17 referees across nine pitches; a UK record for an adult Tag Rugby tournament. In September 2014 the Rugby Football League and Try Tag Rugby announced that they would be forming a partnership to increase participation in the sport across England. In early 2015 Try Tag Rugby announced they were expanding to Yorkshire, with leagues set to begin in April 2015. Try Tag Rugby have continued to grow the game substantially in 2016 with 507 teams competing in early summer leagues.

Try Tag Rugby are the UK&#x27;s official delegates of the European Tag Federation (ETF) and the International Tag Football Federation (ITFF). The Great Britain Tag Rugby Team has hosted inbound tours from Australia in 2011 and 2014, and the Tongan over 30s Men&#x27;s team in 2013. The Great Britain mixed open and men&#x27;s teams also competed in the 2012 Tag Rugby World Cup in Auckland, New Zealand, while 2013 saw the first annual Britain and Irish Cup. In 2016 Ireland won British &amp; Irish Cup for a third time, by defeating Great Britain 4 - 2 across a record six categories. In 2017 Great Britain competed against Ireland in Cork across six categories once again, with Ireland retaining the cup winning the Mixed Open, Mixed Seniors, Women&#x27;s Open and Women&#x27;s Seniors divisions to take a 4-2 Victory.

In 2018, Great Britain played Ireland at the British &amp; Irish Cup in Dublin, in preparation for the ITF Tag World Cup held in Coffs Harbour Australia in November 2018. The tournament was reduced to four categories and Ireland again retained the cup for a fifth consecutive time narrowly defeating Great Britain by 26-22 competition points with the Great Britain Men&#x27;s Open and Men&#x27;s Seniors teams picking up victories.

At the 2018 ITF Tag World Cup, Great Britain came away with three medals, including a silver medal in the Men&#x27;s Seniors division, a bronze medal in the Women&#x27;s Seniors and a Men&#x27;s Open victory in the Plate competition, whilst the Mixed Open side lost in the Plate Semi-Finals to New Zealand.

In 2019 off the back of great momentum from the 2018 World Cup, Great Britain won the British &amp; Irish Cup for the first time, defeating Ireland 4–2 in London, winning the Women&#x27;s Seniors, Women&#x27;s Open, Men&#x27;s Open and Mixed Seniors categories, with the tournament once again expanded to six categories.

===Ireland===

The Irish Tag Rugby Association (ITRA) introduced adult tag rugby to Ireland in 2000 in association with the Irish Rugby Football Union when the first ever league was run for 36 teams. Their league is known as Volvic Tag. The Irish Rugby Football Union Tag Rugby began to run its own tag rugby leagues in 2007 following a split with ITRA.

The sport has become particularly popular in Ireland and in 2007, over 28,000 players in the two programmes making up more than 1,700 teams took part in tag rugby at 50 venues all over the country. This increased in 2008 and 2009.

There are four major types of tag rugby played there. They include men-only leagues, women-only leagues, mixed leagues (in which a minimum of one player must be female with no more than four male players on the pitch), and vets league (over-35s). Each type is usually played in four different ability categories ranging from A league (the most competitive) through B, C, and beginners league (the most inexperienced and usually the least competitive). Veterans leagues comprise teams of players all over 35 yrs old.

Many companies pay for or sponsor company teams as a method of recreation hence this format of rugby&#x27;s popularity and its non-contact nature makes it playable for mixed sex and age teams and inter-office competitions.

The Pig &#x27;n&#x27; Porter Festival is held each July in Old Crescent RFC, Limerick. It is the largest single Tag Rugby tournament in the world with up to 150 tag teams taking part each year for the top prize. The tournament regularly attracts teams from England, Scotland, France and the Netherlands.

In 2014 the ITRA introduced Rep rules which aligned their laws with the International Tag Federation. Players have the opportunity of playing for their Regional Teams (Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Clare and Kildare) from which players can play in the Tag World Cup representing Ireland.

=== Hong Kong ===
HKTag developed in direct association with Hong Kong Rugby League (HKRL), itself established in 2015. Leveraging the official rules of OzTag, tag rugby first appeared at the inaugural 2015 HKRL Nines, as a minimal contact, mixed format alternative to rugby league, and brought together more than 100 male and female players.

The growth of HKTag was the HKRL standout success of 2016. HKTag became the official governing body of Tag Rugby in Hong Kong and launched two more domestic competitions - Battle of Origin and HKTag Super League. This year also saw the introduction of regular social tag rugby sessions throughout spring and summer, which today continue all year round.

HKTag today has a solid community of members, participating in weekly Tag for All sessions, beginners&#x27; workshops, summer beach tag and seasonal competitions. The 2018 HKTag Challenge saw its highest ever participation, involving 12 teams and more than 140 players from all over the world.

In November 2018, Hong Kong sent a squad to the Tag World Cup in Coffs Harbour representing the mixed open and male open divisions.

===New Zealand===
In the Summer of 1993-4 tag was introduced to New Zealand by John Ackland a development officer with the Auckland Rugby League who had been to Sydney and met with the founder of Oztag Perry Haddock from Oztag Australia to expand the game in Auckland New Zealand. The First Kiwitag module was launched and run by Ackland from Fowlds Park in Auckland on Monday nights for 8–10 weeks. From this tag would begin its growth and development in Auckland and Porirua Wellington. The Otahuhu Tag Module and Wellington would be recognised partners to Oztag in New Zealand. Unfortunately, The game was to implode politically and become fragmented for the next 8 years. The Otahuhu and Porirua based NZTag body led by Wally Tooman and Hilda Harawera gained control of the game at international level, with the rest of the tag modules at the time from Howick, Northcote, Mt Albert, Waitemata Pakuranga and Ellerslie excluded and left to fend for themselves with no assistance from Otahuhu-based NZTag or the Auckland Rugby League.

It was not until the summer of 2000 that a meeting initiated by Stan Martin and William Halligan of the ARL was held at Carlaw Park between all the exiled tag modules to bring everyone together under one umbrella in the Auckland region. This would result in the formation of Auckland Kiwitag Inc with the Otahuhu NZtag Module declining to join the organisation.

Oztag Australia&#x27;s Perry Haddock would eventually reach out to the Chairman of Auckland Kiwitag Mr Claude Iusitini to play New Zealand teams selected from players outside of the Otahuhu Module for the first time and continue to do so to this day. Auckland Kiwitag would continue to administer the game of tag from 2004 to 2009 in amalgamation with Porirua Tag in Wellington then in September 2009 would rebrand and relaunch itself as New Zealand Tag Football Incorporated which has now been the recognised National body for all things tag football in New Zealand for over 10 years.

In 2003 the New Zealand Rugby Union established &quot;Rippa rugby&quot; – a variant of tag football – as a developmental tool and game for young children, and for primary school tournaments.

A split in the Auckland Kiwitag Board would see the launch of another version of tag called Tag20 Rugby a hybrid version of tag in New Zealand which was led by Gary Bauer and Todd Price in partnership with Australia-based Steve &#x27;Chief&#x27; Lyons.

===Tonga===
Tonga National Tag Team is the Tonga national tag team also known as Laione Hau or Tonga Tag. Established in October 2011, The first official national Tonga Tag team participated in the Pacific Cup hosted by New Zealand in February 2012. All variants of Tag Rugby and Flag Football are played in Tonga.

===Samoa===
Samoan Tag Incorporated is the National Tag Sports body in Samoa. Established in 2018, The first official Tag tournament was held in Apia on 3 February 2018.

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka Oztag, which is based in Australia and was established in 2015, participated in its first official tournament in 2015, the Emerging Nations Tournament before competing at the 2015 World Cup. In 2016, Sri Lanka Oztag won the Emerging Nations Tournament and will be competing in the 2018 World Cup.

===United States===
A tag game known as EagleTag, or non contact rugby league or flag rugby, is played in the United States using the same rules as Oz Tag. Another tag game based on the laws of rugby union, known as American flag rugby, takes place in a league every Saturday morning in July in Morris County, New Jersey.

===International tag rugby league festivals===

The Rochdale Swarm International Mixed Tag Rugby League Festival returned for its 7th year on 1 August 2015. Teams from France, Ireland, Scotland and Wales regularly participate alongside teams drawn from Rochdale, including Fijians and the local Asian Community, plus Kiwi and Aussie exiles. This is complemented by teams from all across England. The festival is a non-contact, mixed gender 7-a-side competition, where at least 2 of the 7 are female.

The Pig &#x27;n&#x27; Porter Tag Rugby festival, the largest in the world, is held each July on the grounds of Old Crescent Rugby Club, Limerick, Ireland. Over 120 teams take part in the weekend event. The popularity of the event can also be attributed to the après-tag festivities which include a hog roast and live music.

The Malta International Tag Rugby Festival was launched in 2011 with teams having contested the festival in its first two seasons from England, Scotland, France and the Maltese islands of Malta and Gozo. The festival is a partner event of the Malta Rugby League (MRL). London&#x27;s Try Tag Rugby All-Stars have been a regular feature at the festival every year since its inception and the festival is becoming known as &#x27;the hottest tag rugby festival in Europe&#x27;. Winners of the Malta International Tag Rugby Festival have been Try Tag Rugby All-Stars - UK (2011), Try Tag Rugby All-Stars - UK (2012) and Tumeke - UK (2013).

In December 2015 Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia hosted the Tag Rugby World Cup. In November 2018, the Tag Rugby World Cup will be held in Coffs Harbour, Australia.
