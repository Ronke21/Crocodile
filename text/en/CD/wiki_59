<text>In differential geometry a Poisson supermanifold is a differential supermanifold M such that the supercommutative algebra of smooth functions over it (to clarify this: M is not a point set space and so, doesn&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; exist, and really, this algebra is all we have), formula_1 is equipped with a bilinear map called the Poisson superbracket turning it into a Poisson superalgebra.

Every symplectic supermanifold is a Poisson supermanifold but not vice versa.

<text>Antoni Słonimski (15 November 1895 – 4 July 1976) was a Polish poet, artist, journalist, playwright and prose writer, president of the Union of Polish Writers in 1956–1959 during the Polish October, known for his devotion to social justice.

Słonimski was the grandson of Hayyim Selig Slonimski, the founder of &quot;ha-Tsefirah&quot;- the first Hebrew weekly with an emphasis on the sciences. His father, an ophthalmologist, converted to Christianity when he married a Catholic woman. Słonimski was born in Warsaw and baptized and raised as a Christian. Słonimski studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. In 1919 he co-founded the &quot;Skamander&quot; group of experimental poets with Julian Tuwim and Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz. In 1924 he travelled to Palestine and Brasil and in 1932 to the Soviet Union.

Słonimski spent the war years in exile in England and France, returning to Poland in 1951. He worked as contributor to popular periodicals: &quot;Nowa Kultura&quot; (1950–1962), &quot;Szpilki&quot; (1953–73) and &quot;Przegląd Kulturalny&quot;. He was an active anti-Stalinist and supporter of liberalization. In 1964 he was one of the signatories and the main author of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture. Słonimski died on 4 July 1976 in a car accident in Warsaw.

<doc id="891277" wikidata="Q3309208" url="?curid=891277" title="Arjun Singh (Congress politician)">
<text>Arjun Singh (5 November 1930 – 4 March 2011) was an Indian politician from the Indian National Congress, who served twice as the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh in the 1980s. He also served twice as the Union Minister of Human Resource Development, in the Manmohan Singh and P. V. Narasimha Rao ministries.

The surrender of dacoit Phoolan Devi in 1983 was a significant event during his tenure as Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, reflecting efforts by his government to restore law and order, particularly in the Chambal region, while also dealing with the underlying socio-economic issues.

He is widely remembered for introducing 27% reservation for Other Backward Classes in educational institutions including All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), with the passage of Ninety-third Constitutional Amendment and Central Educational Institutions(CEIs) (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006. This led to anti-reservation protests against this act. The protests ended after Supreme Court of India upheld the reservations in higher education.

==Early life==
Arjun Singh was born on 5 November 1930 into a Rajput family as the son of Shiv Bahadur Singh, a jagirdar and the 26th Rao of Churhat thikana, and an INC politician. He received his Bachelor of Laws from Rewa Darbar College, where he was the student union president in 1953.

==Career==
Arjun Singh was first elected to the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly in 1957 from Majholi as an independent candidate. He joined the Indian National Congress in 1960. He was re-elected from Majholi in 1962 and became a minister in the INC government of Dwarka Prasad Mishra.

In 1967, he lost the election from Churhat due to a fallout with the then chief minister Dwarka Prasad Mishra. However, he won a bypoll in the same year from Umaria. He was elected from Sidhi in 1972 and became a minister in the INC government of Prakash Chandra Sethi.

In 1977, he was elected from Churhat and became the Leader of Opposition in the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly. In 1980, when INC achieved a simple majority in the assembly, he won from Churhat and became the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, despite the presence of strong contenders such as Sethi, Vidya Charan Shukla and Shiv Bhanu Singh Solanki.

As chief minister, Singh implemented several populist initiatives, including the regularisation of slums and providing free electricity connections to residents. During his time in office, the dacoit Phoolan Devi surrendered. His five-year tenure was also notably marked by the Bhopal Gas Tragedy.

He led the INC to victory in 1985, yet again winning from Churhat, but was forced to resign as Chief Minister after just one day due to differences with Sriniwas Tiwari. Motilal Vora succeeded him as Chief Minister.

He resigned his Madhya Pradesh assembly seat and was appointed Governor of Punjab in 1985. He worked for the implementation of the Rajiv-Longowal Accord for peace in Punjab. However, after eight months, he resigned as Governor and became Minister of Commerce in the Rajiv Gandhi cabinet. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from South Delhi in a bypoll in 1985, necessitated by the assassination of the sitting MP Lalit Maken. He was appointed First Vice-President of Indian National Congress by Rajiv Gandhi.

In 1986, he resigned the Commerce ministry and was appointed Minister of Communications. He held this post till 1988 when he returned to the Government of Madhya Pradesh and again became Chief Minister of the state. He resigned his Lok Sabha seat and won a bypoll to the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Kharsia in 1988. However, he resigned as Chief Minister in 1989 owing to the Churhat lottery scam, and was succeeded by Motilal Vora. He won in 1990 from Churhat.

In 1991, he won from Satna. He resigned his assembly seat and harboured ambitions of becoming Prime Minister after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.

However, P. V. Narasimha Rao became Prime Minister and Singh was appointed the Minister of Human Resource Development. He publicly expressed discontent with the Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao after the Babri Masjid demolition. He resigned as Minister of Human Resource Development in 1994.

In 1996, he rebelled against the INC leadership and formed the All India Indira Congress (Tiwari) along with Narayan Dutt Tiwari. However, he lost in 1996 from Satna.

Later, he returned to INC after the emergence of Sonia Gandhi. He lost in 1998 from Hoshangabad.

He was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2000 from Madhya Pradesh and was re-elected in 2006. He was awarded the Outstanding Parliamentarian Award in 2000. He served as Minister of Human Resource Development from 2004 to 2009 in the Manmohan Singh cabinet.

==Social Justice ==
===Reservation for Other Backward Class (OBCs) in educational institutions===

Arjun Singh had immense contributions for social justice in India. He is credited with implementing reservations for Other Backward Classes in higher educational institutions. After the State Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry, Assam and West Bengal, Arjun Singh promised to reserve 27% seats for Other Backward Classes in All India Institutes of Medical Sciences, Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Management, and other central universities. The Ninety-third Constitutional Amendment, that was introduced by the First Manmohan Singh ministry, granted a 27% reservation for Other Backward Classes in all Central Government educational institutions.

The 93rd Amendment Act of 2005 to the Indian Constitution added clause (5) in Article 15 which enables the government to make any special provision for the development of any socially and educationally backward classes of people, or scheduled castes or scheduled tribes, with regard to their enrolment in educational institutions, which would include private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the government, but apart from minority educational institutions. After the 93rd Amendment Act, the Central Educational Institutions(CEIs) (Reservation in Admission) Act, was enacted by the Union Parliament in the year 2006.

This led to widespread anti-reservation protests where students engaged in street protests across India. Later on, students took legal action against the Act by filing Public Interest Litigation, claiming that it violated the Basic Structure of the Constitution of India. In March 2007, the Supreme Court of India granted an injunction to suspension of OBC reservations. 

In April 2008, a 5-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, in the Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India case, upheld the Ninety-third Constitutional Amendment, and reinstated the Act in a judgement delivered by Chief Justice India K. G. Balakrishnan, with Justices Arijit Pasayat, C K Thakker, R V Raveendran and Dalveer Bhandari. OBC reservations were implemented in all central universities and institutions, but the government was required to exclude the creamy layer from the OBC, but not SC/ST.

==Controversies==

===Bhopal Incident===
Arjun Singh was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh when the deadly gas leak from the Union Carbide factory occurred. It is widely alleged that on the fateful night between 2 and 3 December 1984, when the gas leak occurred, Arjun Singh fled to his Kerwa Dam Palace (outside Bhopal) to save himself from deadly effects of leaked gas and was not available to manage the crisis or lead the administration.

Subsequently, the Arjun Singh government&#x27;s mishandling was criticised by the court in the verdict on the Bhopal disaster as pronounced by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bhopal on 7 June 2010. The media raised serious questions about his role in the release of Warren Anderson.

In particular, the pilot of the aircraft in which Warren Anderson flew out of India after the gas leak, has recorded that the final sanction to permit the flight came from Arjun Singh&#x27;s office.

===Churhat Lottery case and Kerwa Dam palace===
While Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Singh was involved in the scandal known as the Churhat Lottery case. The Churhat Children Welfare Society was floated in 1982 by relatives of Singh, and permitted to raise funds via lottery, and also given tax relief as a charity. However, there were widespread allegations that substantial sums of money were siphoned off from donations and used to construct the lavish Kerwa Dam Palace near Bhopal. The donations to the society included a Rs 150,000 donation from Union Carbide, whose chief Warren Anderson was permitted to leave the country after the gas leak, allegedly by Arjun Singh&#x27;s office.

At a public litigation hearing, the Madhya Pradesh High Court observed that &quot;Arjun Singh owed an explanation to the nation about the costs and sources of construction of the palatial mansion in Bhopal&quot;. While Singh had claimed the value of the palace was Rs 1.8 million, the IT Department estimated the cost at above Rs one crore.
However, a one-judge commission investigating the scandal gave a clean chit to Arjun Singh. The case was re-opened however, after the Jain Hawala case, and Singh was asked to submit fresh re-estimates of the palace cost.
In court, the case was argued by Kapil Sibal and the order for re-examination was squashed on the grounds that it had been issued in a haste and &quot;had not applied his mind&quot;.

===Other controversies===
After the Mumbai train bombings of 2006, he reportedly quoted at a Cabinet meeting the statements of a former judge of the Maharashtra High Court that an earlier attempt on the headquarters of the Hindu revivalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Nagpur had been a plot set into motion by the Sangh itself. This followed his denouncement of the Ekal Vidyalayas, one-teacher schools run for the benefit of the tribals of India by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, as communal.

A case under the Anti-Dowry Act was registered against Arjun Singh in 2007. The then Uttar Pradesh government had decided to seek CBI inquiry into dowry harassment case.

Arjun Singh was accused of irregularities and corruption in the grant of &quot;Deemed University&quot; status to private for-profit educational institutions which did not meet requisite educational standards, during his tenure as Minister for Human Resources Development. The Government of India initiated proceedings to repeal the &quot;Deemed University&quot; status of 44 such institutions in January 2010.

==Death==
Singh died on 4 March 2011, at the age of 80. He had been admitted in Delhi&#x27;s All India Institute of Medical Sciences with chest pain and neurological problems, and died of a heart attack. He was cremated at his home town of Churhat.

==Family==
Arjun Singh&#x27;s son Ajay Singh aka Rahul Bhaiya is an INC politician and former Leader of Opposition in the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly. His grandson is Arunoday Singh, a Bollywood actor.

Another grandson of his, Yuvaraja Aishwarya Singh of Singrauli is married to Devyani Rana, great-granddaughter of Mohan Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, the last Shree Teen Maharaja of Nepal. Devyani’s father- His Highness Shree Teen Maharaja Pashupati Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana is the titular Shree Teen Maharaja of Nepal.

<text>Yamaha XG (Extended General MIDI) is an extension to the General MIDI standard, created by Yamaha. It is similar in purpose to the Roland GS standard.

==Features==
Relative to General MIDI, XG gained popularity by increasing the number of available instruments from 128 to 480 with an additional 11 drum kits and introduced a large set of standard controllers and parameters that composers could employ to achieve greater subtlety and realism in their compositions. The XG also has a synthesizer that provides a 32/64 note polyphonic feature which is shared through the supported 16 MIDI channels. XG has a wide range of sounds to form such complex chords and produces a wide variety of lower synthesizer sounds to choose from.

A subset known as &quot;XGlite&quot; is featured in most of Yamaha&#x27;s lower-end electronic keyboard products such as the PSR/PortaTone line. It features a reduced set of 361 instruments (381 in some models) and greatly simplified effect parameters and controllers.

==History==
In 1994, Yamaha released the first XG-based product: Yamaha MU80 Tone Generator. In 1995, Yamaha released the first XG-based product for PC users, the DB50XG daughterboard, a Creative Wave Blaster competitor.
In 1996, Yamaha released MU10 external module, basically, a DB50XG in a case and later the SW60XG ISA PC card and the DB51XG a smaller version of the DB50XG daughterboard. Coupled with their tone generator, these devices included an onboard 4 MB sound bank chip of sampled instruments and became highly desirable among MIDI fans due to their crisp, high-quality sounds similar to the newer models of Roland Sound Canvas . These devices feature an effects processing system with individual stereo reverb and chorus effects on any of 16 channels, the ability to route any of the channels through an additional &#x27;insertion&#x27; effect, and even guitar amp and wah-wah pedal simulations. Yamaha&#x27;s in-house songwriters often utilized these tools to demonstrate the power of the XG format, notably recreating Jimi Hendrix leads complete with feedback, flamenco guitar with distinct pick/hammered notes and finger slides, growling saxophones, and even a very convincing sitar .

==Discontinued products==
The DB50XG, DB51XG, SW60XG and SW1000XG are all discontinued.

The SW1000XG was popular in the professional music industry, and many of Yamaha&#x27;s amateur and professional keyboards implement either XG or a subset, known as &quot;XGlite&quot;. Many notebooks include the Yamaha YMF7xx chipset which has a scaled-down XG-compatible MIDI synth. The DB60XG, a DB50XG with an analog input, is available only in Japan. .Most XG standard tone generators can switch itself into TG300B mode, which is an emulation of the competing Roland GS standard that allows adequate playback of musical data bearing the GS logo.

The XG-compatible Yamaha S-YXG50 SoftSynthesizer, which is discontinued, is an entirely software-based MIDI synth. It used a 2 MB or 4 MB wavetable sound set, and was common among non-professional users who needed a cheap, high-quality MIDI synthesizer for purposes such as playing video games that rely on MIDI for their music.

==Korg compatibility==
Korg, due to its close relationship with Yamaha, released three instruments with XG compatibility:

* the NS5R, which offered XG compatibility through an add-in daughterboard;
* the NX5R, electronically similar to the NS5R, except that the daughterboard is part of the instrument;
* the N-series of keyboards and modules, which also offered support for Roland&#x27;s GS and GM2 standards as well.

Korg was the only manufacturer outside of Yamaha to produce XG-certified instruments.

<doc id="891284" wikidata="Q5544829" url="?curid=891284" title="George Sterling">
<text>George Sterling (December 1, 1869 – November 17, 1926) was an American writer based in the San Francisco, California Bay Area and Carmel-by-the-Sea. He was considered a prominent poet and playwright and proponent of Bohemianism during the first quarter of the twentieth century. His work was admired by writers as diverse as Ambrose Bierce, Theodore Dreiser, Robinson Jeffers, Sinclair Lewis, Jack London, H. P. Lovecraft, H. L. Mencken, Upton Sinclair, and Clark Ashton Smith. In addition, Sterling played a major role in the growth of the California cities of Oakland, Piedmont, and Carmel-by-the-Sea.

==Literary career and critical responses==
During George Sterling&#x27;s thirty-year career as a writer, he wrote songs, plays, movies, short stories, essays, and more than a thousand poems. His works were published in nearly all American literary magazines, in more than a hundred newspapers, in anthologies, and in his own books. He earned several literary awards.

Although some critics of his time dismissed Sterling&#x27;s poems (In &quot;Freeman&quot; magazine, poet John Gould Fletcher called him &quot;a versifier lavishing his craft on subjects beneath the dignity of a true poet&quot;), other media reviewers regarded Sterling&#x27;s works highly (&quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;: &quot;There is no doubt at all about the genius of George Sterling&quot;; &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;[Ambrose] Bierce has been hailing Mr. Sterling for some years past as the greatest poet on this side of the Atlantic … Mr. Bierce&#x27;s hail seems likely to be justified&quot;). Sterling&#x27;s works were admired by such prominent writers as Jack London (&quot;the greatest living poet in the United States&quot;), Upton Sinclair (&quot;His work possess the qualities of the greatest poetry: sublimity of thought, intensity of emotion, enchanting melody, and severe and reverent workmanship&quot;), Theodore Dreiser (&quot;The ranking American poet, greater than any we have thus far produced&quot;), and H. L. Mencken (&quot;He was one of our greatest poets. … I had tremendous respect for his work and an admiration for his style&quot;).

Sterling wrote about a vast variety of topics in different poetic styles that evolved throughout his writing career.

===Poet in training, 1896-1901===
At age 26, San Francisco business executive George Sterling became obsessed with a new passion. He wanted to write serious poetry inspired by his poetic heroes such as John Keats and Edgar Allan Poe. Sterling wrote his first poems after his February 1896 marriage. He knew eminent literary critic Ambrose Bierce and asked permission to send him poems for evaluation. Bierce replied: &quot;Of course you may send me verses—a bellyful if you like.&quot; Sterling mailed Bierce dozens of poems and Bierce replied with detailed, precise comments.

Bierce appreciated one Sterling poem enough to include it in his February 21, 1897 &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; column. The poem, &quot;Farewell,&quot; reflected on a dead friend&#x27;s passing and the absence or presence of an afterlife. It was Sterling&#x27;s first appearance in print. For the next thirteen years Bierce continued to review and comment on Sterling&#x27;s poems, teaching his protégé poetic skills and shaping his artistic preferences. Between 1897 and 1901, Sterling wrote many poems but, usually dissatisfied, let only a handful become published.

===Bierce&#x27;s protégé, 1901-1910===
On April 11, 1901, Sterling mailed a new poem titled &quot;Memorial Day, 1901&quot; to Bierce for criticism. His mentor responded, &quot;It is great—great!—the loftiest note that you have struck and &quot;held&quot;.&quot; Bierce arranged for the &quot;Washington Post&quot; to publish the poem and wrote a preface explaining that though Sterling was a new poet, &quot;he has written a considerable body of verse. Not all of it has the strength, fire, and elevation of the remarkable poem printed here, but none has been delinquent in the matter of &#x27;that something other than the sense&#x27; which distinguishes poetry from mere verse. George Sterling is a poet, and a great one—one may safely stake on that all the reputation for literary judgment that one may hope to have.&quot; The appearance of &quot;Memorial Day, 1901&quot; in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; was Sterling&#x27;s first publication of a major poem. It marked his entry into a new stage of development as a writer. After five years writing practice poems, Sterling at age 31 determined to become a writer of serious, elevated verse.
Sterling loved astronomy because &quot;my dear dead father was greatly interested in it, and I&#x27;ve spent many hours on the house-top with him and his telescope.&quot; He marveled at planets, stars, and galaxies—apparently resting in peace but actually slowly and endlessly colliding with and destroying each other. Sometime after December 16, 1901, Sterling began a long poem depicting the galaxies and stars of &quot;the stellar universe at strife, when to the eye it is a symbol of such peace and changelessness … It surely is a war if the cosmic processes are viewed as a whole.&quot; The long poem, &quot;The Testimony of the Suns,&quot; is a lengthy astronomical poem that combines elements of science, fantasy, science fiction, and philosophy. Literary historian S. T. Joshi called it Sterling&#x27;s &quot;longest poem and one of his greatest.&quot;

The unusual poem was too long for magazines and was rejected by book publishers, so in 1903 Sterling self-published it in his first book, &quot;The Testimony of the Suns and Other Poems&quot;. When his book was released, Sterling&#x27;s poems had been published in newspapers and magazines for seven years, but &quot;The Testimony of the Suns&quot; marked the first time Sterling&#x27;s poetry attracted nationwide attention from critics. The &quot;New York Times&quot; said Sterling&#x27;s poetry has &quot;the note of character that promises permanence.&quot; &quot;Book News Monthly&quot; said his book &quot;in every part rings true to the nature of man. The poems are often of great lyrical beauty and always have some music to them.&quot; &quot;Impressions Quarterly&quot; began its review: &quot;A poet of the first magnitude has risen.&quot; &quot;There is no doubt at all about the genius of George Sterling,&quot; proclaimed the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;. The nationwide critical success of &quot;The Testimony of the Suns&quot; established Sterling&#x27;s career as a poet.

On August 18, 1905 Sterling and his wife Carrie moved from Piedmont, California to Carmel-by-the-Sea. In December the Bohemian Club asked Sterling to write a play for its 1906 Midsummer Jinks. Sterling wrote the first half in one day. By December 17, he had almost finished a first draft of his entire verse play. He took it to the Bohemian Club members responsible for the Jinks. After months of extensive changes, they agreed to stage Sterling&#x27;s fantasy as the Club&#x27;s 1906 summer presentation. However, in 1906 everything changed. The April 18, 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire burned Alexander Robertson&#x27;s bookstore to the ground. All but 200 copies of the second edition of &quot;The Testimony of the Suns and Other Poems&quot; were destroyed.

Earthquake destruction meant the Bohemian Club could not prepare Sterling&#x27;s play &quot;The Triumph of Bohemia: A Forest Play&quot;, so the Club postponed it a year to the night of July 27, 1907. That night after dark about 600 Bohemian Club members gathered on log benches in Bohemian Grove, the Club&#x27;s private redwood forest. Slowly, stage lights imitating moonbeams faded in, causing figures on the Grove&#x27;s large stage to become discernible as sleeping tree-spirits. The play&#x27;s story pitted tree-spirits and their trees against the efforts of winds, time, fire, lumberjacks, and Mammon (greed) to destroy their forest. The trees are saved by an immense owl—the mascot of the Bohemian Club—and by the Spirit of Bohemia. The Bohemian Club printed copies of &quot;The Triumph of Bohemia &quot;for its members. &quot;The climax of this year&#x27;s play left the audience in an awed silence which most playwrights would give years of their lives to win from a professional audience,&quot; enthused a two-page review in &quot;Collier&#x27;s: The National Weekly&quot;.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported: &quot;The people who saw it described it as being wonderful beyond words.&quot;
In January 1904, Sterling had sent Bierce another long poem, &quot;A Wine of Wizardry.&quot; When Bierce read the poem, he thrilled: &quot;And the poem! I hardly know how to speak of it. No poem in English of equal length has so bewildering a wealth of imagination. Not Spenser himself has flung such a profusion of pearls into so small a casket. Why, man, it takes away the breath!&quot; When &quot;A Wine of Wizardry&quot; was first published in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine in 1907 with an afterword by Bierce it stimulated a nationwide controversy. It was both critically praised and condemned. The poem was reprinted in Sterling&#x27;s 1908 collection &quot;A Wine of Wizardry and Other Poems&quot;. It was reprinted again several times, and has been imitated and parodied by many writers. The poem inspired Clark Ashton Smith to become a poet and influenced other writers as well.

By late 1907, Sterling was notorious due to the &quot;Wine of Wizardry&quot; furor, so he found it easier to sell his verses to magazines. Leading national magazines such as &quot;The American Magazine&quot;, &quot;Bookman&quot;, &quot;Century Magazine&quot;, &quot;Current Literature&quot;, &quot;Literary Digest&quot;, and &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; bought his poems. Dozens of newspapers reprinted his verses.

===&quot;More human&quot; poems and first fiction, 1910-1916===
In 1910 and 1911, Sterling began to consciously evolve his style and subjects. &quot;I&#x27;m trying to become somewhat more human [in poetry]!&quot; he wrote to poet Witter Bynner &quot;It&#x27;s not so easy as I had fifteen years&#x27; start [1896-1910] in the wrong direction.&quot;

In 1911, Alexander Robertson published Sterling&#x27;s third collection of verses, &quot;The House of Orchids and Other Poems&quot;. It sold more copies than his prior two volumes, and also generated his best reviews to date. The &quot;New York Times&quot; said: &quot;In his new book … Mr. Sterling has added to his earlier unusual qualities of imagination and of expression the restraint needed to make them truly effective. … One could quote from it an hundred lines of exceptional beauty. … Mr. Bierce has been hailing Mr. Sterling for some years past as the greatest poet on this side of the Atlantic. Mr. Bierce&#x27;s hail seems likely to be justified.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;The undeniable merits of the majority of the poems in &quot;The House of Orchids&quot; make the book an important addition to America&#x27;s modern poetic literature. Sterling has a rare perception of that thing which we call Beauty. And he possesses, also, the literary sense which results in that inevitable just-a-position of words which no amount of study can bring about, and which always distinguishes the genius from the philistine.&quot;
&quot;The Black Vulture,&quot; a sonnet from &quot;The House of Orchids&quot;, was cited by Thomas E. Benediktsson in his book &quot;George Sterling&quot; as &quot;a sonnet which became Sterling&#x27;s most consistently praised and most anthologized poem.&quot; Poet and critic William Rose Benét wrote: &quot;As for &#x27;The Black Vulture,&#x27; I think it is one of the finest sonnets in the language.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; said: &quot;No finer sonnet has been written for many a day.&quot; In &quot;American Literature&quot;, professor Robert G. Berkelman called it &quot;one of Sterling&#x27;s most enduring achievements and certainly among the memorable sonnets in our literature.&quot; After the poem&#x27;s first book publication in 1911, reprints of &quot;The Black Vulture&quot; in newspapers, magazines, and books have kept it almost continually in print for more than a hundred years.

The years 1912 and 1913 saw a burst of productivity from Sterling. His poems appeared in national publications &quot;American Magazine&quot;, &quot;Bookman&quot;, &quot;Century&quot;, &quot;Current Opinion&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot;, &quot;North American Review&quot;, &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and other magazines, and were reprinted by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and other newspapers across the country. In 1912 a nationwide contest had been announced, offering large cash prizes for what judges chose as the three best poems published in a newspaper or magazine during 1912 but not published in any book. Sterling submitted an ode to Robert Browning, and out of hundreds of poets who entered, won second place. He received a cash award of almost $8,000 in today&#x27;s money. Even with many sales of his verses, Sterling was dissatisfied by how little money his poems earned. In January 1913 he began writing short fiction. &quot;Finished my first short-story, &#x27;Mr. Easton &amp; the Dryad!&#x27;&quot; he wrote in his diary.

Meanwhile, Sterling sold his poetry for the first time to the prestigious magazine &quot;The Smart Set&quot;, one of the most irreverent and influential literary magazines of its time. &quot;The Smart Set&quot;&#x27;s prominence grew thanks to its two editors, H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan. Mencken, first as editor of &quot;Smart Set&quot; and later of &quot;American Mercury&quot;, became Sterling&#x27;s best customer, buying more of his poetry and prose than any other editor. Mencken became much more than just a buyer to Sterling; the two men would be frequent pen pals, they would visit in person in New York and San Francisco, and Mencken would be indirectly involved in Sterling&#x27;s suicide.

Harmon Bell, the founding president of the Oakland Commercial Club, conceived of a joint task force linking all industries and city governments around the entire San Francisco Bay to attract businesses to the Bay Area. Bell persuaded 400 leading businessmen and politicians from all major Bay Area cities to gather at a banquet announcing his new organization. He wanted the event to rouse and enthuse his attendees. Henry Anderson Lafler and George Sterling were hired to write an inspiring musical play. At Bell&#x27;s banquet the night of April 7, 1913, their &quot;A Masque of the Cities&quot; was performed and by all accounts was a success. Newspapers gave glowing reviews. Four papers printed the play. &quot;A Masque of the Cities&quot; was also printed using handset type on handmade paper as a keepsake edition.

The next month, Sterling scored a quieter triumph. His poem &quot;Willy Pitcher&quot; appeared in the June issue of &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, America&#x27;s most prestigious magazine.

Sterling wanted to write fiction about prehistoric people. He created two Stone-Age characters, a boy and a girl. He introduced them as 10-year-old cave kids, then worked them through a series of six stories as they grew into a young man and woman. &quot;Their adventures are more interesting and better told than [Edgar Rice] Burroughs, and more believable, too. All are good,&quot; proclaimed &quot;Fantasy Commentator&quot;. Sterling spiced paragraphs with the rhythms and vividness of verse: &quot;Then silence leaped in upon sound like water above a cast pebble, and the forest resumed its dream.&quot; He finished his six stories and mailed his prehistoric series to magazine publishers. Most turned down his cavekids tales. Sterling could sell them only to &quot;Popular Magazine&quot;, a pulp fiction &quot;rag.&quot; The series title was &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;. It was the only longer piece of fiction by Sterling ever published.

At the end of 1913, critic William Stanley Braithwaite named Sterling&#x27;s &quot;Night Sentries&quot; one of the best poems of the year.

Because Carrie Sterling divorced him, Sterling left Carmel, California on April 13, 1914 and moved to New York City. He hoped to sell poems and stories to New York publishers. He met a few friends in New York, but did not sell many poems or stories. On May 30, he moved to Sag Harbor, New York for the summer, writing either a thousand words of fiction or a complete poem every morning and swimming most afternoons. Writer James Hopper lined Sterling up with a literary agent to sell his fiction.

While Sterling visited Sag Harbor, Alexander Robertson published his newest book, &quot;Beyond the Breakers and Other Poems&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated: &quot;There is strength as well as grace in his verse, a richness of metaphor and simile, and seldom a weak line—never a careless one. His blank verse has no equal among his contemporaries.&quot; Poet Joyce Kilmer, in &quot;Literary Digest&quot;, decided: &quot;By writing &#x27;[A] Wine of Wizardry&#x27; and &#x27;The Black Vulture,&#x27; George Sterling earned the gratitude of all lovers of poetry. And unlike most poets who suddenly become famous, he has steadily gained power. His new book, &quot;Beyond the Breakers and Other Poems&quot;, is better than any of the three distinguished volumes that preceded it.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; differed: &quot;&quot;Beyond the Breakers&quot; does not contain so much verse of unusual beauty as his previous volume, [&quot;The&quot;] &quot;House of Orchids,&quot; but it maintains a high average.&quot;

In February 1914 Sterling had written a short play, &quot;The Flight&quot;, for Bay Area social club the Family to present in the summer. When the members of the Family club held their annual summer gathering, Sterling&#x27;s &quot;The Flight&quot;, with music by Cass Downing, was a high point. &quot;So enthusiastic were the clubmen over this little drama that they immediately wired to Sterling at Sag Harbor, Long Island, informing him in all sincerity that it was the most beautiful play that had ever been given in the club&#x27;s history.&quot;

In autumn Sterling moved from Sag Harbor back to New York City with about 75 newly-written poems (most about the Great War) and fifteen stories. He sold a few to magazines, but only for low prices. In spite of Sterling knocking on New York editors&#x27; doors during 1914, the national magazines that bought his poems were mostly publications he&#x27;d already sold to in prior years. Sterling&#x27;s lack of an established reputation with East Coast editors crippled his ability to sell to other magazines. His new year looked bleak in New York.

In San Francisco, however, the new year made most people feel eager. Their biggest anticipation was the 1915 World&#x27;s Fair, which would be held in the city to celebrate both the Panama Canal&#x27;s opening and San Francisco&#x27;s recovery from the 1906 earthquake and fire. The Panama-Pacific International Exposition was scheduled to begin February 20, 1915. That January, the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; commissioned Sterling to write an ode commemorating the opening of the exposition. Sterling&#x27;s long poem was printed in the &quot;Examiner&quot;, read at the exposition&#x27;s opening ceremony, excerpted by magazines and books, and in November, published by Alexander Robertson as a 525-copy hardcover limited edition on handmade paper. The &quot;Examiner&quot; paid Sterling the equivalent of $4,100 for his ode, more than he earned from his entire summer of work in New York. Sterling missed California and his family and friends there. On April 15, 1915, he left New York City to return to San Francisco, arriving May 1.

In July Sterling wrote a long poem about Yosemite National Park and sold it to the &quot;San Francisco Call and Post&quot;. In October, Alexander Robertson published &quot;Yosemite: An Ode&quot; as a book.

That month Sterling wrote his second poem about the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. This time he described the beauty of the fair&#x27;s buildings at sunset and reflected how such temporary glory will quickly fade. &quot;Sunset&quot; magazine printed his poem. Alexander Robertson rushed a book version into print in December, in time for the Exposition&#x27;s last few days. &quot;The Evanescent City&quot; sold out its 4,000-copy first printing as well as a 1,000-copy second printing, one of the two best-selling volumes Sterling ever wrote. With Sterling focusing in 1915 on his Californian successes, he sold poems to only nine national magazines that year.

===Playwright poet, 1916-1921===
Sterling&#x27;s fifth collection of poetry, &quot;The Caged Eagle and Other Poems&quot;, was published in July 1916 by A. M. Robertson. His new poetry collection was not reviewed as widely as his prior books. The most passionate review came from William Stanley Braithwaite in the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;: &quot;However he may express himself in strictly conventionalized forms, they do not seem to impede the really immense scope of his imagination. … it is of particular importance to note that his whole spiritual temper is made significant by the unusual quality this large power has upon his nature. I seem to feel this subtle sense of largeness, it may be spirit or vision or dream, in all that Mr. Sterling writes.&quot; Elsewhere in Boston, the &quot;Transcript&quot;&#x27;s competitor the &quot;Boston Post&quot; was more matter-of-fact: &quot;In &quot;The Caged Eagle and Other Poems&quot;, George Sterling, a deservedly well known California poet, is certain to gratify those who have had the good fortune to read his earlier volumes. And the 50 poems on the war, all but one of them sonnets, will insure him a welcome to many new readers, although they will not endear him to German-Americans.&quot; The most unexpected review of &quot;The Caged Eagle and Other Poems&quot; came from former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt, who on July 14, excited by the book&#x27;s pro-war poems, wrote a letter to Sterling beginning: &quot;Three cheers for the unneutral sonnets!&quot;

1916 was a good year for Sterling in terms of the quantity of national magazines publishing his poetry: &quot;Ainslee&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Art World&quot;, &quot;Bellman&quot;, &quot;Bookman&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Current Opinion&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, &quot;Literary Digest&quot;, &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Munsey&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Pearson&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Poetry Journal&quot;, even the staid &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;. The last days of 1916 saw a different kind of Sterling publication: a songbook &quot;Songs&quot; by George Sterling had music by Lawrence Zenda. Zenda was the pen name of Mrs. Rosaliene Reed Travis, one of Sterling&#x27;s lovers.
When &quot;Songs&quot; was published, Sterling was in Los Angeles working on a play. &quot;The Play of Everyman&quot; is his adaptation of Austrian writer Hugo von Hofmannsthal&#x27;s German play &quot;Jedermann&quot;. Lavish productions of Sterling&#x27;s &quot;The Play of Everyman&quot; in 1917 and 1936 were acclaimed by critics and boosted the careers of people involved. Sterling&#x27;s adaptation was also staged in 1941 in New York City.

For months Sterling had called for the United States to join the Great War to support the Allies. Congress voted for the U.S. to enter World War I on April 6, 1917. Sterling joined a pro-war group of writers called the Vigilantes, pledging to write pieces to support Allied efforts. At Alexander Robertson&#x27;s request, Sterling gathered 28 of his war poems for a new book, &quot;The Binding of the Beast and Other War Verse&quot;. It was published in time for Christmas 1917. Sterling warned Clark Ashton Smith: &quot;My little book of war-verse is out … it&#x27;s verse and not poetry.&quot;

At the end of 1917, Sterling&#x27;s poem &quot;The Glass of Time,&quot; about reflections in a lake at Jack London&#x27;s Beauty Ranch, was chosen one of the best poems of the year.

Back in 1916, Bohemian Club managers had told Sterling they wanted him to write the Club&#x27;s grove play for 1918. In early 1918 he finished the play&#x27;s song lyrics. The name of Sterling&#x27;s anti-dictatorship musical drama was &quot;The Twilight of the Kings&quot; (with Richard Hotaling and [uncredited] Porter Garnett; music by Wallace A. Sabin). It was a science fiction allegory of World War I, but set in medieval times, with a prince inventing the superweapon gunpowder and suffering its consequences. As with other Bohemian Club Jinks spectacles, the full play was performed only once, on August 3, 1918. The magazine &quot;Musical America&quot; called it &quot;a play affording broadly laid out and well characterized scenes, and … dignified and often impressive literary expression. The lyrics of the play … are by that conjurer of the beautiful, George Sterling … A &#x27;Peace Song,&#x27; sung by one of the princes in the play, recommended itself very particularly; it is one of the choicest moments of the work.&quot; &quot;Musical America&quot;&#x27;s national competitor &quot;Musical Courier&quot; agreed &quot;the play has much literary value. As to the dramatic side, it is in many passages splendid. … This is a deeply impressive prophetic drama.&quot; The other national magazine for professional musicians, &quot;Musical Leader&quot;, concluded its review: &quot;The sentiment expressed in the masque and its pictureful presentation made this one of the banner years in the history of the club.&quot; On August 15, &quot;The Twilight of the Kings&quot; was staged in a concert version in San Francisco, with actor Richard Hotaling narrating the action and reading dialog, and professional singers performing the songs. &quot;Jerome Uhl [a bass-baritone with New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera] made a tremendous hit performing the drinking song,&quot; reported &quot;Musical Courier&quot;. The audience stopped the performance with applause and cheering and made Uhl sing the song again.
Sterling wrote &quot;Lilith: A Dramatic Poem&quot;, a four-act fantasy verse drama from 1904 to 1918. The play was first published in 1919. Influential critic H. L. Mencken said of Sterling: &quot;I think his dramatic poem &quot;Lilith&quot; was the greatest thing he ever wrote.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; declared &quot;Lilith&quot; &quot;the finest thing in poetic drama yet done in America and one of the finest poetic dramas yet written in English.&quot; Author Theodore Dreiser said: &quot;It rings richer in thought than any American dramatic poem with which I am familiar.&quot; Poet Clark Ashton Smith wrote: &quot;&quot;Lilith&quot; is certainly the best dramatic poem in English since the days of Swinburne and Browning. … The lyrics interspersed throughout the drama are as beautiful as any by the Elizabethans.&quot; In his book &quot;George Sterling&quot;, Thomas E. Benediktsson stated: &quot;The allegorical &quot;Lilith&quot; is undoubtedly Sterling&#x27;s best poem.&quot;

On March 23, 1920, Sterling announced he had finished the first draft of a historical play, &quot;Rosamund&quot;. He finished the final draft on April 15, telling H. L. Mencken, &quot;I&#x27;ve finished my dramatic poem, &quot;Rosamund&quot;. It contains one rape and four murders—quite Shakespearean.&quot; Sterling found Princess Rosamund&#x27;s story in chapter 45 of &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; by Edward Gibbons. In 567 A.D., Alboin, king of the Lombards, killed the Gepid king Cunimund. King Alboin raped Cunimund&#x27;s daughter Princess Rosamund, then forced her to marry him and become his queen. In 572 A.D., Queen Rosamund avenged her father by assassinating her husband King Alboin. Sterling self-published 500 numbered, hand-signed copies of &quot;Rosamund: A Dramatic Poem&quot;. The &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; summed it up: &quot;The story of the princess who was thrown into a world of fighting and lustful men, who was most grievously wronged and who became thereafter an avenger who used her beauty and her love as her weapons, is one that is filled with intense dramatic possibility and as told by Sterling has a tremendous emotional appeal, a noble rhythm, and a tragic atmosphere comparable to that of &quot;Macbeth&quot;.&quot; After reading the play, Clark Ashton Smith wrote to Sterling: &quot;My congratulations on &quot;Rosamund&quot;! As you warned me, it lacks the poetic beauty of &quot;Lilith&quot;; but nevertheless, it is a great drama. What action! It should make a tremendous &#x27;film&#x27;, if you don&#x27;t mind my saying so; I don&#x27;t mean that as a slam, in any sense.&quot;

Outside of &quot;Rosamund&quot;, Sterling had little published in 1920. That year, just four national magazines printed his poems. However, a local newspaper poem was a hit. Sterling&#x27;s &quot;The Cool, Grey City of Love (San Francisco),&quot; gave San Francisco its most popular nickname. The poem was reprinted many times, both in publications and as stand-alone collectables.

===Simple, clear poems, 1921-1926===
As if to make up for his scant 1920 output, during 1921 Sterling placed 15 poems in seven national magazines. The poems he wrote in 1921 rarely used old-fashioned words such as &quot;thee&quot; or &quot;thou&quot; to sound &quot;poetical&quot; as many of his earlier poems did; instead, most of his new poems used only contemporary words. In June Sterling&#x27;s poem &quot;To a Girl Dancing&quot; was published as a limited edition of 120 elegantly designed hardcover books by the Grabhorn Press, one of the most esteemed fine presses in America. That September Sterling accomplished an unusual literary feat: Charles Brennan, a defense attorney for movie star Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle&#x27;s rape and murder trial, hired Sterling to &quot;prepare the epigrams for the speech of defense.&quot;

Alexander Robertson published Sterling&#x27;s newest collection of poems in December 1921: &quot;Sails and Mirage and Other Poems&quot;. Of the 61 poems in this anthology, only 22 were new in 1921. The majority were older. Differences in Sterling&#x27;s newer poems were noticed by some reviewers. The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; pointed out: &quot;In &quot;Sails and Mirage&quot;, I believe, we have Sterling&#x27;s choicest work; certainly his most keenly human. … Sterling in the past was too prone, one feels, to hurl suns and meteors and satellites about his finely-chiseled Dantesque head. … This gesture in the grand manner is in &quot;Sails and Mirage&quot; admirably subdued, and Sterling&#x27;s genuine gift for lyricism … issues forth with a pleasing klang for the sensitive ear and the active imagination.&quot; In the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;, poet William Rose Benet remarked on the tenderness and wistfulness of the poems, different from Sterling&#x27;s earlier echoes of Milton&#x27;s &quot;mighty line.&quot; &quot;Bookman&quot;, a leading publication for the book business, called Sterling&#x27;s book &quot;an uncanny, bitter, and very touching conflict between passionate longing for beauty and angry resentment at the ugliness of life.&quot; Sterling himself thought he still had a way to go to make his poems feel modern. Of &quot;Sails and Mirage and Other Poems&quot;, he said: &quot;It&#x27;s my best book, but almost as mid-Victorian as the others!&quot;

Sterling&#x27;s two major literary accomplishments of 1922 were both editorial projects. He began work on the first project in January, a book for the Book Club of California: &quot;The Letters of Ambrose Bierce&quot;. He selected the book&#x27;s contents. He reviewed each letter and deleted unfavorable references to living people and passages he felt made Bierce look bad. He helped the Book Club&#x27;s secretary, Bertha Clark Pope write an introduction, and himself wrote &quot;A Memoir of Ambrose Bierce&quot; for the book. Sterling proofread the galleys and the printer&#x27;s proofs, keeping involved through September. Sterling often gave credit for his own work to someone else, and here gave Bertha Pope sole credit as editor, keeping his name only as author of &quot;A Memoir.&quot; H. L. Mencken reviewed the book&#x27; in &quot;Smart Set&quot; as &quot;the most important contribution to Bierceiana made since Bierce&#x27;s death. The letters are well selected, and Sterling&#x27;s memoir and Mrs. Pope&#x27;s introduction are very well turned out.&quot; Thirty-six years later, historian David Magee called &quot;The Letters of Ambrose Bierce&quot; &quot;A most ambitious project and, aside from Cowan&#x27;s &quot;Bibliography&quot; [&quot;of the History of California and the Pacific West&quot;], the most important publication in the [Book] Club&#x27;s first decade.&quot;

Sterling&#x27;s second 1922 editorial project was his own book, &quot;Selected Poems&quot;. New York publisher Henry Holt and Company told Sterling the company wanted to publish a collection of Sterling&#x27;s poetry. He went through five of his earlier books and selected 56 poems. He made more than a hundred changes to the texts of the poems. Many were modernizations; he changed &quot;thy&quot; to &quot;your,&quot; &quot;thine&quot; to &quot;yours,&quot; &quot;thou art&quot; to &quot;you are,&quot; and &quot;hath&quot; to &quot;had&quot; or &quot;has.&quot; Critic Harriet Monroe had complained Sterling&#x27;s use of &quot;deems&quot; was &quot;the frippery of a by-gone fashion.&quot; Sterling now replaced &quot;deems&quot; with &quot;thinks&quot; or &quot;dreams.&quot; These changes echo the contemporary vocabulary of Sterling&#x27;s new poems, and the advice he currently gave his protégés, such as telling poet Clark Ashton Smith to avoid the word &quot;enfraught&quot; because it &quot;seems too artificial,&quot; and to revise a phrase because it &quot;sounds forced, obscure, and unnatural.&quot; Sterling sent Henry Holt and Company the manuscript of &quot;Selected Poems&quot; in May.

During 1922, Sterling&#x27;s poem &quot;Pumas&quot; attracted notable responses. &quot;Pumas&quot; was first published in the &quot;New York Evening Post Literary Review&quot;, then reprinted in the national magazine &quot;Literary Digest&quot;, (which said: &quot;Sterling is California&#x27;s leading poet, and judged by this his leadership extends much wider&quot;), next reprinted in another national magazine, and finally selected by an anthology editor as one of the best poems of the year.

The Bookfellows, a Chicago-based national organization of 3,000 booklovers and authors, announced April 28, 1923 Sterling&#x27;s sonnet &quot;Shelley at Spezia&quot; had won the association&#x27;s Kemnitz Prize for the best poem of the year.

The next month Sterling&#x27;s &quot;Selected Poems&quot; was published. It contained mostly his older poems. Reviews were mixed. The &quot;New York Times&quot; said &quot;Selected Poems&quot; &quot;contains a deal of beautiful albeit classical work. Some of it, to be sure, is on the cosmic order, but even here when Mr. Sterling is good he is very, very good. … Mr. Sterling is particularly successful in the sonnet form and one has only to note &#x27;The Dust Dethroned&#x27; (which fairly claims consideration with Shelley&#x27;s &#x27;Ozymandias&#x27;) and &#x27;The Black Vulture&#x27; to see how surely the poet handles this difficult form. His poems in regular forms often touch a real beauty, but the book taken as a whole fails really to stir the reader. Perhaps one reason for this is that Mr. Sterling is rather out of touch with his time.&quot; &quot;Outlook&quot; magazine disagreed: &quot;It is poetry &#x27;in the grand manner,&#x27; concerned with life and death and destiny and the mystery of the universe. … In profuse imagination and profound music George Sterling&#x27;s poetry is always richly endowed, and his followers will find in this volume poems that have won a place for themselves with these qualities.&quot; The &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; decided: &quot;he sings best of the sea and of the stars. &#x27;Beyond the Breakers&#x27; is a swimmer&#x27;s poem as thrilling as one of Swinburne&#x27;s. &#x27;Aldebaran at Dusk&#x27; is wholly beautiful.&quot; In Ontario, Canada, the &quot;Border Cities Star&quot; said: &quot;Only a few of these poems are excellent, but they alone, by their compression, form, and harmony, justify the collection.&quot; Poet John Gould Fletcher wrote a long negative review in &quot;Freeman&quot; magazine: &quot;Mr. Sterling, at his best in certain sonnets, and in his overpretentious &quot;Testimony of the Suns,&quot; is about as good as de Heredia or Fitzgerald: that is to say, a minor Frenchman or a minor Englishman. At his worst, in &quot;A Wine of Wizardry,&quot; he is sheer drivel: &quot;Endymion&quot; or &quot;The Witch of Atlas&quot; gone to pieces.&quot; Fletcher concluded that what &quot;Keats saw, Mr. Sterling can not see, and therefore he has remained purblind—a versifier lavishing his craft on subjects beneath the dignity of a true poet.&quot; &quot;Poetry: A Magazine of Verse&quot; ran a one-sentence dismissal ending: &quot;his talent has been overshadowed by latecomers.&quot;

By June 1923 Sterling was working on a third editing project: The Book Club of California recruited him to join poets Genevieve Taggard and James Rorty to collect an anthology of poems from California&#x27;s best living poets. Work on the anthology would occupy Sterling&#x27;s time for more than a year.
Sterling wrote &quot;Truth,&quot; a verse drama telling a fantasy set in the imaginary medieval city of Vae, in 1921 and 1922. Chicago-based Bookfellows published &quot;Truth&quot; in 1923. Half a century later literary historian Thomas E. Benediktsson ranked &quot;Truth&quot; as &quot;one of Sterling&#x27;s finest works.&quot;

Sterling&#x27;s two poems &quot;The Fog-Sea&quot; and &quot;The Young Witch – 1698&quot; were both selected to appear in &quot;The Best Poems of 1923&quot;.

Sterling began 1924 in Hollywood, working on a project for movie star Douglas Fairbanks, who produced his own movies. In those days movies were silent, so words spoken by characters were conveyed to audiences by titles on the screen. Fairbanks was producing and starring in the spectacular action-fantasy &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;, and wanted Sterling to write more than 200 titles for the three-hour film. &quot;I get $25. a day [about $750 a day in today&#x27;s dollars] and my fare to and from S.F. Not bad for a poor poet,&quot; crowed Sterling. &quot;I have luncheon &#x27;on the lot&#x27; daily with Fairbanks and his wife (Mary Pickford),&quot; then the world&#x27;s most popular movie actress. Sterling also signed a contract with Fairbanks&#x27; company to create a book of songs about &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;, to be sold in movie theaters showing the movie. Sterling wrote lyrics (telling a newspaper reporter &quot;the public likes them mushy&quot;) and composer Mortimer Wilson wrote music, but no songbooks were printed.

Afterwards Sterling returned to work on the Book Club of California&#x27;s poetry anthology. Among other tasks, he wrote an introduction, &quot;From One Foothill,&quot; his defense of what he loved about poetry.

In 1924, fourteen Sterling poems were published in eleven national magazines. In addition, his poems were published in dozens of newspapers. That year Sterling&#x27;s poem &quot;The Flight&quot; was named best narrative poem of the past year by &quot;Lyric West&quot; magazine, which awarded Sterling a cash prize of $100 (about $3,000 in today&#x27;s money).

In 1925, the Book Club of California published &quot;Continent&#x27;s End: An Anthology of Contemporary California Poets&quot;, which Sterling had edited with Genevieve Taggard and James Rorty. Thirty-three years later, historian David Magee wrote: &quot;&quot;Continent&#x27;s End&quot; is a real contribution to California literature. It represents the best of the younger poets of the day, such as Robinson Jeffers, who might not otherwise have found a hearing for their poems.&quot; That year Sterling became poetry editor, book reviewer, and columnist for the magazine &quot;Overland Monthly&quot;. He used his position to promote several younger poets, beginning his first monthly column by praising Jeffers and Clark Ashton Smith.

During 1925 Sterling had more than 25 new poems published, seventeen of them in fourteen national magazines. One key poem Sterling wrote in 1925 was not published until 1926. He spent months writing his long poem &quot;The Pathfinders&quot; in free verse—an unusual choice for Sterling, who had hated free verse poetry until he read and loved Robinson Jeffers&#x27; free verse. Sterling sent &quot;The Pathfinders&quot; to H. L. Mencken, writing &quot;This is probably the best thing I ever wrote, and I&#x27;m sending it to you first, hoping you&#x27;ll like it.&quot; Mencken responded enthusiastically: &quot;I think you are quite right. &#x27;The Pathfinders&#x27; is an eloquent and excellent piece of writing and I shall put it into type at once.&quot; When &quot;American Mercury&quot; published the poem, Sterling received a letter from Edgar Lee Masters, who after the publication of his best-selling book &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; had become one of America&#x27;s best-known poets. Masters said: &quot;Last night I got a &quot;Mercury&quot; and read your poem &#x27;The Pathfinders.&#x27; It is superb. It is a great symphony. … Such lines as these are of imagination all compact … The last line is a peak. I congratulate you most heartily.&quot;
Sterling&#x27;s biggest production in 1926 was a play. He completely rewrote his 1923 play &quot;Truth,&quot; transforming it into the Bohemian Club&#x27;s summer 1926 stage spectacle. Its cast of 173 actors and extras, 27 dancers, and a choir of about thirty boy singers from Grace Cathedral, filled Bohemian Grove&#x27;s mammoth stage. 58 San Francisco Symphony musicians performed music written and conducted by Domenico Brescia.

===Posthumously published works===
When Sterling died November 17, 1926, he left behind many uncollected or unpublished works: dozens of essays, &quot;seventy-odd short stories,&quot; and hundreds of poems most readers had never seen.

Sterling&#x27;s first posthumous book was at the publishers when he died. Knopf published Sterling&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Jeffers: The Man and the Artist&quot;—the first book about poet Jeffers—in December, 1926, days after Sterling&#x27;s death. The Occidental College Library&#x27;s online exhibit on Jeffers says: &quot;George Sterling&#x27;s book launched Jeffers career as a popular poet. This book represented the passing of the unofficial position of California&#x27;s leading poet from Sterling to the young Jeffers.&quot;

Two years later, author Upton Sinclair published &quot;Sonnets to Craig&quot;, a collection of 102 poems Sterling had written in 1911-1912 to Sinclair&#x27;s wife, the writer Mary Craig Sinclair. That same year 1928, a new edition of &quot;Songs&quot; by Sterling and with music by &quot;Lawrence Zenda&quot; (the pseudonym of Sterling&#x27;s lover Mrs. Rosaliene Reed Travis) was published with five songs with lyrics by Sterling not in the prior two editions of &quot;Songs&quot;. Ten years after that, in 1938, Oxford University Press published &quot;Poems to Vera&quot;, 24 poems Sterling had written in 1910 to Vera Connolly, his young lover in Carmel who later became a &quot;crusading journalist—a stirrer-upper.&quot;

The next year R. H. Barlow gathered 43 of Sterling&#x27;s uncollected poems in the anthology &quot;After Sunset&quot;. All but three of those poems were written from 1921 through 1926, making &quot;After Sunset&quot; even now 85 years later the only Sterling collection focused on the more modern poems Sterling wrote in his final years. Because &quot;After Sunset&quot; was published in a tiny quantity by a bookstore lacking resources to publicize the book, few scholars were aware of it. Therefore, literary critics focused on Sterling&#x27;s earlier volumes, unconscious of most writings from Sterling&#x27;s prolific last six years. Thomas Benediktsson, for his 1980 book &quot;George Sterling&quot;, did read &quot;After Sunset&quot;, but mistakenly assumed that that 43-poem collection contained Sterling&#x27;s entire &quot;body of uncollected verse,&quot; unaware of more than five hundred additional uncollected poems written by Sterling.

The most important posthumous Sterling publication has been the 2013 three-volume set &quot;Complete Poetry&quot;, edited by S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz. The first two volumes present the contents of eleven volumes of Sterling&#x27;s poems and six verse dramas, plus notes about almost every poem. The third volume gathers 578 Sterling poems never published in a book before. Despite its title, &quot;Complete Poetry&quot; does not include all of Sterling&#x27;s verse compositions.

Sterling was a prolific and entertaining letter writer. Volumes of letters published to date include the Sterling-H. L Mencken correspondence, the Sterling-Clark Ashton Smith correspondence, and Sterling&#x27;s letters to his mentor Ambrose Bierce.

==Life and business career==

===Sag Harbor, New York; Ellicott City, Maryland; and New York City: 1869-1890===
George Augustine Sterling III was born December 1, 1869 in Sag Harbor on Long Island, New York. His father, Dr. George Augustine Sterling, Junior, M.D. (1843-1897), was a prosperous, deeply religious physician, the son of an Episcopal minister. The new mother, Mrs. Mary Havens Sterling (1845-1920), was the daughter of Captain Wickham Sayer Havens (1806-1880), a legendary whaler who retired rich and became a banker.

George III was the first of nine Sterling children. His best friend was Roosevelt &quot;Roose&quot; Johnson. Both were athletes—stronger than other boys—and passionate readers. George and Roose led a gang of Sag Harbor boys who called themselves the Night Hawks.

In 1886, George&#x27;s father shocked his Episcopal friends by converting to Roman Catholicism. Dr. Sterling wanted his three sons to become Roman Catholic priests, beginning with his oldest. High school graduate George agreed to enter a six-year seminary program at St. Charles College in Maryland. Sterling first seriously studied poetry there when he took an English composition and grammar class taught by Father John Bannister Tabb, a well-known poet. After three years of earning prizes as one of St. Charles&#x27; top students, Sterling decided not to become a priest and dropped out when the school year ended in summer 1889.

Dr. Sterling next pushed his now nineteen-year-old son to become a doctor. He sent George to New York City to study medicine at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the College of Physicians and Surgeons (now the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons). By early 1890, George decided medicine was not for him and came home.

In March 1890, his mother&#x27;s brother Frank C. Havens visited Sag Harbor to see his ailing mother Sarah Havens, George&#x27;s grandmother. Frank had left Sag Harbor as a boy and roamed the world, ending in San Francisco. There he founded the American Investment Union, its subsidiary the Home Accident Insurance Company of San Francisco, and other corporations. Frank Havens&#x27; growing companies needed trustworthy, intelligent employees. His nephew impressed him. Frank offered George an entry-level job, with a chance to work his way up, and gave George a first-class train ticket to Oakland. Sarah Havens died September 22. After her funeral, George took a train to California.

===Oakland, California: 1890-1898===
Twenty-year-old George Sterling arrived in Oakland, California the night of September 30, 1890. He moved into his uncle Frank&#x27;s estate near Oakland, Rosecrest, surrounded by the largest rose gardens in the west. Frank&#x27;s four sons lived there; their mother had died four years earlier. &quot;I arrived here at 8 o&#x27;clock one fine September evening,&quot; Sterling later recalled, &quot;and by 9 o&#x27;clock the next morning I was at work in the First National Bank building. It was my first job, and the first &#x27;real money&#x27; I ever made.&quot; He started as a bank clerk. He worked his way up to bookkeeper in Havens&#x27; headquarters on Sansome Street in San Francisco by the summer of 1891.

That year Sterling&#x27;s Sag Harbor friend Roosevelt Johnson persuaded his father to pay for a train ticket to join Sterling in California. While they lived in Sag Harbor, both men had admired the poems of Californian Joaquin Miller. Now Johnson persuaded Sterling to visit Miller&#x27;s nearby hilltop estate. There they met the elderly Miller and two young men, Carleton Bierce and Richard Partington, a British painter of portraits and landscapes. Sterling, Bierce, and Partington would remain friends for the rest of Sterling&#x27;s life, and Sterling would grow closer to Partington&#x27;s large family than any other except his own Sterling-Havens relatives. In the summer of 1892, on a campout at Lake Temescal Carleton Bierce introduced Sterling to Carleton&#x27;s uncle Ambrose Bierce, who four years later would change Sterling&#x27;s life.

In May 1895, Sterling began the cash book for Frank Havens&#x27; new Real Estate Combine. At its first board meeting on June 4, stockholders (Havens owned all but seven shares) elected Sterling as the new corporation&#x27;s Secretary-Treasurer and as a member of its board of directors.

On Sept. 5, 1895, Frank Havens incorporated a master holding company, the Realty Syndicate. The Syndicate was two-thirds owned by Francis Marion Smith and one-third by Havens, but Havens was president and ran the new corporation. George Sterling was one of the Realty Syndicate&#x27;s seven founding directors. The plan was for their new enterprise to build roads and public transit to the thousands of acres of raw land Havens, Smith, and their companies already owned, then sell tracts both to the public and to subdivision developers. The Realty Syndicate could provide financing to the developers to buy the land, and then finance their buyers&#x27; development: building the streets, sidewalks, streetcar lines, electricity lines, water mains, sewers, and houses to create saleable neighborhoods. It would also finance individual homebuyers&#x27; purchases of finished houses, and provide loans to any would-be-homeowner who bought a one-house lot if they wanted to build a home of their own. Sometimes the Realty Syndicate would develop subdivision neighborhoods itself, either selling ready-to-build lots or building homes on them. But the Syndicate&#x27;s main goals were to sell large tracts of land and to finance those purchases—all on a massive scale.

On February 7, 1896, Sterling married his private stenographer, Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; Eugenie Rand. The bride&#x27;s matron of honor was Richard Partington&#x27;s little sister&#x27; Katie Partington Peterson, and the groom&#x27;s best man was her husband, Fred Peterson. The newlyweds moved into a rented house at 1081 East 23rd Street in Oakland. Sterling&#x27;s father was seriously ill. Dr. Sterling sold his family home in Sag Harbor to Frank Havens and moved cross-country with George&#x27;s mother and six sisters into Havens&#x27; Rosecrest estate.

For weeks in 1897, George, his mother, and his six sisters watched his father writhe and scream in agony despite opiate painkillers. March 8, 1897, fifteen days after George&#x27;s first poem was published, he was in his father&#x27;s bedroom at Rosecrest while the doctor died from a &quot;stomach disorder,&quot; actually stomach cancer or an ulcerated stomach or both problems together. The effect of seeing his father tortured by intense, long-lasting physical pain—and the emotional agony suffered by his sisters and especially his mother—scarred George for life.

After Dr. Sterling died, his widow Mary (Frank Havens&#x27; sister) and her six daughters still lived at Havens&#x27; Rosecrest estate. Havens hired architect-builder W. Kirk to create a seven-room colonial-style home for them on a lot Havens owned in the unincorporated Piedmont Heights district. He would own the house, but Mary and her girls could live there rent-free.

As soon as her new home was built, Mrs. Mary Havens Sterling and the six Sterling sisters moved out of Frank Havens&#x27; Rosecrest estate and into their new home in Piedmont at 2083 Oakland Avenue. They weren&#x27;t the only ones who moved from Rosecrest to Piedmont: In November, Havens sold his Rosecrest estate and moved to Piedmont.

===Piedmont, California: 1898-1905===
In 1898, George and Carrie moved from Oakland to Piedmont to be closer to his mother and sisters. First the couple moved in with Frank and Lila Havens, four blocks from Mary Sterling and her daughters. Then George and Carrie rented a house even closer, at 2010 Oakland Avenue, across the street from the Sterling women. Before May 10, 1901, George and Carrie bought their Piedmont home from their landlord. They were now homeowners.

In 1901 Sterling&#x27;s first major poem was published in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and he met struggling writer Jack London, who became his best friend. When London met him, Sterling was the corporate secretary of both the Real Estate Combine and the Piedmont Development Company, the auditor of the Realty Syndicate, and a member of the boards of directors of the Realty Syndicate, the Oakland Transit Company and other corporations. London couldn&#x27;t make enough money to pay his rent in cash, so he squeezed himself, his wife, and their baby daughter into a friend&#x27;s small house in a poor section of Oakland where instead of paying rent they provided meals.

Sterling found a house for London and his wife Bess at below-market rent. &quot;Have a great view, now,&quot; London enthused, &quot;a clean sweep of the horizon—San Francisco across the bay, Goat, Angel, and Alcatraz islands, the Golden Gate and the Pacific to say nothing of the Contra Costa and Berkeley hills. Writing has not been up to much lately, but I should surely do good work here.&quot; The Londons&#x27; new home at 56 Bayo Vista Avenue was only 1.3 miles from the Sterlings house. In February 1902, Sterling found a bigger place for the Londons on Blair Avenue in Piedmont, even closer to the Sterling home. Sterling and London became the center of &quot;The Crowd,&quot; a group of writers, artists, and musicians in Oakland, Berkeley, and Piedmont.

In early 1903, Sterling was appointed vice president of the Real Estate Combine. Jack London finished a draft version of a new novel, and impressed by Sterling&#x27;s writing abilities, asked him to suggest improvements. London accepted most of Sterling&#x27;s suggestions, but the two men &quot;had arguments over one or two words.&quot; The Macmillan Company published London&#x27;s &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; in July. It was a huge international bestseller. London inscribed a copy of his novel to Sterling: &quot;From one who has felt for you sharper pangs of comradeship than any other man.&quot;

Tuesday, December 22, a new startup, the Piedmont Building Association, filed articles of incorporation with the Alameda County clerk. Sterling was one of five founding directors. Also that year Sterling self-published his first book, &quot;The Testimony of the Suns and Other Poems&quot;, which generated nationwide acclaim. He inscribed a copy: &quot;To our genius, Jack London. Here&#x27;s my book, my heart you have already.&quot;

In 1904 Sterling was named the Real Estate Combine&#x27;s chairman of the board. He was invited to join the Bohemian Club and worked to have the club admit Jack London as an honorary member. As the new year of 1904 began, London was frantically trying to finish a new novel, &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot;. William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s national chain of newspapers offered to pay London to travel to Japan, Korea, and China to report on the Russo-Japanese War, but only if London left the night of January 7. In the last hours before he boarded a ship, London finished a &quot;Sea-Wolf&quot; draft he considered good enough for magazine publication. Those editors always deleted paragraphs and changed texts, so London wouldn&#x27;t polish that draft. The book text he cared about very much, but he would be on the other side of the world, unable to work on it. London turned over his magazine draft to Sterling and London&#x27;s lover Charmian Kittredge, trusting them to combine that draft with London&#x27;s notes, any corrections spotted by the magazine editors, and Sterling&#x27;s and Kittredge&#x27;s own improvements to produce &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; book version while London was in Asia.

In October &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; was published. It became London&#x27;s second worldwide bestseller. Sterling&#x27;s contributions to the book version so impressed London that he gifted Sterling with &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot;&#x27;s original typescript. Afterwards London sent prepublication drafts of other books and stories to Sterling, &quot;his best critic,&quot; explained photographer Arnold Genthe, who knew both men well. &quot;Jack London in those days rarely gave a manuscript its final typing until he submitted the drafts to Sterling.&quot;

In the autumn of 1904 the Realty Syndicate and its managers—including Sterling—were attacked by a smear campaign in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;. Almost every day the Examiner printed stories accusing the Syndicate of defrauding investors, even though the Syndicate had always paid its loan and bond payments on time. On November 18, 1904, Sterling resigned as a director of the Syndicate—although he would remain its employee. He had been a director for nine years. That December, George also resigned from the board of Oakland Traction Consolidated. In January 1905, George stepped down as the Real Estate Combine&#x27;s chairman, but remained its vice president and a member of its board.

That January, a grand jury opened an investigation into the conduct of the Realty Syndicate and its officers. Then six investors sued Sterling and other Syndicate officers, accusing them of lying to defraud investors. In addition, the California State Senate opened an investigation of the Syndicate. The senators who opened the State Senate investigation were convicted of taking bribes from the &quot;Examiner&quot;, so their investigation was dropped. The lawsuit was also dropped. Eventually the months-long grand jury investigation found no evidence of any wrongdoing.

Sterling decided to quit his business career and become a full-time poet. He wanted to move out of the San Francisco Bay Area and its distractions. Carrie was reluctant to leave her family, friends, and active social life, but hoped going away might keep her husband from chasing other women. On March 4, 1905, they took a train to Monterey to investigate moving there. They were welcomed by Bohemian Club member Charles Rollo Peters, a landscape painter with a thirty-acre estate near Monterey. He showed them nearby sights, including a forested artists&#x27; colony, population 75, with white sand beaches. The village was named Carmel-by-the-Sea.

On March 30 Sterling announced to the press he &quot;will relinquish his connection with the Realty Syndicate and retire to private life&quot; in June. He said of Carmel, &quot;as beautiful as it is secluded, I expect to have the right sort of energy to give the world my best work.&quot;

===Carmel-by-the-Sea: 1905-1914===
On June 4, 1905, George and Carrie Sterling bought an acre of land in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, 114 miles south of Oakland. They also rented two additional acres, where they planned to grow their own vegetables. The Sterlings&#x27; lot sat on a hilltop in the Eighty Acres tract, on the east side of Torres Street between 10th Avenue and 11th Avenue. The Sterlings purchased the third lot after 10th Avenue.

On June 30, George began a diary: &quot;Arrived at Carmel: Geo. Sterling, W. E. Wood, R. L. [Richard] Partington. Fine weather. Put up small tent.&quot; The next day the men &quot;Put up large tent&quot; for them to live in while they prepared the site and built a house for the Sterlings. William E. Wood was in charge of construction. In Sterling&#x27;s words, &quot;Wood was a &#x27;boss carpenter&#x27; under his father, in Vancouver&quot;. He was a friend of Sterling and Partington; in fact, Dick Partington had once painted Wood&#x27;s portrait. Other Sterling friends arrived. Especially helpful was Sag Harbor pal Gene Fenlon, who had once worked as a circus strongman.

====George Sterling house====
The Sterlings&#x27; American Craftsman bungalow had a thirty-foot-long by eighteen-foot-wide living room with oiled redwood paneling, a fireplace, and chimney made from Carmel stone. It had views of Carmel Valley, Carmel River, and the Santa Lucia Mountains.

Photographer Arnold Genthe stopped by while the house was under construction. He became the first of many Sterling friends to follow him to Carmel, building a larger Craftsman house nearby that copied some features of the Sterling home.

The Sterlings left Piedmont and moved into their new Carmel home on August 18, 1905. Sterling still couldn&#x27;t leave Frank Havens&#x27; corporate work behind. Havens pleaded for Sterling&#x27;s help. The Sterlings needed the &quot;indecently large&quot; pay, so for the next five years George continued to work for Havens&#x27; corporations, most months spending one to three weeks at work in San Francisco or Oakland and the rest of his time in Carmel.

Sterling encouraged classically-trained singer and pianist Mabel Gray Lachmund Young to move to Carmel. In 1905, builder M.J. Murphy built her a small redwood cottage on Lincoln, which still survives today, including her &quot;LACHMUND&quot; sign near its front gate and Carmel&#x27;s last surviving tent cabin in its back yard.

Sterling planted two acres of potatoes, peas, and other crops, but he was not a successful farmer. His soil was not fertile, and cows knocked down his fences to eat his crops. They were also raided by groundhogs. He was more successful getting food by fishing, especially shellfish such as mussels, crabs, and abalone, and by hunting. He recorded in his &quot;Carmel Diaries&quot; shooting hundreds of birds and animals.

====1906 earthquake and aftermath====
At 5:12 on the morning of April 18, Sterling was at home in Carmel when a mighty earthquake struck: &quot;The shock even there was terrific—I thought it would never let up. We all ran out on the front veranda … My two big rock chimneys were shattered, and broken up entirely &#x27;from the roof up&#x27;.&quot;

North in San Francisco (at that time the nation&#x27;s ninth-largest city), the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire destroyed hundreds of city blocks and left more than 225,000 people homeless. Several refugees fled to Carmel. To accommodate visitors, the Sterlings added a tent-cabin and a large tent. They converted part of their woodshed into a second kitchen for visitors&#x27; use. Members of the Partington family stayed with the Sterlings for months. Some Sterling friends moved permanently to Carmel in 1906, including novelist Mary Austin and writer James Hopper with his wife and children.

More than 100,000 San Franciscans fled to East Bay cities such as Oakland, Berkeley, and Emeryville, where Sterling&#x27;s uncle Frank kept him busy as his companies exploded with growth. In January 1907 Sterling was elected corporate secretary of the Piedmont Development company and treasurer of the Real Estate Combine. That year he and Carrie sold their former home in Piedmont to Traylor Bell, a son of Harmon Bell.

The biggest three personal events during 1907 for the Sterlings were the nationwide scandal over Sterling&#x27;s &quot;A Wine of Wizardry&quot;, Sterling&#x27;s mentor Ambrose Bierce visiting in August, and, while George was in Oakland, the suicide of young poet Nora May French in the Sterlings&#x27; Carmel home.

====Colony of artists, writers, and musicians====

A colony of artists and painters already lived in Carmel before the Sterlings moved there. Both George and Carrie Sterling were active in the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club, raising funds for its new clubhouse, designed and built in 1907 by Sterling&#x27;s builder William E. Wood. On July 16, 1908, Sterling was toastmaster for thirty-two members of the club for the first annual breakfast at its clubhouse.

Sterling attracted literary residents, including writer Frederick R. Bechdolt in 1907, and in 1908 actor and aspiring writer Herbert Peet (who changed his name to Herbert Heron) and his wife Sara Opal Piontkowski Heron, editor and writer Michael Williams, writer Kenneth MacNichol, writing student William Rose Benét, and newspaper reporter Grant Wallace.

After best-selling author Upton Sinclair&#x27;s New Jersey utopian experiment Helicon Home Colony burned, Sinclair arrived in Carmel October 31, 1908, looking for a new place to live. He stayed one night in Sterling&#x27;s guest cabin and the next night Arnold Genthe &quot;let Sinclair have his bungalow.&quot; Sinclair was followed by fellow Helicon refugees the sister novelists Alice MacGowan and Grace MacGowan Cooke, Grace&#x27;s daughter Helen, and a red-headed aspiring writer who everybody called &quot;Red&quot; or &quot;Hal,&quot; but whose actual name was Harry Sinclair Lewis. Later he would become the first American writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, but in 1909 Lewis wanted to meet his idol Sterling and learn how to be a writer. Lewis roomed with William Rose Benét. Sterling got Lewis a job with the &quot;San Francisco Evening Bulletin&quot;, and later helped him sell short-story ideas to Jack London. A leading San Francisco newspaper profiled Carmel&#x27;s wave of new inhabitants in a full-page story, &quot;The Literary Craftsmen of Carmel.&quot; The page was topped with a drawing of Sterling smoking a cigarette (which he never did) while writing on a wooded beach.

Sterling regularly harvested enough abalones to hold abalone feasts for his friends, often on the &quot;Cooke&#x27;s Cove&quot; beach, a block away from the MacGowan sisters&#x27; house on Thirteenth Avenue. Abalone meat is tough. To make it edible, Sterling and his guests had to pound raw abalones with rocks. Sterling made their task fun by writing &quot;The Abalone Song&quot; for them to chant in rhythm as they pounded. It became his most popular song, almost an anthem for Carmel-by-the-Sea.

Sterling&#x27;s &quot;Carmel Diaries&quot; became a catalog of parties, both with local residents and with dozens of visitors. George and Carrie both drank frequently and in large quantities, especially George. Upton Sinclair liked Carmel and seriously considered staying there, but told George he would do so only if Sterling stopped drinking. Sterling promised to abstain, but soon was visibly drunk again. Sinclair left, but the two men remained friends for the rest of Sterling&#x27;s life. In 1909, another writer arrived: young Vera Connolly moved into her family&#x27;s cottage on the corner of Casanova and Thirteenth to care for her mother Mary. Although just a student at the University of California, Connolly already had sold a short story to a national magazine.

In 1910 Frank Havens and his partner Francis M. Smith were dividing their jointly-owned empire of corporations, so Sterling spent most of January, February, and April away from Carmel, working on the split. The biggest news in Carmel was the in-progress outdoor Forest Theater. Construction started in February. Herbert Heron was in charge, but both Sterlings worked on it. Jack and Charmian London visited the Sterlings for 21 days, from February 26 through March 14, the last of their three trips to Camel. In May, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; printed a long, satiric profile of Carmel headlined &quot;Where Author and Artist Folk Are Establishing the Most Amazing Colony on Earth&quot; by Willard Huntington Wright (later a millionaire for writing Philo Vance mysteries under his pen name S. S. Van Dine), with four cartoons by Edmund &quot;Ted&quot; Waller Gale. The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; also poked fun at the town: &quot;Carmel, as you know, is a community composed entirely of poets. … Show me a single citizen of Carmel who is not a poet and I show you … a carpet-bagger, not a real Carmelite!&quot;

Carmel&#x27;s new 1,000-seat outdoor theater presented its first play in July 1910. Carrie Sterling acted in a small part. New literary residents of Carmel that year included the Sterlings&#x27; long-time friends Perry Newberry and his wife Bertha Newberry, as well as Inez Haynes Gillmore and bestselling novelist and playwright Harry Leon Wilson. Ambrose Bierce visited the Sterlings in Carmel in August (staying at the Pine Tree Inn) and stayed with them for ten days in Yosemite.

====The Sterlings&#x27; marriage deteriorates====
By the middle of 1910, George&#x27;s affair with Vera Connolly had progressed to the point where Carrie contemptuously called her &quot;that Connolly girl.&quot; George and Vera flirted in front of Carrie openly. &quot;---- &#x27;em!&quot; Carrie angrily wrote. George had committed several infidelities in Carmel, but there is no record of others this blatant. Carrie left Carmel to spend Christmastime and her January 1 birthday in New York City with Frank Havens and his wife, Carrie&#x27;s oldest sister Lila—away from George. While Carrie was away, Vera Connolly and two friends from Berkeley stayed for a week at the Sterling&#x27;s Carmel house and celebrated New Year&#x27;s Eve with George. By Carrie&#x27;s January 14, 1911 return to Carmel, gossip about George and Vera was the talk of Carmelites. Sterling got Connolly pregnant; she had a miscarriage or an abortion. Sterling reported: &quot;some of them [his Carmel neighbors] fight shy of &quot;me&quot;, because they think I&#x27;m immoral—or unmoral: Grace [MacGowan] Cook[e], [Arthur H.] Vachell, and the [Frederick] Bechdolts are the worst. I mean at disliking me.&quot; Carrie was also ostracized. Connolly&#x27;s mother took her away from Carmel to stay with relatives in Leavenworth, Kansas, from May to early September, and then to Washington, D.C.

On May 25, 1911 the Sterlings left Carmel with Frank and Lila Havens to spend summer in Sag Harbor, New York. They stayed in a mansion Havens built on the town&#x27;s largest beach, which Havens owned. It was George&#x27;s first return to Sag Harbor since leaving it twenty-one years ago. He thoroughly enjoyed visiting his boyhood town and his uncle&#x27;s lavish hospitality. He wrote to Bierce about Connolly: &quot;I don&#x27;t want you to think I&#x27;m caddish in telling you we were in love with each other. We were, and are, though for Carrie&#x27;s sake we&#x27;ve got to keep apart.&quot; Bierce visited the Sterlings and Havens in Sag Harbor that August. George and Carrie separately discussed the George-and-Vera situation with him. After Bierce left, George visited New York City, where he met young Mary Craig Kimbrough and immediately began writing love letters and love poems to her. The Sterlings left New York to return to California, stopping on September 20 to see the Grand Canyon. They returned to Carmel October. 2, 1911.

On January 16, 1912, the Sterlings were at home in Carmel when they received a telegram. Their brother-in-law Harry Maxwell—the prosperous husband of Carrie&#x27;s sister Nell—had suddenly died in Oakland. George and Carrie were shocked. Harry and Nell had just left Carmel on Carrie&#x27;s birthday fifteen days ago. They took the morning train from Monterey to Oakland for Maxwell&#x27;s funeral, held at his large house in Piedmont. Carrie refused to return to Carmel. &quot;Carmel has become so hateful to me,&quot; Carrie wrote to Ambrose Bierce, &quot;I find it just about impossible to live there longer.&quot; She and George stayed in Piedmont until January 31, when George &quot;Returned on the afternoon train, alone.&quot;

For the next fourteen months, Carrie lived in Piedmont while George stayed in Carmel. He visited her frequently and they seemed to get along well together. While Carrie was away, fledgling poet Clark Ashton Smith stayed with George for a month at the Sterlings&#x27; bungalow. Ambrose Bierce made a short visit to Carmel in September, 1912. Carrie came to Carmel in April, 1913 to stay with George for almost three weeks. She went back to Piedmont to gather her belongings, then on May 30 moved back with George in Carmel. For nearly six months they tried to live together, but eventually Carrie told George she wanted a divorce. The last entry Sterling made in their Carmel diaries was November 24, 1913: &quot;Carrie has left me.&quot;

Sterling wrote to Clark Ashton Smith: &quot;Carrie has once more left me, this time for ever, I fear. She says it&#x27;s neither my fault nor hers; if it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s it&#x27;s mine, as I&#x27;m sure I should have written more and drunk less. Damn poets marrying, anyhow!
 &quot;I guess the news will come out in the papers to-day or to-morrow. I only hope they put all the blame on me, as she deserves none. … It&#x27;s a heart-troubling thing to break up an intimacy of twenty years&#x27; standing. Such things send their roots very deep &amp; wide.&quot;

On Sterling&#x27;s 44th birthday (December 1, 1913) newspaper headlines proclaimed Carrie had filed for divorce. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; story, headlined &quot;Loves and Art Clash: Mrs. G. Sterling Seeks Divorce from Famous Poet,&quot; featured a big photo of Carrie and quoted her sister Nell: &quot;The only charge is that of incompatibility of temperament. What about? Well, you know Mr. Sterling is a poet, do you not? Did you ever try to live with a poet?&quot;

Carrie&#x27;s friend Elsie Martinez believed George&#x27;s scandal with Connolly &quot;didn&#x27;t cause the breakup with Carrie herself. It was Mrs. Havens, [Carrie&#x27;s oldest sister] Lila, who had become a society woman and very proper. … She decided that Carrie could not stay with George. Carrie was a darling and still devoted to George, and I think she thought poets were that way, that&#x27;s all. … She hadn&#x27;t yet divorced George and George begged her not to divorce him. Finally, Lila decided Carrie should divorce George and start life over again. … So finally she persuaded Carrie to get a divorce.&quot;

George did not oppose Carrie&#x27;s request. A judge granted their divorce January 5, 1914, to take effect one year later. Eight years after the Sterling&#x27;s moved into their Carmel dream house, George gave it to Carrie in their divorce and moved out of the bungalow. James Hopper and his family rented the house from Carrie, eventually purchasing it from her.

===New York City and Sag Harbor: 1914-1915===
After the Sterlings&#x27; divorce became final in 1914, George moved to New York. His residence in New York City and summer in Sag Harbor is described in the &quot;Literary career and critical responses&quot; section above.

===San Francisco: 1915-1926===
Sterling moved back to San Francisco and into the Bohemian Club. Except for trips to Hollywood to write plays and movies and one more successful stay in New York, Sterling lived for the rest of his life in the Bohemian Club.

In 1918, a wealthy patron offered to pay for Sterling to take a long trip to New York City. He arrived in July and moved into The Lambs Club, intending to stay for months. He met old friend photographer Arnold Genthe and new friends poet Bliss Carman, novelist Theodore Dreiser, socialist reporter John Reed, poet Harry Kemp, and novelist Nina Wilcox Putnam. While he lived in New York, Sterling missed the Bohemian Grove performance of the play &quot;The Twilight of the Kings&quot; on Saturday, August 3.

The following warm, sunny Thursday afternoon, in Carrie Sterling&#x27;s cottage on the Havens estate in Piedmont, she &quot;put on her newest gown,&quot; lay down on her bed, drank poison, clasped a rose in her hands, and died. She left a letter saying &quot;that she had been happy until the time she divorced her husband three years ago, but that the future held nothing and she might as well be dead.&quot; At Carrie&#x27;s request, her ashes were scattered in the forested hills at the back of Joaquin Miller&#x27;s estate, where she and George had camped many times with their Piedmont friends.

In New York, George Sterling packed his bags and took a train to California &quot;as soon as I could after receiving that shocking news,&quot; he told Upton Sinclair. &quot;It was an awful trip, listening day after day to what the car-wheels had to say about me.&quot; Sterling wrote to Charmian London: &quot;I did feel horrible indeed. I still do.&quot;

==Death==

On November 15, 1926, H.L. Mencken visited Sterling in San Francisco. &quot;He was in great pain when I called upon him at the Bohemian Club, but his mind was clear, and we had a brief and friendly palaver. I came away convinced that he was desperately ill. He showed every sign of complete exhaustion. That was on Monday. On Tuesday morning I went to see him again, but found him sleeping. On Tuesday night his door was locked, and the transom showed darkness within. I assumed he was still sleeping, and went away. No doubt he was already dead.&quot;

Sterling died by suicide in his room at the Bohemian Club; his body was discovered on November 17, 1926. He was 56 years old. Sterling carried a vial of cyanide for many years. When asked about it he said, &quot;A prison becomes a home if you have the key&quot;. He was buried in Oakland, California. Mencken wrote: &quot;In the end, with age and illness upon him, he put an end to his life, quietly, simply and decently. It was, I think, a good life—and a good death.&quot;

==Legacy and influence==
H. P. Lovecraft noted of Sterling: &quot;I have the most profound respect for his work &amp; influence in American letters.&quot; Writers influenced by Sterling include Jack London (as described in &quot;Life and business career&quot; section above), Clark Ashton Smith, Robinson Jeffers, Audrey Wurdemann, Sinclair Lewis, Ray Bradbury, Porter Garnett, Fritz Lieber, Frances Marion, and others.

The single Sterling poem that most influenced other writers (both of poetry and of fiction) was &quot;A Wine of Wizardry&quot;. The Wikipedia article on that poem describes influenced writers and writings. In 2012, Australian editor Charles Lovecraft published &quot;Avatars of Wizardry,&quot; an entire book of poems by American, Canadian, and Australian poets influenced by &quot;A Wine of Wizardry&quot;.

Other works by Sterling have influenced writers as well. For example, Porter Garnett described how Sterling&#x27;s 1907 play &quot;The Triumph of Bohemia&quot; influenced Garnett&#x27;s 1911 play &quot;The Green Knight.&quot;

===As a fictional character===
In addition to Sterling&#x27;s writings, his colorful life and personality inspired several writers to create fictional characters based on him.

* Jack London depicted Sterling as fictional characters three times: as Walt Irvine in the 1906 short story &quot;Brown Wolf&quot;; as Russ Brissenden in the autobiographical novel &quot;Martin Eden&quot; (1909); and as Mark Hall (a pun on Sterling silver hallmarks) in &quot;The Valley of the Moon&quot; (1913).
* Gelett Burgess wrote a novel &quot;The Heart Line: A Drama of San Francisco&quot; (1907) with a character Philip Starr based on Sterling and central characters based on Sterling&#x27;s friends Isabel Fraser and Porter Garnett.
* Mary Hunter Austin, in her novel &quot;Outland&quot;, set in a fantasy version of Carmel-by-the-Sea (and first published in London in 1910 under the pseudonym Gordon Stairs), modeled her villain Ravenutzi on Sterling at the poet&#x27;s request.
* Dashiell Hammett based his character Burke Pangburn on Sterling in the short story &quot;The Girl with the Silver Eyes&quot; (1924). At the time Hammett wrote this story, he and Sterling lived in San Francisco only eight blocks apart.
* Fritz Leiber&#x27;s father, Fritz Leiber, Sr., had played the key role of Death in Irving Thalberg&#x27;s enormous production of Sterling&#x27;s The Play of Everyman in the Hollywood Bowl. Leiber was a fan of Sterling&#x27;s writings. He made the poet a character in his 1977 horror fantasy Our Lady of Darkness, which won the World Fantasy Award for best novel.
* Ray Faraday Nelson&#x27;s short story &quot;Valse Trieste&quot; imagines a traveler coming upon a large mansion with people in an enormous ballroom waltzing to Jean Sibelius&#x27; &quot;Valse Trieste&quot; (Sad Waltz). The dancers include Sterling, and they all turn out to be suicides, dancing in Jack London&#x27;s mansion Wolf House.
* Bill Broder&#x27;s play &quot;Abalone!&quot; (first produced 2016, first published 2020) portrays an imaginary meeting between Sterling, Ambrose Bierce, and Mary Austin.

* A portrait bust of Sterling by sculptor Ralph Stackpole is displayed on Level C in Dwinelle Hall at the University of California, Berkeley.
* In 1915, six lines from Sterling&#x27;s play &quot;The Triumph of Bohemia&quot; were inscribed across three panels at the tops of three seven-story-tall arches in the Court of the Four Seasons in the Panama-Pacific International Exposition world&#x27;s fair: For lasting happiness we turn our eyes&lt;br&gt;To one alone, and she surrounds you now--&lt;br&gt;Great Nature, refuge of the weary heart,&lt;br&gt;And only balm to breasts that have been bruised!&lt;br&gt;She hath cool hands for every fevered brow,&lt;br&gt;And gentlest silence for the troubled soul.
* In the Beach Chalet in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park, the 1937 ground floor mural by Lucien Labaudt includes a painted banner arched over a doorway with the quotation &quot;At the end of our streets—the stars,&quot; from Sterling&#x27;s poem &quot;The City by The Sea: San Francisco,&quot; and Sterling&#x27;s name and life dates &quot;1869-1926.&quot;
* In San Francisco at the northeast corner of Townsend Street and Embarcadero is a stone monument with Sterling&#x27;s name, the date 1901, and the quotation &quot;To each the city of his dream,&quot; the first line of &quot;Memorial Day,&quot; Sterling&#x27;s first major poem.

On July 10, 1982, at a ceremony attended by literary historian Don Herron, columnist Herb Caen, science fiction author Ray Faraday Nelson, Jack London&#x27;s daughter Becky, and poets Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Philip Lamantia, Donald Sidney-Fryer, and Nancy Peters, the stolen plaque was replaced with a new one quoting Sterling&#x27;s poem &quot;The Cool, Grey City of Love&quot; and the park was named &quot;George Sterling Park.&quot; The new plaque was later moved to its present location at the park&#x27;s northwest corner.

A second bronze mask is in the collection of the Carmel public library&#x27;s Henry Meade Williams Local History Department.

<text>Gas Light is a 1938 thriller play, set in 1880s London, written by the British novelist and playwright Patrick Hamilton. Hamilton&#x27;s play is a dark tale of a marriage based on deceit and trickery, and a husband committed to driving his wife insane in order to steal from her.

&quot;Gas Light&quot; was written during a dark period in Hamilton&#x27;s life. Six years prior to the play Hamilton was hit by a drunk driver and dragged through the streets of London, leaving him with a limp, a paralysed arm, and a disfigured face. Two years later, Hamilton&#x27;s mother took her own life.

Premiering at the Richmond Theatre in London on 5 December 1938 before transferring to the Apollo Theatre in the West End on 1 January, the play closed after six months and 141 performances, but it has endured through an impressive list of incarnations most notably Five Chelsea Lane (1941 American playrenamed for Los Angeles production), Angel Street (1941 American playrenamed again when Los Angeles production transferred to Broadway), and &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1958 Australian television play). &quot;Angel Street&quot; was a hit in its Broadway premiere, and it remains one of the longest-running non-musicals in Broadway history, with 1,295 total performances.

The play was adapted to the big screen as two films, both entitled &quot;Gaslight&quot;—a 1940 British film, and a 1944 American film directed by George Cukor, also known as &quot;The Murder in Thornton Square&quot; in the UK. Both films are considered classics in their respective countries of origin, and are generally equally critically acclaimed. The 1944 American version received seven nominations at the 17th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won two, Best Actress (for Ingrid Bergman) and Best Production Design. In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The play is set in fog-bound London in 1880, at the upper middle class home of Jack Manningham and his wife Bella. It is late afternoon, a time that Hamilton notes as the time &quot;before the feeble dawn of gaslight and tea.&quot;

Bella is clearly on edge, and the stern reproaches of her overbearing husband (who flirts with the servants in front of his wife) make matters worse. What most perturbs Bella is Jack&#x27;s unexplained disappearances from the house: he will not tell her where he is going, and this increases her anxiety. It becomes clear that Jack is intent on convincing Bella that she is going insane, even to the point of assuring her she is imagining that the gas light in the house is dimming.

The appearance of a police detective called Rough leads Bella to realise that Jack is responsible for her torment. Rough explains that the apartment above was once occupied by one Alice Barlow, a wealthy woman who was murdered for her jewels. The murderer was never found.

Jack goes to the flat each night to search for the jewels, and lighting the apartment&#x27;s gas lights causes the lights to dim in the rest of the building. His footsteps in the supposedly empty apartment persuade Bella that she is &quot;hearing things&quot;. Rough convinces Bella to assist him in exposing Jack as the murderer, which she does, but not before she takes revenge on Jack by pretending to help him escape. At the last minute she reminds him that, having gone insane, she is not accountable for her actions. The play closes with Jack being led away by the police.

==Productions==
===London===

&quot;Gas Light&quot; premiered on 5 December 1938 at the Richmond Theatre in Richmond, London. It transferred to the Apollo Theatre on 1 January 1939 and to the Savoy Theatre on 22 May 1939. The cast featured Dennis Arundell (Mr. Manningham), Milton Rosmer (Mr. Rough), Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies (Mrs. Manningham), Beatrice Rowe (Elizabeth) and Elizabeth Inglis (Nancy). The production closed 10 June 1939 after a total of 141 performances.

===Broadway===

In the spring of 1941 Vincent Price and his wife, actress Edith Barrett, saw &quot;Gas Light&quot; performed in Los Angeles as a three-hander titled &quot;Five Chelsea Lane&quot;. They were impressed by the play and set about securing the rights for a Broadway production of their own. By fall, they had found a producer to underwrite the project, but Barrett abruptly withdrew to remain in Hollywood and work in films. In November 1941 Price returned to work on the New York stage. Judith Evelyn, the Canadian actress who played the role of Mrs. Manningham in Los Angeles, joined the Broadway production. The name of the play changed to &quot;Angel Street&quot;.

&quot;Angel Street&quot; premiered on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre on 5 December 1941, produced and directed by Shepard Traube (1907–1983). The cast featured Leo G. Carroll (Rough), Florence Edney (Elizabeth), Elizabeth Eustis (Nancy), Judith Evelyn (Mrs. Manningham) and Vincent Price (Mr. Manningham). Price left the play after a year, when his working relationship with Evelyn deteriorated into what she later described as &quot;violent dislike&quot;. In December 1942 John Emery assumed the role of Mr. Manningham.

In a long profile headlined “The Triumph of Traube,“ published on 14 March 1943, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described some of the challenges faced by the production, including the untimely opening date, two days before Pearl Harbor: “On Dec. 5 the play opened, on Dec. 6 the rave reviews had sent a long line of pilgrims to the theatre box office, on Dec. 7 the play was forgotten under the impact of the Japanese attack. &quot;Angel Street&quot; wabbled momentarily then picked up its stride, which has hardly slackened since.” The play transferred to the Bijou Theatre on 2 October 1944 and closed on 30 December 1944 after 1,295 performances.

===On tour===
On 19 December 1941 &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced that Traube had cancelled a trip to the West Coast in order to form a touring company for &quot;Angel Street&quot;. The tour was to begin in Baltimore in February, with stops including Washington, D.C.; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Chicago, Illinois.

On Sunday, 15 March 1942, the touring company of &quot;Angel Street&quot; opened in Chicago to rave reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported an observation by Chicago critic Robert Pollak that &quot;Not since &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; had the crowd out front participated so heartily&quot;.

===Revivals===
&quot;Angel Street&quot; was added to the repertory of The American Negro Players in 1947. The play ran at New York City Center from 22 January 1948 to 1 February 1948 for 14 performances. Directed by Richard Barr, the cast featured José Ferrer (Mr. Manningham), Uta Hagen (Mrs. Manningham), Phyllis Hill (Nancy), Nan McFarland (Elizabeth), Ralph Roberts (Policeman), Victor Thorley (Policeman) and Richard Whorf (Rough). On 19 August 1952 &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced that a new off-Broadway group, Hamilton-Bruder Productions (a partnership of Patrick Hamilton and Janet Bruders), was opening with a revival of &quot;Angel Street.&quot; The play was revived on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre, opening on 26 December 1975 and closing on 8 February 1976 after 52 performances and 4 previews. Also directed by Shepard Traube, the cast featured Michael Allinson (Mr. Manningham), Dina Merrill (Mrs. Manningham), Christine Andreas (Nancy), Bette Henritze (Elizabeth) and Robert E. Thompson (Rough).

Dulaang UP produced the play&#x27;s Philippine premiere in February 2005 with an English version and a Filipino translation. The play was produced at The Old Vic, London in June 2007 under the title of &quot;Gaslight&quot;. Directed by Peter Gill, the cast featured Andrew Woodall as Mr. Manningham, Rosamund Pike as Mrs. Manningham and Kenneth Cranham as Rough. The Irish Repertory Theatre produced the play Off-Broadway (as &quot;Gaslight&quot;) running from 17 May 2007 to 8 July 2007. The production was directed by Charlotte Moore and the cast featured David Staller (Mr. Manningham), Laura Odeh (Mrs. Manningham), Laoisa Sexton (Nancy), Patricia O&#x27;Connell (Elizabeth), April Ann Klein (Police Officer) and Brian Murray (Rough). Murray was nominated for a Lucille Lortel Award as Outstanding Featured Actor. Staller was nominated for the Drama League&#x27;s Distinguished Performance Award, and the production was nominated for the League&#x27;s Distinguished Revival of a Play.

In 2014 the Sandyford Little Theatre Company produced &quot;Gaslight: a Radio Play for Stage&quot;, an onstage radio play with seven actors playing 24 roles. In 2015 Myriad Theatre &amp; Film produced &quot;Gaslight&quot; at Ingatestone Hall in Essex. In October 2016 the Lantern Theatre in Sheffield, England produced &quot;Gaslight&quot;. In 2019 Perth Theatre staged a production of &quot;Gaslight&quot; as part of their Winter/Spring season. In 2022 the Shaw Festival, the second-largest repertory theatre company in North America, staged a production of &quot;Gaslight&quot;. On 9 September 2022 the version by Jô Soares, one of the greatest Brazilian theater directors, premiered in São Paulo, Brazil. The director did not attend the premiere, as he died on 5 August 2022. Starring Giovani Tozi and Erica Montanheiro, &quot;Gaslight - A Toxic Relationship&quot;, features a 14-metre spider web on the set, and with doses of humor, the production is still running, as one of the greatest theatrical successes in the country. 

== Reception ==
&quot;Angel Street&quot; was a hit in its Broadway premiere, and it remains one of the longest-running non-musicals in Broadway history, with 1,295 total performances.

It remains a perennial favourite with both repertory and amateur theatre companies.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Brooks Atkinson opens his 6 December 1941 review with this observation: “Although Patrick Hamilton writes his thrillers within a small compass, he writes them with infinite craft and dexterity. &quot;Angel Street&quot;, which sent a chill up the spine of the Golden Theatre last evening, comes off the top part of the theatre&#x27;s top shelf.” Atkinson praises Straube for matching “Hamilton’s skill in a tingling performance that fills the theater with an ominous and terrifying illusion” and commends all the actors, observing that Leo G. Carroll had his best role in years.

In his review of the 1948 City Center production, Louis Kronenberger wrote: &quot;(It) remains one of the better thrillers ... let&#x27;s call it one of the best. All the same, though it holds up nicely for three acts, it seems to me outstandingly good for only one.&quot;

Reviewing Traube&#x27;s 1975 Broadway revival, Clive Barnes asked: “Whatever happened to the good, old‐fashioned melodrama? It probably drifted over to television and died. Just about 35 years ago...Patrick Hamilton&#x27;s English thriller, &quot;Angel Street&quot;, opened on Broadway with resounding success. It was directed and produced by Shepard Traube. Last night, at the Lyceum Theater, Mr. Traube attempted an encore. It was not called for... The trouble with this play is not the trouble with this particular play—it is the trouble with this play as a particular. The theater cannot afford the luxury anymore of wilting heroines, villains making out as if they were Vincent Price (35 years ago it was Vincent Price!) or detectives detecting with the solidity of a basset hound... Nothing is quite clever enough in &quot;Angel Street&quot;, and the atmosphere is so rarefied that the play is artistically in dire need of oxygen.”

On 24 May 2007, in her review of the Irish Repertory Theatre revival, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Ginia Bellafante observed that &quot;Gaslight&quot; &quot;established the blueprint for a kind of domestic-peril thriller... Every time an actress portrays the sort of wife who discovers that the greatest threat to her mental and physical safety is the man sitting in her breakfast nook, Mr. Hamilton’s estate ought to receive some type of remuneration...David Staller plays this undesirable husband as a man whose lust exempts nothing. Every time he appears onstage, you think: keep this person away from my babysitter and Rolex. Mr. Staller&#x27;s rogue posture modulates his character&#x27;s cruelty, leavening the play&#x27;s potentially stifling mood. Mr. Hamilton believed our most dangerous enemies were always in the room with us ..., and his work can feel claustrophobic. Ms. Moore is aware of this, providing the proper ventilation to clear much of the Victorian must. Brian Murray, playing the detective who uncovers Manningham&#x27;s plan, is her greatest asset in this regard. He appears onstage with the red cheeks of a Santa Claus, an ageing imp who hides out in nooks and corners, showing a benevolent sarcasm that teases Bella out of her dimwitted complacency&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
* The 1940 British film &quot;Gaslight&quot;, directed by Thorold Dickinson.
* The 1944 American film of the same name, directed by George Cukor. It was released in Britain as &quot;The Murder in Thornton Square&quot; in order to avoid confusion with the earlier film.

===Television===
* The cast of the original London production recreated their stage roles for a 1939 television presentation directed by Lanham Titchener and performed live on BBC Television.
* On 20 January 1946 NBC broadcast the complete play. The following Sunday, a long piece by &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Jack Gould examined the production and its implications for the future of television. 
* A version was produced for Australian television in 1958.
* Polish television aired a live stage play on 28 September 1961, under the Polish title &quot;Gasnący płomień&quot;. This was a part of its ongoing series of televised stage plays under the name &quot;Cobra Theater&quot; (Kobra – Teatr Sensacji). It is the oldest episode of the &quot;Cobra Theatre&quot; series that is known to have survived in its entirety on tape.

===Radio===

The story was dramatised as a half-hour radio play on the 3 February 1947 broadcast of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, starring Charles Boyer and Susan Hayward. A 1946 one-hour radio production on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; featured Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman, stars of the 1944 film adaptation. A 2019 podcast adaptation starred Chloë Grace Moretz, though it was set in the modern day, and the plot was significantly modernised. It was sponsored by Talkspace.

=== Stage ===
In 2022, Canada&#x27;s Shaw Festival premiered a feminist adaptation of the play penned by Johnna Wright and Patty Jamieson. The production, directed by Kelli Fox, starred Julie Lumsden as Bella and André Morin as Jack.

Steven Dietz has also done an adaptation of the novel.

== Denominalisation of the play&#x27;s title ==

In 1961, twenty-three years after the stageplay was written, writers began denominalising the film&#x27;s title and using it as a verb, &quot;gaslighting&quot;. Gaslighting, in this context, is a colloquialism that loosely means to manipulate a person or a group of people in a way similar to the way the protagonist in the play (Bella) was manipulated.

The term &quot;gaslighting&quot; does not appear in any of the stageplays or screenplays and is inspired by the film&#x27;s title &quot;Gaslight&quot;.

<text>Chrism, also called &quot;myrrh&quot;, myron, &quot;holy anointing oil&quot;, and consecrated oil, is a consecrated oil used in the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, Nordic Lutheran, Anglican, and Old Catholic churches in the administration of certain sacraments and ecclesiastical functions.

== Name ==

The English &quot;chrism&quot; derives from Koine Greek via Latin and Old French. In Greek, &quot;khrîsma&quot; () was originally the verbal noun (&quot;(the act of) anointing&quot;, &quot;unction&quot;) of (&quot;anoint&quot;). By extension, along with &quot;khrîma&quot; (), &quot;khrîstai&quot; (), and later &quot;khrísma&quot; (), it came to be used for the anointing oil or ointment itself. &quot;Khrísma&quot; came into Latin as &#x27;, which appears in the works of Tertullian. This was adopted directly into Old English as &#x27;, which developed into Middle English &#x27; and various related spellings. In Old French, the original Latin was conflated with &#x27; (&quot;cream&quot;), developing into &#x27;, which was also borrowed into Middle English around 1300 as &#x27; and various related spellings. The spelling &quot;chrism&quot; after the Latin original was generally adopted in the 16th century, after which &quot;cream&quot; came to be restricted to its present meaning.

The Proto-Indo-European root from which the Greek term derived has been reconstructed as &quot;*gʰrey-&quot; (&quot;to trickle&quot;). This is cognate with Sanskrit &quot;ghṛtə&quot; (, from the radix ( / / ), which means to shine / to trickle / to cover) and Hindi (, &quot;ghee&quot;), as well as Lithuanian &#x27; (&quot;skimming&quot;), Middle Low German &#x27; (&quot;grime&quot;), Old English &#x27; (&quot;mask, helm, spectre&quot;, presumably from an original sense of &quot;covering&quot; or &quot;concealment&quot;), English &quot;grime&quot;, and possibly Phrygian &#x27; (&quot;painted, ornamented, inscribed&quot;).

Chrism is also called Myron or myrrh. Myron is an oil that is blessed by a bishop.

== Early Christian usage ==

Multiple early Christian documents discuss the &quot;ordinance&quot; or &quot;several ceremonies...explained in the Apostolical Constitutions&quot; of &quot;chrism&quot;, including documents by Theophilus (d. 181) and Tertullian (d. 220).
The most detailed version of the practice is by Cyril of Jerusalem who details how ointment or oil was &quot;symbolically applied to the forehead, and the other organs of sense&quot; and that the &quot;ears, nostrils, and breast were each to be anointed.&quot; Cyril states that the &quot;ointment is the seal of the covenants&quot; of baptism and God&#x27;s promises to the Christian who is anointed. Cyril taught that being &quot;anointed with the Holy anointing oil of God&quot; was the sign of a Christian, and a physical representation of having the Gift of the Holy Spirit, and it retains this meaning in Catholicism and Orthodoxy today. He says, &quot;Having been counted worthy of this Holy Chrism, you are called Christians, verifying the name also by your new birth. For before you were deemed worthy of this grace, you properly had no right to this title but were advancing on your way towards being Christians.&quot; (&quot;On the Mysteries&quot; 3.5)

== Western Christianity ==

=== Latin Catholicism ===

Chrism is essential for the Catholic sacrament of confirmation or chrismation and is prominently used in the sacraments of baptism and holy orders. Those to be confirmed or chrismated, after receiving the laying on of hands, are anointed on the head by the bishop or priest. In baptism, if the person baptized is not to be immediately confirmed or chrismated, the minister anoints them with chrism. Newly ordained priests are anointed with chrism on the palms of their hands, and newly ordained bishops receive an anointing of chrism on their foreheads. It is also used in the consecration of objects such as churches and altars.

In the ancient Liturgy prior to the reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council, that is still retained today as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, employed by certain ecclesiastical communities, the use of chrism during the administration of holy orders differs: in the older form of the Roman Rite, priests are anointed in the hands only with the oil of catechumens, while bishops consecrated with the old ritual are anointed both in the head and in the hands with chrism.

Before the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, chrism had to be used to consecrate patens and chalices as well. The sign of the cross would be made with the chrism on the interior parts of the chalice and paten where the Eucharist would rest; the cross would then be smeared to cover the entire interior parts. The chalice and paten would need to be consecrated with the chrism again if they were re-gilded. This ritual could only be performed by a bishop or a priest with the faculties to do so. According to the new rubrics, a simple blessing suffices. However, it is still permitted that the bishop performs the consecration with chrism.

Chrism is made of olive oil and is scented with a sweet perfume, usually balsam. Under normal circumstances, chrism is consecrated by the bishop of the particular church in the presence of the presbyterium at the Chrism Mass, which takes place in the morning of Holy Thursday. The oil of catechumens and the oil of the sick are also blessed at this Mass.

These holy oils are usually stored in special vessels known as chrismaria and kept in a cabinet known as an ambry. When the oils are distributed to a priest for him to use in his ministry they are kept in a smaller vessel with three compartments, known as an &quot;oil stock&quot;. There is also a type of oil stock that is shaped like a ring, to make the anointing easier. The &quot;jewel&quot; of the ring is a container with a removable lid.

Holy oils were also used, in the older form of the Roman Rite, for the anointing of kings during ceremonies of coronation. Several local rites allowed for the use of chrism in those coronation rites (e.g. in the pre-reformation English coronation rite the anointing was with chrism; Napoleon was anointed with chrism by Pope Pius VII, etc.). However, the general coronation rite of the Roman Liturgy, codified in the Roman Pontifical of Pope Clement VIII, prescribed the use of the oil of cathecumens for the anointing of kings.
The Holy Ampulla or Holy Ampoule ( in French) was a glass vial which, from its first recorded use by Pope Innocent II for the anointing of Louis VII in 1131 to the Coronation of Louis XVI in 1775, held anointing oil for the coronations of the kings of France. In each French coronation, one drop of this anointing oil was mixed with chrism. Thus, French coronations employed chrism mixed with the oil of the Sainte Ampoule for the anointing of kings. The Sainte Ampoule was said to have been discovered by Hincmar the Archbishop of Reims when the sepulcher containing the body of Saint Remi was opened in the reign of Charles the Bald and identified with the baptism of Clovis I, the first Frankish king converted to Christianity; it was kept thereafter in the Abbey of Saint-Remi, Reims and brought with formality to the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims at each coronation, where the emphasis was on the anointment rather than on the crowning. Some remains of the content of the ampoule, destroyed in 1793 by French revolutionaries, were placed in a new reliquary made in time for the Coronation of Charles X and are kept since 1906 at the Archbishopric of Reims.

=== Anglicanism and Lutheranism ===

The primary use of chrism in Anglican and Lutheran churches is for the rite of chrismation, which may be included as a part of baptism, even for infants.

The oil of chrism is also commonly used in confirmation, although this practice is not followed by churches of these denominations that are in the evangelical tradition. Owing to this difference of practice, it is common for Anglican and Lutheran confirmation liturgies to refer to the use of chrism as an option. The liturgy of the Church of England states &quot;Oil mixed with fragrant spices (traditionally called chrism), expressing the blessings of the messianic era and the richness of the Holy Spirit, may be used to accompany the confirmation&quot;. The confirmation liturgy of the Anglican Province of Southern Africa includes the rubric &quot;The Bishop may sign them on the forehead, using at his discretion the Chrism&quot;. The liturgy of the Igreja Lusitana (Anglican Church in Portugal) states at the point of confirmation: &quot;Os confirmandos ajoelham perante o Bispo. Este pode assinala-los na testa com o sinal da cruz, usando oleo proprio&quot; (&quot;The confirmands kneel before the Bishop. He may anoint them on the forehead with the sign of the cross, using the proper oil&quot;).

The use of chrism in Anglican and Lutheran ordination liturgies is similarly presented as an option in most provinces. In the liturgy for the ordination of priests in the Church of England, for example, the instruction is: &quot;The bishop may anoint the palms of the hands of each newly ordained priest, saying &#x27;May God, who anointed the Christ with the Holy Spirit at his baptism, anoint and empower you to reconcile and bless his people&#x27;.&quot; There is a similar instruction for the ordination of bishops, who are anointed on the head rather than the palms of the hands.

An important and specific use of chrism is in the anointing during the coronation of the British monarch. In this part of the service, the Archbishop of Canterbury anoints the sovereign on the head, hands and heart. Anglicans consider this to be the holiest rite of the service, so much so that it is hidden from the congregation&#x27;s view by a canopy of state. It was not filmed during the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, or photographed in 1937 during the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. During the coronation of Charles III in May 2023, specially-made, portable screens were used during the anointing to conceal the King and Archbishop from the congregation and TV cameras during this sacred rite. It is followed by the presentation of the crown jewels to the sovereign, then the actual coronation.

Its other notable use is in the consecration of church buildings, where it may be used to anoint the walls, the altar/table, and the place for reservation of the eucharistic sacrament for the sick.

As in other traditions, chrism is usually based on olive oil (although other plant oils can be used if olive oil is unavailable), scented with a sweet perfume, usually balsam. Civet oil, and ambergris from the intestines of whales may be used. In preparing the oil for the 2023 coronation of Charles III, monarch of the United Kingdom and several Commonwealth countries, animal-derived components were not used, the olive oil being scented with essential oils of sesame, rose, jasmine, cinnamon, neroli and benzoin, and with orange blossom.

Chrism is usually consecrated by the bishop of the particular church in the presence of the presbyterium at the Chrism Eucharist, which takes place on Maundy Thursday or a day shortly before, where priestly ordination vows are often renewed also. The oil of catechumens and the oil of the sick are usually also consecrated at this liturgy. Practices vary for the blessing of the chrism, from interpolations within the Eucharistic Prayer, to specific prayers of consecration, used at the discretion of the minister. Some Lutheran and Anglican liturgical books, however, make provision for a pastor who is not a bishop (a presbyter) to consecrate chrism in time of need and in the absence of the bishop. The oil for the coronation of Charles III was consecrated by the Patriarch of Jerusalem and the Anglican Archbishop in Jerusalem, at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

=== Latter Day Saints ===

Members of the Latter Day Saint movement also practice ritual anointing of the sick, as well as other forms of anointing. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints consider anointing to be an ordinance.

Members of the LDS church who hold the Melchizedek priesthood may use consecrated oil in performing the ordinance of blessing of the &quot;sick or afflicted&quot;, although the blessing may be performed without oil if it is unavailable. The priesthood holder anoints the recipient&#x27;s head with a drop of oil, then lays their hands upon the head and declares the act of anointing. Then another priesthood holder joins in, if available, and pronounces a &quot;sealing&quot; of the anointing, and other words of blessing. Melchizedek priesthood holders are also authorized to consecrate any pure olive oil, and often carry a personal supply in case they have need to perform a blessing. Oil is not used in other blessings, such as for people seeking comfort or counsel. The word &quot;chrism&quot; is not used.

In addition to the reference, the Doctrine and Covenants contains numerous references to the anointing and healing of the sick by those with authority to do so.

== Eastern Christianity ==

=== Eastern Orthodox Church ===
Within the Orthodox Church chrism plays a part in many liturgical services and sacraments. The first sacrament that uses chrism, the sacrament of chrismation, is the second of the three sacraments of initiation (baptism, chrismation, and Divine Eucharist). For the Orthodox, chrismation canonically must be administered in conjunction with baptism, except in a case of true necessity. Here the blessing of the bishop upon the chrism functions as a substitute for the direct imposition of hands. Another use is in the consecration of church buildings, involving the anointing of the walls and of the altar table. Formerly, emperors and kings of monarchies where Orthodoxy was the state religion would receive anointment with chrism at their coronation. The introduction of anointing in the Byzantine coronation ceremony was a relatively late development; this was adopted only after the Latin occupation of Constantinople, following Latin practice.
The Orthodox Church makes chrism during Holy Week beginning on Holy Monday and culminating in the Divine Liturgy on Holy Thursday when it is carried in the Great Entrance and placed upon the altar. It consists primarily of olive oil with the addition of a range of aromatic essences, patterned after the anointing oil described in . Holy Myron is confected only by a bishop, without prejudice to particular law which reserves this power to the patriarch. In Russian tradition:
[...] into each vessel of new myrrh are poured a few drops of the old myrrh [...] This is done in token of the uninterrupted connection of the Russian Church with the Greek, from which she received [...] the first consecrated myrrh.

On completion, chrism is distributed to all the bishops, who, in turn, give it to their parishes when needed. It is not made on a yearly basis, but only when supplies run short.

The Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople produces chrism roughly once every 10 years using an ancient formula of the Jewish prophets and patriarchs that calls for 64 ingredients, while the flame needed to boil the mixture during the preparation is made by burning old and disfigured icons. The preparation of the chrism in the patriarchate is carried out by the college of the &quot;Kosmētores Myrepsoí&quot; (Greek: Κοσμήτορες Μυρεψοί, &quot;Deans Perfumers&quot;), presided by the &quot;Árchōn Myrepsós&quot;, the &quot;Lord Perfumer&quot;. The incumbent Archon Myrepsos is biochemist Prodromos Thanasoglou.
In Byzantine times the official responsible was the Grand Sacristan of the Patriarchate, but since then the specific office of the Archon Myrepsos was created. Laity are not allowed to handle either the chrism or the vessels containing it, therefore the Myrepsoi undergo a sort of &quot;temporary ordination&quot; into the clergy and are given by the patriarch a gold &quot;Cross of Ministry&quot; to hang from their necks for the duration of their four-day service. The Archon is given the &quot;lention&quot;, a silk &quot;towel&quot; or apron. Three copper cauldrons are used for the preparation: the largest contains olive oil, the smallest contains water and the aromatic ingredients and the middle contains wine, which allows the oil to boil without catching fire. The preparation involves several steps, some—such as the addition of musk and rose oil—performed by the patriarch himself. Once the chrism is filtered and ready, it is consecrated for the final time and stored in silver vessels in the Chapel of Saint Andrew, pending distribution.

=== Oriental Orthodox Churches ===
In the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (Jacobite Fraction), it is believed that Christ taught the holy apostles how to consecrate the myron or chrism. As a tradition, usually the primate or Catholicos of the East as appointed by Patariach consecrate the chrism.(Metropolitans can consecrate if needed) The primate is clothed in white vestments, &quot;corresponding to the light of his soul, and with the purity of his person, as the mystery indicates to him that it should be offered to God in purity.&quot; Present with the primate are twelve priests who represent the twelve apostles, twelve censers indicating the preaching of the Gospel, twelve lamps to symbolize the luminous revelations that descend upon them and twelve fans to indicate that it is not right that the divine mysteries should be revealed to those who are unworthy.

The Armenian Apostolic Church consecrates myrrh every seven years in autumn at Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Armenia.

<text>Jarosław Leon Iwaszkiewicz (; also known under his literary pseudonym Eleuter; 20 February 1894 – 2 March 1980), was a Polish writer, poet, essayist, dramatist and translator. He is recognized for his literary achievements, beginning with poetry and prose written after World War I. After 1989, he was often presented as a political opportunist during his mature years lived in communist Poland, where he held high offices (participated in the slander of Polish expatriates, literary and other figures who after World War II remained in the West). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times. In 1988, he was recognized as a Righteous Among the Nations for his role in sheltering Jews during World War II.

== Life and career ==

Iwaszkiewicz was born in Kalnyk in Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine). After the death of his father (an accountant), he and his mother lived in Warsaw in 1902–1904, and then moved back to Kiev Governorate. He graduated from a secondary school in Kiev in 1912 and enrolled at the Law Faculty of Kiev University.

In 1914, he travelled in Sicily and North Africa with his friend and distant cousin Karol Szymanowski, a composer for whose opera &quot;King Roger&quot; he later provided the libretto. After World War I, in October 1918 Iwaszkiewicz came to Warsaw, where he joined a group of young artists associated with the &quot;Pro Arte et Studio&quot; magazine. He had his public debut as a poet at the &quot;Pod Picadorem&quot; café on 29 November. With Julian Tuwim and Antoni Słonimski, he founded the &quot;Skamander&quot; group of experimental poets in 1919.

He was appointed to be secretary of Maciej Rataj, marshal of the &quot;Sejm&quot; of the Second Polish Republic and served in that capacity in 1923–1925. Iwaszkiewicz worked for a magazine called &quot;Wiadomości Literackie&quot; (&#x27;The Literary News&#x27;) in 1924–1939; he also published his works in numerous periodicals, including &quot;Gazeta Polska&quot; (1934–1938) and &quot;Ateneum&quot; (1938–1939). He was secretary to the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts (&quot;Towarzystwo Zachęty Sztuk Pięknych&quot;) and from 1925 a member of the Polish PEN Club. From 1927 with the Foreign Ministry, first appointed the head of the art promotion section of the Press Department and later sent as secretary of the Polish mission to Copenhagen (1932–1935) and Brussels (1935–1936). He was a member of The Trade Union of Polish Writers (&quot;Związek Zawodowy Literatów Polskich&quot;, ZZLP) and in 1939 voted its vice-president.

During World War II, Iwaszkiewicz participated in the Polish Underground State&#x27;s activities, working in the Department of Education, Science and Culture of the Government Delegation for Poland. He collaborated with Prof. Stanisław Lorentz in his efforts to protect and rescue Poland&#x27;s works of art. Iwaszkiewicz and his wife Anna had extensive contacts within the Jewish-Polish intelligentsia circles and assisted their former neighbors, friends and acquaintances in a variety of ways during the German occupation of Poland. Iwaszkiewicz family&#x27;s &quot;Villa Stawisko&quot; residence served as a hiding place for many Jews and Poles who faced the threat of being arrested by Nazi Germans, especially after the fall of the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. At one time, more than 40 people were sheltered in the mansion. During the war, &quot;Stawisko&quot; also functioned as a center of Polish underground literature and art.

In 1945–1946, 1947–1949 and 1959–1980, Iwaszkiewicz served as head of the Polish Writers&#x27; Union. In 1945–1949 and 1955–1957 he was literary manager of the Polish Theatre in Warsaw. From March 1947 to December 1949, he published the &quot;Nowiny literackie&quot; (&#x27;Literary News&#x27;) magazine. Beginning in 1956, for many years he was chief editor of the monthly &quot;Twórczość&quot; (&#x27;Creativity&#x27;). Vice-president of the Polish PEN Club in 1950–1965.

Iwaszkiewicz was an organizer of the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace held in Wrocław in 1948 and a delegate to the World Peace Congress in 1950.

He served as a nonpartisan member of parliament from 1952 until his death in 1980. In his last three terms, he was the Senior Marshal of the &quot;Sejm&quot;. Iwaszkiewicz wrote of his deeply socialist convictions, but was ambivalent and privately bitter about the political reality of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, within which he officially functioned. Nevertheless, he was greatly impressed by the appreciation note that he received from Bolesław Bierut on the 40th anniversary of Iwaszkiewicz&#x27;s literary career. In 1956, he was thrilled by the Polish October events. After a conversation with Edward Ochab in 1961, Iwaszkiewicz wrote: &quot;They blame me for not having done anything as a member of the &quot;Sejm&quot;, but then they want me to be a deputy again&quot;. He continued his lifelong habit of making many foreign trips.

Iwaszkiewicz wrote novels and short stories, poems, dramatic works, essays and columns, and translations from French, English, Russian and Danish literatures. His major epic novel is &quot;Sława i Chwała&quot; (&#x27;Fame and Glory&#x27;) – a panorama of life of Polish intelligentsia in the first half of the 20th century. In particular, he is highly regarded for his short stories, a genre he developed and modernized. Using changing forms and themes, throughout his career Iwaszkiewicz produced collections of poems of major significance. He wrote plays based on classical motifs and many miscellaneous pieces reflecting his interests and pursuits in areas such as music and theatre, travel, and popularization of culture.

In 1936, Iwaszkiewicz won the Golden Laurel (Polish: &quot;Złoty Wawrzyn&quot;) conferred by the Polish Academy of Literature. He was twice awarded the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland (1946 and 1947) and also the Order of the Builders of People&#x27;s Poland in 1954. In 1955, he became the recipient of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic and the Medal of the 10th Anniversary of People&#x27;s Poland. In 1970, he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize. In 1974, Edward Gierek awarded him with the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. He received honorary doctorates from the University of Warsaw in 1971 and the Jagiellonian University in 1979, as well as numerous other Polish, foreign and international awards and distinctions. However, Iwaszkiewicz&#x27;s works were removed in Poland from school recommended readings after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc. They have since been regaining the recognition of their value and rank.

Czesław Miłosz wrote the following: &quot;Iwaszkiewicz is a great figure and nobody who deals with Polish literature can omit him. Even if some parts of his huge literary output are excluded, there is enough left, also as a testimony to the three epochs, to secure for him a place higher than that of any of his contemporaries&quot;. He concluded, &quot;One is almost inclined to believe that some people are gripped by circumstances meant for them, and that for him the good fortunes, after his impoverished youth, began in the interwar period, to endure also later&quot;. For Miłosz could not imagine Iwaszkiewicz as an &quot;émigré&quot; personality.

Iwaszkiewicz died on 2 March 1980 and was buried on 5 March at the cemetery in Brwinów near Warsaw, according to his last wish in a miner&#x27;s uniform.

==Personal life==

In 1922, Iwaszkiewicz married Anna Lilpop (1897–1979), a writer and translator and daughter of Stanisław Wilhelm Lilpop, a wealthy entrepreneur. The couple settled in Podkowa Leśna near Warsaw. In 1928, they moved to a newly built villa that Iwaszkiewicz named &quot;Stawisko&quot;. It currently houses a museum devoted to Iwaszkiewicz and his wife. They had two daughters: Maria (1924–2019) and Teresa (1928–2012). Iwaszkiewicz was bisexual and homoerotic; those themes are present in his poetry and prose works. In his diaries he describes himself as a &quot;homosexual&quot;; however, in light of the current understanding of human sexual orientation and his biography, he can be characterized as a bisexual. Iwaszkiewicz experienced and described a particularly intense relationship with a younger man terminally ill with tuberculosis; it commenced when the writer was over sixty years old. His wife always &quot;knew of all of his affections&quot;.

In 2012, his great-granddaughter Ludwika Włodek wrote a best-selling biographical book about the life of her great-grandfather, titled &quot;Pra&quot;.

<text>The North American Indoor Football League (NAIFL) was a proposed indoor football league that announced plans in 2004 to begin play in fourteen Canadian cities beginning in February 2005. The game played was to be a unique indoor version of Canadian football. Teams were to be centrally owned, and former Edmonton Eskimos quarterback Tom Wilkinson was to serve as league president. The league never played a single game and its website went offline in early 2006.

The 14 teams announced were:

East Division

<doc id="891315" wikidata="Q1422986" url="?curid=891315" title="Skamander">
<text>Skamander was a Polish group of experimental poets founded in 1918 by Julian Tuwim, Antoni Słonimski, Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, Kazimierz Wierzyński and Jan Lechoń. Initially unnamed, in December 1919 it adopted the name &quot;Skamander&quot;, after the Scamander River in Asia Minor. It gave its name to the monthly review it published from 1920.

==History==
The group was initially closely related to the &quot;Pro Arte et Studio&quot; literary monthly and the &quot;Pod Picadorem&quot; (Picador) Café in Warsaw. In 1920 it created its own publication, the &quot;Skamander&quot; monthly, though its members also collaborated with &quot;Wiadomości Literackie&quot; (Literary News) and other newspapers.

The young poets were heavily influenced by Leopold Staff and other neoromantic poets. Their main aims were to break the links between history and poetry and to end the nationalist and patriotic functions of Polish poetry. They also emphasized the need to restore poetry to the common people by returning to everyday-language usage in poetry, including colloquialisms, neologisms and vulgarisms. Finally, the &quot;Skamandrites&quot; (&quot;Skamandryci&quot;) emphasized the beauty of everyday life and of all forms of life generally, including the biological side.

In contrast to the basic aims of the late-19th-century Young Poland movement, Skamander&#x27;s members eschewed semi-mythological heroes and protagonists, replacing them with common people. In contrast to the contemporary &quot;Awangarda Krakowska&quot; (Kraków Avant-Garde) movement, they saw themselves as continuers of Polish literary traditions, especially those of romanticism and neoromanticism.

Apart from the movement&#x27;s five chief members, several lesser-known poets and critics adhered to its principles. They included Kazimiera Iłłakowiczówna, Stanisław Baliński, Gabriel Michał Karski, Światopełk Karpiński, Jerzy Paczkowski, Karol Zawodziński and Wilam Horzyca.

<doc id="891318" wikidata="Q4906396" url="?curid=891318" title="Big South Fork of the Cumberland River">
<text>The Big South Fork of the Cumberland River is a river in the U.S. states of Tennessee and Kentucky. It is a major drainage feature of the Cumberland Plateau, a major tributary of the Cumberland River system, and the major feature of the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area.

==Physical geography==
The Big South Fork begins at the confluence of the New River and the Clear Fork in Scott County, Tennessee, and flows northwest, northeast, and north until ending at Lake Cumberland in McCreary County, Kentucky, near the town of Burnside. It is the third largest tributary of the Cumberland River, and is free flowing for a distance of approximately before being affected by the headwaters of the lake.

The terrain furthest upstream near the confluence is the most rugged, with reliefs of as much as . This area is characterized by dendritic draining patterns and narrow gorges, with valleys strewn with large boulders fallen from cliffs above. Major formations include natural arches, mesas, chimneys, cracks and rock shelters. The terrain becomes less rugged as the river travels northward, with reliefs of between and .

Soil in the area is divided between two groups. The first is primarily made up of Ramsey, Hartsells, Grimsley, and Gilpin soils and is located adjacent to the river gorge. The second consists of Hartsells, Lonewood, Ramsey, and Gilpin soils and is found on the nearby plateau.

===Hydrology===

The river draws water from a drainage basin of Carboniferous rock in the Cumberland Plateau. Taken together, the Big South Fork and its tributaries drain between and , of which about 17% is covered by the associated National Recreation Area.

The maximum recorded water flow on the Big South Fork was , the minimum recorded was , and the river averages a flow of . Around half of the Big South Fork&#x27;s annual streamflow occurs during the months of January through March, and the lowest streamflow typically occurs during September and October.

Along the river basin, water drops from a maximum original elevation of above sea level at Peter&#x27;s Bridge on the Clear Fork, to where the waters meet the Cumberland. Between the confluence of the New River and Clear Fork, and Leatherwood Ford the river has an average gradient across of 20 feet per mile (fpm), and a maximum gradient of 40 fpm.

Major tributaries of the Big South Fork include:
*New River
*Clear Fork River
*North Whiteoak Creek
*Pine Creek
*Station Camp Creek
*Parch Corn Creek
*No Business Creek
*Williams Creek
*Troublesome Creek
*Bear Creek
*Roaring Paunch Creek
*Rock Creek
*Wolf Creek
*Kogar Creek
Water quality is generally good, but may be negatively affected by mine drainage, logging, poor road quality, and ground disturbances. The river contains about two times as much suspended and dissolved solids at a comparable river basin which does not have a history of mining. Both Tennessee and Kentucky have designated their respective portions of the Big South Fork as Outstanding National Resource Waters, and cleanup and reclamation efforts by a number of organizations have been made.

==History==
It is likely that the area surrounding the Big South Fork was frequented by Paleo-Indians, which continued up until early colonial times, although it is not clear that the area was permanently inhabited by prehistoric peoples. No intensive surveys of archaeological sites had been conducted as of 1977, when the Army Corps of Engineers published their comprehensive study of the area, although one study from the University of Tennessee along with one inter-agency governmental report had identified 21 total sites. A 2005 report by the National Park Service however estimated a total of 10,000 archaeological sites, evenly split between pre and post European contact.

The first permanent European settlement was likely in 1769 in modern-day Wayne County, Kentucky. By 1798, the Treaty of Tellico had officially expelled the native Cherokee peoples from the river basin, although the land, which was not well suited to agriculture, was mostly passed over by settlers until the founding of the ultimately failed colony of Rugby, Tennessee, by Thomas Hughes in the 1880s.

===Blue Heron===

The mining community of modern-day Blue Heron, Kentucky, was established in 1937 along the banks of the Big South Fork, and operated until 1962 when it was abandoned by the Stearns Coal and Lumber Company. The site was later recreated in the 1980s and reopened as an outdoor museum.

===National River and Recreation Area===
The Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area was established by the United States Congress as part of the Water Resources Development Act of 1974. According to the text of the act, the purpose of the establishment was for:

conserving and interpreting an area containing unique cultural, historic, geologic, fish and wildlife, archeologic, scenic, and recreational values, preserving as a natural, free-flowing stream the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River, major portions of its Clear Fork and New River stems, and portions of their various tributaries for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations, the preservation of the natural integrity of the scenic gorges and valleys, and the development of the area’s potential for healthful outdoor recreation.

The legislation granted authority for land acquisition to the Army Corps of Engineers, and for managing the area to the United States Secretary of the Interior once established. Congress authorized final transfer of the land to the National Park Service in 1990, and the official dedication of the park occurred on August 25, 1991.

==Ecology==
The Big South Fork and its watershed is home to a large variety of plant and animal species, and has likely been continuously vegetated since before the last glacial period, ending approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Habitats range from floodplains, to coves, as well as ravines, moist slopes, and sandstone caprock. The area is home to between 68 and 81 species of fish, 23 species of mussels, and up to 215 individual taxa of macro invertebrates.

===Animal life===
Fish species include &quot;Ictalurus punctatus&quot; (channel catfish), &quot;Stizostedion vitreum&quot; (walleye), &quot;Esox masquinongy&quot; (muskellunge), &quot;Morone chrysops&quot; (white bass), &quot;Ambloplites rupestris&quot; (rock bass), and &quot;Lepomis megalotis&quot; (longear sunfish).

The availability of “seeds, berries, nuts, buds, flowers, fleshy roots and twigs” encourages the presence of species such as the &quot;Bonasa umbellus&quot; (ruffed grouse), &quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot; (turkey), &quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot; (eastern gray squirrel). Food available in canopy vegetation supports &quot;Vireo olivaceus&quot; (red-eyed vireo), &quot;Wilsonia citrina&quot; (hooded warbler), &quot;Setophaga ruticilla&quot; (American redstart), &quot;Sorex fumeus&quot; (smoky shrew), &quot;Scalopus aquaticus&quot; (eastern mole), &quot;Neotoma floridana&quot; (eastern woodrat), and &quot;Peromyscus leucopus&quot; (white-footed mouse). These species in turn provide food for predatory birds such as &quot;Strix varia&quot; (barred owl) and &quot;Buteo lineatus&quot; (red-shouldered hawk).

During the 1990s, 14 adult female and 16 black bear cubs were reintroduced to the river basin, relocated from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. As of 2013, genetic analysis estimated the bear population in the area to be at 245.

===Plant life===
The plant life along the river and in the surrounding basin can be divided into plateau and ravine communities consisting of mixed oak forests along with areas of mixed mesophytic vegetation. Forests of sugar maple, along with beech and yellow birch are found in low moist slopes, and &quot;Tsuga canadensis&quot; (Canadian hemlock) along with undergrowth of &quot;Rhododendron maximum&quot; grow in coves along streams. Communities of various species of pine may also be found.

As the result of logging in the mid 20th century, most of the areas consists of 2nd or 3rd growth forest.

==Whitewater==

Whitewater rafting and kayaking occur on the Big South Fork mostly in the Spring season. Available runs range in distance from to , and vary in difficulty between classes I and IV according to the international scale of river difficulty. The most popular runs are those upstream from Leatherwood Ford, ranging from to in distance and between class I and IV in difficulty depending on put-in. The minimum water flow recommended by the National Park Service for rafting is 800 cfs, with a maximum flow of 10,000 cfs for safe rafting.

Moving downstream from the confluence to Lake Cumberland, named rapids according to the National Park Service are:
# Double Falls
# Washing Machine
# The Ell
# Rion&#x27;s Eddy
# Jake&#x27;s Hold
# O&amp;W Rapid
# Angel Falls
# Big Shoals
# Devil&#x27;s Jump

<text>Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps (commonly referred to as &quot;Phantom&quot;) is a World Class competitive junior drum and bugle corps based in Rockford, Illinois, USA. The corps is a long-standing member of Drum Corps International (DCI), having been a DCI World Championship Top Twelve Finalist every year since 1974 and DCI World Champions in 1996 (tie) and 2008.

== History ==
The corps was founded in 1956 by Alex Haddad, a member of the Col. Thomas G. Lawler VFW Post 342. Under his direction, the corps was named the Rockford Rangers, with all-male drum and bugle sections and an all-female color guard named the Rangerettes. However, when many of the charter members were impressed by the recording of the Syracuse Brigadiers performing the Leroy Anderson composition &quot;The Phantom Regiment&quot;, the corps&#x27; name was changed before the unit made its debut, with the color guard renamed the Phantomettes.

In the corps&#x27; early years, the Phantomettes and a corps-sponsored all-boy color guard called the Raiders were competitively successful. The drum and bugle corps, however, struggled. In 1962, the corps bought a set of high quality bugles that had belonged to the Commonwealth Edison Knights of Light Drum and Bugle Corps which had folded two years earlier. With the new instruments and a new brass arranger, the corps began to improve. The old set of bugles went to the newly formed Phantom Regiment Cadets.

Despite the Phantomettes having placed second at the 1962 color guard national championships, in 1963, Phantom Regiment fielded an all-male corps, including the color guard. When scores fell behind those of the previous season, the Phantomettes returned to the corps for 1964. With the girls back in the corps, successful recruitment, and new uniforms, the corps had its best season until that time, including a finish of 15th among 45 corps at the VFW National Championship preliminaries in Cleveland. The Phantomettes were honored in the graphic on the City of Rockford&#x27;s 1964 vehicle registration stickers. But on August 21, 1964, Regimental Hall, the corps&#x27; home base, was badly damaged by a fire. The organization was forced to sell its instruments and uniforms to pay off its debts.

Financially unable to field a corps in 1965 through 1967, alumni and former staff members reorganized and officially incorporated on September 11, 1967. At the first meeting of the newly restructured corps in January, there were 28 members. The Regiment&#x27;s 1968 drum and horn lines dressed in black pants and a red windbreaker with a black and white vertical stripe on the left side; the guard wore the same windbreaker, black Bermuda shorts and an &quot;Aussie&quot; style hat. The season consisted mostly of parades, with few field contests. The corps owned one vehicle; a red step van to carry the equipment. In that first year of the corps&#x27; return, perhaps the corps&#x27; greatest asset was its new musical arranger, Phantom Regiment alumnus and future DCI Hall of Fame member, Jim Wren, who would go on to arrange the unit&#x27;s brass music for the next 32 years.

By 1970, Phantom was able to outfit the corps in new uniforms; a cadet-style jacket with a red diagonal sash dividing the black right side from the white left side, black pants with a white stripe, white buck shoes, and a shako with a 12-inch plume. The corps had grown to 89 members with 40 horns, 14 drums, 24 flags, 12 rifles, and a drum major.

In 1971, Wren started adding the classical music pieces that would become Phantom&#x27;s trademark along with the usual pop music that most corps were playing. On a Friday the 13th in that year, so the legend goes, all of the corps&#x27; buses ran out of fuel; the equipment truck caught fire, not just once, but twice; yet the corps went out and won that night&#x27;s contest.

Prior to the founding of DCI in 1972, the Phantom Regiment, like most corps of the time, was strictly a local organization. The members and the staff came from Rockford and its surrounding suburbs. Travel to contests was limited to perhaps a few hours of driving. The only &quot;National&quot; competition the corps had ever entered had been the 1964 VFW championships in Cleveland. The corps attended the first DCI competition, in Whitewater, Wisconsin, placing 23rd of 39 corps in prelims. In 1973, The corps returned to Whitewater and moved up to 14th place among 48 corps.

In 1974, Phantom presented its first full program of all-classical musical selections. The corps had grown to DCI&#x27;s maximum of 128 members, and it took its first extended tour, travelling to Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts en route to the DCI Championships in Ithaca, New York. The corps was beating many of the activity&#x27;s traditional powers and earning a reputation as a power in its own right. At DCI, the Regiment earned its first Top Twelve Finalist placement, beginning a string that has held through 2024. In prelims, the corps shocked many by placing 8th, although they fell back to 11th at Finals.

Once the corps became a DCI Finalist, it also became become a consistent contender, placing 10th in 1975, 4th in 1976, and having a frustrating run of second-place finishes in 1977, 1978 and 1979 with the corps scoring within tenths of a point from the title.

A fall to a 10th-place finish in 1986 led the corps to take a new approach. Three years of improvement, culminated in 1989 with another second-place finish, with Phantom&#x27;s score of 98.400 tying the previous DCI highest score ever.

From 1975, Phantom Regiment&#x27;s field visual shows had been designed by Norm Wheeler through 1979, when in 1980 future DCI Hall of Fame member John Brazale would move from Color Guard caption Head to Visual program Design Caption. Returning home after the 1992 DCI Championships, Brazale had complained of having severe headaches during the last few weeks, and was soon diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, and died within months.

In 1996, Phantom Regiment tied the Blue Devils of Concord, California for its first DCI World Championship. Jim Wren arranged for the corps from 1967 through the 1999 season, and then retired as the corps&#x27; musical arranger. Michael Klesch took over arranging duties in 2000 and 2001, and was then followed by alumnus J.D. Shaw, who arranged the corps&#x27; music from the 2002 season through the 2011 season. After spending the 2012–2019 seasons with the Santa Clara Vanguard, J.D. Shaw returned to Phantom Regiment after the 2019 season.

In 2008, with its performance of &quot;Spartacus&quot;, Phantom Regiment defeated the Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps by a margin of 0.025 to win its second (and first outright) DCI World Championship.

Through 2019, Phantom Regiment has continued to be a DCI Finalist with the streak extending through 45 consecutive top-12 finishes. In 2022, the first year of competition since the COVID-19 Pandemic, Phantom Regiment returned with their highest placement since 2016, and highest score since 2014.

<text>Bernard Roy Frieden (born September 10, 1936) is an American mathematical physicist. He is an emeritus professor of optical sciences at the University of Arizona.

==Education and career==
Frieden grew up in Brooklyn, New York, where his father was part-owner of the Empire Mirror Works until the collapse of the business in 1948. After a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from Brooklyn College, he received a master&#x27;s degree at the University of Pennsylvania in 1959.

He worked for General Electric and then in Rochester, New York for Bausch &amp; Lomb, but found himself jobless in 1962, when the project he worked for was disbanded. He returned to graduate study in The Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester, and completed his Ph.D. in 1966. His doctoral thesis advisor was Robert E. Hopkins.

He joined the University of Arizona faculty as an assistant professor in 1966, and remained there for the rest of his career, retiring as a professor emeritus in 2002.

==Research and recognition==
Frieden is known for his pioneering work on laser beam shaping and was among the first to investigate the optical transfer function of a three-dimensional object. He was the first to apply Jaynes&#x27; maximum entropy principle to image restoration.

He was elected a Fellow of the Optical Society of America, now known as Optica, in 1975; in 1988, he was elected a Fellow of SPIE.

<doc id="891337" wikidata="Q3043499" url="?curid=891337" title="Papal renunciation">
<text>A papal renunciation () also called a papal abdication, occurs when the current pope of the Catholic Church voluntarily resigns his position. As a pope&#x27;s time in office has conventionally lasted from his election until his death, a papal renunciation is an uncommon event. Before the 21st century, only five popes unambiguously resigned with historical certainty, all between the 10th and 15th centuries. Additionally, there are disputed claims of four popes having resigned, dating from the 3rd to the 11th centuries; a fifth disputed case may have involved an antipope.

Additionally, a few popes during the &quot;saeculum obscurum&quot; were &quot;deposed&quot;, meaning driven from office by force. The history and canonical question here is complicated; generally, the official Vatican list of popes seems to recognize such &quot;depositions&quot; as valid renunciations if the pope acquiesced, but not if he did not. The later development of canon law has been in favor of papal supremacy, leaving no recourse to the removal of a pope involuntarily.

The most recent pope to resign was Benedict XVI, who vacated the Holy See on 28 February 2013, the date of his effective resignation. He was the first pope to do so since Gregory XII in 1415.

Despite its common usage in discussion of papal renunciations, the term &quot;abdication&quot; is not used in the official documents of the church for renunciation by a pope.

== Modern procedure ==
In the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, the official laws on all matters are codified in the Latin edition of the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;. This regulates papal renunciations in canon 332 §2, where it states:

* &quot;Si contingat ut Romanus Pontifex muneri suo renuntiet, ad validitatem requiritur ut renuntiatio libere fiat et rite manifestetur, non vero ut a quopiam acceptetur.&quot; (In English: If it happens that the Roman Pontiff resigns his office, it is required for validity that the resignation be made freely and properly manifested but not that it is accepted by anyone.)

This corresponds to canon 221 of the 1917 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;, which in Latin is:

* &quot;Si contingat ut Romanus Pontifex renuntiet, ad eiusdem renuntiationis validitatem non est necessaria Cardinalium aliorumve acceptatio.&quot; (In English: If it happens that the Roman Pontiff resigns his office, it is not required for validity that the resignation is accepted by the Cardinals or by anyone else.)

Both the 1983 code and the 1917 code make explicit that there is no particular individual or body of people to whom the pope must manifest his renunciation. This addresses a concern raised in earlier centuries, specifically by 18th-century canonist Lucius Ferraris, who held that the College of Cardinals or at least its Dean must be informed, since the cardinals must be absolutely certain that the pope has renounced the dignity before they can validly proceed to elect a successor.

In 1996, Pope John Paul II, in his Apostolic Constitution &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot;, anticipated the possibility of resignation when he specified that the procedures he set out in that document should be observed &quot;even if the vacancy of the Apostolic See should occur as a result of the resignation of the Supreme Pontiff&quot;.

==History==
The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; notes the historically obscure renunciations of Pontian (230–235) and Marcellinus (296–308), the historically postulated renunciation of Liberius (352–366), and mentions that one (unspecified) catalogue of popes lists John XVIII as resigning office in 1009 and finishing his life as a monk.
=== 11th century===
The first historically unquestionable papal renunciation is that of Benedict IX in 1045. Benedict had also previously been deposed by Sylvester III in 1044, and though he returned to take up the office again the next year, the Vatican considers Sylvester III to have been a legitimate pope in the intervening months (meaning that Benedict IX must be considered to have validly resigned by acquiescing to the deposition in 1044). Then, in 1045, having regained the papacy for a few months, in order to rid the church of the scandalous Benedict, Gregory VI gave Benedict &quot;valuable possessions&quot; to resign the papacy in his favour. Gregory himself resigned in 1046 because the arrangement he had entered into with Benedict could have been considered simony. Gregory was followed by Clement II, and when Clement died, Benedict IX returned to be elected to the papacy for a third time, only to resign yet again before dying in a monastery. He was thus pope for three non-consecutive periods of time, and either resigned or was deposed three times.

=== Celestine V ===
A well-known renunciation of a pope is that of Celestine V, in 1294. After only five months as pope, he issued a solemn decree declaring it permissible for a pope to resign, and then did so himself. He lived two more years as a hermit and then prisoner of his successor Boniface VIII, and was later canonised. Celestine&#x27;s decree, and Boniface concurring (not revoking it), ended any doubt among canonists about the possibility of a valid papal renunciation.

=== Western Schism ===
Gregory XII (1406–1415) resigned in 1415 in order to end the Western Schism, which had reached the point where there were three claimants to the papal throne: Roman Pope Gregory XII, Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII, and Pisan Antipope John XXIII. Before resigning, he formally convened the already existing Council of Constance and authorized it to elect his successor.

===Benedict XVI===

Benedict XVI&#x27;s renunciation of the papacy took effect on 28 February 2013 at 20:00 (8:00 pm) CET (19:00 UTC), after being announced on the morning of 11 February by the Vatican. He was the first pope to relinquish the office since Gregory XII resigned to end the Western Schism in 1415 and the first to do so on his own initiative since Celestine V in 1294. His action was unexpected, given that the modern era popes have held the position from election until death. He said he was motivated by his declining health due to old age. The conclave to select his successor began on 12 March 2013 and elected Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Archbishop of Buenos Aires, who took the name &quot;Francis&quot;.

==List of papal renunciations==
== Conditional renunciations not put into effect ==
Before setting out for Paris to crown Napoleon in 1804, Pope Pius VII (1800–1823) signed a document of renunciation to take effect if he were imprisoned in France.

During World War II, Pope Pius XII drew up a document ordering that his resignation take effect immediately if he were kidnapped by the Nazis, as was thought likely in August 1943. It was thought that the College of Cardinals would evacuate to a neutral country, perhaps Portugal, and elect his successor.

According to longtime curial official Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, Pope Paul VI handwrote two letters in the late 1960s or 1970, well before his death, in anticipation of an incapacitating illness. One letter was addressed to the College of Cardinals, the other to the Secretary of State, whose name was not specified. Pope John Paul II showed them to Re, and they were shown to Pope Benedict XVI in 2003. In 2018, Paul&#x27;s letter dated 2 May 1965 and addressed to the dean of the College of Cardinals was published. He wrote that &quot;In case of infirmity, which is believed to be incurable or is of long duration and which impedes us from sufficiently exercising the functions of our apostolic ministry; or in the case of another serious and prolonged impediment&quot;, he renounced his office &quot;both as bishop of Rome as well as head of the same holy Catholic Church&quot;.

Pope John Paul II wrote a letter in 1989 offering to resign if he became incapacitated. The first said that if ill health or some other unforeseen difficulty prevented him from &quot;sufficiently carrying out the functions of my apostolic ministry … I renounce my sacred and canonical office, both as bishop of Rome as well as head of the holy Catholic Church.&quot; In 1994 he wrote a document that he apparently planned to read aloud, which explained that he had determined he could not resign merely because of age, as other bishops are required to do, but only &quot;in the presence of an incurable illness or an impediment&quot;, and that he would therefore continue in office. He prayed in his will, written in 2000, that God &quot;would help me to recognise how long I must continue this service&quot;, suggesting that renunciation was possible. In the weeks before his death in 2005, there was press speculation that John Paul might resign because of his failing health.

== Incapacitation ==
Canon law makes no provision for a pope being incapacitated by reason of health, either temporarily or permanently; nor does it specify what body has the authority to certify that the pope is incapacitated. It does state that &quot;When the Roman See is vacant, or completely impeded, no innovation is to be made in the governance of the universal Church.&quot;

<doc id="891345" wikidata="Q4865594" url="?curid=891345" title="Barton Booth">
<text>Barton Booth (168210 May 1733) was one of the most famous dramatic actors of the first part of the 18th century.

== Early life ==
Booth was the son of The Hon and Very Revd Dr Robert Booth, Dean of Bristol, by his first wife and distant cousin Ann Booth, daughter of Sir Robert Booth, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and was educated at Westminster School, where his success in the Roman comedy &quot;Andria&quot; gave him a gave him an inclination for the stage. He was intended for the church, and to attend Trinity College, Cambridge; but in 1698 he ran away and obtained employment in a theatrical company in Dublin, where he made his first appearance as the title character in Aphra Behn&#x27;s &quot;Oroonoko&quot;.

==London success==
After two seasons in Ireland he returned to London, where Thomas Betterton, who had previously failed to help him, probably out of regard for Booth&#x27;s family, now gave him all the assistance in his power. At the Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields Theatre (1700–1704) he first appeared as Maximus in &quot;Valentinian&quot;, and his success was immediate. He was at the Haymarket with Betterton from 1705 to 1708, and for the next twenty years at Drury Lane. In 1713 he joint-managed the theater with Thomas Doggett, Colley Cibber, and Robert Wilks. After his death on 10 May 1733, Booth was buried in St Laurence Cowley near Uxbridge in Middlesex. His widow had a memorial to Booth placed in Westminster Abbey in 1772. This was created by William Tyler RA.

==Roles==
His greatest parts, after the title part of Joseph Addison&#x27;s &quot;Cato&quot;, which established his reputation as a tragedian, were probably Hotspur and Brutus. His &quot;King Lear&quot; was deemed worthy of comparison with David Garrick&#x27;s. As the ghost in &quot;Hamlet&quot; he is said never to have had a superior. Among his other Shakespearian rôles were Mark Antony, Timon of Athens and Othello. He also played to perfection Lothario in Nicholas Rowe&#x27;s &quot;The Fair Penitent&quot;. He also starred in Rowe&#x27;s tragedies &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1705) as Telemachus and &quot;The Royal Convert&quot; (1707) as Hengist, King of Kent. In 1710 he starred as Athelwold in Aaron Hill&#x27;s &quot;Elfrid&quot;. He starred as Coriolanus in the 1719 play &quot;The Invader of His Country&quot; by John Dennis. In 1724 he featured in John Gay&#x27;s tragedy &quot;The Captives&quot; as Sophernes.

Booth was twice married; his second wife, Hester Santlow, a noted actress, survived him. He was a &quot;poet and acholar as well as actor, and certainly a man of genius...&quot;

== Death ==
From 1727, Booth was afflicted by ill health and in 1733 eventually called for Thomas Dover, &quot;Doctor Quicksilver&quot;, who prescribed him quicksilver. He ingested 2 pounds of mercury and died in a week.

&quot;I endeavour&#x27;d to divide the Rectum and tie it , but it was so rotten that it broke between my Fingers like Tinder , and sent forth &quot;a most offensive cadaverous Stench...&quot;&quot;

The whole intestinal track on the inside was covered with black balls of mercury the size of pinheads. This famous case greatly reduced the medicinal use of elemental mercury.

<text>Dobri Bozhilov Khadzhiyanakev () (June 13, 1884 – February 1, 1945) was Prime Minister of Bulgaria during World War II.
==Biography==
Born in Kotel, Bulgaria, Bozhilov attended the Higher Commercial School in Svishtov before starting work as a bookkeeper at the Bulgarian National Bank for the Kyustendil Banking Agency in 1902. Bozhilov worked for the Bulgarian National Bank for a total of 36 years and served at various times as its governor (1922-1923, 1923-1924, 1931-1932, 1934-1935, 1935-1938, 1944).

In November 1938, Bozhilov became Minister of Finance in the government of Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov, a position which Bozhilov kept when Bogdan Filov became prime minister in 1940. In 1943, after Tsar Boris III died, Filov became one of Bulgaria’s three regents. Filov, a fervent ally of Nazi Germany and the most powerful of the regents, used his power to appoint Bozhilov (another pro-German) prime minister.

As prime minister, Bozhilov worked closely with the Germans, virtually becoming their puppet as World War II raged. Essentially the only major issue on which he clashed with the Nazis was their demand for Bulgaria’s government to deport the country’s Jews to extermination camps, which Bozhilov refused to do. In June 1944, at which time the Axis war effort was rapidly deteriorating, Bozhilov resigned as prime minister and returned to the Bulgarian National Bank, once again becoming its governor. In September 1944, the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria and invaded it, giving Communist partisans the opportunity to overthrow Prime Minister Konstantin Muraviev and replace him with Kimon Georgiev. Bozhilov was subsequently arrested and tried by a People’s Court instituted by the Fatherland Front government. He was found guilty of war crimes and a variety of misdeeds he had committed while finance minister, sentenced to death, and executed in February 1945. The verdict was revoked in 1996 by Supreme Court.

<text>Albert Bruce Sabin ( ; born Abram Saperstejn; August 26, 1906 – March 3, 1993) was a Polish-American medical researcher, best known for developing the oral polio vaccine, which has played a key role in nearly eradicating the disease. In 1969–72, he served as the president of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.

== Biography ==
Abram Saperstejn was born in Białystok, Russian Empire (before and since 1918 in Poland), to Polish-Jewish parents, Jacob Saperstejn and Tillie Krugman. In 1921, he emigrated with his family on the SS &quot;Lapland&quot; which sailed from Antwerp to the Port of New York. In 1930, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States and changed his name to Albert Bruce Sabin. He graduated from high school in Paterson, New Jersey.

Sabin began university in a dentistry program, but was interested in virology and changed majors. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in science in 1928 and a medical degree in 1931 from New York University.

In 1983, Sabin developed calcification of the cervical spine, which caused paralysis and intense pain. Sabin revealed in a television interview that the experience had made him decide to spend the rest of his life working on alleviating pain. This condition was successfully treated by surgery conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1992 when Sabin was 86. A year later, Sabin died in Washington, D.C., from heart failure.

==Medical career==
Sabin trained in internal medicine, pathology, and surgery at Bellevue Hospital in New York City from 1931 to 1933. In 1934, he conducted research at The Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine in England, then joined the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University). During this time, he developed an intense interest in research, especially in the area of infectious diseases.

In 1939, he moved to Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. During World War II, he was a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and helped develop a vaccine against Japanese encephalitis. Maintaining his association with Children&#x27;s Hospital, by 1946, he had also become the head of Pediatric Research at the University of Cincinnati. At Cincinnati&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital, Sabin supervised the fellowship of Robert M. Chanock, whom he called his &quot;star scientific son&quot;.

Sabin went on a fact-finding trip to Cuba in 1967 to discuss with Cuban officials the possibility of establishing a collaborative relationship between the United States and Cuba through their respective national academies of sciences, in spite of the fact that the two countries did not have formal diplomatic ties.

In 1969–72, he lived in Israel, serving as president of Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. After his return to the United States, he worked (1974–82) as a research professor at the Medical University of South Carolina. He later moved to the Washington, D.C., area, where he was a resident scholar at the John E. Fogarty International Center on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.

==Polio research==

With the menace of polio growing, Sabin and other researchers, most notably Jonas Salk in Pittsburgh and Hilary Koprowski and H. R. Cox in New York City and Philadelphia, respectively, sought a vaccine to prevent or mitigate the illness. This was complicated because there were multiple strains of the disease. In 1951, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis&#x27;s typing program confirmed the existence of three main serotypes of poliovirus, since known as type 1, type 2, and type 3.

Salk developed an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), a &quot;dead&quot; vaccine given by injection, which was released for use in 1955. 
It was effective in preventing most of the complications of polio, but did not prevent the initial intestinal infection.

By carrying out autopsies of polio victims, Sabin was able to demonstrate that the poliovirus multiplied and attacked the intestines before it moved to the central nervous system. This also suggested that polio virus could be grown in other tissues besides embryonic brain tissue, leading to easier and cheaper methods of vaccine development. John Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller, and Frederick Robbins would successfully grow poliovirus in laboratory cultures of non-nerve tissue in 1949, an achievement that earned them the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Sabin developed an oral vaccine based on mutant strains of polio virus that seemed to stimulate antibody production but not to cause paralysis. Recipients of his live attenuated oral vaccine included himself, family, and colleagues. Sabin&#x27;s first clinical trials were carried out at the Chillicothe Ohio Reformatory in late 1954. From 1956–1960, he worked with Russian colleagues to perfect the oral vaccine and prove its extraordinary effectiveness and safety. The Sabin vaccine worked in the intestines to block the poliovirus from entering the bloodstream.

Between 1955 and 1961, the oral vaccine was tested on at least 100 million people in the USSR, parts of Eastern Europe, Singapore, Mexico, and the Netherlands. The first industrial production and mass use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) from Sabin strains was organized by Soviet scientist Mikhail Chumakov. This provided the critical impetus for allowing large-scale clinical trials of OPV in the United States in April 1960 on 180,000 Cincinnati school children. The mass immunization techniques that Sabin pioneered with his associates effectively eradicated polio in Cincinnati. Against considerable opposition from the March of Dimes Foundation, which supported use of Salk&#x27;s relatively effective killed vaccine, Sabin prevailed on the Public Health Service (PHS) to license his three strains of vaccine. While the PHS stalled, the USSR sent millions of doses of the oral vaccine to places with polio epidemics, such as Japan.

Sabin&#x27;s first oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), for use against type 1 polioviruses, was licensed in the United States in 1961. His vaccines for type 2 and type 3 polioviruses were licensed in 1962. 

At first, the monovalent poliovirus vaccines were administered together by being put on a sugar cube, because the oral polio vaccine had a bitter, salty taste (inspiring Robert B. Sherman&#x27;s lyrics to &quot;A Spoonful of Sugar (Helps the Medicine Go Down)&quot; for the 1964 film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;). In 1964, a single trivalent OPV containing all three viral serotypes was approved. Sabin&#x27;s oral vaccine was easier to give than the earlier vaccine developed by Salk in 1954, and its effects lasted longer. The Sabin vaccine became the predominant method of vaccination against polio in the United States for the next three decades. It broke the chain of transmission of the virus and allowed for the possibility that polio might one day be eradicated.

Sabin also developed vaccines against other viral diseases, including encephalitis and dengue. In addition, he investigated possible links between viruses and some forms of cancer.

== Philanthropy ==
Sabin refused to patent his vaccine, waiving commercial exploitation by pharmaceutical industries, so that the low price would guarantee a more extensive spread of the treatment. From the development of his vaccine Sabin did not gain a penny, and continued to live on his salary as a professor. The Sabin Vaccine Institute was founded in 1993 to continue the work of developing and promoting vaccines. To commemorate Sabin&#x27;s pioneering work, the institute annually awards the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal in recognition of work in the field of vaccinology or a complementary field.

<doc id="891367" wikidata="Q3297238" url="?curid=891367" title="Rick Aguilera">
<text>Richard Warren Aguilera (born December 31, 1961) is an American former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from 1985 to 2000. Aguilera won a world championship as a member of the New York Mets in , then won a second world championship as a member of the Minnesota Twins in . He also played for the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs. In 2008, Aguilera was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Aguilera attended Edgewood High School in West Covina, California, and played third base for their baseball team. Following graduation, he was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 37th round of the 1980 amateur draft on June 3, but did not sign and instead chose to attend Brigham Young University (BYU). After three years at BYU, in which he had made the transition from third base to pitcher, the Mets drafted him in the third round of the 1983 amateur draft on June 6.

==New York Mets==
Although he did not sign with the Mets organization until September, he was able to get into 16 games (going 5–6 with a 3.72 ERA in 104 innings) for the Little Falls Mets in the low A-ball New York–Penn League. The following season he was promoted to the Lynchburg Mets in the high-A Carolina League where he was 8–3 with a 2.34 ERA and 101 strikeouts in innings before being promoted to the Jackson Mets in the AA Texas League. In 1985, Aguilera was promoted to the AAA Tidewater Tides and was 6–4 with a 2.51 ERA in 11 starts before being promoted to the majors.
Aguilera saw his first MLB action on June 12, pitching two innings of scoreless relief and getting the win against the Philadelphia Phillies in a game started by Ron Darling. In the middle of a fierce divisional race with the Cardinals, Aguilera was particularly effective in July, going 3–0 with a 0.89 ERA, and ended the season 10–7 as the Cardinals edged out the Mets.

Aguilera posted an identical record the next year in 1986 as the number five starter for the division-winning Mets. That season, he was involved in a fight with Houston police outside a disco which resulted in the arrest of not only himself, but also teammates Bob Ojeda, Tim Teufel, and Darling, later referred to as &#x27;Cooters-gate&#x27;. Misdemeanor charges against Aguilera were eventually dropped. In the 1986 postseason, Aguilera pitched five scoreless innings in relief against the Houston Astros in the NLCS. Despite a 12.00 ERA in the World Series, he was the pitcher of record in the Mets&#x27; dramatic Game 6 comeback victory, getting the win despite giving up the two runs which surrendered the lead to Boston in the top of the 10th inning. Injuries slowed him the next two years, as he was limited to 17 starts in 1987 and 3 starts in 1988 by an elbow injury that required surgery. With injury concerns and seven innings of one-run relief in the 1988 NLCS, the Mets decided to experiment with Aguilera as a reliever. After returning to the team in 1989, he was converted to a long reliever. Although he was unhappy in a low-leverage bullpen role and asked to be traded, Aguilera thrived in the role, going 6–6 with a 2.34 ERA, 80 strikeouts and 7 saves in 36 appearances.

When Dwight Gooden was placed on the disabled list in early July 1989, the Mets began looking for a veteran starting pitcher via trade, rather than promote from within into the open rotation slot, with young pitchers such as Aguilera, Kevin Tapani, and David West rumored as trade bait. After the Mets lost their seventh game in a row ahead of the trade deadline, Aguilera was included in a last-minute deadline deal, along with West, Tapani, reliever Tim Drummond and a player to be named (which on October 16 became reliever Jack Savage), for Minnesota Twins ace Frank Viola.

==Minnesota Twins==
Although he got his wish and completed the season with the Twins as a starter, going 3–5 with a 3.72 ERA and 3 complete games in innings, he was shifted to the closer&#x27;s role in 1990 and responded by saving 32 games for a team that went 74–88. The next year, his relief pitching was instrumental in the Twins&#x27; surprising division title, as he saved 42 games with a 2.35 ERA, a team record that would stand until Eddie Guardado broke it in 2002 with 45 saves. He went on to save three of four victories in the ALCS and the first two games of the World Series against the Atlanta Braves. In Game 3, he became the first pitcher to pinch hit in a World Series game since Don Drysdale in 1965, flying out in the top of the 12th with the bases loaded and two outs before giving up the game-winning hit in the bottom of the inning. He would also win Game 6 of the series.
Aguilera became one of baseball&#x27;s premier closers with the Twins from 1990 to 1995 and was named to three consecutive All-Star teams from 1991 to 1993.

==Boston Red Sox==
With the Twins well on their way to finishing 44 games behind the AL Central division winning Cleveland Indians in 1995, Aguilera was traded to the Red Sox on July 6 in exchange for minor league outfielder J. J. Johnson and pitcher Frank Rodriguez. The move was made official while the Red Sox were in Minneapolis playing the Twins and after walking down to the visitors dressing room, Aguilera was called on to convert a save opportunity in his very first appearance – striking out former teammate Kirby Puckett to help nail down a 5–4 win. Aguilera would later state that the trade that brought him to Boston was the lowest point of his career. He had known he was likely to be traded and made clear in the weeks leading up to the trade that he was not happy about it. He was about to attain 10/5 status at the time (10 years in the majors, 5 with the same team)--a status which would have given him veto power over any trade, and he went on record saying he would exercise that veto power should he reach the milestone without being traded. All the same, he would perform well for the AL East champion Red Sox, going 2–2 with 20 saves and a 2.67 ERA in 30 relief appearances. Like a number of his teammates, Aguilera struggled in the playoffs, giving up one run on three hits with one strikeout in two-thirds of an inning.

==Return to Minnesota==
A free agent following the 1995 season, Aguilera opted to return to the Twins. Minnesota skipper Tom Kelly installed Aguilera as a starting pitcher—a position he hadn&#x27;t been in since starting 11 games for the team in 1989—rather than his familiar closer role. Despite early season shoulder and wrist injuries (with the latter reportedly caused by lifting his wife&#x27;s suitcase the last week of spring training) forcing Aguilera to miss six weeks early in the season, the veteran battled his way to an 8–6 record with a 5.42 ERA in 19 starts, including a pair of complete games.

The following season, the experiment of Aguilera as a starting pitcher had ended midway through spring training and the veteran returned to the bullpen. At age 35, he went 5–4 with 26 saves and a 3.82 ERA in 61 outings. In 1998, he recorded 38 saves (the most since saving 41 games in 1992) in 68 games for the Twins. In 1999, Aguilera had gone 3–1 with 6 saves and a 1.27 ERA in 17 games before the Twins traded the 37-year-old and pitcher Scott Downs to the Chicago Cubs for Kyle Lohse and Jason Ryan.

==Chicago Cubs==
Aguilera pitched well for the Cubs in 1999, posting a 6–3 record with 8 saves and a 3.69 ERA in 44 games as a middle reliever, set-up man, and occasional closer. At age 38, he entered the 2000 season, his 16th season in the big leagues, as the team&#x27;s closer. Aguilera went 1–2 with 29 saves in 54 appearances, but blew eight of his save opportunities and finished with a 4.91 ERA for the last-place Cubs.

==Life after baseball==
After spending the off-season weighing the possibility of coming back for a 17th season, Aguilera officially retired on February 17, 2001. At the time of his retirement, his 318 saves trailed only Lee Smith, John Franco, Dennis Eckersley, Jeff Reardon, Randy Myers, Rollie Fingers, and John Wetteland in career saves. As of October 2017, he stands 20th on the career saves list. Aguilera was on top of the Twins / Senators franchise list for career saves with 254 until Joe Nathan surpassed him on August 10, 2011. In addition, Aguilera&#x27;s save totals in 1991 (42 saves), 1992 (41), and 1998 (38) are 5th, 7th, and 10th on the franchise&#x27;s top 10 season saves list (as of the end of the 2015 season).

Aguilera is married to wife Sherry (m. 1988) and the couple have two children, daughter Rachel (born 1991) and son Austin (born 1996). A devout Christian, Aguilera now lives in the San Diego suburb of Rancho Santa Fe, California and dedicates his time to his family and real estate investments. He has also served as the pitching coach for the Santa Fe Christian High School baseball team from 2001 to 2005 and as the head coach from 2005 to 2007.

On June 21, 2008, Rick Aguilera was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame.

<text>Lecil Travis Martin (September 1, 1931 – April 12, 1999), whose stage name was Boxcar Willie, was an American country music singer-songwriter, who sang in the &quot;old-time hobo&quot; music style, complete with overalls, and a floppy hat. &quot;Boxcar Willie&quot; was originally a character in a ballad he wrote, but he later adopted it as his own stage name. His early musical career was parallel to service as an enlisted flight engineer in the United States Air Force.

==Biography==

According to his birth record, Martin was born in Ovilla, Texas, to Birdie and Edna Mae Martin. He joined the United States Air Force in May 1949, and served as a flight engineer on the B-29 Super Fortress during the Korean War in the early 1950s. In Lincoln, Nebraska, Martin was once sitting at a railroad crossing and a fellow that closely resembled his chief boom operator, Willie Wilson, passed by sitting in a boxcar. He said, &quot;There goes Willie.&quot; He pulled over and wrote a song entitled &quot;Boxcar Willie&quot;. It eventually stuck and became Martin&#x27;s nickname. In 1962, Martin met his future wife, Lloene, in Boise, Idaho. They later had four children.

In San Jose, California, Martin attended a talent show as &quot;Boxcar Willie&quot; and performed under that nickname for the first time. He won first place and a $150 prize. That was his part-time vocation, however, as he was still in the Air Force and had been flying daily missions. In the early 1970s, while assigned to the 136th Air Refueling Wing of the Texas Air National Guard, Martin served as a flight engineer aboard the Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter and participated in Operation Creek Party. This operation provided critical in-flight refueling services for fighter aircraft assigned to the United States Air Forces in Europe for 10 years.

In 1976, Martin retired from the Air Force and became a full-time performer. One of his first national appearances was a win on Chuck Barris&#x27; &quot;The Gong Show&quot;. In the late 1970s, Martin traveled to Grand Prairie, Texas, where he purchased hundreds of 8-track tapes pre-recorded with his music to sell later in various places. After he received a contract with other recording studios, he discontinued his dealings with Cleo McDonald.

Martin entered American mainstream pop culture consciousness due to a series of television commercials for record compilations of artists who were obscure in the United States, yet had large international followings, such as Slim Whitman and Gheorghe Zamfir. Martin went on to become a star in country music. In 1981, Martin achieved a professional landmark by being inducted into the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. He also had success outside of the United States, with his 1980 album &quot;King of the Road&quot; giving him his greatest chart success by reaching No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart. Traveling around the world with Martin&#x27;s band was his steadfast and trusty steel guitar player Chubby Howard, radio show host and musician for many years.

In 1985, Martin moved to Branson, Missouri, and purchased a theater on Missouri Route 76, also known as 76 Country Boulevard. In addition to the Boxcar Willie Theater, he opened a museum and eventually had two motels, both bearing his name. Martin was one of the first big stars to open a show in Branson, paving the way for the other nationally known names that followed. He performed at his theater in Branson until his death.

On February 23, 1992, Martin was featured on the second-season premier of &quot;Tracks Ahead&quot; in which he performed with his band at the Boxcar Willie Theater.

==Death==
Martin was diagnosed with leukemia in 1996, and died on April 12, 1999, in Branson, Missouri at the age of 67. He was buried at Ozarks Memorial Park in Branson. Major League Baseball umpire &quot;Cowboy&quot; Joe West was among his pallbearers.

==Legacy==
After a major reconstruction project, the overpass carrying Farm to Market Road 664 (locally known as Ovilla Road) over Interstate 35E in Red Oak, Texas, was renamed the Boxcar Willie Memorial Overpass. A small park, two blocks from the National Mall, near the L&#x27;Enfant Plaza station in Washington, D.C., was renamed Boxcar Willie Park. Martin is still recalled by his nickname, &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Hobo&quot;. One of his sons, Larry Martin, has performed professionally under the stage name of Boxcar Willie Jr.

<doc id="891379" wikidata="Q55397879" url="?curid=891379" title="Disk enclosure">
<text>A disk enclosure is a specialized casing designed to hold and power hard disk drives or solid state drives while providing a mechanism to allow them to communicate to one or more separate computers.

Drive enclosures provide power to the drives therein and convert the data sent across their native data bus into a format usable by an external connection on the computer to which it is connected. In some cases, the conversion is as trivial as carrying a signal between different connector types. In others, it is complicated enough to require a separate embedded system to retransmit data over connector and signal of a different standard.

Factory-assembled external hard disk drives, external DVD-ROM drives, and others consist of a storage device in a disk enclosure.

==Benefits==
Key benefits to using external disk enclosures include:
*Adding additional storage space and media types to small form factor and laptop computers, as well as sealed embedded systems such as digital video recorders and video game consoles.
*Adding RAID capabilities to computers that lack RAID controllers or adequate space for additional drives.
*Adding more drives to any given server or workstation than their chassis can hold.
*Transferring data between non-networked computers, humorously known as sneakernet.
*Adding an easily removable backup source with a separate power supply from the connected computer.
*Using a network-attached storage-capable enclosure over a network to share data or provide a cheap off-site backup solution.
*Preventing the heat from a disk drive from increasing the heat inside an operating computer case.
*Simple and cheap approach to hot swapping.
*Recovering the data from a damaged computer&#x27;s hard drive, particularly when it does not share the same interface with the computer used to perform the recovery.
*Lower the cost of removable storage by reusing hardware designed for internal use.
*In some instances, provides a hardened chassis to prevent wear and tear.

==Consumer enclosures==
In the consumer market, commonly used configurations of drive enclosures utilize magnetic hard drives or optical disc drives inside USB, FireWire, or Serial ATA enclosures. External 3.5-in floppy drives are also fairly common, following a trend to not integrate floppy drives into compact and laptop computers. Pre-built external drives are available through all major manufacturers of hard drives, as well as several third parties.

These may also be referred to as a caddy – a sheath, typically plastic or metallic, within which a hard disk drive can be placed and connected with the same type of adapters as a conventional motherboard and power supply would use. The exterior of the caddy typically has two female sockets, used for data transfer and power.
Variants of caddy:
* some larger caddies can support several devices at once and can feature either separate outputs to connect each device to a different computer, or a single output to connect both over the same data cable
* some caddies do not require an external power supply, and instead obtain power from the device to which they are connected
* some caddies have integrated fans with which to keep the drives within at a cool temperature
* caddies for all major standards exist, supporting for example ATA, SCSI and SATA drives and USB, SCSI and FireWire outputs

Advantages:
* relatively high transfer speed; typically faster than other common portable media such as CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives, slower than drives connected using solely ATA, SCSI and SATA connectors
* storage; typically larger than CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives
* price-to-storage ratio; typically better than CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives

Disadvantages:
* power; most variants require a supply, unlike CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives...
* size; typically larger than CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives

==Form factors==

* &quot;Multiple drives:&quot; RAID-enabled enclosures and iSCSI enclosures commonly hold multiple drives. High-end and server-oriented chassis are often built around 3.5-in drives in hot-swappable drive caddies.
* &quot;&quot;5.25-inch&quot; drive:&quot; (5.75 in × 8 in × 1.63 in = 146.1 mm × 203 mm × 41.4 mm)Most desktop models of drives for optical 120-mm discs (DVD-ROM or CD-ROM drives, CD or DVD burners), are designed to be mounted into a so-called &quot;5.25-inch slot&quot;, which obtained its nickname because this slot size was initially used by drives for floppy disks in the IBM PC AT. (The original &quot;5.25-inch slot&quot; in the IBM PC was with 3.25 in (82.6 mm) twice as high as the one commonly used today; in fact, the PC&#x27;s drive size was called &quot;5.25-inch full-height&quot;, and the size used in the PC AT and commonly used today is &quot;5.25-inch half-height&quot;.)
* &quot;&quot;3.5-inch&quot; drive:&quot; (4 in × 5.75 in × 1 in = 101.6 mm × 146.05 mm × 25.4 mm) This smaller, disk-drive form factor was introduced with the Apple Macintosh series in 1984, and later adopted throughout the industry beginning widely with the IBM PS/2 series in 1987, which included drives of this size for 90-mm (&quot;3.5-inch&quot;) floppy disks. This form factor is today used by most desktop hard drives. They usually have 10 mounting holes with American 6-32 UNC 2B threads: three on each side and four on the bottom.
* &quot;&quot;2.5-inch&quot; drive:&quot; (2.75 in × 3.945 in × 0.374 in = 69.85 mm × 100.2 mm × 9.5 mm)This even smaller, form factor is widely used today in notebook computers and similar small-footprint devices. One commonplace feature for these drives is radically lower power consumption than is found in larger drives. This enables enclosure vendors to power the devices directly from the host device&#x27;s USB or other external bus, in most cases.
* &quot;&quot;1.8-inch&quot; drive:&quot; Found in extremely compact devices, such as certain portable media players and smaller notebooks, these devices are not standardized like their 2.5 inch cousins.
A range of other form factors has emerged for mobile devices. While laptop hard drives are today generally of the 9.5 mm high variant of the &quot;2.5-inch&quot; drive form factor, older laptops and notebooks had hard drives that varied in height, which can make it difficult to find a well-fitting chassis. Laptop optical drives require &quot;slim&quot; 5.25-in enclosures, since they have approximately half the thickness of their desktop counterparts, and most models use a special 50-pin connector that differs from the 40-pin connectors used on desktop ATA drives.

While they are less common now than they once were, it is also possible to purchase a drive chassis and mount that will convert a 3.5-inch hard drive into a removable hard disk that can be plugged into and removed from a mounting bracket permanently installed in a desktop PC case. The mounting bracket carries the data bus and power connections over a proprietary connector, and converts back into the drive&#x27;s native data bus format and power connections inside the drive&#x27;s chassis.

==Enterprise enclosures==
In enterprise storage the term refers to a larger physical chassis. The term can be used both in reference to network-attached storage (NAS) and components of a storage area network (SAN) or be used to describe a chassis directly attached to one or more servers over an external bus. Like their conventional server brethren, these devices may include a backplane, temperature sensors, cooling systems, enclosure management devices, and redundant power supplies.

==Connections==

===Native drive interfaces===

SCSI, SAS, Fibre Channel, eSATAp, and eSATA interfaces can be used to directly connect the external hard drive to an internal host adapter, without the need for any intervening controller. External variants of these native drive protocols are extremely similar to the internal protocols, but are often expanded to carry power (such as eSATAp and the SCSI Single Connector Attachment) and to use a more durable physical connector. A host adapter with external port may be necessary to connect a drive, if a computer lacks an available external port.

===Direct attach serial interfaces===
USB or FireWire connections are typically used to attach consumer class external hard drives to a computer. Unlike SCSI, eSATA, or SAS these require circuitry to convert the hard disk&#x27;s native signal to the appropriate protocol. Parallel ATA and internal Serial ATA hard disks are frequently connected to such chassis because nearly all computers on the market today have USB or FireWire ports, and these chassis are inexpensive and easy to find.

===Network protocols===

iSCSI, NFS, or CIFS are all commonly used protocols that are used to allow an external hard drive to use a network to send data to a computer system. This type of external hard drive is also known as Network-attached storage or NAS. Often, such drives are embedded computers running operating systems such as Linux or VxWorks that use their NFS daemons and SAMBA to provide a networked file system. A newer technology NAS, has been applied to some disk enclosures, which allows network ability, direct connection (e.g., USB) and even RAID features.

== Hard drive shucking ==

&quot;Shucking&quot; refers to the process of purchasing an external hard disk drive and removing the drive from its enclosure, in order for it to be used as an internal disk drive. This is performed because external drives are often cheaper than internal drives of the same capacity and model, and that external drives designed for continuous usage often contain hard drives designed for increased reliability.

Following the hard disk drive shortages caused by the 2011 Thailand floods, data storage company Backblaze reduced its cost of acquiring hard drives by purchasing external hard drives and shucking them. According to Backblaze Chief Executive Gleb Budman, the company purchased 1,838 external drives during this period. Describing the process as &quot;drive farming&quot;, the company noted that it was much cheaper for them to purchase 3 TB external drives and removing them from their cases manually, than it is to purchase internal drives.

<doc id="891380" wikidata="Q133289" url="?curid=891380" title="Raffia palm">
<text>Raffia palms are members of the genus Raphia. The Malagasy name is derived from &quot;&quot; &quot;to squeeze juice&quot;. The genus contains about twenty species of palms native to tropical regions of Africa, and especially Madagascar, with one species (&quot;R. taedigera&quot;) also occurring in Central and South America. &quot;R. taedigera&quot; is the source of raffia fibers, which are the veins of the leaves, and this species produces a fruit called &quot;brazilia pods&quot;, &quot;uxi nuts&quot; or &quot;uxi pods&quot;.

They grow up to tall and are remarkable for their compound pinnate leaves, the longest in the plant kingdom; leaves of &quot;R. regalis&quot; up to long and wide are known. The plants are monocarpic, meaning that they flower once and then die after the seeds are mature. Some species have individual stems which die after fruiting, but have a root system which remains alive and sends up new stems which fruit. The Raphia palms are remarkable in being one of just two genera of flowering plants having the very rare phyllotaxy of 1/4 (the other is Laccosperma). Perhaps even more remarkable is the &quot;King Raphia&quot; (Raphia vinifera &quot;variety&quot; nigerica) which is the only known palm with pairs of opposite fronds.
==Cultivation and uses==
===Fiber===


Raffia fiber is produced from the epidermal membrane on the underside of the leaf fronds. The membrane is taken off to create a long thin fiber, which can be rolled together for added strength before they are finally dried. Fibres can be made into twine, rope, garden ties, and used in tree grafting. Fibres are important in the area of textiles, as they can be dyed and woven into products such as decorative mats, baskets, placemats, hats, and shoes.

===Raffia wine===
The sap of the palm can be fermented into raffia wine. It is traditionally collected by cutting a box in the top of the palm and suspending a large gourd below to collect the milky white liquid. Unlike with oil palms, this process kills the tree. Sap from both the raffia and oil palms can be allowed to ferment over a few days. When first collected from the tree, it is sweet and appears slightly carbonated. As it ages more sugar is converted. Raffia wine tends to be sweeter at any age when compared to oil palm wine. Both kinds of palm wine can also be distilled into strong liquors, such as Ogogoro. Traditionally in some cultures where raffia or oil palm are locally available, guests and spirits are offered these drinks from the palm trees.

===Other uses===
In local construction, raffia fibres are used for ropes, with branches and leaves providing sticks and supporting beams, and various roof coverings. The people of Ogba kingdom in Rivers State and other southern Nigerians use raffia palm fronds as fishing poles. The frond is usually cut from a young palm tree. The leaves are removed and the stake is dried, which becomes very light, and the hook is attached to a line, which is tied to the stake, making it a fishing pole.

The raffia palm is important in societies such as that of the Province of Bohol in the Philippines, Kuba of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nso of Cameroon, the Igbo and Ibibio/Annang/Bahumono of Southeastern Nigeria, the Tiv of Northcentral Nigeria and Southwestern Cameroons, the Urhobo and Ijaw people of the Niger delta Nigeria and the Yoruba people of southwestern Nigeria, among several other West African ethnic nations.

<doc id="891389" wikidata="Q2936356" url="?curid=891389" title="Caney Fork River">
<text>The Caney Fork River is a river that flows through central Tennessee in the United States, draining a substantial portion of the southwestern Cumberland Plateau and southeastern Highland Rim regions. It is a major tributary of the Cumberland River, and is part of the Cumberland, Ohio and Mississippi basins. The river is long, and its watershed covers in eleven counties. Monterey, Baxter, Sparta, Smithville, McMinnville, Altamont, Spencer and Gordonsville are among the towns that are at least partially drained by the river.

The Caney Fork flows through two impoundments— Center Hill Lake and Great Falls Lake— both of which create sizeable artificial lakes. The river&#x27;s basin is home to numerous protected lands and recreational areas, including five state wilderness areas, six interpretive areas, and a wildlife management area. Two state parks— Edgar Evins State Park and Rock Island State Park— are located along the river, and three others— Fall Creek Falls State Park, Burgess Falls State Park and South Cumberland State Park— are located within its basin. The river is a popular stream for canoeing and kayaking.

The name &quot;Caney Fork&quot; comes from the dense cane breaks that grew along the river&#x27;s banks when European explorers first arrived in the area.

The river is a major drainage feature of the Cumberland Plateau and the largest tributary of the Cumberland River.

==Geography==
The Caney Fork rises in Cumberland County about west-northwest of Crossville before flowing southwest and crossing into White County. In southeastern White County it descends off the Cumberland Plateau through a deep and steep gorge known as Scott&#x27;s Gulf in a remote area west of Scott Pinnacle, a locally-known mountain. Farther downstream, near the Dodson community, the stream becomes the border between White and Van Buren County. It receives the flow of the Calfkiller River and several minor tributaries.

Located at the confluence of the Caney Fork, the Collins River and the Rocky River, is Great Falls Lake. This reservoir is impounded by Great Falls Dam, a project of the former Tennessee Electric Power Company, now owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). This is the only dam outside of the Tennessee River drainage system directly operated by TVA. This dam impounds a very small but very deep lake due to the depth of the gorges carved by the rivers it impounds. This area was something of a resort area in the early 20th century when such projects were uncommon, especially in the southeastern United States, but other than a few cabins, there is little evidence of this today, as the area has been largely supplanted by larger, more modern developments. The dam is named for the Great Falls of the Caney Fork, caused by the descent of the stream off of the Highland Rim to the level of the Nashville Basin. Located on the lake is Rock Island State Park, developed on the site of former woolen mills in the 19th century predating the electrical development. This area was used for a considerable number of exterior shots and stunts in the Sylvester Stallone film, &quot;The Specialist&quot;.

At the foot of Great Falls Dam the water is usually slack except during periods of high discharge due to the influence of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Center Hill Dam project in DeKalb County further downstream, developed in the late 1950s. Unlike the Great Falls Dam, this project flooded several small communities and thousands of acres of land previously devoted to agriculture. It is crossed by a particularly scenic bridge on State Route 56. Along its shores is Edgar Evins State Park, named for the father of the area&#x27;s former Representative, Joe L. Evins, former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.

Below Center Hill Dam, the stream crosses into Smith County and is bridged by Interstate 40 five times in under four miles. This downstream section is annually stocked with Rainbow, Brown, and Brook trout by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA), and is considered to be one of the best trout rivers in the state. A final bridge, reconstructed in 2014, is on U.S. Route 70N near the Elmwood community. The river&#x27;s mouth into the Cumberland River, which is considered to be a world class striper fishery, is almost directly opposite the Smith County seat of Carthage. A farm belonging to former Vice President Al Gore and formerly his late father, Senator Albert Gore Sr., is located along here.

==In popular culture==
The bluegrass band Balsam Range has a song of the same name on their album &quot;Last Train to Kitty Hawk&quot;.

Canadian Folksinger, Old Man Luedecke has a song entitled &quot;Caney Fork River&quot; on his album &quot;My Hands Are On Fire and Other Love Songs.&quot;

<text>Toby William John Moody is a British sports commentator focused on motor racing. He was for many years the worldwide voice of the MotoGP series on Eurosport TV, and in 2012, lead commentator on the British Touring Car Championship for ITV4. In 2014 he will commentate for ITV4 on the British Superbike Championship.

Many American racing fans would know him as the man who provided nightly, half-hour reports from the Dakar Rally for Speed Channel during the month of January. In 2005, Outdoor Life Network picked up the American broadcasting rights to the event, but they opted for an American host. His commentating career began when he was 20 at the Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb in the UK. It led to hosting the 1995 Goodwood Festival of Speed, and the 1996 500cc World Championship Grand Prix.

When not commentating, he is the MotoGP correspondent for the autosport.com website, and hosts many manufacturer events/ press conferences for both the two and four wheeled interests including some F1 work at Monaco and at Silverstone in 2009.

His background started as a former mechanic, starting out as one at the age of 16, working for the Benetton Formula One team and Prodrive during school holidays. This expanded to a PR job for WilliamsF1, and then running the PR for the Nissan Rally Team in the UK, who won the British title twice in three years.

In the United Kingdom, Moody is a member of the organising committee for the Shelsley Walsh hillclimb, runs the official website for the British Hill Climb Championship and drives a single seater when the time allows.

Indeed, 2009 saw Moody claim the 600cc class record at the Shelsley Walsh hillclimb, taking 0.08 seconds off the record, achieving a time of 29.31 seconds, but since then has lowered it slightly, to 29.14 on July 18.

<text>John Francis Seymour Jr. (born December 3, 1937) is an American retired politician who served as a United States senator from California from 1991 to 1992. A member of the Republican Party, he was appointed to continue Pete Wilson&#x27;s term but lost the special election to finish it to Democratic nominee and former San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein. As of 2024, he is the last Republican to serve as a U.S. senator from California. Seymour was also the last U.S. senator from southern California until Alex Padilla took office on January 20, 2021, replacing Kamala Harris when she was inaugurated as vice president of the United States.

==Life and career==
Born in Chicago, Seymour attended public schools in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955 to 1959 and graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1962. Seymour was the president of the California Association of Realtors from 1978 to 1982, and worked in the real estate business from 1962 to 1981.

Seymour served Anaheim as a member of its city council from 1974 to 1978, as the 39th mayor of Anaheim from 1978 to 1982, and as a state senator from 1982 to 1991. In the California Senate, his voting record was that of a moderate or liberal Republican; he voted to ban assault weapons, to outlaw discrimination against people with AIDS, and to increase spending for social programs including education and mental health benefits. As mayor of Anaheim, Seymour was instrumental in recruiting the Los Angeles Rams to move to Anaheim Stadium.

In 1991, Seymour was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor Pete Wilson to serve in the seat Wilson had vacated to become governor. Seymour&#x27;s appointment lasted until the 1992 special election to select a replacement who would serve until the normal expiration of Wilson&#x27;s term in 1995. Former San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein defeated Seymour in the special election.

After his Senate term, Seymour was director of the California Housing Finance Agency for two years, and later was CEO of the nonprofit Southern California Housing Development Corporation and on the boards of directors of several housing-related companies including IndyMac Bank, Orange Coast Title Insurance, Los Angeles Federal Savings Bank, and Irvine Apartment Communities. Seymour lives in San Marcos, California.

<text>Factor is a stack-oriented programming language created by Slava Pestov. Factor is dynamically typed and has automatic memory management, as well as powerful metaprogramming features. The language has a single implementation featuring a self-hosted optimizing compiler and an interactive development environment. The Factor distribution includes a large standard library.

==History==
Slava Pestov created Factor in 2003 as a scripting language for a video game. The initial implementation, now referred to as JFactor, was implemented in Java and ran on the Java Virtual Machine. Though the early language resembled modern Factor superficially in terms of syntax, the modern language is very different in practical terms and the current implementation is much faster.

The language has changed significantly over time. Originally, Factor programs centered on manipulating Java objects with Java&#x27;s reflection capabilities. From the beginning, the design philosophy has been to modify the language to suit programs written in it. As the Factor implementation and standard libraries grew more detailed, the need for certain language features became clear, and they were added. JFactor did not have an object system where the programmer could define their own classes, and early versions of native Factor were the same; the language was similar to Scheme in this way. Today, the object system is a central part of Factor. Other important language features such as tuple classes, combinator inlining, macros, user-defined parsing words and the modern vocabulary system were only added in a piecemeal fashion as their utility became clear.

The foreign function interface was present from very early versions to Factor, and an analogous system existed in JFactor. This was chosen over creating a plugin to the C part of the implementation for each external library that Factor should communicate with, and has the benefit of being more declarative, faster to compile and easier to write.

The Java implementation initially consisted of just an interpreter, but a compiler to Java bytecode was later added. This compiler only worked on certain procedures. The Java version of Factor was replaced by a version written in C and Factor. Initially, this consisted of just an interpreter, but the interpreter was replaced by two compilers, used in different situations. Over time, the Factor implementation has grown significantly faster.

==Description==
Factor is a dynamically typed, functional and object-oriented programming language. Code is structured around small procedures, called words. In typical code, these are 1–3 lines long, and a procedure more than 7 lines long is very rare. Something that would idiomatically be expressed with one procedure in another programming language would be written as several words in Factor.

Each word takes a fixed number of arguments and has a fixed number of return values. Arguments to words are passed on a data stack, using reverse Polish notation. The stack is used just to organize calls to words, and not as a data structure. The stack in Factor is used in a similar way to the stack in Forth; for this, they are both considered stack languages. For example, below is a snippet of code that prints out &quot;hello world&quot; to the current output stream:
 &quot;hello world&quot; print
codice_1 is a word in the codice_2 vocabulary that takes a string from the stack and returns nothing. It prints the string to the current output stream (by default, the terminal or the graphical listener).

The factorial function formula_1 can be implemented in Factor in the following way:

: factorial ( n -- n! ) dup 1 &gt; [ [1..b] product ] [ drop 1 ] if ;
Not all data has to be passed around only with the stack. Lexically scoped local variables let one store and access temporaries used within a procedure. Dynamically scoped variables are used to pass things between procedure calls without using the stack. For example, the current input and output streams are stored in dynamically scoped variables.

Factor emphasizes flexibility and the ability to extend the language. There is a system for macros, as well as for arbitrary extension of Factor syntax. Factor&#x27;s syntax is often extended to allow for new types of word definitions and new types of literals for data structures. It is also used in the XML library to provide literal syntax for generating XML. For example, the following word takes a string and produces an XML document object which is an HTML document emphasizing the string:

 : make-html ( string -- xml )
 dup
 &lt;XML
 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
 XML&gt; ;

The word codice_3 duplicates the top item on the stack. The codice_4 stands for filling in that part of the XML document with an item from the stack.

==Implementation and libraries==
Factor includes a large standard library, written entirely in the language. These include
* A cross-platform GUI toolkit, built on top of OpenGL and various windowing systems, used for the development environment.
* Bindings to several database libraries, including PostgreSQL and SQLite.
* An HTTP server and client, with the Furnace web framework.
* Efficient homogeneous arrays of integers, floats and C structs.
* A library implementing regular expressions, generating machine code to do the matching.

A foreign function interface is built into Factor, allowing for communication with C, Objective-C and Fortran programs. There is also support for executing and communicating with shaders written in GLSL.

Factor is implemented in Factor and C++. It was originally bootstrapped from an earlier Java implementation. Today, the parser and the optimizing compiler are written in the language. Certain basic parts of the language are implemented in C++ such as the garbage collector and certain primitives.

Factor uses an image-based model, analogous to many Smalltalk implementations, where compiled code and data are stored in an image. To compile a program, the program is loaded into an image and the image is saved. A special tool assists in the process of creating a minimal image to run a particular program, packaging the result into something that can be deployed as a standalone application.

The Factor compiler implements many advanced optimizations and has been used as a target for research in new optimization techniques.

<doc id="891400" wikidata="Q2919718" url="?curid=891400" title="Stephen Hawes">
<text>Stephen Hawes ( – 1523) was an English poet of the Tudor period.

==Life==
He was probably born in Suffolk when the surname was common. If his own statement of his age may be trusted, he was born about 1474. He was educated at Oxford and travelled in England, Scotland and France. On his return his various accomplishments, especially his most excellent vein in poetry, procured him a place at court. He was Groom of the Chamber to Henry VII as early as 1502. According to Anthony Wood, he could repeat by heart the works of most of the English poets, especially the poems of John Lydgate, whom he called his master. He was still living in 1521, when it is stated in Henry VIII&#x27;s household accounts that £6, 13s. 4d. was paid to Mr Hawes for his play; he died before 1530, when Thomas Field, in his &quot;Conversation between a Lover and a Jay&quot;, wrote &quot;&quot;.

Some critics, notably C.S. Lewis, have treated Hawes dismissively: &quot;faculty was what he lacked; there was more and better poetry in him than he could express&quot;, referring to his &quot;broken-backed metre and dull excursions into the seven liberal arts&quot;. But his metre is not consistently broken-backed: from time to time (though not very often) one encounters lines that would not have disgraced either Chaucer before him or Spenser after him: &quot; or &quot; and so on, where, so long as one pronounces at least some of the final &quot;e&quot;&#x27;s, the metre seems to work quite well.

Novelist Hilda Lamb made Hawes a character of her novel &quot;The Willing Heart&quot; published in 1958, where he is fictionally portrayed as an illegitimate son of King Richard III&#x27;s. No contemporary documents support this assumption.

==Works==

His major work is &#x27; or &#x27;, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1509, but finished three years earlier. It was also printed with slightly varying titles by the same printer in 1517, by J. Wayland in 1554, by Richard Tottel and by John Waley in 1555. Tottel&#x27;s edition was edited by T. Wright and reprinted by the Percy Society in 1846.

&quot;The Passetyme of Pleasure&quot; is a long allegorical poem in seven-lined stanzas of man&#x27;s life in this world. It is divided into sections after the manner of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and borrows the machinery of romance. Its main motive is the education of the knight, Graunde Amour, based, according to William John Courthope (&quot;History of English Poetry&quot;, vol. I. 382), on the &quot;Marriage of Mercury and Philology&quot;, by Martianus Capella, and the details of the description prove Hawes to have been acquainted with medieval systems of philosophy. At the suggestion of Fame, and accompanied by her two greyhounds, Grace and Governance, Graunde Amour starts out in quest of La Bel Pucel. He first visits the Tower of Doctrine or Science where he acquaints himself with the arts of grammar, logic, rhetoric and arithmetic. After a long disputation with the lady in the Tower of Music he returns to his studies, and after sojourns at the Tower of Geometry, the Tower of Doctrine, the Castle of Chivalry, etc., he arrives at the Castle of La Bel Pucel, where he is met by Peace, Mercy, Justice, Reason and Memory. His happy marriage does not end the story, which goes on to tell of the oncoming of Age, with the concomitant evils of Avarice and Cunning. The admonition of Death brings Contrition and Conscience, and it is only when Remembraunce has delivered an epitaph chiefly dealing with the Seven Deadly Sins, and Fame has enrolled Graunde Amours name with the knights of antiquity, that we are allowed to part with the hero. This long imaginative poem was widely read and esteemed, and certainly exercised an influence on the genius of Edmund Spenser.

Hawes&#x27; poetry sought to revive the earlier medieval romances and allegorical poems which he much admired. Other works of Hawes include &#x27; (1509) and &#x27; (1509).

<text>Indianola is a ghost town located on Matagorda Bay in Calhoun County, Texas, United States. The community, once the county seat of Calhoun County, is a part of the Victoria, Texas, Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 1875, the city had a population of 5,000, but on September 15 of that year, a powerful hurricane struck, killing between 150 and 300 and almost destroying the town. Indianola was rebuilt, only to be wiped out on August 19, 1886, by another intense hurricane followed by a fire. Indianola was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1963, marker number 2642.

== History ==
=== German immigration port of entry ===
Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels, representing the Adelsverein, selected Indian Point in December 1844 as the port of entry for the Verein colonists from Germany. Prince Solms renamed the port Carlshafen in honor of himself, Count Carl of Castell-Castell and Count Victor August of Leiningen-Westerburg-Alt-Leiningen whom Solms claimed had been christened Carl. Prince Solms&#x27; choice of Carlshafen and its inadequate accommodations as a port of entry, as well as the isolated route to New Braunfels, was to keep the Germans from interacting with any Americans. In February 1845 Henry Francis Fisher conspired with Dr. F. Schubbert to coerce incoming immigrants to sign legal documents disassociating themselves from the Verein and to join Schubbert&#x27;s colony in Milam County.

In May 1846, John O. Meusebach received a letter from Count Castell informing him that 4,304 colonists were on their way to Texas. With no funds and no new settlements, the mass of emigrants was stalled at Carlshafen. Meusebach&#x27;s requests to the Verein for more money, and his warnings at pending bankruptcy for the Verein, brought no results. As a last resort, Meusebach instructed D.H. Klaener to publish the plight in the German news media. Embarrassed by the publicity, the Verein established an inadequate $60,000 letter of credit. Meusebach had arranged with the Torrey Brothers for transporting the emigrants inland, but the United States hired the Torrey Brothers for use in the Mexican–American War. An epidemic of spinal meningitis broke out at Carlshafen and spread with the emigrants to New Braunfels and Fredericksburg.

Samuel Addition White and William M. Cook founded Indian Point, later Indianola, in August 1846. This settlement developed along a corridor of beachfront for twenty-three blocks. In 1849, the town changed its name from Indian Point to Indianola. In 1852, Calhoun County selected Indianola as its county seat.
Some of these immigrants purchased land from Samuel White and established a settlement at Indian Point. The settlement&#x27;s name was changed to Indianola in 1849 by combining the word &quot;Indian&quot; with &quot;ola&quot;, the Spanish word for &quot;wave&quot;. The German immigrants continued to refer to the community as &quot;Carlshaven&quot; (Carl&#x27;s Harbor) in honor of Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels.

=== Post-German immigration years ===
From its founding in 1846, Indianola served as a major port, and before the 1875 storm was second only to Galveston, Texas as Texas&#x27; primary port. Charles Morgan established Indianola as a port of call for his gulf coast steamship line in 1849.

The town was incorporated in 1853. In 1856, the port received cargoes of camels, part of the United States Camel Corps experiment to replace horses and mules as the primary pack animal in the southwestern parts of the country.

During the American Civil War, Indianola was twice occupied by Union troops, in October 1862 and November 1863. During the second occupation, part of a Union infantry regiment while moving from Indianola to Matagorda Island drowned in Matagorda Bay.

In 1869, the world&#x27;s first mechanically-refrigerated shipment of beef left Indianola for New Orleans.

During World War II, the United States Army constructed an anti-aircraft firing range along the Indianola shoreline to train gunners and the facility was used primarily by military personnel from Camp Hulen, located outside of Palacios.

=== Impact of storms ===
Having survived severe storms before, Indianola was almost totally destroyed on 16 September 1875. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in detail on the extensive loss of life and property. Even the lighthouses were swept away and the keepers, including Thomas H. Mayne and Edward Flick Jr. of the East Shoal Lighthouse, killed.

The town was rebuilt, but events were repeated in 1886. The destruction served as an abject lesson for many residents of Galveston, 100 miles up the Texas coast. However, their calls for a seawall to protect that city went unheeded, and Galveston nearly shared Indianola&#x27;s fate when the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 struck the island.

The Indianola Railroad was proposed to connect the port of Indianola to San Antonio. After the two storms, discouraged investors abandoned the venture and made Galveston the port of choice. (After Galveston&#x27;s hurricane, shipping traffic recentered over time to inland Houston).

After the 1886 storm, the county seat was moved to Port Lavaca. On October 4, 1887, the post office in Indianola was permanently closed and the town was declared &quot;dead&quot;. Today, almost nothing remains of the original Indianola, as, due to storm erosion, most of the site of the city is now underwater. A granite marker was placed on the shore at the nearest point to the Indianola courthouse, now 300 feet (about 90 meters) away in Matagorda Bay. It reads, &quot;Calhoun County Courthouse. Edward Beaumont, Architect 1859. During the Storms of 1875 and 1886, precious lives were saved within its walls of shell, concrete, and lime. Abandoned 1886.&quot; The site is also home to a statue of René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle.

Indianola is now the site of a small unincorporated fishing village.

== Popular culture ==
=== In literature ===

Frederick Olmsted describes Indianola in his 1860 memoir &quot;Journey through Texas&quot; with the following:

&quot;At the entrance are some prominent gables, and it was so like the approach to a European seaport that we thought of our passports and the &quot;octroi&quot; officers. The beach on which the town is built is some three hundred yards in width, and extends about a mile in length, having but two parallel streets, front and back. It has a more busy and prosperous appearance than Lavacca, and is much larger, but is said to have less heavy business, and less capital. The rivalry is extreme and amusing. At Lavacca we heard of Indianola as &#x27;a little village down the bay (they call it Indianola), where our vessels land goods on their way up.&#x27; Each consider the other to be sickly. Indianola has the advantage of the best water, and of the New Orleans steamers, which land at Powderhorn, a sort of hotel suburb, four miles below, by a hard beach-road, where nine to ten feet of water can be carried. [...] We spent a quiet Sunday at Indianola. The beach beyond the town forms a pleasant promenade, and we enjoyed to the full the calm sunny sea, which seemed like a return to an old friend, after our months of inland journeying. Our hotel was a great improvement on that of the day before. The Germans, who compose half the population, have the enterprise to cultivate vegetable gardens, which furnish, at least, salads at all seasons. Around one of these gardens we noticed a hedge of enormous prickly pear. The native oysters are large and abundant. Game of all kinds is cheap. (pp. 253-254)&quot;

Jefferson McLemore published &quot;Indianola and Other Poems&quot; in 1904.

In Elizabeth Hand&#x27;s novel &quot;Aestival Tide&quot;, a reconstructed Indianola is featured as the lowermost level of the central ziggurat in the dome city of Araboth.

In the novel &quot;Matagorda&quot; by the author Louis L&#x27;Amour, much of the action took place in Indianola, Texas on the day it was destroyed by the 1875 hurricane. The courthouse, the site of which is now underwater out in the bay, was featured as the last refuge of the townspeople.

In Part I of &quot;Isaac&#x27;s Storm&quot;, in the chapter &quot;Galveston: An Absurd Delusion,&quot; Erik Larson describes the two storms that ravaged Indianola and the significance of these storms for Galveston, leading up to the Galveston storm of 1900. He notes: &quot;At first, Galveston&#x27;s leading men seemed to grasp the significance of the Indianola storms. Anyone who looked at a map could see that Galveston was even more vulnerable to destruction than Indianola. It had no picket of barrier islands to shelter it, no buffer of mainland prairie. The city faced the Gulf head-on.&quot; He further observes: &quot;Six weeks after the second Indianola storm, a group of thirty prominent Galveston residents calling themselves the Progressive Association met and resolved to build a seawall&quot;, and &quot;The city&#x27;s &quot;Evening Tribune&quot; endorsed the plan&quot;. However, although &quot;The state eventually did authorize a bond to pay for the work,&quot; the city&#x27;s engineer E.M. Hartwick observed, &quot;this was some months after the flood, and by then the attitude was, Oh, we&#x27;ll never get another one--and they didn&#x27;t build.&quot;

Larson criticizes meteorologist Isaac Cline (among others) for this failure. For example, Larson cites statements Cline published in the July 1891 Galveston &quot;News&quot; article, &quot;West India Hurricanes&quot;:

Further, in Part III of &quot;Isaac&#x27;s Storm&quot;, in a chapter titled &quot;Ritter&#x27;s Cafe: &quot;You Can&#x27;t Frighten Me&quot;&quot;, Larson publishes the recollections of Mollie Cohen, whose impressions of the Galveston Storm of 1900 reminded her of the second Indianola hurricane:
=== In music ===

Singer/songwriter Charlie Robison included a song titled &quot;Indianola&quot; on the 1998 album &quot;Life of the Party&quot;. The song begins from the perspective of a German immigrant approaching Indianola by sea and chronicling details of the narrator&#x27;s family. The narrator and his cousin attempt to traverse the South to join the Union Army in the American Civil War, though they encounter Rebel resistance in Indianola. The next scene of the folk song briefly addresses the Wall Street Crash of 1929 in an indirect fashion, noting that little change occurred in their respective lives other than rust accumulating on wagon wheels. While this verse is brief in regards to words and time, it denotes a subtle and increasing disaffection in the American/Texan experience, adversely affected by seemingly non-relevant incidences. The storyline then progresses to World War II, introducing an internal struggle between the call of duty of the United States and its armed conflict with Germany, the ancestral point of origin of many Americans. The overall sentiment of the song begins as a story of new promises followed by a series of fictional, though personally carved facts, that illustrate a common experience for the individualist. Texas exemplifies a spirit that is not only uniquely a Texan story but an American one, thrusting the individual against the external influence that would assume its right to assert its own values.

Singer/songwriter Brian Burns included the song &quot;Indianola&quot; on his 2004 album &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;. The lyrics chronicle the full life cycle of Indianola, with verses from the points of view of a personified Matagorda Bay, an immigrant who helped build the city (Johann), a worker who came to help &quot;bury the lost souls who perished that day&quot; (Isaac), and finally the songwriter himself visiting the site (Brian). It is unclear whether the &quot;Johann&quot; mentioned in verse three refers to the &quot;Johann Dethardt&quot;, the first ship to bring settlers into the area, or Johann Swartz, the owner/builder of the first home erected in what would become Indianola.

Alternative country singer/songwriter Scott Stutzman included a song titled &quot;The Indianola Sway&quot; on his 2016 single &quot;Halloween Sixteen&quot; (released under the alias Kasko Lunsford). The song likely takes place between the 1875 and 1886 hurricane.

<text>The M47 Dragon, known as the FGM-77 during development, is an American shoulder-fired, man-portable anti-tank guided missile system. It was phased out of U.S. military service in 2001, in favor of the newer FGM-148 Javelin system.

The M47 Dragon uses a wire-guidance system in concert with a high explosive anti-tank warhead and was capable of defeating armored vehicles, fortified bunkers, main battle tanks, and other hardened targets. While it was primarily created to defeat the Soviet Union&#x27;s T-55, T-62, and T-72 tanks, it saw use well into the 1990s, seeing action in the Persian Gulf War. The U.S. military officially retired the weapon in 2001. The United States destroyed the last of its stocks of the missile in 2009. The weapon system remains in active service with other militaries around the world.

==History==

In 1959, the US Army Ordnance Missile Command suggested the development of a heavy medium range assault weapon.

In 1960, the United States Army launched the MAW (Medium Anti-tank Weapon) program on a proposal from Douglas. In 1966, Douglas was awarded the contract to develop the XM47. In 1967, the XM47 was redesignated FGM-77 and FTM-77 (the FTM-77 being the training version). The first missile test took place in December 1967 followed by the first shot in real conditions (firing set, guidance and launcher) on 5 July 1968.

Used by the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine Corps, as well as many foreign militaries, the M47 Dragon was first fielded in January 1975 to U.S. Army soldiers stationed in mainland Europe. In April 1981, the deployment of the base version of the Dragon in the Army was complete. The Army initially deployed the Dragon as a squad weapon, with every rifle squad containing an antiarmor specialist who carried the weapon.

Reorganization in the 1990s saw Dragons moved, with mechanized infantry received two launchers per squad. Infantry, Airborne, and Air Assault units received a pair of two-man ATGM teams in the platoon&#x27;s weapons squad, while Light Infantry (six teams) and Ranger (three teams) units held their Dragons at the company level.

In USMC service, the Dragon was concentrated at the battalion level in a dedicated missile platoon with 32 Dragon teams. The platoon was organized with four sections, each with four squads of two 2-man teams.

==Guidance system==
The M47 Dragon uses a so-called &quot;tracking control assembly&quot; (TCA) guidance system previously used on the TOW and Shillelagh missiles.
With this system, all that is required of the infantryman is to look through an amplifying optical sight and keep it exactly aligned with the objective.

During this time, a second electro-optical system mounted parallel to the sight visually receives thermal radiation (generally infrared) from a pyrotechnic system located on the tail of the missile and focuses it on a sensitive receiver / locator. This continuously measures via a computer the position of the heat source (the missile) in relation to the line of sight fixed on the objective, any deviation automatically causing the desired correction signal, which is in turn transmitted along wires (connecting the missile to the launcher) and that without any intervention by the operator.

==Variants==

===Dragon===
The basic missile, the M222 missile, weighs 11.5 kilograms and is 744mm long in a 1154mm long launch tube. The fairly basic warhead can penetrate 330 mm of armor plate.

===Dragon II===
Dragon II is a simple warhead upgrade, originally called &quot;Dragon PIP&quot; and officially known as MK1 MOD0. The Dragon II received a new warhead that offers an 85% increase in penetration, to about 600mm. Weight increased to 12.3 kilograms and length to 846mm. Dragon II entered service in 1988.

===Dragon III===
A further improved Dragon II, the Dragon III received an even more powerful tandem shaped charge warhead, reportedly a Dragon II head with additional precursor charge. Exact penetration remains unknown, but is likely an improvement over the Dragon II.
Additionally, the motor is improved, allowing the missile to reach a range of 1,000 meters in 6.5 seconds, much faster than the original missile&#x27;s 11 second flight time. The improved motor increases the range as well, propelling Dragon III to 1,500 meters.

The second final improvement is a new combined day/night tracker with laser guidance. Only the United States Marine Corps bought this variant, beginning in 1991, while the Army opted to wait for Javelin to enter service.

===Saeghe===
Iran has reverse-engineered a version of the Dragon, the Saeghe (Persian: صاعقه &quot;lightning&quot;). This version, like many other reverse engineered weaponry built in Iran, is developed by Defense Industries Organization (DIO). They displayed it in 2002 at the Defendory exhibition in Athens, when it was in mass production. Hezbollah has acquired Saeghes for anti-tank and anti-armor uses.

Known versions include Saeghe 1, a copy of Dragon II and Saeghe 2, a copy of Dragon III. Saeghe 3 is not confirmed to exist and Saeghe 4 is believed to use a thermobaric warhead. It is mostly produced for export, only issued to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Saeghe (also transliterated as Saegheh, Saeqeh and several other variations) is a very common name for Iranian weapon systems. Other things with the name include a recon drone, a target drone, a fighter jet based on the American F-5E, an air-to-air missile, and an RPG-7 warhead.

==Components==
The launcher system of the M47 Dragon consists of a smoothbore fiberglass tube, breech/gas generator, tracker, bipod, battery, sling, and forward and aft shock absorbers. To fire the weapon, non-integrated day or night sights must be attached. While the launcher itself is expendable, the sights can be removed and reused.

===SU-36/P Day Sight===
The SU-36/P, properly &quot;Infrared Tracker, Guided Missile, SU-36/P&quot;, provides the user with control over the missile. The sight slots onto the missile tube and The SU-36/P has a 6x magnification capability and a viewing angle of 6°. The simple crosshair reticle has a pair of stadia lines To the right of the gunner&#x27;s monocular is an infrared receiver, consisting of a large lens fitted with a filter used to capture the infrared signal emitted by the missile during its flight.

===Night Sight AN/TAS-5===
The Dragon night tracker (AN/TAS-5) increases the gunner&#x27;s ability to engage targets during limited visibility. Targets can be engaged during daylight and also during limited visibility such as smoke, fog, or darkness.

<text>The Obey River is a tributary of the Cumberland River in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It joins the Cumberland River near the town of Celina, which is generally considered to be the Cumberland&#x27;s head of navigation. Via the Cumberland and Ohio rivers, the Obey River is part of the Mississippi River watershed.

Near its mouth, the Obey is impounded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Dale Hollow Reservoir, site of a fish hatchery run by the federal government. This dam impounds the Obey for essentially its entire length, causing slack water well up both major tributaries, the East and West Forks. This lake is relatively deep due to the height of the dam and the depth of the gorges through which the Obey and its tributaries flowed; the impoundment also enters Kentucky in its Wolf River and Sulphur Creek and Illwill Creek embayments.

Below the dam the stream makes two sharp bends before entering the Cumberland. The only major bridge on the free-flowing Obey, on State Route 53, is located just below the second of these, Peterman Bend.

<doc id="891446" wikidata="Q429114" url="?curid=891446" title="Alfred O. C. Nier">
<text>Alfred Otto Carl Nier (May 28, 1911 – May 16, 1994) was an American physicist who pioneered the development of mass spectrometry. He was the first to use mass spectrometry to isolate uranium-235 which was used to demonstrate that 235U could undergo fission and developed the sector mass spectrometer configuration now known as Nier-Johnson geometry.

==Early life and education==
He was born in St. Paul, Minnesota on May 28, 1911. Nier showed an early ability in mathematics and science, coupled with an aptitude for craft and mechanical work. Nier&#x27;s German immigrant parents had little education or financial resources but their determination for his development meant that he was able to attend the nearby University of Minnesota. Though he graduated in electrical engineering in 1931, the lack of engineering jobs during the Great Depression encouraged him to take up graduate study in physics.

==Career==
===Harvard===
In 1936, his spectroscopic skills won him a fellowship and substantial grant at Harvard University. His work there led to the 1938 publication of measurements of the relative abundance of the isotopes of uranium, measurements that were used by Fritz Houtermans and Arthur Holmes in the 1940s to estimate the age of the Earth.

===The Manhattan Project===
Nier returned to Minnesota in 1938 to be near his ageing parents. In 1940, on the request of Enrico Fermi, he and a few students, including Edward Ney, prepared a pure sample of uranium-235 using an early mass spectrograph designed by Nier, for John R. Dunning&#x27;s team at Columbia University. On the day of its receipt (it was sent by US Postal Mail), Dunning&#x27;s team was able to demonstrate that uranium-235 was the isotope responsible for nuclear fission, rather than the more abundant uranium-238. Confirmation of this suspected fact was a critical step in the development of the atomic bomb.

From 1943 to 1945, Nier worked with Kellex Corporation in Manhattan, New York City on the design and development of efficient and effective mass spectrographs for use in the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb in World War II. During the war most of the spectrographs used for monitoring uranium separations were designed by Nier.

===Later work===
After the war, he returned to Minnesota where he worked on geochronology, the upper atmosphere, space science and noble gases. Nier designed the miniature mass spectrometers used by the Viking Landers to sample the atmosphere of Mars.

==Death==
Active to the end of his life, he died on May 16, 1994, two weeks after being paralysed in a motor accident.

==Honors==
Nier was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a foreign scientific member of the Max Planck Society.

The Martian crater Nier and the mineral nierite (tiny silicon nitride inclusions in meteorites) were named after him. The Nier Prize is awarded annually by the Meteoritical Society and recognizes outstanding research in meteoritics and closely allied fields by young scientists.

<text>The Power Player Super Joy III (also known as Power Joy, Power Games, and XA-76-1E) is a Nintendo Entertainment System/Famicom video game console clone. It is notable for legal issues based on the violation of intellectual property rights held by Nintendo and its various game licensees. Manufactured by Sinango, the Power Player has been sold in North America, Brazil, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

==Hardware==
The system resembles a Nintendo 64 controller and attaches to a TV set. NTSC, PAL and SECAM versions are available. They all use a custom &quot;NES-on-a-chip&quot; (NOAC) that is an implementation of the NES&#x27;s hardware such as its custom 6502, PPU, and PAPU.

The units resemble a Nintendo 64 controller, sometimes with a cartridge slot for Famicom games. They come packaged with a secondary 9-pin 6 button controller resembling a Sega Genesis controller, intended for a second player. They are packaged with a 9-pin light gun resembling a Walther PPK pistol. There is a non-moving joystick, added for visual appeal. Though the Power Player Super Joy&#x27;s button layout is identical to that of the Nintendo 64 controller, the buttons have been mapped differently. The C buttons of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s controller function as A and B on the Super Joy, the A and B buttons of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s controller are Start and Select on the Super Joy, respectively. Finally, the N64 controller&#x27;s Start button is the Reset button on the Super Joy. The units are available in multiple colors, including black, grey, red, and blue.

The consoles have 76 built-in games, although marketing frequently claims to have more than 1,000 ways of playing them. Hence, the game count of 76,000 is listed as a gold sticker on the box. Most of the included games had been originally released for the NES or Famicom, but some have been created by the manufacturer. Most of the games have had their title screen graphics removed to save space on the ROM chip.

There are a number of scenes depicted on the front and back of the boxes, but all of them are artistic stylized drawings or retouched photos—none of them are actual game screenshots. Some versions sold in the US have an unlicensed still image from &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; on the front of the box.

After this product gained some popularity, the Power Player 3.5, an improved model with more games, was released. A wireless version of Power Games was also released.

The console can possibly have issues where it starts smoldering when turned on.

==History==

When Nintendo discovered this product line, the company began strong legal action against importers and sellers of the consoles, and have obtained a temporary injunction against the import and sale of video game systems containing counterfeit versions of Nintendo games.

On December 16, 2004, the FBI executed search warrants at two kiosks at the Mall of America in Minnesota and also searched storage facilities rented by Yonatan Cohen, an owner of Perfect Deal LLC of Miami, Florida. The consoles, purchased wholesale at $7 to $9 each, sold for $30 to $70 each. After confiscating 1,800 units of Power Player, each containing 76 copyrighted video game titles belonging primarily to Nintendo or its licensees, Cohen was charged in Minneapolis, Minnesota in January 2005 with federal criminal infringement of copyright for selling Power Player video games at kiosks at the Mall of America and other malls across the nation. In April 2005, Cohen pleaded guilty to selling illegally copied video games.

Nine days after Cohen&#x27;s guilty plea, 40 FBI agents arrested four Chinese nationals working in an international copyright infringement ring and seized 60,000 Power Player consoles in searches in Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and Maple Shade, New Jersey.

In November 2005, Cohen was sentenced to five years in federal prison and was required to run ads in mall magazines to tell the public how he illegally sold knockoff video games at Mall of America kiosks.

Several shopping malls quit selling these products, though the product was still sold by other dealers such as flea markets.

==List of built-in games==
*On version 3.0 of PPSJ, all these items duplicated themselves circa 1,000 times; hence the claim to have 76,000 games built in when the true count is only 76. Version 3.5 has a more honest description and uses the titles once.
*In the games list, there is a message at the top that says &quot;FUNTIME 76000 IN 1&quot; or &quot;FUNTIME 76 IN 1&quot;.
*Additional games can be played if a Famicom cartridge is inserted, or a NES cartridge is used with an adapter, although some hardware variants require the plastic housing to be trimmed to fit cartridges in the Famicom slot.
*Many of the game titles in the system menu are abbreviated, misspelled, use alternate names for the game, or are simply wrong (e.g. Burgertime and Tekken). In this list, an effort has been made to use the proper name for the games, with the PPSJ menu name in parentheses for known differences.
*This game incorporates menu selection sounds from the game &quot;Action 52&quot;.
*When the system starts up, the words &quot;FUN TIME&quot; appear flashing on the screen. (This may not show up on LCD TVs because the system gives off a weak TV signal and then improves later during gameplay.)

<text>Stanisław Antoni Grochowiak, pen-name &quot;Kain&quot; (24 January 1934 – 2 September 1976) was a Polish poet and dramatist. His is often classified as a representative of turpism (Polish: turpizm), because of his interest in the physical, ugly and brutal, but he also exhibits strong tendencies toward formal, rhymed poetry, reaching on many occasions the ornamental grace of a baroque style. Grochowiak was born in Leszno and died, aged 42, in Warsaw.

Grochowiak is considered one of the leaders of the Polish &quot;new wave&quot; along with poets such as Zbigniew Herbert and Miron Białoszewski.

<text>Eaton Hodgkinson (26 February 1789 – 18 June 1861) was an English engineer, a pioneer of the application of mathematics to problems of structural design.

==Early life==
Hodgkinson was born in the village of Anderton, near Northwich, Cheshire, to a farming family. His father died when he was six years old, and he was raised with his two sisters by his mother, who maintained the farming business. He went to Witton Grammar School in Northwich where he studied the classics to prepare for a career in the Church of England. The regime was unsuited to his tastes and talents which were already showing promise in mathematics. His mother moved him to a less prestigious private school in Northwich where his enthusiasm for mathematics was encouraged and fostered but, as the young Hodgkinson grew physically, he became indispensable on the family farm and soon left education to devote himself there.

Farming was no more to his taste than Greek and Latin and his mother yearned to satisfy her son&#x27;s appetites. Family friends advised that Hodgkinson might find some more suitable outlet in nearby Manchester and so, in 1811, the family left for Salford to open a pawnbroking business. Hodgkinson used all his spare time in reading science and mathematics and soon introduced himself into Manchester&#x27;s scientific community, meeting, among others, his future collaborator, Sir William Fairbairn. He became a pupil of John Dalton, studying mathematics, and the two remained firm friends until Dalton&#x27;s death in 1844. He retired early from the family business to devote a modest pension to his scientific work.

He married twice, to Catherine Johns and to a Miss Holditch. There were no children.

==Scientific work==

Hodgkinson measured the strength of columns of materials including cast iron and marble in a series of experiments.

Hodgkinson worked with Sir William Fairbairn in Manchester on the design of iron beams, especially on the Water Street bridge for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1828–30. His improved cross section was published by the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1830 and influenced much nineteenth century structural engineering. He derived the empirical formula for a concentrated load, &quot;W&quot; (in tons), at which a beam will fail as a function of its length between simple supports, &quot;L&quot; (in inches); its depth, &quot;d&quot; (in inches); and its bottom-flange area, &quot;A&quot; (inch²):
:formula_1
His expertise with beams led to his retention, along with Fairbairn, as consultant on the novel tubular design for the Britannia Bridge. Fairbairn built and tested several prototypes, and developed the final form adopted for the bridge. Both Hodgkinson and Robert Stephenson believed that extra chains would be needed to support the heavy spans, so the towers were built with spaces for the chains. Fairbairn, however, insisted that chains would not be necessary, and his opinion prevailed. He was right, and chains were never used, but the towers remain with their empty recesses.

==Later years==
Hodgkinson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1841 and, in 1847, he became professor of the mechanical principles of engineering at University College London. In 1849, he was appointed by the UK Parliament to participate in a Royal Commission to investigate the application of iron in railroad structures, performing some early investigations of metal fatigue.

Towards the end of his life, his mental faculties failed and he died at Higher Broughton, Salford.

<text>Julia Barr (born Julia Rose Buchheit on February 8, 1949 in Fort Wayne, Indiana) is an American actress. Barr is most famous for her role on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;, playing the character of Brooke English. She played the role from 1976 to 1981 and from 1982 to December 20, 2006, with other special and short appearances.

Growing up as an only child in Fort Wayne, Barr made her acting debut at the age of 13 in a production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. This helped her decide to pursue acting as a career, and by the time she graduated from Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, she had performed in 25 professional productions. She spent two years at the Studio Arena Theater in Buffalo, New York.

==Career==
Barr broke into soap operas with a short stint as bad girl Reenie Szabo on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. She was invited to join the cast of &quot;All My Children&quot; as Brooke English, succeeding Elissa Leeds in the role. Her portrayal of Brooke garnered Barr eight Daytime Emmy Award nominations (1980, 1981, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1998 and 2001), winning the award in 1990 and again in 1998 for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Barr became close friends with noted actress Ruth Warrick, who portrayed her aunt Phoebe on the show until her death in 2005.

Barr took a 15-month break from the show beginning in 1981, during which time she toured with Katharine Hepburn and Dorothy Loudon in the national touring company of West Side Waltz. She returned to the show in 1982.

Despite fan outcry, Barr&#x27;s airtime on AMC diminished in the early 2000s with her character Brooke only being used to further other characters story lines. In late 2006, executives at ABC did not renew Barr&#x27;s contract, and offered her recurring status (without a guarantee of appearances). Barr declined. Fans of the show, and particularly Barr, were upset. Barr&#x27;s contract officially expired in December 2006 and her last regular episode aired on December 20. The character was not given an exit and simply stopped appearing, which further fueled fan outrage.

In 2007, Barr teamed up her with &quot;All My Children&quot; co-star Jill Larson to produce and write a web series titled The Vindicated, which about three women, who are at a point in their lives in which they are without their male counterparts for different reasons. The project was written in 2007 and filmed in 2008. A final product is still in the works.

Barr returned to &quot;AMC&quot; for the soap&#x27;s 40th anniversary on January 4 and 5, 2010. Barr again returned to &quot;AMC&quot; in February 2010 for a brief stint coinciding with the retirement of David Canary (Adam Chandler) on April 23, 2010.

Barr&#x27;s final return to &quot;All My Children&quot; as Brooke English was in September 2011 in the final episodes of the show&#x27;s ABC run. It was announced in February 2013 that she would appear as Brooke on the show&#x27;s online revival. On April 29, 2013, it was confirmed that the show had been revived, with Barr playing the role of Brooke English. &quot;All My Children&quot; ended again in November 2013.

==Personal life==
Barr&#x27;s first marriage, to Richard Barr, ended in divorce. She met her second husband, Richard Hirschlag, in a musical comedy class. Barr married Hirschlag on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1982 in a Manhattan brownstone. Together they have a daughter named Allison who is also an actress; she briefly appeared as Lizzie Spaulding on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.

Barr is an advocate of animal rights and spokesperson for the Fund for Animals. She recorded a Christmas album in 2002, &quot;From Our House...To Yours&quot;, to raise money for The Fund For Animals.

Barr is a spokesperson for First Step, a job-readiness program, as part of the Coalition for the Homeless in New York City.

<text>123 (one hundred [and] twenty-three) is the natural number following 122 and preceding 124.

==In mathematics==
*123 is a Lucas number. It is the eleventh member of the Mian–Chowla sequence.
*Along with 6, 123 is one of only two positive integers that is simultaneously two more than a perfect square and two less than a perfect cube (123 = 112 + 2 = 53 - 2).

<doc id="891488" wikidata="Q473139" url="?curid=891488" title="Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer">
<text>Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer (12 February 1865 – 18 January 1940) was a Polish Goral poet, novelist, playwright, journalist and writer. He was a member of the Young Poland movement.

==Life==
Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer was born in Ludźmierz in Podhale near the Tatra Mountains, then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire now in Poland, and died in Warsaw. His older half-brother was the painter Włodzimierz Tetmajer. Przerwa-Tetmajer studied classics and philosophy at the Jagiellonian University in 1884–1889. He then became a journalist at &quot;Kurier Polski&quot;, and lived both in the Tatras and in Kraków (Cracow). After World War I he moved to Warsaw to serve as president of the Society of Writers and Journalists. In 1934 he was made honorary member of the Polish Academy of Literature.

Przerwa-Tetmajer suffered from a mental illness in the latter years of his life, which prevented him from writing. He was living in a hospice in 1940 when the German occupants evicted all the patients. He was left homeless and died shortly afterwards in a Warsaw hospital.

==Work==
Przerwa-Tetmajer wrote seven collections of poetry before World War I. 
He is particularly well known for his works about the Tatra mountains. 
At least one of his poems, &quot;Kriváň, High Kriváň!&quot; (&quot;Krywaniu, Krywaniu wysoki!&quot;) is now often taken for an authentic folk song and was credited as such on a similarly named 1972 folk-rock album by Skaldowie. According to Barry Keane from &quot;The Warsaw Voice&quot;:
Przerwa Tetmajer was primarily a lyrical poet who articulated the birth pangs of modernism at the turn of the century, but he will be best remembered for his erotic verse and for poems evoking his beloved Tatra mountains. He broke with age-old subtleties and niceties common to amorous poetry and wrote on love in frank and provocative terms. The poet simultaneously attracted huge praise from legions of readers and loud accusations of depravity from other quarters... at the close of the 19th century.

His work was also part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="891490" wikidata="Q1322437" url="?curid=891490" title="Pop'n Music">
<text>, commonly abbreviated as Pop&#x27;n, PM or PNM and stylized as pop&#x27;n music, is a music video game series in the Bemani series made by Konami. The games are known for their bright colors, upbeat songs, and cute cartoon character graphics. Originally released in 1998, the series has had 22 home releases in Japan as well as 30 mainline arcade versions.

==Gameplay==
Unlike most of Konami&#x27;s Bemani series, the &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; interface is not designed to represent any actual musical instrument. Instead, it uses nine buttons, each three-and-a-half-inches in diameter, laid out in two rows (since the location test of Wonderland, a multitouch panel is added). Five buttons are the bottom row, the other four being the top. Like in most Bemani games, color-coded notes (in this game called &quot;Pop-kun&quot; (ポップ君) and anthropomorphized with faces) fall from the top of the screen in nine columns that correspond to the buttons. When a note reaches the red line at the bottom of the screen, the player presses the button or tap the panel, which triggers a sound within the song.

When a note is played, an accuracy rating is displayed, either &quot;Great&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, or &quot;Bad&quot;. The maximum number of points possible in any single-stage song is 100,000, and unlike beatmania or beatmania IIDX, can not be exceeded as no additional score bonuses are given. A &quot;Combo&quot; tally is kept of properly played notes like in other Bemani games, but always excludes the first note played; for example, if a song has 322 notes, the maximum combo will be 321. Until &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 6&quot;, &quot;Good&quot; notes would interrupt a player&#x27;s combo.

Each song is represented by a character, and players are represented by characters too. The player can choose a character by pressing both yellow buttons on the mode selection screen, but as of &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 19 TUNE STREET&quot;, the character selection screen automatically pops up after choosing a mode. The default player characters are anthropomorphic rabbit Mimi and anthropomorphic cat Nyami.

In all modes from &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 6&quot; and onward, after a song is selected, a splash screen that is displayed showing the character, banner, and BPM of the song. When the player presses both yellow buttons at this screen, an options menu is displayed, where the player can edit the following gameplay options:
* Hi-Speed: This option allows player to change the scrolling speed of the notes.
* Pop-kun: This option changes the appearance of the notes that appear on the screen.
* Appearance: The options here affect the visibility of the notes on the screen.
* Random: These options affect how the patterns of notes are processed.

Like other Bemani series games, the &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; games have a &quot;Groove Gauge&quot; that shows the player&#x27;s performance. Continually playing the notes in the song properly will cause the Groove Gauge to rise. The goal of the player is to finish the song with the Groove Gauge in the &quot;clear zone&quot;, a red portion that represents the top quarter of the bar. When the gauge is at its maximum, &quot;Great&quot; notes become &quot;Fever&quot; - this is purely aesthetic, providing no bonus to score, and usually causes the player&#x27;s chosen character to perform a different animation. If a player ends a song while in Fever mode, the character&#x27;s win animation is also often different.

===Modes===
====Battle Mode====
Two players compete against each other on the same cabinet or controller using only three buttons (Green, Yellow, and White) to play the same note chart, and a fourth &quot;action&quot; button (Blue). As a player scores &quot;Great&quot; ratings on notes, a power meter increases near the bottom of the screen, and once it reaches a certain level, the player can press the action button. Doing so starts a minigame along the bottom of the screen, requiring the players to alternate pressing the action button in time with the song, in addition to playing the note chart. When one of the players misses, an Ojama is inflicted on them.

====Expert Mode====
Introduced in &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 6&quot; is Expert Mode (or Expert Courses), similar to Nonstop Mode in other Bemani series. The player selects from a pre-made course of four songs and plays through the selected course with a &quot;Stamina&quot; life bar that does not recover. In this mode, another accuracy score is added, &quot;Cool&quot;. This makes songs played in these modes significantly more difficult to achieve high scores on, as the value of &quot;Great&quot; and &quot;Good&quot; are decreased. In this mode, &quot;Great&quot; does not become Fever, and instead &quot;Cool&quot; flashes in a similar manner to how &quot;Fever&quot; is displayed in other modes. Expert Mode was removed after &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 18 Sengoku Retsuden&quot;, but returned in &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Lapistoria&quot;.

====Challenge and Cho-Challenge Modes====
Introduced in &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 5&quot;, Challenge Mode (CHALLENGE モード) is a mode where players are not only scored on their individual songs, but are also given a Challenge Score. Each song is assigned a point value on a scale from 1 to 50 (formerly 1 to 43) regarding to the difficulty, and at the end of a game in one of these modes, the total is tallied. Additionally in these modes, options called &quot;Norma&quot; and &quot;Ojama&quot; may be used to add point values to the player&#x27;s Challenge Score. A &quot;Norma&quot; is a set goal, while an &quot;Ojama&quot; is an active means of periodically distracting or disrupting the player. Up to two options can be activated at once. On specific numbers, a player may be allowed an &quot;EXtra Stage&quot;, an additional stage in which the most difficult charts (EXTRA or &quot;EX&quot; charts) for certain songs may be played and unlocked. EXtra stages use a different gauge than usual, a &quot;Stamina&quot; gauge similar to the life bar in a fighting game, or &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; ″s Life Gauge, where complete depletion means the end of the song. It was renamed &quot;Normal Mode&quot; in &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 20 Fantasia&quot;.

Cho-Challenge Mode (超CHALLENGE モード, &quot;Super Challenge Mode&quot;) is similar to Challenge Mode, except that another accuracy score is added, &quot;Cool&quot;. This makes songs played in these modes significantly more difficult to achieve high scores on, as the value of &quot;Great&quot; and &quot;Good&quot; are decreased. Starting from &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Portable&quot; on console releases and &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 20 Fantasia&quot; on arcade releases, &quot;Cool&quot; is always on, regarding to Challenge Mode and Cho-Challenge Mode are combined into one single mode.

====Osusume (オススメ, &quot;Lit. &quot;Recommendation&quot;&quot;)====
Introduced in &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 9&quot; is Osusume (オススメ, &quot;Lit. &quot;Recommendation&quot;&quot;) Mode, where the player is asked a series of questions, and the game provides an Expert course based on the player&#x27;s answers. It was removed after &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 11&quot;, but was reintroduced in &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 20: Fantasia&quot; as a song category within normal mode, containing a selection of songs the player might like, based on the player&#x27;s song selection history.

====Net Taisen Mode (NET対戦 モード, &quot;Net Battle Mode&quot;)====
With the introduction of the e-AMUSEMENT system in Japan, &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 12 Iroha&quot; is the first game to feature &quot;Net Taisen Mode&quot; (NET対戦 モード, &quot;Net Battle Mode&quot;). This mode allows players to compete over the e-AMUSEMENT network in real time with players on other e-AMUSEMENT-ready cabinets. In &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 17 The Movie&quot;, a CPU-emulated version of this mode has been added, similar to the &quot;Taisen&quot; mode found on consumer releases.

====Enjoy Mode====
Starting in &quot;Pop&#x27;n music 12 Iroha&quot;, &quot;Normal Mode&quot;, the standard mode of play, has been removed, replaced instead by &quot;Enjoy Mode&quot;. Enjoy Mode is a simplified mode for beginners with a reduced song list, simple note charts, and a less complex grading system, in which the player begins with 100 points and is docked one for each note they fail to play properly. Enjoy Mode incorporates many of the games licensed tracks, providing most players in Japan a mode in which they know the songs and can more easily become interested in the game. Enjoy Mode was renamed &quot;Easy Mode&quot; in &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 20 Fantasia&quot;, and removed as a whole in &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Sunny Park&quot;, to be replaced with a new difficulty for Normal Mode: &quot;Easy&quot;.

==Design and difficulty==

Unlike most other Bemani games, the games in &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; do not mimic an instrument in gameplay. The buttons are used to play various instruments throughout any given song. The graphics feature brightly colored and primarily solid shapes, rather than the metallic and textured interfaces of other Bemani games. Players may choose a character to play as. The songs are separated by genres like Reggae, Disco Queen, Spy, or Anime Hero, as well as common Bemani genres of Eurobeat and forms of electronica. There are also series of songs with similar elements, like the Classic series (which are medleys of classical music) and the Powerfolk series. Each song has a variety of modes. These include Enjoy Mode (beginner and Easy notes), 5-line Mode (for 5 buttons) and Normal mode (on-beat notes and simple chords). Most songs have a hyper mode (with more notes and harder chords), and some songs have an EXtra mode (with lots of notes and complicated chords). &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; has no other visuals except for the character the player chose, an opponent character, and the scrolling notes. The characters are animated, and act differently based on the player&#x27;s performance.

&quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; games can be challenging at high difficulty levels. The higher difficulty levels are considered by some players to be the most challenging of any music game. However, &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; also features easier content for beginners. In this way, &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; caters to a wide variety of players.

===&quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Mickey Tunes&quot; (2000)===
&quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Mickey Tunes&quot; contains Disney music and Disney characters as opposed to the usual characters and songs made specifically for the &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; series. The PlayStation port is known as &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Disney Tunes&quot;.

===&quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Animelo 2&quot; (2001)===
&quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Animelo 2&quot; is the most expensive &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; version to date, due to its song list consisting completely of anime, as well as television show, licensed songs. This version is also the only one with the infamous &quot;double&quot; and &quot;triple&quot; modes. These options were originally provided with the intention of allowing multiple people to play along by adding one or two more notes for every note in the chart, sometimes resulting in a chord of all nine buttons, but it became a popular challenge for a single player to play a song in &quot;double&quot; or &quot;triple&quot; mode.

==Consumer software==
===Home versions===
The first four console games for the &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; series were released on the PlayStation and the Dreamcast, with nine buttons on the controller. Two other main games were released exclusively for the PlayStation, while two spin-offs were released for both the PlayStation and the Game Boy Color. These games are as follows:
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 2&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 3 Append Disc&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 4 Append Disc&quot;

* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 5&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 6&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Animation Melody&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Disney Tunes&quot;
The first two games share 19 songs in common. &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 2&quot; also added 27 new songs, for a total of 46, and features Key Disc technology to allow play of Append Disc games. &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 3&quot; features a total of 44 songs, split between 22 new songs and 22 returning songs, though eight of these returning songs feature more challenging Hyper charts instead. As an Append Disc, it functions like an expansion pack, requiring a Key Disc to play. &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 4&quot; features a total of 41 songs, of which five are returning. This is the final release for Dreamcast. Like its predecessor, it requires a Key Disc.

&quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 5&quot; was the first game in the main series to be exclusive to PlayStation. It featured 63 songs. Like &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 2&quot;, it also features Key Disc technology, allowing play of its two predecessors. &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 6&quot; featured 104 songs, the largest library available for the original PlayStation and the final game for that system. Like its predecessor and &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 2&quot;, it also features Key Disc technology.

Future console games for the main series and one compilation, all released from 2002 to 2007, are PlayStation 2 exclusives:

* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 7&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 8&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 9&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 10&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 11&quot;

* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 12 いろは (Iroha)&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 13 カーニバル (Carnival)&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 14 FEVER!&quot;
* &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Best Hits&quot;

A revised controller was also released for the PS2 at the same time as &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 10&quot;, though it is also compatible with the original PlayStation.

===Handheld versions===
&quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Anywhere&quot; was a mini-game released for the VMU and PocketStation, handheld memory cards for the Dreamcast and PlayStation, respectively. The mini-game can be loaded using &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 2&quot; and &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 4&quot; for each respective console.

&quot;Pop&#x27;n Music GB&quot; was released on March 30, 2000, for the Game Boy Color. It features 25 songs. Two spin-offs, &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Animation Melody&quot; and &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Disney Tunes&quot;, were released in September 2000. All games use five buttons for charts instead of nine.

&quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Portable&quot; was released on PlayStation Portable on February 4, 2010. It is based on the console version of &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 15 Adventure&quot;, and the song list and interface are based on that game. A sequel, &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music Portable 2&quot; was released on November 23, 2011. The game is based on &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 16 PARTY&quot;, and offers DLC songs available for purchase.

==&quot;Pop&#x27;n Stage&quot;==
&quot;Pop&#x27;n Stage&quot; is a dancing game based around the &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; design and songs, with ten &quot;switches&quot; (four diagonals and a center on each side, just like &quot;Pump It Up&quot;″s panel placement). It is a combination of &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; and &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, using &quot;Pop&#x27;n&quot;-style graphics with &quot;DDR&quot;-style gameplay. The game has a bright, colorful interface and machine design, and is considered easy compared to most other Bemani games. The game is also keysounded, similarly to &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot;, meaning that missing a step will result in corresponding sounds in the song not being played.

&quot;Pop&#x27;n Stage&quot; breaks up gameplay styles in an unconventional way compared to other dance games; the default single player mode uses 6-switches (corresponding to &quot;Pump It Up&quot;″s half double; in other words, 6-switch mode does not use the four outer corners). Meanwhile, 10-switch mode is the default 2-player configuration on &quot;Normal&quot; and &quot;Hard&quot; modes (corresponding to 5-switches per person on each side, similar to &quot;Pump It Up&quot;″s single player mode) and &quot;Maniac&quot; mode being similar to a single-player &quot;double-play&quot; mode.

One upgrade kit was released for this franchise before being cancelled under the name &quot;Pop&#x27;n Stage EX&quot;. This upgrade fixed a handful of gameplay issues from the first game, added new charts and &quot;Expert mode&quot; stages, and added songs from &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music 3&quot; (as well as the song &quot;Full Moon&quot; by LITTLE CURE, which has never been used on another Bemani game since). Both versions of the game ran on Konami&#x27;s &quot;DJ Main&quot; arcade hardware.

<doc id="891511" wikidata="Q371744" url="?curid=891511" title="Marcomer">
<text>Marcomer, also spelled Marcomeres, Marchomer, or Marchomir (c. ? - 392) was a Frankish Dux in the late 4th century who assisted in an invasion of the Roman Empire in the year 388, as the usurper and leader of the whole of Roman Gaul, Magnus Maximus, was surrounded by Theodosius I in the city of Aquileia.

==History==
The invasion is documented by Gregory of Tours who cited the now lost work of Sulpicius Alexander. According to this account, Marcomer, Sunno and Genobaud invaded the Roman provinces Germania Inferior and Gallia Belgica in Gaul. They broke through the limes, killed many people, destroyed the most fruitful lands and made the city of Cologne panic.

After this raid, the main body of the Franks moved back over the Rhine with their booty. Some of the Franks remained in the Belgian wood called &quot;Silva Carbonaria&quot;. When the Roman generals Magnus Maximus, Nanninus and Quintinus heard the news in Trier, they attacked those remaining Frankish forces near the Silva Carbonaria and killed many of them. After this engagement, Quintinus crossed the Rhine to punish the Franks in their own country, however his army was surrounded and beaten. Some Roman soldiers drowned in the marshes, others were killed by Franks; few made it back to the Empire.

Nanninus and Quintinus were replaced by Charietto and Syrus, who were again confronted by an attack of unidentified Franks.

Later, after the 388 fall of Magnus Maximus, Marcomer and Sunno held a short meeting about the recent attacks with the Frank Arbogastes, who was a general (&quot;magister militum&quot;) in the Roman army. The Franks delivered hostages as usual, and Arbogastes returned to his winter quarters in Trier.

A couple of years later when Arbogastes had seized power and the West Roman army was dominated by Frankish officers, he crossed the Rhine with a Roman army into Germania. Marcomer was seen as leader with Chatti and Ampsivarii but the two did not engage.

Later we hear from the poet Claudian that Marcomer was captured by Romans and exiled to a villa in Tuscany. His brother Sunno crossed the Rhine and tried to become leader of the band of Marcomer, but was killed by his own people.

According to the later &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;, Marcomer was a descendant of the Trojans and a son of a king called Priam. The Liber also relates that Marcomer tried to unite the Franks after the death of Sunno. He proposed that the Franks should live under one king and proposed his own son Pharamond (whose earliest mention is in this work, and who is considered legendary by scholars) for the kingship. This source does not relate whether Marcomer succeeded, but from other later sources that recall the account of &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;, the impression may be gained that Pharamond was regarded as the first king of the Franks. However, modern scholars, such as Edward James, do not accept this account in the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot; as historical.

<text>Franz Sacher (16 December 1816 – 11 March 1907) was an Austrian confectioner, best known as the inventor of the Sachertorte.

==Biography==

According to Sacher&#x27;s son Eduard, in 1832 Austria&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs, Prince Metternich, ordered his court&#x27;s kitchen to create a special dessert for a dinner to be attended by high-ranking guests. &quot;Dass er mir aber keine Schand&#x27; macht, heut&#x27; Abend!&quot; (&quot;Let there be no shame on me tonight!&quot;), he is reported to have declared. On the day of the dinner the chief cook of Metternich&#x27;s household was taken ill, and the task of preparing the dessert had to be passed to Franz Sacher, then in his second year of apprenticeship at the palace. The result would be the chocolate cake devised on the spot by the 16-year-old trainee. The story was probably invented by Eduard many years later, to appeal to &quot;Viennese nostalgic for their imperial past&quot;.

Sacher was born in Vienna to Jewish parents Anton Sacher and Anna Löw and died in Baden bei Wien, where he was buried in the Catholic Helenenfriedhof (Saint Helena Cemetery). Eduard opened the Hotel Sacher in 1876, near the State Opera House in Vienna. The Sachertorte is said to be instrumental in spreading the fame of the hotel; or perhaps the other way around. The exact recipe as created by Sacher himself is a closely guarded secret.

== Personal life ==
Franz Sacher and his wife Rosa b. Wieninger had three sons.

* Franz († 1889; Age: 48/49) took over the business of his father in the 1860s, and later became the restaurateur and hotelier in Bucharest, then Head of Marine Casinos in Pula; 
* Eduard (1843–1892) founded the Hotel Sacher in Vienna in 1876;
* Carl (1849–1929) founded Sacher&#x27;s Hotel &amp; Curanstalt in Helenental in 1881.

==Tribute==
On 19 December 2016, Google celebrated Sacher&#x27;s 200th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<text>A hardtop is a rigid form of automobile roof, typically metal, and integral to the vehicle&#x27;s design, strength, and style. The term typically applies to a pillarless hardtop, a car body style without a B-pillar. The term &quot;pillared hardtop&quot; was used in the 1970s to refer to cars that had a B-pillar but had frameless door glass like a pillarless hardtop.

In limited cases, a hardtop roof can be detachable (often designed to store in the trunk), or retractable within the vehicle itself.

== Pillarless hardtop ==


The pillarless hardtop (abbreviated as &quot;hardtop&quot;) is a post-World War II car body designed with no center or B-pillar or glass frames. If window glass frames are present, they are designed to retract with the window when lowered. This creates an impression of uninterrupted glass along the side of the car. Even the smaller automakers like Packard introduced two-door hardtops in 1952 &quot;as a response to America&#x27;s newly discovered fondness for sportier looking cars that resembled a convertible, but had the comfort and convenience of a two-door sedan.&quot;

In one instance, stylists added faux ribbing to a hardtop roof to make it appear to be like a convertible top,

By the mid-1960s, optional vinyl roofs became widely available in virtually all model lines, reinforcing the convertible look in hardtops.

A pillarless hardtop is inherently less rigid than a pillared body, requiring extra underbody strength to prevent shaking. Production hardtops commonly share the frame or reinforced body structure of the contemporary convertible model, which is reinforced to compensate for the lack of a fixed roof. The hardtop design received criticism that its roof structure may not provide adequate protection during a rollover crash. However, subsequent research reported that rates of serious or
fatal injury in hardtop models (both two- and four-door versions), as well as four-door station wagons, were significantly lower than sedans while the rates of any degree of injury for those same body styles were also significantly lower. A 1980 study for evaluation of rollover test devices reported that a greater degree of roof crush was associated with hardtop body styles, but severe passenger injury was not more frequent than in the other car body styles.

The hardtop body style began to disappear along with convertibles in the mid-1970s, partly out of a concern that U.S. federal safety regulations would be onerous for pillarless models to pass. The ascendancy of monocoque construction also made the pillarless design less practical. Some models adopted modified roof styling, placing the B-pillars behind the tinted side window glass and painting or molding the outer side of each pillar in black to make them less visible, creating a hardtop look without actually omitting the pillar. Some mid- to late-1970s models continued their previous two-door hardtop bodies, but with fixed rear windows or a variety of vinyl roof and opera window treatments.

By the end of the 1990s, almost all hardtop designs were discontinued as structural integrity standards increased.

Hardtops were typically more expensive than regular sedan models when new. They are more collectible than standard models of the same vehicle, which have a B-pillar.

=== Origins ===

Early automobiles had no roof or sides, but by 1900, several cars were offered with fabric roofs and primitive folding tops. However, cars with fully closed bodies (i.e., with a rigid roof and sides) grew in popularity and soon became the norm.

In 1915–1918, the first pillarless hardtop cars were produced, then called &quot;convertible cars&quot; (or &quot;touring sedans&quot; or &quot;Springfields&quot;). The Springfield design featured folding upper frames on the doors and the rear glass frames are removable and stored under or behind the seats. In the late teens, Cadillac offered a sedan with removable &quot;B&quot; pillars.

Another form of early pillarless hardtop is the &quot;California top&quot;, originating in Los Angeles and most popular from 1917 to 1927. These were designed to replace the folding roofs of touring cars, to enclose the sides of the car for better weather protection. One objective of these aftermarket tops was to bring the cost of the closed car nearer to the prices of corresponding open cars. Automobile dealers were encouraged to equip an open car with a California top to demonstrate that they were &quot;cool and clean in summer, and warm and dry in winter.&quot; The hard tops were frequently equipped with celluloid windows that retracted like a roller blind for open sided motoring offering a low-cost compromise between an open and closed car.

===United States===
There were a variety of hardtop-like body styles dating back to 1916. Chrysler Corporation built seven pillarless Town and Country hardtop coupes as concept vehicles in 1946, and even included the body style in its advertising that year called the Town and Country Custom Club Coupe. In 1951, Plymouth offered the Cranbrook Belvedere as a low priced hardtop two-door until 1953.

Mass-production of hardtops began with General Motors, which launched two-door, pillarless hardtops in 1949 as the Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, and Cadillac Coupe de Ville. They were purportedly inspired by the wife of a Buick executive who always drove convertibles, but never lowered the top.

The Kaiser-Frazer 1949 Virginian was an early example of a four-door hardtop albeit with a removable thin, chrome- and-glass &#x27;B&#x27; pillar held on by five screws. The car was designed to have a convertible look and padded nylon or cotton was applied over the roof contributing to the soft-top appearance.

Two-door hardtops became popular with consumers in the 1950s, while the two-door sedan body design fell out of favor among buyers.

In 1955, General Motors introduced the first four-door hardtops. Following the pattern established by the two-door variants, GM utilized the same special sub-designations for the pillarless four-door body types within all their brands in North America. The term de Ville was used for Cadillac, Riviera was used for Buick, Holiday was used for Oldsmobile, Catalina was used for Pontiac, and Bel Air was used for Chevrolet.

Other manufacturers also designated unique names for their pillarless models. Ford called them Victoria, Chrysler used Newport, and their luxury division Imperial used the name Southampton, Packard named them Mayfair, and Hudson&#x27;s were Hollywoods. Nash used the Country Club moniker while pillarless Studebakers were Starliners, a name that was later used by Ford for its Galaxie hardtop.

By 1956, every major U.S. automaker offered two- and four-door hardtops in a particular model lineup. General Motors restyled their new models and offered four-door hardtops from every division and nearly every series except the lowest-priced lines. Chrysler also offered two- and four-door hardtops for every brand, from Imperial, Chrysler, DeSoto, Dodge, and Plymouth.

In 1956, the first four-door hardtop station wagons were introduced to the Rambler line by American Motors Corporation. The following year, the Mercury Commuter hardtop wagons became available in both two- and four-door body styles. Chrysler built four-door hardtop station wagons through 1964 in both the Chrysler and Dodge 880 lines.

Throughout the 1960s, the two-door pillarless hardtop was the most popular body style in most lines where such a model was offered. Even on family-type vehicles like the Chevrolet Impala, the two-door hardtop regularly outsold four-door sedans. Some car lines (such as the 1957-64 Cadillac and 1965–69 Corvair) only offered pillarless models with no pillared sedans. So prevalent were true hardtops that &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; had to describe that the new full-sized 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont models even included &quot;a &quot;pillar&quot; sedan&quot;.

The U.S. industry&#x27;s last pillarless two-door and four-door hardtops were in the 1978 Chrysler Newport and New Yorker lines. Since then, no U.S. manufacturer has offered a true hardtop in regular production.

===Europe===

Various European manufacturers have produced hardtops without B-pillars (usually coupes). However, they are rarely marketed as pillarless hardtops. Examples include the current Bentley Continental GT, the 2008 Bentley Brooklands, the 2001-2003 Renault Avantime, the Rolls-Royce Wraith, and the 2012-2017 Ford B-Max. The 1958-1964 Facel Vega Excellence is one of few four-door hardtops produced in Europe.

German pillarless hardtops included cars from Taunus, a Ford subbrand. Namely the Ford Taunus P5 and Ford P7 including both P7A and P7B versions. They had regular coupe versions with B pillars, but the Hardtop Taunus models had no B pillar and provided an open-air feel inside the car when all the windows were rolled down. DKW was the only German manufacturer that offered pillarless two-door windows, as well as wrap-around windows in the back of the glasshouse from 1953 (3=6 F91) on and with a wrap-around windscreen since 1959 (1000 Coupe).

British pillarless hardtops included the Sunbeam Rapier and the Ford Consul Capri (355) which, unlike American models, sold fewer cars than their regular center pillar saloon versions.

A New Mini two-door sedan has been marketed as a hardtop in the U.S. includes a structural B-pillar on the inside that is disguised on the exterior by a black border on the fixed rear windows.

The Mercedes E-class coupe W213 from 2016 is an example of a modern pillarless design.

===Japan===

In July 1965, Toyota introduced Japan&#x27;s first two-door hardtop in the third generation Toyota Corona line. This was followed by several manufacturers offering the popular body style as a luxury car appearance. During the 1970s, Toyota produced the Toyota Crown in a genuine two-door hardtop, while offering a pillared four-door hardtop sedan.

Nissan followed suit with the Nissan Cedric and Nissan Gloria but offered a genuine pillarless four-door hardtop along with a two-door hardtop body styles, with the latter &quot;rendered as a premium quality personal car.&quot; Subaru introduced a new compact coupe as a genuine two-door hardtop with the Subaru Leone in 1971. The pillarless hardtop models were more expensive and luxurious than the sedan versions.

In the 1980s, Toyota continued the design with a pillared four-door hardtop Mark II, while Nissan again offered a genuine hardtop sedan with its Laurel. Toyota introduced a genuine four-door hardtop with the Toyota Carina ED followed by the Toyota Corona EXiV. Mazda marketed its Luce and Subaru from 1989 until 2009 with their Legacy/Outback sedans and station wagons as a pillared hardtop.

== Detachable hardtops ==
A detachable hardtop is a rigid, removable roof panel that is often stored in a car&#x27;s trunk/boot.
== Retractable hardtops ==
A retractable hardtop (also known as coupé convertible or coupé cabriolet) is a type of convertible that forgoes a folding textile roof in favor of an automatically operated, multi-part, self-storing roof where the rigid roof sections are opaque, translucent, or independently operable.

<doc id="891521" wikidata="Q749409" url="?curid=891521" title="Osteogenesis imperfecta">
<text>Osteogenesis imperfecta (; OI), colloquially known as brittle bone disease, is a group of genetic disorders that all result in bones that break easily. The range of symptoms—on the skeleton as well as on the body&#x27;s other organs—may be mild to severe. Symptoms found in various types of OI include whites of the eye (sclerae) that are blue instead, short stature, loose joints, hearing loss, breathing problems and problems with the teeth (dentinogenesis imperfecta). Potentially life-threatening complications, all of which become more common in more severe OI, include: tearing (dissection) of the major arteries, such as the aorta; pulmonary valve insufficiency secondary to distortion of the ribcage; and basilar invagination.
The underlying mechanism is usually a problem with connective tissue due to a lack of, or poorly formed, type I collagen. In more than 90% of cases, OI occurs due to mutations in the &quot;COL1A1&quot; or &quot;COL1A2&quot; genes. These mutations may be hereditary in an autosomal dominant manner but may also occur spontaneously (&quot;de novo&quot;). There are four clinically defined types: type I, the least severe; type IV, moderately severe; type III, severe and progressively deforming; and type II, perinatally lethal. , 19 different genes are known to cause the 21 documented genetically defined types of OI, many of which are extremely rare and have only been documented in a few individuals. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and may be confirmed by collagen biopsy or DNA sequencing.
Although there is no cure, most cases of OI do not have a major effect on life expectancy, death during childhood from it is rare, and many adults with OI can achieve a significant degree of autonomy despite disability. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle by exercising, eating a balanced diet sufficient in vitamin D and calcium, and avoiding smoking can help prevent fractures. Genetic counseling may be sought by those with OI to prevent their children from inheriting the disorder from them. Treatment may include acute care of broken bones, pain medication, physical therapy, mobility aids such as leg braces and wheelchairs, vitamin D supplementation, and, especially in childhood, rodding surgery. Rodding is an implantation of metal intramedullary rods along the long bones (such as the femur) in an attempt to strengthen them. Medical research also supports the use of medications of the bisphosphonate class, such as pamidronate, to increase bone density. Bisphosphonates are especially effective in children; however, it is unclear if they either increase quality of life or decrease the rate of fracture incidence.
OI affects only about one in 15,000 to 20,000 people, making it a rare genetic disease. Outcomes depend on the genetic cause of the disorder (its type). Type I (the least severe) is the most common, with other types comprising a minority of cases. Moderate-to-severe OI primarily affects mobility; if rodding surgery is performed during childhood, some of those with more severe types of OI may gain the ability to walk. The condition has been described since ancient history. The Latinate term &quot;osteogenesis imperfecta&quot; was coined by Dutch anatomist Willem Vrolik in 1849; translated literally, it means &quot;imperfect bone formation&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==

=== Orthopedic ===

The main symptom of osteogenesis imperfecta is fragile, low mineral density bones; all types of OI have some bone involvement. In moderate and especially severe OI, the long bones may be bowed, sometimes extremely so. The weakness of the bones causes them to fracture easily—a study at the Endocrine Unit at the National Institute of Child Health in Karachi, Pakistan found an average of 5.8 fractures per year in untreated children. Fractures typically occur much less after puberty, but begin to increase again in women after menopause and in men between the ages of 60 and 80.

Joint hypermobility is also a common sign of OI, thought to be because the affected genes are the same as those that cause some types of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. 

=== Otologic ===
By the age of 50, about 50% of adults with OI experience significant hearing loss, much earlier as compared to the general population. Hearing loss in OI may or may not be associated with visible deformities of the ossicles and inner ear. Hearing loss frequently begins during the second, third, and fourth decades of life, and may be conductive, sensorineural, or a combination of both (&quot;mixed&quot;). If hearing loss does not occur by age 50, it is significantly less likely to occur in the years afterwards. Mixed hearing loss is most common among those with OI of all age groups, while conductive hearing loss is most likely to affect older people, with sensorineural hearing loss most likely to affect children.

Although relatively rare, OI-related hearing loss can also begin in childhood; in a study of forty-five children aged four to sixteen, two were found to be affected, aged 11 and 15. In a different 2008 study, the hearing of 41 people with OI was checked. The results showed that 88% of those over 20 years of age had some form of hearing loss, while only 38% of those under 20 did.

Hearing loss is most common in type I OI; it is less common in types III and IV. Other parts of the inner ear may also be affected by OI. causing balance issues; however, only small studies have found links between vertigo and OI. OI may worsen the outcome of medical treatments which correct hearing loss.

Besides OI&#x27;s association with sensorineural hearing loss, OI is associated with a number of neurological abnormalities, usually involving the central nervous system, due to deformities in the skeletal structures surrounding it. Neurological complications, especially basilar invagination, may adversely affect life expectancy. In OI, this is most often due to upwards migration of the dens, a feature of the C2 vertebra. Neurosurgery may be needed to correct severe abnormalities when they risk the patient&#x27;s life or cause either great suffering or intolerable neurological deficits.

=== Systemic ===
As its biological causes have been more precisely determined, it has become more widely recognized that while the primary disease process of OI happens in the bones, the most common types of OI—those caused by type I collagen gene mutations—affect virtually all of the human body&#x27;s organs in some way.

Type I collagen is present throughout the circulatory and respiratory systems: from the ventricles of the heart itself, to the heart valves, to the vasculature, it is an integral part of the connective tissue of the lungs. As such, cardiovascular complications, among them aortic insufficiency, aortic aneurysm, and arterial dissections, are sometimes comorbid with OI, but not as frequently as they are comorbid with Marfan syndrome.

Respiratory illnesses are a major cause of death in OI. The most obvious source of respiratory problems in OI is pulmonary insufficiency caused by problems in the architecture of the thoracic wall. However, respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia, are also more fatal among those with OI than the general population. Those with more severe ribcage deformities were found to have worse lung restriction in a small-scale 2012 study involving 22 Italian patients with OI types III and IV, plus 26 non-affected controls.

OI—especially its severe form type III—also has effects on the gastrointestinal system. It was found to be associated with recurrent abdominal pain and chronic constipation in two studies on patients affected by OI. Chronic constipation is especially common, and is thought to be aggravated by an asymmetric pelvis (acetabular protrusion). Especially in childhood, OI-associated constipation may cause a feeling of fullness and associated food refusal, leading to malnutrition.

== Classification ==
There are two typing systems for OI in modern use. The first, created by David Sillence in 1979, classifies patients into four types, or syndromes, according to their clinical presentation, without taking into account the genetic cause of their disease. The second system expands on the Sillence model, but assigns new numbered types genetically as they are found. Therefore, people with OI can be described as having both a &quot;clinical&quot; type and a &quot;genetic&quot; type, which may or may not be equivalent.

Type I is the most common, and 90% of cases result from mutations to either &quot;COL1A1&quot; or &quot;COL1A2&quot;. Symptoms vary widely between types, as well as vary from person to person, even in the same family.

As of 2021, 21 types of OI have been defined:

=== Sillence types ===
Sillence&#x27;s four types have both a clinical and a genetic meaning; the descriptions below are clinical and can be applied to several genetic types of OI. When used to refer to a genetic as well as a clinical type, it indicates that the clinical symptoms are indeed caused by mutations in the &quot;COL1A1&quot; or &quot;COL1A2&quot; genes which are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.

==== Type ====
Collagen is of normal quality but is produced in insufficient quantities. Bones fracture more easily than in the general public, but not as easily as more severe types of OI; there might be scoliosis, albeit mild compared to OI types III and IV, with a lower Cobb angle; the joints may be loose; blue sclerae may be apparent; hearing loss is likely to occur; and there might be a slight decrease in height. Because cases exist missing one or more of these symptoms, OI type I in some cases goes undetected into adulthood.

Some further split type I into types I–A and I–B, defined as being distinguished by the absence (I–A) or presence (I–B) of dentinogenesis imperfecta (opalescent teeth). People with type I generally have a normal lifespan.

==== Type ====
Collagen is fatally defective at its C-terminus. Most cases result in death shortly after birth, or within the first year of life, due to respiratory failure. Another common cause of death is intracranial bleeds from skull fractures present at, or sustained during or shortly after, birth. In many cases, the newborn already has multiple broken bones at the time of birth. Type II infants also exhibit severe respiratory problems, and have severely deformed bones. Sixty percent of infants die less than 24 hours after being born, and survival after the first year is extremely unlikely and normally requires mechanical ventilation. In the rare cases of infants who survive their first year of life, severe developmental and motor delays are seen; neither of two infants studied in 2019, both aged around two years, had achieved head control, and both required a ventilator to breathe.

Type II is also known as the &quot;lethal perinatal&quot; form of OI, and is not compatible with survival into adulthood. Due to similarly severely deformed bones, sometimes infants with severe type III are wrongly initially classified as type II; once long-term survival is shown, they are considered as having type III instead.

==== Type ====
Collagen quantity is sufficient, but is not of a high enough quality. Clinical differentiation between types III and IV is not always simple, and is further confounded by the fact that an untreated adult with type IV may have worse symptoms than a treated adult with type III; features only found in type III are its progressively deforming nature and the presence of a face with a &quot;triangular&quot; appearance. Another differentiating factor between type III and IV is blue sclerae; in type III, infants commonly have blue sclerae that gradually turn white with age, but blue sclerae are not commonly seen in type IV, although they are seen in 10% of cases.

OI type III causes osteopenic bones that fracture very easily, sometimes even &quot;in utero&quot;, often leading to hundreds of fractures during a lifetime; early scoliosis that progresses until puberty; dwarfism (a final adult height frequently less than ); loose joints; and possible respiratory problems due to low rib cage volume causing low lung volumes.

Due to the severity of the issues with the bones, neurological and seizure disorders are more likely to develop in type III. Basilar invagination, which puts pressure on the brainstem, may cause or contribute to early death; surgical treatment of it is more complex in OI cases.

==== Type ====
Collagen quantity is sufficient, but is not of a high enough quality. Type IV is for cases of variable severity, which do not fit into either types III or I. While one of Sillence&#x27;s required characteristics for type IV was having normal sclerae, modern classification allows even those with blue sclerae to fit the criteria for type IV if they meet the other clinical requirements of the type.

In type IV, bone deformity can be mild to severe, bones fracture easily (especially before puberty), dwarfism is common, vertebral collapse and scoliosis are evident, and hearing loss is possible, although uncommon. Type IV OI is mostly defined in contrast to type III and type I, being the clinical classification for patients somewhere in the middle ground between the two. As such, type IV OI is often termed &quot;variable&quot; OI, with the severity of even those in the same family (so, with the same genetic mutation) differing.

Prepubertal bone fracture rates are another way of clinically assessing type IV OI—those with it tend to have fracture rates of ≈1 per year, compared to ≈3 per year for severe OI (type III).

As in type I, some further split type IV into types IV–A and IV–B, defined again by the absence (IV–A) or presence (IV–B) of dentinogenesis imperfecta.

=== Genetically defined types (types –) ===
As of 2020, fifteen types of OI are defined genetically:

* Type – Having the same clinical features as type IV, it can be clinically distinguished by observing a &quot;mesh-like&quot; appearance to a bone biopsy under a microscope. Type V can be further distinguished from other types of OI by the &quot;V triad&quot;: an opaque band (visible on X-ray) adjacent to the growth plates; hypertrophic calluses (abnormally large masses of bony repair tissue) which form at fracture sites during the healing process; and calcification of the interosseous membrane of the forearm, which may make it difficult to turn the wrist. Other features of this condition may include pulled elbow, and, as in other types of OI, long bone bowing and hearing loss. Cases of this type are caused by mutations in the &quot;IFITM5&quot; gene on chromosome 11p15.5. The separation of type V from type IV OI, its clinical type, was initially suggested even before its genetic cause was known, by Glorieux &quot;et al&quot;. in 2000. Type V is relatively common compared to other genetically defined types of OI—4% of OI patients at the genetics department of the Brazilian Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre were found to have it.
* Type – With the same clinical features as type III, it is distinguished by bones which have an appearance similar to that seen in osteomalacia. Type VI is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the &quot;SERPINF1&quot; gene on chromosome 17p13.3.
* Type – OI caused by a mutation in the gene &quot;CRTAP&quot; on chromosome 3p22.3; clinically similar to OI types II and III, depending on affected individual. Type VII was the first recessive OI type confirmed, initially found among First Nations people in Quebec.
* Type – OI caused by a mutation in the gene &quot;LEPRE1&quot; on chromosome 1p34.2; clinically similar to OI types II and III, depending on affected individual.
* Type – OI caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the &quot;PPIB&quot; gene on chromosome 15q22.31.
* Type – OI caused by homozygous mutation in the &quot;SERPINH1&quot; gene on chromosome 11q13.
* Type – OI caused by mutations in &quot;FKBP10&quot; on chromosome 17q21. The mutations cause a decrease in secretion of trimeric procollagen molecules. Other mutations in this gene can cause autosomal recessive Bruck syndrome, which is similar to OI.
* Type – OI caused by a frameshift mutation in &quot;SP7&quot; on chromosome 12q13.13. This mutation causes bone deformities, fractures, and delayed tooth eruption.
* Type – OI caused by a mutation in the bone morphogenetic protein 1 (&quot;BMP1&quot;) gene on chromosome 8p21.3. This mutation causes recurrent fractures, high bone mass, and hypermobile joints.
* Type – OI caused by mutations in the &quot;TMEM38B&quot; gene on chromosome 9q31.2. This mutation causes recurrent fractures and osteopenia, although the disease trajectory is highly variable.
* Type – OI caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the &quot;WNT1&quot; gene on chromosome 12q13.12. It is autosomal recessive.
* Type – OI caused by mutations in the &quot;CREB3L1&quot; gene on chromosome 11p11.2. The homozygous mutation causes prenatal onset of recurrent fractures of the ribs and long bones, demineralization, decreased ossification of the skull, and blue sclerae; it is clinically type II or type III. Family members who are heterozygous for OI XVI may have recurrent fractures, osteopenia and blue sclerae.
* Type – OI caused by homozygous mutation in the &quot;SPARC&quot; gene on chromosome 5q33, causing a defect in the protein osteonectin, which leads to severe disease characterized by generalized platyspondyly, dependence on a wheelchair, and recurrent fractures.
* Type – OI caused by homozygous mutation in the &quot;FAM46A&quot; gene on chromosome 6q14.1. Characterized by congenital bowing of the long bones, Wormian bones, blue sclerae, vertebral collapse, and multiple fractures in the first years of life.
*Type – OI caused by hemizygous mutation in the &quot;MBTPS2&quot; gene on chromosome Xp22.12. Thus far, OI type XIX is the only known type of OI with an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance, making it the only type that is more common in males than females. OI type XIX disrupts regulated intramembrane proteolysis, which is critical for healthy bone formation.
*Type – OI caused by homozygous mutation in the &quot;MESD&quot; gene on chromosome 15q25.1. Initial studies of type XX indicate that it may cause global developmental delay, a first among OI types. OI type XX disrupts the Wnt signaling pathway, which is thought to have a role in bone development.
*Type – OI caused by homozygous mutation in the &quot;KDELR2&quot; gene on chromosome 7p22.1. Causes disease clinically similar to types II and III, thought to be related to inability of chaperone protein HP47 to unbind from collagen type I, as to do so it needs to bind to the missing ER lumen protein retaining receptor 2 protein encoded by &quot;KDELR2&quot;.

Given the rapid rate of type discovery, it is extremely likely that there are other genes associated with OI that have yet to be reported.

== Genetics ==

Osteogenesis imperfecta is a group of genetic disorders, all of which cause bone fragility. OI has high genetic heterogeneity, that is, many different genetic mutations lead to the same or similar sets of observable symptoms (phenotypes).

The main causes for developing the disorder are a result of mutations in the &quot;COL1A1&quot; and/or &quot;COL1A2&quot; genes which are jointly responsible for the production of collagen type I. Approximately 90% of people with OI are heterozygous for mutations in either the &quot;COL1A1&quot; or &quot;COL1A2&quot; genes. There are several biological factors that are results of the dominant form of OI. These factors include: intracellular stress; abnormal tissue mineralization; abnormal cell to cell interactions; abnormal cell-matrix interactions; a compromised cell matrix structure; and, abnormal interaction between non-collagenous proteins and collagen.

Previous research led to the belief that OI was an autosomal dominant disorder with few other variations in genomes. However, with the lowering of the cost of DNA sequencing in the wake of 2003&#x27;s Human Genome Project, autosomal recessive forms of the disorder have been identified. Recessive forms of OI relate heavily to defects in the collagen chaperones responsible for production of procollagen and the assembly of the related proteins. Examples of collagen chaperones that are defective in patients with recessive forms of OI include chaperone HSP47 (Cole-Carpenter syndrome) and FKBP65. Mutations in these chaperones result in an improper folding pattern in the collagen 1 proteins which causes the recessive form of the disorder. There are three significant types of OI that are a result of mutations in the collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex (components CRTAP, P3H1, and CyPB). These components are responsible for the modification of collagen α1(l)Pro986. Mutations in other genes such as &quot;SP7&quot;, &quot;SERPINF1&quot;, &quot;TMEM38B&quot; and &quot;BMP1&quot; can also lead to irregularly formed proteins and enzymes that result in other recessive types of osteogenesis imperfecta.

Defects in the proteins pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and bone-restricted interferon-induced transmembrane protein (BRIL) are the causes of type V and VI osteogenesis imperfecta. Defects in these proteins lead to defective bone mineralization which causes the characteristic brittle bones of osteogenesis imperfecta. A single point mutation in the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of the &quot;IFITM5&quot; gene, which encodes BRIL, is linked directly to OI type V.

In the rare case of type XIX, first discovered in 2016, OI is inherited as an X-linked genetic disorder, with its detrimental effects resulting ultimately from a mutation in the gene &quot;MBTPS2.&quot; Genetic research is ongoing, and it is uncertain when all the genetic causes of OI will be identified, as the number of genes that need to be tested to rule out the disorder continue to increase.

In a study of 37 families, a 1.3% chance was found that OI recurs in multiple siblings born to two unaffected parents—this is a much higher rate than would be expected if all such recurrences were &quot;de novo&quot;. The cause is genetic mosaicism; that is, some of, or most of, the germ cells of one parent have a dominant form of OI, but not enough of their somatic cells do to cause symptoms or obvious disability in the parent—the parent&#x27;s different cells have two (or more) sets of slightly different DNA. It has been clinically observed that ≈5–10% of cases of OI types II and III are attributable to genetic mosaicism.

==Pathophysiology==
People with OI are either born with defective connective tissue, born without the ability to make it in sufficient quantities, or, in the rarest genetic types, born with deficiencies in other aspects of bone formation such as chaperone proteins, the Wnt signaling pathway, the BRIL protein, et cetera. In type I the collagen&#x27;s structure itself is normal, it is just its quantity that is low. Types II, III and IV are usually, but not always, related to a deficiency of type I collagen. One possible deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to a bulkier amino acid, such as alanine, in the collagen protein&#x27;s triple helix structure. The larger amino acid side-chains lead to steric effects that creates a bulge in the collagen complex, which in turn influences both the molecular nanomechanics and the interaction between molecules, which are both compromised. Depending on both the location of the substitution and the amino acid being used instead, different effects are seen which account for the type diversity in OI despite the same two collagen genes being responsible for most cases. Replacements of glycine with serine or cysteine are seen less often in fatal type II OI, while replacements with valine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or arginine are seen more often.

At a larger scale, the relationship between the collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals to form bone is altered, causing brittleness. Bone fractures occur because the stress state within collagen fibrils is altered at the locations of mutations, where locally larger shear forces lead to rapid failure of fibrils even at moderate loads because the stress state normally found in healthy collagen fibrils is lost. OI is therefore a multi-scale phenomenon, where defects at the smallest levels of tissues (genetic, nano, micro) domino to affect the macro level of tissues.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is typically based on medical imaging, including plain X-rays, and symptoms. In severe OI, signs on medical imaging include abnormalities in all extremities and in the spine. As X-rays are often insensitive to the comparatively smaller bone density loss associated with type I OI, DEXA scans may be needed.

An OI diagnosis can be confirmed through DNA or collagen protein analysis, but in many cases, the occurrence of bone fractures with little trauma and the presence of other clinical features such as blue sclerae are sufficient for a diagnosis. A skin biopsy can be performed to determine the structure and quantity of type I collagen. While DNA testing can confirm the diagnosis, it cannot absolutely exclude it because not all mutations causing OI are yet known and/or tested for. OI type II is often diagnosed by ultrasound during pregnancy, where already multiple fractures and other characteristic features may be visible. Relative to control, OI cortical bone shows increased porosity, canal diameter, and connectivity in micro-computed tomography. OI can also be detected before birth by using an &quot;in vitro&quot; genetic testing technique such as amniocentresis.

=== Genetic testing ===
In order to determine whether osteogenesis imperfecta is present, genetic sequencing of the most common problematic genes, &quot;COL1A1&quot;, &quot;COL1A2&quot;, and &quot;IFITM5&quot;, may be done; if no mutation is found yet OI is still suspected, the other 10+ genes known to cause OI may be tested. Duplication and deletion testing is also suggested to parents who suspect their child has OI. The presence of frameshift mutations caused by duplications and deletions is generally the cause of increased severity of disease.

===Differential diagnosis===
An important differential diagnosis of OI is child abuse, as both may present to a clinician with multiple fractures in various stages of healing. Differentiating them can be difficult, especially when no other characteristic features of OI are present. This can become an issue in court; in the United States, several child abuse cases were resolved with a finding that osteogenesis imperfecta was the true cause of a child&#x27;s fractures, leading to lawsuits seeking redress such as &quot;Alice Velasquez, et al. v. United States&quot;.

Other differential diagnoses include rickets and osteomalacia, both caused by malnutrition, as well as rare skeletal syndromes such as Bruck syndrome, hypophosphatasia, geroderma osteodysplasticum, and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. Various forms of osteoporosis, such as iatrogenic osteoporosis, idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, disuse osteoporosis and exercise-related osteoporosis should also be considered as explanations when OI is suspected.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle by exercising and avoiding smoking can help prevent fractures. Treatment may include care of broken bones, pain medication, physical therapy, mobility aids such as braces or wheelchairs, and surgery.

Judging the success or failure of treatment can be difficult in OI patients, as decreased bone fracture rates may just be coincidental. While these rates are often used in medical studies to judge treatment efficacy, a Norwegian study of fifteen people with OI emphasized that they feel doctors should consider the whole patient and not just fracture rates.

=== Acute bone fracture care ===
Bone fractures are treated in individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta in much the same way as they are treated in the general population—OI bone heals at the same rate as non-OI bone. A greater emphasis is placed on using lightweight materials to immobilize the fracture, as in moderate or severe types of OI, using heavy casts, such as hip spica casts, can cause fractures at the bones at the boundaries of the cast, as well as generalized osteopenia. The lightweight cast or splint is then replaced with a removable orthosis after a few weeks and once evidence of union is seen on X-ray. In order to prevent a nonunion or malunion, all fractures should be immobilized, even if the fracture seems trivial (microfracture), as people with OI are at greater risk of nonunion.

Bone infections secondary to fractures are treated as and when they occur with the appropriate antibiotics and antiseptics, as in the general population.

=== Medications ===

====Bisphosphonates====

In 1998, an initial observational trial demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous pamidronate, a bisphosphonate which had previously been used in adults to treat osteoporosis. In severe OI, this trial showed that pamidronate reduced bone pain, prevented new vertebral fractures, reshaped previously fractured vertebral bodies, and reduced the number of long-bone fractures.

Although oral bisphosphonates are more convenient and cheaper, they are not absorbed as well, and intravenous bisphosphonates are generally more effective, although this is under study. Some studies have found oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as oral alendronate and intravenous pamidronate, equivalent. In a 2013 double-blind trial of children with mild OI, oral risedronate increased bone mineral densities, and reduced nonvertebral fractures. However, it did not decrease new vertebral fractures. A &quot;Cochrane&quot; review in 2016 concluded that though bisphosphonates seem to improve bone mineral density, it is uncertain whether this leads either to a reduction in bone fractures or improvement in the quality of life of individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. Even in trials with as many as 125 children, no causal link has been found between bisphosphonates and decreased fracture rates; placebo controlled trials were also unable to prove that they brought about increased strength, motor control or lower pain levels.

Bisphosphonates are not as effective at increasing the bone mineral density of adults.

==== Nutritional supplements ====
OI is a genetic disorder and is not caused by insufficient intake of any vitamin or mineral; supplementation cannot cure OI. Nevertheless, people with OI tend to be severely deficient in vitamin D at much higher rates than the general population, and the cause of this is not well understood. The severity of the deficiency and the likelihood of its occurrence is thought to be related to severity of OI. Vitamin D supplementation may be recommended, at least until levels of 25(OH)D3 in a patient&#x27;s blood return to normal. Vitamin D deficiency is also a concern as it may decrease the benefit of bisphosphanates.

===Surgery===
A surgery of any type inherently carries more risks when done on a patient who has (especially moderate to severe) OI. Skeletal deformities and dentinogenesis imperfecta may hinder access to the airway. Use of, and weaning off of, mechanical ventilation is also more challenging to carry out on patients with OI. During the procedure itself or the healing process, defective OI collagen may lead to bleeding diatheses.

The safety of anesthesia is also of more concern among patients with OI, with anesthetic complications 5.6x more likely to occur when the patient has OI type III. A unique concern of anesthesia in OI is perioperative fracture—fractures sustained due to patient transfer and airway access techniques that, while routine when a patient&#x27;s bones are strong, may cause injury with brittle OI bones. As an example, due to a 1972 report of a humerus fracture from a sphygmomanometer cuff sustained in an OI patient during surgery, blood pressure monitoring protocols are often modified for patients with OI, with neonatal size cuffs and machine settings being used even in adults; further, the least deformed of the patient&#x27;s limbs is preferred to receive the cuff.

==== Rodding ====

Metal rods can be surgically inserted in the long bones to improve strength, a procedure developed by Harold A. Sofield when he was Chief of Staff at Chicago&#x27;s Shriners Hospitals for Children, a hospital that offers orthopedic care and surgery to children regardless of their family&#x27;s ability to pay. Large numbers of children with OI came to Shriners, and Sofield experimented with various methods to strengthen their bones. In 1959, with Edward A. , Sofield wrote a seminal article describing a three-part surgery that seemed radical at the time: precisely breaking the bones (&quot;fragmentation&quot;), putting the resulting bone fragments in a straight line (&quot;realignment&quot;), then placing metal rods into the intramedullary canals of the long bones to stabilize and strengthen them (&quot;rod fixation&quot;). His treatment proved useful for increasing the mobility of people with OI, and it has been adopted throughout the world—it became standard surgical treatment for severe OI by 1979, in which year David Sillence found that ≈ of the patients he surveyed with OI type III had undergone at least one rodding surgery.

Rodding surgery is often done with the hope that it will offer a path to ambulation, walking, to patients with moderate or severe OI. A 2020 review in &quot;The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery&quot; (&quot;JB&amp;JS&quot;) found it remains broadly popular: ≈ of people with OI types III and IV (severe OI) have undergone some form of rodding surgery in their lives, at a mean age of and years respectively; one possible explanation for a tendency towards earlier intervention in type III is that one half of affected children could not walk at all without the surgery, as their limbs were more bowed, so surgery was sought sooner.

In those with type III OI who had undergone rodding surgery, 79.5% had the femurs and tibias of both legs rodded. The most common form of rods used are intramedullary (IM) rods, some of which, such as the Fassier–Duval IM rod, are telescoping, meaning that they are designed to grow as the child grows, in an attempt to avoid the necessity of revision surgeries. Telescoping IM rods are widely used, and the common Fassier–Duval IM rod is designed to be used to rod the femur, tibia, and humerus. The surgery involves breaking the long bones in between one and three (or more) places, then fixing the rod alongside the bone to keep it straight.

While telescoping IM rods are intended to grow along with both the femur and tibia in developing children; surgeons have a preference to use non-telescoping IM rods, such as Rush rods, in the tibia, which grows less comparatively—the &quot;JB&amp;JS&quot; review found that while 69.7% of femurs were treated with telescoping IM rods, only 36.9% of tibiae were.

While the review in the &quot;JB&amp;JS&quot; was able to correlate receiving rodding surgery with greater mobility across all types of OI, in patients with type IV, the surgery did not decrease the incidence of broken bones as compared to non-rodded patients—while type IV patients with rodded tibiae experienced 0.93 tibia fractures per year, patients with natural tibiae experienced only 0.81. However, in patients with type III, rodding surgery decreased the average number of tibia fractures per year from 0.84 to 0.57.

==== Spinal ====
Spinal fusion can be performed either as a preventative measure or to correct existing scoliosis, although the inherent fragility of OI bone makes this operation more complex in OI patients than it does with patients who have adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, but normal bone density. Despite the risks, however, three Nemours–duPont orthopedic surgeons who specialize in surgical intervention for osteogenesis imperfecta recommend operating if the curve is greater than 50° after a child is past peak height velocity, as the spine&#x27;s curve can continue to worsen even into adulthood.

Due to the risk involved, the same surgeons recommend that surgery for basilar impressions and basilar invaginations should only be carried out if the pressure being exerted on the spinal cord and brain stem is causing actual neurological symptoms. Once basilar invagination has become symptomatic, only surgery can halt or reverse the progression of neurological deficits.

===Physical therapy===
Physical therapy is generally recommended, however individualized protocols are required due to the variability of OI. Physical therapy is used to strengthen muscles, improve motility, improve flexibility, and help with weight maintenance, although it must be done in a gentle manner to minimize the risk of bone fracture. In people with OI, exercise often involves water aerobics, light resistance exercises, and walking, if the patient is able. However, even in patients with mild OI, contact sports, as well as activities likely to put unnecessary stress on the joints, such as jumping, are contraindicated due to the risks they pose.

Individuals with more limited mobility are encouraged to change positions regularly throughout the day; people who sit in a wheelchair most or all of the day are recommended to get out of it every two hours, as a form of exercise, to decrease stiffness, and to prevent pressure ulcers.

Individuals with moderate to severe OI, who require assistive mobility devices and adapted vehicles, face significant barriers to access wheelchair-accessible pools or gyms—they either may not have any in their area, nor the means to get there. Obesity may be more likely to present among those with severe OI, (especially after the age of 20,) and can, in some, cause further declines in mobility.

Tilt table whole body vibration may also be done to increase the mobility of long-term immobilized (bedridden) patients with OI; in at least two cases it helped bedridden children to be able to sit upright.

=== Teeth ===

More than 1 in 2 people with OI also have dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI)—a congenital abnormality in the formation of dentin, one of the four major components of the human tooth. Dental treatment may pose as a challenge as a result of the various deformities, skeletal and dental, due to OI. Children with OI should go for a dental check-up as soon as their teeth erupt; this may minimize tooth structure loss as a result of abnormal dentine, and they should be monitored regularly to preserve their teeth and oral health.

Many people with OI are treated with bisphosphonates, and there are several possible related complications with dental procedures, for example, medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). However, no report of bisphosphonate-related MRONJ in either a child or adult with OI was found in a 2016 &quot;Cochrane&quot; review of the safety and efficacy of bisphosphonates for OI.

=== In development ===

==== Monoclonal antibodies ====
Monoclonal antibodies have long been considered for OI, but as of 2021, such therapy has not been approved for OI, neither in the European Union nor in the United States. Thus, it is unclear whether they are safe or effective. Among the monoclonal antibodies that have been studied are romosozumab (targets sclerostin, by Amgen), fresolimumab (TGF-β, Sanofi), blosozumab (sclerostin, Lilly), and setrusumab (sclerostin, begun by Novartis).

Setrusumab, formerly known as BPS-804, is a monoclonal antibody that targets sclerostin, and has been studied in OI specifically more than any of the others. In the body, sclerostin binds to the LRP5 and LRP6 receptors, resulting in inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway. This decreases bone formation, and is not a problem when a person has healthy bones. It is thought, though, that decreasing the concentration of sclerostin in the body may lead to the formation of more bone, and that is the premise as to why monoclonal antibodies that reduce the concentrations of naturally occurring sclerostin may help strengthen OI bone. While setrusumab was first developed at the pharmaceutical company Novartis, Novartis sold its rights to patent the drug to Mereo Biopharma in 2015, who has continued its development in conjunction with Ultragenyx. In 2019, Mereo announced that it had concluded collecting data for its phase II-B trial of setrusumab; the study was completed on 12 November 2020. Despite the trial data failing to show improvements in bone density on QCT scans, its primary goal, there were improvements on DXA scans. In a September 2020 press release, Mereo said it was seeking to do a phase III trial in 2021, and had received a Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Romosozumab, which also is a monoclonal antibody targeting sclerostin, is an approved drug in the US and EU for the treatment of osteoporosis. The pharmaceutical industry analyst Evercore has remarked that &quot;it could wipe out setrusumab&#x27;s economics&quot;, as romosozumab is priced more cheaply than a drug for a rare disease would be, claiming that it will be &quot;vital&quot; to Ultragenyx&#x27;s profit margins to prove its setrusumab is more efficacious than romosozumab for OI. A clinical trial evaluating romosozumab&#x27;s efficacy in OI began in September 2020 and as of September 2021 is ongoing. Ultragenyx predicts that its phase 2/3 trials for setrusumab will be completed in 2026.

== Prevention ==
As a genetic disorder, the mainstay of twenty-first century prevention of osteogenesis imperfecta is based on preventing affected individuals from being born in the first place. Genetic counseling can help patients and their families determine what types of screening, if any, are right for their situation. Patients can consider preimplantation genetic diagnosis after in vitro fertilization to select fertilized embryos which are not affected. Common mutations which cause OI may be caught by exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing. If a pregnancy is already in progress, the procedure of amniocentesis may be undergone to see if the fetus is affected. If affected, it is up to the family to consider whether or not they want to terminate the pregnancy and try again—raising questions of medical ethics and a woman&#x27;s right to choose.

Without intervention, patients with the most common mutations causing osteogenesis imperfecta have a 50% chance per gestation of passing on the disorder, as these mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern of Mendelian inheritance. Those with the rare autosomal recessive forms of OI have a 25% chance of passing on the disorder. Genetic testing of the affected members of the family can be used to determine which inheritance pattern applies.

As OI type I may be difficult to detect in a newborn child, the cord blood of the child can be tested to determine if it has been passed on if the family has already rejected the more invasive genetic screening methods. In more severe cases, the diagnosis may be able to be done via ultrasound, especially if OI is already a possibility. An ethical concern with prenatal screening for OI often arises when parents inquire as to how severely affected their child will be—such questions are as yet difficult to answer conclusively.

If a non-affected person has already had a child with OI, there is a greater likelihood (although still quite remote), that their future children will have OI due to genetic mosaicism.

The disability rights critique of prenatal screening for OI, held by some bioethicists and some affected individuals, negatively compares it to eugenics, with even those not opposed to abortion opposing selective abortions on the ethical ground that their existence betrays the belief that the lives of those with OI are &quot;less worth living [and] less valuable&quot;.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis of osteogenesis imperfecta depends entirely on its type (see ).

=== Life expectancy ===
In the mild form of the disorder, type I, the life expectancy of patients is near that of the general population. In type II, however, patients only very rarely live past the age of two, and typically die in their first weeks of life. Assessment of the life expectancy of patients with types III and IV is more complicated, as lifestyle choices can cause fatally traumatic injuries that would not have otherwise occurred, or not been fatal in the general population. Life expectancy in type IV OI is thought to be close to normal, but in type III it is lower than in the general population.

A 2016 study of data in Denmark&#x27;s found that across all types of OI, all-cause mortality was three times higher, leading to a loss of around seven years in females and nine years in males. A 1996 study published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; found that mortality in type III OI is significantly higher, with many patients dying in their 20&#x27;s, 30&#x27;s, and 40&#x27;s; patients who survive to the age of 10 were further found to have longer life expectancy than newborns.

===Mobility===
People with mild (type I) OI as adults need few pieces of adaptive equipment, although in infancy they reach motor milestones at a significant delay compared to the general population.

With adaptive equipment such as crutches, motorized wheelchairs, splints, reach extenders, and/or modifications to the home, many individuals with moderate to severe OI can achieve or maintain a significant degree of independence. With treatment and physical therapy, the maximum levels of mobility are expected to be unassisted community walking for type I, household or exercise walking for type III, and household or community walking for type IV; due to the variability of OI between individuals, mobility achieved varies and may be below this expected maximum.

==Epidemiology==
In the United States, the incidence of osteogenesis imperfecta is estimated to be one per 20,000 live births. An estimated 20,000 to 50,000 people are affected by OI in the United States.

The most common types are I, II, III, and IV, while the rest are very rare. Type I is the most common and has been reported to be around three times more common than type II. The prevalence of types III and IV is less certain. In a 1989 study in Denmark, type I was found to comprise 71% of cases and type II 12% of cases, with other types comprising the other 17%. In a 2015 study in Sweden, type I was nearly six times more common than type III and nearly four times more common than type IV.

Most people with OI receive it from a parent, but in many cases, it is a brand new (&quot;de novo&quot; or &quot;sporadic&quot;) mutation in a family. Among a study of patients with survivable types of OI, OI type III is most often &quot;de novo&quot; (85%), followed by type IV (50%) and type I (34%).

Some populations can have a higher incidence of OI than would be otherwise expected if they have a larger than average number of carriers of the recessive forms of the disease.

==History==

The condition, or types of it, has had various other names over the years and in different nations; &quot; &quot; has, however, been the most widely accepted name for the condition since the late 20th century. Among some of the most common alternatives are &quot; &quot;; &quot;Ekman–Lobstein syndrome&quot;, and &quot;Vrolik syndrome&quot;, both eponyms; and, the colloquialism, &quot;brittle bone disease&quot;.

=== Earliest recorded cases ===
OI has been identified in an ancient Egyptian infant mummified in around 1000 BC, originally dismissed by archaeologists as containing the remains of a monkey. The Norse king Ivar the Boneless, who lived , is speculated to have had OI as well.

Nicolas de Malebranche is often credited as being the first person to describe the physical characteristics of OI in his 1688 book , in which he describes a man who has had his &quot;bones broken in the places a murderer&#x27;s would be&quot; all his life. His confident description of the pathology of the disorder, however, which creates what he termed «» (&quot;monstrous children&quot;), is scientifically void—he wrote that it was due to the mother&#x27;s antepartum viewership of a public execution by breaking wheel.

The earliest modern scientific studies of OI began in 1788 by Olof Jakob Ekman, who described the condition, which he termed &quot;osteomalacia congenital&quot;, in his doctoral thesis and mentioned cases of it going back to 1678, all in the same family, through three generations. Ekman&#x27;s description of the condition mentioned dwarfism, bone fragility, and bowing of the long bones. In 1831, Edmund Axmann gave a detailed description of it in himself and his two brothers, being the first to mention blue sclerae as a characteristic sign of OI. Jean Lobstein first described the mild form of the condition, today known as type I, in 1833, calling it &quot;osteopsathyrosis idiopathica&quot;.

It was not until 1912 that hearing loss was positively recognized as a symptom of OI, first mentioned in a brief paper by the English physician Charles Allen Adair-Dighton.

=== Of the term ===

Willem Vrolik, a Dutch anatomist who was also curator of the &quot;Museum Vrolikianum&quot;, which made him privy to many specimens of bodies having birth defects, coined the term &quot;osteogenesis imperfecta&quot; in his bilingual Latin and Dutch language book on teratology, &quot;Illustrations of Human and Mammalian Embryogenesis&quot;, first published in 1849.

Included is a description of the remains of an infant who had what is now known as perinatally fatal OI type II (as verified in a 1998 re-examination of the remains by Baljet &quot;et al.&quot;). The remains were first given to Vrolik&#x27;s father, who could not make sense of them. Vrolik described poorly mineralized bones, bowed long bones, and fractures in various states of healing. Vrolik correctly determined that what he termed OI in the infant was not caused by secondary rickets, but a congenital abnormality causing primary osteopenia; he theorized this was due to a lack of &quot;intrinsic generative energy&quot;.

=== Of its classification ===
Classification of OI has also evolved as scientific understanding of it has improved. Before the advent of modern genetic testing, OI was classified in two broad groups: &quot;osteogenesis imperfecta congenita&quot;, and &quot;osteogenesis imperfecta &quot;, a division first proposed by the German physician E. Looser in 1906. &quot;Congenita&quot; was used to describe the modern clinical types II, III, and some cases of IV, where upon birth the condition was obvious, either due to bowing of the limbs or due to fractures sustained &quot;in utero&quot;. &quot;Tarda&quot; was used to classify the modern OI type I and some cases of type IV, where the inherent fragility of the bones did not become clear until long after birth. The idea that these &quot;late&quot; and &quot;prenatal&quot; forms were manifestations of the same disorder was first proposed in 1897 by Martin Benno Schmidt; by the 1950s this fact was well accepted.

The modern system of four types (I, II, III, IV), meanwhile, were introduced in a paper by David Sillence, Alison Senn, and David Danks in the &quot;Journal of Medical Genetics&quot; in 1979, and have since become standard terms among doctors, patients, and researchers. The modern genetic types, (those with numbers greater than IV,) have come into use as more and more recessively inherited forms of OI have been discovered since the discovery of the first one by Roy Morello &quot;et al.&quot; in 2006. In 2010, the International Nomenclature Group for Constitutional Disorders of the Skeleton (INCDS) &quot;freed&quot; the Sillence types from molecular reference, acquiescing to their new clinical-first role in the wake of what was to them a &quot;surprising&quot; increase in the number of genetic causes of OI.

Writing for the &quot;Annual Review of Genetics&quot; in 2012, Drs. Peter Byers and Shawna M. Pyott lamented how the expansion of the number of types to include genetic types has created a system that &quot;grew like Topsy&quot;. They suggest that it may indeed be impossible to create a system which is useful for clinicians and which accurately describes the genetic cause of a person&#x27;s OI, with attempts always prioritizing one use at the expense of the other.

==Society and culture==
Much medical research has been done into the causes of osteogenesis imperfecta, benefiting not only those with OI but medicine more broadly; in the ten years between 2006 and 2016, the many discoveries of non-collagen related recessive gene mutations, which still led in those who have them to the clinical signs of OI, led to numerous breakthroughs in medical understanding of the process of healthy bone development.

==Other animals==

In dogs, OI is an autosomal recessive condition, meaning that dogs with two copies of the allele will be affected. Many breed organizations and veterinarians offer OI tests to tell if a dog is a carrier of OI. To prevent OI, dogs who are heterozygous for OI should only be bred to non-carriers.

Naturally occurring mutations causing OI have been found in Golden Retrievers, Dachshunds, and Beagles. OI has also been identified in zebrafish and mice.

Although dogs, mice, fish, and humans are not genetically identical, some of these animal models have been officially recognized to represent the varying types of OI in humans. For example, homozygous &quot;oim&quot;/&quot;oim&quot; mice experience spontaneous bone fractures, small body size, and kyphosis, making them a model of OI type III. Meanwhile, heterozygous &quot;oim&quot;/+ mice appear normal but have bones which are quite a bit weaker than wild mice, making them a model for OI type I. As in human OI, the location on the gene which is mutated affects the severity of resulting disease—the G859C &quot;Col1a1&quot; mouse is a model for OI type II as affected mice all die in the perinatal period.

Animal testing on identified animal models may lead to human therapies for OI.

<text>Paul Eugene Forseth (born December 10, 1946) is a Canadian politician, who was a member of Parliament for British Columbia from 1993 to 2006.

He was first elected as the Member of Parliament for New Westminster—Burnaby in the 1993 federal election, as a member of the Reform Party of Canada, defeating New Democrat member of Parliament (MP) Dawn Black. He won reelection in 1997 as a Reform Party Member, in 2000 as a member of the Canadian Alliance and in 2004 as a member of the Conservative Party, until Black defeated him in the 2006 election.

During his 12 years of elected office, he was not part of the government, but served from the &#x27;Opposition Benches&#x27;.

In the Reform Party, he was instrumental to sponsor major planks of the Reform Party platform published in the Reform &quot;Blue Sheet&quot; concerning &#x27;Justice&#x27; and &#x27;Environment&#x27; policy, and led House of Commons debates on those subjects.

During his Canadian Alliance tenure, he was part of the &#x27;shadow cabinet&#x27; under Stockwell Day, leader of the Official Opposition.

During the Conservative Party term, he was his Party&#x27;s lead representative on the Government Operations and Estimates Committee, which investigated the administrative record of Privacy Commissioner George Radwanski. Forseth co-chaired the sub-committee which held in-camera investigative hearings. Radwanski was accused of falsifying documents and other administrative excesses by the Auditor General, (Ottawa Citizen Oct. 01, 2003) After Parliamentary hearings, the G.O.E.Committee tabled a report in the House of Commons. (37th PARLIAMENT, 2nd SESSION HANSARD • NUMBER 150 Tuesday, November 4, 2003) As a consequence, the House of Commons declared George Radwanski to be in contempt of Parliament. (37th PARLIAMENT, 2nd SESSION HANSARD • NUMBER 152 Thursday, November 6, 2003) “That this House find George Radwanski to have been in contempt of this House, and acknowledge receipt of his letter of apology, tabled and read to the House earlier today.”

Paul Forseth was also among the very few MPs in Parliamentary history to ever have his Private Members Bill, coming from the Opposition side of the House, cooperatively taken over by the government and incorporated into a larger piece Government Legislation. (Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act - discharge list). (Hansard Tuesday, October 22, 1996)

As of September 2009, Forseth is again a Conservative candidate. He said “I have been nominated as the Conservative Party candidate in the district of Burnaby-New Westminster. I am offering myself for service, as our community needs a Conservative voice at the national level.” (source - paulforseth - blogspot)

May 2, 2011, there was the national federal election, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper consolidated his government standing by achieving a majority by winning 167 out of 308 seats in the House of Commons. Paul Forseth was a candidate in the election but was not successful to unseat the NDP incumbent Peter Julian who has held the district of Burnaby-New Westminster since 2004. Mr. Forseth came in second place with the Liberal candidate Garth Evans achieving third place.

Forseth was the BC-Conservative Candidate (Provincial) for the local district of New Westminster. Voting Day was May 14, 2013, and he was unsuccessful.

He is retired and lives in Powell River, British Columbia.

<text>Sachertorte ( , ; ) is a chocolate cake, or torte, of Austrian origin, invented by Franz Sacher, supposedly in 1832 for Prince Metternich in Vienna. It is one of the most famous Viennese culinary specialties.

==History==

According to Franz Sacher&#x27;s son Eduard, Sachertorte was invented by Sacher when he was an apprentice under Metternich&#x27;s chef Chambellier. The story goes that Sacher was required to create a novel cake when the chef was ill. The Metternich connection was probably invented by Eduard many years later, to appeal to &quot;Viennese nostalgia for their imperial past&quot;.

Sachertorte remains popular in Austria and worldwide.

==Composition==
The cake consists of a dense chocolate cake with a thin layer of apricot jam in between two halves, coated in dark chocolate icing on the top and sides. It is traditionally served with unsweetened whipped cream.

==Variations==
Some of the various recipes for cakes similar to the &quot;Original&quot; are listed below. For example, at &quot;Graz-Kulturhauptstadt 2003&quot;, a festival marking the city of Graz being declared cultural capital that year, &quot;Wanda Sacher-Masoch-Torte&quot; was presented (its name alluding to Wanda von Sacher-Masoch, the wife of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch), using redcurrant jam and marzipan.

==Production and sale of the &quot;Original Sacher-Torte&quot;==

Hotel Sacher&#x27;s &quot;Original Sacher-Torte&quot; is sold at the Vienna and Salzburg locations of the Hotel Sacher, at Café Sacher branches in Innsbruck, Graz and Trieste, at the Sacher Shop in Bolzano, in the duty-free area of Vienna airport, and via the Hotel Sacher&#x27;s online shop.

The recipe of the Hotel Sacher&#x27;s version of the cake is a closely guarded secret. Those privy to it claim that the secret to the Sachertorte&#x27;s desirability lies not in the ingredients of the cake itself, but rather those of the chocolate icing. According to widely available information, the icing consists of three special types of chocolate, which are produced exclusively by different manufacturers for this sole purpose. The hotel obtains these products from Lübeck, in Germany, and from Belgium.

The Hotel Sacher has gone to great lengths to distinguish the &quot;Original Sacher-Torte&quot; from other variations. This includes four golden corners on the wooden box, the wood engraving of the Hotel Sacher Wien as well as &quot;Das Original&quot; and &quot;Hotel Sacher Wien&quot; in writing in the inside of the lid, and bordeaux red wrapping paper with a Biedermeier motif.

===Legal dispute with Demel&#x27;s===
In 1934, the Demel pastry shop started selling &quot;Eduard Sacher-Torte&quot;, while the Sacher Hotel sold the &quot;Original Sacher-Torte&quot;. The hotel&#x27;s owners sued Demel for trademark infringement, and won in 1938. There was a legal appeal after the war, but the hotel was eventually given the exclusive right to call its version &quot;the original&quot;.

<doc id="891533" wikidata="Q783086" url="?curid=891533" title="Dataphor">
<text>Dataphor is an open-source truly-relational database management system (RDBMS) and its accompanying user interface technologies, which together are designed to provide highly declarative software application development. The Dataphor Server has its own storage engine or it can be a virtual, or federated, DBMS, meaning that it can utilize other database engines for storage.

Dataphor has been praised for its adherence to relational principles, more closely so than any SQL product.

==Overview==
The stated purpose of Dataphor is to attempt to raise the bar of automation when building and maintaining complex software applications. Originally referred to as a framework, Dataphor provides more of a software development platform, complete with its own programming and user interface paradigms.

Dataphor is broadly divided into two components: the Dataphor Server, and the Dataphor Frontend. The purpose of the Dataphor Server is to provide a standardized language and runtime for the definition, manipulation, and integrity of application data. The Frontend is concerned with the dynamic derivation of user interfaces and the presentation thereof in either the Windows or Web thin client.

Dataphor does not employ SQL as its primary database language since SQL purportedly violates important principles of the relational model. Dataphor&#x27;s D4 language is based on the principles of Christopher J Date&#x27;s and Hugh Darwen&#x27;s Tutorial D, but with a Pascal-like imperative syntax.

Though Dataphor espouses to be truly relational, it does incorporate the concept of NULLs as found in SQL, which many claim to be contraindicated by the Relational Model. NULLs and the matter of managing missing information, however, continue to be debated.

In addition to the data management focus of the Dataphor Server, Dataphor includes tools which allow the presentation of user interfaces through Windows and Web &quot;thin&quot; clients. Dataphor takes advantage of the relational inference capabilities of the Dataphor compiler in order to allow complete GUI forms to be derived directly from the data model. The unique aspect of Dataphor&#x27;s user interface &quot;derivation&quot; is that it may be based on any relational expression (query) rather than merely base tables.

==Truly relational==
Dataphor strives for theoretical compliance to relational principles. While they try to adhere to the principles in The Third Manifesto, they deviated in a few places from what the Third Manifesto strived for, but not in places that were violations of Codd&#x27;s 12 rules. E.g. they included nulls, but they claim to have a systematic treatment of them.

While many systems built on SQL fail miserably with respect to Codd&#x27;s rule 9 &quot;Logical data independence&quot;, Dataphor applications can automatically change when the logical layer change. E.g. when a new column is added to the system, no additional development is needed to have that be a new field visible to the users for viewing or editing.

==Expert opinions on Dataphor==
Hugh Darwen has referred to D4, as a notable project in his talk entitled &quot;The Askew Wall&quot;. Chris Date refers to Dataphor as a product that attempts to implement the Third Manifesto. Fabian Pascal calls Dataphor &quot;Truly Relational&quot;, and &quot;superior to SQL&quot;

==History==
In 1999, point of sale systems developer Softwise Inc, found they were writing much of the same code over and over again, and looked for a tool to automate their database applications. They didn&#x27;t find an application which did what they want, so they created a division of their company, called it Alphora, and set some of their developers to build such a tool. That tool became Dataphor. It is said to be the first truly relational DBMS since IBM Business System 12. Development of Dataphor began shortly before 2000, with a 1.0 release in 2001.

In early 2008, the Alphora name and the Dataphor product were acquired by Database Consulting Group, which was founded by the original architects of Dataphor, who left Softwise in 2007. After the acquisition, Dataphor was re-licensed as open source under the BSD License.

==Technology==
Dataphor utilizes the Microsoft .NET Framework and is written entirely in C#. The following is a summary of the various technology components of Dataphor:

===Dataphor Server===
The Dataphor Server has several components including:
* Call-level interface - session management, process scheduler, etc.
* Data Dictionary Catalog - containing all of the Tables, Views, Operators, Constraints, References, and other schema objects.
* D4 Scanner, Parser, Emitter, and Compiler.
* D4 Runtime - including relational, and scalar processing
* Storage Integration layer - real-time translation to various dialects of SQL

====Languages====
While Dataphor supports a SQL flavor they call &quot;RealSQL&quot;, D4 is the preferred language for use within Dataphor, D4 supports DDL and DML statements. D4 queries tend to look like relational algebra expressions with written out names of operators. For example:
=====Syntax=====
D4 has a Pascal-like syntax. D4 sample code is usually written in UpperCamelCase, which is also widely used in Pascal and Delphi systems.

Like most query languages, D4 has a Data Definition Language (DDL) and a Data Manipulation Language (DML). D4 also has an Imperative Language for procedural code.

======Data Definition Language======
The DDL for Dataphor bears many similarities to other DBMSs, but with an obviously Pascal-like twist. Many of the allowed DDL operations, like constraints, allow relational declarative statements to be used, which many believe is superior to the procedural style operations used in SQL.

======Data Manipulation Language======
The DML syntax at first glance may appear to be similar to SQLs syntax, but because of D4&#x27;s closer ties to relational algebra, the syntax has a cleaner definition, and most users greatly prefer it over SQL. 

======Imperative language======
The Imperative Language in D4 is remarkably similar to Pascal in many respects. The largest distinction being that D4 also allows DDL and DML statements to be run in regular procedural code.

=====History=====
D4 was named after the similar-sounding Dataphor, the system that uses the language. It was some time after these names were decided that its creators discovered Tutorial D, and the coincidence it had with that name. Since discovering Tutorial D and The Third Manifesto, the creators have used The Third Manifesto as a guide in making Dataphor and D4. Since then, Hugh Darwen has referred to D4, as a notable project in his talk entitled &quot;The Askew Wall&quot;.

====Federated Storage Engine====
While Dataphor has a storage engine of its own, it can also connect to other RDBMSes, and use them as a storage engine. Dataphor can use the following DBMSes as storage engines:
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle
* IBM Db2
* and others

Dataphor can access Oracle, IBM Db2, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL and any other storage engine with a single unified language.

===Frontend Library===
The Dataphor Frontend library provides for the delivery of dynamically derived, or pre-designed static forms. The library is exposed as a standard set of D4 functions (called operators in D4) such as Form (&quot;, &quot;) and Derive (&quot;, &quot;). The resulting forms are described in an XML dialect called a Dataphor Form Document (DFD). The form description is high-level, consisting of a general description of the user interface aspects as they apply independent of client platform.

===Dataphoria IDE===
Dataphoria is an integrated development environment for:
* Editing D4
* &quot;Ad hoc&quot; execution of D4
* Creating, Editing, and Customizing (inherited) forms
* Managing libraries
* Analyzing execution plans

===Windows Client===
The Dataphor Windows Client is a thin client in the sense that it is not pre-programmed for a particular application. The Windows client establishes a connection to a Dataphor Server, from which it (through D4) requests form definitions and coordinates the manipulation of application data. The DFD documents are interpreted into concrete Windows Forms controls, but while maintaining the conceptual DOM of the DFD.

===Web Client===
The Dataphor Web Client is a basic implementation of a Dataphor client, which is manifest as an ASP.NET web application. Like the Windows Client, the Web Client connects to and requests forms and data from and instance of the Dataphor Server. Rather than synchronizing a DFD to Windows controls, however, the Web Client renders HTML which is displayed in a browser. In this way, the Web &quot;Client&quot; is a client relative to the Dataphor Server, but a server relative to the end web browser.

<doc id="891537" wikidata="Q1972689" url="?curid=891537" title="Electric switchboard">
<text>An electric switchboard is a piece of equipment that distributes electric power from one or more sources of supply to several smaller load circuits. It is an assembly of one or more panels, each of which contains switching devices for the protection and control of circuits fed from the switchboard. Several manufacturers make switchboards used in industry, commercial buildings, telecommunication facilities, oil and gas plants, data centers, health care, and other buildings, and onboard large ships. A switchboard is divided into different interconnected sections, generally consisting of a main section and a distribution section. These two sections are sometimes replaced by a combination section, which is a section that can fulfill the roles of both of the aforementioned sections. Switchboards can also sometimes come with an auxiliary section that is used to house devices that cannot be housed in the same section as other devices.

==Definition==
The U.S. National Electrical Code (NEC) defines a switchboard as &quot;a large single panel, frame, or assembly of panels on which are mounted, on the face, back, or both, switches, over-current and other protective devices, buses, and usually instruments&quot;. The role of a switchboard is to allow the division of the current supplied to the switchboard into smaller currents for further distribution and to provide switching, current protection and (possibly) metering for those various currents. In general, switchboards may distribute power to transformers, panelboards, control equipment, and, ultimately, to individual system loads.

==Components==
Inside a switchboard there will be one or more busbars. These are flat strips of copper or aluminum, to which the switchgear is connected. Busbars carry large currents through the switchboard and are supported by insulators. Bare busbars are common, but many types are now manufactured with an insulating cover on the bars, leaving only connection points exposed.

In a modern switchboard, the operator is protected from electrical injury by metal-enclosed circuit breakers, switches, and fuses. There may also be instruments and controls for the supply of electricity to the switchboard. For example, a switchboard for a bank of electrical generators, especially frequency would have control of AC power and load sharing, and instruments for frequency, voltage, current, and energy, with perhaps a synchroscope. A main switchboard is a large electrical switchboard that connects to the grid and distributes power to other smaller switchboards on the site.

<doc id="891543" wikidata="Q3416792" url="?curid=891543" title="Radio Paradise">
<text>Radio Paradise, is a non-commercial, listener-supported Internet radio station. The station is based in the United States. 
== Streams ==
Radio Paradise&#x27;s streams are available in multiple compressed audio formats, as well as lossless FLAC. These streams can be accessed on many kinds of devices and operating systems.

The players buffer the stream ahead, which allows users to skip individual tracks. The players provide detailed information on the artist being played, including data from the artist&#x27;s Wikipedia page, the album cover, lyrics, distribution of user ratings, and a scrolling list of often colorful user comments, sometimes embellished with videos.

The website and playout systems use Linux and customized open-source software components for most of its sections, a system devised by Goldsmith initially for KPIG&#x27;s playout system.

==History==

The station was started in February 2000 by Bill Goldsmith and his wife, Rebecca Goldsmith. Bill had worked in radio since leaving high school in 1971 and began to experiment with webcasting in 1995. Radio Paradise was originally operated from the Goldsmith&#x27;s home in Paradise, California, from which the station derives its name. The station had relocated to the Borrego Valley (east of San Diego, California) in 2016, before the town of Paradise was largely destroyed by the Camp Fire in November 2018. In 2022, Rebecca retired, and Bill&#x27;s daughter, Alanna, assumed Rebecca&#x27;s role. The station relocated to Eureka, California.

Radio Paradise was featured in a &quot;TIME&quot; magazine article from April 11, 2004, called &quot;The Revolution in Radio&quot;.

In April 2006, Radio Paradise introduced the Listeners World Map, showing the numbers and locations of listeners across the world, currently located under Community/Who&#x27;s Listening.

In June 2006, Radio Paradise began trial runs of Octoshape for its 192 kbit/s MP3 stream. In September 2006, the station began a 128 kbit/s AAC stream. In 2012, RP began a 320 kbp/s AAC stream and is now also offering lossless (FLAC) streaming.

===2007 royalty rate increase===
On March 6, 2007, the Copyright Royalty Board increased royalty rates, which would have raised the station&#x27;s royalty fees tenfold. In subsequent negotiations, royalty rates were established that allowed Radio Paradise and other Internet radio stations to continue their operation.

<doc id="891544" wikidata="Q2637977" url="?curid=891544" title="Humanist Manifesto">
<text>Humanist Manifesto is the title of three manifestos laying out a humanist worldview. They are the original &quot;A Humanist Manifesto&quot; (1933, often referred to as &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot; I), the &quot;Humanist Manifesto II&quot; (1973), and &quot;Humanism and Its Aspirations: Humanist Manifesto III&quot; (2003). The original manifesto originally arose from religious humanism, though secular humanists also signed.

The central theme of all three manifestos is the elaboration of a philosophy and value system which does not necessarily include belief in any personal deity or &quot;higher power&quot;, although the three differ considerably in their tone, form, and ambition. Each has been signed at its launch by various prominent members of academia and others who are in general agreement with its principles.

==&quot;A Humanist Manifesto&quot; (I)==
&quot;A Humanist Manifesto&quot; was written in 1933 primarily by Roy Wood Sellars and Raymond Bragg and was published with 34 signatories including philosopher John Dewey. Unlike later revisions, the first manifesto talked of a new &quot;religion&quot;, and referred to humanism as a religious movement to transcend and replace previous religions that were based on allegations of supernatural revelation. The document outlines a 15-point belief system, which, in addition to a secular outlook, opposes &quot;acquisitive and profit-motivated society&quot; and outlines a worldwide egalitarian society based on voluntary mutual cooperation, language which was considerably softened by the humanists&#x27; board, owners of the document, twenty years later.

The title &quot;A Humanist Manifesto&quot;—rather than &quot;The Humanist Manifesto&quot;—was intentional, predictive of later manifestos to follow, as indeed has been the case. Unlike the creeds of major organized religions, the setting out of humanist ideals in these manifestos is an ongoing process. Indeed, in some communities of humanists the compilation of personal manifestos is actively encouraged, and throughout the humanist movement it is accepted that the humanist manifestos are not permanent or authoritative dogmas but are to be subject to ongoing critique.

==&quot;Humanist Manifesto II&quot;==
The second manifesto was written in 1973 by Paul Kurtz and Edwin H. Wilson, and was intended to update and replace the previous one. It begins with a statement that the excesses of Nazism and World War II had made the first seem &quot;far too optimistic&quot;, and indicated a more hardheaded and realistic approach in its 17-point statement, which was much longer and more elaborate than the previous version. Nevertheless, much of the unbridled optimism of the first remained, with hopes stated that war would become obsolete and poverty would be eliminated.

Many of the proposals in the document, such as opposition to racism and weapons of mass destruction and support of strong human rights, are fairly uncontroversial, and its prescriptions that divorce and birth control should be legal and that technology can improve life are widely accepted today in much of the Western world. However, in addition to its rejection of supernaturalism, various controversial stances are strongly supported, notably the right to abortion.

Initially published with a small number of signatures, the document was circulated and gained thousands more, and indeed the American Humanist Association website encourages visitors to add their own names. A provision at the end noted that signators do &quot;not necessarily endors[e] every detail&quot; of the document.

Among the oft-quoted lines from this 1973 manifesto are: &quot;No deity will save us; we must save ourselves&quot;, and &quot;We are responsible for what we are and for what we will be&quot;, both of which may present difficulties for members of certain Christian, Jewish, and Muslim sects, or other believers in doctrines of submission to the will of an all-powerful God.

==&quot;Humanism and Its Aspirations: Humanist Manifesto III&quot;==
With a full title of &quot;Humanism and Its Aspirations: Humanist Manifesto III, a Successor to the Humanist Manifesto of 1933&quot;, this work was published in 2003 by the American Humanist Association, and was written by committee. Signatories included 22 Nobel laureates. The new document is a successor to the previous ones.

The newest manifesto is deliberately much shorter, listing six primary themes, which echo those of its predecessors:

* Knowledge of the world is derived by observation, experimentation, and rational analysis. 
* Humans are an integral part of nature, the result of evolutionary change, an unguided process.
* Ethical values are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience. 
* Life&#x27;s fulfillment emerges from individual participation in the service of humane ideals.
* Humans are social by nature and find meaning in relationships.
* Working to benefit society maximizes individual happiness.

==Other manifestos for humanism==

Aside from the three &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot;s of the American Humanist Association (AHA), there have been other similar documents. The name &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot; is claimed as a trademark by the AHA, though other organizations such as Council for Secular Humanism have used the term anyway. Formulation of new statements in emulation of the original three &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot;s is encouraged by AHA, and examples follow.

===&quot;A Secular Humanist Declaration&quot;===

The Council for Secular Humanism, founded by Paul Kurtz, published its &quot;A Secular Humanist Declaration&quot; in 1980, addressing the following themes:

# Free inquiry
# Separation of church and state
# The ideal of freedom
# Ethics based on critical intelligence
# Moral education
# Religious skepticism
# Reason
# Science and technology
# Evolution
# Education

&quot;A Secular Humanist Declaration&quot; was an argument for and statement of support for democratic secular humanism. The document was issued by the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (CODESH), later renamed the Council for Secular Humanism (CSH). Compiled by Paul Kurtz, it is largely a restatement of the content of the American Humanist Association&#x27;s 1973 &quot;Humanist Manifesto II&quot;, of which Kurtz was co-author with Edwin H. Wilson. Both had served as editors of &quot;The Humanist&quot;, from which Kurtz departed in 1979 and thereafter set about establishing his own movement and his own periodical. His &quot;A Secular Humanist Declaration&quot; was the starting point for these enterprises.

===&quot;Humanist Manifesto 2000&quot;===
&quot;Humanist Manifesto 2000: A Call for New Planetary Humanism&quot; is a book by Paul Kurtz published in 2000. It differs from the above works in that it is a full-length book rather than essay-length. It was published not by the American Humanist Association but by the Council for Secular Humanism. In it, Kurtz argues for many of the points already formulated in &quot;Humanist Manifesto II&quot;, of which he had been co-author in 1973.

===&quot;Amsterdam Declaration 2002&quot;===
The &quot;Amsterdam Declaration 2002&quot; is a statement of the fundamental principles of modern humanism passed unanimously by the General Assembly of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) at the 50th anniversary World Humanist Congress in 2002. According to the IHEU, the declaration &quot;is the official statement of World Humanism&quot;.

It is officially supported by all member organizations of the IHEU including:

*American Humanist Association
*British Humanist Association
*Humanist Canada
*Council of Australian Humanist Societies
*Council for Secular Humanism
*Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association
*Human-Etisk Forbund, the Norwegian humanist association
*Humanist Association of Ireland
*Indian Humanist Union
*Philippine Atheists and Agnostics Society

This declaration makes exclusive use of capitalized &quot;Humanist&quot; and &quot;Humanism&quot;, which is consistent with IHEU&#x27;s general practice and recommendations for promoting a unified humanist identity. To further promote humanist identity, these words are also free of any adjectives, as recommended by prominent members of IHEU. Such usage is not universal among IHEU member organizations, though most of them do observe these conventions.

<text>A Humanist Manifesto, also known as Humanist Manifesto I to distinguish it from later &quot;Humanist Manifestos&quot; in the series, was written in 1933 primarily by Raymond Bragg and published with 34 signers. Unlike the later manifestos, this first talks of a new religion and refers to humanism as &quot;the religion of the future.&quot; Nevertheless, it is careful not to express a creed or dogma. The document outlines fifteen affirmations on cosmology, biological and cultural evolution, human nature, epistemology, ethics, religion, self-fulfillment, and the quest for freedom and social justice. This latter, stated in article fourteen, proved to be the most controversial, even among humanists, in its opposition to &quot;acquisitive and profit-motivated society&quot; and its demand for an egalitarian world community based on voluntary mutual cooperation. The document&#x27;s release was reported by the mainstream media on May 1, simultaneous with its publication in the May/June 1933 issue of the &quot;New Humanist&quot;. 

Two manifestos followed: &quot;Humanist Manifesto II&quot; in 1973 and &quot;Humanism and Its Aspirations&quot; in 2003.

<text>The Battle of Amiens, also known as the Third Battle of Picardy was the opening phase of the Allied offensive which began on 8 August 1918, later known as the Hundred Days Offensive, which ultimately led to the end of World War I. Allied forces advanced over on the first day, one of the greatest advances of the war, with Gen Henry Rawlinson&#x27;s British Fourth Army, with nine of its 19 divisions supplied by the fast-moving Australian Corps of Lt General John Monash and Canadian Corps of Lt General Arthur Currie, and Gen Marie Eugène Debeney&#x27;s French First Army playing a decisive role. The battle is also notable for its effects on both sides&#x27; morale and the large number of surrendering German forces. This led Erich Ludendorff to later describe the first day of the battle as &quot;the black day of the German Army&quot;. Amiens was one of the first major battles involving armoured warfare.

== Prelude ==
On 21 March 1918, the German Army had launched Operation Michael, the first in a series of attacks planned to drive the Allies back along the length of the Western Front. After the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with revolutionary-controlled Russia, the Germans were able to transfer hundreds of thousands of men to the Western Front, giving them a significant, if temporary, advantage in manpower and materiel. These offensives were intended to translate this advantage into victory. Operation Michael was intended to defeat the right wing of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), but a lack of success around Arras ensured the ultimate failure of the offensive. A final effort was aimed at the town of Amiens, a vital railway junction, but the advance had been halted at Villers-Bretonneux by British and Australian troops on 4 April.
Subsequent German offensivesOperation Georgette (9–11 April), Operation Blücher-Yorck (27 May), Operation Gneisenau (9 June) and Operation Marne-Rheims (15–17 July) all made advances elsewhere on the Western Front, but failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough.

By the end of the Marne-Rheims offensive, the German manpower advantage had been spent, and their supplies and troops were exhausted. The Allied general, General Ferdinand Foch, ordered a counteroffensive which led to victory at the Second Battle of the Marne, following which he was promoted to Marshal of France. The Germans, recognising their untenable position, withdrew from the Marne to the north. Foch now tried to move the Allies back onto the offensive.

=== Plan ===
Foch disclosed the plan on 23 July, following the Allied victory at the Battle of Soissons. The plan called for reducing the Saint-Mihiel salient (which would later see combat in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel) and freeing the railway lines that ran through Amiens from German shellfire.

The commander of the British Expeditionary Force, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, already had plans in place for an attack near Amiens. When the British retreat had ended in April, the headquarters of the British Fourth Army under General Sir Henry Rawlinson had taken over the front astride the Somme. Its left-hand corps was the British III Corps under Lieutenant General Richard Butler. At the same time, the Australian Corps under Lieutenant General John Monash held the right flank and linked up with French armies to the south. On 30 May, all the Australian infantry divisions were united under the corps HQ for the first time on the Western Front. The Australians had mounted several local counter-attacks which both revealed the suitability of the open and firm terrain south of the Somme for a larger offensive, and established and refined the methods which were to be used.

The plan&#x27;s mastermind was Monash, who used the same innovation and mastery of modern technology, particularly tanks, that he had demonstrated five weeks earlier in the Battle of Hamel. Sir Douglas Haig recorded in his diary how Monash had told him that he “had all the threads of the operation in his hands.&quot;

Rawlinson submitted Monash&#x27;s proposals to Haig in July, and Haig forwarded them to Foch. At a meeting on 24 July, Foch agreed to the plan but insisted that the French First Army, which held the front to the south of the British Fourth Army, should participate. Rawlinson opposed this as his and Monash&#x27;s plans depended on the large-scale use of tanks (now finally available in large numbers) to achieve surprise by avoiding a preliminary bombardment. The French First Army lacked tanks and would be forced to bombard the German positions before the infantry advance began, thus removing the element of surprise. Eventually, it was agreed that the French would participate but not launch their attack until 45 minutes after the Fourth Army. It was also agreed to advance the proposed date of the attack from 10 to 8 August to strike the Germans before they had completed their withdrawal from the Marne salient.

Rawlinson had already finalised his plans on 21 July after discussing them with his Corps commanders (Butler, Monash, Sir Arthur Currie of the Canadian Corps and Lieutenant General Charles Kavanagh of the Cavalry Corps). For the first time, the Australians would attack with the Canadian Corps. 

The Australians tested the tactical methods in a local counter-attack at the Battle of Hamel on 4 July. The German defenders of Hamel were deeply dug in, and their position commanded a vast field of fire. Similar positions had resisted capture for two months in the Battle of the Somme. The Australians had used surprise rather than weight at Hamel. The artillery had opened fire only at the moment the infantry and tanks advanced, and the Germans were rapidly overrun.

A critical factor in the final plan was secrecy. There was to be no artillery bombardment a significant time before the attack, as was the usual practice, only fire immediately before the advance of Australian, Canadian, and British forces. The final plan for the Fourth Army involved 1,386 field guns and howitzers and 684 heavy guns, making up 27 medium artillery brigades and thirteen heavy batteries, in addition to the infantry divisions&#x27; artillery. The fire plan for the Fourth Army&#x27;s artillery was devised by Monash&#x27;s senior artillery officer, Major General C. E. D. Budworth. British sound ranging advances in artillery techniques and aerial photographic reconnaissance made it possible to dispense with &quot;ranging shots&quot; to ensure accurate fire. Budworth had produced a timetable which allowed 504 out of 530 German guns to be hit at &quot;zero hour&quot;, while a creeping barrage preceded the infantry. This method was similar to the &quot;Feuerwalze&quot; which the Germans themselves had used in their Spring Offensive, but its effectiveness was increased by the surprise achieved.

There were also to be 580 tanks. The Canadian and Australian Corps were each allocated a brigade of four battalions, with 108 Mark V fighting tanks, 36 Mark V &quot;Star&quot;, and 24 unarmed tanks intended to carry supplies and ammunition forward. A single battalion of Mark V tanks was allocated to the III Corps. The Cavalry Corps were allocated two battalions each of 48 Medium Mark A Whippet tanks.

The Allies successfully moved the Canadian Corps of four infantry divisions to Amiens without being detected by the Germans. This was a noteworthy achievement and reflected well on the increasingly efficient staff work of the British armies. A detachment from the Corps of two infantry battalions, a wireless unit, and a casualty clearing station had been sent to the front near Ypres to bluff the Germans that the entire Corps was moving north to Flanders. The Canadian Corps was not fully in position until 7 August. To maintain secrecy, the Allied commanders pasted the notice &quot;Keep Your Mouth Shut&quot; into orders issued to the men and referred to the action as a &quot;raid&quot; rather than an &quot;offensive&quot;.

=== Preliminaries ===
Although the Germans were still on the offensive in late July, the Allied armies strengthened as more American units arrived in France. British reinforcements were transferred from the Home Army in Britain and the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The German commanders realised in early August that their forces might be forced onto the defensive, though Amiens was not considered to be a likely front. The Germans believed the French would probably attack the Saint-Mihiel front east of Rheims, or in Flanders near Mount Kemmel, while they believed the British would attack along either the Lys or near Albert. The Allies had indeed mounted several local counter-offensives in these sectors to gain local objectives, improve their defensive positions, and distract attention from the Amiens sector. German forces began withdrawing from the Lys and other fronts in response to these theories. The Allies maintained equal artillery and air fire along their various fronts, moving troops only at night and feigning movements during the day to mask their actual intent.

The German front east of Amiens was held by their Second Army under General Georg von der Marwitz, with six divisions in line (and two facing the French 1st Army). There were only two divisions in immediate reserve. There was some concern among the Allies on 6 August when the German 27th Division attacked north of the Somme on the part of the front on which the Allies planned to attack two days later. The German division (a specially selected and trained &quot;Stosstruppen&quot; formation) penetrated roughly into the one-and-a-half-mile front. This attack was made in retaliation for a trench raid by the 5th Australian Division north of the Somme on the night of 31 July, which had taken many prisoners before the Australian Corps was concentrated south of the river. The German division moved back towards its original position on the morning of 7 August, but the movement still required changes to the Allied plan.

To increase the level of surprise further, the rumble of the approaching tanks was to be masked by bombers flying up and down the German lines. The bombers were twin-engine Handley Page O-400&#x27;s with engines similar to the tanks. However, the two RAF squadrons detailed to take part decided it was too hazardous to order planes into the air in the unseasonably dense fog and asked for volunteers. Two volunteered from 207 Squadron, Captains Gordon Flavelle and William Peace, and both were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

== Battle ==


===First phase===
The battle began in dense fog at 4:20 am on 8 August. Under Rawlinson&#x27;s Fourth Army, the British III Corps attacked north of the Somme, the Australian Corps to the south of the river in the centre of Fourth Army&#x27;s front, and the Canadian Corps to the south of the Australians. The French 1st Army under General Debeney opened its preliminary bombardment at the same time and began its advance 45 minutes later, supported by a battalion of 72 Whippet tanks. Although German forces were on the alert, this was mainly in anticipation of possible retaliation for their incursion on the sixth and not because they had learned of the preplanned Allied attack. Although the two forces were within of one another, gas bombardment was very low, as the bulk of the Allied presence was unknown to the Germans. The attack was so unexpected that German forces only began to return fire after five minutes, and even then, at the positions where the Allied forces had assembled at the start of the battle and had long since left.

In the first phase, seven divisions attacked: the British 18th (Eastern) and 58th (2/1st London), the Australian 2nd and 3rd, and the Canadian 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions. Troops of the 33rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army National Guard supported the British attackers north of the Somme.

The attackers captured the first German position, advancing about by about 7:30 am. In the centre, supporting units following the leading divisions attacked the second objective a further distant. Australian units reached their first objectives by 7:10 am, and by 8:20 am, the Australian 4th and 5th Divisions and the Canadian 4th Division passed through the initial breach in the German lines. The third phase of the attack was assigned to infantry-carrying Mark V* tanks; however, the infantry was able to carry out this final step unaided. The Allies penetrated well to the rear of the German defenses, and cavalry now continued the advance, one brigade in the Australian sector and two cavalry divisions in the Canadian sector. Aircraft fire by the new RAF and armoured car fire kept the retreating Germans from rallying.

The Canadian and Australian forces in the centre advanced quickly, pushing the line forward from its starting point by 11:00 am. The speed of their advance was such that a party of German officers and some divisional staff were captured while eating breakfast. A gap long was punched in the German line south of the Somme by the end of the day. There was less success north of the river, where the British III Corps had only a single tank battalion in support, the terrain was rougher, and the German incursion of 6 August had disrupted some of the preparations. The corps gained its first objectives but was held up short of the Chipilly spur, &quot;a bare seventy-five-foot-high ridge&quot; in an oxbow bend of the Somme near the village of Chipilly.

The French forces on the right flank also attacked, capturing Moreuil by 9:30 am. They shelled the Germans for three hours and twenty minutes. The French IX Corps began to advance but was stopped on the Avre. Later, the XXXI Corps took Mézières and occupied Fresnoy by nine o&#x27;clock. The French suffered 3,500 casualties and took over 5,000 German soldiers prisoner.

The Allies penetrated 10 miles, at a cost of 12,000 casualties, and captured over 15,000 prisoners. Total German losses were estimated to be 30,000 on 8 August. The British, Australian and Canadian infantry of the Fourth Army sustained about 8,000 casualties, with further losses by tank and air personnel, and French forces.

German Army Chief of Staff Paul von Hindenburg noted the Allies&#x27; use of surprise and that Allied destruction of German lines of communication had hampered potential German counter-attacks by isolating command positions. The German General Erich Ludendorff described the first day of Amiens as the &quot;Schwarzer Tag des deutschen Heeres&quot; (the &quot;black day of the German Army&quot;), not because of the ground lost to the advancing Allies, but because the morale of the German troops had sunk to the point where large numbers of troops began to capitulate. He recounted instances of retreating troops shouting &quot;You&#x27;re prolonging the war!&quot; at officers who tried to rally them, and &quot;Blackleg!&quot; at reserves moving up. Five German divisions had effectively been engulfed. Allied forces had pushed, on average, into enemy territory by the end of the day. The Canadians gained , Australians , the French , and the British .
=== Second phase ===
The advance continued on 9 August, though without the spectacular results of the first day. The battle was widened on the north and the south of the initial attack, with the southern part of the battle (involving French forces) called Battle of Montdidier ().

The infantry had outrun the supporting artillery, and the initial force of more than 500 tanks that played a prominent role in the Allied success was reduced to six battle-ready tanks within four days. On the Canadian front, congested roads and communication problems prevented the British 32nd Division from being pushed forward rapidly enough to maintain the momentum of the advance.

The Chipilly Spur was still in German hands. The Germans on the ridge commanded a wide field of fire to the south of the Somme. They poured devastating machine gun and artillery fire that kept the Australian Corps pinned down across the river at Hamel. The job of taking Chipilly Ridge was ultimately assigned to three battalions of American doughboys from the 33rd U.S. Infantry Division. According to B.J. Omanson, 

During the 33rd U.S. Division&#x27;s assault on Chipilly Ridge, Corporal Jake Allex, a Serbian immigrant from Kosovo, took command of his platoon after all the other officers had been killed. Corporal Allex led them in an attack against a German machine gun nest, during which he personally killed five enemy soldiers and captured fifteen prisoners. For his actions at Chipilly Ridge, Corporal Allex became the second American soldier to be awarded the Medal of Honor during the First World War.

On 10 August, there were signs that the Germans were pulling out of the salient from Operation Michael. According to official reports, the Allies had captured nearly 50,000 prisoners and 500 guns by 27 August. Even with the lessened armour, the British drove into German positions by 13 August.

Field Marshal Haig refused the request of Marshal Foch to continue the offensive, preferring instead to launch a fresh offensive by Byng&#x27;s Third Army between the Ancre and Scarpe. This offensive, the Second Battle of the Somme, took place 21 August – 3 September 1918.

== Aftermath ==
The Battle of Amiens was a significant turning point in the tempo of the war. The Germans had started the war with the Schlieffen Plan before the Race to the Sea slowed movement on the Western Front, and the war devolved into trench warfare. The German spring offensive earlier in 1918 had once again given Germany the offensive edge on the Western Front. Armoured support helped the Allies tear a hole through trench lines, weakening once-impregnable trench positions: the British Third Army, with no armoured support, had almost no effect on the line, while the Fourth, with fewer than a thousand tanks, broke deep into German territory.

The British war correspondent Philip Gibbs noted Amiens&#x27; effect on the war&#x27;s tempo, saying on 27 August that &quot;the enemy...is on the defensive&quot; and &quot;the initiative of attack is so completely in our hands that we are able to strike him at many different places.&quot; Gibbs also credits Amiens with a shift in troop morale, saying, &quot;The change has been greater in the minds of men than in the taking of territory. On our side, the army seems to be buoyed up with the enormous hope of getting on with this business quickly&quot; and that, &quot;there is a change also in the enemy&#x27;s mind. They no longer have even a dim hope of victory on this western front. All they hope for now is to defend themselves long enough to gain peace by negotiation.&quot;

==In popular culture==
On the night of August 8–9, 1918, as Doughboys from the 33rd U.S. Division were beginning their assault on Chipilly Ridge, American war poet Lt. John Allan Wyeth and Lieut. Thomas J. Cochrane were assigned to deliver sealed orders from Division HQ at Molliens-au-Bois to the Field Headquarters of all three battalions engaged in the attack. The location of each battalion was unknown, but they were believed to be along the northern bank of the Somme, near the village of Sailly-le-Sec. In his 1928 sonnet sequence &quot;This Man&#x27;s Army&quot;, Wyeth described the mission in detail in his six interlinked &quot;Chipilly Ridge sonnets.&quot;

According to Bradley J. Omanson, &quot;Lt. Wyeth, as it happened, was a cultured man, a recent Princeton graduate in languages and literature, and he rendered his experiences of that night into an accomplished, highly original cycle of six linked sonnets – part of a much longer cycle of over fifty sonnets which covered the entirety of his service in the war. But this self-contained six-sonnet sequence in particular – describing one soldier&#x27;s stumblings through the metaphoric valley of death – delves most memorably into the nature of war.&quot;

The Battle of Amiens was featured in Battlefield 1 as a map for the game&#x27;s modes, such as Conquest, Rush, and Team Deathmatch. It is also featured in the game&#x27;s operation of Kaiserschlacht.

The Battle of Amiens is featured as a pivotal point in season 2, episode 5 of the British period drama Downton Abbey, resulting in Mathew Crawley being severely injured and in William Mason&#x27;s ultimately death.

<doc id="891548" wikidata="Q4128145" url="?curid=891548" title="Humanist Manifesto II">
<text>Humanist Manifesto II, written in 1973 by humanists Paul Kurtz and Edwin H. Wilson, was an update to the previous &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot; published in 1933, and the second entry in the &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot; series. It begins with a statement that the excesses of National Socialism and world war had made the first Manifesto seem too optimistic, and indicated a more hardheaded and realistic approach in its seventeen-point statement, which was much longer and more elaborate than the previous version. Nevertheless, much of the optimism of the first remained in its expressed hope that war and poverty would be eliminated.

In addition to its absolute rejection of theism, deism and belief in credible proof of any afterlife, various political stances were supported, such as opposition to racism and weapons of mass destruction; support of human rights; a proposition of an international court; and the rights to unrestricted contraception, abortion, divorce, and death with dignity (e.g., euthanasia and suicide).

Initially published with a small number of signatures, the document was circulated and gained thousands more; the American Humanist Association&#x27;s website encourages visitors to add their own name. A provision at the end of the Manifestostating that the signators do &quot;not necessarily endorse every detail&quot; of the document, but only its broad visionlikely helped many overcome reservations about attaching their name.

One of the oft-quoted lines that comes from the Manifesto is, &quot;No deity will save us; we must save ourselves.&quot;

The &quot;Humanist Manifesto II&quot; first appeared in &quot;The Humanist&quot;&#x27;s September/October 1973 edition, when Paul Kurtz and Edwin H. Wilson were editor and editor emeritus, respectively.

<doc id="891550" wikidata="Q4152020" url="?curid=891550" title="Humanism and Its Aspirations">
<text>Humanism and Its Aspirations (subtitled &quot;Humanist Manifesto III, a successor to the Humanist Manifesto of 1933&quot;) is the most recent of the &quot;Humanist Manifestos&quot;, published in 2003 by the American Humanist Association (AHA). The newest one is much shorter, listing six primary beliefs, which echo themes from its predecessors:

* Knowledge of the world is derived by observation, experimentation, and rational analysis. (See empiricism.)
* Humans are an integral part of nature, the result of unguided evolutionary change.
* Ethical values are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience. (See ethical naturalism.)
* Life&#x27;s fulfillment emerges from individual participation in the service of humane ideals.
* Humans are social by nature and find meaning in relationships.
* Working to benefit society maximizes individual happiness.

It has been used as source material for secular and atheist ethics.

<doc id="891552" wikidata="Q703771" url="?curid=891552" title="Eulenburg affair">
<text>The Eulenburg affair (also called the Harden–Eulenburg affair) was a public controversy surrounding a series of courts-martial and five civil trials regarding accusations of homosexual conduct, and accompanying libel trials, among prominent members of Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s cabinet and entourage during 1907–1909. It has been described as &quot;the biggest homosexual scandal ever.&quot;

The issue centred on journalist Maximilian Harden&#x27;s accusations of homosexual conduct between the Kaiser&#x27;s close friend Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, and General Kuno von Moltke. Accusations and counter-accusations quickly multiplied, and the phrase &quot;Liebenberg Round Table&quot; came to be used for the homosexual circle around the Kaiser.

The affair received wide publicity and is often considered the biggest domestic scandal of Imperial Germany. It led to one of the first major public discussions of homosexuality in Germany, comparable to the trial of Oscar Wilde in England. Historians have linked the aftermath of the affair to the changes in German foreign policy that heightened its military aggression and ultimately contributed to World War I.

==Causes==
The scandal was used by opponents of Germany&#x27;s foreign policies. Wilhelm II dismissed &quot;Iron&quot; Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and his Realpolitik system of treaties and agreements in 1890, replacing Bismarck&#x27;s clear rule with a muddle and his foreign policies with a confrontational, expansionist &quot;Weltpolitik&quot;. The anti-imperialist Eulenburg became the most prominent member of Wilhelm II&#x27;s entourage, having been promoted from a member of the diplomatic corps to an ambassador. Like many others, Bismarck noticed that the nature of the relationship between Wilhelm II and Eulenburg could &quot;not be confided to paper&quot; and felt, alongside those others, that even these activities in the private sphere were not to be exposed to the public. Beyond that, the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; suffered what the British historian John C. G. Röhl called a &quot;culture of intrigue&quot; with German diplomats forever forming factions to plot against one another. The two dominant factions in the early 20th century were the faction headed by Friedrich von Holstein, the powerful director of the Political Department at the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot;, and the Bülow–Eulenburg clique, headed by Bernhard von Bülow and his close friend Eulenburg, which was rapidly eclipsing the Holstein faction. Holstein had known Eulenburg since June 1886 and had once been his ally when the two had plotted against Bismarck in 1889–1890, but starting around 1894, Eulenburg and Holstein had begun to come into conflict with each other. The close friendship between Eulenburg and the Kaiser meant that Holstein tended to lose his disputes with Eulenburg. As a trump card to destroy his rival Eulenburg, Holstein had contacted Maximilian Harden to inform him that Eulenburg was a homosexual.

Harden, imperialist head of the periodical &quot;Die Zukunft&quot;, felt similarly about the direction of German foreign policy, and in 1902 personally threatened to expose Eulenburg unless he retired from his ambassadorship in Vienna; Eulenburg did so, withdrawing from public life until 1906. Harden reaffirmed his threat after Germany at the Algeciras Conference of 1906 recognized Morocco as being within the French sphere of influence, in what was for Germany a major foreign policy fiasco, and Eulenburg responded by moving to Switzerland. In May 1906, Holstein sent Eulenburg an extremely insulting and rude letter alongside a challenge to fight a duel to the death. After Eulenburg declined to fight the duel, Holstein decided to destroy Eulenburg by exposing his homosexuality.

Between 1906 and 1907, six military officers committed suicide after blackmail, while in the preceding three years, around twenty officers were convicted by courts-martial, all for homosexual acts. A &quot;Gardes du Corps&quot; officer was charged with homosexuality, an embarrassment because the elite Corps was commanded by Lieutenant General Wilhelm Graf von Hohenau, a blood relative to the Kaiser. Worse than these sexual scandals, in Harden&#x27;s eyes, was Eulenburg&#x27;s decision to return to Germany and be admitted to the Order of the Black Eagle; he did not change his mind when Prince Friedrich Heinrich of Prussia declined to be admitted to the Order of Saint John because of his own homosexual proclivities.

==Outing==

Harden outed Eulenburg on April 27, 1907, confirming the identity he previously had parodied as &quot;the Harpist&quot; (Eulenburg), after outing &quot;Sweetie&quot; General Kuno Graf von Moltke in 1906. Wilhelm II, informed of the growing story, responded by requiring the resignation of three of fifteen prominent aristocrats, Hohenau, Moltke, and Count Johannes von Lynar, listed as homosexual by the Berlin vice squad; however, the actual list, not shown to Wilhelm II, contained several hundred names.

Moltke&#x27;s lawyer attempted to file criminal libel against Harden, but was dismissed and civil libel was suggested. Eulenburg denied any culpability and presented a self-accusation of violating the applicable Paragraph 175 to his district attorney who, as hoped and expected, cleared Eulenburg of all charges in July. Meanwhile, manager of the &quot;Königliche Oper&quot; , the crown prince&#x27;s equerry von Stückradt, and Imperial Chancellor Bernhard Prince von Bülow were accused of having homosexual tendencies or engaging in homosexual activities.

==The main trials==
===&quot;Moltke v. Harden&quot;===
This trial was held from October 23 to 29, 1907.

Testifying against Moltke were Lilly von Elbe, his former wife of nine years, a soldier named Bollhardt, and Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld. Elbe described the lack of conjugal relations, happening only on the first and second night of their marriage, Moltke&#x27;s overly close friendship with Eulenburg with whom he was always spending too much time, and her ignorance of homosexuality. Elbe&#x27;s testimony was sensational for the time and attracted much media attention as she spoke openly of her sexual needs and how difficult it was for her to be married to a man like Moltke who had no sexual interest in her, causing her to attack him several times in desperation. At the time, Germany had a very conservative culture where the existence of female sexuality was never spoken of in public, and Elbe&#x27;s testimony was noteworthy for the first time where the subject of female sexuality was addressed in Germany. The revelation that his young wife had attacked General von Moltke without his defending himself was seen at the time as confirming that Moltke was not manly, as the expectation was that a Prussian officer and a &quot;real man&quot; would have beaten his wife if she struck him, which in turn confirmed the belief that Moltke was gay. Moltke&#x27;s lawyers counterattacked using the subject of Elbe&#x27;s sexuality, arguing that any woman who spoke openly of her sexuality was a deranged &quot;hysterical nymphomaniac&quot; who could not be trusted. Bollhardt described attending champagne-filled parties at Lynar&#x27;s villa at which he saw both Hohenau and Moltke. Hirschfeld, a prominent German sexologist who was himself homosexual, had observed the trial and testified that Moltke most certainly had a feminine side and was homosexual even if he had never committed sodomy. On October 29, the court found Moltke homosexual and Harden innocent of libel.

However, the trial was voided on procedural grounds, and the state prosecutor decided to allow a criminal libel trial.

===&quot;Bülow v. Brand&quot;===

November 6, 1907.
Adolf Brand, founder of the first homosexual periodical, &quot;Der Eigene&quot; (&quot;The Unique&quot;), had printed a pamphlet which described how Bülow had been blackmailed for his sexuality and had kissed and embraced his private secretary Max Scheefer at male gatherings hosted by Eulenburg, and thus was morally obliged to publicly oppose Paragraph 175 . Brand was found guilty of libel and sentenced to 18 months in prison.

===&quot;Harden v. Moltke&quot;===
December 18–25, 1907.
Elbe, through a diagnosis of classical hysteria, and Hirschfeld, by retracting his earlier testimony, were discredited and Harden was convicted of libel and sentenced to four months imprisonment.

===&quot;Harden v. Städele&quot;===
April 21, 1908.
Now motivated by political goals, morals, and vengeance, Harden set out to prove Eulenburg&#x27;s homosexuality by having Anton Städele publish an article claiming Harden took hush money from Eulenburg. Harden then sued his accomplice for libel, Städele was found guilty and charged a hundred mark fine, repaid by Harden. During the trial, however, Georg Riedel and Jacob Ernst testified to having had sexual relations with Eulenburg. Eulenburg was charged with perjury and brought to trial on May 7, 1908. Two weeks later Harden&#x27;s conviction was overturned. A second trial was then scheduled.

===Eulenburg===
June 29, 1908.
After the first of 41 witnesses, including Ernst and ten witnesses who described watching Eulenburg through a keyhole in 1887, the trial was delayed because of Eulenburg&#x27;s ill health. It was moved to his hospital bed on July 17, but was delayed again. The trial was postponed indefinitely in 1909; until that point Eulenburg had twice-yearly undergone a medical examination to determine if he was well enough to stand trial.

===&quot;Moltke v. Harden&quot;===

April, 1909.
The trial date was originally set for November 24, 1908, but was postponed. With little press, Harden was again convicted and fined six hundred marks plus the forty thousand marks of court costs, while Moltke was rehabilitated in the public eye.

==Effects==

The stress of the trials caused most participants to get ill during 1908.

In November 1908, the chief of the Military Secretariat Dietrich von Hülsen-Haeseler died of a heart attack while performing a &quot;pas seul&quot; dressed in a woman&#x27;s ballet tutu for Wilhelm II and his hunting party, requiring further damage control in the form of a cover up.

Harden, like some in the upper echelons of the military and Foreign Office, resented Eulenburg&#x27;s approval of the Anglo-French Entente, and also his encouragement of Wilhelm to rule personally. The scandal led to Wilhelm suffering a nervous breakdown, and the removal of Eulenburg and others of his circle from the court. Despite Eulenburg&#x27;s own approval of &quot;Weltpolitik&quot;, his clique was a stabilizing factor. By removing Eulenburg, Harden enabled his own highly aggressive foreign policy to take root in the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot;. By 1914, Harden had moved sufficiently to the right that he welcomed the German invasion of Belgium. During the war, Harden was an annexationist who wrote numerous articles demanding that Germany win the war, annex most of Europe, Africa, and Asia, and become the world&#x27;s greatest power. However, after the defeat of Germany he became a pacifist. Eulenburg himself was irrelevant by then.

The Eulenburg affair has been held up as one example of anti-homosexuality sentiment being used as a means to attain certain political goals. As Eulenburg&#x27;s wife later commented, &quot;They are striking at my husband, but their target is the kaiser.&quot;

The affair also led people in other countries to perceive homosexuality as especially prevalent in Germany. New euphemisms for homosexuality came into use, such as (&quot;the German vice&quot;) or (in French), or (Italian) .

<text>The Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino (), formerly &quot;Partido ng Masang Pilipino&quot; (), is a populist political party in the Philippines. It is the political party of former Philippine President Joseph E. Estrada. In the May 1998 presidential election, it aligned itself with other political parties to form the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Struggle of the Patriotic Filipino Masses).

==History==

Originally named the Partido ng Masang Pilipino, the Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino emanated from an organization which was an offshoot of the Economic Recovery Action Program (ERAP) organized by George S. Antonio in May 1990. The ERAP organization was formally launched on October 4, 1990 with 21 original members. 

The organization grew exponentially with the recruitment of members nationwide. It was then that the PMP was accredited as a political party with the objective of helping to uplift the lives of the Filipino people, especially the poor and the disadvantaged, through effective and efficient social and economic reforms. Its first campaign headquarters was located at the 4th floor of San Buena Building, EDSA corner Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong. On August 20, 1991, PMP was formally accredited as a national political party.

In 1992, PMP took its first major political step by fielding then-Senator Joseph Estrada as its vice-presidential candidate together with other local candidates. Estrada became the running mate of Eduardo &quot;Danding&quot; Cojuangco Jr., the standard-bearer of the Nationalist People&#x27;s Coalition (NPC). Estrada overwhelmingly won the vice-presidency, defeating former Chief Justice Marcelo Fernan of the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino along with five other candidates.

In 1997, a permanent and fully operational headquarters was established at 409 Shaw Boulevard in Mandaluyong. In the 1998 Philippine general election, PMP was very much involved in the election with the candidacy of Estrada as president and other local candidates nationwide. PMP played a lead role in the establishment of the opposition coalition &quot;Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino&quot; (LAMMP), which also counted among its members the LDP and NPC. The coalition fielded full slates for the national and local levels. Card-bearing members reached as high as 3.2 million nationwide. Estrada won the presidential election, garnering almost 11 million votes and defeating nine other candidates including House Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr. of Lakas–NUCD–UMDP.

In 2001, PMP led the opposition coalition, fielding senatorial candidates from People&#x27;s Reform Party and LDP as well as independent candidates. The Puwersa ng Masa coalition won four seats in the Senate, including one for Estrada&#x27;s wife Luisa &quot;Loi&quot; Ejercito Estrada.

In 2003, the party&#x27;s name Partido ng Masang Pilipino was changed to &quot;Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino&quot;. In April 2004, the PMP agreed to enter into a coalition with the LDP and Partido Demokratiko Pilipino–Lakas ng Bayan (PDP–Laban) to form the Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (KNP), the dominant opposition coalition for the 2004 Philippine general election. The coalition fielded actor Fernando Poe Jr. and Senator Loren Legarda as candidates for president and vice-president, respectively. Poe and Legarda lost the election to incumbent President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and Senator Noli de Castro.

==In office==

Today, PMP occupies three Senate seats as a member of the minority floor, occupied by Estrada&#x27;s wife,
Luisa Ejercito Estrada, who won in 2001, his son, former San Juan suburb Mayor Jinggoy Estrada and long-time Estrada colleague veteran politician Juan Ponce Enrile, the last two winning in 2004.

In the May 14, 2007 election, the party won three seats in the House of Representatives. Members of the Philippine House of Representatives are elected to serve three year terms.

In the 17th Congress, the party held one senate seat held by Estrada&#x27;s son JV Ejercito, due to most members switching sides to PDP–Laban or UNA.

==In the news==
On January 18, 2008, Joseph Estrada&#x27;s Partido ng Masang Pilipino (PMP) placed full-page advertisements in Metro Manila newspapers, blaming EDSA 2 of having &quot;inflicted a dent on Philippine democracy&quot;. Its featured clippings questioned the constitutionality of the revolution. The published featured clippings were taken from &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Straits Times&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Asia Times Online&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, and &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;. Former Supreme Court justice Cecilia Muñoz Palma opined that EDSA 2 violated the 1987 Constitution.

Alfredo Lim, on August 20, 2008, resigned as head of Joseph Estrada&#x27;s Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino (Partido ng Masang Pilipino – PMP) following a PMP&#x27;s executive committee resolution removing him as president of the party. He was replaced by Joseph Estrada who is also the PMP chairman.

<text>Lowell Ganz (born August 31, 1948) is an American writer and producer. He is the long-time writing partner of Babaloo Mandel and has written for television, film, and theatre.

Ganz grew up in a Jewish family in Queens, New York, attending Martin Van Buren High School in Queens Village. He dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a career writing for sitcoms, starting with &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. From there, he moved on to writing for the TV series &quot;Happy Days&quot; and created two of its spin-off series, &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot; and &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot;.

In 1982, Ganz and Mandel teamed up with &quot;Happy Days&quot; actors Ron Howard and Henry Winkler to make their first film, the low-budget comedy &quot;Night Shift&quot;, which was also actor Michael Keaton&#x27;s first film; Howard signed on because he wanted to start directing while Winkler wanted to move away from his image as the Fonz. Ganz&#x27;s second film outing, &quot;Splash&quot;, made stars of Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah and earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.

Ganz and Mandel went on to write several other films, four more of which were also directed by Howard, and one of which had Penny Marshall, who starred in &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot;, as director. Four of their films have featured Billy Crystal, three have featured Michael Keaton, two have featured Tom Hanks, and two are about baseball. Ganz and Mandel are also widely used as Hollywood script doctors, known for their reliability and fast turnaround time.

Ganz lives in Los Angeles with his wife of more than 25 years. They have three children.

<doc id="891570" wikidata="Q6749545" url="?curid=891570" title="Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada">
<text>The Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada was a document drafted by a leftist faction of Canada&#x27;s New Democratic Party, known as the Waffle, in 1969. When that group briefly left the NDP between 1972 and 1974, it became their party&#x27;s main programmatic statement.

==Manifesto positions==
The Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada is also known as the Waffle Manifesto. It outlined the Waffle&#x27;s deep resentment of the &quot;American Empire&quot; and the organization&#x27;s commitment to furthering the socialist cause in Canada within the template of a successful democracy. The manifesto also included the Waffle movement&#x27;s feeling toward Quebec sovereignty.

The Manifesto helped contribute to a debate on American control of the Canadian economy and particularly the extent of US ownership of Canadian business and resources and the emergence in Canada of a branch plant economy. The Liberal government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau instituted attempts to assert domestic economic control such as the creation of Petro-Canada, meant to assert Canadian control of the energy sector, and the Foreign Investment Review Agency, intended to review and limit foreign ownership and particularly American takeovers of Canadian companies. These measures were introduced in part due to pressure by the NDP, particularly during the minority government that followed the 1972 election. The NDP, in turn, had urged these measures in part due to pressure by the Waffle within the party.

==History==
After 1974, when the Waffle&#x27;s party, Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada, disbanded, the Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada became a historical document. The name of the NDP&#x27;s Socialist Caucus&#x27;s Manifesto for a Socialist Canada is an echo of the earlier document&#x27;s influence.

<doc id="891574" wikidata="Q2185271" url="?curid=891574" title="Zygalski sheets">
<text>The method of Zygalski sheets was a cryptologic technique used by the Polish Cipher Bureau before and during World War II, and during the war also by British cryptologists at Bletchley Park, to decrypt messages enciphered on German Enigma machines.

The Zygalski-sheet apparatus takes its name from Polish Cipher Bureau mathematician–cryptologist Henryk Zygalski, who invented it about October 1938.

==Method==

Zygalski&#x27;s device comprised a set of 26 perforated sheets for each of the, initially, six possible sequences for inserting the three rotors into the Enigma machine&#x27;s scrambler. Each sheet related to the starting position of the left (slowest-moving) rotor.

The 26 × 26 matrix represented the 676 possible starting positions of the middle and right rotors and was duplicated horizontally and vertically: &quot;a–z, a–y&quot;. The sheets were punched with holes in the positions that would allow a &quot;female&quot; to occur.

Polish mathematician–cryptologist Marian Rejewski writes about how the perforated-sheets device was operated:

Like Rejewski&#x27;s &quot;card-catalog&quot; method, developed using his &quot;cyclometer&quot;, the Zygalski-sheet procedure was independent of the number of plugboard plug connections in the Enigma machine.

==Manufacture==

The Cipher Bureau&#x27;s manual manufacture of the sheets, which for security reasons was done by the mathematician-cryptologists themselves, using razor blades, was very time-consuming. By 15 December 1938 only a third of the job had been finished.

On that date, the Germans introduced rotors IV and V, thus increasing the labor of making the sheets tenfold, since ten times as many sheets were now needed (for the now 60 possible combinations of sequences, in an Enigma machine, of 3 rotors selected from among the now 5). 
On 25 July 1939, five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Cipher Bureau disclosed to their French and British allies, at Warsaw, their cryptologic achievements in breaking Enigma ciphers. Part of the disclosures involved Zygalski&#x27;s &quot;perforated-sheet&quot; method.

The British, at Bletchley Park, near London, England, undertook the production of two complete sets of perforated sheets. The work was done, with the aid of perforators, by a section headed by John R.F. Jeffreys. The sheets were known at Bletchley as Netz (from &quot;Netzverfahren&quot;, &quot;net method&quot;), though they were later remembered by Gordon Welchman as &quot;Jeffreys sheets&quot;; the latter term, however, referred to another catalog produced by Jeffreys&#x27; section.

The first set was completed in late December 1939. On 28 December part of the second set was delivered to the Polish cryptologists, who had by then escaped from German-overrun Poland to &quot;PC Bruno&quot; outside Paris, France. The remaining sheets were completed on 7 January 1940, and were couriered by Alan Turing to France shortly thereafter. &quot;With their help,&quot; writes Rejewski, &quot;we continued solving Enigma daily keys.&quot; The sheets were used by the Poles to make the first wartime decryption of an Enigma message, on 17 January 1940.

In May 1940, the Germans once again completely changed the procedure for enciphering message keys (with the exception of a Norwegian network). As a result, Zygalski&#x27;s sheets were of no use, though the Herivel tip could still be used.

His best-remembered hits are &quot;Memphis, Tennessee&quot;, &quot;The Crying Game&quot; (1964) and his 1965 hit &quot;Little Things&quot;, a cover version of Bobby Goldsboro&#x27;s Stateside top 40 success.

== Early life ==
Dave Berry, real name David Holgate Grundy, was born in the Woodhouse ward of Sheffield, South Yorkshire on 6 February 1941. His father, a bricklayer, was also a professional jazz drummer, and taught Dave how to play the instrument. Berry attended Woodhouse County Council School and left school at age sixteen and worked as a welder.

==Career==
=== 1960s–1980s ===
Berry&#x27;s first band that he led was called The Cruisers. A big fan of American rock and roll musician Chuck Berry, Dave Grundy changed his surname to &quot;Berry&quot;, and when he signed onto Decca Records with the Cruisers in 1963, after being spotted at a ballroom in Doncaster, his debut single was a cover of the Berry&#x27;s song &quot;Memphis, Tennessee&quot;. The song went to number nineteen in the United Kingdom in September 1963. The following year, his song &quot;Little Things&quot;, originally recorded by Bobby Goldsboro, went to number five in the UK and number one in the Netherlands. &quot;This Strange Effect&quot; (1965), written by Ray Davies, became a number one hit for him in the Netherlands and Belgium, countries where he still enjoys celebrity status, having received an award from Radio Veronica, Netherlands, for their best selling pop single of all time. B. J. Thomas&#x27;s sentimental &quot;Mama&quot; (1966) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Gimme No Lip Child&quot;, the latter is the flip to Berry&#x27;s No. 5 hit single, &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, in 1964, and covered by the Sex Pistols, were other notable recordings.
Inspired by Johnny Cash and Gene Vincent, and by “presentation, theatre, and images of rock stars”, Berry always appeared on stage dressed entirely in black. He performed a mixture of R&amp;B, rock and pop ballads and was popular in Britain, and in Continental Europe, especially Belgium and the Netherlands, but had no commercial success in the US, where he is best known for the original versions of Ray Davies&#x27; &quot;This Strange Effect&quot; and Graham Gouldman&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Take You There&quot;. Berry went to number one in countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, but never topped the charts in his home country.

His early hits name-checked his backing band the Cruisers who at that time were John Fleet (bass and piano), Roy Barber (rhythm guitar), Frank Miles (lead guitar) and Kenny Slade (drums). Berry parted with this line-up around the time of &quot;The Crying Game&quot; and recruited three more local musicians - Frank White, Johnny Riley and Pete Cliff as the second generation of Cruisers. Lead guitarist White was eventually replaced by Roy Ledger. Berry regularly used session musicians Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Big Jim Sullivan and Bobby Graham.

Berry released five singles during the 1970s: &quot;Change Our Minds&quot; (1970), &quot;Chaplin House&quot; (1970), &quot;Moving On (Turning Around)&quot; (1972), &quot;I Can Make You Cry&quot; (1973), and &quot;Night of the Fly&quot; (1977), and released his final two in the 1980s: &quot;Anyone Else but You for Me&quot; / &quot;Pebble to Pearls&quot; (1980), and a cover of The Rolling Stones song &quot;Out of Time&quot; (1982). In 1987, he released his first studio album in nineteen years titled &quot;Hostage to the Beat&quot;.

=== 1990s–present ===
The Geoff Stephens-penned song &quot;The Crying Game&quot; brought Berry&#x27;s voice to his biggest international audience in 1992, when it was used as the theme song for the film &quot;The Crying Game&quot;. In the final quarter of 2010, &quot;Little Things&quot; was used in an advertisement campaign on British television by Andrex toilet paper. Berry also regained some recognition when he was the surprise hit of the annual Alexis Korner Tribute in 1995. In 1998 &quot;This Strange Effect&quot; was covered by the Belgian band, Hooverphonic, on their album, &quot;Blue Wonder Power Milk&quot;.

In 2004, Berry released his sixth and currently latest studio album called &quot;Memphis...In The Meantime&quot;, under Blues Matters records.

In May 2009, Berry toured the UK and appeared in a cameo role in a theatrical production, &quot;The Mod Crop&quot;. In August that year, RPM Records issued a double CD anthology of Berry&#x27;s earliest recordings for Decca, entitled &quot;This Strange Effect (The Decca Sessions 1963–1966)&quot;. The package added two previously unissued tracks made in 1963 (before Berry signed with Decca) with producer Mickie Most: &quot;Easy To Cry&quot; and &quot;Tongue Twisting&quot;. Berry&#x27;s illustrated autobiography, &quot;Dave Berry - All There Is To Know&quot;, was published in 2010 by Heron Publications Ltd. It included contributions from Joe Cocker, Ray Davies, Tony Iommi, Peter Stringfellow and Bill Wyman.
A double compilation, &quot;Picture Me Gone - The Decca Sessions 1966–1974&quot;, was released in January 2011. Berry is still touring as of 2023, and is a recurring act in the Sixties Gold tour. Currently in his backing band, the Cruisers, are Daniel Martin (lead guitar since 2010), Adrian Fountain (rhythm guitar since late 2011), Dan Wright (drums, from January 2013) and Brian Wood (bass guitar, joined 24 years ago, the longest serving member of the band).

In February 2024, Berry had to cancel a few gigs after suffering from medical problems on stage. He had to finish a performance at Coal Aston village hall on 17 February early. He reportedly suffered from back pain.

== Stage presence ==
He had an unusual ambition for a pop performer trying to make a name for himself - to appear on television completely hidden by a prop. In his own words, to &quot;not appear, to stay behind something and not come out&quot;. He often hid behind the upturned collar of his leather jacket, or wrapped himself around, and effectively behind, the microphone lead. His stage act, which drew on the work of Elvis Presley and Gene Vincent, provided an inspiration for Alvin Stardust.

== Personal life ==
He currently lives in Dronfield, Derbyshire, with his wife Marthy, who comes from Amsterdam, Netherlands, who have been married for over 50 years. 

In addition to music, Berry also runs an antique business, where he mainly sells small furniture and rock memorabilia. He has opened two antique shops, one in his hometown of Sheffield, and another near his current residence in Derbyshire.

<doc id="891601" wikidata="Q336099" url="?curid=891601" title="Len Wiseman">
<text>Len Ryan Wiseman (born March 4, 1973) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. He is best known for his work on the &quot;Underworld&quot; series, &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot;, and the 2012 film &quot;Total Recall&quot;. Wiseman runs the production company Sketch Films.

==Early life and education==
Wiseman was born and raised in Fremont, California. He attended American High School and later studied film at De Anza College in Cupertino, California.

==Career==
Wiseman began his career in film as a property assistant on a number of Roland Emmerich films: &quot;Stargate&quot; (1994); &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996); and &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998). After creating advertisements for clients including Sony, he directed music videos for artists such as Megadeth, En Vogue, Static-X &amp; Mephisto Odyssey. He received a Best Art Direction nomination for Quarashi&#x27;s &quot;Stick &#x27;Em Up&quot; at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards and a Best Director nomination for Rufus Wainwright&#x27;s &quot;Across the Universe&quot; at the Music Video Production Association (MVPA) Awards.

In 2003, Wiseman co-created and directed the film &quot;Underworld&quot;. Despite receiving generally negative reviews from critics, the film did well at the box office. He directed the 2006 sequel &quot;&quot;, and produced the follow-ups &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

In 2007, he directed the fourth installment of the &quot;Die Hard&quot; series, &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot;, starring Bruce Willis, which opened to generally favorable reviews and box office success. He directed the 2012 release &quot;Total Recall&quot;, which starred Colin Farrell, Jessica Biel, and his wife Kate Beckinsale. In 2013, it was announced that Wiseman would direct a live action film version of the comic book series &quot;The Darkness&quot; (though no updates have been announced as of March 2016).

Wiseman has also directed the pilot episodes of three television series—the 2010 launch of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, the 2013 pilot of Fox&#x27;s &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, and the 2016 pilot of Fox series &quot;Lucifer&quot;. All three series were picked up for ongoing production, though Wiseman was not involved in further episodes.

It was announced on October 8, 2019 that Wiseman will direct the &quot;John Wick&quot; female-centric spin-off film titled &quot;Ballerina&quot;.

==Personal life==
Wiseman&#x27;s first marriage was to a kindergarten teacher named Dana in 1994. They divorced in 2003 after Wiseman met actor Kate Beckinsale on the set of his 2003 release &quot;Underworld&quot;. Beckinsale also ended a relationship with her partner Michael Sheen.

Wiseman and Beckinsale were married on May 9, 2004, in Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California. On November 20, 2015, it was announced that they were separating and in 2016, he filed for divorce, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences.&quot; As of November 2019, their divorce was finalized.

<doc id="891612" wikidata="Q2389341" url="?curid=891612" title="Riverview Park (Chicago)">
<text>Riverview Park was an amusement park in Chicago, Illinois, which operated from 1904 to 1967. It was located on bound on the south by Belmont Avenue, on the east by Western Avenue, on the north by Lane Tech College Prep High School, and on the west by the North Branch of the Chicago River. It was located in the Roscoe Village neighborhood of Chicago&#x27;s North Center community area.

== Founding ==
Riverview was established in 1904 by William Schmidt, on the grounds of his private skeet shooting range. The Schmidt family owned and operated the park throughout its lifetime.

&quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood, the Industrial Workers of the World leader, once spoke here to a crowd of almost 80,000 people.

== Rides and attractions ==
Riverview was famous for The Bobs wooden roller coaster. Other popular coasters were The Comet, The Silver Flash, The Fireball and the Jetstream. Aladdin&#x27;s Castle was a classic fun house with a collapsing stairway, mazes and turning barrel. Shoot the Chutes, Hades, the Rotor, Tilt-a-Whirl, Wild Mouse, the Mill on the Floss (Tunnel of Love), and Flying Turns were just a few of the many classic rides. &quot;The Pair-O-Chutes at Riverview Park&#x27;ll shake us up all day&quot; is a line from the Beach Boys&#x27; song &quot;Amusement Parks U.S.A.&quot; from their 1965 album, &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot;. There were over 120 rides in the park.

==Racism and closing==
Riverview closed in 1967. Urban myths endure, describing the park&#x27;s &quot;seedy&quot; atmosphere in the 1960s, as it coincidentally became more integrated. Contemporaneous articles in black publications, such as the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;, described black patrons being subject to both latent and overt racism; the most overt being a longstanding attraction (not owned by Riverview) but by an outside concessionaire renting space from the park. It was unofficially called &quot;Dunk the Nigger&quot;, but officially named &quot;African Dip&quot; and later truncated to simply &quot;Dip&quot;, which the NAACP along with newspaper columnist Mike Royko successfully lobbied to shut down in the 1950s.

According to Victoria Wolcott, author of 2012 book &quot;Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters&quot;

Chuck Wlodarczyk, author of &quot;Riverview Gone But Not Forgotten&quot;, once performed shows about the park and reported people often approached him afterwards to report hearsay of someone raped in the park restrooms by a black man, however no actual record of these crimes exist. A &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article from late 1967 also blames violence for the park&#x27;s closure, however Wolcott says there is little evidence of increased violence at the park.

Ultimately, white flight contributed to financial decline at the park, making the land upon which Riverview was built far more valuable than the park itself. The Schmidt family sold to developers and later stated a newspaper&#x27;s reported estimated sale price of $6.8 million ($ in ) was too low.

The grounds became home to Riverview Plaza shopping center, the Chicago Police Area 3 Detective Division, DePaul College Prep High School, dental equipment manufacturer Hu-Friedy Manufacturing, and Richard Clark Park of the Chicago Park District. The south end of Clark Park has a wooded area where many of the Riverview Park foundations remain visible, and it is used as a bicycle dirt jump and pump track park maintained by the Chicago Area Mountain Bikers. A sculpture entitled &quot;Riverview&quot; by local artist Jerry Peart stands in front of the police station.

== Memorabilia ==
Many items from Riverview, as well as paintings portraying the park, were on display at Riverview Tavern, located on the corner of West Roscoe Street and Damen Avenue from 2005 to 2018. The Riverview Carousel continues to operate at Six Flags Over Georgia. It was the only ride to be saved.

== Bally and Williams tie-ins ==
The Bally Manufacturing Corporation 1972 pinball machine &quot;Fireball&quot; was named after the park&#x27;s Fireball roller coaster. Also, Bally&#x27;s Aladdin&#x27;s Castle amusement arcade division was renamed from Carousel Time to honor the Riverview Park Aladdin&#x27;s Castle funhouse. Bally&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&#x27;s Castle&quot; pinball machine was also inspired by the same funhouse at Riverview. The 1979 Williams Electronics&#x27; pinball game &quot;Flash&quot; and their 1985 &quot;Comet&quot; were named after the park&#x27;s roller coasters with these names. Williams&#x27; 1990 amusement park themed pinball machine FunHouse was also heavily inspired by Riverview Park. Its Riverview Carousel is also depicted on the machine&#x27;s backglass.

Bally Manufacturing and Williams Electronics had their headquarters and primary manufacturing facilities just west of Riverview Park during the later years of the park&#x27;s operating life.

<doc id="891613" wikidata="Q167906" url="?curid=891613" title="Zazie dans le Métro (novel)">
<text>(translated as both Zazie in the Metro and Zazie) is a French novel written in 1959 by Raymond Queneau, and his first major success.

==Plot ==
Zazie, a foul-mouthed provincial girl is dropped off at a Paris railway station to spend a weekend with her uncle Gabriel while her mother Jeanne Lalochère spends time with her lover. Zazie tells Gabriel that she wants to visit the Paris Métro, but Gabriel tells her she cannot as it is closed due to a strike. Throughout the novel, Zazie asks Gabriel if he is a &quot;hormosessuel&quot; (homosexual), which he vigorously denies being. The two are driven off to Gabriel&#x27;s apartment by Gabriel&#x27;s friend Charles, a taxi driver. Upon arriving, Zazie encounters Turandot, the manager of &quot;La Cave&quot;, a restaurant under Gabriel&#x27;s apartment, his pet parrot Laverdure, and Gabriel&#x27;s wife Marceline.

The following day, Zazie leaves the apartment while Gabriel is sleeping to visit the subway by herself. She encounters a strange man implied to be a paedophile (or &quot;satyr&quot;) who takes her to a flea market and buys her blue jeans. Gabriel learns from Gridoux, a cobbler and neighbour that she ran away after Turandot confronted her for running off. Zazie brings the man back to the apartment, and he identifies himself as &quot;Pédro-Surplus&quot; and accuses Zazie of stealing the jeans from him. When the man begins talking to Marceline, Gabriel kicks him out of the apartment. While serving food to Gridoux, Mado P&#x27;tits-Pieds, a waitress at &quot;La Cave&quot; tells him about her romantic interest in Charles. 

Gabriel, Zazie and Charles then visit the Eiffel Tower. Gabriel soon goes down to the bottom due to vertigo. Charles then joins him without Zazie and tells him that he will drive home without them. When Zazie reunites with Gabriel, they encounter a group of foreign tourists guided by Fédor Balanovitch, who recognises Gabriel as a drag dancer. The two are briefly pulled into the tour bus during a stampede of tourists, and jump off at a red light whereupon they encounter the aristocratic Widow Mouaque. When Gabriel is pulled into a car by tourists and kidnapped, a police officer named Trouscaillon comes to help Zazie and the Widow Mouaque. With his help, they find Gabriel, who invites Fédor Balanovitch&#x27;s tourists to see his drag show.

Later, after Mado and Charles agree to get married, Gabriel also invites them, along with Gridoux and Turandot to watch his drag show with Zazie and the Widow Mouaque. As they are watching the show along with Laverdure and the tourists, a man identifying himself as &quot;Bertin Poirée&quot; enters Gabriel&#x27;s apartment. He reveals to Marceline that he was also Trouscaillon and that he was also the satyr Zazie brought home earlier in the day. He attempts to seduce Marceline, but she flees from the apartment.

After the show, Charles and Mado drive home, and the tourists are driven back to their hotel by Fédor Balanovitch, while Gabriel, Zazie, Mouaque, Turandot, Gridoux and Laverdure encounter Trouscaillon again and identify him as the satyr from earlier in the morning. Trouscaillon is suddenly arrested for impersonating a police officer, breaking the widow&#x27;s heart as she has fallen in love with him. Gabriel invites her to have onion soup with them to feel better.

While at the restaurant, Zazie falls asleep, and a large brawl erupts between the customers and the restaurant&#x27;s staff. After Gabriel wins the fight, they see a large battalion of soldiers outside the restaurant, led by the satyr. When the Widow Mouaque exits the restaurant to approach him, she is killed in a hail of bullets. The satyr identifies himself now as &quot;Aroun Arachide&quot; and attempts to attack Gabriel and his friends with his soldiers, but they escape through a lift into the subway. The elevator operator tells them that the subway is now working again and they can use it to return home, and takes the sleeping Zazie with him, as he also has her suitcase. The next day, Jeanne Lalochère is reunited with Zazie at the train station by a man named Marcel. Zazie tells her mother that she did not see the subway during her stay in Paris but instead got older. Marcel is implied to be Marceline, leaving the question of Gabriel&#x27;s sexual orientation ambiguous.

==Language==
&quot;Zazie&quot; explores colloquial language as opposed to &quot;standard&quot; written French; Queneau referred to the language spoken by Zazie and the other characters as &quot;neo-French&quot;. It is marked by colloquial diction and slang, by phonetic spelling, and by &quot;the morpho-syntax typical of spoken French&quot;. For instance, the first word of the book, the neologism &quot;Doukipudonktan&quot;, is a phonetic transcription of &quot;D&#x27;où (est-ce) qu&#x27;il pue donc tant ?&quot; (&quot;From where does he/do they/does it stink so much?&quot;). In the English version of the novel, this is rendered as &quot;Holifart watastink&quot;; in the movie version the English subtitle reads &quot;Whozit who stinks?&quot;

According to a 1959 article from &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;to speak Zazie&quot; was all the rage in France.

==Adaptations==
In 1960 the book was adapted by Louis Malle into a film of the same name, starring Catherine Demongeot as Zazie and Philippe Noiret as Gabriel. In the film, Zazie is younger than in the book (where her mother is worried about Zazie&#x27;s virginity). The book was also adapted for theatre and published as a comic book as well.

<text>Stelco Holdings Inc. (known as U.S. Steel Canada from 2007 to 2016) is a Canadian steel company based in Hamilton, Ontario. Stelco was founded in 1910 by the amalgamation of several smaller firms. It continued on for almost 100 years until it filed for bankruptcy in 2007 and was bought by U.S. Steel. In 2016, the company was sold to Bedrock Industries of the United States, which took the company public via a second IPO. The company made its debut on the Toronto Stock Exchange on November 3, 2017. In 2024, American steel manufacturer Cleveland-Cliffs acquired Stelco for approximately US$2.5 billion.

The Hamilton plant has not produced steel since 2011, but its coke ovens and cold rolling finishing works remain in operation. The company employs about 750 people in the Hamilton plant and 1,400 in Nanticoke, Ontario at its greenfield facility Stelco Lake Erie Works.

==History==
The Steel Company of Canada was established in 1910. It was founded after the merging of the Hamilton Steel and Iron Company (1900) with the Canada Screw Company (1866), Montreal Rolling Mills (1868), the Dominion Wire Manufacturing Company (1883) and the Canada Bolt and Nut Company. Charles S. Wilcox, president of the Hamilton Steel and Iron Company at the time of the consolidation, was appointed the first president of Stelco. He held the position until 1916, continuing on with the company as chairman of the board until his death in 1938.

Several union drives at the plant were unsuccessful until the founding strike of Local 1005 of the United Steelworkers of America in 1946.

In 2004, Stelco had financial difficulties and went under court-ordered protection from its creditors, including the Deutsche Bank. Stelco exited Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangements Act (CCAA) protection on March 31, 2006. Several non-core operations were divested, including Stelwire, Norambar (formerly Stelco McMaster Works) and Welland Pipe. The CCAA exit has seen the remaining operations restructured into nine separate operating businesses held by the corporate entity of Stelco.

On August 27, 2007, U.S. Steel purchased Stelco for $1.9 billion – $1.1 billion in cash and assuming $800 million in debt. The company was renamed Hamilton Works – US Steel Canada. The deal closed on October 31, 2007. The company was renamed U.S. Steel Canada Inc., and its shares were delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In an effort to streamline operations, U.S. Steel announced on March 3, 2009, that it would be temporarily shutting down its Hamilton plant and most of its Lake Erie plant, putting more than 2,000 people out of work. This announcement came four months after U.S. Steel laid off 700 employees at the Hamilton plant when it shut down its blast furnace.

Market conditions and declining customer orders prompted U.S. Steel to shut down the Hamilton Works on October 1, 2010. 100 jobs were restored when the German Max Aicher steel company bought two steel mills from US Steel and opened them as &quot;Max Aicher North America.&quot; More jobs are expected to be created when the mills are in full production. The Hamilton steel-making and iron-making operations were permanently closed on December 31, 2013.

On September 16, 2014, U.S. Steel Canada announced that it would apply for court protection from its creditors. US Steel then stated that it intended to sell all of its remaining operations in Hamilton in the next two months.

U.S. Steel Canada was severed from U.S. Steel Corporation in 2015 after it entered Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act protection in 2014. In November 2016, a deal was struck to sell U.S. Steel Canada to Bedrock Industries.

On December 2, 2016, the company took the &quot;Stelco&quot; name again. In 2017, an initial public offering raised for the company.

Portions of the Stelco&#x27;s archives are held at Library and Archives Canada, Brock University, and the Canadian Centre for Architecture. In January 2021 Stelco added pig iron production capability to its Lake Erie blast furnace.

Stelco purchased a 40% stake in the Hamilton Tiger-Cats professional football team in January 2022.

In July 2024, it was publicly announced that Cleveland-Cliffs, an American steel manufacturer, was acquiring Stelco for approximately US$2.5 billion. The purchase was completed four months later.

==Environmental impact==

Steelmaking in Canada has long been associated with pollution. For example, in 1989, Stelco and Dofasco were listed among the &quot;dirty dozen&quot; polluters in Ontario:

Since Stelco ceased steelmaking in 2011, it received less media attention regarding pollution.

==Operations==
The company operates the main Hilton Works in Hamilton, named after the late company president Hugh Hilton, and the Lake Erie Works in Nanticoke on Lake Erie. Until the 2006 restructuring, Stelco&#x27;s operations also included Stelco McMaster Works in Contrecœur, Quebec and Stelwire (both acquired by ArcelorMittal in 2006 and now operates as ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada – Hamilton-East Complex and Mittal Canada Contrecoeur-Ouest Inc.). The Nanticoke plant was notable because it is of a relatively newer design, and uses far less water.

Stelco Tower, now known as 100 King Street West and associated with Lloyd D. Jackson Square, is an office building in downtown Hamilton where the company&#x27;s headquarters had been located since the 1970s, but has been completely vacated by Stelco. Stelco&#x27;s current head office is co-located with their Hamilton Works location at 386 Wilcox Street in Hamilton.

<doc id="891623" wikidata="Q2911967" url="?curid=891623" title="Ella Enchanted">
<text>Ella Enchanted is a fantasy novel written by Gail Carson Levine and published in 1997. The story is a retelling of &quot;Cinderella&quot; featuring various mythical creatures including fairies, elves, ogres, gnomes, and giants. 

The book won a Newbery Honor in 1998. In 2006, Levine went on to write &quot;Fairest&quot;, a retelling of the story of Snow White, set in the same world as &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot;. In 2018, Levine published &quot;Ogre Enchanted&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot;.

On April 9, 2004, a movie that is loosely based on the novel was released. It was directed by Tommy O&#x27;Haver and stars Anne Hathaway and Hugh Dancy as Ella and Prince Charmont, respectively. The film received mostly mixed reviews, and was heavily criticized for its changes to the source material and addition of new characters. Levine stated that the film is &quot;so different from the book that it&#x27;s hard to compare them&quot; and suggested &quot;regarding the movie as a separate creative act&quot;.

==Summary==

When Ella was just a baby, the fairy Lucinda bestowed the gift of obedience on her. The &quot;gift&quot; is in fact a terrible curse, forcing Ella to obey anyone who gives her an order.

When Ella is around fourteen, her mother dies. Her cook Mandy reveals herself to be her Fairy godmother. She is given two gifts by Mandy: a necklace from her mother and a magic book. At her mother&#x27;s funeral, Ella meets the kingdom&#x27;s prince, Char, who comforts her. At the wake, she is introduced to Dame Olga and her terrible daughters, Hattie and illiterate Olive - but at the time, feels no special significance to this encounter.

Her father, Peter, decides to send her to finishing school with the two mean sisters. Before leaving she visits her favorite places, where she meets Char again and they bond. At school, Hattie eventually discovers that Ella does whatever she is told and uses this for her own gain. She takes Ella&#x27;s mother&#x27;s necklace, then deprives Ella of food and orders her to end her friendship with her best friend Areida. Ella cannot stand this and sets out to find Lucinda so that she can reverse the spell. In her magic book, she saw that her father is about to attend a giant&#x27;s wedding and she assumes that Lucinda - who likes to come uninvited to weddings - might be there.

Ella comes upon the kingdom of Elves, who offer a warm welcome. The next morning, she awakens surrounded by ogres who plan on devouring her. She is given the command not to run away, so she is trapped, and stays up all night practicing Ogrese in hopes of using on the ogres their own weapon of hypnotic speech. It works and she talks them back to sleep, just in time for Char and his soldiers to apprehend them. One of his men is sent to escort Ella.

Ella learns that ungrateful recipients of Lucinda&#x27;s gifts often end up as squirrels and decides to use an alias when talking to her. Ella tells her she desires more mettle for she is too obedient, but Lucinda tells Ella to be happy and Ella is forced to feel happy because of her &#x27;gift&#x27;.

Ella learns from her father that he&#x27;s lost everything so he must marry Dame Olga. At the wedding, Lucinda gifts the bride and groom eternal love. On the ride to Olga&#x27;s house, Peter reveals that he&#x27;s broke. Olga is livid, but due to Lucinda&#x27;s gift, she is unable to stay angry at him. Instead she begins to transfer all of her hatred to Ella. Char comes to visit Ella but Hattie orders her to stay in her room. This continues until Char leaves for his trip. They start communicating via letters, which Ella has him address to Mandy so as not to arouse suspicion from her new step-family. When Peter leaves for work, Hattie reveals Ella&#x27;s curse and Olga makes Ella work as a servant in the house.

After months of communicating with each other, Ella and Char fall in love and Char wishes for her to be his queen. Ella realizes her curse could be very dangerous for him since he will one day be king. She decides they could never be together and writes a letter addressed from Hattie to mislead him into thinking she has run off with a rich earl. Mandy calls upon Lucinda and confronts her about the disastrous consequences of her gifts. Lucinda disbelieves her, but Mandy convinces her to try it for herself, living for three months as a squirrel and three months being obedient.

During the next six months, Ella continues to endure the torment of her step-family. She learns that Char will be returning soon and three royal balls will be held. Lucinda returns disheveled and remorseful about all the suffering she has caused. Ella begs her to remove her curse, now that she knows how terrible it truly is, but Lucinda vows that she will no longer perform acts of big magic. Lucinda tells Ella she will have to find a way to do it herself.

When Prince Char returns from his travels, Ella goes to the balls in disguise, with the help of Mandy and Lucinda. At the first ball, she dances with Char, who still wants to be with Ella after a chance meeting with Areida made him question the letter he received. On the third night, he introduces her to his parents and dances only with her. Hattie is jealous and unmasks Ella, causing her to flee and lose one of her glass slippers. Char finds the slipper and goes to her home. He asks her to tell him if she loves him, which she does. He then tells her to marry him - which is an order which her curse compels her to obey.

After an internal struggle Ella bursts out with &quot;No, I will not marry you! No one can force me!&quot; after which she hugs and kisses Char. Her love and care for Char have broken Lucinda&#x27;s spell. Now, Ella can explain everything to the confused Char, who again asks her to marry him - which she is now free and happy to accept.

Unlike in the original Cinderella story, Ella takes no revenge on her stepmother and stepsisters beyond not inviting them to the royal wedding. Char&#x27;s royal parents warmly accept Ella in the family. Ella and Areida rekindle their friendship. Mandy becomes the castle cook and fairy godmother to Char and Ella&#x27;s future children. Ella&#x27;s first person narrative ends with her telling the reader that &quot;So we still live in love and laughter&quot;.

==Analysis and publication history==
While all the familiar plot elements of the Cinderella story are still present in this retelling, they are given a different significance. In particular, in Levine&#x27;s version Cinderella/Ella and the Prince have known each other all along and had already long since fallen in love before the balls, but are unable to realize their love until the end of the story. As noted by Levine, the plot element of Ella being cursed with obedience fills a logical flaw in the original Cinderella story, explaining why she had to obey her stepmother and stepsisters.

The book was revised in 2011. 

In 2012, it was ranked number 85 on a list of the top 100 children&#x27;s novels published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

The District was created on September 28, 1850, following the passage of the California Statehood Act on September 9, 1850. The state was divided into a Northern and Southern district. The Judicial Circuits Act of 1866 abolished the Northern and Southern districts, re-organizing California as a single circuit district. On August 5, 1886 the Southern district was re-established, following the division of the state into Northern and Southern districts. The district was further divided on March 18, 1966 with the creation of the Central and Eastern districts.

The United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Southern District of California represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. the acting United States attorney is Andrew R. Haden.

== Organization of the court ==

The United States District Court for the Southern District of California is one of four federal district courts in California. Court for the District is held at El Centro and the Edward J. Schwartz U.S. Courthouse and U.S. Courthouse Annex in San Diego. The district comprises Imperial and San Diego counties.
