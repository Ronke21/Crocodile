<text>Asphaltite (also known as uintahite, asphaltum,gilsonite or oil sands) is a naturally occurring soluble solid hydrocarbon, a form of asphalt (or bitumen) with a relatively high melting temperature. Its large-scale production occurs in the Uintah Basin of Utah and Colorado, United States. Although the substance has been historically mined in the Uintah Basin, resources are being discovered and mined more recently in other countries such as Colombia and Iran. Asphaltite is mined in underground shafts and resembles shiny black obsidian.
Discovered in the 1860s, it was first marketed as a lacquer, electrical insulator, and waterproofing compound approximately 25 years later by Samuel H. Gilson.

==History==
Asphaltite was discovered in the 1860s. By 1888 Samuel H. Gilson had started a company to mine the substance, but soon discovered the vein was on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. Under great political pressure Congress removed some from the reservation on May 24, 1888 to allow mining to proceed legally. Asphaltite mining became the first large commercial enterprise in the Uintah Basin, causing most of its early population growth.

Mining asphaltite during World War II was manual, using a six-pound pick, then shoveling the ore into 200 pound sacks, which were sewn by hand. 

Gilsonite-brand uintahite&#x27;s earliest applications included paints for buggies and emulsions for beer-vat lining. It was used by Ford Motor Company as a principal component of the japan black lacquer used on most of the Ford Model T cars.

==Composition==
Asphaltite is categorized as a soluble material in oil solutions such as carbon disulphide or TCE (trichloroethylene). A major component of asphaltite is carbon; it also contains several other elements including nitrogen and sulfur and some volatile compounds.

==Reserves and uses==
Asphaltite reserves are distributed globally, especially within basins. It has also been found on the dwarf planet Ceres and is predicted to exist on the Martian moon Phobos.

Asphaltite is used in more than 160 products, primarily in dark-colored printing inks and paints, oil well drilling muds and cements, asphalt modifiers, foundry sand additives, and a wide variety of chemical products. The trademark &quot;Gilsonite&quot;, registered in 1921, belongs to the American Gilsonite Company which filed for bankruptcy in October 2016 and, after accepting re-organization, emerged in January 2017. 

Asphaltite is a common modifier for bitumen in asphalt. Blending asphaltite with bitumen increases the strength and resistance of pavements. This application is practised in countries such as China, India and Iran. Known as &quot;asfaltit&quot; in Turkish, it is burnt in Şırnak Silopi power station, a coal fired power station in Turkey.

<doc id="879043" wikidata="Q7773452" url="?curid=879043" title="The Wapshot Chronicle">
<text>The Wapshot Chronicle is the debut novel by American author John Cheever about an eccentric family that lives in a Massachusetts fishing village. Published in 1957, it won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction in 1958,
and was followed by a sequel, &quot;The Wapshot Scandal&quot;, published in 1964.

&quot;The Wapshot Chronicle&quot; is the sometimes-humorous story of Leander Wapshot, his eccentric Cousin Honora, and his sons, Moses and Coverly, as they all deal with life. The story is somewhat autobiographical, particularly regarding the character of Coverly, who, like Cheever, experiences feelings of bisexuality.

The novel was Cheever&#x27;s first, though he had previously written short stories. It was also the first novel selected for the Book of the Month Club to include the word &quot;fuck&quot; in the narrative.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Wapshot Chronicle&quot; 63rd on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

== Adaptations ==

In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of &quot;The Wapshot Chronicle&quot;, narrated by Joe Barrett, as part of its &quot;Modern Vanguard&quot; line of audiobooks.

<text>Pionerskaya Pravda (Пионе́рская пра́вда) is an all-Russian newspaper. Initially it was an all-Union newspaper of the Soviet Union. Its name may be translated as &quot;Truth for Young Pioneers&quot;.

== History ==
The newspaper was founded March 6, 1925 in Moscow and published under the name &quot;School Pravda&quot; and later under &quot;Pioneer Truth&quot;. Nikolai Bukharin was the first editor of the newspaper. Different poets and artists, like Mikhail Zoshchenko, Ilya Ilf, Evgeny Petrov and Vladimir Mayakovsky, cooperated with the newspaper. On March 6, 1927, the newspaper became part of the Central and Moscow Committees of the All-Union Young Communist League. From 1958, it formed part of the Central Committee of the All-Union Young Communist League and the Central Council of the All-Union Pioneers&#x27; Organization. From February 4, 1928 a newspaper was published twice a week, and since October 3, 1928 it has been published three times a week.

The newspaper became a weekly printed body of the Moscow RKSM Committee. In the 1970s and 1980s its circulation approached 10,000,000 (almost every child in the Soviet Union had a subscription). Its title followed the name of the main Soviet newspaper of the time, &quot;Pravda&quot;, as did multiple other newspapers. In 1991, following the collapse of the USSR, the newspaper was reorganized and became a national newspaper for children and adolescents.

The newspaper continues to exist, but now it is not associated with Young Pioneers, and the circulation is greatly reduced.

<doc id="879052" wikidata="Q3847105" url="?curid=879052" title="Ong Iok-tek">
<text>Ong Iok-tek (Ikutoku Ō; /; POJ: Ông Io̍k-tek; Hepburn:&quot;Ō Ikutoku:&quot; ; 30 January 1924–9 September 1985) was a Taiwanese scholar and early leader of the Taiwan independence movement. He is considered to be an authority on the Southern Min language family and the Taiwanese language.

He was born in Tainan Prefecture (modern-day Tainan), during Japanese rule, of a prominent family. He attended Tokyo Imperial University in 1943 but the ongoing World War II compelled him to return to Taiwan after a year. Following the war and handover of Taiwan he took a critical attitude toward the Kuomintang, one accentuated by the killing of his brother, , a Tokyo-educated prosecutor, in the February 28 Incident. His own life threatened by the new regime, he fled to Japan in 1949 and spent the rest of his life there in addition to various other places.

He resumed his studies in May 1950, and after completing his Ph.D. in 1969 at the University of Tokyo, he later taught Taiwanese at Meiji University in 1974.

He also played a leading role in garnering support for the Taiwan independence movement within Japan. As a student he had joined Thomas Liao&#x27;s but became dissatisfied with it after two years. He established the in 1960 and published the organization&#x27;s influential monthly &quot;Taiwan Seinen&quot; in Japanese (later for a time in Chinese) and &quot;Formosan Quarterly&quot; in English. The Taiwan Youth Association later changed its name to the Taiwan Youth Independence League. In the 1970s he was a leader in the campaign to secure compensation for the 200,000 Taiwanese who had served as soldiers under the Imperial Japanese military. In 1982 he served as a committee member of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs.

Ong argued that Han people were a folk, and not a nation, and that Hakka and Hoklos are smaller folks within the Han. Ong further argued that after Japan modernized Taiwan, the Taiwanese nation was established with Taiwan being pre-national as the Japanese ruled it, and that modern capitalism creates a nation. Ong argued that Taiwanese people can become a nation within the state container if Taiwan becomes an independent state. Shaojin Chai, author of &quot;Taiwanese Nationalism: Situation Dependency and Elite Games&quot;, said that Ong&#x27;s view of a nation is that it is &quot;the modern construction of state&quot; and that his concept &quot;responded to the modernity of nationalism&quot;. Chai added that &quot;Ong&#x27;s Taiwanese nationalism theory indicates that nationalism precedes nation, and without a state, there could be no nation.&quot; Chai added that Ong and Thomas Liao were both perceived as Mainlanders in Taiwan and Chinese people in Mainland China, and hence were viewed as oppressors of Taiwanese people and non-Taiwanese. Chai explained that Ong placed emphasis on the &quot;political construction&quot; while Liao placed emphasis on &quot;primordial criteria&quot;.

In regards to reception to Ong&#x27;s ideas, Chai said that Taiwanese people at the time of Ong&#x27;s active period did believe they were a folk of Han people, even though they did have a strong provincial identity. Chai added that &quot;Ong&#x27;s argument was especially convincing to Holos, but it is problematic when applied to indigenous peoples. Following his rationale, the different indigenous tribes also have to right to build their state to form their own nations.&quot;

<doc id="879062" wikidata="Q1208322" url="?curid=879062" title="Kevin Youkilis">
<text>Kevin Edmund Youkilis (; born March 15, 1979), nicknamed &quot;Youk&quot; , is an American former professional baseball first baseman and third baseman, who primarily played for the Boston Red Sox. A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, he was drafted by the Red Sox in 2001, after playing college baseball at the University of Cincinnati. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, and New York Yankees. He later served as a special assistant to the Chicago Cubs and former Red Sox GM Theo Epstein.

Known for his ability to get on base, while he was still a minor leaguer, Youkilis was nicknamed &quot;Euclis: The Greek God of Walks&quot; in the best-selling book, &quot;&quot;. A Gold Glove Award-winning first baseman, he once held baseball&#x27;s record for most consecutive errorless games at first base (later broken by Casey Kotchman). He is also a three-time MLB All-Star, two-time World Series Champion, and winner of the 2008 Hank Aaron Award.

An intense performer on the playing field, Youkilis was known for his scrappiness, grittiness, dirt-stained jerseys, home-plate collisions, and his strange batting stance. He excelled despite a physique that led many observers to underestimate his athletic ability. He was called &quot;roly-poly&quot; by his high school coach, &quot;pudgy&quot; by his college coach, a &quot;fat kid&quot; by general manager Billy Beane, and a &quot;thicker-bodied guy&quot; by the Red Sox scout who recruited him. As Jackie MacMullan wrote for the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;: &quot;He does not look like an MVP candidate; more a refrigerator repairman, a butcher, the man selling hammers behind the counter at the True Value hardware store.&quot; Youkilis was named to the &quot;Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, ranking No. 36 on the list in 2009, No. 38 in 2010, and No. 35 in 2011.

Youkilis was the hitting coach for Team Israel, under manager Ian Kinsler, when it competed in the 2023 World Baseball Classic in Miami, Florida.

In 2021, Youkilis was a pregame and postgame analyst for Red Sox broadcasts on NESN. Starting in 2022, he became a color commentator during Red Sox games, working alongside Red Sox play-by-play announcer Dave O&#x27;Brien.

==Background and early life==
Youkilis&#x27; Jewish great-great-great-grandfather, a native of 19th-century Romania, moved to Greece at the age of 16 to avoid conscription at the hands of the notoriously anti-Semitic Cossacks. He became homesick, however, and returned to Romania after a couple of years, although he changed his surname from &quot;Weiner&quot; to &quot;Youkilis&quot; to avoid conscription and imprisonment.

Youkilis was born in Cincinnati, the son of Carolyn (née Weekley) and Mike Youkilis, a wholesale jeweler. His father was born to a Jewish family, while his mother, a native of West Virginia, converted to Judaism after her marriage. Youkilis has described his father as a &quot;well-known third baseman in the Jewish Community Center fast-pitch softball league.&quot;

Youkilis is Jewish and had a bar mitzvah at a Conservative synagogue. At the age of 15, he had an uncredited one-line speaking role in the romantic comedy film &quot;Milk Money&quot;.

He attended Sycamore High School (class of 1997) in the northeastern suburbs of Cincinnati, where he played third base, shortstop, first base, and the outfield for the school team (the Aviators) and Nuckols Baseball, which also had Aaron Cook as a pitcher, and won the Amateur Athletic Union National Championship in 1994. He was a four-year letter winner, a two-time All-Greater Miami Conference (1996 and 1997) and All-City (1996 and 1997) player, and All-State his senior season as he led the team with a .475 batting average and finished second all time in home runs. While at Sycamore High School, he was the only player to homer off his future Red Sox teammate Aaron Cook.

Youkilis was inducted into the Sycamore Athletic Hall of Fame in 2008. In 2017, the school honored him by retiring his jersey number, number 13.

==College==
When he graduated from high school in 1997, Youkilis was and weighed about . He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati —an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis&#x27; longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. &quot;I looked at him and said, Well, we need somebody&quot;, said Cleary. &quot;I&#x27;d love to tell you I saw something no one else did, but he was just better than what we had.&quot;

While majoring in finance, Youkilis excelled as a player for the Cincinnati Bearcats from 1998 to 2001. &quot;I take no credit&quot;, said Cleary. &quot;He coaches himself. He knows his swing. Any time we said anything to him, he was already a step ahead. He made the adjustments he had to make. I just think he&#x27;s a really smart guy who had a great feel for what he had to do.&quot; In his junior year in 2000, he was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season, and drawing 63 walks in 60 games; still, he went undrafted. &quot;He was kind of a square-shaped body, a guy [who] in a uniform didn&#x27;t look all that athletic&quot;, Cleary said. &quot;He wasn&#x27;t a tall, prospect-y looking guy. He looked chubby in a uniform. … It wasn&#x27;t fat. He was strong. [But] I think the body did scare some people away.&quot;

During the period between his junior and senior years, he played in the Cape Cod League for the Bourne Braves, where he was named a league all-star, and finished sixth in the league in batting average. In his senior year in 2001, he repeated as second-team All-American. He set UC career records for home runs (56), walks (206), slugging percentage (.627), and on-base percentage (.499) with a batting average of .366. &quot;He had a great eye … he hardly ever struck out looking&quot;, said Brad Meador, UC&#x27;s associate head coach. &quot;When he did, you knew the ump missed the call.&quot; Cleary, noting how driven Youkilis was to succeed, told his father: &quot;Your son&#x27;s going to be a millionaire some day. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in baseball, but he&#x27;s going to make some money one of these days.&quot;

Yet, when asked what he liked about Youkilis, former Boston scout Matt Haas said: &quot;At first glance, not a lot. He was unorthodox. He had an extreme crouch—his thighs were almost parallel to the ground. And he was heavier than he is now. But the more I watched him, the more I just thought, &#x27;Throw the tools out the window. This guy can play baseball.&#x27;&quot;

In 2001, at Haas&#x27; urging, the Boston Red Sox drafted Youkilis in the eighth round (243rd overall), to the chagrin of Billy Beane, who had hoped that he would be able to draft him in a later round. ESPN reported that: &quot;questions about his defense and power with wood kept him out of the top part of the draft.&quot; He signed for a mere $12,000 signing bonus. &quot;Kevin would have played for a six-pack of beer&quot;, his father said.

&quot;Teams didn’t appreciate performance as much then as they do now&quot;, observed Red Sox VP of Player Personnel Ben Cherington eight years later. &quot;His college performance was off the charts. If he [were] in the draft this year, he&#x27;d be at least a sandwich pick, if not a first rounder. His performance was that good, in college and on the Cape. Now, teams appreciate what that means. There&#x27;s no way he’d last that long now.&quot;

In 2007, he was inducted into the University of Cincinnati James P. Kelly Athletics Hall Of Fame. In 2015, the University of Cincinnati retired his No. 36 jersey number.

In 2018, Youkilis took his final exams and graduated the University of Cincinnati with a business degree.

In 2019, he was named to the inaugural Conference USA Hall of Fame class.

==Minor leagues (2001–2004)==
In 2001, Youkilis made his professional debut as a third baseman with the Lowell Spinners, a Short-Season A Class franchise in the New York–Penn League. He went on to lead the league with a .512 OBP, 52 runs, and 70 walks (against just 28 strikeouts), while hitting for a .317 batting average (third in the league) in 59 games. He also reached base safely by hit or walk in 46 consecutive games (the third-longest such streak in the minor leagues). Peter Gammons wrote that August: &quot;Remember this name: Kevin Youkilis, who resembles Steve Balboni.&quot; Honored by the Spinners with a &quot;Youkilis bobblehead night&quot;, Youkilis said: &quot;It&#x27;s an honor—you know you&#x27;ve made it when you get a bobblehead of yourself.&quot; Promoted from Lowell towards the end of the season, he played five games with the Augusta GreenJackets of the South Atlantic League, a Low-A Class league. He was named Red Sox Minor League Player of the Year.

In 2002, Youkilis appeared in 15 games for Augusta, in 76 games for the Sarasota Sox (40 of them at first base), and in 44 games for the Trenton Thunder. He hit .310, with eight home runs and 80 RBI for the year, and he was voted Trenton&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Year.&quot; His .436 on-base percentage was the fifth-highest in the minors in 2002, and his 80 walks were seventh-most. In recognition of his performance, the Boston Red Sox named Youkilis their 2002 Minor League Player of the Year.

After the 2002 season, Boston&#x27;s then-assistant general manager, Theo Epstein, sent Youkilis to the Athletes&#x27; Performance Institute in Tempe, Arizona, where he engaged in an intensive six-week training regimen. Youkilis then moved his off-season home to Arizona, and attended the Institute in the 2004–08 off seasons as well.

In 2003, Youkilis started the season with the Portland Sea Dogs. In 94 games, he led the Eastern League with a .487 on-base percentage (best all-time for the team through 2007), and was third in the league with a .327 batting average (second-best all-time for the team through 2007). 86 walks (against just 40 strikeouts), and a .953 OPS, and tied for third with 16 hit by pitch. Later, he earned a spot on the Eastern League All-Star team, the &quot;Baseball America&quot; AA All-Star team, and on the U.S. roster for the 2003 All-Star Futures Game. After Portland, Youkilis moved up to play for the Pawtucket Red Sox, the Boston Red Sox Class-AAA franchise. During his time with Pawtucket, Youkilis managed to complete a streak he started while in Portland: he reached base in 71 consecutive games, tying future teammate Kevin Millar&#x27;s minor-league record for consecutive games reaching base. His 104 walks were the third-highest number recorded in the minors in 2003. Asked, however, about the focus in position-playing baseball on five-tool players, Youkilis quipped, &quot;I don&#x27;t even know if I have a tool.&quot;

Writing for ESPN, John Sickels evaluated him as follows in mid-2003:Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is adept at working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and breaking pitches. Youkilis&#x27; swing is tailored for the line drive, and he may never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn&#x27;t kill the defense at third base, but he doesn&#x27;t help it much, either, and is likely to end up at first base down the road.Youkilis spent the 2003–04 winter in Mexico, playing for Navojoa of the Mexican Pacific League. In 2004, he appeared in 32 games for Pawtucket, hitting .258 with three home runs, and a .347 on-base percentage, before being called up to the Red Sox on May 15.

In his minor league career through 2005, he batted .299 with a .442 OBP while playing 340 games at third base, 59 at first base, and two at second base.

==Major leagues (2004–2014)==
===Boston Red Sox===
====2004====

On May 15, 2004, when Red Sox regular starting third baseman Bill Mueller was placed on the disabled list, Youkilis was called up for the first time. &quot;I didn&#x27;t sleep much&quot;, Youkilis said. &quot;I got about four hours of sleep. … They told me the night before I was playing... I got in there, and man, I was just amped up and excited.&quot; During his first major-league game in Toronto, with his parents watching from the second row behind the dugout, Youkilis (in his second at bat) homered against 1996 Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen, becoming just the seventh player in team history to hit a home run in his first game. As a prank, the team initially gave Youkilis the silent treatment when he returned to the dugout after his homer. &quot;This one will go down probably as the greatest day of my life&quot;, he said.

Later, Youkilis was swept up in the team&#x27;s ritual annual hazing, in which he and other rookies were made to wear skimpy Hooters waitress outfits, orange satin shorts and tight, clingy white tank tops, for the team trip from Canada through US Customs in Florida. &quot;I walked into the locker room, and all my clothes were gone&quot;, Youkilis said. &quot;There was just a Hooters outfit and shoes.&quot; Youkilis was named the American League (AL) Rookie of the Month for May, after leading AL rookies with nine walks and a .446 OBP as he batted .318 with 7 RBI, and 15 runs in 13 games. Noting ways that his life had suddenly changed, he said: &quot;I&#x27;m staying in the best hotel I&#x27;ve ever stayed in, and my paycheck has quadrupled.&quot; In mid-July he was sent back down to AAA, however, to make room for Ramiro Mendoza, though he was brought up again towards the end of the season.

On September 24, which was Yom Kippur, Youkilis appeared in the dugout in uniform, but declined to participate in the game out of deference to the religious holiday. Youkilis was named the club&#x27;s Rookie of the Year by the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. For the season, in 44 games, he saw an average of 4.67 pitches per plate appearance, first among major leaguers with at least 90 plate appearances. As Youkilis observed, &quot;Fighting off pitches, fouling off pitches, laying off pitches, making it so the opposing pitcher can&#x27;t breathe; that&#x27;s my job.&quot; He was on the roster for the Red Sox for the 2004 American League Division Series (ALDS), making his sole appearance in Game 2 against the Anaheim Angels. &quot;It&#x27;s been an unbelievable ride&quot;, Youkilis said. &quot;It&#x27;s a great first year, a year you probably can&#x27;t top. Hopefully, it ends like a Cinderella story.&quot; He was removed from the roster for the next round, the American League Championship Series (ALCS), and was on the roster but did not play in the World Series.

====2005====
While virtually nobody else knew it, Youkilis broke his toe during spring training in 2005, and was back playing again in a matter of days. It was &quot;in Vero Beach&quot;, Youkilis said. &quot;I was trying to make the team.&quot;

On the Red Sox Opening Day roster for the first time in his career in 2005, Youkilis found himself on the way back down to Pawtucket on April 13 as the team needed to activate Curt Schilling, and Youkilis happened to still have minor league options; but told that he would be back, Youkilis decided to keep his Boston apartment and commute to Pawtucket. Up and down all season as the Red Sox made use of his options, he got a call-up—prompted by Bill Mueller having back spasms in batting practice—one August day as he was in Pawtucket&#x27;s clubhouse before a game. Without changing out of the same white pants that he wore for both Boston and Pawtucket home games, he packed his car, drove the to Boston, walked into the Red Sox clubhouse, changed his jersey and cleats, and was ready to play.

He ultimately played 43 more games for Pawtucket in 2005 before being called up permanently. On September 18, he fractured the tip of the ring finger of his right hand fielding a ground ball, and did not play again until October 2, the final day of the regular season. In 2005 with Boston, Youkilis hit .278 with a .400 on-base percentage in 79 at-bats in 44 games during five stints with the team. He saw an average of 4.68 pitches per plate appearance, the most of any Red Sox player with at least 50 at-bats. He made 23 appearances at third base, nine at first base, and two at second, and batted at least once from all nine spots in the batting order.

====2006====

In 2006, his first full season in the majors, Youkilis became a regular first baseman (with 127 games at first). Until that time, he was primarily a third baseman, though he did play nine games at first base with the Red Sox in 2005, and 56 games at first base in his minor league career. Also in 2006 he played in the outfield for the first time in his professional career, 18 games in left field. Despite his inexperience in the outfield, Youkilis did not commit an error while in the outfield; he did, however, commit eight errors while playing the infield.

Youkilis tied for the major league lead in sacrifice flies (11), and led the AL with 4.43 pitches per plate appearance and by hitting line drives 24% of time that he put balls in play. Also that year, Youkilis finished second in the AL in pitches seen (3,009) and percent of pitches taken (63.8), 4th in OBP with runners in scoring position with two outs (.524), 7th in bases on balls (91; the six players ahead of him averaged 41 home runs and 14 intentional walks, while Youkilis hit only 13 homers and was not intentionally walked once), tied for 7th in &quot;bases taken&quot; (22; advanced on fly balls, passed balls, wild pitches, balks, etc.), 8th in doubles (42) and batting average with runners in scoring position with two out (.375), 9th in walk percentage (13.8%), and 10th in times on base (259). He scored 100 runs, hit for a .325 batting average with runners in scoring position, and hit four first inning leadoff home runs. He did this despite struggling in the second half of the season with plantar fasciitis and a problematic abdominal muscle.

====2007====
Youkilis had a career-high 23-game hitting streak starting on May 5, 2007, and ending on June 2, 2007, in which he hit .426 (43–for–101) with 13 doubles, six home runs, 21 RBI, and a .468 OBP. At one point during the hitting streak, he had nine straight games with at least two hits (tying a Red Sox record set by Jim Rice in 1978), and became the first Red Sox hitter since Trot Nixon to hit an inside-the-park home run. During the hitting streak, on May 20, he hit what would be the shortest homer by a Sox player during the season—a 321-foot homer around the Pesky Pole. The home run would not have cleared the fence at any of the other 29 ballparks in baseball. Although the hit streak ended on June 2, he did walk three times in an 11–6 win over the Yankees.

His manager Terry Francona said, &quot;He&#x27;s taking more of what the pitchers give him, using the whole field. He&#x27;s going to work the count about as good as any hitter in baseball. Last year if he got a two-strike breaking ball, he might swing and miss. This year he&#x27;s fouling it off, or taking it to right field.&quot;

On June 1, Yankees pitcher Scott Proctor hit Youkilis in the head with a pitch; Proctor was ejected from the game. On August 30, Yankees pitcher Joba Chamberlain threw a pair of 98 mph pitches over Youkilis&#x27;s head; Chamberlain was ejected, and later also suspended two games for &quot;inappropriate actions.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s the second time&quot;, Youkilis observed. &quot;Scott Proctor hit me in the head. Coincidence? I don&#x27;t know. It doesn&#x27;t look good.&quot;

On June 25, 2007, Youkilis played in his 120th consecutive game at first base without an error, breaking the prior Red Sox record set in 1921 by Stuffy McInnis. On September 7, he played in his 179th consecutive game at first base without an error, which broke the prior AL record set in 1973 by Mike Hegan.

On September 15, Yankees pitcher Chien-Ming Wang struck Youkilis on his right wrist with a pitch, resulting in a deep tendon bruise that kept him out until September 25, when he returned with the aid of a cortisone shot. In 2007, Youkilis was sixth in the AL with 15 hit by pitch (HBP).

Youkilis&#x27;s error-less streak at the end of the regular season was 190 games; while he was charged with an error in the sixth inning of an October 16, 2007, playoff game against the Cleveland Indians, postseason games are not included in the record. Youkilis said, &quot;I&#x27;m not worried about making the error. I&#x27;m worried about trying to help the team win and trying to get an out any way we can.&quot; Leading the league with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage, and an AL-record 1,079 error-less chances at first, Youkilis won the 2007 AL Gold Glove award for first basemen.

While he batted .288 for the season, with men on base, he hit .340 with a .435 OBP. He was 6th in the league in pitches per plate appearance (4.27) and in hit by pitch (15).

In the first inning of Game 1 of the ALDS against the Angels he hit his first post-season home run. It was his first homer since returning from being hit by Wang, and Youkilis said his wrist &quot;felt a lot better as the days have progressed. I think the best thing about it is that it&#x27;s playoff time, and adrenaline helps the most.&quot; In the 7-game ALCS against the Indians he hit three more home runs, had 14 hits (tying the LCS record jointly held by Hideki Matsui and Albert Pujols since 2004), and scored 10 runs (bettering Matsui&#x27;s 2004 ALCS record) while batting .500 (another new ALCS record, bettering Bob Boone&#x27;s .455 in 1986) with a .576 OBP and a .929 slugging percentage.

Still, in the World Series against Colorado, he did not start the team&#x27;s away games. Francona faced a dilemma when playing without a DH in the NL park of having to bench either Youkilis, 120-RBI man Mike Lowell, or 117-RBI man David Ortiz, as he had to choose from among them which two would play first base and third base. Bob Ryan of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called it &quot;the most difficult decision any American League manager has had to make in the 34-year history of the DH&quot;. Youkilis said, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t bother me. I want to play, but I totally understand the situation. Look, I&#x27;m doing everything I&#x27;ve always wanted to do. I&#x27;m playing in a World Series. I&#x27;m playing every day. I&#x27;m happy. I just want to win... If I have to take a seat, that&#x27;s just the way it has to be.&quot; Youkilis hit two doubles (both in Game 1) and had three walks in only 12 plate appearances in the 4-game win over Colorado, as he was not in the starting lineup for the away games. Dismissing questions as to whether he was upset about being benched for the last two games of the World Series, Youkilis said, &quot;Move on and go to another team if you’re worried about your playing time, and think you deserve to play over somebody else.&quot;

Youkilis was selected the 2007 recipient of the Jackie Jensen Award for spirit and determination by the Boston BBWAA chapter.

====2008====

In 2007, Youkilis had earned $424,500, the fourth-lowest salary on the club. In February 2008, he signed a one-year contract for $3 million, avoiding salary arbitration. In March 2008, his role as the designated player representative of the Red Sox became known during the resolution of a player-management dispute regarding non-payment of coaches and staff for the Red Sox trip to Japan.

On April 2, 2008, on an unassisted game-ending play against the Oakland A&#x27;s, Youkilis broke the Major League record for most consecutive error-less games by a first baseman, previously held by Steve Garvey, at 194 games. In his 205th game without an error on April 27, Youkilis also established a new major league record for first basemen, when he fielded his 1,701st consecutive chance without an error, passing the old mark of 1,700 set by Stuffy McInnis from 1921 to 1922. His streak, which started on July 4, 2006, was snapped at 238 games (2,002 fielding attempts) on June 7, 2008, against the Seattle Mariners.

He was named AL Player of the Week for May 5–11, after batting .375 while leading the AL with five home runs, and tying for the American League lead with 10 RBI.

In an early June game at Fenway Park, one camera reportedly showed Manny Ramirez taking a swing at Youkilis, and the two had to be separated by teammates in the Red Sox dugout. &quot;I think they were just exchanging some views on things&quot;, manager Terry Francona said. &quot;We had a lot of testosterone going tonight.&quot; Asked about the incident the following year, Youkilis said: &quot;We have two different approaches to the game. Winning and losing isn’t life and death to Manny.&quot;

He was the AL&#x27;s starter at first base on the 2008 AL All-Star team that played the 79th Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, voted in by the fans with 2,858,130 votes in his first year on the ballot. Youkilis became the sixth Red Sox first baseman to start an All-Star Game at first base, following Jimmie Foxx (1938; 40), Walt Dropo (1950), Mickey Vernon (1956), George Scott (1966), and Mo Vaughn (1996).

In late July, Manny Ramirez was traded away by the Red Sox. Youkilis took over the cleanup spot of the lineup.

In 2008, Youkilis led the AL in at bats per RBI (4.7), was third in slugging percentage (.569) and sacrifice flies (9), fourth in RBI (115), extra base hits (76), and OPS (.958); fifth in hit by pitch (12); sixth in batting average (.312) and on-base percentage (.390); seventh in doubles (43) and in times advanced from first to third on a single (14); eighth in total bases (306), 10th in at-bats per home run (18.6), and 12th in home runs (29). He was also second in extra base hit percentage (12.2% of all plate appearances) and tied for seventh in times advanced from first to third on a single (14).

Youkilis also batted .356 against relief pitchers, .358 with men on base, and .374 with runners in scoring position. He drew seven intentional walks during the 2008 season, the first season he had garnered any, and also led the AL with a .353 batting average after the sixth inning.

Youkilis finished third in the balloting for the 2008 AL MVP Award, receiving two first-place votes (one from Evan Grant of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;), while his teammate Dustin Pedroia won and Justin Morneau came in second. Only Youkilis and Morneau were named on all ballots.

In the ALCS Game 5 vs. the Tampa Bay Rays, the Red Sox were down by seven runs in the bottom of the seventh inning. Youkilis scored the winning run for the Red Sox to complete the second-largest comeback in MLB postseason history. Before Game 4 of the 2008 World Series, he was named the winner of the AL Hank Aaron Award for the best offensive performance of the 2008 season.

====2009====
Youkilis signed a four-year, $41.25 million contract with the Red Sox on January 15, 2009. The deal also included a team option (at $14 million, with a $1.25 million buyout) for 2013. Later that year, he was voted #36 on the &quot;Sporting News&quot; list of the 50 greatest active baseball players, voted on by a panel that included members of the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Youkilis batted cleanup for Team USA in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, tying for the lead among all WBC players in home runs (3) and runs (9), and tying for second on the team in RBIs (6) and walks (6), through the first two rounds. He had to leave the team with a left ankle sprain, however, before the WBC semifinals.

Youkilis hit a walk off home run against the Yankees on April 24, 2009. &quot;He has skills, man&quot;, said David Ortiz. &quot;I don&#x27;t know how he do it. He just do it.&quot; He was subsequently placed on the disabled list a few days later, but returned to play on May 20. &quot;It&#x27;s frustrating not being able to play&quot;, he said. &quot;Watching baseball is not something I like to do.&quot;

Youkilis was picked to be a reserve on the AL 2009 All-Star team by Tampa Bay and AL manager Joe Maddon, after coming in second in the fan vote to Mark Teixeira, 3,309,050–3,069,906.

On August 6, 2009, with the Red Sox suffering numerous injuries, Youkilis played left field for the first time since he played 18 games there in 2006. On August 8, he again played left field, and made a couple of twists and turns on a fly ball hit by Johnny Damon before committing an error.

On August 11, 2009, after 6&#x27; 5&quot; pitcher Rick Porcello of the Detroit Tigers hit him in the back with an 89 mph pitch, Youkilis immediately charged Porcello on the mound. Youkilis threw his helmet at the fast back-pedaling Porcello, and Porcello tackled Youkilis, both went down, and both benches cleared. Both players were tossed from the game, and each received a five-game suspension.

Hearing that his friend and former minor league teammate Greg Montalbano had died of testicular cancer at the age of 31 late on August 21, Youkilis dedicated his next game to his friend&#x27;s memory. After inscribing &quot;GM&quot; in marker on his cap, he hit two home runs in the game against the Yankees, while driving in six runs. Both times as he crossed home plate, he looked up and pointed to the sky. &quot;That was for him&quot;, Youkilis said. &quot;There are some crazy things that have happened in my life. You … feel like there&#x27;s somebody out there somewhere pushing balls out for you, and doing great things.&quot;

In 2009, Youkilis was second in the AL in OBP (.413) and OPS (.961), fourth in hit by pitch (16), fifth in slugging percentage (.548), and batted .305 overall and .362 with runners in scoring position. He also led the AL in pitches per plate appearance (4.42), was sixth in batting average on balls in play (.363), and 10th in walk percentage (13.6%). &quot;Statistically, if you consider 2008 and 2009, you could make the case there has been no better player in the league [in that time]&quot;, said Red Sox EVP Epstein. Of the players with 1,000 plate appearances in the AL over the 2008–09 seasons, none had a higher OPS than Youkilis (.960).

In the field, while Youkilis split his time primarily between first base and third base and therefore did not qualify for the fielding percentage title at either, his .998 fielding percentage in 78 games at first matched that of the league leader Lyle Overbay, and his .974 fielding percentage in 63 games at third base was better than league-leader Melvin Mora&#x27;s .971.

Youkilis finished sixth in balloting for the 2009 AL MVP Award, receiving two second-place votes. He was selected as the Red Sox most valuable player (winner of the 2009 Thomas A. Yawkey Memorial Award) in voting by the Boston Chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America.

====2010====
In 2010, Youkilis was again named to &quot;Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, ranking No. 38 on the list. A panel of 21 MLB executives was polled to arrive at the list.

On May 18, 2010, Youkilis hit his 100th career home run off CC Sabathia.

On August 2, Youkilis&#x27; season was cut short by a right thumb abductor muscle tear, which he had played through for two weeks. At the time of his injury, he was tied for 3rd in the major leagues in runs scored (77), and led all major leaguers with a .798 slugging percentage against left-handed pitchers. He was 3rd in the AL in on-base percentage (.411), tied for 5th in walks (58), tied for 7th in extra-base hits (50), 8th in slugging percentage (.564), and 9th in total bases (204). He had surgery to repair the tear on August 6.

The injury limited him to only 102 games for the season, his fewest since his 2005 sophomore year. Slowed by his injury, he had only 362 at-bats, but batted .307/.411/.564 with 19 home runs and 62 RBI. For the years 2008–10, his .964 OPS ranked second in the major leagues, behind Albert Pujols (1.074).

====2011====
During the offseason the Red Sox acquired All-Star first baseman Adrián González, and with the imminent departure of Adrián Beltré, Youkilis agreed to the make the switch back to third base.

In 2011, Youkilis was again named to &quot;Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, ranking No. 35 on the list. A panel of 21 MLB executives was polled to arrive at the list.

Youkilis was named a reserve for the 82nd All-Star Game. At the All-Star break, he was third in the league in doubles (26), fourth in on-base percentage (.399), sixth in RBIs (63), seventh in OPS (.911), and ninth in walks (49). For the season, he led all AL third basemen in fielding percentage, at .967. However, he batted only .258, his lowest MLB season average of his career.

The Red Sox suffered a collapse late in the 2011 season, losing their playoff positioning. A source among the Red Sox claimed that Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, and John Lackey spent games they did not pitch in the clubhouse eating fried chicken and drinking beer; some Red Sox teammates speculated that Youkilis was the source of this information, alienating him from his teammates.

====2012====
On April 15, 2012, Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine publicly questioned Youkilis&#x27; motivation and physical ability to succeed. Viewing rookie Will Middlebrooks as the superior third baseman, Valentine began to play Middlebrooks over Youkilis. The Red Sox traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24 for pitcher Zach Stewart and utility man Brent Lillibridge. The Red Sox agreed to pay $5.5 million of Youkilis&#x27; salary to help close the deal. In the seventh inning of that day&#x27;s game, Ben Cherington, the Red Sox General Manager, informed Valentine that a transaction was pending. Youkilis hit a triple in his last at bat, and received a long standing ovation while tipping his helmet to the crowd after being taken out for pinch runner Nick Punto.

===Chicago White Sox (2012)===

The next day, Youkilis started for the White Sox, playing against the Minnesota Twins. He went 1–for–4 with a single in the 4–1 loss. He hit his first home run as a member of the White Sox on July 3, against the Texas Rangers off of Roy Oswalt. He also went 3–6 with 4 RBIs in that game. On July 9, 2012, Youkilis was named the American League Player of the Week, after batting .478 with three home runs and 10 RBI in a 5–1 span for the White Sox. White Sox manager Robin Ventura reported that Youkilis was a competitor with a &quot;grinder mentality&quot;, who fit in well with his White Sox teammates.

On July 16, Youkilis returned to Boston with the White Sox. During his first at bat, the Fenway Park crowd gave him a loud, extended cheer, causing Youkilis to step out of the batter&#x27;s box and acknowledge fans. He went 3–for–4 with two doubles in the game.

For the season, he batted .235/.336/.409 with 19 home runs and 60 RBI, and tied for the major league lead in hit by pitch, with 17. He became a free agent after the 2012 season.

===New York Yankees (2013)===
On December 11, Youkilis accepted a one-year contract worth $12 million to play third base for the New York Yankees. Though Youkilis had not been popular with members of the Yankees and their fans, Robinson Canó and Alex Rodriguez publicly supported the signing, and Joba Chamberlain reached out to Youkilis in an attempt to smooth over their past differences. The deal became official on December 14. Youkilis was diagnosed with a lumbar spine sprain when the 2013 season began and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 30, 2013. He was activated and returned on May 30, 2013. He was placed back on the disabled list on June 14, 2013, after re-injuring his back. Youkilis then underwent surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back on June 20, 2013, and was expected to miss 10–12 weeks. However, he missed the remainder of the 2013 season. In only 28 games played, Youkilis hit a career-low .219 with two home runs and eight RBI.

===Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles (2014)===

Youkilis agreed to a one-year, $4 million contract with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of Nippon Professional Baseball for the 2014 season. He missed part of the season due to plantar fasciitis. In 21 games, Youkilis batted .215 with one home run and 11 RBI.

===Career statistics===
In 1,061 games over 10 seasons, Youkilis posted a .281 batting average (1,053-for-3,749) with 653 runs, 254 doubles, 18 triples, 150 home runs, 618 RBI, 539 bases on balls, 104 hit by pitch (as of 2020, 85th all-time), a .382 on-base percentage, and a .478 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .9975 fielding percentage at first base (as of 2020, 2nd all-time, 0.001 behind Casey Kotchman), and a .991 fielding percentage overall. In 29 postseason games, he batted .306 (34-for-111) with 22 runs, nine doubles, six home runs, 17 RBI and 13 walks.

==World Baseball Classic; Team Israel hitting coach==
Youkilis was the hitting coach for Team Israel, under manager Ian Kinsler, when it competed in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.

==Life after baseball==
On October 30, 2014, Youkilis announced his retirement from baseball. In February 2015, Youkilis was hired by his former GM Theo Epstein as a scout and development consultant for the Chicago Cubs.

In August 2016, Youkilis, along with his brother Scott, purchased the Los Gatos Brewing Company, and re-opened it as the Loma Brewing Company, a brewpub in Los Gatos, California. The brewery was subsequently named as the 2017 California Commercial Beer Brewery of the Year.

In 2018, Youkilis was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame.

In 2022, Youkilis began working as an analyst on Red Sox broadcasts for the New England Sports Network.

==&quot;Moneyball&quot;==
Michael Lewis&#x27;s 2003 best-seller &quot;&quot; focuses on Oakland Athletics&#x27; General Manager Billy Beane&#x27;s use of Sabermetrics as a tool in the evaluation of potential prospects. In the book, Lewis discusses then-prospect Youkilis in detail, and refers to him as &quot;Euclis, the Greek God of Walks&quot;, a moniker that has stuck. Beane put more stock in empirical evidence than in scouts&#x27; hunches, and did not care that Youkilis was pudgy (or, as Lewis put it in the book, &quot;a fat third baseman who couldn&#x27;t run, throw, or field&quot;), but just loved his ability to get on base (helped in no small part by the ballplayer&#x27;s 20/11 vision). The book brought minor leaguer Youkilis his first national recognition.Lewis also revealed that Beane repeatedly tried to trade for Youkilis before Youkilis reached the major leagues, but his attempts were blocked by then-Red Sox GM Theo Epstein.

Asked by a reporter what he thought of the nickname, Youkilis quipped, &quot;It&#x27;s better than being &#x27;the Greek God of Illegitimate Children.&#x27;&quot; But according to his father, &quot;Kevin disliked that &#x27;Greek God of Walks&#x27; stuff.&quot; &quot;It was frustrating to hear fans say, &#x27;Get a walk!&#x27;&quot; Youkilis said. &quot;I&#x27;ll take a walk—a walk&#x27;s as good as a hit—but don&#x27;t you want me to hit a home run or something?&quot;

==Religion and community service==
===Career highlights as a Jewish baseball player===

On August 8, 2005, while playing for the Red Sox, Youkilis took the field in the 9th inning along with Adam Stern and Gabe Kapler, setting a record for the most Jewish players on the field at one time in AL history, and the most in Major League Baseball history since four Jewish players took the field for the New York Giants in a game in 1941.

Youkilis was featured in the 2008 Hank Greenberg 75th Anniversary edition of Jewish Major Leaguers Baseball Cards, published in affiliation with Fleer Trading Cards and the American Jewish Historical Society, commemorating the Jewish Major Leaguers from 1871 through 2008. He joined, among other Jewish major leaguers, Ryan Braun, Brad Ausmus, Ian Kinsler, Brian Horwitz, Gabe Kapler, Jason Marquis, Jason Hirsh, John Grabow, Craig Breslow, and Scott Schoeneweis.

He was one of three Jewish players in the 2008 All-Star Game, joining Braun and Kinsler, and one of three Jewish players on the Team USA 2009 World Baseball Classic team, joining Braun and Grabow. Kinsler says that &quot;Youkilis always says something to me on the bases. &#x27;Happy Passover,&#x27; he&#x27;ll throw something at me.&quot;

Youkilis was named the Jewish MVP for 2008, beating out fellow All-Stars Braun and Kinsler. He was voted the top Jewish baseball player of the decade 2000–09 in online balloting, beating out Shawn Green and Braun. Through the 2018 season, his .382 on base percentage placed him fifth on the career all-time list of Jewish major leaguers (directly behind Al Rosen), his .478 slugging percentage placed him sixth (behind Shawn Green), his 254 doubles and 618 career RBI placed him 7th (behind Mike Lieberthal for doubles, and behind Al Rosen for RBIs), his 150 home runs tied him for seventh with Lieberthal (behind Al Rosen), and his 539 walks placed him eighth behind Ryan Braun.

In &quot;Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story&quot;, a 2010 documentary film narrated by Dustin Hoffman, Youkilis noted:It&#x27;s something that I probably won’t realize until my career is over, how many people are really rooting for me and cheering for me. And it&#x27;s not just because I went 3-for-4, or had a great game. It&#x27;s just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people and a lot of the Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of our people have had.He expressed interest in playing for Israel at the 2013 World Baseball Classic, if healthy. Since the 2013 qualifier was during the regular season, he was unable to compete, but he announced that he would play for the team if they made it past the qualifying round.

In an embarrassing formatting oddity, it was noticed in 2007 that multiple baseball websites such as Baseball-Reference.com and Baseball Prospectus had been using &quot;youkike&quot; as part of their URLs for webpages featuring Youkilis. This unintended quirk affected those sites that used an automatic URL-creating algorithm which combined the first five letters of a player&#x27;s surname with the first two letters of his first name. Following the discovery, the sites manually adjusted the URLs to remove the inadvertent ethnic slur.

At one point, the University of Cincinnati expressed interest in renaming its Marge Schott Stadium to &quot;Kevin Youkilis Field at Marge Schott Stadium,&quot; after Youkilis. However, Youkilis, sensitized by the fact that he is Jewish, declined to be associated with late Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott, who was known for her racist and anti-Semitic statements. Youkilis recalled his father saying to him: &quot;Kevin that is a tremendous honor that they would think of doing this. The only problem is that our family name will never coexist with that other individual. I will never let our family name be next to someone that was filled with such hatred of our Jewish community.&quot; In 2020, Bearcats pitcher Nathan Moore along with Youkilis called for the university to remove Schott&#x27;s name from the stadium. In June of that year the university&#x27;s board of trustees voted unanimously to remove Schott&#x27;s name from the stadium, effective immediately.

===Philanthropy===
Kevin Youkilis Hits For Kids is a charitable organization established by Youkilis in 2007. Youkilis&#x27;s foundation focuses on raising support and awareness for the health, advocacy, safety, and medical healing of children across Massachusetts, in his hometown of Cincinnati, and beyond. Rallying the support of volunteers, local business, and the heart of Red Sox Nation, Kevin Youkilis Hits for Kids teams with existing, community-based children&#x27;s charities and medical research efforts that lack sufficient funding and awareness. One organization that Hits for Kids works with is the Joslin Diabetes Center&#x27;s Pediatric Health Services. He has a special sensitivity about youth suicide, since his college roommate, a close and supportive friend of his since high school, committed suicide on Thanksgiving during his sophomore year. To this day, he said, &quot;I sit back at night and wonder what I could&#x27;ve done.&quot;

&quot;In my religion, the Jewish religion, that&#x27;s one of the biggest things that&#x27;s taught, is giving a mitzvah, forming a mitzvah&quot;, said Youkilis. &quot;I was always taught as a kid giving to charity. You&#x27;re supposed to give a good amount of charity each and every year. … It&#x27;s just a great thing when you can make a kid smile that&#x27;s going through some hard times in life … I wish more people, not just athletes, would give people just a little bit of their time. It doesn&#x27;t take much … It can make a huge difference.&quot;

After the first game of the ALDS, Youkilis re-shaved his head for good luck in a sign of solidarity with cancer patient Mitt Campbell. Following the team&#x27;s 2007 World Series victory, Youkilis shaved his goatee for a $5,000 donation by Gillette to his foundation.

All profits from his charity wine &quot;SauvignYoouuk Blanc&quot;, released in 2008, support Hits for Kids.

==Family==
In November 2008, Youkilis and Enza Sambataro held a wedding ceremony in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, though the couple never formalized their wedding. The ceremony was attended by Red Sox teammates Mike Lowell, David Ortiz, and Dustin Pedroia. Sambataro, a Newton, Massachusetts native, was CEO of Youkilis&#x27;s charity, Hits for Kids, until the couple split up in 2010.

In February 2012, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; reported that Youkilis was engaged to Julie Brady, the sister of National Football League quarterback Tom Brady. Two months later, the couple were quietly married in New York City, and a pregnancy was rumored at that time. Twelve months after the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; article, the wedded couple, along with their infant son, were featured in a 30-minute program on the YES Network. The family lives in Los Gatos, California.

==In popular culture==
Youkilis made an appearance in season 1, episode 8 of the Travel Channel show &quot;Man v. Food&quot;. The episode was recorded at Boston&#x27;s Eagle&#x27;s Deli and featured Youkilis rooting against host (and New York Yankees fan) Adam Richman in an eating challenge. In 2011, he appeared in the music video for the Dropkick Murphys song &quot;Going Out in Style&quot;.

<doc id="879065" wikidata="Q4763360" url="?curid=879065" title="Angle of Repose">
<text>Angle of Repose is a 1971 novel by Wallace Stegner about a wheelchair-using historian, Lyman Ward, who has lost connection with his son and living family and decides to write about his frontier-era grandparents. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1972. The novel is directly based on the letters of Mary Hallock Foote, later published as &quot;A Victorian Gentlewoman in the Far West&quot;.

Stegner&#x27;s use of substantial passages from Foote&#x27;s actual letters as the correspondence of his fictional character Susan Burling Ward was and remains controversial among some scholars. While Stegner&#x27;s defenders have claimed that he had received permission to use Foote&#x27;s writings, as the book&#x27;s acknowledgments page implies, others point out that he secured that permission only after falsely claiming that his novel would not use any direct quotations.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Angle of Repose&quot; #82 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Explanation of the novel&#x27;s title==

The title, seemingly taken from Foote&#x27;s writings, is an engineering term for the angle at which soil finally settles after, for example, being dumped from a mine as tailings. It seems to describe the loose wandering of the Ward family as they try to carve out a civilized existence in the West and, Susan hopes, to return to the East as successes. The story details Oliver&#x27;s struggles on various mining, hydrology, and construction engineering jobs, and Susan&#x27;s adaptation to a hard life.

Another view has to do with a typical construction of canals and the drowning of Ward&#x27;s daughter in a canal. Canal banks are sometimes simply piled mounds of dirt. Slanted walls of dirt are left at the angle of repose after the canal is built. Small disturbances to the dirt can cause it to slide down. Ward&#x27;s daughter fell into a canal and couldn&#x27;t climb out because of this.

==Plot summary==

Lyman Ward narrates a century after the fact. Lyman interprets the story at times and leaves gaps that he points out at other times. Some of the disappointments of his life, including his divorce, color his interpretation of his grandparents&#x27; story. Toward the end of the novel, he gives up on his original ambition of writing a complete biography of his grandmother.

Stegner&#x27;s use of Mary Hallock Foote&#x27;s historical letters gives the novel&#x27;s locations—Grass Valley, Leadville, New Almaden, Idaho, and Mexico—an authentic feel; the letters also add vividness to the Wards&#x27; struggles with the environment, shady businessmen, and politicians. Lyman&#x27;s position in the contemporary culture of the late sixties provides another historical dimension to the story. Foils for this plot line include Lyman&#x27;s adult son, a UC Berkeley-trained sociologist who sees little value in history, and a neighbor&#x27;s daughter who helps transcribe Lyman&#x27;s tape-recorded notes while she is home on summer break from UC Berkeley, where she has been active in the &quot;hippie&quot; counterculture movement.

==Fictional characters in &quot;Angle of Repose&quot;==

===Lyman Ward===
58-year-old retired history professor Lyman Ward is the narrator of the book. He is a divorced amputee with a debilitating disease that is slowly &quot;petrifying&quot; him. The text of &quot;Angle of Repose&quot; is transcribed tapes of Ward dictating what is to become the biography of his grandmother, Susan Burling Ward. The dictation begins on April 12, 1970, and continues through the summer. Fiercely independent, Ward lives alone at the Zodiac Cottage, the house where his grandmother spent the last decades of her life and in which he spent time as a child. &quot;Because of his disease and because his wife has abandoned him, [Ward] has reached a major crisis point in his life...His crisis leads him to the need to find a direction for his shattered life. That direction is provided by finding out about and trying to understand his grandparents...&quot;

Aside from his scholarly work which consists of composing a biography from his grandmother&#x27;s letters, published writings, and newspaper clippings, Ward spends his time on daily exercise, conversing with his summer secretary (Ada&#x27;s daughter Shelly Rasmussen), and watching baseball with the Hawkes family. In addition, a major theme for Lyman Ward is fighting off intrusions into his life by his son, Rodman, and Rodman&#x27;s wife who are skeptical of his self-reliance and, according to Ward, wish to send him to &quot;...the retirement home in Menlo Park&quot;.

According to Jackson J. Benson, the character of Lyman Ward was modeled after Stegner&#x27;s dissertation adviser at the University of Iowa, Norman Foerster, who also lost the use of his legs late in life due to disease.

===Susan Burling Ward===
In her youth, Susan Burling (the character based on Mary Hallock Foote) was a promising writer and artist connected with some of the leading lights in New York culture. When she and Oliver Ward met and fell in love, she left the promise of New York to follow him, expecting to return. The contrast between her life in the American West in the second half of the 19th century to that of her best friend in New York is a constant thread through the novel. Lyman depicts her as disappointed with her family&#x27;s position in life, but a strong character able to adjust to the circumstances.

===Oliver Ward===
Based on Mary&#x27;s husband Arthur De Wint Foote, Oliver is a bright, straightforward, honest man who has focused on supporting the family he loves. A mining engineer, he moves all over the West following jobs to Colorado, California, Mexico, and Idaho. Sometimes he is on his own, but when he feels he can, he has his family join him—often in the most primitive of homes in the wildest of places. His honesty limits his progress in the rough world they find themselves trying to succeed in. Lyman sees a struggle between this limitation and Susan&#x27;s desire to recreate some of the &quot;culture&quot; of the East that she gave up upon her marriage, a desire that can only be fulfilled if her husband makes a great deal of money.

==Historical characters ==
The novel is thickly populated with real historical personages. A &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; of American geologists and other Western individuals of the late 19th century make their appearance, including John Wesley Powell, Clarence King, Samuel Franklin Emmons, Henry Janin, and Rossiter W. Raymond.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Upon publication, &quot;Angle of Repose&quot; was praised nearly unanimously by critics for being both &quot;...the most ambitious and deeply realized of [Stegner&#x27;s] works&quot; and on a larger scale, &quot;...a major piece of literature&quot;. While some felt that Stegner did not make the meaning of Susan Burling Ward&#x27;s story clear enough to Lyman Ward, most critics agreed that the characters, plot, and historical setting of &quot;Angle of Repose&quot; are well-realized. Even the slightly delayed review from &quot;The New York Times&quot; (most newspapers reviewed the book in April while the &quot;Times&quot; reviewed it in August) was just short of entirely positive, with the reviewer praising the novel with the reservation that &quot;...I reached page 569 convinced that an essential element was absent&quot;. Despite this missing &quot;element&quot;, most critics agree that &quot;Angle of Repose&quot; is &quot;...one of the most important American novels of the twentieth century...&quot;

The reputation of &quot;Angle of Repose&quot; remains strong among readers as well as critics. In 1999, readers of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; voted it the best 20th-century novel written about the western United States.

Parts of the novel come from &quot;A Victorian Gentlewoman in the Far West: The Reminiscences of Mary Hallock Foote&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted into an opera by Andrew Imbrie to a libretto by Oakley Hall, premiered by San Francisco Opera in 1976; Chester Ludgin created the role of Lyman Ward.

<text>Austin is an unincorporated small town in, and former county seat of, Lander County, Nevada, United States. In 2020, the census-designated place of Austin had a population of 167. It is located on the western slopes of the Toiyabe Range at an elevation of . U.S. Route 50 passes through the town.

==History==
The Austin area was originally occupied by bands of the Western Shoshone people. The city of Austin was mapped out in 1862 by David Buell. This was during the American Civil War, and the Union was eager to find new sources of precious metals, especially gold, to support the war effort. The city was named after Buell&#x27;s partner, Alvah Austin, during a silver rush. The valued metal was reputedly found when a Pony Express horse kicked over a rock and observers noticed the silver. In 1862, it was designated as the county seat of Lander County. (In 1979, after the center of population had shifted, the county seat was shifted to Battle Mountain.) By summer 1863, Austin and the surrounding Reese River Mining District had a population of more than 10,000, mostly European Americans attracted to the silver boom. In January 1864, a petition was created to combine Clifton, Austin and Upper Austin into the &quot;City of Austin.&quot; The Governor signed the bill in February 1864. 
In 1864, the town launched Reuel Colt Gridley&#x27;s impromptu fundraising drive that raised over $250,000 for wounded Civil War veterans, by repeatedly auctioning a sack of flour.

The Nevada Central Railroad was built to connect Austin with the transcontinental railroad at Battle Mountain in 1880. However, by that time the silver boom was almost over. The city was disincorporated in 1881. Major silver production ended by 1887, although there was a slight revival in the 1910s. In the mid-1950s there was a great deal of interest in uranium deposits in the area, to fuel the emerging nuclear industry, but the ore proved to be of low quality.

Gold and silver mining has continued in the area sporadically and at generally low levels of production. High quality turquoise is still mined in the area in small quantities. Several shops manufacture jewelry from local turquoise.

==Geography==
The Austin silver deposits consist of numerous narrow (often only several inches in width) quartz veins hosted in monzonite rock. The main ore minerals are sulfides that contain silver, including large quantities of galena and tetrahedrite. Oxidized ore, which was very shallow, included silver chloride (chlorargyrite) which was easily reduced to metallic silver, although these oxidized deposits were exhausted quickly. The deeper sulfide (hypogene) ore was much more difficult to work and had to be roasted prior to amalgamation. Milling and concentration was used to separate the silver-containing sulfides from the barren quartz. Because of the added expense of this kind of processing along with the narrow veins, only high grade ores could be profitably worked in Austin.

The Austin veins are of an older age and were formed at a greater depth than many other silver districts in Nevada, such as the epithermal veins of Virginia City (Comstock Lode). In addition, the value of the Austin ores was largely (with several exceptions) silver (with significant base metals (lead, zinc and copper)) with very little gold, whereas most epithermal veins have highly significant gold.

===Climate===

Austin experiences a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers.

==Demographics==

In 1863 Austin had a permanent and transient population of about 7,000. With the end of gold and silver mining in the region, the population has steadily declined.

==Attractions==

Austin is a &quot;living ghost town&quot;, a well-preserved example of an early Nevada mining town. It contains four churches; both the Catholic church and the Austin Methodist Church were built in 1866. The Methodist Church is now used as a community center. The Catholic Church, St. Augustine&#x27;s, has been purchased and is being restored as a cultural center for Central Nevada. The Episcopal church, dedicated to St. George and considered by some to be the prettiest frontier church still standing, was built in 1878 and is still in regular use. These three churches are listed as Nevada Historical Marker 67.

The fourth church is a more recent building built by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The International Hotel, first built in Virginia City in 1859 and moved to Austin in 1863, still serves meals and drinks, but it does not rent out rooms (there is a motel across the street). The International Hotel is said to be the oldest in Nevada. Austin contains numerous other historical buildings, in various states of repair.

Stokes Castle, an Italian-style three-story stone tower, is located just outside Austin. It was built in 1897 by Anson Phelps Stokes, a wealthy New York capitalist who had a financial interest in several of the local mines. It was occupied only for a month. Vacant and abandoned, it fell into disrepair.

In addition to Stokes Castle and the three churches, a number of other structures in Austin are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. These include the Austin Cemetery, the old city hall, the Austin Masonic and Odd Fellows Hall, the Gridley Store, the former Lander County Courthouse, and Lander County High School, as well as the Austin Historic District. Toquima Cave, an archeological and prehistoric site near the town, is also listed on the Register.

Approximately east of Austin is a cluster of natural hot springs maintained by visitors and local volunteers. The Hickison Petroglyph Recreation Area, east of Austin, features a short interpretive trail where visitors can see ancient drawings carved into the rocks.

==Government==
Austin is the headquarters of the federally recognized Yomba Shoshone Tribe of the Yomba Reservation.

==Infrastructure==
Austin has a public library, a branch of the Elko-Lander-Eureka County Library System.

==In popular culture==
* In the Lucky Luke book &quot;Le Fil qui chante&quot;, the caravan makes a stop at Austin to restock on telegraph poles.

<doc id="879081" wikidata="Q3823252" url="?curid=879081" title="The Death of the Heart">
<text>The Death of the Heart is a 1938 novel by Elizabeth Bowen set in the interwar period. It is about a sixteen-year-old orphan, Portia Quayne, who moves to London to live with her half-brother Thomas and falls in love with Eddie, a friend of her sister-in-law.

Bowen called it a &#x27;pre-war&#x27; novel, &quot;a novel which reflects the time, the pre-war time with its high tension, its increasing anxieties, and this great stress on individualism. People were so conscious of themselves, and of each other, and of their personal relationships because they thought that everything of that time might soon end.&quot; 

==Synopsis==
At the beginning of the novel, Portia moves in with Anna and Thomas Quayne after her mother dies. Portia is Thomas&#x27;s half sister. Mr. Quayne (Thomas&#x27;s father) had an extramarital affair with Irene (Portia&#x27;s mother) while married to Thomas&#x27;s mother. When Irene became pregnant, and Mrs. Quayne learned of it, she was adamant that he do what was the right thing: so, at his own wife&#x27;s unyielding insistence, Mr. Quayne divorced Thomas&#x27;s mother and married Irene. Mr. Quayne, Irene, and Portia then left England and travelled through Europe as exiles from society and from the Quayne family, living in the cheapest of lodgings. Irene and Portia continued to live in this fashion until, when Portia was 16, Irene died. Portia was sent to live with Thomas and Anna after Irene&#x27;s death. The plan is that she is to stay with them for one year at which time Portia will leave and move in with Irene&#x27;s sister (Portia&#x27;s aunt).

Portia is a naturally awkward girl, and this aspect of her personality has been intensified by her strange childhood which was one of constant travel, change, and strangers, while at the same time being incredibly isolating. She is uniquely innocent in her observations of people, and is baffled by inconsistencies between what they say and what they do, and wonders why people say things they do not mean. She keeps a diary detailing the lives of those around her, particularly Anna, trying to understand the key to people she thinks she is missing. Anna finds and reads Portia&#x27;s diary; she is incensed by the idea of the girl observing her every move, and rages about the girl to her friend St. Quentin, a writer and frequent visitor to the Quaynes&#x27;s home. It becomes clear over the course of the novel that Anna dislikes Portia because she is strange. Anna and Thomas are generally uncomfortable with Portia in their home but try to make do. They send her to classes where she makes friends with a girl named Lilian.

Portia&#x27;s love interest, if she can be said to have one, is a man named Eddie. Eddie works at Thomas&#x27;s advertising agency. He also has a flirtatious relationship with Anna prior to Portia&#x27;s arrival. Eddie does not truly love Portia.

Partway through the novel, Anna and Thomas go on holiday to Italy and send Portia to live with Anna&#x27;s former governess, Mrs. Heccomb, for the duration of the trip.

The climax of the novel occurs when St. Quentin, a friend of Anna&#x27;s, tells Portia that Anna has been reading her diary. As a result of this Portia runs away. She first goes to Eddie who becomes overwhelmed by her and sends her away telling her that he is Anna&#x27;s lover (which is not true). Portia then takes refuge with an acquaintance of Anna&#x27;s named Major Brutt. Portia goes to Major Brutt&#x27;s hotel and begs him to run away with her and to marry her. Major Brutt then calls Thomas and Anna to tell them where Portia is. The novel ends with Thomas and Anna sending their maid Matchett to Major Brutt&#x27;s hotel in order to fetch Portia.

==Literary praise==
&quot;The Death of the Heart&quot; has been named as one of the 100 best modern novels, both by &quot;Time&quot; and the Modern Library.

==Adaptation==
The novel was adapted into a 1986 TV serial, starring Patricia Hodge and Miranda Richardson.

<doc id="879090" wikidata="Q17051024" url="?curid=879090" title="Ma'ruf">
<text>Ma&#x27;ruf () is an Islamic term. &quot;The term that best helps us to understand the nature of Qurʾān ethical prescriptions is maʿrūf, a word that appears repeatedly (in slightly varying forms) in the Qurʾān&quot; and used 38 times in the Quran. The word is most often found in the Qur&#x27;anic exhortation: &quot;Amr bil Ma&#x27;ruf wa Nahy an al Munkar&quot;, often translated as &quot;Enjoin the good and forbid the wrong&quot;.

Maʿrūf and munkar are widely discussed because of the duties the Quran imposes on believers through these concepts. Maʿrūf is seen as a key word in moral understanding of the Quran, and traditional commentators oppose the association of maʿrūf with its cognate urf, &quot;custom.&quot;

Although most common translations of the phrase is &quot;good&quot;, the words used by Islamic philosophy in determining good and evil discourses are &quot;ḥusn&quot; and &quot;qubh&quot;. In its most common usage, maʿrūf is &quot;in accordance with the custom&quot;, while munkar, which has no place in the custom, as its opposite, singular (&quot;nukr&quot;). In today&#x27;s religious expression, maʿrūf is sunnah (this concept was not different from custom in the beginning), munkar is meant as bid&#x27;a. (a related topic: Istihsan)

However, today, according to the meanings attributed to the term with meaning expansions that are not based on etymological connection, the word can be used as &quot;well-known, universally accepted, ... that which is good, beneficial ...; fairness, equity, equitableness;&quot;. 

Pre-modern Islamic literature describes pious Muslims (usually scholars) taking action to forbid wrong by destroying forbidden objects, particularly liquor and musical instruments. In the contemporary Muslim world, various state or parastatal bodies (often with phrases like the &quot;Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice&quot; in their titles) have appeared in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Sudan, Malaysia, etc., at various times and with various levels of power.

<text>Elizabeth Dorothea Cole Bowen ( ; 7 June 1899 – 22 February 1973) was an Anglo-Irish novelist and short story writer notable for her books about &quot;the Big House&quot; of Irish landed Protestants as well as her fiction about life in wartime London. 

In 1958, she was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Russian-American linguist Roman Jakobson.

==Life==
Elizabeth Dorothea Cole Bowen was born on 7 June 1899 at 15 Herbert Place in Dublin, daughter of barrister Henry Charles Cole Bowen (1862–1930), who succeeded his father as head of their Irish gentry family traced back to the late 1500s, of Welsh origin, and Florence Isabella Pomeroy (died 1912), daughter of Henry FitzGeorge Pomeroy Colley, of Mount Temple, Clontarf, Dublin, grandson of the 4th Viscount Harberton. Florence Bowen&#x27;s mother was granddaughter of the 4th Viscount Powerscourt. Elizabeth Bowen was baptised in the nearby St Stephen&#x27;s Church on Upper Mount Street. Her parents later brought her to her father&#x27;s family home, Bowen&#x27;s Court at Farahy, near Kildorrery, County Cork, where she spent her summers. Among her enduring childhood friends were the artists Mainie Jellett and Sylvia Cooke-Collis. When her father became mentally ill in 1907, she and her mother moved to England, eventually settling in Hythe. After her mother died in September 1912, Bowen was brought up by her aunts; her father remarried in 1918. She was educated at Downe House School under the headship of Olive Willis. After some time at art school in London she decided that her talent lay in writing. She mixed with the Bloomsbury Group, becoming good friends with Rose Macaulay who helped her seek a publisher for her first book, a collection of short stories titled &quot;Encounters&quot; (1923).

In 1923, she married Alan Cameron, an educational administrator who subsequently worked for the BBC. The marriage has been described as &quot;a sexless but contented union.&quot; The marriage was reportedly never consummated. She had various extra-marital relationships, including one with Charles Ritchie, a Canadian diplomat seven years her junior, which lasted over thirty years. She also had an affair with the Irish writer Seán Ó Faoláin and a relationship with the American poet May Sarton. Bowen and her husband first lived near Oxford, where they socialised with Maurice Bowra, John Buchan and Susan Buchan, and where she wrote her early novels, including &quot;The Last September&quot; (1929). Following the publication of &quot;To the North&quot; (1932), they moved to 2 Clarence Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, London, where she wrote &quot;The House in Paris&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Death of the Heart&quot; (1938). In 1937, she became a member of the Irish Academy of Letters.

In 1930, Bowen became the first (and only) woman to inherit Bowen&#x27;s Court, but remained based in England, making frequent visits to Ireland. During World War II, she worked for the British Ministry of Information, reporting on Irish opinion, particularly on the issue of neutrality. Bowen&#x27;s political views tended towards Burkean conservatism. During and after the war she wrote among the greatest expressions of life in wartime London, &quot;The Demon Lover and Other Stories&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Heat of the Day&quot; (1948); she was awarded the CBE the same year.

Her husband retired in 1952 and they settled in Bowen&#x27;s Court, where he died a few months later. Many writers visited her at Bowen&#x27;s Court from 1930 onward, including Virginia Woolf, Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers, Iris Murdoch, and the historian Veronica Wedgwood. For years, Bowen struggled to keep the house going, lecturing in the United States to earn money.

In 1957, her portrait was painted at Bowen&#x27;s Court by her friend, painter Patrick Hennessy. She travelled to Italy in 1958 to research and prepare &quot;A Time in Rome&quot; (1960), but by the following year, Bowen was forced to sell her beloved Bowen&#x27;s Court, which was demolished in 1960. In the following months, she wrote the narrative of the documentary titled &quot;Ireland the Tear and the Smile&quot; for CBS which was realised in collaboration with Bob Monks as camera man and associate producer. After spending some years without a permanent home, Bowen finally settled at &quot;Carbery&quot;, Church Hill, Hythe, in 1965.

Her final novel, &quot;Eva Trout, or Changing Scenes&quot; (1968), won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1969 and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1970. Subsequently, she was a judge (alongside her friend Cyril Connolly) that awarded the 1972 Man Booker Prize to John Berger for &quot;G&quot;. She spent Christmas 1972 at Kinsale, County Cork, with her friends, Major Stephen Vernon and his wife, Lady Ursula (daughter of the Duke of Westminster) but was hospitalised upon her return. Here she was visited by Connolly, Lady Ursula Vernon, Isaiah Berlin, Rosamund Lehmann, and her literary agent Spencer Curtis Brown.

In 1972, Bowen developed lung cancer. She died in University College Hospital on 22 February 1973, age 73. She is buried with her husband in St Colman&#x27;s churchyard in Farahy, close to the gates of Bowen&#x27;s Court, where there is a memorial plaque to the author (which bears the words of John Sparrow) at the entrance to St Colman&#x27;s Church, where a commemoration of her life is held annually.

==Legacy==

In 1977, Victoria Glendinning published the first biography of Elizabeth Bowen. In 2009, Glendinning published a book about the relationship between Charles Ritchie and Bowen, based on his diaries and her letters to him. In 2012, English Heritage marked Bowen&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park home at Clarence Terrace with a blue plaque. A blue plaque was unveiled 19 October 2014 to mark Bowen&#x27;s residence at the Coach House, The Croft, Headington, from 1925 to 1935.

==Themes==

Bowen was greatly interested in &quot;life with the lid on and what happens when the lid comes off&quot;, in the innocence of orderly life, and in the eventual, irrepressible forces that transform experience. Bowen also examined the betrayal and secrets that lie beneath a veneer of respectability. The style of her works is highly wrought and owes much to literary modernism. She was an admirer of film and influenced by the filmmaking techniques of her day. The locations in which Bowen&#x27;s works are set often bear heavily on the psychology of the characters and on the plots. Bowen&#x27;s war novel &quot;The Heat of the Day&quot; (1949) is considered one of the quintessential depictions of London&#x27;s atmosphere during the bombing raids of World War II.

She was also a notable writer of ghost stories. Supernatural fiction writer Robert Aickman considered Elizabeth Bowen to be &quot;the most distinguished living practitioner&quot; of ghost stories. He included her tale &quot;The Demon Lover&quot; in his anthology &quot;The Second Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories&quot;.

<doc id="879096" wikidata="Q1156662" url="?curid=879096" title="Karasahr">
<text>Karasahr or Karashar (), which was originally known in the Tocharian languages as Ārśi (or Arshi), Qarašähär, or Agni or the Chinese derivative Yanqi (), is an ancient town on the Silk Road and the capital of Yanqi Hui Autonomous County in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang.

 it had a population of 29,000, growing to 31,773 people in 2006; 16,032 persons of which were Han, 7781 people Hui, 7154 people Uyghur, 628 Mongol and 178 other ethnicities and an agricultural population of 1078 people.

The town has a strategic location, being located on the Kaidu River (known in ancient times as the Liusha), China National Highway 314 and the Southern Xinjiang Railway and is an important material distribution center and regional business hub. The town administers ten communities. It has a predominately Muslim population and contains many mosques.

== Geography ==
The modern town of Yanqi is situated about west of the shallow Lake Bosten. The lake is about east to west and north to south with a surface area of about , making it one of the largest lakes in Xinjiang. It has been noted since Han times for its abundance of fish. The lake is fed by the Kaidu River and the Konqi River flows out of it past Korla and across the Taklamakan Desert to Lop Nur. There are numerous other small lakes in the region.

The city, referred to in classical Chinese sources as Yanqi, was located on the branch of the Silk Route that ran along the northern edge of the Taklamakan Desert in the Tarim Basin.

==History==
The earliest known inhabitants of the area were an Indo-European people who apparently referred to themselves and the city as &quot;Ārśi&quot; (pronounced &quot;Arshi&quot;). Their language, since it was rediscovered in the early 20th century, has been known as &quot;Tocharian A&quot; (a misnomer resulting from an assumed relationship to the Tukhara of Bactria). The people and city were also known as &quot;Agni&quot;, although this may have been a later exonym, derived from the word for &quot;fire&quot; in an Indo-Iranian language such as Sanskrit (cognate to English &quot;ignite&quot;). The 7th century Buddhist monk Xuanzang transliterated &quot;Agni&quot; into Chinese as &quot;O-ki-ni&quot; 阿耆尼 (MC ZS: *&quot;ʔɑ-ɡiɪ-ɳˠiɪ&quot; standard: &quot;Āqíní&quot;).

&quot;Ārśi&quot; was bordered by related Tocharian cultures, many of which also spoke related languages: &quot;Kuča&quot; (or &quot;Kucha&quot;), &quot;Gumo&quot; (later &quot;Aksu&quot;) to the west, &quot;Turfan&quot; (&quot;Turpan&quot;) to the east and to the south, &quot;Krorän&quot; (&quot;Loulan&quot;).

In China, Han dynasty sources describe Yanqi (&quot;Ārśi&quot; / &quot;Agni&quot;) as a relatively large and important neighboring kingdom. According to &quot;Book of Han&quot;, the various states of the &quot;Western Regions&quot;, including Yanqi, were controlled by the nomadic Xiongnu, but later came under the influence of the Han dynasty, following a Han show of force against Dayuan (Fergana) in the late 2nd century BCE.
From the 1st century BCE onwards, many populations in the Tarim Basin, including the &quot;Ārśi&quot; underwent conversion to Buddhism and, consequently, linguistic influence from Indo-Iranian languages, such as Pali, Sanskrit, Bactrian, Gandhari and Khotanese (Saka). The city of &quot;Ārśi&quot; became commonly known as &quot;Agni&quot;, almost certainly derived from the Sanskrit अग्नि &quot;fire&quot;. Names such as &quot;Agnideśa&quot; (अग्निदेश) and &quot;Agni-visaya&quot;, both of which are Sanskrit for &quot;city of fire&quot;, are also recorded in Buddhist scriptures.
According to the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;, General Ban Chao went on a punitive campaign against Yanqi in 94 CE after they attacked and killed the Protector General Chen Mu and Vice Commandant Guo Xun in 75 CE. The king of Yanqi was decapitated and his head displayed in the capital. Later rebellions were subdued by Ban Chao&#x27;s son Ban Yong in 127 CE.
:It has &quot;15,000 households, 52,000 individuals, and more than 20,000 men able to bear arms. It has high mountains on all four sides. There are hazardous passes on the route to Qiuci (Kucha) that are easy to defend. The water of a lake winds between the four mountains, and surrounds the town for more than 30 &quot;li&quot; [12.5 km].&quot;

&quot;Agnideśa&quot; became a tributary state of Tang China in 632 CE. In 644, during the Tang expansion into the Tarim Basin, Emperor Taizong of Tang launched a military campaign against Yanqi after the kingdom allied itself with the Turks. The Four Garrisons of Anxi was established with one based at Yanqi.

According to &quot;Book of Zhou&quot; (636 CE) the kingdom of Yanqi (Karashahr) was a small country with poor people and nine walled towns, and described the country and their custom thus: 
: Marriage is about the same as among the Chinese. All the deceased are cremated and then buried. They wear mourning for seven full days, after which they put it off. The adult men all trim their hair to make a head decoration. Their written characters are the same as those of India.
: It is their custom to serve &quot;Heavenly God(s)&quot; but they also show reverence and trust in the doctrines of the Buddha. They especially celebrate these days: The eighth day of the second month, and the eighth day of the fourth month. All the country abstains and does penance according to the teachings of Śākya, and follows His Way.
: The climate is cold, and the land good and fertile. For cereals, they have rice, millet, pulse, wheat, and barley. For animals, they have camels, horses, cows, and sheep. They raise silk-worms but do not make silk, merely using [the silk fiber] for padding. It is their custom to relish grape wine, and also to love music. It is some ten &quot;li&quot; north of a body of water, and has an abundance of fish, salt, and rushes. In the fourth year of the period Pao-ting, its king sent an envoy to present its renowned horses.
By the mid-9th century, the area had been conquered by the Uyghur Khaganate and the Tocharian languages were fading from use. &quot;Agnideśa&quot; became widely known by the Uyghur Turkic name &quot;Karasahr&quot; (or &quot;Karashar&quot;), meaning &quot;black city&quot;. The influence of Islam grew, while older religions such as Buddhism and Manichaenism declined.

Between the mid-13th century and the 18th century, Karasahr was part of the Mongol Chagatai Khanate.

Karashahr may have been known to late medieval Europeans as &quot;Cialis&quot;, &quot;Chalis&quot;, or &quot;Chialis&quot;, although &quot;Korla&quot;, &quot;Krorän&quot;, and other city names are instead favored by some scholars.

In the early 17th century, the Portuguese Jesuit lay brother Bento de Góis visited the Tarim Basin on his way from India to China (via Kabul and Kashgar). De Góis and his traveling companions spent several months in the &quot;Kingdom of Cialis&quot;, while crossing it with a caravan of Kashgarian merchants (ostensibly, tribute bearers) on their way to Ming China. The travelers stayed in Cialis City for three months in 1605, and then continued, via Turpan and Hami (all parts of the &quot;Kingdom of Cialis&quot;, according to de Góis), to the Ming border at Jiayuguan.

The British traveller Francis Younghusband briefly visited Karasahr in 1887 on his overland journey from Beijing to India. He described it as being &quot;like all the towns hereabouts, is surrounded by a mud wall, and the gateways are surmounted by the usual pagoda-like towers. There is a musketry wall round outside the main wall, but it is now almost in ruins. Inside the wall are some yamens, but only a few houses. Outside, to the south, are a few shops and inns.&quot;

An early-20th-century traveler described the situation in Karashahr as follows:
:&quot;The whole of this district round Kara-shahr and Korla is, from a geographical and political point of view, both interesting and important; for whilst all other parts of Chinese Turkestan can only be reached either by climbing high and difficult passes—the lowest of which has the same elevation as Mont Blanc—or traversing extensive and dangerous waterless deserts of sand-hills, here we find the one and only convenient approach to the land through the valleys of several rivers in the neighbourhood of Ili, where plentiful water abounds in the mountain streams on all sides, and where a rich vegetation makes life possible for wandering tribes. Such Kalmuck tribes still come from the north-west to Tal. They are Torgut nomads who pitch their yurts round about Kara-shahr and live a hard life with their herds ...
:Just as these Mongols wander about here at the present day, so the nomadic tribes of an earlier period must have used this district as their entrance and exit gate. The Tochari (Yue-chi) [Pinyin: Yuezhi], on their way from China, undoubtedly at that time passed through this gate to get into the Ili valley ...&quot;

<text>Yarkant County, also Shache County, also transliterated from Uyghur as Yakan County, is a county in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China, located on the southern rim of the Taklamakan Desert in the Tarim Basin. It is one of 11 counties administered under Kashgar Prefecture. The county, usually referred to as Yarkand in English, was the seat of an ancient Buddhist kingdom on the southern branch of the Silk Road and the Yarkand Khanate. The county sits at an altitude of and had a population of .

The fertile oasis is fed by the Yarkand River, which flows north down from the Karakorum mountains and passes through the Kunlun Mountains, known historically as the Congling mountains (lit. &#x27;Onion Mountains&#x27; - from the abundance of wild onions found there). The oasis now covers , but was likely far more extensive before a period of desiccation affected the region from the 3rd century CE onwards.

Today, Yarkant is a predominantly Uyghur settlement. The irrigated oasis farmland produces cotton, wheat, corn, fruits (especially pomegranates, pears and apricots) and walnuts. Yak and sheep graze in the highlands. Mineral deposits include petroleum, natural gas, gold, copper, lead, bauxite, granite and coal.

==History==

===Han dynasty===
The territory of Yārkand is first mentioned in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; (1st century BCE) as &quot;Shaju&quot; (Old Chinese, approximately, *s³a(j)-ka), which is probably related to the name of the Iranian Saka tribes.
Descriptions in the &quot;Hou Hanshu&quot; (&#x27;History of the Later Han&#x27;) contain insights into the complex political situation China faced in attempting to open up the &quot;Silk Routes&quot; to the West in the 1st century CE. According to the &quot;Chapter on the Western Regions&quot; in the &quot;Hou Hanshu&quot;:

:&quot;Going west from the kingdom of Suoju (Yarkand), and passing through the countries of Puli (Tashkurghan) and Wulei (centred on Sarhad in the Wakhan), you arrive among the Da Yuezhi (Kushans). To the east, it is 10,950 li (4,553 km) from Luoyang.

:The Chanyu (Khan) of the Xiongnu took advantage of the chaos caused by Wang Mang (9-24 CE) and invaded the Western Regions. Only Yan, the king of Suoju, who was more powerful than the others, did not consent to being annexed. Previously, during the time of Emperor Yuan (48-33 BCE), he was a hostage prince and grew up in the capital. He admired and loved the Middle Kingdom and extended the rules of Chinese administration to his own country. He ordered all his sons to respectfully serve the Han dynasty generation by generation, and to never turn their backs on it. Yan died in the fifth Tianfeng year (18 CE). He was awarded the posthumous title of &#x27;Faithful and Martial King&#x27;. His son, Kang, succeeded him on the throne.

:At the beginning of Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s reign (25-57 CE), Kang led the neighboring kingdoms to resist the Xiongnu. He escorted, and protected, more than a thousand people including the officers, the soldiers, the wife and children of the former Protector General. He sent a letter to Hexi (Chinese territory west of the Yellow River) to inquire about the activities of the Middle Kingdom, and personally expressed his attachment to, and admiration for, the Han dynasty.

:In the fifth Jianwu year (29 CE) the General-in-Chief of Hexi, Dou Rong, following Imperial instructions, bestowed on Kang the titles of: &quot;King of Chinese Suoju, Performer of Heroic Deeds Who Cherishes Virtue [and] Commandant-in-Chief of the Western Regions.&quot; The fifty-five kingdoms were all made dependencies after that.

:In the ninth year (33 CE) Kang died. He was awarded the title of &quot;Greatly Accomplished King.&quot; His younger brother, Xian, succeeded him on the throne. Xian attacked and conquered the kingdoms of Jumi (Keriya) and Xiye (Karghalik). He killed both their kings, and installed two sons of his elder brother, Kang, as the kings of Jumi and Xiye.

:In the fourteenth year (38 CE), together with An, the king of Shanshan (the Lop Nor region), he sent envoys to the Imperial Palace to offer tribute. Following this, the Western Regions were (again) in communication with China. All the kingdoms to the east of the Congling (Pamirs) were dependent on Xian.

:In the seventeenth year (41 CE), Xian again sent an envoy to present offerings [to the Emperor], and to ask that a Protector General be appointed. The Son of Heaven questioned the Excellency of Works, Dou Rong, about this. He was of the opinion that Xian, and his sons and brothers who had pledged to serve the Han were truly sincere. Therefore, [he suggested that] it would be appropriate to give him higher rank to maintain order and security.
:The Emperor then, using the same envoy that Xian had sent to him, bestowed upon him the seal and ribbon of &quot;Protector General of the Western Regions,&quot; and gave him chariots, standards, gold, brocades and embroideries.

&quot;Pei Zun, the Administrator of Dunhuang, wrote saying that foreigners should not be allowed to employ such great authority and that these decrees would cause the kingdoms to despair. An Imperial decree then ordered that the seal and ribbons of &quot;Protector General&quot; be recovered, and replaced with the seal and ribbon of &quot;Great Han General.&quot; Xian&#x27;s envoy refused to make the exchange, and (Pei) Zun took them by force.

:Consequently, Xian became resentful. Furthermore, he falsely named himself &quot;Great Protector General,&quot; and sent letters to all the kingdoms. They all submitted to him, and bestowed the title of Chanyu on him. Xian gradually became arrogant making heavy demands for duties and taxes. Several times he attacked Qiuci (Kucha) and the other kingdoms. All the kingdoms were anxious and fearful.

:In the winter of the twenty-first year (45 CE), eighteen kings, including the king of Nearer Jushi (Turpan), Shanshan, Yanqi (Karashahr), and others, sent their sons to enter the service of the Emperor and offered treasure. As a result, they were granted audience when they circulated weeping, prostrating with their foreheads to the ground, in the hope of obtaining a Protector General. The Son of Heaven, considering that the Middle Kingdom was just beginning to return to peace and that the northern frontier regions were still unsettled, returned all the hostage princes with generous gifts.

:At the same time, Xian, infatuated with his military power, wanted to annex the Western Regions, and greatly increased his attacks. The kingdoms, informed that no Protector General would be sent, and that the hostage princes were all returning, were very worried and frightened. Therefore, they sent a letter to the Administrator of Dunhuang to ask him to detain their hostage sons with him, so that they could point this out to the [king of] Suoju (Yarkand), and tell him that their young hostage sons were detained because a Protector General was to be sent. Then he [the king of Yarkand] would stop his hostilities. Pei Zun sent an official report informing the Emperor [of this proposal], which he approved.

:In the twenty-second year (46 CE) Xian, aware that no Protector General was coming, sent a letter to An, king of Shanshan, ordering him to cut the route to the Han. An did not accept [this order], and killed the envoy. Xian was furious and sent soldiers to attack Shanshan. An gave battle but was defeated and fled into the mountains. Xian killed or captured more than a thousand men, and then withdrew.
:That winter (46 CE), Xian returned and attacked Qiuci (Kucha), killed the king, and annexed the kingdom. The hostage princes of Shanshan, and then Yanqi (Karashahr) and the other kingdoms, were detained a long time at Dunhuang and became worried, so they fled and returned [to their kingdoms].

:The king of Shanshan wrote a letter to the Emperor expressing his desire to return his son to enter the service of the Emperor, and again pleaded for a Protector General, saying that if a Protector General were not sent, he would be forced to obey the Xiongnu. The Son of Heaven replied:

::&quot;We are not able, at the moment, to send out envoys and Imperial troops so, in spite of their good wishes, each kingdom [should seek help], as they please, wherever they can, to the east, west, south, or north.&quot;

:Following this, Shanshan, and Jushi (Turpan/Jimasa) again submitted to the Xiongnu. Meanwhile, Xian became increasingly violent.

:The king of Guisai, reckoning that his kingdom was far enough away, killed Xian&#x27;s envoy. Xian then attacked and killed him. He appointed a nobleman from that country, Sijian, king of Guisai. Furthermore, Xian appointed his own son, Zeluo, to be king of Qiuci (Kucha). Xian, taking account of the youth of Zeluo, detached a part of the territory from Qiuci (Kucha) from which he made the kingdom of Wulei (Yengisar). He transferred Sijian to the post of king of Wulei, and appointed another noble to the post of king of Guisai.

:Several years later, the people of the kingdom of Qiuci (Kucha), killed Zeluo and Sijian, and sent envoys to the Xiongnu to ask them to appoint a king to replace them. The Xiongnu established a nobleman of Qiuci (Kucha), Shendu, to be king of Qiuci (Kucha), making it dependent on the Xiongnu.

:Because Dayuan (Ferghana) had reduced their tribute and taxes, Xian personally took command of several tens of thousands of men taken from several kingdoms, and attacked Dayuan (Ferghana). Yanliu, the king of Dayuan, came before him to submit. Xian took advantage of this to take him back to his own kingdom. Then he transferred Qiaosaiti, the king of Jumi (Keriya), to the post of king of Dayuan (Ferghana). Then Kangju (Tashkent plus the Chu, Talas, and middle Jaxartes basins) attacked him there several times and Qiaosaiti fled home [to Keriya] more than a year later. Xian appointed him king of Jumi (Keriya) and sent Yanliu back to Dayuan again, ordering him to bring the customary tribute and offerings.

:Xian also banished the king of Yutian (Khotan), Yulin, to be king of Ligui and set up his younger brother, Weishi, as king of Yutian.

:More than a year later Xian became suspicious that the kingdoms wanted to rebel against him. He summoned Weishi, and the kings of Jumi (Keriya), Gumo (Aksu), and Zihe (Shahidulla), and killed them all. He did not set up any more kings, he just sent generals to maintain order and guard these kingdoms. Rong, the son of Weishi, fled and made submission to the Han, who named him: &quot;Marquis Who Maintains Virtue.&quot; A general from Suoju (Yarkand), named Junde, had been posted to Yutian (Khotan), and tyrannised the people there who became indignant.
:In the third Yongping year (60 CE), during the reign of Emperor Ming, a high official of this country, called Dumo, had left town when he saw a wild pig. He wanted to shoot it, but the pig said to him: &quot;Do not shoot me, I will undertake to kill Junde for you.&quot; Following this, Dumo plotted with his brothers and killed Junde. However, another high official, Xiumo Ba, plotted, in his turn, with a Chinese man, Han Rong, and others, to kill Dumo and his brothers, then he named himself king of Yutian (Khotan). Together with men from the kingdom of Jumi (Keriya), he attacked and killed the Suoju (Yarkand) general who was at Pishan (modern Pishan or Guma). He then returned with the soldiers.

:Then Xian sent his Heir Apparent, and his State Chancellor, leading 20,000 soldiers from several kingdoms, to attack Xiumo Ba. [Xiumo] Ba came to meet them and gave battle, defeating the soldiers of Suoju (Yarkand) who fled, and more than 10,000 of them were killed.

:Xian again fielded several tens of thousands of men from several kingdoms, and personally led them to attack Xiumo Ba. [Xiumo] Ba was again victorious and beheaded more than half of the enemy. Xian escaped and fled, returning to his kingdom. Xiumo Ba advanced and encircled Suoju (Yarkand), but he was hit and killed by an arrow, and his soldiers retreated to Yutian (Khotan).

:Suyule, State Chancellor [of Khotan], and others, appointed Guangde, the son of Xiumo Ba&#x27;s elder brother, king. The Xiongnu, with Qiuci (Kucha) and the other kingdoms, attacked Suoju (Yarkand), but were unable to take it.

:Later, Guangde recognising of the exhaustion of Suoju (Yarkand), sent his younger brother, the Marquis who Supports the State, Ren, commanding an army, to attack Xian. As he had suffered war continuously, Xian sent an envoy to make peace with Guangde. Guangde&#x27;s father had previously been detained for several years in Suoju (Yarkand). Xian returned Guangde&#x27;s father and also gave one of his daughters in marriage and swore brotherhood to Guangde, so the soldiers withdrew and left.

:In the following year (61 CE), Qieyun, the Chancellor of Suoju (Yarkand), and others, worried by Xian&#x27;s arrogance, plotted to get the town to submit to Yutian (Khotan). Guangde, the king of Yutian (Khotan), then led 30,000 men from several kingdoms to attack Suoju (Yarkand). Xian stayed in the town to defend it and sent a messenger to say to Guangde: &quot;I have given you your father and a wife. Why are you attacking me?&quot; Guangde replied to him: &quot;O king, you are the father of my wife. It has been a long time since we met. I want us to meet, each of us escorted by only two men, outside the town wall to make an alliance.&quot;

:Xian consulted Qieyun about this. Qieyun said to him: &quot;Guangde, your son-in-law is a very close relation; you should go out to see him.&quot; Xian then rashly went out. Guangde advanced and captured him. In addition, Qieyun and his colleagues let the soldiers of Yutian (Khotan) into the town to capture Xian&#x27;s wife and children. (Guangde) annexed his kingdom. He put Xian in chains, and took him home with him. More than a year later, he killed him.

:When the Xiongnu heard that Guangde had defeated Suoju (Yarkand), they sent five generals leading more than 30,000 men from fifteen kingdoms including Yanqi (Karashahr), Weili (Korla), and Qiuci (Kucha), to besiege Yutian (Khotan). Guangde asked to submit. He sent his Heir Apparent as a hostage and promised to give felt carpets each year. In winter, the Xiongnu ordered soldiers to take Xian&#x27;s son, Bujuzheng, who was a hostage with them, to appoint him king of Suoju (Yarkand).

:Guangde then attacked and killed [Bujuzheng], and put his younger brother, Qili, on the throne. This was in the third Yuanhe year (86 CE) of Emperor Zhang.

:At this time Chief Clerk Ban Chao brought the troops of several kingdoms to attack Suoju (Yarkand). He soundly defeated Suoju (Yarkand) so it submitted to Han.&quot;

In 90 CE the Yuezhi or Kushans invaded the region with an army of reportedly 70,000 men, under their Viceroy, Xian, but they were forced to withdraw without a battle after Ban Chao instigated a &quot;burnt earth&quot; policy.

After the Yuanchu period (114-120 CE), when the Yuezhi or Kushans placed a hostage prince on the throne of Kashgar:

:&quot;... Suoju [Yarkand] followed by resisting Yutian [Khotan], and put themselves under Shule [Kashgar]. Thus Shule [Kashgar], became powerful and a rival to Qiuci [Kucha] and Yutian [Khotan].&quot;

:&quot;In the second Yongjian year [127 CE] of the reign of Emperor Shun, [Ban] Yong once again attacked and subdued Yanqi [Karashahr]; and then Qiuci [Kucha], Shule [Kashgar], Yutian [Khotan], Suoju [Yarkand], and other kingdoms, seventeen altogether, came to submit. Following this, the Wusun [Ili River Basin and Issyk Kul], and the countries of the Congling [Pamir Mountains], put an end to their disruptions to communications with the west.&quot;

In 130 CE, Yarkand, along with Ferghana and Kashgar, sent tribute and offerings to the Chinese Emperor.

===Later history===
There is very little information on Yarkant&#x27;s history for many centuries, apart from a couple of brief references in Tang dynasty (618-907) histories and it appears to have been of less note than the oasis of Kharghalik (see Yecheng and Yecheng County) to its south.

The area became the main base in the region for Chagatai Khan (died 1241), who inherited Kashgaria (and also much of the land between the Oxus (Amu Darya) and Jaxartes (Syr Darya) rivers) after his father, Genghis Khan, died in 1227.

Marco Polo described Yarkant in 1273, but said only that this &quot;province&quot; (of Kublai Khan&#x27;s nephew, Kaidu, d. 1301) was, &quot;five days&#x27; journey in extent. The inhabitants follow the law of Mahomet, and there are also some Nestorian Christians. They are subject to the Great Khan&#x27;s nephew. It is amply stocked with the means of life, especially cotton.&quot;

At the end of the 16th century Yarkant was incorporated into the Khanate of Kashgar and became its capital. The Jesuit Benedict Göez, who sought a route from the Mughal Empire to Cathay (which, according to his superiors, may or may not have been the same place as China), arrived in Yarkant with a caravan from Kabul in late 1603. He remained there for about a year, making a short trip to Khotan during that time. He reported:

:&quot;Hiarchan [Yarkant], the capital of the kingdom of Cascar, is a mart of much note, both for the great concourse of merchants, and for the variety of wares. At this capital the caravan of Kabul merchants reaches its terminus; and a new one is formed for the journey to Cathay. The command of this caravan is sold by the king, who invests the chiefs with a kind of royal authority over the merchants for the whole journey. A twelvemonth passed away however before the new company was formed, for the way is long and perilous, and the caravan is not formed every year, but only when a large number arrange to join it, and when it is known that they will be allowed to enter Cathay.&quot;

During his journey, Göez also noted the presence of large marble quarries in the area, leading him to write that amongst native travellers from Yarkant to Cathay:
:&quot;no article of traffic is more valuable or more generally adopted as an investment for this journey than lumps of a certain transparent kind of marble called by the Chinese &quot;jusce&quot; (jade). They carry these to the Emperor of Cathay, attracted by the high prices which he deems it obligatory on his dignity to give ; and such pieces as the Emperor does not fancy they are free to dispose of to private individuals.&quot;

===Yarkent Khanate===
Yarkent served as capital for the Yarkent Khanate, also known as &quot;Yarkent State&quot;, from the establishment of Yarkent Khanate to its fall (1514–1713).

The Khanate was predominantly Uyghur/Turki; some of its most populated cities were Hotan, Yarkent, Kashgar, Yangihissar, Aksu, Uchturpan, Kucha, Karashar, Turpan and Kumul. It enjoyed continued dominance in the region for about 200 years until it was conquered by the Dzungar Khan, Tsewang Rabtan in 1705.

In the first half of the 14th century the Chagatai Khanate had collapsed; on the western part of the collapsed Chagatai Khanate, the Empire of Timur emerged in 1370, and became the dominant power in the region until its conquest in 1508 by the Shaybanids. Its eastern part became Moghulistan, which was created by Tughluk Timur Khan in 1347 with the capital centered in Almalik, around the Ili River Valley. It comprised all the settled lands of Eastern Kashgaria, as well as regions of Turpan and Kumul which were known at the time as Uyghurstan, according to Balkh and Indian sources of the 16th and 17th centuries. The reigning dynasty of the Yarkent Khanate originated from this state, which existed for more than a century.

In 1509 the Dughlats, vassal rulers of the Tarim basin, rebelled against the Moghulistan Khanate and broke away. Five years later Sultan Said Khan, a brother of the Khan of Moghulistan in Turfan, conquered the Dughlats but established his own Yarkent khanate instead.

This put an end to the dominance in the cities of Kashgaria of the Dughlat emirs, who had controlled them since 1220, when most of Kashgaria had been granted to the Dughlat by Chagatai Khan himself. The conquest of the Dughlats allowed the Yarkent state to become the foremost power in the region.

===Qing dynasty===
 

The Qing dynasty gained control of the region in the middle of the 18th century.

By the 19th century, due to its active trade with Ladakh, and an influx of foreign merchants, it became &quot;the largest and most populous of all the States of Káshghar.&quot;(Kashgar). Yakub Beg (1820–1877) conquered Khotan, Aksu, Kashgar, and neighbouring towns with the help of the Russians in the 1860s. He made Yarkant the capital of the newly founded Turkic state of Yettishar, where he received embassies from England in 1870 and 1873. The Qing dynasty defeated Yakub at Turpan in 1877 after which he committed suicide. Thus ended the Yettishar kingdom, and the region returned to Qing Chinese control. 

Chinese merchants and soldiers, foreigners like Russians, foreign Muslims, and other Turki merchants all engaged in temporary marriages with Turki (Uyghur) women, since a lot of foreigners lived in Yarkand, temporary marriage flourished there more than it did towards areas with fewer foreigners like areas towards Kucha&#x27;s east. The Earl of Dunmore wrote in 1894:

&quot;Almost every Chinaman in Yarkand, soldier or civilian, takes unto himself a temporary wife, dispensing entirely with the services of the clergy, as being superfluous, and most of the high officials also give way to the same amiable weakness, their mistresses being in almost all cases natives of Khotan, which city enjoys the unenviable distinction of supplying every large city in Turkestan with courtesans.&quot;

&quot;When a Chinaman is called back to his own home in China proper, or a Chinese soldier has served his time in Turkestan and has to return to his native city of Pekin or Shanghai, he either leaves his temporary wife behind to shift for herself, or he sells her to a friend. If he has a family he takes the boys with him~—if he can afford it—failing that, the sons are left alone and unprotected to fight the battle of life, While in the case of daughters, he sells them to one of his former companions for a trifling sum.&quot;

&quot;The natives, although all Mahammadans, have a strong predilection for the Chinese, and seem to like their manners and customs, and never seem to resent this behaviour to their womankind, their own manners, customs, and morals (?) being of the very loosest description.&quot;
===Twentieth century===


The Battle of Yarkand took place in Yarkant county, in April 1934. Ma Zhancang&#x27;s Chinese Muslim army defeated the Turkic Uighur and Kirghiz army, and the Afghan volunteers sent by king Mohammed Zahir Shah, and exterminated them all. The emir Abdullah Bughra was killed and beheaded, his head was sent to Idgah mosque.

Almost all the ancient buildings of the old city were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1968) with only the central mosque, the main gate of the old palace and the royal cemetery surviving.

Violent clashes occurred in the county in the summer of 2014, in which dozens of people were killed according to local officials, though some estimates claim the death toll to be as high as 3,000.

In August 2015, it was reported by Chinese media that the amount of farmland per capita was increased from 2.6 mu per person to 3.5 mu after clearing up more arable lands.

==Geography==
Yarkant is strategically located about halfway between Kashgar and Khotan, at the junction of a branch road north to Aksu. It also was the terminus for caravans coming from Kashmir via Ladakh and then over the Karakoram Pass to the oasis of Niya in the Tarim Basin. The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway China National Highway 219, built in 1956 commences in Yecheng/Yarkant and heads south and west, across Aksai Chin and into central Tibet.

From Yarkant another important route headed southwest via Tashkurgan Town to the Wakhan corridor from where travellers could cross the relatively easy Baroghil Pass and Badakshan.

===Climate===
As with much of southern Xinjiang, Yarkant has a temperate zone, continental desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;), with a mean total of only of precipitation per annum. As spring and autumn are short, winter and summer are the main seasons. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July; the annual mean is . The diurnal temperature variation is not particularly large for a desert, averaging annually. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 56% in March to 75% in October, the county seat receives 2,860 hours of bright sunshine annually.

==Administrative divisions==
Yarkant County includes 5 subdistricts, 14 towns, 14 townships, and 1 ethnic township.

==Economy==
Yarkant County is an important producer of wheat, corn, rice, rapeseed, and cotton in southern Xinjiang. The area also produces grapes, rugs, and leather products. Industries include electronics, coal, silk, tractor repair, and cotton and cooking oil processing.

In 1885 there was about 154,600 acres (1,021,500 &quot;mu&quot;) of cultivated land in Yarkant.

==Demographics==
As of 2015, 818,379 of the 851,374 residents of the county were Uyghur, 25,404 were Han Chinese and 7,591 were from other ethnic groups.

As of 1999, 95.71% of the population of Yarkant (Shache) County was Uyghur and 3.47% of the population was Han Chinese.

<doc id="879119" wikidata="Q6474536" url="?curid=879119" title="The House of Mirth">
<text>The House of Mirth is a novel by American author Edith Wharton, published on 14 October 1905. It tells the story of Lily Bart, a well-born but impoverished woman belonging to New York City&#x27;s high society in the 1890s. &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; traces Lily&#x27;s slow two-year social descent from privilege to a lonely existence on the margins of society. In the words of one scholar, Wharton uses Lily as an attack on &quot;an irresponsible, grasping and morally corrupt upper class.&quot;

Before publication as a book on October 14, 1905, &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; was serialized in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; beginning in January 1905. Charles Scribner wrote Wharton in November 1905 that the novel was showing &quot;the most rapid sale of any book ever published by Scribner.&quot; By the end of December, sales had reached 140,000 copies. Wharton&#x27;s royalties were valued at more than half a million dollars in today&#x27;s currency. The commercial and critical success of &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; solidified Wharton&#x27;s reputation as a major novelist.

Because of the novel&#x27;s commercial success, some critics classified it as a genre novel. Literary reviewers and critics at the time categorized it as both a social satire and novel of manners. When describing it in her introduction to &quot;Edith Wharton&#x27;s The House of Mirth: A Case Book&quot;, Carol Singley states that the novel &quot;is a unique blend of romance, realism, and naturalism, [and thus] transcends the narrow classification of a novel of manners.&quot;
&quot;The House of Mirth&quot; was Wharton&#x27;s second published novel, preceded by two novellas, &quot;The Touchstone&quot; (1900) and &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1903), and a novel, &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot; (1902).

==Background, theme, and purpose==
Wharton considered several titles for the novel about Lily Bart; two were germane to her purpose:

&quot;A Moment&#x27;s Ornament&quot; appears in the first stanza of William Wordsworth&#x27;s (1770–1850) poem, &quot;She was a Phantom of Delight&quot; (1804), that describes an ideal of feminine beauty: 


&quot;A moment&#x27;s ornament&quot; represents the way Wharton describes Lily&#x27;s relationship to her reference group as a beautiful and well-bred socialite. Her value lasts only as long as her beauty and good-standing with the group is maintained. By centering the story around a portrait of Lily, Wharton was able to address directly the social limitations imposed upon her. These included the mores of the upper crust social class to which Lily belonged by birth, education, and breeding.

The final title Wharton chose for the novel was &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; (1905), taken from the Old Testament:

&quot;The House of Mirth&quot; spotlights social context as equally important to the development of the story&#x27;s purpose, as the heroine. &quot;Mirth&quot; contrasted with &quot;mourning&quot; also bespeaks a moral purpose as it underscores the frivolity of a social set that not only worships money, but also uses it ostentatiously solely for its own amusement and aggrandizement. At the time the novel takes place, Old New York high society was peopled by the extraordinarily wealthy who were conditioned by the economic and social changes the Gilded Age (1870–1900) wrought. Wharton&#x27;s birth around the time of the Civil War predates that period by a little less than a decade. As a member of the privileged Old New York society, she was eminently qualified to describe it authentically. She also had license to criticize the ways New York high society of the 1890s had changed without being vulnerable to accusations of envy motivated by coming from a lower social caste. She accused her peers of having lost the sense of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; of their forebears.

Wharton revealed in her introduction to the 1936 reprint of &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; her choice of subject and her major theme:

Wharton figured that no one had written about New York society because it offered nothing worth writing about. But that did not deter her as she thought something of value could be mined there. If only the writer could dig deeply enough below the surface, some &quot;stuff o&#x27; the conscience&quot; could be found. She went on to declare unabashedly that:

The central theme of &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; is essentially the struggle between who we are and what society tells us we should be. Thus, it is considered by many to be as relevant today as it was in 1905. If its sole subject had been the excesses and lives of the rich and famous, by themselves, it is doubtful it would have remained popular for as long as it has. &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; continues to attract readers over a century after its first publication, possibly due to its timeless theme. That the life and death of Lily Bart matters to modern readers suggests that Wharton succeeded in her purpose: to critique &quot;a society so relentlessly materialistic and self-serving that it casually destroys what is most beautiful and blameless within it.&quot;

==Plot==

Lily Bart, aged 29, is an impoverished socialite who seeks a husband to secure her future. Her success is challenged by her advancing age — at twenty-nine, she has been on the &quot;marriage market&quot; for more than ten years — and her debts from gambling at bridge. Lily admires lawyer Lawrence Selden, but he is too poor for her to seriously consider marrying; instead, her only prospects are the coarse and vulgar Simon Rosedale, a financier, and the wealthy but dull Percy Gryce.

Lily grew up surrounded by elegance and luxury — an atmosphere which she believes she cannot live without. The loss of her father&#x27;s wealth, coupled with the death of her parents, left her an orphan at twenty. Lacking an inheritance or a caring protector, she adapts to life as a ward of her strait-laced aunt, Julia Peniston, from whom she receives an erratic allowance, a fashionable address, and food, but little direction or parenting. Lily loathes the neglectful Julia but is forced to rely on her for her necessities and luxuries.

Lily learns that Selden and heiress Bertha Dorset were once lovers. She also confides her money problems to Gus Trenor, a stockbroker and the husband of her childhood friend Judy, receiving from him a check for $5,000 and an investment of $4,000 in her name. Trenor tries to exploit his generosity to make a romantic move, but Lily spurns his attentions. Bertha still has feelings for Lawrence notwithstanding her recent breakup with him. Selden still has feelings for Lily and aims to ruin the latter&#x27;s budding romance with Percy by filling him in on salacious and scandalous rumors about Lily&#x27;s card-playing and past romantic life. This effectively frightens Percy away. Lily, unaware of Bertha&#x27;s machinations, blames Judy for having been the one to set the match up.

In retribution for a social snub, Lily&#x27;s cousin Grace Stepney informs Julia of rumors that Lily is having an affair with Gus to obtain money so she can pay off her gambling debts. This plants seeds of doubt and discomfort in Julia who, though shocked, chooses to accept the rumors without speaking to her niece. Furthermore, Lily has soured her relationships with both Gus, who is angered by her spurning him, and Judy, because she refuses to visit her at Bellomont lest Gus confront her and reveal that she had manipulated him for financial gain.

To avoid having to spend time alone with Julia, the Trenors, Simon Rosedale, or anyone else she considers a possible source of embarrassment or boredom, Lily begins to accept invitations from people with whom she would not ordinarily socialize. These include the Wellington Brys, who are newcomers to the New York social scene, and whose social rise is being engineered by Carry Fisher. Carry, a fallen aristocrat who supports herself by acting as a social secretary to usher newly wealthy people into fashionable society, invites Lily to social events hosted by Louisa Bry. Lily also attends the opera with Carry, Simon, and Gus. In the eyes of high society, Lily cheapens herself by voluntarily associating with her social inferiors. She returns to Bellomont only to find that her peers now look at her with derision and disgust.

One of Julia&#x27;s temporary servants, who is also the charwoman at Selden&#x27;s apartment, sells Lily a package of torn love letters. These were written by Bertha Dorset years earlier, and they represent a chance for Lily to deal with her enemy. But instead of blackmailing Bertha into a positive relationship, Lily tries to neutralize the gossip by making herself useful to Bertha. Bertha, who is in a sexual relationship with Ned Silverton, relies on Lily to distract her husband, George.
The extent to which Lily&#x27;s reputation is damaged becomes obvious when she publicly appears in a way that comes across as advertising her availability for an illicit relationship. Following Carry&#x27;s advice, the Wellington Brys throw a large &quot;general entertainment&quot; featuring portrayed by a dozen fashionable women in their set, including Miss Bart.

The of this successful event turns out to be the portrayal of Mrs. Lloyd in Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27; famous 18th-century painting (1775–1776). The portrait shows a woman suggestively clad. As the curtain opens on this last scene, the gasp of approval heard from the audience is not so much for Reynolds&#x27; interpretation of Mrs. Lloyd as it is for the loveliness of Lily Bart herself — marking the pinnacle of her social success but also the annihilation of whatever reputation is left to her. For better or for worse, she has transitioned from a marriageable &quot;girl&quot; to a not-quite-reputable woman similar to Carry Fisher. Yet she does not do as Carry Fisher does and accept the loss of her respectability as the price she must pay to maintain a position in society.

As Selden observes her in the &quot;tableau&quot;, he sees the real Lily Bart as if for the first time and feels the desire to be with her. He finds her alone in the ballroom toward the end of the musical interlude, as the collective praise from her admirers is subsiding. Selden leads her to a garden and tells her that he loves her. They eventually kiss. Lily sighs, &quot; &#x27;Ah, love me, love me—but don&#x27;t tell me so!&#x27; &quot; and takes her leave. As Selden gathers his coat to leave, he is disturbed by Ned Van Alstyne&#x27;s remarks, &quot;. . . .Gad, what a show of good-looking women; but not one of &#x27;em could touch that little cousin of mine. . . . I never knew till tonight what an outline Lily has.&quot;

Lily pleads with Julia to help settle her debts and confesses her addiction to gambling. Julia feels taken advantage of and refuses to help, except to cover the bill for her clothes and accessories. Feeling trapped and disgraced, Lily turns to thoughts of Selden as her savior and has a change of heart towards him as she looks forward to his next visit at four o&#x27;clock.

Instead, her visitor turns out to be Simon Rosedale who, smitten by her appearance in the &quot;tableau,&quot; proposes a marriage that would be mutually beneficial. Considering what Rosedale knows about her, she pleads for time to consider his offer. Selden does not appear for his 4:00 appointment nor does he send word in explanation. Instead, he has departed for Havana and then on to Europe for a business trip.

To escape the rumors arising from the gossip caused by her financial dealings with Gus, and also disappointed by what she interprets as Selden&#x27;s emotional withdrawal, Lily accepts Bertha&#x27;s spur-of-the-moment invitation to join her and George on a Mediterranean cruise aboard their yacht; Lily is expected once again to hide Bertha&#x27;s affair. Lily&#x27;s decision to accept the offer proves to be her social undoing.

To divert the attention and suspicion of their social circle away from her, Bertha insinuates that Lily is carrying on a romantic and sexual liaison with George by instructing her not to sleep on the yacht in front of their friends at the close of a dinner the Brys held for the Duchess in Monte Carlo. Selden inadvertently helps by arranging a night&#x27;s lodging, under the promise that she leave in the morning. The ensuing social scandal ruins Lily&#x27;s reputation and causes friends to abandon her and Julia to disinherit her.

Undeterred, Lily fights to regain her place in high society by advising Mr. and Mrs. Gormer on their entry into the aristocracy, but when the couple learn of the &quot;scandalous&quot; personal background of their new secretary, they chase her out rather than risk losing their new standing. Only two friends remain for Lily: Gerty Farish (a cousin of Lawrence Selden) and Carry, who help her cope with the social ignominy of a degraded social status while continually advising Lily to marry soon.

Despite the efforts of both Carry and Farish, Lily descends through the social strata of New York City&#x27;s high society. She obtains a job as personal secretary of Mrs. Hatch, a disreputable woman who nearly succeeds in marrying a wealthy young man in Lily&#x27;s former social circle. During this occupation, she is introduced to the use of chloral hydrate, sold in drugstores, as a remedy for malaise. Selden warns her that working for Mrs Hatch is putting her in a false position, and once she realises the truth of this, Lily resigns. She then finds a job in a milliner&#x27;s shop; unaccustomed to working-class manual labor, her rate of production is low, and the quality of her workmanship is poor, exacerbated by her increased use of the drug. She is fired at the end of the New York social season, when the demand for fashionable hats has diminished.

Meanwhile, Simon reappears in her life and tries to rescue her, but Lily is unwilling to meet his terms. Simon wants Lily to use the love letters that she bought from Selden&#x27;s servant to expose the love affair between Lawrence and Bertha, thus crushing a potential rival and allowing him to further ascend up the social ladder. For the sake of Selden&#x27;s reputation, Lily does not act upon Rosedale&#x27;s request and secretly burns the letters when she visits Selden one last time.

Lily is stopped on the street by Nettie Struther, who Lily once helped get to a sanatorium. Nettie is now married and has a baby girl. Touched by Lily&#x27;s exhausted state, and eager to show her how she has profited from her help, she invites her back to her modest tenement home, and introduces her to the baby.

Eventually, Lily receives a ten-thousand-dollar inheritance following Julia&#x27;s death, which she uses to repay Gus. Distraught by her misfortunes, Lily is now crippled by drug dependence. Once she has repaid all her debts, Lily takes an overdose and dies; perhaps it is suicide, perhaps an accident. While dying, she hallucinates cradling Nettie&#x27;s baby in her arms. That morning, Lawrence arrives at her quarters to propose marriage, but finds Lily dead. Among her belongings are bank receipts proving that her dealings with Gus were honorable and that the rumors that destroyed her were always false. This realization allows a distraught Selden to feel sympathy for her.

==Characters==
Lily Bart — Wharton paints Lily, the 29-year-old heroine of her novel, as a complex personality with a given name that suggests purity and a surname that implies defiance, and the foolishness that the title of the novel implies. The combination of the social pressures and conventions of her reference group and her refusal to &quot;settle&quot; numerous times to save herself portend a fateful destiny where she becomes complicit in her own destruction. Wharton depicts Lily as having an aesthetic purpose in life—a fine specimen to be looked at and admired. Her extraordinary beauty should have served her well to find a wealthy husband with the requisite social status that would have secured her place in upper-class New York society. However, her inner longing to become free of her society&#x27;s social conventions, her sense of what is right, and her desire for love as well as money and status have thwarted her success in spite of a number of eligible admirers over the ten years she has been on the marriage market. Challenges to her success are her advancing age—she is 29 as the novel begins—the loss of her father&#x27;s wealth, and the death of her parents which has left her orphaned without a caring protector, her constant efforts to &quot;keep up with the Joneses&quot;(4), the very modest but erratic &quot;allowance&quot; from her strait-laced Aunt Julia, and her gambling debts which make her the subject of vile gossip. To protect Lawrence Selden&#x27;s reputation, she refuses to use damning evidence against her nemesis, Bertha Dorset, which would have recouped her ruined social standing. This leads to a tragic yet heroic ending.

Lawrence Selden — A young lawyer who, although not wealthy himself, is able to move easily within and without Old New York&#x27;s elite social circles through kinship with old-line New York families. He has known Lily since her &quot;coming out&quot; eleven years earlier. For all this time he has been in the background of her life. He views the comings and goings of New York&#x27;s high society with the detachment and the objectivity of an outsider —a characteristic that Lily not only admires but also that allows her to view those people in her surroundings in an objective, critical and a not-so-flattering way. She becomes fascinated and envies his independence from the &quot;tribe&quot; and the freedom that has given him. Her encounters with Selden underscore the conflict between her inner voice —her self-hood at its core— and the outer voices of her reference group. It is from Selden&#x27;s description, assessment and admiration of Lily&#x27;s outward characteristics that we glean those attributes that contribute to New York high society&#x27;s perception and misperceptions of who she is. He can be brutally honest about Lily&#x27;s superficiality and artificiality and simultaneously appreciate the sparks of freedom and spontaneity that temper these negatives. These mutual admirable qualities give way to their romantic regard for one another. He is not, however, free from the social pressure of rumor. Though he has shown Lily consistent friendship, he abandons her when she becomes the victim of appearances that put her virtue, as an unmarried woman, in question.

Simon Rosedale — A successful and socially astute Jewish businessman—the quintessential —who has the money but not the social standing to be accepted into the circle of New York&#x27;s leisure class. Building his fortune in real estate, Rosedale makes his first appearance in the story when he observes Lily leaving his apartment building after what appears to be a tryst with one of his tenants. Rosedale is interested in Lily because not only is she beautiful, but what is more important, she is also a social asset in gaining him a place in high society. She reflects that she has put herself in his power by her clumsy dress-maker fib and her refusal to allow him to take her to the station which would have given him the prestige of being seen by members of the society with whom he was aspiring to gain acceptance. As his social ascent continues, he offers Lily marriage which would provide her a way out of her financial dilemma and her precarious social standing; she puts him off. His cleverness and business acumen serve him well to achieve a higher and higher rung on the social ladder. Lily, however, is on her way down to the point that Rosedale is no longer interested in marrying her. Despite the differences in their social standing, Rosedale by the end of the story shows compassion for Lily. He offers her a loan when he runs into her after she has lost her hat-making job—an offer she refuses.

Percy Gryce — A conservative, rich, but shy and unimaginative young eligible bachelor on whom Lily, with the support of her friend Judy Trenor, sets her sights. Percy&#x27;s less than titillating personality notwithstanding, Lily works out a strategy to catch him at week-long festivities at Bellomont. Her fortuitous and successful encounter with Percy on the train to Bellomont further encourages her in pursuit of her goal. Her strategy gets interrupted, however, when Selden at week&#x27;s end also appears on the scene unexpectedly. Lily then decides, on the spur of the moment, to set aside her well-thought-out tactics to pursue Percy in favor of spending some time with Selden. When, at a more rational moment, she returns to pursuing Percy, his mother-in law-to-be tells Lily at Jack Stepney&#x27;s and Gwen Van Osburgh&#x27;s wedding about his engagement to Evie Van Osburgh.

Bertha Dorset (Mrs. George Dorset) — A petite and pretty high-society matron whose husband George is extremely wealthy. She is first introduced catching the train to Bellomont where she boards with great fanfare and commotion. She demands that the porter find her a seat with her friends, Lily and Percy. Once at Bellomont Judy Trenor intimates to Lily that Bertha is manipulative and also unscrupulous such that it is better to have her as a friend rather than an enemy. It is well known that Bertha is bored with her husband and seeks attention and love outside the confines of marriage. At Bellomont Bertha continues to pursue Selden in an attempt to rekindle the flame of an adulterous affair they have been carrying on but with which he has become disenamored. As Book I ends, she invites Lily to accompany her on a Mediterranean cruise to distract her husband so she can carry on an affair with Ned Silverton. Bertha understands, as a married woman, she must keep up appearances and ruthlessly impugns Lily&#x27;s reputation to mask her own adultery. She spreads false rumors that besmirch Lily&#x27;s virtue among their friends. Lily, as an unmarried woman without a protector, has little she can do in her own defense.

Mrs. Peniston (Julia) — Lily&#x27;s wealthy, widowed Aunt –sister to Lily&#x27;s father. Mrs. Peniston embodies &quot;old-school&quot; morality and has a family pedigree that goes back to the industrious and successful Dutch families of early New York. Although she maintains an opulent residence on fashionable Fifth Avenue, she does not follow fashion or renovate constantly to maintain a chic appearance. In Lily&#x27;s eyes, the Peniston home is therefore dingy. Mrs. Peniston&#x27;s &quot;Old New York&quot; lifestyle requires keeping her drawing room neat, eating well and dressing expensively. She harbors a passive attitude and does not actively engage in life. Although she spends time in the country during the first part of the book, by the last half of the book she is a shut-in with significant heart problems. When Lily arrived in New York in financial distress after the death of her mother, Mrs. Peniston took pleasure in the public display of her generosity by agreeing to take Lily on for a year after her mother died—much to the relief of the extended family. She found, to her surprise, that she liked the volatile Lily. She therefore continued to support Lily for over a decade during Lily&#x27;s fruitless search for a wealthy, socially connected husband. She indulges and passively enables Lily&#x27;s habit of gallivanting with her fashionable friends, and ignores the way Lily avoids and abandons her. Although Lily is clearly Julia&#x27;s favorite, displacing her previous favorite Grace Stepney, Julia never makes any verbal or written promise to provide for Lily in the long term. Although Lily and her friends believe that is &quot;understood&quot; that she will inherit most if not all of Julia&#x27;s fortune, Julia herself never made such a statement. Indeed, her forbearance is stretched to the limit when rumors reach her that Lily gambles for money and is encouraging attention from married men who compensate her for it. As upset as Julia is by evidence of Lily&#x27;s immoral behavior, she does not immediately ask Lily for details because it is easier to discredit the messenger. When Lily comes to Julia asking for money to pay various debts, including what Lily passes off as gambling debts, Julia refuses. The relationship is permanently damaged, and when Lily sails away with the Dorsets instead of cleaning up the social and financial mess she has made, Julia does not write to Lily or attempt to repair the relationship. When word reaches her that Lily has been publicly accused of having an affair with George Dorset, and when Lily continues to gallivant in Europe instead of returning home, Julia disinherits Lily in favor of the more loyal Grace Stepney. By the time Lily returns to New York, Julia has died, and nobody knows about the disinheritance until her will is read.

Judy Trenor (Mrs. Gus Trenor) — Lily&#x27;s best friend and confidante— is the stereotypical high-society matron, married to Gus Trenor, a successful business man. She frequently hosts large parties and social events at their country home, Bellomont. By engaging in gossip Mrs. Trenor keeps up on the social scene. She acts as matchmaker between Lily and Percy Gryce. She uses Lily as her surrogate private secretary and spends much of her day making sure that every detail of her events is done to perfection. This includes poring over lists to decide which guests are the most desirable to invite, which have been &quot;stolen&quot; by another conflicting event, and which unmarried men and women should be set up together. She invites Selden to Bellomont on anonymous advice to keep Mrs. George Dorset entertained. Judy suffers from frequent headaches and avoids noisy environments such as the opera. She must sometimes cancel minor engagements on short notice, and prefers to stay at Bellomont when her head hurts.

Gus Trenor—Judy Trenor&#x27;s husband—a massive man with a heavy carnivorous head and a very red complexion. He is a successful stock market speculator and an advocate of Simon Rosedale&#x27;s acceptance in high society circles although he considers him a bounder. He is also a notorious flirt and looks for attention in relationships with women outside of his marriage. Gus becomes enamored with Lily, a frequent guest at his wife&#x27;s weekend social events. He uses his financial investment skills and a large sum of his own money in a risky investment for Lily which she agrees to. The proceeds from this speculation will help her pay her gambling debts and other expenses necessary to keep up appearances. The investment pays off for Lily financially, as Gus intends that it should, but the friendship turns sour when Lily is unwilling to exchange romantic attention for money the way Gus believes she tacitly agrees to do.

Carry Fisher (Mrs. Fisher) — A small, fiery and dramatic divorcée. She is perceived as carrying &quot;a general air of embodying a &#x27;spicy paragraph&#x27;;&quot;(70) and according to Mrs. Trenor, &quot;. . .most of her alimony is paid by other women&#x27;s husbands.&quot; (91) She sponges money from Gus Trenor to cover her bills much to his wife&#x27;s chagrin. Although Gus accepts romantic favors from Mrs. Fisher in exchange for paying her bills and investing her money in the stock market, he considers her a &quot;battered wire-puller&quot;(94) in comparison to the fresh and unsullied Miss Bart. Carry is also known for bringing newcomers into high society such as Rosedale and the Wellington Brys, who had managed the miracle of making money in a falling market. After Lily has been expelled from the upper class by Bertha, Carry is one of the few people who still show compassion toward her, offering Lily support and job opportunities. Carry is an example of a woman who finds ways to earn money and to succeed in society despite being divorced and somewhat disreputable. Her presence in the story refutes the notion that Lily has no choice except to self-destruct.

Ned Silverton — A young man, whose first intention was to live on proofreading and write an epic, but ended up living off his friends. Ned&#x27;s romantic relationship at the Bellomont house party is with Carry Fisher. Six months later, Ned accompanies Lily and the Dorsets on their Mediterranean cruise. He has an affair with Mrs Dorset, who manages to keep it concealed from most of society. Ned&#x27;s increasing gambling addiction consumes not only his resources but that of his sisters, who live in poverty while he travels with Bertha Dorset. After the fling with Bertha ends, Ned participates in a scheme to help a purportedly wealthy but disreputable woman to marry the younger brother of Gwen and Evie Van Osburgh. This conspiracy, in which Lily is implicated, helps ensure Lily&#x27;s downfall.

Evie Van Osburgh — A young, innocent, dull, and conservative, stay-at-home kind of a girl, heiress to a substantial fortune. Judy Trenor paired her sister, Gwen, with Percy Gryce at the Sunday-night supper at Bellomont. Evie ends up getting engaged within six weeks of their stay at Bellomont to Percy Gryce due to Bertha Dorset&#x27;s match-making skills.

Gerty Farish — Selden&#x27;s cousin. She is a kind, generous woman who occupies herself with charity work, but Lily despises her because of her less than glamorous appearance. In Book Two, Gerty becomes one of Lily&#x27;s only friends, giving her a place to stay and taking care of her when everyone else abandons her. Lily does not wish to continue living with Gerty or combining resources because she is unwilling to lower herself to the standard of living Gerty can afford.

Jack Stepney and Gwen (Van Osburgh) Stepney — A very wealthy couple—guests at Bellomont just before celebrating their wedding at the Van Osburgh&#x27;s estate six weeks later. They belong to Old New York&#x27;s high society, although their money comes from Gwen&#x27;s side. Prior to his marriage, the nearly bankrupt Jack has business dealings with Simon Rosedale and has tried to afford him entrée into New York&#x27;s high society. After marrying Gwen, Jack becomes plump, conservative, and complacent. Jack is Lily&#x27;s cousin so he agrees to shelter her for the night after Bertha kicks her off her yacht for ostensibly carrying on romantically with Bertha&#x27;s husband.

Grace Stepney — Lily&#x27;s middle-aged cousin lives in a boarding house and has spent most of her life waiting on Julia Peniston. Until Lily arrived, Grace was Julia&#x27;s favorite: she shares Julia&#x27;s conservatism and sense of propriety, and she is willing to help out during the fall cleaning. Grace attracts and remembers all manner of gossip related to high society in general and to Lily in particular, but does not generally gossip herself. Lily treats Grace very poorly, regarding her as insignificant. When Lily prevails on her aunt Julia to exclude Grace from a family dinner party, Grace retaliates. She relays to Aunt Julia the talk about Lily&#x27;s attention to Gus Trenor in exchange for money that Lily used to pay gambling debts, and stops protecting Lily from the otherwise predictable consequences of Lily&#x27;s actions. When Lily comes to Grace after the reading of the will, Grace does not have the money to give Lily the loan she is asking for because the assets Grace inherited from Julia are still tied up in probate. When Lily asks Grace to borrow money against Aunt Julia&#x27;s estate and lend or give it to Lily, Grace refuses.

==Critical reception==
In the contemporary book review &quot;New York Society Held up to Scorn in three New Books&quot; (15 October 1905) &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic said that &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; is &quot;a novel of remarkable power&quot; and that &quot;its varied elements are harmoniously blended, and [that] the discriminating reader who has completed the whole story in a protracted sitting, or two, must rise from it with the conviction that there are no parts of it which do not properly and essentially belong to the whole. Its descriptive passages have verity and charm, it has the saving grace of humor, its multitude of personages, as we have said, all have the semblance of life.&quot;

The publication of the novel prompted letters to the editor of the &quot;New York Times Saturday Review of Books&quot; which argued the merits of the story, saying that the novel was a faithful and true portrait of the New York City gentry, while detractors said that it impugned the character of the city&#x27;s social élite as a heartless and materialist leisure class.

== Adaptations ==

==Controversy==
In 1996, the &quot;Canta&quot; editors Steven Fleming and Creon Upton were removed after publishing a range of controversial articles including a Mel Brooks Nazi parody, a column purporting to have been written by Michael Jackson, a mock Tintin comic strip, and a list of student criminal offenders (a hoax). The editors claimed at the time that their sacking was more a result of their poor relationship with the university&#x27;s student executive council than anything else. An employment tribunal later found in favour of the sacked editors resulting in a substantial payout from the student executive.

&quot;Canta&quot; was again involved in controversy following the publishing of an article entitled &quot;The Completely Unofficial Top 13 Ways of Cheating&quot; in the issue preceding midterm exams in June 2007. New Zealand newspaper The Press and internet news service Stuff published an article which was reported on by &quot;3 News&quot;. The university announced it was introducing a random seating policy in exams following the attention. Canterbury University Students&#x27; Association president Belinda Bundy said the article was not meant to be taken seriously. &quot;I think we only ever saw it as a humorous thing, It was just a light-hearted reaction to all the cheating issues that have been raised recently.&quot;

In 2008, a weekly column entitled &quot;Trust Deborah – She&#x27;s Always Right&quot; surfaced. This column features a weekly rant against different groups of people, ranging from &quot;fat&quot; girls (females with a BMI&gt;22, according to the column writer) and Christians. In issue 21 of 2008, Deborah again made headlines by suggesting that Christians &quot;have the mental capacity of a Down&#x27;s syndrome-sufferer with a head injury&quot;, are &quot;mentally defective&quot; and declaring that she wishes that all Christians would die. Her articles have generated considerable &quot;Hate Mail&quot;, published in every issue of 2009. This has had little effect on changing Canta Magazine policy.

In late 2015, the magazine underwent a restructuring after an article on virtual rape entitled &quot;The Epidemic of Virtual Butt-hurt&quot; was published in March. Issues were recalled and a new editorial team independent of the UCSA was appointed in 2016. The first issue of 2016, under the new team, included a message stating: &quot;Disclaimer: The opinions presented in this Canta magazine are not necessarily those held by the UCSA or this University. Canta is now independent of the UCSA and is run by a student-led team.&quot;

<text>Lactucarium is the milky fluid secreted by several species of lettuce, especially &quot;Lactuca virosa&quot;, usually from the base of the stems. It is known as lettuce opium because of its sedative and analgesic properties. It has also been reported to promote a mild sensation of euphoria. Because it is a latex, lactucarium physically resembles opium, in that it is excreted as a white fluid and can be reduced to a thick smokable solid.

==History==
&quot;Lettuce opium&quot; was used by the ancient Egyptians, and was introduced as a drug in the United States as early as 1799. The drug was prescribed and studied extensively in Poland during the nineteenth century, and was viewed as an alternative to opium, weaker but lacking side-effects, such as not being highly addictive, and in some cases preferable. However, early efforts to isolate an active alkaloid were unsuccessful. It is described and standardized in the 1898 United States Pharmacopoeia and 1911 &quot;British Pharmaceutical Codex&quot; for use in lozenges, tinctures, and syrups as a sedative for irritable cough or as a mild hypnotic (sleeping aid) for insomnia. The standard definition of lactucarium in these codices required its production from &quot;Lactuca virosa&quot;, but it was recognized that smaller quantities of lactucarium could be produced in a similar way from &quot;Lactuca sativa&quot; and &quot;Lactuca canadensis&quot; var. &quot;elongata&quot;, and even that lettuce-opium obtained from &quot;Lactuca serriola&quot; or &quot;Lactuca quercina&quot; was of superior quality.

In the twentieth century, two major studies found commercial lactucarium to be without effect. In 1944, Fulton concluded, &quot;Modern medicine considers its sleep producing qualities a superstition, its therapeutic action doubtful or nil.&quot; Another study of the time identified active bitter principles lactucin and lactucopicrin, but noted that these compounds from the fresh latex were unstable and did not remain in commercial preparations of lactucarium. Accordingly, lettuce opium fell from favor, until publications of the hippie movement began to promote it in the mid-1970s as a legal drug producing euphoria, sometimes compounded with catnip or damiana. More recent work has confirmed that lactucin and lactucopicrin do have analgesic and sedative properties.

The seeds of lettuce have also been used to relieve pain. Lettuce seed was listed as an anaesthetic in Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;, which served as an authoritative medical textbook from soon after AD 1000 until the seventeenth century.

==Contemporary use==
Although lactucarium has faded from general use as a pain reliever, it remains available, sometimes promoted as a legal psychotropic.

The seed of ordinary lettuce, &quot;Lactuca sativa&quot;, is still used in Avicenna&#x27;s native Iran as a folk medicine.

==Chemical constituents==

The chemical constituents of lactucarium that have been investigated for biological activity include lactucin and its derivatives lactucopicrin and 11β,13-dihydrolactucin. Lactucin and lactucopicrin were found to have analgesic effects comparable to those of ibuprofen, and sedative activity in measurements of spontaneous movements of the mice. Some effects have also been credited to a trace of hyoscyamine in &quot;Lactuca virosa&quot;, but the alkaloid was undetectable in standard lactucarium. A crude extract of the seeds was shown to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in standard formalin and carrageenan tests of laboratory rats. It was not toxic to the rats at a dose of 6 grams per kilogram.

&quot;Lactuca virosa&quot; contains flavonoids, coumarins, and &quot;N&quot;-methyl-β-phenethylamine. A variety of other chemical compounds have been isolated from &quot;L. virosa&quot;. One of the compounds, lactucin, is an adenosine receptor agonist &quot;in vitro&quot;, while another, lactucopicrin, has been shown to act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor &quot;in vitro&quot;.
&quot;Lactuca floridana&quot; was found to contain 11β,13-Dihydro-lactucin-8-O-acetate hemihydrate.

==Formulations==
Lactucarium was used unmodified in lozenges, 30–60 milligrams (0.5 to 1 grain), sometimes mixed with borax. However, it was found to be more efficient to formulate the drug in a cough syrup &quot;(Syrupus Lactucarii, U.S.P.)&quot; containing net 5% lactucarium, 22% glycerin, 5% alcohol, and 5% orange-flower water in syrup.

<text>Bel-Ami (, &quot;Dear Friend&quot;) is the second novel by French author Guy de Maupassant, published in 1885; an English translation titled &quot;Bel Ami, or, The History of a Scoundrel: A Novel&quot; first appeared in 1903.

The story chronicles journalist Georges Duroy&#x27;s corrupt rise to power from a poor former cavalry NCO in France&#x27;s African colonies, to one of the most successful men in Paris, most of which he achieves by manipulating a series of powerful, intelligent, and wealthy women.

==Summary==
The novel is set in Paris in the upper-middle class environment of the leading journalists of the newspaper &quot;La Vie Française&quot; and their friends. It tells the story of Georges Duroy, who has spent three years in military service in Algeria. After working for six months as a clerk in Paris, an encounter with his former comrade, Forestier, enables him to start a career as a journalist. From a reporter of minor events and soft news, he gradually climbs his way up to chief editor. Duroy initially owes his success to Forestier&#x27;s wife, Madeleine, who helps him write his first articles and, when he later starts writing lead articles, she adds an edge and poignancy to them. At the same time, she uses her connections among leading politicians to provide him with behind the scenes&#x27; information which allows him to become actively involved in politics. Duroy is also introduced to many politicians in Madame Forestier&#x27;s drawing-room. Duroy becomes the lover of Forestiers&#x27; friend Mme de Marelle, another influential socialite. Duroy later tries to seduce Madeleine Forestier too, but she repulses Duroy&#x27;s sexual advances and offers that they remain friends without ulterior motives.

In a few months, Charles Forestier&#x27;s health deteriorates, and he travels to the south of France to regain it. Soon afterwards, Duroy receives a letter from Madeleine, imploring him to join her and help her bear the last moments of her husband&#x27;s life. When Forestier dies, Duroy asks Madeleine to marry him. After a few weeks to consider, she agrees. Georges now signs his articles Du Roy (an aristocratic style of French name) in order to add prestige to his name. The married couple travels to Normandy, the region of Georges&#x27;s childhood, and meets his peasant parents. Finding the reality different from her romantic expectations, Madeleine feels very uncomfortable with his parents, and so their stay with them is short. In the newspaper office, Duroy is ridiculed for having his articles written by his wife, just as the late Forestier had his articles written by her. His newspaper colleagues call him &#x27;Forestier&#x27;, which angers Georges, and he becomes heavily jealous of Madeleine, insisting that she admit having been unfaithful to Forestier, but she never does.

In order to suppress the stings of jealousy, Duroy starts an affair with Mme Walter, the wife of the owner of the newspaper. He especially enjoys the conquest, as he is her first extramarital lover. Later on, however, he regrets the decision, for he cannot get rid of her when he does not want her. Duroy&#x27;s relations with his wife become estranged; at one point, he takes a police superintendent and three other police officers to a flat in which his wife is meeting Monsieur Laroche-Mathieu, her lover. They catch the two in the act of adultery, which was then a crime punishable under the law. Duroy used the police as witnesses of his wife&#x27;s adultery to facilitate their divorce. He did not have her or her lover arrested, although the police gave him the option to do so.

In the last two chapters, Duroy&#x27;s ascent to power continues. Duroy, now a single man, makes use of his chief&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s infatuation with him, and arranges an elopement with her. The parents then have no other choice but to grant their assent to the marriage. The last chapter shows Duroy savouring his success at the wedding ceremony, at which &#x27;all those who figured prominently in society&#x27; are present. His thoughts, however, chiefly belong to Mme de Marelle who, when wishing him all the best, indicates that she has forgiven him for his new marriage and that their intimate meetings can be taken up again.

<text>Operation Bootstrap () is the name given to a series of projects which transformed the economy of Puerto Rico into an industrial and developed one. The federal government of the United States together with what is known today as the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company set forth a series of ambitious economical projects that evolved Puerto Rico into an industrial high-income territory compared to the region. Bootstrap is still considered the economic model of Puerto Rico as the island has still not been able to evolve into a knowledge economy.

==History==
The island&#x27;s traditional economy was based around sugarcane plantations; of the 516,730 jobs on the island in 1940, almost half of them were agriculture-based, with 124,076 of these based on sugar-cane farms. However, Esteban Bird described in detail the misgivings of the sugarcane industry and the monoculture economy in general. By the middle of the twentieth century it remained one of the poorest in the Caribbean. After possession of the island was transferred to the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, it remained mostly neglected. Conditions in Puerto Rico worsened during the world wars, after years of neglect. Pressure grew in the U.S. to address the worsening situation, influenced by journalists like John Gunther who described the island in 1941 as such:

&quot;I saw, in short, misery, disease, squalor, filth. It would be lamentable enough to see this anywhere...to see it on American territory...is a paralyzing jolt to anyone who believes in American standards of progress and civilization.&quot;

In May 1947, the Puerto Rican legislature passed the Industrial Incentives Act eliminating all corporate taxes, to encourage U.S. investment in industry. The initiative granted private and foreign investment a ten year period of exemption from taxes on many of the expenses for businesses involved in the industrial economy. These exemptions included:

* &quot;license fees, excises, or other municipal taxes levied by any ordinance of any municipality,&quot;
* &quot;property devoted to industrial development,
* &quot;income tax on income from industrial development,&quot; and more.

This was proposed by Senator Luis Muñoz Marín of the Popular Democratic Party, and became known as Operation Bootstrap. Based on 1930s New Deal economic relief reforms and infrastructure provided by the programs such as the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, Operation Bootstrap intended to move Puerto Rico away from its agrarian system and into an industrial economy. The government&#x27;s Administration of Economic Development — today known as the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO) — encouraged the establishment of factories. Following the Elective Governor Act of 1947 (also known as the Crawford-Butler Act), Muñoz was elected the first governor of Puerto Rico while under U.S. control, paving the way for the full establishment of Operation Bootstrap across the island. According to Virginia Sanchez Korrol from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, Operation Bootstrap was based on 3 essential elements:

“1) industrialization by invitation: the inducement of American corporations to relocate in Puerto Rico in exchange for lucrative tax benefits;

(2)  a cheap labor pool, educated in the English language and under a U.S. imposed curriculum;

(3) proposed emigration of over a third of the island’s population, a security measure to insure the plan’s viability.”

The US government in Puerto Rico enticed US companies by providing labor at costs below those on the mainland, access to US markets without import duties, and profits that could transfer to the mainland free from federal taxation. The Administration of Economic Development invited investment of external capital, importing the raw materials, and exporting the finished products to the mainland. To entice participation, tax exemptions and differential rental rates were offered for industrial facilities. As a result, Puerto Rico&#x27;s economy shifted labor from agriculture to manufacturing and tourism. The manufacturing sector has shifted from the original labor-intensive industries, such as the manufacturing of food, tobacco, leather, and apparel products, to more capital-intensive industries, such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and electronics. Through this project, a rural agricultural society was transformed into an industrial working class.

Although initially touted as an economic miracle, by the 1960s, Operation Bootstrap was increasingly hampered by a growing unemployment problem. As living standards and wages in Puerto Rico rose, manpower-intensive industries faced competition from outside the United States. It also faced criticism from civil rights groups and the Catholic Church, who perceived the government promoting birth control, and engaging in non-consensual surgical sterilization. American industrialists influenced by eugenicists policies were concerned with &quot;overpopulation&quot; and a perceived lack of self-control on the part of the working class Puerto Ricans.

As of 2005 the continental United States remains Puerto Rico&#x27;s major trading partner, received 86% of Puerto Rico&#x27;s exports and providing 69% of its imports.

==Effects==

=== Increased living standards ===
Those able to secure a stable job as a result of Operation Bootstrap received higher wages than before, in fact, &quot;The average real weekly salary in manufacturing increased from $18 for men and $12 for women in 1953 to $44 and $37 respectively in 1963.&quot; The increase in industrialization and manufacturing saw positive effects in other places, as new electric grids were built, new roads were paved in major cities, and major housing development was underway. As a result, life expectancy in Puerto Rico jumped almost 23 years.

=== Shift in job market ===
Manufacturing jobs also led to a shift in the job market as it pertains to gender. In 1940, women represented half of the total population of Puerto Rico, but represented less than 25% of the labor force. Women in Operation Bootstrap were targeted as an important labor force, especially for the garment and apparel industry, which represented a share of the manufacturing market.

In January 2024, the State of Puerto Rico relaxed its remote work requirements with Act 52-2022, which exempts foreign employers with no connection to Puerto Rico from withholding income tax for employees working remotely in Puerto Rico, provided certain conditions are met.

=== Education ===
At the time, modernization theory was the driving force behind American program development in the Cold War era. As a result, Operation Bootstrap focused on educational development to fuel economic development in Puerto Rico. In the 1950s, education was viewed as the cornerstone of Island development and was allocated more of the Islands budget than any other public sector. From 1932-1957 the number of students enrolled in vocational education went from 5,700 to 110,000. The rise in vocational education was designed to prepare Puerto Rican&#x27;s for work in factories newly developed by the Bootstrap program.

=== Mass migration ===
Mass emigration from Puerto Rico was a result of Operation Bootstrap. The growth of the industrial sector could not match the rapid decline of monocultural plantation jobs that characterized the economy of Puerto Rico Pre-World War II. Also, while U.S. businesses sought Puerto Ricans for labor, these businesses were still very willing to continue to seek new, and even cheaper forms of labor. High volatility in employment for those on the island was a direct result. This led to mass unemployment across the island, with the countryside seeing the largest effect. Residents were forced to either move to bigger cities like San Juan or immigrate to the United States for better financial opportunities and higher wages. In the 1950s (the peak of Puerto Rican emigration from the island), as ~470,000 Puerto Ricans emigrated from their country, they went to cities like New York City (where 85% of which people settled), Philadelphia, and others along the East Coast. Through the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s, emigration from Puerto Rico declined dramatically.

=== Coerced sterilization ===
Throughout the 1940s and to the 1960s, programs supported by the United States encouraged sterilization and birth control for the women on the island. These programs were birthed out of a perceived &quot;overpopulation&quot; problem on the island. Puerto Rican families averaged 5 to 6 people per family, and this was labeled as partly the reason for the unemployment and high poverty rates on the island. Luis Muñoz Marín was concerned that the perceived overpopulation problem could derail Operation Bootstrap, so his administration was in support. Across the island, the sterilization procedure was referred to as &#x27;la operación.&quot; According to Antonia Darder, &quot;By 1969, 35% of all Puerto Rican women of child-bearing age had undergone la operación.&quot;

<doc id="879136" wikidata="Q1207652" url="?curid=879136" title="Taira no Masakado">
<text>was a Heian period provincial magnate (&quot;gōzoku&quot;) and samurai based in eastern Japan, notable for leading the first recorded uprising against the central government in Kyōto. Along with Sugawara no Michizane and Emperor Sutoku, he is often called one of the “.”.

==Early life==

Masakado was one of the sons of Taira no Yoshimasa (平良将), also known as Taira no Yoshimochi (平良持), of the Kanmu Taira clan (&quot;Kanmu Heishi&quot;), descendants of Emperor Kanmu (reigned 781–806) who were demoted from princely to commoner status and granted the Taira surname. Yoshimochi was one of the sons of Prince Takamochi, a grandson or great-grandson of Kanmu who was appointed the vice-governor of Kazusa Province (modern central Chiba Prefecture) in 889 (Kanpyō 1). Takamochi&#x27;s sons who joined him there occupied a variety of provincial offices in the eastern part of the country such as that of &quot;chinjufu shōgun&quot;, the commander-in-chief of the defense garrison (&quot;chinjufu&quot;) in Mutsu Province tasked with subjugating the Emishi peoples of the north.

Not much is known of Masakado&#x27;s birth and early life due to lack of written evidence. The genealogical record &quot;Sonpi Bunmyaku&quot; (compiled 1377-1395) identifies Masakado as the third of Yoshimochi&#x27;s eight sons, while the genealogy of the Sōma clan (an offshoot of the Chiba clan, who were descended from Masakado&#x27;s uncle Yoshifumi), the &quot;Sōma Keizu&quot; (相馬系図), identifies him as the second of seven sons. The latter text also claims that he was nicknamed Sōma no Kojirō (相馬小次郎, &quot;Kojirō&quot; meaning &quot;little second son&quot;) during his childhood, suggesting that he was raised in the district of Sōma (相馬郡) in Shimōsa Province (part of modern southwest Ibaraki Prefecture and northwest Chiba Prefecture), though the factuality of this information has been disputed. Masakado&#x27;s mother is sometimes identified as the daughter of a certain Agata (no) Inukai no Harue (県犬養春枝), perhaps a local magnate from Sōma District.

Masakado&#x27;s year of birth is also unclear. Accounts of his exploits in the mid-930s suggest that his children were young enough to be still in the care of their mother, which may imply that he was born sometime around 900. Later legend portrays Masakado as the reincarnation of scholar and politician Sugawara no Michizane (later deified as the god Tenjin), who died in 903 (Engi 3).

At some point in his late teens, Masakado went to the capital city of Heian-kyō (Kyōto) and served in the household of the imperial regent Fujiwara no Tadahira. He is said to have aspired for a position within the imperial police force, the &quot;Kebiishi&quot;, but failed to obtain court rank or any significant office in spite of his credentials and his patron&#x27;s high status.

==The Jōhei-Tengyō Rebellion==

=== Beginning of hostilities (931–936) ===

Disagreement exists about the exact cause of Masakado&#x27;s rebellion. While some sources portray the uprising as revenge for his failure to secure a government post, the &quot;Shōmonki&quot; (将門記, also read as &quot;Masakadoki&quot;), an anonymous monograph on Masakado&#x27;s life believed to have been completed as early as the 940s, suggests that the conflict originally began in 931 (Jōhei 1) as a dispute between Masakado, freshly returned from Heian-kyō, and his paternal uncle Taira no Yoshikane (平良兼) over a woman. The identity of this woman is uncertain, though one theory suggests that it may have been a daughter of Yoshikane who married her cousin and apparently went to live with him against her father&#x27;s wishes. (Aristocratic marriages during the Heian period were usually matrilocal; the wife continued to reside with her parents while the husband either moved in with his wife&#x27;s family or simply visited her.) Besides this affront to his honor, Masakado not obtaining any post or rank in the capital might have been another factor in Yoshikane&#x27;s opposition to the marriage. Another theory based on folk tradition meanwhile suggests that Masakado and Yoshikane quarreled over a daughter of Minamoto no Mamoru (源護), former senior secretary (大掾, &quot;daijō&quot;) of Hitachi Province who had married off his daughters to Masakado&#x27;s uncles, Yoshikane among them.

On the other hand, the &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot; (c. 1120) gives another reason for the conflict, namely that Masakado&#x27;s uncles had appropriated the lands the young man was supposed to inherit from his late father. Masakado&#x27;s uncle Taira no Kunika (平国香), who as Takamochi&#x27;s eldest son was the head of the clan, might have tried to take over his younger brother Yoshimochi&#x27;s property and place it under his control. Kunika, like Yoshikane, was related by marriage ties to Mamoru, who would eventually become involved in the conflict.

In the 2nd month of 935 (Jōhei 5), Masakado and his men were ambushed by Mamoru&#x27;s three sons, Tasuku, Takashi, and Shigeru, at a place called Nomoto (野本) in the district of Makabe (真壁郡), near the border between Hitachi and Shimōsa (modern Chikusei, Ibaraki), but managed to repel their attack; the three brothers all died in the battle. In retaliation, Masakado then burned and ransacked the houses of Tasuku&#x27;s supporters across southwestern Hitachi. Kunika also died during this conflict, under circumstances not entirely clear: he may have either been killed during the skirmish at Nomoto or when Masakado set fire to his residence.
On the 21st day of the 10th month of the same year, Taira no Yoshimasa (平良正), Masakado&#x27;s paternal uncle or cousin who was also related by marriage to Mamoru, seeking to avenge the deaths of Kunika and Mamoru&#x27;s sons, faced Masakado in battle in the village of Kawawa (川曲村) in western Hitachi (identified with the town of Yachiyo, Ibaraki) but Masakado once again proved the victor; more than sixty of Yoshikane&#x27;s men were killed while the rest dispersed.

After his humiliating defeat, Yoshimasa called to Yoshikane – now the vice-governor of Kazusa Province – for aid, who then gathered a large number of warriors from Kazusa and Shimōsa such that officials from the two provinces initially attempted to prevent their dispatch (Such protests were later withdrawn after the issue was deemed to be a private matter beyond the sphere of state affairs). On the 26th day of the 6th month of 936 (Jōhei 6), Yoshikane led his massive army to Hitachi, where he joined forces with Yoshimasa and Kunika&#x27;s son Sadamori (who had been in the capital when his father was killed and initially took a neutral stance), whom he had prevailed upon to take part in the attack against Masakado. They made contact at the border between Hitachi and Shimotsuke (modern Tochigi Prefecture) with Masakado, who went there to verify reports about a plan to launch a joint attack on him from the north. Despite only having about a hundred poorly-equipped soldiers with him, Masakado inflicted heavy casualties upon his enemies&#x27; several thousand strong army. Scattered and thrown into confusion, Yoshikane and the remnants of his forces fled to the provincial headquarters of Shimotsuke, Masakado pursuing them. Although he managed to surround his uncle in the governmental offices, Masakado, seemingly concerned about subsequent censure should he kill Yoshikane then and there, allowed him to escape through a gap in his western line. He then filed a formal grievance with the provincial authorities in neighboring provinces before returning to his territory.

Not long after his victory, Masakado received a summons from the imperial court because of a complaint lodged against him by Minamoto no Mamoru over the battle at Nomoto. Masakado then hurried to the capital to give an account of himself; his lord, Fujiwara no Tadahira, probably intervened in the case and helped lighten his punishment. He was eventually pardoned early the following year (937 / Jōhei 7) when a general amnesty was declared at the occasion of Emperor Suzaku&#x27;s coming of age (&quot;genpuku&quot;).

=== Masakado and Yoshikane (937-938) ===
Anxious to avenge his defeat, Yoshikane almost immediately recommenced hostilities upon Masakado&#x27;s return. He first launched an attack on Masakado at the Kogai River near the border between Shimōsa and Hitachi while displaying portraits of Yoshimochi and Takamochi (Masakado&#x27;s father and grandfather) in front of his vanguard. This ploy succeeded in weakening the morale of Masakado and his men, who &quot;withdrew, carrying their shields.&quot; (&quot;Shōmonki&quot;) Afterwards, Yoshikane burned a critical stable and some houses at Masakado&#x27;s base in Toyoda District (豊田郡) in Shimōsa to weaken his ability to make war. Masakado launched a counterattack some days later, but was again defeated due to being struck by a severe pain in his legs (thought to be due to beriberi). During his retreat, Masakado had his wife (Yoshikane&#x27;s daughter) and children flee by boat for their safety, but Yoshikane discovered them and carried them off to Kazusa. The woman&#x27;s brothers eventually allowed them to escape back to Masakado.

=== Death ===
In 939 (Tengyō &quot;2, 12th month&quot;), Masakado led a minor rebellion which is also known as &quot;Tengyō no Ran.&quot; The armed struggle began when Masakado led an attack on an outpost of the central government in Hitachi Province, capturing the governor. In December of that year, he conquered Shimotsuke and Kōzuke Provinces; and he claimed the title of Shinnō (New Emperor).

The central government in Kyoto responded by putting a bounty on his head, and fifty-nine days later his cousin Taira no Sadamori, whose father Masakado had attacked and killed, and Fujiwara no Hidesato, killed him at the Battle of Kojima (Shimōsa Province) in 940 and took his head to the capital.

==Aftermath==

The head found its way to Shibasaki, a small fishing village on the edge of the Pacific ocean and the future site of Edo, which later became Tokyo. It was buried. The &quot;kubizuka&quot;, or grave, which is located in the present day Ōtemachi section of Tokyo, was on a hill rising out of Tokyo Bay at the time. Through land reclamation over the centuries, the bay has receded some three kilometers to the south.

==Deification==
When Masakado was preparing for his revolt, a vast swarm of butterflies appeared in Kyoto, a portent of the upcoming battle.

Over the centuries, Masakado became a demigod to the locals who were impressed by his stand against the central government, while at the same time feeling the need to appease his . The fortunes of Edo and Tokyo seemed to wax and wane correspondingly with the respect paid to the shrine built to him at the &quot;kubizuka&quot; (ja); neglect would be followed by natural disasters and other misfortunes. Hence, to this day, the shrine is well maintained, occupying some of the most expensive land in the world in Tokyo’s financial district facing the Imperial Palace. His tomb (which contains only a monument to his head) is near exit C5 of Tokyo&#x27;s Ōtemachi subway station.

Other shrines which he is deity of include (located in Kanda), and Tsukudo Jinja (which has multiple locations.)

In Gifu Prefecture, there is a Mikubi shrine (ja) dedicated to Taira no Masakado. According to a legend left at the Shinto shrine, a priest at a shrine in Mino Province prayed to a to prevent the head of Taira no Masakado, who was beheaded in Kyoto, from returning to Kantō for revenge, and the kami shot the head off with a as Taira no Masakado flew back to Kantō. The Mikubi Shrine was built on the spot where the head fell.

<text>Studs Lonigan is a novel trilogy by American author James T. Farrell: &quot;Young Lonigan&quot; (1932), &quot;The Young Manhood of Studs Lonigan&quot; (1934), and &quot;Judgment Day&quot; (1935). In 1998, the Modern Library ranked the Studs Lonigan trilogy 29th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

The trilogy was adapted into a minor 1960 film and a 1979 television miniseries, both of which were simply titled &quot;Studs Lonigan&quot;.

==Themes==
Farrell wrote these three novels at a time of national despair. During the Great Depression, many of America&#x27;s most gifted writers and artists aspired to create a single, powerful work of art that would fully expose the evils of capitalism and lead to a political and economic overhaul of the American system.

Farrell chose to use his own personal knowledge of Irish-American life on the South Side of Chicago to create a portrait of an average American slowly destroyed by the &quot;spiritual poverty&quot; of his environment. Both Chicago and the Catholic Church of that era are described at length and faulted. Farrell describes Studs sympathetically as Studs slowly deteriorates, changing from a tough but fundamentally good-hearted, adventurous teenage boy to an embittered, physically shattered alcoholic.

==Film==
Parts of Farrell&#x27;s novels were made into a B movie in 1960, directed by Irving Lerner and starring Christopher Knight in the title role. Other cast members included Frank Gorshin, Venetia Stevenson, and Jack Nicholson (in one of his first movie roles). The film was not widely reviewed. Pauline Kael wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that &quot;it’s an honorable low-budget effort by a group of people trying to break the Hollywood molds, and there are a few passages of daring editing that indicate what the film was aiming for. It’s an underfinanced American attempt at &quot;I Vitelloni&quot;.

==Television==

In 1979 &quot;Studs Lonigan&quot; was produced as a television miniseries starring Harry Hamlin, Colleen Dewhurst, Brad Dourif, Dan Shor, and Charles Durning. Production Designer Jan Scott won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Art Direction for a Limited Series or a Special. Reginald Rose wrote the adaptation of the trilogy. The miniseries preserves the novel&#x27;s tragic ending but humanizes Studs Lonigan&#x27;s family and friends to a very considerable degree.

==Other==
The entire miniseries is housed at the University of Georgia&#x27;s Peabody Collection. The University has made the series available online by using the keyword &quot;Studs Lonigan&quot; in the search box.

==Reception and legacy==

According to William McCann:
:No writer has described a specific area of American society so thoroughly and comprehensively as Farrell did in the seven novels of Studs Lonigan and Danny O&#x27;Neill (1932-43). A consummate realist in viewpoint and method, he turned repeatedly in his fiction to the subject he knew best, the Irish Catholic neighborhood of Chicago&#x27;s South Side. Drawing on lacerating personal experience, Farrell wrote about people who were victims of injurious social circumstances and of their own spiritual and intellectual shortcomings. He depicted human frustration, ignorance, cruelty, violence, and moral degeneration with sober, relentless veracity...Despite his Marxist leanings, Farrell&#x27;s fiction is not that of a reformer, or a doctrinaire theorist, but rather the patient humorless representation of ways of life and states of mind he abhors….Farrell’s place in American letters, however, as certainly the most industrious and probably the most powerful writer in the naturalistic tradition stemming from Frank Norris and Dreiser, was solidly established with the Lonegan--O&#x27;Neil series.

<doc id="879139" wikidata="Q750014" url="?curid=879139" title="Northern Thailand">
<text>Northern Thailand, or more specifically [[Lan Na|Lanna]], is geographically characterised by several mountain ranges, which continue from the Shan Hills in bordering Myanmar to Laos, and the river valleys that cut through them. Like most of Thailand, it has a tropical savanna climate, but its relatively high elevation and latitude contribute to more pronounced seasonal temperature variation, with cooler winters than the other regions. 

Historically, northern Thailand has been linked to the Hariphunchai Kingdom, which emerged as a powerful state in the region in the 7th century. This kingdom was related to the Dvaravati that existed from the 6th to 11th centuries. The Hariphunchai culture later influenced the development of the Lanna Kingdom, which emerged in the 13th century and lasted until the 18th century.

==Geography==

North Thailand is bound by the Salween River in the west and the Mekong in the east. The basins of rivers Ping, Wang, Yom, and Nan, all tributaries of the Chao Phraya River, in the central part run from north to south and are mostly very wide. The basins cut across the mountains of two great ranges, the Thanon Range in the western part and the Phi Pan Nam in the eastern. Their elevations are generally moderate, a little above for the highest summits. Although formerly forested, many of these mountains are now denuded.

Parallel mountain ranges extend from the Daen Lao Range, in the southern region of the Shan Hills, in a north–south direction, the Dawna Range forming the western border of Thailand between Mae Hong Son and the Salween River. To the east the Thanon Thong Chai Range, the Khun Tan Range, the Phi Pan Nam Range, as well as the western part of the Luang Prabang Range, form the natural region of the Thai highlands together with the former.

The high mountains are incised by steep river valleys and upland areas that border the central plain. A series of rivers, including the Nan, Ping, Wang, Yom, and Nan, flow southwards through mountain valleys and join to form the Chao Phraya in Nakhon Sawan Province in the central region. Sirikit Dam is on the Nan River in Uttaradit Province. The northeastern part is drained by rivers flowing into the Mekong basin, like the Kok and Ing.

The four-region system includes the northern parts of the central plain as well as some mountainous areas bordering the western and the northeastern limits. The total forest area is or 52.5 percent of this four-region area.

===National parks===

Within the northern region there are some sixty national parks. Chiang Mai Province has nine national parks of which Doi Inthanon National Park with the country&#x27;s highest mountain and Op Luang National Park have a scenic river canyon, waterfalls, and caves. Doi Khun Tan National Park, which is located midway between the two provincial capitals of province Lampang and Lamphun, is best known for Thailand&#x27;s longest railroad tunnel, which is long. Doi Phu Kha National Park in province Nan is northern Thailand&#x27;s largest national park.

== Regional classification of northern Thailand ==
The northern region, as defined by the National Geographical Committee in 1978, consists of nine provinces. Geographically the division, in conformance with the six-region system, includes most of the mountainous natural region of the Thai highlands.

In the four-region classification system, northern Thailand gains the eight upper-central-region provinces: Kamphaeng Phet, Nakhon Sawan, Phetchabun, Phichit, Phitsanulok, Sukhothai, Uthai Thani and Tak, bringing the total to 17 provinces.

In 2019 it is common to subdivide the northern region into: nine provinces of the upper northern region and eight provinces of the lower northern region. All websites of these eight provinces state: &quot;located in the lower northern region&quot;.

==Economy==
For FY 2018, Northern Thailand Region had a combined economic output of 1,266 trillion baht (US$40.8 billion), or 7.7 percent of Thailand&#x27;s GDP. Lamphun province had an economic output of 84.395 billion baht (US$2.7 billion). This equates to a GPP per capita of 211,489 baht (US$6,822), half more than for Chiang Mai province, next in the ranking and double than for Lampang province, which is third in the ranking.


Kamphaeng Phet province had an economic output of 117.705 billion baht (US$3.8 billion). This amounts to a GPP per capita of 150,783 baht (US$4,864), half more than for Tak province, which is fifth in the ranking.

==Languages==
Central Thai is the sole official language in Thailand. However, in the six-region classification system, it is the second largest native language in Northern Thailand, amounting to roughly two hundred thousand people, found in the lower part of Uttaradit Province. Central Thai spoken in southern regions of Northern Thailand in the four-region classification system comprise a group of dialects classified as Ne.

The main language is Northern Thai, which is a southwestern Tai language spoken in the 9 changwat of Northern Thailand. It is spoken by roughly six million people. There are also various hill tribe languages such as Lolo-Burmese, Karenic, Mienic, Mienic, Palaungic, Southwestern Mandarin.

<text>George Suckley (1830–1869) was an American physician and naturalist notable as an explorer of the Washington and Oregon territories in the 1850s, and describer of several new fish species.

==Life==
He was born in New York City, studied at the College of Physicians and Surgeons (today Columbia University), received an M.D. in 1851, and subsequently served as surgeon at New York Hospital.

In April 1853 Suckley was appointed assistant surgeon and naturalist to the Pacific Railroad Survey led by Isaac Stevens. Initially commissioned as a surgeon with the U.S. Army, Suckley resigned in 1856 to pursue natural history full-time resulting in the publication of several works on the natural history of the Pacific Northwest.

Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, Suckley rejoined the Army and worked as a surgeon throughout the war. He died in New York City a few years after the war.

Two fish species, &quot;Squalus suckleyi&quot; Girard 1855, and &quot;Catostomus sucklii&quot; Girard 1856, and the bumblebee &quot;Bombus suckleyi&quot; are named after George Suckley.

In 1856, American botanist A.Gray published &quot;Suckleya&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from America belonging to the family Amaranthaceae, which were named in George Suckley&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="879147" wikidata="Q1849805" url="?curid=879147" title="Thaification">
<text>Thaification, or Thai-ization, is the process by which people of different cultural and ethnic origins living in Thailand become assimilated to the country&#x27;s dominant culture:, that of central Thailand.

Thaification was a step in the creation in the 20th century of the Thai nation state in which Central Thai people occupy a dominant position, as opposed to the historically-multicultural kingdom of Siam. A related term, &quot;Thainess&quot;, describes the particular characteristics that distinguish the Thai from others.

==Motives==
Thaification is a byproduct of the nationalist policies mandated by the Thai state after the Siamese coup d&#x27;état of 1933. The coup leaders, said to be inspired by Western ideas of an exclusive nation state, acted more in accordance with their close German nationalist and anti-democratic counterparts to effect kingdom-wide dominance by the Central Thai culture. Minority-owned businesses, like the traditionally-merchant Thai Chinese were aggressively acquired by the state, which gave preferential contracts to ethnic Central Thais and cooperative ethnic Chinese.

Thai identity was mandated via 12 Thai cultural mandates and reinforced in the heartlands and in rural areas. Central Thailand became economically and politically dominant, and Central Thai, unlike the multilingual Siam, became the state-mandated language of the media, business, education and all state agencies. Central Thai values were successfully inculcated into being perceived as the desirable national values, with increasing proportions of the population identifying as Thai. Central Thai culture, being the culture of wealth and status, made it hugely attractive to a once-diverse population that sought to be identified with nationalist unity.

==Targets==
The main targets of Thaification were ethnic Chinese and other ethnic groups on the edges of the kingdom, geographically and culturally: the Lao of Isan (อีสาน), the hill tribes of western and northern Thailand, and also Thais who speak the Southern Thai language. There has also been a Thaification of the immigrant Indian and Vietnamese populations. Thaification also targeted the ethnic Malay but was perhaps least successful.

==Policies==
Thaification by the government can be separated into three sets of policies:

===Rural development===
In the first set of policies, the government targeted specific policies and actions at fringe groups. An example of this is the Accelerated Rural Development Programme of 1964, the Isan component of which included the strengthening of allegiance to Bangkok and the rest of the country as one of its objectives.

===Education===
The second set of policies consists of policies applied nationally, but that disproportionately affect fringe groups. One example of this is the prescribed use of Central Thai language in schools. This had little or no effect on the central Thais, or the Siamese people, who already used the language as a native but made bilinguals of speakers of Isan in the northeast, of Northern Thai () in the north and of Pattani Malay () in the south.

Harsher methods were imposed on the Thai Chinese. After the People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded in 1949, a series of anticommunist Thai military juntas, starting with that of right-wing dictator Plaek Phibunsongkhram, sharply reduced Chinese immigration and prohibited Chinese schools in Thailand. Thai Chinese born after the 1950s had &quot;very limited opportunities to enter Chinese schools&quot;. Those Thai Chinese who could afford to study overseas studied English, instead of Mandarin Chinese for economic reasons. As a result, the Chinese in Thailand have &quot;almost totally lost the language of their ancestors&quot; and are gradually losing their Chinese identity.

===Encouraging Thai nationalism===
A third set of policies was designed to encourage Thai nationalism in the nation&#x27;s peoples such as the promotion of the king as a national figurehead and saluting the flag in school and the twice-daily broadcasts of the national anthem (; ) on radio and television at 08:00 and 18:00 as well as in public spaces. Encouraging Thai nationalism had the intended side effect of discouraging other loyalties, such as that to Laos, stemming from the central Thais&#x27; fear of Lao cultural and political dominance in the Isan region and that of Malay (; ) in the south.

<doc id="879168" wikidata="Q496639" url="?curid=879168" title="Quackwatch">
<text>Quackwatch is a United States–based website, self-described as a &quot;network of people&quot; founded by Stephen Barrett, which aims to &quot;combat health-related frauds, myths, fads, fallacies, and misconduct&quot; and to focus on &quot;quackery-related information that is difficult or impossible to get elsewhere&quot;. Since 1996 it has operated the alternative medicine watchdog website quackwatch.org, which advises the public on unproven or ineffective alternative medical remedies. The site contains articles and other information criticizing many forms of alternative medicine.

Quackwatch cites peer-reviewed journal articles and has received several awards. The site has been developed with the assistance of a worldwide network of volunteers and expert advisors. It has received positive recognition and recommendations from mainstream organizations and sources, although at times it has also received criticism for perceived bias in its coverage. It has been recognized in the media, which cite quackwatch.org as a practical source for online consumer information. The success of Quackwatch has generated the creation of additional affiliated websites; there were 21 of them.
== History ==
Barrett founded the Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud (LVCAHF) in 1969, and it was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1970. In 1996, the corporation began the website quackwatch.org, and the organization itself was renamed &quot;Quackwatch, Inc.&quot; in 1997. The Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation was dissolved after Barrett moved to North Carolina in 2008, but the network&#x27;s activities continue. Quackwatch co-founded, and was closely affiliated with, the National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF). The NCAHF was formally dissolved in 2011.

In February 2020, Quackwatch became part of the Center for Inquiry. CFI planned to maintain its various websites and to receive Barrett&#x27;s library later in the year.

== Mission and scope ==
Quackwatch is overseen by Barrett, its owner, with input from advisors and help from volunteers, including a number of medical professionals. In 2003, 150 scientific and technical advisors: 67 medical advisors, 12 dental advisors, 13 mental health advisors, 16 nutrition and food science advisors, three podiatry advisors, eight veterinary advisors, and 33 other &quot;scientific and technical advisors&quot; were listed by Quackwatch. Many more have since volunteered, but advisor names are no longer listed.

Quackwatch describes its mission as follows:

...investigating questionable claims, answering inquiries about products and services, advising quackery victims, distributing reliable publications, debunking pseudoscientific claims, reporting illegal marketing, improving the quality of health information on the internet, assisting or generating consumer-protection lawsuits, and attacking misleading advertising on the internet.

Quackwatch has no salaried employees, and the total cost of operating all Quackwatch&#x27;s sites is approximately $7,000 per year. It is funded mainly by small individual donations, commissions from sales on other sites to which they refer, profits from the sale of publications, and self-funding by Barrett. The stated income is also derived from the usage of sponsored links.

== Site content ==
The Quackwatch website contains essays and white papers, written by Barrett and other writers, intended for the non-specialist consumer. The articles discuss health-related products, treatments, enterprises, and providers that Quackwatch deems to be misleading, fraudulent, or ineffective. Also included are links to article sources and both internal and external resources for further study.

The site is developed with the assistance from volunteers and expert advisors. Many of its articles cite peer-reviewed research and are footnoted with several links to references. A review in &quot;Running &amp; FitNews&quot; stated the site &quot;also provides links to hundreds of trusted health sites.&quot;

=== Related and subsidiary sites ===
Naturowatch is a subsidiary site of Quackwatch which aims to provide information about naturopathy that is &quot;difficult or impossible to find elsewhere&quot;. The site is operated by Barrett and Kimball C. Atwood IV, an anesthesiologist by profession, who has become a vocal critic of alternative medicine.

The site is available in French and formerly in German and Portuguese, as well as via several mirrors.

== Influence ==
Sources that mention Stephen Barrett&#x27;s &quot;Quackwatch&quot; as a useful source for consumer information include website reviews, government agencies, and various journals including &quot;The Lancet&quot;.

=== Mention in media, books, and journals ===
Quackwatch has been mentioned in the media, books and various journals, as well as receiving several awards and honors. The &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; mentioned Quackwatch as one of nine &quot;select sites that provide reliable health information and resources&quot; in 1998. It was also listed as one of three medical sites in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Best of the Web&quot; in 1999. Thomas R. Eng, director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Science Panel on Interactive Communication and Health, stated in 1999 that while &quot;the government doesn&#x27;t endorse Web sites...[Quackwatch] is the only site I know of right now looking at issues of fraud and health on the Internet.&quot;

Sources that mention quackwatch.org as a resource for consumer information include the United States Department of Agriculture, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the &quot;Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, the Diet Channel, and articles published in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, the &quot;American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Marketing Education&quot;, the &quot;Medical Journal of Australia&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of the American Dietetic Association&quot;. In addition, several nutrition associations link to Quackwatch. An article in &quot;PC World&quot; listed it as one of three websites for finding the truth about Internet rumors. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; review of alternative medicine websites noted that &quot;skeptics may find Quackwatch offers better truth-squadding than the Food and Drug Administration or the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.&quot;

The books &quot;Low-Carb Dieting for Dummies&quot; (2003), &quot;The Arthritis Helpbook&quot; (2006), &quot;The Rough Guide to the Internet&quot; (2007), &quot;Navigating the Medical Maze: A Practical Guide&quot; (2008), &quot;Chronic Pain for Dummies&quot; (2008), and &quot;The 2009 Internet Directory&quot; (2008) mention or use content from Quackwatch.

=== Citations by journalists ===
Quackwatch and Barrett have also been cited by journalists in reports on therapeutic touch, Vitamin O, Almon Glenn Braswell&#x27;s baldness treatments, Robert Barefoot&#x27;s coral calcium claims, William C. Rader&#x27;s &quot;stem cell&quot; therapy, noni juice, shark cartilage and saturated fat.

=== Recommendations and endorsements ===
The American Cancer Society lists Quackwatch as one of ten reputable sources of information about alternative and complementary therapies in their book &quot;Cancer Medicine&quot;. In a long series of articles on various alternative medicine methods, it uses Quackwatch as a reference and includes criticisms of the methods.

The Health On the Net Foundation, which confers the &quot;HONcode&quot; &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; certification to reliable sources of health information in cyberspace, recommends Quackwatch. It also advises Internet users to alert Quackwatch when they encounter &quot;possibly or blatantly fraudulent&quot; healthcare websites.

In a 2007 feasibility study on a method for identifying web pages that make unproven claims, the authors wrote:
== Site reviews ==
Writing in the trade-journal &quot;The Consultant Pharmacist&quot; in 1999, pharmacist Bao-Anh Nguyen-Khoa characterized Quackwatch as &quot;relevant for both consumers and professionals&quot; and containing articles that would be of interest to pharmacists, but that a peer review process would improve the site&#x27;s legitimacy. Nguyen-Khoa said the presence of so many articles written by Barrett gave an impression of lack of balance but that the site was taking steps to correct this by recruiting expert contributors. He also noted thatBarrett often inserts his strong opinions directly into sections of an article already well supported by the literature. Although entertaining, this direct commentary may be viewed by some as less than professional medical writing and may be better reserved for its own section.Donna Ladd, a journalist with &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, in 1999 described Barrett as &quot;a full-time journalist and book author&quot;, &quot;never a medical researcher&quot;, and one who &quot;depends heavily on negative research ... in which alternative therapies do not work&quot; but &quot;says that most case studies that show positive results of alternative therapies are unreliable&quot;. She quoted Barrett as saying that &quot;a lot of things don&#x27;t need to be tested [because] they simply don&#x27;t make any sense&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, Mona Okasha wrote that Quackwatch provides an &quot;entertaining read&quot;, but described it as only appropriate for limited use as it fails to provide a balanced view of alternative cancer treatments. Jane Cuzzell viewed Quackwatch similarly, arguing that it was entertaining but that the &quot;resource value of this site depends on what the visitor is seeking&quot; and had concerns about the appearance of bias in the selection of the material. However, while Lillian Brazin also found it to be biased, she described Quackwatch as credible, and noted both the credentials of the contributors and the thoroughness of the content.

In a 2002 book, Ned Vankevitch, associate professor of communications at Trinity Western University, places Barrett in a historical tradition of anti-quackery, embracing such figures as Morris Fishbein and Abraham Flexner, which has been part of American medical culture since the early-twentieth century. Although acknowledging that Quackwatch&#x27;s &quot;exposé of dangerous and fraudulent health products represents an important social and ethical response to deception and exploitation&quot;, Vankevitch criticizes Barrett for attempting to limit &quot;medical diversity&quot;, employing &quot;denigrating terminology&quot;, categorizing all complementary and alternative medicine as a species of medical hucksterism, failing to condemn shortcomings within conventional biomedicine, and for promoting an exclusionary model of medical scientism and health that serves hegemonic interests and does not fully address patient needs.

Waltraud Ernst, professor of the history of medicine at Oxford Brookes University, commenting on Vankevitch&#x27;s observations in 2002, agrees that attempts to police the &quot;medical cyber-market with a view to preventing fraudulent and potentially harmful practices may well be justified&quot;. She commends &quot;Barrett&#x27;s concern for unsubstantiated promotion and hype,&quot; and says that &quot;Barrett&#x27;s concern for fraudulent and potentially dangerous medical practices is important,&quot; but she sees Barrett&#x27;s use of &quot;an antiquarian term such as &#x27;quack&#x27;&quot; as part of a &quot;dichotomising discourse that aims to discredit the &quot;&#x27;old-fashioned&#x27;, &#x27;traditional&#x27;, &#x27;folksy&#x27; and heterodox by contrasting it with the &#x27;modern&#x27;, &#x27;scientific&#x27; and orthodox.&quot; Ernst also interprets Barrett&#x27;s attempt to &quot;reject and label as &#x27;quackery&#x27; each and every approach that is not part of science-based medicine&quot; as one which minimizes the patient&#x27;s role in the healing process and is inimical to medical pluralism.

A 2003 website review by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine stated:

Dr. Stephen Barrett, a psychiatrist, seeks to expose unproven medical treatments and possible unsafe practices through his homegrown but well-organized site. Mostly attacking alternative medicines, homeopathy and chiropractors, the tone here can be rather harsh. However, the lists of sources of health advice to avoid, including books, specific doctors and organizations, are great for the uninformed. Barrett received an FDA Commissioner&#x27;s Special Citation Award for fighting nutrition quackery in 1984. BEST: Frequently updated, but also archives of relevant articles that date back at least four years. WORST: Lists some specific doctors and organizations without explaining the reason for their selection.

A 2004 review paper by Katja Schmidt and Edzard Ernst in the &quot;Annals of Oncology&quot; identified Quackwatch as an outstanding complementary medicine information source for cancer patients.

The Good Web Guide said in 2006 that Quackwatch &quot;is without doubt an important and useful information resource and injects a healthy dose of scepticism into reviewing popular health information&quot;, but &quot;tends to define what is possible or true only in terms of what science has managed to &#x27;prove&#x27; to date&quot;.

The organization has often been challenged by supporters and practitioners of the various forms of alternative medicine that are criticized on the website.

<text>John Alton Benton (March 18, 1911 – April 14, 1968) was an American professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Athletics, Detroit Tigers, Cleveland Indians, and Boston Red Sox. The right-hander was listed as tall and .

Benton is known for being the only pitcher to face both Babe Ruth (in 1934) and Mickey Mantle (in 1952). Benton is also the only player to have two sacrifice bunts in the same inning, against the Cleveland Indians on August 6, 1941.

==Biography==
Benton was born in Noble, Oklahoma, a small town a few miles south of Norman. In 1940, Benton led the American League with 17 saves. In 1941 he went 15–6 with a 2.97 earned run average (ERA) (second in the American League (AL)) in 38 games. He completed seven of 14 starts and got seven saves. Despite his 7–13 mark a year later, his ERA was 2.90 with career-highs in starts (30) and innings pitched (226). Benton was chosen for the AL All-Star team in both 1941 and 1942, and then missed the 1943 and 1944 seasons while serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II.

Benton was discharged from the Navy in November 1944 and had his best year in 1945. He compiled a record of 13–8, a career-low 2.02 ERA, five shutouts, and 12 complete games in 191 innings. In a remarkable testament to the Tigers pitching in 1945, Hal Newhouser and Benton were No. 1 and No. 2 in ERA among AL pitchers. Newhouser&#x27;s Adjusted ERA+ in 1945 was 195 and Benton&#x27;s was 175. The Adjusted ERA+ figures posted by Newhouser and Benton in 1945 rank as the first and fifth best seasons all time for a Detroit Tigers pitcher with at least 150 innings pitched. Benton pitched in relief in three games in the 1945 World Series and gave up only one earned run for a 1.93 World Series ERA.

The rest of his career he worked largely as a setup man or as an emergency starter. A two-time All-Star (1941–42), Benton compiled a career 98–88 record with 697 strikeouts and a 3.66 ERA in 1688 innings.

Benton died in 1968 at the age of 57 from burns he suffered when the Lynwood, California, motel he managed exploded into flames.

<doc id="879171" wikidata="Q597930" url="?curid=879171" title="Hucho taimen">
<text>Siberian taimen (Hucho taimen), also known as the common taimen (), Siberian giant trout or Siberian salmon, is a species of salmon-like ray-finned fish from the genus &quot;Hucho&quot; in the family Salmonidae. These fish are found in rivers in Siberia and adjacent regions, and are harvested throughout the year.

==Habits and range==
The taimen is distributed from the Volga and Pechora River basins in the west to the Yana and Amur River basins in the east, spanning portions of Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China. On a larger scale, this includes parts of the Caspian, Arctic, and Pacific drainages in Eurasia. In Mongolia, the taimen is found in both the Arctic and Pacific drainages, specifically the Yenisei/Selenga, the Lena, and the Amur River Basins. The taimen lives in flowing water and is only occasionally found in lakes, usually near the mouth of a tributary. The taimen is not anadromous, but does show increased movement rates during the spawning season. The average home range size of taimen in the Eg-Üur rivers of Mongolia is , but some tagged individuals show home ranges up to . Some authors consider the taimen to be a subspecies of the huchen, i.e. &quot;Hucho hucho taimen&quot;.

==Description==
Coloration varies geographically, but is generally olive green on the head blending to reddish brown in the tail. Adipose, anal, and caudal fins are often dark red. The belly ranges from nearly white to dark gray. The taimen appears to be the largest salmonid in the world, being heavier at average and maximum sizes than the largest North American salmonid, the chinook salmon. Most mature fish caught weigh from . The average length is from . The maximum length is about . The maximum size is not assured, but supposedly a fish caught in the Kotui River in Russia in 1943 with a length of and a weight of is the largest size recorded. The IGFA world record is with a length of . It can reach at least 55 years of age.

==Diet==
Adult taimen are mainly piscivores, eating fish, though they frequently eat terrestrial prey such as rodents and birds.

==Angling and commercial use==

The taimen is becoming a more well-known game fish, particularly for fly fishers. Catch-and-release with barbless hooks is practised in many areas to conserve dwindling populations of this species. Organizations such as the Taimen Conservation Fund are working to conserve the remaining populations. While the taimen is sometimes (often illegally) harvested commercially, its low price and slow growth and reproduction make it more valuable as a game fish.

==Conservation==
The taimen has been assessed as vulnerable and in decline by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Threats to the taimen include land-use change, such as the establishment of sand and gravel industries in Mongolia and in Heilongjiang Province, China, industrial water pollution in Europe, commercial fishing in the Amur River region of Russia and China, legal and illegal sport fishing throughout its range and the impacts of climate change. The IUCN recommends that the fish be considered for inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species to spur international cooperation on the conservation of this fully migratory species.

==Folklore==
*Mongolian legend tells of a giant taimen trapped in river ice. Starving herders were able to survive the winter by hacking off pieces of its flesh. In the spring, the ice melted and the giant taimen climbed onto the land, tracked down the herders, and ate them all.
*According to Chinese folklore, a type of giant taimen lives in Kanas Lake in China. Villagers near Kanasi claim to have found fish weighing over 4 tonnes.
*&quot;National Geographic&quot; called the taimen the &quot;Mongolian Terror Trout&quot;.

<text>The Chi River (, , ; , ) is the longest river flowing wholly within Thailand. It is long but carries less water than the second longest river, the Mun. The name of the river is &quot;Mae Si&quot; () in the Isan and Lao languages of the region, being transliterated as &quot;Chi&quot; in Bangkok-Thai. In wet seasons there are often flash floods in the floodplain of the Chi River basin.

==Course==
The river rises in the Phetchabun mountains, then runs east through the central Isan provinces of Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen, and Maha Sarakham, then turns south in Roi Et, runs through Yasothon and joins the Mun in the Kanthararom district of Sisaket Province. The river carries approximately of water per annum.

The river was an 18th-century migration route for the re-peopling of the Khorat Plateau by ethnic Lao people from the left (east) bank of the Mekong resettling on the right bank. This began in 1718 when the first king of the left bank Kingdom of Champasak, King Nokasad, sent a group of some 3,000 subjects led by an official in his service to found the first settlement in the Chi River valley—and indeed anywhere in the interior of the Khorat Plateau—Muang Suwannaphum in present-day Roi Et Province (a history recorded and remembered, largely in terms of the struggle to expand wet-rice cultivation in the river valley). Their descendants are now regarded as a separate ethnic group from the Lao to the north and the central Thai to the southwest.

==Pop culture==
Chi river is the setting of a Thai TV drama on Channel 7 HD, titled &quot;Chart Lam Chi&quot; (ชาติลำชี; The River Chi&#x27;s Protector). It was an action-drama TV series that aired from March 14 to April 25, 2018, remake from namesake film in 1969 (starred by Mitr Chaibancha and Petchara Chaowarat).

<text>&quot;England expects that every man will do his duty&quot; was a signal sent by Vice-Admiral of the Royal Navy Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, from his flagship as the Battle of Trafalgar was about to commence on 21 October 1805.

During the battle, as Nelson&#x27;s fleet closed in on the allied fleet, he ordered Lieutenant John Pasco to signal the British fleet as soon as possible. After Pasco suggested some changes, and Nelson agreeing to them, the signal was sent at around 11:45 a.m. on 21 October 1805 and relayed using a numeric flag code known as the &quot;Telegraphic signals; or Marine vocabulary&quot;.

Although there was much confusion surrounding the precise wording of the signal in the aftermath of the battle, the significance of the victory and Nelson&#x27;s death during the battle led to the phrase becoming a standard representation of a militant English spirit of courage and virtue in the face of conflict. It has been regularly quoted, paraphrased and referenced up to the modern day.

==Background==

During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon planned to invade Britain. To do so, he ordered both the French and Spanish navies to take control of the English Channel to ensure a safe passage for the Grande Armée. Commanded by Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, the allied navy went down to Cape Trafalgar, where they encountered a British Fleet commanded by Horatio Nelson.

On 21 October 1805, the Battle of Trafalgar began, with Nelson&#x27;s fleet of 27 ships pitted against the combined Spanish and French fleet of 33. To secure victory, Nelson sailed his fleet toward the flank of the Allied fleet to break it into pieces. The naval battle resulted in 18 Allied ships being lost, while the British lost none. During the engagement, the French lost 14,000 troops, with at least 7,000 prisoners of war, including French Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve. Moreover, 1,500 British died, including Admiral Horatio Nelson. As a result, the British were victorious, ensuring their control of the sea and removing the possibility of a French invasion of Britain.

==Signals during the battle ==
As the British fleet closed with the opposing combined fleets of France and Spain, Nelson signalled all the necessary battle instructions to his ships. Aware of the momentousness of events to come, Nelson felt that something extra was required. He instructed his signal officer, Lieutenant John Pasco, to signal to the fleet, as quickly as possible, the message &quot;England confides [i.e. is confident] that every man will do his duty.&quot; Pasco suggested to Nelson that &quot;expects&quot; be substituted for &quot;confides&quot;, since the former word was in the signal book, whereas &quot;confides&quot; would have to be spelt out letter-by-letter. Nelson agreed to the change (even though it produced a less trusting impression):

Thus, at around 11:45 a.m. on 21 October 1805, the signal was sent. The exact time the signal was sent is not known (one account puts it as early as 10:30), as the message was repeated throughout the fleet, but Pasco puts it at &quot;about a quarter to noon&quot; and logs from other ships of the line also put it close to this time.

The signal was relayed using the numeric flag code known as the &quot;Telegraphic Signals of Marine Vocabulary&quot;, devised in 1800 by Rear Admiral Sir Home Popham, and based on the signal books created earlier by Admiral Lord Howe. This code assigned the digits 0 to 9 to ten signal flags, which were used in combination. Code numbers 1–25 represented letters of the alphabet (omitting J and with V=20 before U=21); higher numbers were assigned meanings by a code book. 

The code numbers are believed to have been hoisted on the mizzenmast, one after another, with the &quot;telegraphic flag&quot; (a red-over-white diagonally-split flag) also being flown to show that the signals employed Popham&#x27;s code. As well as digit flags, the code used &quot;repeat&quot; flags so that only one set of digits was needed; thus the word &quot;do&quot;, coded as &quot;220&quot;, used a &quot;2&quot; flag, a &quot;first repeat&quot; flag here serving as a second 2, and a &quot;0&quot; flag. The word &quot;duty&quot; was not in the codebook (and was not replaced as &quot;confides&quot; had been), so had to be spelt out, and the whole message required twelve &quot;lifts&quot;. It is believed that it would have taken about four minutes, with the end of the message indicated by an &quot;end of code&quot; flag (blue over yellow diagonally split). A team of four to six men, led by Lt. Pasco, would have prepared and hoisted the flags onboard Nelson&#x27;s flagship . The message shows one of the shortcomings of Popham&#x27;s code—even the two-letter &quot;do&quot; required three flags hoisted for the signal. It is reported that a great cheer went up as the signal was hoisted and repeated throughout the fleet.

According to the historian John Knox Laughton:
It is said that, as he saw the flags going up, Collingwood remarked half-peevishly to his flag-lieutenant, &quot;I wish Nelson would make no more signals; we all understand what we have to do.&quot; When, however, the signal was reported, he was delighted, and ordered it to be announced to the ship&#x27;s company, by whom it was received with the greatest enthusiasm.

The message &quot;engage the enemy more closely&quot; was Nelson&#x27;s final signal to the fleet, sent at 12:15 p.m., before a single British cannon had been fired at the enemy. This message was signalled using the telegraphic flag and flags 1 and 6. Nelson ordered this signal hauled up and kept aloft.
It remained up until shot away during the battle.

==After the battle==
Almost immediately, the signal began to be misquoted. A number of ships in the fleet recorded the signal as &quot;England expects every man &quot;to&quot; do his duty&quot; (omitting &quot;that&quot; and replacing &quot;will&quot; with &quot;to&quot;). This version became so prevalent that it is recorded on Nelson&#x27;s tomb in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The word &quot;that&quot; is also omitted on the version around the base of Nelson&#x27;s Column. However, the &quot;Victory&quot;″s log and the accounts of signal officer John Pasco and Henry Blackwood (captain of the frigate &quot;Euryalus&quot;), both present at the preparation of the signal, agree on the form given here. On 26 December 1805, &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in London reported the signal as; &quot;England expects every officer and man to do his duty this day&quot;. In 1811, the tenor John Braham composed a song, &quot;The Death of Nelson&quot;, including the words of the signal. The song became popular almost immediately and was performed throughout the British Empire during the 19th century. To make the words fit the metre, they were altered to &quot;England expects that every man this day will do his duty&quot;. This version of the wording is also persistent.

Between 1885 and 1908 it was believed that the signal had been sent using the 1799 code book, as in 1885 it was pointed out that this had not been replaced until 1808. In 1908 it was discovered that the Admiralty had, in fact, changed the signal code in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson&#x27;s fleet at Cadiz in September 1805. As a result, books published between these two dates show the signal using the wrong flags.

The signal is still hoisted on the &quot;Victory&quot; at her dry dock in Portsmouth on Trafalgar Day (21 October) every year, although the signal flags are displayed all at once, running from fore to aft, rather than hoisted sequentially from the mizzenmast.

===Similar signals===
The signal has been imitated in other navies of the world. Napoleon ordered the French equivalent, &quot;&quot;, to be displayed on French vessels. At the opening of the Battle of Plattsburgh in September 1814, Commodore Thomas MacDonough of the United States Navy flew the signal &quot;Impressed seamen call on every man to do his duty&quot;, referring to the fact that impressment of sailors had been a U.S. casus belli of the War of 1812. During the 1865 Battle of Riachuelo, a turning point of the Paraguayan War, Brazilian Admiral Manuel Barroso, Baron of Amazonas, rallied his fleet by signalling the Portuguese equivalent, &quot;&quot;O Brasil espera que cada um cumpra o seu dever&quot;.&quot;

A similar signal was used by the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Russo-Japanese War. At the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō – who had studied naval tactics in Britain from 1871 to 1878, and was known as the &quot;Nelson of the East&quot;– signalled to his fleet: &quot;The fate of the Empire depends upon today&#x27;s battle: let every man do his utmost&quot;.

==Connection with Mission Command==

The implied reliance on shared intent, individual duty, and initiative has made &quot;England Expects&quot; an early symbol of what would evolve into Mission Command, a decentralized style of Command and Control applied with considerable success since the nineteenth century. Nelson trusted the experience, skill, and initiative of his individual captains and sailors, as a way of managing the uncertainty inherent in war. 

==Later uses==

Charles Dickens quotes it in Chapter 43 of &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;:
In Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;, the Bellman says:
In Ogden Nash&#x27;s collection of poems &quot;I&#x27;m a Stranger Here Myself&quot; (1938) there is a short poem &quot;England Expects&quot;.
During the Second World War, an Admiralty propaganda poster intended to increase industrial production on the home front, carried the slogan; &quot;Britain expects that you too, this day, will do your duty&quot;. Nelson&#x27;s flag signal was hoisted by the Royal Navy monitor HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; at the start of the bombardment for the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944.

It was also referenced by Margaret Thatcher during her crucial speech to the cabinet which finally persuaded them to rally behind her over the divisive issue of the poll tax. Further afield, it has been adapted by James Joyce in his novel, &quot;Ulysses&quot;, such as &quot;Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty&quot;.

Today &quot;England expects...&quot; is often adapted for use in the media, especially in relation to the expectations for the victory of English sporting teams. Such is the sentence&#x27;s connotation with sport that a book on the history of the England national football team by James Corbett was entitled &quot;England Expects&quot;. A BBC Scotland television drama also bears its name.

<doc id="879188" wikidata="Q1380299" url="?curid=879188" title="Phu Phan Mountains">
<text>The Phu Phan mountains (, , ; , ) are a range of hills dividing the Khorat Plateau of the Isan region of Thailand into two basins: the northern Sakhon Nakhon Basin, and the southern Khorat Basin.

The silhouette of the Phu Phan Mountains appears in the provincial seal of Kalasin since they form the northern boundary of the province.

The Phu Phan mountains are among the places in Thailand more severely affected by the Illegal logging of &quot;Phayung&quot; (Siamese Rosewood) trees. Although officially a protected tree, the cutting and trading of the endangered rosewood trees has been going unabated in Thailand&#x27;s mountainous forested zones, even in the protected areas. In Thailand and in China this wood is highly valued in the furniture industry.

==Etymology==
The name of the range is derived from the characteristic tabletop shape of its peaks, for &quot;phan&quot; is a kind of traditional tray on a pedestal.

&quot;Phu&quot; is the word for mountain in the Isan/Lao language (as opposed to &quot;khao&quot; in central and southern Thai and &quot;doi&quot; in northern Thai).

==Geography==
The Phu Phan Mountains rise above the plateau and are not prominent. They straddle most of the provinces of northern and eastern Isan, including Khon Kaen, Nong Bua Lamphu, Udon Thani, Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, Kalasin, Roi Et, Maha Sarakham, and Mukdahan Province. 

The highest elevation of the Phu Phan Range is the 641 m high summit known as Phu Lang Ka. It is in Nakhon Phanom Province. Other important peaks are 624 m high Phu Mai Hia in Mukdahan Province and the 563 m high summit known as Phu Langka Nuea in Nakhon Phanom Province. 

The hills are mostly deforested, although patches covered with mixed deciduous forest remain in zones spread across the range.

Phu Phan Royal Palace is in the area, as is the Nam Un dam. Other local sights are Lake Nong Han near Sakon Nakhon and the Khmer-style chedi ruins of Phu Phek, dating from 1050.

==Protected areas==
The area of the Phu Phan mountains includes national parks and other protected areas:
* Phu Phan National Park
* Phu Wiang National Park
* Than Ngam Forest Park
* Kosam Phi Forest Park
* Nam Phong National Park
* Phu Faek Forest Park
* Phu Kao–Phu Phan Kham National Park
* Phu Pha Lek National Park
* Huai Huat National Park (Phu Pha Yon)
* Phu Phra Bat Buabok Forest Park

<doc id="879191" wikidata="Q823685" url="?curid=879191" title="Santa Maria sopra Minerva">
<text>Santa Maria sopra Minerva is one of the major churches of the Order of Preachers (also known as the Dominicans) in Rome, Italy. The church&#x27;s name derives from the fact that the first Christian church structure on the site was built directly over () the ruins or foundations of a temple dedicated to the Egyptian goddess Isis, which had been erroneously ascribed to the Greco-Roman goddess Minerva (possibly due to &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;).

The church is located in Piazza della Minerva one block east the Pantheon in the Pigna &quot;rione&quot; of Rome within the ancient district known as the &quot;Campus Martius&quot;. The present church and disposition of surrounding structures is visible in a detail from the Nolli Map of 1748.

While many other medieval churches in Rome have been given Baroque makeovers that cover Gothic structures, the Minerva is the only extant example of original Gothic architecture church building in Rome. Behind a restrained Renaissance style façade the Gothic interior features arched vaulting that was painted blue with gilded stars and trimmed with brilliant red ribbing in a 19th-century Neo-Gothic restoration.

The church and adjoining convent served at various times throughout its history as the Dominican Order&#x27;s headquarters. Today the headquarters have been re-established in their original location at the Roman convent of Santa Sabina. The titulus of was conferred upon Cardinal António Marto, on 28 June 2018.

==History==

In Roman times there were three temples in what is now the area surrounding the basilica and former convent buildings: the Minervium, built by Gnaeus Pompey in honour of the goddess Minerva about 50 BC, referred to as &#x27;; the Iseum dedicated to Isis, and the Serapeum dedicated to Serapis. Details of the temple to Minerva are not known but recent investigations indicate that a small round Minervium once stood a little further to the east on the Piazza of the Collegio Romano. In 1665 an Egyptian obelisk was found, buried in the garden of the Dominican cloister adjacent to the church. Several other small obelisks were found at different times near the church, known as the &#x27;, which were probably brought to Rome during the 1st century and grouped in pairs, with others, at the entrances of the temple of Isis. There are other Roman survivals in the crypt.

The ruined temple is likely to have lasted until the reign of Pope Zachary (741-752), who finally Christianized the site, offering it to Basilian nuns from Constantinople who maintained an &quot;&quot; there dedicated to the &quot;Virgin of Minervum&quot;. The structure he commissioned has disappeared.

In 1255 Pope Alexander IV established a community of converted women on the site. A decade later this community was transferred to the Roman Church of San Pancrazio thereby allowing the Dominicans to establish a convent of friars and a &quot;studium conventuale&quot; there. The Friars were on site beginning in 1266 but took official possession of the Church in 1275. Aldobrandino Cavalcanti (1279), &quot;vicarius Urbis&quot; or vicar for Pope Gregory X, and an associate of Thomas Aquinas ratified the donation of Santa Maria sopra Minerva to the Dominicans of Santa Sabina by the sisters of S. Maria in Campo Marzio. The ensemble of buildings that formed around the church and convent came to be known as the &quot;insula sapientae&quot; or &quot;insula dominicana&quot; (island of wisdom or Dominican island).

The Dominicans began building the present Gothic church in 1280 modelling it on their church in Florence Santa Maria Novella. Architectural plans were probably drawn up during the pontificate of Nicholas III by two Dominican friars, Fra Sisto Fiorentino and Fra Ristoro da Campi. With the help of funds contributed by Boniface VIII and the faithful the side aisles were completed in the 14th century.

In 1453 church interior construction was finally completed when Cardinal Juan Torquemada ordered that the main nave be covered by a vault that reduced the overall projected height of the church. In the same year of 1453 Count Francesco Orsini sponsored the construction of the façade at his own expense. However work on the façade remained incomplete until 1725 when it was finally finished by order of Pope Benedict XIII.

In 1431, the Church and the adjacent Convent of the Dominicans was the site of a Papal conclave. The city of Rome was in an uproar upon the death of Pope Martin V (Colonna), whose family had dominated Roman political life for fifteen years, and enriched themselves on the wealth of the Church. There was fighting in the streets on a daily basis, and the Plaza in front of the Minerva, because of the configuration of streets, houses, church and monastery, could easily be fortified and defended. The Sacristy of the Church served as the meeting hall for the fourteen cardinals (out of nineteen) who attended the Conclave, which began on 1 March 1431. The dormitory of the friars in the Convent to the immediate north of the Church, served as the living quarters for the cardinals and their refectory and kitchen. On 3 March they elected Cardinal Gabriele Condulmaro, who took the name Eugenius IV. A second Conclave was held at the Minerva, on 4–6 March 1447, following the death of Pope Eugenius, once again in the midst of disturbances involving the Orsini supporters of Pope Eugenius and his enemies the Colonna. Eighteen cardinals (out of a total of twenty-six) were present and elected Cardinal Tommaso Parentucelli da Sarzana as Pope Nicholas V.

The Minerva has been a titular church since 1557, and a minor basilica since 1566. The church&#x27;s first titular cardinal was Michele Ghislieri who became Pope Pius V in 1566. He raised the church to the level of minor basilica in that same year.

In the 16th century Giuliano da Sangallo made changes in the choir area, and in 1600 Carlo Maderno enlarged the apse, added Baroque decorations and created the present façade with its pilastered tripartite division in Renaissance style. Marks on this façade dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries indicate various flood levels of the Tiber .

Between 1848 and 1855 Girolamo Bianchedi directed an important program of restoration when most of the Baroque additions were removed and the blank walls were covered with neo-gothic frescos giving the interior the Neo-Gothic appearance that it has today.

The basilica&#x27;s stained glass windows are mostly from the 19th century. In 1909, the great organ was constructed by the firm of Carlo Vegezzi Bossi. The organ was restored in 1999.

The inscriptions found in S. Maria sopra Minerva have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.

===Convent and &quot;Studium&quot;===

In 1288 the theology component of the provincial curriculum for the education of the friars was relocated from the &quot;studium provinciale&quot; at the Roman basilica of Santa Sabina to the &quot;studium conventuale&quot; at Santa Maria sopra Minerva which was redesignated as a &quot;studium particularis theologiae&quot;. At various times in its history this &quot;studium&quot; served as a &quot;studium generale&quot; for the Roman province of the Order.

===College of Saint Thomas===
The late 16th century saw the &quot;studium&quot; at Santa Maria sopra Minerva undergo transformation. Thomas Aquinas, who had been canonized in 1323 by Pope John XXII, was proclaimed the fifth Latin Doctor of the Church by Pius V in 1567. In his honor, in 1577 the Spanish Dominican Msgr. Juan Solano, O.P., former bishop of Cusco, Peru, funded the reorganization of the &quot;studium&quot; at the convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva on the model of the College of St. Gregory at Valladolid in his native Spain. The result of Solano&#x27;s initiative, which underwent structural change shortly before Solano&#x27;s death in 1580, was the College of Saint Thomas () at Santa Maria sopra Minerva. The college occupied several existing convent structures, and new construction was required. At that time the convent underwent considerable reconstruction to accommodate the college and the cloister was redesigned so that side chapels could be added to the church&#x27;s northern flank. A detail from the Nolli Map of 1748 gives some idea of the disposition of buildings when the Minerva convent housed the College of St. Thomas.

===Offices of the Inquisition===
On 14 September 1628, by papal decree, the convent of Minerva was designated as the seat of the Congregation of the Holy Office. It thus became the place where the tribunal of the Roman Inquisition set up by Paul III in 1542 held the Secret Congregation meetings during which the sentences were read out. It was in a room of the Minerva Convent on 22 June 1633 that the father of modern astronomy Galileo Galilei, after being tried for heresy, abjured his scientific theses, i.e. those of the Copernican theory.

In the late 18th and early 19th century the suppression of religious orders hampered the mission of the Order and the College of St. Thomas. During the French occupation of Rome from 1797 to 1814 the college declined and even briefly closed its doors from 1810 to 1815. The Order gained control of the convent once again in 1815, only for it to be expropriated by the Italian government in 1870.

In 1873 the &quot;Collegium Divi Thomæ de Urbe&quot; was forced to leave the Minerva for good, eventually being relocated at the convent of Saints Dominic and Sixtus in 1932 and being transformed into the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; in 1963.

The Dominicans eventually were allowed to return to the Minerva and part of the convent.

==Interior==
Among several important works of art in the church are Michelangelo&#x27;s statue &quot;Cristo della Minerva&quot; (1521) and the late 15th-century (1488–93) cycle of frescos in the Carafa Chapel by Filippino Lippi. The basilica also houses many funerary monuments including the tombs of Doctor of the Church Saint Catherine of Siena (1347-1380), who was a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic; the Dominican friar Blessed Fra Angelico (c. 1395–1455); and ornate monuments to the Medici popes: Leo X (born Giovanni de Medici, c. 1475–1521) and Clement VII (born Giulio de Medici, c. 1478–1534), designed by Baccio Bandinelli.

===Carafa Chapel===
The Carafa Chapel, with late 15th-century frescoes (1488–1493) by Filippino Lippi, was commissioned by Cardinal Oliviero Carafa in honour of Saint Thomas Aquinas. There are two Marian scenes, the &quot;Annunciation&quot; and the &quot;Assumption&quot;; over the altar is his St Thomas presenting Cardinal Carafa to the Blessed Virgin, and on the right-hand wall his Glory of St Thomas. It was inaugurated in 1493, and is also known as the Chapel of St Thomas Aquinas. The relics of St Thomas Aquinas were kept in this chapel until 1511, when they were moved to Naples. Designed by Pirro Ligorio in 1559, the tomb of Gian Pietro Carafa, who became Pope Paul IV in 1555, is also in the chapel.

===Cappella Capranica===
The chapel is also known as the Chapel of the Rosary. The stucco ceiling was made in 1573 by Marcello Venusti. The chapel contains the tomb of Cardinal Domenico Capranica by Andrea Bregno.

===Michelangelo&#x27;s Cristo della Minerva===

The &quot;Cristo della Minerva&quot;, also known as &quot;Christ the Redeemer&quot; or &quot;Christ Carrying the Cross&quot;, is a marble sculpture by Michelangelo Buonarroti, finished in 1521, located to the left of the main altar.

===Cappella Aldobrandini===
The Aldobrandini chapel was designed by Giacomo della Porta but it is Carlo Maderno that completed della Porta&#x27;s project (after 1602). It was consecrated in 1611. The canvas depicting the Institution of the Eucharist and dated from 1594 is by Federico Fiori. The monument to the parents of Pope Clement VIII, Salvestro Aldobrandini and Luisa Dati, is by Giacomo della Porta. The first Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament to be approved by the Holy See was established in this chapel, with St. Ignatius of Loyola as one of its earliest members. This chapel contains the Federico Barocci altarpiece depicting the &quot;Communion of the Apostles&quot;.

===Cappella Raymond of Penyafort===
The chapel dedicated to Raymond of Penyafort houses the tomb of Cardinal Juan Díaz de Coca, by Andrea Bregno. The ceiling fresco &quot;Jesus Christ as a Judge, between two angels&quot; is by Melozzo da Forlì.

===Burials===
Saint Catherine of Siena is buried here (except her head, which is in the Basilica of San Domenico in Siena). Beyond the sacristy, the room where she died in 1380 was reconstructed here by Antonio Barberini in 1637. This room is the first transplanted interior, and the progenitor of familiar 19th and 20th century museum &quot;period rooms.&quot; The frescoes by Antoniazzo Romano that decorated the original walls, however, are now lost.

The famous early Renaissance painter Fra Angelico died in the adjoining convent and was buried in the church. (He had painted a fresco cycle in the cloister on the initiative of Cardinal Juan de Torquemada, but those paintings have not survived.)

Before the construction of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, the Minerva served as the church in Rome of the Florentines, and therefore it contains numerous tombs of prelates, nobles and citizens coming from that Tuscan city. For example, the elaborate tombs of the Medici Popes - Leo X (Giovanni de Medici) and Clement VII (Giulio de Medici) - are located here, designed by Florentine sculptor Baccio Bandinelli. Curiously, Diotisalvi Neroni, a refugee who had taken part in the plot against Piero de&#x27; Medici, is also buried in the church.

The tombs of Popes Urban VII and Paul IV are located in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, as are the Cardinal-nephew of Pope Nicholas III Latino Malabranca Orsini, Michel Mazarin (Archbishop of Aix) who was the brother of Cardinal Jules Mazarin, the Byzantine philosopher George of Trebizond, and two Renaissance theorists and practitioners, Filarete in architecture and Mariano Santo in surgery.

Cardinal Astorgio Agnensi has his tomb monument in the cloister.

==Minerva&#x27;s Pulcino==

In front of the church there is one of the most curious monuments of Rome, the so-called &quot;Pulcino della Minerva&quot;. It is a statue designed by the Baroque era sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini (and executed by his pupil Ercole Ferrata in 1667) of an elephant as the supporting base for the Egyptian obelisk found in the Dominicans&#x27; garden. It is the shortest of the eleven Egyptian obelisks in Rome and is said to have been one of two obelisks moved from Sais, where they were built during the 589 BC-570 BC reign of the pharaoh Apries, from the Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt. The two obelisks were brought to Rome by Diocletian, during his reign as emperor from 284 to 305, for placement at the Temple of Isis, which stood nearby. The Latin inscription on the base, chosen by the pope who commissioned the sculpture to support the obelisk found on the site, Alexander VII, is said to represent that &quot;...a strong mind is needed to support a solid knowledge&quot;.

The inspiration for the unusual composition came from &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot; (&quot;Poliphilo&#x27;s Dream of the Strife of Love&quot;), an unusual 15th century novel probably by Francesco Colonna. The novel&#x27;s main character meets an elephant made of stone carrying an obelisk, and the accompanying woodcut illustration in the book is quite similar to Bernini&#x27;s design for the base for the obelisk. The curious placement of the obelisk through the body of the elephant is identical.

The sturdy appearance of the structure earned it the popular nickname of &quot;Porcino&quot; (&quot;Piggy&quot;) for a while. The name for the structure eventually changed to &quot;Pulcino&quot;, the Italian for a small or little &quot;chick&quot;. This may have been a reference to the comparatively short height of the obelisk or, an obscure reference to the major charity of the Dominicans to assist young women needing dowries, who made a procession in the courtyard every year. The latter were once depicted in a local painting as three tiny figures with the Virgin Mary presenting purses to them.

==Cultural references==
The elephant and obelisk monument and the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva feature in the novel &#x27;The Tomb of Alexander&#x27; by Sean Hemingway. In the novel it is claimed that a secret passageway beneath the church leads to a chamber beneath the elephant monument which contains the body of Alexander the Great, placed there in the 17th century by Pope Alexander VII. This is entirely a work of fiction and the theory is unproven.

Dalí&#x27;s painting &#x27;Les Elephants&#x27; includes two elephants with long spindly legs that appear to be carrying obelisks; on closer inspection, the obelisks are floating. Dalí also utilizes this motif in Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening (1944) and The Temptation of Saint Anthony (1946). See Monica Bowen&#x27;s blog Alberti&#x27;s Window.

<text>Kantrum (, ) is a type of folk music played by the Khmer in Isan, Thailand, living near the border with Cambodia. It is a fast, traditional dance music. In its purest form, cho-kantrum, singers, percussion and fiddles dominate the sound. A more modern form using electric instrumentation arose in the mid-1980s. 

==Language==
Kantrum is interesting from a linguistic perspective. As the Khmer native to Thailand are bilingual, kantrum songs can be sung in Thai (Isan dialect), Northern Khmer or a combination of the two. In the case of the later, it is most common that a complete verse will be sung in Thai followed by a reciprocating verse in Khmer. However, code switching between the two languages within the same verse also occurs, lending to a wide variety of possibilities for rhyming and tonal euphony.

==Performers==
In the late-1980s, Darkie became the genre&#x27;s biggest star, crossing into mainstream markets in the later 1990s. In the mid-2010s, Darkie found popularity online, particularly among Westerners, for his rendition of the Sinn Sisamouth song Sat Tee Touy. Another artist known for Kantrum is Chalermpol Malakham, although he is also a popular performer of the Luk Thung and Morlam styles of music.

<doc id="879206" wikidata="Q492642" url="?curid=879206" title="Kai yang">
<text>Kai yang or gai yang (, , ), also known as kai ping or gai ping (), or pīng kai (, ), is a Lao dish originating in Laos, but it is now commonly eaten throughout the whole of Thailand. The dish is a standard staple of street markets and readily available at all times. The town of Seno in Savannakhet, Laos is renowned for their flavorful and tender &quot;Ping kai Xeno&quot; or &quot;Xeno grilled chicken&quot; and has earns official recognition as Savannakhet’s symbol and culinary legacy. Ping kai Xeno is also a National One District One Product (ODOP) Trademark. The Association of Xeno Grilled Chicken, formed in 2016, has developed a comprehensive set of rules and regulations for all Ping kai Xeno to protect its economic interests and culinary tradition. They include the requirement that all Ping kai Xeno be prepared using only chicken from the Xeno areas and its unique marinating and grilling techniques. Being a typical Laotian dish, it is often paired with green papaya salad and sticky rice (Thai/Isan: ข้าวเหนียว, ; , ) or eaten with sticky rice in bamboo (khao lam in Lao). It is also eaten with raw vegetables, and often dipped in spicy sauces such as Laotian jaew bong.

In Thailand, there are also many famous Thai Muslim varieties of &quot;kai yang&quot; which are not of Lao origin at all, but more akin to the grilled chicken from Malaysia.

==Names==
The Laotian name for the dish is pīng kai () and means &quot;roast chicken&quot;. In Laotian restaurants in the West, it is known as &quot;Laotian barbecued chicken&quot; or &quot;ping gai&quot;. The Thai and Isaan term is usually spelled ไก่ย่าง (&quot;kai yang&quot;; Isan: ), although ปิ้งไก่ (&quot;ping kai&quot;; Isan: ), a Thai letter rendering of the Laotian name, would be understood in Isan and in most of Thailand as well although to Thai ears it would sound a bit quaint, due to the slight grammatical difference between Thai and Laotian. Thais would put &quot;kai&quot; before &quot;ping&quot; rather than the other way round. In the West, where this dish often features on the menu of Thai restaurants, it is either known by its Thai name &quot;kai yang&quot; or as &quot;Thai barbecued chicken&quot;.

==Ingredients and preparation==
A whole chicken is often halved and pounded flat. It is marinated and then grilled over a low heat on a charcoal flame for a long time, but is not cooked to be burnt or dry. The marinade typically includes fish sauce, garlic, turmeric, coriander root (cilantro), and white pepper. Many variations exist, and it is also quite common to find black soy sauce, hoisin sauce, shallots, leaves and seeds of coriander, lemongrass, chilis, ginger, vinegar, palm sugar, and MSG.

<text>Tartus ( / ALA-LC: &quot;Ṭarṭūs&quot;; known in the County of Tripoli as Tortosa and also transliterated from French Tartous) is a major port city on the Mediterranean coast of Syria. It is the second largest port city in Syria (after Latakia), and the largest city in Tartus Governorate. Tartus was under the governance of Latakia Governorate until the 1970s, when it became a separate governorate. The population is 458,327 (2023 estimate). In the summer it is a vacation spot for many Syrians.

==Etymology==
The name derives from Ancient (Antarados or &quot;Anti-Aradus&quot;, meaning &quot;The town facing Aradus). In Latin, its name became &quot;Tortosa&quot;. The original name survives in its Arabic form as &quot;Ṭarṭūs&quot; (), from which the French &quot;Tartous&quot; and English &quot;Tartus&quot; derive.

== History ==
=== Phoenician Antaradus ===

Tartus was founded as a Phoenician colony of Aradus. The colony was known as Antaradus. Not much remains of the Phoenician Antaradus, the mainland settlement of the more important and larger settlements of Aradus, off the shore of Tartus, and the nearby site of Amrit.

=== Greco-Roman and Byzantine era ===
The city was called Antaradus in Latin. Athanasius reports that, under Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, Cymatius, the  Christian Orthodox bishop of Antaradus and also of Aradus (whose names indicate that they were neighbouring towns facing each other) was driven out by the Arians. At the First Council of Constantinople in 381, Mocimus appears as bishop of Aradus. At the time of the Council of Ephesus (431), some sources speak of a Musaeus as bishop of Aradus and Antaradus, while others mention only Aradus or only Antaradus. Alexander was at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 as bishop of Antaradus, Paulus as bishop of Aradus, while, at a synod held at Antioch shortly before, Paulus took part as bishop of both Aradus and Antaradus. In 458, Atticus signed, as bishop of Aradus, the letter of the bishops of the province of Phoenicia Prima to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian protesting about the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. Theodorus or Theodosius, who died in 518, is mentioned as bishop of Antaradus in a letter from the bishops of the province regarding Severus of Antioch that was read at a synod held by Patriarch Mennas of Constantinople. The acts of the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 were signed by Asyncretius as bishop of Aradus. At the time of the Crusades, Antaradus, by then called Tartus or Tortosa, was a Latin Church diocese, whose bishop also held the titles of Aradus and Maraclea (perhaps Rachlea). It was united to the see of Famagosta in Cyprus in 1295.

No longer a residential bishopric, Antaradus is listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

The city was favored by Constantine for its devotion to the cult of the Virgin Mary. The first chapel to be dedicated to the Virgin was built here in the 3rd century.

=== Early Islamic era ===
Islamic rule was established in Syria in 634. In the years before, Arab merchants would spread the word of Islam and locals embraced the new religion while others continued to practice their respective faiths. During the Arab conquest of the Levant, caliphate armies conquered Tartus under the leadership of Ubadah ibn al-Samit in 636. While Ubadah occupied Tartus, Mu&#x27;awiya I came to the city, and built an Amsar complex within the city, while also tasking fiefs to the garrison commanders. Tartus hosted Khadijah, the wife of Muhammad when she came with her father Khuwaylid ibn Asad.

=== Crusades ===

The Crusaders called the city Antartus, and also Tortosa. It was captured in 1099 during the First Crusade by Frankish forces. Once the land was seized, the cathedral was built over the spot of a Byzantine church, but it was later taken over by Muslims. It was recaptured by Raymond of Saint-Gilles in February 1102 after two weeks of siege, then it was left in 1105 to his son Alfonso Jordan and was known as Tortosa. In 1123 the Crusaders built the semi-fortified Cathedral of Our Lady of Tortosa over a Byzantine church that was popular with pilgrims.

In 1152, Tortosa was handed to the Knights Templar, who used it as a military headquarters. They engaged in some major building projects, constructing a castle around 1165 with a large chapel and an elaborate keep, surrounded by thick double concentric walls. The Templars&#x27; mission was to protect the city and surrounding lands, some of which had been occupied by Christian settlers, from Muslim attack. Nur ad-Din Zangi captured Tartus from the Crusaders for a brief time before he lost it again.

The city of Tortosa was recaptured by Saladin in 1188, and the main Templar headquarters was relocated to Cyprus. However, in Tortosa, some Templars were able to retreat into the keep, which they continued to use as a base for the next 100 years. They steadily added to its fortifications until it also fell, in 1291. Tortosa was the last outpost of the Templars on the Syrian mainland, after which they retreated to a garrison on the nearby island of Arwad, which they held for another decade. After the occupation by the Mamluks, the city lost its prestige, which it regained only under the Ottoman rule.

===Ottoman era===
During the Ottoman rule, the city gained importance mainly due to trade with Cyprus and Europe. At the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, it became one of the coastal defense points due to its strategic port. In 1832, at the beginning of the First Egyptian-Ottoman War, the city and its surroundings were conquered by Muhammad Ali Pasha, then ruler of Egypt.

In 1839, the Ottoman Empire reconquered its Syrian coastal territories from Egypt with the support of Great Britain. In 1840, during the Syrian War, British frigates HMS , HMS and , with the help of a landing force of marines, attacked the citadel in Tartus. Despite heavy losses, the British failed to capture the fort. Ottoman rule continued until 1918.

===Modern era===
On May 23, 2016, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for three suicide bombings at a bus station in Tartus, which had remained largely unaffected since the Syrian Civil War began in 2011 and continues to remain that way, as a stronghold of the Government of Syria. Purportedly targeting Alawite gatherings, the bombs killed 48 people. In Jableh, similarly insulated, another four bombers killed over a hundred people.

On December 15, 2024, Israeli Air Forces bombed the coastal city and its vicinity in an offensive which targeted military facilities following the fall of the Assad regime. At 11:49 pm, a 3.1 earthquake which might have been caused by the explosions was reported with its epicenter about off the coast of Banias, according to seismic sensors in the region. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that the strikes were &quot;some of the heaviest in the region since 2012&quot;.

== Geography ==
The city lies on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea bordered by the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range to the east. Arwad, the only inhabited island on the Syrian coast, is located a few kilometers off the shore of Tartus. Tartus occupies most of the coastal plain, surrounded to the east by mountains composed mainly of limestone and, in certain places around the town of Souda, basalt.

===Climate===
Tartus has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen (&quot;Csa&quot;) with mild, wet winters, hot and humid summers, and short transition periods in April and October. The hills to the east of the city create a cooler climate with higher rainfall. Tartus is known for its relatively mild weather and high precipitation compared to inland Syria.

==Economy==
===Industry and navy===

Tartus is an important trade center in Syria and has one of the two main ports of the country on the Mediterranean. The city port is experiencing major expansion as a lot of Iraqi imports come through the port of Tartus to aid reconstruction efforts in Iraq. There is a cement plant in the city with a production capacity of 6.5 thousand tons of cement per day. The pharmaceutical industry is also represented in the city, since the beginning of the conflict in the country, seven pharmaceutical factories have been opened and another 3 are under construction. Food, chemical and wood processing industries are also represented in the urban industrial zone.

Many residents are employed in the service sector.

===Tourism===

Tartus is a popular destination for tourists with many resorts along the Syrian coast.

===Russian naval base===

Tartus hosts a Soviet-era naval supply and maintenance base, under a 1971 agreement with Syria, which is still staffed by Russian naval personnel. Tartus is the last Russian military base outside the former Soviet Union, and its only Mediterranean fueling spot, sparing Russia&#x27;s warships the trip back to their Black Sea bases through straits in Turkey, a NATO member.

==Culture==
===Art and festivals===
Many cultural and literary events, art festivals and theater are held in the city, and in the summer, the activities of the Tartous Art Festival are held in the presence of distinguished Syrian and Arab artists, in addition to a tourist festival called Antaradus.

Assi Rahbani and Mansour Rahbani, frequent visitors to Tartus, immortalized their love for the city in a song, &quot;Shabab Al-Hilweh&quot;, sung by Nasri Shamseddine. Among the composers whose name is associated with Tartous and Husayn al-Baher is the musician Safwan Bahlawan Ibn Arwad who has a distinguished performance in the pub and his artistic presence on the Arab art scene. Residents of the city include the singer Farrah Yousef, finalist of the singing competition &quot;Arab Idol&quot; and Taim Hasan, an actor known for his dramatic roles in Syria and the Arab world. 

Many poets and writers have lived in Tartus, including Saadallah Wannous, Muhammad Omran, Rasha Omran and Nadim Muhammad. Some writers hold their literary seminars and lectures in the local cultural center.

===Museum===

St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral was originally built in the 12th century as a Templar church. The cathedral was used as a mosque after the Muslim capture of the city, then as a barracks by the Ottomans. It was renovated under the French Mandate and since 1956, the building has housed the National Museum of Tartus, which exhibits antiquities recovered from Amrit and many other places in the region.

In September 2021, the Directorate-General of Antiquities began a comprehensive renovation and fixing operations of architectural elements that were subjected to fragmentation at the National Museum of Tartus.

===Sports===

Tartus is the home city of only one sports club: Al-Sahel SC, founded in 1971. 4 types of sports are being practiced by the club including: football, basketball, table tennis and bodybuilding. The club plays in both stadiums in the city: Municipal (capacity 1,300) and Bassel Al-Assad (capacity 8,000).

In 2018, Al-Sahel was promoted to the Syrian Premier League for the first time in their history. In the 2020-21 season, they were relegated and have been playing in the Syrian League 1st Division ever since. The women&#x27;s basketball team competes at the top level of the Syrian basketball league.

==Education==
A number of colleges affiliated with Latakia University, such as the College of Arts and the College of Technical Engineering, were opened as part of the government&#x27;s policy to expand higher education among the various Syrian cities.
The city also has a number of institutes, secondary schools and primary schools affiliated with the Ministry of Education, in addition to private educational institutes and secondary schools.

==Local infrastructure==


Tartous has expanded over time. Gardens in the city include Al-Basel Park. Tartus was an attractive destination for tourists from Europe and Arab countries prior to the civil war.

===Transportation===

Tartus has a developed road system. Tartus and Latakia are connected by the M1 international highway, and the city is connected to Damascus by the M5 highway via Homs. The establishment of an international road linking Tartus with Iraq and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf through the Syrian Desert was recently studied, as it is the shortest road connecting the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean and thus Europe from the Port of Tartus. The main commercial coastal road of the city is Al-Thawra Street, named after 1963 March Revolution.

The railway network operated by Chemins de Fer Syriens connects Tartus with other cities in Syria, although currently only the Latakia-Tartus and Tartus-Al Akkari-Homs passenger connections are in service. The restoration of the rail link with Iraq (IRR) and the proposal to extend the railway from Al-Qaim in Iraq through Al-Bukamal in Syria to Homs for a total distance of 270 kilometers and thence to Tartus are currently (2022) under discussion.

== Main sights ==
The historic centre of Tartus consists of more recent buildings built on and inside the walls of the Crusader-era Templar fortress, whose moat still separates this old town from the modern city on its northern and eastern sides. Outside the fortress few historic remains can be seen, with the exception of the former Romanesque-Gothic cathedral Cathedral of Notre-Dame of Tartus, from the 12th century.
Tartus and the surrounding area are rich in antiquities and archeological sites. Various important and well known sites are located within a 30-minute drive from Tartus. These attractions include:
* The old city of Tartus.
* Margat Castle, north of the city.
* The historic town of Safita.
* Arwad island and castle.
* The ancient Cathedral of Our Lady of Tortosa, now used as the city museum.
* Beit el-Baik Palace.
* Sheikh Saleh al-Ali shrine in Al-Shaykh Badr.

Aside from these historic sites, more modern attractions include:
* Alrimal Alzahabeya beach resort.
* Junada hotel (previously called Porto Tartous).

* Mashta Al Helou resort.

The outlying town of Al Hamidiyah just south of Tartus is notable for having a Greek-speaking population of about 3,000 who are the descendants of Ottoman Greek Muslims from the island of Crete but usually confusingly referred to as Cretan Turks. Their ancestors moved there in the late 19th century as refugees from Crete after the Kingdom of Greece acquired the island from the Ottoman Empire following the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. Since the start of the Iraqi War, a few thousand Iraqi nationals now reside in Tartus.

<doc id="879215" wikidata="Q1062439" url="?curid=879215" title="Chanticleer (ensemble)">
<text>Chanticleer () is a full-time male classical vocal ensemble based in San Francisco, California, founded in 1978. It is known for its interpretations of Renaissance music, for which they were founded, but also a wide repertoire of jazz, gospel and contemporary classical music. Its name is derived from the &quot;clear singing rooster&quot; in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. The ensemble has made award-winning recordings.

==History==
Chanticleer was founded in 1978 by tenor Louis Botto, who sang with the group until 1989, and served as Artistic Director until his death from AIDS in 1997. As a graduate student of musicology, Botto found that much of the medieval and Renaissance music he was studying was not being performed, and, because of this, he formed the group to perform this music with an all-male ensemble, as it was traditionally sung during the Renaissance.

Originally, the group contained ten singers, but its size has varied from eight to twelve. Currently, Chanticleer comprises twelve men, including two basses, one baritone, three tenors, and six countertenors (three altos and three sopranos).

The original members included Jim Armington (tenor), Ted Bakkila (baritone), Rob Bell (countertenor), Louis Botto (who sang alto as well as tenor), Sanford Dole (tenor), Kevin Freeman (bass), Tom Hart (baritone), Jonathan Klein (baritone), Neal Rogers (tenor), Tim Gibler (bass), Randall Wong (countertenor), and Doug Wyatt (bass). However, only ten of the singers were available to go on tour.

When the ensemble first became full-time in 1991, its members included Eric Alatorre (bass and longest-standing member as of his retirement after the 2018–2019 season), Frank Albinder (baritone), Kevin Baum (tenor), Mark Daniel (tenor), Kenneth Fitch (countertenor), Jonathan Goodman (tenor), Tim Gibler (bass and last member of the original ensemble), Joseph Jennings (countertenor and Music Director), Chad Runyon (baritone), Foster Sommerlad (countertenor), Matthew Thompson (tenor), and Philip Wilder (countertenor).

In May 2007, Chanticleer released &quot;And On Earth, Peace: A Chanticleer Mass&quot; (Warner Classics) a new mass written by five contemporary composers. Israeli-born composer Shulamit Ran wrote the Credo to the Hebrew text &quot;Ani Ma&#x27;amin&quot;; US composer Douglas Cuomo contributed the Kyrie; Turkish-American composer Kamran Ince composed the Gloria section to a sufi text; English composer Ivan Moody composed the Sanctus; and Irish composer Michael McGlynn (director of Anúna) composed the Agnus Dei. The Mass was premiered in performance at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and was followed by six performances throughout the San Francisco Bay area.

On October 16, 2007, Chanticleer released &quot;Let it Snow,&quot; the group&#x27;s 29th recording. A portion of the album is accompanied by orchestra and/or big band; as such, the album brings a new sound to Chanticleer&#x27;s almost exclusively a cappella repertoire.

== Notable past members ==
* Frank Albinder (baritone), designed the concept and chose the repertoire for Chanticleer&#x27;s Grammy Award-winning album &quot;Colors of Love&quot;
* Philip Wilder
* Matt Alber
* Terry Barber

== Awards and honors ==
Joseph Jennings (as artistic director) and Chanticleer won a Grammy Award for Best Small Ensemble Performance for their 1999 recording &quot;Colors of Love&quot;. Chanticleer was awarded two Grammy Awards, in categories Best Small Ensemble Performance and Best Classical Contemporary Composition, their 2002 recording of Taverner&#x27;s &quot;Lamentations and Praises&quot;. Their 2003 recording &quot;Our American Journey&quot; was nominated for a Grammy a year later.

In November 2007, in its 30th anniversary season, Chanticleer was named &quot;Musical America&quot;″s 2008 Ensemble of the year. This marks the first time a vocal ensemble has received this award. Additionally, on October 9, 2008, Chanticleer became the first vocal ensemble to be inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Rugby Canada was incorporated in 1974, and stems from the Canadian Rugby Football Union, a body established in 1884 that now governs amateur Canadian football as Football Canada; and the now-defunct Rugby Union of Canada, established in 1929. Rugby Canada administers the Canada national rugby union team and sanctions the Rugby Canada National Junior Championship, a national competition for under-20 men&#x27;s teams. It previously sanctioned the Super League as the premier level of men&#x27;s competition in the country, but scrapped that league after the Americas Rugby Championship was created in 2009 as a two-stage competition in which the first involved only Canadian teams.

==History==

===Canadian Rugby Football Union===
The Canadian Rugby Football Union was established in 1884 with the specific purpose of organizing play-off games between various union champions. Representatives from the Montreal Football club (now known as the Westmount Rugby Club), the Toronto Rugby Football Club and the Hamilton Rugby Football Club, had meetings in Toronto and Montreal. The union continued to use the English rugby rules, and at the end of the season the winning club of the Quebec Championship played the Ontario Champion for the Club Championship of the Dominion.
This organization (also known as the Canadian Rugby Union) was the forerunner of the Canadian Football League, as rugby football in Canada evolved into Canadian football with rugby union being known as &quot;English rugby&quot;. To make matters more confusing the word &quot;rugby&quot; continued to be applied to Canadian football. It was not until 1967 that the original CRU finally cleared up this confusion by renaming itself the Canadian Amateur Football Association; it adopted its current name of Football Canada in 1986.

===Rugby Union of Canada===
The Rugby Union of Canada, re-formed in 1965 and incorporated in 1974, is affiliated to World Rugby. It has competed in nine out of ten Rugby World Cups (the first in 1987 in Australia and New Zealand) and in the World Rugby Sevens Series.

<doc id="879231" wikidata="Q213014" url="?curid=879231" title="Akola">
<text>Akola () is a major city in the Vidarbha region of the Indian state of Maharashtra. The third largest city in Eastern Maharashtra after Nagpur and Amravati, it is located about east of the state capital, Mumbai, and west of the second capital, Nagpur. Akola is the administrative headquarters of the Akola district located in the Amravati division. 

Akola is located on the banks of the Morna River. Although it is not considered a common tourist destination, Akola is an important city due to its history, culture, politics, and agriculture. It also has a prominent road and rail junction in the Tapti River valley that functions as a commercial trading centre. A National Highway Number 161, which is also termed as NH6, passes through Akola.

Akola is an important educational centre with several colleges affiliated with Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University. The city is developing into a market centre. The primary language spoken by the people of Akola is Marathi.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Akola&quot; is believed to have originated from the Marathi word &quot;Akol,&quot; which means &quot;the end&quot; or &quot;the boundary.&quot; This term is thought to refer to the city&#x27;s historical role as a boundary or administrative center in the region. According to local tradition, the city was named after Maharaja Akolsingh, who was an influential figure in the area.

The evolution of the name &quot;Akola&quot; reflects its historical and cultural significance in the Vidarbha region. The city&#x27;s etymology encapsulates its role in regional governance and its geographical context as a prominent location in Maharashtra.

==History==
=== Early medieval history (Classical) ===
Akola is mentioned to be a part of Berar province and the legendary kingdom of Vidarbha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata.

=== Late medieval history ===
The period of Muslim rule began when Alauddin Khalji, Sultan of Delhi, conquered the region in the early 14th century. Subsequently, the region became part of the Bahmani Sultanate, which had seceded from the Delhi Sultanate in the mid-14th century. By the end of the 15th century, the Bahmani Sultanate fragmented into smaller kingdoms, and in 1572, Berar was incorporated into the Nizam Shahi Sultanate of Ahmednagar. The Nizam Shahis ceded Berar to the Mughal Empire in 1595, and the Mughals ruled the Berar province during the 17th century. The Akola fort was heavily fortified during Mughal king Aurangzeb&#x27;s rule. As Mughal rule started to unravel at the start of the 18th century, Asif Jah I, Nizam of Hyderabad seized the southern provinces of the empire (including Berar) in 1724 to form an independent state.

=== Maratha Empire ===
The Battle of Argaon in 1803 was fought in Akola between the British and the Marathas during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. In the third Anglo-Maratha War, the last Peshwa, Baji Rao II, was defeated. In 1853, the Akola district together with the rest of Berar, came under the administration of the British East India Company.

=== Post-independence ===
After India&#x27;s independence in 1947 from the British Government, the newly formed country was divided into different states. The Congress&#x27;s proposed linguistic provinces plan before the Independence of India had positioned Akola as the headquarters of the Berar region.

<doc id="879233" wikidata="Q1321596" url="?curid=879233" title="Hoo Peninsula">
<text>The Hoo Peninsula is a peninsula in Kent, England, separating the estuaries of the rivers Thames and Medway. It is dominated by a line of chalk, clay and sand hills, surrounded by an extensive area of marshland composed of alluvial silt. The name &quot;Hoo&quot; is a Saxon word believed to mean &#x27;spur of land&#x27; or refers to the &#x27;distinct heel-shape of the ridge of hills&#x27; through Hoo. Hoo features in the Domesday Book. The peninsula is home to internationally and nationally protected wildlife sites as well as industrial facilities and energy industries.

==History==

The Romans have been credited with the first two attempts at building a sea wall. The subsequent draining of the marshes created pastureland to support sheep.

The area is rich in archaeology. Bronze Age implements and Jutish cemeteries have been found on the peninsula, and Roman pottery at Cooling. It was once the point of departure across the ancient Saxon fording point over the River Thames to Essex.

Much of the peninsula lies in one of the Saxon divisions of England called &quot;hundreds&quot;: here it is the &quot;Hundred of Hoo&quot;. To be precise, the Hundred comprised the parishes and churches of Hoo, High Halstow, St Mary Hoo, Allhallows and part of Stoke. The Isle of Grain, then a complete island, was in the Hundred of Gillingham; the remainder of the parish of Stoke was in the Hundred of Shamel.

William the Conqueror granted his half-brother, Odo, the large estate of Hoo.

During the First World War this peninsula was the site of an explosives factory and storage facility.

==Geography==

===The marshes===
The Peninsula&#x27;s marshlands are part of the North Kent Marshes and now form a major part of two protected areas: the Thames Estuary and Marshlands, and the Medway Estuary and Marshes. The Thames Estuary area covers the from Gravesend to the Isle of Grain; the Medway Area from Rochester to the Isle of Grain: a total of of marshlands. Both are Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Protected Areas (SPA). They include coastal grazing marsh, intertidal mudflats, saltmarsh and lagoons. On the line of hills lies the Northward Hill National Nature Reserve.

===Nature reserve===

The Hoo Peninsula is home to a 129.7 acre nature reserve located in High Halstow, one of the many villages on the peninsula, called High Halstow NNR. The reserve is also part of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Northward Hill SSSI site which includes 270 hectares of grazing marsh, woodland and farmland. The area features the largest heronry in Britain, where some 150–200 pairs nest. A heronry has been in the woods from at least 1947, when it was mentioned in a book, &quot;The Hundred of Hoo&quot; by Ralph Arnold. High Halstow NNR was declared a National Nature Reserve in 1951.

===The Thames and Medway Canal===

The Rivers Thames and Medway were joined by the eight-mile long Thames &amp; Medway Canal, the construction of which started in 1805. With basins providing ports and access to the two rivers at Gravesend and Strood, the canal passed through a two-mile tunnel at Higham, broken in the centre by a shaft to allow boats to pass. Construction was difficult and expensive and it was not completed until 1824. Shortly afterwards, the tunnel became part of the railway linking Higham with Strood. The line of this now-silted canal can be considered a convenient boundary marking the landward edge of the peninsula.

The tunnel passes through large beds of chalk. To cut engineering costs many sections were not lined, which caused various rock falls between 1957 and 2004. As these rock falls could cause derailment, the tunnel was closed to trains during 2004 and was relined with reinforced concrete. It reopened in early January 2005.

===Roads===
The only main road is the A228, which crosses the old Roman London Road (also called Watling Street, now the A2) at Strood and then follows the high ground eastwards. It meets the Medway Towns Northern Bypass (A289) at the bottom of Four Elms Hill and climbs to Chattenden, bypassing Hoo St Werburgh and High Halstow, before crossing to the Isle of Grain. On the Peninsula this road is known as the &#x27;Ratcliffe Highway&#x27;.

The other principal route on the peninsula, the B2000, heads north to Cliffe on the edge of Cliffe marshes, part of the North Kent Marshes. This is a winding country road, much used by industrial transport serving the larger farms, including Mockbeggar Farm, and the industrial jetties onto the River Thames. The B2000 passes through Cliffe Woods under the name of &#x27;Town Road&#x27;, and enters Cliffe, where it becomes first &#x27;Station Road&#x27;, from the location of the now vanished station of the Hundred of Hoo railway, and then &#x27;Church Street&#x27;. At the northern edge of the village the road becomes &#x27;Pond Hill&#x27; and leads down the cliff to an unmetalled track on the marshes.

The B2000 is rural in nature with several interesting old buildings along its route. There remains a Grade II listed red brick farmhouse dating from the 17th century &#x27;Mockbeggar Farm&#x27; and its barn, south of the farmhouse, and a Grade II building &#x27;Mortimer&#x27;s Farm House, Cliffe&#x27;.

Another Grade II-listed farmhouse is Fenn Street Farmhouse, timber-framed and medieval in origin, with parts dated to the 15th century. Its age may be judged by the fact that in 1760 the building was refaced.

There are numerous other minor roads on the higher ground, and a number of roads and trackways across the marshes, some of which eventually reach the sea walls.

=== The Hundred of Hoo Railway ===


In 1878, Henry Pye with a deputation of other local farmers met the South Eastern Railway Company with a request for a new railway to be built in the area. From this meeting a new company was established, the Hundred of Hoo Railway Company. The SER saw it as part of the development of continental traffic, and the ferry terminal at what was named Port Victoria was built as terminus of the line. The traffic did not materialise and that section of the line and the line beyond Grain closed in 1951.

The first part of the line to be opened was in March 1882, from Cliffe to Sharnal Street. This was later extended east to the Isle of Grain. Sharnal Street was the larger of the two original stations and was provided with goods sidings, where the local farmers were able to load their produce to be transported directly to the London markets. It was also at Sharnal Street that telegram and mail collections were effected.

On 14 May 1932 a branch railway was opened to the Thames estuary beyond the ancient village of Allhallows. It was intended to become a riverside resort of some size, and grandiose plans were formed. The new area was given the name of Allhallows-on-Sea. Little came of the scheme, and today all signs of that branch have disappeared, save for the water tower which supplied locomotives at the terminus – it is now a listed building. There is a holiday village on the site where the resort was intended to be.

==Industry==
The strategic location of the Hoo peninsula gave rise to the development of a range of industrial and commercial facilities. It has been home to many land-hungry industries, including power stations, oil tank farms, oil refineries, gas plants, explosive works, a container terminal, and mineral workings. Many of these are on the Isle of Grain, but some are, or were, located at Kingsnorth on the south edge of the peninsula, up the River Medway from Grain, and at Cliffe at the western end of the peninsula.

=== Energy industry ===
A number of industrial facilities on the Hoo peninsula are associated with the energy – oil, gas, petroleum and electricity – industries. This includes five power stations (Grain, Grain CCGT, Kingsnorth, Medway and Damhead Creek); four oil refineries (Medway Oil &amp; Storage Company, Berry Wiggins, BP Kent and Burmah-Total); three oil storage tank farms (Admiralty, MOSCO and BP Kent); two gas plants (SEGAS and Grain LNG); and a submarine power cable from the Netherlands (BritNed).

The oil industry was first established on the Hoo peninsula in 1908 when, in association with the naval dockyard at Sheerness, the Admiralty constructed an oil storage and ship refuelling depot at the Isle of Grain. This reflected the Royal Navy policy of building oil-fired ships which were faster, produced less visible smoke and could be refuelled at sea. By 1912 there were 19 oil tanks and two jetties in the deep water of the Medway. The tanks continued to be used until 1950s when they were incorporated into the BP refinery.

In 1923 the Medway Oil and Storage Company (MOSCO) constructed an oil refinery and tank farm close to the Admiralty site on a site acquired from the South Eastern Railway. The site included four groups of oil tanks of various sizes within earth embankments and two short jetties in the Medway. Crude oil was imported from Russia and refined on the site; the petrol was marketed as &#x27;Power Petrol&#x27;; in 1927 it was 2½ d. per gallon cheaper than Shell petrol. There was an oil tank explosion on the site in 1925 that killed three workers. MOSCO was absorbed into the Anglo-Iranian group (later BP) in 1932 after which oil refining on Grain ceased. The MOSCO site was physically incorporated into the BP refinery in 1952.

In 1924 Berry Wiggins and Company built a plant to produce bitumen at Sharnal Street on the Isle of Grain. In 1930 Berry Wiggins started the construction of an oil refinery and tank farm at Kingsnorth (TQ817723) on the site of a First World War airship base. At first Berry Wiggins used the wharf at the head of Damhead Creek, but to allow larger tankers to unload in 1937 they built the Bee Ness Jetty into East Hoo Creek and the Kethole Reach of the River Medway (TQ842726). It was reputedly the longest jetty in Britain. Oil was transferred from the jetty to the refinery through steel pipes on the underside of the jetty walkway. From 1932 oil products were exported from the refinery via an east-facing connection from the single line Grain branch of Southern Railways, the Berry Wiggins branch included three sidings (TQ808735). In 1937 the refinery had an annual oil throughput of 90,000 tonnes, and by 1954 throughput was 65,000 tonnes per year. In 1952 Berry Wiggins built a new two-stage distillation unit at their refinery, and facilities to produce asphalt for road making and other oil-derived products. In 1964 the annual throughput was 190,000 tonnes. In 1973 Berry Wiggins planned to build a new bitumen refinery at Kingsnorth to take feedstock from the adjacent BP refinery and to close its own refinery. However, the 1973-4 world oil crisis prevented these plans being realised. The old Berry Wiggins Kingsnorth refinery closed in 1977. Bee Ness jetty is extant (2019) but is in a ruined condition. Oakham Ness jetty is south of Bee Ness jetty; it was built in 1964 as part of the construction of Kingsnorth power station and was used jointly by the power station and the Berry Wiggins refinery for the import of oil. It is 2 km long and runs across Oakham Marsh to the deep water of Kethole Reach of the River Medway (TQ840719). The long-disused physical connection of the Kingsnorth branch to the Grain branch railway (TQ813739) was severed in 2002.

Construction of the BP Refinery (Kent), unofficially known as Grain Refinery, was started in 1950 and the site opened in 1952. It had an initial throughput capacity of four million tonnes per year. A catalytic reformer and aromatics plant were built in 1962. By 1964 the capacity of the refinery had increased to 9,500 tonnes per year. The refinery began to process British North Sea crude oil from June 1975. BP Kent refinery closed in 1982 after which some of the site was taken over by British Gas for a liquefied natural gas facility.

In 1957 the South Eastern Gas Board (SEGAS) constructed a catalytic reformer plant adjacent to the BP Refinery to use light distillates (naphtha) from the refinery to reform into town gas. The SEGAS process was a low pressure cyclic catalytic process which used a catalyst based on lime or magnesia to promote the reaction between hydrocarbons and steam to produce town gas. The plant was made redundant when the British gas industry converted from town gas to natural gas during the period 1967–77.  

The 2,000 MW Kingsnorth power station (TQ810721) opened in 1967 and burnt coal or oil, according to the economics of each. As with others in this area, the site has proved challenging. During building the reclaimed marshland was found to have poor load-bearing properties. Kingsnorth&#x27;s ground level was some four feet below the highest tide even then, and tide levels are expected to rise another three feet in coming years. For the planners, these disadvantages were outweighed by the proximity to London, the availability of cooling water from the River Medway, and deep-water berthing for oil tankers and colliers.

Between 1971 and 1981 the Burmah-Total oil company planned to build an oil refinery on Cliffe marshes (TQ720786). However, the oil crises of 1973-4 and 1979-81 made the project uneconomic and the plans were abandoned.

Grain oil-fired power station was constructed on a 100 ha site (TQ886755) for the CEGB. It was commissioned in 1979 and had a projected output capacity of 3,300 MW. The power station was closed in 2015 and was subsequently demolished.

Medway Power Station (TQ8707467 is a 735 megawatts gas-fired power station on the Isle of Grain in Medway next to the River Medway, it was commissioned in 1995.

Damhead Creek (TQ809728) is a 792 MWe gas-fired Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power station, commissioned in 2001.

Grain LNG Terminal (TQ862759) is a facility for the import, storage and export of liquefied natural gas (LNG). It was developed from 2002 and is now a major facility for the British gas supply industry.

Grain CCGT power station is a 1,275 MW plant consisting of three natural gas-fired Combined Cycle Gas Turbine units, it was commissioned in May 2010, and cost £580 million. The power station is able to transfer up to 340 MW of heat energy recovered from the steam condensation to run the vaporisers in the nearby Liquefied natural gas terminal.

BritNed is a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) submarine power cable between the Isle of Grain in Kent, the United Kingdom; and Maasvlakte in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It was commissioned in 2011.

=== Other industries ===
Other industries on the Hoo peninsula include an explosives works at Cliffe. This was established in 1900 by Curtis and Harvey Limited on a 128 ha site near Lower Hope Point to manufacture nitroglycerine, cordite, dynamite and guncotton. The site was expanded during the first decade of the twentieth century and by 1908 was one of the largest in the country. Further expansion occurred during the First World War, although the site closed in 1921. The foundations of the building can be seen in the landscape

A cement works was established at Cliffe in about 1860 using locally mined chalk. The Alpha Cement works was established in 1910 and operated in various guises until 1970. Today the site is an aggregate import, storage and loading facility. Aggregate is offloaded at two jetties (TQ706767) on the River Thames adjacent to Cliffe fort. Aggregate is transferred along a 1.7 km conveyor to the main site (TQ720756) where railway wagons are loaded. Facilities include loading silos, an overhead conveyor and a loading gantry. The sidings are on a branch from the Grain branch railway line. The site is operated (2019) by Brett Aggregates Limited, formerly by Blue Circle.

In 1960 BP in partnership with California Chemicals built a petrochemical plant to manufacture synthetic fibres from oil by-products.

London Thamesport is a small container seaport in the Port of London on the River Medway (TQ865742) serving the North Sea. It is located on the Isle of Grain. It was first developed as a container port in 1989 and was developed as a deep-water port from 2001.

<text>The Argentine Rugby Union (, abbreviated &quot;UAR&quot;) is the governing body for rugby union in Argentina. It is a member of World Rugby, with a seat on that body&#x27;s Executive Council, and a founding member of Sudamérica Rugby.

The UAR organises all the national teams, including Senior (&quot;Pumas&quot;), U-20 (&quot;Pumitas&quot;), Argentina XV, Sevens and Women&#x27;s squads and the franchise Jaguares that participates in SANZAAR&#x27;s Super Rugby competition.

== History ==

===Origins===
The first rugby match in Argentina was played in 1873, in the Buenos Aires Cricket Club Ground sited in Palermo, Buenos Aires. Only 24 players (all of them were English) could meet to contest the match. The teams were named &quot;Bancos&quot; (&quot;Banks&quot; in Spanish) and &quot;Ciudad&quot; (&quot;City&quot;) and formed with 11 and 13 players respectively.

That same year, another match was played on the Polo Field of Flores AC, part of land owned by the Unzué family. The teams were called &quot;Inglaterra&quot; (&quot;England&quot;) and &quot;El Mundo&quot; (&quot;The World&quot;). The first team was formed by Royal Navy officers that were temporarily in Buenos Aires, with the addition of some English citizens who resided in Argentina. Its rival was formed by English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish people plus some Argentine-born players of English descent.

On May 14, 1874, the Rugby Football Union rules were adopted to play rugby in Argentina. Those rules were used for the first time during the match contested at Buenos Aires Cricket Club between two teams from that institution. The teams were called &quot;El bando del Sr. Trench&quot; (&quot;Mr. Trench&#x27;s side&quot;), and &quot;El bando del Sr. Hogg&quot; (&quot;Mr. Hogg&#x27;s side&quot;).

Nevertheless, other sources say that the first game under the rules of rugby was played on Thursday, 14 May 1874, at David Mathven&#x27;s country house, in Caballito, Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires FC also played the first inter-provincial rugby game in Argentina, when it faced Rosario AC in the city of Rosario, on 28 June 1886.

===First championship organized===
In 1899, clubs Belgrano, Rosario, Lomas, Buenos Aires and Flores founded the &quot;River Plate Rugby Union&quot;, naming Leslie William Corry-Smith as president. The body organized the first championship that same year, played by the five founding members. In the inaugural game, Lomas defeated Buenos Aires by 11–4. Lomas would be the first Argentine champion, winning the title at the end of the season.

The sport requested affiliation with the International Olympic Committee (COI), who advised them to add Argentina to their name and so they became the &quot;Unión Argentina de Rugby&quot; on 29 November 1951.

This body, one of the oldest rugby unions in the world, became a member of the International Rugby Board (IRB) after being invited to the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987.

When the rest of the rugby union world went professional in 1995, the UAR decided to keep the game amateur. Also, the Buenos Aires clubs split off the UAR and formed the Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires (URBA), which has the same status as other provincial unions.

Argentine players who opt to go overseas to play professionally (historically in Italy and France, with an increasing number today playing in England) remain eligible for national team selection (although this was not originally the case). As a result, the national team was heavily, though not exclusively, made up of European-based players. In 2016, the UAR formed the Jaguares team to compete in the Super Rugby competition. Also, it established a policy of selecting Pumas players from Super Rugby teams only, thereby excluding players from European clubs.

===National team===
The first national team (under the name &quot;The River Plate Rugby Football Union&quot;) made its debut against the British Lions (named &quot;Combined British&quot;) when they toured Argentina in 1910 as part of the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the Revolución de Mayo. The match was played on 12 June and the Argentina side lost 28–3.

===The Rugby Championship===
Argentina officially joined The Rugby Championship following a meeting in Buenos Aires on November 23, 2011. They became a full member of SANZAAR, the body which operates Super Rugby and The Rugby Championship competitions in rugby union, from the start of 2016.

==Names==

<text>William Thomas Blanford (7 October 183223 June 1905) was an English geologist and naturalist. He is best remembered as the editor of a major series on &quot;The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma&quot;.
==Biography==
Blanford was born in London to William Blanford and Elizabeth Simpson. His father owned a factory next to their house on Bouverie street, Whitefriars. He was educated in private schools in Brighton (until 1846) and Paris (1848). He joined his family business in carving and gilding and studied at the School of Design in Somerset House. Suffering from ill health, he spent two years in a business house at Civitavecchia owned by a friend of his father. His initial aim was to enter a mercantile career. On returning to England in 1851 he was induced to enter the newly established Royal School of Mines (now part of Imperial College London), which his younger brother Henry F. Blanford (1834–1893), afterwards head of the Indian Meteorological Department, had already joined. He studied under Henry De la Beche, Lyon Playfair, Edward Forbes, Ramsay, and Warington Smyth. He then spent a year in the mining school (Bergakademie) at Freiberg, Saxony, and towards the close of 1854 both he and his brother obtained posts on the Geological Survey of India. In that service he remained for twenty-seven years, retiring in 1882. After his retirement he took up editorship of &quot;The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma&quot; series.He was engaged in various parts of India, in the Raniganj coalfield, in Bombay, and in the coalfield near Talcher, where boulders considered to have been ice-borne were found in the Talcher strata (Talchir tillite)—a remarkable discovery confirmed by subsequent observations of other geologists in equivalent strata (Permian) elsewhere across Gondwanaland. Blanford took an interest in the Permo-Triassic &quot;Glossopteris&quot; flora. He commented on the geological age of this region in his much later address to the British Association in 1884. Between 1857 and 1860 he was involved in a survey of the Rajniganj coalfields, followed by visits to Trichinopoly and the Nilgiri Hills. In 1860 he went to Burma to study an extinct volcano, Puppadoung and in 1862 he took an interest in the Deccan Traps. In 1867 he joined an expedition to Abyssinia, the results of which were published in &quot;Observation on the Geology and Zoology of Abyssinia&quot; (1870). accompanying the army to Magdala and back; and in 1871–1872 he was appointed a member of the Persian Boundary Commission along with O. B. St. John. After a voyage to Basra he started back from Gwadar, 200 miles west of Karachi. He marched to Shiraz with St. John&#x27;s party and then travelled alone through Ispahan to Teheran to join Sir Richard Pollock. He visited the Elbruz Mountains and returned to England from the Caspian via Astrakhan, Moscow, St. Petersburg and Berlin to reach home in September 1872. The best use was made of the exceptional opportunities of studying the natural history of those countries. He subsequently spent time to produce the report on Zoology. He represented the Indian Government at the meeting of the Geological Congress in Bologna. His attention was given not only to geology but to zoology, and especially to the land gastropods and to the vertebrates. He joined H J Elwes on a journey to Sikkim in 1870 during which several new bird species were described. Between 1870 and 1881 Blanford described 36 new species of reptiles and three new species of amphibians.

In 1883 he married Ida Gertrude Bellhouse, and settled at Bedford Gardens, Campden Hill.

For his many contributions to geological science, Blanford was in 1883 awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London. For his labours on the zoology and geology of British India he received in 1901 a royal medal from the Royal Society. He had been elected F.R.S. in 1874, and was chosen president of the Geological Society in 1888. He was created Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1904. He died at his home at the age of 72 in Bedford Gardens, Campden Hill, in London on 23 June 1905 and is buried in a family vault at Highgate Cemetery.

His principal publications were: &quot;Observations on the Geology and Zoology of Abyssinia&quot; (1870), &quot;Manual of the Geology of India&quot;, with H. B. Medlicott (1879) and the third volume in Birds following the work of E. W. Oates in &quot;The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma&quot; series.

<text>Tachisme (alternative spelling: Tachism, derived from the French word &quot;tache&quot;, stain; ) is a French style of abstract painting popular in the 1940s and 1950s. The term is said to have been first used with regards to the movement in 1951. It is often considered to be the European response and equivalent to abstract expressionism, although there are stylistic differences (American abstract expressionism tended to be more &quot;aggressively raw&quot; than tachisme). It was part of a larger postwar movement known as Art Informel (or &quot;Informel&quot;), which abandoned geometric abstraction in favour of a more intuitive form of expression, similar to action painting. Another name for Tachism is Abstraction lyrique (related to American Lyrical Abstraction). COBRA is also related to Tachisme, as is Japan&#x27;s Gutai group.

After World War II the term School of Paris often referred to Tachisme, the European equivalent of American abstract expressionism. Important proponents were Jean-Paul Riopelle, Wols, Jean Dubuffet, Pierre Soulages, Nicolas de Staël, Hans Hartung, Gérard Schneider, Serge Poliakoff, Georges Mathieu and Jean Messagier, among several others. (See list of artists below.)

According to Chilvers, the term &quot;tachisme&quot; &quot;was first used in this sense in about 1951 (the French critics Charles Estienne and Pierre Guéguen have each been credited with coining it) and it was given wide currency by [French critic and painter] Michel Tapié in his book &quot;Un Art autre&quot; (1952).&quot;

Tachisme was a reaction to Cubism and is characterized by spontaneous brushwork, drips and blobs of paint straight from the tube, and sometimes scribbling reminiscent of calligraphy.

Tachisme is closely related to Informalism or Art Informel, which, in its 1950s French art-critical context, referred not so much to a sense of &quot;informal art&quot; as &quot;a lack or absence of form itself&quot;–non-formal or un-form-ulated–and not a simple reduction of formality or formalness. Art Informel was more about the absence of premeditated structure, conception or approach (&quot;sans cérémonie&quot;) than a mere casual, loosened or relaxed art procedure.

<doc id="879244" wikidata="Q7232144" url="?curid=879244" title="Porto Bello (Williamsburg, Virginia)">
<text>Porto Bello was the hunting lodge of the last Royal Governor of the British Colony of Virginia, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore. The name commemorates the battle of Porto Bello, a 1739 British naval victory in Panama. Lord Dunmore fled to Porto Bello to escape the early stages of the American Revolution in Williamsburg, Virginia. He later boarded a British ship lying at anchor near Porto Bello in the York River.

Porto Bello is located in York County, Virginia on the grounds of Camp Peary. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, but is closed to visitors because of the restricted access to Camp Peary.

==Geography and Property History==

Porto Bello was a 2-story brick farmhouse owned by Lord Dunmore from 1773 to the late 1770s. It is located in central York County on a wooded hill north of Queen&#x27;s Creek.

In a 1782 map, the building is shown to have five buildings, consisting of a residence, a kitchen, and three other much smaller outbuildings; however, it was written to have up to ten outbuildings while under the ownership of Dunmore including a large barn, cow houses, stables, and work shops.

The complex, despite its size, was never truly used as a permanent residence, and it was instead used as a hunting lodge or retreat.

Although usually considered the actual house occupied by Lord Dunmore, the house exhibits properties that resemble features of houses built in the early 1800s. Instead, a geographic depression north of the structure may be the site of the earlier house. In 1915, the modern house had an internal fire that left everything decimated but the walls. As a result of the fire, the roof was replaced from a gambrel roof to a mansard roof and the interior plan was changed.

The original plan, remembered by a former occupant, was described as having two floors each with two rooms. In the center was a chimney. Between the chimney and the front wall was an entrance hall, and behind it were stairs to the second floor.

The date of construction of the house was never written, but it was known to have been constructed in or before 1774.

== Significance and Ownership History ==
The earliest known owner of the land that would become Porto Bello was John James Hullotte. In 1758, the York County court ordered that Hullotte give back gambling money that he had gained. Hullotte refused and his land was repossessed and given to Alexander Finnie, the man whom he owed money to. Finnie died 11 years later, in 1769. The land was then auctioned off to John Prentis in December. Prentis then, for reasons unknown, conveyed Porto Bello to William and Rachel Drummond in November 1770.

William Drummond died in 1773 and it was bought by Lord Dunmore some time later that year after a short controversy with Drummond&#x27;s wife who accused him of interfering with the sale of the property.

Lord Dunmore retained ownership of the house for the next two years despite only utilizing it as his retreat or hunting lodge.

In early 1775, Virginians began to organize militia companies and equip themselves. Lord Dunmore, who was a loyalist and sought to end the growing resistance, ordered Lieutenant Henry Collins to take the guns within the Williamsburg Magazine and place them on the British armed schooner Magdalen. The Virginian populous, angry with the distrust and loyalty of Dunmore, grew to rebellion and Patrick Henry placed a militia outside of Williamsburg on May 2. Dunmore then fled to Porto Bello and then to the HMS Fowey.

Two months later, on July 7, Dunmore returned to Porto Bello, but was quickly chased out by a group of irate citizens from Williamsburg whom he narrowly avoided. he never returned to Porto Bello.

After Lord Dunmore fled, the Virginian authorities rented the land to a Dr. James Carter until 1779 when the county escheator sold it to a man named Francis Bright. The Bright family owned the property for about half to three quarters of a century. After Francis Bright died sometime in the early 1800s, his son, Samuel Bright, gained the property until he died in the mid-1800s.

The property was owned by multiple people for the rest of the nineteenth century, and was owned by the Mahone family in 1915 when a fire gutted the property. Later, the property was sold to the United States Federal Government in the beginning of World War 2 for the construction of Camp Peary.

<text>The Villa of the Papyri (, also known as &quot;Villa dei Pisoni&quot; and in early excavation records as the &quot;Villa Suburbana&quot;) was an ancient Roman villa in Herculaneum, in what is now Ercolano, southern Italy. It is named after its unique library of papyri scrolls, discovered in 1750. The Villa was considered to be one of the most luxurious houses in all of Herculaneum and in the Roman world. Its luxury is shown by its exquisite architecture and by the large number of outstanding works of art discovered, including frescoes, bronzes and marble sculpture which constitute the largest collection of Greek and Roman sculptures ever discovered in a single context.

It was situated on the ancient coastline below the volcano Vesuvius with nothing to obstruct the view of the sea. It was perhaps owned by Julius Caesar&#x27;s father-in-law, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus. In 1908, Barker suggested that Philodemus may have been the owner.

In AD 79, the eruption of Vesuvius covered all of Herculaneum with up to of volcanic material from pyroclastic flows. Herculaneum was first excavated between 1750 and 1765 by Karl Weber by means of tunnels. The villa&#x27;s name derives from the discovery of its library, the only surviving library from the Graeco-Roman world that exists in its entirety. It contained over 1,800 papyrus scrolls, now carbonised by the heat of the eruption, the &quot;Herculaneum papyri&quot;.

Most of the villa is still underground. Parts have been cleared of volcanic deposits. Many of the finds are displayed in the Naples National Archaeological Museum. The Getty Villa museum in Malibu, California, is a reproduction of the Villa of the Papyri.

==Layout==

The villa is located a few hundred metres from the nearest house in Herculaneum. Although it now lies inland, before the volcanic eruption of October 79 AD, the structure occupied more than of coastline along the Gulf of Naples. On the other sides it was surrounded by a closed garden, vineyards and woods. The villa had four levels beneath the main floor, arranged in terraces, overlooking the sea. It has recently been ascertained that the main floor was above sea level in antiquity.
The villa&#x27;s layout is an expanded version of the traditional Campanian &quot;villa suburbana&quot;. One entered through the &quot;fauces&quot; and proceeded to the atrium, which functioned as an entrance hall and a means of communication with the various parts of the house. The entrance opened with a columned portico on the sea side.

After passing through the &quot;tablinum&quot;, one arrived at the first peristyle, made up of ten columns on each side, with a swimming pool in the centre. In this area, were found the bronze herm adapted from the Doryphorus of Polykleitos and the herm of an Amazon made by Apollonios, son of Archias of Athens. The large second peristyle could be reached by passing through a large &quot;tablinum&quot; in which, under a &quot;propylaeum&quot;, was the archaic statue of Athena Promachos. A collection of bronze busts were in the interior of the &quot;tablinum&quot;. These included the head of Scipio Africanus.

The living and reception quarters were grouped around the porticoes and terraces, giving occupants ample sunlight and a view of the countryside and sea. In the living quarters, bath installations were brought to light, and the library of rolled and carbonised papyri placed inside wooden , some of them on ordinary wooden shelves and around the walls and some on the two sides of a set of shelves in the middle of the room.

The grounds included a large area of covered and uncovered gardens for walks in the shade or in the warmth of the sun. The gardens included a gallery of busts, and small marble and bronze statues. These were laid out between columns amid the open part of the garden and on the edges of the large swimming bath.

==Works of art==

The luxury of the villa is evidenced not only by the many works of art, but especially by the large number of rare bronze statues found there, all masterpieces. The villa housed a collection of at least 80 sculptures of magnificent quality, many now conserved in the Naples National Archaeological Museum. Among them is the bronze &quot;Seated Hermes&quot;, found at the villa in 1758. Around the bowl of the atrium &quot;impluvium&quot; were 11 bronze fountain statues depicting Satyrs pouring water from a pitcher and Amorini pouring water from the mouth of a dolphin. Other statues and busts were found in the corners around the atrium walls.
Five statues of life-sized bronze dancing women wearing the Doric &quot;peplos&quot; sculpted in different positions and with inlaid eyes are adapted Roman copies of originals from the fifth century BC. They are also hydrophorai drawing water from a fountain.

==Epicureanism and the library==
The owner of the house, perhaps Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, established a library of a mainly philosophical character. It is believed that the library might have been collected and selected by Piso&#x27;s family friend and client, the Epicurean Philodemus of Gadara, although this conclusion is not certain. Followers of Epicurus studied the teachings of this moral and natural philosopher. This philosophy taught that man is mortal, that the cosmos is the result of accident, that there is no providential god, and that the criteria of a good life are pleasure and temperance.

Philodemus&#x27; connections with Piso brought him an opportunity to influence the young students of Greek literature and philosophy who gathered around him at Herculaneum and Naples. Much of his work was discovered in about a thousand papyrus scrolls in the philosophical library recovered at Herculaneum. Although his prose work is detailed in the strung-out, non-periodic style typical of Hellenistic Greek prose before the revival of the Attic style after Cicero, Philodemus surpassed the average literary standard to which most epicureans aspired. Philodemus succeeded in influencing the most learned and distinguished Romans of his age. None of his prose work was known until the rolls of papyri were discovered among the ruins of the Villa of the Papyri.
At the time of the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79, the valuable library was packed in cases ready to be moved to safety when it was overtaken by a pyroclastic flow; the eruption eventually deposited some 20–25 m of volcanic ash over the site, charring the scrolls but preserving them – the only surviving library of Antiquity – as the ash hardened to form tuff.

==Excavations==

The House of Bourbon under King Charles VII of Naples issued excavations following the re-discovery of Herculaneum in 1738. Excavation work at Herculaneum was done through digging tunnels, and piercing walls, in an attempt to find treasures like paintings, statues and other ornaments to be exhibited in the Museum Herculanense, part of the King&#x27;s Royal Palace in Portici.

The Villa of the Papyri was discovered in 1750 by farmers when digging a well. The following excavation work was conducted first by Roque Joaquín de Alcubierre and later by the Swiss engineer Karl Jakob Weber, who worked under Alcubierre for Charles VII of Naples. Initially the first papyri scrolls which were obtained in 1752 were thrown away due to the high number, then Bernardo Tanucci advised the King to study them. The King subsequently established a commission for the study of the papyri.

Camillo Paderni who took part at the excavations and was possibly the first to transcribe papyri, noted in a letter dated 1754, &quot;...in five places, where we might have expected to meet with busts or statues, the antients had been digging before us, and taken them away. The method, whereby they regulated their searches, seems to have been this: where the ground was pretty easy to work, they dug through it and where they met with the solid lava they desisted. But whether they were in want of money, or of hands, they certainly did not perfect their intention; as is plain from the statues, which we have found.&quot;

Excavations were halted in 1765 due to complaints from the residents living above. The exact location of the villa was then lost for two centuries. In the 1980s, work on re-discovering the villa began by studying 18th century documentation on entrances to the tunnels and in 1986 the breakthrough was made through an ancient well. The backfill from some of the tunnels was cleared to allow re-exploration of the villa when it was found that the parts of the villa that survived the earlier excavations were still remarkable in quantity and quality.

Excavation to expose part of the villa was done in the 1990s and revealed two previously undiscovered lower floors to the villa with frescoes in situ. These were found along the southwest-facing terrace of about 4 metres height. The first row of rooms lying below the arcade was evidenced by a series of rectangular openings along the façade.
Limited excavations recommenced at the site in 2007 to preserve the remains when carved parts of wood and ivory furniture were discovered. Since then limited public access became available.

, there were still 2,800 m left to be excavated of the villa. The remainder of the site has not been excavated because the Italian government is preferring conservation to excavation, and protecting what has already been uncovered. David Woodley Packard, who has funded conservation work at Herculaneum through his Packard Humanities Institute, has said that he is likely to be able to fund excavation of the Villa of the Papyri when the authorities agree to it; but no work will be permitted on the site until the completion of a feasibility report, which has been in preparation for some years. The first part of the report emerged in 2008 but included no timetable or cost projections, since the decision for further excavation is a political one. Politics involve excavation under inhabited areas in addition to unspecified but reported references to mafia involvement.

Using multi-spectral imaging, a technique developed in the early 1990s, it is possible to read the burned papyri. With multi-spectral imaging, many pictures of the illegible papyri are taken using different filters in the infrared or the ultraviolet range, finely tuned to capture certain wavelengths of light. Thus, the optimum spectral portion can be found for distinguishing ink from paper on the blackened papyrus surface.

Non-destructive CT scans will, it is hoped, provide breakthroughs in reading the fragile unopened scrolls without destroying them in the process. Encouraging results along this line of research have been obtained, which use phase-contrast X-ray imaging.

According to authors, &quot;this pioneering research opens up new prospects not only for the many papyri still unopened, but also for others that have not yet been discovered, perhaps including a second library of Latin papyri at a lower, as yet unexcavated level of the Villa.&quot;

==J. Paul Getty Museum==
In 1970, oil billionaire J. Paul Getty engaged the architectural firm of Langdon and Wilson to create a replica of the &quot;Villa dei Papiri&quot; to serve as a museum where his collection of antiquities would be displayed.

Based on Weber&#x27;s plans published in &quot;Le Antichità di Ercolano&quot;, the museum was built on Getty&#x27;s Malibu ranch in 1972–1974. Architectural consultant Norman Neuerburg and the curator of Getty&#x27;s antiquities, Jiří Frel, worked closely with Getty and the architects to ensure the accuracy of the museum building&#x27;s design.

Since the &quot;Villa dei Papiri&quot; was unexcavated, Neuerburg based many of the villa&#x27;s architectural and landscaping details on elements from other ancient Roman houses in the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae. For example, the mosaic fountain in the museum&#x27;s garden peristyle replicates the one in the &quot;Nymphaeum&quot; of the House of the Large Fountain at Pompeii.

In 1997, the Getty Museum was relocated to the Getty Center. The Malibu villa was renovated and reopened in 2006. The reconceived Getty Villa, as it is now called, serves as an annex dedicated to the display of the museum&#x27;s antiquities and as a centre for the study of ancient art.

==In modern literature==

The opening pages of the 1850 fictional work A Few Days in Athens claim to be &quot;the translation of a Greek Manuscript discovered in Herculaneum&quot;. The novel was written by Frances Wright, a female philosopher who was mentored by the Epicurean American founding father, Thomas Jefferson, and it unapologetically defends Epicurus&#x27; character, Epicurean philosophy, and secular values.

Several scenes in Robert Harris&#x27; bestselling novel &quot;Pompeii&quot; are set in the Villa of the Papyri, just before the eruption engulfed it. The villa is mentioned as belonging to Roman aristocrat Pedius Cascus and his wife Rectina. Pliny the Younger mentions Rectina, whom he calls the wife of Tascius, in Letter 16 of book VI of his &quot;Letters&quot;. 

At the start of the eruption, Rectina prepares to have the library evacuated and sends urgent word to her old friend, Pliny the Elder, who commands the Roman Navy at Misenum on the other side of the Bay of Naples. Pliny immediately sets out in a warship, and gets in sight of the villa, but the eruption prevents him from landing and taking off Rectina and her library – which is left for modern archaeologists to find.

<text>Mokotów Field () is a large urban park in Warsaw, Poland. Located between Warsaw&#x27;s Mokotów district and the city center, the park is one of the largest in Warsaw. Only a small part of the modern &quot;Pole Mokotowskie&quot; is located in the Mokotów district. Most of the field (48.61 ha, almost 71%) is located in Ochota and Śródmieście. Landmarks within the park include the Polish National Library and the Monument in Memory of the Fallen Polish Pilots in World War II. The park is also famous for its bars. To the south is a Warsaw Metro station, the &quot;Pole Mokotowskie&quot; station.

==History==

From 1818 until World War II, on what was originally a 200 ha area, a major part was occupied by an airfield and the Warsaw Polytechnic aircraft works. The &quot;Pole Mokotowskie&quot; was also, until 1934, the site of Warsaw Airport and, in the years 1884-1939, of the Warsaw Horse Racing Track. On May 17, 1935, the funeral of Józef Piłsudski took place on the &quot;Pole Mokotowskie&quot;.

The current park was designed by Stanisław Bolek and created in the 1970s and 1980s. In 2010, a two-kilometer educational trail was opened named after Ryszard Kapuściński. In 2018, near the intersection of al. Niepodległości and ul. Wawelska Street, 45 apple trees were planted to commemorate prominent Polish women.

Greater modernization was initiated in 2021-2024. Concreted surfaces were reduced, a new water system with reed vegetation was created, and wooden platforms and bridges and wooden seats were added. New trees and flowerbeds were also planted.

==Fauna==

Twenty-one families of beetles are found in the park. Most of them are species from the ladybug family, of which the Asian ladybug is the most numerous, accounting for almost two-thirds of the individuals found. The next species, &quot;Aphidecta obliterata&quot;, accounted for 9.3%.

Due to the periodic lack of water in the ponds, there are no stable fish populations in the Mokotów Field, although some freshwater fish can be observed, such as individuals of the genus &quot;Xiphophorus&quot;.

<text>Mokotów () is a district of Warsaw, the capital city of Poland. It is densely populated, and hosts many companies and foreign embassies. Only a small part of the district is lightly industrialised (&quot;Służewiec Przemysłowy&quot;), while the majority is full of parks and green areas (Mokotów Field).

Although the area has been populated at least since the early Middle Ages, Mokotów was not incorporated into Warsaw until 1916. The origins of the area&#x27;s name are unclear, first appearing as the village of Mokotowo in documents from the year 1367. It is hypothesised to have come from the name of a German owner of the village, who called himself Mokoto or Mokot, although no exact reference to such an individual has been found in historical records. In the 18th century, Moktów developed as a place where mansions, villas and palaces of the magnates and wealthy bourgeoisie were built. However, most of the area was urbanised and redeveloped throughout the 1930s in the style of modernism. The majority of buildings survived World War II, making it one of the few well-preserved pre-war areas of Warsaw. Mokotów Prison is located within the borough. Residential real estate in Mokotów, particularly in the neighbourhoods of Stary Mokotów and Wyględów, ranks among the most expensive in Warsaw.

<text>New Zealand Rugby (NZR) is the governing body of rugby union in New Zealand. It was founded in 1892 as the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU), 12 years after the first provincial unions in New Zealand. In 1949 it became an affiliate to the International Rugby Football Board, now known as World Rugby, the governing body of rugby union for the world. It dropped the word &quot;Football&quot; from its name in 2006. The brand name &quot;New Zealand Rugby&quot; was adopted in 2013. Officially, it is an incorporated society with the name New Zealand Rugby Union Incorporated.

The organisation&#x27;s main objectives, as displayed in the NZR Constitution, are to promote and develop rugby throughout New Zealand; arrange and participate in matches and tours in New Zealand and overseas; represent New Zealand in World Rugby; form and manage New Zealand representative teams; and encourage participation in the sport. NZR Headquarters are located in Wellington, New Zealand, with an office in Auckland.

==Structure==
New Zealand Rugby has a staff of approximately 90 people, mostly based in Wellington and Auckland but also working in locations all around New Zealand.

NZR was initially governed by a committee of delegates from the provincial unions until replaced in 1894 by a seven-member Wellington-based management committee. Administrative responsibilities were initially held by honorary secretaries, and then secretaries, from 1907. This was expanded 43 years later to create two entities, the ruling NZRU Council and an executive committee. In 1986, three geographical zones were formed to elect the members of the ruling council, and the executive committee was replaced by an administration committee. Since 1990, the NZRU has been managed by a CEO.

In 1996, the NZRU&#x27;s ruling council was replaced by an expanded board to include independent members and an elected Maori representative. In 2015, the geographical zones were abolished so that vacant elective seats on the board could be contested by nominees from any provincial union in New Zealand without restriction on place of residence.
===Patron and officers===
New Zealand Rugby&#x27;s Patron fills an honorary role as the figurehead for the organisation. The position of Patron is currently vacant following the death of Sir Brian Lochore in August 2019.

The President and Vice President are the Union&#x27;s two officers who represent New Zealand Rugby at functions and events. Unlike the Patron, the President and Vice President may attend board meetings of New Zealand Rugby, although they are not entitled to vote on board matters. The President and Vice President are elected for two years each. The current President is Bill Osborne and the current Vice President is Max Spence.

===Board===
The Board is charged with setting strategy, direction and policy for the New Zealand Rugby Union, and is ultimately responsible for the decisions and actions of NZRU management and staff. Many of the decisions concerning New Zealand&#x27;s national teams, domestic competitions, financial management and rugby traditions are made by the Board.

As of September 2018, the Board has nine members: six elected members (including one Maori representative) and three independent members. Any provincial union in New Zealand may nominate candidates for vacant elective positions. Nominations are passed to an Appointments and Remuneration Committee (ARC) which recommends two candidates per vacancy, to be voted on by delegates at the Annual General Meeting. The Maori representative is automatically appointed as New Zealand Rugby&#x27;s representative on and Chairman of the New Zealand Maori Rugby Board.

The independent board members must be independent of any provincial union and are not nominated for the role. Instead, independent members must apply for the position and are selected on the basis of their professional qualifications and experience by a committee from the Board of New Zealand Rugby.

===Executive management team and staff===
New Zealand Rugby&#x27;s management and staff reports to an executive team headed by the Chief Executive Officer. This team includes various managers for all aspects of New Zealand Rugby ranging from community and provincial rugby to the All Blacks teams. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), working with the Board, is responsible for the establishment of the vision and strategy for the organisation, and acts as the key link between the Board and the staff. The CEO is ultimately responsible for the administrative and operational aspects of New Zealand Rugby. The current CEO is Mark Robinson, who took up the post in January 2020, succeeding Steve Tew.

==History==
The New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) was formed in 1892 to administer the game of rugby union at the national level. At that time, the national union was known as the New Zealand Rugby Football Union or NZRFU. The name was officially shortened in 2006 with the removal of the word &quot;Football&quot;. The brand name New Zealand Rugby was adopted in 2013 for &quot;everyday&quot; use because it was seen as less &quot;stuffy&quot; and the word &quot;Union&quot; had some negative connotations.

The first rugby match to be played in New Zealand took place in Nelson in May 1870, between Nelson College and Nelson Football Club. The game spread quickly and in September 1875 the first interprovincial match took place in Dunedin, between Auckland Clubs and Dunedin Clubs. In 1879, the first provincial unions were formed in Canterbury and Wellington.

===Formation and early years===

On Saturday 16 April 1892, in a meeting held in Wellington, the New Zealand Rugby Union was formed. Inaugural members were the provincial unions of Auckland, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Manawatu, Marlborough, Nelson, South Canterbury, Taranaki, Waiararapa, Wanganui and Wellington. At the time, three major South Island provincial unions – Canterbury, Otago and Southland – resisted the central authority of the NZRU.

In 1893, the NZRU formally adopted the black jersey as the national playing strip and selected the first NZRU-sanctioned national team, for a tour of Australia. However, the earlier New Zealand team selected to tour New South Wales in 1884 is recognised as a New Zealand team and its players recognised as All Blacks.

By 1895, with the additions of the Bush, Canterbury, Horowhenua, Otago, Poverty Bay, Southland and West Coast unions, the NZRU was considered to be a complete and united collection of all New Zealand rugby players. However, the New Zealand rugby map would be repeatedly redrawn in the following decades.

At the Annual Meeting in 1921, the NZRU elected its first Life Member, George Dixon, manager of the 1905 “Originals” All Blacks and the NZRU&#x27;s first Chairman, appointed in 1904. In another innovation, provincial delegates met prior to the Annual Meeting to arrange representative fixtures for the season ahead, introducing a new level of national coordination.

===Provincial rugby===
In 1976, the National Provincial Championship was formed to help organise matches between provincial unions, it had two divisions in its first year of play but the format was repeatedly reorganized throughout its 30-year history, notably in 1992 the bonus points system was brought in to determine the top placed team. Auckland have been the most successful team in the NPC&#x27;s history with 16 championships including the last in 2005.

At the conclusion of the NPC there were three divisions and 27 unions under the NZRU&#x27;s jurisdiction, it was replaced by the Air New Zealand Cup and Heartland Championship in 2006 with 14 teams in the top competition, including the new Tasman Makos, who formed with the amalgamation of the Marlborough and Nelson Bays Rugby Unions, and 12 teams in the amateur Heartland Championship. After changes in sponsorship in 2010, 2016 and 2021, the Air New Zealand Cup became the ITM Cup, Mitre 10 Cup and is now the Bunnings NPC.

===All Blacks===
The All Blacks are New Zealand&#x27;s number one national rugby side and have rated among the best in the world for well over 100 years. Their name and distinctive all black playing strip have become well known to rugby and non-rugby fans worldwide.

The first New Zealand team was selected in 1884, for a tour to New South Wales. The team played its first match at home, against a Wellington XV, before recording eight wins in eight matches in Australia. Otago prop James Allan, who played eight matches for the 1884 team, has the title of All Black No 1.

In 1893, the first official NZRU-sanctioned New Zealand team was selected, for an 11-match tour to Australia. The team lost just once, to New South Wales in Sydney.

In 1894, an official New Zealand team hosted visiting opposition on home soil for the first time, in a match against New South Wales at Christchurch won 8–6 by the visitors, two years later, New Zealand beat Queensland at Wellington to record its first home win against visiting opposition.

New Zealand&#x27;s 1905–06 tour to the United Kingdom, France and North America might be considered the most important in New Zealand rugby history. The team played 35 matches in total, the only team to beat them was Wales. In the United Kingdom especially, the team&#x27;s largely confident, attractive and comfortable wins made a strong statement about the quality of rugby in the colonies and New Zealand in particular. Moreover, the 1905–06 tour gave rise to the famous “All Blacks” moniker, as the fame surrounding the black-clad team spread. Nowadays, this team is known as “the Originals” – they were the first team to demonstrate the power and skill of New Zealand rugby, the first to make rugby a part of New Zealand&#x27;s cultural identity, and the first to be known as All Blacks.

In 1924–25, the All Blacks embarked on a 32-match tour to the United Kingdom, France and Canada. Going one better than the 1905–06 Originals, this team won all 32 matches, including Test wins over Ireland, Wales, England and France, and earned the nickname “the Invincibles”.

In 1956, the All Blacks won a Test series against South Africa for the first time. The Springboks were the All Blacks’ greatest traditional rivals and had delivered some of the All Blacks’ worst defeats.

In 1978, the All Blacks achieved a Grand Slam for the first time. For southern hemisphere sides like New Zealand, a Grand Slam includes victories over the four Home Unions – England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales – in the course of a single tour. The team achieved a second Grand Slam in 2005 and a third in 2008

In 1987, the All Blacks won the inaugural Rugby World Cup against France, hosted by New Zealand and Australia. New Zealand also won the Rugby World Cup in 2011, after an 8–7 victory over France in front of a home crowd, and in 34–17 victory over Australia at Twickenham in 2015. The latter win made the All Blacks the first side ever to successfully defend a Rugby World Cup title and to win three World Cups.

===Professional era===
In 1995, following the Rugby World Cup tournament in South Africa, international rugby turned professional with the IRB&#x27;s repeal of all amateurism regulations. For the first time, the NZRU negotiated with and contracted New Zealand rugby players.

The NZRU also joined with the national unions of Australia and South Africa to form SANZAR, which sold the television rights for major southern hemisphere rugby competitions and helped to build the commercial foundation on which professional rugby is based. SANZAR, renamed SANZAAR with the 2016 entry of Argentina as a full member of the body, remains an important rugby organisation and organises The Rugby Championship (originally the Tri Nations) and the Super Rugby competition.

==National teams==
The NZRU has several teams under its control.

===Men===
*All Blacks – the national men&#x27;s rugby union team of New Zealand
*All Blacks XV – the second national team behind the All Blacks and not an age graded side.
*Sevens – the national rugby sevens team of New Zealand. Established in 1983, when the first full international side was sent to the Hong Kong Sevens tournament.
*Māori All Blacks – the national men&#x27;s Māori team of New Zealand. Members of this team must have at least 1/16 Māori ancestry (equivalent to one great-great-grandparent).
*Under 20s – an age graded side created after World Rugby (then known as the IRB) folded its former under-19 and under-21 World Championships into an under-20 competition currently known as the World Rugby Under 20 Championship. Currently the country&#x27;s top age-grade side, and also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Baby Blacks.&quot;
*Heartland XV – established in 1988 to expose players from Divisions Two and Three in the Air New Zealand NPC to rugby at a higher level. After the 2006 reorganisation of the NPC into the fully professional Air New Zealand Cup, now Mitre 10 Cup, and the nominally amateur Heartland Championship, the team now consists solely of players from the Heartland Championship.
*NZ Schools – a development team of school players who move up to the Under 20s and ultimately the All Blacks.

===Women===
*Black Ferns – the national women&#x27;s rugby union team of New Zealand.
*Sevens – the national women&#x27;s rugby sevens team of New Zealand.

===Referees===
The New Zealand Rugby Union have a number of contracted referees who officiated in levels from Heartland matches to ITM Cup and Super Rugby. The system in which referees are selected, appointed to matches and progress through to the next stage is very structured with a number of referee coaches, viewers and managers assisting them with their performances. However, only 5 referees are on professional contracts, Glen Jackson, Brendon Pickerill, Ben O&#x27;Keeffe, Paul Williams, Nick Briant and Mike Fraser. The professionals are appointed to refereeing Super Rugby matches by SANZAAR with some refereeing test rugby.

==Provincial unions==
The NZRU comprises 17 North Island provincial unions and 9 South Island provincial unions.

===North Island===
The North Island provincial unions are:
===South Island===
The South Island provincial unions are:

<text>James Edward Gentile (born June 3, 1934), also nicknamed &quot;Diamond Jim&quot;, is an American former professional baseball first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers, Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Athletics, Houston Astros, and Cleveland Indians between 1957 and 1966.

== Early career ==

Born in San Francisco, California, Gentile was a powerful, left-handed slugger listed at 6&#x27; 3&quot;, 210 lb. He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as a high school pitcher in 1952. He played his first minor league season as a pitcher, earning a 2-6 win–loss record. The next year he was converted into a first baseman. He languished for eight years in the minors for a Dodgers team that already had All-Star Gil Hodges at first base and Norm Larker. He dominated the minors, leading two separate leagues in home runs.

On September 24, 1957, Gentile started at first base for the Dodgers at Brooklyn&#x27;s famed Ebbets Field in the final game played there, then was replaced by Pee Wee Reese in the top of the fifth inning with Reese going to third base and Gil Hodges moving from third to first. The game&#x27;s final batter, Pittsburgh&#x27;s Dee Fondy, hit a ground ball to Don Zimmer at shortstop and Zimmer threw to Hodges at first base for the game&#x27;s final out.

== Baltimore ==

Gentile was traded to Baltimore in 1960, where he was named to the 1960 All-Star Game his first full season. He enjoyed his best season in 1961, hitting career highs of .302 batting average, 46 home runs, 141 runs batted in (see below), 96 runs, 147 hits, 25 doubles, 96 walks, .423 on-base percentage, .646 slugging average and 1.069 OPS. He finished third in the MVP ballot (behind Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris). In addition, Gentile hit five grand slams — (including two straight in one game) — setting an American League record that stood until Don Mattingly belted six in 1987.

In a nine-season career, Gentile batted .260 (759-for-2922) with 179 home runs, 549 RBI, 434 runs, 113 doubles, six triples, and three stolen bases in 936 games. Following his major league career, he played one season in Japan for the Kintetsu Buffaloes in .

Gentile managed the Fort Worth Cats when they returned to baseball in and . Jim also managed the 2005 Mid-Missouri Mavericks of the Frontier League.

Gentile was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame in 1989.

==1961 RBI record keeping error==

Gentile&#x27;s 141 RBI in 1961 was second only to Roger Maris&#x27; 142 RBI, however, analysis by Retrosheet determined Maris was incorrectly credited with an RBI in a game on July 5, 1961. Maris reached base on an error by numerous accounts. Therefore, Gentile and Maris both had 141 RBI in 1961. Gentile&#x27;s contract with the Orioles in 1961 called for a $5,000 bonus if he led the league in RBI. The Orioles made good on that deal 50 years later and presented Gentile with a check for $5,000 at a game in 2010.

Gentile now lives in Edmond, Oklahoma.

<doc id="879256" wikidata="Q508242" url="?curid=879256" title="Ralph McQuarrie">
<text>Ralph Angus McQuarrie (; June 13, 1929 – March 3, 2012) was an American conceptual designer who worked in film and television. His career included work on the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; television series, the film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, and the film &quot;Cocoon&quot;, for which he won an Academy Award.

==Early life==
Ralph McQuarrie was born on June 13, 1929, in Gary, Indiana, and was raised on a farm near Billings, Montana. He served in the United States Army during the Korean War, surviving a shot to the head. After returning from the war, McQuarrie moved to California in the 1960s, studying at the Art Center School, then in downtown Los Angeles.

==Career==
McQuarrie initially worked for a dentistry firm, illustrating teeth and equipment, before working as an Artist and Preliminary Design Illustrator for the Boeing Company, where he drew diagrams for a manual on constructing the 747 Jumbo Jet, as well as designing film posters and animating CBS News&#x27; coverage of the Apollo space program at the three-man company Reel Three. 
While there, McQuarrie was asked by Hal Barwood to produce some illustrations for a film project he and Matthew Robbins were starting.

===&quot;Star Wars&quot;===
The young filmmaker George Lucas was impressed by McQuarrie&#x27;s work and met with him to discuss his plans for a space-fantasy film, &quot;The Star Wars&quot;. Lucas sought visual reference material to support his pitch to film studios and purchased pieces of science fiction artwork by John Berkey. In 1975, Lucas commissioned McQuarrie to illustrate several scenes from the script of the film. McQuarrie may have been inspired by some of Berkey&#x27;s works, in particular a painting of a rocket-plane diving down through space towards a gigantic mechanical planet (the image had been used as cover art for the 1972 reprint of the short story anthology &quot;Star Science Fiction Stories No.4&quot;).

McQuarrie&#x27;s concept paintings were instrumental in helping Lucas to win approval from 20th Century Fox; armed with vivid illustrations of his planned movie, Lucas was able to convince Fox executives to take a gamble and fund his &quot;Star Wars&quot; project. Despite their scepticism, it became a huge success upon release in 1977. Among McQuarrie&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; portfolio were concept paintings depicting scenes on the planet Tatooine, inside the Mos Eisley cantina, inside the Death Star and on the moon of Yavin. During filming, Lucas ensured that many shots reproduced McQuarrie&#x27;s paintings exactly, such was his esteem for McQuarrie&#x27;s work. McQuarrie has said of his work on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;I thought I had the best job that an artist ever had on a film, and I had never worked on a feature film before. ... I still get fan mail — people wondering if I worked on &quot;Episode I&quot; or just wanting to have my autograph.&quot;

McQuarrie designed many of the film&#x27;s characters, including Darth Vader, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO and drew many concepts for the film&#x27;s sets. His production painting of R2-D2 and C-3PO wandering in the desert on the planet Tatooine was the first to be completed. His early concept for C-3PO was visibly inspired by the Art Deco &quot;Maschinenmensch&quot; robot from Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1927 film &quot;Metropolis&quot;. The painting had a particular impact on actor Anthony Daniels, who was about to turn down the part of C-3PO; &quot;He had painted a face and a figure that had a very wistful, rather yearning, rather bereft quality, which I found very appealing,&quot; stated Daniels, and the appeal of McQuarrie&#x27;s image convinced him to accept the role.

At Lucas&#x27; suggestion, McQuarrie designed a breathing apparatus for Darth Vader to wear. In an interview with &quot;Star Wars Insider&quot; Magazine, McQuarrie stated that Lucas&#x27; artistic direction was to portray a malevolent figure in a cape with samurai armour. &quot;For Darth Vader, George [Lucas] just said he would like to have a very tall, dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind.&quot; McQuarrie noted that the script indicated that Vader would travel between spaceships and needed to survive in the vacuum of space, and he proposed that Vader should wear some sort of space suit. Lucas agreed, and McQuarrie combined a full-face breathing mask with a samurai helmet, thus creating one of the most iconic designs of space fantasy cinema. A 1975 production painting of Darth Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller (a character prototype for Luke Skywalker) depicts Vader wearing black armour, a flowing cape and an elongated, skull-like mask and helmet. Its similarity to the final design of Vader&#x27;s costume demonstrates that McQuarrie&#x27;s earliest conception of Vader was so successful that very little needed to be changed for production. Working from McQuarrie&#x27;s artwork, the costume designer John Mollo devised a costume that could be worn by an actor on-screen using a combination of clerical robes, a motorcycle suit, a German military helmet and a gas mask. The prop sculptor Brian Muir created the helmet and armour used in the film from McQuarrie&#x27;s designs.

While McQuarrie was working on visualisation work for Lucas, he was also commissioned by an executive of Ballantine Books, Judy-Lynn del Rey, to produce the cover art of the forthcoming novelization of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The first edition of &quot;Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker&quot; went to press in 1976 featuring McQuarrie&#x27;s version of Darth Vader&#x27;s helmet on the cover. Like the film, the book was a runaway success, and McQuarrie began a long relationship with the publisher, producing the artwork for 22 further titles for Del Rey Books between 1978 and 1987.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
Around the time that McQuarrie was completing his work on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, he was brought on board the design team for a planned cinematic production based on Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s science fiction television series, &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Titled &quot;Star Trek: Planet of the Titans&quot;, the film was to feature a redesigned USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; starship, and McQuarrie was recruited to provide the visualizations. His triangular ship design has been likened to the appearance of the Star Destroyers featured in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. &quot;Star Trek: Planet of the Titans&quot; did not make it past the pre-production phase and the project was cancelled in 1977. The design was later used in 2017&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; as the basis of the titular ship.

===&quot;Star Wars&quot; sequels===

When Lucas began work on his sequel to &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), McQuarrie was once again brought in to supply previsualization artwork. His sketches and production paintings established the appearance of some of the saga&#x27;s most enduring elements, such as the gigantic AT-AT Walkers in the battle on the ice planet Hoth and the wizened elf creature Yoda. McQuarrie&#x27;s design for Cloud City, a floating city in the clouds, actually originated from his early sketches for &quot;Star Wars&quot; from 1975, when he was illustrating a concept for the planet Alderaan, as described in Lucas&#x27; 1975 draft script, &quot;Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars&quot;. McQuarrie made an uncredited cameo appearance in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, when he appeared in the film&#x27;s opening sequence in the Rebel base on Hoth as a character named General Pharl McQuarrie. In 2007, McQuarrie became part of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figure range when an action figure in his likeness as &quot;General McQuarrie&quot; was produced for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; 30th anniversary in 2007. Action figures were also produced based on McQuarrie&#x27;s concept art, including conceptual versions of the Imperial Stormtrooper, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Boba Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and other characters.

By the time McQuarrie was engaged on Lucas&#x27; third &quot;Star Wars&quot; picture, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), he had begun to experience creative fatigue. &quot;It became less fun as time went on. I had done the best part already and I was just rehashing everything. I kept meeting myself in my thinking. It became more and more difficult to keep my enthusiasm up,&quot; McQuarrie has said. Despite his earlier success, fewer of his design ideas were included in the final cut of the film.

===Other film and TV work===
McQuarrie designed the alien ships in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s films &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977) and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), while his work as the conceptual artist on the 1985 film &quot;Cocoon&quot; earned him the Academy Award for Visual Effects. He also worked on the 1978 TV series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, and the films &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; and &quot;*batteries not included&quot;.

==Retirement==
Rick McCallum offered McQuarrie a role as designer for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy, but he declined, noting he had &quot;run out of steam&quot; and Industrial Light &amp; Magic animator Doug Chiang was appointed instead. McQuarrie retired and his &quot;Star Wars&quot; concept paintings were subsequently displayed in art exhibitions, including the 1999 &quot;Star Wars: The Magic of Myth&quot;. Several of McQuarrie&#x27;s unused designs from the original trilogy were utilized for the &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; animated TV series, including the planet Orto Plutonia, which was based on McQuarrie&#x27;s original design of Hoth, and the characters Zeb Orrelios and Chopper, based on his original designs for Chewbacca and R2-D2, respectively.

==Personal life==
McQuarrie married Joan Benjamin in 1983 and stayed married until his death at age 82 on March 3, 2012, in his Berkeley, CA home. McQuarrie died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Critical assessment==
Christian Blauvelt of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised McQuarrie&#x27;s works as &quot;pioneering of the &#x27;used future&#x27; aesthetic&quot; which unlike other science-fiction, &quot;imagined a lived-in galaxy that was gritty, dirty, and in advance states of decay.&quot; He described McQuarrie&#x27;s style as &quot;strongly geometric subjects rendered in muted colors against a flat, purposefully compressed backdrop. A McQuarrie &quot;Star Wars&quot; design looks like what would have resulted if Salvador Dalí had sketched concepts for Universal&#x27;s 1936 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serial by way of Sergio Leone&#x27;s Old West.&quot;

Neil Kendricks of &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; emphasised McQuarrie&#x27;s importance to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, saying that the artist &quot;holds a unique position when it comes to defining much of the look of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe.&quot;

After McQuarrie&#x27;s death, George Lucas said: &quot;His genial contribution, in the form of unequalled production paintings, propelled and inspired all of the cast and crew of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. When words could not convey my ideas, I could always point to one of Ralph&#x27;s fabulous illustrations and say, &#x27;do it like this&#x27;.&quot;

==Legacy==
The current Lucasfilm creative team is employing parts of McQuarrie&#x27;s original unused concept art from the seventies and eighties in the development of new &quot;Star Wars&quot;-related media.

For Star Wars Day in 2023, &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&quot; released a free DLC character named Luke Starkiller, based on McQuarrie&#x27;s design.

<doc id="879260" wikidata="Q3641253" url="?curid=879260" title="Boardwalk (music club)">
<text>The Boardwalk was a nightclub in Manchester, England, which was open from 1986 to 1999. This medium-sized club, owned by David, Colin and Donald Sinclair, was a popular live music venue and nightclub in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It had multiple floors, with a rehearsal space in the basement.

Colin Sinclair and his father bought the Boardwalk building, located on Little Peter Street, in 1985. Originally a school operated by St. Peter&#x27;s church, the building&#x27;s top floor had been used as a rehearsal space for the Hallé Orchestra under John Barbirolli, and, from the 1970s, as a home for an alternative theatre company, the Green Room (which later moved to Whitworth St West) . The first live event at the Boardwalk took place 15 December 1985, although at the time the venue had no alcohol licence.

Along with other clubs like the Haçienda, and the International, the Boardwalk provided an important live venue for many bands, from local to national. Sue Langford organised in-house bookings at the Boardwalk, with various independent promoters also hosting shows at the venue (including Simon Moran). Bands such as Oasis and Northside made their live debuts at the Boardwalk. The Man From Delmonte, the Charlatans, Happy Mondays, Female Brothers and Dub Sex, were amongst the many Manchester bands that appeared frequently at the Boardwalk before acquiring international recognition or disappearing into obscurity. The venue also saw a variety of other acts including The Stone Roses, Hole, Sonic Youth, Chumbawamba, Jayne County, Verve, Bob Mould and Rage Against the Machine. The venue was also known as a focus of Britain&#x27;s C86 music scene.

The basement of the venue served as a rehearsal space. The Membranes, James, Simply Red, and A Certain Ratio were among the acts who took rehearsal space at the Boardwalk in the 1980s. In the early 1990s, Oasis shared a rehearsal room with Sister Lovers.

The venue added a mezzanine floor in December 1990 marking a shift to club nights every Saturday. &#x27;Freedom&#x27; took place every Saturday from December 1990 until June 1996, featuring former Haçienda DJ Dave Haslam alongside guest DJs including Erick Morillo, Pete Heller, Nick Warren and Pete Tong. From March 1992 until March 1999 a second club night, &#x27;Yellow&#x27; was staged every Friday at the Boardwalk. Funkademia was started by DJ and promoter David Payne at The Boardwalk in 1995 and has since gone on to be Manchester&#x27;s longest running club night, currently at the Mint Lounge.

The nightclub site now has a blue plaque, featuring a smiley face, a symbol associated with acid house. Beneath the symbol is a description of The Boardwalk as a &quot;Madchester Venue Nightclub and Rehearsal Rooms&quot;.

<text>The three-component theory of stratification, more widely known as Weberian stratification or the three class system, was developed by German sociologist Max Weber with class, status and party as distinct ideal types. Weber developed a multidimensional approach to social stratification that reflects the interplay among wealth, prestige and power.
:Weber argued that power can take a variety of forms. A person&#x27;s power can be shown in the social order through their status, in the economic order through their class, and in the political order through their party. Thus, class, status and party are each aspects of the distribution of power within a community.
Class, status and power have not only a great deal of effect within their individual areas but also a great deal of influence over the other areas.
* [[Wealth]]: includes property such as buildings, lands, farms, houses, factories and as well as other assets – &quot;Economic Situation&quot;
* Prestige: the respect with which a person or status position is regarded by others – &quot;Status Situation&quot;
* Power: the ability of people or groups to achieve their goals despite opposition from others – &quot;Parties&quot;

According to Weber, there are two basic dimensions of power: the &quot;possession&quot; of power and the &quot;exercising&quot; of power.

This essay was written shortly before World War I and was published posthumously in 1922 as part of Weber&#x27;s . It was translated into English in the 1940s as &quot;Class, Status, Party&quot;; reproduced with modifications in Weber 1978:926–939. and has been re-translated as &quot;The distribution of power within the community: Classes, , Parties&quot;.

== Possession of power ==
According to Weber, the ability to possess power derives from the individual&#x27;s ability to control various &quot;social resources&quot;. &quot;The mode of distribution gives to the propertied a monopoly on the possibility of transferring property from the sphere of use as &#x27;wealth&#x27; to the sphere of &#x27;capital,&#x27; that is, it gives them the entrepreneurial function and all chances to share directly or indirectly in returns on capital&quot;. These resources can be anything and everything: they might include land, capital, social respect, physical strength, and intellectual knowledge.

== Exercising of power ==
The ability to exercise power takes a number of different forms, but all involve the idea that it means the ability to get your own way with others, regardless of their ability to resist you. &quot;For example, if we think about an individual&#x27;s chances of realizing their own will against someone else, it is reasonable to believe that the person&#x27;s social prestige, class position, and membership in a political group will have an effect on these chances&quot;. In terms of understanding the relationship between power and social stratification, Weber theorized the various ways in which societies are organized in hierarchical systems of domination and subordination using the several major concepts.

=== Class and power ===
&quot;Class, at its core, is an economic concept; it is the position of individuals in the market that determines their class position. And it is how one is situated in the marketplace that directly affects one&#x27;s life chances&quot;. This was theorized by Weber on the basis of &quot;unequal access to material resources&quot;. For example, if someone possesses something that you want or need then this makes him potentially more powerful than you. He is in a dominant position and you are in a subordinate position because he controls access to a desired social resource. A classic illustration here is the relationship between an employer and employee.

=== Social power (status or ) ===
&quot;The existence of status groups most often shows itself in the form of

# endogamy or the restricted pattern of social intercourse,
# sharing of food and other benefits within groups,
# status conventions or traditions, and
# monopolistic acquisition of certain economic opportunities or the avoidance of certain kinds of acquisitions.

If you respect someone or view him as your social superior, then he will potentially be able to exercise power over you (since you will respond positively to his instructions / commands). In this respect, social status is a social resource simply because he may have it while you may not. &quot;Not all power, however entails social honor: The Typical American Boss, as well as the typical big speculator, deliberately relinquishes social honor. Quite generally, &#x27;mere economic&#x27; power, and especially &#x27;naked&#x27; money power, is by no means a recognized basis or social honor&quot;.

Note: The German word , plural (English, &quot;status&quot; or &quot;status group&quot;) is sometimes left untranslated in Weber, in order to keep in view the origins of this concept in medieval guilds, professions, ethnic identities, and feudal classifications.

=== Political power (party) ===
Parties are associations that aim at securing &quot;power within an organization [or the state] for its leaders in order to attain ideal or material advantages for its active members&quot;. This form of power can be related to the way in which the State is organized in modern social systems (involving the ability to make laws, for example). If you can influence this process of law creation then you will be in a potentially powerful position. Thus, by your ability to influence a decision-making process you possess power, even though you may not directly exercise that power personally. Political parties are the organizational means to possess power through the mechanism of the State and they include not just formally organized parties, but any group that is organized to influence the way in which power is exercised legitimately through the machinery of the State. &quot;Since parties aim at such goals as getting their programs developed or accepted and getting positions of influence within organizations, it is clear that they operate only within a rational order within which these goals are possible to attain and only when there is a struggle for power&quot;.

=== Social action ===
Social action is in direct relation to &quot;political or party power&quot; in combination with the class situation. The influence of laws is based on the social action of members of the classes. &quot;The direction of interests may vary according to whether or not social action of a larger or smaller portion of those commonly affected by the class situation, or even an association among them, e.g., a trade union, has grown out of the class situation, from which the individual may expect promising results for himself&quot;. &quot;The degree in which &quot;social action&quot; and possibly associations emerge from the mass behavior of the members of a class is linked to general cultural conditions, especially to those of an intellectual sort. It is also likened to the extent of the contrasts that have already evolved&quot;. &quot;Class-conscious action is most likely if, first, [Weber says] &#x27;the connection between the causes and consequences of the &quot;class situation&quot;&#x27; are transparent, or clear. If individuals can plainly see that there is a connection between the structure of the economic system and what happens to them in terms of life chances, class action is more likely&quot;. The greater the numbers within these class positions, will increase the chance that they will rise up in action.

=== Mobility ===
&quot;It is noncontroversial that the class situation in which each individual finds himself represents a limitation on his scope, tends to keep him within the class. It acts as an obstacle to any rise into a higher class, and as a pair of water wings with respect to the classes below...Class type, relations with class fellows, power over outward resources adapted to the class situation, and so on&quot;. In capitalist society movement between classes is a possibility. Hence the use of the term &quot;The American Dream&quot; to show the ability of people to ascend to a higher class through hard work and ingenuity. &quot;Class composition is forever changing, to the point where there may be a completely new set of families&quot;.

Weber saw four classes: the propertied class, the non-propertied class, the petit bourgeoisie and the manual labourer class.

<text>Anti-Japanese sentiment (also called Japanophobia, Nipponophobia and anti-Japanism) is the fear or dislike of Japan or Japanese culture. Anti-Japanese sentiment can take many forms, from antipathy toward the Japan&#x27;s country to racist hatred of Japanese people.

==Overview==
Anti-Japanese sentiments range from towards the Japanese government&#x27;s actions during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, to disdain for Japanese culture, or to racism against the Japanese people. Sentiments of dehumanization have been fueled by the anti-Japanese propaganda of the Allied governments in World War II; this propaganda was often of a racially disparaging character. Anti-Japanese sentiment may be strongest in Korea and China, due to atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese military.

In the past, anti-Japanese sentiment contained innuendos of Japanese people as barbaric. Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Japan was intent to adopt Western ways in an attempt to join the West as an industrialized imperial power, but a lack of acceptance of the Japanese in the West complicated integration and assimilation. Japanese culture was viewed with suspicion and even disdain.

While passions have settled somewhat since Imperial Japan&#x27;s surrender in the Pacific War theater of World War II, tempers continue to flare on occasion over the widespread perception that the Japanese government has made insufficient penance for their past atrocities, or has sought to whitewash the history of these events. Today, though the Japanese government has effected some compensatory measures, anti-Japanese sentiment continues based on historical and nationalist animosities linked to Imperial Japanese military aggression and atrocities. Japan&#x27;s delay in clearing more than 700,000 (according to the Japanese Government) pieces of life-threatening and environment contaminating chemical weapons buried in China at the end of World War II is another cause of anti-Japanese sentiment. 

Periodically, individuals within Japan spur external criticism. Former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was heavily criticized by South Korea and China for annually paying his respects to the war dead at Yasukuni Shrine, which enshrines all those who fought and died for Imperial Japan as part of the Axis Powers during World War II, including 1,068 convicted war criminals. Right-wing nationalist groups have produced history textbooks whitewashing Japanese atrocities, and the recurring controversies over these books occasionally attract hostile foreign attention.

Some anti-Japanese sentiment originates from business practices used by some Japanese companies, such as dumping.

==By region==
=== Brazil ===
Like the elites in Argentina and Uruguay, the Brazilian elite wanted to racially whiten the country&#x27;s population during the 19th and 20th centuries. The country&#x27;s governments always encouraged European immigration, but non-white immigration was always greeted with considerable opposition. The communities of Japanese immigrants were seen as an obstacle to the whitening of Brazil and they were also seen, among other concerns, as being particularly tendentious because they formed ghettos and they also practiced endogamy at a high rate. Oliveira Viana, a Brazilian jurist, historian, and sociologist, described the Japanese immigrants as follows: &quot;They (Japanese) are like sulfur: insoluble.&quot; The Brazilian magazine &quot;O Malho&quot; in its edition of 5 December 1908, issued a charge of Japanese immigrants with the following legend: &quot;The government of São Paulo is stubborn. After the failure of the first Japanese immigration, it contracted 3,000 yellow people. It insists on giving Brazil a race diametrically opposite to ours.&quot; On 22 October 1923, Representative Fidélis Reis produced a bill on the entry of immigrants, whose fifth article was as follows: &quot;The entry of settlers from the black race into Brazil is prohibited. For Asian [immigrants] there will be allowed each year a number equal to 5% of those residing in the country...&quot;

Years before World War II, the government of President Getúlio Vargas initiated a process of forced assimilation of people of immigrant origin in Brazil. In 1933, a constitutional amendment was approved by a large majority and established immigration quotas without mentioning race or nationality and prohibited the population concentration of immigrants. According to the text, Brazil could not receive more than 2% of the total number of entrants of each nationality that had been received in the last 50 years. Only the Portuguese were excluded. The measures did not affect the immigration of Europeans such as Italians and Spaniards, who had already entered in large numbers and whose migratory flow was downward. However, immigration quotas, which remained in force until the 1980s, restricted Japanese immigration, as well as Korean and Chinese immigration.

When Brazil sided with the Allies and declared war on Japan in 1942, all communication with Japan was cut off, the entry of new Japanese immigrants was forbidden, and many restrictions affected the Japanese Brazilians. Japanese newspapers and teaching the Japanese language in schools were banned, which left Portuguese as the only option for Japanese descendants. As many Japanese immigrants could not understand Portuguese, it became exceedingly difficult for them to obtain any extra-communal information. In 1939, research of Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil in São Paulo showed that 87.7% of Japanese Brazilians read newspapers in the Japanese language, a much higher literacy rate than the general populace at the time. Japanese Brazilians could not travel without safe conduct issued by the police, Japanese schools were closed, and radio receivers were confiscated to prevent transmissions on shortwave from Japan. The goods of Japanese companies were confiscated and several companies of Japanese origin had interventions by the government. Japanese Brazilians were prohibited from driving motor vehicles, and the drivers employed by the Japanese had to have permission from the police. Thousands of Japanese immigrants were arrested or deported from Brazil on suspicion of espionage. On 10 July 1943, approximately 10,000 Japanese and German and Italian immigrants who lived in Santos had 24 hours to move away from the Brazilian coast. The police acted without any notice. About 90% of the people displaced were Japanese. To reside in coastal areas, the Japanese had to have a safe conduct. In 1942, the Japanese community that introduced the cultivation of pepper in Tomé-Açu, in Pará, was virtually turned into a &quot;concentration camp&quot;. This time, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, DC, Carlos Martins Pereira e Sousa, encouraged the government of Brazil to transfer all Japanese Brazilians to &quot;internment camps&quot; without the need for legal support, just as was done with the Japanese residents in the United States. However, no suspicion of activities of the Japanese against &quot;national security&quot; was ever confirmed.

Even after the war ended, anti-Japanese sentiment persisted in Brazil. After the war, Shindo Renmei, a terrorist organization formed by Japanese immigrants that murdered Japanese-Brazilians who believed in Japanese surrender, was founded. The violent acts committed by this organization increased anti-Japanese sentiment in Brazil and caused several violent conflicts between Brazilians and Japanese-Brazilians. During the National Constituent Assembly of 1946, the representative of Rio de Janeiro Miguel Couto Filho proposed an amendment to the Constitution saying &quot;It is prohibited the entry of Japanese immigrants of any age and any origin in the country.&quot; In the final vote, a tie with 99 votes in favour and 99 against. Senator Fernando de Melo Viana, who chaired the session of the Constituent Assembly, had the casting vote and rejected the constitutional amendment. By only one vote, the immigration of Japanese people to Brazil was not prohibited by the Brazilian Constitution of 1946.

In the second half of the 2010s, a certain anti-Japanese feeling has grown in Brazil. The former Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, was accused of making statements considered discriminatory against Japanese people, which generated repercussions in the press and in the Japanese-Brazilian community, which is considered the largest in the world outside of Japan. In addition, in 2020, possibly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some incidents of xenophobia and abuse were reported to Japanese-Brazilians in cities such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

According to a 2017 BBC World Service survey, 70% of Brazilians view Japan&#x27;s influence positively, with 15% expressing a negative view, making Brazil one of the most pro-Japanese countries in South America.

=== Canada ===
Like other countries to which the Japanese immigrated in significant numbers, anti-Japanese sentiment in Canada was strongest during the 20th century, with the formation of anti-immigration organizations such as the Asiatic Exclusion League in response to Japanese and other Asian immigration. Anti-Japanese and anti-Chinese riots also frequently broke out such one in early 1900s Vancouver. During World War II, Japanese Canadians were interned like their American counterparts. Financial compensation for surviving internees was finally paid in 1988 by the Brian Mulroney government.

===China===
Anti-Japanese sentiment is felt very strongly in China and distrust, hostility and negative feelings towards Japan and the Japanese people and culture is widespread in China. Anti-Japanese sentiment is a phenomenon that mostly dates back to modern times (since 1868). Like many Western powers during the era of imperialism, Imperial Japan negotiated treaties that often resulted in the annexation of land from China towards the end of the Qing dynasty. Dissatisfaction with Japanese settlements and the Twenty-One Demands by the Japanese government led to a serious boycott of Japanese products in China.

Today, bitterness persists in China over the atrocities of the Second Sino-Japanese War and Japan&#x27;s postwar actions, particularly the perceived lack of a straightforward acknowledgment of such atrocities, the Japanese government&#x27;s employment of known war criminals, and Japanese historic revisionism in textbooks. In elementary school, children are taught about Japanese war crimes in detail. For example, thousands of children are brought to the Museum of the War of Chinese People&#x27;s Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in Beijing by their elementary schools and required to view photos of war atrocities, such as exhibits of records of the Japanese military forcing Chinese workers into wartime labor, the Nanjing Massacre, and the issues of comfort women. After viewing the museum, the children&#x27;s hatred of the Japanese people was reported to significantly increase. Despite the time that has passed since the end of the war, discussions about Japanese conduct during it can still evoke powerful emotions today, partly because most Japanese are aware of what happened during it although their society has never engaged in the type of introspection which has been common in Germany after the Holocaust. Hence, the usage of Japanese military symbols is still controversial in China, such as the incident in which the Chinese pop singer Zhao Wei was seen wearing a Rising Sun Flag while she was dressed for a fashion magazine photo shoot in 2001. Huge responses were seen on the Internet, a public letter demanding a public apology was also circulated by a Nanjing Massacre survivor, and the singer was even attacked. According to a 2017 BBC World Service Poll, only 22% of Chinese people view Japan&#x27;s influence positively, and 75% express a negative view, making China the most anti-Japanese nation in the world.

In recent times, Chinese Japanophiles are often denounced by nationalists as Hanjian (traitors) or Jingri.

====Anti-Japanese film industry====
Anti-Japanese sentiment can also be seen in war films and anime that are currently being produced and broadcast in Mainland China. More than 200 anti-Japanese films were produced in China in 2012 alone. In one particular situation involving a more moderate anti-Japanese war film, the government of China banned the 2000 film, &quot;Devils on the Doorstep&quot; because it depicted a Japanese soldier being friendly with Chinese villagers. While &quot;Lycoris Recoil&quot; considered too violent in Southeast Asia since the assassination of Shinzo Abe.

=== France ===
Japan&#x27;s public service broadcaster, NHK, provides a list of overseas safety risks for traveling, and in early 2020, it listed anti-Japanese discrimination as a safety risk on travel to France and some other European countries, possibly because of fears over the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. Signs of rising anti-Japanese sentiment in France include an increase in anti-Japanese incidents reported by Japanese nationals, such as being mocked on the street and refused taxi service, and least one Japanese restaurant has been vandalized. A group of Japanese students on a study tour in Paris received abuse by locals. Another group of Japanese citizens was targeted by acid attacks, which prompted the Japanese embassy as well as the foreign ministry to issue a warning to Japanese nationals in France, urging caution. Due to rising discrimination, a Japanese TV announcer in Paris said it&#x27;s best not to speak Japanese in public or wear a Japanese costume like a kimono. Japanese people are also subject to many stereotypes from the French Entertainment industry that has cemented a general image, often a negative one.

=== Germany ===
According to the Japanese foreign ministry, anti-Japanese sentiment and discrimination has been rising in Germany, especially recently when the COVID-19 pandemic began affecting the country.

Media sources have reported a rise in anti-Japanese sentiment in Germany, with some Japanese residents saying suspicion and contempt towards them have increased noticeably. In line with those sentiments, there have been a rising number of anti-Japanese incidents such as at least one major football club kicking out all Japanese fans from their stadium over fears of the coronavirus, locals throwing raw eggs at Japanese people&#x27;s homes and a general increase in the level of harassment toward Japanese residents.

=== Indonesia ===
In a press release, the embassy of Japan in Indonesia stated that incidents of discrimination and harassment of Japanese people had increased, and they were possibly partly related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and it also announced that it had set up a help center in order to assist Japanese residents in dealing with those incidents. In general, there have been reports of widespread anti-Japanese discrimination and harassment in the country, with hotels, stores, restaurants, taxi services and more refusing Japanese customers and many Japanese people were no longer allowed in meetings and conferences. The embassy of Japan has also received at least a dozen reports of harassment toward Japanese people in just a few days. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan), anti-Japanese sentiment and discrimination has been rising in Indonesia.

===Japan===
===Korea===
The issue of anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea is complex and multifaceted. Anti-Japanese attitudes in the Korean Peninsula can be traced as far back as the Japanese pirate raids and the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), but they are largely a product of the Japanese occupation of Korea which lasted from 1910 to 1945 and the subsequent revisionism of history textbooks which have been used by Japan&#x27;s educational system since World War II.

Today, issues of Japanese history textbook controversies, Japanese policy regarding the war, and geographic disputes between the two countries perpetuate that sentiment, and the issues often incur huge disputes between Japanese and South Korean Internet users. South Korea, together with Mainland China, may be considered as among the most intensely anti-Japanese societies in the world. Among all the countries that participated in BBC World Service Poll in 2007 and 2009, South Korea and the People&#x27;s Republic of China were the only ones whose majorities rated Japan negatively.

Today, chinilpa is also associated with general anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea and is often used as a derogatory term for Japanophilic Koreans.

Anti-Japanese sentiment can at times be seen in Korean media. One example is the widely popular web novel, Solo Leveling in which Japanese characters appear as antagonists who have malicious intent and want to hurt the Korean protagonist. However, the Webtoon version significantly edits such depictions of Japanese characters out, though not completely, in order to avoid upsetting non-Korean readers.

The book &quot;Anti-Japan Tribalism&quot; by South Korean scholars Lee Young-hoon, Kim Nak-nyeon, and others offers a perspective on anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea. The authors argue that much of this sentiment stems from nationalistic narratives rather than objective historical analysis. They claim that distorted accounts of issues such as comfort women and forced labor have been perpetuated through public education and media, reinforcing negative perceptions of Japan.

The book asserts that emotionally charged narratives and politically motivated interpretations have overshadowed factual historical analysis, fostering what the authors describe as &quot;tribalism.&quot; This, they argue, hinders reconciliation, diplomatic relations, and regional cooperation between South Korea and Japan. 

=== Peru ===
Anti-Japanese sentiment in Peru started during 20th century as part of a general anti-Asiatic sentiment after Chinese immigration in Perú, because Japanese and Chinese people were catalogued as a &quot;yellow menace&quot; that deteriorate the race and invaded Peruvian territory. Politicians and intellectuals tried to generate repudiation against Asians through publications such as bulletins and articles in newspapers and pamphlets that ridiculed them, even inciting the Peruvian people to attack Peruvian-Japanese citizens and their businesses. Peruvian worker protests led to the creation of an Anti-Asian Association in 1917 and the abolition of contract migration in 1923. 

Then, the pre-war times were especially difficult for Japanese immigrants, coming to influence the Peruvian government itself (with the deportations of Japanese to concentration camps in the United States during World War II, specially to the country&#x27;s only family internment camp in Crystal City, Texas). Although there had been ongoing tensions between non-Japanese and Japanese Peruvians, the situation was drastically exacerbated by the war. The economic success of Japanese farmers and businessmen in niche but visible sectors, the significant amount of remittances sent back to Japan, the fear that Japanese were taking jobs from the locals and a growing trade imbalance between Japan and Peru were motives to implement legislation in order to curb Japanese immigration into its borders. Like In 1937, in which Peruvian government passed a decree revoking citizenship rights of Peruvians who had Japanese ancestry, followed by a second decree making it even more difficult to maintain citizenship, the results of which included stigmatization of Japanese immigrants as &quot;bestial&quot;, &quot;untrustworthy&quot;, &quot;militaristic,&quot;. and &quot;unfairly&quot; competing with Peruvians for wages. These contributed to increasing nationalism and anti-Japanese sentiment which worsened alongside the depressed and unstable Peruvian economy. 

Fueled by legislative discrimination and media campaigns, a massive race riot (referred to as the &quot;Saqueo&quot;) began on May 13, 1940, and lasted for three days. During the riots Japanese Peruvians were attacked and their homes and businesses destroyed. There were damaged over 600 Japanese residences and businesses in Lima, resulting in dozens of injuries and one Japanese death. Not only was it the “worst rioting in Peruvian history,” but it was also the first to target a racial group (because Peruvians mostly discriminate by social class, but doesn&#x27;t had a tradition of discrimination by race). Despite its massive scale, the saqueo was underreported, a reflection of public sentiment towards the Japanese population at the time.

The deportees were viewed as a threat to both Peru and the United States before and after the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, being registered pressure from the United States, which was an influence for Peruvians’ “anti-Japanese attitude” against their own citizens. The deportation of Japanese Peruvians to the United States also involved expropriation without compensation of their property and other assets in Peru. As noted in a 1943 memorandum, Raymond Ickes of the Central and South American division of the Alien Enemy Control Unit had observed that many ethnic Japanese had been sent to the United States &quot;... merely because the Peruvians wanted their businesses and not because there was any adverse evidence against them.&quot;

During post-war, decreased anti-Japanese sentiment on Peruvian society, specially after 1960 (when Japan started to develop closer relations with Peru and their Nikkei community). However, there was a light revival of those sentiments after the government of Alberto Fujimori, a Peruvian-Japanese who was involved in Corruption in Peru, which generated antipathy against Japan in Peruvian circles. This revival of the sentiment was so intense that were concerned by the Japan government, after Alberto Fujimori&#x27;s arrest and trial, the Japanese embassy in Peru and the local media have received frequent telephone calls threatening to harm Japanese-Peruvians, Japanese businesses in Peru, the installations of the embassy and its staff. 

===Philippines===
Anti-Japanese sentiment in the Philippines can be traced back to the Japanese occupation of the country during World War II and its aftermath. An estimated 1 million Filipinos out of a wartime population of 17 million were killed during the war, and many more Filipinos were injured. Nearly every Filipino family was affected by the war on some level. Most notably, in the city of Mapanique, survivors have recounted the Japanese occupation during which Filipino men were massacred and dozens of women were herded in order to be used as comfort women. Today, the Philippines has peaceful relations with Japan. In addition, Filipinos are generally not as offended as Chinese or Koreans are by the claim from some quarters that the atrocities are given little, if any, attention in Japanese classrooms. This feeling exists as a result of the huge amount of Japanese aid which was sent to the country during the 1960s and 1970s.

The Davao Region, in Mindanao, had a large community of Japanese immigrants which acted as a fifth column by welcoming the Japanese invaders during the war. The Japanese were hated by the Moro Muslims and the Chinese. The Moro juramentadoss performed suicide attacks against the Japanese, and no Moro juramentado ever attacked the Chinese, who were not considered enemies of the Moro, unlike the Japanese.

According to a 2011 BBC World Service Poll, 84% of Filipinos view Japan&#x27;s influence positively, with 12% expressing a negative view, making Philippines one of the most pro-Japanese countries in the world.

===Singapore===
The older generation of Singaporeans have some resentment towards Japan due to their experiences in World War II when Singapore was under Japanese Occupation but because of developing good economical ties with them, Singapore is currently having a positive relationship with Japan.

===Taiwan===

Due to Japan&#x27;s various oppression and enslavement of Taiwan during World War II and the dispute over the Senkaku Islands, anti-Japanese sentiment in Taiwan is very common, and most Taiwanese people have a negative impression of Japan. However, according to other surveys, Taiwan&#x27;s anti-Japanese sentiment is seen as much weaker or relatively favorable compared to South Korea, which was affected by the same Japanese colonialism. Anti-Japanese sentiment appears weaker in Taiwan than anti-Chinese (especially anti-PRC) sentiment.

The Kuomintang (KMT) victory in 2008 was followed by a boating accident resulting in Taiwanese deaths, which caused recent tensions. Taiwanese officials began speaking out on the historical territory disputes regarding the Diaoyutai/Senkaku Islands, which resulted in an increase in at least perceived anti-Japanese sentiment.

=== Thailand ===
Anti-Japanese sentiment was widespread among Thai pro-democracy student protesters in the 1970s. Demonstrators viewed the entry of Japanese companies into the country, invited by the Thai military, as an economic invasion. Anti-Japanese sentiment in the country has since then simmered down.

===Russian Empire and Soviet Union===

In the Russian Empire, the Imperial Japanese victory during the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 halted Russia&#x27;s ambitions in the East and led to a loss of prestige. During the later Russian Civil War, Japan was part of the Allied interventionist forces that helped to occupy Vladivostok until October 1922 with a puppet government under Grigorii Semenov. At the end of World War II during the Soviet-Japanese War in August 1945, the Red Army accepted the surrender of nearly 600,000 Japanese POWs after Emperor Hirohito announced the Japanese surrender on 15 August; 473,000 of them were repatriated, 55,000 of them had died in Soviet captivity, and the fate of the others is unknown. Presumably, many of them were deported to China or North Korea and forced to serve as laborers and soldiers. The Kuril Islands dispute is a source of contemporary anti-Japanese sentiment in Russia.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the 1902, the United Kingdom signed a formal military alliance with Japan. However, the alliance was especially discontinued in 1923, and by the 1930s, bilateral ties became strained when Britain opposed Japan&#x27;s military expansion. During World War II, British anti-Japanese propaganda, much like its American counterpart, featured content that grotesquely exaggerated physical features of Japanese people, if not outright depicting them as animals such as spiders. Post-war, much anti-Japanese sentiment in Britain was focused on the treatment of British POWs (See &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;).

===United States===
====Pre-20th century====
In the United States, anti-Japanese sentiment had its beginnings long before World War II. As early as the late 19th century, Asian immigrants were subjected to racial prejudice in the United States. Laws were passed which openly discriminated against Asians and sometimes, they particularly discriminated against Japanese. Many of these laws stated that Asians could not become US citizens and they also stated that Asians could not be granted basic rights such as the right to own land. These laws were greatly detrimental to the newly arrived immigrants because they denied them the right to own land and forced many of them who were farmers to become migrant workers. Some cite the formation of the Asiatic Exclusion League as the start of the anti-Japanese movement in California.

====Early 20th century====
Anti-Japanese racism and the belief in the Yellow Peril in California intensified after the Japanese victory over the Russian Empire during the Russo-Japanese War. On 11 October 1906, the San Francisco, California Board of Education passed a regulation in which children of Japanese descent would be required to attend racially-segregated separate schools. Japanese immigrants then made up approximately 1% of the population of California, and many of them had come under the treaty in 1894 which had assured free immigration from Japan.

The Japanese invasion of Manchuria, China, in 1931 and was roundly criticized in the US. In addition, efforts by citizens outraged at Japanese atrocities, such as the Nanking Massacre, led to calls for American economic intervention to encourage Japan to leave China. The calls played a role in shaping American foreign policy. As more and more unfavorable reports of Japanese actions came to the attention of the American government, embargoes on oil and other supplies were placed on Japan out of concern for the Chinese people and for the American interests in the Pacific. Furthermore, European-Americans became very pro-China and anti-Japan, an example being a grassroots campaign for women to stop buying silk stockings because the material was procured from Japan through its colonies.

When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Western public opinion was decidedly pro-China, with eyewitness reports by Western journalists on atrocities committed against Chinese civilians further strengthening anti-Japanese sentiments. African-American sentiments could be quite different than the mainstream and included organizations like the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World (PMEW), which promised equality and land distribution under Japanese rule. The PMEW had thousands of members hopefully preparing for liberation from white supremacy with the arrival of the Japanese Imperial Army.

====World War II====


The most profound cause of anti-Japanese sentiment outside of Asia started by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which propelled the United States into World War II. The Americans were unified by the attack to fight the Empire of Japan and its allies: the German Reich and the Kingdom of Italy.

The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor without a declaration of war was commonly regarded as an act of treachery and cowardice. After the attack, many non-governmental &quot;Jap hunting licenses&quot; were circulated around the country. &quot;Life&quot; magazine published an article on how to tell the difference between Japanese and Chinese by describing the shapes of their noses and the statures of their bodies. Additionally, Japanese conduct during the war did little to quell anti-Japanese sentiment. The flames of outrage were fanned by the treatment of American and other prisoners-of-war (POWs). The Japanese military&#x27;s outrages included the murder of POWs, the use of POWs as slave laborers by Japanese industries, the Bataan Death March, the kamikaze attacks on Allied ships, the atrocities which were committed on Wake Island, and other atrocities which were committed elsewhere.

The US historian James J. Weingartner attributes the very low number of Japanese in US POW compounds to two key factors: a Japanese reluctance to surrender and a widespread American &quot;conviction that the Japanese were &#x27;animals&#x27; or &#x27;subhuman&#x27; and unworthy of the normal treatment accorded to POWs.&quot; The latter reasoning is supported by Niall Ferguson: &quot;Allied troops often saw the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russians [sic] — as Untermenschen.&quot; Weingartner believed that to explain why merely 604 Japanese captives were alive in Allied POW camps by October 1944.
Ulrich Straus, a US Japanologist, wrote that frontline troops intensely hated Japanese military personnel and were &quot;not easily persuaded&quot; to take or protect prisoners, as they believed that Allied personnel who surrendered got &quot;no mercy&quot; from the Japanese.

Allied soldiers believed that Japanese soldiers were inclined to feign surrender in order to launch surprise attacks. Therefore, according to Straus, &quot;[s]enior officers opposed the taking of prisoners[,] on the grounds that it needlessly exposed American troops to risks...&quot;

An estimated 112,000 to 120,000 Japanese migrants and Japanese Americans from the West Coast were interned regardless of their attitude to the US or to Japan. They were held for the duration of the war in the Continental US. Only a few members of the large Japanese population of Hawaii were relocated in spite of the proximity to vital military areas.

A 1944 opinion poll found that 13% of the US public supported the genocide of all Japanese. Daniel Goldhagen wrote in his book, &quot;So it is no surprise that Americans perpetrated and supported mass slaughters - Tokyo&#x27;s firebombing and then nuclear incinerations - in the name of saving American lives, and of giving the Japanese what they richly deserved.&quot;

=====Decision to drop the atomic bombs=====
Weingartner argued that there was a common cause between the mutilation of Japanese war dead and the decision to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki. According to Weingartner, both of these decisions were partially the result of the dehumanization of the enemy: &quot;The widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands.&quot; Two days after the Nagasaki bomb, US President Harry Truman stated: &quot;The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. When you have to deal with a beast you have to treat him like a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true.&quot;

====Postwar====
In the 1970s and the 1980s, the waning fortunes of heavy industry in the United States prompted layoffs and hiring slowdowns just as counterpart businesses in Japan were making major inroads into US markets. That was most visible than in the automobile industry whose lethargic Big Three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) watched as their former customers bought Japanese imports from Honda, Subaru, Mazda, and Nissan because of the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis. (When Japanese automakers were establishing their inroads into the US and Canada. Isuzu, Mazda, and Mitsubishi had joint partnerships with a Big Three manufacturer (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) in which its products were sold as captives). Anti-Japanese sentiment was reflected in opinion polling at the time as well as in media portrayals. Extreme manifestations of anti-Japanese sentiment were occasional public destruction of Japanese cars and in the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin, a Chinese-American who was beaten to death after he had been mistaken for being Japanese.

Anti-Japanese sentiments were intentionally incited by US politicians as part of partisan politics designed to attack the Reagan presidency.

Other highly-symbolic deals, including the sale of famous American commercial and cultural symbols such as Columbia Records, Columbia Pictures, 7-Eleven, and the Rockefeller Center building to Japanese firms, further fanned anti-Japanese sentiment.

Popular culture of the period reflected American&#x27;s growing distrust of Japan. Futuristic period pieces such as &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; and &quot;RoboCop 3&quot; frequently showed Americans as working precariously under Japanese superiors. The film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; showed a futuristic Los Angeles clearly under Japanese domination, with a Japanese majority population and culture, perhaps a reference to the alternate world presented in the novel &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; by Philip K. Dick, the same author on which the film was based in which Japan had won World War II. Criticism was also lobbied in many novels of the day. The author Michael Crichton wrote &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, a murder mystery (later made into a feature film) involving Japanese businessmen in the US. Likewise, in Tom Clancy&#x27;s book, &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;, Clancy implies that Japan&#x27;s prosperity was caused primarily to unequal trading terms and portrayed Japan&#x27;s business leaders acting in a power-hungry cabal.

As argued by Marie Thorsten, however, Japanophobia was mixed with Japanophilia during Japan&#x27;s peak moments of economic dominance in the 1980s. The fear of Japan became a rallying point for techno-nationalism, the imperative to be first in the world in mathematics, science, and other quantifiable measures of national strength necessary to boost technological and economic supremacy. Notorious &quot;Japan-bashing&quot; took place alongside the image of Japan as superhuman, which mimicked in some ways the image of the Soviet Union after it launched the first Sputnik satellite in 1957, and both events turned the spotlight on American education.

US bureaucrats purposely pushed that analogy. In 1982, Ernest Boyer, a former US Commissioner of Education, publicly declared, &quot;What we need is another Sputnik&quot; to reboot American education, and he said that &quot;maybe what we should do is get the Japanese to put a Toyota into orbit.&quot; Japan was both a threat and a model for human resource development in education and the workforce, which merged with the image of Asian-Americans as the &quot;model minority.&quot;

Both the animosity and the superhumanizing peaked in the 1980s, when the term &quot;Japan bashing&quot; became popular, but had largely faded by the late 1990s. Japan&#x27;s waning economic fortunes in the 1990s, now known as the Lost Decade, coupled with an upsurge in the US economy as the Internet took off, largely crowded anti-Japanese sentiment out of the popular media.

==Yasukuni Shrine==
The Yasukuni Shrine is a Shinto shrine in Tokyo, Japan. It is the resting place of thousands of not only Japanese soldiers, but also Korean and Taiwanese soldiers killed in various wars, mostly in World War II. The shrine includes 13 Class A criminals such as Hideki Tojo and Kōki Hirota, who were convicted and executed for their roles in the Japanese invasions of China, Korea, and other parts of East Asia after the remission to them under the Treaty of San Francisco. A total of 1,068 convicted war criminals are enshrined at the Yasukuni Shrine.

In recent years, the Yasukuni Shrine has become a sticking point in the relations of Japan and its neighbours. The enshrinement of war criminals has greatly angered the people of various countries invaded by Imperial Japan. In addition, the shrine published a pamphlet stating that &quot;[war] was necessary in order for us to protect the independence of Japan and to prosper together with our Asian neighbors&quot; and that the war criminals were &quot;cruelly and unjustly tried as war criminals by a sham-like tribunal of the Allied forces&quot;. While it is true that the fairness of these trials is disputed among jurists and historians in the West as well as in Japan, the former Prime Minister of Japan, Junichiro Koizumi, has visited the shrine five times; every visit caused immense uproar in China and South Korea. His successor, Shinzo Abe, was also a regular visitor of Yasukuni. Some Japanese politicians have responded by saying that the shrine, as well as visits to it, is protected by the constitutional right of freedom of religion. Yasuo Fukuda, chosen Prime Minister in September 2007, promised &quot;not to visit&quot; Yasukuni.

==Derogatory terms==

There are a variety of derogatory terms referring to Japan. Many of these terms are viewed as racist. However, these terms do not necessarily refer to the Japanese race as a whole; they can also refer to specific policies, or specific time periods in history.

===In English===
*Especially prevalent during World War II, the word &quot;Jap&quot; (short for Japanese) or &quot;Nip&quot; (short for &quot;Nippon&quot;, Japanese for &quot;Japan&quot; or Nipponjin for &quot;Japanese person&quot;) has been used mostly in America, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand as a derogatory word for the Japanese throughout the 19th and the 20th century when they came to Western countries, mostly the United States in large numbers. During WW2, some in the United States Marine Corps tried to combine the word Japs with apes to create a new description, Japes, for the Japanese, although this slur never became popular.
*The word Japanazi has also been used in English language media, a combination of the words &quot;&quot;Japan&quot; and &quot;Nazi&quot;&quot; (after Nazi Germany) as a derogatory word to insult Japan and the Axis powers in general.

===In Chinese===
*Riben guizi (; Cantonese: Yaatboon gwaizi; Mandarin: Rìběn guǐzi) – literally &quot;Japanese devils&quot; or &quot;Japanese monsters&quot;. This is used mostly in the context of the Second Sino-Japanese War, when Japan invaded and occupied large areas of China. This is the title of a Japanese documentary on Japanese war crimes during WWII. Recently, some Japanese have taken the slur and reversed the negative connotations by transforming it into a cute female personification named Hinomoto Oniko, which is an alternate reading in Japanese.
*Wokou (; ) – originally referred to Japanese pirates and armed sea merchants who raided the Chinese coastline during the Ming dynasty. The term was adopted during the Second Sino-Japanese War to refer to invading Japanese forces (similarly to Germans being called &quot;Huns&quot; In France and Britain). The word is today sometimes used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.
*Xiao Riben (; ) – literally &quot;puny Japan(ese)&quot;, or literally &quot;little Japan(ese)&quot;. This term is very common (Google Search returns 21,000,000 results as of August 2007). The term can be used to refer to either Japan or individual Japanese people.
*Riben zai (; ) – this is the most common term in use by Cantonese speaking Chinese, having similar meaning to the English word &quot;Jap&quot;. The term literally translates to &quot;Japanese kid&quot;. This term has become so common that it has little impact and does not seem to be too derogatory compared to other words below.
*Wo (; ) – this was an ancient Chinese name for Japan, but was also adopted by the Japanese. Today, its usage in Mandarin is usually intended to give a negative connotation. The character is said to also mean &quot;dwarf&quot;, although that meaning was not apparent when the name was first used. See Wa.
*Riben gou (; ) – &quot;Japanese dogs&quot;. The word is used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.
*Da jiaopen zu (; ) – &quot;big foot-basin race&quot;. Ethnic slur towards Japanese used predominantly by Northern Chinese, mainly those from the city of Tianjin.
*Huang jun (; ) – &quot;Yellow Army&quot;, a pun on &quot;皇軍&quot; (homophone &quot;huáng jūn&quot;, &quot;Imperial Army&quot;), used during World War II to represent Imperial Japanese soldiers due to the colour of the uniform. Today, it is used negatively against all Japanese. Since the stereotype of Japanese soldiers are commonly portrayed in war-related TV series in China as short men, with a toothbrush moustache (and sometimes round glasses, in the case of higher ranks), &quot;huang jun&quot; is also often used to pull jokes on Chinese people with these characteristics, and thus &quot;appear like&quot; Japanese soldiers. Also, since the colour of yellow is often associated with pornography in modern Chinese, it is also a mockery of the Japanese forcing women into prostitution during World War II.
*Zi wei dui (; ) – a pun on the homophone &quot;自衛隊&quot; (same pronunciation, &quot;self-defense forces&quot;, see Japan Self-Defense Forces), the definition of &quot;慰&quot; (Cantonese: wai3; pinyin: &quot;wèi&quot;) used is &quot;to comfort&quot;. This phrase is used to refer to Japanese (whose military force is known as &quot;自衛隊&quot;) being stereotypically hypersexual, as &quot;自慰隊&quot; means &quot;self-comforting forces&quot;, referring to masturbation.
*Ga zai / Ga mui (; ) – used only by Cantonese speakers to call Japanese men / young girls. &quot;㗎&quot; (&quot;gaa4&quot;) came from the frequent use of simple vowels (&quot;-a&quot; in this case) in Japanese language. &quot;仔&quot; (&quot;zai2&quot;) means &quot;little boy(s)&quot;, with relations to the stereotype of short Japanese men. &quot;妹&quot; (&quot;mui1&quot;) means &quot;young girl(s)&quot; (the speaker usually uses a lustful tone), with relations to the stereotype of disrespect to females in Japanese society. Sometimes, &quot;ga&quot; is used as an adjective to avoid using the proper word &quot;Japanese&quot;.
*Law bak tau (; ) – &quot;daikon head&quot;. Commonly used by the older people in the Cantonese-speaking world to call Japanese men.

===In Korean===
*Jjokbari () – translates as &quot;a person with cloven hoof-like feet&quot;. This term is the most frequently used and strongest ethnic slur used by Koreans to refer to Japanese. Refers to the traditional Japanese footwear of geta or tabi, both of which feature a gap between the big toe and the other four toes. The term compares Japanese to pigs. The term is also used by ethnic Koreans in Japan.
*Seom-nara won-sung-i () – literally &quot;island country monkey&quot;, more often translated as simply &quot;island monkey&quot;. Common derogatory term comparing Japanese to the Japanese macaque native to Japan.
*Wae-in () – translates as &quot;small Japanese person&quot;, although used with strong derogatory connotations. The term refers to the ancient name of Yamato Japan, &quot;Wae&quot;, on the basis of the stereotype that Japanese people were small (see Wa).
*Wae-nom () – translates as &quot;small Japanese bastard&quot;. It is used more frequently by older Korean generations, derived from the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598).
*Wae-gu () – originally referred to Japanese pirates, who frequently invaded Korea. The word is today used to refer to all Japanese people in an extremely negative context.

===In Filipino===
*Sakang is a Filipino insult meaning bow-legged, mainly directed towards Japanese people.

===In Portuguese===
*Japa is a term used in Brazil to refer to Japanese immigrants and their descendants many times accepted by the Japanese community, not analogous to English &quot;Jap&quot;.

=== Other ===
* Corona – There have been strong indications that the word &quot;corona&quot;, from the coronavirus, has become a relatively common slur toward Japanese people in several Arabic-speaking countries, with the Japanese embassy in Egypt acknowledging that &quot;corona&quot; had become one of the most common slurs at least in that country, as well as incidents against Japanese aid workers in Palestine involving the slur. In Jordan, Japanese people were chased by locals yelling &quot;corona&quot;. Outside of the Arabic-speaking world, France has also emerged as a notable country where use of the slur toward Japanese has become common, with targets of the slur ranging from Japanese study tours to Japanese restaurants and Japanese actresses working for French companies such as Louis Vuitton.

<text>Służewiec Przemysłowy, originally known as the Industrial and Storage District of Służewiec, is a neighbourhood of the city of Warsaw, Poland, located within the district of Mokotów and Ursynów, within the City Information System areas of Służewiec, western Ksawerów, and northern Wyczółki. It mostly consists of office buildings.

== Characteristics ==
=== Housing and business ===

The neighbourhood consists of residential apartments and office buildings. The neighbourhood contains one of the largest complexes of office buildings in Poland, with 83 office buildings within its boundaries in 2019. Many of them include headquarters of the branches of many multinational corporations. Among them are: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Starcom, Filmweb, IQVIA, LuxMed, Abbott Laboratories, Polska Grupa Prasowa, Ringier Axel Springer, Plus, National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, National Appeals Chamber, Panasonic, Institute of National Remembrance, Groupe Renault, AstraZeneca, DNB ASA, T-Mobile Polska, Mondelez, and Toyota Bank Polska. The embassy of Cuba is also located in the neighbourhood.

According to estimates, commutes to the area of office buildings in Służewiec and the western portion of the nearby Ksawerów average between 80 and 100 thousand employees, with 87% of employees of these corporations aged between 20 and 39 years. The largest age group (39%) is between 26 and 30 years. The huge number of people commuting to and from the area every day, together with local road systems not designed for a such number of vehicles, causes massive traffic congestion, as well as lack of parking spaces. Many potential employees cite difficulties in commuting as the main reason for turning down offers to work in the area.

In Służewiec is located Westfield Mokotów, one of the biggest shopping centres in the city.

=== Area of &quot;Mordor&quot; ===
The area of the complex of the office buildings within Służewiec and the western portion of the nearby Ksawerów is colloquially referred to as &quot;Mordor&quot;, and &quot;Mordor in Domaniewska&quot;. Its boundaries are commonly accepted to be Cybernetyki, Domaniewska, Marynarska, and Wołoska Streets.

The name was given to the area, due to terrible traffic congestion present in the area, in reference to Mordor, a fictional location, and personification of evil, from the 1954–1955 fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; written by J. R. R. Tolkien. The name had been popularized by Facebook fan page titled &quot;Mordor na Domaniewskiej&quot; (translation from Polish: &quot;Mordor in Domaniewska&quot;), established in 2013, by one of the employees from the area. In 2018, the fansite had gained 100 000 followers, and by February 2022, it has over 170 000. In the city is also published magazine &quot;Głos Mordoru&quot; (translation from Polish: &quot;The Voice of Mordor&quot;), addressed to the employees of the corporations from the area.

There were several attempts to make &quot;Mordor&quot; the officially recognized name of the area. In 2015, its supporters hung a street sign with name &quot;Mordor&quot; in the area; however, authorities quickly removed the sign. In 2018, the local inhabitants had proposed via the participatory budgeting, the recognition of the name, which was not approved. Since 2015, the name is accepted in the search of Google Maps.

On 12 December 2020, following the petition of local inhabitants, two small streets in the neighbourhood of Służewiec were named in reference to Mordor. One of them is J. R. R. Tolkiena Street, named after J. R. R. Tolkien, and which goes perpendicularly to the south from Suwak Street. The other is Gandalfa Street, named after Gandalf, one of main characters from Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and which goes perpendicularly to the north from Konstruktorska Street. Both roads meet in their middle, forming a crossing. They were originally intended to be named Pirytowa and Tytanowa Streets; however, the local council people decided to name them in reference to Tolkien, following the petitioning of the local population.

==History==
The oldest known mention of Służewiec in documentation comes from 1378. In said documents, it was listed as one of 17 villages of the landed property of Służewo. It was a village attached to the nearby village of Służewo (currently known as Służew), and was listed to have an area of 9 voloks (equivalent to 1.616 km² or 0.624 square miles), making it the biggest on the list. In 1411, the village was given the Kulm law privileges by duke Janusz I of Warsaw, ruler of the Duchy of Warsaw.

On 27 September 1938, Służew and Służewiec were incorporated into the city of Warsaw. The area had been destroyed in 1944 by Nazi Germany, during the Second World War, as part of the destruction of Warsaw.
In 1951, the area of Służewiec and Zbarż, had been designated as the industrial area of the Industrial–Storage District of Służewiec (Polish: &quot;Dzielnica Przemysłowo-Składowa „Służewiec”&quot;), later known as Służewiec Przemysłowy (&quot;Industrial Służewiec&quot;). It was planned to construct 60 factories and industrial plants in the area, as well as residential buildings for 26 thousand people. The buildings were constructed in the large panel system technique, marking it as one of the first instances of such system being used in Poland. The designated area covered around 2.6 km² (1 sq mi). The construction began in 1952. In the early 1970s, around 20 000 people worked in the industrial area. The corporations in the area were: the Tewa Semiconductors Factory (Polish: &quot;Fabryka Półprzewodników „Tewa”&quot;, Lifting Devices Factories (Polish: &quot;Zakłady Urządzeń Dźwigowych&quot;), Elwa Radio Components Factory (Polish: &quot;Fabryka Podzespołów Radiowych „Elwa”&quot;), Radio Cenamics Plants (Polish: &quot;Zakłady Ceramiki Radiowej&quot;), and Służewiec Meat-Packing Factories (Polish: &quot;Zakłady Mięsne „Służewiec”&quot;.

In the 1990s, the industrial activity in the area of Służewiec Przemysłowy and nearby western part of Ksawerów, went to a hold. As such, it had caused the appearance on the Real estate market of huge and developed estates, located near the city centre and the Warsaw Chopin Airport. It had then contributed to the development of business industry in the area, and eventually leading to the creation of the biggest complex of office buildings in Poland. One of the first of new infestations in the area was the construction of Curtis Plaza office building in 1992, located at 18 Wołoska Street. From 1995 to 2001, in the area had been built the complex of office buildings known as Mokotów Business Park, located in the area of Domaniewska and Postępu Streets. In 2000, in the area had been opened Westfield Mokotów (originally known as &quot;Galeria Mokotów&quot;), one of the biggest shopping centres in the city. By 2019, 83 office buildings had been built in the area. They were mostly built without city oversight and contributed to the development of the office monoculture. In 2019, the area began losing its status of office centre, to the district of Wola.

<text>The National Liberation Movement – Tupamaros (, MLN-T) was a Marxist–Leninist urban guerrilla group that operated in Uruguay during the 1960s and 1970s. It was responsible for numerous violent incidents involving left-wing terrorist activities. In 1989, the group was admitted into the Broad Front and a large number of its members joined the Movement of Popular Participation (MPP).

Formed in the early 1960s, the MLN-T sought to create a revolutionary state through armed struggle, taking inspiration from the 1953-59 Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro. However, unlike the latter, it conducted its operations in urban areas. The organization gained notoriety for its violent acts of sabotage, bank and armory robberies, assassinations of military and police officers, bombings, and kidnappings of judges, businessmen, diplomats and politicians.

The MLN-T is inextricably linked to its most important leader, Raúl Sendic, and his brand of Marxist politics. José Mujica, who later became President of Uruguay, was also a member. 300 Tupamaros died either in action or in prisons (mostly in 1972), according to officials of the group. About 3,000 Tupamaros were also imprisoned.

==History==

=== Background ===
Due to the reforms implemented at the beginning of the 20th century during the Batlle era, Uruguay became one of the most prosperous nations in Latin America. Since then, the country has maintained a robust welfare state, progressive social and labor laws, and a high quality of life, earning it the nickname &#x27;The Switzerland of the Americas&#x27;. Additionally, since the mid-19th century, Uruguay has experienced a massive wave of European migration, particularly from Italians and Spaniards, who significantly shaped its culture and society.

During both World Wars, the Uruguayan economy was significantly boosted by the sale of raw materials to countries involved in the conflicts. However, from the mid-1950s onward, as global demand for agricultural products declined and Europe underwent reconstruction, exports fell, leading to a severe economic crisis. The Tupamaros emerged during this period of instability, attracting professionals, workers, trade unionists, and students. Unlike other guerrilla groups formed during the Cold War, the MLN-T was primarily composed revolutionary leftist individuals from the upper-middle and upper classes.

=== Origins ===
According to one of its top members, Eleuterio Fernández Huidobro, the formal founding of the MLN-T took place in 1965; however, the organization&#x27;s first action was the theft of weapons and ammunition from the Tiro Suizo, a shooting range in Nueva Helvecia, in 1963. A year earlier, nursing student Dora Isabel López de Oricchio was shot dead during an assault on the headquarters of a union association, carried out by a group led by Raúl Sendic Antonaccio. This event is considered one of the earliest acts attributed to far-left violence.

At the outset, the organization did not operate under its name, instead operating in a more anonymous manner. In November 1964, leaflets were circulated for the first time that read . &#x27;Transamos&#x27;—the first-person plural form of the verb &#x27;transar&#x27;—is slang from the &quot;lunfardo&quot; of Uruguayan Spanish, used to mean &#x27;compromise&#x27; or &#x27;settle.&#x27; It often carries a negative connotation, implying a refusal to compromise on principles or values. The organization was named after the revolutionary Túpac Amaru II, who in 1780 led a major indigenous revolt against the Viceroyalty of Peru.

In August 1965, the organization issued a leaflet under its name for the first time, claiming responsibility for an explosion at the entrance to the Bayer company&#x27;s headquarters in Montevideo.

=== Activity ===

The movement began by staging the robbing of banks, gun clubs and other businesses in the early 1960s, then distributing stolen food and money among the poor in Montevideo. It took as its slogan, &quot;Words divide us; action unites us.&quot;

Later on as the Tupamaros grew, they helped develop the &#x27;Frente Amplio&#x27; political coalition, serving as the counterpart to their underground organization. The Frente Amplio combined leftist and centre-left views.

At the beginning, it abstained from armed actions and violence, acting not as a guerrilla group but a political movement. In June 1968, President Jorge Pacheco, trying to suppress labour unrest, enforced a state of emergency and repealed all constitutional safeguards. The government imprisoned political dissidents, used torture during interrogations, and brutally repressed demonstrations. In 1969 the Tupamaros conducted the largest robbery in Uruguayan history and occupied the city of Pando. They then began engaging in political kidnappings, &quot;armed propaganda&quot; and assassinations. Of particular note were the kidnapping of powerful bank manager and of the British ambassador to Uruguay, Geoffrey Jackson, as well as the assassination of Dan Mitrione, a U.S. FBI agent also working for the CIA (via the Agency for International Development&#x27;s Office of Public Safety), who the Tupamaros learned was advising the Uruguayan police in torture and other security work.

The Tupamaros peaked as a guerrilla group in 1970 and 1971. During this period they made liberal use of their &quot;Cárcel del Pueblo&quot; (or People&#x27;s Prison) where they held those that they kidnapped and interrogated them, before making the results of these interviews public. A number of these hostages were later ransomed for considerable sums of money, including the Brazilian Consul in Montevideo, . In September 1971 over 100 imprisoned Tupamaros escaped the Punta Carretas prison by digging a hole across their cells and then a tunnel that led from the floor of one ground-level cell to the living room of a nearby home. As a result of this, the government summoned the military to prepare a counter-insurgency campaign to suppress the MLN.

=== End ===
Nonetheless, in 1972 the group was quickly crippled by a series of events. First, it had started to engage in political violence since 1970, a choice that weakened its popular support. Second, the group responded to the assassination and/or disappearance of four Tupamaros on the part of illegal parapolice squads with a wave of high-profile assassinations that concentrated political opposition against them. Later on, the MLN directly attacked the military and killed a number of soldiers. The army&#x27;s response was swift; it included the heavy use of torture and the flipping of high-ranking Tupamaros, including Héctor Amodio Pérez, towards collaborating with them.

The Tupamaros collapsed in mid-1972, with the army killing many of them and capturing a majority of the rest. Shortly after defeating the MLN the military successively confronted the independence of the judiciary in October 1972, of the civilian executive branch in February 1973, and lastly the independence of the parliament in June 1973. On this latter occasion, it completed its coup d&#x27;état by deploying armored vehicles in the capital and shutting down the legislative branch by request of the Uruguayan President. Nine Tupamaros were specially chosen to remain in squalid conditions, including Sendic, Fernández Huidobro, José Mujica, Henry Engler, and Mauricio Rosencof. They remained there until the restoration of liberal democracy in Uruguay in 1985. During the intervening years, the military regime killed and &quot;disappeared&quot; additional numbers of people, focusing particularly on the Communist Party of Uruguay.

In 1984, a set of several 24-hour Uruguayan general strikes, eventually forced the military to accept civilian rule, with democratic elections held that year. Under Julio María Sanguinetti, the new president, amnesty was granted to the Tupamaros. The Tupamaros were released from prison after over a decade and they joined in representing the Frente Amplio coalition party. In 2004, Tabaré Vásquez was the first to become president on the &quot;Frente Amplio&quot; ticket. The ceramicist and former member, Eva Díaz Torres, returned to Uruguay during this period.

<doc id="879282" wikidata="Q3338735" url="?curid=879282" title="Neutron transport">
<text>Neutron transport (also known as neutronics) is the study of the motions and interactions of neutrons with materials. Nuclear scientists and engineers often need to know where neutrons are in an apparatus, in what direction they are going, and how quickly they are moving. It is commonly used to determine the behavior of nuclear reactor cores and experimental or industrial neutron beams. Neutron transport is a type of radiative transport.

==Background==

Neutron transport has roots in the Boltzmann equation, which was used in the 1800s to study the kinetic theory of gases. It did not receive large-scale development until the invention of chain-reacting nuclear reactors in the 1940s. As neutron distributions came under detailed scrutiny, elegant approximations and analytic solutions were found in simple geometries. However, as computational power has increased, numerical approaches to neutron transport have become prevalent. Today, with massively parallel computers, neutron transport is still under very active development in academia and research institutions throughout the world. It remains a computationally challenging problem since it depends on time and the 3 dimensions of space, and the variables of energy span several orders of magnitude (from fractions of meV to several MeV). Modern solutions use either discrete ordinates or Monte Carlo methods, or even a hybrid of both.

The neutron transport equation is a balance statement that conserves neutrons. Each term represents a gain or a loss of a neutron, and the balance, in essence, claims that neutrons gained equals neutrons lost. It is formulated as follows:
:formula_1

:formula_2

:formula_3

Where:
The transport equation can be applied to a given part of phase space (time &quot;t&quot;, energy &quot;E&quot;, location formula_4 and direction of travel formula_5) The first term represents the time rate of change of neutrons in the system. The second terms describes the movement of neutrons into or out of the volume of space of interest. The third term accounts for all neutrons that have a collision in that phase space. The first term on the right hand side is the production of neutrons in this phase space due to fission, while the second term on the right hand side is the production of neutrons in this phase space due to delayed neutron precursors (i.e., unstable nuclei which undergo neutron decay). The third term on the right hand side is in-scattering, these are neutrons that enter this area of phase space as a result of scattering interactions in another. The fourth term on the right is a generic source. The equation is usually solved to find formula_6 since that will allow for the calculation of reaction rates, which are of primary interest in shielding and dosimetry studies.

==Types of neutron transport calculations==
Several basic types of neutron transport problems exist, depending on the type of problem being solved.

===Fixed source===
A fixed source calculation involves imposing a known neutron source on a medium and determining the resulting neutron distribution throughout the problem. This type of problem is particularly useful for shielding calculations, where a designer would like to minimize the neutron dose outside of a shield while using the least amount of shielding material. For instance, a spent nuclear fuel cask requires shielding calculations to determine how much concrete and steel is needed to safely protect the truck driver who is shipping it.

===Criticality===
Fission is the process through which a nucleus splits into (typically two) smaller atoms. If fission is occurring, it is often of interest to know the asymptotic behavior of the system. A reactor is called “critical” if the chain reaction is self-sustaining and time-independent. If the system is not in equilibrium the asymptotic neutron distribution, or the fundamental mode, will grow or decay exponentially over time.

Criticality calculations are used to analyze steady-state multiplying media (multiplying media can undergo fission), such as a critical nuclear reactor. The loss terms (absorption, out-scattering, and leakage) and the source terms (in-scatter and fission) are proportional to the neutron flux, contrasting with fixed-source problems where the source is independent of the flux. In these calculations, the presumption of time invariance requires that neutron production exactly equals neutron loss.

Since this criticality can only be achieved by very fine manipulations of the geometry (typically via control rods in a reactor), it is unlikely that the modeled geometry will be truly critical. To allow some flexibility in the way models are set up, these problems are formulated as eigenvalue problems, where one parameter is artificially modified until criticality is reached. The most common formulations are the time-absorption and the multiplication eigenvalues, also known as the alpha and k eigenvalues. The alpha and k are the tunable quantities.

K-eigenvalue problems are the most common in nuclear reactor analysis. The number of neutrons produced per fission is multiplicatively modified by the dominant eigenvalue. The resulting value of this eigenvalue reflects the time dependence of the neutron density in a multiplying medium.
*&quot;keff&quot; &lt; 1, subcritical: the neutron density is decreasing as time passes;
*&quot;keff&quot; = 1, critical: the neutron density remains unchanged; and
*&quot;keff&quot; &gt; 1, supercritical: the neutron density is increasing with time.

In the case of a nuclear reactor, neutron flux and power density are proportional, hence during reactor start-up &quot;keff&quot; &gt; 1, during reactor operation &quot;keff&quot; = 1 and &quot;keff&quot; &lt; 1 at reactor shutdown.

==Computational methods==
Both fixed-source and criticality calculations can be solved using deterministic methods or stochastic methods. In deterministic methods the transport equation (or an approximation of it, such as diffusion theory) is solved as a differential equation. In stochastic methods such as Monte Carlo discrete particle histories are tracked and averaged in a random walk directed by measured interaction probabilities. Deterministic methods usually involve multi-group approaches while Monte Carlo can work with multi-group and continuous energy cross-section libraries. Multi-group calculations are usually iterative, because the group constants are calculated using flux-energy profiles, which are determined as the result of the neutron transport calculation.

===Discretization in deterministic methods===
To numerically solve the transport equation using algebraic equations on a computer, the spatial, angular, energy, and time variables must be discretized. 
* Spatial variables are typically discretized by simply breaking the geometry into many small regions on a mesh. The balance can then be solved at each mesh point using finite difference or by nodal methods. 
* Angular variables can be discretized by discrete ordinates and weighting quadrature sets (giving rise to the SN methods), or by functional expansion methods with the spherical harmonics (leading to the PN methods).
* Energy variables are typically discretized by the multi-group method, where each energy group represents one constant energy. As few as 2 groups can be sufficient for some thermal reactor problems, but fast reactor calculations may require many more. 
* The time variable is broken into discrete time steps, with time derivatives replaced with difference formulas.

<doc id="879298" wikidata="Q478249" url="?curid=879298" title="Spanish River (Ontario)">
<text>The Spanish River is a river in Algoma District, Sudbury District and Greater Sudbury in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It flows in a southerly direction from its headwaters at Spanish Lake (west branch) and Duke Lake (east branch) to its mouth at the North Channel of Lake Huron just outside the community of Spanish.

The river&#x27;s name and the name of the nearby towns of Espanola and Spanish are said to be due to French explorers and Jesuit priests encountering Ojibwe peoples speaking Spanish in the area, apparently as a result of a Spanish woman having been taken captive during an expedition far to the south.

The Spanish River is a provincially significant canoe route with lots of swifts and whitewater. It is therefore mainly used for recreational canoeing and has been protected as a waterway provincial park. There are four hydroelectric dams on the river: one, known as Big Eddy, above High Falls forming Agnew Lake; High Falls dam about a kilometre below Big Eddy dam; Nairn Falls dam about below High Falls and the other at the Domtar mill in Espanola.

==Geography==
The river is located almost entirely within the Sudbury District, except for brief passages into the city of Greater Sudbury near the communities of High Falls and Turbine and the river mouth in Algoma District.

Tributaries include Pogamasing Creek, Mogo River, Agnes River, the River aux Sables, the Vermilion River and the Wakonassin River.

The Lower Spanish River Forest houses the world&#x27;s oldest red pine and white pine forests, and much of that is under provincial protection in the form of provincial parks and reclamation acts.

==History==

The Spanish River has been used as a transportation corridor for thousands of years, initially by First Nations and later in the 19th century by fur traders. During the late 19th and mid 20th centuries, the river was used to transport timber from logging camps in the upper Sudbury District to Georgian Bay, where they were towed by tugs to sawmills on the Great Lakes. Until the mid-1960s, pulp wood, mainly jack pine, was driven down the river to the paper mill in Espanola. A diesel tug towed large rafts of logs the length of Agnew Lake to big Eddy dam where they were sluiced down a flume by crews with hand held pike poles. Secondary flumes took them past the High Falls and Nairn Falls power plants and on to Espanola. The sap and bark from the pulp logs was a major pollution source in the lower river.

In 1910, the river was the scene of a dramatic train derailment. It took place at the Canadian Pacific Railway bridge upstream from Espanola and downstream from the High Falls dam, about west of the town of Nairn.

==Fauna==
Fish species found in the Spanish River are:

*Alewife
*Black Crappie
*Bluntnose Minnow
*Bowfin
*Brown Bullhead
*Brook Stickleback
*Burbot
*Chinook Salmon
*Cisco / Lake Herring
*Coho Salmon
*Common Carp
*Fathead Minnow
*Johnny Darter
*Lake Sturgeon
*Lake Trout
*Lake Whitefish
*Largemouth Bass
*Muskellunge
*Northern Pike
*Northern Redbelly Dace
*Pink Salmon
*Pumpkinseed
*Rainbow Smelt
*Rainbow Trout
*Silver Redhorse
*Shorthead Redhorse
*Rock Bass
*Smallmouth Bass
*Spottail Shiner
*Trout-Perch
*Walleye
*White Sucker
*Yellow Perch
==Spanish River Provincial Park==
The Spanish River Provincial Park protects most of the river and its banks, from its source at Biscotasi Lake (which is separately protected in the Biscotasi Lake Provincial Park) to Agnew Lake. Also included in the park is the entire East Spanish River, Mogo River, as well as large swaths of old-growth white and red pine forest along the course of the Spanish River.

It was established in 2006 and is intended to provide recreational paddling opportunities, in particular for canoeists of intermediate skill level. The park area is also popular for fishing, hunting, and camping.

Despite its remoteness, it is an operational park requiring permits for its use. Facilities included 83 backcountry campsites. All park sites and portages are currently maintained by park staff.

==Hydroelectricity==

There are 5 hydro-electric generating stations on the Spanish River, 4 of which are owned and operated by Vale Limited to provide power to their mining operations in Sudbury.

<doc id="879303" wikidata="Q1393291" url="?curid=879303" title="So Red the Rose">
<text>So Red the Rose is the only studio album by the Duran Duran-spinoff group Arcadia, released on 18 November 1985 by Parlophone. It included the singles &quot;Election Day&quot;, &quot;The Promise&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Is Forever&quot; and &quot;The Flame&quot;. The album peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in January 1986 and at number 30 on the UK Albums Chart in December 1985.

There were many musical guests on the album, including David Gilmour of Pink Floyd, Herbie Hancock, Grace Jones, and Sting (who provided backing vocals on &quot;The Promise&quot;).

The album&#x27;s artwork featured painted ink drawings by fashion illustrator Tony Viramontes of fashion model Violeta Sanchez as well as an innovative &quot;light space&quot; photograph of the band by Dean Chamberlain, who also directed the video for the song &quot;Missing&quot;. Nick Rhodes said of the model Sanchez on the album cover, &quot;She had an elegance to her, an old style classic beauty.&quot;

==Box sets==
As part of EMI&#x27;s massive Duran Duran reissue plans, a jewel case 3 disc (2CD, 1 DVD) box set of &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; was released on 12 April 2010. It included the entire album, single mixes, the B-sides &quot;She&#x27;s Moody and Grey, She&#x27;s Mean and She&#x27;s Restless&quot; and &quot;Flame Game&quot; (Yo Homeboy mix), four versions of non-album track &quot;Say the Word&quot; (a track from the soundtrack of &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;), and an instrumental mix of &quot;The Promise&quot;. The DVD contains the original 1987 video release &quot;Arcadia&quot;.

In 2008 a previously available, more complete limited edition for Japan fan club (23-track digitally) was remastered into 6 CD single set, comprising all the singles ever released for the &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; LP, including &quot;Say the Word&quot;. The packaging is a &#x27;so red the velvet&#x27;, faithfully replicating the original single sleeve artwork, plus 8-page fold-out picture booklet of lyrics and biography.

==Encrypted messages==
Some versions of the album and related singles contained a numeric code in their artwork, this code allocated even numbers to letters, beginning with 16=A, and continuing to 52=S, and then wrapping around to 02=T up to 14=Z. 00 represents either a space or a mid-word capitalization (being used before the &quot;B&quot; in Le Bon). The numbers on the front cover of the US CD release decode to spell TAYLOR RHODES LE BON (the surnames of the three members of the group). The circular image on the back of the CD insert spells SO RED THE ROSE both forward and backward, while the three letters in the center are T R L (Taylor/Rhodes/Le Bon)

<text>Rugby Australia Ltd, previously named Australian Rugby Union Limited and Australian Rugby Football Union Limited, is an Australian company operating the premier rugby union competition in Australia and teams. It has its origins in 1949. It is a member of World Rugby. Rugby Australia has eight member unions, representing each state and the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory. It also manages national representative rugby union teams, including the Wallabies and the Wallaroos.

== History ==

Until the end of the 1940s, the New South Wales Rugby Union, as the senior rugby organisation in Australia, was responsible for administration of a national representative rugby team, including all tours. However, the various state unions agreed that the future of rugby in Australia would be better served by having a national administrative body and so the Australian Rugby Football Union was formed at a conference in Sydney in 1945, acting initially in an advisory capacity only. Additional impetus came in 1948 when the International Rugby Football Board invited Australia specifically (rather than a New South Wales representative), to take a seat on the Board.

The constitution of the Australian Rugby Football Union was ratified on 25 November 1949 at the inaugural council meeting of eleven delegates from the state unions of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. The ACT Rugby Union gained membership in 1972. The Northern Territory Rugby Union joined in 1978, initially as an associate union before later being granted membership and voting rights.

In 1985 the Australian Rugby Football Union was incorporated as a company (ACN 002 898 544). In 1997, it was renamed Australian Rugby Union Limited, known as the ARU and again renamed, in 2017, as Rugby Australia Limited.

A founding member, the New South Wales Rugby Union, lost two affiliated regional organisations in 2004 when they affiliated to the ACT Rugby Union which became the ACT and Southern NSW Rugby Union.

Rugby Australia&#x27;s major sponsor, since 2004, is Qantas. Qantas has had official naming rights for the &#x27;Qantas Wallabies&#x27;.

In 2017, the Australian Rugby Union was re-branded Rugby Australia, coinciding with relocating to their new premises in Moore Park, Sydney.

In July 2021, Rugby Australia announced plans are underway to construct an Australian Rugby Museum. It will feature items from Wallabies and Wallaroos history along with the provincial history of the sport, dating back to the late 19th century.

==Governance==
The organisation&#x27;s governing structures were overhauled in December 2012, following a review authored by the former federal senator and Minister for Sport, Mark Arbib.

===Members===
Rugby Australia&#x27;s members (shareholders) include state and territory Rugby unions, together with the owners of the Super Rugby bodies within Australia and the Rugby Union Players&#x27; Association (RUPA).

Members may exercise their voting rights at the annual general meeting. Under the current Constitution adopted in 2012, the eight existing state and territory Member Unions, RUPA and each of the current Super Rugby team licensees are entitled to vote with the exception of NSW Waratahs as it is now owned by Rugby Australia. Member Unions with more than 50,000 registered players in their region are granted an additional vote. Only the New South Wales Rugby Union and Queensland Rugby Union exceed that mark at present, so the total number of members&#x27; votes is currently 14. There are also a number of affiliated groups that do not have voting rights.

Under this revised governance system, a greater share of influence and control shifted from grass roots team and club representation through the state and territory unions to commercial team owners and the professional players association.


Note: The Australian Society of Rugby Referees, and Australian Universities Rugby Union were also previously non-voting affiliates until 2005 and 2014, respectively. New South Wales Country Rugby Union and Sydney Rugby Union were also non-voting affiliates until April 2017.

Prior to 2012, the voting franchise made no allowance for Super Rugby teams or the Players&#x27; Association. There were simply fourteen votes split as follows:
* NSW Rugby Union: 5
* Queensland Rugby Union: 3
* Other state and territory member unions: 1 each

===Board and executive===
The board must have at least six independent directors, appointed to three-year terms by a two-thirds majority vote of members, in addition to the managing director (chief executive). Up to two further directors may be appointed by ordinary resolution of the board. The board may elect one of the directors as the chair, with the position to be formally reconsidered at least every three years. Executive officers, including the chief executive, are appointed by the board of directors.
List of chairpersons from 1996 onwards:
*Daniel Herbert (2023–present)
*Hamish McLennan (2020–2023)

==Teams==
&quot;National teams&quot;
*Wallabies – the national rugby union team.
*Wallaroos – the national women&#x27;s rugby union team.

&quot;National sevens teams&quot;
*Men&#x27;s 7s – the national rugby union seven-a-side team.
*Women&#x27;s 7s - the national women&#x27;s seven-a-side rugby union team.

&quot;Other teams&quot;
*Junior Wallabies – the under-20 age graded side that competes for the World Rugby Junior Championship.
*Australian Schoolboys – a representative team of school players that has developed some of today&#x27;s current Wallabies.

&quot;Former teams&quot;
*Australia A – the former second-level national rugby union team behind the Wallabies.
*Under 21s – a former age graded side that has developed players who went on to become Wallabies.
*Under 19s – a former age graded side that has developed players who went on to become Wallabies.

==Hall of Fame==
Rugby Australia promotes and selects a Hall of Fame honouring notable former players. Each year two or three of Australia&#x27;s greats from all eras of the international game are selected by an eight-man committee to be inducted into the Wallaby Hall of Fame. Inductees are drawn from all Test teams starting with the first side in 1899. Consideration is given to a player&#x27;s on-field career but induction is not based on statistical achievement alone.

To be eligible for inclusion in the Wallaby Hall of Fame, a player must have:
* Played at least one Test for Australia
* Been retired from Rugby for at least 10 years
* Made a major contribution to the game of Rugby
* Demonstrated outstanding ability, sportsmanship, commitment, character and personal contribution to their team and the game in their era.

==Controversies==
===Israel Folau saga===
In 2018, Rugby Australia became involved in a controversy with player and Christian preacher Israel Folau over his social media posts expressing his religious views seeking to save homosexuals from hell when he called on them to &quot;repent of their sins and turn to God&quot;. On 17 May 2019, Rugby Australia terminated Folau&#x27;s player contract. On 6 June 2019, Folau launched legal proceedings with the Fair Work Commission against Rugby Australia and the Waratahs under section 772 of the Fair Work Act, which makes it unlawful to terminate employment on the basis of religion. The Australian Christian Lobby (ACL) announced on 25 June 2019 that it was donating $100,000 to Folau and was setting up a donation site for his legal costs. The campaign raised over $2 million in two days before being paused by the ACL with Folau&#x27;s consent. On 19 July 2019, the Fair Work Commission issued a certificate confirming all reasonable attempts to resolve the dispute between Folau and Rugby Australia had been unsuccessful. On 1 August 2019, Folau launched legal action in the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, against RA and NSW Rugby for unlawful termination on the basis of religion, breach of contract and restraint of trade. Folau sought an apology, compensation, penalties and the right to play rugby union again. In November 2019, Folau increased his compensation claim against Rugby Australia to $14 million, claiming that he could have been a Wallabies captain.

Folau and Rugby Australia issued a joint statement and apology on 4 December 2019 that stated no harm had been intended by either party and announced that a confidential settlement had been reached.

===Financial Crisis===
Rugby Australia&#x27;s parlous financial position following the Folau affair became apparent upon the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 when it was forced to lay off three quarters of its employees and seek agreements with players to reduce payments. The CEO, Raelene Castle was sacked and calls continued for a shake-up of the board and management.

Rugby Australia&#x27;s financial challenges continued since COVID-19 and, in 2023, the organisation made failed attempts to sell 20% of its competitions, teams and business to private equity investors. On 24 November 2023, Rugby Australia confirmed the successful conclusion of its capital raise process following the execution of an agreement with Pacific Equity Partners for a flexible and upsized $80m credit facility over a 5-year term.

===Support for Indigenous Voice===
Rugby Australia announced its support for the proposed Indigenous Voice to Parliament.

<text>The Ipswich and Rosewood line refers to the section of the Main Line to Toowoomba that has a regular suburban rail service, extending southwest from the Brisbane central business district. It is part of the Queensland Rail City network.

==History==
===Main Line===
The Main Line railway from Ipswich to Brisbane was opened in 1876, as part of an extension of the first railway line from Ipswich to Bigge&#x27;s Camp (now Grandchester) on 31 July 1865.

Originally built as single track, the section was duplicated from 1885 to 1887, indicating how quickly the traffic volume grew on the line. The Albert Bridge was built to accommodate two tracks in 1876, though only one was laid at the time.

The line west of Ipswich was duplicated to Wulkuraka in 1902 and to Grandchester (past Rosewood) in 1913.

The section from Roma Street to Corinda ( was quadruplicated in 1963, and extended to Darra (a further ) in 2011, which became the junction for the first section of the new Springfield line at that time.

The Roma Street–Darra section was the first section electrified in 1979, with the section to Ipswich electrified in 1980.

The line was electrified from Ipswich to Rosewood in 1993 while Minister for Transport was the local member.

===Branch lines===
The Brisbane Valley railway line, branching from the Main Line after Wulkuraka railway station, was opened to Lowood in 1884, Esk in 1886, and Yarraman in 1913. Passenger services operated to Toogoolawah until 1989, and freight services until closure of the line in sections in 1988 and 1993.

A line to Marburg opened in 1912, branching from the Main Line east of Rosewood railway station. It was closed in sections from 1964 to 1995, and some of it is today the Rosewood Railway Museum; the Museum Junction station is at the truncated southern end of the line before Railway Street.

A line to a coal loading balloon loop at Ebenezer was opened in 1990, junctioning from the Main Line west of Thagoona railway station.

The initial section of the Springfield railway line from Darra to Richlands was opened one week early in January 2011 to assist with transportation when the Main Line between Darra and Ipswich was closed due to severe flooding. The Richlands–Springfield section opened in 2013.

A new branch line has been proposed on an alignment extending south from Ipswich to Yamanto, then east to Ripley, and connecting with the Springfield line.

==Route and stations==
Most services originate in Ipswich and stop at all stations to Bowen Hills railway station. The typical travel time between Ipswich and Brisbane City is approximately 58 minutes (to Central). Rosewood services typically act as a shuttle between Rosewood and Ipswich stations, with selected peak direction services continuing through Ipswich. The typical travel time between Rosewood and Ipswich is 18 minutes.

During weekday peak times, a number of the Ipswich services skip stations between Darra and Milton, stopping only at Indooroopilly for faster travel times for commuters working in the Brisbane central business district.

Passengers for/from the Rosewood line change at Ipswich, Beenleigh, Gold Coast and Cleveland lines at Roma Street, and all other lines at Bowen Hills.

During times of disruption in the inner south of Brisbane, Beenleigh and Gold Coast line trains can be maintained via the Ipswich line, using the Corinda-Yeerongpilly railway line to bypass track closures between South Brisbane and Yeerongpilly.

===Former service to Corinda via South Brisbane===

The Corinda–Yeerongpilly railway line, also known as the Tennyson line, connects the Beenleigh and Ipswich lines for coal, grain and intermodal freight services to the Port of Brisbane and Acacia Ridge intermodal terminal. It was the only connection between the northern and southern portions of the Brisbane suburban network until the Merivale Bridge opened in 1978. Commuter services were defunct in 2011 due to low patronage.

<text>James Patrick Quirk (; born October 22, 1954) is an American former professional baseball player and coach. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1975 to 1992. Quirk was a member of the world champion 1985 Kansas City Royals team.

==Playing career==
Quirk was born in Whittier, California. He was a &quot;Parade&quot; All-America quarterback at St. Paul High School in Santa Fe Springs, California where, upon graduation, he was offered a four-year football scholarship to the University of Notre Dame. Quirk attended Whittier College.

Quirk played for the Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics, Cleveland Indians and Baltimore Orioles in a career that spanned the years 1975–1992.

On September 27, 1984, Quirk hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth inning for the Cleveland Indians in a game against the Minnesota Twins. It was the only plate appearance Quirk had for the Indians, and was meaningless for Cleveland, which was in sixth place in its division. But the home run was crucial for Quirk&#x27;s former team of seven years, the Kansas City Royals, which was in a tight race with the Twins for the American League West division crown. With Quirk&#x27;s home run, the Royals moved two games ahead of the Twins with three to play. The Royals clinched the division the next day. Quirk would return to the Royals in 1985 and play four more years in Kansas City.

==Coaching career==
Quirk began his coaching career with the Kansas City Royals in 1994 as the bullpen coach from 1994 to 1995, and then as bench coach from 1996 to 2001. He then became the bullpen coach for the Texas Rangers for the 2002 Season. Quirk moved on to become bench coach for the Colorado Rockies from 2003 to 2008 under manager Clint Hurdle. From 2010 to 2011, Quirk served as bullpen coach for the Houston Astros under manager Brad Mills. On November 29, 2011, Quirk became the bench coach for the Chicago Cubs to serve under newly-hired manager Dale Sveum where he served until 2013.

On September 6, , Quirk was involved in a benches-clearing incident during a game between the Cubs and the Washington Nationals. Quirk was yelling from his own dugout, apparently at Nationals third base coach Bo Porter, causing Porter to leave his position on the field and approach Quirk. Ultimately, both teams came out onto the field and Quirk was ejected by umpire Jerry Layne.

He was the manager of the Lake Elsinore Storm and the San Antonio Missions in the San Diego Padres system before he was promoted to the El Paso Chihuahuas on June 17, 2015. Quirk managed the Kansas City Royals-affiliated Wilmington Blue Rocks from 2016 to 2017.

<text>Greatest is a greatest hits album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran, released in 1998.

==Background and release==
&quot;Greatest&quot; is an update of the 1989 tenth anniversary compilation album, &quot;Decade&quot;. The new release includes songs from their eponymous debut album through 1997&#x27;s &quot;Medazzaland&quot; (excluding 1995&#x27;s &quot;Thank You&quot;). The album includes all 14 songs featured in &quot;Decade&quot;, plus &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; and four singles from the &#x27;90s. However, several songs on the disc are presented in their edited forms in order to fit on a single CD. In addition, the disc uses an edit of &quot;Rio&quot; that was not actually used on any of the song&#x27;s US single releases, and to this day, has not appeared on any release other than &quot;Greatest&quot; or &quot;The Essential Collection&quot;.

The album was released by EMI after parting ways with the band following the unsuccessful &quot;Medazzaland&quot; album release in 1997, marking the first of many releases designed to capitalise on the band&#x27;s extensive EMI-controlled back catalogue. To coincide with the release of the &quot;Greatest&quot; album in the United Kingdom, the song &quot;Electric Barbarella&quot; was released as a single in that territory. This track was originally released as a single in North America in 1997 to promote the &quot;Medazzaland&quot; album (which was never released officially in Europe until 2022).

By 2008, the collection had sold 1.3 million copies in the United States, and was certified Platinum by the RIAA. The collection is the band&#x27;s most commercially successful release overall, but to date, a full collection of Duran Duran&#x27;s singles on one album still has not been released.

==Track listing==

==Video album==
&quot;Greatest&quot; was followed in 1999 by the release of a videotape compilation of the band&#x27;s groundbreaking music videos. The video album was certified platinum by the RIAA on 29 January 2004. In November 2003, the video album was released in DVD format, titled &quot;Duran Duran: Greatest – The DVD&quot;, with hidden extra materials, including alternative versions of some of the videos and interviews of the band; however, this version is much criticised for its extensive use of Easter egg features, which make it difficult to find and play some materials. In 2005, the disc was re-issued in a &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; package, containing both the CD and the DVD minus all of the latter&#x27;s bonus material.

<doc id="879333" wikidata="Q63236" url="?curid=879333" title="Walter Bruch">
<text>Walter Bruch (2 March 1908 – 5 May 1990) was a German electrical engineer and pioneer of German television. He was the inventor of closed-circuit television. He invented the PAL colour television system at Telefunken in the early 1960s. In addition to his research activities Walter Bruch was an honorary lecturer at Technische Hochschule Hannover. He was awarded the Werner von Siemens Ring in 1975.

== Biography ==
He was born in Neustadt an der Weinstraße in the German Empire. At his father&#x27;s request he attended a business school, but then trained as a machinist apprenticeship in a shoe factory. From 1928 he attended the university of applied science &quot;Hochschule Mittweida&quot; in Saxony. After that, he was a guest student at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin), where he met Manfred von Ardenne and the Hungarian inventor Dénes von Mihály.

From the early 1930s Bruch was involved in the development of television technology: in 1933 he presented a &quot;people&#x27;s television receiver&quot; with a self-built telecine. In 1935 he started work as a technician in the Television and Physics research Department of Telefunken which was headed by Professor and where developed a special television camera for the 1936 Summer Olympics. The Summer Olympic Games of 1936 in Berlin became a milestone for audiovisual technology and Bruch was able to field test the first Iconoscope camera, developed by Emil Mechau based on a tube by . One year later, at the Paris International Exposition, he introduced an iconoscope television unit that he had designed. During World War II he operated a closed-circuit television system installed at the Peenemünde launch site, so that the V-2 rocket launches could be watched at a safe distance from a bunker.

In 1950, Telefunken commissioned him to develop the first post-war television receivers. Some time later, he returned to physics research and later colour television. He studied and thoroughly tested the American NTSC system and what would later become the French SECAM system. His work led him and co-workers like and Dr. Kruse to devise a new colour television system that automatically corrected for the differential phase distortion that can occur along the transmission channel.

On 3 January 1963, he gave the first public presentation of the Phase Alternation Line System to a group of experts from the European Broadcasting Union in Hannover. This is considered to be the date of birth of the PAL-Telefunken system, which was later adopted by more than thirty countries (at present, more than one hundred). When interviewed by German talk show host Hans Rosenthal on why he had named it the &quot;PAL system&quot;, Bruch replied that certainly no German would want to have a &quot;Bruch-System&quot; had his family name been used as the eponym; &quot;Bruch&quot; in German is synonymous with &quot;broken&quot;.

He received the David Sarnoff Medal from the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers in 1971 and the Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor from the German Eduard Rhein Foundation in 1981. He died in Hanover, aged 82.

== Awards ==

<doc id="879340" wikidata="Q4899011" url="?curid=879340" title="Betty Williams (Coronation Street)">
<text>Betty Williams (also Preston and Turpin) is a fictional character from the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, portrayed by former music hall star Betty Driver. Driver was cast as Betty in 1969, after first auditioning for the role of Hilda Ogden, which was given to Jean Alexander. The character arrived in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; to help her sister Maggie Cooke (Irene Sutcliffe) run the corner shop, and since then had a number of storylines which saw her become twice widowed, and mother to an illegitimate son.

For most of her tenure in the show, Betty worked as a barmaid in the soap&#x27;s Rovers Return Inn, where she created a signature dish, known as Betty&#x27;s hotpot.

Driver died in October 2011, and Betty was subsequently written out, with the character dying off-screen from an illness in April 2012.

==Creation==
Betty Driver, who had been performing since she was eight years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, Harry Kershaw, producer of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, who persuaded her to audition for the role of Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter &amp; Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, &quot;Harry Kershaw, producer of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just think I could have been wearing curlers for 30 years.&quot; In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin.

Following her first appearance in 1969, Driver remained in the role of Betty continuously. In a 2006 interview she laughed off the notion of retirement, saying: &quot;From day one on The Street everyone has been very kind to me. In fact, I&#x27;m godmother to Bill Roache&#x27;s son. So as long as they want me, I&#x27;m happy to stay. The Street is like home and they really are my family.&quot; She confirmed her intention to remain on the show in 2010, when the character celebrated her 90th birthday. In May 2010, the &quot;News of the World&quot; reported that Driver had decided to retire, just prior to the actress&#x27;s 90th birthday. Driver was distressed by the rumour, and assured producer Phil Collinson of her intention to remain with the soap, and was told that Betty was very much a part of plans for the series&#x27; upcoming 50th anniversary celebrations. Driver died on 15 October 2011, having appeared in over 2,800 episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

==Development==

===Backstory===
Betty was born at 6 Tile Street, Weatherfield on 4 February 1920 to Harold and Margaret Preston. During World War II, she had an affair with serviceman Ted Farrell (Gerald Sim), resulting in a son, Gordon (Bill Kenwright; Geoffrey Leesley). Ted left her to return to his family and Gordon was adopted by Betty&#x27;s sister Maggie (Irene Sutcliffe) and her husband Les Clegg (John Sharp). Betty celebrated the end of the war with her sweetheart Billy Williams (Frank Mills), to whom she had lost her virginity. The two lost touch, and in 1949, Betty married policeman Cyril Turpin (William Moore).

===Storylines===
Betty and her husband Cyril move to Weatherfield in June 1969, helping her sister Maggie to run the local corner shop following the break-up of Maggie&#x27;s marriage to Les Clegg. Maggie, however, resents Betty&#x27;s interference, and persuades landlord Jack Walker (Arthur Leslie) to give Betty a job as a barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn public house. Betty clashes with the landlady Annie Walker (Doris Speed), who fears that Jack may find her attractive, and fires Betty as a result. Betty takes a job in a rival pub, and returns only when Annie apologises. Betty becomes close friends with fellow barmaid Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), who uses Betty as a chaperone on dates, on occasion lodges with her, and frequently seeks her advice in running her life.

Cyril&#x27;s employment as a policeman causes Betty problems when Keith Lucas (David Webb), a man he has previously arrested, begins stalking her. She initially refrains from telling Cyril, fearing that he will get into trouble. When Cyril finds out, he attacks Lucas with a piece of lead piping and has to leave the police force. Betty has a breakdown when Cyril dies of a heart attack in 1974, leaving her only £859. In the same year the truth about her illegitimate son is revealed; she also acquires a ginger cat named Marmaduke for extra companionship. Betty builds a relationship with Gordon, though he upsets her occasionally, particularly when he neglects to invite her to his wedding.

Betty is mugged in 1982 by Raymond Attwood (Joe Searby) from Ken Barlow&#x27;s (William Roache) youth club; she ends up in hospital with a broken arm. This leads to a reunion with Ted, the man who fathered Gordon, though he is unaware of his son&#x27;s existence. Ted visits Betty in hospital after reading about her mugging in a newspaper. Betty agonises over whether to tell Ted about Gordon, but decides against it, preferring not to stir up the past.

On the fiftieth anniversary of VE Day in 1995, Betty is reunited with her wartime sweetheart Billy. The two marry several months later, and Gordon gives his mother away. They live happily together until Billy also dies of a heart attack in 1997. Betty becomes famous in Weatherfield for her hotpots, which come under scrutiny in the early 1990s when it is believed that they are contaminated. She is cleared of all wrongdoing when it is discovered that beer, not food, is responsible for a spate of stomach upsets. Betty acts as lady mayoress alongside mayor Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) when his wife Audrey (Sue Nicholls) has no interest in fulfilling her civic duties. This includes accompanying him to receive his OBE from the Queen, much to Audrey&#x27;s chagrin.
 In 1999, Betty celebrates 30 years of working at The Rovers Return with a party attended by all the regulars. She considers retiring in 2002 and briefly moves to Wimbledon to be with Gordon and his wife Caroline (Elaine Donnelly; Sarah Thurstan). Feeling that Caroline does not want her there, Betty considers moving into a retirement home; however, she is convinced to stay in Weatherfield by her close friend Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire). Around the time of Betty&#x27;s 40th anniversary at The Rovers Return, she is sacked by new manager Poppy Morales (Sophiya Haque) after clashing with her on several occasions. Landlord Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) eventually tires of Poppy&#x27;s poor treatment of the staff and fires her. Betty is reinstated, and plays the fairy godmother in the 2009 Rovers Return Christmas pantomime performance of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In early February 2010, Betty has a party in The Rovers Return celebrating both her 90th birthday and the fact that she is the oldest barmaid in Weatherfield; however, it backfires when 91-year-old Enid Crump (June Broughton) crashes the party and claims she is the oldest barmaid, not Betty. Later, Enid becomes sick after Steve serves her a three-month-old hotpot. Betty and Steve are left terrified when they realise that the hotpot could kill Enid, but she later recovers. During the tram crash of December 2010, Betty comforts Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth) after her husband Ashley (Steven Arnold) is tragically crushed to death by the rubble.

Betty is last seen in May 2011, trying in vain to stop David (Jack P. Shepherd) and Kylie Platt (Paula Lane) from coming behind the bar to speak with Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly). Although Betty is mentioned and referred to by various characters, her subsequent absence was not explained until February 2012, when Audrey asks Stella Price (Michelle Collins) how Betty is, to which Stella replies that Betty is &quot;still a bit under the weather&quot;.

On 16 April 2012, Emily and Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) arrange to visit a convalescing Betty and go to meet Gordon, who has agreed to drive them there. However, when Gordon does arrive, he brings with him the unexpected news that Betty has died peacefully in her sleep the night before. The residents of the street all gather in The Rovers Return and hold an impromptu memorial for Betty, with all of her old friends reminiscing about her. Gordon, with some persuasion from Emily, decides to have his mother buried in Weatherfield after initially contemplating London. It is later revealed that Annie left The Rovers Return to Betty in her will; however, Betty never acted on this. Gordon assures Stella that he is not interested in the pub and it will remain in her possession. Despite being one of the street&#x27;s longest serving characters, Betty&#x27;s funeral was held off-screen. After the wake and lock-up, Stella hangs a photo of Betty on the wall over The Rovers Return, for all to see and remember her. This photo was destroyed during a fire at The Rovers Return in March 2013 started by Karl Munro (John Michie) but, following the refurbishment, Rita managed to obtain an identical copy which remains hanging on the wall in the same place to this day.

===Personality===
In his 1998 book &quot;The Women of Coronation Street&quot;, Daran Little describes Betty as an archetypal mother figure. He compares her to one of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;″s original characters Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant), as she is &quot;warm and comforting [...] loves cats and has had her share of lodgers&quot;; however, Little notes that &quot;while Minnie wandered through life in a haze, Betty is sharp-witted, blessed with insight and wisdom&quot;. Discussing her evolving characterisation, Little writes: &quot;She hasn&#x27;t always been the incarnation of lovable joviality: when she arrived in the Street in 1969, she was loud, brash and a vicious-tongued gossip.&quot;

Betty&#x27;s two passions in life are darts and food. Playing darts brings out her competitive side, and she enjoys beating her male customers. Cyril frequently protests when Betty attempts to diet, as he prefers her &quot;homely and comfortable&quot; figure. Ultimately, Betty stops trying to lose weight, stating: &quot;I had to between losing a few pounds or losing my marital partner. If my Cyril had wanted to marry a skinny rabbit he&#x27;d have married one.&quot; Betty breaks down when Cyril dies from a heart attack, with Little noting that: &quot;Cyril had been the stabilizing force in Betty&#x27;s life, and without him she relied heavily on her job and friends at the Rovers – she couldn&#x27;t face life alone at home&quot;. Little has observed that Betty &quot;has a finely tuned sense of right and wrong and has never been afraid to stand up for her beliefs&quot;, citing Betty&#x27;s shock at being mugged in 1982, and calling the NSPCC to report a female neighbour whose children were left outside until nightfall while their mother entertained her boyfriend.

In 2010, Driver discussed her character, saying, &quot;&quot;Coronation Street&quot; characters tend to fit into one of two camps. Those who have drama after drama and those who muddle through life, often in the background, as sturdy and dependable as the famous cobbles. Betty falls into the latter group. There have been moments of drama, intrigue and even romance – but it has been her presence behind the bar, cutting up pieces of lamb and chunks of potato, that has endeared her to the viewers.&quot; When asked about Betty&#x27;s &quot;sharp tongue&quot;, Driver suggested, &quot;Not really sharp. [Betty&#x27;s] just straightforward. [She&#x27;s] not nasty to anybody but [she doesn&#x27;t] suffer fools gladly.&quot;

===Barmaid of The Rovers Return===
Betty was the longest-serving barmaid of the soap&#x27;s public house, The Rovers Return. She first served behind the bar in 1969 and had been shown to work there for 42 years, as of 2011. There have been brief breaks however, as storylines have led to the character being fired or quitting her post. She was fired by Annie Walker (Doris Speed), who accused her of theft, and she quit her post in 1995 when Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) took over as landlords. In the summer of 2009, Betty was sacked again temporarily by manager Poppy Morales. In a storyline that aired in February 2010, Betty – at 90 years old – was named Manchester&#x27;s Oldest Barmaid. In a plot twist, a 91-year-old rival comes forward, resulting in Betty fearing she killed her, when the rival consumes a two-month-old hotpot.

==Reception==
ITV described Betty as a &quot;lynchpin&quot; of the soap opera, stating that: &quot;She&#x27;s as much a part of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as the cobble stones.&quot; Former executive producer Brian Park suggested in 1997 that characters such as Betty &quot;are essential ingredients. They&#x27;re like the big clock on the mantelpiece.&quot;

The character was one of the longest-serving in British soap, coming third behind Ken Barlow and Emily Bishop in a 1998 survey assessing character episode appearances in &quot;Coronation Street&#x27;s&quot; history.

Driver was awarded a lifetime achievement award at &quot;The British Soap Awards&quot; in May 2010, to honour her role as Betty who had, at that time, featured in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for 41 years. Due to illness, Driver was unable to collect the award in person, but she recorded a video message thanking everyone at ITV.

===Betty&#x27;s hotpot===

During her time on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, the character became famous for her signature dish at the Rovers Return Inn, Betty&#x27;s hotpot. ITV have described the dish as &quot;the stuff of legends&quot;, and in 1995, pie manufacturer Holland&#x27;s Pies launched a real-life range of hotpots and pies based on the dish, called &quot;Betty&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;. The idea for the range originated with the firm&#x27;s marketing director, Dilys Day, who explained: &quot;I was brought up on hotpot and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. So when I joined Holland&#x27;s a year ago, it seemed right to put the two together with Betty&#x27;s hotpot.&quot; Day added that: &quot;We are all very excited about Betty&#x27;s Kitchen products. Holland&#x27;s is a strong northern brand, with mass market appeal and wholesome, honest values – the same can be said for The Street.&quot; Betty would often drop the letter &#x27;h&#x27; when pronouncing the word hotpot to make the dish sound more Northern.

In his book &quot;Marketing Communication&quot;, Richard J. Varey used the product range as an example of a company capitalising on a form of product placement or &quot;stealth advertising&quot;, writing that &quot;Viewers don&#x27;t realize that they are, in effect, watching an advertisement&quot;. Betty Driver said of the range&#x27;s launch: &quot;Betty Turpin&#x27;s hotpots have become something of an institution at the Rover&#x27;s and she&#x27;s very proud of her reputation for good, wholesome food. I think it is a lovely idea that people will be able to buy them in supermarkets now.&quot; Driver discussed her astonishment at the general level of interest in her character&#x27;s hotpots, disclosing: &quot;I was on a cruise on the QE2 a few weeks ago, and everyone was asking me about it. Then one day, they served hot pot on the menu and everyone thought it was mine!&quot;

In 2007, &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; editor Larry Neild was selected to join Liverpool&#x27;s &#x27;Health is Wealth&#x27; commission, researching the effects of food deprivation on poor health, after writing a scathing column in which he suggested that the commission&#x27;s chairman, Sue Woodward, chief executive of ITV Granada, should set a good example in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; by banning Betty&#x27;s hotpot. In October of the same year, allegedly the world&#x27;s biggest Lancashire hotpot was created, based on Betty&#x27;s traditional hotpot recipe from &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. The hotpot was cooked in a specially crafted 12 ft by 7 ft tin, weighing 200 kilos. 2008 saw Betty&#x27;s hotpot come under scrutiny in the soap, after Street resident Jerry Morton suffered a heart attack. Jerry&#x27;s ex-wife Teresa Bryant blamed the fatty meat in Betty&#x27;s hotpots for hardening his arteries, and local butcher Ashley Peacock suggested that ostrich meat may be an up-and-coming new alternative, much to Betty&#x27;s outrage.

==In other media==
In 1998, a straight to video, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; spin-off film was released, featuring Betty. It was entitled &quot;The Women of Coronation Street&quot; and featured clips of the show&#x27;s most famous females. The video hailed the brief return of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; favourite Hilda Ogden, who had not been seen in the soap since 1987; Betty travelled to meet her at her new home. A spokesperson for Granada Television commented, &quot;It shows what happens when Betty [Williams] goes up to visit Hilda Ogden at her home in Derbyshire. She used to do cleaning work for a doctor and when he died, he left her the house in gratitude. It&#x27;ll be a souvenir fans want to keep.&quot;

<doc id="879346" wikidata="Q16840174" url="?curid=879346" title="The Greasy Chip Butty Song">
<text>&quot;The Greasy Chip Butty Song&quot; is a football chant sung by the supporters of Sheffield United football club to the tune of &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot;, glorifying life in Sheffield, in chief the chip butty but also nightlife, beer and tobacco products. The song, with its good-natured humour, has been adopted and adapted by fans of a number of other association football teams.

==Origin==
The song was initially written in the late 1970’s by a Rotherham United fan named Terry Moran. While the song became known as the &quot;Greasy Chip Butty Song&quot;, Moran&#x27;s inspiration came from Magnet, with the mention of chip butties being an afterthought. Gavin Hancock, a Rotherham Blade, overheard Moran singing the song in a pub and wrote his own version about the Blades; Hancock&#x27;s version quickly grew in popularity among Sheffield United supporters from the early 1980’s and is now considered the club&#x27;s anthem.

==Words and music==
The song is to the tune of &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot; by John Denver to lyrics that have varied over time with changes to the opening and final two lines.

In 2010, the &quot;Sheffield Star&quot; printed a version of the lyrics with &quot;You fill up my senses... come thrill me again&quot;. In 2020, local musician Max Restaino recorded a version of the song in aid of the Sheffield Hospitals Charity. This recording also used &quot;You fill up my senses... come thrill me again&quot; lyrics.

===Meaning===
To a native of Yorkshire the words are probably self-explanatory; the words celebrate the many pleasures that can be had in Sheffield, culminating in the target of the fan&#x27;s adoration, in this instance, Sheffield United.
*&quot;Magnet&quot; refers to Magnet Bitter from John Smith&#x27;s Brewery, widely available in Yorkshire.
* &quot;Woodbines&quot; refers nostalgically to a once-popular brand of strong cigarette.
*&quot;Snuff&quot; is ground tobacco for sniffing up the nose. Wilson&#x27;s Snuff Mill, established in 1737, is located a mile away from Bramall Lane.
* A &quot;greasy chip butty&quot; can be purchased in any of the many local fish and chip shops. &quot;Butty&quot; is a dialect word for a sandwich, and a &quot;chip butty&quot; is simply a sandwich where the filling is chips, ideally greasy and sometimes sprinkled with salt and vinegar. Generally, a white sandwich bap will be used for the bread. In Sheffield, these are simply known as &quot;breadcakes&quot;.

The song itself is a plaintive rally-cry by the fans of Sheffield United. It is usually heard at the start of home games played at &#x27;Beautiful Downtown Bramall Lane&#x27; (as it is often called by the announcer on match days), the home of the club, and sporadically throughout away matches.

===Other versions===
Moran&#x27;s original version is similar save for the mentions of Sheffield (replaced respectively with &quot;Masborough&quot; and &quot;Rotherham United&quot;) and the last line, which Moran changed to &quot;Can’t fill me enough&quot;.

Modified versions of the song are also sung by supporters of Burton Albion (where the references to Magnet and Woodbines are replaced with Marston&#x27;s Pedigree (&quot;Peddi&quot;) and Walkers), Grimsby Town (where Magnet is replaced by Tetley&#x27;s) and St Helens R.F.C. (where the beer is Greenalls and a kebab replaces cigarettes).
Greenall&#x27;s is the local beer, Geno&#x27;s a popular kebab shop in town and Martine&#x27;s was a nightclub which has since closed. A &quot;Split&quot; is a local slang name for chips and peas ordered from a chippy in St Helens, as in the songs case it is also served with fish and curry. The reference to glue-sniffing is black humour based on the reputation the town gained as industry was closed down under the Thatcher government leaving less opportunities for young people and leading to St Helens being viewed as a dying town. This experience was not unique in the industrial north at the time and the reference in the song should be taken as an example of the sharp wit of Sintelliners rather than a reflection of the town itself.

==International version==
In January 2007, in tribute to Sheffield United&#x27;s visiting Chinese sister team, the Chengdu Blades, the &quot;Sheffield Star&quot; penned the following version – the Greasy Egg Noodle song.
