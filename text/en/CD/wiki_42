<doc id="886093" wikidata="Q2873354" url="?curid=886093" title="Heterozygote advantage">
<text>A heterozygote advantage describes the case in which the heterozygous genotype has a higher relative fitness than either the homozygous dominant or homozygous recessive genotype. Loci exhibiting heterozygote advantage are a small minority of loci. The specific case of heterozygote advantage due to a single locus is known as overdominance. Overdominance is a rare condition in genetics where the phenotype of the heterozygote lies outside of the phenotypical range of both homozygote parents, and heterozygous individuals have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals.

Polymorphism can be maintained by selection favoring the heterozygote, and this mechanism is used to explain the occurrence of some kinds of genetic variability. A common example is the case where the heterozygote conveys both advantages and disadvantages, while both homozygotes convey a disadvantage. A well-established case of heterozygote advantage is that of the gene involved in sickle cell anaemia.

Often, the advantages and disadvantages conveyed are rather complicated, because more than one gene may influence a given trait or morph. Major genes almost always have multiple effects (pleiotropism), which can simultaneously convey separate advantageous traits and disadvantageous traits upon the same organism. In this instance, the state of the organism&#x27;s environment will provide selection, with a net effect either favoring or working in opposition to the gene, until an environmentally determined equilibrium is reached.

Heterozygote advantage is a major underlying mechanism for heterosis, or &quot;hybrid vigor&quot;, which is the improved or increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring. Previous research, comparing measures of dominance, overdominance and epistasis (mostly in plants), found that the majority of cases of heterozygote advantage were due to complementation (or dominance), the masking of deleterious recessive alleles by wild-type alleles, as discussed in the articles Heterosis and Complementation (genetics), but there were also findings of overdominance, especially in rice. More recent research, however, has established that there is also an epigenetic contribution to heterozygote advantage, primarily as determined in plants, though also reported in mice.

== In theory ==
When two populations of any sexual organism are separated and kept isolated from each other, the frequencies of deleterious mutations in the two populations will differ over time, by genetic drift. It is highly unlikely, however, that the same deleterious mutations will be common in both populations after a long period of separation. Since loss-of-function mutations tend to be recessive (given that dominant mutations of this type generally prevent the organism from reproducing and thereby passing the gene on to the next generation), the result of any cross between the two populations will be fitter than the parent.

This article deals with the specific case of fitness overdominance, where the fitness advantage of the cross is caused by being heterozygous at one specific locus alone.

== Experimental confirmation ==
Cases of both homozygote and heterozygote advantage have been demonstrated in several organisms, including humans. The first experimental confirmation of heterozygote advantage was with &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, a fruit fly that has been a model organism for genetic research. In a classic study on the ebony mutation, Kalmus demonstrated how polymorphism can persist in a population through heterozygote advantage.

If weakness were the only effect of the mutant allele, so it conveyed only disadvantages, natural selection would weed out this version of the gene until it became extinct from the population. However, the same mutation also conveyed advantages, providing improved viability for heterozygous individuals. The heterozygote expressed none of the disadvantages of homozygotes, yet gained improved viability. The homozygote wild type was perfectly healthy, but did not possess the improved viability of the heterozygote, and was thus at a disadvantage compared to the heterozygote in survival and reproduction.

This mutation, which at first glance appeared to be harmful, conferred enough of an advantage to heterozygotes to make it beneficial, so that it remained at dynamic equilibrium in the gene pool. Kalmus introduced flies with the ebony mutation to a wild-type population. The ebony allele persisted through many generations of flies in the study, at genotype frequencies that varied from 8% to 30%. In experimental populations, the ebony allele was more prevalent and therefore advantageous when flies were raised at low, dry temperatures, but less so in warm, moist environments.

Heterozygote disadvantage occurs when &quot;a heterozygote has a lower overall fitness than either homozygote.&quot; Heterozygote disadvantage occurs in mammals, birds, and insects.

===Sickle-cell anemia===
Sickle-cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of two incompletely recessive alleles. When a sufferer&#x27;s red blood cells are exposed to low-oxygen conditions, the cells lose their healthy round shape and become sickle-shaped. This deformation of the cells can cause them to become lodged in capillaries, depriving other parts of the body of sufficient oxygen. When untreated, a person with SCA may suffer from painful periodic bouts, often causing damage to internal organs, strokes, or anemia. Typically, the disease results in premature death.

Because the genetic disorder is incompletely recessive, a person with only one SCA allele and one unaffected allele will have a &quot;mixed&quot; phenotype: The sufferer will not experience the ill effects of the disease, yet will still possess a sickle cell trait, whereby some of the red blood cells undergo benign effects of SCA, but nothing severe enough to be harmful. Those afflicted with sickle-cell trait are also known as carriers: If two carriers have a child, there is a 25% chance their child will have SCA, a 50% chance their child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance that the child will neither have SCA nor be a carrier. Were the presence of the SCA allele to confer only negative traits, its allele frequency would be expected to decrease generation after generation, until its presence were eliminated by selection and by chance.

However, convincing evidence indicates, in areas with persistent malaria outbreaks, individuals with the heterozygous state have a distinct advantage (and this is why individuals with heterozygous alleles are far more common in these areas). Those with the benign sickle trait possess a resistance to malarial infection. The pathogen that causes the disease spends part of its cycle in the red blood cells and triggers an abnormal drop in oxygen levels in the cell. In carriers, this drop is sufficient to trigger the full sickle-cell reaction, which leads to infected cells being rapidly removed from circulation and strongly limiting the infection&#x27;s progress. These individuals have a great resistance to infection and have a greater chance of surviving outbreaks. However, those with two alleles for SCA may survive malaria, but will typically die from their genetic disease unless they have access to advanced medical care. Those of the homozygous &quot;normal&quot; or wild-type case will have a greater chance of passing on their genes successfully, in that there is no chance of their offspring&#x27;s suffering from SCA; yet, they are more susceptible to dying from malarial infection before they have a chance to pass on their genes.

This resistance to infection is the main reason the SCA allele and SCA disease still exist. It is found in greatest frequency in populations where malaria was and often still is a serious problem. Approximately one in 10 African Americans is a carrier, as their recent ancestry is from malaria-stricken regions. Other populations in Africa, India, the Mediterranean and the Middle East have higher allele frequencies, as well. As effective antimalarial treatment becomes increasingly available to malaria-stricken populations, the allele frequency for SCA is expected to decrease, so long as SCA treatments are unavailable or only partially effective. If effective sickle-cell anemia treatments become available to the same degree, allele frequencies should remain at their present levels in these populations. In this context, &#x27;treatment effectiveness&#x27; refers to the reproductive fitness it grants, rather than the degree of suffering alleviation.

===Cystic fibrosis===

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive hereditary monogenic disease of the lungs, sweat glands and digestive system. The disorder is caused by the malfunction of the CFTR protein, which controls intermembrane transport of chloride ions, which is vital to maintaining equilibrium of water in the body. The malfunctioning protein causes viscous mucus to form in the lungs and intestinal tract. Before modern times, children born with CF would have a life expectancy of only a few years, but modern medicine has made it possible for these people to live into adulthood. However, even in these individuals, CF typically causes male infertility. It is the most common genetic disease among people of European descent.

The presence of a single CF mutation may influence survival of people affected by diseases involving loss of body fluid, typically due to diarrhea. The most common of these maladies is cholera, which only began killing Europeans millennia after the CF mutation frequency was already established in the population. Another such disease that CF may protect against is typhoid. Those with cholera would often die of dehydration due to intestinal water losses. A mouse model of CF was used to study resistance to cholera, and the results were published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1994 (Gabriel, et al.). The heterozygote (carrier) mouse had less secretory diarrhea than normal, noncarrier mice. Thus, it appeared for a time that resistance to cholera explained the selective advantage to being a carrier for CF and why the carrier state was so frequent.

This theory has been called into question. Hogenauer, et al. have challenged this popular theory with a human study. Prior data were based solely on mouse experiments. These authors found the heterozygote state was indistinguishable from the noncarrier state.

Another theory for the prevalence of the CF mutation is that it provides resistance to tuberculosis. Tuberculosis was responsible for 20% of all European deaths between 1600 and 1900, so even partial protection against the disease could account for the current gene frequency.

The most recent hypothesis, published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology, proposed having a single CF mutation granted respiratory advantage for early Europeans migrating north into the dusty wasteland left by the Last Glacial Maximum.

As of 2016, the selective pressure for the high gene prevalence of CF mutations is still uncertain, and may be due to an unbiased genetic drift rather than a selective advantage. Approximately one in 25 persons of European descent is a carrier of the disease, and one in 2500 to 3000 children born is affected by Cystic fibrosis.

===Triosephosphate isomerase===

Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) is a central enzyme of glycolysis, the main pathway for cells to obtain energy by metabolizing sugars. In humans, certain mutations within this enzyme, which affect the dimerisation of this protein, are causal for a rare disease, triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Other mutations, which inactivate the enzyme (= null alleles) are lethal when inherited homozygously (two defective copies of the TPI gene), but have no obvious effect in heterozygotes (one defective and one normal copy). However, the frequency of heterozygous null alleles is much higher than expected, indicating a heterozygous advantage for TPI null alleles. The reason is unknown; however, new scientific results are suggesting cells having reduced TPI activity are more resistant against oxidative stress. PlosOne, December 2006

===Resistance to hepatitis C virus infection===

There is evidence that genetic heterozygosity in humans provides increased resistance to certain viral infections. A significantly lower proportion of HLA-DRB1 heterozygosity exists among HCV-infected cases than uninfected cases. The differences were more pronounced with alleles represented as functional supertypes (P = 1.05 × 10−6) than those represented as low-resolution genotypes (P = 1.99 × 10−3). These findings constitute evidence that heterozygosity provides an advantage among carriers of different supertype HLA-DRB1 alleles against HCV infection progression to end-stage liver disease in a large-scale, long-term study population.

=== MHC heterozygosity and human scent preferences ===
Multiple studies have shown, in double-blind experiments, females prefer the scent of males who are heterozygous at all three MHC loci. The reasons proposed for these findings are speculative; however, it has been argued that heterozygosity at MHC loci results in more alleles to fight against a wider variety of diseases, possibly increasing survival rates against a wider range of infectious diseases. The latter claim has been tested in an experiment, which showed outbreeding mice to exhibit MHC heterozygosity enhanced their health and survival rates against multiple-strain infections.

===BAFF and autoimmune disease===
B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is a cytokine encoded by the TNFSF13B gene. A variant of the gene containing a deletion (GCTGT—&gt;A) renders a shorter mRNA transcript that escapes degradation by microRNA, thus increasing expression of BAFF, which consequently up-regulates the humoral immune response. This variant is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis, but heterozygote carriers of the variant have decreased susceptibility to malaria infection.

=== Cardiometabolic disease ===
Variants of the kinase-related MAP3K5 are associated with lifespan. In a study among Japanese-Americans, homozygous individuals have a longer lifespan than heterozygous individuals, indicating a homozygote advantage.

<doc id="886094" wikidata="Q1492058" url="?curid=886094" title="Galiano Island">
<text>Galiano Island (Hul&#x27;qumi&#x27;num: &quot;Swiikw&quot;) is one of the Southern Gulf Islands located between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada. Located on the west side of the Strait of Georgia, the island is bordered by Mayne Island to the southeast, Salt Spring Island to the west and Valdes Island to the northwest. Galiano is part of the Capital Regional District Electoral Area G, and has a permanent population of 1,396 inhabitants as of 2021.

Galiano takes its name from Spanish explorer Dionisio Alcalá Galiano, who explored the area in 1792.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, Galiano Island was long inhabited by Indigenous peoples from the Penelakut First Nation as well as other Coast Salish peoples. Midden pits at Montague Harbour suggest at least 3,000 years of habitation, with one study dating the earliest signs of permanent occupation in the island&#x27;s proximities to over 5000 years ago. A complex culture, heavily reliant on the native Cedar trees, flourished on the island. In the late 1770s, the smallpox epidemic reached the Coast Salish region, reducing the region&#x27;s population by as much as 30%. Subsequent outbreaks would reduce the First Nations population even further. By the time Captain Galiano arrived in the area in the late 18th century, the First Nations population had been greatly reduced.

By the 19th Century, with European colonization of North America well under way, the area around Galiano remained relatively undisturbed. However, when news of the discovery of gold on the British Columbia mainland reached San Francisco in 1858, nearby Victoria became an important port for miners on their way to the Fraser Canyon gold fields. Due to increased interest and in the area from white settlers, the Royal Navy hydrographer Captain George Henry Richards was tasked with mapping the Southern Gulf Islands in 1859, and decided to name the island in honour of the Spanish navigator who had visited the region 67 years prior.

In the early years of European settlement the island&#x27;s primary industries were fishing and logging. Poor soil on the island limited the development of widespread agriculture found on other Gulf Islands, such as nearby Salt Spring. Early settlement included a pioneer farming community on the shores of “Plumper Pass” (later renamed Active Pass). Other settlers, such as Scotty Georgeson (a Shetland Islander), also held land and had family on Galiano in this period.

Beginning in the 1870s a small number of Asian immigrants, particularly Japanese, also decided to settle the area for its abundance of fish stock and timber. These Japanese immigrants, primarily from Wakayama Prefecture, brought with them methods of charcoal production, whose evidence can still be found on the island today. Many of these Japanese settlers continued to operate salteries on the north end of the island until the outbreak of war with Japan.

Following confederation of British Columbia into Canada in 1871 and the subsequent the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, the nearby Lower Mainland exploded in population. By 1928 this had spilled over, and the small community on Galiano had grown large enough to construct the Galiano Community hall, which is still in use today. In the 1960s logging rights for much of the island were given to MacMillan Bloedel for resource extraction. Many environmentally conscious residents objected to the widespread logging, leading to many disputes including &quot;MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Galiano Island Trust Committee&quot; in 1995. Environmentalism and the 1960s counter-culture continue to heavily influence the culture of the island to this day. In 2011, the riding of Saanich—Gulf Islands, to which Galiano is a part, elected Canada&#x27;s first Green member of parliament, Elizabeth May.

As of the 21st century, the logging industry has all but halted on the island, replaced by industries such as tourism and a local art scene.

== Geography ==
Located on the western edge of the Salish Sea, Galiano is a long, narrow island, in length and at its narrowest point.

Mount Galiano is Galiano&#x27;s highest point, rising above sea level. The summit provides hikers with views over the Gulf Islands, the United States San Juan Islands and the distant mainland mountains as well. Just west of Mount Galiano is Sutil Mountain, an Ecological Reserve above sea level, named after Captain Galiano&#x27;s flagship.

The western coast of the island (facing Trincomali Channel) is characterized by its unique sandstone formations and caves.

The northern end of the island is home to Porlier Pass, dividing Galiano and Valdez Island. One of the more dangerous passes in the Gulf Islands, currents can reach up to 10 knots at maximum flood, and many whirlpools and overfalls are known to form.

===Climate===

The climate of Galiano Island is classified as warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) under the Köppen climate classification system, characterized by cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Similar to the other Gulf Islands, the rain shadow effect of the Olympic and Vancouver Island mountains, and the moderating effects of the ocean, are the dominant influences on the climate of Galiano Island. Galiano Island experiences an annual moisture deficit from mid-June to early October due to the combined effects of seasonal dry, sunny and warm weather. This deficit can often reach drought conditions in areas of recent clearcuts and can result in an extreme forest fire hazard in the summer months.

==Ecology==
Due to its mild climate and position in a confluence between two different tidal systems, Galiano Island is home to a large variety of fauna and flora, which have been heavily sampled by science. In a 2022 article published as the first volume in a 5-part overview of the island&#x27;s biodiversity, researchers reported &quot;over 4000 taxa recorded to date, including avian, freshwater, marine and terrestrial species&quot;.

In a major flight path for migrating birds, Galiano has hundreds of bird species, such as bald eagles, herons and cormorants. Off its shores are resident and transient populations of orca whales, seals, otters, and sea lions, as well as many other varieties of sea life, including at least 214 species of molluscs, 86 species of crustaceans, 82 species of ray-finned or cartilagenous fish, 41 species of echinoderms, 40 species of sea sponges, 77 species of cnidarians, six species of ribbon worms and four species of ctenophores. The island is also home to a large population of deer.

Of the 19 reef complexes mapped throughout the Salish Sea, the waters off Galiano Island are home to one of the most extensive ones, with large populations of cloud sponges and &quot;Heterochone calyx&quot; being recorded, as well as a high diversity of marine animal species.

Many native tree species such as arbutus trees, western red cedar and Coast Douglas-fir thrive on the island and can be found in abundance. While most of the island has been logged in the years since European settlement, limited old-growth forests still exist, for example on the southern side of Bluffs Park.

==Transportation==

Galiano Island is accessible by vehicle via the BC Ferries terminal at Sturdies Bay, located on Active Pass. Vehicle and passenger ferry service runs from Tsawwassen (Vancouver) on the mainland and Swartz Bay (Victoria) on Vancouver Island most days of the year. Additionally, there are numerous inter-island ferries that connect the Gulf Islands, which are scheduled less frequently.

Moorage is available at several public wharves for boat traffic: Sturdies Bay, (walking distance to the village), Montague Harbour, Whalers Bay, Retreat Cove, and Spanish Hills. Private moorage is available at Montague Harbour Marina and the Galiano Oceanfront Inn (Sturdies Bay). Limited water taxi service to nearby islands like Salt Spring is also available out of Sturdies Bay and Montague Harbour. In the summer, a foot passenger ferry service called Aqualink, takes people from Galiano&#x27;s Sturdies Bay (beside the Village) dock to Saltspring island for the Saturday Market in Ganges. 

Daily, regularly scheduled floatplane service is offered from the Vancouver International Water Airport through Seair Seaplanes to Montague Harbour. There is charter service floatplane service from Seattle through Kenmore Air, either through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Kenmore Air Harbor and Seattle Lake Union.

Once on the island, most areas can be accessed by paved road, however some logging roads remain in use in the less traveled sections of the island.

== Parks ==
Galiano is home to many popular public parks like Montague Harbour and Dionisio as well as privately owned parks such as Tapovan Peace Park.


*Montague Harbour Marine Provincial Park is one of the most popular parks in the Gulf Islands. Its Shell Beach is a west-facing beach with worn shells covering the whole expanse of the beach instead of sand. For thousands of years, it was the location of a midden used by Coast Salish people. Montague Harbour is popular with the recreational boating community; the harbour is often crowded with yachts and sailboats during the warmer months of June, July, and August. The park&#x27;s mooring buoys are in limited supply and cannot be reserved, but the harbour is well sheltered if one chooses to anchor. A marina with moorage, gas dock, several small stores, and a restaurant (summer only) is located at the southern end of the harbour. A public dock is near the marina.
*Dionisio Point Provincial Park is a marine access only, rugged natural park at the north end of the island with beaches that the local islanders call Coon Bay. It has a shoreline with sandstone formations, a sandy beach for swimming, tidal pools, colourful wildflowers, and forests.
*Bellhouse Provincial Park is notable for spring wildflowers and its views of marine life and snow-capped mountains.
*Bluffs Park is Galiano&#x27;s oldest wilderness park, established by community subscription in 1948. With , it extends far inland into virgin forest, as well having high cliffs and a long sandy beach. It inspired Caroline Shaw to compose &quot;The Evergreen&quot;, “One day in January 2020, I took a walk in an evergreen forest on Swiikw (Galiano Island), British Columbia, Canada. I found myself slowing down. My steps were shorter, less frequent. I stopped trying to get to my destination with any real intention or speed. Eventually I stopped moving altogether. I looked, and listened, and felt and smelled and breathed. Like a thousand thousand creatures before me there, some of them also human, I paused and wondered and thought, &quot;There is wisdom in these trees.&quot; It&#x27;s been said before, in ways more eloquent and complex than my little story here. Still.”
*Mount Galiano is Galiano&#x27;s highest point. It rises above sea level. The top provides hikers with views over the Gulf Islands, the U.S. San Juan Islands, and the distant mainland mountains.
*Mount Sutil, in the southeastern part of the island, is an Ecological Reserve above sea level, named after Captain Galiano&#x27;s flagship.
*Collinson Point Provincial Park is the shoreline of Mount Galiano, and is important in protecting the marine life of the approaches to Active Pass.
*Bodega Ridge Provincial Park consists of a ridge that rises over above sea level, with views over many of the Gulf Islands&#x27; hundreds of islands and islets and beyond to the mountains of the Olympic Peninsula. High cliffs are home to raptors like peregrine falcons and bald eagles, as well as trees like cedars and Douglas fir.
*Tapovan, Sri Chinmoy Peace Park is a 200-acre privately owned park, opened in 2013, honouring Sri Chinmoy (1931-2007). It features many hiking trails named by the word &quot;peace&quot;, each in a different language, and a stairway ascending the high cliff.
*Matthews Point Park is a Capital Regional District Park that preserves over a kilometre of waterfront on Active Pass, of which 300 metres are broad sandy beach. It was named after a pioneer family whose descendants in England later contributed towards the Park purchase. There is also a hiking loop along the clifftops. It adjoins and is connected to Bluffs Park.
*The Trincomali Nature Sanctuary is an area of sheer cliffs that has been set aside by the Islands Trust for the preservation of Double-crested cormorants and Peregrine Falcons, among other species.

==Government==
Government bodies that oversee the island include Federal, Provincial and the Capital Regional District as well as the Islands Trust whose mandate is to establish land-use bylaws to &quot;preserve and protect&quot; the island, most notably in terms of development. For most of the 20th century roughly half of the land on Galiano was owned by the logging firm MacMillan Bloedel. As a result, Galiano was not as extensively developed as neighbouring islands. When the firm sold its holdings on Galiano, debate about development issues sharpened, and the Islands Trust set minimum lot sizes to limit development.

Local elections are held every three years to determine who will be the island&#x27;s two Trustees.

There is one Indian reserve on the island, Galiano Indian Reserve No. 9, located at the northern tip of the island operating under Penelakut administration.

== Tourism ==
Due to the minimal development of Galiano, tourism on the island has remained limited and sustainable. There are two proper hotels and several cabin resorts, as well as cottage rentals, or camping at one of two parks, the Montague and Dionisio (water access only) Provincial Park Campsites. Known as the &quot;Foodie Island&quot;, there are many restaurants to choose from year-round. Activities on Galiano Island include hiking, boating, spa treatments, kayaking, visiting art galleries, golfing, exploring beaches, watching Orca whales from shore, as well as frequent musical events and island festivals. Information can be found at the Galiano Chamber of Commerce website www.galianoisland.com. 

==Infrastructure==
The powerline HVDC Vancouver Island crosses Galiano Island in a southwesterly direction as overhead powerline section, which ends at a cable terminal on Parker Island.

<doc id="886099" wikidata="Q7986262" url="?curid=886099" title="West Point Light">
<text>The West Point Light, also known as the Discovery Park Lighthouse, is an active aid to navigation on Seattle, Washington&#x27;s West Point, which juts into Puget Sound and marks the northern extent of Elliott Bay. The lighthouse is similar in design to the Point No Point Light and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It is a main feature of Seattle&#x27;s Discovery Park.

==History==
The lighthouse began operation on November 15, 1881, using a fourth-order Fresnel lens. It was the first manned light station on Puget Sound, built at a cost of $25,000 ($ in today dollars). It was illuminated with a kerosene lamp for its first 44 years, until it was attached to Seattle&#x27;s electric grid in 1926. It became automated in 1985, the last station in Washington to do so.

Under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000, in early 2003, Seattle&#x27;s Department of Parks and Recreation applied to the United States Department of the Interior to take custody of the lighthouse from the U.S. Coast Guard and incorporate it into Discovery Park. The city was granted the property in October 2004.

Included in the transfer of the property was the station&#x27;s original 4th order Fresnel Lens. Upon signing over of the deed, the Coast Guard extinguished the original lighting system and replaced it with a modern Vega Rotating Beacon (VRB-25). The light retains its original characteristic of alternating red and white flashes every five seconds.

A $600,000 restoration project, undertaken in 2009, saw exterior work completed in 2010, and restoration of the keeper&#x27;s quarters finished in 2011.

==Location, access, and controversy==
West Point Light is adjacent to the West Point Treatment Plant and public access. The lighthouse and beach area are under the Master Plan for Discovery Park; it was recommended that:

There will be great pressures to open up the park to automobiles, motorcycles and motor bikes. One of the greatest values of the park is, however, that it will afford the people a refuge from the noise, air pollution and danger of the automobile. We believe, therefore, that park patrons should not be permitted to drive their private vehicles through the park.

Under current rules, visitors may access the beach on foot by a number of trails, except for people with children under 8, people over 62, and people with physical problems that prevent them from walking long distances. (The lighthouse is located about 1.5 miles from Discovery Park parking lots or from the park&#x27;s Visitors Center.) Nevertheless, because of the extraordinary beauty of the lighthouse and the rocks and ocean surrounding it, many people drive to the area for picnics, photography, and recreation. Parking spaces exist and are marked, but visitors who wish to park must obtain a permit from the Discovery Park Visitor Center. To ensure parking spaces for permitted visitors and access for emergency vehicles, cars may be ticketed by Seattle Police and towed if they are parked without a permit. King County Wastewater Treatment Division and City of Seattle Parks report problems with excess unpermitted parking that results in access problems for emergency vehicles and into the treatment plant. Emergency resources have been needed to respond to beach fires, illegal fireworks, and gunfire in the beach area. County and City resources have been used to remove abandoned vehicles and graffiti on the beach and on historic buildings and treatment plant walls.

In 2013, King County and Seattle Parks presented the public with a plan to install a security gate that would prevent unauthorized vehicle access. Over half of people providing comment to the County supported this proposal, but others suggested that other options should be explored first. During Summer 2014, King County and Seattle Parks installed improved parking permit signage, additional educational signage to help visitors understand the intent of the Master Plan, measured vehicle traffic to the beach, and scheduled enforcement presence at various times of the day. The results of this evaluation will be presented to the public in November 2014.

A strict parking and towing policy was announced in 2015.

<text>The Prussian three-class franchise (German: ) was an indirect electoral system used from 1848 until 1918 in the Kingdom of Prussia and for shorter periods in other German states. Voters were grouped by district into three classes, with the total tax payments in each class equal. Those who paid the most in taxes formed the first class, followed by the next highest in the second, with those who paid the least in the third. Voters in each class separately elected one third of the electors who in turn voted for the representatives. Voting was not secret. The franchise was a form of apportionment by economic class rather than geographic area or population.

Members of the Prussian House of Representatives were elected according to the three-class electoral law, as were the city councils of Prussian cities and towns in accordance with the Prussian Municipal Code. After decades of controversy and failed attempts at reform, which for many caused the Prussian three-class franchise to become a hated symbol of Prussia&#x27;s democratic shortfalls, it was finally abolished early in the German Revolution of 1918–1919 that broke out following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I.

Even though there were considerable differences between districts in the tax levels at which the cutoffs between classes were made, the system tended to favor conservatives and rural areas over left liberals and cities. Voter turnout was also significantly lower under three-class voting than it was in elections for the German Reichstag, which did not use the system. Despite the diminished weight of many votes, the three class franchise did have the advantage of allowing all males to vote, which many contemporaneous electoral systems in other German states and European countries did not do.

== Legal basis ==

The legal basis for the three-class electoral system was the &quot;Ordinance on Conducting the Election of Deputies to the Second Chamber&quot; of 30 May 1849 and the &quot;Regulations on Conducting Elections to the House of Deputies&quot;, which was issued for the implementation of the 30 May ordinance and then repeatedly amended. The three-class electoral system was made part of the revised Prussian constitution of 31 January 1850 (paragraph 71).

With only one paragraph added to it before 1918, the ordinance remained fundamentally unchanged for the duration of its use. It was, however, partially invalidated several times or replaced by new regulations. In 1860 the electoral districts and polling places were set by law. In 1891 and 1893 the formation of electoral classes was reformed, and in 1906 some minor changes were introduced to streamline the electoral process. 

== Election procedures ==

=== Eligibility to vote ===
Every Prussian male who had reached the age of 25 and had lived in a Prussian municipality for at least six months was eligible to vote. He could not have lost his civil rights through a legal judgment or be receiving public assistance for the poor. Under paragraph 49 of the Reich Military Act of 1874 (), active military personnel, with the exception of military officers, were excluded from the right to vote both in the federal states and for the Reichstag.

=== The three classes ===
Those eligible to vote were divided into three classes based on the revenue from direct state taxes (class tax or classified income tax, property tax and business tax).

Within each district, the eligible voters who paid the most taxes fell into the first class. The top taxpaying eligible voters were assigned to this class until one third of the total tax revenue was reached. Then those who paid the most taxes among the remaining eligible voters were put into the second class until one-third of the total tax revenue was again reached. All remaining eligible voters – who also contributed one-third of total taxes – formed the third class.

If the tax paid by a voter placed him partially in the first and partially the second class, he was allocated to the first. The tax amount of the first class would then exceed one third of the total taxes, with the result that the amount attributable to the second and third classes was recalculated by dividing the remaining amount equally between those two classes.

Eligible voters elected from 3 to 6 electors in their primary district. Each district provided one elector for each 250 inhabitants according to the latest census. A primary electoral district thus had a minimum of 750 and a maximum of 1,749 inhabitants.

In municipalities with several primary election districts it was possible that after the class allocation procedure there were no eligible voters at all in the first or even in the first and second classes. In such cases, the allocation was carried out again at the level of the individual electoral district. In 1908, in 2,214 of 29,028 primary election districts, the first class consisted of only one person. In 1888, in 2,283 of 22,749 primary election districts there was only one eligible voter in class one; in another 1,764 there were two eligible voters, and in 96 primary election districts there was also only one eligible voter in the second class.

In 1891 and 1893 the allocation of eligible voters into classes was restructured as a result of the far-reaching tax reforms introduced under Prussian Finance Minister Johannes von Miquel. Land, building and businesses taxes became municipal rather than state taxes. A progressive income tax replaced the class tax and the classified income tax; in addition, a supplementary tax (wealth tax) was introduced as a direct state tax.

The progressive income tax rates and supplementary tax placed a heavier burden on wealthy citizens, with the result that even fewer men would have been allocated to the first and second classes. To prevent this, an amount of three marks was applied to each voter who did not pay income tax. Voters who paid no other direct tax beyond the fictitious three marks always fell into the third class. Direct municipal taxes were henceforth also taken into account along with direct state taxes when calculating classes.

Where no municipal taxes were levied, the taxes that would have been due under previous law continued to be taken into account as a fictitious amount. This was a de facto protection clause for landlords in municipality-free manor districts. There were no municipal taxes since landowners would have paid them to themselves. Until then, landowners paid a considerable amount of tax on land but often little on income. Without the credit of notional municipal taxes, some landowners could have slipped into the second class.

Another significant change for cities in 1891 was that the division into classes was always carried out at the level of the primary election district. Until then, in municipalities divided into several primary election districts, the required tax amount for the first or second class was the same in all primary election districts (unless a class had remained unoccupied in this way). That changed in 1891, in some cases drastically. In 1888, for example, 494 marks were required for the first class in Cologne in all primary election districts. If the division into thirds had been carried out under the new rules at the level of the original election districts, the amount would have varied between 18 and 24,896 marks. After the change, the amount required in 1893 for the first class in Berlin varied between twelve marks in the poorest original electoral district and 27,000 marks in Voßstrasse (where the Reich Chancellery was located). The change made it both easier for many urban citizens with low and middle incomes to move up to the second or even first class and for wealthy citizens in rich primary election districts to slip into the third class; Reich Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow had to vote in the third class in 1903.

The share of voters in the classes fluctuated over time and also regionally. Nationwide, the third class accounted for about 80 to 85 percent of eligible voters, and the first class for about 4%. In 1913, the third class accounted for 79.8% of eligible voters (down from 85.3% in 1898), the second class for 15.8% (up from 11.4% in 1898), and the first class for 4.4% (up from 3.3% in 1898).

In 1913 there were 190,444 primary electoral votes statewide in the first class and 1,990,262 in the third class. Since both classes elected the same number of electors, the votes of first class primary voters had a weight 10.45 times greater than those of third class voters.

=== Election of electors (primary election) ===
Choosing electors took place in a meeting of the primary voters on a day that was uniform throughout the state. The election was held separately by classes. If there was a total of three electors to be chosen, each class elected one; if there were six, each elected two. If there were four electors to be chosen, the first and third classes each elected one and the second class two; if there were 5 electors to be chosen, the first and third classes each elected two and the second class elected only one. An elector had to be eligible to vote in the primary election district but did not have to be a member of the class in which he was elected.

The third class voted first, the first last. Voting was not secret. When voting was completed in a class, its voters, unless they were members of the electoral board, had to leave the polling station. The voters of the first class could observe the voting behavior of all voters, those of the second could observe the third, while the voters of the third class did not know how the higher classes voted.

Voters were called one after the other in descending order of their tax payments. The voter named one or two candidates depending on the number of electors to be chosen in the class. An absolute majority of those voting was required for election. If an absolute majority was not achieved, those men not yet elected who had the most votes were placed on a runoff ballot, twice as many of them as there were electors still to be elected. In most cases the electors won by a large majority.

Those men elected had to declare their acceptance or rejection of the election immediately, if present, otherwise within three days, including election day. If an elector who was not present rejected the results, a by-election was held a few days later.

In 1906, in cities with a population of 50,000 or more, the electoral assembly was replaced by the time-limit voting that is now common practice, allowing voters to cast their ballots within a specified period of time.
=== Electoral districts (constituencies) ===
The electors of a constituency gathered on a uniform national day at a polling place in their constituency, established by law in 1860, to elect members of parliament. Usually there were several hundred electors in a constituency, in some cases well over 1,000. One to three deputies were elected in each constituency, although before 1860 there were constituencies with more. In 1860, 176 electoral districts were established by law. The electoral districts always comprised one or more entire city or county districts; only Berlin was divided into several electoral districts.

Apart from minor shifts in district boundaries, there was only one change to these constituencies before a law of 1906 that was effective with the 1908 election. Under its terms, several constituencies with particularly large population growth were divided into smaller constituencies and a total of 10 additional seats were allocated to these areas (Greater Berlin 5, Ruhr 4, and Upper Silesia 1). Otherwise, the only changes in constituency division were additional constituencies for areas annexed to Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 (Hanover, Hesse-Nassau, and Schleswig-Holstein in 1867, and Lauenburg in 1876). In the long term, a trend toward more single-member constituencies can be observed:

The classes, which were only minimally adjusted for population changes, further favored the conservatives, since their deputies came mainly from eastern and rural parts of the country with low population growth.

=== Election of deputies ===
Unlike in the primary elections, the classes played no role in the election of deputies. If several deputies were to be elected, a separate vote was held for each seat. An absolute majority of votes was required for election. If this was not achieved, a runoff took place. Until 1903 all candidates who received more than one vote on the first ballot were allowed to participate in the second ballot. In each subsequent ballot, the candidate with the fewest votes was eliminated. If there was a tie between the two remaining candidates, the decision was made by drawing lots. Beginning in 1903, a runoff election of the two candidates with the most votes was held immediately, as in the primary elections. If two candidates each received exactly half of the votes on the first ballot, the decision was made by lot from 1906 onward; until then, a runoff also took place in such a case. In order to streamline the rather time-consuming election of deputies, from 1903 the electors cast their votes at one time if more than one deputy was to be elected, i.e. they had to indicate who they wanted to vote for the first, second and, if applicable, third seat. More than 90% of the deputies were elected on the first ballot.

== Effects ==
The electoral procedure combined with the use of classes in the constituencies strongly favored conservatives. In 1913 the German Conservative Party received 14.8% of the primary electorate votes but won 149 of the 443 seats (33.6%) in the Prussian House of Representatives; the Free Conservative Party won 53 seats (12%) with only 2% of the primary electorate votes. The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) on the other hand won only 10 seats (2.3%) in 1913 with 28.4% of the voters. Measured in terms of share of the vote, the Centre Party, National Liberal Party and parties of the liberal left tended to be favored by the electoral law, although by no means to the same extent as the conservatives. Voting by party was recorded statistically in elections only from 1898 onward and was determined by the electoral officer entering the presumed political orientation of each person who received a vote in the primary election. Because of this, vote shares are only approximations. It should also be noted that the discrepancy between vote shares and mandate shares among the Conservatives and Free Conservatives resulted not only from the electoral law itself, but also from the fact that voter turnout was usually particularly low in their strongholds.

Compared to the voting rights for the German Reichstag, those for the Prussian House of Representatives were especially favorable for the Conservatives, Free Conservatives and National Liberals. It was disadvantageous for Poles (the Polish National Democratic Party represented the Polish minority in Germany) and especially the SPD. In 1903 the SPD won 32 of the 236 Prussian seats in the Reichstag, but in the same year none of the 433 seats in the election to the Prussian House of Representatives.

Voter turnout in all three classes was far below that in Reichstag elections. In 1913 it was 32.7% (in 1898 only 18.4%), whereas in the 1912 Reichstag election Prussian turnout was 84.5%. The possible reasons are many: the election was always held on a weekday and, unlike in a Reichstag election, voting could take several hours. In the countryside a long trek to a neighboring municipality may have been necessary, whereas in Reichstag elections there was always at least one polling station in each municipality. The lack of secrecy in voting and thus possible negative consequences from casting a vote could also deter eligible voters. For voters in the third class, the relatively low importance of their votes could also have played a role. In many cases, the importance of the primary election was also diminished by the fact that the primary constituency or the entire constituency was politically without controversy and the winner already all but determined before the voting. Voter turnout was particularly low in the third class, where it was only 29.9% statewide in 1913, compared to 41.9% in the second class and 51.4% in the first class. Voter turnout was particularly high in areas with a large Polish population and in Berlin, while in the rest of Prussia the already low average figure was in some cases considerably undercut. Turnout was higher in cities than in rural areas. The historian Thomas Kühne, a specialist in the three-class electoral system, speaks of the &quot;economy of abstention&quot;. Voters, he said, did not stay away from the polls in protest against the restrictive electoral law, but because they could agree in advance who would vote – and it was sufficient if only a few cast ballots.
Since tax revenues in Prussia varied greatly from region to region, the cutoffs for voting in the first or second class also varied considerably from province to province and even between the various electoral districts of a larger municipality. In the Prussian state election of 1898, an average of 1,361 marks had to be paid in direct taxes in the city and only 343 marks in the countryside to qualify to vote in the first class. The average tax paid by a Berlin voter in the second class in the 1898 state election was 445 marks, while that of a corresponding voter in the Province of Hohenzollern, a part of Prussia in far southern Germany, was 24 marks. The differences were even more pronounced when comparing different primary election districts. In 29 particularly high-tax Berlin electoral districts, voters were classed in the third class up to a tax revenue of 3,000 marks per year, while in four low-tax districts, a tax revenue of 100 marks per year was sufficient to qualify for the first class. In some cases, even high-ranking Prussian state officials had to vote in the third class. Of ten Prussian state ministers, six, including Prussian Prime Minister Botho zu Eulenburg and Reich Chancellor and Prussian Minister Leo von Caprivi, voted in the third class in the Prussian state election of 1893. Three other ministers voted in the second class while the tenth minister, the Minister of War, was ineligible to vote as an active military man.
== Reform efforts and abolition ==
While conservative forces rejected changes to Prussia&#x27;s three-class system, left-wing liberals and especially the SPD regularly demanded that the national Reichstag&#x27;s voting requirements be adopted by Prussia. Especially by the turn of the century, the Prussian electoral law had come to be considered outdated and was criticized from all sides. Not only Social Democrats took to the streets against the electoral law, but progressive citizens also opposed it in petitions. The National Liberals, for example, called for plural suffrage, under which certain people may vote more than once, on the model of Belgium and Saxony. In addition, the National Liberals along with the Centre Party asked for direct suffrage and a redrawing of constituencies to reflect population changes.

In 1910 the government of Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, who was German Chancellor and Minister President of Prussia, introduced a bill to reform the three-class electoral system, but the reform of the universally unpopular electoral law failed to pass into law because the left uncompromisingly demanded its replacement by the Reichstag electoral law. That went too far for both the more centrist liberal and the conservative forces, which were fully willing to see reform. They called for plural suffrage, which was favored by intellectuals such as John Stuart Mill and Otto Hintze.

Immediately after the fighting in World War I ended and the German Revolution of 1918–1919 had brought down the Hohenzollern monarchy, the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies, Germany&#x27;s interim governing body, on 12 November 1918 proclaimed universal democratic suffrage. This abolished the three-class franchise in Prussia and simultaneously introduced women&#x27;s suffrage throughout Germany.

== Historical assessment ==
In recent times, the Prussian three-class franchise has received a more lenient assessment than in previous decades. It has, for example, been noted that both John Stuart Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville viewed the system favorably. When it was introduced, three-class suffrage was considered somewhat on the progressive side because its rolls were based not on land ownership but on taxes and because it was &quot;universal,&quot; that is, because in principle every male was allowed to vote. For that reason it was strongly condemned by conservatives. A general, equal, secret, and direct suffrage for men, such as applied to elections to the Reichstag, was in 1914 enjoyed by only two of the 25 federal states, Baden and Württemberg, and by the imperial territory Alsace-Lorraine, which Germany had taken from France in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. In other countries such as Great Britain, Sweden, or the Netherlands, many men were not allowed to vote until World War I due to e.g. property requirements, while in Prussia every adult male had a vote even if for most it was lightly weighted. Universal male suffrage existed outside Germany only in Switzerland and France before the turn of the century. In Sweden, for example, only 8.2 percent of the total population was allowed to vote around 1900.

Prussian electoral law was less democratic than in most other German states because of the lack of secrecy. In all other states except Waldeck, elections were considered secret after Bavaria introduced secret ballots in 1881, Braunschweig in 1899, Hesse in 1911 and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen in 1912. The secret ballot, however, often existed only on paper.

Indirect voting, on the other hand, was quite common in Europe at the time. It had been replaced by direct voting in most other German states by 1914.

In Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz, there was no elected parliamentary chamber before 1918. In Hamburg and, until 1905, in Lübeck, a tax census (payment of a certain amount of tax as a prerequisite for the right to vote) applied. In Bavaria, Saxony, Hesse, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Lippe and Lübeck, the payment of direct taxes was a prerequisite for the right to vote; in Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and Reuss-Greiz, payment of direct taxes and one&#x27;s own household were required.

In addition to Prussia, a three-class electoral law applied in Braunschweig, Lippe, Saxony (only 1896–1909), Saxe-Altenburg and Waldeck. In Lübeck there was a two-class electoral system, with the first class electing 105 representatives and the second only 15. Prussia, Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden, Hesse, and from 1911 Alsace-Lorraine had a parliament with two chambers; one of which was not filled by popular election. In most states with only one chamber of parliament, some of the deputies were either appointed by the sovereign or elected by certain groups (such as those most highly taxed, large landowners or academics). In Bremen (with an eight-class franchise) only 68 of the 150 seats were chosen by general suffrage; in Hamburg, 80 of 160; in Braunschweig, 30 of 48.

<text>Hikmat Sulayman (1889 – 16 June 1964) () was Prime Minister of Iraq from October 30, 1936 to August 12, 1937 at the head of a Party of National Brotherhood government.

Sulayman, of Iraqi Arab, Circassian and Georgian descent, was a key figure in the early days of Iraqi independence and the effort to create a multi-ethnic state. He came to power in Bakr Sidqi&#x27;s coup, the first that the country experienced. His position was confirmed by King Ghazi.

He was president of the Chamber of Deputies in 1926. Together with Sidqi, Sulayman veered away from the pan-Arab nationalism of the preceding Iraqi governments. Together with Sidqi, he forged an alliance with Turkey and settled the border dispute with Iran, two countries he regarded as potential allies in the struggle against Arab nationalist sentiment. Nevertheless, he differed with Sidqi over the emphases of the new government, preferring to address social issues in the country, while Sidqi focused on military affairs and expanding Iraq&#x27;s borders.

== His political positions ==
Sulayman held the following political positions in the Iraqi state:

* He was elected a member of the Iraqi parliament in 1925.
* Then he rose to the position of Minister of Justice and resigned in 1928.
* He was appointed Minister of Knowledge.
* He was appointed Minister of Interior.
* He was the head of the Iraqi parliament.
* He was Prime Minister in the era of the coup of Bakr Sidqi in 1936, and he served as Prime Minister in Iraq from October 30, 1936 to August 12, 1937, and managed the helm of government with unparalleled sincerity. After the coup, he was sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment, and forced to resign after the assassination of Bakr Sidqi in 1937.

<text>Charles Dumoulin (Du Moulin, Molinaeus) (1500–1566) was a French jurist. He was surnamed by some of his contemporaries the &quot;French Papinian&quot;.

==Life==
He was born in Paris. He began practice as an advocate before the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris from 1522 to 1535 and later taught law at various places. After he turned Lutheran and later Calvinist, he was forced into exile for many years, with stays in Basel, Geneva, Tübingen, Strasbourg, Besançon, and elsewhere. He returned to Paris in 1557 but had to flee again in 1562. After writing against the Council of Trent, he was imprisoned by order of the &quot;parlement&quot; until 1564. He converted back to Catholicism on his deathbed. 

==Works==

Dumoulin was a prolific writer on legal, theological, and other topics. His legal writings (on Roman law, canon law, customary law) gained him greatest reputation. His remarkable erudition and breadth of view had a considerable effect on the subsequent development of French law. At the same time, several of this works stirred considerable controversy, and some were condemned by Lutherans, Calvinists and/or Catholics for religious reasons. His works were banned by the Sacred Congregation of the Index in 1559 and 1564. 

Dumoulin was a bitter enemy of feudalism, which he attacked in his &quot;De Feudis&quot; (Paris, 1539).

In 1552, written &quot;Commentaire sur l&#x27;édit du roi Henri II sur les petites dates&quot;, which was condemned by the Sorbonne, but his &quot;Conseil sur le fait du concile de Trente&quot; created a still greater stir, and aroused against him both the Catholics and the Calvinists.

Other important works were his commentaries on the customary law of Paris (&quot;Commentarii in consuetudines parisienses&quot;, Paris, 1539, 1554; Frankfurt, 1575; Lausanne, 1576), valuable as the only commentary on those laws in force in 1510, and the &quot;Extricatio labyrinthi dividui et individui&quot;, a treatise on the law of surety. 

In 1559, he published an edition of the &quot;Decretum Gratiani&quot;; in the commentaries, he pointed out spurious materials contained in this important collection of canon law.

A collected edition of Dumoulin&#x27;s works was published in Paris in 1681 (5 vols.).

Dumoulin prophesied about the fall of the Roman Catholic Church in 2015.

<text>Trevor Thomas Phillips (25 May 1937 – 28 November 2022) was an English visual artist. He worked as a painter, printmaker and collagist.

==Life==
Trevor Thomas Phillips was born on 25 May 1937 in Clapham, London to David and Margaret Phillips (née Arnold). He was the younger of two sons. 
In 1940, the cotton market collapsed and the family had to sell their home. Phillips&#x27; father went to work in Abergavenny, Wales, leaving his wife to run the boarding-house in London. After the war the family finances improved and they were able to holiday annually in France and Germany. His parents began to buy short leasehold properties as investments and although these did not yield the return that they wished, his mother did buy the freehold of one house, which would later become her son&#x27;s studio and home.

From 1942 to 1947, Phillips attended Bonneville Road Primary School in Clapham. He said that while he was there he &quot;learned the word artist and discovered that an artist is someone who does not have to put his paints away, so decided to become one&quot;. Although he enjoyed school he was noted for his fascination with drawing and his refusal to conform. His mother recalled him buying a platform ticket every Sunday and taking long railway journeys when he was just 11 years old. He progressed to Henry Thornton Grammar School, Clapham, where he developed his love of music, playing violin and bassoon in the school orchestra and singing solo baritone in school concerts and stage events. In 1954 he exhibited paintings for the first time, in an open art show on the railings of the Thames Embankment. A year later, aged 17, he won a travel scholarship to France, where he lived for three months. His mother remembers him returning to London with a sack of horse bones from the First World War, but more significantly he bought himself a piano and started to teach himself to play. In 1957 he became a founder member of the Philharmonia Chorus.

From 1958 to 1960, Phillips read English Literature and Anglo Saxon at St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford. He attended life-drawing classes at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, acted in plays, and designed and illustrated the &quot;Isis&quot; magazine. Upon graduation, he taught Art, Music and English at Aristotle Road School in Brixton, London. He also attended evening classes in life drawing, under Frank Auerbach, and sculpture at Camberwell College of Arts, where he became a full-time student in 1961. When he graduated in 1964 his work was selected for that year&#x27;s &quot;Young Contemporaries&quot; Exhibition in London and in the following year, the AIA Galleries in London exhibited his first one-man show. While studying at Camberwell Phillips married Jill, and their daughter Ruth was born in 1964. Their second child was a son, Leo. They would remain married until 1988.

Phillips became a teacher at Ipswich School of Art, where one of his students was Brian Eno, who would become a lifelong friend. Phillips soon moved to teach Liberal Studies at Walthamstow Polytechnic, where he met the pianist John Tilbury and participated in improvisation concerts at several polytechnics. His first musical composition was &quot;Four Pieces&quot; for Tilbury.

In 1966 Phillips exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition for the first time, started work on &quot;A Humument&quot;, and began collaborating with Brian Eno. When Cornelius Cardew founded the Scratch Orchestra, its constitution was drafted in Phillips&#x27; garden in Bath (where he had become a teacher at the Bath Academy of Art) and he participated in most of the concerts until he became disillusioned with its politicization. In 1968 he moved to Wolverhampton to teach at Wolverhampton School of Art, and he had a second one-man exhibition, at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham. He wrote the opera &quot;Irma&quot; in the following year and started the &quot;Terminal Grey&quot; series of paintings.

Throughout the 1970s his works were exhibited widely in one-man shows and collections. After a period as a visiting tutor at the Art School in Kassel, Germany, he abandoned teaching and took his first trip to Africa. In 1973 he began the &quot;20 Sites n Years&quot; photographic project. His first significant publication, &quot;Works/Texts I&quot;, was published in 1975 by Hansjörg Mayer and his first retrospective exhibition toured Europe. This was also the year that he met Marvin and Ruth Sackner, who were to become his patrons and found an archive in Miami to house most of his work. The following year saw the completion of the privately printed edition of &quot;A Humument&quot;, which had been published in ten sections since 1971.

In 1978 Brian Eno produced a recording of &quot;Irma&quot; for Obscure Records directed by Gavin Bryars with a cast including Howard Skempton and Phillips himself. Phillips began contributing regular reviews to &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; (now &quot;TLS&quot;). At the beginning of the 1980s he designed a series of tapestries for his old Oxford college and he returned to portraiture with a portrait of Pella Erskine-Tulloch (the bookbinder who bound Phillips&#x27; favourite version of &quot;A Humument&quot; in three volumes). Erskine-Tulloch would become the subject of a series of weekly sittings which he described as &quot;Pella on Sunday&quot;. He had moved out of the family home at 102 Grove Lane and moved back into his studio at 57 Talfourd Road in Peckham. A man with a great pleasure in habit, he would lunch every Tuesday in the Choumert Café on Choumert Road. His private limited edition of his own translation of &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; illustrated with his prints was published in 1983 and in 1984 he was elected a Royal Academician. Peter Greenaway and Phillips co-directed &quot;A TV Dante&quot; with John Gielgud and Bob Peck, which was broadcast on Channel 4 television in 1986. During this time he also collaborated with Malcolm Bradbury, Adrian Mitchell, Jake Auerbach, Richard Minsky and Heather McHugh.

At the beginning of the 1990s Phillips painted portraits of the Monty Python team and produced a glass screen and paintings for The Ivy restaurant in London. He illustrated &quot;Plato&#x27;s Symposium&quot; for the Folio Society (for whom he would illustrate &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in 1999), completed his &quot;Curriculum Vitae&quot; series of paintings and saw a new &quot;Works and Texts&quot; book published. In 1994 he went to Harvard as Artist in Residence at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts and published &quot;Merely Connect&quot;, which he had written with Salman Rushdie during a series of portrait sittings. With the move to a new studio in Bellenden Road and a change of ownership of the Choumert Café, Phillips began to lunch regularly opposite his studio at the Crossroads Café, where he could be found reading literary magazines through his blue-rimmed spectacles.

As part of the Africa95 celebration of African arts throughout Britain, he curated the 1995 exhibition &quot;Africa: the Art of a Continent&quot; for the Royal Academy and became their Chairman of Exhibitions. Phillips began to move into new areas in the mid-1990s: stage design, &quot;The Postcard Century&quot; for Thames &amp; Hudson (building on his passion for postcards), quilting, mud drawings and wire structures. All his old projects continued and he began illustrating &quot;Ulysses&quot;. He also translated the libretto of &quot;Otello&quot; while he was designing the English National Opera production. In 1998 Largo Records released &quot;Six of Hearts&quot;, a CD of Phillips&#x27; songs and other music written since 1992 but this went out of print when the label failed in 2002.

By the late 1990s Phillips was an establishment figure in most aspects of the arts. He became a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, an Honorary Fellow of the London Institute, an Honorary Member of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters and a Trustee of the British Museum. He celebrated his fiftieth birthday by playing a game of cricket with many of his friends at the Kennington Oval cricket ground. In 1995, he married the writer Fiona Maddocks, Music Critic of &quot;The Observer&quot;.

In 2000 he designed lampposts, pavements, gates and arches for Southwark Council&#x27;s &quot;Peckham Renewal Project&quot;. Antony Gormley, whose workshop adjoins Phillips&#x27; studio in Bellenden Road, Peckham, designed bollards for the same project and the work of both artists adorns that street.

Phillips was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to the Arts in the 2002 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list.

He was Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Oxford for 2005–06. In 2006 Phillips exhibited six works in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, among them &quot;Colour Sudoku&quot;, and held a Micro-Retrospective (9 February–23 April 2006) at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

Phillips died on 28 November 2022, at the age of 85.

==Works==
Phillips&#x27; best known work is &quot;A Humument: A Treated Victorian Novel originally by W.H. Mallock&quot;. One day, Phillips went to a bookseller&#x27;s with the express intention of buying a cheap book to use as the basis of an art project. He randomly purchased a novel called &quot;A Human Document&quot; by Victorian author William Hurrell Mallock, and began a long project of creating art from its pages. He painted, collaged or drew over the pages, leaving some of the text peeking through in serpentine bubble shapes, creating a &quot;found&quot; text with its own story, different from the original. Characters from Mallock&#x27;s novel appear in the new story, but the protagonist is a new character named &quot;Bill Toge&quot;, whose surname can only appear on pages that originally contained words such as &quot;together&quot; or &quot;altogether&quot;. Toge&#x27;s story is a meditation on unrequited love and the struggle to create and appreciate art.

Several editions of &quot;A Humument&quot; have been published over the years, with more pages being revised each time. The sixth and final edition was published in 2016.

Phillips used the same technique (always with the Mallock source material) in many of his other works, including the illustration of his own translation of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; (published in 1985). He was also fond of re-using images from postcards (which he avidly collected), as well as drawing stencil-style lettering, freehand. With these works, Phillips used famous pieces of literature and art in his work. The melding of visual art with textual content was a hallmark of his work.

He also painted portraits (his portrait of Dame Iris Murdoch is well known) and murals, and created installation art and sculpture. His portrait of Michael Kustow won joint Hunting Art Prize in 1988. Phillips was a member of the Royal Academy (since 1989) and, in 2003 designed a Royal Mint commemorative five-pound coin for the 50th anniversary of the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. He was an opera fan, and composed an opera, &quot;Irma&quot;, using the &quot;Humument&quot; source material for the libretto. He also wrote the libretto for &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, a chamber opera with music by Tarik O&#x27;Regan currently in development with American Opera Projects.

Phillips engaged in other projects that challenge the viewer&#x27;s perceptions of art, such as his project &quot;20 Sites n Years&quot;, in which he photographed the same 20 spots in his studio&#x27;s neighborhood, once a year. As the years go by, the viewer watches the neighbourhood gradually change. Similarly, Phillips made a series of paintings called &quot;Terminal Greys&quot;, consisting of simple cross-hatched bars of murky, grayish paint composed from the leftovers on his palette at the end of each work day. Since there are no aesthetic judgments on the artist&#x27;s part in the creation of these works, they are virtually mechanical; the &quot;art&quot; could be said to lie in the conception of the work and not in the accidental &quot;grey rainbow&quot; appearance of the result.

He collaborated with film director Peter Greenaway on &quot;A TV Dante&quot;, a television miniseries adaptation of the first eight cantos of the &quot;Inferno&quot;.

Phillips provided cover art for music albums including &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; by King Crimson (1974), &quot;Another Green World&quot; by Brian Eno (1975), and one of the 16 portraits that form Peter Blake&#x27;s design for &quot;Face Dances&quot; by The Who (1981). The cover art by Phillips for Dark Star&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Twenty Sound&quot; (1999) used the same technique as &quot;The Humument&quot;, but with the album&#x27;s lyrics as the source material.

Phillips also produced books about art, including &quot;Music in Art&quot; and &quot;Africa: The Art of a Continent&quot;.

<doc id="886193" wikidata="Q534026" url="?curid=886193" title="Ukase">
<text>In Imperial Russia, a ukase () or ukaz ( ) was a proclamation of the tsar, government, or a religious leadership (e.g., Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus&#x27; or the Most Holy Synod) that had the force of law. &quot;Edict&quot; and &quot;decree&quot; are adequate translations using the terminology and concepts of Roman law.

From the Russian term, the word &quot;ukase&quot; has entered the English language with the meaning of &quot;any proclamation or decree; an order or regulation of a final or arbitrary nature&quot;.

==History==
Prior to the 1917 October Revolution, the term applied in Russia to an edict or ordinance, legislative or administrative, having the force of law. A ukase proceeded either from the emperor or from the senate, which had the power of issuing such ordinances for the purpose of carrying out existing decrees. All such decrees were promulgated by the senate. A difference was drawn between the ukase signed by the emperor’s hand and his verbal ukase, or order, made upon a report submitted to him.

After the Revolution, a government proclamation of wide meaning was called a &quot;decree&quot; (Russian: декрет, dekret); more specific proclamations were called &quot;ukaz&quot;. Both terms are usually translated as &quot;decree&quot;.
According to the Russian Federation&#x27;s 1993 constitution, a Decree of the President of Russia is referred to as &quot;ukaz&quot;.

<text>Ricardo Luiz Zonta (; born March 23, 1976) is a Brazilian professional racing driver. He currently competes full-time in the Brazilian Stock Car Pro Series, driving the No. 10 Toyota Corolla E210 for RCM Motorsport.

==Early career==
Born in Curitiba, Brazil, Zonta began karting in 1987, winning his first race shortly thereafter. The following year, he was runner-up for the Curitiba Karting Championship, and in 1991, he won the title. He continued karting until 1992, finishing fourth in the São Paulo Karting Championship before progressing to single-seaters for 1993. He finished 6th in the Brazilian Formula Chevrolet Championship, and then in 1994, came fifth in the Brazilian Formula Three Championship. A year later, Zonta won both the Brazilian and South American Formula Three Championships.

Moving to Europe in 1996, Zonta competed in the International Formula 3000 Championship for Draco Racing, winning two races and finishing fourth overall. In the same year, he became the first Brazilian to compete in International Touring Cars, with Mercedes. In 1997, he won three races and the Formula 3000 championship. He also took home the &quot;Golden Helmet&quot; award for best international driver for his efforts. The Jordan Formula One team signed him as their official test driver following his championship, and in 1998, he was signed by McLaren boss Ron Dennis. Zonta tested with the McLaren Formula One team in 1998, and concurrently won the FIA GT Championship (GT1 class) and the &quot;Golden Helmet&quot; award in the &quot;world prominence&quot; category.

In October 1998, immediately after winning the FIA GT championship, Zonta signed up with the B.A.R. Formula One racing team as one of its race drivers for the 1999 season, after rejecting offers from Jordan and Sauber.

==Formula One career==
In 1999, Zonta started as a Formula One racing driver alongside 1997 World Champion Jacques Villeneuve at new team BAR. He injured his foot in an accident during practice for the Brazilian Grand Prix, and was forced to miss three races. He also had a large accident at Spa-Francorchamps, and finished the season with no championship points. Zonta remained with BAR for the 2000 season, scoring his first world championship point with a sixth place in the opening race. He had another large accident when his front suspension broke during testing at Silverstone, but continued the season, scoring points in both the Italian and United States Grands Prix, to finish 14th in the championship. Replaced by Olivier Panis for the 2001 season, Zonta became the third driver for the Jordan team, replacing the injured Heinz-Harald Frentzen for one race, and then again when Frentzen was sacked, but was overlooked to replace him for the remainder of the season.

In 2002, he decided to focus on the Telefónica World Series, which he won. Zonta was then hired as test driver for the Toyota F1 team in 2003, retaining the position in 2004. Toward the end of the season, the team sacked Cristiano da Matta from a race seat, and Zonta drove in four Grands Prix. In Belgium, he was running in fourth place three laps from the finish when his engine failed. In Suzuka the team hired Jarno Trulli and Zonta had to sit the event out, but the team allowed him to compete in his home race, the Brazilian Grand Prix, which he finished in 13th. He continued as a test driver for Toyota in 2005, alongside veteran French pilot Olivier Panis. At the US Grand Prix later that year, he stood in for the injured Ralf Schumacher and took his place on the grid, only for Toyota, like the other six Michelin-shod teams, to withdraw from the race due to safety concerns. 2006 saw Zonta continue with Toyota as the team&#x27;s third and test driver. He was confirmed as test driver for the Renault Formula One team for the 2007 season on 6 September 2006.

==After Formula One==
In 2007, Zonta entered the Stock Car Brasil series in parallel with the work for the Renault team. In 2008, he contested the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Peugeot Sport, driving the #9 car alongside Franck Montagny and Formula One tester Christian Klien. 

He is also driving in the Grand Am Championship in America with Krohn Racing, while also being the team owner and driver of RZ Motorsport in Stock Car Brasil.

==Personal life==
Two of Zonta&#x27;s relatives, Billy and Brendon, are also racing drivers. Billy used to compete in the Sprint Race series until he was forced to retire in 2016 after being diagnosed with cancer. Brendon is currently active in Sprint Race&#x27;s continuation series NASCAR Brasil Sprint Race, driving the No. 7 Ford Mustang in the AM class.

<text>Frank M. &quot;Wildfire&quot; Schulte (September 17, 1882 – October 2, 1949) was an American outfielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for the Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies, and Washington Senators from 1904 to 1918. He helped the Cubs win four National League (NL) championships and two World Series.

In 1911, Schulte won the NL Chalmers Award, a precursor to the modern-day MVP award; that year, Schulte had become the first of only four players in history to join the 20–20–20–20 club, hitting 30 doubles, 21 triples, and 21 home runs, and stealing 23 bases.

==Early life and education==
Schulte was born in Cochecton, New York, in 1882 to German immigrants. He played independent baseball as a teenager, despite his father&#x27;s opposition to the idea. From 1902 to 1904, he played for the New York State League&#x27;s Syracuse Stars.

==Major League Baseball career==
Schulte was acquired by the Chicago Cubs in August 1904.

Schulte made his Major League Baseball debut for the Cubs in September 1904. He played on the Cubs teams that won National League pennants in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910. They won the World Series in 1907 and 1908. In his four World Series appearances, Schulte had an overall batting average of .321.

In 1910, Schulte led the NL with 10 home runs. In 1911, he led the NL in home runs (21), runs batted in (107), and slugging percentage (.534). He also became the first player in major league history to have more than 20 doubles, triples, home runs, and stolen bases in a season. The feat was not accomplished again until Willie Mays did it in 1957. Schulte won the 1911 NL Chalmers Award, making Schulte along with Ty Cobb the first major league players to have been considered &quot;Most Valuable Player&quot; for a season.

In July 1916, Schulte was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates. His hitting declined, and he then played for the Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Senators until the 1918 season, his last as a major leaguer.

Schulte played in the International League and Pacific Coast League from 1919 to 1922.

In 1,806 MLB games over 15 seasons, Schulte posted a .270 batting average (1766-for-6533) with 906 runs, 288 doubles, 124 triples, 92 home runs, 793 runs batted in, 233 stolen bases, 545 bases on balls, a .332 on-base percentage, and a .395 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .966 fielding percentage.

==Personal life==
Schulte acquired his nickname, &quot;Wildfire&quot;, after seeing a play called &quot;Wildfire&quot; in Mississippi. He then named one of his race horses &quot;Wildfire&quot; and was eventually known by that name, as well.

Schulte married his wife, Mabel Kirby, in 1911. He eventually settled in Oakland, California.

==Death==
Schulte died in Oakland, California on October 2, 1949, at age 67.

<doc id="886212" wikidata="Q2843064" url="?curid=886212" title="American Veterinary Medical Association">
<text>The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) is an American not-for-profit association founded in 1863 that represents more than 105,000 veterinarians.

The AVMA provides information resources, continuing education opportunities, publications, and discounts on personal and professional products, programs, and services. The AVMA indicates that it lobbies for animal friendly legislation within a framework that supports the use of animals for human purposes (e.g., food, fiber, research, companionship).

The AVMA Council on Education is the designated accrediting body for schools of veterinary medicine in the United States.

The AVMA publishes the &quot;Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association&quot; (JAVMA) and the &quot;American Journal of Veterinary Research&quot; (AJVR).

The AVMA&#x27;s veterinary student organization is the Student American Veterinary Medical Association (SAVMA).

==History==
The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) was founded in 1863, when 40 delegates representing seven states met for a convention in New York. Originally named the United States Veterinary Medical Association, the USVMA was renamed the AVMA in 1889.

By 1913, the AVMA consisted of 1,650 members, with membership open only to graduates of accredited veterinary schools.

, the AVMA has more than 97,000 members. In addition to treating pets, veterinarians work in a number of fields, such as public health, agriculture, food safety, academics, and the military.

==AVMA policy==

The AVMA produces policies in response to member requests and stakeholder interest. These statements are general and aim to encourage improvement based on the best available scientific evidence.

In 2005, the AVMA changed its policy on pregnant sow housing, stating that &quot;given the number of variables and large variation in performance within both group and stall systems for pregnant sows, no one system is clearly better than others under all conditions and according to all criteria of animal welfare&quot;. The AVMA&#x27;s policy was adopted after a comprehensive review by a multi-disciplinary, multi-perspective task force of experts that produced an accompanying review of housing for pregnant sows.

The AVMA has voted on several proposals to take a formal stand against the forced feeding of birds to make foie gras. Although foie gras has been banned in many countries in Europe, as well as in the U.S. state of California, because of an absence of science specifically addressing the welfare aspects of foie gras production, as well as conflicting opinions among its membership, the AVMA opted not to take a stand either for or against foie gras. The AVMA has published a welfare implications of foie gras production backgrounder.

The AVMA has received pushback from many veterinarians for its classification of ventilation shutdown plus (VSD+) as &quot;acceptable under constrained circumstances&quot;. Many veterinarians regard the method as cruel and have questioned the justification for the classification. In its guidelines, the AVMA relied only on one report from North Carolina State University and argued this gave evidence that VSD+ provided sufficiently limited suffering. However, this unpublished report&#x27;s methodology has been questioned by organizations such as the Animal Welfare Institute for using an untested metric for stress (using heat shock protein 70), containing mathematical errors, having unclear writing, and more. 

==Legislation==
AVMA supported the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act of 2014, a law that amended the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to clarify that veterinarians are not required to have separate registrations to dispense controlled substances outside of their principal place of business, such as when treating animals on a farm. AVMA argued that &quot;the CSA must be amended so that our nation&#x27;s animals do not suffer unnecessarily.&quot; Due to an interpretation of the law by the Drug Enforcement Administration, veterinarians were not allowed to travel to their off-site animal patients with controlled substances.

== Academic Accreditation ==
The United States Department of Education has designated the AVMA Council on Education as the accrediting body for schools of veterinary medicine in the United States. In this capacity, the AVMA develops and maintains educational standards for these institutions to ensure the qualifications and competency of graduates of veterinary schools.

Two bodies within AVMA are responsible for veterinary education accreditation: the AVMA Council on Education (COE) and the Committee on Veterinary Technician Education and Activities (CVTEA). The former is responsible for accreditation of veterinary colleges and the latter veterinary technology programs.

=== AVMA-accredited Veterinary Colleges ===
, the following colleges were accredited by the AVMA.
=== AVMA-accredited Veterinary Technology Programs ===
, the AVMA accredits veterinary technician programs in all but three U.S. states, one program in Canada, and a number of distance learning programs.

==Specialists in veterinary medicine==
According to the AVMA, a board-certified veterinary specialist is &quot;a veterinarian who has completed additional training in a specific area of veterinary medicine and has passed an examination that evaluates their knowledge and skills in that specialty area.&quot;

, the AVMA recognizes 22 veterinary specialty organizations, including American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia, American College of Veterinary Surgeons, and American College of Zoological Medicine. The AVMA recognizes 41 distinct veterinary specialties, including anesthesia, behavior, dentistry, parasitology, pathology, pharmacology, and surgery.

<text>The Canon EOS 300D, manufactured by Canon, was marketed in North America as the EOS Digital Rebel, in Japan as the EOS Kiss Digital, and was also sold as the DS6041. It is a 6.3-megapixel entry-level digital single-lens reflex camera. It was initially announced on 20 August 2003 at a price point of $899 without lens, $999 with the &quot;kit&quot; lens. It is part of the Canon EOS line of cameras. This was a significant milestone in digital cameras, as it was the first digital SLR offered under $1000.

The 300D was one of the first digital SLR (single lens reflex) cameras that cost less than 1000 euros (£830 at January 2012 exchange rates).

==Features==
The 300D is often compared to the Canon EOS 10D, which features virtually the same CMOS image sensor and image processing chip. Several 10D features can be unlocked and used in the 300D by using non-official firmware.

The 300D polycarbonate bodies were originally available in North America in silver color only, whereas the Japanese version was also available in black. Later, black versions of the 300D were also released in the US and Europe.

The 300D was the first camera to use the Canon EF-S lens mount. It also takes the EF lens mount lenses. Canon introduced the EF-S 18–55mm as the kit lens alongside the 300D. It was available in a USM version in Japan and as a non-USM version elsewhere. Very late production black 300D cameras were available with the USM version in Europe.

<text>The Grand Army of the Republic Cemetery on Seattle, Washington&#x27;s Capitol Hill is a cemetery situated just north of Lake View Cemetery on the hill&#x27;s northern slope, on East Howe Street between 12th and Everett Avenues East.

A consortium of Seattle&#x27;s five Grand Army of the Republic posts – Stevens Post #1, Miller Post #31, Cushing Post #56, Saxton Post #103, and Green Lake #112 – established the cemetery in 1895 on land donated by Huldah and David Kaufman, two of the city&#x27;s earliest Jewish settlers, who arrived in 1869. The G.A.R. posts maintained the cemetery until 1922, when they gave the property, excluding of the 526 gravesites, to the city of Seattle. The association deeded the gravesites to the Stevens Post who hired neighboring Lake View Cemetery to maintain the grounds.

The cemetery fell into decline over the following decades, because of confusion over land title, the failure in 1939 to secure WPA project, the imposition during World War II of the Coast Artillery on the grounds, and so on. In 1960, the city attempted to transfer maintenance to the Veterans Administration, either in situ or by moving the graves to Fort Lawton in Magnolia, now Discovery Park, but the VA was unable to allocate money on cemeteries it did not own, and the graves were never moved. The land surrounding the graves came under the jurisdiction of Seattle&#x27;s Department of Parks and Recreation.

In 1996, the parks department proposed that the park become an off-leash dog-run; in response to this, the Friends of the GAR Cemetery Park formed the next year. Members of the group now staff monthly work parties, are involved in headstone replacement, and perform daily flag raising.

The cemetery holds the remains of Medal of Honor recipient Frank Bois (1841–1920), who was honored for heroism while aboard the USS &quot;Cincinnati&quot; during the Battle of Vicksburg, Mississippi during the Civil War.

<doc id="886279" wikidata="Q63342" url="?curid=886279" title="Canon EOS 10D">
<text>The [[Canon EOS]] 10D is a discontinued 6.3-megapixel semi-professional digital SLR camera, initially announced on 27 February 2003. It replaced the EOS D60, which is also a 6.3-megapixel digital SLR camera. It was succeeded by the EOS 20D in August 2004.

Despite having an APS-C sensor, the 10D was introduced before EF-S lenses became available and was incompatible with them. The 10D is compatible 
only with EF lenses. All successive Canon Digital SLR cameras with APS-C sensors can mount EF-S lenses.

The 10D captured RAW images in the Canon CRW file format, which was retired by Canon, although modern versions of Canon&#x27;s Digital Photo Professional will read it.

When it was released, recommended retail price in the USA was $1,999 (£1,520).

==Compared to the D60==
While the 10D shared some similarities with the D60—both used sensors of roughly the same resolution, both used the EF lens mount and BG-ED3 battery grip—the 10D saw many major changes.

A new magnesium alloy body with changed button layout was introduced, including relocating the on/off switch to the bottom rear of the camera where it could easily be switched off accidentally. New LCD panels were introduced. The on/off switch was later moved back to the upper-left of the camera&#x27;s rear with the Canon 7D. Flash strobes were used instead of a dedicated autofocus assist lamp. The shutter and mirror were also quieter than the D60 systems. An upgraded autofocus system, using a more-sensitive and wider-area 7-point array similar to the Canon EOS 30V was also included.

Internally, the sensor was changed to use a new manufacturing process, allowing for an extended film speed range of ISO 100 to 3200 with a custom function. The 10 used an upgraded image processor, and was the first DSLR to use the DIGIC chipset. Continuous shooting was also slightly improved, allowing for nine images in a burst. The camera introduced FAT32 for CompactFlash cards larger than 2 GB in capacity, the first for a Canon DSLR. Improvements to white balance systems, shooting parameters, sensor cleaning, direct print support, Adobe RGB colorspace, improved language support and an orientation sensor were also made.

==Reception==
Reviews at the time of release were mostly positive.
Bryan Carnathan of &quot;The Digital Picture&quot; described the affordable price of the 10D as &quot;unheard-of-at-the-time&quot;, and the sensor &quot;makes this camera perfect for nature photography&quot;, although while the auto-focus was improved from previous models it sometimes did not work properly.
Lori Grunin from &quot;CNet&quot; gave it a score of 7.2, praising the value, features and performance while also saying that it was tricky to get sharp auto-focusing.
Phil Askey from &quot;DPReview&quot; rated this camera as &quot;Highly Recommended&quot;, concluding that &quot;I have no concerns in stating that as things stand (at the time of writing this review) the EOS-10D is the absolute best in class, with the best image quality, lowest high sensitivity noise, superb build quality and excellent price.&quot;

Later reviews are less favorable. In 2017 – Canon having manufactured six new generations of high-end APS-C cameras between the 10D and the date of the review – CameraDecision scored it 49% for imaging, 33% for features, 55% for value, 68% for portability, giving an overall score of 46%. They rated it &quot;Average&quot; for all uses except Sport, which was &quot;Good&quot;.

==Firmware update==

The current firmware update is 2.01 (as of 2011-03-17). It is necessary to update to the firmware to enable PICTBRIDGE support on the Canon EOS 10D. PICTBRIDGE allows the printing of images from a camera directly to a printer, without using a personal computer as an intermediary device.

<doc id="886283" wikidata="Q918066" url="?curid=886283" title="Britannia Bridge">
<text>Britannia Bridge () is a bridge in Wales that crosses the Menai Strait between the Isle of Anglesey and city of Bangor. It was originally designed and built by the noted railway engineer Robert Stephenson as a tubular bridge of wrought iron rectangular box-section spans for carrying rail traffic. Its importance was to form a critical link of the Chester and Holyhead Railway&#x27;s route, enabling trains to directly travel between London and the port of Holyhead, thus facilitating a sea link to Dublin, Ireland.

Decades before the building of the Britannia Bridge, the Menai Suspension Bridge had been completed, but this structure carried a road rather than track; there was no rail connection to Anglesey before its construction. After many years of deliberation and proposals, on 30 June 1845, a Parliamentary Bill covering the construction of the Britannia Bridge received royal assent. At the Admiralty&#x27;s insistence, the bridge elements were required to be relatively high in order to permit the passage of a fully rigged man-of-war. In order to meet the diverse requirements, Stephenson, the project&#x27;s chief engineer, performed in-depth studies on the concept of tubular bridges. For the detailed design of the structure&#x27;s girders, Stephenson gained the assistance of distinguished engineer William Fairbairn. On 10 April 1846, the foundation stone for the Britannia Bridge was laid. The construction method used for the riveted wrought iron tubes was derived from contemporary shipbuilding practices; the same technique as used for the Britannia Bridge was also used on the smaller Conwy Railway Bridge. On 5 March 1850, Stephenson himself fitted the last rivet of the structure, marking the bridge&#x27;s official completion.

On 3 March 1966, the Britannia Bridge received Grade II listed status.

A fire in May 1970 caused extensive damage to the Britannia Bridge. Subsequent investigation determined that the damage to the tubes was so extensive that they were not realistically repairable. The bridge was rebuilt in a quite different configuration, reusing the piers while employing new arches to support not one but two decks, as the new Britannia Bridge was to function as a combined road-and-rail bridge. The bridge was rebuilt in phases, initially reopening in 1972 as a single-tier steel truss arch bridge, carrying only rail traffic. Over the next eight years more of the structure was replaced, allowing for more trains to run and a second tier to be completed. The second tier was opened to accommodate road traffic in 1980. The bridge was subject to a £4 million four-month in-depth maintenance programme during 2011. Since the 1990s, there has been talk of increasing road capacity over the Menai Strait, either by extending the road deck of the existing bridge or via the construction of a third bridge.

== Design ==

The opening of the Menai Bridge in 1826, to the east of where Britannia Bridge was later built, provided the first fixed road link between Anglesey and the mainland. The increasing popularity of rail travel shortly necessitated a second bridge to provide a direct rail link between London and the port of Holyhead, the Chester and Holyhead Railway.

Other railway schemes were proposed, including one in 1838 to cross Thomas Telford&#x27;s existing Menai Bridge. Railway pioneer George Stephenson was invited to comment on this proposal but stated his concern about re-using a single carriageway of the suspension bridge, as bridges of this type were unsuited to locomotive use. By 1840, a Treasury committee decided broadly in favour of Stephenson&#x27;s proposals, however, final consent to the route, including Britannia Bridge, would not be granted until 30 June 1845, the date on which the corresponding Parliamentary Bill received royal assent. Around the same time, Stephenson&#x27;s son, Robert Stephenson, was appointed as chief engineer for the project.

At the Admiralty&#x27;s insistence, any bridge would have to permit passage of the strait by a fully rigged man-of-war. Stephenson therefore intended to cross the strait at a high level, over , by a bridge with two main spans of , rectangular iron tubes, each weighing , supported by masonry piers, the centre one of which was to be built on the Britannia Rock. Two additional spans of length would complete the bridge, making a continuous girder. The trains were to run inside the tubes (inside the box girders). Up until then, the longest wrought iron span had been , barely one fifteenth of the bridge&#x27;s spans of . As originally envisaged by Stephenson, the tubular construction would give a structure sufficiently stiff to support the heavy loading associated with trains, but the tubes would not be fully self-supporting, some of their weight having to be taken by suspension chains.

For the detailed design of the girders, Stephenson secured the assistance of the distinguished engineer William Fairbairn, an old friend of his father and described by Stephenson as &quot;well known for his thorough practical knowledge in such matters&quot;. Fairbairn began a series of practical experiments on various tube shapes and enlisted the help of Eaton Hodgkinson &quot;distinguished as the first scientific authority on the strength of iron beams&quot; It became apparent from Fairbairn&#x27;s experiments that- without special precautions - the failure mode for the tube under load would be buckling of the top plate in compression, the theoretical analysis of which gave Hodgkinson some difficulty. When Stephenson reported to the directors of the railway in February 1846, he attached reports by both Hodgkinson and Fairbairn. From his analysis of the resistance to buckling of tubes with single top plates, Hodgkinson believed that it would require an impracticably thick (and therefore heavy) top plate to make the tubes stiff enough to support their own weight, and advised auxiliary suspension from link chains.

However, Fairbairn&#x27;s experiments had moved on from those covered by Hodgkinson&#x27;s theory to include designs in which the top plate was stiffened by &#x27;corrugation&#x27; (the incorporation of cylindrical tubes). The results of these later experiments he found very encouraging; whilst it was still to be determined what the optimum form of the tubular girder should be &quot;I would venture to state that a Tubular Bridge can be constructed of such powers and dimensions as will meet, with perfect security, the requirements of railway traffic across the Straits&quot; although it might require more materials than originally envisaged and the utmost care would be needed in its construction. He believed it would be &#x27;highly improper&#x27; to rely upon chains as the principal support of the bridge. Under every circumstance, I am of opinion that the tubes should be made sufficiently strong to sustain not only their own weight, but in addition to that load 2000 tons equally distributed over the surface of the platform, a load ten times greater than they will ever be called upon to support.

In fact, it should be a huge sheet-iron hollow girder, of sufficient strength and stiffness to sustain those weights; and, provided that the parts are well-proportioned and the plates properly riveted, you may strip off the chains and have it as a useful monument of the enterprise and energy of the age in which it was constructed.
Stephenson&#x27;s report drew attention to the difference of opinion between his experts, but reassured the directors that the design of the masonry piers allowed for the tubes to be given suspension support, and no view need yet be taken as to the need for it, which would be resolved by further experiments. A span model was constructed and tested at Fairbairn&#x27;s Millwall shipyard, and used as a basis for the final design. Stephenson, who had not previously attended any of Fairbairn&#x27;s experiments, was present at one involving this &#x27;model tube&#x27;, and consequently was persuaded that auxiliary chains were unnecessary. No chains were fitted. As the only purpose of the piers (above the level of the present road deck) was to support the chains, these piers have never had any practical use. Although Stephenson had pressed for the tubes to be elliptical in section, Fairbairn&#x27;s preferred rectangular section was adopted. Fairbairn was responsible both for the cellular construction of the top part of the tubes, and for developing the stiffening of the side panels. Each main span weighed roughly 1,830 tonnes.

== Construction and use ==

On 10 April 1846, the foundation stone for the Britannia Bridge was laid, marking the official commencement of construction work at the site. The resident engineer for the structure&#x27;s construction was civil engineer Edwin Clark, who had previously aided Stephenson in performing the complex structural stress calculations involved in its design process. The first major elements of the structure to be built were the side tubes, this work was performed in situ, using wooden platforms to support it. The construction method used for the iron tubes was derived from contemporary shipbuilding practices, being composed of riveted wrought iron plates thick, complete with sheeted sides and cellular roofs and bases. The same technique as used for the Britannia Bridge was also used on the smaller Conwy Railway Bridge, which was built around the same time. On 10 August 1847, the first rivet was driven.

Working in parallel to the onsite construction process, the two central tube sections, which weighed apiece, were separately built on the nearby Caernarfon shoreline. Once they had been fully assembled, each of the central tubes was floated, one at a time, into the causeway and directly below the structure. The in-place sections were gradually raised into place using powerful hydraulic cylinders; they were only raised by a few inches at a time, after which supports would be built underneath the section to keep it in place. This aspect of the bridge&#x27;s construction was novel at the time. Reportedly, the innovative process had been responsible for costing Stephenson several nights of sleep at one stage of the project. The work did not go smoothly; at one point, one of the tubes allegedly came close to being swept out to sea before being recaptured and finally pushed back into place. The tubes were manoeuvred into place between June 1849 and February 1850.

Once in place, the separate lengths of tube were joined to form parallel prestressed continuous structures, each one possessing a length of and weighing . The pre-stressing process had increased the structure&#x27;s loadbearing capacity and reduced deflection. The tubes had a width of and differed between and in overall depth, while also having a gap between them; they were supported on a series of cast iron beams that were embedded in the stonework of the towers. To better protect the iron from the weather, an arched timber roof was constructed to cover both tubes; it was roughly wide, continuous over their whole length, and covered with tarred hessian. A wide central walkway was present above the roof for the purpose of producing maintenance access.

On 5 March 1850, Stephenson himself fitted the last rivet of the structure, marking the bridge&#x27;s official completion. Altogether, the bridge had taken over three years to complete. On 18 March 1850, a single tube was opened to rail traffic. By 21 October of that year, both tubes had been opened to traffic.

For its time, the Britannia Bridge was a structure of &quot;magnitude and singular novelty&quot;, far surpassing in length both contemporary cast beam or plate girder iron bridges. The noted engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a professional rival and personal friend of Stephenson&#x27;s, was claimed to have remarked to him: &quot;If your bridge succeeds, then mine have all been magnificent failures&quot;. On 20 June 1849, Brunel and Stephenson had both looked on as the first of the bridge&#x27;s tubes was floated out on its pontoons. The construction techniques employed on the Britannia Bridge had obviously influenced Brunel as he later made use of the same method of floating bridge sections during the construction of the Royal Albert Bridge across the River Tamar at Saltash.

There was originally a railway station located on the east side of the bridge at the entrance to the tunnel, run by the Chester and Holyhead Railway company, which served local rail traffic in both directions. However, this station was closed after only years in operation owing to low passenger volumes. In the present day, little remains of this station, other than the remnants of the lower-level station building. A new station named Menai Bridge was opened shortly afterwards.

=== Lions ===

The bridge was decorated by four large lions sculpted in limestone by John Thomas, two at either end. Each was constructed from 11 pieces of limestone. They are long, tall, and weigh 30 tons.

These were immortalised in the following Welsh rhyme by the bard John Evans (1826–1888), who was born in nearby Menai Bridge:

&lt;poem&gt;
Pedwar llew tew
Heb ddim blew
Dau &#x27;ochr yma
A dau &#x27;ochr drew
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Four fat lions
Without any hair
Two on this side
And two over there
&lt;/poem&gt;

The lions cannot be seen from the A55, which crosses the modern bridge on the same site, although they can be seen from trains on the North Wales Coast Line below. The idea of raising them to road level has been suggested by local campaigners from time to time.

== Fire and reconstruction ==

During the evening of 23 May 1970, the bridge was heavily damaged when boys playing inside the structure dropped a burning torch, setting alight the tar-coated wooden roof of the tubes. Despite the best efforts of the Caernarfonshire and Anglesey fire brigades, the bridge&#x27;s height, construction, and the lack of an adequate water supply meant they were unable to control the fire, which spread all the way across from the mainland to the Anglesey side. After the fire had burned itself out, the bridge was still standing. However, the structural integrity of the iron tubes had been critically compromised by the intense heat; they had visibly split open at the three towers and had begun to sag. It was recognised that there was still danger of the structure collapsing; the bridge would be unusable until major restorative work was done.

In light of events, the chief civil engineer of British Railways&#x27; London Midland region, W.F. Beatty, sought structural advice from consulting engineering company Husband &amp; Co. Following an in-depth investigation of the site performed by the company, it was determined that the cast iron beams inside the towers had suffered substantial cracking and tilting, meaning that the tubes required immediate support at all three towers. The Royal Engineers were quickly brought in to save the bridge, rapidly deploying vertical Bailey bridge units to fill the original jacking slots in the masonry towers. By the end of July 1970, a total of eight Bailey bridge steel towers had been erected, each being capable of bearing a vertical load of around 200 tonnes.

Further analysis showed that the wrought iron tubes had been too badly damaged to be retained. In light of this discovery, it was decided to dismantle the tubes in favour of replacing them with a new deck at the same level as the original tracks. With the exception of the original stone substructure, the structure was completely rebuilt by Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company. The superstructure of the new bridge was to include two decks: a lower rail deck supported by steel arches and an upper deck constructed out of reinforced concrete, to carry a new road crossing over the strait. Concrete supports were built under the approach spans and steel archways constructed under the long spans on either side of the central Britannia Tower. The two long spans are supported by arches, which had not been an option for the original structure as a result of the clearance needed for tall-masted vessels; modern navigational requirements require much less headroom.

The bridge was rebuilt in stages. The first stage was to erect the new steel arches under the two original wrought-iron tubes. The arches were completed, and single-line working was restored to the railway on 30 January 1972 by reusing one of the tubes. The next stage was to dismantle and remove the other tube and replace it with a concrete deck for the other rail track. Then the single-line working was transferred to the new track (on the west side); this allowed the other tube to be removed and replaced with a concrete deck (which is used only for service access) by 1974. Finally the upper road deck was installed and by July 1980, over 10 years after the fire, the new road crossing was completed, and formally opened by the Prince of Wales, carrying a single-carriageway section of the A5 road (now the A55).

During 2011, national railway infrastructure owner Network Rail, the Welsh Assembly Government and the English Highways Agency undertook a £4 million joint programme to strengthen the 160-year-old structure and improve its reliability. The work involved the replacement of eroded steelwork, repairs to the drainage system, restoration of the parapets and stonework, and the painting of the steel approach portals of the bridge. The programme included a detailed inspection of the internal chambers of the three towers and the construction of a special walkway to enable easier and safer access to the structure for future inspections of the masonry piers; special protective efforts adopted for the work included the use of special pollution-minimising paint and the decontamination of all equipment before being brought onsite.

== Proposed bridge improvement ==
In November 2007, a public consultation exercise into the ‘A55 Britannia Bridge Improvement’ commenced. The perceived problems stated include:
* It is the only non-dual-carriageway section along the A55
* Congestion during morning and afternoon peak periods
* Congestion from seasonal and ferry traffic from Holyhead
* Queuing at the junctions at either end
* Traffic is expected to significantly increase over the next ten years or so

In the document, four options are presented, each with their own pros and cons:
* Do nothing. Congestion will increase as traffic levels increase.
* Widen existing bridge. To do this, the towers would have to be removed to make room for the extra lanes. This is an issue as the bridge is a Grade 2 listed structure and is owned by Network Rail. The extra lanes would have to be of reduced width as the existing structure is not capable of supporting four full-width lanes.
* New multi-span concrete box bridge alongside. Building a separate bridge would allow the existing bridge to be used as normal during construction. The bridge would require support pillar(s) in the Menai Strait, which is an environmental issue as the strait is a Special Area of Conservation. Visual impact would be low as the pillars and road surface would be aligned with the current bridge.
*New single span cable-stayed bridge. This would eliminate the need for pillars in the Strait, but the bridge would have a large impact on the landscape due to the height of the cable support pillars. This is also the most costly option.

Respondents were overwhelmingly in favour of seeing some improvements, with 70 per cent favouring the solution of building another bridge.

== Similar bridges ==
Very few other tubular iron bridges were ever built since more economical bridge designs were soon developed. The most notable of the other tubular bridges were Stephenson&#x27;s Conwy railway bridge between Llandudno Junction and Conwy, the first Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue (Québec) Grand Trunk Railway bridge, which was the prototype of the Victoria Bridge across the Saint Lawrence River at Montreal.

The Conwy railway bridge remains in use, and is the only remaining tubular bridge; however, intermediate piers have been added to strengthen it. The bridge can be seen at close quarters from Thomas Telford&#x27;s adjacent 1826 Conwy Suspension Bridge.

The Victoria Bridge was the first bridge to cross the St. Lawrence River, and was the longest bridge in the world when it was completed in 1859. It was rebuilt as a truss bridge in 1898.

<text>Michael Anthony Farren (3 September 1943 – 27 July 2013) was an English rock musician, singer, journalist, and author associated with counterculture and the UK underground, who had a significant influence on the development of British proto punk garage rock music.

==Early life==
Farren was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and after moving to Worthing, Sussex, attended Worthing High School for Boys, which was a state grammar school. In 1963, he moved to London, where he studied at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art.

==Music==
Farren was the singer with the proto-punk garage rock R&amp;B band The Deviants between 1967 and 1969, releasing three albums.
During 1970 he released the solo album &quot;Mona – The Carnivorous Circus&quot;, which also featured Steve Peregrin Took, John Gustafson and Paul Buckmaster, before ending his music business to concentrate on writing.

During the mid-1970s, he briefly revived his musical career, releasing the single &quot;Play With Fire&quot; featuring Marky Bell (later in The Ramones) , Jon Tiven, and Doug Snyder, the EP &quot;Screwed Up&quot;, album &quot;Vampires Stole My Lunch Money&quot; and single &quot;Broken Statue&quot;. The album featured fellow &quot;New Musical Express (NME)&quot; journalist Chrissie Hynde and Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson. He also contributed song ideas and music for short-lived Ladbroke Grove ensemble Warsaw Pakt&#x27;s 1977 &quot;Needle Time&quot; LP.

He sporadically did musical work after that, collaborating with MC5&#x27;s Wayne Kramer on &quot;Who Shot You Dutch?&quot; and &quot;Death Tongue&quot;, Jack Lancaster on &quot;The Deathray Tapes&quot; and Andy Colquhoun on The Deviants albums &quot;Eating Jello With a Heated Fork&quot; and &quot;Dr. Crow&quot;.

Aside from his own work, he provided lyrics for various musician friends over the years. He collaborated with Ian Fraser Kilmister (Lemmy), co-writing &quot;Lost Johnny&quot; for Hawkwind, and &quot;Keep Us on the Road&quot; and &quot;Damage Case&quot; for Motörhead. With Larry Wallis, he co-wrote &quot;When&#x27;s the Fun Begin?&quot; for the Pink Fairies and several tracks on Wallis&#x27; solo album &quot;Death in the Guitafternoon&quot;. He provided lyrics for the Wayne Kramer single &quot;Get Some&quot; during the mid-1970s, and continued to work with and for him during the 1990s.

==Writing==
During the early 1970s he contributed to the UK Underground press such as the &quot;International Times&quot;, also establishing &quot;Nasty Tales&quot; which he successfully defended from an obscenity charge. He later wrote for the mainstream &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, for which he wrote the article &quot;The Titanic Sails At Dawn&quot;, an analysis of what he considered the malaise afflicting then-contemporary rock music and which described the conditions that subsequently resulted in punk.

He wrote 23 novels, including the &quot;Victor Renquist&quot; novels and the &quot;DNA Cowboys&quot; sequence. His 1989 novel &quot;The Armageddon Crazy&quot; dealt with a post-2000 United States dominated by fundamentalists who subvert the Constitution. He began writing fantasy literature in the 70s.

Farren wrote eleven works of non-fiction, including a number of biographical (including four on Elvis Presley), autobiographical and culture books (such as &quot;The Black Leather Jacket&quot;), and much poetry.

From 2003 to 2008, he was a columnist for the weekly newspaper &quot;Los Angeles CityBeat&quot;.

In his 3 May 2010 Doc40 blog, Farren announced that he was writing another Victor Renquist novel, with the working title of &quot;Renquist V&quot;.
In 2013, he worked with digital imprint Ink Monkey Books on audio inserts (with Andy Colquhoun of The Deviants) for reissues of &quot;The Texts of Festival &quot;and the &quot;DNA Cowboys sequence&quot;.

<doc id="886286" wikidata="Q6643442" url="?curid=886286" title="List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders">
<text>This is a list of the 300 Major League Baseball players who have hit the most career home runs in regular season play (i.e., excluding playoffs or exhibition games). 

In the sport of baseball, a home run is a hit in which the batter scores by circling all the bases and reaching home plate in one play, without the benefit of a fielding error. This can be accomplished either by hitting the ball out of play while it is still in fair territory (a conventional home run) or by an inside-the-park home run.

Barry Bonds holds the Major League Baseball home run record with 762. He passed Hank Aaron, who hit 755, on August 7, 2007. The only other players to have hit 700 or more are Babe Ruth with 714, and Albert Pujols with 703. Alex Rodriguez (696), Willie Mays (660), Ken Griffey Jr. (630), Jim Thome (612), and Sammy Sosa (609) are the only other players to have hit 600 or more. Giancarlo Stanton is the active home run leader with 429.

Players in bold face are active as of the 2025 Major League Baseball season (including free agents), with the number in parentheses designating the number of home runs they have hit during the 2025 season. The last change in the cutoff for the top 300 occurred on September 22, 2024 when Jose Altuve hit his 229th career home run, tying Nomar Garciaparra and Jayson Werth.

<doc id="886294" wikidata="Q489890" url="?curid=886294" title="Kokand">
<text>Kokand ( ) is a city in Fergana Region in eastern Uzbekistan, at the southwestern edge of the Fergana Valley. Administratively, Kokand is a district-level city, that includes the urban-type settlement Muqimiy. The population of Kokand was approximately 259,700. The city lies southeast of Tashkent, west of Andijan, and west of Fergana. It is nicknamed &quot;City of Winds&quot;.

In 1877, when the first ethnographic works were done under the new imperial Russian administration, Kokand was reported and visually depicted on their maps as Tajik inhabited oasis (C.E de Ujfalvy (“Carte Ethnographique du Ferghanah, 1877”). The city, along with most of the eastern Fergana Valley, was included in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic in the 1920s as part of national delimitation in the Soviet Union.

Kokand is at the crossroads of the two main ancient trade routes into the Fergana Valley, one leading northwest over the mountains to Tashkent, and the other west through Khujand. As a result, Kokand is the main transportation junction in the Fergana Valley.

== Etymology ==

The city&#x27;s name is in conformity with other Central Asian cities that sport the element &quot;kand/kent/qand/jand&quot;, meaning &quot;a city&quot; in Sogdian as well as other Iranic languages. The Khwarazmian version was &quot;kath&quot;, which is still found in the name of the old city of Akhsikath/Akhsikat in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan. The prefix &quot;khu/hu&quot; is Iranic might stand &quot;good&quot; (as in modern Tajik &quot;khub&quot;), and would therefore translate as &quot;good city&quot;. 

Another explanation claims a Turkic derivation, and might refer to the &quot;tribal family group of &#x27;Kokan&#x27; who belong to the Kongrat tribe of Uzbeks&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early History ===
The town of Kokand is one of the oldest towns in Uzbekistan and is situated in the western part of Fergana Valley. In the chronicles of the 10th century, the first written documents concerning town of Hukande, Havokande (old names of the town). In the 13th century, like most of Central Asian towns, the Mongols ruined the city. The town is a significant hub for trading on the Silk Route.

Kokand has existed since at least the 10th century, under the name of Khavakand, and was frequently mentioned in traveler&#x27;s accounts of the caravan route between South Asia and East Asia. The Han dynasty of China conquered the entire city in the 1st century BC. Later, the Arabs conquered the region from Tang Empire. The Mongols destroyed Kokand in the 13th century.

=== Foundation and Uzbek period ===
The present city was founded as a fort in 1732 on the site of another older fortress called Eski-Kurgan by Shahrukh Uzbek ruler of Ferghana. In 1740, city became the capital of an Uzbek kingdom, the Khanate of Kokand, which reached as far as Kyzylorda to the west and Bishkek to the northeast. Kokand was also the major religious center of the Fergana Valley, boasting more than 300 mosques.

=== Russian colonial period ===
Imperial forces of Russian Empire under Mikhail Skobelev captured the city in 1883 which then became part of Russian Turkistan. During World War I, two revolutions happened in the Russian Empire. it was the capital of the short-lived (72 days) (1917–18) anti-Bolshevik Provisional Government of Autonomous Turkistan (also known as Kokand Autonomy). They sought co-operation from Ataman Dutov and Alash Orda. However, their emissary to the Amir of Bukhara achieved little.

In September 1918, Bolsheviks burned down the city and massacred over ten thousand citizens during their campaign against the Basmachi movement. 

In the state of Dayuan

Archaeological research of Muyi Mubarak, Tepakurgan, Eski Kurgan and other monuments located in the city of Kokand revealed traces of civilization.

In Muyi Mubarak were found several clay shards of the 5th to 6th centuries; a clay platform, which in the 5th to 7th centuries served as the base of a monumental building; the remains of a fortress wall, built in the 1st to 2nd centuries of pahsa and mudbricks, which functioned for more than 400 years. At a depth of 5 meters, a lower cultural layer with materials dating back 2,000 years was discovered.

In Tepakurgan, located in the center of the city, a platform from the Early Middle Ages, which served as the base of a monumental castle with semicircular towers, was discovered, as in Muyi Mubarak.

The obtained artifacts give grounds to say and speculate that not later than the 7th century BC a certain part of the territory of the present city was developed for irrigated agriculture.

And the city appeared not later than the 2nd half of the 2nd century BC and was the center of the Sokh oasis, that is, the capital of the regional possession, which was part of the confederal state of Fergana (&quot;Dayuan&quot; of Chinese annals).

Havokand or Hokand

Arab geographers and travelers of the 10th century, Al-Istakhri and Ibn Haukal mention the city of Khovakand or Khokand, which in distance corresponds to the present Kokand.

According to written sources and local legends, there were ancient cities of Akhsikath, Kubo (Quva), Rishton, Osh, Bab (Pop), Koson (Kashan), Mo-ar-gilon (Margilan), Andigan (Andijan), Uzgen, Isfara, Varukh, Sokh, Konibodom and Khujand in Fergana already at the time of its conquest by Arabs who established Islam here (in the beginning of the 8th century).

Arab travelers of the 10th century mention many other towns and generally notice that, besides towns, there were many large villages in Fergana.

Havokand or Hokand, located on the Silk Road between India and China on one side and Persia and the Near East on the other, may have been a major trade center of its time. It was destroyed by the mongolic peoples in the 13th century.

== Main sights ==

=== The Palace of Khudayar Khan ===
The Palace of Khudayar Khan was built between 1863 and 1874 by ruler Muhammad Khudayar Khan. American diplomat Eugene Schulyer described it as being &quot;much larger and more magnificent than any other [palace] in Central Asia.”

Khudayar Khan commissioned architect Mir Ubaydullo to build him a royal residence with 114 rooms set around seven courtyards. The ruler wanted his mother to live in one of the palace&#x27;s grand buildings, but she refused and set up her yurt in a courtyard.

The facade of the building is decorated with mosaic tiles and an Arabic inscription above the entrance. The inscription translates as “The High palace of Seid Mohammad Khudayar Khan”.

Most of the palace, including its harem, was demolished by the Soviets, but 19 rooms remain in palace. These are open to the public, and the interiors have been partially restored. They show a combination of Russian and traditional Uzbek styles, and the exquisite craftsmanship of Kokand&#x27;s 19th-century artisans. It is possible to view the palace&#x27;s collection of Chinese ceramics on request.

=== Juma Mosque ===
Kokand&#x27;s Juma Mosque (Friday Mosque) is located on Chursu Square in the historic Icheri Sheher part of the city. It was built between 1812 and 1818 by Muhammad Umar Khan, who was ruler of Kokand from 1810 until his death in 1822.

The mosque is built around a large courtyard and has a 100m long iwan supported on 98 redwood columns, which are ornately carved and were brought from India. The minaret is 22m high.

Although intended to be Kokand&#x27;s main place of worship, the Juma Mosque remained shut for most of the 20th century. It then reopened after much needed restoration in 1989 and now houses a small museum of applied arts with displays of embroideries and ceramics.

=== Amin Beg Madrassah ===
The Amin Beg Madrassah, a religious school, was built in the 1830s for a son of Madali Khan, the khan of Kokand from 1822 to 1842. The madrassah has a beautifully tiled facade, which was restored in 1913 by a craftsman called Khomol Khozi. For this reason, the madrassah is often called the Khomol Khozi Madrassah. Today, the building houses a small museum and a shop, but the tiles and the carved wooden columns are still impressive to look at.

=== Hamza Museum ===
Built in 1989, the Hamza Museum is named after Hamza Hakimzade Niyazi, a Soviet hero who was born in Kokand. Hamza was Uzbekistan&#x27;s first national poet and the founder of Uzbek social realism, and the museum was opened to commemorate the centenary of his birth. The museum houses general exhibits about life in Kokand, and also has artefacts relating to a variety of dramatists, propagandists, and writers.

=== Additional Sites ===
There are three other historic madrassahs in Kokand. The 19th-century Shaib Mian Hazrat Madrasa has a small museum dedicated to the poet Mohammad Amin Muqimi (1850–1903).

The Narbutabey Madrassah was built in the 1790s. Its graveyard includes the tomb of Muhammad Umar Khan and his wife, the famous Uzbek poet Nodira. Known as the Modari Khan Mausoleum, it is ornately decorated with glazed blue mosaic tiles. Unlike the other madrassahs in Kokand which were closed by the Soviets, the Narbutabey Madrassah remained active as a place of Quranic study until 2016.

The last madrassah is the Dasturkahanchi Madrasa. It was built in 1833 as a school for boys, but it is now a training centre where girls learn embroidery.

== Education and culture ==

A number of madrasahs can be found with the city. Kokand made contribution to Islam. It is also home to a number of notable hanafi scholars, such as Abdulhafiz Al-Quqoniy and Yorqinjon Qori Al-Quqoniy.

&quot;Kokand State Pedagocical Institute&quot;, 9 colleges and lyceums, 40 secondary schools, 5 musical schools, a theater, and 20 libraries. There are 7 historical and house museums located in Kokand.

The first International Handicrafters Festival took place in Kokand in September 2019. It was hosted by the Uzbekistan Handicraft Association, and the guest of honour was Rosy Greenlees, President of the World Crafts Council. More than 600 creatives from 70 countries participated.

The festival was created to enable artisans from around the world to demonstrate and sell their products, as well as to network and further develop their skills. The festival included conference sessions dedicated to developing hand craftsmanship. The crafts on display included musical instruments, painting, ceramics, textiles, metalwork, and woodwork.

It is planned that the festival will be a biennial event, and it will next take place in 2021.

== Economy ==
The black market provides nearly 75% of the income generated in the borders of the city. This includes retail, groceries, employment, money exchange, agriculture and manufacturing of many goods. A large part of the population works as small business owners in outdoor markets.

Kokand is a center for the manufacture of fertilizers, chemicals, machinery, and cotton and food products. Over the last two decades, new districts and public buildings have been created in the city as well as many houses, shops, cafes, restaurants and other private sector ventures. Kokand is an education center with one institute, nine colleges and lyceums, and numerous museums.

<text>Phun City was a rock festival held at Ecclesden Common near Worthing, England, from 24 July to 26 July 1970. Excluding the one-day free concerts in London&#x27;s Hyde Park, Phun City became the first large-scale free festival in the UK.

==History==
Organised by the UK Underground anarchist Mick Farren and financed by Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly, the festival was notable for having no fences and no admission fees. It was not intended to be a free concert, but funding was withdrawn a few days before the event. Rather than cancel it, the organisers told the scheduled bands who turned up that they would have to give their services for nothing. Remarkably, most of the acts stayed on. Free were billed to play, but withdrew – Farren later noted in his memoirs the irony of a band named Free refusing to play for free. Those who did appear included MC5, The Pretty Things, Kevin Ayers, Steve Peregrin Took&#x27;s band Shagrat, Edgar Broughton Band, Mungo Jerry, Mighty Baby and Pink Fairies &quot;who were taking all their clothes off as they played&quot;. The Beat generation poet William Burroughs also appeared. 

The Hells Angels – UK had been hired as the security force, but Farren said, &quot;It slowly dawned on us that although none of our original plans had come together, we were no longer in control.&quot; Instead, the audience themselves were now in charge, with the organizers just making sure the bands came and went – it was, if somewhat inadvertently, the first large-scale &quot;people&#x27;s festival&quot; held in the UK.

The poster art was by Edward Barker.

==Legacy==
Camping at the festival, Worthing teenager Billy Idol saw MC5 play, saying later &quot;I didn&#x27;t realize it then but I had just seen the future of rock&quot;. Mick Jones another future punk pioneer was also enthusiastic &quot;That was the first time MC5 had played. My overriding memory was falling into a ditch! That was a great festival&quot;.

<text>The British counter-culture or underground scene developed during the mid-1960s, and was linked to the hippie subculture of the United States. Its primary focus was around Ladbroke Grove and Notting Hill in London. It generated its own magazines and newspapers, bands, clubs and alternative lifestyle, associated with cannabis and LSD use and a strong socio-political revolutionary agenda to create an alternative society.

==Beat generation influence==
Many in the blossoming underground movement were influenced by 1950s Beat generation writers such as William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, who paved the way for the hippies and the counterculture of the 1960s. During the 1960s, the Beat writers engaged in symbiotic evolution with freethinking academics including experimental psychologist Timothy Leary.

An example of the cross-over of beat poetry and music can be seen when Burroughs appeared at the Phun City festival, organised in 24–26 July 1970 by Mick Farren with underground community bands including The Pretty Things, Kevin Ayers, Edgar Broughton Band, Pink Fairies, Shagrat, and, from the United States, the MC5.

==History==
The UK&#x27;s underground movement was focused on the Ladbroke Grove/Notting Hill area of London, which Mick Farren said &quot;was an enclave of freaks, immigrants and bohemians long before the hippies got there&quot;. It had been depicted in Colin MacInnes&#x27; novel &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;, about street culture at the time of the Notting Hill Riots in the 1950s.

The underground paper &quot;International Times&quot; (IT) began to appear in 1966 and Steve Abrams, founder of &quot;Soma&quot;, summarised the underground as a &quot;literary and artistic avant-garde with a large contingent from Oxford and Cambridge. John Hopkins (Hoppy), a member of the editorial board of &quot;International Times&quot; for example, was trained as a physicist at Cambridge.&quot;

Police harassment of members of the underground (often referred to as &quot;freaks&quot;, initially by others as an insult, and later by themselves as an act of defiance) became commonplace, particularly against the underground press. According to Farren, &quot;Police harassment, if anything, made the underground press stronger. It focused attention, stiffened resolve, and tended to confirm that what we were doing was considered dangerous to the establishment.&quot;

Key underground (community) bands of the time who often performed at benefit gigs for various worthy causes included Pink Floyd (when they still had Syd Barrett), Soft Machine, Tomorrow, Pretty Things, The Deviants (featuring Mick Farren), Tyrannosaurus Rex, Edgar Broughton Band, Hawkwind, Pink Fairies (featuring Twink and ex-The Deviants), Shagrat (featuring Steve Peregrin Took, Mick Farren (early lineup), and Larry Wallis); key people included, in the late &#x27;60s, Marc Bolan, who would leave &quot;the Grove&quot; to find fame with T. Rex, and his partner Steve Peregrin Took, who remained in Ladbroke Grove and continued to perform benefit gigs in the anti-commercial ethos of the UK underground.

Within Portobello Road stood the Mountain Grill, a greasy spoon cafe, which in the late 1960s and early 1970s was frequented by several UK underground artists, including Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies. In 1974, Hawkwind released an album titled &quot;Hall Of The Mountain Grill&quot; and Steve Peregrin Took wrote &quot;Ballad of the Mountain Grill&quot; (aka &quot;Flophouse Blues&quot;).

==Commentators==
Mick Farren said,

==Lifestyle==
The underground movement was heavily symbolised by the use of drugs. The types of drugs used were varied and in many cases the names and effects were unknown as The Deviants/Pink Fairies member Russell Hunter, working at &quot;International Times&quot; (part of the underground press at the time), recalled. &quot;People used to send in all kinds of strange drugs and things, pills and powders, stuff to smoke and that. They&#x27;d always give them to me to try to find out what they were! [Laughs]&quot;.

Part of the sense of humour of the underground, no doubt partly induced by the effects of both drugs and radical thinking, was an enjoyment at &quot;freakin&#x27; out the norms&quot;. Mick Farren recalls actions sure to elicit the required response. &quot;The band&#x27;s baroque House of Usher apartment on London&#x27;s Shaftesbury Avenue had witnessed pre-Raphaelite hippy scenes, like Sandy the bass player (of The Deviants and Pink Fairies), Tony the now and again keyboard player, and a young David Bowie, fresh from Beckenham Arts Lab, sunbathing on the roof, taking photos of each other and posing coyly as sodomites&quot;.

==Aesthetics==
The image of the underground as manifested in magazines such as &quot;Oz&quot; and newspapers like &quot;International Times&quot; was dominated by key talented graphic artists, particularly Martin Sharp and the Nigel Waymouth–Michael English team, Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, who fused Alfons Mucha&#x27;s Art Nouveau arabesques with the higher colour key of psychedelia. British Television played a substantial role in representing the UK underground and counter-culture movement; At the beginning of the 1960s, three-quarters of the British population had a television, and the number rose to 90% by 1964.

==The overground==
There was a smaller, less widely spread manifestation from the UK underground termed the &quot;Overground&quot;, which referred to an explicitly spiritual, cosmic, quasi-religious intent, though this was an element that had always been present. At least two magazines—&quot;Gandalf&#x27;s Garden&quot; (6 issues, 1968–72) and &quot;Vishtaroon&quot;—adopted this &quot;overground&quot; style. &quot;Gandalf&#x27;s Garden&quot; was also a shop/restaurant/meeting place at World&#x27;s End, Chelsea. The magazines were printed on pastel paper using multi-coloured inks and contained articles about meditation, vegetarianism, mandalas, ethics, poetry, pacifism and other subjects at a distance from the more wild and militant aspects of the underground. The first issue of &quot;Gandalf&#x27;s Garden&quot; urged that we should &quot;seek to stimulate our own inner gardens if we are to save our Earth and ourselves from engulfment.&quot; It was edited by Muz Murray who is now called Ramana Baba and teaches yoga.

These attitudes were embodied musically in The Incredible String Band, who in 2003 were described as &quot;holy&quot; by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, in a foreword for the book &quot;Be Glad: An Incredible String Band Compendium&quot; (Helter Skelter Books). He had previously chosen the band&#x27;s track &quot;The Hedgehog&#x27;s Song&quot; as his only piece of popular music on the radio programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;). The critic Ian MacDonald said: &quot;Much that appeared to be profane in Sixties youth culture was quite the opposite&quot;.

<text>Explorer 35, (IMP-E, AIMP-2, Anchored IMP-2, Interplanetary Monitoring Platform-E), was a spin-stabilized spacecraft built by NASA as part of the Explorer program. It was designed for the study of the interplanetary plasma, magnetic field, energetic particles, and solar X-rays, from lunar orbit.

== Spacecraft ==
Explorer 35 was similar to the earlier Explorer 33. The spacecraft mass was . The main body of the spacecraft was an octagonal prism, across and high. Four arrays containing 6144 n/p solar cells, providing an average of 70 watts power, extended from the main bus, along with two magnetometer booms. Four whip antennas are mounted on top of the spacecraft. A retrorocket was mounted on top of the bus. Power was stored in silver–cadmium batteries (Ag-Cd). Communication (PFM telemetry) was via a 7-watts transmitter and a digital data processor. The science payload had a mass of and included two 3-axis magnetometers, low energy protons and alpha energy analyzer, low energy protons and electrons detector, energetic particle detector, plasma probe, a micrometeorite detector, a solar cell damage experiment, and gravity field and bistatic radar experiments.

== Mission ==
Part of the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform program, it was of a design similar to Explorer 33 (IMP-D / AIMP-1), which launched in 1966. However, Explorer 34 (IMP-F), with a different design and mission objectives, was launched about two months prior to IMP-E. Explorer 41 (IMP-G) was the next IMP spacecraft to fly after Explorer 35, in 1969. It was also designed to study the Moon&#x27;s gravity field, ionosphere and micrometeorite and dust distribution. The spin axis direction was nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, and the spin rate was 25.6 rpm.

== Launch ==
Explorer 35 was launched on 19 July 1967 from the Eastern Test Range of Cape Kennedy on a Thor-Delta E1 (Thrust Augmented Delta - TAD). It went on a direct ascent trajectory, reaching the Moon on 22 July 1967. It entered an initial altitude elliptical lunar orbit at 147° inclination after a 23-seconds retrorocket burn. The main engine separated 2 hours later. Explorer 35 operated normally in lunar orbit for 6 years until it was shut off on 24 June 1973.

== Experiments ==
=== AMES Magnetic Fields ===
The Ames magnetometer experiment consisted of a boom-mounted triaxial fluxgate magnetometer and an electronics package. The sensors were orthogonally mounted, with one sensor oriented along the spin axis of the spacecraft. A motor interchanged a sensor in the spin plane with the sensor along the spin axis every 24 hours, allowing inflight calibration. The instrument package included a circuit for demodulating the outputs from the sensors in the spin plane. The noise threshold was about 0.2 nT. The instrument had three ranges covering ± 20, 60, and 200 nT full scale for each vector component. The digitization accuracy for each range was 1% of the entire range covered. The magnetic field vector was measured instantaneously, and the instrument range was changed after each measurement. A period of 2.05-seconds elapsed between adjacent measurements and a period of 6.14-seconds elapsed between measurements using the same range. The instrument performance was normal.

Explorer 35 provided important reference data for magnetic field measurements taken on the Moon during the Apollo program.

=== Bistatic Radar Observations of the Lunar Surface ===
The purpose of this experiment was to study the electromagnetic reflective properties of the lunar surface. The 136.10-Hz () telemetry transmissions from the spacecraft were scattered from the lunar surface and then recorded by use of the Stanford dish antenna. The reflected signal intensity depended upon the lunar reflectivity, the spacecraft altitude above the lunar surface, and the mean curvature of the Moon. The returned signal bandwidth was proportional to RMS lunar surface slopes. Occultation phenomena permitted a determination of the scattering properties of the lunar limb. The dielectric constant of the lunar subsurface in the scattering region below a depth of about was then determined from a profile of reflectivity values versus the angle of incidence on the Moon. The mean lunar slope over each area from which signals were reflected has also been inferred. The observations were located within about 10° of the lunar equator. Experiment operation was normal as of March 1971.

=== Electron and Proton Detectors ===
Three EON type 6213 Geiger–Müller tubes (GM1, GM2, and GM3) and a silicon solid-state detector (SSD) provided measurements of solar X-rays (GM1 only, between 2 and 12 A) and charged particles in the vicinity of the Moon. GM1 and GM3 measured electrons of energies greater than 48 to 50 keV and protons of energy greater than 740 to 820 keV, while GM2 was shielded by a cap with approximately 1 gram per cm2 (limiting its response to protons of energies greater than about 55 MeV). The SSD output was discriminated at four thresholds: (1) PN1, which detected protons between 0.32 and 6.3 MeV, (2) PN2, which detected protons between 0.48 and 3.0 MeV, (3) PN4, which detected alpha particles between 2 and 10.2 MeV, and (4) PN3, which was sensitive to particles of Z greater than 3, including carbon-12 between 0.58 and 9.5 MeV per nucleon, nitrogen-14 between 0.514 and 13.9 MeV per nucleon, and oxygen-16 between 0.466 and 18.8 MeV per nucleon. GM1 and SSD were oriented perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis, GM2 was oriented parallel to the spin axis, and GM3 was oriented antiparallel to the spin axis. Data from GM1, PN1, and PN4 were divided into data from quadrants oriented with respect to the Sun (sectors I, II, III, and IV were centered 180°, 270°, 0°, and 90° away from the Sun, respectively). Data were read out every 82- or 164-seconds, and the experiment performance was normal.

=== Energetic Particle ===
This experiment consisted of a Neher-type ionization chamber and two Lionel type 205 HT Geiger–Müller tubes (GM). The ion chamber responded omnidirectionally to electrons above 0.7 MeV and protons above 12 MeV. Both GM tubes were mounted parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. GM tube 1 detected electrons above 45 keV that were scattered off a gold foil. The acceptance cone for these electrons had a 70« full-angle and an axis of symmetry that was 20« off the spacecraft spin axis. GM tube 2 responded to electrons and protons above 22 and 300 keV, respectively, in an acceptance cone of 70° full-angle centered at the spacecraft spin axis. Both GM tubes responded omnidirectionally to electrons and protons of energies above 2.5 and 50 MeV, respectively. Pulses from the ion chamber and counts from each GM tube were accumulated for 39.72-seconds and read out every 40.96-seconds. In addition, the time between the first ion chamber pulses in an accumulation period was also telemetered. This experiment performed well initially.

=== GSFC Magnetometer ===
The experiment consisted of a boom-mounted triaxial fluxgate magnetometer. Each sensor had dual ranges of minus to plus 24 nT and 64 nT, with digitization resolutions of ± 0.094 nT and 0.250 nT, respectively. Zero level drift was checked by periodic reorientation of the sensors until 20 May 1969, when the flipper mechanism failed. Past this point, data analysis was more difficult as the zero level drift of the sensor parallel to the spacecraft spin axis was not readily determined. Spacecraft interference was less than 0.125 nT. One vector measurement was obtained each 5.12-seconds. The bandpass of the magnetometer was 0 to 5 Hz, with a 20-dB per decade decrease for higher frequencies. Except for the flipper failure, the experiment functioned normally from launch to spacecraft turnoff on 24 June 1973.

=== Low-Energy Integral Spectrum Measurement Experiment ===
A planar multi-grid sensor programmed as a retarding potential analyzer was used to observe the intensity of the electron and ion components of the low energy plasma near the Moon. Integral spectra were obtained for both ions and electrons in the energy range from 1 to 500 eV. A complete spectrum was obtained every 80-seconds.

=== Micrometeorite Flux ===
This experiment was designed to measure the ionization, momentum, speed, and direction of micrometeorites, using thin film charged detectors, induction devices, and microphones.

=== Plasma Probe ===
A multigrid, split-collector Faraday cup mounted on the equator of the spacecraft was used to study the directional intensity of solar wind positive ions and electrons with particular emphasis on the interaction of the solar wind with the moon. Twenty-seven integral current samples (requiring about 4.3 s) were taken in an energy-per-charge window from 80 to 2850 eV. Then the current was sampled in eight differential energy-per-charge windows between 50 and 5400 eV at the azimuth where the peak current appeared in the previous series of integral measurements. These measurements (integral and differential) took about 25 s. Both the sum and difference of collector currents were obtained for positive ions. Only the sum was obtained for electrons. A complete set of measurements (two collector plate sums and one difference for protons, and one collector plate sum for electrons) required 328 s. The experiment worked well from launch until its failure in July 1968.

=== Selenodetic Studies ===
Range and range-rate tracking data of the Explorer 35 satellite as it orbited the Moon were used to obtain selenodetic gravity field information based on the perturbations to the satellite orbit imparted by the lunar mass distribution.

== End of Mission ==
After successful operation for 6 years, the spacecraft was turned off on 24 June 1973. The orbit would have naturally decayed after this point, resulting in an impact on the Moon at an unknown time and location. Explorer 35 (or Explorer XXXV) was also known as the Anchored Interplanetary Monitoring Platform-2 (AIMP-2 or IMP-E).

<doc id="886306" wikidata="Q1765961" url="?curid=886306" title="International Times">
<text>International Times (it or IT) is the name of various underground newspapers, with the original title founded in London in 1966 and running until October 1973. Editors included John &quot;Hoppy&quot; Hopkins, David Mairowitz, Roger Hutchinson, Peter Stansill, Barry Miles, Jim Haynes and playwright Tom McGrath. Jack Moore, avant-garde writer William Levy and Mick Farren, singer of The Deviants, also edited at various periods.

The paper&#x27;s logo is a black-and-white image of Theda Bara, vampish star of silent films. The founders&#x27; intention had been to use an image of actress Clara Bow, 1920s &quot;It girl&quot;, but a picture of Theda Bara was used by accident and, once deployed, not changed. Paul McCartney donated to the paper as did Allen Ginsberg through his Committee on Poetry foundation.

The &quot;IT&quot; restarted first as an online archive in 2008, a move arranged by former &quot;IT&quot; editor and contributor Mike Lesser and financed by Littlewoods heir James Moores, and in 2011 relaunched as an online magazine publishing new material, following a suggestion by Lesser to poet and actor Heathcote Williams. Irish poet Niall McDevitt served as the first online editor of &quot;IT&quot;, a position later held by Williams until his death in 2017.

==History==

&quot;International Times&quot; was launched on 15 October 1966 at The Roundhouse at an &#x27;All Night Rave&#x27; featuring Soft Machine and Pink Floyd. The event promised a &#x27;Pop/Op/Costume/Masque/Fantasy-Loon/Blowout/Drag Ball&#x27; featuring &#x27;steel bands, strips, trips, happenings, movies&#x27;. The launch was described by Daevid Allen of Soft Machine as &quot;one of the two most revolutionary events in the history of English alternative music and thinking. The &quot;IT&quot; event was important because it marked the first recognition of a rapidly spreading socio-cultural revolution that had its parallel in the States.&quot;

From April 1967, and for some while later, the police raided the offices of &quot;International Times&quot; to try, it was alleged, to force the paper out of business. A benefit event labelled &quot;The 14 Hour Technicolor Dream&quot; took place at Alexandra Palace on 29 April 1967. Bands included Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, Soft Machine, The Move, and Sam Gopal Dream. Despite police harassment, the paper continued to grow, with financial help from Paul McCartney, a personal friend of editor Barry Miles. Published fortnightly, it became the leading British underground paper, its circulation peaking at around 40,000 copies in late 1968/early 1969, before another police raid, along with competition from newer publications such as &quot;Time Out&quot; led to declining sales and a financial crisis.

In response to another raid on the paper&#x27;s offices, London&#x27;s alternative press on one occasion succeeded, somewhat astonishingly, in pulling off what was billed as a &quot;reprisal attack&quot; on the police—prompting the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; headline &quot;Raid on the Yard&quot;. The paper &quot;Black Dwarf&quot; published a detailed floor-by-floor guide to Scotland Yard, complete with diagrams, descriptions of locks on particular doors and snippets of overheard conversation in the offices of Special Branch. The anonymous author, or &quot;blue dwarf,&quot; as he styled himself, described how he perused police files, and even claimed to have sampled named brands of whisky in the Commissioner&#x27;s office. A day or two later &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; announced that the &quot;raid&quot; had forced the police to withdraw and re-issue all security passes.

In 1970 a group of people from &quot;IT&quot;, led by photographer Graham Keen, launched &quot;Cyclops&quot;, &quot;The First English Adult Comic Paper.&quot;

==Later publications==
&quot;IT&quot; first ceased publication in October 1973, after being convicted for running contact ads for gay men. The name was revived by another publisher in May 1974 for three issues until October. In 1975, &quot;Maya&quot;, another underground publication, temporarily renamed itself &quot;IT - the International Times&quot;, until that title closed after the November issue. A new title of the same name launched the following month, continuing until March 1976 when it went into hiatus until resuming in January 1977, ceasing in August of that year.

Publications with the &quot;International Times&quot; title were published from January to December 1978, and again from April 1979 to June 1980. A single &#x27;festival issue&#x27; was produced in June 1982. The title was again revived in 1986, with three issues from January to March, the last time a paper publication of the IT name was printed.

The IT restarted as an online archive in 2008, a move arranged by former IT editor and contributor Mike Lesser and financed by Littlewoods heir James Moores. In 2011 it was relaunched as an online magazine publishing new material, following a suggestion by Lesser to poet and actor Heathcote Williams.

Irish poet Niall McDevitt served as the first online editor of &quot;IT&quot;, a position later held by Heathcote Williams until his death in 2017.
In 2016, the 50th anniversary of the first copy of the magazine, further editions of a paper version of IT began to be published starting with issue Zero. These were edited by Heathcote Ruthven.

International Times has also published two books. Both are poetry collections – &quot;Royal Babylon&quot; by Heathcote Williams, an attack on the British monarchy, and &quot;Porterloo&quot; by Niall McDevitt, a book satirising the Conservative Party and registering the counterculture of 2011-12.

Current editor-in-chief is Nick Victor.

==Contributors==

Many people who became prominent UK figures wrote for &quot;IT&quot;, including feminist critic Germaine Greer, poet and social commentator Jeff Nuttall, occultist Kenneth Grant, and DJ John Peel. There were many original contributions from underground writers such as Alexander Trocchi; William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg.

Leading editorial contributors to the late 1970s &quot;IT&quot; were Heathcote Williams, Max Handley, Mike Lesser, Eddie Woods (Amsterdam editor), and Chris Sanders.

In 1986 &quot;IT&quot; was relaunched by Tony Allen and Chris Brook. After three issues (Volume 86; issues 1,2,3) Allen left, and Brook continued with one more issue (Volume 86; issue 4). After various one-off issues into 1991, 2000 saw Brook and others create a web-based presence—initially through the alternative server &#x27;Phreak&#x27;, c. 1996.

There are currently two archive sources online: 1) a comprehensive archive scanned by previous contributors and editors, and a less extensive archive with some commentary.

==&quot;International Times&quot; archive==
International Times (NIIT) Archive is a free online archive of every issue of the &quot;International Times&quot;. It runs from a precursor to &quot;IT&quot;, The Longhair Times, released on April Fools&#x27; Day 1966 to an erroneously labelled &#x27;last issue&#x27;—a Xeroxed single sheet issue in 1994. The continuum of this journal, in fact, includes issues and web presence from the last editorial group (IT#4 Vol 1986) until the present day.

The &quot;IT Archive&quot; was launched on 16 July 2009 at the Idea Generation Gallery.

The &quot;IT Archive&quot; was founded by Mike Lesser supported by fellow contributors and editors of &quot;IT&quot; including Mick Farren, John &quot;Hoppy&quot; Hopkins, Dave Mairowitz, Peter Stansill and Heathcote Williams amongst others.

<text>The Plantin Press at Antwerp was one of the focal centers of the fine printed book in the 16th century.

==History==
Christophe Plantin (c. 1520–1589) of Touraine was trained as a bookbinder. He fled from Paris where at least one printer had recently been burned at the stake for heresy, and went to Antwerp. There he bound books, became a citizen, and by 1555 began to print books, at first for distribution by other publishers. The city was already an established center of printing woodcuts, engravings and books. Plantin took on an assistant, Jan Moretus (Moerentorf), who read Latin and Greek and could write correspondence in several modern languages. He became Plantin&#x27;s business manager, son-in-law and eventually his successor in the Plantin printing press. For over two hundred years the Plantin press had a monopoly, granted by the papacy, for the printing of liturgical formularies, including in Spain. In 1562, suspected of heresy, Plantin fled to France for two years. At an auction of his press, friends bought up his equipment on his behalf.

After 1564, when Plantin set up again in a new shop at the sign of De Gulden Passer (&quot;The Golden Compasses&quot;), the printers mark of the House of Plantin. It often appeared in a vignette on the title page of books from the press, depicting a compass, angels, and the motto &quot;Labore et Constancia&quot; (&quot;By Labor and Constancy&quot;) which epitomizes the life of the publisher. From about 1570 Plantin employed the engravers Jan Wierix and his brother Hieronymus.

Plantin&#x27;s successors continued the print at Antwerp until 1867.

==Today==
The building that housed the press is now the Plantin-Moretus Museum. It maintains a collection of printing tools and around 25,000 volumes related to the press. In 2001, the archives of Plantin Press were added to UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register.

==Works==
Like the printer Robert Estienne, Plantin exposed galley proofs of his works in front of his establishment and promised a reward to anyone who could find faults. Later Plantins were friends of the painter Peter Paul Rubens who did drawings for illustrations and also some portraits of the Plantin-Moretus family. Plantin was also a member of the Family of Love. He was a close friend of cartographer Abraham Ortel (a.k.a. Ortelius), genre painter Brueghel the Elder, and calligraphy master Clement Perret.

Some outstanding books published by the Plantin Press, by year:
* &quot;La Institutione di una Fanciulla Nata Nobilmente. L&#x27;Institution d&#x27;une Jeune Fille de Noble Maison. Traduuite de langue Tuscan en François.&quot; Plantin&#x27;s first printed book, a Tuscan manual on the education of young girls of good family.
* (an album of plates commemorating the funeral of the Emperor Charles V, 1559)
* &quot;Dictionarium Tetraglotton&quot; 1562. a dictionary in Greek, Latin, French and Flemish
* The Biblia Polyglotta, a Polyglot Bible, 1572. Plantin&#x27;s most famous project, in preparation since 1567, a bible in eight folio volumes, in Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Syriac and Aramaic.
* Abraham Ortelius, &quot;Theatrum orbis terrarum&quot; 1584 and 1598 (first published 1570)
**&quot;Theatrum orbis terrarum&quot;

* Henricus Sedulius, &quot;Apologeticus adversus Alcoranum Franciscanorum pro libro Conformitatum&quot; (Antwerp, 1607). An apology of the Franciscan order in response to Erasmus Alberus&#x27;s &quot;Alcoranus Franciscanorum&quot;.

<text>Máté Csák or Matthew III Csák (between 1260 and 1265 – 18 March 1321; , ), also Máté Csák of Trencsén (, ), was a Hungarian oligarch who ruled &quot;de facto&quot; independently the north-western counties of Medieval Hungary (today roughly the western half of present-day Slovakia and parts of Northern Hungary). He held the offices of master of the horse &quot;(főlovászmester)&quot; (1293–1296), palatine &quot;(nádor)&quot; (1296–1297, 1302–1309) and master of the treasury &quot;(tárnokmester)&quot; (1309–1311). He was able to maintain his rule over his territories even after his defeat at the Battle of Rozgony against King Charles I of Hungary. In the 19th century, he was often described as a symbol of the struggle for independence in both the Hungarian and Slovak literatures.

==Early years==
He was a son of the Palatine Peter I Csák, a member of the Hungarian &quot;genus&quot; (&quot;clan&quot;) Csák. Around 1283, Matthew and his brother, Csák, who later served as bearer of the sword (&quot;kardhordó&quot;) in 1293, inherited their father&#x27;s possessions, Komárom (Slovak: &quot;Komárno&quot;) and Szenic (Slovak: &quot;Senica&quot;). At about that time, they also inherited their uncles&#x27; (Matthew II and Stephen I Csák) possessions around Nagytapolcsány (Slovak: &quot;Veľké Topoľčany&quot;, now &quot;Topoľčany&quot;), Hrussó (Slovak: &quot;Hrušovo&quot;) and Tata. Their father had started to expand his influence over the territories that surrounded his possessions.

Matthew was born around 1260s. A diploma recorded his lameness which caused by either birth defect or a result of a war injury. He was presumably first mentioned by a charter issued by the Somogyvár Abbey on 5 August 1284, where the sons of the late Peter were summoned in a case of land title rights to Kötcse. Historian Gyula Kristó argues that the document mentions the possible elder brothers of Matthew and Csák as they first appeared in contemporary sources only in 1291. Following Peter&#x27;s death, the members of the rival Kőszegi family from the Héder clan strengthened in Pozsony and Sopron Counties taking advantage of that the Csák clan has been weakened due to the death of Matthew II and Peter I. The Kőszegis defeated the local Osl clan in Sopron County and also forged ahead to Pozsony County where captured Pozsony Castle for a short time.

==King Andrew&#x27;s partisan==

In 1291, Matthew took part in the campaign of King Andrew III of Hungary against Austria. In the next year, when Nicholas I Kőszegi rebelled against King Andrew III and occupied Pozsony (German: &quot;Pressburg&quot;, Slovak: &quot;Prešporok&quot;, today &quot;Bratislava&quot;) and Detrekő (Slovak &quot;Plavecké Podhradie&quot;), Matthew managed to reoccupy the castles on behalf of the king. Henceforward, the Danube became the border between the developing domains of the Kőszegi and Csák families. King Andrew appointed him to master of the horse and he also became the ispán (&quot;comes&quot;) of Pozsony County (1293–1297). On 28 October 1293, Matthew issued a charter and promised that he would respect the liberties of the burghers of the city of Pozsony that King Andrew had confirmed before.

During this period, Matthew started to augment his possessions not only by the king&#x27;s donations, but also by using force. In 1296, he bought Vöröskő (Slovak: &quot;Červený Kameň&quot;) from its former holders for money; however, contemporary documents prove that he enforced several neighboring landowners to transfer their possessions either to him or his partisans. He even was ready to occupy territories; &quot;e.g.&quot;, around 1296, he took possession of the lands of the Archabbot of Pannonhalma south of the Danube and he also trespassed the possessions of the Collegiate Chapter of Pressburg.

Around the end of 1296, Matthew acquired Trencsén (Slovak: &quot;Trenčín&quot;) and afterwards, he was named after the castle. In 1296 King Andrew appointed him Palatine, but shortly afterwards the king absolved one of Matthew&#x27;s opponents, Andrew of Gimes from the Hont-Pázmány clan of all responsibility for the damage he had caused to Matthew. The document proves that the relationship of the king and Matthew worsened and the king deprived him of his office of Palatine in 1297. At the same time, the king granted Pozsony County to his queen, Agnes of Austria.

==Kings&#x27; rival==
Matthew continued to style himself Palatine even after 1297. He managed to overcome Andrew of Gimes and his family and thus expanded his influence along the Zsitva River (Žitava River).

In 1298, King Andrew III allied himself with King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia; the alliance was probably directed against Matthew whose possessions lay between the two monarchs&#x27; territories. In the next year, King Andrew sent his troops against him, but he could resist the attack; only Pozsony County was reoccupied by the king&#x27;s partisans.

Before 1300, Matthew entered into negotiations with the representatives of King Charles II of Naples and reassured him that he would assist the claim of his grandson, Charles for the throne against King Andrew III. However, in the summer of 1300, Matthew visited Andrew&#x27;s court, but the king, the last male member of the Árpád dynasty, died on 14 January 1301, and following his death a rivalry broke out among the several claimants for the throne. At that time, Matthew&#x27;s brother, Csák died childless and therefore Matthew inherited his possessions.

Following the death of King Andrew III, he became the Neapolitan prince&#x27;s follower, but shortly afterwards, he joined the party that offered the crown to Wenceslaus, the son of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. He was present at the coronation of the young Bohemian prince (27 August 1301) who granted him Trencsén and Nyitra counties; therefore he became the lawful holder of all the royal castles and possessions in the two counties. In the following years, Matthew Csák occupied the possessions of the Balassa family in the two counties and he also took several castles in Nógrád and Hont counties.

King Wenceslaus could not strengthen his rule against his opponent and he had to leave the kingdom (August 1304). By that time Matthew Csák had already left King Wenceslaus&#x27; party, and shortly afterwards he made an alliance with Duke Rudolph III of Austria against the king of Bohemia. Although he did not join to King Charles&#x27; partisans, but his troops took part in the campaign King Charles and Duke Rudolph lead against the Kingdom of Bohemia (September–October 1304). The internal struggles, however, did not end, because on 6 December 1305 a new claimant, Otto III, Duke of Bavaria was crowned King of Hungary. Matthew Csák did not accept King Otto&#x27;s rule, and his troops struggled together with King Charles&#x27; armies who occupied some castles on the northern part of the kingdom.

On 10 October 1307, an assembly confirmed King Charles&#x27; rule, but Matthew Csák and some other oligarchs (Ladislaus Kán, Ivan and Henry II Kőszegi) absented themselves from the assembly. In 1308, Pope Clement V sent a legate to the kingdom in order to strengthen King Charles&#x27; position. The legate, Cardinal Gentile Portino da Montefiore managed to persuade Matthew to accept King Charles&#x27; rule at their meeting in the Pauline Monastery of Kékes (10 November 1308). Although Matthew himself was not present at the following assembly (27 November) in Pest where King Charles&#x27; reign was again confirmed, he sent his envoy to attend at the meeting. Shortly afterwards, King Charles appointed Matthew Palatine of the kingdom. However, at the new coronation of King Charles (15 June 1309), he was only represented by one of his followers. In the next year, King Charles appointed him to the office of master of the treasury, which then was the first high-ranking political position during the first regnal years of Charles as the position of palatine was &quot;devaluated&quot;.

Matthew Csák did not want to accept the king&#x27;s rule; therefore, he did not attend King Charles&#x27; third coronation, when he was crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary (27 August). Moreover, Matthew Csák still continued to expand the borders of his domains and occupied several castles in the northern part of the kingdom. On 25 June 1311, he led his troops towards Buda and pillaged the surrounding territories and on this account the Cardinal Gentile excommunicated him on 6 July 1311. However, he did not accept the punishment and persuaded some priests to continue their services on his territories.

The indignant oligarch pillaged the possessions of the Archdiocese of Esztergom. When the citizens of Kassa (Slovak: &quot;Košice&quot;) killed Amade Aba, the powerful oligarch of the north-eastern parts of the kingdom (5 September 1311) Matthew made an alliance with his sons against the king who sided with Kassa. His troops liberated Sáros Castle (Slovak: &quot;Šarišský hrad&quot;), besieged by the king, and then marched against Kassa. At the Battle of Rozgony, the king&#x27;s armies defeated Matthew&#x27;s and his allies&#x27; troops (15 June 1312). Following the battle, the king occupied the territories of Amade Aba&#x27;s sons. Although Matthew&#x27;s domain stayed undisturbed, the occupation of the neighboring territories by the king hindered his expansion.

==Last years==
In 1314, the king&#x27;s armies invaded Matthew Csák&#x27;s domain, but they could not occupy it. In the meantime, Matthew occupied some fortresses in the March of Moravia and therefore King John of Bohemia also invaded his territories (May 1315). The Czech armies defeated his troops (whom he encouraged in Hungarian language) at Holics but they could not occupy the fortress. King Charles also invaded Matthew&#x27;s domain and occupied Visegrád.

Charles I launched small campaigns against the Csák dominion during 1314 and 1315. When Matthew invaded Szepes and his troops plundered the region, he was narrowly defeated by Philip Drugeth, the king&#x27;s loyal soldier. During this time Thomas Szécsényi received Hollókő from Charles, who confiscated the land from the Kacsics clan, the disloyal relatives of Thomas. Charles gradually encircled the Csák dominion, when appointed loyal castellans to head of the nearby forts.

The king attempted to weaken the unity among Matthew&#x27;s partisans through diplomatic means. According to a royal charter issued in September 1315, Charles I stripped three of the oligarch&#x27;s servients of all their possessions and gave those to Palatine Dominic Rátót, because they absolutely supported all Matthew Csák&#x27;s efforts and did not ask for the king&#x27;s grace. One of these sanctioned nobles was Felician Záh, who later unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate the entire royal family in 1330.

In 1316, some of his former followers rebelled against Matthew, and although he occupied their castle at Jókő, some of them left his domain. In 1317, he invaded the possessions of the Diocese of Nyitra, and his troops occupied and pillaged its see. As a consequence, Bishop John excommunicated him and his followers again.

The king&#x27;s armies continued to invade his territories and occupied Sirok and Fülek (Fiľakovo), but Matthew could maintain his rule over his territories until his death.

==Domain==
Matthew Csák&#x27;s domain had been developing gradually before the Battle of Rozgony, and it reached its greatest territorial extent around 1311. By that time, 14 counties of the kingdom, and about 50 castles were under his and his followers&#x27; rule.

Around 1297, he organized his own court, similar to the king&#x27;s court and he usurped royal prerogatives on his domains, similarly to other oligarchs (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Amade Aba, Nicholas Kőszegi) of the beginning of the 14th century. Thus he became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of his domain and he made alliances independently of the king. He refused to accept appeals to the king against his decisions and he denied to put claimants in possession of lands the king had granted them on his territories. Although some of the local landowners did not want to accept Matthew&#x27;s supremacy, but sooner or later, they had to leave their possessions.

Following his death, his cousin Stephen Sternberg (or &quot;Stephen the Bohemian&quot;) became the lord of his domain, because his son (Matthew IV) had died and his grandsons (Matthew V and James) were still minors at the time of his death in 1321. However, Stephen Sternberg could not resist the king&#x27;s invasion and Matthew Csák&#x27;s former domain was overtaken by the king&#x27;s armies in a few months&#x27; time.

==Legacy in the Slovak romantic movement==

Matthew Csák significantly influenced regional history of today&#x27;s Slovakia in the 13th–14th centuries. Alongside other activities, he founded several new settlements mainly in Trencsén County and supported raising towns. The level of independence he had achieved together with his contacts with the Czech lands (especially with Moravia) positively influenced also the development of local Slovak speaking nobility. Regardless of his relatively short rule his (ex-)domain was called the Matthew&#x27;s Land (&quot;terra Matthei&quot;) already in the 14th century. This concept had been preserved until the 15th century, when individuals still used to claim their origin from the Matthew&#x27;s Land (&quot;de Terra Matthei&quot;) instead of the official administrative divisions or settlements of the Kingdom of Hungary.

This was later reflected in the Slovak national revival in the 19th century. Although his personality was known to older generation of Slovak intellects (Adam František Kollár, Anton Bernolák), he became a subject of the national mythology only in the period of Ľudovít Štúr. The motive of Matthew Csák was introduced in 1836–37 by a Slovak lawyer Alexander Boleslavín Vrchovský. Thereafter, the topic was covered by numerous Slovak poets and writers like Ľudovít Štúr, Ján Kalinčiak, Jozef Miloslav Hurban, Mikuláš Dohány, Viliam Paulíny-Tóth, Samuel Ornis, Jonáš Záborský, Jozef Škultéty and others. In the romantic national discourse of the 19th century, he was perceived as a Slovak national hero, defender of Slovak interests and/or an uncrowned Slovak king. Matthew Csák and his &quot;realm&quot; became the symbols of Slovak independence with the purpose to expropriate his historical heritage for the emerging national state of Slovakia. Ľudovít Štúr, the most prominent personality in the period of the Slovak national revival presented Matthew Csák in his poem &quot;Matúš z Trenčína&quot; (&quot;Matúš of Trenčín&quot;) as champion of Slovak interests who build on legacy of Great Moravia, predicting that the Slovak nation &quot;will be free one day&quot;. 

However, such idealized view remained favored only by a narrow group of Slovak intellectuals and was not (in most cases) adopted by ordinary people. The idea of Matthew Csák as a Slovak national hero was already eroded by critically thinking members of the Slovak intellectuals in the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century (Jonáš Záborský, Július Botto) and was finally crushed in 1923 by Slovak historian Jozef Škultéty. Similar views are also rejected by the modern critical Slovak historiography and in Slovak historic memory Matthew Csák is perceived simply as a feudal magnate, a notable regional figure and the &quot;Lord of Váh and Tatras&quot;.

<text>The terms underground press or clandestine press refer to periodicals and publications that are produced without official approval, illegally or against the wishes of a dominant (governmental, religious, or institutional) group. 
In specific recent (post-World War II) Asian, American and Western European context, the term &quot;underground press&quot; has most frequently been employed to refer to the independently published and distributed underground papers associated with the counterculture of the late 1960s and early 1970s in India and Bangladesh in Asia, in the United States and Canada in North America, and the United Kingdom and other western nations. It can also refer to the newspapers produced independently in repressive regimes. In German occupied Europe, for example, a thriving underground press operated, usually in association with the Resistance. Other notable examples include the &quot;samizdat&quot; and &quot;bibuła&quot;, which operated in the Soviet Union and Poland respectively, during the Cold War.

==Origins==
In Western Europe, a century after the invention of the printing press, a widespread underground press emerged in the mid-16th century with the clandestine circulation of Calvinist books and broadsides, many of them printed in Geneva, which were secretly smuggled into other nations where the carriers who distributed such literature might face imprisonment, torture or death. Both Protestant and Catholic nations fought the introduction of Calvinism, which with its emphasis on intractable evil made its appeal to alienated, outsider subcultures willing to violently rebel against both church and state. In 18th century France, a large illegal underground press of the Enlightenment emerged, circulating anti-Royalist, anti-clerical and pornographic works in a context where all published works were officially required to be licensed. Starting in the mid-19th century an underground press sprang up in many countries around the world for the purpose of circulating the publications of banned Marxist political parties; during the German Nazi occupation of Europe, clandestine presses sponsored and subsidized by the Allies were set up in many of the occupied nations, although it proved nearly impossible to build any sort of effective underground press movement within Germany itself.

The French resistance published a large and active underground press that printed over 2 million newspapers a month; the leading titles were &quot;Combat&quot;, &quot;Libération&quot;, &quot;Défense de la France&quot;, and &quot;Le Franc-Tireur&quot;. Each paper was the organ of a separate resistance network, and funds were provided from Allied headquarters in London and distributed to the different papers by resistance leader Jean Moulin. Allied prisoners of war (POWs) published an underground newspaper called POW WOW. In Eastern Europe, also since approximately 1940, underground publications were known by the name &quot;samizdat&quot;.

The countercultural underground press movement of the 1960s borrowed the name from previous &quot;underground presses&quot; such as the Dutch underground press during the Nazi occupations of the 1940s. Those predecessors were truly &quot;underground&quot;, meaning they were illegal, thus published and distributed covertly. While the countercultural &quot;underground&quot; papers frequently battled with governmental authorities, for the most part they were distributed openly through a network of street vendors, newsstands and head shops, and thus reached a wide audience.

The underground press in the 1960s and 1970s existed in most countries with high GDP per capita and freedom of the press; similar publications existed in some developing countries and as part of the &quot;samizdat&quot; movement in the communist states, notably Czechoslovakia. Published as weeklies, monthlies, or &quot;occasionals&quot;, and usually associated with left-wing politics, they evolved on the one hand into today&#x27;s alternative weeklies and on the other into zines.

==In Australia==
The most prominent underground publication in Australia was a satirical magazine called &quot;OZ&quot; (1963 to 1969), which initially owed a debt to local university student newspapers such as Honi Soit (University of Sydney) and Tharunka (University of New South Wales), along with the UK magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. The original edition appeared in Sydney on April Fools&#x27; Day, 1963 and continued sporadically until 1969. Editions published after February 1966 were edited by Richard Walsh, following the departure for the UK of his original co-editors Richard Neville and Martin Sharp, who went on to found a British edition (&quot;London Oz&quot;) in January 1967. In Melbourne Phillip Frazer, founder and editor of pop music magazine &quot;Go-Set&quot; since January 1966, branched out into alternate, underground publications with &quot;Revolution&quot; in 1970, followed by &quot;High Times&quot; (1971 to 1972) and &quot;The Digger&quot; (1972 to 1975).

===List of Australian underground papers===
* &quot;The Digger&quot; (1972–1975)
* &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1973–1974)
* &quot;High Times&quot; (1971–1972)
* &quot;OZ Sydney&quot; (1963–1969)
* &quot;New Dawn&quot; magazine
* &quot;Nexus&quot; magazine
* &quot;Revolution&quot; (1970–1971)

==In the United Kingdom==
The underground press offered a platform to the socially impotent and mirrored the changing way of life in the UK underground.

In London, Barry Miles, John Hopkins, and others produced &quot;International Times&quot; from October 1966 which, following legal threats from &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper was renamed &quot;IT&quot;.

Richard Neville arrived in London from Australia, where he had edited &quot;Oz&quot; (1963 to 1969). He launched a British version (1967 to 1973), which was A4 (as opposed to &quot;IT&quot;&#x27;s broadsheet format). Very quickly, the relaunched &quot;Oz&quot; shed its more austere satire magazine image and became a mouthpiece of the underground. It was the most colourful and visually adventurous of the alternative press (sometimes to the point of near-illegibility), with designers like Martin Sharp. 

Other publications followed, such as &quot;Friends&quot; (later &quot;Frendz&quot;), based in the Ladbroke Grove area of London; &quot;Ink&quot;, which was more overtly political; and &quot;Gandalf&#x27;s Garden&quot; which espoused the mystic path.

=== Legal challenges ===
The flaunting of sexuality within the underground press provoked prosecution. &quot;IT&quot; was taken to court for publishing small ads for homosexuals; despite the 1967 legalisation of homosexuality between consenting adults in private, importuning remained subject to prosecution. Publication of the &quot;Oz&quot; &quot;School Kids&quot; issue brought charges against the three &quot;Oz&quot; editors, who were convicted and given jail sentences. This was the first time the Obscene Publications Act 1959 was combined with a moral conspiracy charge. The convictions were, however, overturned on appeal.

=== Harassment and intimidation ===
Police harassment of the British underground, in general, became commonplace, to the point that in 1967 the police seemed to focus in particular on the apparent source of agitation: the underground press. The police campaign may have had an effect contrary to that which was presumably intended. If anything, according to one or two who were there at the time, it actually made the underground press stronger. &quot;It focused attention, stiffened resolve, and tended to confirm that what we were doing was considered dangerous to the establishment&quot;, remembered Mick Farren. From April 1967, and for some while later, the police raided the offices of &quot;International Times&quot; to try, it was alleged, to force the paper out of business. In order to raise money for &quot;IT&quot; a benefit event was put together, &quot;The 14 Hour Technicolor Dream&quot; Alexandra Palace on 29 April 1967.

On one occasion – in the wake of yet another raid on &quot;IT&quot; – London&#x27;s alternative press succeeded in pulling off what was billed as a &#x27;reprisal attack&#x27; on the police. The paper &quot;Black Dwarf&quot; published a detailed floor-by-floor &#x27;Guide to Scotland Yard&#x27;, complete with diagrams, descriptions of locks on particular doors, and snippets of overheard conversation. The anonymous author, or &#x27;blue dwarf&#x27;, as he styled himself, claimed to have perused archive files, and even to have sampled one or two brands of scotch in the Commissioner&#x27;s office. The London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; headlined the incident as &quot;Raid on the Yard&quot;. A day or two later &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; announced that the prank had resulted in all security passes to the police headquarters having to be withdrawn and then re-issued.

=== Support from British pop culture ===
By the end of the decade, community artists and bands such as Pink Floyd (before they &quot;went commercial&quot;), The Deviants, Pink Fairies, Hawkwind, Michael Moorcock and Steve Peregrin Took would arise in a symbiotic co-operation with the underground press. The underground press publicised these bands and this made it possible for them to tour and get record deals. The band members travelled around spreading the ethos and the demand for underground newspapers and magazines grew and flourished for a while.

Neville published an account of the counterculture called &quot;Play Power&quot;, in which he described most of the world&#x27;s underground publications. He also listed many of the regular key topics from those publications, including the Vietnam War, Black Power, politics, police brutality, hippies and the lifestyle revolution, drugs, popular music, new society, cinema, theatre, graphics, cartoons, etc.

===Local papers===
Apart from publications such as &quot;IT&quot; and &quot;Oz&quot;, both of which had a national circulation, the 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of a whole range of local alternative newspapers, which were usually published monthly. These were largely made possible by the introduction in the 1950s of offset litho printing, which was much cheaper than traditional typesetting and use of the rotary letterpress. Such local papers included:
* &quot;Aberdeen Peoples Press&quot;
* &quot;Alarm&quot; (Swansea)
* &quot;Andersonstown News&quot; (Belfast)
* &quot;Brighton Voice&quot;
* &quot;Bristol Voice&quot;
* &quot;Feedback&quot; (Norwich)
* &quot;Hackney People&#x27;s Press&quot;
* &quot;Islington Gutter Press&quot;
* &quot;Leeds Other Paper&quot;
* &quot;Response&quot; (Earl&#x27;s Court, London)
* &quot;Sheffield Free Press&quot;
* &quot;West Highland Free Press&quot;

A 1980 review identified some 70 such publications around the United Kingdom but estimated that the true number could well have run into hundreds. Such papers were usually published anonymously, for fear of the UK&#x27;s draconian libel laws. They followed a broad anarchist, libertarian, left-wing of the Labour Party, socialist approach but the philosophy of a paper was usually flexible as those responsible for its production came and went. Most papers were run on collective principles.

== North America==
=== Legal definition of &quot;underground&quot; ===
In the United States, the term &quot;underground&quot; did not mean &quot;illegal&quot; as it did in many other countries. The First Amendment and various court decisions (e.g. &quot;Near v. Minnesota&quot;) give very broad rights to anyone to publish a newspaper or other publication, and severely restrict government efforts to close down or censor a private publication. In fact, when censorship attempts are made by government agencies, they are either done in clandestine fashion (to keep it from being known the action is being taken by a government agency) or are usually ordered stopped by the courts when judicial action is taken in response to them.

A publication must, in general, be committing a crime (for example, reporters burglarizing someone&#x27;s office to obtain information about a news item); violating the law in publishing a particular article or issue (printing obscene material, copyright infringement, libel, breaking a non-disclosure agreement); directly threatening national security; or causing or potentially causing an imminent emergency (the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; standard) to be ordered stopped or otherwise suppressed, and then usually only the particular offending article or articles in question will be banned, while the newspaper itself is allowed to continue operating and can continue publishing other articles.

In the U.S. the term &quot;underground newspaper&quot; generally refers to an independent (and typically smaller) newspaper focusing on unpopular themes or counterculture issues. Typically, these tend to be politically to the left or far left. More narrowly, in the U.S. the term &quot;underground newspaper&quot; most often refers to publications of the period 1965–1973, when a sort of boom or craze for local tabloid underground newspapers swept the country in the wake of court decisions making prosecution for obscenity far more difficult. These publications became the voice of the rising New Left and the hippie/psychedelic/rock and roll counterculture of the 1960s in America, and a focal point of opposition to the Vietnam War and the draft.

=== Origins ===
The North American countercultural press of the 1960s drew inspiration from predecessors that had begun in the 1950s, such as the &quot;Village Voice&quot; and Paul Krassner&#x27;s satirical paper &quot;The Realist.&quot; Arguably, the first underground newspaper of the 1960s was the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot;, founded in 1964 and first published under that name in 1965. 

=== 1965–1973 boom period ===

According to Louis Menand, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the underground press movement in the United States was &quot;one of the most spontaneous and aggressive growths in publishing history.&quot; During the peak years of the phenomenon, there were generally about 100 papers currently publishing at any given time. But the underground press phenomenon proved short-lived.

An Underground Press Syndicate (UPS) roster published in November 1966 listed 14 underground papers, 11 of them in the United States, two in England, and one in Canada. Within a few years the number had mushroomed. A 1971 roster, published in Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;Steal This Book&quot;, listed 271 UPS-affiliated papers; 11 were in Canada, 23 in Europe, and the remainder in the United States. The underground press&#x27; combined readership eventually reached into the millions.

The early papers varied greatly in visual style, content, and even in basic concept — and emerged from very different kinds of communities. Many were decidedly rough-hewn, learning journalistic and production skills on the run. Some were militantly political while others featured highly spiritual content and were graphically sophisticated and adventuresome.

By 1969, virtually every sizable city or college town in North America boasted at least one underground newspaper. Among the most prominent of the underground papers were the &quot;San Francisco Oracle,&quot; &quot;San Francisco Express Times&quot;, the &quot;Berkeley Barb&quot; and &quot;Berkeley Tribe&quot;; &quot;Open City&quot; (Los Angeles), &quot;Fifth Estate&quot; (Detroit), &quot;Other Scenes&quot; (dispatched from various locations around the world by John Wilcock); &quot;The Helix&quot; (Seattle); &quot;Avatar&quot; (Boston); &quot;The Chicago Seed&quot;; &quot;The Great Speckled Bird&quot; (Atlanta); &quot;The Rag&quot; (Austin, Texas); &quot;Rat&quot; (New York City); &quot;Space City!&quot; (Houston) and in Canada, &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot; (Vancouver, BC).

&quot;The Rag&quot;, founded in Austin, Texas, in 1966 by Thorne Dreyer and Carol Neiman, was especially influential. Historian Laurence Leamer called it &quot;one of the few legendary undergrounds,&quot; and, according to John McMillian, it served as a model for many papers that followed. &quot;The Rag&quot; was the sixth member of UPS and the first underground paper in the South and, according to historian Abe Peck, it was the &quot;first undergrounder to represent the participatory democracy, community organizing and synthesis of politics and culture that the New Left of the mid-sixties was trying to develop.&quot; Leamer, in his 1972 book &quot;The Paper Revolutionaries&quot;, called &quot;The Rag&quot; &quot;one of the few legendary undergrounds&quot;. Gilbert Shelton&#x27;s legendary &quot;Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; comic strip began in &quot;The Rag&quot;, and thanks in part to UPS, was republished all over the world.

Probably the most graphically innovative of the underground papers was the &quot;San Francisco Oracle&quot;. John Wilcock, a founder of the Underground Press Syndicate, wrote about the &quot;Oracle&quot;: &quot;Its creators are using color the way Lautrec must once have experimented with lithography – testing the resources of the medium to the utmost and producing what almost any experienced newspaperman would tell you was impossible... it is a creative dynamo whose influence will undoubtedly change the look of American publishing.&quot;

In the period 1969–1970, a number of underground papers grew more militant and began to openly discuss armed revolution against the state, some going so far as to print manuals for bombing and urging their readers to arm themselves; this trend, however, soon fell silent after the rise and fall of the Weather Underground and the tragic shootings at Kent State.

==== High school underground press ====
During this period there was also a widespread underground press movement circulating unauthorized student-published tabloids and mimeographed sheets at hundreds of high schools around the U.S. (In 1968, a survey of 400 high schools in Southern California found that 52% reported student underground press activity in their school.) Most of these papers put out only a few issues, running off a few hundred copies of each and circulating them only at one local school, although there was one system-wide antiwar high school underground paper produced in New York in 1969 with a 10,000-copy press run. Houston&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Schoolhouse,&quot; a citywide underground paper published by high school students, was founded in 1970.

For a time in 1968–1969, the high school underground press had its own press services: FRED (run by C. Clark Kissinger of Students for a Democratic Society, with its base in Chicago schools) and HIPS (High School Independent Press Service, produced by students working out of Liberation News Service headquarters and aimed primarily but not exclusively at New York City schools). These services typically produced a weekly packet of articles and features mailed to subscribing papers around the country; HIPS reported 60 subscribing papers. 

==== G.I. underground press ====

The GI underground press within the U.S. military produced over four hundred titles during the Vietnam War, some produced by antiwar GI Coffeehouses, and many of them small, crudely produced, low-circulation mimeographed &quot;zines&quot; written by GIs or recently discharged veterans opposed to the war and circulated locally on and off-base. Several GI underground papers had large-scale, national distribution of tens of thousands of copies, including thousands of copies mailed to GI&#x27;s overseas. These papers were produced with the support of civilian anti-war activists, and had to be disguised to be sent through the mail into Vietnam, where soldiers distributing or even possessing them might be subject to harassment, disciplinary action, or arrest. There were at least two of these papers produced in the combat zone in Vietnam itself, &quot;The Boomerang Barb&quot; and &quot;GI Says&quot;.

=== Technological and financial realities ===
The boom in the underground press was made practical by the availability of cheap offset printing, which made it possible to print a few thousand copies of a small tabloid paper for a couple of hundred dollars, which a sympathetic printer might extend on credit. Paper was cheap, and many printing firms around the country had over-expanded during the 1950s and had excess capacity on their offset web presses, which could be negotiated for at bargain rates.

Most papers operated on a shoestring budget, pasting up camera-ready copy on layout sheets on the editor&#x27;s kitchen table, with labor performed by unpaid, non-union volunteers. Typesetting costs, which at the time were wiping out many established big city papers, were avoided by typing up copy on a rented or borrowed IBM Selectric typewriter to be pasted-up by hand. As one observer commented with only slight hyperbole, students were financing the publication of these papers out of their lunch money.

=== Syndicates and news services ===
In mid-1966, the cooperative Underground Press Syndicate (UPS) was formed at the instigation of Walter Bowart, the publisher of another early paper, the &quot;East Village Other&quot;. The UPS allowed member papers to freely reprint content from any of the other member papers.

During this period, there were also a number of left-wing political periodicals with concerns similar to those of the underground press. Some of these periodicals joined the Underground Press Syndicate to gain services such as microfilming, advertising, and the free exchange of articles and newspapers. Examples include &quot;The Black Panther&quot; (the paper of the Black Panther Party, Oakland, California), and &quot;The Guardian&quot; (New York City), both of which had national distribution.

Almost from the outset, UPS supported and distributed underground comix strips to its member papers. Some of the cartoonists syndicated by UPS included Robert Crumb, Jay Lynch, The Mad Peck&#x27;s &quot;Burn of the Week&quot;, Ron Cobb, and Frank Stack. The Rip Off Press Syndicate was launched 1973 to compete in selling underground comix content to the underground press and student publications. Each Friday, the company sent out a distribution sheet with the strips it was selling, by such cartoonists as Gilbert Shelton, Bill Griffith, Joel Beck, Dave Sheridan, Ted Richards, and Harry Driggs.

The Liberation News Service (LNS), co-founded in the summer of 1967 by Ray Mungo and Marshall Bloom, &quot;provided coverage of events to which most papers would have otherwise had no access.&quot; In a similar vein, John Berger, Lee Marrs, and others co-founded Alternative Features Service, Inc. in 1970 to supply the underground and college press, as well as independent radio stations, with syndicated press materials that especially highlighted the creation of alternative institutions, such as free clinics, people&#x27;s banks, free universities, and alternative housing.

By 1973, many underground papers had folded, at which point the Underground Press Syndicate acknowledged the passing of the undergrounds and renamed itself the Alternative Press Syndicate (APS). After a few years, APS also foundered, to be supplanted in 1978 by the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies.

=== Controversies ===
One of the most notorious underground newspapers to join UPS and rally activists, poets, and artists by giving them an uncensored voice, was the &quot;NOLA Express&quot; in New Orleans. Started by Robert Head and Darlene Fife as part of political protests and extending the &quot;mimeo revolution&quot; by protest and freedom-of-speech poets during the 1960s, &quot;NOLA Express&quot; was also a member of the Committee of Small Magazine Editors and Publishers (COSMEP). These two affiliations with organizations that were often at cross-purposes made &quot;NOLA Express&quot; one of the most radical and controversial publications of the counterculture movement. Part of the controversy about &quot;NOLA Express&quot; included graphic photographs and illustrations of which many even in today&#x27;s society would be banned as pornographic.

Charles Bukowski&#x27;s syndicated column, &quot;Notes of a Dirty Old Man,&quot; ran in &quot;NOLA Express&quot;, and Francisco McBride&#x27;s illustration for the story &quot;The Fuck Machine&quot; was considered sexist, pornographic, and created an uproar. All of this controversy helped to increase the readership and bring attention to the political causes that editors Fife and Head supported.

=== Harassment and intimidation ===
Many of the papers faced official harassment on a regular basis; local police repeatedly raided and busted up the offices of &quot;Dallas Notes&quot; and jailed editor Stoney Burns on drug charges; charged Atlanta&#x27;s &quot;Great Speckled Bird&quot; and others with obscenity; arrested street vendors; and pressured local printers not to print underground papers. 

In Austin, the regents at the University of Texas sued &quot;The Rag&quot; to prevent circulation on campus but the American Civil Liberties Union successfully defended the paper&#x27;s First Amendment rights before the U.S. Supreme Court. In an apparent attempt to shut down &quot;The Spectator&quot; in Bloomington, Indiana, editor James Retherford was briefly imprisoned for alleged violations of the Selective Service laws; his conviction was overturned and the prosecutors were rebuked by a federal judge.

Drive-by shootings, firebombings, break-ins, and trashings were carried out on the offices of many underground papers around the country, fortunately without causing any fatalities. The offices of Houston&#x27;s &quot;Space City!&quot; were bombed and its windows repeatedly shot out. In Houston, as in many other cities, the attackers, never identified, were suspected of being off-duty military or police personnel, or members of the Ku Klux Klan or Minuteman organizations. 

Some of the most violent attacks were carried out against the underground press in San Diego. In 1976 the &quot;San Diego Union&quot; reported that the attacks in 1971 and 1972 had been carried out by a right-wing paramilitary group calling itself the Secret Army Organization, which had ties to the local office of the FBI.

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted surveillance and disruption activities on the underground press in the United States, including a campaign to destroy the alternative agency Liberation News Service. As part of its COINTELPRO designed to discredit and infiltrate radical New Left groups, the FBI also launched phony underground newspapers such as the &quot;Armageddon News&quot; at Indiana University Bloomington, &quot;The Longhorn Tale&quot; at the University of Texas at Austin, and the &quot;Rational Observer&quot; at American University in Washington, D.C. The FBI also ran the Pacific International News Service in San Francisco, the Chicago Midwest News, and the New York Press Service. Many of these organizations consisted of little more than a post office box and a letterhead, designed to enable the FBI to receive exchange copies of underground press publications and send undercover observers to underground press gatherings.

=== Decline of the underground press ===
By the end of 1972, with the end of the draft and the winding down of the Vietnam War, there was increasingly little reason for the underground press to exist. A number of papers passed out of existence during this time; among the survivors a newer and less polemical view toward middle-class values and working within the system emerged. The underground press began to evolve into the socially conscious, lifestyle-oriented alternative media that currently dominates this form of weekly print media in North America.

In 1973, the landmark Supreme Court decision in &quot;Miller v. California&quot; re-enabled local obscenity prosecutions after a long hiatus. This sounded the death knell for much of the remaining underground press (including underground comix), largely by making the local head shops which stocked underground papers and comix in communities around the country more vulnerable to prosecution.

&quot;The Georgia Straight&quot; outlived the underground movement, evolving into an alternative weekly still published today; &quot;Fifth Estate&quot; survives as an anarchist magazine. &quot;The Rag&quot; – which was published for 11 years in Austin (1966–1977) – was revived in 2006 as an online publication, &quot;The Rag Blog&quot;, which now has a wide following in the progressive blogosphere and whose contributors include many veterans of the original underground press.

Given the nature of alternative journalism as a subculture, some staff members from underground newspapers became staff on the newer alternative weeklies, even though there was seldom institutional continuity with management or ownership. An example is the transition in Denver from the underground &quot;Chinook&quot;, to &quot;Straight Creek Journal&quot;, to &quot;Westword&quot;, an alternative weekly still in publication. Some underground and alternative reporters, cartoonists, and artists moved on to work in corporate media or in academia.

==India==
* &quot;Hungry Generation weekly bulletins&quot;. Calcutta (1961–1965)

The Hungry Generation was a literary movement in the Bengali language launched by what is known today as the &quot;Hungryalist quartet&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot; Shakti Chattopadhyay, Malay Roy Choudhury, Samir Roychoudhury and Debi Roy (&quot;alias&quot; Haradhon Dhara), during the 1960s in Kolkata, India. Due to their involvement in this avant garde cultural movement, the leaders lost their jobs and were jailed by the incumbent government. They challenged contemporary ideas about literature and contributed significantly to the evolution of the language and idiom used by contemporaneous artists to express their feelings in literature and painting.
This movement is characterized by expression of closeness to nature and sometimes by tenets of Gandhianism and Proudhonianism. Although it originated at Patna, Bihar and was initially based in Kolkata, it had participants spread over North Bengal, Tripura and Benares. According to Dr. Shankar Bhattacharya, Dean at Assam University, as well as Aryanil Mukherjee, editor of Kaurab Literary Periodical, the movement influenced Allen Ginsberg as much as it influenced American poetry through the Beat poets who visited Calcutta, Patna and Benares during the 1960–1970s. Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, now a professor and editor, was associated with the Hungry generation movement. Shakti Chattopadhyay, Saileswar Ghosh, Subhas Ghosh left the movement in 1964.

More than 100 manifestos were issued during 1961–1965. Malay&#x27;s poems have been published by Prof P. Lal from his Writers Workshop publication. Howard McCord published Malay Roy Choudhury&#x27;s controversial poem &quot;Prachanda Boidyutik Chhutar&quot; i.e., &quot;Stark Electric Jesus from Washington State University&quot; in 1965. The poem has been translated into several languages of the world; into German by Carl Weissner, into Spanish by Margaret Randall, into Urdu by Ameeq Hanfee, into Assamese by Manik Dass, into Gujarati by Nalin Patel, into Hindi by Rajkamal Chaudhary, and into English by Howard McCord.

<text>The Roundhouse is a performing arts and concert venue at the Grade II* listed former railway engine shed in Chalk Farm, London, England. The building was erected in 1846–1847 by the London &amp; North Western Railway as a roundhouse, a circular building containing a railway turntable, but was used for that purpose for only about a decade. After being used as a warehouse for a number of years, the building fell into disuse just before World War II. It was first made a listed building in 1954.

It reopened after 25 years, in 1964, as a performing arts venue, when the playwright Arnold Wesker established the Centre 42 Theatre Company and adapted the building as a theatre. The large circular structure has hosted various promotions, such as the launch of the underground paper &quot;International Times&quot; in 1966, one of only two UK appearances by The Doors with Jim Morrison in 1968, and the Greasy Truckers Party in 1972.

The Greater London Council ceded control of the building to Camden Council in 1983. By that time, Centre 42 had run out of funds and the building remained unused until a local businessman purchased the building in 1996 and performing arts shows returned. It was closed again in 2004 for a multi-million pound redevelopment. On 1 June 2006, the Argentine show &quot;Fuerzabruta&quot; opened at the new Roundhouse.

Since 2006, the Roundhouse has hosted the BBC Electric Proms and numerous iTunes Festivals, as well as award ceremonies such as the BT Digital Music Awards and the Vodafone Live Music Awards. In 2009, Bob Dylan performed a concert, and iTunes promoted a music iTunes Festival, at the venue. In line with the continuing legacy of avant-garde productions, NoFit State Circus performed the show &quot;Tabú&quot; during which the audience were encouraged to move around the performance space.

==History==
The Roundhouse was built as a turntable engine shed (or roundhouse) for the London &amp; Birmingham Railway. Known as the Great Circular Engine House, or the Luggage Engine House, it was built by Branson &amp; Gwyther, using designs by architects Robert B. Dockray and Robert Stephenson. Construction started in 1846 and the building opened in 1847.

Within ten years locomotives became too long for the building to accommodate, and the Roundhouse was used for various other purposes. The longest period of use (50 years, beginning in 1871) was as a bonded warehouse for gin distillers W &amp; A Gilbey Ltd.

In 1964 the premises were transferred to Centre 42, which prepared a scheme to convert the building into &quot;a permanent cultural centre with a theatre, cinema, art gallery and workshops, committee rooms for local organisations, library, youth club and restaurant dance-hall&quot;. This was estimated to cost between £300,000 and £600,000 (£–£ in worth), and was supported by &quot;well-known actors, playwrights, authors, musicians and others&quot;. In 1966 the Roundhouse became an arts venue, after the freehold was taken up by the then new Greater London Council. The opening concert was the 15 October 1966 &quot;All Night Rave&quot;, in which Soft Machine and Pink Floyd appeared at the launch of the underground newspaper &quot;International Times&quot;. The first major concert took place on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1966, when a night called Psychadelicamania was headlined by The Who. During the next decade the building became a significant venue for UK Underground music events &quot;Middle Earth&quot; and &quot;Implosion&quot;. Many of these were hosted and promoted by Jeff Dexter. Other bands playing at the Roundhouse during this period included Gass, The Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck, The Yardbirds, Zoot Money&#x27;s Dantalian&#x27;s Chariot, David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Incredible String Band, Fleetwood Mac, Third World War, The Doors with Jefferson Airplane, the Ramones, The Clash with The Jam, Elvis Costello, Elkie Brooks, Otis Redding, and Motörhead, who appeared at the Roundhouse on 20 July 1975.

While lying in a state of general abandonment in the 1980s, the Roundhouse was used as the main location for the science fiction horror film &quot;Hardware&quot; by Richard Stanley. Sets were built inside the structure, although the lack of proper soundproofing meant all of the dialogues had to be re-recorded.

The building was used again in 1996 to film the promotional video for the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; single &quot;A Design for Life&quot; prior to the start of redevelopment. Promotional videos for the singles &quot;No Matter What&quot; by Boyzone (1998), &quot;Handbags &amp; Gladrags&quot; by Stereophonics (2001), and &quot;Burn Burn&quot; by Lostprophets (2003) were also filmed there. A scene from the comedy film &quot;Smashing Time&quot; set in the revolving restaurant at the top of the GPO Tower was filmed there in 1967. In July that year the Roundhouse hosted the &quot;Dialectics of Liberation&quot; with (among others) R. D. Laing, Herbert Marcuse and Allen Ginsberg.

The Roundhouse has also been used for theatre, and has had two periods of theatrical glory, with musicals such as &quot;Catch My Soul&quot; (1969). Under administrator George Hoskins, the first phase also featured experimental theatre productions, such as the Living Theatre production of &quot;1776&quot; and other plays directed by Peter Brook. The once controversial nude revue &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot; opened in July 1970, and started a run of nearly four thousand performances in London, and the anarchic &quot;Evening of British Rubbish&quot; with professor Bruce Lacey and The Alberts had one performance in 1967.

The Greater London Council passed the building to the Camden London Borough Council in 1983, and attempts were made to establish it as a Black Arts Centre programming music, theatre and community projects; however, it was closed as a venue due to lack of funds. During this time, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1991/92, Spiral Tribe held a week-long party in the venue. During the party the generators cut out, so power had to be sourced from nearby British Rail train lines.

===Restoration===

The building lay largely empty until it was purchased for £6m in 1996 by the Norman Trust led by the philanthropist Torquil Norman. In 1998 he set up the &quot;Roundhouse Trust&quot; and led its redevelopment, with a board of trustees which included musicians Bob Geldof and Suggs, and filmmaker Terry Gilliam.

The venue opened for a two-year period to raise awareness and funds for a redevelopment scheme, with former Battersea Arts Centre director Paul Blackman as its director. Shows promoted at this time included the Royal National Theatre&#x27;s &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot;, dancer Michael Clark&#x27;s comeback performance, percussion extravaganza &quot;Stomp&quot;, Ken Campbell&#x27;s 24-hour-long show &quot;The Warp&quot; and the Argentine De La Guarda&#x27;s &quot;Villa Villa&quot; which ran for a year, becoming the venue&#x27;s longest running show, ending when the building was closed for redevelopment.

The website dance.com, commenting on the redevelopment project, said:

The renovated Roundhouse, designed by architects John McAslan &amp; Partners in association with engineering company Buro Happold, reopened on 1 June 2006, promoting &quot;Fuerzabruta&quot;. Since 1996 the renovations had cost £27m.

On 20 December 2006, George Michael held a free concert for NHS nurses as a thank you for the care given to his mother Lesley, who died of cancer in 1997.
In 2008, Michael Boyd, artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, transferred his RSC Histories Cycle to the Roundhouse, rearranging the performing space to match the Courtyard Theatre in Stratford upon Avon, where the cycle had first been staged.

On 31 March 2009, the charitable circus group NoFit State began presenting &quot;Tabu&quot;, using the open space at the Roundhouse. On 26 April 2009, Bob Dylan and his band performed at the Roundhouse as part of his 2009 UK tour, and in July 2009 the iTunes Music Festival (supported by Apple Computer) was held at the venue.
In January 2010, the Roundhouse introduced contemporary classical music to its events repertoire when it hosted the &quot;Reverb&quot; festival, which included performances by the London Contemporary Orchestra, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, The Magnets, Nico Muhly, Sam Amidon and the Britten Sinfonia.

For the September 2015 Apple Music Festival, Apple announced an environmental makeover gift for the venue: &quot;making major upgrades to the lighting, plumbing, and HVAC systems; installing recycling and composting bins… offering reusable water bottles instead of plastic ones… to reduce the Roundhouse&#x27;s annual carbon emissions by 60 tons, save 60,000 gallons of water a year, and divert more than 1,600 kilograms of waste from landfills&quot;.

==Roundhouse Trust==
Alongside its role as an arts venue, the Roundhouse is also a registered charity and runs a creative programme for 11–25s through the Roundhouse Trust.

From 2006 to 2012 the Trust taught over 13,000 11- to 25-year-olds in live music, circus, theatre and new media. Courses are held in the Roundhouse Studios, which include a music recording suite, film production rooms, TV and radio studios and rehearsal rooms, all located underneath the Main Space.

==Architecture==

The Roundhouse is Grade II* listed. It was declared a National Heritage Site in 2010, when a Transport Trust Heritage Plaque was presented by Prince Michael of Kent. It is regarded as a notable example of mid-19th century railway architecture. The original building, in diameter, is constructed in yellow brick and is distinctive for its unusual circular shape and pointed roof. The conical slate roof has a central smoke louvre (now glazed) and is supported by 24 cast-iron Doric columns (arranged around the original locomotive spaces) and a framework of curved ribs. The interior has original flooring and parts of the turntable and fragments of early railway lines.

The 2006 renovation was supported with conservation advice and funding from English Heritage and with grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council England. The project added seven layers of soundproofing to the roof, reinstated the glazed roof-lights, and added the steel and glass New Wing, which curves around the north side of the main building, to house the box office, bar and café, an art gallery foyer and offices.

<text>Cyberlore Studios, Inc. was an American video game developer based in Northampton, Massachusetts.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1992 by Lester Humphreys, Ken Grey, and Herb Perez. Since 1992, they produced expansion packs for &quot;MechWarrior 4&quot;, &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic II&quot;, and &quot;Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal&quot;. They also produced &quot;&quot; (2005), a simulation game based on the life of Hugh Hefner and &quot;Playboy&quot;, and a PlayStation 2 version of the classic board game &quot;Risk&quot;. Their most notable game is &quot;&quot;, whose original concept was created by Jim DuBois, who worked for the company as a senior designer.

The company grew from six employees in 1992 to thirty employees in 2000.

In 2005, Cyberlore ceased development of general entertainment games after the collapse of their publisher, Hip Games, and the subsequent layoff of two-thirds of their staff. The company refocused on the serious game corporate training market, under the new company name of Minerva Software.

<text>The UFO Club ( &quot;&quot;) was a short-lived British counter-culture nightclub in London in the 1960s. The club was established by Joe Boyd and John &quot;Hoppy&quot; Hopkins. It featured light shows, poetry readings, well-known rock acts such as Jimi Hendrix, avant-garde art by Yoko Ono, as well as local house bands, such as Pink Floyd and Soft Machine. The club operated for seven months from December 23, 1966 to July 28, 1967 at 31 Tottenham Court Road in Fitzrovia, followed by a further two months at the Roundhouse in Chalk Farm with the final show taking place on September 29.

==History==
The UFO Club was founded by John Hopkins known as &quot;Hoppy&quot; and Joe Boyd in the Blarney Club, an Irish dancehall in the basement of 31 Tottenham Court Road, under the Gala Berkeley Cinema which was opened on Friday 23 December 1966. Initially the club was advertised as &quot;UFO Presents Nite Tripper&quot;, because Boyd and Hopkins could not decide on &quot;UFO&quot; or &quot;Nite Tripper&quot; as a name. Eventually they settled on &quot;UFO&quot;.

Soft Machine and Pink Floyd performed on the opening night and the next Friday, and were re-engaged as the club continued into 1967, after initial success. The first events combined live music with light shows, avant-garde films and slide shows, and dance troupes.

Pink Floyd&#x27;s tenure at UFO was short, because as their fame grew, they were able to play bigger venues for higher fees. Boyd protested that their increasing fame was largely due to the success of UFO, but the band&#x27;s management wanted to move on and an agreement was made for just three more Floyd performances at UFO, at an increased fee.

Hopkins and Boyd had to cast around for a new &quot;house band&quot; for UFO. They settled on Soft Machine but also started booking other acts who were attracted by the club&#x27;s reputation. Amongst them were The Incredible String Band, Arthur Brown, Tomorrow, and Procol Harum, the latter of which played there when &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; was No 1 in the charts.
An advertisement featuring the Flammarion engraving in the Feb 13–26 issue of &quot;The International Times&quot; for &quot;UfOria! Festival of Love 10.30 till dawn&quot; [sic] announced &quot;feb.10 – the bonzo dog doodah band • flix–dali–bunuel • ginger johnson african drums&quot; as well as &quot;feb 17 – Soft Machine • mark boyle projections • movies • food • erogenius 3 + 4&quot;.

Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, consisting of Michael English and Nigel Waymouth, designed psychedelic posters to advertise events. Waymouth said, &quot;We were trying to give a visual concept of what we were experiencing, which was like hallucinations.&quot; The food was macrobiotic and included brown rice rissoles, vegetarian stuffed vine leaves and felafel, supplied by Craig Sams, who went on to co-found Whole Earth Foods and Green &amp; Black&#x27;s.

Jack Bracelin&#x27;s (Fiveacres Lights) created some of the light shows with equipment that ranged from 16mm projection of early &quot;art house&quot; films (often projected sideways or projected into smoke) or 5 kW &#x27;Panis&#x27; (effects projectors) borrowed from Samuelsons at Pinewood or Elstree film studios (or Strand Electric at Vauxhall) to overhead projectors with transparent trays borrowed from refrigerators and filled with Indian water, ink, beer etc. A favourite was to use &#x27;Aldis&#x27; slide projectors with dual layer 2×2 glass specimen slides with basic designs created with wax crayons (drawn by Lou – the oft naked lady) and then various substances introduced with syringes – Indian inks, snot, semen – in fact anything of immiscible viscosities. Bubbles made by injecting air between the glass plates which were then squeezed (by a pair of long nose pliers – in time to the music) would send folks even further off their heads! 

After a sordid article published in the &quot;News of the World&quot; on 30 July, the landlord told Joe Boyd the UFO could not continue at the Blarney. Brian Epstein offered the Champagne Lounge at his Saville Theatre but Boyd decided on the larger Roundhouse venue. In October 1967 the UFO Club at the Roundhouse folded.

The UFO Club&#x27;s success was its downfall – being too small to accommodate the increasing number of visitors. If a big name such as Jeff Beck was playing, UFO broke even, but the club usually lost money.

<text>The Battle of Solebay took place on 6 June 1672 New Style, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, near Southwold, Suffolk, in eastern England. A Dutch fleet under Michiel de Ruyter attacked a combined Anglo-French force in one of the largest naval battles of the age of sail. Fighting continued much of the day, but ended at sunset without a clear victory. However, the scattered Allied fleet had suffered far more damage and was forced to abandon any plans to land troops on the Dutch coast.

==Prelude==
In 1672, both France and England declared war on the Dutch Republic, on the 6 and 7 April respectively. Johan de Witt, the Dutch Grand Pensionary, still harbored some hope for successful negotiations, especially with the support of influential anti-Catholic English figures such as Sir William Temple and the Earl of Sandwich. However, Louis XIV of France had already revealed his true intentions during a sharp address to the Dutch ambassador, Pieter de Groot, at the New Year&#x27;s reception at his court. As French troops advanced towards the Rhine and the armies of Münster and Cologne penetrated the eastern provinces, the combined English and French fleets were poised to strike the Republic from the sea.

The joint Anglo-French fleet consisted of 93 warships (sources vary), 35,000-40,000 men and 6,158 cannon. The Allies under the Duke of York and Vice-Admirals Earl of Sandwich and Comte Jean II d&#x27;Estrées planned to blockade the Dutch in their home ports and deny the North Sea to Dutch shipping. The Dutch had at their disposal a fleet of 75 warships, 20,738 men and 4,484 cannon, commanded by Lieutenant-Admirals Michiel de Ruyter, Adriaen Banckert and Willem Joseph van Ghent. The Dutch had hoped to repeat the success of the Raid on the Medway and a frigate squadron under Van Ghent sailed up the Thames in May but discovered that Sheerness Fort was now too well prepared to pass. The Dutch main fleet came too late, mainly due to coordination problems between the five Dutch admiralties, to prevent a joining of the English and French fleets. It followed the Allied fleet to the north, which, unaware of this, put in at Solebay to refit.

==Battle==
On 7 June at dawn, around 5 a.m., off Orfordness, De Ruyter suddenly appeared in the sight of the Allied fleet. Although a lack of wind prevented De Ruyter from launching an attack with his fireships, the confusion among the suddenly alarmed English and French was still significant. Officers and sailors, still on shore, were quickly signaled to return to their ships, and the Anglo-French fleet immediately set sail, though in less than ideal order. The French, whether through accident or design, found themselves in the rear and considerably south of the English, whose vanguard under Sandwich and middle squadron under York lay close to the coast.


De Ruyter had employed a new formation, creating from the various squadrons under Jan van Brakel a &quot;forlorn hope&quot; squadron of 18 ships and 18 fireships, which was to attack the enemy ahead of the main force and attempt to cause confusion with its fireships. However, this failed, and the battle had to be fought between the main squadrons. Having the weather gauge, De Ruyter attacked the enemy around 8 a.m. at full speed. He himself directing his attack against the middle squadron as usual. The Duke of York, who commanded the Allied middle squadron, and De Ruyter fiercely bombarded each other. York would have to move his flag twice, finally to &quot;London&quot;, as his flagships &quot;Prince&quot; and &quot;St Michael&quot; were taken out of action. The &quot;Prince&quot; was crippled by De Ruyter&#x27;s flagship &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot; in a two hours&#x27; duel. De Ruyter was accompanied by the representative of the States-General of the Netherlands, Cornelis de Witt (the brother of Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt) who bravely remained seated on the main deck, although half of his guard of honour standing next to him was killed or wounded.

In the meantime Banckert had taken on the French squadron under d&#x27;Estrées, which flew the white flag. The French, quite far away from the English squadrons, steered south followed by Banckert. They fiercely exchanged fire throughout the day, inflicting severe damage on each other without significantly influencing the battle&#x27;s outcome. This later led to various speculations about the actual separation of the two squadrons, with many wrongly attributing it to secret mutual agreements or D&#x27;Estrees&#x27; reluctance to participate more fully in the battle, possibly related to a supposed mission to weaken the two great maritime powers against each other. Nevertheless, the &quot;Superbe&quot; was heavily damaged and des Rabesnières killed by fire from Enno Doedes Star&#x27;s &quot;Groningen&quot;; total French casualties were about 450.

The battle between squadrons of Sandwich and Van Ghent was no less bloody than that between those of York and De Ruyter. Here, too, the fiercest fighting took place between the admiral&#x27;s ships and their &quot;seconds.&quot; The flagship of Sandwich, the HMS &quot;Royal James&quot;, was first fiercely engaged by Lieutenant-Admiral Van Ghent, who in 1667 had executed the Raid on the Medway, on the &quot;Dolfijn&quot;. Van Brakel, who actually belonged to De Ruyter&#x27;s squadron, took it upon himself to engage Sandwich&#x27;s ship with the &quot;Groot Hollandia&quot; to aid the heavily attacked Van Ghent. He incessantly pounded the hull of the &quot;Royal James&quot; for over an hour and bringing her into such a condition that Lord Sandwich considered to strike his flag but decided against it because it was beneath his honour to surrender to a mere captain of low birth. Van Ghent was killed around 10 a.m. in this ship battle, and the desperate Sandwich, who couldn&#x27;t board the &quot;Groot Hollandia&quot; due to a lack of crew, finally managed to free himself from Van Brakel at low tide. But the &quot;Royal James&quot; now drifted away, sinking, and was attacked by several fire ships. She sank two, but a third commanded by Van den Ryn, the same captain who had cut through the chain at the Medway, set the Royal James on fire. Its approach shielded by Vice-Admiral Isaac Sweers&#x27;s &quot;Oliphant&quot;. After nine-tenths of its thousand crew members had been killed or wounded Sandwich, abandoned by part of his own squadron under Joseph Jordan, who had engaged vice admiral Volckert Schram&#x27;s division, remained on his burning ship until he met his death in the waves. He and his son-in-law Philip Carteret drowned trying to escape when his sloop collapsed under the weight of panicked sailors jumping in; his body washed ashore, only recognisable by the scorched clothing still showing the shield of the Order of the Garter. The battle continued for hours, with Van Panhuys, Van Ghent&#x27;s captain, flying his flag on De Witt&#x27;s express orders to prevent panic. Despite this, the death of the lieutenant admiral soon became known, causing significant disruption in his squadron.

In the centre Lieutenant-Admiral Aert Jansse van Nes on the &quot;Eendracht&quot; first duelled Vice-Admiral Edward Spragge on HMS &quot;London&quot; and then was attacked by HMS &quot;Royal Katherine&quot;. The latter ship was then so heavily damaged that Captain John Chichely struck her flag and was taken prisoner; the Dutch prize crew however got drunk on the brandy found and allowed the ship to be later recaptured by the English. Van Ghent&#x27;s death presented a formidable challenge for De Ruyter, who was now also under attack from some of the ships from Sandwich&#x27;s squadron commanded by Jordan. Meanwhile, York had to transfer from the damaged &quot;St Michael&quot; to the London, Spragge&#x27;s flagship, due to severe leaks. The battle centered on the two middle squadrons. The two fleets, under light winds, drifted southward along the banks of Lowestoft and as far as Aldbrough, engaged in intense and chaotic combat. By late evening, De Ruyter managed to maneuver behind the English centre. He now headed toward Banckert, while York maneuvered towards D&#x27;Estrees. During this maneuver, De Ruyter encountered a smaller vessel, the &quot;Rainbow&quot;, commanded by Captain James Storey, which he left severely damaged after a brief skirmish.

Around 9 p.m., with the onset of darkness, the battle ended, remaining largely undecided, although the Allied fleet had suffered far more damage. The Battle of Solebay, according to De Ruyter himself, &quot;was sharper and more prolonged&quot; than any naval battle he had ever witnessed. Losses had also been heavy on the Dutch side: one Dutch ship, the &quot;Jozua&quot;, was destroyed and another, the &quot;Stavoren&quot;, captured, a third Dutch ship had an accident during repairs immediately after the battle and blew up.

In a strategic sense, it was however a clear Dutch victory as it deterred Anglo-French plans to blockade Dutch ports and land troops on the Dutch coast. Tactically both sides sustained heavy damages; two English ships were sunk, including the fleet&#x27;s flagship the ‘’Royal James’’, as well as two French ships sunk. The Dutch also lost two large ships, in addition to many fire ships.

The fleets met again at the Battle of Schooneveld in 1673.

* The battle is described in verse, as if in an eyewitness account seen from the coast at Dunwich, in the ballad &quot;A Merry Song on the Duke&#x27;s late glorious Success over the Dutch&quot;, which appears in print (apparently taken from a broadside ballad) in the &quot;Suffolk Garland&quot; of 1818.
* Leeds Central Library has a 50 ft (15m), step by step, pictorial record of the sea battle which dates from around 1910. It is based on contemporary parchments and also features scenes depicting the Battle of Texel. It forms part of the Gascoigne collection.
* The battle is described in the novel &quot;An Affair of Dishonour&quot; published in 1910 by William de Morgan who was also an artist in glass and ceramics. A wounded survivor becomes an important character in the story.
* The Battle of Solebay forms the historic background to children&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;The Lion of Sole Bay&quot;, the fourth book in the Strong Winds series by Julia Jones
* The Adnams Brewery created a beer, named Broadside, in commemoration of the battle&#x27;s tercentenary.

In his novel, “The Black Tulip”, Alexandre Dumas refers to the historical role of Cornelius de Witt in the battle. (Chapter 2, “The Two Brothers”)

<doc id="886330" wikidata="Q7621897" url="?curid=886330" title="Strategyproofness">
<text>In mechanism design, a strategyproof (SP) mechanism is a game form in which each player has a weakly-dominant strategy, so that no player can gain by &quot;spying&quot; over the other players to know what they are going to play. When the players have private information (e.g. their type or their value to some item), and the strategy space of each player consists of the possible information values (e.g. possible types or values), a truthful mechanism is a game in which revealing the true information is a weakly-dominant strategy for each player. An SP mechanism is also called dominant-strategy-incentive-compatible (DSIC), to distinguish it from other kinds of incentive compatibility. 

A SP mechanism is immune to manipulations by individual players (but not by coalitions). In contrast, in a group strategyproof mechanism, no group of people can collude to misreport their preferences in a way that makes every member better off. In a strong group strategyproof mechanism, no group of people can collude to misreport their preferences in a way that makes at least one member of the group better off without making any of the remaining members worse off.

== Examples ==
Typical examples of SP mechanisms are:

* a majority vote between two alternatives;
* a second-price auction when participants have quasilinear utility;
* a VCG mechanism when participants have quasilinear utility

Typical examples of mechanisms that are &quot;not&quot; SP are:

* any deterministic non-dictatorial election between three or more alternatives;
* a first-price auction

=== SP in network routing ===
SP is also applicable in network routing. Consider a network as a graph where each edge (i.e. link) has an associated cost of transmission, privately known to the owner of the link. The owner of a link wishes to be compensated for relaying messages. As the sender of a message on the network, one wants to find the least cost path. There are efficient methods for doing so, even in large networks. However, there is one problem: the costs for each link are unknown. A naive approach would be to ask the owner of each link the cost, use these declared costs to find the least cost path, and pay all links on the path their declared costs. However, it can be shown that this payment scheme is not SP, that is, the owners of some links can benefit by lying about the cost. We may end up paying far more than the actual cost. It can be shown that given certain assumptions about the network and the players (owners of links), a variant of the VCG mechanism is SP.

== Formal definitions ==
There is a set formula_1 of possible outcomes.

There are formula_2 agents which have different valuations for each outcome. The valuation of agent formula_3 is represented as a function:

: formula_4

which expresses the value it has for each alternative, in monetary terms.

It is assumed that the agents have Quasilinear utility functions; this means that, if the outcome is formula_5 and in addition the agent receives a payment formula_6 (positive or negative), then the total utility of agent formula_3 is:

: formula_8

The vector of all value-functions is denoted by formula_9.

For every agent formula_3, the vector of all value-functions of the &quot;other&quot; agents is denoted by formula_11. So formula_12.

A &quot;mechanism&quot; is a pair of functions:
* An formula_13 function, that takes as input the value-vector formula_9 and returns an outcome formula_15 (it is also called a social choice function);
* A formula_16 function, that takes as input the value-vector formula_9 and returns a vector of payments, formula_18, determining how much each player should receive (a negative payment means that the player should pay a positive amount).

A mechanism is called strategyproof if, for every player formula_3 and for every value-vector of the other players formula_11:
: formula_21

== Characterization ==
It is helpful to have simple conditions for checking whether a given mechanism is SP or not. This subsection shows two simple conditions that are both necessary and sufficient. 

If a mechanism with monetary transfers is SP, then it must satisfy the following two conditions, for every agent formula_3:

1. The payment to agent formula_3 is a function of the chosen outcome and of the valuations of the other agents formula_11 - but &quot;not&quot; a direct function of the agent&#x27;s own valuation formula_25. Formally, there exists a price function formula_26, that takes as input an outcome formula_15 and a valuation vector for the other agents formula_11, and returns the payment for agent formula_3, such that for every formula_30, if:
: formula_31
then:
: formula_32
PROOF: If formula_33 then an agent with valuation formula_34 prefers to report formula_25, since it gives him the same outcome and a larger payment; similarly, if formula_36 then an agent with valuation formula_25 prefers to report formula_34.

As a corollary, there exists a &quot;price-tag&quot; function, formula_26, that takes as input an outcome formula_15 and a valuation vector for the other agents formula_11, and returns the payment for agent formula_3 For every formula_43, if:
: formula_44
then:
: formula_45

2. The selected outcome is optimal for agent formula_3, given the other agents&#x27; valuations. Formally:
: formula_47
where the maximization is over all outcomes in the range of formula_48.

PROOF: If there is another outcome formula_49 such that formula_50, then an agent with valuation formula_25 prefers to report formula_34, since it gives him a larger total utility.

Conditions 1 and 2 are not only necessary but also sufficient: any mechanism that satisfies conditions 1 and 2 is SP.

PROOF: Fix an agent formula_3 and valuations formula_30. Denote:
: formula_55 - the outcome when the agent acts truthfully.
: formula_56 - the outcome when the agent acts untruthfully.
By property 1, the utility of the agent when playing truthfully is:
: formula_57
and the utility of the agent when playing untruthfully is:
: formula_58
By property 2:
: formula_59
so it is a dominant strategy for the agent to act truthfully.

=== Outcome-function characterization ===
The actual goal of a mechanism is its formula_13 function; the payment function is just a tool to induce the players to be truthful. Hence, it is useful to know, given a certain outcome function, whether it can be implemented using a SP mechanism or not (this property is also called implementability).

The monotonicity property is necessary for strategyproofness.

== Truthful mechanisms in single-parameter domains ==
A &quot;single-parameter domain&quot; is a game in which each player formula_3 gets a certain positive value formula_62 for &quot;winning&quot; and a value 0 for &quot;losing&quot;. A simple example is a single-item auction, in which formula_62 is the value that player formula_3 assigns to the item.

For this setting, it is easy to characterize truthful mechanisms. Begin with some definitions.

A mechanism is called &quot;normalized&quot; if every losing bid pays 0.

A mechanism is called &quot;monotone&quot; if, when a player raises his bid, his chances of winning (weakly) increase.

For a monotone mechanism, for every player &quot;i&quot; and every combination of bids of the other players, there is a &quot;critical value&quot; in which the player switches from losing to winning.

A normalized mechanism on a single-parameter domain is truthful if the following two conditions hold:
# The assignment function is monotone in each of the bids, and:
# Every winning bid pays the critical value.

== Truthfulness of randomized mechanisms ==
There are various ways to extend the notion of truthfulness to randomized mechanisms. They are, from strongest to weakest:

* Universal truthfulness: for each randomization of the algorithm, the resulting mechanism is truthful. In other words: a universally-truthful mechanism is a randomization over deterministic truthful mechanisms, where the weights may be input-dependent.
* Strong stochastic-dominance truthfulness (strong-SD-truthfulness): The vector of probabilities that an agent receives by being truthful has first-order stochastic dominance over the vector of probabilities he gets by misreporting. That is: the probability of getting the top priority is at least as high AND the probability of getting one of the two top priorities is at least as high AND ... the probability of getting one of the &quot;m&quot; top priorities is at least as high.
* Lexicographic truthfulness (lex-truthfulness): The vector of probabilities that an agent receives by being truthful has lexicographic dominance over the vector of probabilities he gets by misreporting. That is: the probability of getting the top priority is higher OR (the probability of getting the top priority is equal and the probability of getting one of the two top priorities is higher) OR ... (the probability of getting the first &quot;m&quot;-1 priorities priority is equal and the probability of getting one of the &quot;m&quot; top priorities is higher) OR (all probabilities are equal).
* Weak stochastic-dominance truthfulness (weak-SD-truthfulness): The vector of probabilities that an agent receives by being truthful is not first-order-stochastically-dominated by the vector of probabilities he gets by misreporting. 

Universal implies strong-SD implies Lex implies weak-SD, and all implications are strict.

=== Truthfulness with high probability ===
For every constant formula_65, a randomized mechanism is called truthful with probability formula_66 if for every agent and for every vector of bids, the probability that the agent benefits by bidding non-truthfully is at most formula_67, where the probability is taken over the randomness of the mechanism.

If the constant formula_67 goes to 0 when the number of bidders grows, then the mechanism is called truthful with high probability. This notion is weaker than full truthfulness, but it is still useful in some cases; see e.g. consensus estimate.

== False-name-proofness ==
A new type of fraud that has become common with the abundance of internet-based auctions is &quot;false-name bids&quot; – bids submitted by a single bidder using multiple identifiers such as multiple e-mail addresses.

False-name-proofness means that there is no incentive for any of the players to issue false-name-bids. This is a stronger notion than strategyproofness. In particular, the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) auction is not false-name-proof.

False-name-proofness is importantly different from group strategyproofness because it assumes that an individual alone can simulate certain behaviors that normally require the collusive coordination of multiple individuals.

<doc id="886341" wikidata="Q3818224" url="?curid=886341" title="Horse culture">
<text>A horse culture is a tribal group or community whose day-to-day life revolves around the herding and breeding of horses. Beginning with the domestication of the horse on the steppes of Eurasia, the horse transformed each society that adopted its use. Notable examples are the Mongols of Mongolia, the Scythian and Turkic nomads of Central Asia, the Plains Indians, the Guaycuru peoples of the Gran Chaco, and the Mapuche and Tehuelche of Patagonia after horses were imported from Europe, particularly from Spain, during the 16th century.

== History ==
History offers many examples of horse cultures, such as the Huns and other peoples in Europe and Asia. Horse cultures tend to place a great deal of importance on horses and by their very nature are nomadic and usually hunter-gatherer or nomadic pastoralist societies. For example, the arrival of the horse in the Americas altered the cultures of the Native Americans in the Great Plains, the Gran Chaco and Patagonia. The horse increased mobility; the ability of the horse to cover a lot of ground in a very short period of time allowed native people to easily move from place to place, bringing on a nomadic shift in their culture, with an impact on transportation, trade, hunting and warfare.

However, there were also disadvantages to adopting horse culture, such as the increased responsibility of caring for the horses and keeping them healthy. Social structures of the community also had to shift to accommodate the physical space for horses to graze and feed easily.

<doc id="886353" wikidata="Q6711924" url="?curid=886353" title="M+NetMail">
<text>M+NetMail was an ISP-grade E-mail package by Messaging Architects. It was designed to deliver scalable messaging and calendaring services, using Internet-standard protocols (e.g. IMAP, iCalendar, POP, SMTP), across a large enterprise, or to a large group of users who are not particularly associated (for example, the user population of a typical ISP). The original name for the product, when owned by Novell, was Novell Internet Messaging System (NIMS). Messaging Architects showcased NetMail on its &quot;MyRealBox&quot; website, this service was discontinued on June 1, 2011.

In late February 2007, Novell sold the Netmail source code and brand name to Messaging Architects, which has since released a new version. This new version came with several long-awaited fixes along with a new &quot;web 2.0&quot; web mail client.

Since 2014 uses the brand name to deliver software solution. Netmail EMEA is as a formally subsidiary from Messaging Architects (called later Netmail/NetGovern) and now part of Ipro Tech.

==Positioning==
NetMail is not designed as a group collaboration software, such as Novell GroupWise, IBM Lotus Notes / Domino, or Microsoft Exchange Server. It is not positioned to compete with those products.

==Design==
M+NetMail is designed around open standards, including LDAP, PKCS, iCal, POP3, IMAP4, SSL, and S/MIME. Because it is standards-based, there is no &quot;native&quot; client. It instead works with any standards-based IMAP4, POP3 or iCal client. The web interface is likewise usable by most web browsers.

==Platforms==
M+NetMail&#x27;s server components run atop a variety of platforms, letting the NetMail customer choose the platform most appropriate to their environment. In contrast, some competing products attempt to lock their customers into a single platform. NetMail components are available for SUSE and Red Hat Linux, Novell NetWare v5.1 and later, Novell Open Enterprise Server (in both its OES-Linux and OES-NetWare versions), and Microsoft Windows platforms.

<doc id="886355" wikidata="Q4652031" url="?curid=886355" title="AJ6">
<text>AJ6 was a Jewish organisation open to all Jews in school years 11-13 in the UK. It was founded in 1977.
AJ6 was peer-led and had its own constitution. Until 2007, It ran both a membership side and a services side, the latter covering schools and campus. However, in October 2007, AJ6 handed over the services part of the organisation to the UJIA. In July 2009, AJ6 ceased to exist in its previous form, teaming up with UJIA-JAMS to deliver activities through both mainstream and Jewish schools. In September 2023 the delivery of provision for Jewish students in mainstream schools (JAMS) and Jewish 6th form provision. 

==Activities==
Following the closure of AJ6 in 2009, a new programme of activities such as campus visits, university mentors, campus skills training, advocacy sessions and university activist training is being developed. These new activities will be planned and run by professional youth workers, with input and assistance from experienced students and from sixtform participants. The programmes will be run with a similar ethos as AJ6 always had: cross-communal participation, an emphasis on peer leadership and an inclusive and supportive atmosphere for debate.

==History==
AJ6&#x27;s vision was of an educated and tolerant Jewish community, responsible for one another, excited and enriched by its Judaism and inspired by its younger members. Its mission was to educate and develop Jewish fifth- and sixth-formers, enabling them to shape Jewish life at school, on campus and in the wider community.

AJ6 held regional meetings, where Jews aged 15–18 met with each other to socialize, discuss issues relevant to their lives and talk about future events.

In 2005 at AJ6&#x27;s national conference, Shlomi, a small town on the northern Israeli border was made a region, making AJ6 an international movement. AJ6 had strong connections with Shlomi and invited young people over for conference, as well as giving them the opportunity to participate in AJ6&#x27;s annual Israel and Europe tours in the summer. Conference 2006 saw the election of Shlomi&#x27;s first regional chair, Doron Gerlitz. In addition to this, AJ6 Israel Tour Participants stayed in Shlomi with young Israelis for 2 days as part of the mifgashim, or encounters in order to educate AJ6 members about life in Israel.

As well as regional activities AJ6 ran four major national events a year: National Weekends in October, April and July and a five-day Conference in December. There were also at least two national &quot;balls&quot; each year: the Spring Ball and the summer Boat Ball.

Like many other Jewish youth movements, AJ6 ran summer tours to Israel and Europe. In 2006, AJ6 became the first movement to include Paris on its Europe tour and in 2007 AJ6 was the first movement to run a 2 week Israel tour.

AJ6 also had its own gap year programme, AJ6 Yearscheme - &quot;Shnat Hachshorah&quot;. Each year, about half a dozen participants from the UK and several from Shlomi spent ten months in Israel.

<doc id="886363" wikidata="Q7690168" url="?curid=886363" title="Taylor University">
<text>Taylor University is a private, interdenominational, evangelical Christian university in Upland, Indiana. Founded in 1846, it is one of the oldest evangelical Christian universities in the United States.

The university is named after Bishop William Taylor (1821–1902). The university sits on an approximately campus on the south side of Upland. It also preserves a arboretum and an additional of undeveloped land northeast of campus which has more of arboretum space.

As of 2022, Taylor University has 1,798 undergraduate students, 33 graduate students, and 395 distance learning students. The student body hails from 38 states and 26 foreign countries, with 44 percent from Indiana. Taylor is a member of NAIA with 16 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports teams. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities and the Christian College Consortium.

In August 2021, D. Michael Lindsay was named as the current president.

==History==
=== Founding ===
In 1846, Taylor University was originally established as Fort Wayne Female College in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In the first full year of the school, about 100 women were enrolled, paying $22.50 per year. During this time, it was common for women to obtain an M.E.L. degree, the Mistress of English Literature. Fort Wayne Female College was founded by the Methodist Church as an all-female school.

In 1850, Fort Wayne Female College started admitting men coeducationally and changed its name to Fort Wayne College.

In 1890, Fort Wayne College acquired the former facilities of nearby Fort Wayne Medical College that were vacated after Fort Wayne Medical College&#x27;s merger with Indiana Asbury College, another Methodist-affiliated college. Upon completing this acquisition, Fort Wayne College changed its name to Taylor University in honor of Bishop William Taylor. The original Taylor University campus was on College Street in Fort Wayne.

=== Move to Upland ===

In 1882, a guest-preaching engagement in the Upland Methodist Church afforded Fort Wayne College president Thaddeus Reade the chance to meet the minister of Upland Methodist Church, Rev. John C. White. Because the school was having financial difficulties at its location in Fort Wayne, White and Upland citizen J.W. Pittinger worked to bring the school to Upland.

In the spring of 1893, White negotiated an agreement between the trustees of the now-named Taylor University and the Upland Land Company. The university agreed to move to Upland, Indiana, and the company agreed to provide Taylor with $10,000 in cash and of land. That summer, Taylor University relocated to Upland. White was able to find the resources to support Taylor University because of the recent discovery of large deposits of natural gas in the area.

In 1915, Taylor paid seven thousand dollars to purchase more from Charles H. and Bertha Snyder.

Early in the 1920s, the university added another to its present location when the Lewis Jones farm was purchased. After 1922, Taylor University was no longer formally affiliated with Methodism.

=== Summit Christian College and Fort Wayne ===
In 1992, ninety-nine years after moving to Upland, Taylor University acquired Summit Christian College located in the city of Fort Wayne. The college was subsequently renamed Taylor 
University Fort Wayne. Summit Christian College was founded in 1904 as the Bible Training School of Fort Wayne, later becoming Fort Wayne Bible Institute, and eventually, in 1950, Fort Wayne Bible College. In 1989 the school was renamed Summit Christian College. Prior to acquisition by Taylor University, Summit Christian College was affiliated with the Missionary Church.

With the urban setting of the campus in Fort Wayne, the academic programs tended to be more vocational and its student body more non-traditional. Reflecting this, of TUFW&#x27;s 1,040 member student body, approximately 224 students lived on campus with the rest commuting or taking courses online. Popular majors included Professional Writing, Biblical Studies, Christian Ministries, Education, English, and Business.

The Taylor University Fort Wayne Falcons participated in the United States Collegiate Athletic Association. The school offered basketball for men and women, soccer for men and women (2008–2009 was the first year for the women&#x27;s program), and women&#x27;s volleyball.

On October 13, 2008, the university announced plans to discontinue traditional undergraduate programs on the Fort Wayne Campus. Programs that remained after the closure or were transitioned to the Upland campus included the MBA program, the online program, and the radio station, WBCL.

===2006 Van accident===

On April 26, 2006, Taylor received national attention when a university van was involved in a fatal accident outside Marion, Indiana, while traveling between the Fort Wayne and Upland campuses. The accident happened when a northbound semi-trailer truck driver fell asleep at the wheel, crossed the median and struck the southbound passenger van on I-69. Four students and one staff member were killed, and three staff members and one student were injured. The accident occurred two days before former university president Eugene Habecker&#x27;s inauguration ceremony. The truck driver was convicted of reckless, involuntary manslaughter and received a four-year prison sentence.

The Grant County coroner and Taylor officials failed to positively identify all the victims. The incident made international headlines when there was a case of mistaken identity between two of the victims. Senior Laura Van Ryn, who died on the scene, was mistaken for surviving freshman Whitney Cerak. A funeral was conducted with a closed casket for Whitney Cerak, and the mistake was not discovered until Cerak identified herself after waking up from a coma over a month later.

On May 23, 2009, Cerak graduated from Taylor, and the two families remain close.

On April 26, 2008, the second anniversary of the accident, the university dedicated the $2.4 million Memorial Prayer Chapel as a memorial to the victims: students Laurel Erb, Brad Larson, Betsy Smith and Laura Van Ryn, along with Taylor employee Monica Felver. As a result of this incident, Indiana changed its procedure for identifying victims involved in accidents.

=== Vision 2016 ===
Upon inauguration President Eugene Habecker unveiled his Taylor University Vision 2016 plan for the university. The initiative involved the creation of several centers of excellence on campus. The Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence was established and endowed. The center for Scripture engagement was partially endowed. And centers for Missions Computing, Ethics, C.S. Lewis and Faith, Film, and Media are in the process of being created. Programs were created in Ireland and Ecuador. The initiative involved the construction of several buildings around campus:

* 2008: The Prayer Chapel, built in memorial of the 2006 van crash was completed;
* 2008: Campbell Hall, an off campus university apartment complex completed;
* 2012: The Euler Science Complex, an addition to the Nussbaum science complex completed;
* 2012: Wolgemuth Hall an off campus university apartment complex completed;
* 2013: Breuinger Hall a residence hall connected to Gerig hall completed; and
* 2016: LaRita Boren Campus Center, a replacement for the old student union was completed.
* 2016: As well, as upgrades to athletic facilities, landscaping, and other buildings were also undertaken.

=== Res Publica controversy ===
In 2018, several professors who believed their fundamentalist and conservative viewpoints were not well represented in the student newspaper published an anonymous underground newspaper called &quot;Excalibur&quot;. The student newspaper responded by asserting that they had not refused to publish any submitted articles and that when the associated professors published a piece in the newspaper the prior year they received pushback from the student body. The university president Lowell Haines criticized the publications, citing the targeted distribution of the paper in rooms of minorities and supporters of social justice, along with the unaccountability and inability to create and maintain dialogue with anonymous publications. At this point the authors of the newspaper, Jim Spiegel, Gary Ross, Richard Smith, and Ben Wehling, came forward, apologized for any perceived slights due to distribution, and stated that their goal was to create dialogue about viewpoints they felt were under-represented Several open letters were published, with one addressing the newspapers arguments directly, and another criticizing what it saw as the president&#x27;s harsh response.

=== 2019 Commencement controversy ===
On March 24, 2019, university president Paul Lowell Haines announced that Vice President Mike Pence would be delivering the commencement speech at the 2019 graduation ceremonies. Controversy was immediate, the faculty voting on a motion of dissent, with 61 against the Pence invitation, 41 in favor and 3 abstaining. Competing petitions were organized, calling for the invitation to be rescinded or supporting the invitation. Student and faculty organized protests to walk out before the commencement speech, or to sit silently during the speech. Students and faculty expressed several reasons for protesting: the lack of faculty and student input into the decision, concerns that Pence&#x27;s invitation was an endorsement of specific political and religious views, Pence&#x27;s affiliation with President Donald Trump, and the belief that Pence did not represent the same Christian values the university endorsed. On May 18, 2019, dozens of students and several faculty members walked out of commencement ceremonies shortly before Pence delivered the commencement address. The majority of students and faculty remained seated. At the end of his speech, Pence received a standing ovation, during which the majority of students and faculty that remained stayed silent and seated. Afterwards, students linked hands and sang the doxology in an attempt to show that even if they have different viewpoints, they can still respect and love each other. On June 24, university president Haines resigned, effective August 15, 2019.

There are 100 undergraduate programs, in 61 majors, with popular focuses including education, business, new media and exercise science.

In 2003, Taylor began offering graduate-level programs again after having dropped such degrees nearly 60 years earlier. Since then, the university has expanded its offerings to include a Master of Environmental Science, a Master of Business Administration, a Master of Arts in Higher Education and Student Development (MAHE), and a Master of Arts in Ministry.

The concept of integration of faith and learning, the idea that knowledge and faith meet their highest potential when coupled together, is a central educational theme at Taylor. The two distinct columns of the Rice Bell Tower on campus and the spotlights that shine up from each of them symbolize this theme to the campus community.

===Overseas campuses===
Besides offering a number of off-campus programs, Taylor hosts two of its own study abroad programs – in Ecuador and Ireland. The Ecuador program is run through the university&#x27;s Spencer Centre for Global Engagement and is based in Cuenca. The semester-long, immersion program involves a three-prong partnership with Taylor University, the Universidad del Azuay, and the Arco Church of Cuenca.

The Irish Studies Program is based at Coolnagreina in seaside Greystones. Courses are taught by the university&#x27;s own professors.

===Accreditation and memberships===
Taylor University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Specific programs at the university are also accredited by the Council on Social Work Education, and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. Taylor&#x27;s music program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music and programs in Computer Engineering and Engineering Physics are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.

==Campus life==

===Life Together Covenant===
Students, faculty and staff are required to sign the &quot;Life Together Covenant&quot; (LTC) upon joining the university. Community members pledge to adhere to certain standards of conduct and refrain from certain behaviors, including social dancing (excepting marriages taking place off of school property and choreographed or folk dance), premarital sex, homosexuality, smoking, and the consumption of alcohol, with the intention of strengthening the community as a whole. Students cannot register for classes or housing unless they have signed the LTC pledge each year. The LTC is viewed as not only a covenant, but as a binding contract as well. Penalties for not adhering to the LTC range from &quot;citizenship probation&quot; to expulsion from the university. In 2013 the dancing rule was modified to allow officially sanctioned school dances.

The Life Together Covenant covers activities and behaviors not only on the Taylor campus, but off-campus as well. The purpose is to strengthen the Christian community and to maintain a sense of maturity and accountability.

Chapel services are held three times a week, from 10:00 to 10:50 a.m. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Services generally follow a modern nontraditional Christian theme. Chapel attendance is encouraged but attendance is on the honor system. Chapel is always well attended.

===Multicultural development===

Multicultural students are supported by the Office of Intercultural Programs, and other faculty and staff through various student leadership groups, social clubs, and programs on campus. Programs include International Student Society, Multicultural Student Association, Mu Kappa International (founded at Taylor in 1985), Asian Society for Intercultural Awareness, Black Student Union, Middle Eastern Cultural Association, Voices of Praise Gospel Choir, and Latino Student Union. These groups and their subsequent events and programs play a role the university&#x27;s goal of &quot;...promoting diversity awareness, social justice, and globally minded Christianity throughout the campus&quot;.

==Campus facilities==

===Academic facilities===

In 1902, Sickler Hall, the oldest of three remaining original buildings on the campus, was built with a gift from the estate of Christopher Sickler, an early Taylor trustee. Originally, the building was a residence hall that provided free housing for the children of ministers and missionaries. Later, it served as a science hall and educational department center; more recently, it was the location of the communication arts department. Remodeled in 1995, Sickler Hall currently houses the William Taylor Foundation, professional writing department, and alumni and parent relations. A campus prayer chapel is located on the main floor and is open 24 hours a day for personal worship, meditation, and prayer.

In 1911, Helena Memorial Hall was built and is the second oldest building on campus. It serves as the university welcome center. The building was drastically remodeled in 1987 and houses Admissions and the Offices of the President and Provost. First a music building and then art and theatre building, this building is named for Mrs. Helena Gehman, an early benefactress to the university.

In 1986, Zondervan Library was opened and is a sprawling complex at the center of campus. Named in honor of Peter J. &quot;Pat&quot; Zondervan and his wife, Mary, who contributed over $1 million to the project. Part of the complex is the Engstrom Galleria and Special Collections &amp; University Archives which houses the British Author Collections. The collections consist of first editions, manuscripts, photographs, and other materials related to the lives and works of the five collected authors: C.S. Lewis, George MacDonald, Dorothy Sayers, Charles Williams, and Owen Barfield.

Sitting beside the library complex is the Rice Bell Tower. It is one of the distinctive architectural elements to the campus and stands at 71 feet, 10 inches in height. (The &quot;bell&quot; tower contains no bells, merely loudspeakers contained inside painted metal boxes.) It was dedicated in memory of Garnet I. Rice&#x27;s husband, Raymond. The twin spires of the tower that meet at the apex of the structure symbolize the integration of faith and learning.

On the west side of campus is the Jim Wheeler Memorial Stadium with a seating capacity of 4,000. It has been the home of Trojan football since its completion in 1980. It was built with funds donated by 1954 alumnus John Wheeler in memory of his son, Jim Wheeler, an aspiring Christian recording artist who died of cancer shortly after his graduation from the university in 1979.

In 1958, the Taylor University Dome was designed by Orus Eash and built. It originally was the campus cafeteria, and later served as the student union. In June 2022, the building was demolished to make way for a new film and entrepreneurship building.

In 2003, the Modelle Metcalf Visual Arts Center opened and includes 38,000 square feet of art studios, computer design labs, teaching auditoriums, and art galleries.

In 2004, the Kesler Student Activity Center (KSAC, named after president emeritus Jay Kesler), was completed and features 88,000 square feet of athletic activities space, including an indoor track, multi-purpose courts used for intramural sports, an exercise room, an aerobics room, and multiple locker rooms.

In January 2011, the Eichling Aquatics Wing was completed and includes a lap pool and several classrooms and offices.

In 2010, the university began a massive $41.1 million, addition to its Nussbuam science education complex on the south-east side of campus. The building was completed in time for the 2012 fall semester and dedicated during Homecoming weekend. Named the Euler Science Complex, the center featured two wind turbines; and still features a heliostat, green roofing, geothermal heating and cooling, and solar paneling. With an emphasis on sustainable energy, the university hopes not only to save energy and costs, but also to use these features as a teaching tool. The university has received a Gold LEED certification for the new complex.

===Residence halls===
Bergwall Hall, 1989, was occupied and named for Evan Bergwall Sr., president of Taylor University (1951–1959) during the fall semester of 1989 and currently houses 195 students—women on the third and fourth floors and men on the first and second floors. Each floor has a lounge and study facilities and communal bathrooms.

Breuninger Hall was opened to students in 2013 and is the newest residence hall. Located on the south side of campus, it houses 150 students across one floor of men and two floors of women.

English Hall, 1975, opened on the far south end of campus, is a women&#x27;s residence hall housing 224 students. It is named for Mary Tower English, the spouse of one of Taylor&#x27;s most distinguished graduates. English Hall provides private living room areas as rooms are arranged around a suite that is shared by 8–12 women. It is of a unique compartmental brutalism architecture.

Olson Hall was constructed in the 1960s and named in honor of long-time and distinguished history professor Grace D. Olson. It is the largest residence hall (in terms of housing) on the campus with 300 beds. The hall underwent major renovations between 2006 and 2008. The hall is arranged along a typical corridor with a shared common bath.

Mirrored by Olson is Wengatz Hall, 1965, named for alumnus John C. Wengatz, a pioneer missionary to Africa. It houses 266 men.

Samuel Morris Hall, 1990, was completed, and colloquially referred to as “Sammy,” and named in honor of late 19th century African student Samuel Morris and is the university&#x27;s most modern large-scale residence hall and its largest in terms of square feet. It sits on the northeast corner of campus and houses 286 men. It is the third building named after Morris, the second being demolished in the mid-1990s. The building has four floors, each with its own unique culture and traditions: Foundation, Sammy II, The Brotherhood, and Penthouse.

Swallow Robin Hall, 1917, is the oldest residence hall and third oldest building on campus by Samuel Plato. and then remodeled and restored in the fall of 1990. Silas C. Swallow and his wife (maiden name Robin) financed a major portion of the original construction cost for the building and asked that it be named in honor of their mothers. The hall was designed by Samuel Plato, a notable architect of the early 20th century.

Most recently, the university added two new off-campus housing apartment halls on the north side of campus:

* Campell Hall, 2008, at was constructed in 2008 and opening that fall, is named in honor of Walt and Mary Campbell. It is located on the northwest edge of campus and consists of fifteen apartments housing 60 upper-level students in an apartment-style setting. 
* Wolgemuth Hall, 2011, the larger, opened in fall of 2011 and incorporates the architectural style of Samuel Plato. At it has room for 92 upper-level students and is named after Sam and Grace Wolgemuth.

Haakonsen Hall, 1975, was constructed as the student health center. The building is named after medical care provider Lily Haakonsen who was employed by the university. In 2006 it was renovated and re-purposed as housing. Since then, it has served a variety of purposes and is currently home to Taylor University Media Services.

==Athletics==
The Taylor athletic teams are called the Trojans. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Crossroads League (formerly known as the Mid-Central College Conference (MCCC) until after the 2011–12 school year) since the 1994–95 academic year. The Trojans previously competed in the Indiana Collegiate Athletic Conference (ICAC; now currently known as the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference (HCAC) since the 1998–99 school year) of the NCAA Division III ranks from 1987–88 to 1990–91.

Taylor competes in 16 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include competitive cheer. Former sports included men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis.

===Football===
The Taylor football program competes in the Mideast League of the Mid-States Football Association. The Trojans football team ended the 2009 season ranked #19 in the NAIA coaches poll. After their first winning season since 2015, the Trojans football team finished the 2024 season ranked #22 in the NAIA coaches poll. The Trojans went 9-2, their second most wins in a season in program history. 

===Volleyball===
The Taylor women&#x27;s volleyball 2009 season ended in a single elimination game as part of the top 12 teams in the NAIA playoffs with the team ranked #11 in the NAIA.

=== Cross Country ===
The Taylor men&#x27;s cross country team has qualified for NAIA nationals 32 times. They ran to a runner-up finish in 2019 and went on to win nationals in 2020 giving Taylor its first NAIA national championship in any sport. The program has also won 22 Conference Championships.

The Taylor women&#x27;s cross country team has qualified for NAIA nationals 15 times. They ran to a third-place finish in both 2018 and 2020. In 2022 the Trojans ran to an undefeated season and won NAIA nationals scoring only 50 points after being led by fourth-place finisher Abbey Brennan and having all five scoring runners finish in the top 20. The program also has 12 conference championships including ten in a row from 2013 to 2022.

Both teams are currently coached by Taylor alumni and Taylor professor of education Quinn White. Coach White won the USTFCCCA NAIA Men&#x27;s National Coach of the year award in 2021 and proceeded to win the women&#x27;s award in 2022. Coach White has also been named Crossroads League coach of the year ten times as well as being named the USTFCCCA Great Lakes Region coach of the year multiple times.

===Basketball===

====Silent Night====
Every year the Friday before final exams, Taylor University has the Silent Night Men&#x27;s Basketball game. In it, students remain quiet until the tenth point is scored and then erupt in cheering. In the late moments of the game, &quot;Silent Night&quot; is sung. A former assistant coach came up with the idea in the late 80s and it was a packed event by the mid-to-late 1990s. Afterward, students can go to the President&#x27;s campus-wide party involving live Christmas music, making and eating Christmas cookies, and making gingerbread houses. The 2010 game was more formally named the 27th Annual Ivanhoe Classic and resulted in a 112–67 win over Ohio State-Marion. This was the most scored by the Taylor men&#x27;s basketball team since the 1993–94 squad scored 139 points in a victory over Robert Morris University (Illinois). This allowed Taylor students to quiet down and erupt in celebration again after the 100th point. Casey Coons scored the tenth point in the 2009 Silent Night, the 2010 Silent Night, and 2011 silent night on free throws. Casey Coons received the NAIA Mid-Central College Conference Division II Player of the Week award for the week of the 2010 game. Coach Paul Patterson coached without shoes for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 games to raise money for Samaritan&#x27;s Feet (400 pairs of shoes were raised at the 2009 event for the Dominican Republic and 170 pairs of shoes were raised for Guatemala at the 2010 event). Sports Illustrated paid tribute to the Silent Night Event in its December 27, 2010, issue. The 2011 game received significant media attention as well.
The 2014 Silent Night game was a 91–59 victory over Kentucky Christian and was covered by ESPN.

==Media==
Taylor university operates a radio station, WTUR, with student-led talk shows, student-selected music, and chapel services.
Taylor University currently has entered into a partnership with and simulcasts WBCL on 87.9, the frequency WTUR used to broadcast on. Currently WTUR is solely broadcast online. Taylor also hosts a student newspaper, &quot;The Echo&quot;, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2012–13. The paper is both print and online. The &quot;Ilium&quot;, Taylor&#x27;s annual yearbook, is a 200+ page print publication put together by students.

<doc id="886367" wikidata="Q3211569" url="?curid=886367" title="La Petite Vie">
<text>La petite vie was first a stage sketch of the comedy duo Ding et Dong, formed by Claude Meunier and Serge Thériault, and later a hit Quebec television sitcom aired by Radio-Canada from 1993 to 1999. In total, 59 episodes were created plus 3 specials, two for Christmas and one for New Year&#x27;s 2000.

Widely considered a classic of the Quebec television, it was the first Canadian TV show (of either English or French language) to ever gather more than 4 million viewers, a performance it achieved twice in 1995 (since surpassed by &quot;Bye Bye 2018&quot; with 4.41 million).

A new 6-episode series will be aired in early 2024 featuring nearly all the main actors except Serge Thériault, who made a cameo appearance at the end of the final episode.

==Synopsis==
The stories of &quot;La petite vie&quot;, sketch and television show, revolve around the strange couple simply known as &quot;Pôpa&quot; and &quot;Môman&quot; (Quebec Joual for &quot;pa&quot; and &quot;ma&quot;). The sketch was memorable for the pillow talk scenes with the beds comically placed straight up so the actors, seemingly laid on the bed but still standing (a pun with the French saying «&quot;histoire à dormir debout&quot;» &quot;story to sleep standing-up&quot;, a story that doesn&#x27;t make sense), would be clearly visible to the theater public. This would be kept in the sitcom, where the context made it even more surreal.

While the sketch usually featured only the couple, the sitcom introduced a vast array of relatives, creating very bizarre but endearing caricature of a &quot;Québécois&quot; working class family.

<doc id="886371" wikidata="Q16842233" url="?curid=886371" title="Have You Fed the Fish?">
<text>Have You Fed the Fish? is an album released by Badly Drawn Boy (born Damon Gough) in 2002. The album&#x27;s title originates from the question which Gough asks his daughter each day &quot;to the point where it got to sound like one of those words you say too many times and it sounds silly.&quot;

Also included with the album&#x27;s release was a competition. Placed within certain copies of the album, the &quot;5 Golden Fish&quot; would win the owner a song writing session with Gough. However, the prizes remain unclaimed. The fish, it seems, have remained hidden.

In 2003 Damon presented the Manchester 24 photographic gallery with a picture of his children&#x27;s goldfish after being asked to take photos of his life during a 24-hour period.
&quot;It&#x27;s either me or my girlfriend or my daughter. I let her feed them but she tends to overfeed them which can kill them and if you don&#x27;t feed them enough that can kill them, so it&#x27;s real poignant subject. You&#x27;ve got to be careful with fish.&quot;

&quot;Have You Fed The Fish?&quot; contained Badly Drawn Boy&#x27;s highest-charting single &quot;You Were Right&quot;, which received heavy airplay on BBC Radio 2 and got to number 9 in the charts—his only top ten single. &quot;You Were Right&quot; also earned him a performance on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

==Cover art==
The album art and sleeves feature some famous names.
*Lady on front cover: Jane Birkin; her daughter Charlotte Gainsbourg sings on the album.
*Man on reverse with mustache: a Groucho Marx puppet.
*Inside pages: Damon&#x27;s girlfriend Clare, and their children Eddie and Oscar.
*On the boat in the inside pages: Damon Gough; Anna of Misty Dixon fame; DJ and artist Andy Votel; Jane Weaver, also from Misty Dixon; Dave Tyack.

The photo of Damon alongside the album credits was taken in his house.

<text>Ciel, mon Pinard! was a very popular Quebec cooking show on Télé-Québec with Daniel Pinard as main chef and Josée Di Stasio as assistant. While many kitchen shows tend to be formulaic, the success of this programme was in its offbeat, poetic digressions of the knowledgeable Pinard. The show was a springboard for Di Stasio, who went off to star in her own cooking show, À la Di Stasio, after Pinard left the programme. The title is a pun on the legendary line &quot;Ciel, mon mari!&quot; (&quot;Heavens, my husband!&quot;) from the plays of French playwright Georges Feydeau.

<doc id="886383" wikidata="Q940646" url="?curid=886383" title="Level 9 Computing">
<text>Level 9 was a British developer of computer software, active between 1981 and 1991. Founded by Mike, Nicholas and Pete Austin, the company produced software for the BBC Micro, Nascom, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Oric, Atari 8-bit computers, Camputers Lynx, RML 380Z, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Amiga, Apple II, Memotech MTX, and Enterprise platforms and is best known for its successful text adventure games until a general decline in the text adventure market forced their closure in June 1991.

Level 9&#x27;s first release was an extension to Nascom BASIC called &quot;Extension Basic&quot;. The first game, also for the Nascom, was called &quot;Fantasy&quot; and was similar to &quot;Valhalla&quot;, but with no graphics. Other products from that era were &quot;Missile Defence&quot;, &quot;Bomber&quot; and &quot;Space Invasion&quot; — all for the Nascom. The tapes were duplicated and sent out by mail order by the brothers based on orders generated by the classified advertisements they ran in the &quot;Computing Today&quot; magazine. They were originally based in High Wycombe, Bucks before moving to the West Country.

==A-code==
Level 9 devised their own interpreted language, A-code, around 1979. It was very memory efficient, mainly due to the advanced text compression routines which could compress texts to about 50%. The game data, which was identical for all platforms, was incorporated into the executable file for specific machines, together with the interpreter part. A-code underwent a few revisions: there are three distinct versions in all, plus several extensions which form new A-code versions of their own.

(Level 9 A-code should not be confused with the A-code language developed by Dave Platt in 1979 for the purpose of writing the highly popular 550 points extension of the original Adventure game.)

In some ways A-code and the A-machine virtual machine were even more impressive than rival Infocom&#x27;s ZIL and Z-machine; both companies initially designed games for computers with 32K RAM and ZIL was in many ways more sophisticated. But Infocom products of the era required a disk drive, alleviating the memory restrictions of the platforms of the time. Level 9 due to different dynamics in the British market had to deliver their text adventures on cassette tapes, which generally meant that programs had to be loaded in one go and that they had to completely fit into memory. Andrew Deeley, who worked for Level 9 on Software Development, recalls how the use of the A-Code interpreter enabled L9 to produce hundreds of cross platform versions of their entire catalogue in the space of 18 months, &quot;with so many 8 bit computers on the markets and the introduction of Macs, Amigas and Atari STs, developing for cross platform versions of a game was becoming prohibitive in cost back in the late 1980s / early 1990s. Level 9 were able to hold their own as a small developer because they were able to optimise cross platform production of their games&quot;.
The first game to use this system was &quot;Colossal Adventure&quot; in early 1982, a faithful conversion of &quot;Adventure&quot; by Will Crowther and Don Woods, but with 70 extra locations to the end game to fulfill Level 9&#x27;s preexisting claim in advertisements of &quot;over 200&quot; locations; a remarkable achievement given that Gordon Letwin&#x27;s port of &quot;Adventure&quot; to the TRS-80 required a disk drive. That year the company produced two sequels, &quot;Adventure Quest&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Adventure&quot;, both of which featured the Demon Lord Agaliarept. The three titles became known as the &quot;Middle-earth&quot; trilogy, with a reference in the instructions to &quot;Dungeon Adventure&quot; to the city of Minas Tirith, which features in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. When enhanced versions of the three games were published by Rainbird Software, the reference to Middle-earth was quietly deleted; the series became known as &quot;Jewels of Darkness&quot;; and Minas Tirith became Valaii. In 1985 Level 9 started to develop their games for disk based systems also.

&quot;Snowball&quot; was the first adventure in the &quot;Silicon Dreams&quot; trilogy, followed by &quot;Return to Eden&quot; and &quot;The Worm in Paradise&quot;. &quot;Red Moon&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Price of Magik&quot; were bundled together with &quot;Lords of Time&quot; by Mandarin Software to create yet another trilogy: &quot;Time and Magik&quot;.

&quot;Lancelot&quot; was published by Mandarin Software, a division of Europress Software in 1988. The first person to solve the puzzle in the game won a replica of the Holy Grail, made of solid silver, encrusted with semi-precious stones (amethysts, garnets and opals), with the inside plated in 22-carat gold.

<text>The Baltic Institute () in Gdańsk is a scientific society researching the topics of the Baltic Sea countries, maritime economic issues, and Polish-German and Polish-Scandinavian relations.

== History ==

The Baltic Institute was established in 1925 in Toruń, beginning real activities in 1927, with the main goal of documenting the Polish heritage in Pomerania after 100 years of German occupation and Germanization practices. In 1931 a branch was established in Gdynia. During the German occupation of Poland in World War II the institute was abolished by the Nazis.

The Baltic Institute was re-established in 1945 with its headquarters first in Bydgoszcz, Sopot and then in Gdańsk. New branches were opened in Gdynia, Sopot, Toruń, Bydgoszcz and Szczecin. During the big reorganization of the scientific societies in Pomerania, in 1950 the institute became a part of the Western Institute in Poznań, but was made independent again in 1958 with its headquarters in Gdańsk.

== Research areas ==

The Baltic Institute conducts research in the following areas:
* knowledge of Scandinavia, and Polish-Scandinavian relations.
* Polish-German relation, especially related to Gdańsk Pomerania and the Baltic Sea area.
* the newest history and economic cooperation in the Baltic Sea area after World War II.

== Main publications ==

* &quot;Komunikaty Instytutu Bałtyckiego&quot; (The Baltic Institute Messages)
* &quot;Gdańskie Zeszyty Humanistyczne&quot; (Gdansk Humanistic Volumes)

<doc id="886394" wikidata="Q3240063" url="?curid=886394" title="Above the fold">
<text>Above the fold is the upper half of the of a newspaper or tabloid where an important news story or photograph is often located. Papers are often displayed to customers folded so that only the top half of the front page is visible. Thus, an item that is &quot;above the fold&quot; may be one that the editors feel will entice people to buy the paper. Alternatively, it reflects a decision, on the part of the editors, that the article is one of the day&#x27;s most important. By extension, the space above the fold is also preferred by advertisers, since it is the most prominent and visible even when the newspaper is on stands.

The term can be used more generally to refer to anything that is prominently displayed or of highest priority. Above the fold is sometimes used in web development to refer the portions of a webpage that are visible without further scrolling or clicking. In contrast, portions available via clickthrough are sometimes described as &quot;after the jump&quot;.

== In web design ==
Above the fold is also used in website design (along with &quot;above the scroll&quot;) to refer to the portion of the webpage that is visible without scrolling. As screen sizes vary drastically there is no set definition for the number of pixels that define the fold. This is because different screen resolutions will show different portions of the website without scrolling. Further complicating matters, many websites adjust their layout based on the size of the browser window, such that the fold is not a static feature of the page.

A 2006 study by Jakob Nielsen found that 77% of visitors to a website do not scroll, and therefore only see the portion of the website that is above the fold. In a more recent article by Amy Schade and NNgroup it is stated that there is an 84% average difference in how users treat the content above and below the fold, there is a big dropoff in attention below the fold. Most web design advice available today encourages designers to place important information at the top of the website, but also to prioritize usability and design.

Nevertheless, many web advertising companies require ads be placed above the fold. Marketing research done by Google shows that the viewability of adverts is affected by its position in relation to the fold as there is a significant drop-off below the fold. Each company tends to use their own definition of the fold. The BlogHer advertising network, for example, defines the fold as the top 768 pixels of the page. The FoodieBlogRoll advertising network defines the fold as the top 1000 pixels.

== Other variants ==
Newspaper stories that appear below the fold are said to be located &quot;under the fold.&quot;

Internet search query results appear much in the same way. Many web site optimization efforts may be exerted in an attempt to gain the highest &quot;search indexing&quot; or &quot;ranking&quot; placement (as close to first place as possible) for directed term(s) or phrase(s). Using natural or &quot;organic&quot; web site optimization practices has been the standard operating procedure for attaining higher indexing with the result being the web site appearing in the view area or &quot;above the fold&quot; of the search results pages and especially the first page.

The term is infrequently used in reference to resume and CV (curriculum vitae) layout, where the most crucial and relevant (to the job sought) information must be in the top third, alternately called the &quot;hot zone&quot;, to catch the attention of the reader. Since most applicants file credentials electronically, and applications are no longer folded in thirds to fit in an envelope, the advice remains, even though the means of distribution has changed.

== Below the fold ==

&quot;Below the fold&quot; refers to the parts of a newspaper or tabloid that are not on the first half of the first page, and are therefore less prominent. It can also refer to the part of a webpage that do not show until one scrolls down.

When Apple was ordered to display acknowledgements that Samsung did &quot;not&quot; infringe their designs, complaints surfaced because JavaScript code on its UK webpage kept the acknowledgement hidden &quot;below the fold&quot;.

<doc id="886421" wikidata="Q469761" url="?curid=886421" title="Donald Kagan">
<text>Donald Kagan (; May 1, 1932August 6, 2021) was a Lithuanian-born American historian and classicist at Yale University specializing in ancient Greece. He formerly taught in the Department of History at Cornell University. Kagan was considered among the foremost American scholars of Greek history and is notable for his four-volume history of the Peloponnesian War.

==Early life and education==
Kagan was born in Kuršėnai, Lithuania, on May 1, 1932, to a Jewish family. His father, Shmuel, died before Kagan turned two years old, and his mother, Leah (Benjamin), subsequently emigrated to the United States with Kagan and his sister. He grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. He attended Thomas Jefferson High School, where he played football, before becoming the first person in his family to go to college. He graduated from Brooklyn College in 1954, received a master&#x27;s degree in classics from Brown University in 1955, and a Ph.D. in history from the Ohio State University in 1958.

==Academic career==

Donald Kagan&#x27;s political views underwent a significant shift around 1969, moving from liberalism towards neoconservatism. This change occurred following student protests at Cornell University, which led to the establishment of a Black Studies program following the student occupation of Willard Straight Hall. Kagan felt the university administration&#x27;s response was inadequate, deeply impacting his political outlook. He became one of the original signatories of the 1997 Statement of Principles by the neoconservative think tank Project for the New American Century, co-founded by his son Robert. In the lead-up to the 2000 presidential elections, Kagan and his other son, Frederick, published &quot;While America Sleeps&quot;, advocating for increased defense spending.

Known for his prolific research on the Peloponnesian War; Kagan is also famous for his work &quot;On the Origins of War and the Preservation of Peace&quot;, a comparative history examining four major conflicts (the Peloponnesian War, World War I, the Second Punic War, and World War II) and one non-conflict (the Cuban Missile Crisis) with the purpose of identifying how and why wars do or do not begin. Remarking in 2015 on the work, Kagan summarized the causes of war by quoting Thucydides: &quot;You know, Thucydides has this great insight. I wish I could get people to pay attention – he has one of his speakers at the beginning of the war say, &#x27;Why do people go to war? Out of fear, honor, and interest.&#x27; Well, everybody knows interest, and fear is very credible. Nobody takes honor seriously.&quot; Kagan believes honor – better understood as &quot;prestige&quot; – was crucial in beginning World War I, for example.

The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) awarded Kagan the National Humanities Medal in 2002, and selected him to deliver the 2005 Jefferson Lecture. Kagan titled his lecture &quot;In Defense of History&quot;; he argued that history is of primary importance in the study of the humanities. In his &quot;The New Yorker&quot; review, George Steiner said of Kagan&#x27;s four-volume history of the Peloponnesian War: &quot;The temptation to acclaim Kagan&#x27;s four volumes as the foremost work of history produced in North America in this century is vivid.&quot;

Until his retirement in 2013, Kagan was Sterling Professor of Classics and History at Yale University. His &quot;The Origins of War&quot; was one of Yale&#x27;s most popular courses for twenty-five years, and was the basis of a book he published in 1995. Over an even longer timespan he taught &quot;Introduction to Ancient Greek History&quot;, and upper level History and Classical Civilization seminars focusing on topics from Thucydides to the Lacedaimonian hegemony.

==Personal life and family==
Kagan married Myrna Dabrusky in 1954. They met while studying at Thomas Jefferson High School together, and remained married for 62 years until her death in 2017. Together, they had two children: Robert and Frederick.

Kagan died on August 6, 2021, at a retirement home in Washington, D.C. He was 89 years old.

<doc id="886442" wikidata="Q1438686" url="?curid=886442" title="Battle of Plymouth">
<text>The Battle of Plymouth was a naval battle in the First Anglo-Dutch War. It took place on 16 August 1652 (26 August 1652 (Gregorian calendar) and was a short battle, but had the unexpected outcome of a Dutch victory over England. General-at-Sea George Ayscue of the Commonwealth of England attacked an outward bound convoy of the Dutch Republic commanded by Vice-Commodore Michiel de Ruyter. The two commanders had been personal friends before the war.
The Dutch were able to force Ayscue to break off the engagement, and the Dutch convoy sailed safely to the Atlantic while Ayscue sailed to Plymouth for repairs.

==Background==
On 19 July De Ruyter was appointed Vice-Commodore, an originally Dutch creation between Captain and Rear-Admiral, with the confederate Dutch fleet and shortly after took over command, in the absence of Vice-Admiral Witte de With, of a squadron assembling in the Wielingen, off the coast of Zealand, to escort a large convoy. Around 10 August, De Ruyter took sea before the merchantmen had arrived, to seek out an English fleet of forty ships, commanded by Ayscue, which he knew had left The Downs on 19 July. De Ruyter&#x27;s squadron at that moment consisted of 23 warships and six fireships, with a total of about 600 cannon and 1,700 men. As De Ruyter reported to the States-General of the Netherlands, most crews were badly trained, many ships poorly maintained and he had just two months of supplies. Nevertheless, he preferred to give battle early without the burden of having to protect the convoy.

Reaching the English Channel, he soon discovered that Ayscue was not interested in fighting the Dutch squadron, but avoided it in the hope of intercepting the convoy. To lure Ayscue out De Ruyter started to cruise off the coast of Sussex, causing an uproar with the local population, but Ayscue, despite his fleet having grown to 42 ships, did not react. Meanwhile, De Ruyter had lost two ships, sent out to escort a single incoming merchantman to the mouth of the Somme river, when they collided, sinking one, the &quot;Sint Nicolaes&quot;, and severely damaging the other, &quot;Gelderlandt&quot;.

On 11 August De Ruyter at last did rendezvous with the convoy of sixty merchantmen off Gravelines in the southern North Sea. He was pleased to notice that it brought ten warships with it, bringing his total to 31. On 13 August De Ruyter re-entered the Channel near Calais. His instructions were to escort the convoy to the Atlantic. There most ships would head for the Mediterranean together with their ten escorts, while the original squadron would have to wait to pick up merchantmen coming from the West Indies and transporting silver. Ayscue&#x27;s fleet had then grown to 47 vessels: 38 men-of-war, among which armed merchantmen; five fireships, and four smaller vessels.

==Battle==
On 15 August, the English spotted the Dutch fleet off the coast of Plymouth and took sea. Ayscue attempted a direct attack from the north the next day, off the coast of Brittany around 13:30, against the convoy, having the weather gauge. He hoped it would scatter, allowing him to capture some very profitable prizes, but De Ruyter unexpectedly separated his naval squadron and changed course to meet Ayscue&#x27;s attack, shielding the merchantmen. Ayscue&#x27;s ships were on average more heavily armed, but extremely disorganised because the fastest vessels, among them Ayscue&#x27;s flagship the &quot;George&quot; and the &quot;Vanguard&quot; of his vice-admiral William Haddock, had broken formation in the hope of catching, during a running battle, straggling Dutch merchantmen. They were now unable to form a line of battle and fully exploit their advantage in firepower over the Dutch. The Dutch squadron however, sailing to the northwest, was in a rough defensive leeward line formation, with the Frisian acting Rear-Admiral Joris Pieterszoon van den Broeck commanding the van, De Ruyter himself commanding the centre and Dutch Rear-Admiral Jan Aertsen Verhoeff commanding the rear. Around 16:00 the Dutch fleet and seven forward English vessels met and almost immediately passed through each other, both sides afterwards claiming to have &quot;broken the enemy line&quot;. Having thus gained the weather gauge the Dutch at once exploited this by turning and attacking from the north. They would describe this as a second breaking of the line but probably the battle soon degenerated into a confusing mêlée. With their best ships now surrounded by the mass of Dutch vessels and bearing the brunt of the fight, the slower remainder of the English fleet, largely consisting of poorly trained hired merchantmen, was, reaching the scene of the battle, not overly zealous to get involved. Their numerical superiority thus also gained the English little.

The largest Dutch vessel, the Dutch East India Company warship &quot;Vogelstruys&quot;, by Dutch standards heavily armed with a lower tier of 18-pounders, got separated from the rest of the Dutch fleet and was attacked by three English ships at once and boarded. Her crew was close to surrendering when her captain, the Frisian Douwe Aukes, threatened to blow her up first. Faced with this alternative the crew rallied, drove off the English boarding team and put up such a fight that the English vessels, much damaged and two even in a sinking condition, broke off the attack. The Dutch employed their tactic of disabling enemy vessels by firing at their masts and rigging with chain shot. At the end of the afternoon Ayscue, feeling rather unsupported, decided to break off the unsuccessful engagement and to retreat to Plymouth to repair his ships before any became so damaged they would be captured. The &quot;Bonaventure&quot; could only disengage after an English fireship, the &quot;Charity&quot; commanded by Captain Simon Orton, set itself alight and frightened off the attacking Dutch vessels. De Ruyter in his journal concluded:

Neither side lost a warship, but both sides suffered heavy casualties among their crews. The Dutch had about sixty dead and fifty wounded. The reports on the English losses differ: one set the number as high as seven hundred casualties including the wounded (most from the failed attack on the &quot;Vogelstruys&quot;), another mentioned 91 dead, among them Ayscue&#x27;s flag captain Thomas de Lisle. Rear-Admiral Michael Pack had a leg amputated and shortly afterwards died of the complications. The English spent one fireship.

De Ruyter pursued the English fleet after its retreat. On the morning of the next day both forces transpired to be still close to each other and he hoped by aggressively pursuing to capture some stragglers. Several English ships were in tow and might well be abandoned if he pressed hard enough. However, Ayscue, fearing for his reputation, on 17 August convinced the English council of war to again give battle if necessary and brought his entire force safely back to Plymouth on 18 August. De Ruyter then sent two warships to escort the merchant fleet through the Channel to the Atlantic. For a while he considered trying to attack the enemy fleet at anchorage in Plymouth Sound, but in the end decided against it as he did not have the weather gauge. Then hearing that General-at-Sea Robert Blake was sailing to the west with a superior force of 72, he chose to withdraw to the west and kept assembling incoming West Indies ships throughout September. On 15 September Blake had reached Portland and sent out a squadron of eighteen sail commanded by William Penn to intercept De Ruyter, but the latter escaped east along the French coast while Blake had been forced by a storm to seek shelter in Torbay. De Ruyter escorted twelve merchantmen safely to Calais on 22 September (2 October Gregorian calendar) when his supplies had nearly run out. Shortly afterwards nine or ten of the Dutch ships, among them De Ruyter&#x27;s flagship the &quot;Kleine Neptunis&quot;, then had to return to port for repairs, probably because of insufficiently repaired damage from the battle.

==Loss of prestige for the English and the beginning of fame for De Ruyter==

The English ships had expected to easily defeat the Dutch in a set battle because of their superiority in armament and numbers. While the failure came as an unpleasant surprise to the English, the Dutch populace rejoiced in the tactical draw, hailing De Ruyter, who had not been well known among the larger public, as a naval hero. The English accused some merchantmen captains of cowardice. Ayscue was blamed for poor leadership and organisation: his attempt to present the encounter as a victory failed to convince. He lost command after this battle, though probably for political reasons: he had known royalist sympathies. Less important was his emphasis on capturing prizes while avoiding battle. In the first year of the war this was a very common attitude, the English mainly seeing the conflict as one large privateering campaign, allowing them to gain riches at the expense of the Dutch; only with the Battle of the Gabbard would they really try to establish naval dominion.

This victory was very important to the naval career of De Ruyter: it was the first time he commanded an independent force as a fleet commander. Before, he only had had subcommand of a flotilla aiding Portugal in 1641. As a result of the battle he acquired the nickname &quot;The Sea Lion&quot;. Before he could return home, De Ruyter was first involved in the Battle of the Kentish Knock but arriving in Middelburg he was received by the States of Zealand and rewarded with a golden honorary chain of a hundred Flemish pounds for both battles because he in the first had shown &quot;masculine courage&quot; and in the second &quot;courageous prudence&quot; – having convinced Witte de With to a timely retreat.

<text>Admiral Sir George Ayscue (c. 1616 – 5 April 1672) was an English naval officer who served in the English Civil War and the Anglo-Dutch Wars who rose to the rank of Admiral of the White. He also served as Governor of Scilly Isles (1647) and Governor of Barbados (1650–1652).

==Biography==
Ayscue (sometimes spelled Askew or Ayscough) came from an old Lincolnshire family, and was knighted by Charles I on 9 August 1641. In 1646 he received a naval command, In August 1647 he was appointed Governor of Scilly Isles a post he held until January 1647. 

In July 1648, during the Civil War, while serving as a captain in the navy of the English Parliament, he was recognized as restoring sailors&#x27; allegiances at sea and later in the year given command of two vessels and promoted to Rear Admiral. 

In 1649, he was appointed Admiral of the Irish Seas. In 1650 Ayscue was appointed Governor of Barbados and Commander of the squadron sent to the island. In 1651, he served with General at Sea Robert Blake in the capture of the Scilly Isles from Sir John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath. Later that year he captured Barbados from Lord Willoughby and the other English colonies in the Americas. 

In the First Anglo-Dutch War he was defeated by the Dutch Commodore Michiel de Ruyter at the Battle of Plymouth. Relieved of his command, he went into service in the Swedish Navy, returning after the Restoration of Charles II. In 1664 he was appointed Rear-Admiral of the Blue Squadron. In June 1665, he was appointed Vice-Admiral of the Blue. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War he commanded a squadron at the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665.

In February 1666, he was appointed Admiral of the Blue and at the start of the Four Days&#x27; Battle in June 1666 he was elevated to the rank of Admiral of the White, his flagship, , ran aground on the Galloper Shoal and he was forced to surrender his ship to Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Tromp, earning the unfortunate distinction of being the highest-ranking English naval officer to have been captured by the enemy. He was held prisoner during the war in the Dutch Loevestein Castle prison, and almost certainly never again took to sea as admiral.

In December 1671, he was the President of the Court Martial of Rear-Admiral Sir William Jennings, held on board . Sir George Ayscue was still a serving officer when he died at his Westminster house on 5 April 1672. His burial was held on 13 April 1672 at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster, London, England.

<doc id="886453" wikidata="Q235841" url="?curid=886453" title="Renée of France">
<text>Renée of France (25 October 1510 – 12 June 1574), was Duchess of Ferrara from 31 October 1534 until 3 October 1559 by marriage to Ercole II d&#x27;Este, grandson of Pope Alexander VI. She was the younger surviving child of Louis XII of France and the duchess regnant Anne of Brittany. In her later life, she became an important supporter of the Protestant Reformation and ally of John Calvin.

==Background==

Renée was born on 25 October 1510 at the Château de Blois, Blois, Touraine and was the second daughter of Louis XII of France and Anne of Brittany. Anne, who had always fought fiercely to keep Brittany independent of the French crown, tried to will the duchy to Renée, but Louis prevented this, passing the duchy to her elder sister, Claude.

Renee&#x27;s early education was undertaken by her governess, Michelle de Saubonne, Madame de Soubise. Saubonne was a partisan of Anne of Brittany and opposed to Anne&#x27;s enemy, Louise of Savoy, so after the death of Renée&#x27;s parents, Louise and her son, Francis I of France, had Saubonne sacked. Renée never forgot this, and when she married, she took Saubonne with her.
In return for renouncing her claims to the Duchy of Brittany, Renée was granted the Duchy of Chartres by Francis. She was considered as a possible bride for King Henry VIII.

== Duchess of Ferrara ==
Renée was married in April 1528 to Ercole II, Duke of Ferrara, eldest son of Alfonso I d&#x27;Este and Lucrezia Borgia. By this marriage, she became known as &quot;Renata di Francia&quot;. Renée received from Francis I an ample dowry and annuity. Thus the court that she assembled about her in Ferrara, in the 1530s and 1540s, corresponded to the tradition which the cultivation of science and art implicitly required, including scholars like Bernardo Tasso and Fulvio Pellegrino Morato. Poets Clément Marot and Vittoria Colonna, and reformers Bernardino Ochino and John Calvin, were also present at her court. 

On 31 October 1534, her father-in-law died and Ercole succeeded to the throne. Hardly had he rendered his oath of allegiance to Pope Paul III when he turned against the French at his own court, many of whom had been brought by Renee. Both their number and influence displeased him; and, besides, he found them too expensive; so he by direct or indirect means secured their dismissal, including the poet Clément Marot. And while the Curia was urging the duke to put away the French that were suspected of heresy against Catholicism, there came to Ferrara the Protestant theologian John Calvin, whose journey to Italy must have fallen in March and April 1536. Calvin passed several weeks at the court of Renée in the summer of 1536. As a result of Renée&#x27;s patronage, Calvin&#x27;s &quot;opus magnum&quot; circulated at the court: the &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot;, in two Latin editions (1536, 1539). This was at a time when the persecution of Protestants had already begun in the area. Among those arrested and tried by the Inquisition were Jehannet, a chorister, Cornillan, an attendant of the duchess, and Bouchefort, a priest from Tournay. The Inquisition also arrested a &quot;man of small stature&quot; who escaped, but this was the poet Marot, not Calvin.

=== Heresy trial ===
Renée was in correspondence with a very large number of Protestants abroad, and with intellectual sympathizers like Vergerio, Camillo Renato, , and Francis Dryander. On two or three occasions, about 1550 or later, she partook of the Eucharist in the Protestant manner together with her daughters and fellow believers. Meanwhile, notwithstanding its external splendor, her life had grown sad. The last of her French guests, the daughter and son-in-law of Madame de Soubise of Pons, were sent away in 1543 by the duke. The Counter-Reformation, which had been operative in Rome since 1542, led to the introduction of a special court of the Inquisition at Ferrara, in 1545. In 1550 and 1551, this court imposed death sentences on Protestant sympathizers ( of Faenza and ), who were executed by the secular arm.

Finally, Duke Ercole lodged an accusation against Renée before her nephew King Henry II of France. Through the Inquisitor Ortiz, whom the king charged with this errand, Renée was arrested as a heretic, and declared forfeit of all possessions unless she recanted. She resisted steadfastly for some time, until her two daughters were taken away from her, supposedly forever. As a condition for being reunited with her children, she yielded and made confession on 23 September 1554. Subsequently, however, she refused to attend mass, which for her was a form of blasphemy.

=== Return to France ===

Renée&#x27;s longing to return home was not satisfied until a year after the death of her husband on 3 October 1559. In France she found her eldest daughter&#x27;s husband Francis, Duke of Guise, at the head of the Catholic party. His power was broken by the death of his nephew Francis II in December 1560, so that Renée was able to provide Protestant worship at her estate Montargis, engaging a capable preacher by application to Calvin. She acted as a benefactress for the surrounding Protestants, making her castle a refuge for them when the first phase French Wars of Religion began in 1562.

Again, her conduct won Calvin&#x27;s praise (10 May 1563), and she is one of the frequently recurring figures in his correspondence of that period. He repeatedly shows recognition of her intervention in behalf of the Evangelical cause; and one of his last writings in the French tongue, dispatched from his deathbed (4 April 1564), is addressed to her.

While Renée continued unmolested in the second phase of the wars (1567), in the third phase (1568–70) her castle was no longer respected as an asylum for Protestants. On the other hand, she succeeded in rescuing a number of them from the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, when she happened to be in Paris. The Catholic forces left her personally undisturbed at that time, though Catherine de&#x27; Medici still sought to move her to retract, a demand which she ignored.

==Children==

With Ercole II she had:
*Anna d&#x27;Este, 16 November 1531 – 1607, married firstly, Francis, Duke of Guise until 1563, married secondly Jacques de Savoie, 2nd Duc de Nemours
*Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara, 22 November 1533 – 1597
*Lucrezia Maria d&#x27;Este, 16 December 1535 – 1598, married Francesco Maria II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino.
*Eleonore d&#x27;Este, 1537–1581
*Luigi d&#x27;Este, 21 December 1538 – 1586, Bishop of Ferrara and Archbishop of Auch

Renee was widowed in 1559. As a result of being on bad terms with her son, Alfonso, she returned to France in 1560 and settled in Montargis, where she then died on 12 June 1575.

<doc id="886464" wikidata="Q698170" url="?curid=886464" title="Operation Winter Storm">
<text>Operation Winter Storm (), a German offensive in December 1942 during World War II, involved the German 4th Panzer Army failing to break the Soviet encirclement of the German 6th Army during the Battle of Stalingrad.

In late November 1942 the Red Army had completed Operation Uranus, encircling some 300,000 Axis personnel in and around the city of Stalingrad. German forces within the Stalingrad pocket and directly outside were reorganized (22 November 1942) into Army Group Don and placed under the command of Field Marshal Erich von Manstein. The Red Army continued to allocate as many resources as possible to the planned Operation Saturn to isolate Army Group A from the rest of the German Army. To remedy the situation, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; attempted to supply German forces in Stalingrad through an air bridge. When the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; failed and it became obvious that a breakout could succeed only if launched as early as possible, Manstein decided on a relief effort.

Originally, Manstein was promised four &quot;panzer&quot; divisions. Due to German reluctance to weaken certain sectors by redeploying German units, the task of opening a corridor to the encircled German 6th Army fell to the depleted 4th Panzer Army, under the command of Hermann Hoth. The German force was pitted against several Soviet armies tasked with the destruction of the encircled German forces and their offensive around the lower Chir River.

The German offensive caught the Red Army by surprise and made large gains on the first day. The spearhead forces enjoyed air support and defeated counterattacks by Soviet troops. By 13 December, Soviet resistance had slowed the German advance considerably. Although German forces took the area surrounding the town of and crossed the river Myshkova. However, on 16 December the Red Army launched Operation Little Saturn and crushed the Italian 8th Army on Army Group Don&#x27;s left flank, threatening the rear of Manstein&#x27;s force. Faced with mounting casualties and stiff Soviet opposition, the 4th Panzer Army continued its attempt to open a corridor to the 6th Army on 18–19 December, but was unsuccessful. 

Manstein called off the assault on 23 December and by Christmas Eve the 4th Panzer Army began to withdraw to its starting position. Due to the failure of the 6th Army to break out from the Soviet encirclement, the Red Army could continue the &quot;strangulation&quot; of German forces in Stalingrad.

==Background==
On 23 November 1942, the Red Army closed its encirclement of Axis forces in Stalingrad. Nearly 300,000 German and Romanian soldiers were trapped in the city and vicinity of Stalingrad by roughly 1.1 million Soviet personnel. Adolf Hitler appointed Field Marshal Erich von Manstein as commander of a new Army Group Don. Composed of the German 4th Panzer and 6th Armies, as well as the Third and Fourth Romanian Armies, Manstein&#x27;s new army group was between German Army Groups A and B. Instead of attempting an immediate breakout, German high command decided that the trapped forces would remain in Stalingrad and hold out. The encircled German forces were to be supplied by air, requiring roughly of supplies per day. The fleet of 500 &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; transport aircraft was insufficient for the task. Many of the aircraft were hardly serviceable in the rough Soviet winter; in early December, more German cargo planes were destroyed in accidents than by Soviet fighter aircraft. The 6th Army received less than 20 percent of its daily needs. Furthermore, the Germans were still threatened by Soviet forces which still held portions of the Volga River&#x27;s west bank in Stalingrad.
Given the unexpected size of German forces closed off in Stalingrad, on 23 November &quot;Stavka&quot; (Soviet Armed Forces High Command) decided to strengthen the outer encirclement preparing to destroy the trapped Axis forces. On 24 November, several Soviet formations began to dig in against possible German incursions from the west. The Soviets also reinforced the encircling forces in order to prevent a breakout by the 6th Army and other Axis units. This tied down over ½ of the Red Army&#x27;s strength in the area. Planning for Operation Saturn began on 25 November to destroy the Italian 8th Army and cut communications between German forces west of the Don River and those operating in the Caucasus. Planning also began for Operation Koltso (Ring), which aimed at reducing German forces in the Stalingrad pocket.

As Operation Uranus concluded, German forces inside the encirclement were too weak to attempt a breakout on their own. Half of their remaining armor had been lost during the defensive fighting and there was a severe lack of fuel and ammunition for the surviving vehicles, given that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was not able to provide adequate aerial supply. Manstein proposed a counterstrike to break the Soviet encirclement of Stalingrad, codenamed Operation Winter Storm (). On 28 November, Manstein sent Hitler a detailed report on Army Group Don&#x27;s situation, including the strength of the 6th Army and an assessment of the ammunition for German artillery inside the city. 

&quot;Stavka&quot; postponed Operation Saturn until 16 December, as Soviet forces struggled to clear German defenders from the lower Chir River. The Red Army&#x27;s offensive in the area commenced on 30 November, involving around 50,000 soldiers, which forced Manstein to use the 48th Panzer Corps to hold the area. The 5th Tank Army was reinforced by the new 5th Shock Army, drawn from existing formations of the South-Western and Stalingrad Fronts; the 5th Tank Army totaled nearly 71,000 men, 252 tanks and 814 guns. The Soviet offensive succeeded in tying down the 48th Panzer Corps, originally chosen to lead one of the main attacks on the Soviet encirclement. The Soviets were forewarned of the impending German assault when they discovered the 6th Panzer Division unloading at the town of Morozovsk and held back several armies from the attack on the lower Chir River to prepare for a possible breakout attempt by German forces inside Stalingrad.

==Comparison of forces==

===German===
The relief operation was originally scheduled to include the LVII Panzer Corps of the 4th Panzer Army, under the command of General Friedrich Kirchner, including the 6th and 23rd Panzer Divisions, and Army Detachment Hollidt, consisting of three infantry divisions and two armored divisions (11th and 22nd Panzer Divisions). In total, it was expected that four Panzer divisions, four infantry divisions and three Luftwaffe Field Divisions were to take part in Operation Winter Storm. They would be tasked with temporarily opening a passage to the 6th Army. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; field divisions—formed of non-combat soldiers, headquarters staffs and unit-less &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and &quot;Heer&quot; personnel—were poorly trained and lacked seasoned officers and enlisted soldiers, as well as sufficient anti-tank and artillery guns. Many of the personnel promised for the relief effort never arrived, partly due to the poor transportation service to the front, while some units originally chosen to be transferred under the command of Army Group Don were retained by their original commands. Other units in Army Group Don were in no shape to conduct offensive operations, due to losses sustained in the past month of combat, while many new formations which had been promised did not arrive on time.

On the other hand, the 11th Panzer Division was one of the most complete German armored divisions on the Eastern Front since it had just been transferred out of the German Army&#x27;s reserve. The 6th Panzer Division was also complete because it had been transferred to Manstein&#x27;s control from Western Europe. However, the usefulness of the 11th Panzer Division was compromised when the Soviets launched their offensive against forces in the lower Chir River area, as this tied Army Detachment Hollidt down on the defensive. Because of this, and because Manstein believed that a thrust originating from the position of Army Detachment Hollidt would be too obvious, the German field marshal decided to use the 4th Panzer Army and the LVII Panzer Corps as the main components of the relief operation. However, despite attempts by the Germans to build strength for the offensive, their position along the lower Chir River became tenuous; the Soviet breakthrough was only blunted by the arrival of the 11th Panzer Division, which was able to destroy the bulk of two Soviet tank brigades. Consequently, the XLVIII Panzer Corps became embroiled in the defensive battles for the Chir River, as the Soviets pushed in an attempt to overrun the airfield at Tatsinskaya (being used to resupply German forces in Stalingrad by air).

Although the LVII Panzer Corps was reluctantly released to Army Group Don, by Army Group A, the 17th Panzer Division was ordered back to its original area of concentration, and did not prepare to go back to Army Group Don until 10 days after it had been asked for. In light of the troubles in building up sufficient forces, and seeing that the Soviets were concentrating more mechanization on the Chir River, Manstein decided to launch Operation Winter Storm using the 4th Panzer Army. Manstein hoped that the 6th Army would launch an offensive of its own, from the opposite side, upon the receipt of the code signal Thunderclap. Manstein was gambling on Hitler accepting that the only plausible method to avoid the demise of the 6th Army was allowing it to break out, and assumed that General Paulus would agree to order his forces to escape the Stalingrad pocket. On 10 December, Manstein communicated to Paulus that the relief operation would commence in 24 hours.

===Soviet===
For the purpose of Operation Uranus, Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov deployed eleven Soviet armies. In an effort to bolster the offensive capabilities of the Stalingrad Front, over 420 tanks, 111,000 soldiers and 556 artillery guns were shipped over the Volga River in a period of three weeks. The Red Army and Red Air Force were able to amass over one million soldiers, 13,500 artillery guns, 890 tanks and 1,100 combat aircraft, organized into 66 rifle divisions, five tank corps, 14 tank brigades, a single mechanized brigade, a cavalry corps, and 127 artillery and mortar regiments. As the encirclement closed and the Soviets continued with secondary operations, the 51st Army was positioned on the edge of the outer encirclement with 34,000 men and 77 tanks. South of them was the 28th Army, with 44,000 soldiers, 40 tanks and 707 artillery guns and mortars. Concurrently, the Red Army began building its strength for Operation Saturn, in which it would aim to isolate and destroy German Army Group A in the Caucasus.

==German offensive==

On 12 December 1942, the LVII Panzer Corps of the Fourth Panzer Army began its north-eastward drive toward German forces trapped in the Stalingrad pocket. The 6th and 23rd Panzer Divisions made large gains, surprising the Red Army and threatening the rear of the 51st Army. The German drive was due to be spearheaded by the 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion of Tiger I tanks but the unit did not embark on its transport to the Eastern Front until 21 December 1942 and did not see battle until early January 1943, along the Manytsch River. At first, Winterstorm made rapid progress. Some units were able to travel up to on the first day. The Germans were aided by surprise, as &quot;Stavka&quot; had not expected the German offensive to begin so soon, while General Aleksandr Vasilevsky was unable to detach the 2nd Guards Army and use it as a blocking force against Manstein&#x27;s spearheads.

The 6th Panzer Division was able to capture Soviet artillery intact. Soviet resistance decreased noticeably after the 6th and 23rd Panzer Divisions had overrun the main body of Russian infantry. The 302nd Rifle Division of the 51st Army was overrun by the end of 12 December. Although Soviet infantry quickly reinforced villages in the path of the German drive, the Red Army&#x27;s cavalry in the area was exhausted from weeks of combat and was incapable of putting up serious resistance. Despite early gains, the LVII Panzer Corps was unable to achieve decisive results. There were also reports of severe pressure building against the 23rd Panzer Division, despite headway made on the first day of the German offensive.

On 13 December, the 6th Panzer Division made contact with the Soviet 5th Tank Army, which was reducing the German defenses around the Chir River. German forces were able to engage and defeat Soviet armor as the former forced the crossing of the Aksay River. A big armored battle began around the village of Verkhne-Kumskiy. The village was on the most convenient south–north road to Stalingrad, whereas the barren steppe around was riddled with ravines and gullies covered with deep snow, Verkhne-Kumskiy was unavoidable for large armored forces to move north towards the Myshkova River. On the Soviet side, Volsky&#x27;s 4th Mechanized Corps was also driving at full speed towards the village. The corps had not yet had time to replenish personnel and material after the November offensive battles; it barely fielded 100 operable tanks and another 50 were in need of repair. Half of these were T-34 capable of opposing Panzer Mk IIIs and IVs, while the rest were light T-70s, only useful against infantry or armored cars. The road towards the encircled 6th Army was almost free and if the 4th Mechanized Corps had not intervened, Hoth would have had a greater chance to reach Paulus.

Although they suffered many losses, the Soviet forces were able to push German forces back to the banks of the Aksay River by the end of the day, while failing to retake the town. The losses sustained by the Red Army in the vicinity of Verkhne-Kumskiy allowed the 6th Panzer Division to enjoy a brief superiority in tank numbers. Fighting for Verkhne-Kumskiy continued for three days as the Red Army counterattacked the German bridgeheads across the Aksay River and German defenders in the town. The Germans were able to pin Soviet tanks in Verkhne-Kumskiy and destroy them using well emplaced anti-tank guns. With support from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, the Germans were able to achieve a local success and began to push toward the Myshkova river. The 6th Panzer Division suffered heavy losses during its drive and took a brief respite after the battle to recondition. Minor damage to surviving tanks was repaired and the majority of the tanks incapacitated during the fighting at Verkhne-Kumskiy were repaired.

===Soviet response: 13–18 December===

The Fourth Panzer Army forced &quot;Stavka&quot; to recalculate its intentions for Operation Saturn and on 13 December Stalin and &quot;Stavka&quot; authorized the transfer of the 2nd Guards Army from the Don Front to the Stalingrad Front, where it would be ready on 15 December. This army had a strength of roughly 90,000 soldiers, organized into three Guards Rifle Corps (the 1st, 13th and 2nd). Operation Saturn was reduced to Operation Little Saturn, the breaking through of the Italian 8th Army and then engaging Army Group Don in the rear. The offensive was also changed from a southward to a southeastern direction and the start date was pushed back to 16 December. The 4th Mechanized and 13th Tank Corps continued to counterattack against German forces in the vicinity of the Aksay River, trying to delay their advance in anticipation of the arrival of the 2nd Guards Army.

The Soviet 1st and 3rd Guard Armies, in conjunction with the Soviet 6th Army, launched Operation Little Saturn on 16 December. Despite stubborn resistance from Italian troops, the Red Army was able to partially overrun the Italian 8th Army by 18 December. The breakthrough—even if small and quickly contained—proved a possible threat to Army Group Don&#x27;s left flank, while the city of Rostov-on-Don was threatened by the 3rd Guards Army. This and the losses sustained by the German armored divisions forcing their way to the Myshkova river, forced Manstein to reconsider the offensive. Manstein decided that he could not defend his left flank and continue the attempt to relieve the 6th Army. Although the 6th Panzer Division was able to cross the Myshkova River by the night of 19 December, the LVII Panzer Corps had still not made major advances against increased Soviet opposition, despite the arrival of the 17th Panzer Division; it seemed as if the corps would have to go on the defensive. The Soviet Tatsinskaya Raid managed to destroy the airfield and several dozen aircraft being used by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to supply forces inside the Stalingrad pocket, forcing Manstein to order the XLVIII Panzer Corps on the defensive, instead of reserving it to bolster his forces directed toward the breakthrough to Stalingrad.

===Collapse: 19–23 December===
By 19 December, the LVII Panzer Corps managed to break through the Aksay River and drive within of the southern edge of the 6th Army&#x27;s front. Colonel Wilhelm Adam makes the point that the 6th Army tanks only had fuel for 30 km, after which they would need fuel and ammunition flown in to go any further. The 6th Army did not have the strength to attempt a breakout, with less than 70 serviceable tanks and dwindling supplies, while its infantry were in no condition to attempt an attack in the blizzard which had developed over the past few days. Manstein ordered the 6th Panzer Division to end its offensive and redeploy to the southern Chir River, to bolster the defenses there against the Soviet offensive, on 23 December. By 24 December, the Fourth Panzer Army was in full retreat, returning to its starting position. The failure to break through to the 6th Army and its refusal to attempt a breakout, caused Operation Winter Storm to collapse on 24 December, as Army Group Don returned to the defensive.

==Aftermath==
With the German relief effort defeated, &quot;Stavka&quot; was free to concentrate on the destruction of Axis forces in the Stalingrad pocket and the westward expansion of the Red Army&#x27;s Winter offensive. The Red Army was able to bring to bear almost 150,000 personnel and 820 tanks against the retreating 4th Panzer Army and although Volsky&#x27;s 4th Mechanized Corps (renamed 3rd Guard Mechanized Corps on 18 December 1942) was withdrawn to be refitted, the 51st Army, the 1st Guards Rifle and 7th Tank Corps struck at German units withdrawing between the Mushkova and Aksai Rivers. In three days, the attacking Soviet units broke through the Romanian positions guarding the LVII Panzer Corps″ flank and threatened the 4th Panzer Army from the south, forcing the Germans to continue withdrawing to the southwest. All the while, the XLVIII Panzer Corps—led mainly by the 11th Panzer Division—strove to maintain its position along the Chir River. Despite success, the XLVIII Panzer Corps was rushed to the defense of Rostov as a Soviet breakthrough seemed imminent after the partial collapse of the Italian 8th Army. As the Red Army pursued the 4th Panzer Army toward the Aksai River and broke through the German defense on the banks of the Chir River, it also began to prepare for Operation Ring—the reduction of the forces in Stalingrad.

German forces in Stalingrad soon began to run out of supplies, with horse meat used to supplement diets. By the end of 1942, the distance between the German 6th Army and forces outside of the encirclement was over , and most of the German formations in the area were extremely weak. Hitler&#x27;s insistence in holding Stalingrad to the last risked the existence of the 6th Army. The end of the German offensive also allowed the Red Army to continue in its efforts to cut off German forces in the Caucasus, which would begin in the middle of January. On the other hand, the encirclement of the 6th Army and the operations to destroy it tied down a considerable number of Soviet troops, which affected Soviet operations on other sectors.

<doc id="886467" wikidata="Q6843062" url="?curid=886467" title="Midtown, Houston">
<text>Midtown is a central neighborhood of Houston, located west-southwest of Downtown. Separated from Downtown by an elevated section of Interstate 45 (the Pierce Elevated), Midtown is characterized by a continuation of Downtown&#x27;s square grid street plan, anchored by Main Street and the METRORail Red Line. Midtown is bordered by Neartown (Montrose) to the west, the Museum District to the south, and Interstate 69 to the east. Midtown&#x27;s 325 blocks cover and contained an estimated population of nearly 8,600 in 2015.

Originally populated as a Victorian-style residential neighborhood in the 19th century, Midtown experienced an economic depression during the latter half of the 20th century, resulting in the departure of residents and businesses and a proliferation of vacant land. The formation of the Midtown Redevelopment Authority in the early 1990s and a renewed interest in Houston&#x27;s urban core resulted in the gentrification of the district throughout the 2000s, fueled by an influx of young residents and the development of a vibrant nightlife. Like many other gentrified areas of Houston, Midtown&#x27;s street signs are themed, specific to the area&#x27;s logo, and there are many parks, sculptures, and businesses that include “Midtown” in their name, as a form of economic unity and to further attract more visitors and residents. Midtown has continued its rapid development through the 2010s, but the district continues to face issues of crime, inadequate infrastructure, chronic homelessness, and geographic disparities in public investment.

==History==

Around 1906 what is now Midtown was divided between the Third Ward and Fourth Ward. Before the 1950s what is now Midtown was a popular residential district. Increasingly, commercial development led homeowners to leave for neighborhoods they considered less busy. The area became a group of small apartment complexes, low-rise commercial buildings, and older houses. According to a City of Houston report, the remaining churches and the Houston Community College System Central campuses provided the neighborhood&#x27;s &quot;only stability.&quot;

In the 1970s, Midtown became home to Little Saigon, a neighborhood of Vietnamese and Vietnamese Americans, who pioneered the redevelopment of Midtown Houston. During the 1980s, Travis and Milam Streets were viewed as a mirror image of 1970s era Saigon. The Vietnamese areas were established around Milam Street, Webster Street, Fannin Street, and San Jacinto Street. By 1991 this Little Saigon had Vietnamese restaurants, hair salons, car shops, and travel agencies. Mimi Swartz of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; stated in 1991 that &quot;Little Saigon is a place to begin easing into a new country&quot;.

On June 24, 1994 Isabella Court at 3909-3917 South Main Street received listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

The City of Houston established the Midtown Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ) in 1995. The establishment of the TIRZ led to the opening of upper income townhomes and apartment complexes in western Midtown and the area along Elizabeth Baldwin Park. Between 1990 and 2000 the area within the Midtown Superneighborhood saw the population increase from 3,070 to 5,311. The increase by 2,241 people was 73% of the 1990 population. During that period about 2,200 multi-family units opened, particularly along Louisiana Street and West Gray Street. Since the total multi-family acreage remained at a small number, the population increase also increased the density of the area. During the 1990s commercial uses increased, particularly along Main Street and Louisiana Street. In 1999 the 76th Texas Legislature created the Midtown Management District.

By 2004, higher rents and street construction have reduced the number of Vietnamese American businesses, many of which have relocated to the outer Houston Chinatown in the Bellaire Boulevard corridor west of Sharpstown. On May 1 of that year, during the 6th Annual Asian Pacific American Heritage Month Festival, the section of Midtown along Milam Street and Travis Street near Tuam Street received the designation &quot;Little Saigon.&quot;

In 2009 Houston City Council approved the expansion of the Midtown TIRZ by . The new territory includes the Asia House, the Buffalo Soldiers Museum and the Museum of African-American culture.

In 2014 the ranking website Niche stated that Midtown was the favorite neighborhood for millennial people.

==Cityscape==
In 2010 Denny Lee of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Midtown, a &quot;mixed-use&quot; district, was &quot;dotted with&quot; bánh mì restaurants. By 2012 many new bars, retail operations, and restaurants had opened in Midtown. Ed Page, a retail broker, said in 2012 that Midtown has not yet seen any significant new retail; he was referring to big box stores.

As of 2010 five flower shops are located along Fannin in a section of Midtown. One decade before 2010 there were over one dozen flower shops in that area. In 2003 the flower shop owners were mostly Asian. The shops, along four city blocks, were centered on Rosedale Street. The number declined after the establishment of the METRORail Red Line. Nancy Sarnoff of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said in 2010 that the remaining flower shops told her that the establishment of the line helped cause several of their competitors to go out of business.

Midtown has no traditional hotels. As of 2025, Midtown&#x27;s largest accommodation provider is Lodgeur, operating 64 furnished apartments at Mid Main Lofts. The area also has one bed and breakfast and other rental units available.

===Little Saigon===
Midtown was known for a concentration of Vietnamese businesses, termed &quot;Little Saigon&quot;. Vietnamese in Houston, in the 1970s, had settled Allen Parkway Village. Midtown was in proximity and was relatively inexpensive. Midtown became a center of business and religion for ethnic Vietnamese across the Houston area even though very few ethnic Vietnamese actually resided in Midtown.

By 1991 this Little Saigon had Vietnamese restaurants, hair salons, car shops, and travel agencies, and as of 2000 businesses there included grocery stores, medical and legal offices, restaurants, music and video stores, hair styling shops, business service offices, and jewelry stores. Mimi Swartz of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; stated in 1991 that in what is now Midtown, &quot;Little Saigon is a place to begin easing into a new country.&quot; Due to the actions of a group of Vietnamese-American leaders led by My Michael Cao, who served as the President of the Vietnamese Community of Houston and Vicinity (VNCH), a resolution that installed Vietnamese street signs along Milam Street in Midtown was passed. Vietnamese street signs have denoted the area since 1998. In 2004, this area was officially named &quot;Little Saigon&quot; by the city of Houston.

The redevelopment of Midtown Houston from run-down to upscale increased property values and property taxes, forcing many Vietnamese-American businesses out of the neighborhood into other areas. By 2003 the number of Vietnamese business declined, with many of them moving to the Southwest Houston Little Saigon, despite the beautification projects occurring. Hope Roth stated that pressure from other new developments and increase in costs related to land and space caused a decline in Little Saigon. Roth stated that many of the area restaurants still remain, but increasingly cater more to mainstream American tastes. In 2010 Denny Lee of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;traces&quot; of the Vietnamese community remained.

==Demographics==

As of 2012 Midtown has about 8,600 people. Midtown had a 65% population increase in a ten-year period.

=====History of public schools in Midtown=====

Charlotte Allen Elementary School opened on February 1, 1907. At the time schools were segregated by race, and Allen was reserved for white children. It was later converted into a school for black children. San Jacinto High School, located in Midtown, and Reagan High School, located in the Houston Heights, opened in 1926. Lamar High School opened in 1937. In 1956 Allen Elementary moved to northwest Houston and its former location became J. Will Jones Elementary School. Ryan Middle School opened in 1958 after Yates High School moved to a new location.

In 1962 San Jacinto High School gained a technical program. Gregory-Lincoln Education Center opened in 1966. In 1971 San Jacinto lost its neighborhood program. During the same year, Fannin Elementary School, which was located at 2900 Louisiana Street in what is now Midtown, closed. In 1976 the Contemporary Occupational Training Center, a non-traditional vocational school, opened in what is now Midtown. In 1985 San Jacinto closed for good when its technical program ended. As of 2008 the San Jacinto campus now houses the central campus for Houston Community College. The Contemporary Occupational Training Center closed in 1991.

J. Will Jones Elementary School, located in Midtown, received an unacceptable academic rating from the Texas Education Agency. Under principal Brian Flores, the school&#x27;s test scores increased in a five-year period until 2009. Around 2009 the school provided bus services to several homeless shelters within the school&#x27;s attendance zone. As of 2009, over 1/3rd of Jones&#x27;s students were homeless. About 100 of the around 300 students were homeless, and about 30 came from a Salvation Army shelter. Flores said that this was the highest number of homeless students during his career as a principal at Jones. In 2008 99% of the students were on free or reduced lunch. Every year the school held its &quot;Gift of Giving&quot; ceremony.

Before the start of the 2009–2010 school year Jones was consolidated into Blackshear Elementary School, a campus in the Third Ward. During its final year of enrollment J. Will Jones had more students than Blackshear. Many J. Will Jones parents referred to Blackshear as &quot;that prison school&quot; and said that they will not send their children to Blackshear. Jones was scheduled to house Houston Community College classes after its closure as a school. Supporters of keeping J. Will Jones created a campaign to try to keep J. Will Jones open. The Jones campus became the campus of Houston Academy for International Studies. Blackshear and Gregory-Lincoln elementary took portions of J. Will Jones&#x27;s former territory in Midtown. The portion zoned to Cullen Middle was zoned to Ryan Middle School until 2013. As part of rezoning for the 2014–2015 school year, all areas in Midtown previously under the Blackshear attendance zone were rezoned to Gregory-Lincoln K-8.

==== Private schools ====
 the British International School of Houston in Greater Katy has a school bus service to Midtown.

The Kinkaid School, a private school, was located in the house of Margaret Kinkaid, what is now Midtown, from its founding in 1906 to the time when the school moved to a campus in Montrose. In 1957, the school moved to the city of Piney Point Village, where it resides as of 2008. Saint Agnes Academy, a private school, was located in what is now Midtown from its founding in 1906 to 1963. The school moved to the Sharpstown neighborhood in 1963, where it resides as of 2008.

Holy Rosary Catholic School of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Houston opened and closed in 1963. The establishment of freeways caused suburbanization, and therefore, population loss, to occur in the area. Initially the parish kept the school building in hopes that the school would be re-established, but it was to be demolished in 2003 so a parish hall could be built there. Tom Bass and Gale Storm were alumni.

==Culture, parks and recreation==

Midtown Park is located at the intersection of Bagby and Gray. The Midtown Management District and several businesses provided funding for the park. Elizabeth Baldwin Park, operated by the City of Houston, is located at 1701 Elgin Street. The Park is between Crawford Street and Chenevert Street. The City of Houston acquired Baldwin Park in 1905. The stone fountain is from 1912. The park received upgrades in 1930 and 1931 stemming from a bond. A 2003 Midtown Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone bond sale and Midtown Management District plans led to further improvements. The park received a rededication on November 13, 2006. The park includes a Vietnamese Heritage Plaza which commemorates the Vietnamese settlement in Midtown. Peggy&#x27;s Point Plaza Park, operated by the city, is located at 4240 Main Street.

Rice University housed their technology park, Rice Innovation District within Midtown.

In 2008, David Crossley from the &quot;Houston Tomorrow&quot; group proposed that the City of Houston should build a park in the area bound by Main Street and Travis Street on the north end and Tuam Street and McGowen Street on the south end. Crossley called the proposal &quot;McGowen Green.&quot; John Nova Lomax, a journalist, published an article about the proposed park in the &quot;Houston Press&quot;.

In 2012 the Midtown Redevelopment Authority and Camden Development Inc. announced that a new park would be established in Midtown in a empty lot, for about $7 million.

The Ensemble Theatre, an African-American theater company, has its studio in Midtown. The theater, founded by George Hawkins in 1976, is the largest African-American theater company in the United States.

Syd Kearney of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; stated that the opening of the Farrago World Cuisine Restaurant in 2000 &quot;was one of the signs that once sleepy Midtown was coming to life.&quot; This restaurant closed in July 2013.

A gay nightclub, Rich&#x27;s Houston, was in Midtown. In 2019 the club announced it was going to Montrose, where it was previously.

==Religion==
Trinity Episcopal Church is in Midtown.

Holy Rosary Catholic Church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston is in Midtown. The parish was established in 1913. In 1933 it constructed a parish hall. Pastor Joseph Konkel described that parish hall as the city&#x27;s &quot;only major construction project&quot; due to the effects of the Great Depression on the city&#x27;s economy. Post-1970s suburbanization had resulted in a decline in parish membership. Circa 1994 the church bought , which it used for educational programs, in an office complex. Parish membership increased due to gentrification of Midtown post-1994. By 2004 a expansion was under way. In 2004 about 25% of the congregation was ethnic Vietnamese, and there are two masses per week in the Vietnamese language. Therefore, it is one of five Vietnamese Catholic churches in the Houston area.

The former Temple Beth Israel is in Midtown.

<text>The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), alternatively known as University of Brazil, is a public research university in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is the largest federal university in the country and is one of the Brazilian centers of excellence in teaching and research. 

Brazil&#x27;s first official higher education institution, it has operated continuously since 1792, when the &quot;Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho&quot; (Royal Academy of Artillery, Fortification and Design, precursor to the university&#x27;s current Polytechnic School) was founded, and served as basis for the country&#x27;s college system since its officialization in 1920. Besides its 157 undergraduate and 580 postgraduate courses, the UFRJ is responsible for seven museums, most notably the National Museum of Brazil, nine hospitals, hundreds of laboratories and research facilities and forty-three libraries. Its history and identity are closely tied to the Brazilian ambitions of forging a modern, competitive and just society.

The university is located mainly in Rio de Janeiro, with satellites spreading to ten other cities. Its main campuses are the historical campus of &quot;Praia Vermelha&quot; (Red Beach) and the newer &quot;Cidade Universitária&quot; (University Town), which houses the &quot;Parque Tecnológico do Rio&quot; (Technology Park of Rio) - a science, technology and innovation development cluster. There are also several off-campus units scattered in Rio de Janeiro: the School of Music, the College of Law Studies, the Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences and the Institute of History, in downtown Rio; the National Museum and the Valongo Observatory (not to be confused with the National Observatory); and the high-school unit &quot;Colégio de Aplicação&quot; (Application College) in Lagoa. To the city of Macaé, located in the State&#x27;s northern region, was dedicated a research and learning center focused on environmental issues and oil-related matters, and the city of Duque de Caxias, in partnership with the National Institute of Metrics, Normalization and Industrial Quality (Inmetro), saw the implementation of &quot;Pólo Avançado de Xerém&quot; (Advanced Center of Xerém), aimed at boosting research in the fields of biotechnology and nanotechnology.

The UFRJ is one of the main actors in the formation of the Brazilian intellectual elite, contributing significantly to build not only the history of Rio de Janeiro but also of Brazil. Some of its former students include renowned economists Carlos Lessa and Mário Henrique Simonsen; Minister Marco Aurélio Mello; the architect Oscar Niemeyer; the philosopher and politician Roberto Mangabeira Unger; the educator Anísio Teixeira; the engineer Benjamin Constant; writers Clarice Lispector, Jorge Amado and Vinicius de Moraes; politicians Francisco Pereira Passos, Oswaldo Aranha and Pedro Calmon, besides the great physicians Carlos Chagas, Oswaldo Cruz and Vital Brazil.

==History==
===Creation===
The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro is a direct descendant of Brazil&#x27;s first higher education courses. Created on September 7, 1920 (Brazilian Independence Day) by president Epitácio Pessoa through the Law Decree 14343, the institution was initially named &quot;University of Rio de Janeiro&quot;. Its history, however, is much vaster and parallel to that of the country&#x27;s cultural, economic and social development (many of its courses trace back to the very foundations of Brazilian higher education system).

In its inception, the university was composed by the &quot;Escola Politécnica&quot; (Polytechnic School, founded on December 17, 1792 as Royal Academy of Artillery, Fortification and Design, during the reign of Portuguese Queen Maria I), the &quot;Faculdade Nacional de Medicina&quot; (National College of Medicine, founded on April 2, 1808, by Dom João VI under the name of Academy of Medicine and Surgery) and by the &quot;Faculdade Nacional de Direito&quot; (National College of Law, which came to exist after the fusion between the College of Legal and Social Sciences and the Free College of Law - both recognized by the Law Decree 693 of October 1, 1891).

To these initial units many others were progressively added, such as the &quot;Escola Nacional de Belas Artes&quot; (National School of Fine Arts) and the &quot;Faculdade Nacional de Filosofia&quot; (National College of Philosophy). Thanks to such achievements, the UFRJ toke crucial role in the implantation of Brazilian higher education, which was in fact an aspiration from Brazilian intellectual elite since the country&#x27;s colonial era. Due to the longstanding tradition of its pioneering courses, the university functioned as the &quot;scholar mill&quot; upon which most of Brazil&#x27;s subsequent higher education institutions were molded.

===Restructuring===
In 1937, Getúlio Vargas&#x27;s minister of education, , announced a reform of the education system, under which the institution changed its name to the &quot;University of Brazil&quot;. The change reflected the government&#x27;s aim of controlling the quality of the national higher education system - mainly by setting a standard by which all other universities would have to conform. Such decision was strongly influenced by the French concept of university - that in which component schools are isolated in order to assume a specific professionalizing teaching method under strong state control -, which contrasted to the German model seen, for example, in the University of São Paulo, founded in 1934.

The early 1950s marked the institutionalization of research in the university, which consequentially led to the implementation of research institutes, full-time academic staff, instruction of highly specialized professors and the establishment of partnership with national and international financing agencies.

In 1958, occasion for the 150-year anniversary of the UFRJ&#x27;s Medicine School, the university was faced by the urgent needs of a structural reform that stimulated deeper participation and cooperation among professors and students with college affairs and a more rational, efficiency-based use of public resources. After an ample sequence of debates and public consultations, the resulting plans for reforms in University of Brazil were quickly absorbed by the scientific community, set a new standard for national college planning and influenced even, among others, Brazilian communication industries and government&#x27;s decisional spheres.

In 1965, under the government of general Castelo Branco, the university would achieve plain financial, didactic and academic autonomy - a condition called, according to Brazilian legislature, &quot;autarchy&quot; - and acquire its current name, which followed the still-active standard for federal university naming (i.e.: Federal University of &quot;name of State or region&quot;).

After the reformation process, the university was propelled into a deeper and riskier restructuring phase that aimed to make the institution fit for the recently approved Law Decree of March 13, 1967 - a situation widely regarded as too bold for a nation with recent history as an independent territory and a culture that, inheriting traits from the Portuguese colonial rule, heavily emphasized tradition and stability.

===Present day===
The UFRJ keeps an &quot;open-doors policy&quot; regarding foreigners who arrive at it to disseminate or accumulate expertise; this also allows for internship or job opportunities for its teaching staff in different institutions and areas of research. International interexchange and partnerships are profuse, leading to reformist tendencies that most of times successfully coexist with the university&#x27;s strong traditional ties.

The UFRJ adopts the Roman goddess Minerva - patroness of the Arts and all professions; also associated with knowledge and intellectuality - as its mascot, and many sculptures depicting the goddess are seem scattered throughout the institution. In 2000, the rectory requested to the Federal Justice that the university&#x27;s name was changed back to &quot;University of Brazil&quot;, as the old name has been changed by an arbitrary decree during the country&#x27;s years of military dictatorship. The request was deferred, so it is correct to address the university by either names.

The university manages an ambitious program for extension courses, consisting mostly in providing full-time education to financially debilitated non-students of varying education backgrounds. Besides, the UFRJ contributes heavily to Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s public health with its nine college hospitals, providing for over one thousand vacancies, and its deep integration with the State&#x27;s health treatment network. In 2010, the institution achieved a &quot;very good&quot; evaluation and a maximum score in the Ministry of Education&#x27;s General Index of College Courses (&quot;Índice Geral de Cursos&quot;, or IGC in Portuguese). Its clear emphasis on research alludes to the personal motto of one of its most famous and distinguished scientists:

==Organization==
===Administration===
The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro is an autarchy and a public institution linked to the Ministry of Education (MEC). Its administration is commanded by the &quot;superior councils&quot;: the &quot;Conselho Universitário&quot; (University Council), the highest decisional authority, presided by the &quot;reitor&quot; (rector); the &quot;Conselho de Curadores&quot; (Curators Council), responsible for the financial books and budgetary matters, also under rectorship rule; the &quot;Conselho de Ensino de Graduação&quot; (Undergraduate Council), responsible for admission to undergraduate course and other undergraduate affairs, presided by the pro-rector of graduation; and the &quot;Conselho de Ensino para Graduados&quot; (Graduate Council), responsible for research activities and post-graduation courses, presided by the pro-rector of post-graduation and research.

The institution is also directed by a vice-rector and six other pro-rectors. The rectors are nominated and chosen by the Ministry of Education (MEC) from a three-candidate list formed by a general election every four years. In general, the MEC respects the electoral decision, choosing the most voted candidate. The current rector (2014) is Carlos Antônio Levi da Conceição, with Antônio José Ledo Alves da Cunha as vice-rector.

The academic pro-rectories are as follows: &quot;Pró-reitoria de Graduação&quot; (Pro-Rectory of Undergraduate Studies), &quot;Pró-reitoria de Pós-Graduação e Pesquisa&quot; (Pro-Rectory of Research and Post-Graduate Studies), &quot;Pró-reitoria de Planejamento e Desenvolvimento&quot; (Pro-Rectory of Planning and Development), &quot;Pró-reitoria de Pessoal&quot; (Pro-Rectory of Human Resources), &quot;Pró-reitoria de Extensão&quot; (Pro-Rectory of Extension) e a Pró-reitoria de Gestão e Governança&quot; (Pro-Rectory of Management and Governance).

Serving as executive institutions are a total of eleven superintendencies: &quot;Superintendência Geral de Graduação&quot; (General Superintendency of Undergraduate Studies), &quot;Superintendência Geral de Pós-Graduação e Pesquisa&quot; (General Superintendency of Research and Post-Graduate Studies), &quot;Superintendência Geral de Planejamento e Desenvolvimento&quot; (General Superintendency of Planning and Development), &quot;Superintendência Geral de Finanças&quot; (General Superintendency of Finances), &quot;Superintendência Geral de Pessoal&quot; (General Superintendency of Human Resources), &quot;Superintendência Geral de Extensão&quot; (General Superintendency of Extension), &quot;Superintendência Geral de Gestão e Controle&quot; (General Superintendency of Management and Control), &quot;Superintendência Geral de Governança&quot; (General Superintendency of Governance), &quot;Superintendência Geral de Tecnologia da Informação e Comunicação Gerencial&quot; (General Superintendency of Information Technology and Managerial Communication), &quot;Superintendência Geral de Políticas Estudantis&quot; (General Superintendency of Student Policies) e a &quot;Superintendência Geral de Atividades Fora da Sede&quot; (General Superintendency of Non-Campus Activities).

==Notable Rectors==

Some of the famous figures that have held the post of rector in UFRJ are: Benjamin Franklin Ramiz Galvão, doctor, first-ever rector and former member of the Brazilian Academy of Literature(ABL); Raul Leitão da Cunha, doctor; Pedro Calmon, former minister of Education and Health; Deolindo Couto, former member of the ABL; Raymundo Augustto de Castro Moniz de Aragão, former minister of Education; Carlos Lessa, economist and former president of &quot;Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social&quot; (National Bank of Economic and Social Development, BNDS).

===Statistics &amp; Heritage===
According to its yearly statistical report (2013), the university controls 52 units and supplementary departments, each linked to one of six academic centers. It has a total of 48 454 active undergraduate students plus 7 333 students in undergraduate online courses, and a yearly graduation rate of 5 381 students. As of post-graduation studies, there are 5 389 individuals undergoing master&#x27;s degree and 5 5382 candidates for doctor&#x27;s degree. Of its 3 821 professors, 3 068 hold a doctor degree, 618 are masters and 61 are specialists. In addition, its high-school unit (&quot;Colégio de Aplicação&quot;, or Application School) accounts for 760 enrolled students.

The university&#x27;s main buildings are located at &quot;Cidade Universitária&quot; (College City, with 5.2 million m2) in &quot;Ilha do Fundão&quot; (Backward Island), but the campus at &quot;Praia Vermelha&quot; (Red Beach, with 100 thousand m2) still gathers a plethora of units and supplementary departments. Additionally, there are the Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences, the Institute of History, the College of Law Studies, the Valongo Observatory, the School of Music, the Residence of College Students and the National Museum (53 276 40 m2). Among the isolated health buildings there are the Maternity School, the São Francisco School-Hospital and the Anna Nery Nursery Schools. The UFRJ possesses additional campuses in Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Chile Avenue (8 550 m2), in the cities of Macaé and Duque de Caxias (149 869,18 m2), Jacarepaguá (10 000 m2), Arraial do Cabo and in Santa Teresa (a 1.5 million m2 research-only wildlife reserve).

==Structure==


the UFRJ can be divided into six university centers plus the &quot;Escritório Técnico da Universidade&quot; (University Technical Department), the &quot;Fórum da Ciência e Cultura&quot; (Forum of Science and Culture, FCC) and the University City Hall. Each center is made of dozens of units and supplementary organs responsible for education, research and extension in their respective areas of knowledge.

===University Centers===
* &quot;Center of Health Sciences (CCS)&quot;: the university&#x27;s largest, involved in activities and research related to biosciences. As a whole, it gathers ten units and fourteen supplementary organs: three hospitals, three &quot;nuclei&quot; (headquarters), two schools, three colleges and thirteen institutes. Activities are developed mostly at CCS&#x27;s main building at College City, but there are also units at Praia Vermelha, in downtown Rio, in Macaé and in Xerém.
* &quot;Center of Technology (CT)&quot;: the university&#x27;s second largest center, it manages two sprawling engineering schools and two high-tech research institutes, all located at College City. The CT also controls two business incubators and one foundation focused at technological studies. These units were all previous to the center&#x27;s foundation, each with a unique history, and their performance is crucial to the national technological environment, given that together they form one of the country&#x27;s most influential tech-poles.
* &quot;Center of Mathematical and Natural Sciences (CCMN)&quot;: originated from the traditional and influential National School of Philosophy, it is made of five institutes and one observatory. Its main infrastructure is located at College City. The Institute of Chemistry and the Institute of Physics are located at Center of Technology&#x27;s Block A and the Institute of Mathematics, at its Block C, but both are units of CCMN. The Valongo Observatory is placed near the Mauá Park, at the top of Morro da Conceição, and it is the country&#x27;s only federal institution to offer undergraduate course in Astronomy.
* &quot;Center of Law and Economic Sciences (CCJE)&quot;: responsible for activities concerning applied social sciences: administration, economics, law, library science and urban planning. It gathers three units (schools) and two supplementary organs (institutes) scattered throughout College CIty, Praia Vermelha and downtown Rio.
* &quot;Center of Philosophy and Human Sciences (CFHC)&quot;: encompasses interdisciplinary academic activities regarding social sciences, especially those with theoretical focus on society formation. The CFCH is made of six units (two schools, one college and three institutes) and two supplementary organs (one headquarter and the Application College, which supports professor-training courses). The CFHC is locates mainly at the campus of Praia Vermelha, though some minor buildings are found in the regions of Largo do São Francisco and Lagoa.
*&quot;Center of Literature and Arts (CLA)&quot;: similar to the other centers, it was founded in 1967. It currently comprises four traditional units of UFRJ: two schools and two colleges focused on the arts, language and architecture. Its main buildings are placed at College City, except for the School of Music, which is located at downtown Rio.
* COPPEAD Graduate School of Business (COPPEAD): The UFRJ School of the Business founded in 1973, located in its own building on the campus of UFRJ Fundão Island is the only business school associated with a Brazilian public university that has international certification, whose is the only of Latin America listed among the 100 best in the world by the prestigious Financial Times ranking.

===Units and supplementary organs===
The so-called &quot;units&quot; and &quot;supplementary organs&quot; are institutions of basically two types: schools/colleges, destined to professional training, research and extension; and institutes, destined to basic research, extension and teaching of a specific area of knowledge. Generally, units deal with undergraduate and postgraduate courses while supplementary organs are charged with coordinating disciplines according to each specific line of research. Additionally, there are &quot;research nuclei&quot;, which fall into the category of &quot;supplementary organs&quot;. As in most Brazilian universities, these two institutional sets are subdivided into &quot;departments&quot;.

===Libraries and museums===
Keeping important historical documents of both national and international relevance, UFRJ&#x27;s libraries and museums can be considered the primary source of inquiry for the country&#x27;s most renowned researchers. In 1983, the university implanted the System of Libraries and Information (SiBI), through which students and staff enjoy easy and speedy access to the entire collection of its forty three libraries. General (i.e. non-affiliated to the institution) digital access to UFRJ&#x27;s libraries is made through the Minerva Base, a database that, much like the SiBI, gathers all university libraries into a single website.

Among the most noteworthy museums and cultural spaces are: the &quot;National Museum&quot;, Latin America&#x27;s largest museum and anthropological of natural history as well as Brazil&#x27;s oldest scientific institution. Its building is a conversion from the Brazilian Imperial Family&#x27;s old palace in &quot;Paço de São Cristóvão&quot; and it was founded by royal figure Dom João VI in 1818, but integrated to the university only much afterwards, in 1946. Brazil&#x27;s emperor Dom Pedro II himself, an enthusiast for scientific knowledge, contributed to the museum&#x27;s collection with Egyptian art, fossils, botanic species and many other items obtained by during his personal trips. Laboratories occupy a great portion of the museum and spread to some buildings raised in &quot;Horto Botânico&quot; (Botanic Garden), in &quot;Quinta da Boa Vista&quot;.

In Botafogo, the university also manages the &quot;Casa da Ciência&quot; (House of Science), a cultural center of science and technology active since 1995 and dedicated to the exploration of languages and of popular forms of communication such as theater, music and audiovisual techniques. It performs periodical workshops and expositions opened to both students and the general public.

===Health complex===
The university&#x27;s medical-hospital network is composed of nine supplementary organs distributed throughout various campuses. Together, these units are responsible for 566 410 treatments, 8 293 surgeries and 18 555 hospitalizations every year.

* &quot;Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital (HUCFF)&quot;: created in 1978, it is UFRJ&#x27;s flagship medical institution. Sprawling through 110 000 meters squared, it is both national and international reference in high surgical procedures of high complexity.
* &quot;São Francisco de Assis Institute of Health (HESFA)&quot;: founded in the 19th century as School Hospital and reopened in 1988 by then-rector Luís Renato Caldas. Sustaining a profile of high-quality customer service clinic, it acts on medical procedures of low or medium complexity and focuses on patients requiring long-term care and hospitalization.
* &quot;Institute of Psichiatry (IPUB)&quot;: acts as Latin America&#x27;s flagship research, post-graduation learning and knowledge-diffuser institution regarding multidisciplinary studies in psychiatry and mental health.
* &quot;Martagão Gesteira Institute of Childcare and Pediatrics (IPPMG)&quot;: institute of nationwide recognition in matters of childcare, it was incorporated to the university after formal proposal from professor Joaquim Martagão Gesteira. It undergoes research in the mother-child field and acts on assistance and teaching and training in pediatrics.
* &quot;Institute of Chest Diseases (IDT)&quot;: founded in 1957 by professor Antonio Ibiapina and, since 2000, adjunct to HUCFF&#x27;s main structure. Promotes full-time assistance and undergoes research regarding respiratory illnesses.
* &quot;Deolindo Couto Institute of Neurology (INDC)&quot;: located at Praia Vermelha campus, is responsible for activities, research, teaching and assistance in the fields of neurology and neurosurgery.
* &quot;Institute of Gynecology (IG)&quot;: founded in 1947 and located at university hospital &quot;Moncorvo Filho&quot;. Notable for providing radio-therapeutic services specifically for matters of gynecology ontology.
* &quot;Edson Saad Institute of Heart (ICES)&quot;: founded in 2003 to develop high-quality research in the fields of cardiology and vascular surgery. The institute initiated its activities in old departments from HUCFF and the School of Medicine.
* &quot;Maternity School (ME)&quot;: founded in 1904 to assist pregnant women and newly born children from unprivileged social backgrounds in the State of Rio de Janeiro. It was pioneer in the use of, among other methods, ultrasonography and dopplerfluxometry in Brazil.

==Campuses==
===Rio de Janeiro===
The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s main infrastructure is the College City, located at and occupying almost all of Ilha do Fundão (Backyard Island), northern Rio de Janeiro. The island was artificially created in 1950 by the union of various already existing islands through embankment techniques. Academic activities in the campus, however, would only start in 1970, and the initial project stated that all active courses would be transferred to the city. Architecture was hugely influenced by modernism and some designs were even awarded, such as the rectory building (designed by Jorge Machado Moreira and awarded at the &quot;IV Bienal de São Paulo&quot;).

The campus has a residence complex for undergraduate students (504 rooms), three university restaurants (commonly called &quot;bandejões&quot;, or &quot;big trays&quot;), a sports center, and banking agencies. In 2010, there was the opening of an integration station for the unified college transport system, aiming for more security and comfort to the college community. Dozens of 24/7 inter-campus bus lines, free for students, are connected to the College City, plus regular urban and intercity lines serving the population of Baixada Fluminense region and of metropolitan Rio de Janeiro.

The campus at Praia Vermelha (Red Beach), locates at Urca, southern Rio, concentrates on courses related mainly to human sciences. Its largest and most historically notable building is the University Pallace, a neoclassical-style premise built between 1842 and 1852 to serve as a hospice, which was inaugurated by emperor Dom Pedro II only ten years later. In 1949, the building was given to the University of Brazil, which then restored and expanded its facilities. 

In the downtown of Rio de Janeiro, one can find many isolated college units: the College of Law Studies, at Conde dos Arcos Palace, former headquarter of Brazilian senate; the School of Music, planted in the old National Library building since 1913; the Valongo Observatory at the top of &quot;Morro da Conceição&quot; (Conceição Hill); the Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences and the Institute of History, both situated in the old National School of Engineering building, at &quot;Largo de São Francisco de Paula&quot;.

In the &quot;2010-2020 UFRJ Master Plan&quot; a project was set for conversion of the Praia Vermelha campus into a great cultural center, consequentially transferring almost all of the campus&#x27; academic activities, plus that of all of college units scattered throughout Rio, to the College City, thus redeeming the city&#x27;s original intent of centering all university activities in Ilha do Fundão. The decision has generated strong polemic with both students and staff, given the great distances between southern (Praia Vermelha) and northern (Ilha do Fundão) Rio and the chaotic traffic that plagues the Red Line of João Goulart Freeway - the &quot;jugular&quot; connecting the College City to Rio.

Aloísio Teixeira, then rector and strong advocate for the integration, argued that the University Palace can bear a circulation of no more than two to three thousand people per day, and that the College City&#x27;s major problems are not on its structure, but on its access points which are more easily fixable matters. Aiming to solve part of the city&#x27;s traffic problem, in mid-2010 Rio de Janeiro saw the building of its first cable-stayed bridge, named &quot;Ponte do Saber&quot; (Knowledge Bridge), which was inaugurated in 2012 to receive a daily average of 25,000 vehicles.

===Duque de Caxias===
Through its biophysics undergraduate course, started in the second half of 2008, UFRJ initiated activities in Xerém, a region with large industrial and technological potential in the city of Duque de Caxias. Aiming to cooperate with Inmetro (National Institute of Metrics, Normalization and Industrial Quality), the university forged a partnership with the government of Duque de Caxias and with the Foundation for Technological Development and Social Policies. Currently, and additionally to biophysics, the Xerém campus offers undergraduate courses in biotechnology and nanotechnology, both added in the first half of 2010. As of the following year, there was the addition of the professional master&#x27;s in Scientific Formation for Biology Teachers, targeted at professors of the biosciences looking for skill improvement. Students have Inmetro&#x27;s infrastructure and laboratories at hand, but most students and staff whose main laboratories are at Ilha do Fundão still have to complete their academic internships at College City. In an attempt to fix this inconvenience, Inmetro agreed to concede its Xerém infrastructures to UFRJ, which was then reinaugurated as a full campus in 2012.

===Macaé===

UFRJ has operated in the city of Macaé since the 1980s, when researchers from its Institute of Biology performed studies in the lakes of &quot;Região dos Lagos&quot; (literally, Lake Regions). In partnership with the city, it instituted the Macaé Nucleus for Ecological Researches (NUPEM) in 1994. The university&#x27;s recognition in and importance to the city was so visible that, in 2012, the City Hall has donated to the institution a 29,000 m2 terrain, in which was raised a new university center. In 2005, NUPEM was officialized as a supplementary organ of the Center of Health Sciences and, in 2006, the university implemented its first course outside Rio de Janeiro, professor training in the biosciences, to be taken in NUPEM&#x27;s headquarters. In 2007, Macaé inaugurated a full university complex with two buildings and seven more planned ones, for graduation, post-graduation and extension courses. During this solemnity there was also the signing of the &quot;Protocolo de Intenções&quot; (Intentions Protocol) between UFRJ and the city, promising the initiation of chemistry and pharmacy courses in 2008.

Currently, the campus is physically distributed among four poles (University Pole, Barreto, Novo Cavaleiros and Ajuda), where the following undergraduate courses are offered: biological sciences, chemistry, nursing and obstetrics, engineering (production, civil and mechanical), pharmacy, medicine, and nutrition; as of post-graduation courses, there are two: environmental and conservation sciences, and bioactive and biosciences products. The main campus was named after former rector Aloísio Teixeira, incumbent from 2003 to 2011, in 2012 (&quot;Campus UFRJ–Macaé Professor Aloísio Teixeira&quot;), honoring his decisive contribution to the spreading of UFRJ through the State of Rio de Janeiro.

===E-learning poles===
E-learning courses are offered by the CEDERJ (Rio de Janeiro Center of Higher-Education E-learning) consortium, signed between UFRJ and the following institutions: Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO), Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ), Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro (UENF) and Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET/RJ).

Taught in a mixed scheme where some activities require the students&#x27; physical presence, UFRJ offers professor training courses in the biosciences, physics, and chemistry. At the course&#x27;s conclusion, a student is awarded with a certificate equivalent to that of physically-based courses offered by the institution, according to each student&#x27;s chosen e-learning pole. Admission are made by an independent &quot;vestibular&quot; organized by the consortium. UFRJ&#x27;s e-learning poles in the State of Rio de Janeiro are: Angra dos Reis, Duque de Caxias, Itaperuna, Macaé, Nova Iguaçu, Paracambi, Piraí, Rio de Janeiro, São Gonçalo, Três Rios, and Volta Redonda.

==Academics==
===Undergraduate courses===

There are 179 undergraduate courses covering all areas of human knowledge and distributed into four types: morning, afternoon, night and integral (all previous three combined) courses. Each courses is linked to one academic institution, but some share multiple institutions, like the nanotechnology course, which is offered by the Polytechnic School, the &quot;Instituto de Biofísica Carlos Chagas Filho&quot; (Institute of Biophysics Carlos Chagas Filho), the Institute of Physics and the &quot;Instituto de Macromoléculas Professora Eloisa Mano&quot; (Institute of Machomolecules Professor Eloisa Mano).
Below are listed all offered courses and the respective specializations (including emphases, habilitations or modalities) for which students can opt during their graduation.

===Postgraduate courses===

There are 345 post-graduation courses, being 167 &quot;lato sensu&quot; (specialization) and 178 &quot;stricto sensu&quot; (master&#x27;s and doctor&#x27;s degrees). Similarly to the undergraduate courses, each post-grad course is linked to a specific academic institution. As of 2010, there were 1 965 scholarship programs from Coordination of Higher-Education Personnel Improvement (CAPES) available to post-graduation candidates, 844 from the National Council of Technologic and Scientific Development (CNPq) and 800 from the university itself.

===Admissions===
Similarly to most Brazilian public universities, admissions to the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro are defined by highly competitive entrance exams held every year (commonly known in Brazil as &quot;vestibular&quot;). Anyone who was already graduated from high school is eligible to the undergraduate courses. Admission is also possible by transfer (known as &quot;external transfer&quot;), exemption from exams (&quot;reentrance&quot;) or by international partnerships. 

Until the late 1980s, the admission exam was managed as a unified &quot;vestibular&quot; by Cesgranrio Foundation. Given the university&#x27;s disagreement with the test&#x27;s methodology - which consisted almost entirely in multiple-choice questions -, the institution quit the partnership and organized its own &quot;vestibular&quot;, named &quot;Concurso de Acesso aos Cursos de Graduação&quot; (Undergraduate Courses Admission Exam). The test was solely based on open-ended responses, and its elaborate questions eventually led it to be considered one of Brazil&#x27;s toughest and most demanding higher education admission exams.

Since 2012, the university responded favorably to the utilization of the &quot;Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio&quot; (High School National Exam, or ENEM; a yearly nationwide exam managed by the Ministry of Education) for student admission. The exam&#x27;s importance grew to the point that, in 2011, the UFRJ extinguished its &quot;Concurso de Acesso&quot; and made the ENEM its single admission exam; candidates&#x27; selection was delegated to the &quot;Sistema de Seleção Unificada&quot; (Unified Selection System, or SiSU; also under the Ministry of Education&#x27;s rule). UFRJ quickly became one of the most coveted institutions in the system: as of the second semester of 2012, it received 103 829 applications, the highest of any other university in SiSU.

The institution also adheres to affirmative action policies since 2010: currently, 30% of all vacancies are reserved by some form of affirmative action measure; the most common basis for selection under this system is through socioeconomic standards, favoring students with public schooling backgrounds and whose families earn less than one and a half minimum wage (R$1 086/month, or roughly US$15/day, as of January, 2014).

===Student unions===
Students are formally represented by the &quot;Diretório Central dos Estudantes Mário Prata&quot; (Mário Prata Central Student Directory, or DCE), which was founded in 1930 - preceding even the National Student Union (UNE, 1937). The entity remained influential until its shutdown by the military regime of 1964–85, when dozens of union leaders, including student and then-president of DCE Mario de Souza Prata, were murdered. In the late-1970s, given a gradual political opening, academic centers such as the DCE were given permission to function once again. Among the students that participated in the DCE&#x27;s reactivation are Mário Furley Schimidt and some member of popular Brazilian comedy show Casseta &amp; Planeta, like Marcelo Madureira, Beto Silva and Hélio de la Peña.

Besides the DCE, minor academic centers (CAs) act as students representative organs for each course: the Carlos Chagas Academic Center for the College of Medicine, the Polytechnic School Academic Center of Engineering, the Cândido de Oliveira Academic Center for the College of Law Studies, the Max Planck Academic Center for the Institute of Physics and the Academic Directory for the School of Chemistry, to cite the most notable.

The infamous episode known as &quot;Massacre da Praia Vermelha&quot; (Red Beach Massacre) was a hallmark the history of Brazilian student unions. At dawn of September 23, 1968, squads from the military government invading the old facility of then-National College of Medicine and savagely beat all students sheltered there. There was also massive depredation of public patrimony, as the action disenabled several of the college&#x27;s laboratories and administrative sectors. Around 600 students were gathered to protest against the government&#x27;s arbitrary and oppressive actions (ex.: the shutdown of DCE and UNE, the increase in meal prices) and to vindicate the release of Law student Rodrigo Lima, arrested for 35 days in the &quot;Batalhão de Guardas do Exército&quot; (Army Squad Battalion).

==Technological Park of Rio==
The Parque Tecnológico do Rio (Technological Park of Rio) is also located in College City. It is a technopole geared towards research in energy, oil, and gas. In partnership with Petrobras, UFRJ intends to convert an area of 350 000 m2 into the world&#x27;s largest oil-related technological research center, given that exploration and oil extraction from the recently discovered pre-salt layer fields is in urgent need of new, more affordable techniques. Intense private and state investments in the region, plus the high expectations it has generated, led it to be considered a Brazilian &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;. The park gathers, among its main facilities:

* &quot;Leopoldo Américo Miguez de Mello Research Center (CENPES)&quot;: founded in 1962 and managed by Petrobras, it is responsible for research and development (R&amp;D) and for the company&#x27;s basic engineering matters; it is the largest oil research pole in the southern hemisphere.
* &quot;Electric Energy Research Center (CEPEL)&quot;: founded in 1974, it is part of group Eletrobrás and manages R&amp;D related to the generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy. It is also the hemisphere&#x27;s largest research center in the field.
* &quot;Mineral Technology Center (CETEM)&quot;: founded in 1978 and under direct command by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI), it acts on the technological development concerning to minerals.
* &quot;General Electric Global Technological Center (GE)&quot;: under construction, with inauguration planned to 2014. Until then, General Electric operates in the facilities of the Center of Excellence in Communication and Information Technology (CETIC).
* &quot;Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute of Post-Graduation and Research in Engineering (COPPE)&quot;: UFRJ&#x27;s supplementary organ, it is Latin America&#x27;s largest research and learning center of engineering. Also notable for owning the world&#x27;s largest (volume terms) and deepest oceanic tank, which is used to simulate sea-life conditions.
Additionally, there is the Center of Excellence in Natural Gas (CEGN), the Institute of Nuclear Engineering (IEN), the Nucleus of Ecosystem Recovery Technologies (NUTRE) and a virtual reality center linked to the Laboratory of Computational Engineering Methods (LAMCE). Among the corporations with research units established in the Technological Park or in other spots of College City are: L&#x27;Oréal, Siemens AG, Usiminas, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, FMC Technologies, Repsol YPF, Halliburton and Tenaris Confab. Public biddings for the construction of new research centers and commercial tower, all capable of supporting one hundred new more enterprises, are currently under request. The Park project has also attracted over 200 small or medium-sized companies to its centers, resulting in higher stakes for its innovational potential.

==Projects==
===UFRJ Newspaper===
The &quot;Jornal da UFRJ&quot; (UFRJ Newspaper) is a monthly publication by the General Superintendence of Social Communication. It has been on circulation since 2003, covering subjects of academic interest and government affairs. It is available both on print and digitally, with 25 000 copies being distributed across the universities many campuses.

===UFRJ Sea===
The &quot;UFRJ Mar&quot; (UFRJ Sea) was developed along Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s coastline and comprehends several fields, from physical education and engineering to biological sciences and geosciences. The project relies on one of Brazil&#x27;s most complex set of R&amp;D laboratories in maritime and coastal studies.

===Getting to Know the UFRJ===
The &quot;Conhecendo a UFRJ&quot; (Getting to Know the UFRJ) is a two-day yearly event that takes place at College City, when high-school students have lectures about the institution, tour through its main campus and get to know its academic routine and student life. As of 2010, on its eighth edition, approximately 14 000 students participated in the event.

===Plant Waves===
Developed by COPPE with Government of Ceará supporting Pecém Wave Power Plant is the first in Latin America and places Brazil in a select group of countries with knowledge to extract electrical energy from sea waves. Factory with 100% Brazilian technology, is located 60 km from Fortaleza in the breakwater of the Port of Pecém. The project of researchers from COPPE underwater Technology Laboratory is designed in modules which allows the expansion of the capacity of the plant.

===MagLev Cobra===
The Maglev Cobra is a levitation train developed at the UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) by Coppe (Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute of Graduate Studies and Research in Engineering) and the Polytechnic School by LASUP (Superconducting Applications Laboratory). The Brazilian train, as well as the German maglev floats on the tracks, with only friction with air during their displacement. Maglev Cobra based on levitation, moving without friction with the ground by a linear motor primary short. The vehicle has been designed towards a revolution in public transportation through high-tech, non-polluting way, energy efficient and affordable to large urban centers.

The deployment cost of Maglev Cobra is significantly lower than the subway, getting to cost only one-third of this. Its operating normal speed will be within a range of 70 to 100 km/h, compatible to the subway and ideal for urban public transport.

===LabOceano===
Able to reproduce the main features of the marine environment and simulate phenomena occurring in water depths greater than 2000 meters, LabOceano is a strategic technological support for Brazil, which has more than 90% of its oil reserves concentrated at sea, and for the oil and shipping industries. The ocean tank holds 23 million liters of water and its height corresponds to an eight-story building. Today, only two facilities in the world exist with similar characteristics to the tank designed by COPPE researchers: the Marintek, Norway, 10 meters, and Marin, Holland, 10.5 meters.

<text>The siege of Bastogne () was an engagement in December 1944 between American and German forces at the Belgian town of Bastogne, as part of the larger Battle of the Bulge. The goal of the German offensive was the harbor at Antwerp. In order to reach it before the Allies could regroup and bring their superior air power to bear, German mechanized forces had to seize the roadways through eastern Belgium. Because all seven main roads in the densely wooded Ardennes highlands converged on Bastogne, just a few miles away from the border with neighboring Luxembourg, control of its crossroads was vital to the German attack. 

The German offensive began on 16 December. Although outnumbered, the regiments of the 28th Infantry Division delayed the German advance towards Bastogne, allowing American units, including the 101st Airborne Division, to reach Bastogne before the German forces surrounded the town and isolated it on 20 December. Until 23 December, the weather prevented Allied aircraft from attempting to resupply Bastogne or from performing ground attack missions against German forces. The siege was lifted on 26 December, when a spearhead of the 4th Armored Division and other elements of General George Patton&#x27;s Third Army opened a corridor to Bastogne.


==Background==
After the successful invasion of Normandy and the subsequent eastward push through France, the Allied front lines extended from Nijmegen in the north down to neutral Switzerland in the south. The valuable port city of Antwerp had been captured during the push, and by the time winter arrived, the Allies even had control of German territory near the city of Aachen. Adolf Hitler soon laid out a plan to attack the Allied lines in Belgium and Luxembourg; 25 divisions would launch a surprise attack through the Ardennes, with the aim of crossing the river Meuse (called &quot;Maas&quot; in German and Dutch) and recapturing Antwerp. Despite major misgivings from his senior commanders, including Gerd von Rundstedt and Walther Model, the plan was not modified and the jump-off date was eventually set as 16 December 1944. Meanwhile, the Allied commanders considered the Ardennes area to be unsuitable for a large-scale German attack, mainly because of terrain issues. In addition, intelligence reports suggested that the only German divisions stationed in the area were weary, and in the weeks leading up to the assault, no Allied commander saw reason to believe that an attack was imminent. Bastogne, a hub city that commanded several important roads in the area, was defended mainly by the 28th Infantry Division, which had seen continuous fighting from 22 July to 19 November, most recently in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, before being assigned to this relatively quiet area. The Allies believed only an infantry division was present opposite the 28th Infantry, and they believed any attack along this sector would be limited in scale. The seven roads in and out of Bastogne were critical to the movement of German armor, making Allied retention of the roads imperative.

Hasso von Manteuffel—commanding the 5th Panzer Army—gave Heinrich Freiherr von Lüttwitz′s XLVII Panzer Corps responsibility for capturing Bastogne, before crossing the Meuse near Namur. Lüttwitz planned to attack a front with three divisions: the 26th Volksgrenadier and the 2nd Panzer would lead the assault, with the &quot;Panzer-Lehr-Division&quot; behind them. Opposing this significant force were two battalions of the 110th Infantry Regiment (the third was held back as a division reserve), responsible for a front along the river Our which forms the border between Germany and neighboring Luxembourg. The Allied forces were gathered into small groups at major Luxembourgish villages, with outposts along the river manned only during the daytime. Being too thin to maintain an even battle line, the defenders focused their attention on the four roads that crossed the Our. Due to heavy rain preceding the German attack, only one of the roads was in good enough condition to be used as a crossing point—the northernmost road, which crossed the Our at Dasburg on its way to the Luxembourgish town of Clervaux (in German: &quot;Klerf&quot;, in Luxembourgish: &quot;Klierf&quot;) and Bastogne. The 2nd Panzer Division was assigned to cross the river along this road, while the 26th Volksgrenadier Division would construct a bridge south near Gemünd for its crossing. Lüttwitz realized the importance of the road network of Bastogne—he knew that the town had to be captured before his corps could venture too far westward. Therefore, he ordered the &quot;Panzer-Lehr&quot; Division to push forward to Bastogne as soon as his other troops had crossed the river Clerve in Northern Luxembourg.

==Prelude==

===The attack===
On the evening of 15 December, the 26th Volksgrenadier established an outpost line on the west bank of the Our, something they did routinely during the nighttime. At 03:00, engineers began ferrying men and equipment over the river where they began assembling at the departure point, quite close to the American garrisons. At 05:30, the German artillery began bombarding the American positions, knocking out telephone lines, as the infantry started to advance. The Germans attacked swiftly, their advances made possible by sheer weight of numbers. In the Luxembourgish village of Weiler, one American company, supported by some mortars and a platoon of anti-tank guns, lasted until nightfall against repeated attacks from multiple German battalions. German engineers completed bridges over the Our before dark, and armor began moving to the front, adding to the Germans&#x27; vast numerical superiority. But in the end, the Germans were significantly delayed by the American defenders—their plan to cross the Clerf River by nightfall on the first day was delayed by three days.

On 19 December, the 28th Division command post transferred to Bastogne from Wiltz, a large Luxembourgish town to the southeast. At Wiltz, the division put up its last stand; 3rd Battalion of the 110th—supported by armor and artillery—arrived at the town around noon of that day. The 44th Engineer Battalion was set up north of the town, but they were soon overwhelmed and retreated into the town, blowing up a bridge behind them. This small force—numbering no more than 500 in total—held out until the evening, when their position became completely untenable and they retreated to the west. With the 110th Infantry completely destroyed as an effective combat unit, it would be up to the rest of the Allied army to defend Bastogne.

===Commitment of reserves===
Despite several notable signs in the weeks preceding the attack, the Ardennes Offensive achieved virtually complete surprise. By the end of the second day of battle, it became apparent that the 28th Infantry was near collapse. To assist in the defense of Bastogne, Major General Troy H. Middleton, already commander of VIII Corps, was given Combat Command B of the 10th Armored Division. CCB consisted of the 3rd Tank Battalion, 20th Armored Infantry Battalion, C Company 21st Tank Battalion, B Company 54th Armored Infantry Battalion, C Company, 609th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 419th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, and three companies of support troops. General George S. Patton, commander of the U.S. Third Army was not happy about giving up the CCB unit right before he planned an offensive near Mainz but General Omar Bradley, commander of the 12th Army Group, ordered Patton to release the unit. Meanwhile, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, ordered forward the SHAEF reserve, composed of the 82nd Airborne Division, commanded by Major General James Gavin, and the 101st Airborne Division, temporarily under command of Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, at Reims. These were veteran troops that had served with distinction since the parachute drops in Normandy and were resting and re-equipping after two months of combat in the Netherlands after Operation Market Garden. Both divisions were alerted on the evening of 17 December, and not having transport automatically assigned for their use, began arranging trucks for movement forward. The 82nd—longer in reserve and thus better re-equipped—moved out first. The 101st left Camp Mourmelon on the afternoon of 18 December, with the order of march of the division artillery, division trains, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), 506th PIR, 502nd PIR, and 327th Glider Infantry Regiment (GIR). Much of the convoy was conducted at night in drizzle and sleet, using headlights despite threat of air attack to speed the movement, and at one point the combined column stretched from Bouillon, Belgium, back to Reims, a distance of .

The 101st Airborne was originally supposed to go to Werbomont on the northern shoulder but was rerouted to Bastogne, located away on a high plateau, while the 82nd Airborne, because it was able to leave sooner, went to Werbomont to block the critical advance of the &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; (&quot;Combat Group Peiper&quot;). The 705th Tank Destroyer Battalion—in reserve to the north—was ordered to Bastogne to provide anti-tank support to the armor-less 101st Airborne on 18 December and arrived late the next evening. The first elements of the 501st PIR entered the division assembly area west of Bastogne shortly after midnight of 19 December, and by 09:00 the entire division had arrived.

McAuliffe sent the 501st PIR southeast through Bastogne at 06:00 to develop the situation. By 09:00, it had advanced and deployed on either side of the highway to Magéret and Longvilly, where the &quot;Panzer-Lehr-Division&quot; was engaged in an all-day action to destroy the armor-infantry combat teams assigned to slow the German advance. The 506th followed shortly thereafter, its 1st Battalion was sent to Noville to reinforce Major William R. Desobry&#x27;s team from the 10th Armored CCB while the other two battalions were ordered to act as reserves north of Bastogne. The 502nd PIR marched north and northwest to establish a line from Champs east to Recogne, while the 327th GIR, newly arrived, protected the division service area southwest of Bastogne until German intentions could be deciphered.

===Initial combat at Noville===
On 19–20 December, the 1st Battalion of the 506th PIR was ordered to support Team Desobry, a battalion-sized tank-infantry task force of the 10th Armored Division assigned to defend Noville located north-northeast of both Foy and of Bastogne just away. With just four M18 Hellcat tank destroyers of the 705th Tank Destroyer Battalion to assist, the paratroopers attacked units of the 2nd Panzer Division, whose mission was to proceed by secondary roads via Monaville (just northwest of Bastogne) to seize a key highway and capture, among other objectives, fuel dumps—for the lack of which the overall German counter-offensive faltered and failed. Worried about the threat to its left flank in Bastogne, it organized a major combined arms attack to seize Noville. Team Desobry&#x27;s high speed highway journey to reach the blocking position is one of the few documented cases in which the top speed of the M18 Hellcat was actually used to get ahead of an enemy force as envisioned by its specifications.

The attack of 1st Battalion and the M18 Hellcat tank destroyers of the 705th TD Battalion together destroyed at least 30 German tanks and inflicted 500–1,000 casualties on the attacking forces in what amounted to a spoiling attack. The 3rd Battalion was ordered forward from a reserve position north of Bastogne to ease the pressure on 1st Battalion by occupying a supporting position in Foy to the south.

The heavy losses inflicted by the tank-destroyers deceived the German commander into believing the village was being held by a much stronger force and he recoiled from further attacks on the village, committing a strategic error while seeking tactical advantage—significantly delaying the German advance and setting the stage for the siege of Bastogne just to the south. This delay also gave the 101st Airborne Division enough time to organize defenses around Bastogne. After two days, the 2nd Panzer Division finally continued on its original mission to the Meuse River. As a consequence of its involvement at Bastogne, and its failure to dislodge the airborne forces, the column ultimately ran out of fuel at Celles, where it was destroyed by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division and the British 29th Armoured Brigade.

By the time the 1st Battalion pulled out of Noville on the 20th, the village of Foy half-way to Bastogne center had been captured from the 3rd Battalion by a separate attack, forcing the 1st Battalion to then fight its way through Foy. By the time 1st Battalion made it to the safety of American lines, it had lost 13 officers and 199 enlisted men, out of about 600 troops, and was assigned as the division reserve. Team Desobry lost a quarter of its troops and was reduced to just four medium tanks when it passed through the lines of 3rd Battalion.

==Battle==
The 101st Airborne formed an all-round perimeter using the 502nd PIR on the northwest shoulder to block the 26th Volksgrenadier, the 506th PIR to block entry from Noville, the 501st PIR defending the eastern approach, and the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment scattered from Marvie in the southeast to Champs in the west along the southern perimeter, augmented by engineer and artillery units plugging gaps in the line. The division service area to the west of Bastogne had been raided the first night, causing the loss of almost its entire medical company, and numerous service troops were used as infantry to reinforce the thin lines. CCB of the 10th Armored Division, severely weakened by losses to its Team Desobry, Team Cherry (Lt. Col. Henry T. Cherry), and Team O&#x27;Hara (Lt. Col. James O&#x27;Hara) in delaying the Germans, formed a mobile &quot;fire brigade&quot; of 40 light and medium tanks (including survivors of CCR 9th Armored Division and eight replacement tanks found unassigned in Bastogne).

Three artillery battalions were commandeered and formed a temporary artillery group. Each had twelve howitzers, providing the division with heavy firepower in all directions restricted only by its limited ammunition supply. Col. Roberts, commanding CCB, also rounded up 600+ stragglers from the rout of VIII Corps and formed Team SNAFU as a further stopgap force.

Many of the artillery guns were used in a direct fire role against enemy armor, with over 2000 rounds used for this purpose on December 20. The division&#x27;s anti-aircraft batteries were also moved into the front lines to fire against enemy armor to augment their 57mm anti-tank guns

As a result of the powerful American defense to the north and east, XLVII Panzer Corps commander Gen. von Lüttwitz decided to encircle Bastogne and strike from the south and southwest, beginning on the winter solstice, the night of 20/21 December. German &quot;Panzer&quot; reconnaissance units had initial success, nearly overrunning the American artillery positions southwest of Bastogne before being stopped by a makeshift force. All seven highways leading to Bastogne were cut by German forces by noon on 21 December, and by nightfall the conglomeration of airborne and armored infantry forces were recognized by both sides as being surrounded.

The American soldiers were outnumbered approximately 5 to 1 and were lacking in cold-weather gear, ammunition, food, medical supplies, and senior leadership (as many senior officers, including the 101st&#x27;s commander—Major General Maxwell Taylor—were elsewhere). Due to the worst winter weather in memory, the surrounded U.S. forces could not be resupplied by air nor was tactical air support available due to cloudy weather.

However, the two Panzer divisions of the XLVII Panzer Corps—after using their mobility to isolate Bastogne, continued their mission towards the Meuse on 22 December, rather than attacking Bastogne with a single large force. They left just one regiment behind to assist the 26th Volksgrenadier Division in capturing the crossroads. The XLVII Panzer Corps probed different points of the southern and western defensive perimeter in echelon, where Bastogne was defended by just a single airborne regiment and support units doubling as infantry. This played into the American advantage of interior lines; the defenders were able to shift artillery fire and move their limited &quot;ad hoc&quot; armored forces to meet each successive assault.
It was on 22 December that von Lüttwitz submitted the following demand for surrender to his American counterpart commanding the American forces in Bastogne, McAuliffe:

Shortly thereafter, McAuliffe sent the following communication to von Lüttwitz in response to the German demand:
To the German Commander.

NUTS!

The American Commander
The commander of the US 327th Glider Infantry Regiment interpreted it to the German truce party as &quot;Go to hell!&quot;

Despite the defiant American response to the surrender demand, the 26th VG received one Panzergrenadier regiment from the 15th Panzergrenadier Division on Christmas Eve for its main assault the next day. That night, at about 7:00 PM, Luftwaffe bombers attacked Bastogne, killing 21 in an aid station. Because it lacked sufficient troops and those of the 26th VG Division were near exhaustion, the XLVII Panzer Corps concentrated its assault on several individual locations on the west side of the perimeter in sequence rather than launching one simultaneous attack on all sides. The assault—led by 18 tanks carrying a battalion of infantry—pierced the lines of the 327th&#x27;s 3rd Battalion (officially, the 1st Battalion, 401st Glider Infantry), and advanced as far as the battalion command post at Hemroulle.

However, the 327th held its original positions and repulsed infantry assaults that followed, capturing 92 Germans. The panzers that had achieved the penetration divided into two columns, one trying to reach Champs from the rear, and were destroyed in detail by two companies of the 1st Battalion 502nd PIR under Lt. Col. Patrick F. Cassidy and four tank destroyers of the 705th Tank Destroyer Battalion.

Allied control of Bastogne was a major obstacle to the German armored advance, and the morale of Allied forces elsewhere on the Western Front was boosted by news of the stubborn defense of the besieged town.

===Breaking the encirclement===
Elements of Patton&#x27;s Third Army succeeded in reaching Bastogne from the southwest, arriving from the direction of Assenois. The spearhead reached the lines of the 326th Engineers on 26 December, Cobra King being the first tank to make contact at approximately 16:50. The 101st&#x27;s ground communications with the American supply dumps were restored on 27 December, and the wounded were evacuated to the rear. Taylor reached Bastogne with the 4th Armored Division and resumed command.

Although Bastogne would be the scene of extreme fighting for several more weeks, with the break of the encirclement the siege period was over.

==Aftermath==

The 101st Airborne Division&#x27;s casualties from 19 December 1944 to 6 January 1945 were 341 killed, 1,691 wounded, and 516 missing. Several regiments within the 101st were nicknamed &quot;The Battered Bastards of Bastogne&quot;, due to their part in holding the important crossroads town during the Battle of the Bulge. For its defense of Bastogne, the headquarters of the 101st Airborne Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation (PUC), with a streamer, embroidered BASTOGNE, for the division&#x27;s colors. Also, the division was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre 1940 with Palm, Streamer embroidered BASTOGNE, and cited in the Order of the Day of the Belgian Army for action at Bastogne.

The 10th Armored Division&#x27;s Combat Command B incurred approximately 500 casualties. The 10th Armored Division&#x27;s Combat Command B and 21st Tank Battalion were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation (PUC) for their actions at Bastogne. Years after the war, McAuliffe said &quot;In my opinion, Combat Command B of the 10th Armored Division was never properly credited with their important role in the Bastogne battle.&quot;

Augusta Chiwy, a nurse who administered aid to the wounded during the siege, was honored with the Civilian Award for Humanitarian Service by the US Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman in December 2011.

<text>Wolfgang Robert Paalen (July 22, 1905 in Vienna, Austria – September 24, 1959 in Taxco, Mexico) was an Austrian-Mexican painter, sculptor, and art philosopher. A member of the Abstraction-Création group from 1934 to 1935, he joined the influential Surrealist movement in 1935 and was one of its prominent exponents until 1942. Whilst in exile in Mexico, he founded his own counter-surrealist art-magazine &quot;DYN&quot;, in which he summarized his critical attitude towards radical subjectivism and Freudo-Marxism in Surrealism with his philosophy of contingency. He rejoined the group between 1951 and 1954, during his sojourn in Paris.

== Family and childhood ==

Wolfgang Paalen was born in one of the famous &quot;Wienzeilenhäuser&quot; designed by Otto Wagner in Vienna (Köstlergasse 1 / Linke Wienzeile No. 40), Austria. He was the first of four sons of the Austrian-Jewish merchant and inventor , and his German wife, the actress Clothilde Emilie Gunkel. Gustav Robert, who had Polish-Ashkenazi and Spanish-Sephardic origins, converted to Protestantism in 1900 and changed his name from &quot;Pollak&quot; to &quot;Paalen&quot; in the same year. His considerable wealth was based on modernist inventions and patents such as the vacuum cleaner, the vacuum flask, known under the name Thermos bottle, and the first flow-type heater (for Junkers), amongst others. In a relatively short period Gustav R. Paalen managed to ascend into the distinguished Viennese upper-class of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He became also a well known collector of Old Master paintings with masterpieces, like Francisco Goya&#x27;s &quot;Señora Sabasa Garcia&quot;, which he had acquired from the Berlin patron Henri James Simon and is today one of the highlights of the National Gallery, Washington. As a friend of Wilhelm von Bode and member of the &quot;Freundeskreis des Kaiser-Friedrich Museums, Berlin&quot;, he also financed the acquisition of the famous Titian painting &quot;Venus with the Organ-Player&quot;.
The first years of his life Wolfgang Paalen spent between Vienna and Styria where his father had opened the fashionable health resort Tobelbad, in the presence of Franz Joseph I of Austria, to whom he dedicated a memorial still visible today. In Tobelbad Paalen senior received such prominent guests as Gustav Mahler, poet and artist Fritz von Herzmanovsky-Orlando, Julius Meier-Graefe, Ida Zweig (the mother of Stefan Zweig), among others. Some sources claim that it was Paalen who introduced Alma Mahler, during her visit in Tobelbad in 1910, to the German architect Walter Gropius, whom she married later. 1912 the Paalen family moved to Berlin and to the Silesian city of Sagan (today Żagań), where his father had bought and rebuilt the castle of &quot;St. Rochusburg&quot;. During World War I Gustav Robert served both empires, the Austrian and the German, with the organization of food supply and worked closely together with Walther Rathenau and Albert Ballin&#x27;s Zentral-Einkaufsgesellschaft. Wolfgang attended different schools in Sagan, and during the war his parents also engaged a private tutor. The teacher was also an organist who specialized in Johann Sebastian Bach, who thus became Wolfgang&#x27;s favourite composer.

== Early teachers and decline of the family ==
In 1919 the family moved to Rome, where they kept a luxurious household in the Villa Caetani on the Gianicolo and received many guests, such as the German painter Leo von König (1871–1944) who became Wolfgang&#x27;s first art teacher. It was in Rome, under the guidance of his father&#x27;s friend, the archeologist Ludwig Pollak, that he became an expert in Greek and Roman archaeology. In 1923 he returned to Berlin alone to apply for the academy. Although unsuccessful, he met his lifelong friend, companion and patron, the Swiss violinist, collector, filmmaker and photographer Eva Sulzer (Winterthur 1902 – 1990 Mexico City). In 1925 he exhibited at the Berlin Secession and studied further in aesthetics, deeply influenced by Julius Meier-Graefe, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and the Gestalt theory of Max Wertheimer. It is here and with hypnopompic hallucinations in the castle in Sagan that he found the base for his later ideas of a deep entanglement of vision and outer world. After another year of studies, in Paris and Cassis (1925–26), where he met Roland Penrose, Jean Varda (Janco) and Georges Braque, he visited the art school of Hans Hofmann in Munich and, in 1928, Saint-Tropez. He then decided to settle in Paris. The year 1928 marks also the beginning of the decline of the family&#x27;s splendour, once founded on the patriarchal rules of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. After a homoerotic affair with a mental healer, his younger brother Hans-Peter died unexpectedly in a Berlin insane asylum, presumably of suicide; the parents consequently separated; their mother&#x27;s bipolar disposition intensified as a result; the fortune of Gustav Paalen is quashed after the Black Tuesday, 1929. A later tragedy, crucial to Paalen&#x27;s development, was his beloved brother Rainer&#x27;s shooting himself in head with a pistol. Wolfgang witnessed the event, although Rainer survived, following treatment in a Berlin hospital and escaped from the city in 1933. He died in a mental hospital in Czechoslovakia in 1942.

== Paris and surrealism ==

In Paris he studied for a short time with Fernand Léger and in 1933 became a member of the Abstraction-Création group. He left the group in 1935, together with Hans Arp and Jean Hélion. His work at this time was inspired by Paul Valéry&#x27;s &quot;Eupalinos&quot; and tends to macerate and condensate the abstract hardliners with regard to the Surrealists. The pictorial results may be seen as &quot;language games&quot;: testing the point to which concrete forms may be reduced to latency and the point where they transmit multiple meanings. Paalen anticipated with this research, in a certain sense, the later attempts of such abstractionists as Mark Rothko (&quot;Multiforms&quot;) and Arshile Gorky and amplified his attempts to visualize his idea of human perception as deeply linked to a cosmic texture of latent or possible contents, with whom every organism is interweaved. In 1934 he married the French poet Alice Phillipot, later known as Alice Rahon and again met frequently with Roland Penrose and his wife Valentine Boué, who brought the Paalens into contact with Paul Éluard. In the summer of 1935 he spent some time at the castle home of Lise Deharme, where he met the Parisian Surrealists and André Breton. An intense friendship developed almost immediately, and Breton involved his new adept in surrealist activities such as the &quot;Exposition surréaliste d&#x27;objets&quot;, which opened at the Galerie Charles Ratton in 1936. Here, Paalen showed &quot;L´heure exacte&quot; (The Exact Time), a clock with glass eyes and feather hands, which was displayed next to Giacometti&#x27;s &quot;Boule suspendue&quot; (Suspended Ball). A small glazed showcase with clay idols called &quot;Aux bons soins du navigateur&quot; (At the Mercy of the Navigator) was shown, as was &quot;Le passage à niveau&quot; (The Level Crossing), a wooden root elegantly leaning on a cork wall, along with two other objects made of roots: &quot;Le crâne de Voltaire&quot; (Voltaire&#x27;s Skull) and &quot;Les cerveaux de Rembrandt&quot; (Rembrandt&#x27;s Brains). That same year Paalen had a solo exhibition of paintings in Paris at the Galerie Pierre, owned by Breton&#x27;s friend Pierre Loeb. Breton and Penrose included him in the organization of the International Surrealist Exhibition in London, where he presented twelve oils, gouaches and objects as well as his first fumage (&quot;Dictated by a Candle&quot;) representing a ghostly hand performing the act of painting. The contact with Breton deepened during that time and Paalen also participated in the design of Breton&#x27;s Galerie Gradiva. There he met and worked with Marcel Duchamp and presented his object &quot;Chaise envahie de lierre&quot;, acquired in the gallery by Marie-Laure de Noailles, who installed it in her famous bathroom, mentioned and illustrated in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in April 1938.

===Fumage and first masterpieces===

In the course of his association with the Surrealists and their attempts to transform automatic writing into drawing and painting, he was an early modern practitioner of fumage – a technique for generating evocative patterns with the smoke and soot of a lit candle, the earliest documented practitioner of which was American clock maker Silas Hoadley. Between 1936 and 1937 Paalen developed with these visionary-ephemeral forms on canvas, which he then mostly painted over in oil, a number of mature paintings which soon made his international reputation.

The further development in the work of Paalen continues to follow up the idea of a biological-evolutionary-physical-cosmological continuum, in which the human organism can evolve and unfold. Prelude for a series of oil-Fumages within the Surrealist group gave the discreet affair of Pablo Picasso with Alice Rahon which had led to an abortion. The deep crisis of the couple and Paalen&#x27;s first grave attack of depression led to his first important Surrealist masterpiece, &quot;Pays interdit&quot; (&quot;Forbidden Land&quot;), an apocalyptic landscape dominated by a female goddess and fallen, meteorite-like planets. Paalen had designed his personal model of the permeable poetic soul in the form of a cryptic, abyssal landscape, pervaded by a mixture of feminine mystique and romantic ‘shock’ imagery reminiscent of pre-Celtic faerie mysteries and their cosmic allusions, as these are known in the lyrical tradition of Brittany. This was also the first painting, into which he artfully integrated his fumage, in the extremely fine, crystalline execution of the lower section. In 1937 he realized many paintings in this style, including &quot;Fata Alaska&quot;.

===International Exhibition of Surrealism 1938 and surrealist objects===

Together with Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray and Salvador Dalí, Paalen was among those responsible for the design of the 1938 International Exhibition of Surrealism at the Palais des Beaux Arts in Paris, where he produced a floor, with dead leaves and mud from the Montparnasse Cemetery, and an installation named &quot;Avant La Mare&quot;, consisting of an artificial pond with water, real water-lilies and reeds, beneath Duchamp&#x27;s ceiling of empty coal sacks. The doll Paalen decorated came with a silk scarf, a giant bat on her head and an eerie, mushroom-covered leaf-dress. It anticipated the barely visible, floating, gliding totemic fairy creatures from his oil paintings with fumage that Pierre Colle would show the following June in his surrealist gallery. He also participated in the editorial of the catalogue, published as &quot;Dictionnaire abrégé du Surrealisme&quot; to the show, in which his most famous object, &quot;Nuage articulé&quot;, was discreetly announced as a drawing. Recent research suggests that Paalen had a huge influence on the design of the exhibition&#x27;s Great Hall. Other critics suggest that the entire installation was meant to imply the minatorial situation of the Surrealist group itself, reflected by the approaching war, as well as a huge mother&#x27;s womb as vade mecum to fight the causes of the crisis, which were located in the paternalistic fixations of the whole epoch. Paalen&#x27;s biographer Andreas Neufert, in particular, suggests the latter reading and sees the installation as a symptom of an ideological shift within Surrealism, away from Freud&#x27;s rigid theory of the Oedipus complex to ideas centred on Otto Rank&#x27;s theory The Trauma of Birth, with its recognition of the emotional nature of the child and its ties to the mother. This latter theory was represented and defended exclusively by Paalen and his wife Alice Rahon in this period.

The erotic connotations of &quot;Nuage articulé&quot;, with its umbrella covered with natural sponges, embodied a dynamic sense of contradiction: bloom with stalk; sponge as symbol of nature, as a feminine utensil, which touched and cleaned naked female skin; umbrella as a masculine symbol of order and protection from natural forces. It thus became widely recognized among the Surrealists and their growing public. Geo Dupin, Paalen&#x27;s sister-in-law, remembered that Alfred H. Barr, Jr. had been extremely taken with Paalen&#x27;s object and had chosen not to buy it, for the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, only because it was too fragile and difficult to transport. &quot;Nuage articulé&quot; was published later in a more political context in the Surrealist magazine &quot;London Bulletin&quot;, together with a text by André Breton translated by Samuel Beckett with a comment that the sponge-umbrella would bring to mind another, sadly prominent, umbrella – that of Neville Chamberlain at the 1938 Munich Conference and the failure of the British policy of appeasement. Besides &quot;Nuage articulé&quot;, of which two versions are known and preserved In addition to &quot;Nuage articulé&quot;, Paalen presented other objects in the 1938 surrealist exhibition, such as: &quot;Potence avec paratonnerre&quot; (Gallows with Lightning Rod), a larger-than-life wooden gibbet with lightning rods and a dedication plaque to the German philosopher and experimental physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg; &quot;Le moi et le soi&quot; (The Ego and the Id); and a version of &quot;Chaise envahie de lierre&quot;. Perhaps inspired by the revolving doors used as movable walls for paintings and metaphorically called portes ‘revolver’ in the surrealist exhibition, Paalen designed a pistol shape from different small animal bones, which he fastened to a box with a tray and glass lid lined with black velvet. As in museum displays of valuable paleontological discoveries, he included its title on a copper plate inscribed ‘Le génie de l&#x27;espèce’ (The Genius, or Engineering, of the Species).

===The paintings of 1938–39 and plans for Mexico===
1938 he showed his new fumage paintings, which made his reputation as painter, in a show in &quot;Renou et Colle&quot; Gallery in Paris, with a catalogue text by Breton, written in Bermuda on his trip to Mexico. He published also the Lichtenberg-text &quot;Göttinger Taschenalmanach&quot; in surrealist magazine &quot;Minotaure&quot; with illustrations by him. In 1938 the Paalens socialised with Frida Kahlo during her visit in Paris. She invited the couple to Mexico, where Paalen wanted to organize a Surrealist exhibition together with Breton. It was Marcel Duchamp who recommended Paalen to Peggy Guggenheim and the New York dealer Julien Levy. &quot;Dear Julien, P. S. to my recent letter: Do you know Paalen&#x27;s work? I suppose that you have seen some reproductions. Among the young Surr[ealists]&#x27;s he ought to come out – he paints scenes &quot;for&quot; a sorcerer (you never see the witches). All this to hope that you might show him in N.Y&quot;, Duchamp had already written to Levy in January 1939; in March he added a note about the invitation to the Guggenheim show: “In London with Mary [Reynolds] for a few days – Just came to see the last day of Paalen&#x27;s show – His &quot;sorcelleries&quot; look real on the walls – Hope you try them in N.Y.&quot; After his one-man-show at the Guggenheim Jeune Gallery in Cork Street, London, as the first of the surrealists, he decided to leave Europe and travelled first to New York in May 1939 together with his wife Alice and friend Eva Sulzer. The same year he traveled through British Columbia where he collected a major totem house-screen with the representation of a bear-woman, accessible through a hole in the womb (now in the Denver Art Museum). His literary text &quot;Paysage totémique&quot;, later published in his magazine &quot;DYN&quot;, originates from the travel-notebooks, films and photographs of this voyage. In September he arrived in Mexico, where Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo accompanied him to a house in Coyoacán, next to Kahlo&#x27;s &quot;Casa Azul&quot; (The Blue House), which they had rented for him.

===The first years of exile in Mexico===
In autumn 1939 he organized the International Surrealist Exhibition in the Galería de Arte Mexicano together with the Peruvian poet César Moro, which opened in January 1940 in the new gallery rooms of Ines Amor. In April 1940 he showed his great Fumages and new experimental work, close to abstraction, in New York at Julien Levy gallery with great success. Reporters witness that Paalen at a certain point switched out the light and walked around with a burning candle during the opening, gathered by young American painters such as Jackson Pollock, Adolph Gottlieb, Robert Motherwell, William Baziotes and Gerome Kamrowski. Neither in Mexico, nor in New York he came in contact to Leon Trotsky or his assistant Jean van Heijenoort (who then was living in New York), albeit the commendatory letter, Breton had written already in Paris, hoping that Paalen would continue the contact, he had established during his trip to Mexico in 1938. Paalen justified his refusal in a letter to Breton with his general critique on the pseudo-religious paternal fixations of the Surrealists who, in his opinion, didn&#x27;t dispose of the means to find other ways out of the spiritual hole, the crisis of Marxism has left in their minds, than to look for new political fathers. Back in Mexico he broke up with his former friends Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo across political opinions concerning their hard line in communism after the assassination of Leon Trotsky and their return to an open adoration of Joseph Stalin. More and more isolated from the Mexican intellectual leftists, he held an open household for European and American visitors, such as Roberto Matta, Robert Motherwell, Gordon Onslow Ford, Benjamin Péret, Remedios Varo, Esteban Francés as well as refugees from the stalinist terror, like Gustav Regler and Victor Serge. He helped to organize immigration visas for the surrealists in Vichy-France through the &quot;Union Mexico-Francia&quot; and Julien Levy. During his first period of exile, Paalen concentrated on the verbalization of his ideas on art and, apart from occasional visits to New York, experimented secretly, in his studio in San Ángel, in a new style on pictorial space.

== The war years ==

===&quot;DYN&quot;===

In the spring of 1942 the New York art world witnessed the result of Paalen&#x27;s intense work in the first years of exile in Mexico – the art journal &quot;DYN&quot; (derived from the Greek &quot;κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν&quot; – &quot;that which is possible&quot;). In its first issue he publicly announced to his friend Breton his &quot;Farewell to Surrealism&quot;. In the second issue he scandalised his former advocate again by publishing a survey on Dialectical Materialism and an article with the provocative title &quot;The dialectical Gospel&quot;, which caused a scandal among the New York Surrealists. The art historian Meyer Schapiro then organized a symposium on dialectical materialism, with the Surrealists in Breton&#x27;s apartment in New York, which revealed nothing but the inadequate knowledge of the artists on this field. In DYN Paalen theoretically hedged his concept of possibility on various levels, with quantum theory, with his own concept of totemism, gestalt theory, with his criticisms of dialectical materialism and western dualistic concepts, with his analysis of cave painting, and so on. By means of his journal, with a total of five issues published in Mexico between 1942 and 1944, he temporarily advanced to be one of the most influential art theorists in the wartime period. Even Breton admitted in 1944 that Paalen&#x27;s criticism of Surrealism was justified and that &quot;we (the Surrealists) have left the whole licence to Paalen, who could say whatever he liked, without having the means to say something against or at least put something at his level. Paalen is winning on the whole line.&quot;

In seven large essays and countless smaller articles and reviews he discussed in detail the topical concerns of the young New York artists and, in response, received their full attention. Also his long article &quot;Totem Art&quot; had considerable influence on such artists, as Martha Graham, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman, mainly because of the new conception of considering totemistic art as part of ecstatic action and ritual with its psychic links to generic memory and matrilinear ancestor-worship. With the exception of &quot;Totem Art&quot;, all essays are republished under the title &quot;Form and Sense&quot; by Robert Motherwell in New York as the first issue of the series of writings titled &quot;Problems of Contemporary Art&quot; in which also the first papers of the later Abstract Expressionists, like &quot;Possibilities&quot;, were published. Paalen&#x27;s short sojourns in New York and the two solo exhibitions made him known as a painter in artist&#x27;s circles, however his predominant absence from the New York art scene and the wide reception of &quot;DYN&quot; and &quot;Form and Sense&quot; fostered his image as a kind of intellectual secret agent primarily exerting indirect influence on the events through his intensely discussed ideas.

In a note with the title &quot;America has a new art movement (the first authentic art movement here)&quot; Barnett Newman listed Paalen together with Pollock, Rothko, Hoffman, Gorky, Baziotes and Motherwell as &quot;The men in the new art movement&quot;; Motherwell appears with a question mark, while Paalen is listed twice, once with the adding &quot;New&quot; (probably dividing Paalen&#x27;s surrealist from his DYN-works).

The German art historian Andreas Neufert, who has extensively explored Paalen&#x27;s life and work, suggested in his 2015 biography on the artist, that &quot;DYN&quot; and the New York surrealist journal &quot;VVV&quot; were widely inspired by each other and can be seen partly as a hidden correspondence between Breton and Paalen. This assumption has been already denoted (but not fully explored) by Yve-Alain Bois in 2004 in his contribution &quot;1942a – The depoliticization of the American avant-garde...&quot;

===The new concept of space in painting===

It was in the 1940s that Paalen&#x27;s art particularly played a major role in changing the conception of abstract art. Due to his magazine DYN, his presence and exhibitions in New York City, 1940 Julien Levy, 1945 Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s The Art of This Century gallery and 1946 Galerie Nierendorf in Berlin, he influenced significantly the genesis of Abstract Expressionism. Paintings such as &quot;Les premiers spaciales&quot; of 1941 set entirely on the new pictorial space because they concentrate on pictorially immanent means: Rhythm, light and colour. Important is that they transform the rhythmical appearance of the fumage imprints into a neo-cubist rhythm, which Paalen then compares with the fugue and jazz, through a mosaic-like fracture and complementary contrasts. He wants to create the atmosphere of a deeply moving, gripping encounter with beings that themselves remain silent. There is no action, no metamorphosis in them and nothing happens with them in the space. The picture itself is the being, or a frozen resonance of it. Precisely because of this total silence, every topical expectation put to them is reflected as a question. In a cartoon published by Ad Reinhardt in the fifties, Paalen&#x27;s suggestion from &quot;Form and Sense&quot; is repeated: &quot;Paintings no longer represent; it is no longer the task of art to answer naive questions. Today it has become the role of the painting to look at the spectator and ask him: what do you represent?&quot; Gustav Regler wrote 1946 about this groundbreaking idea: 

Paalen understood his &quot;picture beings&quot; as a kind of pictorial version of the ancient &quot;choros tragicos&quot;, the tragic chorus effect, conceived in Nietzsche&#x27;s writing on &quot;The Birth of Tragedy.&quot; It is the deep existential foundation of reality, what he is interested in. Although it becomes common practice after 1947, until this time, nobody had placed so much responsibility on the viewer as Paalen did with his rhetoric and pictorial language.

== After the war ==

===Archeological passions===
1946 he divorced Alice and married the Venezuelan designer and artist Luchita Hurtado, whom he had met in New York through his friend Isamu Noguchi. Hurtado moved to Mexico in 1947 to live with Paalen and together they explored the ancient culture of the Olmec, about which Paalen later published a widely respected article in the French art magazine &quot;Cahiers d&#x27;art&quot;. Paalen radicalizes the assumption of his friend and colleague Miguel Covarrubias, that the Olmecs were a culture succumbed and (after hundreds of war-years) finally wiped out by the aggressive Maya civilization, comparing the Olmecs to the ancient European matrilinear civilizations, which underlay invasive and more aggressive patriarchal civilizations some 3000 years ago. Paalen&#x27;s thesis about the matrilinear social-structure of the ancient societies of Mesoamerica, which he documented with considerable support from his own research, was never substantially challenged and strongly influenced such artists as Alice Rahon, Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington in their archaist and feminist themes. His ideas still live on in the archaeological and artistic discourses, the most prominent popular example of recent times being Mel Gibson&#x27;s cinematic opus &quot;Apocalypto&quot;).

===San Francisco, Paris===
In 1948, one of the two children from Luchita&#x27;s former marriage died in Mexico of Polio. Paalen decided to move to San Francisco with his new family, where he worked with Gordon Onslow Ford and Lee Mullican in a newly formed association, the Dynaton group. They settled in Mill Valley and had solo shows in the San Francisco Museum of Art as well as a group show at Stanford University Art Gallery, where he also lectured parts from the major essay on his new concept of space, he had worked on the last years. It was published in occasion of the DYNATON exhibition in San Francisco Museum of Art in 1951 as a catalogue. Paalen&#x27;s ongoing desire to go back to Mexico and rebuilt the link to Breton in Paris led to a divorce from Luchita, who decided to live with Lee Mullican.

Back in Mexico Paalen organized 1951 a longer stay in Paris. Together with his new fiancée, the American painter Marie Wilson, Paalen lived for the next 3 years in Kurt Seligmann&#x27;s atelier-building in the Impasse Villa Seurat in Paris, built by André Lurçat. He reconciled with Breton, spent most of the summers in Breton&#x27;s house in Saint Cirq La Popie, participated at the invention of various surrealist games, like &quot;Ouvrez-Vous?&quot; and &quot;L’un dans l’autre&quot; and painted a considerable corpus of lyrical-abstract paintings, which were exhibited at Galerie Pierre (1953) and Galerie Galanis-Hentschel (1954). One of the four numbers of Breton&#x27;s magazine &quot;Medium – Communication Surréaliste&quot; is dedicated to Paalen. After travelling through Germany in the summer of 1954 he went back again to Mexico.

===Last years in Mexico and suicide===
Paalen&#x27;s last years in Mexico were characterized by increasing health problems, mainly originated in his bipolar (manic-depressive) disposition. With the help of his friends and patrons Eva Sulzer and Gordon Onslow Ford he acquired an old house with studio in the small town Tepoztlán in Morelos, where he mainly lived and worked during the last years of his life. Paradoxically Paalen produced a number of masterly works towards the end of this last period, as well as theatre plays and short stories, which reflect his ambivalent state of mind and growing depressions. His passion for Olmec sculpture and artefacts implicated him into adventurous expeditions into the wilderness of Yucatán, collecting and trading pre-Columbian art to an always growing US market. Rumours of Paalen having been involved in illegal looting of archaeological sites in Yucatán inspired the American author and theologian Arthur A. Cohen to his novel &quot;Acts of Theft&quot; (1980). As expert and inspirator Wolfgang Paalen assisted the American filmmaker Albert Lewin for his film The Living Idol. 1958 he received André Pieyre de Mandiargues and Octavio Paz in Tepoztlán, who both wrote texts on Paalen after his suicide. In the night of September 25, 1959 Paalen left his hotel room in the Hacienda San Francisco Cuadra in Taxco, where he sometimes stayed during his depressions, and walked up the hill. The following day he was found dead with a gunshot to his head.

== Poet and writer ==
Although Paalen is known chiefly as a visual artist, he also wrote poetry in French and German, which he shared with Valentine Penrose, Alice Rahon, André Breton and Paul Éluard. 1941 Breton reacted euphorically to Paalen&#x27;s poetical diary of his voyage to British Columbia in the summer of 1939: &quot;I have read &quot;Paysage totémique&quot;, re-read, read in a loud voice, nothing is more adorable, indubitably genial&quot;. &quot;Paysage totémique&quot; was partly published in his magazine &quot;DYN&quot;. He also wrote three theatre plays and various unpublished stories, such as &quot;Der Axolotl&quot;, &quot;Paloma Palomita&quot;; his play &quot;The Beam of the Balance&quot;, a tragic-comedy, reflects the unbroken power of Stalin&#x27;s totalitarian terror-regime, the release of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and the danger of the unbalanced scientific human mind in general. It was first read publicly in the house of Robert Motherwell in East Hampton in 1946. His play &quot;Elorn, A Ballad from Brittany&quot; reflects his lifelong passion with pre-Celtic matrilinear cultures.

== Legacy ==
The complete works of Paalen, canvases, objects and sculptures, were catalogued by art historian Andreas Neufert in his 1999 book &quot;Wolfgang Paalen: Im Inneren des Wals: Monography, and Catalogue Raisonné&quot;. Paalen&#x27;s estate in Mexico, including papers and photographs, was donated by the heirs of Isabel Marin de Paalen to the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City. The estate which Paalen left in the care of his close friend, the surrealist painter Gordon Onslow Ford, is administrated by the Lucid Art Foundation in Inverness, California, which recently restituted Paalen&#x27;s rich archive of papers, photographs and manuscripts to the heirs of Eva Sulzer, Paalen&#x27;s only heir and executor.

Between May and July 2007 a collection of his work was exhibited at the Frey Norris gallery in San Francisco. In 2014 the Wendi Norris Gallery, also in San Francisco, exhibited major works in the solo-retrospective &quot;Wolfgang Paalen, Philosopher of the Possible&quot;.

Paalen&#x27;s collected essays on art from &quot;DYN&quot;, &quot;Form and Sense&quot;, were re-published in 2013 by Deborah Rosenthal with a foreword by Martica Sawin.

2019 the Belvedere, Vienna honored Wolfgang Paalen with a retrospective exhibition, curated by Andreas Neufert and Franz Smola, which opened October 3 and ran through January 19th with remarkable success. An English edition of the catalogue is available through Koenig Books.

The biography of Wolfgang Paalen, published 2015 in German under the title &quot;Auf Liebe und Tod&quot; is currently published in two volumes in English. The first volume has been available since November 2022 under the title &quot;Paalen Life and Work, I. Forbidden Land: The Early and Crucial Years 1905- 1939&quot;.

==Art market==
Paalen&#x27;s relatively small oeuvre of roughly 300 canvases, a few objects and some sculptures was mostly traded privately and through specialized galleries in the past. Only minor works appear from time to time in public auctions, as most of the major works are in museums or well-established private collections. In 2009 however, Christie&#x27;s auctioned Paalen&#x27;s important 1938 surrealist fumage painting &quot;Paysage (Pays) médusé&quot; (oil and smoke on canvas). Estimated at €30–40,000, the realised price was €373,000 (ca US$561,000), setting a new record for the highest price paid at auction for this artist. In November 2015 Wolfgang Paalen&#x27;s painting &quot;Les Cosmogones&quot; sold for 382.000.- US$ in the Latin American Art auction at Sotheby&#x27;s New York&#x27;s. In July 2020 the German auction house Villa Grisebach in Berlin sold Wolfgang Paalen&#x27;s early programmatic painting &quot;Avertissement I (Peinture), 1935&quot; for €387.500.-, setting a new world record price for this artist. In February 2023, two paintings by Paalen from the Surrealist period set new world records for the artist in the traditional auction &quot;Art of the Surreal&quot; at Christies London: &quot;Taches solaires&quot; (1938) with a result of 756,000 pounds sterling and Pays interdit (1936–37) with a result of £504,000.

<text>The gayal (Bos frontalis), also known as the Drung ox or mithun, is a large domestic cattle distributed in Northeast India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and in Yunnan, China.

== Taxonomy ==
In his first description of 1804, Aylmer Bourke Lambert applied the binomial &quot;Bos frontalis&quot; to a domestic specimen probably from Chittagong.

In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the first available specific name based on a wild population that the name for this wild species is valid by virtue of its being antedated by a name based on a domestic form. Most authors have adopted the binomial &quot;Bos frontalis&quot; for the domestic species as valid for the taxon.

Phylogenetic analysis corroborates the taxonomic assessment that the gayal is an independent &quot;Bos&quot; species originating matrilineally from gaur, zebu and cattle.

==Characteristics==
The gayal differs in several important particulars from the gaur:
* It is somewhat smaller, with proportionately shorter limbs, and stands much lower at the withers.
* The ridge on the back is less developed, and bulls have a larger dewlap on the throat.
* The head is shorter and broader, with a perfectly flat forehead and a straight line between the bases of the horns.
* The thick and massive horns are less flattened and much less curved than in the gaur, extending almost directly outwards from the sides of the head, and curving somewhat upwards at the tips, but without any inward inclination. Their extremities are thus much farther apart than in the gaur.
* The female gayal is much smaller than the bull, and has scarcely any dewlap on the throat.
* The skin colour of the head and body is blackish-brown in both sexes, and the lower portion of the limbs are white or yellowish.
* The horns are of uniform blackish tint from base to tip.
Some domesticated gayals are parti-coloured, while others are completely white.

There are two major hypotheses on the origin of the gayal:
* It was domesticated from wild gaur;
* It is a hybrid descendant from crossing of wild gaur and domestic cattle, either &quot;Bos indicus&quot; or &quot;Bos taurus&quot;.

In 2020, Ranganathan Kamalakkannan et Al. found &quot;phylogenetic analysis using complete mitochondrial genome sequences unambiguously suggested that gaur is the maternal ancestor of domestic mithun.&quot;

Analysis of the genome of the gayal was published in 2017.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Gayals are essentially inhabitants of hill-forests. In India, semi-domesticated gayals are kept by several ethnic groups living in the hills of Tripura, Mizoram, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland. They also occur in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. In northern Burma, they occur in the Kachin State, and in adjacent Yunnan are found only in the Trung () and Salween River basins.

The role of the mithun is central to the lives of many residents of these areas, including transhumant ones who pair mithun management with sago palm harvesting:
In Nagaland, the animals are kept semi-wild, and live in herds, being watched over by special caretakers assigned by the villages or the owner of the herd. They respond to a horn kept specially for the individual caretaker or actual owner to call them. From birth until the time of butchering or market, the Mithun remain in the herd, and roam mostly freely throughout the forests.

== In culture ==
To the Idu Mishmi, Nyishi people or Adi people (Bangni-Booker Lhobas incl pasi, padam, minyong, Galong now Galo), the possession of gayal is the traditional measure of a family&#x27;s wealth. Gayal are not milked or put to work but given supplementary care while grazing in the woods, until they are ritually slaughtered or killed for local consumption. Mithuns are wild and each family has a very indigenous marking as a cut on the ear.

The gayal is the state animal of Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. Gayals play an important role in the social life of the people in Arunachal Pradesh. Marriages are not fixed until the bridegroom&#x27;s family gives at least one gayal to the bride&#x27;s household.

Gayals are left in the forest, where they usually stay within a small perimeter. Females are usually aggressive when with calves, and there are instances known when people have been severely injured after being gored by one. Males are usually more docile.

In Mizoram and Manipur, it is called Sial, Siel, Se/Sia amongst the tribes of the Chin-Kuki-Mizo. It is the most essential and valuable commodity; the wealth of a person is often counted by the number of gayals. It is the sole animal used for sacrificial purposes and feast of merit. The tribes regard a human to be honourable if and when he holds a community feast of one or more gayal on one or more occasions.
== National Research Centre on Mithun ==
The National Research Centre on Mithun was established at Medziphema in the Chümoukedima District of Nagaland under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

The mandate of the institute was redefined in 1997 and 2006. Currently, the National Research Centre on Mithun is functioning for developing the scientific and sustainable mithun rearing system and for catering the needs of mithun farmers with the following mandates:
* Identification, evaluation and characterization of mithun germplasm available in the country.
* Conservation and improvement of mithun for meat and milk.
* Act as a repository of germplasm and information centre on mithun.

Faris bin Ahmed bin Jam&#x27;an bin Ali Aal Shuwayl al-Hassani al-Zahrani al-Azdi (1977 – ; ) was a terrorist who was on Saudi Arabia&#x27;s list of 26 &#x27;most-wanted&#x27; suspected terrorists.

.He was a part of Al-Qaeda. He was known for conducting research which showed Al-Qaeda in a positive light. His prominence rose especially after the killing of Abdel Aziz al-Muqrin the leader of Al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia. He made a post denouncing his Saudi Arabian citizenship under the assumption of the state apostatizing from Islam. 

He was arrested in early August 2004. On 2 January 2016, al-Zahrani was executed by the Saudi state along with 46 others convicted of terrorism.

==Life==
Fares bin Ahmad al-Zahrani was born in 1977 in al-Jawfa’ village in Bilad Zahran in the Al-Baha region of Saudi Arabia. His family later moved to a nearby village known as al-Nu’us. Where Fares would attend and graduate elementary school. Later he would attend and graduate high school in the same village in 1996, receiving high grades. Information on where Fares went to college differs depending on the source.

He was said to have attended the Kulliyat ‘Ulum al-Quran in al-Madina, for one semester, and the University of King Khaled in Abha (from which he got a BA in 2000).

There is no clear date when Fares al-Zahrani became a terrorist wanted by the Saudi authorities. What is known is that he started writing under two identities online after a series of deadly clashes between the Saudi government and Jihadis in 2003. In November a list of 26 suspected terrorists was released with al-Zahrani&#x27;s name on it.

Fares al-Zahrani was active online under two names: al-Mutaharek and Abu Jandal al-Azadi (a pen name derived from his Azd tribal heritage that he digitally published some of his earlier books under). Among the message boards Fares was active in was &quot;Minbar al-Jihad wa-al-Tawhid&quot;, a popular message board dealing with Jihad-related issues. The same blog later interviewed him, in the only known interview he&#x27;s ever given.

Al-Zahrani&#x27;s first noteworthy book was &quot;al-Baheth ‘Ann Hikm Qatl Afrad wa-Dubat al-Mabaheth&quot; (English: For Those Who are Looking for the Rule to Kill Police Officers). It was released after a series of deadly confrontations with the Saudi police, and came as the product of many online arguments on Jihadi blogs. It contained an attempt to find religious approval for killing police officers. al-Zahrani was able to make the links between the Quran, Hadith, and various militant thinkers (namely Sayyid Qutb and Abu Qatada) to justify the act of murder. al-Zahrani&#x27;s second book on a similar topic, &quot;Tahrid al-Mujahidin al-Abtal Ala Ihya’ Sinat al-Ightiyal&quot; (English: Encouraging the Hero Mujahidin to Revive the Sanctioned Practice: Assassination) again provided religious Fatwa for killing others.

In addition to his writings, Fares al-Zahrani posted many audio recordings, the most known being &quot;Your citizenship is under my feet&quot;, a speech denouncing his Saudi citizenship because the Ummah did not recognize any modern borders or nationalities. It was quoted in 2014 by Saudi fighters in the ranks of the Islamic State when they tore up and burned their Saudi Passports in a famous video.

==Arrest==
He was arrested in Abha by Saudi police on 5 August 2004 on charges of terrorism. His capture was considered a serious blow to Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia.

Four weeks prior to his arrest, al-Zahrani wrote an article in which he said he was evading the Saudi crackdown. Several weeks before the arrest in an interview with the online publication Voice of Jihad, al-Zahrani said: &quot;I would like to reassure the people who love me...I am careful in my movements and contacts, and I take all necessary precautions.&quot; In the same statement, al-Zahrani rejected an amnesty that King Fahd had offered militants in June.

Al-Zahrani and another man were arrested without incident, even though both were armed.

<text>In accounting and economics, fixed costs, also known as indirect costs or overhead costs, are business expenses that are not dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the business. They tend to be recurring, such as interest or rents being paid per month. These costs also tend to be capital costs. This is in contrast to variable costs, which are volume-related (and are paid per quantity produced) and unknown at the beginning of the accounting year. Fixed costs have an effect on the nature of certain variable costs.

For example, a retailer must pay rent and utility bills irrespective of sales. As another example, for a bakery the monthly rent and phone line are fixed costs, irrespective of how much bread is produced and sold; on the other hand, the wages are variable costs, as more workers would need to be hired for the production to increase. For any factory, the fix cost should be all the money paid on capitals and land. Such fixed costs as buying machines and land cannot be not changed no matter how much they produce or even not produce. Raw materials are one of the variable costs, depending on the quantity produced.

Fixed costs are considered an entry barrier for new entrepreneurs. In marketing, it is necessary to know how costs divide between variable and fixed costs. This distinction is crucial in forecasting the earnings generated by various changes in unit sales and thus the financial impact of proposed marketing campaigns. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 60 percent responded that they found the &quot;variable and fixed costs&quot; metric very useful. These costs affect each other and are both extremely important to entrepreneurs. 

In economics, there is a fixed cost for a factory in the short run, and the fixed cost is immutable. But in the long run, there are only variable costs, because they control all factors of production.

==Description==
Fixed costs are not permanently fixed; they will change over time, but are fixed, by contractual obligation, in relation to the quantity of production for the relevant period. In other words, there is a recurring cost, but the value of this cost is not permanently fixed. For example, a company may have unexpected and unpredictable expenses unrelated to production, such as warehouse costs and the like that are fixed only over the time period of the lease. By definition, there are no fixed costs in the long run, because the long run is a sufficient period of time for all short-run fixed inputs to become variable. Investments in facilities, equipment, and the basic organization that cannot be significantly reduced in a short period of time are referred to as committed fixed costs. Discretionary fixed costs usually arise from annual decisions by management to spend on certain fixed cost items. Examples of discretionary costs are advertising, insurance premia, machine maintenance, and research &amp; development expenditures. Discretionary fixed costs can be expensive.

In economics, the most commonly spoken about fixed costs are those that have to do with capital. Capital can be the fixed price for buying a warehouse for production, machines (which can be paid once at the beginning and not depend on quantity or time of production), and it can be a certain total for the salaries of a certain quantity of unskilled labor. Many things are included in fixed costs depending on the product and market - some firms may decide to hold some resources at fixed rates that other companies may not - but these unexpected or predictable short term fixed costs can be the reason a firm doesn&#x27;t enter the market (if the costs are too high). These costs and variable costs have to be taken into account when a firm wants to determine if they can enter a market.

In business planning and management accounting, usage of the terms fixed costs, variable costs and others will often differ from usage in economics, and may depend on the context. Some cost accounting practices such as activity-based costing will allocate fixed costs to business activities for profitability measures. This can simplify decision-making, but can be confusing and controversial. In accounting terminology, fixed costs will broadly include almost all costs (expenses) which are not included in cost of goods sold, and variable costs are those captured in costs of goods sold under the variable costing method. Under full (absorption) costing fixed costs will be included in both the cost of goods sold and in the operating expenses. The implicit assumption required to make the equivalence between the accounting and economics terminology is that the accounting period is equal to the period in which fixed costs do not vary in relation to production. In practice, this equivalence does not always hold, and depending on the period under consideration by management, some overhead expenses (e.g., sales, general and administrative expenses) can be adjusted by management, and the specific allocation of each expense to each category will be decided under cost accounting. In recent years, fixed costs gradually exceed variable costs for many companies. There are two reasons. Firstly, automatic production increases the cost of investment equipment, including the depreciation and maintenance of old equipment. Secondly, labor costs are often considered as long-term costs. It is difficult to adjust human resources according to the actual work needs in short term. As a result, direct labor costs are now regarded as fixed costs.

<doc id="886535" wikidata="Q138912" url="?curid=886535" title="Podocyte">
<text>Podocytes are cells in Bowman&#x27;s capsule in the kidneys that wrap around capillaries of the glomerulus. Podocytes make up the epithelial lining of Bowman&#x27;s capsule, the third layer through which filtration of blood takes place. Bowman&#x27;s capsule filters the blood, retaining large molecules such as proteins while smaller molecules such as water, salts, and sugars are filtered as the first step in the formation of urine. Although various viscera have epithelial layers, the name visceral epithelial cells usually refers specifically to podocytes, which are specialized epithelial cells that reside in the visceral layer of the capsule.

 The podocytes have long primary processes called &quot;trabeculae&quot; that form secondary processes known as &quot;pedicels&quot; or foot processes (for which the cells are named &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;). The pedicels wrap around the capillaries and leave slits between them. Blood is filtered through these slits, each known as a filtration slit, slit diaphragm, or slit pore. Several proteins are required for the pedicels to wrap around the capillaries and function. When infants are born with certain defects in these proteins, such as nephrin and CD2AP, their kidneys cannot function. People have variations in these proteins, and some variations may predispose them to kidney failure later in life. Nephrin is a zipper-like protein that forms the slit diaphragm, with spaces between the teeth of the zipper big enough to allow sugar and water through but too small to allow proteins through. Nephrin defects are responsible for congenital kidney failure. CD2AP regulates the podocyte cytoskeleton and stabilizes the slit diaphragm.

== Structure ==

A podocyte has a complex structure. Its cell body has extending major or primary processes that form secondary processes as podocyte foot processes or pedicels. The primary processes are held by microtubules and intermediate filaments. The foot processes have an actin-based cytoskeleton. Podocytes are found lining the Bowman&#x27;s capsules in the nephrons of the kidney. The pedicels or foot processes wrap around the glomerular capillaries to form the filtration slits. The pedicels increase the surface area of the cells enabling efficient ultrafiltration. 

Podocytes secrete and maintain the basement membrane.

There are numerous coated vesicles and coated pits along the basolateral domain of the podocytes which indicate a high rate of vesicular traffic.

Podocytes possess a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum and a large Golgi apparatus, indicative of a high capacity for protein synthesis and post-translational modifications.

There is also growing evidence of a large number of multivesicular bodies and other lysosomal components seen in these cells, indicating a high endocytic activity.

===Energy needs===
Podocytes require a significant amount of energy to preserve the structural integrity of their foot processes, given the substantial mechanical stress they endure during the glomerular filtration process.

Dynamic changes in glomerular capillary pressure exert both tensile and stretching forces on podocyte foot processes, and can lead to mechanical strain on their cytoskeleton. Concurrently, fluid flow shear stress is generated by the movement of glomerular ultrafiltrate, exerting a tangential force on the surface of these foot processes.

In order to preserve their intricate foot process architecture, podocytes require a substantial ATP expenditure to maintain their structure and cytoskeletal organization, counteract the elevated glomerular capillary pressure and stabilize the capillary wall.

== Function ==

Podocytes have primary processes called trabeculae, which wrap around the glomerular capillaries. The trabeculae in turn have secondary processes called pedicels or foot processes. Pedicels interdigitate, thereby giving rise to thin gaps called filtration slits. The slits are covered by slit diaphragms which are composed of a number of cell-surface proteins including nephrin, podocalyxin, and P-cadherin, which restrict the passage of large macromolecules such as serum albumin and gamma globulin and ensure that they remain in the bloodstream. Proteins that are required for the correct function of the slit diaphragm include nephrin, NEPH1, NEPH2, podocin, CD2AP. and FAT1.

Small molecules such as water, glucose, and ionic salts are able to pass through the filtration slits and form an ultrafiltrate in the tubular fluid, which is further processed by the nephron to produce urine.

Podocytes are also involved in regulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). When podocytes contract, they cause closure of filtration slits. This decreases the GFR by reducing the surface area available for filtration.

==Clinical significance==
A loss of the foot processes of the podocytes (i.e., podocyte effacement) is a hallmark of minimal change disease, which has therefore sometimes been called foot process disease.

Disruption of the filtration slits or destruction of the podocytes can lead to massive proteinuria, where large amounts of protein are lost from the blood.

An example of this occurs in the congenital disorder Finnish-type nephrosis, which is characterised by neonatal proteinuria leading to end-stage kidney failure. This disease has been found to be caused by a mutation in the nephrin gene.

In 2002 Professor Moin Saleem at the University of Bristol made the first conditionally immortalised human podocyte cell line. This meant that podocytes could be grown and studied in the lab. Since then many discoveries have been made. Nephrotic syndrome occurs when there is a breakdown of the glomerular filtration barrier. The podocytes form one layer of the filtration barrier. Genetic mutations can cause podocyte dysfunction leading to an inability of the filtration barrier to restrict urinary protein loss. There are currently 53 genes known to play a role in genetic nephrotic syndrome. In idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, there is no known genetic mutation. It is thought to be caused by a hitherto unknown circulating permeability factor. Recent evidence suggests that the factor could be released by T-cells or B-cells, podocyte cell lines can be treated with plasma from patients with nephrotic syndrome to understand the specific responses of the podocyte to the circulating factor. There is growing evidence that the circulating factor could be signalling to the podocyte via the PAR-1 receptor.

Presence of podocytes in urine has been proposed as an early diagnostic marker for preeclampsia.

<doc id="886560" wikidata="Q1473878" url="?curid=886560" title="No Way Out (1987 film)">
<text>No Way Out is a 1987 American neo-noir thriller film directed by Roger Donaldson and starring Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman, Will Patton, and Sean Young. Howard Duff, George Dzundza, Jason Bernard, Fred Thompson, and Iman appear in supporting roles. The film is based on the 1946 novel &quot;The Big Clock&quot; by Kenneth Fearing, previously filmed as &quot;The Big Clock&quot; (1948) and &quot;Police Python 357&quot; (1976).

==Plot==
In a house near the Pentagon, Lieutenant Commander Tom Farrell of the Office of Naval Intelligence is under interrogation, asked how he came to meet Secretary of Defense David Brice.

Six months earlier, Farrell is invited to an inaugural ball by his college friend Scott Pritchard, who introduces him to his boss, Secretary Brice. Farrell meets Susan Atwell, and they begin an affair just before he ships out for the Philippines. After Farrell risks his life to save a shipmate at sea, Brice hires him to act as his eyes and ears within the CIA. Returning to Washington, D.C. for his new post, Farrell reunites with his old landlord, and his friend Sam Hesselman, who works in the Pentagon&#x27;s new computer center.

Atwell and Farrell&#x27;s affair continues, even after she reveals she is also Brice&#x27;s mistress. Just as Tom and Susan return from a romantic weekend, Brice visits unexpectedly, forcing Farrell to slip away. Suspicious that Atwell has another lover, an enraged Brice accidentally pushes her over an upstairs railing to her death. He goes to Pritchard, who removes all evidence of Brice from Atwell&#x27;s apartment and discovers an indiscernible negative of a Polaroid photograph she took of Farrell.

Pritchard suggests that Atwell&#x27;s other lover could be conflated with a long-rumored KGB sleeper agent code-named &quot;Yuri&quot;, who could be implicated in her death and killed by Pritchard&#x27;s operatives, clearing Brice from suspicion. Army CID Officers search Atwell&#x27;s apartment, and Pritchard plants the photo negative among the evidence, which Hesselman attempts to have enhanced by computer, a process that may take days.

Realizing that Brice killed Atwell and Pritchard is covering up the evidence, Farrell assists the bogus investigation, aware that the physical evidence makes himself the prime suspect. He and Pritchard question Atwell&#x27;s friend Nina, who pretends not to recognize Farrell but reveals that she knew Atwell was seeing Brice. Pritchard sends two assassins to eliminate her, but Farrell intervenes and warns Nina.

Searching for real evidence to implicate Brice, Farrell investigates a jewel box from Morocco that Brice gave Atwell; as foreign gifts must be registered with the State Department, Farrell has Hesselman &quot;raid&quot; the computerized registry. He later convinces Hesselman to delay the photo enhancement by confiding to him that he is the person in the photo, that he was in love with Atwell, and that Brice killed her.

Credit card statements lead the CID to two witnesses who can identify Atwell&#x27;s mystery lover; one of them spots Farrell at a distance, confirming to the investigators that Yuri is inside the Pentagon, and a room-by-room search begins. Farrell informs Hesselman of Brice&#x27;s guilt and the incriminating gift and eludes the search by climbing into a ceiling vent. Concerned, Hesselman tells Pritchard of Farrell&#x27;s suspicions and his relationship with Atwell, and Pritchard shoots him dead.

Pursued by Pritchard&#x27;s assassins, Farrell reaches Brice&#x27;s office and confronts him with a printout of the gift registry. Pritchard prepares to implicate Farrell as Yuri for Atwell&#x27;s and Hesselman&#x27;s deaths, but Brice improvises a different story to buy Farrell&#x27;s silence: that Pritchard, who is infatuated with Brice, killed Atwell out of jealousy. Devastated and betrayed, Pritchard shoots himself, and Brice tells the investigators that Pritchard is Yuri, concluding the search. Farrell sends the printout to the Director of the CIA, Brice&#x27;s political rival, and leaves as the finished photograph reveals him as Atwell&#x27;s lover.

Sitting at Atwell&#x27;s grave, Farrell is picked up by a pair of operatives and interrogated at the house. He is confronted by his landlord, revealed to be his handler – they are all Soviet agents, and Farrell actually is &quot;Yuri&quot;, a deep-cover spy raised as an American from a young age to serve as a high-level mole. Having fulfilled his mission, Farrell is offered a chance to return to the Soviet Union, but he refuses, saying that they cannot make him go back. His handler allows him to depart, stating he will eventually return, and Farrell drives away.

Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;truly labyrinthine and ingenious.&quot; Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;Viewers who arrive at the movie five minutes late and leave five minutes early will avoid the setup and payoff for the preposterous twist that spoils this lively, intelligent remake of 1948&#x27;s &quot;The Big Clock&quot;.&quot; Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The film makes such good use of Washington and builds suspense so well that it transcends a plot bordering on ridiculous.&quot;

<doc id="886562" wikidata="Q2397916" url="?curid=886562" title="Sony Ericsson P910">
<text>The Sony Ericsson P910 is a mobile phone by Sony Ericsson introduced in 2004 and the successor of the Sony Ericsson P900. The P910 has a full QWERTY keyboard on the back of the flip (the flip can also be removed completely, allowing for a &#x27;traditional&#x27; PDA form-factor). The biggest change from the P900 to the P910 is that the P910 supports Memory Stick PRO Duo and the phone&#x27;s internal memory has been upped from 16 MB to 64 MB. Although Memory Stick PRO Duo comes in larger capacities, the maximum supported by the P910i is 2 GB. It is powered by an ARM9 processor clocked at 156 MHz and runs the Symbian OS with the UIQ graphical user interface. The touchscreen displays 262,144 colours (an 18-bit colour depth), as opposed to the P900&#x27;s 65,536 (16-bit). It comes in three versions:

* P910i (GSM 900/1800/1900)
* P910c (GSM 900/1800/1900 for China mainland)
* P910a (GSM 850/1800/1900 for North America and Latin America)

One of the key aspects of the P910 is its ability to input text via several methods: multi-tap and T9 text input using the numerical keypad, hand-writing recognition with the pre-installed Jot-Pro software and touchscreen, virtual keyboard on screen and the new QWERTY keyboard on the inside of the flip.

Other enhancements (compared to the P900) include support for HTML browsing, a new numerical keypad with larger keys and a slightly changed outer casing.

Its closest competitors are the palmOne Treo 650, and the Nokia 9500 Communicator. Other competitors include several PDA-phones powered by Windows and manufactured by Taiwan-based HTC.

Sony Ericsson released the successor to the P910, the P990, in 2006.

<doc id="886565" wikidata="Q17090827" url="?curid=886565" title="Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act">
<text>The Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936 (also known as the Thomas-Rogers Act) is a United States federal law that extended the 1934 Wheeler-Howard or Indian Reorganization Act to include those tribes within the boundaries of the state of Oklahoma. The purpose of these acts were to rebuild Indian tribal societies, return land to the tribes, enable tribes to rebuild their governments, and emphasize Native culture. These Acts were developed by John Collier, Commissioner of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945, who wanted to change federal Indian policy from the &quot;twin evils&quot; of allotment and assimilation, and support Indian self-government.

The Thomas-Rogers Act was adopted in order to enable Native American tribes in Oklahoma to rebuild governments that had been dissolved in order to prepare the territories for Oklahoma being admitted as a state in the Union in 1907. As part of this effort also to encourage Native American assimilation, Indian land title was extinguished in Indian Territory by the break-up and allotment of communal lands. Under the Dawes and Curtis acts, the communal land of the former reservations in Oklahoma was:
* allotted to individual Indian Tribal members with 160 acres per household (too little in many areas to support subsistence farming because of poor conditions)
* held in trust by the United States for the benefit of tribal members. 
*What the government determined to be &quot;surplus&quot; was sold off or otherwise distributed, including to non-Natives, in a series of land runs.

In addition to surplus lands being sold, many Native Americans lost their allotments to speculators and unscrupulous businessmen. The Native Americans suffered major losses of land in Oklahoma. In addition, the disruption of their societies and cultures resulted in considerable breakdown of their worlds.

== Major points of the act ==
* United States Secretary of the Interior is authorized to obtain good agricultural and grazing lands (including Indian lands) to be held in trust for the Indians.
* Land held by the United States is free from any and all taxes except Oklahoma Gross Production Tax from oil and gas produced from the land.
* Where Indian lands are sold, the Secretary of the Interior shall show preference to obtain those lands for the use by Native Americans.
* Any recognized tribe residing within Oklahoma may receive a charter of incorporation from the Secretary of Interior, and shall have the right to self-determination, including the right to make their own bylaws.
* Any group of 10 Tribal Members may receive a Charter of Cooperative Association (for specific purposes) from the Secretary of Interior; laws of the State of Oklahoma govern for those issues not covered by federal law or regulations issued by the Secretary.
* Act does not relate to Osage County, Oklahoma (does not affect the Osage Nation, which retained ownership of its own land)

As issues arose, Department of Interior officials sought the opinion of its Solicitor General about the effects of this legislation. This correspondence is part of the agency records. As the Five Civilized Tribes began to reorganize and set up new governments, the question arose as to whether they could change their membership rules, specifically, to exclude the Freedmen. Each of the tribes had been required under terms of new 1866 treaties to extend citizenship to their Freedmen. In 1941, the Solicitor General noted that Congress had approved the law that enabled tribes to reconstitute their governments and, by extension, enabled them to create new constitutions and rules. It said that the tribes could pass new constitutions with new membership rules that limited membership to persons of Indian descent. While some of the tribes resisted providing Freedmen with full tribal benefits, they did not generally take action to exclude them as members until the late 20th century, at a time of increasing assertion of tribal sovereignty. Freedmen descendants have filed suit against the Cherokee and Creek tribes over such exclusion.

<text>Broadband over power lines (BPL) is a method of power-line communication (PLC) that allows relatively high-speed digital data transmission over public electric power distribution wiring. BPL uses higher frequencies, a wider frequency range, and different technologies compared to other forms of power-line communications to provide high-rate communication over longer distances. BPL uses frequencies that are part of the radio spectrum allocated to over-the-air communication services; therefore, the prevention of interference to, and from, these services is a very important factor in designing BPL systems.

There are two main categories of BPL: in-house and access. In-house BPL is broadband access within a building or structure using the electric lines of the structure to provide the network infrastructure. Access BPL is the use of electrical transmission lines to deliver broadband to the home. Access BPL is considered a viable alternative to Cable or DSL to provide the &#x27;final mile&#x27; of broadband to end users.

==History==
BPL is based on PLC technology developed as far back as 1914 by the US telecommunications company AT&amp;T. In 1990s, BPL emerged as a means of leveraging the pervasiveness of the power grid to deliver high-speed broadband communications. The aim was to expand internet access to areas where traditional wired broadband solutions like DSL or cable were not readily available or economically viable. 

In order to achieve high bandwidth levels, BPL operates at higher frequencies than traditional power line communications, typically in the range between 2 and 80 MHz. The modulation techniques of BPL are Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), which are both superior to Spread Spectrum or Narrowband for spectral efficiency, robustness against channel distortions, and the ability to adapt to channel changes. Electricity companies have been bundling radio frequency on the same line as the electrical current to monitor the performance of their own power grids for years. There have been attempts to implement access BPL, or the provision of internet services to customers via the grid. The prospect of BPL was predicted in 2004 to possibly motivate DSL and cable operators to serve rural communities.

More recently, decarbonization is leading to a significant increase in generation plants, storage devices, and consumers at lower voltage levels, causing capacity issues in distribution grids. Traditional central control becomes not feasible for lower levels due to the vast number of units. Energy utility companies such as E.ON, starts to adopt BPL as a key communication technology to enable real-time, high-speed decentralized control of the grid.

==How BPL works==
Broadband Over Power Lines (BPL) works as specialized modems to convert data into signals and transmit alongside power lines, This process ensures consistent broadband connectivity through demodulation, data distribution, and interference mitigation. 

# Modulation: BPL technology utilizes specific modems to transform digital data into signals that are suitable for power line transmission. Various modulation techniques, such as frequency division multiplexing (FDM) or orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), are employed. These techniques allow the combination of data signals with the power signals on the electrical lines.
# Injection: After modulating the digital data, BPL modems inject the signals to the power lines at substations or distribution points. These data signals merge with the pre-existing alternating current (AC) power signals, leveraging the existing infrastructure without the need for extra cables.
# Signal Propagation: The injected BPL signals propagate through the power lines, utilizing them as transmission mediums. These signals travel along the electrical wiring, making their way to the destination points, such as homes or businesses. The power lines act as conduits for the BPL signals to reach their intended receivers.
# Reception: At the consumer end, BPL modems receive the signals from the power lines. These modems are typically connected to routers or networking devices, allowing the distribution of the internet connection to multiple devices within the premises. The BPL modems serve as the interface between the power lines and the local area network (LAN).
# Demodulation: The BPL modems demodulate the received signals, separating the data packets from the power signals. This process involves extracting the original digital data from the modulated carrier signals. Demodulation allows the recovery of the transmitted information for further processing.
# Data Distribution: Once demodulated, the data packets are forwarded to the connected routers or networking devices. These devices handle the distribution of the internet connection to various devices within the premises, such as computers, smartphones, or smart home devices. The router or networking devices act as gateways for data transmission and reception.
# Repeaters and Amplifiers: In larger BPL deployments, repeaters or amplifiers may be installed along the power lines to boost the signal strength and extend coverage. These devices ensure that the BPL signals maintain sufficient quality and reach distant locations. Repeaters receive and regenerate the BPL signals, enabling their propagation over longer distances without significant degradation.
# Interference Mitigation: BPL systems need incorporate measures to manage interference for consistent data transmission. Specific filtering methods are utilized to address radio frequency interference (RFI) associated with BPL signals. These filters aim to limit BPL&#x27;s influence on adjacent radio communications. Compliance with established regulations and industry norms ensures proper interference mitigation measures.
# Quality and Reliability: BPL system performance is influenced by several elements. These include the condition of the electrical wiring, proximity to BPL equipment, and potential signal interference. Maintaining high-quality wiring and a suitable signal-to-noise ratio is crucial for effective BPL functioning.

== Key characteristics of BPL ==

# Utilization of existing infrastructure: One of the key characteristics of BPL is its capacity to utilize existing power lines. This avoids the demand for significant construction or additional cable installation, positioning it as an economical option for expanding broadband coverage.
# High-speed data communication: BPL technology enables high-speed data communication over existing power lines, offering comparable speeds to traditional wired broadband technologies like DSL or cable. This allows for efficient transmission of large amounts of data, supporting bandwidth-intensive applications.
# Wide coverage: The existing power grid covers a vast area, making BPL capable of reaching homes, businesses, and other locations that may be difficult to connect with other wired broadband technologies.
# Flexibility and scalability: BPL enables flexibility and scalability in terms of extending network coverage. Additional modems can be added at distribution points or substations to expand the reach of the BPL network. This adaptability allows for gradual expansion as demand increases or new areas require connectivity.
# Potential for smart grid integration: BPL can facilitate the integration of smart grid applications, enabling bidirectional communication between power utilities and consumers. It enables energy efficiency management, real-time monitoring, and the implementation of demand-response systems, leading to enhanced grid resilience and energy conservation.
# Coexistence with power signals: BPL operates alongside the power signals on the same power lines. It utilizes modulation techniques to ensure that the data signals do not interfere with the power grid&#x27;s normal functioning. This coexistence minimizes the need for dedicated infrastructure and simplifies implementation.

== Implementation challenges ==
Power lines were not designed for data transmission, they were created to deliver AC power at 50 to 60Hz. If Broadband data is transmitted at different frequencies, then the data and electricity can travel in the same wire, however several obstacles have to be overcome to enable the high-speed and long-distance transmission of data on existing power lines.

Deployment of BPL has illustrated a number of fundamental challenges, the primary one being that power lines are inherently a very noisy environment. Every time a device turns on or off, it introduces a pop or click into the line. Switching power supplies often introduce noisy harmonics into the line. And unlike coaxial cable or twisted-pair, the wiring has no inherent noise rejection.

The second major issue is electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). The system was expected to use frequencies of 10 to 30 MHz in the high frequency (HF) range, used for decades by military, aeronautical, amateur radio, and shortwave broadcasters. Power lines are unshielded and will act as antennas for the signals they carry, and they will cause interference to high frequency radio communications and broadcasting. In 2007, the NATO Research and Technology Organization released a report which concluded that widespread deployment of BPL may have a &quot;possible detrimental effect upon military HF radio communications.&quot;

==Deployments==
There have been many attempts worldwide to implement access BPL, all which have indicated that BPL is not viable as a means of delivering broadband Internet access. This is because of two problems: limited reach, and low bandwidth which do not come close to matching ADSL, Wi-Fi, and even 3G mobile. World major providers have either limited their BPL deployments to low-bandwidth connected equipment via smart grids, or ceased BPL operations altogether.

Australia saw trials of access BPL between 2004 and 2007; but no active access BPL deployments appear to remain there.

In the UK, the BBC published the results of tests to detect interference from BPL installations.

In the US, in October 2004, the US Federal Communications Commission adopted rules to facilitate the deployment of &quot;Access BPL&quot;, the marketing term for Internet access service over power lines. The technical rules are more liberal than those advanced by the US national amateur radio organization, the American Radio Relay League (ARRL), and other spectrum users, but include provisions that require BPL providers to investigate and correct any interference they cause.

One service was announced in 2004 for Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana by Current Communications but they left the BPL business in 2008.

On August 3, 2006, FCC adopted a memorandum opinion and an order on broadband over power lines, giving the go-ahead to promote broadband service to all Americans. The order rejected calls from aviation, business, commercial, amateur radio and other sectors of spectrum users to limit or prohibit deployment until further study was completed. FCC chief Kevin Martin said that BPL &quot;holds great promise as a ubiquitous broadband solution that would offer a viable alternative to cable, digital subscriber line, fiber, and wireless broadband solutions&quot;.

In the US, International Broadband Electric Communications (IBEC), which had an ambitious plan to provide access BPL in the US, ceased BPL operations in January 2012.

On January 19, 2018, E.ON, the German multinational electric utility company serving approx. 48 million customers across different countries [*], decided to integrate BPL into their communication strategy, specifically for the smart metering communication infrastructure within the low voltage segment of their grid. E.ON chose Corinex as the solution provider for the initial two years of the deployment. The initial deployment was several ten thousand repeaters and headends, providing secure communication for a couple of hundred thousand households. Corinex GridValue energy management system based on the IBM Tivoli platform was selected to manage the network.

==Standards==
Several standards are evolving for BPL technology including those of the IEEE, HomePlug Powerline Alliance (defunct), PRIME Alliance, and Nessum Alliance.

=== IEEE related to BPL technology ===

* IEEE 643-2004 &quot;Guide for Power-Line Carrier Applications&quot; is a standard for communication over the transmission line network (above 69kV).
* IEEE P1675 &quot;Standard for Broadband over Power Line Hardware&quot; is a working group working on hardware installation and safety issues.
* IEEE P1775 &quot;Powerline Communication Equipment - Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Requirements - Testing and Measurement Methods&quot; is a working group focused on PLC equipment, electromagnetic compatibility requirements, and testing and measurement methods.
* IEEE P1901-2020 &quot;IEEE Standard for Broadband over Power Line Networks: Medium Access Control and Physical Layer Specifications&quot; is a working group for delivering broadband over power lines. The aim is to define medium access control and physical layer specifications for all classes of BPL devices - from long distance connections to those within subscriber premises.

==Failure scenarios==
There are many ways in which the communication signal may have error introduced into it. Interference, cross chatter, some active devices, and some passive devices all introduce noise or attenuation into the signal. When error becomes significant the devices controlled by the unreliable signal may fail, become inoperative, or operate in an undesirable fashion.

# Interference: Interference from nearby systems can cause signal degradation as the modem may not be able to determine a specific frequency among many signals in the same bandwidth.
# Signal degradation by active devices: Devices such as relays, transistors, and rectifiers create noise in their respective systems, increasing the likelihood of signal degradation. Arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) devices, required by some recent electrical codes for living spaces, may also attenuate the signals.
# Signal attenuation by passive devices: Transformers and DC–DC converters attenuate the input frequency signal almost completely. &quot;Bypass&quot; devices become necessary for the signal to be passed on to the receiving node. A bypass device may consist of three stages, a filter in series with a protection stage and coupler, placed in parallel with the passive device.

<text>British Physical Laboratories, doing business as BPL Ltd., is an Indian electronics company. It makes consumer electronics and health care equipment. It was founded in 1963 in Palakkad, Kerala, and is headquartered at Bangalore, Karnataka.

==History==
British Physical Laboratories India Pvt. Ltd. was founded in 1963, during the Licence Raj, by T. P. G. Nambiar in Palakkad, Kerala, as a company for manufacturing hermetically sealed precision panel meters for the defence forces. Nambiar had worked in the United Kingdom and United States, and when he returned to India, he desired to create a company that manufactured high-quality electronic products, and he wanted to make BPL a household name. The initial products were precision measuring instruments such as hermetic sealed panel meters for Bharat Electronics as a subcontract for Indian Army. The newly-founded company was joint venture with the British company of the same name.

Then BPL expanded its medical product ranges to include electrocardiographs and patient-monitoring systems. After the 1982 Asian Games, BPL expanded its range further and manufactured colour televisions and video cassette recorders, and later refrigerators, batteries and other consumer electrical equipment.

The company headquarters was moved to Dynamic House, Church Street, Bangalore. From medical electronics, it expanded into consumer electronics, telecommunications, soft energy and electronic components.

===1980s===
From 1980 onwards, when the industrial licensing was relaxed, BPL began manufacturing televisions and telecommunications equipment, demonstrating its potential and future business area. It began collaborating with the Japanese Sanyo Electric Company in the early 1980s with a technology-transfer agreement. In the early 1990s, after globalisation and liberalization of the Indian economy, competition entered the market. BPL retained its strong presence and growth rate. During the late 1990s, the company&#x27;s annual revenue peaked at .

BPL concentrated on importing technology, improving product quality, innovations and manufacturing of electronic products. In late 1980s, BPL had metamorphosed from an entrepreneurial venture, into India&#x27;s biggest consumer electronics &amp; telecommunication company.

Following economic liberalisation in India in 1991, BPL faced increased competition from South Korean companies LG and Samsung. Internal disputes within the controlling family took away attention from external threats, and the company&#x27;s fortunes declined. By 2004, BPL and Sanyo were facing serious financial problems due to intense competition in the global electronics market. In 2005, the companies announced a joint-venture, and BPL transferred its colour television business, then worth US$80 million, to the new venture.

BPL was restructured with a focus on energy, healthcare, consumer electronics and home security systems. In 2015, BPL partnered with Flipkart as an online retailer. In 2016, BPL launched new LED TVs (32 Inch, 40 inch and more) with a very economical price through E-commerce websites like Flipkart and Amazon.

==Performance==
BPL Ltd has reported a net loss of in the second quarter of fiscal 2005-06, on gross sales of . Operating losses were at .

Gross sales were in the corresponding period during 2004-05 while net loss was at .

According to the company, the promoters have brought in as contemplated in the corporate debt restructuring scheme. The amount was to pay statutory liabilities, unsecured, pressing creditors, dealers, credit balances, employee dues and working capital requirements, in part.

In respect to the auditors&#x27; qualification of the company&#x27;s accounts for the period ended 31 March 2005, about undisputed amounts payable in respect of income-tax (), dividend tax (), wealth tax (), TDS () and customs duty ().

The balance in customs duty would be paid once the financial restructuring is completed and normalcy of operations is achieved, according to the company.

==Joint venture with Sanyo==
The BPL Group and Japanese electronics major Sanyo Electric Company Ltd formally started their 50:50 joint venture.

The partners, who had shared a long-standing relationship since 1982, had been off the market for about two years, going through some tough times. In the year 2006, they decided to get back in action together to regain lost market share.

While unveiling the Joint Venture&#x27;s plans, Sanyo-BPL Pvt Ltd Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ajit G Nambiar, said the company expected to post revenues of around by 2009 and lead the market in consumer electronics and white goods in five years.

However, they decided to market their brands separately with BPL focusing on the volume segment while Sanyo brand positioned itself as the value driver.

Besides, Sanyo also planned to use India as its sourcing base and has already started sourcing slim TVs from India. It also expected India to contribute five per cent of its global revenues from its operations in India.

In May 2007 after the failure of Sanyo BPL venture. The attrition rate in Sanyo BPL was 70%. BPL concentrated 100% on Healthcare Business group which has its own manufacturing of electromedical equipment such as electrocardiography apparatus and patient monitors.

== BPL Medical Technologies ==
BPL Medical Technologies was spun off into a separate company in 2013. In May 2013, Goldman Sachs purchased a 49% stake in the new company for .

<text>Eva Jacqueline Longoria Bastón ( Longoria; born March 15, 1975) is an American actress, producer, director, and businesswoman. After several guest roles on television, she became recognized for her portrayal of Isabella Braña on the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (2001–2003). Her breakthrough role as Gabrielle Solis on the ABC television series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2004–2012) netted her two Screen Actors Guild Awards and a Golden Globe nomination. She has appeared in the films &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (2006), &quot;Over Her Dead Body&quot; (2008), &quot;For Greater Glory&quot; (2012), &quot;Frontera&quot; (2014), &quot;Lowriders&quot; (2016), and &quot;Overboard&quot; (2018), winning an Imagen Award for the latter. She guest-starred on the Hulu mystery comedy-drama series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot; (2024), earning her a third Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.

In 2005, Longoria founded UnbeliEVAble Entertainment, a film and television production company. In 2023, the company was acquired by Hyphenate Media Group, a production company co-founded by Longoria and Cris Abrego. She also executive produced the Lifetime television series &quot;Devious Maids&quot; (2013–2016), the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;Telenovela&quot; (2015–2016) in which she starred, and the films &quot;The Harvest&quot; (2013) and &quot;Food Chains&quot; (2014).

Her other business ventures include opening the restaurant Beso in 2008, investing in businesses and films such as &quot;John Wick&quot; (2014), and publishing a cookbook.

==Early life and education==

Longoria was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, on March 15, 1975, the youngest of the four daughters of her Tejano parents Ella Eva (Mireles) and Enrique Longoria Jr. One of her sisters has special needs. Longoria told &quot;Redbook&quot; in 2016:

She was raised Roman Catholic. She did not speak Spanish growing up, and did not learn the language until 2009. While in high school, she worked at a Wendy&#x27;s restaurant part-time for three years to help earn money for her . Longoria previously told the press how her years in fast food as a teen shaped her work ethic, saying &quot;I couldn&#x27;t wait to get to work and make my own money.&quot; Longoria earned her Bachelor of Science degree in kinesiology at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville. At that time (1998), she also won the title of Miss Corpus Christi USA. After completing college, she entered a talent contest that led her to Los Angeles; and shortly thereafter, was spotted and signed by a theatrical agent. While auditioning for roles, she worked as a headhunter for four years. Longoria has publicly credited Jennifer Lopez as being an inspiration to her early in her career. &quot;Jennifer broke down so many doors so that we could walk through them,&quot; she told the magazine &quot;People&quot;. &quot;And she kicked them down. They were not easy doors.&quot; She also described Tejana legend Selena as being &quot;my idol, my inspiration&quot; and &quot;the reason I even dared to dream that a better life was possible.&quot;
After three years at California State University, Northridge, she received her master&#x27;s degree in Chicano studies in May 2013. &quot;This place was probably the place I grew most in my life… I was exhausted the whole time I was here,&quot; she laughs. &quot;I did night school. I would finish filming [&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;] and come here 7 to 10 at night, and then, go home and do it all again. Be on set at 5:00 a.m. It fills my heart with my Mexican pride.&quot; Her thesis was &quot;Success STEMS From Diversity: The Value of Latinas in STEM Careers&quot;.

==Career==

=== 2000s ===
Longoria guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Another guest appearance on &quot;General Hospital&quot; the same year led to a contract role on the CBS Daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, where she portrayed Isabella Braña from 2001 to 2003.

In 2003, Longoria was cast as Gabrielle Solis in the ABC comedy-drama &quot;Desperate Housewives.&quot; She later commented, &quot;I think it&#x27;s funny when people say I&#x27;m an overnight sensation, because I&#x27;ve been working at it for 10 years.&quot;

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===
Longoria was married to actor Tyler Christopher, star of &quot;General Hospital&quot;, from 2002 to 2004.

Longoria met Tony Parker, then the point guard for the San Antonio Spurs, in November 2004. On November 30, 2006, they became engaged, and married in a civil service on July 6, 2007, at a Paris city hall. They had a Catholic wedding ceremony at the Saint-Germain l&#x27;Auxerrois Church in Paris on July 7, 2007. On November 17, 2010, Longoria filed for divorce from Parker in Los Angeles, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. In the divorce petition, she requested that her family name be restored, and sought spousal support from Parker. The couple had a prenuptial agreement signed in June 2007, a month before their wedding, and amended two years later in June 2009.

Longoria told her friend Mario Lopez that she had discovered hundreds of text messages from another woman on her husband&#x27;s phone. &quot;Extra&quot; identified the other woman as Erin Barry, then-wife of Brent Barry, Parker&#x27;s former teammate, and revealed that the Barrys were also divorcing. In light of her divorce, Longoria canceled her scheduled appearance at the 2010 American Music Awards. On November 19, 2010, Parker filed for divorce from Longoria in Bexar County, Texas, on the grounds of &quot;discord or conflict of personalities&quot;, establishing a legal battle over where the case would be heard. Unlike Longoria&#x27;s divorce petition, Parker&#x27;s did not mention a prenuptial agreement and claimed that the parties would &quot;enter into an agreement for the division of their estate&quot;. The divorce was finalized in Texas on January 28, 2011, the same day Longoria&#x27;s lawyer filed papers to dismiss her Los Angeles petition. Longoria later said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t realize it at the time with Tony, but I had become my own version of a desperate housewife.&quot;

On December 13, 2015, Longoria reported her engagement to Mexican businessman José Antonio &quot;Pepe&quot; Bastón Patiño, then the president of Televisa, the largest media company in Latin America. They met on a blind date arranged by a mutual friend in Mexico City; at the time, Bastón did not know who Longoria was, and initially declined the invitation to meet her because of his busy schedule. They were married in Mexico on May 21, 2016.

On December 19, 2017, it was reported that Longoria was pregnant with her first child. She gave birth to a son in 2018.

In November 2024 she revealed that she moved out of the United States with her family and they split their time between Mexico and Spain.

===Ancestry===

According to research done in 2010 by Harvard professor and &quot;Faces of America&quot; host Henry Louis Gates Jr., Longoria&#x27;s oldest identifiable Spanish immigrant ancestor is her ninth great-grandfather, Lorenzo Suárez de Longoria (b. Oviedo, 1592), who was a colonist of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (modern-day Mexico) in 1603. His family was based in a small village called Llongoria, Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias, Spain. Longoria is the Castillanized form of this Asturian-language surname.

In 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost of land along the Rio Grande in a land grant from King Charles III of Spain. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War, the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.

According to DNA testing, Longoria&#x27;s overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27% Indigenous American, and 3% African. A computer analysis of the DNA results of Gates&#x27;s dozen guests showed that Longoria has the same genetic haplogroup as cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who is of Chinese heritage. As women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Longoria did not inherit her father&#x27;s Y-DNA, but she did inherit her mother&#x27;s mitochondrial DNA (genetic information passed from mother to child). Longoria&#x27;s mtDNA belongs to the Haplogroup A2, making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, a Mayan from the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Maya on both sides of her family.

Longoria identifies as a &quot;&quot;—a Mexican-American Texan.
