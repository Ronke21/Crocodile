<text>Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos is a comic book series created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee and published by Marvel Comics from 1963 to 1981. The main character, Sgt. Nick Fury, later became the leader of Marvel&#x27;s super-spy agency, S.H.I.E.L.D. The title also featured the Howling Commandos, a fictional World War II unit that first appeared in &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot; #1 (cover dated May 1963).

==Publication history==
Stan Lee has described the series &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot; as having come about due to a bet with his publisher, Martin Goodman that the Lee-Kirby style could make a book sell even with the worst title Lee could devise. Lee elaborated on that claim in a 2007 interview, responding to the suggestion that the series title did not necessarily seem bad:
 Comics-artist contemporary John Severin recalled in an interview conducted in the early 2000s that in the late 1950s, Kirby had approached him to be partners on a syndicated, newspaper comic strip &quot;set in Europe during World War Two; the hero would be a tough, cigar-chomping sergeant with a squad of oddball GIs — sort of an adult &quot;Boy Commandos&quot;&quot;, referring to a 1940s wartime &quot;kid gang&quot; comics series Kirby had co-created for DC Comics.

&quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot; followed an elite special unit, the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the &quot;Howling Commandos&quot;, which was stationed in a military base in England to fight missions primarily, but not exclusively, in the European theatre of World War II. Under Captain &quot;Happy Sam&quot; Sawyer, Fury was the cigar-chomping noncom who led the racially and ethnically integrated unit (racial integration was unusual for the then-segregated U.S. military, though possible in elite special forces units). Lee was obliged to send a memo to the color separator at the printing plant to confirm that the character Gabe Jones was African American, after the character had appeared with Caucasian coloring in the first issue.

The series ran 167 issues (May 1963 - Dec. 1981), though with reprints alternating with new stories from issue #80 (Sept. 1970), and only in reprints after issue #120 (July 1974); at this point the formal copyrighted title in the indicia, which had been simply &quot;Sgt. Fury&quot;, was changed to match the trademarked cover logo, &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot;. Following seven issues by creators Lee and Kirby (who returned to collaborate on #13 and on the opening and closing pages of #18), penciller Dick Ayers began his long stint on what would be his signature series, penciling 95 issues, including two extra-length annuals. John Severin later joined as inker, forming a long-running, award-winning team; he would, additionally, both pencil and ink issues #44-46. The series&#x27; only other pencilers came on one issue each by Tom Sutton (which Ayers said was &quot;done that time I asked for a furlough and reassignment&quot;) and Herb Trimpe (&quot;They shuffled Trimpe and me around, [him] to &quot;Fury&quot; and [me] and Severin to &quot;[The Incredible] Hulk&quot;&quot; Ayers recalled.)

Roy Thomas followed Lee as writer, himself followed by Gary Friedrich, for whom this also became a signature series. Ayers said in 1977, &quot;Stan Lee left &quot;Fury&quot; first to Roy Thomas because the superheroes were gaining in popularity at that time it was best he concentrate on them&quot;, referring to the young Marvel&#x27;s then growing line of superhero comics, such as &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. &quot;I must admit I resented somewhat those superheroes taking Stan away from &quot;Fury&quot;!&quot;

Friedrich began as a co-scripter of issues #42-44 (May–July 1967). The Friedrich-Ayers-Severin team began in earnest, however, with #45 (Aug. 1967), the first of what would be several of the series&#x27; &quot;The&quot; stories: &quot;The War Lover&quot;, a shaded exploration of a trigger-happy soldier and the line drawn, even in war, between killing and murder. Daring for the time, when majority public sentiment still supported the undeclared Vietnam War, the story balanced present-day issues while demonstrating that even in what is referred to as &quot;a just war&quot;, a larger morality prevails. As one writer in the 1970s observed,


At his best, Ayers&#x27; art in &quot;Sgt. Fury&quot; showed &quot;a clear, forthright storyteller, excellent in medium close shots with a subtly out-of-focus background. He blended large panels with thin or small ones for movement, and often provided vast, cinemascopic panoramas for his writers to work with... [E]ven in a scene that would ordinarily be static you could feel his characters breathing.&quot; Inker Severin &quot;took the art even further, laying dark, scratchy inks&quot; that gave grit to Ayers&#x27; pencils. Ayers himself &quot;liked the results of John Severin&#x27;s work on &quot;Sgt. Fury&quot; immensely&quot;, he said in 1977. &quot;He added details beyond what I&#x27;d put in. He always seemed to go one step beyond.&quot;

Friedrich continued through #83 (Jan. 1971), with the late part of this run having reprint issues alternating with new stories. He returned for the even-numbered issues from #94-114 (Jan. 1972 - Nov. 1973).

&quot;Sgt. Fury&quot; ran concurrently with two other, short-lived Marvel World War II series, &quot;Capt. Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders&quot; (later titled &quot;Captain Savage and his Battlefield Raiders&quot;), which lasted 19 issues from 1968–1970; and &quot;Combat Kelly and the Deadly Dozen&quot;, which lasted nine issues from 1972-1973. The Howlers guest starred in #6 and #11 of the former series, and #4 of the latter.

Lee explained the series&#x27;s transition to reprints: &quot;... so much fan mail came in from readers who wanted more of &quot;Sgt. Fury&quot;, but we didn&#x27;t have time, I didn&#x27;t have the men to draw it, I didn&#x27;t have the time to write it, and we were busy with other things, so we just started re-printing the books, and strangely enough, the reprint versions of &quot;Sgt. Fury&quot; sold as well as the original ones had!&quot; The final issue, #167 (Dec. 1981) reprinted the first issue.

Seven annual publications appeared, the first titled &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos Special King Size Annual&quot; #1 (1965), and the remainder titled &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos King-Size Special&quot; #2-7 (1966 - Nov. 1971), with hyphen and sans &quot;Annual&quot;. The final three contain reprints only, save for a 10-page framing sequence in #6. In annuals #1 and #3, the Howlers reunited for a special mission each in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, respectively; annual #2 found them storming the beaches at Normandy on D-Day in 1944, and annual #4 was a flashback to the Battle of the Bulge.

One latter-day story was published in &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot; #1 (July 2009), as the cover logo read; its copyright indicia read &quot;Sgt. Fury &amp; His Howling Commandos One-Shot&quot; #1. The 32-page story, &quot;Shotgun Opera&quot;, was by writer Jesse Alexander and artist John Paul Leon.

==Characters==
In addition to Fury, the elite special unit of U.S. Army Rangers nicknamed the Howling Commandos consisted of the following:

* Corporal Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader &quot;Dum Dum&quot; Dugan - A former circus strongman, Dum Dum is Fury&#x27;s good right hand. He occasionally refers to his wife in Boston and his mother-in-law as reasons that he enlisted, preferring fighting Nazis to dealing with them.
* Private Isadore &quot;Izzy&quot; Cohen - The first demonstrably Jewish American comic book hero. Izzy is a master mechanic.
* Private Gabriel Jones - An African American serving in an integrated unit. (The regular U.S. armed forces were not in reality integrated until after the war in 1948. However, certain elite units were in other comic books.)
* Private Dino Manelli - He is modeled after Dean Martin. A swashbuckling movie actor, born in Italy, Dino enlisted to give back to the country that gave him so much. He is fluent in Italian and, inexplicably, also in German.
* Private Robert &quot;Rebel&quot; Ralston - An ex-jockey from Kentucky&#x27;s Bluegrass region.
* Private Percival &quot;Pinky&quot; Pinkerton - Loosely modeled after real-life Commando and movie actor David Niven, this British soldier replaced Juniper in issue #8 (July 1964). 
* Private Jonathan &quot;Junior&quot; Juniper — In an unusual and daring move for comics at the time, Junior was killed in action after a few issues (issue #4 (Nov. 1963)). As one comics historian wrote in 1999, &quot;Today that&#x27;s no big deal but in 1963, comics heroes simply didn&#x27;t die; not permanently, anyway. Suddenly, with the death of &#x27;Junior&#x27; Juniper, the series acquired some real cachet. It now played like a true-life war drama where people got killed and never came back. You wondered who would be next.&quot;
* Private Eric Koenig - A defector from Nazi Germany who joined the squad in issue #27 (Feb. 1966).
* Private James &quot;Jim&quot; Morita - Was an American of Japanese descent who served in the U.S. Army as a Ranger during World War II. He joined a Nisei Squadron under the command of Capt. &quot;Happy Sam&quot; Sawyer and served with the Howling Commandos on several missions.
* Private Jacques &quot;Frenchie&quot; Dernier - Was a member of the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation during WWII.

==Fictional team history==
In issue #34 (Sept. 1966) it is shown that a young Nick Fury with his friend Red Hargrove, left their childhood neighborhood to pursue their dreams of adventure, eventually settling on a daring wing-walking aviation act. Their death-defying stunts caught the attention of Lieutenant Samuel &quot;Happy Sam&quot; Sawyer when Fury and Hargrove were training British Commandos in low-level parachuting. Sawyer was serving with the British Commandos in 1940 and underwent training by Fury. Sawyer enlisted them for a special mission in the Netherlands. Nick and Red later joined the U.S. Army, with Fury undergoing basic training under a Sergeant Bass at Fort Dix in New Jersey. Both Fury and Red were stationed at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the base on December 7, 1941, and Red was among the many killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Sawyer recruited select U.S. Army Rangers to his &quot;Able&quot; Company. Sawyer assigned Fury the command of the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the &quot;Howling Commandos&quot;. They and the Second Attack Squad (the &quot;Maulers&quot;, led by Sgt. &quot;Bull&quot; McGiveney, with Cpl. &quot;Ricketts&quot; Johnson), and, later, Jim Morita&#x27;s Nisei squad were stationed in a military base in England to fight specialized missions, primarily, but not exclusively, in the European theatre of World War II, eventually going as far afield as the Pacific theatre, Africa, and, once each, in the Middle East and on the Russian front. Fury fell in love with a beautiful English nurse, Pamela Hawley, who is killed in a German bombing raid on London before he could propose to her.

The Howling Commandos&#x27; earliest (but not first-published) assignment occurred in the autumn of 1942. They were to recover British rocket scientist Dr. Henry MacMillan from a German military base in occupied Norway. Their success brought them to the attention of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who incorporated the unit into the British Army, and given the title of &quot;Commandos&quot;.

The Howlers fought against the likes of German General Erwin Rommel and inter-squad bigotry, often in the same story. Antagonists included Baron Strucker, Captain America&#x27;s nemeses Baron Zemo and the Red Skull (Adolf Hitler&#x27;s protégé), and other Axis villains. The Howlers encountered Office of Strategic Services agent Reed Richards (later Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four) in issue #3 (Sept. 1963), and fought alongside Captain America and Bucky in #13 (Dec. 1964).

They reunited for missions in the Korean War, where Fury received a field promotion to lieutenant, and in the Vietnam War, each in a summer-annual special, as well as at a present-day, fictional reunion gala in issue #100 (July 1972).

<doc id="893938" wikidata="Q456009" url="?curid=893938" title="Christopher Ehret">
<text>Christopher Ehret (born 27 July 1941), who currently holds the position of Distinguished Research Professor at UCLA, is an American scholar of African history and African historical linguistics particularly known for his efforts to correlate linguistic taxonomy and reconstruction with the archeological record. He has published many works, including &quot;Reconstructing Proto-Afrasian&quot; (1995) and &quot;Ancient Africa&quot; (2023). He has written around seventy articles on a range of historical, linguistic, and anthropological subjects. These works include monographic articles on Bantu subclassification; on internal reconstruction in Semitic; on the reconstruction of proto-Cushitic and proto-Eastern Cushitic; and, with Mohamed Nuuh Ali, on the classification of the Somali languages. 

He has also contributed to a number of encyclopedias on African topics and on world history, such as Volume III of UNESCO General History of Africa book series for which he wrote a chapter on the East African interior.

==Career==
Ehret&#x27;s historical books emphasize early African history. In &quot;An African Classical Age&quot; (1998) he argues for a conception of the period from 1000 BC to 400 AD in East Africa as a &quot;classical age&quot; during which a variety of major technologies and social structures first took shape. His Civilizations of Africa: A History to 1800 (2002), brings together the whole of African history from the close of the last ice age down to the end of the eighteenth century. With the archaeologist Merrick Posnansky, he also edited &quot;The Archaeological and Linguistic Reconstruction of African History&quot; (1982), at that time a state-of-the-field survey of the correlation of linguistic and archaeological findings in the different major regions of the continent.

In reviewing &quot;An African Classical Age&quot; for the Annuals of the American Academy, Ronald Atkinson calls it &quot;not easy or light reading&quot;, but concludes that &quot;the result is a remarkably rich, evocative social and cultural history…” and that it &quot;will itself become a classic and shape future scholarship in early African history for many years to come&quot;. The late Kennell Jackson of Stanford, writing in &quot;The Historian&quot;, says that &quot;by the book’s midpoint, the immensity of his synthesis becomes apparent, as well as Ehret’s achievement as a historical conceptualizer. He repeatedly challenges formulaic ideas about causality, linearity as a model of change, and the cultural factors affecting innovation…. Ehret has written a fabulous African history book, furthering a genre far from the seemingly ubiquitous slavery studies and trendy colonial social history&quot;. Peter Robertshaw in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, offers a more measured conclusion: &quot;Ehret has produced a remarkably coherent and detailed history which should spur further research&quot;.

The historian Esperanza Brizuela-Garcia, in her review of &quot;The Civilizations of Africa&quot; for the &quot;African Studies Review&quot;, calls this book &quot;challenging and innovative&quot; for presenting &quot;the early history of Africa within the context of wide historical processes such as the development of agriculture, the emergence of metalwork, and the evolution of trade…. It gives these themes a thorough and masterful treatment…. By looking at broad themes of the history of human experience, Ehret is able to explain what makes Africa unique and what makes it comparable to other continents&quot;. She concludes: &quot;The most important achievement of Ehret’s book is that finally the early history of the continent is taken seriously and is presented in detail and form that do justice to its complexity and depth. One hopes that Christopher Ehret has initiated a new trend in the writing of African history textbooks, one that challenges previously accepted chronologies and ideas and presents us with an interpretation that connects social, economic, political, and cultural history&quot;.

Scott MacEachern&#x27;s review of the same book for the &quot;Journal of Africa History&quot; adds an archaeologist&#x27;s perspective: &quot;The book is well written and comprehensive and abundantly illustrates the richness and complexity of African societies over many thousands of years. More discussion of methodologies and data compatibility, and a more complete reference list, would have been useful. It will make a fine introductory text for courses in African history, especially if supplemented by books and papers that reflect other research methods and their results&quot;. 
Ehret&#x27;s linguistic tome, &quot;Reconstructing Proto-Afroasiatic (Proto-Afrasian): Vowels, Tone, Consonants, and Vocabulary&quot; (1995), is the subject of a detailed review article in &quot;Afrika und Übersee&quot; by the distinguished scholar of Afroasiatic languages, Ekkehard Wolff. Wolff writes: &quot;Ehrets opus magnum ist ein Parforce-Ritt durch schwierigstes Terrain, bei dem sich der Reiter auch an die steilsten Hindernissen überraschend gut in Sattel hält und an nur einer einzigen Hürde nach Meinung des Rez. scheitert (…Tonalität). Es ist ein nahezu unmöglisches, ein sehr mutiges und ein möglicherweise epochales Buch&quot;. (&quot;Ehret’s opus magnum is a steeplechase ride through the most difficult terrain, in which the rider stays in the saddle astonishingly well even at the steepest obstacles and, in the opinion of the reviewer, crashes at only a single hurdle (…tone). It is a nearly impossible, a very courageous, and a possibly epochal book&quot;.) After an extensive and thorough critical commentary on the contents of the book, Wolff concludes: &quot;Ehret hat nichts weniger versucht als einen zukünftigen &quot;Klassiker&quot; zu schreiben...” (&quot;Ehret has sought to write nothing less than a future classic.&quot;)

This particular book appeared in the same year as another comparative work on the same language family, Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova&#x27;s &quot;Hamito-Semitic Etymological Dictionary: Materials for a Reconstruction&quot;. Two reviewers have given comparative assessments of the two books, John Greppin in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, 1 November 1996, and Robert Ratcliffe in a paper, &quot;Afroasiatic Comparative Lexica: Implications for Long (and Medium) Range Language Comparison&quot;. Greppin writes a strongly positive review; Ratcliffe takes a more negative stance toward both books.

Ehret&#x27;s 2001 book, &quot;A Historical-Comparative Reconstruction of Nilo-Saharan&quot;, has had a mixed reception. Václav Blažek, in a review article originally prepared for &quot;Afrikanische Arbeitspapiere&quot;, presents additional data, most of which, in his words, &quot;confirm Ehret’s cognate sets&quot;. He continues, &quot;The weakest point in the…monograph consists in semantics. Ehret’s approach is rather benevolent …. But in any case, in the present time Ehret’s work signifies big progress&quot;. The sociologist and linguist Gerard Philippson in his review in the &quot;Journal of African Languages and Linguistics&quot;, also raises questions on some of the semantic connections, and he has doubts about the environments of certain sound changes proposed in the book. He has issues as well with Ehret&#x27;s use of evidence from the Central Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family, but he finds his arguments relating to the Eastern Sahelian (Eastern Sudanic) branch convincing and &quot;solid&quot;. He avers in conclusion: &quot;Même les chercheurs s&#x27;opposant à cette reconstruction disposeront, en tous cas, d&#x27;une somme de matériaux, clairement présentés dans l&#x27;ensemble, sur lesquels ils pourront s&#x27;appuyer pour mettre en cause ou rebâtir l&#x27;ensemble proposé. Il s&#x27;agit de toutes façons d&#x27;un travail qui ne saurait être ignoré.&quot; (&quot;Even the researchers who are opposed to this reconstruction will have, in any case, an amount of material, clearly presented throughout, which they can rely on to either challenge or rebuild what is proposed. As a whole, it constitutes a work which cannot be ignored&quot;.) Roger Blench, a development anthropologist, published a critical comparison of Ehret&#x27;s and M. L. Bender&#x27;s comparative work on the Nilo-Saharan family in &quot;Africa und Übersee&quot; in 2000—from its date, seemingly written before the book came out. It may be based, in part, on a preliminary manuscript by Ehret from the early 1990s.

==Recent years==
In recent years Ehret has carried his work in several new directions. One of these has been the history and evolution of early human kinship systems. A second interest has been to apply the methods of historical reconstruction from linguistic evidence to issues in anthropological theory and in world history. He has also collaborated with geneticists in seeking to correlate linguistic with genetic findings (e.g., Sarah A. Tishkoff, Floyd A. Reed, F. R. Friedlaender, Christopher Ehret, Alessia Ranciaro, et al., &quot;The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans&quot;, Science 324, 22 May 2009) and in developing mathematical tools for dating linguistic history (e.g., Andrew Kitchen, Christopher Ehret, Shiferew Assefa, and Connie Mulligan, &quot;Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Semitic languages identifies an Early Bronze Age origin of Semitic in the Near East,&quot; Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, July 2009).

<doc id="893944" wikidata="Q6896639" url="?curid=893944" title="Molly Millions">
<text>Molly Millions (also known as Sally Shears, Rose Kolodny, and others) is a recurring character in stories and novels written by William Gibson, particularly his Sprawl trilogy. She first appeared in &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, to which she makes an oblique reference in &quot;Neuromancer&quot; (where she is referred to as &quot;Molly&quot; with no last name given). She later appeared in &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot; under the name &quot;Sally Shears&quot;.

==Character history==
In all three stories, Molly is a physically tough (but not instantly imposing) bodyguard/mercenary cyborg. She is referred to as a &quot;razorgirl&quot; or &quot;street samurai&quot; throughout his stories and also as &quot;Steppin&#x27; Razor&quot; by the residents of Zion, a Rastafarian enclave aboard a space station.

A useful contact for dealing with gangs and black market elements, she tends to show little remorse for the opponents she ruthlessly dispatches in the course of her objectives. In fact she shows few deep emotions towards anyone outside of hatred, suspicion or amused contempt. Nevertheless, Molly is always regarded throughout the book as a loyal, morally strong character, opposed to the progressing decay of human relations in the world Gibson depicts.

An exception to her cold, somewhat cynical approach to life was her relationship with Johnny (of &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;), for whom she still mourned at the time of &quot;Neuromancer&quot;. This is part of the personal history she relates to its protagonist, Case, in addition to the revelation that she worked as a &quot;meat puppet&quot; (a prostitute) in a &quot;puppet parlor&quot; (a brothel where people lend out their bodies while maintained in a blanked-out state) to pay for her considerable cybernetic enhancements.

Another pseudonym, used when she rents a hotel room in &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, is &quot;Rose Kolodny&quot;, the name by which the Turing Police refer to her. The Turing Police may have simply gotten the name from the hotel&#x27;s registry, but it is sometimes speculated to be her original name. The later trilogy books speculate that she is &quot;SINless&quot;, having been an unrecorded birth and never having been issued a &quot;Single Identity Number&quot;. This would give her the advantage of being more difficult to track in the cyberspace environment. Critic Larry McCaffery asserts that the name &quot;Molly&quot; is a reference to her status as a gun moll.

William Gibson has stated that he derived inspiration for the character from the image of Chrissie Hynde on the cover of the first Pretenders album.

== Augmentations ==
Molly&#x27;s metabolism, sensory input, and reflexes are artificially heightened by means of electronic implants and other advanced medical procedures. She has razor-sharp retractable blades underneath her fingernails, each double-edged and four centimeters in length. Appearing at first glance to be wearing mirrored sunglasses, Molly has in fact had her eye sockets sealed with vision-enhancing mirrored lenses, installed by the skilled black-market surgeons of Chiba City. To accommodate the inset lenses her tear ducts have been re-routed to her mouth; on the very rare occasions she cries, she either spits out or swallows the tears. She never lets others touch the lenses as it would leave messy fingerprints requiring extra cleaning.

== Portrayal in other media ==
The 1995 film version of &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; replaced Molly with a character named Jane who did not have modifications to her eyes or to her fingers. Jane did share the modified nervous system but used a single razor attached to the tip of a flexible spring rod as a weapon.

In the 2003 BBC Radio adaptation of &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, Molly was played by the English actress Nicola Walker. Sasha Grey took on the role in &quot;Case&quot;, a six-hour dramatic contemporary adaptation of the novel staged in New York City in November 2009.

== Literary analysis ==
The character has been described as one of Gibson&#x27;s most complex characters.

== References in pop culture ==

Molly is the subject of a song called &quot;Mirrorshades&quot; by the group Information Society.

<text>Sinchi Roca, Sinchi Rocca, Cinchi Roca (in Hispanicized spellings), Sinchi Ruq&#x27;a or Sinchi Ruq&#x27;a Inka (Quechua for &quot;valorous generous Inca&quot;) () was the second Sapa Inca of the Kingdom of Cusco (beginning around 1230 CE, though as early as 1105 CE according to some) and a member of the Hurin dynasty (first dynasty).

== Family==
Said to have been the son of two of the original Inca siblings, Manco Capac and Mama Ocllo, whom they conceived in Huaynacancha. He was Manco Capac&#x27;s successor and continued the rule after his father&#x27;s death.

The father of Lloque Yupanqui.

His wife was Mama Cura, of the lineage Sanu, daughter of Sitic-huaman. They had a son named Sapaca. Manco Capac, Mama Huaco, Sinchi Rocca, and Manco Sapaca erected the House of the Sun.

== Reign==
The Kingdom of Cuzco later became Tahuantinsuyu (Inca empire) under the rule of Pachacuti. In one of the Inca foundation myths, Sinchi Roca led his family to the valley of Cuzco.

He is said to have created a territorial division of his domains and is considered to be the initiator of the first census of the Inca population.

He also ordered all members of his ethnic group (Inca) to pierce their ears as a sign of nobility.

The 16th century Spanish writers, including Cabello de Balboa quoted by María Rostworowski, also affirm that Sinchi Roca would have been the first Inca to use Mascapaicha or Maskaypacha (Quechua: &quot;Mask&#x27;ay&quot; seek; &quot;Pacha&quot; land, world, or space-time), which would become the distinctive sign of Inca sovereignty. Among the Incas, the imperial crown was composed of several elementsː the mascapaicha, the most important, was a fringe of red wool, ordered on the forehead because each of its strands &quot;passed through a small tube of gold&quot;. Above this fringe were two or three black and white feathers of the sacred bird Korekenke (or Andean mountain caracara ). This fringe and feathers were secured on the forehead by a turban or headband known as the llautu or llauto consisting of a multicoloured braid &quot;of extremely fine vicuña wool&quot;, wrapped several times around the head. The mascapaicha was the mark of absolute imperial power, to the point that &quot;to take&quot; or &quot;to gird the mascapaicha&quot; or &quot;to claim the scarlet fringe&quot; was the periphrase in use to signify the coming of the new emperor or Sapa Inca, during a ceremony where he received it from the hands of the Willaq Umu, the high priest or pontiff of the Inca religion.

One of the stories told about Sinchi Roca was that during his reign a llama shepherd had entered his house and took a young woman whom he cherished very well. The Inca then had them captured and tortured him to tell why he had committed such a sin; the young woman, not wanting to see the villager tortured anymore, revealed that she had fallen in love with the llamamichi (shepherd of llamas) as soon as he saw him wearing a wacanqui (amulet of love), and the shepherd confessed, in turn, that he had received such an object from a demon in a cave.

=== Building program ===
The chronicler Pedro Cieza de León states that Sinchi Roca built terraces and imported enormous quantities of soil in order to improve the fertility of the valley.

&quot;Sinchi&quot; came to be used as the title for a warlord, while &quot;Cápac&quot;, one of his father&#x27;s names, became the title for a sovereign.

<doc id="893953" wikidata="Q5447181" url="?curid=893953" title="Fielding restrictions (cricket)">
<text>In the sport of cricket, different fielding restrictions are imposed depending on the type of match. They are used to discourage certain bowling tactics, or to encourage the batsmen to play big shots, enabling them to hit fours and sixes. Each team has nine fielders other than the wicket-keeper and bowler. The captain decides the fielding positions usually after consulting with the bowler. In Test cricket matches, the fielding restrictions are relaxed as compared to a One Day International.

==All forms==
In all forms of cricket, only two fielders are allowed in the quadrant between the fielding positions of &quot;square leg&quot; and &quot;long stop&quot;. This is to prevent the outlawed and controversial bodyline tactics from being used. No fielder is allowed on or over the pitch until the batsman has had a chance to play the ball.

==One day cricket==
Various rules concerning fielding have applied during the history of one day cricket, with the dual aim of encouraging the batsman to play attacking shots and to prevent the fielding team from being too defensive by posting all their fielders on the boundary. The current rules applying to One Day Internationals were first introduced as trial rules in July 2001, and are also used for some other limited overs tournaments.

===Men&#x27;s Fielding Restriction Circles===
An oval shall be made by drawing two semi-circles on the field of play. The semi-circles shall have as their centre the middle stump at either end of the pitch. The radius of each of the semi-circles shall be . The semi-circles shall be linked by lines which are drawn parallel to the pitch. This line, is commonly known as the circle. Further, two circles centered on each wicket of radius are drawn and combined encompasses an area known as the &quot;close infield.&quot; During the first 10 overs of a 50-over innings a maximum of two fielders are allowed to be deployed in the outfield. Before July 2015, a minimum of two fielders (other than the bowler and wicket-keeper) had to be deployed in the close infield during Powerplay 1. If the number of overs in the innings is restricted to less than 24, the length of the fielding restrictions is reduced to eight or nine overs. At least 3 fielders must remain on either the Off or Leg Side.

T10 cricket has the same restrictions as T20 but for half of the bowling period. In other words: a maximum of two fielders outside the circle for the first six overs.

===Women&#x27;s Fielding Restriction Circles===
In the Women&#x27;s game the infield is smaller than in the Men&#x27;s game but the close infield is the same. The semicircles of the infield have a radius of .

The restriction of having a maximum of three fielders in the outfield is applied for a further two blocks of five overs, with the captains of the fielding and the batting sides deciding the timing of one block each. These five-over spells are called Powerplay 2 and Powerplay 3 and may be shortened if the length of the innings is restricted (Powerplay 1 is the first block of 10). Powerplays were first introduced in the One Day International between England and Australia on 7 July 2005.

For the rest of the innings, a more generous maximum of five fielders in the outfield applies.

===History===
Fielding restrictions were first introduced in the Australian 1980–81 season. By 1992, only two fieldsmen were allowed outside the circle in the first fifteen overs, then five fieldsmen allowed outside the circle for the remaining overs. This was shortened to ten overs in 2005, and two five-over powerplays were introduced, with the bowling team having discretion over the timing for both. In 2008, the batting team was given discretion for the timing of one of the two powerplays. In 2011, the teams were restricted to completing the discretionary powerplays between the 16th and 40th overs; previously, the powerplays could take place at any time between the 11th and 50th overs.

On October 30, 2012, changes to the rules for fielding restrictions in one-day matches were officially implemented by the ICC. The number of Powerplay blocks were reduced to two; the first occurs within the first 10 overs, restricting the team to two fielders outside the 30-yard circle. The second block, the Batting Powerplay with a restriction of three fielders outside the circle, must occur by the 40th over. The number of fielders outside the 30-yard circle in non-Powerplay overs has also been reduced to four (from five).

In June 2015 rules changed to do away with batting powerplay, and allowed up to 5 fielders outside the circle in last 10 overs. The 2015 rule changes also included the removal of batting power play.

==Twenty20==
The number of players in the outfield area is the same as for the One-day format, but the restriction lasts for the first six of the twenty overs, and there is no &quot;Batting&quot; or &quot;Bowling&quot; Powerplay (Powerplays 2 and 3 in ODI&#x27;s).
Whereas in Twenty20 format a team can have maximum of five fielders outside ( for women) after first six overs of twenty overs.

<doc id="893955" wikidata="Q2713959" url="?curid=893955" title="La Crosse encephalitis">
<text>La Crosse encephalitis is an encephalitis caused by an arbovirus (the La Crosse [[virus]]) which has a mosquito vector (&quot;Ochlerotatus triseriatus&quot; synonym &quot;Aedes&quot; &quot;triseriatus&quot;).

La Crosse encephalitis virus (LACV) is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. LAC encephalitis is rare; in the United States, about 80–100 LACV disease cases are reported each year, although it is believed to be under-reported due to minimal symptoms experienced by many of those affected.

== Signs and symptoms ==
It takes 5 to 15 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms of LACV disease. Most people infected with the virus do not have symptoms. Symptoms may include nausea, headache, vomiting and fever in milder cases.

Severe disease occurs most commonly in children under the age of 16 and is characterized by, and seizures, coma, paralysis and permanent brain damage and a variety of neurological sequelae after recovery. Death from LAC encephalitis occurs in less than 1% of clinical cases. In many clinical settings, pediatric cases presenting with CNS involvement are routinely screened for herpes simplex or enteroviral causes. Since there is no specific treatment for LAC encephalitis, physicians often do not request the tests required to specifically identify LAC virus, and the cases are reported as aseptic meningitis or viral encephalitis of unknown cause.

As with many infections, the very young, the very old and the immunocompromised are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms.

== Cause ==
The La Crosse encephalitis virus is a type of arbovirus called a bunyavirus. The Bunyavirales are mainly arboviruses.

Most cases of LAC encephalitis occur in children under 16 years of age. LAC virus is a zoonotic pathogen cycled between the daytime-biting treehole mosquito, &quot;Aedes triseriatus&quot;, and vertebrate amplifier hosts (chipmunks, tree squirrels) in deciduous forest habitats. The virus is maintained over the winter by transovarial transmission in mosquito eggs. If the female mosquito is infected, she may lay eggs that carry the virus, and the adults coming from those eggs may be able to transmit the virus to chipmunks and to humans.

Anyone bitten by a mosquito in an area where the virus is circulating can get infected with LACV. The risk is highest for people who live, work or recreate in woodland habitats, because of greater exposure to potentially infected mosquitoes.

==Diagnosis==
== Prevention ==
People reduce the chance of getting infected with LACV by preventing mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or preventive drug.

Prevention measures against LACV include reducing exposure to mosquito bites. Use repellent such as DEET and picaridin, while spending time outside, especially at during the daytime - from dawn until dusk. &quot;Aedes triseriatus&quot; mosquitoes that transmit (LACV) are most active during the day. Wear long sleeves, pants and socks while outdoors. Ensure all screens are in good condition to prevent mosquitoes from entering your home. &quot;Aedes triseriatus&quot; prefer treeholes to lay eggs in. Also, remove stagnant water such as old tires, birdbaths, flower pots, and barrels.

== Treatment ==
No specific therapy is available at present for La Crosse encephalitis, and management is limited to alleviating the symptoms and balancing fluids and electrolyte levels. Intravenous ribavirin is effective against La Crosse encephalitis virus in the laboratory, and several studies in patients with severe, brain biopsy confirmed, La Crosse encephalitis are ongoing.

In a trial with 15 children being infected with La Crosse viral encephalitis were treated at certain phases with ribavirin (RBV). RBV appeared to be safe at moderate doses. At escalated doses of RBV, adverse events occurred and then the trial was discontinued. Nonetheless, this was the largest study of antiviral treatment for La Crosse encephalitis.

== Epidemiology ==
La Crosse encephalitis was discovered in 1965, after the virus was isolated from stored brain and spinal tissue of a child who died of an unknown infection in La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1960. It occurs in the Appalachian and Midwestern regions of the United States. Recently there has been an increase of cases in the southeastern United States. An explanation to this may be that the mosquito &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; is also an efficient vector of La Crosse virus. &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; is a species that has entered the US and spread across the SE of the US and replaced &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; in most areas (which is not an efficient vector of LAC).

Historically, most cases of LAC encephalitis occur in the upper Midwestern states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio). Recently, more cases are being reported from states in the mid-Atlantic (West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina) and southeastern (Alabama and Mississippi) regions of the country. It has long been suspected that LAC encephalitis has a broader distribution and a higher incidence in the eastern United States, but is under-reported because the causal agent is often not specifically identified.

LAC encephalitis cases occur primarily from late spring through early fall, but in subtropical areas where the mosquito is found (e.g., the Gulf states), rare cases can occur in winter.

According to the CDC, between 2004 and 2013 there were 787 total cases of La Crosse encephalitis and 11 deaths in the U.S.

Looking at the distribution of cases across the United States by state, between 2004 and 2013 the most cases of La Crosse encephalitis was in North Carolina. North Carolina had 184 total cases, followed by Ohio with 178 total cases.

== Related conditions ==
Similar diseases that are spread by mosquitoes include: Western and Eastern equine encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Saint Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus.

<text>John Dhani Lennevald (born 24 July 1984) is a Swedish songwriter, record producer, and Pop/R&amp;B dancer and singer. He is a member of the Swedish pop band A*Teens, and briefly pursued a solo recording career after the band was dissolved.

== Career ==

===A-Teens (1998–2004)===
In 1998, at the age of 14, Lennevald signed a record deal with Stockholm Records (part of Universal Music Group) along with his band mates then, who performed together as the A-Teens. In 1999, they released their first single, a cover of &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; of the famous band ABBA. The single topped the charts in Sweden for eight consecutive weeks and was successful in other countries.

By 2000, the A-Teens&#x27; first album, &quot;The ABBA Generation&quot; had sold 4 million copies and they became one of the most successful Swedish bands around the world.

After 6 years together and more than 9 million albums sold, the A-Teens parted ways, having done their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album and a final tour in Sweden.

===Solo career===
The A-Teens having disbanded in 2004, Lennevald returned to studio to write and record new songs. &quot;Girl Talk&quot; was the introduction to Lennevald&#x27;s solo career. 

Lennevald approached the record company with five new songs, just one and a half weeks after the end of the tour. He created a new sound, assisted by producer Peter Björklund, in which his voice is the prime focus. His first release was a kind of tragedy/comedy about the inability of men to really understand what their girlfriends are trying to say to them.

The video for &quot;Girl Talk&quot;, directed by Mikeadelica, also involved Denmark’s biggest rap artists, Nik &amp; Jay.

&quot;Girl Talk&quot; was released on radio on August 12, 2004 getting high rotation on the most important radio stations in Sweden. The single was released on September 15, 2004 and reached #20 on the Swedish Charts and earned a Gold Certification.

After the release of his single, Lennevald worked as a model, appearing in several fashion magazines and participating in fashion shows in his native Sweden.

In 2005 Lennevald and Universal Music parted ways. Also in 2005, a song clip called &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; leaked on the Internet and Lennevald appeared on shows in Sweden promoting his image and new songs.

Since then, Lennevald has worked as a music producer and songwriter and collaborated with Måns Zelmerlöw, Anton Ewald and Carl Falk.

== Personal life ==
In 2007, Lennevald was reported to be in a relationship with former glamour model Natacha Peyre. In 2008, the couple relocated from Stockholm to Los Angeles.
Lennevald had returned to Europe by the mid-2010s, and according to Instagram postings of 2021, he began a relationship with British singer Alice Chater.

In 2023, Lennevald moved back to Los Angeles with his girlfriend.

<doc id="893962" wikidata="Q7864166" url="?curid=893962" title="UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine">
<text>The University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine is the largest veterinary school in the United States. Established in 1948, the school is the primary health resource for California&#x27;s animal populations. In 2020, the school was again ranked first in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and in 2022, ranked second in the world by QS World University Rankings. The school is located in the southwest corner of the main campus of the University of California, Davis. The current dean of veterinary medicine is Dr. Mark Stetter.

The school focuses on students of the professional Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program, the Master of Preventive Veterinary Medicine program, graduate clinical residency programs, and graduate academic MS and PhD programs. The School of Veterinary Medicine provides educational, research, clinical service, and public service programs to advance the health and care of animals, the health of the environment, and public health.

The school addresses the health of all animals, including livestock, poultry, companion animals, captive and free-ranging wildlife, exotic animals, birds, aquatic mammals and fish, and animals used in biological and medical research. The school&#x27;s expertise also encompasses related human health concerns, such as public health and the concept of One Health.

The school runs 28 research and clinical programs, including clinical referral services; diagnostic testing services; continuing education; extension; and community outreach.

==Departments==
The school has six academic departments:
* Anatomy, Physiology &amp; Cell Biology
* Molecular Biosciences
* Medicine and Epidemiology
* Pathology, Microbiology &amp; Immunology
* Population Health and Reproduction
* Surgical and Radiological Sciences

The school switched to a new DVM curriculum starting with the class of 2015. This curriculum had been in development for 5 years. In the new curriculum, 75% of the material is didactic curriculum core material and 25% is elective material. In the first year, students gain a solid understanding of the normal structure, function and homeostasis of animals. Year two is focused on pathophysiology and mechanisms of disease of animals. The third year is aimed at teaching the manifestations of animal diseases including history, diagnosis, therapeutic and prevention strategies. The fourth year is clinical work, which is broken up into nine different tracks from which a student may choose. The tracks are Equine Track, Equine/Small Animal Track, Food Animal Track, Food/Small Animal Track, Large Animal Track, Mixed Animal Track, Small Animal Track, Zoological Track and Individual Track.

==Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital==

The William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH) at the University of California, Davis — a unit of the School of Veterinary Medicine — is open to the public. Faculty and resident clinicians along with supervised students treat more than 50,000 animals a year, ranging from cats and dogs to horses, livestock, and exotic species. The hospital provides 24/7 emergency services for those first four categories. The hospital also provides emergency services seven days a week during regular business hours for exotic animals. 

The current hospital, along with five support buildings, opened in 1970. The VMTH provides training opportunities and clinical experiences for DVM students and postgraduate veterinarian residents. These residents are trained under the faculty&#x27;s tutelage to be board-certified specialists in one of 34 specialty areas. 

Like the UC system&#x27;s hospitals for human patients, the VMTH cannot cure every patient—meaning that it has to deal with its share of complaints from dissatisfied pet owners. In August 2016, news coverage of several pet owners&#x27; complaints about expensive and ineffective care at the VMTH drew public attention to the fact that veterinarians working there were exempt from licensing by the California Department of Consumer Affairs. Thus, DCA&#x27;s Veterinary Medical Board had no jurisdiction over VMTH vets, in contrast with vets in private practice who had been regulated by DCA and its predecessors for many years. UC Davis&#x27;s chief veterinary medicine officer noted in a statement that at the time, the VMTH was treating about 41,000 small animals per year, but received on average less than 20 written complaints per year. In 2017, the academic exemption from veterinarian licensing was removed and a University Veterinary License was created for VMTH vets participating in patient care.

The hospital operates UC Veterinary Medical Center — San Diego at satellite facilities which opened in 2000 and 2008 to provide hemodialysis and cardiology services to Southern California pets (i.e., specialized services which the vast majority of veterinarians cannot provide). In March 2024, UC Davis bought a San Diego office building and began renovating the building into a veterinary hospital set to open in fall 2025. Like Davis, the new satellite hospital in San Diego will offer 24/7 emergency services.

==Notable programs==
The School of Veterinary Medicine was on the forefront of research into the 2007 pet food recalls. Other areas of research include chronic progressive lymphedema in horses and H1N1 influenza.

Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding with the California Department of Fish and Game, the school&#x27;s Wildlife Health Center administers the Oiled Wildlife Care Network (OWCN) on behalf of the government of California. OWCN directly operates facilities for the cleaning and rehabilitation of oiled wildlife at Cordelia and San Pedro, and in emergencies can also draw upon the resources of 23 participating organizations.

The SeaDoc Society is an affiliated nonprofit with the veterinary school and the schools Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center.

==Discoveries and distinctions==

* Leads the nation&#x27;s 30 accredited veterinary schools and colleges with more than $70 million in annual research funding.
* Faculty members that have been honored as members of the National Academy of Sciences or National Academy of Medicine include: Roy Doi, Bruce Hammock, Harris Lewin, Jonna Mazet, Stephen Barthold, Patricia Conrad, Tilahun Yilma, Michael Lairmore and Christine Kreuder Johnson.
* Five faculty members (Terrell Holliday [1998]; Gary P Carlson [2004]; Richard W Nelson [2012]; Bradford Smith [2019]; and Mark D Kittleson [2022]) have received the Robert W. Kirk Award for Professional Excellence from the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine in recognition of outstanding achievements and dedicated service to the veterinary profession.
* The PREDICT initiative, led by the school&#x27;s One Health Institute, was awarded $175 million by USAID to help detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases in more than 30 countries worldwide. Infectious disease scientists developed SpillOver open-source web application developed, launched in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic as a virus and host risk assessment tool
* Pioneered animal DNA Testing, including the discovery of a mutation in gene NKX2-8, that causes spinal dysraphism in dogs and could show clues about neural tube defects in humans, including spina bifida and anencephaly.
* Pioneered a new mandibular reconstruction procedure. Whiskey, a Munsterlander dog, received mandibular reconstruction after losing his jaw due to a cancerous growth. This new procedure uses a titanium plate in the form of a jawbone which contains a bone growth protein. Over time, the cells proliferate and give rise to an artificial jaw made of material that resembles natural bone.
* Identified mutations in the genes DLX5, DLX6 and &quot;ADAMTS20&quot; that are associated with cleft palate and cleft lips in dogs and humans.
* Researchers first described simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) in monkeys and feline immunodeficiency viruses (FIV) in cats, which became the earliest animal models for AIDS research.
* In 1989, the International Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Tropical Disease and virologist Tilahun Yilma developed a genetically engineered vaccine for rinderpest and an inexpensive diagnostic kit designed to be stable under field conditions. In areas of Africa that depend on cattle for meat, milk products, and work, the rinderpest virus has caused famine and economic damage -$500 million in one outbreak of the 1980s.
* Much of the school&#x27;s research focuses on identifying, treating, and preventing various diseases in animals. The J-5 vaccine against the E. coli infections that lead to bovine mastitis was formulated as a result of research conducted at UC Davis.
* Notable discoveries by faculty of the school include feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), taurine deficiency as the cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in domestic cats, and the first genetic cause of a heart disease in domestic cats (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)).

<doc id="893963" wikidata="Q2551272" url="?curid=893963" title="Hypereosinophilic syndrome">
<text>Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a disease characterized by a persistently elevated eosinophil count (≥ 1500 eosinophils/mm³) in the blood for at least six months without any recognizable cause, with involvement of either the heart, nervous system, or bone marrow.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome can manifest in many different ways from nonspecific symptoms and fatigue to neurological impairment and endomyocardial fibrosis, which may be fatal.

There are three different variants of hypereosinophilic syndrome, myeloproliferative, lymphocytic, and idiopathic.

HES is a diagnosis of exclusion, after clonal eosinophilia (such as &quot;FIP1L1-PDGFRA&quot;-fusion induced hypereosinophelia and leukemia) and reactive eosinophilia (in response to infection, autoimmune disease, atopy, hypoadrenalism, tropical eosinophilia, or cancer) have been ruled out.

There are some associations with chronic eosinophilic leukemia as it shows similar characteristics and genetic defects. If left untreated, HES is progressive and fatal. It is treated with glucocorticoids such as prednisone. The addition of the monoclonal antibody mepolizumab may reduce the dose of glucocorticoids.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Depending on eosinophil target-organ infiltration, the clinical presentation of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) varies from patient to patient. Individuals with myeloproliferative variant HES may be more likely to experience mucosal ulcerations involving the genitalia or airways, while patients with lymphocytic variant HES typically exhibit prominent skin symptoms such as urticarial plaques, angioedema, and erythroderma. Myeloproliferative variant HES is far more common in men and is typically linked to symptoms more typical of myeloproliferative disorders, including anemia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and fibrotic disease (particularly of the heart).

Patients can develop a range of nonspecific symptoms, including fever, diarrhea, rash, angioedema, weakness, exhaustion, coughing, and dyspnea.

The common and non-specific cutaneous manifestations are either erythematous, itchy papules and nodules that resemble eczema, or urticarial and angioedematous lesions. These types of lesions are frequently the main clinical consequence of hypereosinophilia in patients with lymphocytic-HES.

Cardiac involvement typically progresses through three phases. Rarely, the early necrotic stage involving the endo-myocardium manifests as acute heart failure. In most cases, however, there are no symptoms. A thrombotic stage ensues after this one, during which thrombi form in the cardiac chambers along the injured endocardium and may separate, resulting in peripheral emboli. Endomyocardial fibrosis causes irreversible restrictive cardiomyopathy in the final stage of fibrosis, and damage to the atrioventricular valves may cause more acute presentations of congestive heart failure.

Both the peripheral (polyneuropathy) and central (diffuse encephalopathy) nervous systems may be affected by neurological manifestations. Disorientation, memory loss, and altered behavior and cognitive function are the symptoms of diffuse encephalopathy. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathies can include mixed sensory and motor complaints, symmetric or asymmetric sensory alterations, or pure motor deficits. Stroke or brief ischemic episodes can happen after intracardiac thrombi have been embolised peripherally. In certain patients, procoagulant therapy may result in thrombosis of the intracranial veins (lateral sinus and/or longitudinal vein). This condition is linked to persistent hypereosinophilia.

When there are no radiological abnormalities, lung involvement can vary from a persistent dry cough and/or bronchial hyperreactivity to restrictive disease with pulmonary infiltrates. There have been isolated reports of acute respiratory distress syndrome development. Chronic illness may lead to the development of pulmonary fibrosis.

Hematological manifestations include thrombocytopenia, anemia, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. Patients may occasionally exhibit mild lymphadenopathy.

HES patients may experience coagulation problems. It is thought that long-term hypereosinophilia may both directly stimulate coagulation and damage the endovascular surface, which would explain peripheral vasculopathy.

Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting are a few examples of gastrointestinal symptoms. There may be colitis, enterocolitis, or eosinophilic gastritis; if eosinophilic infiltrates affect the intestinal wall&#x27;s deeper layers, colitis may be linked to ascitis.

== Causes ==
While some HES patients have eosinophilia in conjunction with known myeloid malignancies, others do not have a known malignancy but do have laboratory or bone marrow abnormalities, such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and eosinophil-related tissue damage and fibrosis, that are frequently associated with myeloproliferative disease. The diagnosis of myeloproliferative HES is made for these individuals.

Eosinophilia in lymphocytic HES is caused by populations of activated T lymphocytes producing more eosinophil hematopoietins, specifically interleukin-5 (IL-5).

Severe eosinophilia with an unknown etiology that manifests in successive generations is known as familial hypereosinophilia syndrome (HES).

== Mechanism ==
It is possible that several mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology of HES because of the clinical heterogeneity of its patients.

Despite the lack of knowledge regarding the precise mechanism underlying eosinophil-induced tissue damage, eosinophil accumulation seems to have pathological outcomes. Eosinophils cause direct cytotoxicity by releasing harmful substances locally, such as enzymes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, cationic proteins, and factors derived from arachidonic acid. The extent of end-organ damage varies, and the severity of organ damage is frequently unrelated to the degree or duration of eosinophilia.

== Diagnosis ==
Numerous techniques are used to diagnose hypereosinophilic syndrome, of which the most important is blood testing. In HES, the eosinophil count is greater than 1.5 × 109/L. On some smears the eosinophils may appear normal in appearance, but morphologic abnormalities, such as a lowering of granule numbers and size, can be observed. Roughly 50% of patients with HES also have anaemia.

Secondly, various imaging and diagnostic technological methods are utilised to detect defects to the heart and other organs, such as valvular dysfunction and arrhythmias by means of echocardiography. Chest radiographs may indicate pleural effusions and/or fibrosis, and neurological tests such as CT scans can show strokes and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure.

A proportion of patients have a mutation involving the &quot;PDGFRA&quot; and &quot;FIP1L1&quot; genes on the fourth chromosome, leading to a tyrosine kinase fusion protein. Testing for this mutation is now routine practice, as its presence indicates a likely response to imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

Chusid et al. developed empirical diagnostic standards for idiopathic HES in 1975:

# More than 1,500/mL of blood eosinophilia for more than six months in a row, along with hypereosinophilic disease signs and symptoms.
# Lack of an underlying cause for hypereosinophilia after a full diagnostic assessment.
# Organ dysfunction or damage as a result of eosinophils&#x27; toxic contents being released locally.
Since there isn&#x27;t a particular diagnostic test for HES, the syndrome is diagnosed by exclusion. Differential diagnosis includes drug hypersensitivity reactions, parasitic infections, sarcoid, advanced HIV infection, inflammatory bowel disease, lymphoid neoplasms, and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.

=== Classification ===
Myeloproliferative HES (M-HES) and lymphocytic HES (L-HES) are the two main categories of HES, along with a few other clearly defined clinical entities.

== Treatment ==
As a first-line treatment for HES patients&#x27; symptoms, corticosteroids are recommended. Because high-dose prednisone rapidly lowers eosinophil levels, it is usually started at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day. Upon achieving appropriate control over eosinophilia, the medication can be gradually reduced.

Steroid-refractory HES has been managed with a variety of cytotoxic treatments. Out of all of them, hydroxyurea has been researched the most and has been linked to few side effects at doses as high as 2 g per day.

It has been demonstrated that immunomodulatory drugs, such as interferon-alpha, cyclosporine, and intravenous immunoglobulin, that influence Th2 cytokine production and T cell proliferation can be therapeutically effective in HES.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as the first treatment for HES.

An option for patients who have not responded to conventional treatment regimens is a stem cell transplant.

== Outlook ==
The prognosis for HES was extremely poor when the syndrome was first described; however, due to a variety of factors, including earlier detection of complications, improved surgical management of cardiac and valvular disease, and the use of a wider range of therapeutic molecules to control hypereosinophilia, the prognosis has steadily and significantly improved over time.

Patients without chronic heart failure and those who respond well to pharmaceutical treatments have a good prognosis. However, the mortality rate rises in patients with anaemia, chromosome abnormalities or a very high white blood cell count.

== Epidemiology ==
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) estimated the prevalence of HES at the time of granting orphan drug designation for HES in 2004 at 1.5 in 100,000 people, corresponding to a current case load of about 8,000 in the EU, 5,000 in the U.S., and 2,000 in Japan.

== History ==
In 1968, the term &quot;hypereosinophilic syndrome&quot; was created to group patients who had several closely related conditions that were all marked by persistently elevated peripheral blood eosinophil levels and organ damage from eosinophilic infiltration.

<text>Embolotherium (Greek , + , &quot;battering ram beast&quot;, or &quot;wedge beast&quot;) is an extinct genus of brontothere that lived in Mongolia during the late Eocene epoch. It is most easily recognized by a large bony protuberance emanating from the anterior (front) of the skull. This resembles a battering ram, hence the name &quot;Embolotherium&quot;. The animal is known from about 12 skulls, several jaws, and a variety of other skeletal elements from the Ulan Gochu formation of Inner Mongolia as well as the Ergilin Dzo Formation of Outer Mongolia.

==Taxonomy==

Several species of &quot;Embolotherium&quot; have been named, including &quot;Embolotherium andrewsi&quot;, &quot;Embolotherium grangeri&quot;, &quot;Embolotherium louksi&quot;, &quot;Embolotherium ultimum&quot;, &quot;Embolotherium ergilensi&quot;, and &quot;Embolotherium efremovi&quot;. However, only two species, &quot;Embolotherium andrewsi&quot; and &quot;Embolotherium grangeri&quot;, appear to be valid. Other supposed species of &quot;Embolotherium&quot; are probably synonymous with these two species and were originally based on juvenile skulls, poorly preserved fossil material, or specimens that are not significantly different from either &quot;E. andrewsi&quot; or &quot;E. grangeri&quot;.

Another genus of brontothere, &quot;Titanodectes&quot;, which was named for several lower jaws found in the same sedimentary deposits as &quot;Embolotherium&quot;, probably represents the same beast as &quot;Embolotherium grangeri&quot;. &quot;Protembolotherium&quot; is another closely related genus from the Middle Eocene, which is distinguished by a noticeably smaller ram.

==Description==
 The skull reaches a condylobasal length of 920 mm. Complete skeletons of &quot;Embolotherium&quot; have not yet been recovered, although many postcranial elements referable to it have been collected. The postcranial skeleton of Embolotherium suggests a powerful, graviportal animal with a close resemblance to the late Eocene North American brontothere Megacerops, which it rivaled or somewhat exceeded in size, making Embolotherium one of the largest brontotheres, if not the largest. Unlike many of the other Late Eocene brontotheres, there is no clear evidence that &quot;Embolotherium&quot; was sexually dimorphic. All known specimens have large rams. Therefore, coupled with the fact that the rams were hollow and fragile in comparison to the solid and sturdy horns of the North American brontotheres, such as &quot;Megacerops&quot;, it does not seem likely that the ram served as a weapon for contests between males. Rather, it might have had a non-sexual function, such as signaling to each other. The ram may have served as a specialized resonator for sound production. This hypothesis is suggested by the fact that the bony nasal cavity extends to the peak of the ram, thus implying that the nasal chamber was greatly elevated, possibly creating a resonating chamber.

<text>A number of Korean dialects are spoken in Korea and by the Korean diaspora. The peninsula is very mountainous and each dialect&#x27;s &quot;territory&quot; corresponds closely to the natural boundaries between different geographical regions of Korea. Most of the dialects are named for one of the traditional Eight Provinces of Korea. Two are sufficiently distinct from the others to be considered separate languages, the Jeju and the Yukjin languages.

==Dialect areas==


Korea is a mountainous country, and this could be the main reason why Korean is divided into numerous small local dialects. There are few clear demarcations, so dialect classification is necessarily to some extent arbitrary and based on the traditional provinces.
A common classification, originally introduced by Shinpei Ogura in 1944 and adjusted by later authors, identifies six dialect areas:
;Hamgyŏng (Northeastern)
:Spoken in the Hamgyong Province (Kwanbuk and Kwannam) region, the northeast corner of Pyongan Province, and the Ryanggang Province of North Korea as well as Jilin, Heilongjiang of Northeast China; Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan of former Soviet Union. Nine vowels: the eight of the standard language plus ö. 
;Pyongan (Northwestern)
:Spoken in Pyongyang, Pyongan Province, Chagang Province, and neighboring Liaoning, of China. In North Korea, the standard language known as Munhwaŏ is designated as &quot;Pyongyang Speech.&quot; However, the &quot;Pyongan dialect&quot; is still considered a dialect unless it is explicitly designated as part of Munhwaŏ.
;Central dialects
:The central dialect refers to a dialect generally used in the surrounding areas of Hwanghae Province, Gangwon Province (Kangwon Province), and Chungcheong Province, centering on Seoul and Gyeonggi Province. Depending on scholars, it is divided into the Gyeonggi dialect (Central dialect) and Chungcheong dialect from the beginning, or subdivided into Gyeonggi dialect, Gangwon dialect, Hwanghae dialect, and Chungcheong dialect. The central dialect region is very large, so it is not easy to extract features common to all regions. Among its characteristics, it is more difficult to extract the unique characteristics of the central dialect. For example, which dialect has an intonation as a phonological list is very important in the dialect compartment. Most of the central dialects do not have intonations, but they have intonations in Yeongdong, Gangwon Province, as well as Pyeongchang, Jeongseon, and Yeongwol, the surrounding Yeongseo regions. In the case of vocabulary, the difference is so severe that we do not know how many pieces the central dialect will be divided into. Therefore, the characteristics of the central dialect, which correspond to all regions of the central dialect region, are extremely rare, and if there is such a feature, it is easy to be found in other dialects rather than just the central dialect. Therefore, it may be close to the fact that it is the central dialect that combines the remaining dialects except for other dialects where distinct characteristics are observed, rather than having a specific phenomenon observed only in the central dialect. Since the central dialect consists of sub-dialects that are more heterogeneous than other dialects, it is more likely to be divided into several sub-dialects than any other dialect. Usually, it seems that it can be divided into five sub-dialects.
:*Gyeonggi dialect, also called the &quot;Seoul dialect&quot;: spoken in the Gyeonggi Province, Seoul and Incheon cities, as well as in Kaesong, Kaepung and Changpung (North Korea). The basis of the standard language for South Korea. Although it is often called Gyeonggi dialect by combining Gyeonggi dialect and Seoul dialect, Seoul has been the capital of Joseon for more than 500 years, so the Seoul dialect is often classified separately because the royal language is permeated. And, it is sometimes called the Gyeonggi dialect by combining the Gyeonggi dialect and the Yeongseo dialect.
:*Chungcheong dialect: spoken in the Chungcheong Province (Hoseo) region of South Korea, including the metropolitan city of Daejeon. The dialect of Chungcheong Province is a dialect with the most elements of the Jeolla dialect among the Central dialects, and can also be divided into the other. Some parts of South Chungcheong Province, including Daejeon and Sejong, are classified as southern dialects such as the Jeolla and Gyeongsang dialects.
:*Yeongseo dialect: spoken in Yeongseo, Gangwon Province (South Korea) and neighboring Kangwon Province (North Korea) to the west of the Taebaek Mountains. Yeongseo is quite distinct from the Yeongdong dialect to the east of the mountains. Unlike the Yeongdong dialect, the Yeongseo dialect has not been studied much because it is almost similar to the Gyeonggi dialect, and scholars often see it as just a part of Gyeonggi dialect.
:*Yeongdong dialect: spoken in Yeongdong, Gangwon Province (South Korea) and neighboring Kangwon Province (North Korea) to the east of the Taebaek Mountains. Yeongdong is quite distinct from the Central Korean dialects to the west of the mountains. There are many elements of the Gyeongsang dialect, and sometimes the Hamgyŏng dialect is mixed, and it has many characteristics that are not present in the rest of the Central dialect.
:*Hwanghae dialect: spoken in Hwanghae Province of North Korea. The Hwanghae dialect is a dialect with the most elements of the Pyongan dialect among the Central dialects, and can also be divided into the other. Hwanghae dialect was commonly included among the Central dialects, but some researchers argue that it does not fit there comfortably. Because the division between South Korea and North Korea has prolonged, the Hwanghae dialect has been strongly influenced by the Pyongan dialect, and now more and more people see it as a sub-dialect of the Pyongan dialect, not the Central dialect.
:In any case, the central dialect can be said to be a dialect that can vary in various areas of the dialect depending on the criteria for the dialect compartment. For example, Hwanghae, Gyeonggi, Gangwon and Chungcheong are usually grouped together as the Central dialect region. But, many view that only Hwanghae, Gyeonggi, and Gangwon dialects are included in the central dialect, while Chungcheong dialect is considered as separate dialect.
;Gyeongsang (Southeastern)
:Spoken in Gyeongsang Province (Yeongnam) of South Korea, including the cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. This dialect is easily distinguished from the Seoul dialect because its pitch is more varied. Six vowels, &quot;i, e, a, eo, o, u&quot;.
;Jeolla (Southwestern)
:Spoken in the Jeolla Province (Honam) region of South Korea, including the city of Gwangju. Ten vowels: &quot;i, e, ae, a, ü, ö, u, o, eu, eo.&quot;
;Jeju
:Spoken on Jeju Island off the southwest coast of South Korea and is sometimes considered a separate Koreanic language. The nine vowels of Middle Korean, including &quot;arae-a&quot; (ɔ). May have additional consonants as well.
Several linguists have suggested that a further dialect area should be split from the Northeastern dialects:
;Ryukchin (Yukchin)
:Spoken in the historical Yukchin region which is located in the northern part of North Hamgyong Province, far removed from P&#x27;yŏng&#x27;an, but has more in common with P&#x27;yŏng&#x27;an dialects than with the surrounding Hamgyŏng dialects. Since it has been isolated from the major changes of Korean language, it has preserved distinct features of Middle Korean. It is the only known tonal Korean language.

A recent statistical analysis of these dialects suggests that the hierarchical structure within these dialects are highly uncertain, meaning that there is no quantitative evidence to support a family-tree-like relationship among them.

Some researchers classify the Korean dialects in Western and Eastern dialects. Compared with Middle Korean, the Western dialects have preserved long vowels, while the Eastern dialects have preserved tones or pitch accent. The Jeju language and some dialects in North Korean make no distinction between vowel length or tone. But the Southeastern dialect and the Northeastern dialect may not be closely related to each other genealogically.

==Standard language==
Korean is a pluricentric language:
* In South Korea, Standard Korean () is defined by the National Institute of the Korean Language as &quot;the modern speech of Seoul widely used by the well-cultivated&quot;. It is very similar to Incheon, most of Gyeonggi and the western part of Gangwon (Yeongseo region).
* In North Korea, the adopting proclamation stated that the language spoken in the capital of Pyongyang should serve as the basis for the North Korean standard language (, &#x27;cultured language&#x27;). However, in &quot;Guidelines on the Juche-Oriented Development of the Korean Language,&quot; Kim Il Sung clarified that “Pyongyang speech is neither a purely local vernacular nor a variant of the Pyongan dialect.”. Thus, official North Korean discourse distinguishes it from being merely a local or mixed dialect. In practice, it remains &quot;firmly rooted&quot; in the Gyeonggi dialect, which had been the national standard for centuries, but incorporates some northern dialect words.
Despite North–South differences in the Korean language, the two standards are still broadly intelligible. One notable feature within the divergence is the North&#x27;s lack of anglicisms and other foreign borrowings due to isolationism and self-reliance—pure/invented Korean words are used in replacement.

Usage of regional dialects have been decreasing in both North and South due to social factors. In North Korea, the central government is urging its citizens to use the northern standard language to prevent the use of foul language by the people: Kim Jong Un said in a speech &quot;if your language in life is cultural and polite, you can achieve harmony and comradely unity among people.&quot; In South Korea, due to relocation in the population to Seoul to find jobs and the usage of standard language in education and media, the prevalence of regional dialects has decreased. The standard is also commonly used among younger Koreans nationwide and in online contexts. It is the form most widely taught internationally, and has received a further boost from the increasing popularity of K-pop.

== Outside of the Korean peninsula ==
Koryo-mar, based on Hamgyong and Ryukchin dialects, is spoken by the Koryo-saram, ethnic Koreans in the post-Soviet states of Central Asia. It consists of a Korean base vocabulary, but takes many loanwords and calques from Russian language.

Sakhalin Korean Language (사할린 한국어), usually identified as a descendant of the southern dialect, is spoken by the Sakhalin Korean.

== Examples of regional dialects ==

=== Hamgyŏng ===
Rasŏn, most of Hamgyŏng region, northeast P&#x27;yŏngan, Ryanggang Province (North Korea), Jilin (China).
* Koreans who have heard the Hamgyŏng dialect describe it as similar in tone to the Gyeongsang and southern Yeongdong dialects.
* It is also the most spoken dialect by North Korean defectors in South Korea, as about 80% of them are from Hamgyŏng Province.
* Koryo-mar, the moribund variety of Korean spoken mainly by elderly in Central Asia and Russia, is descended from the Northern Hamgyong Dialect, as well as the Yukchin Dialect.

; Ordinary way of speaking (near Hamhung, Hyesan)
* The vowel &#x27;ㅔ(e)&#x27; is changed to &#x27;ㅓ(eo)&#x27;.
** example: &quot;Your daughter has come.&quot;

* When calling a superior person, always put the ending &#x27;요(yo)&#x27; after the noun.
** example: &quot;Grandpa, come quickly.&quot;

* The ending &#x27;-니까(-nikka)&#x27; is changed to &#x27;-길래(-gilrae)&#x27;.
** example: &quot;Come early because you have to cultivate the field.&quot;
=== P&#x27;yŏngan ===
P&#x27;yŏngan region, P&#x27;yŏngyang, Chagang, northern North Hamgyŏng (North Korea), Liaoning (China)
* It is also the North Korean dialect best known to South Koreans. However, North Korean defectors also claim that South Koreans have less accurate knowledge of the dialect due to the long division.
; Honorific

; Ordinary way of speaking
* The vowel &#x27;ㅕ(yeo)&#x27; is changed to&#x27;ㅔ(e)&#x27;.
** example: armpit

* If a Sino-Korean word is preceded by a &#x27;ㄹ(r)&#x27; pronunciation, it is pronounced as &#x27;ㄴ(n)&#x27;. At the same time, if &#x27;ㄹ(r)&#x27; is followed by a diphthong containing the [j] sound, the [j] sound is dropped and pronounced as a short vowel.
* In the front part of the pure vocabulary of Middle Korean, [nj] changed to [j] in the Seoul dialect, which changed to [n] in this dialect.
** example: 1) Summer 2) Seven 3) Trend

* When representing the past, there is a dropout phenomenon of &#x27;ㅆ(ss/tt)&#x27;.
** example: &quot;I brought this.&quot;
=== Hwanghae ===
Hwanghae region (North Korea). Also in the Islands of Yeonpyeongdo, Baengnyeongdo and Daecheongdo in Ongjin County of Incheon.
* Some North Korean scholars, such as Kim Byung-je, do not recognize this distinction and consider the West-North and Gyeonggi dialects to be spoken in the region. 
* It is known that dialects are spoken that share characteristics of neighboring regional dialects. It is mainly known to have characteristics of both Gyeonggi and Pyeongan dialects.
; Honorific

; Ordinary way of speaking
* Many of the vowels are pronounced as &#x27;ㅣ(i)&#x27;.
** example: habit

* &#x27;네(ne)&#x27; is used as a questionable form.
** example: &quot;Did you eat?&quot;

* &#x27;-누만(-numan)&#x27; is often used as an exclamation sentence.
** example: &quot;It got a lot colder&quot;

Areas in Northwest Hwanghae, such as Ongjin County in Hwanghae Province, pronounced &#x27;ㅈ&#x27; (&quot;j&quot;&#x27;), originally pronounced the letter more closely to &quot;tz&quot;. However, this has largely disappeared.
The rest is almost similar to the Gyeonggi and Pyongan dialect.

=== Gyeonggi===
Seoul, Incheon, Gyeonggi region (South Korea), as well as Kaeseong, Gaepoong and Changpung in North Korea.
*Seoul dialect, which was the basis of Pyojuneo, is a subdialect of Gyeonggi dialect.
*About 70% of all Seoul dialect vocabulary has been adopted as Pyojuneo, and only about 10% out of 30% of Seoul dialect vocabulary that has not been adopted in Pyojuneo have been used so far.
*Gyeonggi dialect is the least existential dialect in South Korea, and most people do not know that Gyeonggi dialect itself exists. So, Gyeonggi-do residents say they only use standard language, and many people know the language spoken by Gyeonggi-do residents as standard language in other regions.
*Recently, young people have come to realize that there is a dialect in Seoul as they are exposed to the Seoul dialect through media such as YouTube.
*Among the Gyeonggi dialects, the best known dialect along with Seoul dialect is Suwon dialect. The dialects of Suwon and its surrounding areas are quite different from those of northern Gyeonggi Province and surrounding areas of Seoul.
*In some areas of the southern part of Gyeonggi Province, which is close to Chungcheong Province, such as Pyeongtaek and Anseong, it is also included in the Chungcheong dialect area. Local residents living in these areas also admit that they speak Chungcheong dialect.
*Traditionally, coastal areas of Gyeonggi, particularly Incheon, Ganghwa, Ongjin and Gimpo have been recorded to have some influence from the dialects of Hwanghae and Chungcheong, due to historic intermixing with the two regions, as well as geographical proximity. This old influence, however, has largely died out among most middle aged and younger locals from the region.
*Originally, northern Gyeonggi Province, including Seoul, received influence from Northern dialects (Areas of Kaeseong along the Ryesong River, or Ganghwa Island, received an especially high amount of influence from the Hwanghae dialect), while southern Gyeonggi Province was influenced from Chungcheong dialect. However, as a result of the prolonged division and the large number of migrants from Chungcheong Province and Jeolla Province to Seoul, the current way of speaking in Gyeonggi has been greatly influenced by Chungcheong and Jeolla.

Yeongseo (Gangwon (South Korea)/Kangwŏn (North Korea) west of the Taebaek Mountains), Yeongdong (Gangwon (South Korea)/Kangwŏn (North Korea), east of the Taebaek Mountains)
*Gangwon Province is divided between Yeongseo and Yeongdong due to the Taebaek Mountains, so even if it is the same Gangwon Province, there is a significant difference in dialect between the two regions.
*In the case of the Yeongseo dialect, the accent is slightly different from the dialect of Gyeonggi Province, but most of the vocabulary is similar to the dialect of Gyeonggi Province.
*Unlike the Yeongseo dialect, Yeongdong dialect has a tone, such as Hamgyeong dialect and Gyeongsang dialect.
*Gangwon dialect is the least spoken dialect of all dialects in South Korea except Jeju.

*Chungcheong dialect was the most commonly used dialect by aristocrats(Yangban) during the Joseon dynasty, along with dialects in northern Gyeongsang Province.
*In the case of Chungcheong dialect, it is a dialect belonging to the central dialect along with Gyeonggi, Gangwon, and Hwanghae dialects, but some scholars view it as a separate dialect separated from the central dialect. In addition, some scholars classify southern Chungcheong dialect regions such as Daejeon, Sejong, and Gongju as the southern dialect such as Jeolla and Gyeongsang dialects.
; Honorific

; Ordinary way of speaking
* The vowel &#x27;ㅑ(ya)&#x27; that comes to the ending is changed to &#x27;ㅕ(yeo)&#x27;.

*Jeolla dialect is a dialect that feels rough along with Gyeongsang dialect. Especially it is well known for its swearing.
*Jeolla dialect speakers, along with Gyeongsang dialect speakers, have high self-esteem in their local dialects.
*Many Jeolla dialect speakers can be found not only in Jeolla Province but also in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, because Jeolla Province itself was alienated from development, so many Jeolla residents came to Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.
*Much of Northern Jeolla, especially in areas close to Southern Chungcheong like Jeonju, Gunsan and Wanju have traditionally had weaker accents compared to the south, and in some cases, might be more closer to the Chungcheong dialect in terms of vocabulary and intonation.
; Honorific

; Ordinary way of speaking
* The vowel &#x27;ㅢ(ui)&#x27; is pronounced as &#x27;ㅡ(eu)&#x27;.

Famously, natives of Southern Jeolla pronounce certain combinations of vowels in Korean more softly, or omit the latter vowel entirely.

However, in the case of &#x27;모대(modae)&#x27;, it is also observed in South Chungcheong Province and some areas of southern Gyeonggi Province close to South Chungcheong Province.

The rest is almost similar to the Chungcheong dialect.

=== Gyeongsang ===
Busan, Daegu, Ulsan, Gyeongsang region (South Korea)
*The Gyeongsang dialect is one of the best-known South Korean dialects, known not only by Koreans but also by foreigners interested in Korean culture.

*The Gyeongsang dialect is one of the most common dialects employed in K-dramas. 
*The Gyeongsang dialect exhibits internal diversity, with variations in pronunciation and vocabulary that are easily recognized by native speakers of the region.
; Honorific

; Ordinary way of speaking
* When forming questions, speakers primarily employ &#x27;노 (no)&#x27; and &#x27;나 (na)&#x27;. The choice between them reveals the nature of the inquiry. &#x27;나 (na)&#x27; functions as a marker for polar questions, demanding a straightforward &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27; response. In contrast, &#x27;노 (no)&#x27; is attached to questions requiring a more comprehensive explanation.
** example: 1) &quot;Have you eaten?&quot; 2) &quot;What did you eat?&quot;

* When talking, the sentence often ends with &#x27;~다 아이가(~da aiga)&#x27;.
** example: &quot;You said so.&quot;

* &#x27;~하다(~hada)&#x27; is pronounced as &#x27;~카다(~kada)&#x27;.
** example: &quot;Why are you doing that?&quot;
The rest is almost similar to the Jeolla dialect.

=== Jeju ===
Jeju Island/Province (South Korea); sometimes classified as a separate language in the Koreanic language family

example: Hangul
*Pyojuneo: (&quot;Hangul&quot;)
*Jeju: (&quot;Hongul&quot;)

<text>Idyllwild Arts Foundation encompasses two institutions in Idyllwild, California for training in the arts: [[Idyllwild Arts Academy]] (IAA) and the Idyllwild Arts Summer Program. The institution was formerly known as Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts (ISOMATA).

The Idyllwild Arts Foundation is in the San Jacinto Mountains above Palm Springs, California in the San Bernardino National Forest, at an elevation of , and is a 2-hour drive from Los Angeles, 2 hours from San Diego and 1 hour from Palm Springs.

==History==
Idyllwild Arts Foundation was founded by Dr. Max Krone and his wife, Beatrice. They established the Idyllwild Arts Foundation in 1946 and purchased land in the San Jacinto Mountains on which to build. In 1950, approximately one hundred adult students began attending summer classes in the arts.

Over the years, summer activities have continued to grow, expanding to include programs for children of all ages, a Family Camp, Metals Week, Native American Arts Festival, and the Chamber Music Festival. Classes in music, dance, theatre, visual arts, film, writing, and Native American arts are offered to students from age 5 to adult. Each year over 1800 adults and children attend Idyllwild Arts Summer Program courses. Norman Corwin, Ansel Adams, Herbert Zipper, Marguerite N. Clapp, Mark Wilke, Bella Lewitzky, Fritz Scholder, Maria Martinez, Lucy Lewis, Pete Seeger, and Meredith Willson taught courses there in the summer.

In 1964, the school was given to the University of Southern California (USC) under the terms of an agreement with the Idyllwild Arts Foundation. In 1983, the Foundation exercised its option to resume independent management and resumed sole ownership of the school. In 1985, the first independent boarding high school for the arts in the western United States, the Idyllwild Arts Academy, was established.

==Idyllwild Arts Academy==

Idyllwild Arts Academy, the boarding school, offers a college preparatory program for grades 9–12 and post-graduates, with training in music, theater, dance, visual art, creative writing, film, and interdisciplinary arts. An audition or portfolio is required for admission.

==Idyllwild Arts Summer Program==
The Idyllwild Arts Summer Program which began in the summer of 1950, includes more than 95 workshops. These are taught by professional artist-teachers, in dance, music, theatre, visual arts, creative writing, poetry, filmmaking, and Native Arts.

The program for young people features a Children&#x27;s Center whose participants range in age from 5 to 12 and who select classes and workshops in a variety of arts including multi-arts, dance, piano, theatre, visual arts, poetry, and journal writing.

Junior Artist&#x27;s Center (ages 11–13) and Youth Arts Center (ages 13–18) offer courses to accommodate a broad range of skill levels and a wide variety of art experiences. Music opportunities include musical theatre, piano classes, jazz workshops, two bands, two orchestras, and chamber music. Visual artists can select courses from introductory art exploration to ceramics, advanced painting and drawing, jewelry, photography, computer animation, mixed media, and video production. Writers can take poetry, fiction, and playwriting workshops. Dancers participate in ballet, jazz, and modern. Actors may take up to six weeks of Theatre Festival workshops, each of which includes a major performance.

Each year, Idyllwild Arts provides financial aid for young people with limited financial resources: twenty-five percent of young people who participate in an arts workshop are awarded financial aid totaling approximately $500,000.

Part of the program involves theme-related workshops, seminars, and performances featuring artists, poets, and musicians. Programs include: Native American Arts, Metals Week &amp; the Chamber Music Festival.

The culmination of the Summer Program is celebrated with a concert by the Festival Choir, Festival Wind Ensemble, and the Festival Orchestra. In previous years this concert ended with a performance of Meredith Willson&#x27;s &quot;In Idyllwild&quot; by the combined ensembles.

<text>&quot;The Misfortune Cookie&quot; is the third segment of the fourteenth episode of the first season of the television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In this segment, a restaurant critic discovers a Chinese restaurant where the fortune cookies have fortunes which come true.

==Plot==
Harry Folger is a food critic for a major newspaper. Restaurants live or die by his reviews, which often use gratuitously nasty prose in order to draw more readers. Spiting journalistic integrity, Harry usually only visits the restaurants he pans so that he can collect their matchbooks and display them as tombstones in a graveyard scene at his office.

Harry visits a new Chinese restaurant called &quot;Mr. Lee&#x27;s Chinese Cuisine&quot;, orders a massive amount of food and then immediately asks for the check without eating. Assuming Harry was displeased with the food, the owner Mr. Lee apologizes, tells Harry the meal is free, and presents him with a fortune cookie. The fortune reads &quot;A grand reward awaits you just around the corner.&quot;

As Harry walks past an alley, a thief knocks him down and drops $100,000 in diamonds before running away. The grateful jewelry store owner gives Harry $1,000 as a reward. Realizing the fortune cookies are magical, Harry returns for more. When Mr. Lee complains that customers canceled their reservations because of his review, Harry promises to write a more favorable re-review if he is allowed to have a table. After again not touching his food, he receives a fortune that says &quot;April arrives today, bringing romance.&quot; As it is September, Harry storms out, intending to go back on his promise. On the way to his office, he meets a woman asking for directions. He shows her the way and asks her out to dinner. She introduces herself as April Hamilton.

Harry takes her out to Mr. Lee&#x27;s. Harry, again, does not eat any food despite April telling him how good it is. As the two get fortune cookies, April&#x27;s fortune says that she will soon recognize a grievous error in judgment, while Harry&#x27;s fortune says &quot;You&#x27;re going to die.&quot; Outraged, Harry threatens Mr. Lee and causes a scene. Disconcerted, April leaves. As he exits the restaurant, Harry is overcome with massive hunger pangs. He finds that he is on a street of Chinese restaurants that were not there before. He wanders into one restaurant, but is unable to satisfy his hunger. As he continues to endlessly eat, he receives a fortune cookie that says &quot;You&#x27;re dead.&quot; A tombstone with Harry&#x27;s name on it has been added to his matchbook graveyard.

==Origin==

The script is very closely based on the short story of the same name by Charles E. Fritch and published in 1970 in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, later collected in &quot;100 Great Science Fiction Short Short Stories&quot; edited by Isaac Asimov. In the story, rather than meeting April Hamilton, Harry meets an old friend named Cynthia Peters; despite that both are married, they soon fall into a torrid affair, in part due to their mutual love of Chinese food. Harry eventually is found out and finds Cynthia&#x27;s husband and his own wife both pointing guns at him, but makes a narrow escape into the Chinese restaurant, where, as in the episode, the food never fills him up and the fortune cookies all tell him that he is dead.

<text>Jayceon Terrell Taylor (born November 29, 1979), better known by his stage name the Game or simply Game, is an American rapper. Born in Compton, California, he initially released a series of mixtapes under the wing of fellow West Coast rapper JT the Bigga Figga. After releasing his debut album &quot;Untold Story&quot; independently in 2004, he was discovered by record producer Dr. Dre and signed to his Aftermath Records label imprint. The Game rose to fame in 2005 following the release of his major-label debut album &quot;The Documentary&quot;, which peaked the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 along with its 2006 follow-up, &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Advocate&quot;. The former album received double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and two Grammy Award nominations—Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for its single, &quot;Hate It or Love It&quot; (featuring 50 Cent).

A rising artist in the 2000s, the Game was considered to be a driving force in the resurgence of West Coast hip hop into the mainstream, and competing with many of his East Coast counterparts. The Game was placed into G-Unit by Dr. Dre and Interscope Records co-founder Jimmy Iovine. As a result of his disputes with group leader 50 Cent, Game left Aftermath and signed with Geffen, another label under Universal&#x27;s Interscope Geffen A&amp;M corporate unit to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit in 2006. This foresaw the release of &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, which was met with continued success and spawned the singles &quot;It&#x27;s Okay (One Blood)&quot; (featuring Junior Reid), &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride,&quot; and &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t Get Far&quot; (featuring Kanye West).

The Game found similar critical and commercial success with his third and fourth albums &quot;LAX&quot; (2008) and &quot;The R.E.D. Album&quot; (2010), which peaked at numbers two and one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, respectively. His fifth album, &quot;Jesus Piece&quot; (2015) served as his final release with Interscope and peaked within the chart&#x27;s top ten, along with his following independent albums: &quot;The Documentary 2&quot;, &quot;The Documentary 2.5&quot; (2015), and &quot;1992&quot; (2016). His ninth album, &quot;Born 2 Rap&quot; (2019) was announced as his final; however, his career continued with the release of his tenth album &quot;Drillmatic – Heart vs. Mind&quot; (2022), which was met with mixed critical reception.

==Early life==
The Game was born Jayceon Terrell Taylor on November 29, 1979, in Compton, California, to parents George Taylor and Lynette Baker, who both were members of the Crips street gang. He grew up in a primarily Crip-controlled neighborhood known as Santana Blocc, although Taylor himself grew up to become a member of the Cedar Block Piru Bloods through his brother. In an October 2006 interview with MTV News correspondent Sway Calloway, the Game described his family as &quot;dysfunctional&quot;. His older half-brother, George Taylor III, a.k.a. the rapper Big Fase 100, was a Cedar Block Piru Bloods leader in West Compton, California.

Taylor and his sibling spent six years in foster care. Taylor attended Compton High School. He went on to attend the community colleges Antelope Valley College, Harbor Community College and Cerritos College each for a time before leaving school.

By the early 2000s, Taylor had become heavily involved in selling drugs and participating in gang activities.

==Music career==
===Early career (2002–2003)===
While recovering in the hospital from gunshot wounds he incurred in late 2001, Game told his brother to go out and buy all of the classic hip-hop albums. Over the course of five months, he studied all of the various influential rap albums and developed a strategy to turn himself into a rapper. With the help of his older brother Big Fase, they founded the label. It originally featured such artists as Glasses Malone, Vita, and Nu Jerzey Devil, along with Game himself. His stage name was coined by his grandmother, who was a huge fan of the 1997 blockbuster, &quot;The Game&quot;. Game first gained prominence when he attended a hip-hop summit hosted by Russell Simmons and Louis Farrakhan. After he had fully recovered, Game and Big Fase made a mixtape together. He released his first mixtape &quot;You Know What It Is Vol. 1&quot; in 2002, and landed a record deal with the independent label Get Low Recordz owned by JT the Bigga Figga.

Game&#x27;s mixtape reached the hands of Sean Combs, founder of Bad Boy Records, who originally was on the verge of signing him to his label. Five months later, he was discovered by Dr. Dre who listened to the mixtape that had been produced by his brother. Dr. Dre contacted Game and signed him to his Aftermath Entertainment label in 2003. In late 2003, Interscope Records CEO Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre decided to have Game work with 50 Cent and G-Unit in order to help build a growing buzz around Game which would also fuel interest in G-Unit. Game made his first cameo appearance in the music video for 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;In da Club&quot;, where he is seen dancing with a girl. Since then, he has made numerous cameo appearances in music videos by 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, and Fabolous. Game spent the next two and a half years working on his major label debut album and being mentored by Dr. Dre.

===&quot;The Documentary&quot; (2003–2005)===

Not having dropped an album despite being signed onto Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records for a while, Game was still able to create hype around his image alone. He appeared in ads for Sean Combs&#x27;s Sean John clothing company and had an endorsement deal with Boost Mobile, appearing in a commercial alongside Kanye West and Ludacris. Game also appeared heavily on the mixtape circuit and guest starred on mixtapes for DJ Green Lantern, The Diplomats, and G-Unit. The first single released with Game on it was &quot;Certified Gangstas&quot;, which also featured Jim Jones and Cam&#x27;ron. Though the single wasn&#x27;t considered to be mainstream, the buzz increased around the West Coast rapper.

On September 28, 2004, Game released his first promo single, &quot;Westside Story&quot;, from his major label debut album. He had originally chosen to title the album &quot;Nigga Wit&#x27; An Attitude Volume 1&quot; (as heard in the lyrics to &quot;Dreams&quot;), changed the album title to &quot;The Documentary&quot;, which featured Dr. Dre and 50 Cent as executive producers. The album spawned the hit singles &quot;How We Do&quot; and &quot;Hate It or Love It&quot;, the latter receiving two Grammy nominations. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was the sixteenth best selling album of 2005 in the United States. It also debuted at number seven in the United Kingdom and sold over five million copies worldwide. In October 2004, he released &quot;Untold Story&quot; through Get Low Recordz, which sold over 82,000 copies within its first three months. The album featured artists like Sean T, Young Noble (of the Outlawz), and JT the Bigga Figga. Game also appeared on various mixtapes hosted by DJ&#x27;s such as DJ Kayslay, DJ Whoo Kid, and DJ Clue. Game also released a second mixtape &quot;You Know What It Is Vol. 2&quot; through his own record label and appeared on the video game &quot;NBA Live 2004&quot; on a song produced by Fredwreck called &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Me&quot;.

Later that year, the young rapper Lil Eazy-E, son of rapper the late Eazy-E, entered a feud with Game. The two used to be close associates and recorded music together. Lil&#x27; Eazy-E has since directed numerous diss songs targeting the rapper and has expressed his anger over what he felt was Game&#x27;s misuse of his father&#x27;s name. Game responded by claiming that Lil&#x27; Eazy-E was trying to establish himself off the success he had made since releasing &quot;The Documentary&quot;. He released a song titled &quot;120 Bars&quot; where he claimed that Lil&#x27; Eazy-E does not write his own lyrics. However, on the same track, Game stated that he would rather not feud with Lil&#x27; Eazy-E due to the deep respect he has for Lil&#x27; Eazy-E&#x27;s father. Lil&#x27; Eazy-E later responded with &quot;They Know Me&quot;. On October 30, 2006, Game went on KDAY and said that he and Lil&#x27; Eazy-E had ended their feud.

Dr. Dre&#x27;s nemesis, Suge Knight, also had an ongoing feud with Game that stemmed from Yukmouth&#x27;s claim that Game had been slapped by Suge Knight. Game responded on his website, saying that if Suge Knight had ever touched him, he would be &quot;six feet under&quot;. After the 2005 BET Awards show, associates of Death Row Records had their invitations to a party hosted by Ciara rescinded. Supposedly, a member of Death Row Records tried to steal Game&#x27;s chain. Game stated on his website that he disliked Suge Knight because of &quot;the lives he has endangered&quot;. In Miami for the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, Suge Knight was shot and wounded at Kanye West&#x27;s party by an unknown gunman. Game vigorously denied involvement in the shooting, but the incident renewed efforts to pacify hip hop feuds and Game has consequently been discouraged from attending certain events in hopes of averting retaliation. Later, Game and various representatives of California&#x27;s rap cliques formed a West Coast &quot;peace treaty&quot; to end many rivalries between West Coast rappers. Although Suge Knight did not attend, he and Game declared their feud over.

===&quot;Doctor&#x27;s Advocate&quot; and feud with G-Unit (2005–2007)===
In early 2005, Game entered a feud with G-Unit. Even before Game&#x27;s major label debut was released and their feud became public, there was tension between Game and 50 Cent. Soon after &quot;The Documentary&quot;&#x27;s release, 50 Cent talked about an accident that occurred in the strip club by stating that he felt that the rapper&#x27;s actions of not partnering with 50 Cent to react to Fat Joe and Jadakiss after the New York song written by Ja Rule were wrong and then booted Game out of G-Unit. 50 Cent also claimed that he was not getting his proper credit for the creation of the album, as he had written six of the songs, all of which Game denied. During that dispute, a member of Game&#x27;s entourage was shot during a confrontation that occurred at the Hot 97 studio in New York City. After the situation between them escalated, 50 Cent and Game held a press conference to announce their reconciliation. Fans had mixed feelings as to whether the rappers created a publicity stunt to boost the sales of the two albums the pair had just released. Nevertheless, even after the situation had apparently deflated, G-Unit continued to feud with Game, denouncing his street credibility in the media and claimed that, without their support, he would not score a hit if he made a second album. Game responded during a performance at Summer Jam and launched a boycott of G-Unit called &quot;G-Unot&quot;.

After the performance at Summer Jam, Game responded with a song titled &quot;300 Barz and Running&#x27;&quot;, an extended &quot;diss&quot; aimed at G-Unit as well as members of Roc-A-Fella Records on the mixtape &quot;You Know What It Is Vol. 3&quot;. The track is unique in that it is nearly 14 minutes long, in which Game criticizes all members of G-Unit, amongst many others. 50 Cent responded through his &quot;Piggy Bank&quot; music video, which features Game as a Mr. Potato Head doll and also parodies other rivals. Since then, both groups continued to attack each other. Game released two more mixtapes, &quot;Ghost Unit&quot; and a mixtape/DVD called &quot;Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin&quot;. 50 Cent&#x27;s rebuttal was &quot;Not Rich, Still Lyin&#x27;&quot; where he mocks Game. In addition, G-Unit started to respond on numerous mixtapes and then-new G-Unit member Spider Loc began dissing Game. Game responded with &quot;240 Bars (Spider Joke)&quot;, a song mainly aimed at Spider Loc, but also addressing Tony Yayo and rap group M.O.P., and on the song &quot;The Funeral 100 Bars&quot;.

The feud between Game and Roc-A-Fella Records grew out of an earlier rivalry with Memphis Bleek over the name of his label (Get Low Records), which was similar to the one Game was previously signed to (Get Low Recordz). On the single &quot;Westside Story&quot;, Game raps that &quot;I don&#x27;t do button-up shirts or drive Maybachs&quot;, which was perceived as being directed towards Jay-Z, though Game stated it was directed toward Ja Rule. Later Jay-Z performed a freestyle on Funkmaster Flex&#x27;s radio show on Hot 97 and in it, he repeatedly used the word &quot;game&quot;, which some hip hop fans believed was directed towards Game. Game responded with &quot;My Bitch&quot; in which the first verse is directed at G-Unit, the second verse is directed at Jay-Z and the third verse at Suge Knight.
Due to his disputes with 50 Cent, Game left Aftermath Entertainment and signed with Geffen Records, another label under Universal Music Group&#x27;s Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M division to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit in the summer of 2006. The rapper&#x27;s second major-label album &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Advocate&quot; was released on November 14, 2006. This album was set out by Game to prove his success as an artist without the help of Dre or 50 Cent. While Game originally claimed Dr. Dre would still do production on the album in the November issue of &quot;XXL&quot; magazine, he admitted in September after the &quot;XXL&quot; interview was conducted during an interview on radio station Power 105 that Dr. Dre would not be producing any tracks; although four previously unreleased tracks produced by Dr. Dre were released on the Internet, no exact reason was given as to why they were not included on the album. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 358,000 copies its first week.

In October 2006, Game extended a peace treaty to 50 Cent, which was not immediately replied to. However, a couple days later on Power 106, he stated that the treaty was only offered for one day. On Game&#x27;s album &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, he says the feud is over on a few of the songs. The feud seemed to have gained steam after Tony Yayo allegedly slapped the fourteen-year-old son of Czar Entertainment CEO Jimmy Rosemond. Game responded with &quot;Body Bags&quot; on &quot;You Know What It Is Vol. 4&quot;.
Since Young Buck was dismissed from G-Unit by 50 Cent, there have been interviews from both Game and Young Buck stating they never had a problem with each other. In an interview Young Buck said he was aware of Game&#x27;s support and that Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo did not reach out to him.

===&quot;LAX&quot; and &quot;The R.E.D. Album&quot; (2007–2012)===
Game appeared on &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; on May 16, where he confirmed &quot;LAX&quot; would be the last studio album he records. He had originally announced that Dr. Dre would be producing for the album, but neither Dr. Dre nor Aftermath Entertainment had confirmed. The album went head to head with heavy metal band Slipknot&#x27;s &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot; on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, seeing that both albums were released on August 22, 2008, therefore both albums were competing for the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;LAX&quot; ended up debuting at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, at first, it looked like &quot;LAX&quot; had debuted ahead of &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot; by 13 copies. Initially, &quot;Billboard&quot; published an article stating that the Game had secured the top spot with a margin of 13 units, in what was described as the &quot;closest race for number one since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking Data in 1991&quot;. Slipknot&#x27;s labels Warner Music Group and Roadrunner Records asked for a SoundScan recount, a historic first. Nielsen proceeded to the recount, which placed &quot;LAX&quot; at number two with 238,382 copies, and Slipknot in the first position with 239,516 copies scanned, a margin of 1,134 copies. After the recount 12 hours later, the article was rewritten and Slipknot was awarded the number one spot. &quot;LAX&quot; spawned four singles: &quot;Game&#x27;s Pain&quot; with R&amp;B singer Keyshia Cole, &quot;Dope Boys&quot; with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, &quot;My Life&quot; with rapper Lil Wayne and &quot;Camera Phone&quot; with R&amp;B singer Ne-Yo. In the United States, the album has sold over 660,100 copies.

It was confirmed in May 2009, that Game began working on a new album, titled &quot;The R.E.D. Album&quot; On June 26, 2009, Game released a song titled &quot;Better on the Other Side&quot; a Michael Jackson tribute, the day after Jackson&#x27;s death. It features Diddy, Mario Winans, Chris Brown, Usher &amp; Boyz II Men.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Game (rapper)-LAX/The R.E.D. Album&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On October 3, 2009, Snoop Dogg posted a picture on his Twitter of himself, Dr. Dre and Game in the studio working together, The picture was taken a day earlier and it marked the first time Game had worked with Dr. Dre for some years since the beef with former fellow G-Unit labelmate 50 Cent caused him to release his two following albums on Geffen Records. Later in early January 2010 Game posted a twitpic of him wearing a lot of Aftermath chains with a caption saying &quot;It&#x27;s funny how things come Full Circle&quot;. Later he confirmed that he had returned to Aftermath Entertainment. He traveled to Pristina, Kosovo for a concert, that according to him would be the greatest of his life. In an interview there, Game stated: &quot;I love Albanians, If I could be reborn, I&#x27;d be reborn Albanian&quot;. On June 3, 2011, Pitchfork Media announced that Game was working with Odd Future leader Tyler, The Creator on a track called &quot;Martians vs. Goblins&quot;. Finally released on August 23, 2011, &quot;The R.E.D. Album&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 units.

===&quot;Jesus Piece&quot; and &quot;OKE&quot; (2012–2013)===

Shortly after the release of the long-delayed eighth studio album, Game announced he had begun work on his ninth album. At the time titled &quot;Soundtrack to Chaos&quot;, he said the album would not feature him &quot;name-dropping&quot; or feature any artists as guests for vocals. In March 2012, Game announced the album name had been changed to &quot;F.I.V.E.: Fear Is Victory&#x27;s Evolution&quot; and that it could be his last album released under Interscope, but on August 28 the rapper published a new title: &quot;Jesus Piece&quot;.

In an interview with MTV on November 8, Game revealed that as &quot;Jesus Piece&quot; is his last album before his deal with Interscope comes to a close, he has had talks with both Maybach Music Group and Cash Money Records for a possible new record deal. He also stated that he would consider releasing music independently.
The album was released on December 11, 2012, with features from Lil Wayne, Big Sean, J. Cole, Jamie Foxx, Wiz Khalifa, Tyga and Chris Brown among others. In promotion for the album Game started a free weekly music giveaway titled &quot;Sunday Service&quot;. All the tracks are leftovers from &quot;Jesus Piece&quot;. Game also showed interest in making a future collaboration LP with Chris Brown. Game explained the concept of &quot;Jesus Piece&quot; does not have a spiritual theme, but it would have a &quot;Gangster&quot; theme of enjoying life while also having faith in God. &quot;Jesus Piece&quot; became Game&#x27;s first album since the multi-platinum selling and critically acclaimed &quot;The Documentary&quot;, to feature production from Dr. Dre. Game announced on social media that every Sunday leading up to the album that he would be dropping new music, which failed to make the album&#x27;s final cut. Game compared the album&#x27;s quality of production and high number of guests to his mentor Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;The Chronic 2001&quot;. Upon release the album received generally positive reviews by music critics. Most reviewers have praised the production and guests and the album. &quot;Jesus Piece&quot; debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 86,000 copies in the United States. As of July 26, 2013, it has sold 281,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan.

On November 30, 2012, Game announced that he and fellow rapper Stat Quo were starting a new record label titled Rolex Records. Both artists would use the label to release new music and sign other artists. On October 1, 2013, Game announced he was officially leaving Interscope Records, and that he was now a free agent. The following day he told Artistdirect that him signing to Cash Money Records was likely, and that a final announcement of a signing would probably come in January 2014. He also stated he had talked to Kendrick Lamar, Nipsey Hussle, and Snoop Dogg about possibly doing collaboration albums in the future.

On October 8, the Game released his first project since leaving Interscope, a mixtape titled &quot;Operation Kill Everything&quot;. The mixtape featured guest appearances by Too Short, Schoolboy Q, Chris Brown, Lil Wayne, Problem, Nipsey Hussle, Juicy J, Young Jeezy, Stat Quo, and Ty$ among others. The day after the mixtape&#x27;s release, the Game spoke to &quot;XXL&quot; where he said, he had begun working on his ninth studio album, which will be executive produced by Cool &amp; Dre. He mentioned he had also talked to Warner Bros. Records about a record deal, and was still possible that he would re-sign with Interscope. Then the following day, the Game released a deluxe edition of &quot;OKE&quot; to iTunes, featuring two bonus tracks, including &quot;Hollywood&quot; a song with Scarface.

===&quot;The Documentary 2&quot;, &quot;1992&quot; and feud with Meek Mill (2013–2018)===
On October 12, 2013, Birdman announced that he had signed the Game to Cash Money Records, which Game later seemingly confirmed that same day. On December 11, 2013, Game stated that he was not officially signed to Cash Money Records stating &quot;It&#x27;s just trying to figure out what&#x27;s the best for Cash Money, what&#x27;s the best for Game at this point in his career. That&#x27;s pretty much family and that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at, at this point&quot;, he said. &quot;Nothing&#x27;s written in stone, but that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m leaning.&quot;

On June 16, 2014, the Game released the compilation album, &quot;Blood Moon: Year of the Wolf&quot;&#x27;s first single &quot;Bigger than Me&quot;. The song heavily samples rock group Poliça&#x27;s 2013 single &quot;Warrior Lord&quot;. The following day, the Game announced that his sixth studio album, a sequel to his debut album &quot;The Documentary&quot;, would be arriving in January 2015, with Dr. Dre returning as producer along with Just Blaze and Scott Storch. He also expressed interest in getting Nicki Minaj featured on the album. The second single from &quot;Year of the Wolf&quot;, titled &quot;Or Nah&quot; was released on July 1, 2014.

On March 18, 2015, the Game announced that &quot;The Documentary 2&quot; would be released June 30, 2015. The album was pushed back to August 7. On June 23, Game released the first single, titled &quot;100&quot; featuring Drake. Target began displaying the original artwork for &quot;The Documentary 2&quot; July 13, 2015. However, the release date was pushed back again, to August 28, then eventually to October 9.

A week later on October 16, Game released &quot;The Documentary 2.5&quot; the second half of &quot;The Documentary 2&quot;.

The Game and Skrillex collaborated on a song named &quot;El Chapo&quot;, which was released on October 9, 2015.

On August 1, 2016, the Game ended his twelve-year feud with 50 Cent when the two were in the Ace of Diamonds Strip Club and he said &quot;What happened, that shit was 12 years ago.&quot;

On September 16, 2016, the Game released &quot;92 Bars&quot;, a five-minute freestyle, used to promote his upcoming seventh studio album, but was also rumored to have been a diss towards rapper Meek Mill. Previously, Mill and Game collaborated on 2015&#x27;s &quot;The Soundtrack&quot;. Hours after the release of &quot;92 Bars&quot;, Game admitted that the freestyle was specifically a diss towards Mill. The next day, the two rappers ended up in an Instagram exchange, with the Game cyber-flirting with Meek Mill&#x27;s girlfriend, Nicki Minaj, as well as accusing him of calling the police, informing the authorities about a robbery involving Sean Kingston. On September 18, Meek Mill released a diss track towards Game, a remix to Young M.A.&#x27;s &quot;Ooouuu&quot; with Omelly and Beanie Sigel. Two days later, the Game responded with &quot;Pest Control&quot;, using the same beat and sending shots at Meek Mill, Omelly, Beanie Sigel and Sean Kingston. In 2018 the two reconciled after Mill&#x27;s incarceration and subsequent release from prison. On October 27, 2017, the Game released the single &quot;Oh I&quot; featuring Jeremih, Young Thug and Sevyn Streeter.

From his &quot;1992&quot; album, he released &quot;True Colors/It&#x27;s On&quot;, &quot;All Eyez&quot;, &quot;What Your Life Like&quot;, and &quot;Baby You&quot; featuring Jason Derulo.

===&quot;Born 2 Rap&quot; (2019-21)===
In December 2016, the Game announced that he is working on his next and final album. On June 21, 2019, he released the first single of the album titled &quot;West Side&quot;. On November 1, 2019, the Game released the second single, &quot;Stainless&quot;, featuring Anderson .Paak. His ninth studio album &quot;Born 2 Rap&quot; was released on November 29, 2019, his fifiteth birthday. It debuted at number nineteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===&quot;Drillmatic – Heart vs. Mind&quot; and feud with Eminem (2021–22)===
In November 2020, The Game returned with the Lil Wayne-assisted &quot;A.I. with the Braids&quot;, his first single since &quot;Born 2 Rap&quot;. In January 2021, The Game&#x27;s manager, Wack 100, said to AllHipHop that although Game called &quot;Born 2 Rap&quot; his final album and showed interest in managing and signing artists during retirement, he is however is back in the studio working on a new project, tentatively titled &quot;30 for 30&quot;. No further details have been announced.

In January 2022, the Game&#x27;s feud with 50 Cent reignited after the latter critiqued Game&#x27;s &quot;Drink Champs&quot; interview with N.O.R.E., where he claimed that 50&#x27;s former record sale competitor Kanye West did &quot;more for me in two weeks than [Dr.] Dre did for me throughout my entire career&quot;. The Game responded, commenting that he enclosed the entirety of G-Unit as a group and clothing brand &quot;in a casket&quot;, also expressing his likeliness in the &quot;Power&quot; television trilogy (which 50 Cent co-produces), but warning him to &quot;leave [the past] alone or else... I&#x27;m outside #Numinati&quot;. Then, two months later, in March, 50 Cent published a video via Instagram of Game being shunned by former Interscope Records CEO Jimmy Iovine at a basketball game, poking fun of it while also commenting &quot;50 wrote ya hits&quot;. The Game once again flamed 50 after the claims were brought back up and also bragged to &quot;get [50&#x27;s] girlfriend out of my DM&#x27;s&quot;. This was believed to have been a consequential result of Game claiming on &quot;Drink Champs&quot; to be &quot;the best and a better rapper&quot; than former Aftermath labelmate Eminem, with whom 50 still remains close friends. Additionally, Game&#x27;s manager, Wack 100, has subliminally called out or questioned 50 Cent&#x27;s credibility, over the rapper&#x27;s surprise appearance at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show and ghostwriting allegations.

On July 15, the Game announced his eleventh album, &quot;Drillmatic – Heart vs. Mind&quot;, revealing the cover art and the release date. The album was released on August 12, 2022. The album is executive produced by Hit-Boy, Kanye West, Wack 100 and others. The album included guest appearances from Chloe Bailey, Rick Ross, ASAP Rocky, former rival Meek Mill, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Big Sean, YG and twenty-two others throughout its 30-track listing; it also includes the Kanye West duet, &quot;Eazy&quot;, which samples the Eazy-E 1988 title track, &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot;, as well as &quot;The Black Slim Shady&quot;, which is a ten-minute diss towards Eminem. YoungBoy Never Broke Again was originally featured on the album through a track titled &quot;O.P.P.&quot;, but was later omitted from the track, due to a feature clearance issue regarding a $150,000 fee, according to Game&#x27;s manager, Wack 100. Selling 25,000 equivalent units in the first week, it debuted at number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming Game&#x27;s lowest-selling album in his career.

==Other ventures==
In 2000, the Game appeared on the dating television show &quot;Change of Heart&quot;; in the segment his partner criticized him for &quot;acting macho when in reality is said to be sensitive.&quot; The episode came to an end where a mutual friend of the Game and his partner suggested in them staying together, the Game decided to stay together but was rebuffed by the offer when his partner agreed to a change of heart and the Game was subsequently dumped on TV.

The Game also ventured into acting. In 2004, he had a minor role voicing the character &quot;B-Dup&quot; in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;. He also voiced himself in the video game &quot;Def Jam: Icon&quot;. In 2006, he made his film debut in &quot;Waist Deep&quot; as a character named &quot;Big Meat&quot;.

The Game was chosen to play and bought a large amount of shares for the Inglewood Cobras, established in 2005 and playing in the American Basketball Association basketball franchise team. The team folded after playing fewer than five games in the ABA in the league&#x27;s 2005–2006 season. The team was coached by former NBA player Sean Higgins.

The Game has also partnered with 310 Motoring to create his own shoe, The Hurricanes. A portion of the proceeds of the shoe were donated to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. 310 Motoring ceased operations in 2008, thus ending production of the Hurricane shoe brand.

In 2012–2013, he promoted his &quot;60 Days of Fitness&quot; challenge, a rigorous fitness and nutrition regime with his brother and trainer Byrd.

The Game has, on several occasions, honored the memory of those who died during the Armenian genocide and has expressed his sympathy towards the events. The Game is also an avid supporter of Black Lives Matter.

===Record labels===
The Black Wall Street Records was an American independent record label founded in 2002, by the Game. The name &quot;The Black Wall Street&quot; is adopted from what was the racially segregated Greenwood neighborhood of Tulsa, Oklahoma. During the oil boom of the 1920s, Greenwood was home to several successful and prominent African-American entrepreneurs.

Before The Documentary, Game dropped a series of mixtapes on his own label, The Black Wall Street. After leaving G-Unit Records, Game hoped to push The Black Wall Street to the mainstream to compete with his former label and labelmates. Though the label didn&#x27;t released an official retail album, it did released several mixtapes including the &quot;Black Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;BWS Radio&quot; series. Former artists who have been on the label include: Vita, Ya Boy, and Charli Baltimore.

Blood Money Entertainment was an American independent record label. In December 2012, the Game founded a new record label, Rolex Records, alongside fellow rapper Stat Quo. Following its founding, he bought his entire team at the record label Rolex watches. After a six-month legal battle with Rolex, he changed the name and logo of the record label to The Firm, which then became Blood Money Entertainment. The label has signed West Coast rappers Skeme, King Marie, Pharaoh Jackson and Dubb.

Prolific Records was an American independent record label founded by the Game in the autumn of 2019. According to court documents obtained by AllHipHop, Priscilla Rainey was granted ownership of the Game&#x27;s vanity label, as well as royalties from his tenth studio album, &quot;Born 2 Rap&quot; (2019). This means Rainey now has full control over any salary the Game was receiving through his imprint.

100 Entertainment is an American independent record label founded in 2021 by the Game and his manager, Wack 100.

==Personal life==
Taylor is the father of three sons and one daughter.

Taylor became a father for the first time in 2003 with the birth of his eldest child, Harlem Caron Taylor, just before the launch of his debut album, The Documentary. He later welcomed his son, King Justice, and daughter, Cali Dream, in 2007 and 2010, respectively. His fourth child, Blaze Taylor, arrived in 2024.

Taylor announced that he was engaged to actress and model Valeisha Butterfield, the daughter of U.S. Congressman G. K. Butterfield. The couple were set to marry in March 2007, but the engagement was called off in June 2006.

After the couple broke off their engagement, Taylor became involved in a relationship with Tiffney Cambridge, a sixth-grade teacher. VH1 broadcast two seasons of &quot;Marrying the Game&quot;, a reality television series about the Game and Cambridge, as they prepared to walk down the aisle. The relationship was &quot;love at first sight&quot; when Cambridge met Jayceon. Despite reservations regarding Taylor&#x27;s career, the relationship lasted eight years, but no marriage plans materialized despite the series. Cambridge accused Taylor of physical abuse throughout the relationship, which he denied.

Taylor announced during the episode of the &quot;Tacos &amp; Shawarma&quot; podcast that aired on Sunday, August 4, 2024, that he and Shaniece Hairston, the daughter of TV personality and model Evelyn Lozada, are expecting their first child. On Friday, December 6, 2024, Taylor shared a photo of his child on Instagram, disclosing that the child&#x27;s name is Blaze Taylor. 

==Legal issues==
===2005===
====Assault lawsuit====
Game, Snoop Dogg, and Tha Dogg Pound, were sued for assaulting a fan on stage at a May 2005 concert at the White River Amphitheatre in Auburn, Washington. The accuser, Richard Monroe Jr., claimed he was beaten by the artists&#x27; entourage while mounting the stage. He alleged that he reacted to an &quot;open invite&quot; to come on stage. Before he could, Snoop&#x27;s bodyguards grabbed him and he was beaten unconscious by crew members, including the rapper and producer Soopafly; Snoop and Game were included in the suit for not intervening. The lawsuit focuses on a pecuniary claim of $22 million in punitive and compensatory damages, battery, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The concerned parties appeared in court in April 2009.

====Criminal disorderly conduct====
On October 28, 2005, Game was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest in Greensboro, North Carolina. At one point, police said his companions were pepper sprayed when they surrounded officers in a threatening manner. Mall security officers said the rapper was wearing a full-face Halloween mask, filming shoppers, cursed loudly, and refused to leave when asked. Game continued to act up and was arrested, a police statement said. Game claimed that officers overreacted and that he did nothing wrong when he was pepper-sprayed by the mall security. The five officers involved in the incident ended up suing Game for defamation. The officers were awarded $5 million in compensatory damages, which was upheld on appeal by the North Carolina Court of Appeals in February 2012.

===2007: Criminal assault and weapon possession charges===
On May 11, 2007, Game was arrested at his home, reportedly in connection with an incident at a basketball game in South Los Angeles in February 2007. He is alleged to have threatened a person with a gun. The arrest took place after his home was searched for three hours. Game was released early the next day after posting $50,000 bail. On January 9, 2008, a Los Angeles judge scheduled February 4 as the beginning date for Game&#x27;s trial on assault and weapons charges. After pleading no contest to a felony weapons charge on February 11, Game was sentenced to 60 days in jail, 150 hours of community service, and three years of probation.

===2011===
====Banishment from Canada====
In 2011, Game was refused entry to Canada for alleged gang ties in Los Angeles; concert organisers said he was associated with the Bloods.

====Obstruction of justice via social media====
On August 12, 2011, the Game decided to tweet his search for a supposed internship opening. In the message sent to his over 580,000 followers, he posted the number to call as the emergency line for the Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The Game&#x27;s fans jammed the line for hours. Initially, the Game denied any wrongdoing, saying the tweet was &quot;a mistake&quot;. The Game then posted a message saying the sheriff&#x27;s department can &quot;track a tweet down but you can&#x27;t solve murders!&quot; A criminal investigation was launched stating that the Game could be charged for obstruction of justice. Despite all of this, the Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Department issued this statement: &quot;Based upon our investigation, as well as consultation with the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s Office, the LASD considers the criminal investigation into this matter closed. The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department will not be seeking criminal charges.&quot; The Game issued an apology on CNN saying, &quot;My sincerest apologies to the Sheriff&#x27;s Department, it was a joke gone wrong.&quot;

===2012: 40 Glocc assault and lawsuit===
On July 8, 2012, 40 Glocc got into an altercation with the Game. In a video clip, allegedly shot by the Game via Game&#x27;s iPhone during the fight, 40 Glocc is seen running into a bush after being beaten up by the fellow West Coast rapper. Game defended what he did by saying he was retaliating for Glocc going up to rappers Lil Wayne and Plies in the past with large entourages. In October 2012, 40 Glocc filed a lawsuit for $4.54 million for assault and battery, as well as damaging his reputation. This included $500,000 in pain and suffering; $500,000 in emotional distress; $750,000 in lost earnings; $2 million for punitive damages; $25,000 in medical expenses; and various other reasons. Since then, Glocc has gone on a smear campaign against the Game, releasing his diss &quot;The Full Edit&quot; in December 2012. Game has similarly addressed the situation in several interviews, claiming that filing a lawsuit of this nature &quot;disintegrates your street cred&quot;. In December 2012, 40 Glocc assaulted Game&#x27;s manager Dontay &quot;Taydoe&quot; Kidd in Las Vegas, Nevada. Glocc won the lawsuit and was awarded $3,000.

===2014: Standoff with Los Angeles police officers===
On April 30, 2014, Game and Atlanta rapper T.I. were involved in a verbally confrontational standoff with officers of the Los Angeles Police Department. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, it was believed to have been disconcerted as a response to officers misconducting a group of bystanders afar from a nightclub the two artists were attending. In a video leaked by TMZ, T.I. and Game were forced out of the club which they nicknamed the &quot;Supercut Club&quot; (or &quot;Supperclub&quot;) by LAPD officials, due to an investigation of a drug and gambling ring. The club&#x27;s security guards were also present at the scene and refused the rappers&#x27; re-entries into the property to avoid more legal troubles. T.I. and Game were forced to stand back with the former yelling &quot;Y&#x27;all got a lot of people beat up. We got good lawyers.&quot; One of the bystanders was forced to lay down with his hands over his head without warning and security kicked him repeatedly to try to get him back up in opposition. Another guard yelled, &quot;He goes to jail tonight!&quot;. T.I. and Game were rumored to have been arrested for simple assault on a police officer and disturbing the peace, but were later released and with charges being dropped, but this was later denied by LAPD team members.

===2016-23: Priscilla Rainey sexual assault lawsuit and liability===
In 2016, a judge ruled that the Game was liable for sexually assaulting Priscilla Rainey, then a contestant on &quot;She Got Game&quot;, a VH1 reality show starring the Game. Rainey claimed she had agreed to go on a date with the Game, believing it would be on camera; however, when she met the rapper at a Chicago restaurant, there was allegedly no production crew. The lawsuit further alleged the Game showed up to the date &quot;highly intoxicated on alcohol and drugs (which was typical), and sexually assaulted the plaintiff [Rainey] on several occasions that night. This included him forcefully reaching his hand inside her dress to rub her bare vagina and buttocks&quot;.

In 2019, an appellate court affirmed the entire $7.1 million judgment. However, according to Rainey, the rapper failed to pay her any money in the years since she received the judgement. Rainey subsequently filed a motion, requesting the seizure of the Game&#x27;s income, and in April 2020, she was granted ownership of the Game&#x27;s independent record label Prolific Records, as well as royalties from his 2019 album, &quot;Born 2 Rap&quot;. This resulted in Rainey gaining full control over any salary the Game would receive through his imprint label, which was launched in late 2019. In November 2019, the Game had addressed his legal battle with Rainey during an appearance on &quot;Complex&quot;″s &quot;Everyday Struggle&quot;, calling Rainey a liar, and insisted he was never going to pay her.

On December 30, 2023, Rainey was rewarded $7 million after the Game refused to pay her previous judgment. A month earlier, a claim by Rainey was rejected of her alleging that the rapper was creating shell companies to avoid payment.

===2017: Misdemeanor battery of an off-duty police officer===
In 2017, Game pleaded no contest to assaulting an off-duty police officer on March 29, 2015, during a basketball game at a Hollywood high school. Game, then 37, entered a no contest plea to one misdemeanor count each of criminal threats and battery, and also pleaded no contest to one felony count of grand theft, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s Office. He was immediately sentenced to three years of formal probation, 120 hours of community service and 26 anger management counseling sessions, and a 6-month suspended sentence.

Game and an off-duty Los Angeles police officer were on opposing teams in a basketball game when the defendant intentionally fouled, then sucker-punched the victim who had just stolen the ball from the defendant and scored a basket. Game threatened to kill the victim once the defendant was ejected as a result of the punch, and on April 11, 2015, Game grabbed and threatened a man filming him being served with legal papers outside of his house and kept the victim&#x27;s camera, according to the prosecutor.

=== 2024: Social media video controversy ===
On July 30, 2024, a video leaked via social media of Game entering a restroom with three men and throwing a cream pie toward one of them. He then confronted the 22-year-old man for attempting to have a relationship with a 15-year-old boy, which he reminded him was pedophilia. Game also threatened the person to &quot;go kill yourself&quot;, before the supposed predator used the victim playing card, claiming to have been sexually abused by older men in his childhood and also working at a theme park surrounding children.

<doc id="894015" wikidata="Q137110" url="?curid=894015" title="Ureaplasma urealyticum">
<text>Ureaplasma urealyticum is a bacterium belonging to the genus &quot;Ureaplasma&quot; and the family Mycoplasmataceae in the order Mycoplasmatales. This family consists of the genera &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; and &quot;Ureaplasma&quot;. Its type strain is T960. There are two known biovars of this species; T960 and 27. These strains of bacteria are commonly found as commensals in the urogenital tracts of human beings, but overgrowth can lead to infections that cause the patient discomfort. Unlike most bacteria, &quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot; lacks a cell wall making it unique in physiology and medical treatment.

==Classification==
The six recognised &quot;Ureaplasma&quot; species have a GC content of 27 to 30 percent and a genome size ranging from 0.76 to 1.17 million base pairs, and cholesterol is required for growth. A defining characteristic of the genus is that they perform urea hydrolysis, which creates ammonia as a product. Some strains originally classified as &quot;U. urealyticum&quot; should be treated as a new species, &quot;U. parvum&quot;. Both strains of U&quot;reaplasma urealyticum&quot; have had their DNA sequenced, using a PCR amplification and dideoxy termination method. Their sequences can be accessed through public records and databases. Most of the16S rDNA sequence of the two strains constitute the exact same nucleotides bases (97.3% homology), yet small differences have been acknowledged. Due to the direct similarity and the increased variation in other species of &quot;Ureaplasma&quot;, it is thought that the two strains of &quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot; (T960 and 27) have evolutionary diverged together. In the same study conducted, using the same 16s rDNA aligned sequences, they concluded all the mammalian strains diverged and coevolved with their corresponding species (canine, feline, human, bovine) during the Cretaceous period. It was found that the most closely related species strain of &quot;Ureaplasma&quot; to &quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot; was &quot;Ureaplasma diversum&quot; (isolated from bovine).

== Gram staining ==
U. urealyticum represents one of the 14 distinct types within the Ureaplasma genus. Classified within the Mollicutes class, Ureaplasma species have undergone significant evolutionary adaptations from their Gram-positive bacterial ancestors, a phenomenon termed degenerative evolutions (Kallapur, Suhas G, et al 2013). This evolutionary trajectory has resulted in the loss of the peptidoglycan cell wall, a hallmark characteristic of Gram-positive bacteria. Despite this evolutionary divergence, instances have been reported where U. urealyticum, upon gram staining, exhibited the same characteristics as Gram-negative bacteria. Notably, despite such staining outcomes, it is imperative to recognize that the U. urealyticum remains a Gram-Positive bacterium, This discrepancy underscores the importance of discerning between staining outcomes and bacterial classification (“Ureaplasma Urealyticum.” Microbewiki).

== Treatment ==
As stated previously, since these bacteria are still considered Gram-positive, and lack a cell wall, the most versatile antibiotic that can’t be used is penicillin. Since these antibiotics attack the cell wall of a bacterium, they can not be used for this type of infection. The reason that many individuals get this infection can be damage to the uterus wall lining, causing the bacteria to thrive in a carbon-rich environment. 

Unfortunately, it was found from trials that many of the antibiotics that we utilize on a day-to-day basis for urinary tract infections do not affect the bacteria due to lacking a cell wall. Yet, the types of antibiotics that can be used are quinolones, tetracyclines, and macrolides, since they affect a large part of the mycoplasma family of bacteria where U. urealyticum falls under. 

Yet, it is not recommended to be used a lot because these bacteria can develop resistance to these antibiotics fairly fast. Secondly, other drugs that have β-lactamases are infective to treat infection because of how fast the bacteria&#x27;s circular genome can mutate (Fan et al. 2023). However, there are new movements to use Azithromycin to treat these infections. This is a therapeutic that can be taken orally, once ingested our macrophages, which are part of our immune system, take up the antibiotic and deliver it to the sites of infection (Fan et al. 2023). This helps control the infection where the bacteria grows, additionally, it is also a great alternative to when a mother is pregnant so it does not cause harm to the fetus since It&#x27;s using our immune system to help defend the fetus and the mother&#x27;s body. 

== Testing on agar ==
To test for this bacterium, an agar plate, which is 10B broth, should be used on U. urealyticum. Since these bacteria love to grow in mostly acidic places, the bacteria should go under microdilution MIC dilution to get a pH color change. If the dilution color changes to red it indicates that there is presence of U. urealyticum in the sample. After this, it should be transferred to the 10B Broth, where once placed it will turn yellow, but then slowly change the color to pink. This helps to indicate the growth of the bacterium(Waites, Ken B, et al 2012). The reason it can grow on this 10B Broth is because it has a lot of nutrients that let the bacteria grow from heart infusion to yeast extract, yet, it also has urea to help the bacteria to hydrolyze it and with hydrolyzing it causes the release of ammonia that causes the broth to change to a pink color (10B Broth - Thermo Fisher Scientific). The reason for this is that it loves to live in urea-rich environments. It&#x27;s the same reason why in clinics, they take urine samples or vaginal swabs to be sent to the labs to run this test on 10B broth.

==Clinical relevance==
&quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot; can cause urethritis and may cause bacterial vaginosis. Infection can occur in extragenital sites. A common symptom associated with these infections is the &quot;fishy&quot; smell that is created due to the production of ammonia by the hydrolysis of urea. Patients should confirm diagnosis with a doctor. The bacterium has high correlations with the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). It has also been linked to infertility in both males and females. In addition, this pathogen may latently infect the chorionic villi tissues of pregnant women, thereby impacting pregnancy outcome. Issues that arise from &quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot; infections during pregnancy include preterm birth and impacted embryonic development. Some patients have given birth to children subjected to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, Intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Patients can evolve resistances to normal antibiotic treatments due to the distinctive physiology of these organisms. In the Western World, approximately 40% of &quot;Ureaplasma&quot; species are resistant to fluoroquinolones (i.e. ciprofloxacin). Patients who are pregnant have further limitations on the treatment course of a &quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot; infection, making it far harder to successfully cure.

Lin Sheng-hsiang (林生祥) of has described the style as &quot;a very rustic and urban-rooty form of music, normally with a keyboard, which has replaced the accordion, and drums accompanying the singers.&quot; As such, the form is a favorite of pro-labor bands and musical groups.

<doc id="894029" wikidata="Q2361723" url="?curid=894029" title="Jaws (James Bond)">
<text>Jaws is the nickname of a fictional henchman in the &quot;James Bond&quot; films &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977) and &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979), played in both films by actor Richard Kiel. The character is known for his towering height and his metal teeth.

==Creation==
The character was inspired by Ian Fleming&#x27;s description of a hoodlum named Sol &quot;Horror&quot; Horowitz in his novel &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. When Horror speaks, he reveals steel-capped teeth. The initial script of &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; concluded with Jaws being killed by the shark, but after a rough test screening, Jaws was so well-liked that the scene was changed to have him survive. In the storyboard of the sequence from &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979), Jaws appeared with an Emilio Largo-style eyepatch, and a moustache, neither of which were seen in the films.

The character&#x27;s teeth play a prominent role in the films. Albert R. Broccoli is credited with adding steel teeth to the character for &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. Katharina Kubrick Hobbs designed the teeth as cog-like in shape, as she felt that pointed teeth could have injured Kiel. Broccoli originally hired John Chambers to make the teeth; however, these were not used, as they did not meet Broccoli&#x27;s standards. Broccoli then sent Kiel to Peter Thomas, a dental technician who worked near Pinewood Studios, to construct the appliances. Kiel stated the props were uncomfortable for him and he could only wear them for less than one minute before gagging. After shooting a scene, the teeth were placed in a plastic container with cotton wool in the bottom of it and the teeth were rinsed with mouthwash before drying for use in the next scene. After the James Bond films, the teeth were taken to an unknown location. In 2002, the teeth were displayed as part of an exhibition at Science Museum, London to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the release of &quot;Dr. No&quot;.

==Appearances==

===In films===
Jaws first appeared in the 1977 film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; as a henchman to the villain, Karl Stromberg. He was an assassin, and is last seen swimming in the ocean after escaping from the Atlantis city ship on which Bond had killed Stromberg before it was torpedoed and sunk. 

In the next film, &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979), Jaws is employed by both Bond&#x27;s unspecified enemy in the pre-credits sequence, and the main villain Hugo Drax. Jaws is evidently well known among criminals, as Drax is pleased to learn that Jaws is available to hire. In his second appearance Jaws changed from a ruthless and unstoppable killing machine to more of a comedic figure (commencing with the cable car sequence) and he eventually turns against Drax and helps Bond defeat him.

In addition to having steel teeth, Jaws was also gigantic and extremely strong, which forced Bond to be especially inventive while fighting him. In combat during &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, Bond found himself caught in an unbreakable death grip by Jaws, who was about to fatally bite him; Bond escaped by using a broken electric lamp to send an electric shock through the assassin&#x27;s teeth to stun him. In &quot;Moonraker&quot; he gains a girlfriend, Dolly, who is never seen to speak aloud and who is the primary reason for his reformation.

Jaws also has an uncanny ability to survive any misfortune seemingly unscathed and come back to challenge Bond again. In &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, Jaws survives an Egyptian structure&#x27;s collapse on top of him, being hit by a van, being thrown from a rapidly moving train, sitting in the passenger seat of a car which veers off a cliff in Sardinia and lands in a hut below (to the owner&#x27;s dismay), a battle underwater with a shark and the destruction of Stromberg&#x27;s lair. In &quot;Moonraker&quot;, he survives falling several thousand feet after accidentally disabling his own parachute (he falls through a circus tent and lands in the trapeze net), a crash through a building inside a runaway cable car (where he meets and falls in love with Dolly) and going over Iguazu Falls. After each of these incidents (except the last), he always picks himself up, dusts off his jacket and straightens his tie in a Bond manner and nonchalantly walks away. As Jaws escapes from Drax&#x27;s disintegrating space station to an escape pod with his girlfriend; they open a bottle of champagne, and Jaws speaks his only line in the entire franchise: &quot;Well, here&#x27;s to us.&quot; The viewer is later informed that Jaws and Dolly made it back to Earth safely.

In 1979, there were plans to bring Jaws back for a third film. In &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, Jaws would marry Dolly. However, due to a change in production personnel and a desire to make the films more down-to-earth, the producers chose not to bring Kiel or Jaws back.

====Novelizations====
Most of the background information on Jaws comes from Christopher Wood&#x27;s novelisation of the film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;; published as &quot;James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; to differentiate from Ian Fleming&#x27;s novel. In Wood&#x27;s version, Jaws&#x27; real name is Zbigniew Krycsiwiki. He was born in Poland, the product of a union between the strong man of a travelling circus and the Chief Wardress at the Women&#x27;s Prison in Kraków. The relationship and subsequent marriage had been a stormy one and, when it broke up, the young Zbigniew stayed with his mother and attended school and subsequently university in Kraków. He grew to a prodigious height but in temperament he followed his father and was surly and uncooperative, given to sudden outbreaks of violent temper. Because of his size he commanded a place in the university basketball team, but he was sluggish of reaction and his lack of speed was constantly exposed by more skilful but less physically endowed players. After a failed attempt at a basketball career, Krycsiwiki was arrested by the secret police for having taken part in the (fictitious) &quot;1972 bread riots&quot;. While he was imprisoned, the police &quot;beat him with hollow steel clubs encased in thick leather&quot; until they thought he was dead, leaving his jaw broken beyond repair. Krycsiwiki later escaped and stowed aboard one of Stromberg&#x27;s vessels. Eventually he was caught, but instead of turning him in, Stromberg hired a prestigious doctor to create an artificial jaw. After 14 operations Krycsiwiki&#x27;s jaw was restored using steel components that created two rows of terrifying razor-sharp teeth, although Jaws was left mute. Since none of the above is actually mentioned in either movie, this is not necessarily considered canonical, and Wood contradicts his own continuity when one compares his scripts and his novelisations.

In the novelisation of &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, Jaws remains attached to the magnet that Bond dips into the tank and is killed, whereas in the film Bond uses it to drop Jaws into the water. &quot;Now both hands were tearing at the magnet, and Jaws twisted furiously like a fish on the hook. As Bond watched in fascinated horror, a relentless triangle streaked up behind the stricken giant. A huge grey force launched itself through the wild water, and two rows of white teeth closed around the threshing flesh.&quot;

Also in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; novelisation, Wood specifically states that Jaws is a mute. However, though Jaws remains mute in Wood&#x27;s &quot;James Bond and Moonraker&quot; novelisation, he does speak at the end of its film.

===Other appearances===
Jaws appeared in the 1990s animated spin-off &quot;James Bond Jr.&quot; as a member of the SCUM organization and partner-in-crime of fellow henchman Nick Nack. In the show, Jaws underwent some change in his appearance; he was more muscular, his chin was also metal, and he spoke regularly. He is voiced by Jan Rabson.

Jaws&#x27; principal video game appearances are in the 1997 Nintendo 64 game &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; in a bonus mission in which he is a henchman to the deceased Hugo Drax whom Bond needs to defeat, and has multiple appearances in the multi-platform 2004 game &quot;007: Everything or Nothing&quot; as a henchman to Nikolai Diavolo. Both games use Richard Kiel&#x27;s likeness and voice (grunts and sound effects).

In &quot;Everything or Nothing&quot;, Jaws is electrocuted and is inside a train that plummets into a canyon. Later he drives a tanker intending to destroy the New Orleans levees, but Bond destroys his tanker by sending it off of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway; Bond exclaiming, &quot;I have a sinking feeling that won&#x27;t be the last I&#x27;ll see of him&quot;. In a fight on a large lift, in which Jaws is equipped with a flamethrower, Bond shoots the flamethrower backpack which ignites Jaws. Bond then climbs into the cockpit of a plane and ejects his seat as the lift plummets to the ground. When Bond subsequently lands on the remains of the lift, Jaws is nowhere to be found, leaving his fate ambiguous. He cannot be hurt himself, and any players that try to hurt him will be killed almost immediately by him.

Jaws is an unlockable multiplayer character in &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; as well as in &quot;007: Nightfire&quot;, where he is the tallest character in the game, his punches can kill almost instantly, and the character model&#x27;s teeth are visible at close range. Jaws is a playable multiplayer character in the 2010 remake &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; for the Wii, and in the 2011 re-release &quot;GoldenEye 007: Reloaded&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. He is also in the 2012 James Bond game &quot;007 Legends&quot;.

Jaws appears in the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis game &quot;James Bond 007: The Duel&quot;, where he wanders briefly around a section toward the end of the first stage and defeats the player with one hit. He also serves as the game&#x27;s final boss.
Jaws also appears in the Game Boy game &quot;James Bond 007&quot; as a boss, where Bond must lead him to magnetized pads that will temporarily hold him in place, allowing time for Bond to attack him.

==Cultural impact==
Jaws was spoofed in Mel Brooks&#x27; 1977 film &quot;High Anxiety&quot;, featuring a hired killer named Braces (played by Rudy De Luca) who is wearing large metal braces on his teeth. An unrelated character named Braces from the video games &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; and &quot;&quot; is also referencing Jaws. The film 2008 &quot;Get Smart&quot;, which is both a parody of and an homage to the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series, features a character named Dalip (played by The Great Khali), who looks like Jaws and does his &quot;Moonraker&quot; stunt of falling from the sky without a parachute and surviving; he also helps the film&#x27;s protagonists in the end.

Jaws makes a cameo appearance in the animated series &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot; (episode &quot;Tough Luck&quot;), where he auditions as a prospective henchman for Finn and gets his steel teeth (which are revealed to be dentures) stuck in a board he bites into. In the final credits sequence of the film adaptation of &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, Doctor Claw&#x27;s assistant is shown attending a Henchman&#x27;s Anonymous meeting; Richard Kiel, who is billed in the credits as &quot;Famous Big Guy with Metal Teeth&quot;, is in attendance. Kiel also played Reace, a very similar character to Jaws (complete with metal teeth), in the 1976 film &quot;Silver Streak&quot;. In &quot;Aces Go Places 3&quot;, the third movie in a James Bond spoof series, Kiel plays a villain named &quot;Big G&quot;, which resembles Jaws, though he has no metal teeth. The film also features an actor who resembles the character Oddjob, another James Bond villain.

In the 2002 French comedy movie Le Boulet, Gary Tiplady portrayed a similar character named Requin The Giant.

&quot;MythBusters&quot; tested the plausibility of Jaws biting through the steel cable car wire. The model based on the dentures used in the movie had little impact on the steel cable, even with a hydraulic press at ten times human bite strength. Jamie Hyneman then took huge metal pincers and became &quot;Claws&quot;, who, as the announcer said, was &quot;meaner than Oddjob, more ferocious than Jaws, taller than Nick Nack, and creepier than Tee Hee.&quot; With the metal pincers, he gets through the cord easily.

<text>Coelacanthidae is an extinct family of coelacanths found in freshwater and marine strata throughout the world, originating during the Permian, and finally dying out during the Jurassic.

The modern-day genus &quot;Latimeria&quot; is often erroneously thought to be in this family, when, in fact, it is the type genus of the more advanced family Latimeriidae, which appeared some time during the Triassic.

<doc id="894035" wikidata="Q8038646" url="?curid=894035" title="Wrongful dismissal in the United Kingdom">
<text>In United Kingdom law, the concept of wrongful dismissal refers exclusively to dismissal contrary to the contract of employment, which effectively means premature termination, either due to insufficient notice or lack of grounds. Although wrongful dismissal is usually associated with lack of notice sometimes it can also be caused by arbitrary dismissal where no notice was required but certain grounds were specified in the contract as being the only ones available but none existed.

== Definitions ==
Wrongful dismissal does not terminate the contract - it is a repudiatory breach, i.e. one entitling the employee to consider himself no longer bound on the basis of the employer no longer considering itself bound. The employer&#x27;s repudiatory breach (wrongful dismissal) forces the employee to accept it as he is prevented from earning from the employer and required to mitigate by working for someone else, thus terminating the contract. This does not follow contract law and is an invention by judges, disliked by others, designed to reflect the reality of employment, using the dual fictions that because the right to wages depends on the obligation to work, there is no right to wages if the employer tells the employee not to work (forgetting that the employer is not able to terminate the obligation to work other than in accordance with the contract) and that the employee has accepted the repudiation by not working for the employer even though he is willing and able. Otherwise the employee would be entitled to stay at home at the employer&#x27;s request yet sue for unpaid wages as a debt.

An employer is only entitled to dismiss an employee without notice:
* in the first month,
* if the contract says so, or
* if the employee conducts himself so as to undermine the trust and confidence such that the employer should no longer be required to retain the employee in his employment.

The last example, trust and confidence, is commonly known as &quot;gross misconduct&quot;, but employment law only distinguishes between misconduct that justifies dismissal and misconduct that does not. Conduct entitling the employer to terminate the contract is conduct indicating the employee no longer considers himself bound by it and so is technically accepting the termination caused by the employee. Gross misconduct is really just a vague list of offences that could most easily justify summary dismissal for a first offence.

Dismissal for a reason contrary to statute or contrary to a statutory procedure is described as &quot;unfair dismissal&quot; but not all wrongful dismissals are unfair dismissals, and dismissal by forcing somebody to resign through serious breach of contract is known as constructive dismissal and constructive dismissal is usually a wrongful dismissal due to lack of notice.

===Employer loses restrictive covenants===
If an employer dismisses an employee without legally required notice then the employee is usually not bound by restrictive covenants (increasingly though courts treat pay in lieu of notice as curing lack of notice). This means the employer of a senior employee privy to company secrets should be careful not to unjustifiably summarily dismiss him, or put him on garden leave or pay him in lieu of notice without a contractual provision allowing it, or even miscalculate his notice period making it a day short.

Sometimes an employer can restore such covenants in a compromise agreement by paying a nominal sum of, say, £500 for them. The employer cannot circumvent the risk of a summary dismissal turning out to have been unlawful by giving notice, as that would imply the employee&#x27;s breach of contract was insufficient to justify summary dismissal.

===Notice period===
The notice period will usually be in the written agreement, otherwise there are statutory minimums but a court can imply a reasonable period and often will if it thinks the employee has been treated shabbily - for example, one week can turn into a month, and one month can turn into three months. The statutory minima are one week for one month to two years&#x27; service then one extra week per year of service from two to twelve years up to a maximum of 12 weeks. The minima will also override contractual provisions if insufficient. Common law notice, used by courts where the contract is silent, depends on the work, seniority, length of service and payment intervals, but not on what the employer can afford; senior specialists can be given six or even up to twelve months.

===Right to work===

The employee is always entitled to be paid during his employment and the required notice period; they are often also entitled to work. Requiring the employee to spend the time in leisure (i.e. at home, on vacation, etc.) in order to &quot;get them out of the way&quot; can be considered illegal, even though it may be usually considered a benefit to the employee.

If an employer wants an exiting employee out of the way and does not have the contractual right to put him on garden leave, or pay him in lieu of notice, then the only options are to encourage the use of holiday and offer a compromise agreement to waive his right to sue, in return for the intentional breach of contract. Sometimes the breach turns the termination payment into compensation rather than wages, making it tax-free, so the employee may be only too happy to go along with the ruse.

===Remedies===

In a tribunal the remedy would be compensation; in court the remedy would be damages but rarely an injunction. An injunction could be awarded to enforce a contractual disciplinary procedure, but because compensation is usually an adequate remedy for premature termination, an injunction is generally not available to keep a job going, even in a redundancy situation where the selection process has been circumvented.
Action for wrongful dismissal can be brought within 6 years following the breach of an employment contract.

===Compensation===

====Losses====
For the notice period the employer must pay wages (including any anticipated pay rise) and benefits except holiday;
for wrongful dismissal, it is only possible to claim for lost earnings and damage to reputation, not for the manner of dismissal.

====Benefits====
Benefits include:
* pension,
* commission accrued and owed,
* bonus,
* overtime,
* accrued holiday on unpaid sick leave,
* income protection benefit and personal use of company car (usually running cost or hire car).

Share options will often be excluded by small print.

====Bonuses====
To avoid arguments about whether these would have been earned, it may make sense to compromise by paying the usual sort of overtime or bonus the employee would have gotten if working. Courts are astute to employers trying to wriggle out of paying commission with arguments like &quot;it was not triggered because we dismissed him before pay day&quot;. The employer is under a duty to act in good faith, not to exercise discretion spitefully or in bad faith and not to act perversely, irrationally or capriciously.

====Deductions====
The deductions that can be made from compensation are:
* replacement earnings or what the employee should have earned had he bothered to try (failure to mitigate),
* social security actually received or which could have been had he bothered to apply and
* compensation already awarded for unfair dismissal under the same heading.

====Mitigation====
Because it is a contract claim, the employee has a duty to mitigate his loss by seeking employment, as soon as possible, for as high a wage as possible;so the tribunal or court would deduct earnings from a new job, during the correct notice period from compensation due, but if the employer attempts to do this unilaterally, it may simply trigger a claim that would not otherwise have happened, had it turned a blind eye to the employee making a couple of weeks&#x27; wages out of the situation. Due to the disproportionate cost of employment litigations, it is usually sensible for an employer to err on the side of generosity, trying to ensure the parting of ways is amicable rather than showing off how many loopholes can be found.
Pensions cannot be deducted.
It is possible for a contract to be worded so as to make the pay in lieu of notice a debt, to which the employee is entitled even if he gets a new job the next day.

==Risks==

===Breaches of contract===

Wrongful dismissal is the lesser type of unlawful dismissal, costing only what it would have done to keep the employee during the notice period, but it can be slightly dangerous for the employer, due to the potential loss of restrictive covenants and due to the employee being able to start alleging all sorts of breaches of contract, to try to use up the £25,000 breach of contract allowance in a tribunal, and if he takes the employer to court instead there is no limit and it could end with significantly high costs.

====Examples====

Breaches of contract by the employer serious enough to create a wrongful dismissal are also a constructive dismissal; wrongful dismissals not caused by insufficient notice would have been caused by another breach, such as of the duty not to destroy the mutual bond of trust, and have included failure to inform of pension rights.
The employer has no duty to act what would normally be called in good faith, but must not act in bad faith or insufficiently in good faith such that it breaks the mutual bond of trust. The obligation is usually not to do anything bad as opposed to doing something good.

====Losses====

The employee could allege extra breaches of contract and losses including:

* loss of earnings and psychiatrist fees for psychiatric injury caused by wrongful dismissal,
* loss of earnings for the time it would have taken to follow the correct disciplinary procedure,
* loss of earnings for unpaid sick leave caused by bullying,
* loss of earnings caused by demotion,
* loss of earnings caused by stigma of association with a corrupt employer affecting many employees (as opposed to an incident of dishonesty),
* redundancy pay lost due to being terminated just before they would have qualified for two years&#x27; service, and
* loss of health insurance.

==Defences==

Successful defences have been:
* the employer discovers that the employee was in such serious breach, that he could have been summarily dismissed,
* the contract allowed dismissal without disciplinary procedure, as long as notice was given or paid in lieu.

==Relation to unfair dismissal==

A wrongful dismissal can be a fair or unfair dismissal, just as an unfair dismissal may or may not be a wrongful dismissal in terms of whether the correct notice was given.

If the employee had two year&#x27;s service he could claim unfair dismissal if there was something wrong with the decision to dismiss as opposed to the length of notice. If the wrongfulness was the lack of grounds then is it pretty certain to also be an unfair dismissal.

The unfair dismissal claim would, if he is well advised, be in respect of the post-termination period and sue in court for wrongful dismissal in respect of the notice period, thus stretching out the statutory limits by making the unfair dismissal limit only start running from a later date to allow perhaps more loss of earnings and ignoring the breach of contract limit by using the court instead of tribunal to deal with wrongful dismissal. The burden of proving double recovery is on the employer and tribunal awards for unfair dismissal can be vague as to what and when they are for.

==Relation to constructive dismissal==
A wrongful dismissal can be actual or constructive, but a constructive dismissal is almost certain to be a wrongful one, since the correct notice will not have been given if the dismissal was caused by a resignation, itself caused by the employer&#x27;s serious breach of contract. An employee who was constructively dismissed, as well as possibly having a claim for breach of the duty not to destroy the bond of mutual trust, will usually have a claim for wrongful dismissal. As only economic loss can be claimed for breach of contract, the main loss will be earnings due to the lost notice period, as opposed to any disgruntlement about the manner or reason for dismissal, so the constructive nature of the dismissal tends to disappear into the claim for lost notice period.

<text>Latimeria is a rare genus of fish which contains the two only living species of coelacanth. It includes two extant species: the West Indian Ocean coelacanth (&quot;Latimeria chalumnae&quot;) and the Indonesian coelacanth (&quot;Latimeria menadoensis&quot;). They follow the oldest known living lineage of Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish and tetrapods), which means they are more closely related to lungfish and tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles and mammals) than to the common ray-finned fishes and cartilaginous fishes.

They are found along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Indonesia. Since there are only two known species of coelacanth and both are threatened, it is one of the most endangered genera of animals in the world. The West Indian Ocean coelacanth is a critically endangered species.

==Biological characteristics==
Based on growth rings in the creatures&#x27; ear bones (otoliths), scientists infer that individual coelacanths may live as long as 80 to 100 years. Coelacanths live as deep as 700 m (2300 ft) below sea level, but are more commonly found at depths of .

Living examples of &quot;Latimeria chalumnae&quot; have a deep blue color which probably camouflages them from prey species; however, the Indonesian species (&quot;L. menadoensis&quot;) is brown.

Coelacanth eyes are very sensitive, and have a &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot;. Coelacanths are almost never caught in the daytime, but have been caught at all phases of the moon. Coelacanth eyes have many rods, receptors in the retina that help animals see in dim light. Together, the rods and tapetum help the fish see better in dark water.

Coelacanths are opportunistic feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, and other fish found in their deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards or belly up to locate their prey, presumably using their rostral glands.

Scientists suspect that one reason this fish has been so successful is that specimens are able to slow down their metabolisms at will, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements in a sort of hibernation mode.

The coelacanths which live near Sodwana Bay, South Africa, rest in caves at depths of during daylight hours, but disperse and swim to depths as shallow as when hunting at night. The depth is not as important as their need for very dim light and, more importantly, for water which has a temperature of . They will rise or sink to find these conditions. The amount of oxygen their blood can absorb from the water through the gills is dependent on water temperature.

Scientific research suggests the coelacanth must stay in cold, well-oxygenated water or else its blood cannot absorb enough oxygen. The fish seems to be very well adapted to its environment, which is seen as one of the reasons why it has the slowest evolving genome of all known vertebrates.

===Reproduction===
Female coelacanths give birth to live young, called &quot;pups&quot;, in groups of between five and 25 fry at a time; the pups are capable of surviving on their own immediately after birth. Their reproductive behaviors are not well known, but it is believed that they are not sexually mature until after 20 years of age. It was thought that gestation time was 13 to 15 months, though research carried out in 2021 now suggests a gestation period of up to five years.

==Discoveries==

===First find in South Africa===

On December 23, 1938, Hendrik Goosen, the captain of the trawler &quot;Nerine&quot;, returned to the harbour at East London, South Africa, after a trawl between the Chalumna and Ncera Rivers. As he frequently did, he telephoned his friend, Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, curator at East London&#x27;s small museum, to see if she wanted to look over the contents of the catch for anything interesting, and told her of the strange fish he has set aside for her.

Correspondence in the archives of the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB, formerly the JLB Smith Institute of Ichthyology) show that Goosen went to great lengths to avoid any damage to this fish and ordered his crew to set it aside for the East London Museum. Goosen later told how the fish was steely blue when first seen, but by the time the &#x27;Nerine&#x27; entered East London harbour many hours later, the fish had become dark grey.

Failing to find a description of the creature in any of her books, she attempted to contact her friend, Professor James Leonard Brierley Smith, but he was away for Christmas. Unable to preserve the fish, she reluctantly sent it to a taxidermist. When Smith returned, he immediately recognized it as a type of coelacanth, a group of fish previously known only from fossils. Smith named the new coelacanth &quot;Latimeria chalumnae&quot; in honor of Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer and the waters in which it was found. The two discoverers received immediate recognition, and the fish became known as a &quot;living fossil&quot;. The 1938 coelacanth is still on display in the East London, South Africa, museum.

However, as the specimen had been stuffed, the gills and skeleton were not available for examination, and some doubt therefore remained as to whether it was truly the same species. Smith began a hunt for a second specimen that would take more than a decade.

===Comoros===

Smith distributed thousands of flyers with a photograph of the fish, description, and reward, but World War II interrupted the search. He also did not know that the 1938 specimen near South Africa was about south of its normal habitat. The 100 Pound sterling reward was a very substantial sum to the average subsistence fisherman of the time. Fourteen years later, one specimen was found in the Comoros, but the fish was no stranger to the locals; in the port of Domoni on the Comoran island of Anjouan, the Comorians were puzzled to be so rewarded for a &quot;gombessa&quot; or &quot;mame&quot;, their names for the nearly inedible fish that their fishermen occasionally caught by mistake.

The second specimen, found just before Christmas 1952 by Comoran fisherman Ahamadi Abdallah, was described as a different species, first as &quot;Malania hunti&quot; and later as &quot;Malania anjounae&quot;, after Daniel François Malan, the South African Prime Minister who had dispatched an SAAF Dakota at the behest of Professor Smith to fetch the specimen. It was later discovered that the lack of a first dorsal fin, at first thought to be significant, was caused by an injury early in the specimen&#x27;s life. Malan was a staunch creationist; when he was first shown the primitive creature, he exclaimed, with a twinkle, &quot;My, it is ugly. Do you mean to say we once looked like that?&quot; The specimen retrieved by Smith is on display at the SAIAB in Grahamstown, South Africa where he worked.

A third specimen was caught in September 1953 and a fourth in January 1954. The Comorans are now aware of the significance of the endangered species, and have established a program to return accidentally-caught coelacanth to deep water.

As for Smith, who died in 1968, his account of the coelacanth story appeared in the book &quot;Old Fourlegs&quot;, first published in 1956. His book &quot;Sea Fishes of the Indian Ocean&quot;, illustrated and co-authored by his wife Margaret, remains the standard ichthyological reference for the region.

In 1988, marine biologist Hans Fricke was the first to photograph the species in its natural habitat, off Grand Comoro&#x27;s west coast.

===Second species in Indonesia===

On September 18, 1997, Arnaz and Mark Erdmann, traveling in Indonesia on their honeymoon, saw a strange fish enter the market at Manado Tua, on the island of Sulawesi. Mark thought it was a &quot;gombessa&quot; (Comoro coelacanth), although it was brown, not blue. An expert noticed their pictures on the Internet and realized its significance. Subsequently, the Erdmanns contacted local fishermen and asked for any future catches of the fish to be brought to them.

A second Indonesian specimen, 1.2 m in length and weighing 29 kg, was captured alive on July 30, 1998. It lived for six hours, allowing scientists to photographically document its coloration, fin movements and general behavior. The specimen was preserved and donated to the Bogor Zoological Museum, part of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences.

DNA testing revealed this specimen differed genetically from the Comorian population. Superficially, the Indonesian coelacanth, locally called &quot;raja laut&quot; (king of the sea), appears to be the same as those found in the Comoros, except the background coloration of the skin is brownish-gray rather than bluish. This fish was described in a 1999 issue of &quot;Comptes Rendus de l&#x27;Académie des sciences Paris&quot; by Pouyaud et al. It was given the scientific name &quot;Latimeria menadoensis&quot;. A recent molecular study estimated the divergence time between the two coelacanth species to be 40–30 mya.

On May 19, 2007, Justinus Lahama, an Indonesian fisherman, caught a 1.3-metre-long, 50 kg/110 pound coelacanth off the coast near Manado, on northern Sulawesi Island near Bunaken National Marine Park. After spending 30 minutes out of water, the fish, still alive, was placed in a netted pool in front of a restaurant at the edge of the sea. It survived for 17 hours. Coelacanths usually live at depths of 200–1,000 metres. The fish was filmed by local authorities swimming in the metre-deep pool, then frozen after it died. AFP claim French, Japanese and Indonesian scientists working with the French Institute for Development and Research carried out a necropsy on the coelacanth with genetic analysis to follow.
The local university is now studying the carcass.

===iSimangaliso Wetland Park in South Africa===
In South Africa, the search continued on and off over the years. A 46-year-old diver, Rehan Bouwer, lost his life searching for coelacanths in June 1998.

On 28 October 2000, just south of the Mozambique border in Sodwana Bay in the St. Lucia Marine Protected Area, three deep-water divers, Pieter Venter, Peter Timm, and Etienne le Roux, made a dive to 104 metres and unexpectedly spotted a coelacanth.

Calling themselves &quot;SA Coelacanth Expedition 2000&quot;, the group returned with photographic equipment and several additional members. On 27 November, after an unsuccessful initial dive the previous day, four members of the group, Pieter Venter, Gilbert Gunn, Christo Serfontein, and Dennis Harding, found three coelacanths. The largest was between 1.5 and 1.8 metres in length; the other two were from 1.0 to 1.2 metres. The fish swam head-down and appeared to be feeding from the cavern ledges. The group returned with video footage and photographs of the coelacanths.

During the dive, however, Serfontein lost consciousness, and 34-year-old Dennis Harding rose to the surface with him in an uncontrolled ascent. Harding complained of neck pains and died from a cerebral embolism while on the boat. Serfontein recovered after being taken underwater for decompression sickness treatment.

In March–April 2002, the Jago Submersible and Fricke Dive Team descended into the depths off Sodwana and observed 15 coelacanths. A dart probe was used to collect tissue samples.

===Tanzania===
Coelacanths have been caught off the coast of Tanzania since 2004. Two coelacanths were initially reported captured off Songo Mnara, a small island off the edge of the Indian Ocean in August 2003. A spate of 19 more specimens of these extremely rare fishes weighing between 25 and 80 kg were reported netted in the space of the next five months, with another specimen captured in January 2005. A coelacanth weighing as much as 110 kg was reported by the Observer newspaper in 2006.

Officials of the Tanga Coastal Zone Conservation and Development Programme, which has a long-term strategy for protecting the species, see a connection with the timing of the captures with trawling - especially by Japanese vessels - near the coelacanth&#x27;s habitat, as within a couple of days of trawlers casting their nets, coelacanths have turned up in deep-water gill nets intended for sharks. The sudden appearance of the coelacanths off Tanzania has raised real worries about its future due to damage done to the coelacanth population by the effects of indiscriminate trawling methods and habitat damage.

Hassan Kolombo, a programme co-ordinator, said, &quot;Once we do not have trawlers, we don&#x27;t get the coelacanths, it&#x27;s as simple as that.&quot; His colleague, Solomon Makoloweka, said they had been pressuring the Tanzanian government to limit trawlers&#x27; activities. He said, &quot;I suppose we should be grateful to these trawlers, because they have revealed this amazing and unique fish population. But we are concerned they could destroy these precious things. We want the government to limit their activity and to help fund a proper research program so that we can learn more about the coelacanths and protect them.&quot;

In a March 2008 report, the Tanzania Natural Resource Forum, a local environmental nongovernmental organization, warned that a proposed port project at Mwambani Bay could threaten a coastal population of coelacanth.

== Evolutionary relationships ==
&quot;Latimeria&quot; is the type genus of Latimeriidae, a group of coelacanths that first appeared in the Early Triassic. Within Latimeriidae, it has been found by cladistic analysis to be most closely related to the genus &quot;Swenzia&quot;, known from the Late Jurassic of Europe, leaving a long ghost lineage of over 150 million years from its closest relative.

<text>Saint Peter&#x27;s Square (, ) is a large plaza located directly in front of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City, the papal enclave in Rome, directly west of the neighborhood (rione) of Borgo. Both the square and the basilica are named after Saint Peter, an apostle of Jesus whom Catholics consider the first Pope.

At the centre of the square is the Vatican obelisk, an ancient Egyptian obelisk erected at the current site in 1586. Gian Lorenzo Bernini designed the square almost 100 years later, including the massive Tuscan colonnades, four columns deep, which embrace visitors in &quot;the maternal arms of Mother Church&quot;. A granite fountain constructed by Bernini in 1675 matches another fountain designed by Carlo Maderno in 1613.

The open space which lies before the basilica was redesigned by Gian Lorenzo Bernini from 1656 to 1667, under the direction of Pope Alexander VII, as an appropriate forecourt, designed &quot;so that the greatest number of people could see the Pope give his blessing, either from the middle of the façade of the church or from a window in the Vatican Palace&quot;. Bernini had been working on the interior of St. Peter&#x27;s for decades; now he gave order to the space with his renowned colonnades, using a Tuscan order, to avoid competing with the palace-like façade by Carlo Maderno, but he employed it on an unprecedented colossal scale to suit the space and evoke a sense of awe.
There were many constraints from existing structures (&quot;illustration, right&quot;). The massed accretions of the Vatican Palace crowded the space to the right of the basilica&#x27;s façade; the structures needed to be masked without obscuring the papal apartments. The Vatican obelisk marked a centre, and a granite fountain by Maderno stood to one side: Bernini made the fountain appear to be one of the foci of the ovato tondo embraced by his colonnades and eventually matched it on the other side, in 1675, just five years before his death. The trapezoidal shape of the piazza, which creates a heightened perspective for a visitor leaving the basilica and has been praised as a masterstroke of Baroque theater (&quot;illustration, below right&quot;), is largely a product of site constraints.

According to the Lateran Treaty the area of St. Peter&#x27;s Square is subject to the authority of Italian police for crowd control even though it is a part of the Vatican state.

===Colonnades===

The colossal Tuscan colonnades, four columns deep, frame the trapezoidal entrance to the basilica and the massive elliptical area which precedes it. The ovato tondo&#x27;s long axis, parallel to the basilica&#x27;s façade, creates a pause in the sequence of forward movements that is characteristic of a Baroque monumental approach. The colonnades define the piazza. The elliptical center of the piazza, which contrasts with the trapezoidal entrance, encloses the visitor with &quot;the maternal arms of Mother Church&quot; in Bernini&#x27;s expression. On the south side, the colonnades define and formalize the space, with the Barberini Gardens still rising to a skyline of umbrella pines. On the north side, the colonnade masks an assortment of Vatican structures; the upper stories of the Vatican Palace rise above.

===Obelisk===
At the center of the &quot;ovato tondo&quot; stands the Vatican obelisk, an uninscribed Egyptian obelisk of red granite, tall, supported on bronze lions and surmounted by the Chigi arms in bronze, in all to the cross on its top. The obelisk was originally erected in Heliopolis, Egypt, by an unknown pharaoh.
The Emperor Augustus had the obelisk moved to the Julian Forum of Alexandria, where it stood until AD 37, when Caligula ordered the forum demolished and the obelisk transferred to Rome. He had it placed on the spina which ran along the center of the Circus of Nero.
It was moved to its current site in 1586 by the engineer-architect Domenico Fontana under the direction of Pope Sixtus V; the engineering feat of re-erecting its vast weight was memorialized in a suite of engravings. The obelisk is the only obelisk in Rome that has not toppled since antiquity. During the Middle Ages, the gilt ball atop the obelisk was believed to contain the ashes of Julius Caesar. Fontana later removed the ancient metal ball, now in a Roman museum, and found only dust inside; Christopher Hibbert, however, writes that the ball was found to be solid. Though Bernini had no influence in the erection of the obelisk, he did use it as the centerpiece of his magnificent piazza, and added the Chigi arms to the top in honor of his patron, Alexander VII.


===Paving===
The paving is varied by radiating lines in travertine, to relieve what might otherwise be a sea of setts. In 1817 circular stones were set to mark the tip of the obelisk&#x27;s shadow at noon as the sun entered each of the signs of the zodiac, making the obelisk a gigantic sundial&#x27;s gnomon. Below is a view of St. Peter&#x27;s Square from the cupola (the top of the dome) which was taken in June 2007.

===Spina===
St. Peter&#x27;s Square today can be reached from the Ponte Sant&#x27;Angelo along the grand approach of the Via della Conciliazione (in honor of the Lateran Treaty of 1929). The &quot;spina&quot; (median with buildings which divided the two roads of &quot;Borgo Vecchio&quot; and &quot;Borgo nuovo&quot;) which once occupied this grand avenue leading to the square was demolished ceremonially by Benito Mussolini himself on October 23, 1936, and was completely demolished by October 8, 1937. St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica was now freely visible from the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. After the spina, almost all the buildings south of the passetto were demolished between 1937 and 1950, obliterating one of the most important medieval and renaissance quarters of the city. Moreover, the demolition of the spina canceled the characteristic Baroque surprise, nowadays maintained only for visitors coming from &quot;Borgo Santo Spirito&quot;. The Via della Conciliazione was completed in time for the Great Jubilee of 1950.

<doc id="894047" wikidata="Q1069922" url="?curid=894047" title="Ko Pha-ngan">
<text>Ko Pha-ngan (, , ) is an island in the Gulf of Thailand in Surat Thani Province of southern Thailand. Ko Pha-ngan has two sister islands: the larger Ko Samui to the south and the smaller Ko Tao to the north.

* Estimated perimeter: (estimated 10 hr average walking time)
* From mainland: about 
* From Ko Samui: about 
* From Ko Tao: about 
* Main town: Thong Sala
* Highest Point: Khao Ra, 

==History==
The name Ko Pha-ngan derives from the word &quot;ngan&quot;, meaning &quot;sandbar&quot; in southern Thai. There are many sandbars offshore.

Ko Pha-ngan has been a longtime favorite of past kings of Thailand. King Chulalongkorn (King Rama V) visited Ko Pha-ngan 14 times during his reign.

The Bronze Drum of Dongson Culture (500–100 BCE) that was found on Ko Samui in 1977 is evidence that there were settlements of people on Ko Samui, Ko Pha-ngan, and their islets more than 2,000 years ago. Some historians and archaeologists believe that the first group to migrate to Ko Pha-ngan were Austronesian peoples who traveled by boat from the Malay Peninsula.

==Transport==

There used to be an option to reach Ko Pha-ngan by car ferry from Ko Samui (Raja Ferry Port, which is from Ko Pha-ngan) and from Donsak on the mainland.

Since 2012 Kannithi Aviation (Kan Air) has attempted to construct Ko Pha-ngan Airport on the island. Kan Air has spent 500 million baht to acquire about of land to build a passenger terminal capable of handling 1,000 passengers a day and a runway to accommodate turboprop aircraft such as Kan Air&#x27;s ATR 72-600 series. The project, originally estimated at 900 million baht, now estimated to cost two billion baht, has faced inflated costs, delays resulting from the yet-to-be-issued environmental impact assessment, and other complications, which pushed back initial plans to open in 2014.

==Administration==
=== Central administration ===
Ko Pha-ngan together with Ko Tao and a few minor islands forms the district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) Ko Pha-ngan (). The district is divided into three subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 17 administrative villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

=== Local administration ===
The district has four subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambons&quot;):
* Ko Pha-ngan (Thai: ) consisting of parts of subdistricts Ko Pha-ngan and Ban Tai.
* Phet Pha-ngan (Thai: ) consisting of parts of subdistrict Ko Pha-ngan.
* Ban Tai (Thai: ) consisting of parts of subdistrict Ban Tai.
* Ko Tao (Thai: ) consisting of subdistrict Ko Tao.

===History===
Originally the island was administered by Ko Samui District. The minor district (&quot;king amphoe&quot;) Ko Pha-ngan was established on 1 October 1970, then consisting of the two &quot;tambons&quot;, Ko Pha-ngan and Ban Tai. It was upgraded to a full district on 12 April 1977. Ko Tao subdistrict was established on 15 August 1982 by splitting off the three administrative villages on Ko Tao Island from Ko Phangan subdistrict.

==Environmental issues==
 the island receives about 458,000 visitors per year. They and the island residents generate about 7,300 tonnes of solid waste per year. Untreated wastewater discharges and ongoing coral bleaching are also issues.

The Thai government, the local government, local nonprofit organizations such as EcoThailand Foundation and Trash Hero, local businesses such as the Sea Flower Bungalows, Sarikantang Resort, and locals, both Thai citizens and expatriates, have worked for years to preserve, clean, and restore Koh Phangan, which is unique in the Gulf of Thailand.

Onep deputy secretary-general Noppadol Thiyajai said, &quot;We hope the declaration will at least help maintain the environment on the islands. We understand the measure may not result in significant environmental improvements, but it is better than having nothing.&quot;

The TAT has helped the island to be promoted as a Green Island following the strong will of its inhabitants.

The fauna and flora of the island of Koh Phangan is exceptional, rare pink dolphins are even spotted its waters.

The island is regularly under the spotlights for its remarkable community involving both Thai and Foreigners working more and more together for a sustainable and socially fair tourism benefiting directly the local community.

The island is also strongly engaged in organic sustainable farming producing and produces a large amount of organic fruits, vegetables, fertilisers and insect repellents. The Raitiaviset farm is a perfect example of this success.

==In popular culture==
Ko Pha-ngan featured prominently in Alex Garland&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;The Beach&quot; and is also mentioned in the 2006 song Magick by the new rave band Klaxons (but probably more as a reference to the 1996 novel The Beach than the island itself).

The song &quot;Vision in Blue&quot; on the album The Golden Ratio by Ace of Base mentions Ko Pha-ngan.

DJ/producer Ashley Wallbridge titled his 2012 song &quot;Kopanang&quot;, an anglicized version of Ko Pha-ngan.

The British psychedelic rock band Ozric Tentacles featured a song called Ko Pha-ngan on their 1989 album &quot;The Bits Between The Bits&quot;.

In 2016, Infected Mushroom collaborated with Hatikva 6 to release a song called &quot;Hotel Koh Phangan.&quot;

Drain Gang collaborative album Trash Island was created on Ko Pha-ngan, with most of its tracks being recorded in a vacation home on the island, and a set of individual covers of each song also shot on various points on the island. The album cover is a picture of a trash fire occurring on the island at the time.

In 2022, Vice reporter Tir Dhondy visited the island and enrolled in multiple sexual, tantric classes run by various Gurus.

==Education==
=== Thai schools ===
There are about 10 Thai governmental schools for children on Koh Phangan. The education is free, but the learners are required to speak and write in Thai Language.

=== Schools for foreigners ===
There are some private educational institutions following the national curriculum of England.

=== Nurseries ===
The Learning Tree Nursery &amp; Kindergarten was opened in 2008 for children 2 to 7 years old.

Seeds of Phangan Kindergarten ages 2-5.

Babelikoh nursery was opened in 2022 for toddlers from 1 to 3 years old.

=== Primary ===
Si Ri Panya International School opened in 2012 provides education for children 5 to 11 years old (Key stages 1 &amp; 3).

=== Secondary ===
Si Ri Panya International School provides education for children ages 11–16 (Key stage 3) following the British National Curriculum and the Cambridge Curriculum.

=== Tutorial &amp; vocational ===
Wisdom College Tutorial and Vocational school starts Forest Schools primary programme for children 7-9 years old.

Wisdom College Tutorial and Vocational School mirrors the Cambridge curriculum for children 10 to 18 years old (Key stage 3).

<text>Beira () is the capital and largest city of Sofala Province, in the central region of Mozambique. 

Beira is where the Pungwe River meets the Indian Ocean. It is the fourth-largest city by population in Mozambique, after Maputo, Matola and Nampula. Beira had a population of 397,368 in 1997, which grew to 530,604 in 2019. A coastal city, it holds the regionally significant Port of Beira, which acts as a gateway for both the central interior portion of the country as well as the land-locked nations of Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi.

Originally called Chiveve after a local river, it was renamed Beira to honour the Portuguese Crown prince Dom Luís Filipe (titled Prince of Beira, itself referring to the traditional Portuguese province of Beira), who had visited Mozambique in the early 19th century. It was first developed by the Portuguese Mozambique Company in the 19th century, supplanting Sofala as the country&#x27;s main port. It was then directly developed by the Portuguese colonial government from 1947 until Mozambique gained its independence from Portugal in 1975. Beira is the second largest seaport for international cargo transportation to Mozambique after Maputo. In March 2019, the city was heavily damaged by Cyclone Idai, destroying up to 90% of the city.

==Geography==
Beira is located on the Mozambique Channel, an arm of the Indian Ocean located between Madagascar and Mozambique. The city sits north of the mouth of the convergence of two major rivers of Mozambique: the Buzi River and the Pungwe River. The Buzi crosses across Manica and Sofala provinces to form a wide estuary. The Pungwe crosses from the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe also through Manica and Sofala provinces to Beira.

==History==
The city was established in 1890 by the Portuguese and soon supplanted Sofala as the main port in the Portuguese-administered territory. Originally called Chiveve, after a local river, it was renamed to honor the Portuguese Crown prince Dom Luís Filipe who, in 1907, was the first member of the Portuguese royal family to visit Mozambique. Traditionally the Portuguese Crown prince carried the title of Prince of Beira, a historical province of mainland Portugal.

The Portuguese built the port and a railway to Rhodesia, Portuguese families settled in the newly founded locality and started to develop commercial activities. With the growth of the village, in 1907 the Portuguese Crown elevated Beira to the status of city (&quot;cidade&quot;). Headquarters of the &quot;Companhia de Moçambique&quot; (Mozambique Company) from 1891, the city&#x27;s administration passed from the trading company to the Portuguese government in 1942.

In 1966, the construction of a new railway station was completed. Before Mozambique&#x27;s independence from Portugal, as a city of Portuguese Mozambique, Beira was noted for its well-equipped seaport, one of the major facilities of its kind in all East Africa, tourism, fishing and trade. The city prospered as a cosmopolitan port with different ethnic communities (Portuguese, Indian, Chinese, Bantus such as the Sena and Ndau) employed in administration, commerce, and industry.

A large English-speaking population was the result of being a favourite holiday destination for white Rhodesians. One reminder of this is the Grande Hotel, built by the Portuguese, near the shore of the Indian Ocean. By 1970, the city of Beira had 113,770 inhabitants.

===Independence===

After independence from Portugal in 1975, many white ethnic Portuguese left the city. Mozambique was ravaged by a civil war from 1977 to 1992, opposing Marxist FRELIMO, which controlled the government, to the rebels of RENAMO, descending to near total chaos in a couple of years. The famine, disease and poverty-stricken country collapsed. In Beira, the famous Grande Hotel was occupied by around 1,000 homeless Beirans, and by the end of the civil war it was in near-ruins.

The 2000 Mozambique flood devastated Beira and the surrounding region, leaving millions homeless and severely damaging the local economy.

During the campaign for the local elections in 2013, which culminated in the victory of the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) in the municipality, the Munhava district was the scene of violent clashes between police and supporters of the MDM.

In 2019, Cyclone Idai caused extreme devastation in Beira. It struck the city on March 14, 2019, with winds of up to 177 km/h (106 mph), and caused flooding up to six meters deep across Mozambique.

== Climate ==
Beira features a tropical savanna climate (Köppen Aw). Average temperature in January is and in July (the coldest month) it&#x27;s . The rainy season runs roughly from November to April.

== Water and Sanitation ==
Access to drinking water and sanitation in Mozambique was historically a major problem, alike many of the sub-Saharan African nations. It has been estimated that in developing countries, around 80% of all disease arises as a direct result of inadequate sanitation, poor hygiene, and contaminated water.

According to the United Nations Environment Programme, each day around six thousand people die from diseases caused by poor sanitation, while another 300 million Africans have no access to clean water.

For Mozambique in 1992, around a fifth of the country&#x27;s households had access to potable water and the situation for wastewater provision was even worse. This was a serious public health issue in an area where cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases are endemic.

With the inauguration of the new water treatment plant at Mutua in May 2007, an important milestone was passed in Mozambique&#x27;s ambitious drive towards improving its provision of potable water and sanitation.

Doubling the supply of water to the cities of Beira and Dondo, the plant was opened by the country&#x27;s President Armando Emílio Guebuza the day after he formally launched the next stage of the project to deal with Beira&#x27;s sewage. Construction of the Beira treatment plant was carried out during a period of 30 months and was completed in June 2012.

This latest part of the scheme consists of rehabilitating the existing sanitation network, together with the construction of a number of new system elements to extend and upgrade the sewers, wastewater treatment facilities and a drainage system.

The new water plant cost €5.6m, while the Beira sanitation system cost €62.65m, with the EU providing €52.95m, and the remaining €9.7m provided by the Mozambique Government.

==Demographics==

==Transportation==
Beira has long been a major trade point for exports coming in and out of Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and other Southern African nations. Because of this, the port of Beira is the second largest in Mozambique.

The importance of the port was shown during the Mozambique Civil War, when Zimbabwean troops protected the Beira–Bulawayo railway and Beira to Mutare highway in order to continue trade. The railway to Zimbabwe was originally in 1890, but was converted to in 1900.

In 2008, the Mozambique transportation minister, Paulo Zucula, stated that the government is planning on modernizing the Beira and more northern Nacala ports for an estimated cost of $900m; $500m and 400m respectively. The government has also stated that it plans on modernizing surrounding railway and highway infrastructure so that the port is better connected to the nation&#x27;s mines.

There is also a ferry service in Beira, linking the city to neighboring cities, including Nova Sofala and other coastal towns. Beira is served by an airport to the northeast of the city, with both domestic and international flights.

==Education==
The city has three public university campuses, namely the Zambeze University (with headquarters and rectory in the city), the Licungo University and the Higher Institute of Health Sciences.

One of the major universities here is the Catholic University of Mozambique which was established in 1996 by the Catholic church and affiliated with the International Federation of Catholic Universities (IFCU). This private university is locally known as Universidade Catolica de Mocambique (UCM) and has been officially recognized by Mozambique&#x27;s Ministry of Education and Culture (or Ministério da Educação e Cultura) which oversees the overall education system.

A second major university is the Jean Piaget University of Mozambique, locally termed da Universidade Jean Piaget de Moçambique(UNIPIAGET). This Portugal based University was founded in 2004 by Instituto Piaget, a non-profit cooperative, and is just one of seven campuses established across the globe.

There is a Portuguese international school, Escola Portuguesa da Beira.

== Places of worship == 
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Beira (Catholic Church), Reformed Church in Mozambique, Igreja Presbiteriana de Moçambique (both World Communion of Reformed Churches), Convenção Baptista de Moçambique (Baptist World Alliance), Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Assemblies of God, Zion Christian Church, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. There are also Muslim mosques.

==Sports==
The city is home to Clube Ferroviário da Beira (basketball).

<doc id="894061" wikidata="Q112407" url="?curid=894061" title="Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)">
<text>Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is a 1976 novel by Tom Robbins.

==Plot summary==
Sissy Hankshaw, the novel&#x27;s protagonist, is a woman born with enormously large thumbs who considers her mutation a gift. The novel covers various topics, including free love, feminism, drug use, birds, political rebellion, animal rights, body odor, religion, and yams. 

Sissy capitalizes on the size of her thumbs by becoming a hitchhiker and subsequently travels to New York. The character becomes a model for The Countess, a male homosexual tycoon of menstrual hygiene products. The tycoon introduces Sissy to a staid Mohawk named Julian Gitche, whom she later marries. In her later travels, she encounters, among many others, a sexually open cowgirl named Bonanza Jellybean and an itinerant escapee from a Japanese internment camp happily mislabeled The Chink, who is presented as a hermetic mystic and, at one point writes on a cave wall, &quot;I believe in everything; nothing is sacred. I believe in nothing; everything is sacred.&quot; and frequently says &quot;Ha Ha Ho Ho and Hee Hee.&quot; A flock of whooping cranes also makes frequent appearances throughout the novel, which includes details of their physical characteristics and migratory patterns. Robbins also inserts himself into the novel (as a character).

==Film adaptation==

The novel was made into a 1993 film directed by Gus Van Sant and starring Uma Thurman, Lorraine Bracco, Pat Morita, Angie Dickinson, Keanu Reeves, John Hurt, Rain Phoenix, Ed Begley, Jr., Carol Kane, Victoria Williams, Sean Young, Crispin Glover, Roseanne Arnold, Buck Henry, and Grace Zabriskie.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;Cowgirls ...&quot; has been considered by Gus Van Sant to be a &#x27;hippy&#x27; novel. Robbins writes short chapters filled with philosophical asides and quips (such as noting that because amoebae reproduce by binary fission, the first amoeba is still alive), often speaking to the reader (chapter 88 begins with the narrator noting that the book now has as many chapters as a piano has keys).

==In popular culture==
* John Cale, formerly of The Velvet Underground, named a song and live album after the novel.
* The band Nightmare of You based the song &quot;Thumbelina&quot; on the book.
* The band The Gaslight Anthem titled a song on their album &quot;The &#x27;59 Sound&quot; after the novel.
* Rodney Crowell named a song after the novel that was recorded by Emmylou Harris on her &quot;Blue Kentucky Girl&quot; album.
* James Lee Stanley released an album of the same name, intended as a soundtrack to the novel.
* Matthew Milia of the band Frontier Ruckus released a mixtape titled &quot;Even F*ckboys Get the Blues&quot;, a play on the novel&#x27;s title.

<text>Black Repartition (BR; ; also known as Black Partition) was a revolutionary organization in Russia in the early 1880s.

Black Repartition was established in August-September 1879 after the split of Zemlya i volya (Land and Liberty) at the Voronezh Congress  the previous June. The name comes from the Russian countryside, where rumors circulated among peasants about the approaching repartition. &quot;Chyornyi&quot; in this context does not literally mean &quot;black&quot;, but instead &quot;general&quot; or &quot;universal&quot;.

Originally, the BR members shared the ideas of &quot;Zemlya i volya&quot;, renounced the necessity of political struggle and were against terror and conspiracy tactics of Narodnaya Volya. BR preferred propaganda and agitation (&#x27;agitprop&#x27;) as their tactics. The organizers of BR’s central body in Saint Petersburg were Georgi Plekhanov, Pavel Akselrod, Osip Aptekman, Lev Deich, Vera Zasulich and others. This group organized a print shop and started publishing magazines &quot;Black repartition&quot; and &quot;Core&quot; (&quot;Зерно&quot;, or Zerno), simultaneously developing ties with students and workers. BR’s peripheral organs were active in Moscow, Kharkov, Kazan, Perm, Saratov, Samara and other cities.

After Plekhanov, Deich, Zasulich and some other BR members had emigrated in the beginning of 1880, Anatoly Bulanov, M.Reshko, K.Zagorsky, M.Sheftel and others replaced them as BR’s leaders. They opened a new printing-house in Minsk and widened their contacts with workers. BR’s central body moved to Moscow.

In the spring of 1880, BR members Yelizaveta Kovalskaya and Nikolai Schedrin organized the Worker’s Union of Southern Russia (&quot;Южнорусский рабочий союз&quot;, or Yuzhnorusskiy rabochiy soyuz), which comprised several hundreds of workers.

By this time, BR’s vision of revolution had changed in a number of ways. The arrests in 1880-1881 significantly weakened the organization. Seeing the success of &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot;, many BR members (Yakov Stefanovich, Bulanov and others) adopted its ideology. By the end of 1881, BR ceased to exist as an organization but separate BR clubs continued to operate up until the mid-1880s. Plekhanov, Deich, Zasulich along with other ex-members of BR embraced Marxism and created the first Russian Marxist organization called Emancipation of Labor (&quot;Освобождение труда&quot;, or Osvobozhdeniye truda) in Geneva in 1883.

==Plot==
The series focused on couple Stanley (Norman Fell) and Helen Roper (Audra Lindley), who were landlords to Jack, Janet and Chrissy on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;.

In this spin-off, the Ropers have sold their apartment building in the &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; episode &quot;An Anniversary Surprise&quot; (season 3, episode 20) to live in the upmarket community of Cheviot Hills, where the social-climbing Helen struggled to fit in with her neighbors. Stanley made little attempt to fit in with the standards of the community, thereby causing Helen much embarrassment.

As was the case during their time on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, opening credits for &quot;The Ropers&quot; alternate between Audra Lindley and Norman Fell being credited first.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* Stanley Roper (Norman Fell) —A lower-middle-class, frugal, and often embarrassing retiree, who moved to Cheviot Hills after he is duped into buying a townhouse

==Creation==
After the enormous success of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; in its short first season in 1977, ABC head Fred Silverman was anxious to capitalize on the show&#x27;s success. In early 1977, Silverman approached Fell and Lindley with the subject of doing a spin-off from the show after its first full season wrapped in the spring of 1978. Both actors as well as the &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; producers backed off as the show had yet to prove itself for an entire season. With the show&#x27;s continued success in its second season, however, the idea was brought up again in 1978, this time by &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&#x27;s&quot; own producers as well as new ABC head Tony Thomopolous (Silverman had gone to NBC). The idea intrigued Lindley, but Fell was extremely reluctant, as he was satisfied with his role on a show that was already a proven hit. Fell feared that a spin-off would be unsuccessful and thus put him out of a good role and a job. To alleviate his fears, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; producers contractually promised Fell that they would give the new series a year to prove itself. If the show were to be canceled prior to that time, then he and Lindley would return to &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. A reluctant Fell agreed to the new terms.

Like &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;The Ropers&quot; was introduced as a late season replacement series in the spring of 1979 premiering the same night as &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; on ABC&#x27;s successful Tuesday night lineup, airing at 10pm. In its first season, the ratings for the show were very high (the show finished at number 8 for the 1978–79 season), and had the second-highest series premiere rating at the time. After the season premiere, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; went on hiatus, but &quot;The Ropers&quot; still did well. ABC reran the episodes over the summer of 1979 (in August on Sundays) where they continued to achieve high ratings leading many to believe that the series would enjoy a long run.

== Cancellation ==
At the beginning of the 1979–80 season, ABC moved the show to Saturdays at 8pm, resulting in an audience drop that put it near the bottom of the ratings. Being placed on Saturday nights, rather than on the ABC Tuesday night lineup, caused an immediate fall into the bottom ten (number 52 out of 61 shows for the week of September 17–23, its second week of the season) as the show was in direct competition with the NBC show &quot;CHiPs&quot;. The show later moved to 8:30pm on Saturdays by January 1980. The move upset Fell to the point that he actually went to ABC headquarters in New York to plead with the network to move the show to a better time slot. His effort was in vain, however, and the show continued to pull in low ratings. The drop in ratings and the fact that the show was not pulling in the key young demographic audience led to announcement of the show&#x27;s cancellation by ABC in May 1980. The last three episodes aired Thursdays at 9:30pm after &quot;Barney Miller&quot; in May 1980. Audra Lindley stated in Chris Mann&#x27;s 1997 book about &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; that she was surprised that &quot;The Ropers&quot; had been cancelled after a late-season surge in the series ratings had allowed it to finish the 1979–80 season at number 25; the Nielsen ratings for that year, however, list the series &quot;Soap&quot; at number 25.

With the series canceled, Fell approached &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; producers about the Ropers returning to the show. However, during the time &quot;The Ropers&quot; was on the air, the landlord characters had been replaced on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; by Ralph Furley (Don Knotts). The addition had worked well and &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; had retained its popularity. The idea of returning Fell and Lindley to their original &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; roles was undesirable to producers and ABC, mainly because they had one character playing the landlord role now as opposed to two, which would require more money to be paid out per episode; the cancellation of &quot;The Ropers&quot; came just as Suzanne Somers began to renegotiate her contract, which would lead to her very public contract dispute during the 1980–81 television season and her departure from the series. The cancellation of &quot;The Ropers&quot; came just one month after the one-year contractual deadline had passed. Fell would later state that he always believed the decision to pull the plug on the show had been made much earlier, but that the network deliberately postponed making the cancellation official until after the one-year mark specifically to be relieved of the obligation to allow Fell and Lindley to return to &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. There was an attempt by producers to sell the show to Silverman over at NBC; Silverman, however, passed on it too.

Despite the hard feelings, in March 1981 both Fell and Lindley made one final guest appearance on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; (in Season 5, Episode #18 &quot;Night of The Ropers&quot;) nearly a year after the end of their own series before the characters were retired for good. For audiences, it was a chance to see all of the three landlord characters – played by Fell, Lindley, and Knotts – on the same stage.

Tambor appeared on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; that same season playing a different character, a wealthy but unwelcome suitor of Chrissy&#x27;s cousin Cindy (Season 5, Episode #13). Tambor also made other guest appearances on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company,&quot; portraying different characters.

The show was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Worst TV Spin-Offs&quot;.

In July 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named &quot;The Ropers&quot; the 49th worst TV series of all time.

== Proposed spin-off ==
In 1986, distributor D. L. Taffner revealed its plans for a spin-off of &quot;The Ropers&quot; called &quot;Three Apartments&quot;. The spin-off would again star Fell and Lindley, this time as landlords of a three-unit apartment building. The show was offered as either a two-year, 44-episode package in syndication starting April 1987, or as a 52-episode package on NBC-owned station checkerboards beginning in September 1987. Guest stars would include John Ritter, Joyce DeWitt, Richard Kline and Don Knotts from &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;; Robert Mandan from &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;; and Jim J. Bullock and Nancy Dussault from &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot;/&quot;The Ted Knight Show&quot;. &quot;Three Apartments&quot; was to replace &quot;The Ted Knight Show&quot;, a fellow Taffner-distributed show that ended production after the death of show namesake Ted Knight in August 1986. The spin-off was withdrawn in January 1987 because of a glut of syndicated sitcom offerings, a lack of time slots, and a difficult advertising market.

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (1979)===
===Season 2 (1979–80)===
===Home Media===
On December 22, 2023, VEI released a special 40th anniversary box set of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; that also includes all episodes of &quot;The Ropers&quot; and &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;.

In September 2024, VEI reissued the complete series in a separate standalone set entitled: &quot;The Ropers- The Complete Series&quot;.

==Syndication==
&quot;The Ropers&quot; was aired in syndication on local channels in the 1980s and early 1990s, but has had limited airings in recent years, likely because, due to its relatively short network run—roughly a season-and-a-half—there are not enough episodes to strip the show. Two episodes of the series, however, play in the syndication package of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. When initially offered in syndication, the series ran under the title Three&#x27;s Company&#x27;s Friends, The Ropers. That version used an instrumental version of the original series&#x27; theme song. Six episodes of the series were aired on TV Land in September 2006, and four episodes were aired on WGN America in October 2008.

Beginning in January 2011 Antenna TV, a television network designed for digital television subchannels and owned by Tribune Broadcasting, aired the sitcom. The series started on Tuesday, February 15, 2011, and went through one entire rotation of all episodes before being removed from the lineup. On August 29, 2011, the show returned to the lineup as the &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; cycle again came to the point of the series where the Ropers left.

Antenna TV usually shows back-to-back episodes of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. But when the cycle comes to the point of the Ropers&#x27; departure, the network then airs &quot;The Ropers&quot; following a single episode of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; until the end of the &quot;Ropers&quot; cycle, then resumes the back-to-back &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; airings.

Beginning in 2015, Antenna TV began airing the series on weekends back to back with the other &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; spin-off series &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;.

The Ropers can currently be seen on Pluto TV channel Classic TV Comedy, Tubi, and Peacock.

<doc id="894083" wikidata="Q907944" url="?curid=894083" title="Unreal mode">
<text>In x86 computing, unreal mode, also big real mode, flat real mode, or voodoo mode is a variant of real mode, in which one or more segment descriptors has been loaded with non-standard values, like 32-bit limits allowing access to the entire memory. Contrary to its name, it is not a separate addressing mode that the x86 processors can operate in. It is used in the 80286 and later x86 processors.

==Mechanism==
For efficiency reasons, the 80286 and all later x86 processors use the base address, size and other attributes stored in their internal segment descriptor cache whenever computing effective memory addresses, even in real mode. Therefore, a modification of the internal segment descriptor allows altering some properties of segments in real mode, like the size of addressable memory. This technique became widely used and is supported by all Intel processors.

A program in unreal mode can call 16-bit code programmed for real mode (BIOS, DOS kernel and drivers) without any thunking. This makes an unreal mode driver simpler than a DPMI driver. However unreal mode is incompatible with protected mode operating systems such as Windows 3.x/9x/NT and OS/2.

Big real mode has a 1 MiB code segment and a 4 GiB data segment.

== Uses ==
HIMEM.SYS uses this feature (both 286 and 386 variants) to address extended memory, unless DOS is switched to run in a virtual 8086 mode that is incompatible with unreal mode.

One of the very few games—if not the only one—that used unreal mode was &quot;Ultima VII&quot;.

Unreal mode is used by BIOS code as this is the initial mode of modern Intel processors. Furthermore, the System Management Mode (SMM) in Intel 386SL and later processors places the processor in huge real mode.

Some boot loaders (such as LILO) use the unreal mode to access up to 4 GiB of memory.

==Enabling unreal mode==
The 80286 microprocessor can be put into unreal mode only with help of the undocumented instruction LOADALL to modify the hidden segment base registers to point to the source or target memory location above 1 MiB.

To put an 80386 or higher microprocessor into unreal mode, a program must first enter protected mode, find or create a flat descriptor in the GDT or LDT, load some of the data segment registers with the respective protected mode &quot;selector&quot;, and then switch back to real mode. After returning to real mode, the processor will continue using the cached descriptors as established in protected mode, thus allowing access to 4 GiB of extended memory from real mode.

Starting with the 80386, real mode programs can use the 32 bit registers with the Address Size Override Prefix. This allows programs to use an address like DS:[EBX]. In normal real mode, a fault occurs if EBX exceeds 0xFFFF. In unreal mode, the access is allowed.

==Variants of unreal mode==
As described above, unreal mode usually involves using one or more data selectors to address data in memory more efficiently. This has been common practice and often referred to as &quot;flat real mode&quot; or &quot;big real mode&quot;. The term &quot;unreal mode&quot; was introduced in 1991 by Rakesh K. Agarwal.

=== 32-bit code ===
The &quot;huge real mode&quot; (named in Ralf Brown&#x27;s interrupt list) or &quot;unREAL&quot; mode (named by Tomasz Grysztar) adds the ability to run 32-bit code with a 4 GiB code segment. This is achieved by loading the code selector (CS) from a descriptor having the 32-bit attribute (&quot;D&quot; bit) set to 1. This mode allows for avoiding Operand Size Override prefixes normally required when using 32-bit addressing in 16-bit code segment, but is more difficult to set up due to interaction with interrupts.

The use of a 32-bit CS was described in Agarwal&#x27;s 1991 article introducing the term &quot;unreal mode&quot;. This mode is used in Grysztar&#x27;s open-source FASM and Helix RM386, a commercial DOS Extender bundled by Logitech mouse drivers. Grysztar wrote a description of techniques used for entering this mode and handling interrupts in 2010. He also reports that most of the CPUs he tested supports this previously-unknown mode, with the exception of a CPU of unknown model (&quot;I think it was manufactured by Cyrix&quot;) and in a later user report, the Bochs and DOSBox emulators.

<doc id="894085" wikidata="Q1846934" url="?curid=894085" title="United States congressional delegations from Montana">
<text>Since Montana became a U.S. state in 1889, it has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years. Before the Seventeenth Amendment took effect in 1913, senators were elected by the Montana State Legislature. Members of the House of Representatives are elected to two-year terms, one from Montana&#x27;s at-large congressional district. Before becoming a state, the Territory of Montana elected a non-voting delegate at-large to Congress from 1864 to 1889.

A total of 54 people have served either the Territory or State of Montana: 17 in the Senate, 32 in the House, and five in both houses. The longest-serving senator is Max Baucus, in office from 1978 to 2014. The longest-serving representative is Pat Williams, in office for 18 years from 1979 to 1997. One woman has been a member of Montana&#x27;s congressional delegation, Jeannette Rankin, as a representative. She was the first woman in the United States Congress.

The current dean of the Montana delegation is Senator Steve Daines, having been a member of Congress since 2013.

==United States Senate==


Each state elects two senators by statewide popular vote every six years. The terms of the two senators are staggered so that they are not elected in the same year. Montana&#x27;s senators are elected in the years from classes I and II. Senators were originally chosen by the Montana Legislature until the Seventeenth Amendment came into force in 1913.

There have been twenty-two senators elected from Montana, of whom fourteen have been Democrats and eight have been Republicans. Montana&#x27;s current senators are Republican Steve Daines, in office since 2015, and Republican Tim Sheehy, in office since 2025.



== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Current representatives ===
&lt;section end=&quot;Current representatives&quot;/&gt;

=== Delegates from Montana Territory===

The Territory of Montana was an organized incorporated territory of the United States formed on May 26, 1864. The territory initially consisted of present-day Montana. The boundaries of the territory did not change during its existence.

The territorial delegates were elected to two-year terms. Delegates were allowed to serve on committees, debate, and submit legislation, but were not permitted to vote on bills. Delegates only served in the House of Representatives as there was no representation in the Senate until Montana became a state.

=== Members of the United States House of Representatives ===
Members of the House of Representatives are elected every two years by popular vote within a congressional district. Montana currently has two congressional districts. Every ten years, the number of congressional districts is reapportioned based on the state&#x27;s population as determined by the United States census; Montana had had two districts from 1913 to 1993 and one at-large district from 1993 to 2023.

There have been 34 people, including just one woman, who have served as representatives from Montana: 15 Democrats, 20 Republicans and 1 Populist. Ryan Zinke and Matt Rosendale are the current officeholders.

<doc id="894090" wikidata="Q7708092" url="?curid=894090" title="Texas State Technical College">
<text>Texas State Technical College (TSTC) is a public technical college with its main campus near Waco, Texas. TSTC is the State of Texas&#x27;s only public multicampus technical college, offering associate degrees and certificates in technical skills and trades on 10 campuses throughout the state. TSTC&#x27;s headquarters are located north of Waco and are co-located with the Waco campus, the oldest TSTC location and flagship location. TSTC also operates campuses in Harlingen, Marshall, Red Oak, Abilene, Breckenridge, Brownwood, Sweetwater, Williamson County, and Fort Bend County.

==History==
TSTC was established in 1965 as the James Connally Technical Institute (JCTI) of Texas A&amp;M University to meet the state&#x27;s evolving workforce needs. At the time, Governor John Connally (no relation) predicted that it would be &quot;the most sophisticated technical-vocational institute in the country.&quot;

In 1967, JCTI expanded to include a South Texas campus in Harlingen.

In 1969, the JCTI colleges separated from Texas A&amp;M University and became an independent state system, with its own board of regents, taking the name Texas State Technical Institute. Texas State Technical Institute-Waco (TSTI-Waco) was the first school in the United States to offer an associate of applied science degree in laser electro-optics technology.
The program began in September 1969. The name changed to its present one in 1991.

As the need for technical education increased in Texas, TSTC opened additional campuses in Amarillo (this campus later left TSTI to become part of Amarillo College) and Sweetwater in 1979, McAllen (1983, no longer part of the system), Abilene (1985), Breckenridge (1989), Brownwood (1991), and Marshall (1991; became a separate college in 1999).

On September 1, 1999, the Marshall extension center was officially designated a stand-alone campus by the Texas Legislature, and it became known as Texas State Technical College Marshall. In 2011, the Legislature redefined the TSTC West Texas campus as one that serves West Texas with four strategically positioned, permanent locations at Sweetwater, Abilene, Breckenridge, and Brownwood. In 2013, the Texas Legislature authorized the creation of an extension center in Ellis County creating TSTC Marshall North Texas Extension Center also known as TSTC North Texas.

In 2015, TSTC and the Greater Fort Bend Economic Development Council unveiled plans to build a permanent campus in Rosenberg. The grand opening was celebrated in the fall a year later, bringing manufacturing, engineering, and information technology programs to the community.

TSTC collaborates with educational partners from throughout Texas to bring additional educational options to students. TSTC has partnerships in Hutto and Richmond working closely with a number of universities, school districts, colleges, and other entities to help provide a strong workforce for the future of Texas.

==Academics==
TSTC is a technical college designed to provide vocational and technical education to people entering the workforce or in the midst of a career change. As such, it primarily offers the associate of applied science (AAS) degree (along with certificates of completion). In 2009, TSTC Harlingen received approval from the Texas Legislature and Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to add associate of science (AS) degrees to its traditional offerings for those students desiring to transfer to a university or enter the workforce directly with an associate of science in biology, computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, nursing preparatory, and health professions. Additionally, the Harlingen college began offering fields of study in combination with the academic core, which when transferred to a Texas public college or university, can substitute for freshman and sophomore major requirements.

The college is accredited to award AAS degrees and certificates of completion by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

==Governance==
The Texas State Technical College is governed by a nine-member board of regents and operated under the direction of a chancellor. These regents, who provide a statewide perspective, are appointed by the governor to six-year terms. The board meets quarterly to provide leadership and enact policies for the successful management and operation of the system. The colleges operate under the rules and regulations of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. The Texas State Technical College Chancellor is Michael L. Reeser.

==Campuses==
===Permanent campuses===
===Extension center===
TSTC administers an extension center in partnership with Temple College at the East Williamson County Higher Education Center in Williamson County.

==Wind power==
In response to the growing need for technical training involving wind power, TSTC Sweetwater created the first community college wind-energy program in Texas, and constructed a demonstration 2MW 60Hz DeWind D8.2 prototype wind turbine for student training in 2007.
Texas State Technical College has partnered with Pinnacle Career Institute in Kansas City to offer the wind turbine technician program.

<doc id="894099" wikidata="Q7490688" url="?curid=894099" title="Shatterday">
<text>&quot;Shatterday&quot; is the first segment of the premiere episode of the first season of the television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The story follows a man who finds that a double of himself has moved into his apartment and is taking over his life. The segment is nearly a one-man show for featured actor Bruce Willis; all the other significant characters appear only offscreen.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Peter Jay Novins is at a bar and accidentally dials his own home phone number. The phone is answered by someone who claims to be Peter Jay Novins and sounds just like him. Flustered, Peter leaves the bar and uses a phone booth to call his house. He gets himself again and begins to believe that the man on the other end of the line is his doppelganger. Peter thinks about heading over to his apartment, but the man on the phone warns him against it and tells him that because Peter&#x27;s life is terrible, he is going to change it.

Peter cashes out his bank account, calls the grocery store and insults them to ensure that Peter B (the doppelganger still in the apartment) cannot get food delivered. He hopes this will force Peter B to eventually leave the apartment and allow him to move back in, reclaiming his life. However, Peter B already used the $200 that was stashed away to stock up on groceries. He tells Peter A that he figures that Peter A is a piece of him that wandered off while he was sleeping. Peter A, however, thinks that it&#x27;s possible that when he went to a friend&#x27;s lab and a picture of his &quot;aura&quot; was taken, it somehow &quot;stole&quot; something from him.

As days go by, Peter A becomes increasingly sick, while Peter B makes major changes to his life: He patches things up with his estranged mother and invites her to live with him, turns down an unethical advertising job that he had previously accepted, tries to make amends with an ex-girlfriend who left her husband to pursue their affair only for Peter to dump her when he tired of their relationship, and plans to marry his current girlfriend and have children. Peter B visits Peter A&#x27;s hotel room to finally meet him face to face, telling him that he is being replaced and is becoming a memory. Peter B reveals that things are going well with him and that he has put his life in order—something Peter A failed to do. He asks Peter A if there is anything he would have done differently. He says no. As Peter B leaves, Peter A wishes him well, shakes his hand, and then disappears.

==Closing narration==
==Production==
This segment is based on the short story of the same name by Harlan Ellison, which was first published September 1975 in &quot;Gallery&quot; and later gave its title to a collection of his short stories. The short story uses all seven days of one week: Someday, Moansday, Duesday, Woundsday, Thornsday, Freeday, Shatterday. Ellison got the idea for the story while living in New York City and waiting for his date at a restaurant. His date was running late so he tried calling her up but, distracted by the noise, dialed his own number instead. After several rings he realized his mistake, and was inspired by thoughts of what would happen if he had answered the phone at his house.

Though the teleplay is credited solely to Alan Brennert, the opening scene was scripted by Ellison himself. Brennert had extensively revised the opening scene from the short story, in which Peter Novins almost immediately accepts that the man on the other end of the line is himself, because this would not be believable in television format. Ellison disliked the revisions and, after he rejected six different drafts of the opening scene by Brennert, executive producer Philip DeGuere suggested that he simply script that scene himself. He inserted the line &quot;Alan, is that you? You imitate me better than anyone else!&quot; as a playful homage to Brennert.

Unlike later episodes, &quot;Shatterday&quot; was shot on film, not video. During filming of one of the hotel scenes, actor Bruce Willis, in a display of method acting, warmed up for the scene by screaming curses and punching the wall behind the bed. This performance caused him to lose his voice over the course of several takes, and the day&#x27;s filming had to be halted early.

In the few shots where the two Peters appear on-screen together, the new Peter was played by Willis, while the old Peter was played by a body double.

==Syndication==
This episode was shown as a stand-alone half-hour episode in syndication on the Chiller TV network instead of one segment from the original hour-long episode.

<doc id="894105" wikidata="Q8031960" url="?curid=894105" title="Wong's Lost and Found Emporium">
<text>&quot;Wong&#x27;s Lost and Found Emporium&quot; is the second segment of the ninth episode of the first season of the television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The segment is based on the short story &quot;Wong&#x27;s Lost and Found Emporium&quot;, by William F. Wu, first published in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in May 1983. It takes place in a mystical shop where ephemeral things such as lost integrity and lost time can be recovered. Its titular lead character, Wong, is portrayed by Brian Tochi.

==Plot==
David Wong, a young Asian American, has spent three years looking for a mysterious place called &quot;The Lost and Found Emporium.&quot; He tracks it down to a backroom of a San Francisco pawn shop, but cannot find any staff. Browsing, David meets an elderly woman who is looking for lost opportunities. He is not interested in her story, but he sees an orb of light floating behind her. Following the orb, which the woman does not see, he finds a cage with mice that have instructions to rub them until they calm down. Believing this is her chance to win back her lost opportunities, the woman tries to do so but the mice escape and scatter. She breaks down in tears and David leaves her.

David meets an elderly man who came to the emporium by accident. He says he lost the respect of his children. With the help of another orb, David points him to a mirror, which he must look at for no less than five and a half minutes. The man is disgusted by what he sees—a distorted, monstrous image of himself. He smashes the mirror and then realizes he has destroyed his chance. David shakes his head and leaves.

David is confronted by a young woman named Melinda who scolds him for his lack of compassion. David says it is his compassion he is after and explains how he lost it due to racial intolerance, in particular the murder of Vincent Chin. Deducing that visitors to the emporium can see other people&#x27;s guiding orbs but not their own, Melinda offers to find his compassion if he finds her lost item. David agrees and follows her orb to an old thermos, which releases a stream of vapor. After inhaling the vapor, Melinda receives back her sense of humor. She points David to three flasks, but won&#x27;t tell him which one contains his compassion.

David smashes the two biggest flasks, regaining his integrity and a childhood memory. The third flask rolls away and is lost. David is unhappy, but decides it is destiny to help other unfortunate souls. Melinda hypothesizes that he gained back some of his compassion with the restoration of his integrity, and volunteers to stay as his assistant. They start by helping the elderly man and woman. Afterwards Melinda puts up a new sign on the entrance: &quot;Wong&#x27;s Lost and Found Emporium: Under new management&quot;.

==Production==
Alan Brennert wrote the teleplay for the episode based on the short story by William F. Wu. Wu got the idea for the story from a prompt given by Harlan Ellison at the Clarion Writers Workshop: &quot;Where do lost things go?&quot; Seven years after the workshop, the full concept of the story popped into his head as he was lying down for a nap. Writer Michael B. Tonin was responsible for bringing the short story to Brennert&#x27;s attention.

The production featured a huge number of &quot;lost item&quot; props, with the crew cracking jokes about having cleaned out the CBS property room. Actress Carol Bruce was shocked when she noticed that one of the prop skeletons was a real human skeleton rather than the usual plastic model. Wu, who was present for the filming and was a fan of Bruce&#x27;s, took the opportunity to chat and have his photo taken with her. Science fiction writer Alison Tellure suggested the idea of a head in a jar which turns out to be alive.

The original short story makes a subtle reference to an earlier short story with a mystic curio shop, &quot;The Chaser&quot; by John Collier, which coincidentally was also developed into a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, albeit for the original series rather than the 1985 incarnation. However, this reference was left out of the TV adaptation.

A sequel episode titled &quot;Missing Person&quot; was developed for season two of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, this time with the teleplay written by William F. Wu himself, but the series was cancelled before it could be filmed. The plot revolved around a person who wakes up to find he is a &quot;lost item&quot; on a shelf in Wong&#x27;s Lost and Found Emporium and cannot leave until someone comes and &quot;finds&quot; him. Though the TV episode was never produced, the short story version of &quot;Missing Person&quot; was published in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, as was a second sequel story, &quot;Indigo Shade, Alizarin Light&quot;. All three Lost and Found Emporium stories were collected in Wu&#x27;s 2020 book &quot;Interlaced Pathways&quot;, which was coincidentally dedicated to Alan Brennert.

According to Brennert, in the early 2000s he was in talks to adapt the episode into a Sci-Fi Channel series in which David and Melinda would interact with a different set of guest stars each week, but nothing came of it.

<text>Subseven (sometimes styled as sub7even or subseven) is a Christian rock band formed in 1999 in Weatherford, Oklahoma. They played for four years as an independent in the Midwest, where they released one album and one EP and gained a large local fan base. In 2003, they signed a record deal with Flicker Records and soon after released &quot;Subseven: the EP&quot;. One year later they released their final album, &quot;Free to Conquer&quot;. 

The band&#x27;s members included Wesley Fite, Clint McManaman, Reed Corbin, Caleb Wilkerson and Jake Sullivan before their breakup in December 2005. Since their breakup in 2005, the band members have engaged in other musical activities, including other bands and solo projects. In November 2007, their bass guitarist, Reed Corbin, died from a heart attack at the age of 33. 

In 2015, the band announced that they would be reuniting and playing a show on July 24, 2015 in Oklahoma City; they have not played a show since.

In 2024, member Clint McManaman was a guest on The BlackSheep Podcast, speaking about the formation, breakup, and future of the band.

<doc id="894139" wikidata="Q12600589" url="?curid=894139" title="Causal contact">
<text>Two entities are in causal contact if there may be an event that has affected both in a causal way. Every object of mass in space, for instance, exerts a field force on all other objects of mass, according to Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. Because this force exerted by one object affects the motion of the other, it can be said that these two objects are in causal contact.

The only objects not in causal contact are those for which there is no event in the history of the universe that could have sent a beam of light to both. For example, if the universe were not expanding and had existed for 10 billion years, anything more than 20 billion light-years away from the earth would not be in causal contact with it. Anything less than 20 billion light-years away &quot;would&quot; because an event occurring 10 billion years in the past that was 10 billion light-years away from both the earth and the object under question could have affected both. Depending on the expansion history of the universe, there may be a time such that there will be no particle horizons: all matter in the universe will be in causal contact. 

A good illustration of this principle is the light cone, which is constructed as follows. Taking as event formula_1 a flash of light (light pulse) at time formula_2, all events that can be reached by this pulse from formula_1 form the future light cone of formula_1, whilst those events that can send a light pulse to formula_1 form the past light cone of formula_1.

Given an event formula_7, the light cone classifies all events in spacetime into 5 distinct categories:

* Events on the future light cone of formula_7.
* Events on the past light cone of formula_7.
* Events inside the future light cone of formula_7 are those affected by the beam of light emitted at formula_7.
* Events inside the past light cone of formula_7 are those that can emit a beam of light and affect what is happening at formula_7.
* All other events are in the (absolute) elsewhere of formula_7 and are those that will never affect and can never be affected by formula_7.

See the causal structure of Minkowski spacetime for a more detailed discussion.

<text>Roderick Edward Maclean ( – 8 June 1921) was a Scotsman who attempted to assassinate Queen Victoria on 2 March 1882, at Windsor, England, with a pistol. This was the last of eight attempts by separate people to kill or assault Victoria over a period of four decades. Maclean&#x27;s motive was purportedly a curt reply to some poetry that he had mailed to the Queen.

The attempted murder followed the arrival of the Royal train, conveying the Queen, Princess Beatrice and the Court from Windsor. Queen Victoria had just walked across the platform of Windsor station to a carriage in waiting when Maclean, who was standing at the entrance of the station yard among a number of spectators, deliberately fired a revolver at her. The shot missed, and Maclean was seized by Chief Superintendent Hayes, of the Borough Police, and the weapon wrenched from his grasp by someone in the crowd. – &quot;Birmingham Daily Gazette&quot;, 1921

Other accounts state that the revolver was a toy and that his aim was disrupted by an Eton schoolboy:

The weapon was a mere toy, and the life of the beloved monarch was not seriously endangered. A number of Eton boys were round the station at the time, and one of them rushed forward and struck Maclean with his umbrella, disconcerting his aim — which was unlikely enough, in any case, to have been accurate. The boy in question, Gordon Chesney Wilson, was called to the Castle by her Majesty and thanked for his promptitude. He was the son of Sir Samuel Wilson, the Australian wool magnate, who introduced salmon into the Australian rivers and afterwards sat in Parliament for a short time for Portsmouth. Gordon Wilson married Lady Sarah Spencer-Churchill, a sister of Lord Randolph and Lady Wimborne. He was killed in the early days of the war. The wretched lunatic, therefore, survived all the other chief actors in his poor little drama, paying dearly for his brief notoriety. He had, however, the distinction of undergoing trial for high treason. – &quot;Lichfield Mercury&quot;, 1921

At his trial, Dr. Charles Vernon Hitchins testified that MacLean had been certified insane in June 1880, two years before the attempted assassination, and he had been sent to Somerset Lunatic Asylum. He was living at 14 Wadham Street in Weston-super-Mare. Dr. Hitchins stated that Maclean was complaining of headaches and believed that all the people in England are against him, and he felt he must injure someone because they are conspiring to deceive him. He had also sent letters to his sister in 1880, Caroline Maclean, stating that, &quot;If I cannot commit a murder one way, I will another way, and all can add is, if there is more difficulty, there may be more victims.&quot; Multiple doctors also testified that Maclean was insane and &quot;did not believe he was capable of appreciating the nature or quality of any act which he might commit.&quot;

Tried for high treason on 20 April, Maclean was found &quot;not guilty, but insane&quot; by a jury after five minutes&#x27; deliberation, overseen by Lord Chief Justice Coleridge, and he lived out his remaining days in Broadmoor Asylum. The verdict prompted the Queen to ask for a change in English law so that those implicated in cases with similar outcomes would be considered as &quot;guilty, but insane&quot;; this led to the Trial of Lunatics Act 1883.

A poem was later written about Maclean&#x27;s attempt on the Queen&#x27;s life by William Topaz McGonagall.

<text>In East Germany, a Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft (LPG) (English: &#x27;Agricultural Production Cooperative&#x27;) was a large, collectivised farm in East Germany, corresponding to the Soviet kolkhoz.

In the agriculture of East Germany, the collectivisation of private and state-owned agricultural land was the progression of a policy of food security (at the expense of large scale bourgeois farmers). It began in the years of Soviet occupation (1945–48) as part of the need to govern resources in the Soviet Sector. Beginning with the forced expropriation of all land holdings in excess of , land was redistributed in small packets of around to incoming landless refugees driven off formerly German-held territories to the east. These &quot;Neubauern&quot; (new farmers) were given limited ownership rights to the land, meaning that they kept it as long as they worked it. In the early 1950s, remaining farmers with largish holdings () were effectively driven out of business through means such as denying access to pooled machinery and by setting production targets that rose exponentially with amount of land owned to levels that were impossible to meet.

Alongside these coercive actions of expropriation, old and new farmers with smaller land holdings were increasingly encouraged to pool resources in a legally constituted cooperative form, the LPG, in which initially just land but later animals and machinery were shared and worked together. These were not &quot;state-owned&quot; farms (although a few of these did exist) - land, except as mentioned above, remained legally in private ownership and the LPG, although often dominated by communist party cadres, was a distinct legal entity operating independently as far as was feasible within the constraints of a planned economy. However, from the early 1960s, pressure mounted on remaining independent farmers to join the LPGs and for existing LPGs to merge in more fully collectivised forms. This process, and a drive to increased industrialisation, led in the 1970s to the separation of crop and animal production and the merging of each across villages to form much larger cooperative units in which, for example, one LPG for crop production with perhaps of land would supply feed to two LPGs working in animal production.

Following German reunification in 1990, the LPG was no longer a legal form of business and regulations were introduced governing their dissolution and the restructuring of enterprises into other legal forms. Some former LPG members, typically those with a strong family background in independent farming, reclaimed their land and started again as independent farmers building up to a viable farm size through renting. In most cases, however, former members or their children settled for some level of compensation in return for surrendering their membership rights to a smaller core group of former managers who then took over the business in the new form of a limited company (GmbH). This settlement and compensation process was at times fought over and at times accepted with resignation depending often on the amount of wealth to be distributed and on the degree of trust by the general membership and village population in the ability of managers to carry on the enterprise as successful employers. In some cases, an &quot;eingetragene Genossenschaft&quot;, a form of cooperative farming, persisted as allowed under existing German law. While East Elbia (which covered both most of former East Germany and formerly German territories east of the Oder Neisse line which were lost due to World War II) had had more latifundia than western and southern Germany even before the creation of LPGs, one lasting effect of their former existence is that average farm size is larger in each of the New States of Germany than in each of the former Western German states even in the 21st century.

<text>&quot;Many, Many Monkeys&quot; is an episode of the television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, first broadcast in 1989. The episode was written in 1964 for the final season of the original &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; series by producer William Froug, but though CBS bought the script, they chose not to use it. Froug believed that they found it &quot;too grotesque.&quot; It remained shelved for more than twenty years until it was made as an episode in the third and final season of the 1980s &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; revival. The episode is a medical drama centering on an epidemic which causes people to go blind.

==Plot==
Shortly after entering a hospital emergency room, Mrs. Reed goes blind from cataracts. While Nurse Claire Hendricks is visiting her hospital room, Mrs. Reed tells her that they are two of a kind. Uninterested in her cryptic remarks, Claire leaves. Mr. Reed is brought to the hospital, having been abandoned by Mrs. Reed after he started going blind.

The spontaneous cataract development proves to be an epidemic. Claire, despite her incredible workload, visits with Mrs. Reed again. Mrs. Reed again says they are alike and claims the blindness is divine retribution on a human race that has become indifferent to suffering, like monkeys—see no evil, speak no evil, etc.

A report surfaces that an explosion at a biological research laboratory released several unstable forms of bacteria into the atmosphere just hours before the outbreak. Claire tells Dr. Peterson that she is nonetheless now convinced that Mrs. Reed is right, and she feels that she herself has become unfeeling towards her patients and to her own husband. Dr. Peterson argues that she has only maintained the professional distance necessary to do her job, but she is unconvinced. After talking to him, Claire succumbs to blindness.

A surgery is developed to remove the cataracts. Dr. Peterson asks Mrs. Reed to visit Claire and cheer her. Though she has not yet had the surgery, Mrs. Reed is hopeful and convinced that the discovery of the bacteria proves she was wrong. However, Claire argues that the presence of a scientific explanation for the epidemic does not mean it is not divine retribution, and that if they treat themselves with surgery, the same affliction will strike them down in another form. Concerned, Mrs. Reed asks Dr. Peterson if Claire will have the surgery. He says &quot;An operation isn&#x27;t the answer in her case.&quot;, as Claire&#x27;s eyes are clear and her blindness is psychosomatic.

<text>Academic Games is a competition in the U.S. in which players win by out-thinking each other in mathematics, language arts, and social studies. Formal tournaments are organized by local leagues, and on a national level by the Academic Games Leagues of America (AGLOA). Member leagues in eight states hold a national tournament every year, in which players in four divisions compete in eight different games covering math, English, and history. Some turn-based games require a kit consisting of a board and playing cubes, while other games have a central reader announcing questions or clues and each player answering individually.

==History==

Before the existence of AGLOA, tournaments were held by the National Academic Games Project founded by the creator of many of the games. The earliest tournaments, in the late 1960s, were held on or near the campus of Nova High School in Davie, Florida. Nova was the beta test site for the game &quot;Propaganda&quot; and others. Many AGLOA leaders were involved with NAGP. The new league was created partially because of personal conflict with Robert W. Allen. Allen later sued the AGLOA for copyright, trademark, and tradename infringement.

Academic Games Leagues of America was founded in 1991 to encourage the use of Academic Games as an educational tool and as a scholar competition. Many of the games used in tournaments, however, were created as early as in the 1960s and 1970s. Most of the games played at tournaments are available from Wff &#x27;N Proof Learning Games. Brother Neal Golden of New Orleans is the current board president of AGLOA; Rod Beard of West Bloomfield, MI is the current vice-president. Other board members represent Academic Games leagues in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.

==Divisions==
Academic Games players compete with other players in their own age group. These are the four age divisions in the league.
#Minor - Grades 3-4 (Michigan Only)
#Elementary – Grades 5-6 (Michigan) or 6 and under (States other than Michigan)
#Middle – Grades 7–8
#Junior – Grades 9–10
#Senior – Grades 11–12

However, there is no restriction against playing one of your players in a higher division. Several teams have won national championships in the senior division, even though half their players belonged, agewise, in the junior division.

Games become more challenging as a player progresses through the divisions. There are often two variations of the games: basic and adventurous. Basic games have no variations or special demands players can make on game solutions. Adventurous games have a series of variation possibilities that may apply and increase in difficulty as players age.

==Games Played==
Eight games are played in official AGLOA tournaments. Some local leagues also play other games such as On-Words (a simplified version of LinguiSHTIK).

===Math Games===
Two math games, Equations and On-Sets are played at AGLOA tournaments.

====Equations====
Equations is a mathematics game created in 1965 for 2–3 players. The game uses a playing mat with Forbidden, Permitted, and Required sections and 24 cubes, each labeled with numbers and mathematical operations. At the beginning of each &quot;shake&quot;, one player uses up to six cubes to set a &quot;goal.&quot; All players must use the remaining cubes to devise a solution that equals the goal or win by challenging an impossible board + goal situation.

Gameplay can become more complicated through the use of &quot;variations&quot; called on the game. Applicable variations differ by the player&#x27;s age division. The game progresses with each player moving one cube on their turn, or alternatively challenging that they can create a solution with the cubes in play, that a solution was possible on the last turn and the player before had missed it, or challenging that it is impossible to create a solution with the cubes available. When a player calls a challenge, it is called against the player who most recently completed their move.

In a three player game, the indifferent player may choose who he sides with in the case of a challenge. A player who correctly challenges another player wins the game. The loser of a game gains two points, The winner six, and the sider (if he sided with the winner) gains four or two (if he sided with the loser). Equations games become more intricate with the use of factorials, vulgar fractions, and even logarithms, in the Senior division.

====On-Sets====
On-Sets is a board and cube game that teaches basic logic and set theory. This game also uses a deck of 16 cards that is used to make the &quot;Universe&quot;. Each card contains a different combination of colored dots. The cubes contain numbers, colors and logic operators.

Players learn logic concepts such as union, intersection, empty set, complement and learn to use restrictions such as subset. Variations can also be used in On-Sets games. A player wins by using the cubes in resources to create a logical statement which equals the goal set using the numeral cubes. Challenges and multiplayer games work in a similar way to Equations game.

====WFF &#x27;N Proof====

WFF &#x27;N Proof is a board and cube game that was created by Professor Layman Allen in 1961 to teach the basics of symbolic logic.
It is played with 28 cubes that contain various letters, such as p, q, C, N, A, K, E, s, r, o, and i. The game board contains a forbidden section, a permitted section, and a required section. To win the game, you have to write a proof, using the cubes to create &quot;WFFs&quot; (Well-Formed Formulas). This game was now adopted by AGLOA in 2013, however the game was dropped from the tournament after 2018.

===Language Games===

====LinguiSHTIK====
LinguiSHTIK is a technical game that teaches language arts and linguistics. The game has a playing mat and 23 cubes which are imprinted with the 26 letters of the alphabet.

A player has to create a word using the letters available, and the word must be used in a sentence that matches the Demands called. A demand specifies something about the sentence or word, such as number of clauses, part of speech, number of letters, etc. Challenges in LinguiSHTIK work similarly as in the other cube games with the exception of a forceout, which is called when moving any cube would result in a Challenge Win. Some concepts taught in LinguiSHTIK include sentence patterns, clauses, grammar, and verbs.

The game has elements similar to the popular word game Scrabble but adds a different element of play through grammatical demands and the shared letter pool.

====Propaganda====

In Propaganda, clues are read to all players by a central reader. Each player must decide, from a list, which persuasion technique that clue used, if any. There are several different sections of Propaganda techniques; the reader also specifies which section the persuasion technique is listed in.

Different leagues have different scoring methods, but the official AGLOA scoring involves a &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;cautious&quot; wager method. If you wager &quot;bold&quot;, then you receive four points for a correct answer or lose two points for an incorrect answer. If you wager &quot;cautious,&quot; then you receive two points for a correct answer; however, you lose nothing for an incorrect answer. A round consists of nine questions, so the highest score possible per round is 36 points, while the lowest is -18 points.

Most Propaganda clues involve statements that are likely to be heard in advertising or politics. There are six different Propaganda sections, but only four specific sections are used in each season. Sections A, B, D, and E are being used for the 2016–2017 season, and B, C, D, and F will be used for the 2017–2018 season. For 2018–2019, the sections will be A, C, D, and E. For 2019–2020, the sections will be A, B, C, and F. For 2020–2021, the sections will be B, C, D, and E. Here are all the Propaganda techniques, listed by section.

=====Propaganda Techniques=====

More complete definitions of the individual techniques can be found on agloa.org.

===Social Studies Games===

====Presidents====
A reader announces three clues about a particular U.S. President. Each player must individually write down which President the clue describes. Players who answer correctly on the earliest clue get more points than players that answer after more clues are given. The first clue is worth 6 points, the second is worth 4 points, and the third is worth 2 points. The 6 point clue is the hardest clue, while the 4 point and 2 point clues get progressively easier.

In the Elementary and Middle divisions, only a portion of presidents are used per season. For those divisions, ranges switch between presidents 1–17, 16-33, and 28–46 every year. In Junior and Senior divisions, however, two ranges of presidents are used every season. During a tournament, players are assisted by a gazetteer which has each president&#x27;s name, birth date, birthplace, and other basic information.

====World Events====
This event was part of the national tournament through 2016, after which its two rounds, Current Events and Theme, were each made an independent game.

This game was originally known as “World Card.”

==== Current Events ====
This event concerns events from the past year, both foreign and domestic. It consists of a Wager Round, in which the players choose how many points they wish to wager, and a Lightning Round, in which the point values for each question are determined before the round.

In the Wager Round, players may wager two, four, or six points after being given a broad category (such as “international politics” or “arts and entertainment”). The player need not have any points to wager; thus, negative scores are possible. After the wager is made, the question is asked and the players answer. A correct answer earns as many points as were wagered, while an incorrect answer loses half that many.

In the Lightning Round, the questions are assigned point values (two, four, or six, with six questions of each value) by a panel of judges before the game starts. The questions are asked rapidly, and a correct answer earns its value; however, unlike the Wager Round, there is no penalty for answering incorrectly.

==== Theme ====
This event is very similar to its sister game, Current Events, which was once also a round of World Events. It is played and scored in the same fashion, with a Wager Round followed by a Lightning Round. The only notable difference is that this game concerns historical facts related to a theme chosen at the national tournament two years prior. Examples of past themes include the 1970s, the history of NASA, the Mesoamerican civilizations (Aztecs, Incas, Mayas), World War I, and the American Civil War.

The theme of the 2017–2018 season was Greek and Roman Mythology, which was chosen by vote at the 2015–2016 tournament. The theme of the 2018–2019 season was “50 Women Who Changed the World,” which included Rosa Parks, Sacagawea, and Jane Addams The theme of the 2019 - 2020 season is &quot;The Supreme Court: Now and Then&quot;.

===Terminology===
A spectator at an Academic Games tournament will hear a lot of jargon being thrown around that he or she may not be familiar with. Here are some of the most common AG-related words and their meanings.

*Challenge Win or Now – A player calls Challenge Win when he can create a solution using the cubes in play, and optionally one more cube from resources. It can also be called C-A-flub or A-flub in classic version.
*Challenge Impossible or Never – Challenge Impossible is called when a player believes it is impossible to create a solution, because of a previous player&#x27;s move. The player it was called against must try to create a solution, and show that there was a correct solution possible. In classic version, it is called a P-flub.
*Demand – A LinguiSHTIK demand can be called by stating the name of the demand and placing a green or black cube in the &quot;Demands&quot; section of the playing mat. The word and sentence in a player&#x27;s solution must meet all demands called in that shake.
*Force Out – In the case that a game is not finished within the time limit, or that no possible moves can be made that would not create a &quot;Now&quot; or &quot;Never&quot; situation, the game goes into a force out. During a force out, players are given two minutes to create a solution. Players with a correct solution earn a 4, and the ones with an incorrect solution receive a 2, or the minimum possible for that round.
*Goal – Equations, On-Sets, and WFF &#x27;N Proof require the first player to use cubes from resources to set a goal. This is what players try to achieve a solution to throughout the shake.
*Resources – Resources are the cubes that are rolled at the beginning of each shake.
*Shake – One match of a cube game is called a shake. A shake can last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour depending on the cubes rolled and the players involved.
*Solution – A player uses the cubes in resources to create a solution that equals the goal. A solution must be written on paper. After a solution is presented, other players check that solution.
*Stall – As a courtesy, players say the word &quot;stall&quot; before flipping the one-minute timer during their opponents turn. Most actions in the games have a time limit, ranging from 15 seconds to three minutes. Surpassing the time limit usually carries a small penalty of one point.
*Universe – At the beginning of an On-Sets shake, one player randomly lays out between six and fourteen unique cards containing colored dots. This collection of cards is called the universe.
*Variation – In Equations and On-Sets, players can call a total of three variations that affect that shake, or six in the Senior division. Variations are intended to make the game more interesting and more challenging for experienced players. Some examples of variations are &quot;wilds&quot; where one cube can represent another cube, &quot;upside down&quot;, where an upside down number is interpreted as the number&#x27;s additive inverse, etc.

<doc id="894170" wikidata="Q3282593" url="?curid=894170" title="All Work &amp; No Play">
<text>All Work &amp; No Play is the demo CD released by the Christian rock band Relient K in 1998. It caught the attention of dcTalk&#x27;s Toby McKeehan, who subsequently signed them to Gotee Records.

Seven of the eleven tracks on this album were eventually remade on either the band&#x27;s first or second full-length albums. &quot;Cojack&quot;, &quot;Register&quot;, &quot;Be Rad&quot;, and &quot;William&quot; were never re-made for another album, unlike all the others, and are only available on this album.

Like most of Relient K&#x27;s early work the songs make several references to pop-culture, including; * &quot;K Car&quot; refers to the Plymouth Reliant K, based on the K Car platform, for which the band is named, &quot;I&#x27;m Lion-O&quot; refers to the main character, Lion-O, of the 1980s cartoon &quot;Thundercats&quot;, &quot;My Good Friend Charles&quot; references the 1980s sitcom &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;, and in the song &quot;K Car&quot; uses the line &quot;And Brandon Ebel just gave us a call&quot; referring to the founder of the record label, Tooth &amp; Nail Records.

The CD had a limited release by CREC records, the album cover was the same with different CD art. Only a limited number of the album were ever produced. CREC Records was given cease and desist order in 2005 to stop distribution of the album, and they complied.

On the cover of the album, there is a square around the K. In an interview, Matt Thiessen and Matt Hoopes talked about the Reliant K Car, and how they named the band. Matt Thiessen said they saw a rectangle around the K on the back of the car, and they said, &quot;That would make a cool logo&quot;. Thiessen also pointed out that they were fifteen when they thought of that.

<doc id="894176" wikidata="Q761954" url="?curid=894176" title="Multiple integrated laser engagement system">
<text>The multiple integrated laser engagement system, or MILES, is used by the U.S. military and other armed forces around the world for training purposes. It uses lasers and blank cartridges to simulate actual battle.

Individual soldiers carry small laser sensors scattered over their bodies, which detect when the soldier has been illuminated by a firearm&#x27;s laser. Each laser transmitter is set to mimic the effective range of the weapon on which it is used. When a person is &quot;hit&quot;, a medic can use the digital readout to determine which first aid method to practice.

Different versions of MILES systems are available to both US and international militaries. The capabilities of the individual systems can vary significantly but in general all modern systems carry information about the shooter, weapon and ammunition in the laser. When this information is received by the target, the target&#x27;s MILES system uses a random number roll and a casualty probability lookup table to determine the outcome. For example, a MILES transmitter emulating an M16 rifle cannot harm an armored personnel carrier (APC), but could still &quot;kill&quot; a commander visible in the hatch of the vehicle.

Vehicles are typically outfitted with a belt of laser sensors or individual wireless detectors. Dismounted soldiers often wear a vest or harness with sensors as well as a &quot;halo&quot; of sensors on their helmets. MILES systems can be coupled with a real-time data link allowing position and event data to be transmitted back to a central site for data collection and display. More sophisticated systems for tanks and APCs exist that use various techniques (including scanning lasers and coupled radio systems) to allow more precise targeting of armored vehicles.

The standard is maintained by the U.S. Army&#x27;s PEO-STRI branch.

==Early versions==

MILES was introduced to the U.S. Army for direct-fire, force-on-force training capability at home stations and combat training centers during operational testing in 1978 and 1979 following the conclusion of the US Army&#x27;s Engineering Development program awarded to Xerox Electro-Optical Systems. The goal of the program was to design and build a tactical training system that simulates the weapons, weapon characteristics and effects of a family of weapon systems including infantry, armor and aircraft, with an initial design of 11 systems including rifles, tank guns, and missiles.

MILES systems used a laser module which was mounted to the barrel of a real weapon, a blank-firing adaptor for the weapon, and an integrated receiver consisting of sensors on the helmet and load-bearing vests of the soldiers. When a blank shot was fired by a weapon, it caused the laser to fire a coded burst in the direction that the weapon was aimed. If that burst was sensed by the receiver of another soldier, the &quot;hit&quot; soldier&#x27;s gear beacon made a beeping noise to let them know they were &quot;dead&quot;. MILES had serious problems—when hit, the receiver did not prevent the further firing of the weapon, and it was tempting and easy for soldiers to &quot;cheat&quot; by turning the receivers off and back on again, resetting the system and therefore &quot;respawning&quot; or &quot;resurrecting&quot; themselves. In addition, no data about the engagement was kept so it was impossible to positively identify who shot whom on the battlefield, a critical piece of information when attempting to develop new tactics. MILES was also very encumbering and soldiers sometimes experienced neck pain when using it.

In 1981, Simulaser Corporation was founded by two entrepreneur engineers and began operations near Los Angeles to develop &quot;Advanced MILES&quot; training systems. Under initial contracts from Sandia National Labs, Simulaser produced standard MILES replacement laser transmitters and man-worn detector systems as well as &quot;Advanced MILES&quot; devices that incorporated player identification and scoring systems. These Advanced MILES systems made use of the CMOS 146800-series embedded controllers that had just become available at that time. The systems interleaved unique player identification codes within the weapon code bits transmitted by the laser, which were then stored by the receiver system of any player that was hit. Those systems utilized a controller gun to initialize each player, thus preventing players from &quot;resurrecting&quot; themselves by re-inserting the yellow weapon key. Each player&#x27;s data was stored in memory until downloaded by the controller unit at the conclusion of the training exercise. Simulaser made use of hybrid microcircuits to reduce the size of certain components and eliminated the electronic module on the back of the helmet to improve player comfort. Simulaser also manufactured laser detector components and systems for vehicle applications sold to Sandia Labs and EG&amp;G Inc., the operations and maintenance contractor at Kirtland AFB for use in training guards and couriers. Simulaser was acquired by Applied Solar Energy Corp. (ASEC, City of Industry, CA), its major supplier of silicon detectors, in 1984. Later, under contract from Fairchild-Weston Systems, Simulaser produced the laser and detector systems for the AGES/ADII (Air-to-Ground Engagement System/Air Defense II) program for the US Army, outfitting a number of helicopters with training systems and producing laser simulators for the HGSS/GVLLD (Hellfire Ground Support System Simulator/Ground-based Vehicle Laser Locator Designator). 

Simulaser also produced the early low rate of production run of MITS (Multiple Independent Target System) and in 1989 won a development contract from the US Army for STOM (Shoot-through Obscuration Miles) that utilized long-wavelength lasers instead of semiconductor lasers in order to penetrate battlefield obscurants. Late in 1989, Simulaser was awarded a $35 million production contract for standard MILES gear, subsequently increased to $44 million, following which Loral Electro-Optical Systems, Inc., acquired the business of Simulaser from ASEC in October 1989, after which Simulaser ceased to exist.

==Later versions==
Versions made after 1986 used a loud tone to signal when a soldier was &quot;killed&quot;. In order to turn off the noise, the soldier had to remove a yellow key from the laser module on his rifle and insert it into the box on his harness. By removing the key from the laser, the weapon could no longer score hits using the MILES system. With some systems the hit soldier is required to lie on his back to stop the noise and signal others that he is &quot;dead&quot;.

MILES 2 was released in 1991–92, and the SAWE (simulated area weapons effects) add-on was first fielded in 1992 using GPS and RF messages so that vehicles and individual soldiers can be killed from a central location due to artillery strikes, or nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons strikes. Implementation in the Summer and Fall of 1992 was at Hohenfels, Germany at the Combat Maneuver Training Center. In 1993, the range at Fort Polk was installed and tested. At the time, there were plans to add SAWE at the NTC at Fort Irwin, although instead this was implemented by using SAWE-like features via the DCI radio network. This was superseded in aircraft by the implementation of the SMODIM or the smart onboard data interface module instrumented in 1998 at all three Combat Training Centers (NTC, JRTC, and JMRC).

As of July 2006, the latest version of MILES was MILES XXI, provided by Lockheed Martin.

As of July 2012, the latest version of soldier worn MILES in the US is MILES IWS2, provided by Cubic Corporation.

As of 2012 the most current version of fully fielded vehicle platform MILES was the Instrumentable multiple integrated laser engagement system combat vehicle tactical engagement simulation system I-MILES CVTESS). This is provided to the US Army by Saab Defense and Security Training and Simulations. It is manufactured at Saab Training in the company&#x27;s office in Husqvarna, Sweden. Saab&#x27;s Main Battle Tank (MBT) Crew Trainer enables the warfighter to perform live precision gunnery and combat training.

I-MILES CVTESS is a laser-based training device to be used on Abrams, Bradley, and opposing forces (OPFOR) tanks and fighting vehicles to provide real-time casualty effects. It is an evolutionary approach for replacing older I-MILES CVTESS equipment currently used in force-on-force training exercises with devices that provide better training fidelity for combat vehicle systems. It reinforces crew duties, rewards proper engagement techniques and develop tactical maneuver skills of armor and mechanized infantry combined arms teams up to brigade level. It provides unit commanders an integrated training system in force-on-force and force-on-target training events at homestation training area through instrumented training. The system interfaces with instrumentation systems at maneuver combat training centers (MCTC).

Private companies

S&amp;S Training Solutions LLC 

In early 2019 S&amp;S Training Solutions LLC, a Combat Infantry Veteran owned &amp; operated tactical training small business, procured MILES 2000 (Cubic Defense Applications) for use in its force-on-force training programs, making them the second known company to make this system available to the American citizen.

One Shepherd, a division of TacComp Media, LLC, procured MILES 2000 (Cubic Defense Applications) in early 2007 as a force on force simulation platform for their vocational leadership education program. One Shepherd employs the system to teach leadership through the military decision-making process (MDMP) inherent in tactical patrolling operations and small arms gun fighting. MILES provides immediate feedback to students in a safe-to-fail environment, and affords an experiential exploration of leadership.

* In late 2013 One Shepherd purchased MILES IWS (Universal Systems and Technology Inc.) and now employ both variants in their educational program.
* Numerous private training companies have purchased MILES through Homeland Security grant. The terms of the grant significantly restrict the use of MILES by civilian citizens. Nuclear security police contracted under the US Department of Energy represent the largest non-defense market for MILES.

<text>The Asphalt Jungle is a 1950 American heist film noir directed and cowritten by John Huston and starring Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Jean Hagen, James Whitmore, Sam Jaffe, John McIntire and Marilyn Monroe in one of her earliest roles. Based on the 1949 novel by W. R. Burnett, it tells the story of a jewel robbery in a Midwestern city.

Produced and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the film was released on May 12, 1950. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, and Huston won a National Board of Review Award for his direction. At the 1950 Venice Film Festival, Huston was nominated for the Golden Lion and Sam Jaffe won the Best Actor Award.

Retrospective reviews of the film have been highly positive, with several critics describing it as one of the most influential works in the crime film genre, and one of Huston&#x27;s best films. The film spawned a television series of the same name that aired on ABC in 1961.

In 2008, &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
When criminal mastermind Erwin &quot;Doc&quot; Riedenschneider is released from prison, he visits a bookie named Cobby in an unnamed Midwestern river city. Doc needs $50,000 to hire three men—a safecracker, a driver and a hooligan—to commit a huge jewel robbery. Cobby arranges a meeting between Doc and Alonzo Emmerich, a high-society lawyer and known fixer. Doc tells Emmerich that the theft will yield half a million dollars or more. Emmerich agrees to front the money and find a fence. After they leave, Emmerich finds his young girlfriend Angela asleep on the couch. Private detective Bob Brannom visits Emmerich to collect some debts, but Emmerich is broke and convinces Brennom to help him double-cross the others, proposing a scheme for him to abscond with the gems.

Doc secures Louie Ciavelli as the safecracker. Ciavelli only trusts Gus Minissi, a hunchbacked diner owner, to be the getaway driver. Last hired is Dix Handley, who tells Doll Conovan, who is in love with him, of his dream to buy the horse farm that his family had lost after a terrible year. To access the jewelry store, Ciavelli hammers through a brick wall, deactivates an alarm to admit Doc and Dix, and uses nitroglycerine to open the safe. However, the explosion triggers several burglar alarms, and Dix slugs a security guard. The guard drops his revolver, which fires, striking Ciavelli in the abdomen. The men escape and a police manhunt begins.

Ciavelli insists that Gus take him home. Ciavelli&#x27;s wife wants him taken to the hospital, but Gus sends for a trusted but illicit doctor. Doc and Dix arrive at Emmerich&#x27;s place, but are aware of Emmerich&#x27;s attempt to stall them. Realizing this, Brannom draws a gun but is killed by Dix, who receives a flesh wound in his side. Doc scolds Emmerich for his foolish plan and tells him to offer the money to the jeweler&#x27;s insurance company for 25% of its value to avoid suspicion.

Emmerich dumps Brannom&#x27;s body in the river. The police find the list of debtors on Emmerich&#x27;s letterhead on the corpse. When they question him, Emmerich claims that he spent the night with his mistress, Angela Phinlay. Under pressure from police commissioner Hardy, police lieutenant Ditrich, a corrupt cop on Cobby&#x27;s payroll, beats the bookie into confessing everything in a vain attempt to save himself from becoming ensnared. Hardy arrests Emmerich at Angela&#x27;s home and threatens her with jail for providing Emmerich with an alibi. When the police allow Emmerich to leave the room to phone his wife, he shoots himself dead.

After Gus is arrested, he attacks Cobby in the jail. The police go to Ciavelli’s to arrest him, but when they forcibly enter, they find his funeral in progress. In Doll&#x27;s apartment, Doc offers Dix some of the stones, but he refuses. Doll secures a car for Dix and insists on accompanying him. Doc persuades a taxi driver to drive him to Cleveland, hours away. They stop at a roadside diner, where Doc becomes entranced by a pretty young woman dancing to the jukebox. Because of the delay, Doc is recognized by two policemen, who arrest him after finding the stolen jewels hidden in his overcoat. Suffering from blood loss, Dix faints at the wheel. He is taken to a doctor, who phones the local police to report a gunshot wound. Dix regains consciousness and escapes.

At a press conference, Hardy notes that three of the seven suspects have died, three others have been arrested and the one on the loose is a hardened killer. Back at the wheel, the rolling green fields of Bluegrass country pass as Dix speaks deliriously. Arriving at his childhood pasture, he collapses. Doll runs for help, while horses gather around him.

==Production==
The film was an adaptation by director John Huston and screenwriter Ben Maddow of the 1949 novel by crime writer W. R. Burnett. It was backed by the major film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where it was greenlighted by production chief Dore Schary over the objections of studio head Louis B. Mayer. From the publication of Burnett&#x27;s first novel &quot;Little Caesar&quot; in 1929, he had written numerous books that were adapted into films shortly after publication. Huston and Ben Maddow wrote the adaptation, which emphasized the crooks&#x27; story and reduced the police procedural aspect. Burnett was consulted as the shooting script was being written, and he approved the final version. The studio allowed the production a relatively free hand.

Maddow said: &quot;[A] lot of the power [of the film] was due to the fact that these were New York actors who all knew one another and were trying to outdo one another—and who were stimulants to one another. There was nobody who had a name of any consequence... Most of Huston&#x27;s talent came in the choice of casting, which most directors will tell you anyway, in moments of frankness. It could have been quite a banal film if badly cast. Imagine Van Johnson or somebody else in the leading part! But it was not an important film, so it was easier to cast.&quot;

Production for &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; took place from October 21, 1949 to late December of that year. Location shooting took place in Lexington and Keeneland, Kentucky and in Cincinnati, Ohio.

In shooting the film, Huston was influenced by European neorealist films such as &quot;Open City&quot; (1945) and &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (1948). He combined the naturalism of neorealism with the stylized look of film noir and Hollywood crime films. When the film was complete, Mayer said: &quot;It&#x27;s trash. That Asphalt Pavement thing is full of nasty, ugly people doing nasty things. I wouldn&#x27;t cross the street to see a picture like that.&quot;

The Production Code Administration&#x27;s main concerns with the script were the detailed depiction of the heist and the fact that the character of the corrupt lawyer Emmerich seemed to cheat justice by killing himself. Neither the studio nor the censors interfered significantly with the script, however, and both the heist and the suicide were included in the final cut, although the suicide scene was rewritten. The original scene had Emmerich finishing a suicide note, but in the revised scene, he stalls after writing an endearing salutation to his wife, crumples the note and become extremely agitated about the decision to kill himself before an abrupt cutaway to an offscreen shot being heard.

Huston&#x27;s first choice for the breakout role played by Marilyn Monroe was Lola Albright, who was unavailable. Huston invited Monroe to a screen test and rehearsed for it with her in his office. He did not feel that she was right for the part and dismissed her, but changed his mind when he watched her leave the room. According to film noir authority Eddie Muller, Huston later said that Monroe was &quot;one of the few actresses who could make an entrance by leaving the room.&quot;

==Reception==

===Box office===
According to MGM records, the film earned $1,077,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1,060,000 overseas, resulting in a profit of only $40,000.

===Critical response===
A contemporary review in &quot;Photoplay&quot; stated:
At the time of its release &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of the film:
In 1988 the Criterion Collection critic Peter Heath Becker admired Huston&#x27;s technique:

On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; is an expertly told crime story with attention paid to the crime and characters in equal measure.&quot;

=== Awards and nominations ===
== Television series ==
The film spawned a television series of the same name starring Jack Warden, Arch Johnson and William Smith, which ran for 13 episodes in the spring and summer of 1961 on ABC. The series resembled the film in name only, except for one episode, &quot;The Professor&quot;, which was constructed as a sequel to the feature film. None of the characters in the film appeared in the television scripts, and the plots were devoted to the exploits of the major case squad of the New York Police Department. One of the most notable features of the series is the theme song, written by Duke Ellington.

==Legacy==
Over time &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; has become to be regarded as one of the more influential crime films of the 1950s. According to the AFI Film Catalog, &quot;is widely regarded by film critics as one of John Huston&#x27;s best.&quot;

Burnett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; was the basis of M-G-M&#x27;s western film &quot;The Badlanders&quot; (1958) directed by Delmer Daves, as well as &quot;Cairo&quot; (1963) starring George Sanders, followed by the blaxploitation film &quot;Cool Breeze&quot; (1972), directed by Barry Pollack.

&quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; further developed the crime thriller subgenre of caper films. The 1955 French film &quot;Rififi&quot;, which critics such as Leonard Maltin have labeled as the best heist film ever, drew much inspiration from &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;.

In 2008, &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Colorization dispute==
The film was the subject of a colorization lawsuit and controversy in France. Turner Entertainment entered into an agreement with the French television channel La Cinq, to broadcast the film in artificially colorized form. John Huston&#x27;s heirs objected and filed a lawsuit. On November 23, 1988, &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; was prohibited from being broadcast in France. On July 6, 1989, La Cinq won on appeal, broadcasting the film on August 6, 1989. Finally in &quot;Turner Entertainment Co. v. Huston,&quot; on May 28, 1991, the Court of Cassation canceled the July 6 judgment, stating that colorizing the film transformed the original artwork enough to potentially transgress the author&#x27;s moral rights.

<doc id="894181" wikidata="Q371892" url="?curid=894181" title="Relient K (album)">
<text>Relient K is the debut studio album by American rock band Relient K. Many of the tracks are newer versions of those found on their 1998 demo &quot;All Work &amp; No Play&quot;. Typical of early Relient K albums, the lyrics use pop culture references for teaching and to illustrate Biblical principles. As of late 2006/early 2007, this album has sold around 400,000 copies.

==Track listing==

== Personnel ==

Relient K
* Matt Thiessen – lead vocals, guitars
* Matt Hoopes – guitars, backing vocals
* Brian Pittman – bass guitar
* Stephen Cushman – drums, backing vocals

Production
* Todd Collins – executive producer 
* Joey Elwood – executive producer 
* Toby McKeehan – executive producer 
* Mark Lee Townsend – producer, recording 
* Russ Long – mixing at The Carport (Nashville, Tennessee)
* Erik Wolf – mastering at Wolf Mastering (Nashville, Tennessee)
* Mike McGlaflin – A&amp;R 
* Kerri McKeehan-Stuart – photography 
* Brad Talbott – design, layout 
* Timothy Eddings – management

==Notes and miscellanea==
*At the end of &quot;Hello McFly&quot;, Toby McKeehan (tobyMac) calls Matt Thiessen, telling him that a song about Marilyn Manson will never be on a CD put out by Gotee Records (the call is followed by &quot;My Girlfriend&quot;, a song about Marilyn Manson). McKeehan is the president of Gotee Records, and the one who signed Relient K to a record deal after hearing their demo.
* The hidden track after &quot;K Car&quot; is entitled &quot;Punk Rock Picnic&quot; - Relient K&#x27;s &quot;Call Us Rock Stars&quot; with various quotes dubbed over and then music from a polka concert at the end.
* The song &quot;anchorage&quot; is the only Relient K song to begin with a lowercase letter, and is the first Relient K song that has absolutely no vocals.
* Pre-release copies of the album feature a short track called &quot;Ed Sullivan&quot; which was excluded from the release version, likely due to licensing issues, as it is in fact a brief parody of the same song from the film &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;.
* In the song &quot;K Car&quot;, the line, &quot;and Brandon Ebel just gave us a call&quot;, references the founder of the Christian record label Tooth &amp; Nail Records.
* Drummer Stephen Cushman provides the screaming vocals on &quot;Softer to Me&quot;, as well as some lead vocals on &quot;Wake Up Call&quot;.

== Pop culture and Biblical references ==
*&quot;Hello McFly&quot; refers to the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy, in which the main character was named Marty McFly. The song is about the inability to change one&#x27;s past.
*&quot;Charles in Charge&quot; was a cover of the theme from the TV series of the same name.
*&quot;17 Magazine&quot; refers to the magazine of the same name.
*&quot;Nancy Drew&quot; refers to the series of children&#x27;s mysteries with the main character of the same name. This song also mentions The Hardy Boys, the brother series to Nancy Drew.
*&quot;K Car&quot; refers to Plymouth&#x27;s Reliant K, based on the K Car platform, for which the band is named.
*At the end of the polka music that makes up the second half of the hidden track, the man playing that just finished playing the polka music asks the audience if they&#x27;ve heard his song on the radio about the Cleveland Browns. It also features a recording of a Reliant K starting up in the intro.
*&quot;My Girlfriend&quot; draws parallels to 1 Peter , where the Devil is portrayed as a Lion waiting to devour lives. It also references rocker Marilyn Manson and his song &quot;The Beautiful People&quot;.

<doc id="894182" wikidata="Q15587387" url="?curid=894182" title="The Snows of Kilimanjaro (short story)">
<text>&quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; is a short story by American author Ernest Hemingway first published in August 1936, in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. It was republished in &quot;The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories&quot; in 1938, &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories&quot; in 1961, and is included in &quot;The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vigía Edition&quot; (1987).

==Plot==
The story opens with a paragraph about Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, whose western summit is called in Masai the &quot;House of God.&quot; There, we are told, lies the frozen carcass of a leopard near the summit. No one knows why it is there at such altitude.

The reader is introduced to Harry, a writer dying of gangrene, and Helen, who is with him on safari in Africa. They are stranded in the camp, because a bearing in their truck&#x27;s engine burnt out. Harry&#x27;s situation makes him irritable, and he speaks about his impending death in a matter-of-fact, sarcastic way that upsets Helen. He quarrels with her over minute things, from whether he should drink a whiskey and soda, to whether she should read to him. Helen is obviously concerned for his welfare, but Harry&#x27;s frustration makes him treat her poorly.

Harry then begins to ruminate on his life experiences, which have been many and varied, and on the fact that he feels he has never reached his potential as a writer because he has chosen to make his living by marrying wealthy women. In italicized portions of the text that are scattered throughout the story, Hemingway narrates some of Harry&#x27;s experiences in a stream-of-consciousness style. Harry&#x27;s first memories consist of traveling around Europe following a battle: hiding a deserter in a cottage, hunting and skiing in the mountains, playing cards during a blizzard, and hearing about a bombing run on a train full of Austrian officers.

Harry then falls asleep and wakes in the evening to find Helen returning from a shooting expedition. He meditates on how she really is thoughtful and good to him, and how she is not to blame that his talent as a writer has been destroyed. Helen, he remembers, is a rich widow who lost her husband and a child, was bored by a series of lovers, and eventually &quot;acquired&quot; Harry because &quot;she wanted some one that she respected with her&quot;; she loves Harry &quot;dearly as a writer, as a man, as a companion and as a proud possession&quot;, while Harry makes it clear that he does not love her. Harry then recalls how he developed gangrene two weeks earlier: they had been trying to get a picture of some waterbuck, and Harry scratched his right knee on a thorn. He had not applied iodine right away, and the wound got infected; because all other antiseptics ran out, he used a weak carbolic solution that &quot;paralyzed the minute blood vessels&quot;, thus the leg developed gangrene.

As Helen returns to drink cocktails with Harry, they make up over their quarrel. Harry&#x27;s second memory sequence then begins. He recalls how he once patronized prostitutes in Constantinople &quot;to kill his loneliness&quot;, pining for the very first woman he fell in love with, with whom he quarreled in Paris and broke up. Harry had a fight with a British soldier over an Armenian prostitute, and then left Constantinople for Anatolia, where, after running from a group of Turkish soldiers, &quot;he had seen the things that he could never think of and later still he had seen much worse&quot;. Then Harry recalls that upon his return to Paris, his then-wife inquired about a letter that was actually from Harry&#x27;s first love—a reply to the letter he wrote to that woman (mailed to New York, asking to write to his office in Paris) while being in Constantinople.

Helen and Harry eat dinner, and then Harry has another memory—this time of how his grandfather&#x27;s log house burned down. He then relates how he fished in the Black Forest, and how he lived in a poor quarter of Paris and felt a kinship with his poor neighbors. Next, he remembers a ranch and a boy he turned in to the sheriff after the boy protected Harry&#x27;s horse feed by shooting and killing a thief. Harry ponders: &quot;That was one story he had saved to write. He knew at least twenty good stories from out there and he had never written one. Why?&quot;. Then he felt once again that he&#x27;d prefer to be in different company rather than with Helen, as the &quot;rich were dull&quot;. Next, his thoughts wander to beating the fear of death, and the limits of being able to bear pain. He remembers an officer named Williamson who was hit by a bomb, and to whom Harry subsequently fed all his morphine tablets. Harry considers how he does not have to worry about pain in his current condition.

As Harry lies on his cot remembering, he feels the overwhelming presence of death and associates it with the hyena that has been spotted running around the edge of the campsite. He is unable to speak. Helen, thinking that Harry has fallen asleep, has him moved into the tent for the night. Harry dreams that it is morning, and that a man called Compton has come with a plane to rescue him. He is lifted onto the plane (which has space only for him and the pilot) and watches the landscape go by beneath him. Suddenly, he sees the snow-covered top of Mt. Kilimanjaro, and knows that is where he is bound. Helen wakes up in the middle of the night to a strange hyena cry, and finds Harry unresponsive on his cot. It is not specified whether or not Harry is already dead.

==Adaptation==
A film adaptation of the short story, directed by Henry King, written by Casey Robinson, and starring Gregory Peck as Harry, Susan Hayward as Helen, and Ava Gardner as Cynthia Green (a character invented for the film) appeared in 1952. The film&#x27;s ending does not mirror the story&#x27;s ending.

<doc id="894198" wikidata="Q1370962" url="?curid=894198" title="Curtain wall (architecture)">
<text>A curtain wall is an exterior covering of a building in which the outer walls are non-structural, instead serving to protect the interior of the building from the elements. Because the curtain wall façade carries no structural load beyond its own dead load weight, it can be made of lightweight materials. The wall transfers lateral wind loads upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building.

Curtain walls may be designed as &quot;systems&quot; integrating frame, wall panel, and weatherproofing materials. Steel frames have largely given way to aluminum extrusions. Glass is typically used for infill because it can reduce construction costs, provide an architecturally pleasing look, and allow natural light to penetrate deeper within the building. However, glass also makes the effects of light on visual comfort and solar heat gain in a building more difficult to control. Other common infills include stone veneer, metal panels, louvres, and operable windows or vents.

Unlike storefront systems, curtain wall systems are designed to span multiple floors, taking into consideration building sway and movement and design requirements such as thermal expansion and contraction; seismic requirements; water diversion; and thermal efficiency for cost-effective heating, cooling, and interior lighting.

==History==


Historically, buildings were constructed of timber, masonry, or a combination of both. Their exterior walls were load-bearing, supporting much or all of the load of the entire structure. The nature of the materials resulted in inherent limits to a building&#x27;s height and the maximum size of window openings.

The development and widespread use of structural steel and later reinforced concrete allowed relatively small columns to support large loads. The exterior walls could be non-load bearing, and thus much lighter and more open than load-bearing walls of the past. This gave way to increased use of glass as an exterior façade, and the modern-day curtain wall was born.

Post-and-beam and balloon framed timber structures effectively had an early version of curtain walls, for their frames supported loads that allowed the walls themselves to serve other functions, such as keeping weather out and allowing light in. When iron began to be used extensively in buildings in late 18th-century Britain, such as at Ditherington Flax Mill, and later when buildings of wrought iron and glass such as The Crystal Palace were built, the building blocks of structural understanding were laid for the development of curtain walls. 

Oriel Chambers (1864) and 16 Cook Street (1866), both built in Liverpool, England, by local architect and civil engineer Peter Ellis, are characterised by their extensive use of glass in their facades. Toward the courtyards they boasted metal-framed glass curtain walls, which makes them two of the world&#x27;s first buildings to include this architectural feature. Oriel Chambers is listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the earliest such building. The extensive glass walls allowed light to penetrate further into the building, utilizing more floor space and reducing lighting costs. Oriel Chambers comprises set over five floors without an elevator, which had only recently been invented and was not yet widespread. The Statue of Liberty (1886) features a thin, non-load-bearing copper skin. Extensive use of glass became required for large factory buildings to allow light for manufacture, sometimes making it seem like they had all glass facades. 

An early example of an all-steel curtain wall used in the classical style is the department store on Leipziger Straße, Berlin, built in 1901 (since demolished).

Some of the first curtain walls were made with steel mullions, and the polished plate glass was attached to the mullions with asbestos- or fiberglass-modified glazing compound. Eventually silicone sealants or glazing tape were substituted for the glazing compound. Some designs included an outer cap to hold the glass in place and to protect the integrity of the seals. The landmarks of curtain wall design as it came to dominate construction were the very different systems used by the United Nations Headquarters and the Lever House completed in 1952.

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s curtain wall is one of the most important aspects of his architectural design. Mies first began prototyping the curtain wall in his high-rise residential building designs along Chicago&#x27;s lakeshore, achieving the look of a curtain wall at 860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments. He finally perfected the curtain wall at 900–910 Lake Shore Drive, where the curtain is an autonomous aluminum and glass skin. After 900–910, Mies&#x27;s curtain wall appeared on all of his subsequent high-rise building designs, including the Seagram Building in New York.

The widespread use of aluminium extrusions for mullions began during the 1970s. Aluminum alloys offer the unique advantage of being able to be easily extruded into nearly any shape required for design and aesthetic purposes. Today, the design complexity and shapes available are nearly limitless. Custom shapes can be designed and manufactured with relative ease. The Omni San Diego Hotel curtain wall in California, designed by architectural firm Hornberger and Worstel and developed by JMI Realty, is an example of a unitized curtain-wall system with integrated sunshades.

==Systems and principles==
===Stick systems===
The vast majority of ground-floor curtain walls are installed as long pieces (referred to as &quot;sticks&quot;) between floors vertically and between vertical members horizontally. Framing members may be fabricated in a shop, but installation and glazing is typically performed at the jobsite.

===Ladder systems===
Very similar to a stick system, a ladder system has mullions which can be split and then either snapped or screwed together consisting of a half box and plate. This allows sections of curtain wall to be fabricated in a shop, effectively reducing the time spent installing the system onsite. The drawbacks of using such a system is reduced structural performance and visible joint lines down the length of each mullion.

===Unitized systems===
Unitized curtain walls entail factory fabrication and assembly of panels and may include factory glazing. These completed units are installed on the building structure to form the building enclosure. Unitized curtain wall has the advantages of: speed; lower field installation costs; and quality control within an interior climate-controlled environment. The economic benefits are typically realized on large projects or in areas of high field labor rates.

===Rainscreen principle===
A common feature in curtain wall technology, the rainscreen principle theorizes that equilibrium of air pressure between the outside and inside of the &quot;rainscreen&quot; prevents water penetration into the building. For example, the glass is captured between an inner and an outer gasket in a space called the glazing rebate. The glazing rebate is ventilated to the exterior so that the pressure on the inner and outer sides of the outer gasket is the same. When the pressure is equal across this gasket, water cannot be drawn through joints or defects in the gasket.

==Design concerns==
A curtain wall system must be designed to handle all loads imposed on it as well as keep air and water from penetrating the building envelope.

===Loads===

The loads imposed on the curtain wall are transferred to the building structure through the anchors which attach the mullions to the building.

;Dead load
&quot;Dead load&quot; is defined as the weight of structural elements and the permanent features on the structure. In the case of curtain walls, this load is made up of the weight of the mullions, anchors and other structural components of the curtain wall, as well as the weight of the infill material. Additional dead loads imposed on the curtain wall may include sunshades or signage attached to the curtain wall.

;Wind load
&quot;Wind load&quot; is a normal force acting on the building as the result of wind blowing on the building. Wind pressure is resisted by the curtain wall system since it envelops and protects the building. Wind loads vary greatly throughout the world, with the largest wind loads being near the coast in hurricane-prone regions. For each project location, building codes specify the required design wind loads. Often, a wind tunnel study is performed on large or unusually-shaped buildings. A scale model of the building and the surrounding vicinity is built and placed in a wind tunnel to determine the wind pressures acting on the structure in question. These studies take into account vortex shedding around corners and the effects of surrounding topography and buildings.

;Seismic load
&quot;Seismic loads&quot; in a curtain wall system are limited to the interstory drift induced on the building during an earthquake. In most situations, the curtain wall is able to naturally withstand seismic and wind induced building sway because of the space provided between the glazing infill and the mullion. In tests, standard curtain wall systems are typically able to withstand up to of relative floor movement without glass breakage or water leakage.

;Snow load
&quot;Snow loads&quot; and live loads are not typically an issue in curtain walls, since curtain walls are designed to be vertical or slightly inclined. If the slope of a wall exceeds 20 degrees or so, these loads may need to be considered.

;Thermal load
&quot;Thermal loads&quot; are induced in a curtain wall system because aluminum has a relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion. This means that over the span of a couple of floors, the curtain wall will expand and contract some distance, relative to its length and the temperature differential. This expansion and contraction is accounted for by cutting horizontal mullions slightly short and allowing a space between the horizontal and vertical mullions. In unitized curtain wall, a gap is left between units, which is sealed from air and water penetration by gaskets. Vertically, anchors carrying wind load only (not dead load) are slotted to account for movement. Incidentally, this slot also accounts for live load deflection and creep in the floor slabs of the building structure.

;Blast load
Accidental explosions and terrorist threats have brought on increased concern for the fragility of a curtain wall system in relation to blast loads. The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has spawned much of the current research and mandates in regards to building response to blast loads. Currently, all new federal buildings in the U.S. and all U.S. embassies built on foreign soil must have some provision for resistance to bomb blasts.

Since the curtain wall is at the exterior of the building, it becomes the first line of defense in a bomb attack. As such, blast resistant curtain walls are designed to withstand such forces without compromising the interior of the building to protect its occupants. Since blast loads are very high loads with short durations, the curtain wall response should be analyzed in a dynamic load analysis, with full-scale mock-up testing performed prior to design completion and installation.

Blast resistant glazing consists of laminated glass, which is meant to break but not separate from the mullions. Similar technology is used in hurricane-prone areas for impact protection from wind-borne debris.

===Air infiltration===
&quot;Air infiltration&quot; is the air which passes through the curtain wall from the exterior to the interior of the building. The air is infiltrated through the gaskets, through imperfect joinery between the horizontal and vertical mullions, through weep holes, and through imperfect sealing. The American Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA) is an industry trade group in the U.S. that has developed voluntary specifications regarding acceptable levels of air infiltration through a curtain wall.

===Water penetration===
&quot;Water penetration&quot; is defined as water passing from the exterior of the building to the interior of the curtain wall system. Sometimes, depending on the building specifications, a small amount of controlled water on the interior is deemed acceptable. Controlled water penetration is defined as water that penetrates beyond the inner most vertical plane of the test specimen, but has a designed means of drainage back to the exterior. AAMA Voluntary Specifications allow for controlled water penetration while the underlying ASTM E1105 test method would define such water penetration as a failure. To test the ability of a curtain wall to withstand water penetration in the field, an ASTM E1105 water spray rack system is placed on the exterior side of the test specimen, and a positive air pressure difference is applied to the system. This set up simulates a wind driven rain event on the curtain wall to check for field performance of the product and of the installation. Field quality control and assurance checks for water penetration has become the norm as builders and installers apply such quality programs to help reduce the number of water damage litigation suits against their work.

===Deflection===
One of the disadvantages of using aluminum for mullions is that its modulus of elasticity is about one-third that of steel. This translates to three times more deflection in an aluminum mullion compared to a similar steel section under a given load. Building specifications set deflection limits for perpendicular (wind-induced) and in-plane (dead load-induced) deflections. These deflection limits are not imposed due to strength capacities of the mullions. Rather, they are designed to limit deflection of the glass (which may break under excessive deflection), and to ensure that the glass does not come out of its pocket in the mullion. Deflection limits are also necessary to control movement at the interior of the curtain wall. Building construction may be such that there is a wall located near the mullion, and excessive deflection can cause the mullion to contact the wall and cause damage. Also, if deflection of a wall is quite noticeable, public perception may raise undue concern that the wall is not strong enough.

Deflection limits are typically expressed as the distance between anchor points divided by a constant number. A deflection limit of L/175 is common in curtain wall specifications, based on experience with deflection limits that are unlikely to cause damage to the glass held by the mullion. Say that a given curtain wall is anchored at 12-foot (144 in) floor heights. The allowable deflection would then be 144/175 = 0.823 inches, which means the wall is allowed to deflect inward or outward a maximum of 0.823 inches at the maximum wind pressure. However, some panels require stricter movement restrictions, or certainly those that prohibit a torque-like motion.

Deflection in mullions is controlled by different shapes and depths of curtain wall members. The depth of a given curtain wall system is usually controlled by the area moment of inertia required to keep deflection limits under the specification. Another way to limit deflections in a given section is to add steel reinforcement to the inside tube of the mullion. Since steel deflects at one-third the rate of aluminum, the steel will resist much of the load at a lower cost or smaller depth.

Deflection in curtain wall mullions also differs from deflection of the building structure, whether concrete, steel, or timber. Curtain wall anchors must be designed to allow differential movement between the building structure and the curtain wall.

===Strength===
Strength (or maximum usable stress) available to a particular material is not related to its material stiffness (the material property governing deflection); it is a separate criterion in curtain wall design and analysis. This often affects the selection of materials and sizes for design of the system. The allowable bending strength for certain aluminum alloys, such as those typically used in curtain wall framing, approaches the allowable bending strength of steel alloys used in building construction.

===Thermal criteria===

Relative to other building components, aluminum has a high heat transfer coefficient, meaning that aluminum is a very good conductor of heat. This translates into high heat loss through aluminum (or steel) curtain wall mullions. There are several ways to compensate for this heat loss, the most common way being the addition of thermal breaks. These are barriers between exterior metal and interior metal, usually made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). These breaks provide a significant decrease in the thermal conductivity of the curtain wall. However, since the thermal break interrupts the aluminum mullion, the overall moment of inertia of the mullion is reduced and must be accounted for in the structural analysis and deflection analysis of the system.

Thermal conductivity of the curtain wall system is important because of heat loss through the wall, which affects the heating and cooling costs of the building. On a poorly performing curtain wall, condensation may form on the interior of the mullions. This could cause damage to adjacent interior trim and walls.

Rigid insulation is provided in spandrel areas to provide a higher R-value at these locations.

Thermally-broken mullions with double- or triple-glazed IGUs are often referred to as &quot;high-performance&quot; curtain walls. While these curtain wall systems are more energy-efficient than older, single-glazed versions, they are still significantly less efficient than opaque (solid) wall construction. For example, nearly all curtain wall systems, thermally-broken or otherwise, have a U-value of 0.2 or higher, which is equivalent to an R-value of 5 or lower.

==Infills==

&quot;Infill&quot; refers to the large panels that are inserted into the curtain wall between mullions. Infills are typically glass but may be made up of nearly any exterior building element. Some common infills include metal panels, louvers, and photovoltaic panels. Infills are also referred to as spandrels or spandrel panels.

===Glass===

Float glass is by far the most common curtain wall glazing type. It can be manufactured in an almost infinite combination of color, thickness, and opacity. For commercial construction, the two most common thicknesses are monolithic and insulating glass. 1/4 inch glass is typically used only in spandrel areas, while insulating glass is used for the rest of the building (sometimes spandrel glass is specified as insulating glass as well). The 1 inch insulation glass is typically made up of two 1/4-inch lites of glass with a airspace. The air inside is usually atmospheric air, but some inert gases, such as argon or krypton, may be used in order to offer better thermal transmittance values. In Europe, triple-pane insulating glass infill is now common. In Scandinavia, the first curtain walls with quadruple-pane have been built.

Larger thicknesses are typically employed for buildings or areas with higher thermal, relative humidity, or sound transmission requirements, such as laboratory areas or recording studios. In residential construction, thicknesses commonly used are monolithic and insulating glass.

Glass may be used which is transparent, translucent, or opaque, or in varying degrees thereof. &quot;Transparent&quot; glass usually refers to &quot;vision&quot; glass in a curtain wall. Spandrel or vision glass may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes. &quot;Opaque&quot; glass is used in areas to hide a column or spandrel beam or shear wall behind the curtain wall. Another method of hiding spandrel areas is through &quot;shadow box&quot; construction (providing a dark enclosed space behind the transparent or translucent glass). Shadow box construction creates a perception of depth behind the glass that is sometimes desired.

===Stone veneer===
Thin blocks () of stone can be inset within a curtain wall system. The type of stone used is limited only by the strength of the stone and the ability to manufacture it in the proper shape and size. Common stone types used are: calcium silicate, granite, marble, travertine, limestone, and engineered stone. To reduce weight and improve strength, the natural stone may be attached to an aluminum honeycomb backing.

===Panels===
Metal panels can take various forms including stainless steel, aluminum plate; aluminum composite panels consisting of two thin aluminum sheets sandwiching a thin plastic interlayer; copper wall cladding, and panels consisting of metal sheets bonded to rigid insulation, with or without an inner metal sheet to create a sandwich panel. Other opaque panel materials include fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) and terracotta. Terracotta curtain wall panels were first used in Europe, but only a few manufacturers produce high quality modern terracotta curtain wall panels.

===Louvers===
A louver is provided in an area where mechanical equipment located inside the building requires ventilation or fresh air to operate. They can also serve as a means of allowing outside air to filter into the building to take advantage of favorable climatic conditions and minimize the usage of energy-consuming HVAC systems. Curtain wall systems can be adapted to accept most types of louver systems to maintain the same architectural sightlines and style while providing desired functionality.

===Windows and vents===
Most curtain wall glazing is fixed, meaning that there is no access to the exterior of the building except through doors. However, windows or vents can be glazed into the curtain wall system as well, to provide required ventilation or operable windows. Nearly any window type can be made to fit into a curtain wall system.

==Fire safety==

Firestopping at the &quot;perimeter slab edge&quot;, which is a gap between the floor and the curtain wall, is essential to slow the passage of fire and combustion gases between floors. Spandrel areas must have non-combustible insulation at the interior face of the curtain wall. Some building codes require the mullion to be wrapped in heat-retarding insulation near the ceiling to prevent the mullions from melting and spreading the fire to the floor above. The firestop at the perimeter slab edge is considered a continuation of the fire-resistance rating of the floor slab. The curtain wall itself, however, is not ordinarily required to have a rating. This causes a quandary as compartmentalization (fire protection) is typically based upon &quot;closed&quot; compartments to avoid fire and smoke migrations beyond each engaged compartment. A curtain wall by its very nature prevents the completion of the compartment (or envelope). The use of fire sprinklers has been shown to mitigate this matter. As such, unless the building is sprinklered, fire may still travel up the curtain wall, if the glass on the exposed floor is shattered from heat, causing flames to lick up the outside of the building.

Falling glass can endanger pedestrians, firefighters and firehoses below. An example of this is the 1988 First Interstate Tower fire in Los Angeles, California. The fire leapfrogged up the tower by shattering the glass and then consuming the aluminum framing holding the glass. Aluminum&#x27;s melting temperature is 660 °C, whereas building fires can reach 1,100 °C. The melting point of aluminum is typically reached within minutes of the start of a fire.

Fireman knock-out glazing panels are often required for venting and emergency access from the exterior. Knock-out panels are generally fully tempered glass to allow full fracturing of the panel into small pieces and relatively safe removal from the opening.

==Maintenance and repair==
Curtain walls and perimeter sealants require maintenance to maximize service life. Perimeter sealants, properly designed and installed, have a typical service life of 10 to 15 years. Removal and replacement of perimeter sealants require meticulous surface preparation and proper detailing.

Aluminum frames are generally painted or anodized. Care must be taken when cleaning areas around anodized material as some cleaning agents will destroy the finish. Factory applied fluoropolymer thermoset coatings have good resistance to environmental degradation and require only periodic cleaning. Recoating with an air-dry fluoropolymer coating is possible but requires special surface preparation and is not as durable as the baked-on original coating. Anodized aluminum frames cannot be &quot;re-anodized&quot; in place but can be cleaned and protected by proprietary clear coatings to improve appearance and durability.

Stainless steel curtain walls require no coatings, and embossed, as opposed to abrasively finished, surfaces maintain their original appearance indefinitely without cleaning or other maintenance. Some specially textured matte stainless steel surface finishes are hydrophobic and resist airborne and rain-borne pollutants. This has been valuable in the American Southwest and in the Mideast for avoiding dust, as well as avoiding soot and smoke staining in polluted urban areas.

<doc id="894203" wikidata="Q517498" url="?curid=894203" title="The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek">
<text>The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek (often shortened to Anatomy) is the second full-length album released by the Christian rock band Relient K. It was released on August 28, 2001, and peaked at No. 158 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On June 26, 2006, the album was certified Gold by the RIAA for sales in excess of 500,000 units in the United States. The cover of the original release is similar to that of the 1999 Ramones release &quot;Hey Ho! Let&#x27;s Go: The Anthology&quot;.

The album continues the band&#x27;s liberal use of pop culture references (such as the song &quot;I&#x27;m Lion-O,&quot; which is about the popular TV series &quot;Thundercats&quot;). Song themes range from pop culture to Christian themes—growth in faith (&quot;Pressing On&quot;), backsliding (&quot;What Have You Been Doing Lately?&quot;), worship (&quot;Those Words Are Not Enough,&quot; &quot;For the Moments I Feel Faint,&quot; and &quot;Less Is More&quot;)—and social themes—such as racism and persecution (&quot;Failure to Excommunicate&quot;), judgementalism (&quot;Down in Flames&quot;)—to making excuses or blaming others for one&#x27;s own faults (&quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Maybeline&quot;). There is also a song about one&#x27;s experiences in high school (&quot;Sadie Hawkins Dance&quot;).

Gotee Records released a &quot;Gold Edition&quot; of this album on October 31, 2006, along with the release of a &quot;Gold Edition&quot; of &quot;Two Lefts Don&#x27;t Make a Right...but Three Do&quot; on the same day. The Gold Edition of this album has remixed and remastered in a style similar to &quot;Mmhmm&quot; (the album was remixed by the same people who mixed &quot;Mmhmm&quot;) and it has a music video for the song &quot;Pressing On&quot;.

== References to popular culture ==
The last line of &quot;Pressing On&quot; is from &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; theme. &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Maybeline&quot; (deliberately misspelled, much like the band&#x27;s name) refers to the popular Maybelline line of beauty products and its tag line.

<text>Lake Timiskaming or Lake Temiskaming (, ) is a large freshwater lake on the provincial boundary between Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The lake, which forms part of the Ottawa River, is in length and covers an area of . Its water level ranges between and above sea-level, with a mean annual average of . The lake is in places up to deep. There are several islands on the lake, notably Mann and du Collège Islands.

The name is from the Algonquin &quot;Temikami&quot; or &quot;Temikaming&quot;, meaning &quot;deep body of water with rapid winds”

There are 30 species of fish in Lake Timiskaming, the best known are northern pike, sturgeon, lake trout, walleye, smallmouth bass, bullhead, carp, burbot, perch, and whitefish.

The lake was shaped during the last ice age when glaciers carved into the rock. It is also the remnants of a huge basin called Lake Ojibway, which existed about 9,500 years ago.

For the trading post and some history see Fort Témiscamingue.

One of Canada&#x27;s greatest boating tragedies occurred when twelve boys and a staff member of Ted Byfield&#x27;s St John&#x27;s School of Claremont died of drowning and hypothermia on a canoe trip on 11 June 1978 on the lake.

==Timiskaming Graben==
Lake Timiskaming is located within the ancient major rift valley Timiskaming Graben. It is the northern extension of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, which is part of the Saint Lawrence rift system. 

There have been recent earthquakes along the rift valley, the most recent being in 2000. There are numerous faults in the area and has produced cliffs such as Devil&#x27;s Rock, just south of Haileybury and is dated to be 2.2 billion years old. There are known kimberlite pipes within the rift valley that are considered to be diamondiferous.

<text>John Angus Chamberlain (April 16, 1927 – December 21, 2011), was an American sculptor and filmmaker. At the time of his death he resided and worked on Shelter Island, New York.

==Early life and career==
Born in Rochester, Indiana as the son of a saloonkeeper, Chamberlain was raised mostly by his grandmother after his parents divorced. He spent much of his youth in Chicago. After serving in the U.S. Navy from 1943 to 1946, he attended the Art Institute of Chicago (1951–52) and Black Mountain College (1955–56). At Black Mountain, he studied with the poets Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, and Robert Duncan, who were teaching there that semester. The following year, he moved to New York, where for the first time he created sculpture that included scrap-metal auto parts. Over the course of his prolific career, he had studios in New York, New Mexico, Florida, Connecticut, and finally Shelter Island.

==Work==
Chamberlain is best known for creating sculptures from old automobiles (or parts of) that bring the Abstract Expressionist style of painting into three dimensions. He began by carving and modelling, but turned to working in metal in 1952 and welding 1953. By 1957, while staying with the painter Larry Rivers in Southampton, New York, he began to include scrap metal from cars with his sculpture &quot;Shortstop&quot;, and from 1959 onward he concentrated on sculpture built entirely of crushed automobile parts welded together. Far more than just another wrinkle on assemblage &quot;Shortstop&quot; and subsequent works completely reinvented modeling, casting, and volume, altering Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s notion of the readymade and using the car as both medium and tool. In 1962 Donald Judd wrote, &quot;The only reason Chamberlain is not the best American sculptor under forty is the incommensurability of &#x27;the best&#x27; which makes it arbitrary to say so.&quot;

By the end of the 1960s, Chamberlain had replaced his signature materials initially with galvanized steel, then with mineral-coated Plexiglas, and finally with aluminum foil. In 1966, he began a series of sculptures made of rolled, folded, and tied urethane foam including sofas. After returning in the mid-1970s to metal as his primary material, Chamberlain limited himself to specific parts of the automobile (fenders, bumpers, or the chassis, for example). In 1973, two 300-pound metal pieces by Chamberlain were mistaken for junk and carted away as they sat outside a gallery warehouse in Chicago.

In the early 1980s, Chamberlain moved to Sarasota, Florida, where an 18,000-square-foot warehouse studio on Cocoanut Avenue enabled him to work on a much grander scale than he previously had. Many of the subsequent works Chamberlain made in Florida revert to more volumetric, compact configurations, often aligned on a vertical axis. As seen in the so-called &quot;Giraffe&quot; series (circa 1982–83), for example, linear patterns cavort over multicolored surfaces—the results of sandblasting the metal, removing the paint, and exposing the raw surface beneath. In 1984, Chamberlain created the monumental &quot;American Tableau&quot; created for display on the Seagram Building&#x27;s plaza.

Assembling intricately cut, painted metal parts, Chamberlain made his first mask, &quot;A Good Head and a Half&quot; (1991), for a benefit auction for Victim Services in 1991, providing aid to victims of sexual assault. He continued to produce masks throughout the 1990s in his studio on Shelter Island, titling many of them with opus numbers.

Chamberlain also made abstract colour paintings from 1963, and from 1967 he made several films, such as &quot;Wide Point&quot; (1968), and &quot;The Secret Life of Hernando Cortez&quot; (1968), filmed in Mexico with Warhol regulars Taylor Mead and Ultra Violet. He also made the film &quot;Black Cherry No-Cal&quot; (1971), a short black and white experimental film about a man and a woman that meet in Central Park on a bench. In the last decade of his life, the artist expanded his work to large-format photographs.

==Exhibitions==
Chamberlain&#x27;s first major solo show was held at the Martha Jackson Gallery, New York, in 1960. His singular method of putting discarded automobile-body parts together led to his inclusion in the paradigmatic exhibition &quot;The Art of Assemblage&quot;, at the Museum of Modern Art in 1961, where his work was shown alongside modern masters such as Marcel Duchamp and Pablo Picasso. His works have since been exhibited around the world and have been included in the São Paulo Art Biennial (1961, 1994), the Whitney Biennial (1973, 1987) and Documenta, Kassel, Germany (1982) and he has had over 100 solo shows, including Dia Art Foundation (1983); Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden and Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (1991); Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (1996); and Menil Collection, Houston (2009). Chamberlain represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 1964. He had his first retrospective in 1971, at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. A second retrospective was organized in 1986 by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. From February 24 to May 13, 2012, shortly after the artist&#x27;s death, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum showcased &quot;John Chamberlain: Choices&quot;, a comprehensive exhibition of the artist&#x27;s work. The exhibition examined the artist&#x27;s development over his sixty-year career, exploring the shifts in scale, materials, and techniques informed by the assemblage process that was central to his working method.
A special exhibition of Chamberlain&#x27;s foam sculptures and photographs was on view at the Chinati Foundation in 2005–06. Chamberlain supposedly has a work of art on the moon in the Moon Museum.

==Quotes==
Speaking about the &quot;meaning&quot; of his work he has said &quot;Even if I knew, I could only know what I thought it meant.&quot;

In allusion to how he worked he has said &quot;When a sculpture is nearly done, you can put things on and you take them off and it doesn’t make any difference…&quot;

And, &quot;Stopping is the key; you have to know when to stop. If I feel so glad that a sculpture is here, and I don’t care who did it, then I figure it&#x27;s a good piece.&quot;

==Art market==
In 2011, Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;Nutcracker&quot; (1958) from the Allan Stone Estate sold at auction for $4.7 million, more than twice its high $1.8 million estimate and a record price for the artist at auction.

The John Chamberlain Estate has been represented by Xavier Hufkens and Hauser &amp; Wirth since 2019. Prior to that it was represented by Gagosian Gallery. The artist&#x27;s earlier gallery representation includes The Pace Gallery from 1987 to 2005 and Leo Castelli from 1962 to 1987.

==Personal life==
In 1977 Chamberlain married Lorraine Belcher in New York City on New Year&#x27;s Eve. They maintained residences and studios in NYC, Essex, Connecticut, and Sarasota, FL. They divorced in 1986. John had three sons by his former wife, Elaine, who died in New Mexico after their divorce, in the early 70s. The boys, Angus, Jesse and Duncan then moved to NYC to live with their father. His middle son, Jesse, died in Sag Harbor in 1998.

In 1996, Chamberlain married art executive Prudence Fairweather, Dan Flavin&#x27;s former assistant. In 2000, he built a 72-by-82-foot studio on Shelter Island.

In her memoirs, Warhol superstar Ultra Violet claims that during the 1960s she and Chamberlain shared a romantic relationship which ended when first he crashed her car, then when told that she had become pregnant by him he responded, “That’s your problem”.

<doc id="894216" wikidata="Q277339" url="?curid=894216" title="Ferrari 250 GTO">
<text>The Ferrari 250 GTO is a grand tourer produced by Ferrari from 1962 to 1964 for homologation into the FIA&#x27;s Group 3 Grand Touring Car category. It was powered by Ferrari&#x27;s &quot;Tipo 168/62&quot; Colombo V12 engine. The &quot;250&quot; in its name denotes the displacement in cubic centimeters of each of its cylinders; &quot;GTO&quot; stands for &quot;Gran Turismo Omologato&quot;, Italian for &quot;Grand Touring Homologated&quot;.

Just 36 of the 250 GTOs were manufactured between 1962 and 1964. This includes 33 cars with 1962–63 bodywork (Series I) and three with 1964 (Series II) bodywork similar to the Ferrari 250 LM. Four of the older 1962–1963 (Series I) cars were updated in 1964 with Series II bodies.

When new, the 250 GTO cost $18,000 in the United States, with buyers personally approved by Enzo Ferrari and his dealer for North America, Luigi Chinetti. This model has since become highly desired by automobile collectors and sales have repeatedly set price records. The current record for world&#x27;s most expensive Ferrari was set in June 2018 when a 1963 250 GTO (chassis 4153GT) was sold in a private sale for $70 million.

In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; placed the 250 GTO eighth on a list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s, and nominated it the top sports car of all time. Similarly, &quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; placed the 250 GTO first on a list of the &quot;Greatest Ferraris of All Time&quot;. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; named it the &quot;Hottest Car of All Time&quot;.

== Design and development ==
The 250 GTO was designed to compete in Group 3 GT racing, where its rivals would include the Shelby Cobra, Jaguar E-Type and Aston Martin DP214. The development of the 250 GTO was headed by chief engineer Giotto Bizzarrini. Although Bizzarrini is usually credited as the designer of the 250 GTO, he and most other Ferrari engineers were fired in 1962 due to a dispute with Enzo Ferrari. Further development of the 250 GTO was overseen by new engineer Mauro Forghieri, who worked with Scaglietti to continue development of the body. The design of the car was a collaborative effort and cannot be ascribed to a single person.

The mechanical aspects of 250 GTO were relatively conservative at the time of its introduction, using engine and chassis components that were proven in earlier competition cars. The chassis of the car was based on that of the 250 GT SWB, with minor differences in frame structure and geometry to reduce weight, stiffen and lower the chassis. The car was built around a hand-welded oval tube frame, incorporating A-arm front suspension, rear live-axle with Watt&#x27;s linkage, disc brakes, and Borrani wire wheels. The engine was the race-proven Tipo 168/62 Comp. V12 as used in the 250 Testa Rossa Le Mans winner. An all-alloy design utilizing a dry sump and six 38DCN Weber carburetors, it produced approximately at 7500 rpm and at 5500 rpm of torque. The gearbox was a new 5-speed unit with Porsche-type synchromesh.

Bizzarrini focused his design effort on the car&#x27;s aerodynamics in an attempt to improve top speed and stability. The body design was informed by wind tunnel testing at Pisa University as well as road and track testing with several prototypes. The resulting all-aluminium bodywork had a long, low nose, small radiator inlet, and distinctive air intakes on the nose with removable covers. Early testing resulted in the addition of a rear spoiler. The underside of the car was covered by a belly pan and had an additional spoiler underneath formed by the fuel tank cover. The aerodynamic design of the 250 GTO was a major technical innovation compared to previous Ferrari GT cars, and in line with contemporary developments by manufacturers such as Lotus. The bodies were constructed by Scaglietti, with the exception of early prototypes with bodies constructed in-house by Ferrari or by Pininfarina (in the case of s/n 2643 GT). Cars were produced in many colours, with the most famous being the bright red &quot;Rosso Cina&quot;.

The minimalist interior of a 250 GTO reflects the car&#x27;s racing intentions. There is no speedometer, seats are cloth-upholstered, and neither carpeting nor a headliner was installed. Cockpit ventilation is via exterior air inlets. The exposed metal gate defining the shift pattern became a Ferrari tradition maintained in production models until replaced by steering column-mounted paddle shifters in the 2000s.

=== Prototypes ===
As the 250 GTO was heavily derived from the earlier 250 GT Berlinetta SWB, Ferrari engineers constructed two 250 GTO prototypes in 1961 by converting existing chassis of this type.

The first prototype, designated in official photos as the 1961 Ferrari 250 GT Le Mans Berlinetta Sperimentale, was constructed from chassis 2643GT, originally a 1961 250 GT SWB. It was built to competition specification, which included a reinforced chassis, a competition gearbox and a &quot;Tipo 168/61&quot; 3.0 L engine tuned to 300 bhp, equipped with dry sump lubrication and six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. Pininfarina constructed a new lightweight aluminium alloy body for this prototype, which resembled that of the 400 Super America coupe. 2643GT was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the 1961 24 hours of Le Mans, driven by Fernand Tavano and Giancarlo Baghetti. Although they were running as high as 8th overall, they were forced to retire at 4:45 am on Sunday morning due to engine failure. During the course of the race, Ferrari engineers gathered information about the performance of the car which was used to modify and improve it, including the addition of a rear spoiler. During the Le Mans race, 2643GT suffered from high-speed instability, possibly due to the front end design. Following Le Mans, 2643GT returned to the factory, where it was used for more testing. The prototype raced again at the 1962 Daytona Continental 3 hours, where it placed 4th overall and 1st in the GT class driven by Stirling Moss. Subsequently, it was sold to N.A.R.T. and a succession of private owners.

The second prototype was also constructed from a donor car, although sources disagree on the chassis number and type. Several older sources mention the donor as a 1960 250 GT SWB, chassis 2053GT. Alternatively, other sources have claimed that a 250 GT Boano (0523GT) or a 1959 250 GT SWB (1791GT) was used as the donor car. This prototype was created entirely by the Ferrari factory&#x27;s racing department under the oversight of Giotto Bizzarrini, including the bodywork. The original chassis was extensively modified, including relocation of the engine mounts lower and further back in the frame. A competition-specification engine was fitted, including six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. The bodywork seen on the second prototype in period photos was rough, unfinished aluminium. The body&#x27;s ungainly appearance lead the Ferrari team to nickname it &quot;Il Mostro&quot; (the Monster) and the press to call it &quot;The Anteater&quot;. Hammer marks, weld beads and bolted or riveted panels could be seen throughout, evidence of the continual modifications performed during factory testing in 1961. Although the body was crudely formed, it displayed features that would be seen in the production 250 GTO, including the overall profile of a low hood and high rear, triple front air intakes, engine bay cooling slots in the front fenders and plexiglass-covered headlights. The interior was hastily constructed and even more minimal than in the production 250 GTO, with scattered instrumentation and a bare aluminium dashboard.

The second prototype was tested at Monza in September 1961 by Stirling Moss. Results were promising, as the prototype was able to lap the circuit faster than a 250 GT SWB. However, the high speed stability issues seen during testing of the first prototype remained. Shortly after this test, construction of the first production 250 GTOs began in late 1961 with chassis 3223GT and 3387GT.

As the prototype was no longer needed for testing, the experimental body was scrapped. Regardless of the identity of the chassis, sources are in agreement that the second GTO prototype was either partially or entirely scrapped and is no longer extant in its 1961 form. If 2053GT was indeed the chassis, it was then given a 250 GT SWB style body and sold to Jacques Swaters. 2053GT crashed during the 1962 Nürburgring 1000 km and was then rebodied by Carrozzeria Sports Cars. Subsequently, 2053GT was totally destroyed in an accident at the 1964 Spa 500km.

===Variants and related models===
Handbuild production, updates, and repairs throughout each car&#x27;s competition history result in differences both visible and invisible between individual 250 GTOs. Variance in air intake/vent configuration is common among cars. Modifications to the original bodywork were performed by the factory, Scaglietti, or other body shops, usually after crashes or according to a racing team&#x27;s wishes.

In 1964, Ferrari tasked Mauro Forghieri and Mike Parkes with redesigning the 250 GTO&#x27;s bodywork, resulting in what became known as the GTO &#x27;64 (or Series II). Three new cars were produced to the 1964 specification, and four earlier 250 GTOs were retrofitted to it by the factory. This redesign was intended to maintain the GTO&#x27;s competitiveness for one more year, as the FIA decided to not approve the 250 LM for GT-class racing during the 1964 season. The Ferrari engineers incorporated many of the 250LM&#x27;s aerodynamic features into the 1964 GTO. This resulted in a visual similarity between the two models, even though the GTO does not share the 250LM&#x27;s mid engine rear wheel drive layout. The factory also made minor modifications to the engine, gearbox, chassis, suspension and interior. Despite these changes, the overall performance improvement was slight. The GTO &#x27;64 still saw some racing success with factory and privateer teams, including an overall win at Daytona in 1964 by Phil Hill and Pedro Rodriguez driving for NART.

Three 330 GTO specials were made using the 250 GTO chassis and body fitted with 400 Superamerica 4.0-liter motors. Distinguished by a larger bonnet bulge, these cars were used briefly for racing and testing by Scuderia Ferrari before being sold to private customers. Some sources include these cars in the total number of 250 GTOs produced, increasing that number from 36 to 39.

The 330 LMB is sometimes considered a GTO variant. These cars used a 4.0-liter 330 motor and a modified 250 GT Lusso chassis/body. Four were produced in 1963.

Three 275 GTB/C Speciales were built in 1964/65. Despite their origins as competition versions of the 275 GTB, they are sometimes considered developments of the 250 GTO due to similarity of configuration and bodywork.

The Ferrari 250 GT SWB Breadvan was a one-off racing car designed for Scuderia Serenissima by Bizzarrini after his departure from Ferrari. It was developed specifically to compete against the then-new 250 GTO. Although based on the earlier 250 GT Berlinetta SWB, the Breadvan provided an opportunity for Bizzarrini to develop the ideas he had first explored with the GTO, such as lower and more aerodynamic bodywork, incorporation of a dry sump, and radical lightening of the entire car.

== Racing ==

The 250 GTO&#x27;s racing debut was at the 1962 12 Hours of Sebring, driven by American Phil Hill (the Formula One World Driving Champion at the time) and Belgian Olivier Gendebien. Although originally annoyed that they were driving a GT-class car instead of one of the full-race 250 Testa Rossas competing in the prototype class, the experienced pair impressed themselves (and everyone else) by finishing second overall behind the Testa Rossa of Bonnier and Scarfiotti.

Ferrari would go on to win the over 2000cc class of the FIA&#x27;s International Championship for GT Manufacturers in 1962, 1963, and 1964, the 250 GTO being raced in each of those years. 250 GTOs also won the 1963 and 1964 Tour de France Automobile, marking Ferrari&#x27;s nine year dominance of that race.

During the 1962-1964 racing seasons, only a few other GT-class models were consistently competitive with the 250 GTO. These were the Jaguar E-type, Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato, DP212, DP214, and DP215, and the AC Cobras. In addition to official Scuderia Ferrari entries, many 250 GTOs were also raced by independent racing teams and private drivers. During this time it was therefore common for 250 GTO drivers to compete against other 250 GTOs. The 250 GTO was one of the last front-engined cars to remain competitive at the top level of sports car racing.

The 250 GTO gradually passed into obsolescence following the 1964 season. Scuderia Ferrari withdrew the 250 GTO from its racing activity by 1965, leaving only a few independent teams and private owners to campaign it in endurance races, rallies and hillclimbs. By 1967, the 250 GTO was almost entirely absent from international racing, with only a few rally and hillclimb results during that year. Prior to the development of the 250 GTO collector market and associated vintage racing and show events, some of the surviving 250 GTOs were used in regional races, while others were used as road cars.

=== Homologation ===
FIA regulations in 1962 required at least one hundred examples of a car to be built in order for it to be homologated for Group 3 Grand Touring Car racing. Ferrari built only 36 250 GTOs (33 of the 1962-design Series I cars and three 1964-design Series II cars, with revised bodywork). The additional three &quot;330 GTO&quot; cars with the four-litre &quot;330 engine&quot; —recognizable by the large hump on the bonnet— are sometimes included in the overall production number, bringing the total to 39. It became a popular myth that when FIA inspectors showed up to confirm that 100 examples had been built, Enzo Ferrari shuffled the same cars between different locations, thus giving the impression that the full complement of 100 cars was present. In reality, no deception was required, as the production of the 250 GTO was covered by the homologation of the earlier 250 GT Berlinetta SWB model. These homologation papers were issued in 1960, but extensions were applied for and accepted multiple times between 1961 and 1964, allowing Ferrari to add modifications not covered under the original specification, including changes to the engine, transmission, and suspension. Additionally, since more than 100 bodies had been built according to the earlier 250 GT SWB specification, FIA regulations allowed a new body to be designed, leading to the development of the new 250 GTO body style. This method of homologation was not unique to Ferrari, as similar methods were used to homologate the Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato and the Jaguar E-Type Lightweight.

== Collectibility ==
While the GTO is now arguably the most valuable collector car in the world, it was merely a no-frills used race car in the late 1960s and very early 1970s. Many of the vehicles were offered at or acquired for four-figure (USD) sums. In contrast, restored Duesenberg Model Js often sold for about $50,000 around 1970.

From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, classic car values rose rapidly and the 250 GTO became the most valuable Ferrari model, touted as the Ferrari that most completely embodies the characteristics of the manufacturer. Prices fell substantially during the car market crash of the early 1990s, resulting in lows of $2,700,000 in September 1994 and $2,500,000 in May 1996. Prices began to climb again in the late 90s and have continued to rise through the present day. 250 GTOs have repeatedly broken records for most expensive car ever sold at auction or private sale. The current record for world&#x27;s most expensive Ferrari was set in June 2018 when a 1963 250 GTO (chassis 4153GT) was sold to David MacNeil in a private sale for $70 million. On 25 August 2018, RM Sotheby&#x27;s sold Greg Whitten&#x27;s 250 GTO 3413GT at their Monterey auction. The final price inclusive of buyer&#x27;s fee was $48,405,000, representing a new record for most expensive car ever sold at auction. The previous record was also held by a 250 GTO, 3851GT, which was sold at the Bonhams Quail Lodge auction in 2014.

Scarcity and high prices led to the creation of several replica 250 GTOs on more common Ferrari chassis. Misrepresentations of the original cars, offered for sale at full market value, have been reported.

<doc id="894218" wikidata="Q251106" url="?curid=894218" title="Cocoa butter">
<text>Cocoa butter, also called theobroma oil, is a pale-yellow, edible fat extracted from the cocoa bean (&quot;Theobroma cacao&quot;). It is used to make chocolate, as well as some ointments, toiletries, and pharmaceuticals. Cocoa butter has a cocoa flavor and aroma. Its melting point is slightly below human body temperature. It is an essential ingredient of chocolate and related confectionary products. Cocoa butter does not contain butter or other animal products; it is vegan.

== Extraction and composition ==

For use in chocolate manufacture, the cocoa beans are first fermented and then dried. The beans are then roasted and separated from their hulls to produce cocoa nibs. About 54–58% of the cocoa nibs is cocoa butter. The cocoa nibs are ground to form 
cocoa mass, also known as cocoa liquor or chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor is pressed to separate the cocoa butter from the non-fat cocoa solids. Cocoa butter is sometimes deodorized to remove strong or undesirable tastes.

Cocoa butter contains a high proportion of saturated fats also with the monounsaturated oleic acid in each triglyceride. The predominant triglycerides are POS, SOS, and POP, where P = palmitic, O = oleic, and S = stearic acid residues. Cocoa butter, unlike non-fat cocoa solids, contains only traces of caffeine and theobromine.

=== Adulterants and substitutes===
Some food manufacturers substitute less expensive materials in place of cocoa butter. Several analytical methods exist for testing for diluted cocoa butter. Adulterated cocoa butter is indicated by its lighter color and its diminished fluorescence upon ultraviolet illumination. Unlike cocoa butter, adulterated fat tends to smear and have a higher non-saponifiable content.

Owing to the high cost of cocoa butter, substitutes have been designed to use as alternatives. In the United States, 100% cocoa butter must be used as the product&#x27;s fat source for the product to be called chocolate. The EU requires that alternative fats not exceed 5% of the total fat content.

Substitutes include: coconut, palm, soybean, rapeseed, cottonseed and illipe oils; and shea butter, mango kernel fat and a mixture of mango kernel fat and palm oil, and PGPR.

== Uses ==

Cocoa butter is a major ingredient in practically all types of chocolates, especially white, milk, and couverture chocolate. This application continues to dominate the consumption of cocoa butter.

Pharmaceutical companies use cocoa butter extensively. As a nontoxic solid at room temperature that melts at body temperature, it is considered an ideal base for medicinal suppositories.

===Personal care===
For a fat melting around body temperature, cocoa has good stability. This quality, coupled with natural antioxidants, prevents rancidity – giving it a storage life of two to five years. The velvety texture, pleasant fragrance and emollient properties of cocoa butter have made it a popular ingredient in products for the skin, such as soaps and lotions.

==History==
Cocoa butter was first made by boiling cocoa mass with water and skimming off the fat floating over it. In the 18th century, the first hydraulic presses were used to press cocoa butter and the (more effective) Van Houten press began to be employed in the second half of the 19th century. A by-product of chocolate factories, cocoa butter was mainly used for cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations until the late 19th century. It eventually became a common chocolate ingredient with the rise of chocolate in confectionery.

== Physical properties ==

Cocoa butter typically has a melting point of around , so chocolate is solid at room temperature but readily melts once inside the mouth. Cocoa butter displays polymorphism, having different crystalline forms with different melting points. Conventionally the assignment of cocoa butter crystalline forms uses the nomenclature of Wille and Lutton with forms I, II, III, IV, V, and VI having melting points , respectively. The production of chocolate aims to crystallise the chocolate so that the cocoa butter is predominantly in form V, which is the most stable form that can be obtained from melted cocoa butter. (Form VI either develops in solid cocoa butter after long storage or is obtained by crystallisation from solvents). A uniform form V crystal structure will result in smooth texture, sheen, and snap. This structure is obtained by chocolate tempering. Melting the cocoa butter in chocolate and then allowing it to solidify without tempering leads to the formation of unstable polymorphic forms of cocoa butter. This can easily happen when chocolate bars are allowed to melt in a hot room and lead to the formation of white patches on the surface of the chocolate called fat bloom or chocolate bloom.

Cocoa butter from different places has different properties. Malaysian and Indonesian cocoa butter generally crystallizes faster, and into a harder chocolate than Brazilian cocoa butter. Brazilian cocoa butter, after slowly crystallizing, forms a softer chocolate. West African cocoa butter has properties between the two.

<text>Two Lefts Don&#x27;t Make a Right...but Three Do (often called Two Lefts) is the third full-length album released by Christian rock band Relient K. The album was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Gospel Album, but the award that year ended up being won by &quot;Worldwide&quot; by Audio Adrenaline. This album was initially released with four different covers, each one depicting a separate car wreck. In November 2003, a fifth cover was released, which showed all four cars in a junkyard. That is now the only version of the CD still in print, although a very small amount the four original covers can still be found. It was also released as a combo pack with &quot;Deck the Halls, Bruise Your Hand&quot; for a few years around Christmas time. The album peaked at No. 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

&quot;Two Lefts Don&#x27;t Make a Right...but Three Do&quot; was certified Gold on March 21, 2005 by the RIAA for sales in excess of 500,000 in the United States. It has currently sold around 518,000 in the United States. A Gold Edition of this album was released on October 31, 2006. The idea for a Gold Edition of this album came from Gotee Records, who also released a Gold Edition of &quot;The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek&quot; on the same day. The Gold Edition of this album has remixed and remastered sound similar to &quot;Mmhmm&quot; (the album was remixed by the same people who mixed &quot;Mmhmm&quot;) and it is also enhanced with a music video for the song &quot;Chap Stick, Chapped Lips, and Things Like Chemistry&quot;.

<text>Look Forward to Failure is an EP released on November 10, 1998, by The Ataris on Fat Wreck Chords. This was the first album released to feature fan favorite &quot;San Dimas High School Football Rules&quot;, a song that would later appear on &quot;Blue Skies, Broken Hearts...Next 12 Exits&quot;. The band also intended on putting the song &quot;That Special Girl&quot; on &quot;Blue Skies, Broken Hearts&quot; as well but it didn&#x27;t make the cut. The song features Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 on backing vocals. The version of &quot;My Hotel Year&quot; that appears on this EP is the electric version and contains an extra verse at the end. The version that ended up on &quot;Blue Skies&quot; was acoustic and shortened.

<text>William Riley Burnett (November 25, 1899 April 25, 1982) was an American novelist and screenwriter. He is best known for the crime novel &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, the film adaptation of which is considered the first of the classic American gangster movies.

==Early life==
Burnett was born in Springfield, Ohio, and attended Miami Military Institute in Germantown, Ohio. He left his civil service job in Springfield to move to Chicago when he was 28, by which time he had written over 100 short stories and five novels, all unpublished.

==Writing career==
In Chicago, Burnett found a job as a night clerk in the seedy Northmere Hotel. He found himself associating with prize fighters, hoodlums, hustlers and hobos. They inspired &quot;Little Caesar&quot; (novel 1929, film 1931). The novel&#x27;s overnight success landed him a job as a Hollywood screenwriter. &quot;Little Caesar&quot; became a classic movie, produced by First National Pictures (Warner Brothers) and starring then little known Edward G. Robinson. Burnett returned to the Al Capone theme in 1932 with &quot;Scarface&quot;. He won the 1930 O. Henry Award for his short story &quot;Dressing-Up&quot;, published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; in November 1929.

Burnett published a novel or more a year and turned most into screenplays (some as many as three times). Thematically Burnett was similar to Dashiell Hammett and James M. Cain, but contrasting the corruption and corrosion of the city with the better life his characters yearned for. He portrayed characters who, for one reason or another, fell into a life of crime and were unable to climb out. They typically get one last shot at salvation but the oppressive system closes in and denies redemption.

==Film work==
Burnett wrote for many of the great actors and directors, including Raoul Walsh, John Huston, John Ford, Howard Hawks, Nicholas Ray, Douglas Sirk, and Michael Cimino, John Wayne (&quot;The Dark Command&quot;), Humphrey Bogart, Ida Lupino, Paul Muni, Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood. He received an Oscar nomination for his script for &quot;Wake Island&quot; (1942) and a Writers Guild nomination for his script for &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. In addition to his film work, he also wrote scripts for television and radio.

In &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941), Humphrey Bogart plays Roy Earle, a hard-bitten criminal who rejects his life of crime to help a sexually appealing crippled girl. In &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950), the most perfectly masterminded plot falls apart as each character reveals a weakness. In &quot;The Beast of the City&quot; (1932) starring Walter Huston, the police take the law into their own hands when the criminals walk free due to legal incompetence.

==Later years==
In later years, with his vision declining, he stopped writing and turned to promoting his earlier work. On his death in 1982, in Santa Monica, California, Burnett was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Critical reception==
Heywood Broun described Burnett&#x27;s novel &quot;Goodbye to the Past&quot; as &quot;written with all the excitement of &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, and ten times the skill&quot;.

<text>The Mercury Sable is a range of automobiles manufactured and marketed by the Mercury brand of Ford Motor Company. Introduced on December 26, 1985, as the replacement for the Mercury Marquis, the Sable marked the transition of the mid-size Mercury product range to front-wheel drive.

Over its production span, the Sable was Mercury&#x27;s badge-engineered counterpart to the Ford Taurus, below the Grand Marquis in the Mercury range. From the 1986 to 2005 model years, it was produced as a mid-size four-door sedan and five-door station wagon. For 2006, the Sable was replaced by the full-size Montego and mid-size Milan. It was reintroduced for 2008 as a full-size car, offered as a four-door sedan.

Because of declining sales, the Sable was discontinued after the 2009 model year, leaving no Mercury counterpart for the sixth-generation Taurus. The final Sable was produced on May 21, 2009; in total, 2,112,374 Sables were produced during its 1985 to 2005 production run.

== Background ==
In early 1980, the Mercury Sable began development alongside the Ford Taurus; the $3.5 billion project would become the largest development ever undertaken by Ford at the time. Originally intended to replace its full-size and mid-size rear-wheel drive product lines (Panther and Fox platforms, respectively), the Taurus/Sable were focused toward the mid-size segment in 1981, as the company felt stabilization of gasoline prices justified the continuation of its full-size model lines. The Taurus was to replace the Ford LTD while the Sable replaced the Mercury Marquis.

While designed entirely in North America, the Taurus/Sable were designed under a similar approach as the Ford Escort, using an interdisciplinary team approach; each element of the vehicle was designed concurrently, including manufacturing and assembly. Along with input from potential buyers (in stark contrast to the Edsel), Ford used reverse engineering of competitive vehicles as a design input tool.

During the development of the Sable, Mercury had become one of the final American brands to adopt front-wheel drive into its vehicle line. In 1982, as a sedan/station wagon version of the Chevrolet Citation, General Motors produced the quartet of the Chevrolet Celebrity/Pontiac 6000/Oldsmobile Cutlass/Buick Century; a year later, Chrysler expanded its K cars into the mid-size segment with the first front-wheel-drive Chrysler New Yorker. Coinciding with the 1986 launch of the Sable, General Motors downsized Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac full-size sedans to front-wheel drive, only slightly larger than the mid-size Sable.

For 1983, Mercury underwent a brand revision, with the Cougar reverting to its traditional role as a two-door personal coupe alongside the Ford Thunderbird; while retaining the same chassis underpinnings, the Thunderbird and Cougar underwent a complete exterior redesign, becoming the first Ford cars produced with highly aerodynamic designs, a central objective of the Taurus/Sable design. The 1983 Cougar was well received in the marketplace (outselling the 1983 Thunderbird); Ford would choose to abandon &quot;boxy&quot; car designs altogether, influencing other car manufacturers to follow suit during the 1980s. Following the Thunderbird and Cougar, Ford introduced the 1984 Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz. The compact front-wheel drive replacements for the Ford Fairmont/Mercury Zephyr, the Tempo/Topaz marked the first use of aerodynamic body design by Ford for a sedan.

=== Release ===
In mid-1985, Ford unveiled the Mercury Sable alongside the Ford Taurus as a 1986 model. In place of a traditional auto show unveiling, the launch was held an MGM Studios soundstage (where &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was filmed). Ford workers came into the room, which was decorated in space-age decor, holding cups shaped like flying saucers and the Taurus and Sable were sitting behind a curtain. With the flashing of strobe lights and a drum-roll, the curtain was pulled back and the two cars were revealed to the public. Ford planned a sensual marketing campaign for the Sable featuring singer and entertainer Bette Midler. However, Midler turned down Ford&#x27;s offer and refused to appear in the ads, so Ford utilized an impersonator of Midler as a substitute. Midler sued in response, leading to the memorable case &quot;Midler v. Ford Motor Co.&quot; which clarified whether impersonations could be considered an appropriation of identity.

== First generation (1986–1991) ==
Launched at the end of 1985 as a 1986 model, the Mercury Sable replaced the Mercury Marquis as the mid-size Mercury line, slotted between the Topaz and Grand Marquis/Colony Park. Developed alongside the Ford Taurus, the Sable was marketed alongside its Marquis predecessor for 1986, as Ford sought to protect its investment in the project. 

Though outsold by the Taurus (which would go on to become the best-selling car in the United States) by a wide margin, the Sable would prove successful on its own, competing with the Grand Marquis to serve as the highest-selling Mercury model line. The Sable was on Car and Driver magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list on its release in 1986 and again in 1990 and 1991. 

As Ford did not market the Mercury brand in Mexico, Ford of Mexico marketed the model line as the Ford Taurus. In South Korea, the Mercury Sable was marketed by Kia alongside the Kia Potentia (Mazda Luce/929) as they assemble Kia Pride as Ford Festiva in export market.
=== Chassis specification ===
The first-generation Sable used the front-wheel drive Ford DN5 platform, sharing its wheelbase with the Ford Taurus. As with its Marquis predecessor, the Sable used unibody construction. The Sable was equipped with a four-wheel independent suspension. The front axle was fitted with MacPherson struts and a stabilizer bar; the rear axle on sedans was a coil-spring 4-link layout (also with MacPherson struts), while the rear suspension on station wagons was a coil-spring double-wishbone design (short/long arm), along with a stabilizer bar. As with the Marquis, the Sable was equipped with front disc brakes and rear drum brakes; station wagons were fitted with larger rear brakes.

==== Powertrain ====
For 1986, the Sable was offered was with two engines: a 90 hp HSC I4 (mated to a three-speed automatic) and a 140 hp Vulcan V6 (paired to a four-speed automatic). Following poor sales of the four-cylinder engine in the Sable, the engine was dropped from the line (though remaining standard on the Taurus through 1991), along with the 3-speed automatic. For 1988, a 3.8 L Essex V6 was introduced as an optional engine. Though rated with the same 140 hp output as the 3.0 L Vulcan V6, the 3.8 L V6 was rated with nearly 35% more torque output (popular in the heavier station wagons). 

In contrast to the Taurus, the first-generation Sable (nor any of its successors) was not offered with a manual transmission. 
=== Body design ===
The first-generation Sable was offered in two body styles: a four-door sedan and a five-door station wagon. While its 1983–1986 Marquis predecessor shared nearly its entire body with its Ford LTD counterpart, the Sable sedan shared only its doors and roof stamping with the Taurus. In what would become a tradition for four model generations, the station wagon body for both model lines was derived from the Sable; the Taurus wagon was styled with its own front fascia. 

To differentiate its 6-window roofline from the Taurus, the Sable sedan borrowed design elements from the Ford Scorpio liftback sedan, using blacked-out B, C, and D-pillars for a &quot;floating roof&quot; effect. In place of the body-color grille insert used by Ford, the Sable was fitted with a low-wattage lightbar between the headlamps; the lightbar became a design feature later adapted by the Mercury Topaz, Tracer and Villager, though it did not illuminate on the former two models. The lightbar design element largely emphasized the lack of a conventional grille (while primarily a &quot;bottom-breather&quot; design, a vestigial air intake slot was also designed into the bumper below the lightbar); a design pioneered by the 1950s Citroën DS, within Ford, the configuration was also used by the Ford Mustang SVO and Ford Sierra.

As with its Marquis predecessor, the Sable station wagon was designed with a rear liftback, but introduced a new configuration for the rear hatch, allowing the rear window glass to be opened separately from the rest of the rear hatch. In a design first for Mercury station wagons, exterior woodgrain trim was not offered as an option. 

Alongside the Taurus, the Sable was the first American-produced sedan to use aerodynamic composite headlights with replaceable halogen bulbs; to begin their use, Ford (and other auto manufacturers) lobbied the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to have them approved, with the 1984 Continental Mark VII becoming the first American car to use them.

While the Sable shared largely the same interior features as the Taurus, in a departure from tradition, the Sable was designed with a model-specific dashboard (partly integrated into the door panels). Sable sedans were equipped with a 50/50 split bench seat as standard equipment (joining the Grand Marquis as a six-passenger Mercury sedan); as an option, front bucket seats were offered (reducing capacity to five). The Sable wagon was offered with an optional rear-facing third-row seat, bringing seating to seven or eight; for the first time since the 1977 Cougar wagon, Mercury offered the design in its midsize station wagon. 

During its production, the first-generation Sable underwent few changes. For 1989, the exterior underwent a mid-cycle revision; the amber parking lamp lenses were replaced by clear units and sedans saw revisions to taillamp lenses. For 1990, the Sable underwent a redesign of the dashboard to accommodate the addition of a driver-side airbag; a CD player was added as an option.

=== Trim ===
The first-generation Mercury Sable was sold in two trim levels (opposed to the four of the Taurus). In line with other Mercury models, a base-trim GS (comparable to the GL-trim Taurus) and top-trim LS (slightly above the Taurus LX) was offered. 

As Mercury never offered the first-generation Sable with a manual transmission, no Mercury Sable equivalent to the Taurus MT-5 nor the Taurus SHO was ever introduced.

=== Production ===
== Second generation (1992–1995) ==

For the 1992 model year, the second-generation Sable was introduced. As part of a $650 million investment in the Taurus and Sable, both model lines received significant updates, focusing on the interior and front and rear fascias. In contrast to the previous Sable, Ford chose an evolutionary change for the model line; though visibly similar to the previous generation, every body panel on the Sable sedan (except the doors) was changed. On the station wagon (shared with both the Sable and Taurus), the front fascia was redesigned, along with the interior. 

The interior of the Sable underwent a redesign of the door panels, dashboard, and interior controls. Following the 1990 addition of a driver-side airbag, the Sable gained a passenger-side airbag as an option for 1992 (becoming standard in 1993). For 1993, the steering wheel was redesigned (returning the horn to the center of the steering wheel). 

The base &quot;GS&quot; and luxury &quot;LS&quot; trim levels were carried over from the previous generation. A front cloth bench seat was standard on GS sedans and wagons, although cloth bucket seats were available on GS sedans only. Higher-end cloth bucket seats were standard on LS sedans, but a bench seat was a no cost option. A front bench was standard on LS wagons, with bucket seats optional. Leather seating surfaces were available on all LS Sables.

In 1992 for MY 1993, unpopular optional features such as the &quot;InstaClear&quot; heated windshield were eliminated. For 3.0L V6 engines, the drive belt system became a single-belt setup for 1993 (previously, the 3.0L alternator had used a separate belt). Also, some 3.0L 1994 models began receiving the new AX4N transmission.

The wagon version was available with mostly the same options as the sedan versions. Wagons had a maximum of 81.1 cubic feet of cargo area with the 60/40 split rear seat folded down. They featured a 2-way liftgate (raise the entire liftgate or just the window), a roof rack with crossbar and tie-downs, an optional rear-facing third seat, a lockable under-floor compartment, and an optional fold-out picnic table. With both rear split seats in the upright position, standard cargo capacity was 45.7 cubic feet. Wagons that were equipped with the front bench seat and rear folding seat could seat eight people; while over two feet shorter than the 1991 Mercury Colony Park, the Sable wagon became the sole eight-passenger vehicle offered by Lincoln-Mercury (as the Mercury Villager minivan seated seven).

1995 was the final model year of the second-generation Sable; the rare LTS trim level was added. It featured leather bucket seats, Taurus LX–style alloy wheels, special cladding, and many leather wrapped interior trim parts. The LTS trim had either the standard 3.0 L Vulcan V6 or the optional 3.8 L Essex V6.

== Third generation (1996–1999) ==

The third-generation Sable was introduced for the 1996 model year. The platform used for the previous two generations underwent an extensive revision, redesignated as the DN101 platform; the wheelbase was extended from 106 to 108.5 inches. As before, the Sable returned as a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon. 

While mechanically identical to its Ford Taurus counterpart, the sedans of the two model lines shared less sheetmetal than before, with only the front doors, hood, and front fenders common between the Taurus and Sable (as before, the Sable served as the basis for Ford and Mercury station wagons). In contrast to the oval-influenced roofline of the Ford Taurus, the Sable was styled with a sloped roofline with a rectangular rear window; the model received its own front and rear fascias. In place of the long-running lightbar, the Sable received a chrome-trimmed grille with oval headlight housings. In a design first for the model line, the Sable was fitted with the same interior as the Taurus (with the exception of seat fabrics). 

The trim lines saw a minor revision, with the Sable G introduced as a new entry-level model and the Sable LTS discontinued. The Sable G was offered solely as a sedan, with several standard power options (but only an AM/FM radio). For higher sales volumes, the GS and LS made their return, offered both in sedan and station wagon form. For the Sable G and GS, the standard engine was the 3.0 L Vulcan V6, producing 145 hp. For the Sable LS, the standard engine was a 3.0 L DOHC &quot;Duratec&quot; V6, producing 200 hp; optional in the Sable GS, the Duratec engine was an enlarged version of the engine from the Mercury Mystique. 

For 1997, the Sable underwent several cost-cutting revisions; several features of the LS became available on the GS as options. For 1998, the Sable underwent a mid-cycle revision, distinguished by new headlights and a centered Mercury emblem in the grille; the Sable G was discontinued. The Vulcan V6 engine became standard on all Sables, with the Duratec optional only on the LS for 1999. In an effort to stimulate sales, Mercury cut the price of the Sable by up to $2,000 for 1999 (by revising the availability of options).

== Fourth generation (2000–2005) ==

The Sable received another redesign in 1999 for MY 2000, which minimized some of the oval design elements from the 1996 model, replacing them with more conventional styling. The redesign also featured a taller roof over the rear-passenger space, to increase passenger headroom that had been sacrificed by the tapered 1996 design. The taller and roomier trunk also served to make the vehicle more functional. The interior was completely changed for a much more conservative design. Certain elements of the interior were retained from the 1996 model, such as the integrated control console, which combined the sound system and climate controls into one panel; but the shape of that panel was changed from the controversial oval to a more conventional and conservative trapezoid. The suspension was also softened to appeal to a broader, non-sporting audience. To reduce the price and increase profitability, many features such as four-wheel disc brakes were eliminated on the sedan; station wagons retained four-wheel disc brakes.

The 2002 Sable included extra equipment on every trim level, including a CD player and power driver&#x27;s seat on the GS, and a power moonroof or leather interior on the LS. Side airbags and traction control were added as options on all models. For 2004, the Sable received minor cosmetic changes to the front and rear fascias; most noticeably, the grille was made fully chrome. Inside were a new instrument cluster and steering wheel.

Due to the Mercury brand&#x27;s discontinuation in Canada, the fourth generation Sable was never available in the Canadian market; thus, it was unique to the U.S. and Mexico.

The 2005 Mercury Montego and 2006 Milan were launched as replacements for the Sable. Shortly after the Montego&#x27;s introduction the Sable was discontinued, along with the Taurus wagon; the Taurus sedan continued to be produced, but primarily for the fleet market. The last Sable left the Atlanta plant on April 29, 2005.

=== Models ===

==Fifth generation (2008–2009)==

The fifth-generation Mercury Sable was launched for the 2008 model year. Developed as a mid-cycle update of the Mercury Montego, the production vehicle revived the more widely-recognized Sable nameplate at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show. While the 2008 revival of the Ford Taurus (renaming the Five Hundred) largely ended retail sale of the Crown Victoria, the Sable remained below the Grand Marquis in the Mercury range. 

While approximately 10 inches shorter and 500 pounds lighter than the Grand Marquis, the fifth-generation Sable was the first produced as a full-size car. For the first time, the model line was offered exclusively as a four-door sedan (no Mercury counterpart of the Taurus X wagon was developed). Front-wheel drive remained standard, with all-wheel drive becoming an option for the first time. 

In the transition from the Montego to the Sable, a number of changes were made to the body and chassis. Alongside the addition of the 263 hp 3.5L V6 and 6-speed 6F automatic, the exterior underwent several revisions, including a revised front bumper and grille, redesigned headlamps; the LED taillamps were retained, but given white lenses. The fifth-generation Sable adopted the trim lines of the Montego and Milan, with an unnamed standard trim level and a top Premier trim. 

===Water pump issues===
Water pumps on the 2008 and 2009 Mercury Sable equipped with the 3.5 L Ford Cyclone V6 have a tendency to fail and potentially ruin the engine when they do. The water pumps on these engines are internally mounted and driven by the timing chain. As a result, when they fail, antifreeze is dumped directly into the crankcase; mixing with engine oil and potentially damaging the head gaskets and connecting rod bearings. These water pump failures could occur without warning, and repair could require engine disassembly or removal to access the water pump, or in some cases, engine replacement. A class action lawsuit was filed against Ford as a result of this issue.

===Models===
==Special editions==
A few rare special editions of the Sable were made, all consisting of first generation models.

During MY 1987, Mercury introduced a special edition of the Sable called the &quot;LS Monochrome Edition,&quot; which as an option would color the bumpers, side trim, and wheels white. It was only offered during MY 1987; the production quantity is not known and it is also unknown how many still exist.

During MY 1989, Mercury created a &quot;50th Anniversary&quot; edition of the Sable, to celebrate Mercury&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Keeping with the name, only 50 were sold, combined between GS and LS models. This Sable was actually a test bed for creating a luxury sport version of the Sable called the LTS, similar to that of the Ford Taurus SHO. It was meant to use the SHO&#x27;s chassis, interior, and suspension, but not the engine. After the launch of the SHO, and all the publicity and praise it received, Ford shelved the Sable LTS to focus on the SHO, and because it feared it would cannibalize sales of the SHO. The Sable LTS remained in a &quot;development hell&quot; until mid-1994 when it was introduced as a high end version of the Sable, but by then, it was just a highly optioned LS. An unknown number of these Sables still exist, but a pristine condition GS in this trim was sold on eBay in 2007.

A special one-of-a-kind Sable convertible was created in 1987 for the 1988 Detroit SAE auto show. It was built from a sedan chassis and featured a completely custom two-door body with a custom folding top. However, it was shelved; the only one sat in a warehouse for years until it was given a VIN, titled, and driven. It was sold on eBay in 2006.

<doc id="894250" wikidata="Q1526584" url="?curid=894250" title="Orthopedic cast">
<text>Orthopedic casts or just casts are a form of medical treatment used to immobilize and support bones and soft tissues during the healing process after fractures, surgeries, or severe injuries. By restricting movement, casts provide stability to the affected area, enabling proper alignment and healing of bones, ligaments, and tendons. They are commonly applied to the limbs but can also be used for the trunk, neck, or other parts of the body in specific cases. Orthopedic casts come in various types and designs, tailored to the nature and severity of the injury, as well as the patient&#x27;s needs. Advances in medical techniques have made casts more comfortable, effective, and versatile, allowing for both weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing options.

==Upper extremity casts==

Upper extremity casts are frequently utilized to immobilize the arm, wrist, or hand for the treatment of fractures, soft tissue injuries, or during post-surgical recovery. They offer stabilization and support, aiding in proper healing while minimizing the risk of further injury. Common types include long arm casts, short arm casts, and specialized versions such as thumb spica casts.

===Long arm casts===
A long arm cast extends from the upper arm to the wrist or hand, immobilizing the elbow joint in addition to the forearm. It is typically used for injuries requiring stabilization across multiple joints, such as forearm fractures, certain elbow injuries, and complex soft-tissue damage. It is usually insured that the elbow remains immobilized in a slightly flexed position, usually around 90 degrees, to promote healing while maintaining comfort. Patients with long arm casts often require close monitoring for swelling and circulation issues, given the cast’s extensive coverage.

===Short arm casts===
A short arm cast is designed to immobilize the wrist and part of the forearm, extending from below the elbow to the hand, often leaving the fingers free for limited mobility. It is used to treat less severe injuries, such as wrist fractures, sprains, or carpal bone issues. The cast restricts wrist movement while allowing elbow mobility, providing a balance between immobilization and functionality. In some cases, a thumb spica variant is added to include the thumb in immobilization, such as for scaphoid fractures or severe thumb sprains. Proper fit and careful alignment are critical to ensure effective healing and prevent complications.

==Lower extremity==
Leg casts are designed to immobilize the lower limb, facilitating the healing process for fractures, ligament injuries, or post-surgical repairs. They provide stability to the affected area, helping to alleviate pain and prevent additional damage. The design of leg casts can vary to cater to specific injuries, from simple foot fractures to more complicated multi-joint issues. The most common types of lower extremity casts include, long leg casts, Short leg casts. Different varieties exist between the two main types.

===Long leg casts===

A long leg cast extends from the upper thigh to the toes, immobilizing the knee joint as well as the lower leg and ankle. It is typically used for injuries requiring stabilization across multiple joints, such as tibial or fibular fractures, severe knee injuries, or post-surgical recovery. It is ensured that the knee remains immobilized in a slightly flexed position, typically around 20-35 degrees, to promote healing while maintaining comfort. Patients with long leg casts often require close monitoring for swelling, circulation issues, and mobility challenges due to the cast’s extensive coverage.

===Short leg casts===
The short leg cast is designed to immobilize the lower leg and ankle, extending from just below the knee to the toes. It is used to treat less severe injuries, such as ankle fractures, foot fractures, or severe sprains. The cast restricts ankle movement while allowing knee mobility. In some cases, a toe plate is added to a short leg cast to provide additional protection for toe injuries or fractures. The toe plate is an extension of the cast that covers the toes, shielding them from external forces and reducing the risk of further injury during recovery. It also helps maintain proper alignment of the toes, preventing displacement of fractured bones or soft tissue damage. Toe plates are particularly useful for injuries where direct impact or accidental movement could hinder healing, such as complex fractures or severe soft tissue injuries in the toes.

===Ambulation===
When a patient is advised not to put weight on an injured limb, mobility aids like crutches, walkers, or wheelchairs can be used to help with movement during the recovery process. These aids protect the injured area while allowing the patient to move around safely. For those who cannot use crutches due to balance or strength challenges, a wheelchair or knee scooter might be suggested as a more stable mobility option. In certain situations, partial weight-bearing may be permitted, and specialized footwear can be fitted over the cast for added support. For leg casts that allow weight-bearing, the under-sole is usually reinforced to evenly distribute pressure and minimize strain on the injury. Walking casts, as they are called, come with a hard, flat sole to aid in walking while ensuring proper alignment and stability. Other alternative for ambulation with an injured leg include using an

==Specialized and rarely used casts==
===Cylinder===
Cylinder casts are orthopedic devices used to immobilize the arm or leg while leaving the surrounding joints free, providing focused stabilization to specific regions. In the arm, a cylinder cast typically extends from the upper arm to just above the wrist, stabilizing injuries like isolated humeral fractures or post-surgical repairs that do not require elbow immobilization. For the leg, the cast extends from the thigh to just above the ankle, often used to manage patellar fractures, some types of tibial plateau injuries, or post-operative care following knee surgeries. The application involves precise alignment to maintain proper positioning of the affected area while ensuring adjacent joints remain mobile, allowing for some functional movement and reducing stiffness during recovery.

===Body===
Body casts, also known as full-body casts are devices designed to immobilize the trunk of the body, sometimes extending to the neck, head, or extremities. They are less commonly used today due to advances in less restrictive bracing systems and surgical techniques but remain crucial in specific cases where maximum immobilization is essential. Body casts are often used in pediatric patients, particularly young children, who may struggle to comply with wearing a back brace consistently. They are also employed after radical surgeries to repair spinal injuries, congenital deformities, or significant trauma to the spine, pelvis, or upper thigh.

A common variant, the body jacket, encases the trunk and includes shoulder straps to provide added stabilization, particularly for injuries involving the thoracic or lumbar spine. These casts are meticulously shaped to maintain spinal alignment and prevent movement that could disrupt healing. Despite their efficacy, body casts can be extremely uncomfortable due to their restrictive nature and the challenges they pose for hygiene and mobility. In some cases, openings or windows are incorporated into the cast to allow access for wound care or medical monitoring.

===EDF cast===
An EDF (elongation, derotation, flexion) cast is a specialized orthopedic device used in the treatment of Infantile Idiopathic Scoliosis. This method of correction was pioneered by UK scoliosis specialist Min Mehta and is a non-surgical approach designed to guide spinal growth and alignment during a critical developmental period. Scoliosis is a three-dimensional spinal deformity requiring correction in all planes—coronal, sagittal, and axial—and EDF casting addresses these complex needs. By employing traction, the EDF method elongates the spine, derotates the vertebrae and pelvis, and improves lordosis and overall body alignment, significantly enhancing the patient’s posture and physical function.

The EDF casting technique is distinct from Risser casting in its design and application. EDF casts are tailored to each child’s anatomy, with configurations either over or under the shoulder, depending on the curve pattern and severity. A key feature is the large mushroom-shaped opening on the front, which facilitates proper chest expansion and breathing. On the back, a small cutout is strategically placed on the concave side of the curve, stopping at the midline. This cutout has been shown to improve rotational correction and enhance spinal alignment compared to casts without it. The combination of elongation, derotation, and flexion in this casting method offers an effective early intervention to correct scoliosis and guide proper spinal development.

===Spica cast===
A spica cast encases the trunk of the body and one or more limbs, providing immobilization for injuries or conditions requiring stabilization across multiple joints. Spica casts can be used for both upper and lower extremities. For instance, a shoulder spica covers the trunk of the body and one arm, typically extending to the wrist or hand. These casts were once common for severe shoulder injuries but are rarely used today, as specialized splints and slings have largely replaced them, promoting early mobility to prevent joint stiffness during recovery.

A hip spica cast, by contrast, is used to immobilize the trunk and one or more legs. Variants include the single hip spica, which covers the trunk and one leg down to the ankle or foot; the double hip spica, which covers the trunk and both legs; and the one-and-a-half hip spica, which encases one leg fully and the other only to above the knee. The extent of trunk coverage depends on the specific injury or condition and the surgeon’s preference, ranging from the navel for spinal mobility to as high as the rib cage or armpits in rare cases. Hip spicas are commonly used to maintain reduction of femoral fractures, treat congenital hip dislocations in infants, and stabilize the hips and pelvis after surgery.

In some cases, a spica cast may not fully encase the legs, extending only to above the knee. These casts, known as pantaloon casts, are occasionally used to immobilize the lumbar spine or pelvis. When applied for such injuries, the trunk portion of the cast typically extends to the armpits to ensure adequate stabilization.
==Hygiene==
Maintaining proper hygiene while wearing a cast is crucial to ensure patient comfort, prevent skin irritation, and reduce the risk of infection. Since casts are often made of non-breathable materials and remain in place for weeks, they can create an environment prone to moisture buildup, which can lead to odors, skin irritation, or fungal growth. Patients are advised to keep the cast completely dry, as moisture can weaken the cast material and compromise its integrity. Waterproof covers or plastic bags secured with elastic can be used during bathing to protect the cast, but immersing the cast in water should always be avoided unless it is specifically designed to be waterproof.

To maintain hygiene around the cast, patients should clean and moisturize the exposed skin near the cast edges, being cautious not to let any liquids seep inside. A damp cloth with mild soap can be used for cleaning, followed by gentle drying. Avoid inserting objects, such as sticks or sharp items, into the cast to alleviate itching, as this can cause skin abrasions or damage the cast lining. If itching becomes unbearable or if there is persistent discomfort, a healthcare provider should be consulted rather than attempting to adjust the cast.

For long-term casts, regular inspections by a medical professional are recommended to ensure the skin underneath remains healthy and the cast fits properly. Unpleasant odors, excessive itching, or discharge from the cast are potential signs of an infection or skin breakdown, requiring immediate medical attention. Maintaining proper cast hygiene not only contributes to physical comfort but also supports a safe and successful healing process.

==Casting materials==

Casts typically come in two main types of material, fiberglass, and plaster, though it is less common. Plaster casts have several limitations, including weight, which restricts movement, and skin complications such as dryness, itching, rashes, and infections, particularly in hot weather. Plaster can also break down if exposed to moisture. The cast removal process, which involves a noisy oscillating saw, can cause distress, especially in children, though it is generally painless. Due to these drawbacks, fiberglass casts were developed in the 1970s, offering a lighter, more durable, and water-resistant alternative, though they still have limitations in terms of skin irritation and moisture management.

===Plaster casts===

Plaster casts consist of a cotton bandage that has been combined with plaster of paris, which hardens after it has been made wet. Plaster of Paris is calcined gypsum (roasted gypsum), ground to a fine powder by milling. When water is added, the more soluble form of calcium sulfate returns to the relatively insoluble form, and heat is produced.

:2 (CaSO4·½ H2O) + 3 H2O → 2 (CaSO4.2H2O) + Heat

The setting of unmodified plaster starts about 10 minutes after mixing and is complete in about 45 minutes; however, the cast is not fully dry for 72 hours.
===Fiberglass casts===

Bandages of synthetic materials are also used—often knitted fiberglass bandages impregnated with polyurethane, sometimes bandages of thermoplastic. These are lighter and dry much faster than plaster bandages. However, plaster can be more easily moulded to make a snug and therefore more comfortable fit. In addition, plaster is much smoother and does not snag clothing or abrade the skin.

=== Cast liner ===
Traditional cast liners are made from cotton or synthetic materials, which help absorb sweat and keep the skin dry. However, in modern casting, fiberglass or polyester liners are often used, offering greater durability and comfort. Some liners are specifically designed to be waterproof, allowing patients to bathe or swim while wearing their casts. These waterproof liners are typically made from materials like polyurethane or special synthetic fibers that prevent water from seeping into the cast. While waterproof liners offer significant convenience, they may increase the application time and cost of the cast
=== Washable casts ===
There are some washable casts like FlexiOH which provide good ventilation and maintain good skin hygiene. With this cast, patients are able to bathe and go out in the rain. These types of casts have advantages that deliver patients a better treatment than conventional casts made of plaster of Paris or Fiberglass. They are the next generation of orthopedic immobilization photo-curing specialty-resin technology that enables a waterproof, washable, lightweight, strong and comfortable way of recovering from fractures.
==Alternative methods of immobilization==

Alternative immobilization techniques offer non-cast methods for stabilizing injuries, providing options that may be more comfortable, adjustable, or suitable for specific conditions. While traditional casts are commonly used for fractures and soft tissue injuries, alternatives are increasingly being utilized to address various patient needs and preferences.

One prominent alternative is the splint, which is often used for fractures that are not as severe or when a temporary immobilization method is required. Splints are typically made from materials like fiberglass, aluminum, or plastic and are easier to apply and adjust than casts. They can be used for injuries like sprains, minor fractures, or post-surgical stabilization. Unlike casts, splints are generally open on one or both sides, allowing for adjustments as swelling fluctuates during the healing process. They also provide more flexibility and can be removed for hygiene or rehabilitation purposes.

Orthopedic brace are another alternative, commonly used for joint injuries or soft tissue sprains and strains. Braces provide support and stabilize joints like the knee, ankle, or wrist. They are often used for conditions such as ligament sprains, tendinitis, or as post-operative support. Braces are usually made of fabric, neoprene, or metal components, allowing for greater mobility and easier removal compared to casts. They can be particularly useful for injuries that require gradual rehabilitation and controlled movement.

For certain types of fractures or injuries, Traction (orthopedics) is an effective immobilization method. Traction involves using a pulling force to align bones and reduce fractures, particularly in cases involving the spine, pelvis, or long bones. It can be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including skin traction (using adhesive materials attached to the skin) or skeletal traction (which involves pins or wires placed directly into the bone). Traction helps maintain the correct alignment and promotes healing without the need for a cast, especially in more complex fractures.

In cases where the injury requires complete immobilization but not the rigidity of a cast, an orthopedic boot, also known as a CAM boot (controlled ankle motion) may be used, especially for foot or ankle injuries. These options are designed to protect the injured area while still allowing limited mobility. Orthopedic boots are often preferred in weight-bearing fractures, as they provide stability while allowing the patient to walk with crutches or other mobility aids.
==Removal==

Casts are typically removed by perforation using a cast saw, an oscillating saw designed to cut rigid material such as plaster or fiberglass while not harming soft tissue. Manually operated shears, patented in 1950 by Neil McKay, may be used on pediatric or other patients who may be affected by the noise of the saw.

==History==

The earliest methods of holding a reduced fracture involved using splints. These are rigid strips laid parallel to each other alongside the bone. The Ancient Egyptians used wooden splints made of bark wrapped in linen. They also used stiff bandages for support that were probably derived from embalming techniques. The use of plaster of Paris to cover walls is evident, but it seems it was never used for bandages. Ancient Hindus treated fractures with bamboo splints, and the writings of Hippocrates discuss management of fractures in some detail, recommending wooden splints plus exercise to prevent muscle atrophy during the immobilization. The ancient Greeks also used waxes and resins to create stiffened bandages and the Roman Celsus, writing in AD 30, describes how to use splints and bandages stiffened with starch. Arabian doctors used lime derived from sea shells and albumen from egg whites to stiffen bandages. The Italian School of Salerno in the twelfth century recommended bandages hardened with a flour and egg mixture as did medieval European bonesetters, who used casts made of egg white, flour, and animal fat. By the sixteenth century the famous French surgeon Ambroise Paré (1517–1590), who championed more humane treatments in medicine and promoted the use of artificial limbs, made casts of wax, cardboard, cloth, and parchment that hardened as they dried.

These methods all had merit, but the standard method for the healing of fractures was bed rest and restriction of activity. The search for a simpler, less-time-consuming, method led to the development of the first modern occlusive dressings, stiffened at first with starch and later with plaster-of-paris. The ambulatory treatment of fractures was the direct result of these innovations. The innovation of the modern cast can be traced to, among others, four military surgeons, Dominique Jean Larrey, Louis Seutin, Antonius Mathijsen, and Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov.

Dominique Jean Larrey (1768–1842) was born in a small town in southern France. He first studied medicine with his uncle, a surgeon in Toulouse. After a short tour of duty as a naval surgeon, he returned to Paris, where he became caught up in the turmoil of the French Revolution, being present at the Storming of the Bastille. From then on, he made his career as a surgeon in France&#x27;s revolutionary and Napoleonic armies, which he accompanied throughout Europe and the Middle East. As a result, Larrey accumulated a vast experience of military medicine and surgery.
One of his patients after the Battle of Borodino in 1812 was an infantry officer whose arm was amputated at the shoulder. The patient was evacuated immediately following the operation and passed from Russia, through Poland and Germany. When the dressing was removed on his arrival home in France, the wound had healed. Larrey concluded that the fact that the wound had been undisturbed had facilitated healing. After the war, Larrey began stiffening bandages using camphorated alcohol, lead acetate and egg whites beaten in water.

An improved method was introduced by Louis Seutin, (1793–1865) of Brussels. In 1815 Seutin had served in the allied armies in the war against Napoleon and was on the field of Waterloo. At the time of the development of his bandage he was chief surgeon in the Belgium army. Seutin&#x27;s &quot;bandage amidonnee&quot; consisted of cardboard splints and bandages soaked in a solution of starch and applied wet. These dressings required 2 to 3 days to dry, depending on the temperature and humidity of the surroundings. The substitution of Dextrin for starch, advocated by Velpeau, the man widely regarded as the leading French surgeon at the beginning of the 19th century, reduced the drying time to 6 hours. Although this was a vast improvement, it was still a long time, especially in the harsh environment of the battlefield.

A good description of Seutin&#x27;s technique was provided by Sampson Gamgee who learned it from Seutin in France during the winter of 1851–52 and went on to promote its use in Britain. The limb was initially wrapped in wool, especially over any bony prominences. Pasteboard was then cut into shape to provide a splint, and dampened so it could be molded to the limb. The limb was then wrapped in bandages before a starch coating was applied to the outer surface. Seutin&#x27;s technique for the application of the starch apparatus formed the basis of the technique used with plaster of Paris dressings today. The use of this method led to the early mobilization of patients with fractures and a marked reduction in hospital time required.

===Plaster casts===
Although these bandages were an improvement over Larrey&#x27;s method, they were far from ideal. They required a long time to apply and dry and there was often shrinkage and distortion. A great deal of interest had been aroused in Europe around 1800 by a British diplomat, consul William Eton, who described a method of treating fractures that he had observed in Turkey. He noted that gypsum plaster (plaster of Paris) was moulded around the patient&#x27;s leg to cause immobilization. If the cast became loose due to atrophy or a reduction in swelling, then additional gypsum plaster was added to fill the space. Adapting the use of plaster of Paris for use in hospitals, however, took some time. In 1828, doctors in Berlin were treating leg fractures by aligning the bones in a long narrow box, which they filled with moist sand. Substitution of plaster of Paris for the sand was the next logical step. Such plaster casts did not succeed however as the patient was confined to bed due to the casts being heavy and cumbersome.

Plaster of Paris bandages were introduced in different forms by two army surgeons, one at a peacetime home station and another on active service at the front. Antonius Mathijsen (1805–1878) was born in Budel, the Netherlands, where his father was the village doctor. He was educated in Brussels, Maastricht and Utrecht obtaining the degree of doctor of medicine at Gissen in 1837. He spent his entire career as a medical officer in the Dutch Army. While he was stationed at Haarlem in 1851, he developed a method of applying plaster of Paris bandages. A brief note describing his method was published on January 30, 1852; it was followed shortly by more complete accounts. In these accounts Mathijsen emphasised that only simple materials were required and the bandage could be quickly applied without assistance. The bandages hardened rapidly, provided an exact fit and could be windowed or bivalved (cut to provide strain relief) easily. Mathijsen used coarsely woven materials, usually linen, into which dry plaster of Paris had been rubbed thoroughly. The bandages were then moistened with a wet sponge or brush as they were applied and rubbed by hand until they hardened.

Plaster of Paris dressings were first employed in the treatment of mass casualties in the 1850s during the Crimean War by Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov (1810–1881). Pirogov was born in Moscow and received his early education there. After obtaining a medical degree at Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia) he studied at Berlin and Göttingen before returning to Dorpat as a professor of Surgery. In 1840, he became the professor of surgery at the academy of military medicine in St. Petersburg. Pirogov introduced the use of ether anaesthesia to Russia and made important contributions to the study of cross-sectional human anatomy. With the help of his patron, the grand duchess Helene Pavlovna, he introduced female nurses into the military hospitals at the same time that Florence Nightingale was beginning a similar program in British military hospitals.

Seutin had travelled through Russia demonstrating his &#x27;starched bandage&#x27;, and his technique had been adopted by both the Russian army and navy by 1837. Pirogov had observed the use of plaster of Paris bandages in the studio of a sculptor who used strips of linen soaked in liquid plaster of Paris for making models (this technique, called &quot;modroc,&quot; is still popular). Pirogov went on to develop his own methods, although he was aware of Mathijsen&#x27;s work. Pirogov&#x27;s method involved soaking coarse cloth in a plaster of Paris mixture immediately before application to the limbs, which were protected either by stockings or cotton pads. Large dressings were reinforced with pieces of wood.

As time passed and the method moved more into the mainstream some disagreement arose as to the problems associated with cutting off air to skin contact, and also some improvements were made. Eventually Pirogov&#x27;s method gave way to Mathijsen&#x27;s. Among the improvements suggested as early as 1860 was that of making the dressing resistant to water by painting the dried plaster of Paris with a mixture of shellac dissolved in alcohol. The first commercial bandages were not produced until 1931 in Germany, and were called Cellona. Before that the bandages were made by hand at the hospitals.

As a plaster cast is applied, it expands by approximately 0.5%. The less water used, the more linear expansion occurs. Potassium sulfate can be used as an accelerator and sodium borate as a retarder to control setting time.

<text>Castres (; &quot;Castras&quot; in the Languedocian dialect of Occitan) is the sole subprefecture of the Tarn department in the Occitanie region in Southern France. It lies in the former province of Languedoc, although not in the former region of Languedoc-Roussillon. In 2018, the commune had a population of 41,795.

Castres is the fourth-largest industrial centre of the predominantly rural former Midi-Pyrénées region after Toulouse, Tarbes and Albi, as well as the largest in the part of Languedoc lying between Toulouse and Montpellier. It is noted for being the birthplace of the famous socialist leader Jean Jaurès (1859–1914) and home to the important Goya Museum of Spanish painting.

==Demographics==
In 1831, the population of Castres was 12,032, making it the largest town of the department of Tarn. One of the few industrial towns in the region of Albigeois, the population of the commune proper grew to 19,483 in 1901, and 34,126 by 1954. However, with the decline of its industries, population growth diminished. Albi surpassed Castres as the most populous metropolitan area of Tarn. The population of Castres reached its peak in 1975, after that it has been decreasing slowly. Castres is the centre of a functional urban area with 104,695 inhabitants (2019).

==Geography==
Castres is located at an altitude of above sea level. It is located south-southeast of Albi, the (capital) of Tarn, and east of Toulouse, the capital of Occitania. Castres is intersected from north to south by the rivers Agout and Durenque.

The Thoré forms most of the commune&#x27;s south-eastern border, then flows into the Agout, which forms part of its western border.

==Administration==
Between 1790 and 1797 Castres was the prefecture of Tarn.

Since 2001, the mayor of Castres has been Pascal Bugis (right, member of UMP), who defeated the then socialist mayor in the 2001 election after a campaign focused on the bad records of the socialist mayor on fighting crime, and the high level of insecurity in the town.

Castres has teamed up with the nearby town of Mazamet ( southeast of Castres) and the independent suburbs and villages in between to create the &quot;communauté d&#x27;agglomération de Castres Mazamet&quot;, which was established in December 1999. The &quot;communauté d&#x27;agglomération&quot; groups 14 independent communes (including Castres and Mazamet), with a total population of 78,101 inhabitants (2018), 54% of these living in the commune of Castres proper, 13% in the commune of Mazamet, and the rest in the communes in between.

The &quot;communauté d&#x27;agglomération&quot; was created in order to better coordinate transport, infrastructure, housing, and economic policies between the communes of the area. The current president of the &quot;communauté d&#x27;agglomération&quot; is Pascal Bugis, mayor of Castres.

==History==

The name of the town comes from Latin &quot;castrum&quot;, and means &quot;fortified place&quot;. Castres grew up round the Benedictine abbey of Saint Benoît, which is believed to have been founded in AD 647, possibly on the site of an old Roman fort (&quot;castrum&quot;). Castres became an important stop on the international pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela in Spain because its abbey-church, built in the 9th century, was keeping the relics of Saint Vincent, the renowned martyr of Spain. It was a place of some importance as early as the 12th century, and ranked as the second town of the Albigeois behind Albi. Despite the decline of its abbey, which in 1074 came under the authority of Saint Victor abbey in Marseille, Castres was granted a liberal charter in the 12th century by the famous Trencavel family, viscounts of Albi. Resulting from the charter, Castres was ruled by a college of consuls.

During the Albigensian Crusade it surrendered of its own accord to Simon de Montfort, and thus entered into the kingdom of France in 1229. In 1317, Pope John XXII established the bishopric of Castres. In 1356, the town of Castres was raised to a countship by King John II of France. However, the town greatly suffered from the Black Plague in 1347-1348, then from the Black Prince of England and the Free Companies (bands of lawless mercenaries) who laid waste the country during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Consequently, by the late 14th century Castres entered a period of sharp decline. In 1375, there were only 4,000 inhabitants left in town, only half the figure from a century before. Following the confiscation of the possessions of Jacques d&#x27;Armagnac, duke of Nemours, to which the countship of Castres had passed, it was bestowed in 1476 by King Louis XI on Boffille de Juge (Boffillo del Giudice), an Italian nobleman and adventurer serving as a diplomat for Louis XI, but the appointment led to so much disagreement (family feud between Boffille de Juge, his only daughter, and his brother-in-law) that the countship was united to the crown by King Francis I in 1519.

Around 1560, the majority of the population of Castres converted to Protestantism. In the wars of the latter part of the 16th century the inhabitants sided with the Protestant party, fortified the town, and established an independent republic. Castres was one of the largest Protestant strongholds in southern France, along with Montauban and La Rochelle. Henry of Navarre, leader of the Protestant party, who later became King Henry IV of France, stayed in Castres in 1585. The Protestants of Castres were brought to terms, however, by King Louis XIII in 1629, and Richelieu came himself to Castres to have its fortifications dismantled. Nonetheless, after these religious wars, the town, now in peace, enjoyed a period of rapid expansion. Business and traditional commercial activities revived, in particular fur and leather-dressing, tanning, and above all wool trade. Culture flourished anew, with the founding of the Academy of Castres in 1648. Castres was turned by the Catholic Church into an active center of Counter-Reformation, with the establishments of several convents in town, and the building of a renowned bishop&#x27;s palace by Mgr. Tubœuf, still the most famous monument in town today. A new cathedral was also built, after the destructions of the religious wars. Perhaps even more important, Castres was made the seat of the &quot;Chambre de l&#x27;Édit&quot; of the Parliament of Toulouse, a court of justice detached from the Parliament of Toulouse and in charge of dealing with the cases involving the Protestants of Languedoc, a measure of protection granted to them by the Edict of Nantes. This court attracted much business to Castres. In 1665, there were 7,000 inhabitants in Castres, 4,000 of whom Catholic, and 3,000 Protestant.

In 1670 however, the &quot;Chambre de l&#x27;Édit&quot; was transferred to Castelnaudary, much to the discontent of even the catholic citizens of Castres, who lost a major source of business and revenue with the departure of the lawyers and the plaintiffs. The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes soon followed, and Castres suffered greatly when many Protestants chose to go into exile. Then came the plague of 1720-1721 and the fire of 1724. Last but not least, Castres lost its liberal charter in 1758. In the 1760s, a few years after the famous Calas Affair in Toulouse, Castres made the headlines nationwide: Pierre-Paul Sirven and his wife, both Protestants, were wrongly accused of having murdered their daughter in order to prevent her from converting to Catholicism. Tried and sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; on March 29, 1764, they were defended by Voltaire, and eventually exonerated in 1771.

The outbreak of the French Revolution was generally welcomed in Castres, particularly among the local Protestant merchants and entrepreneurs, but the majority of the population remained moderate during the whole period. In 1793 for instance, Protestant pastor Alba La Source, Castres&#x27; representative at the Convention in Paris, opposed the deportation of &quot;non-juror&quot; Catholic priests to French Guiana, where death in the horrid jungle was certain (see Civil Constitution of the Clergy). &quot;Non-juror&quot; priests were by far the majority in the region of Castres. Accused of being a moderate, Alba La Source was guillotined in October 1793. Suspected of being lukewarm toward the revolution, Castres was duly chastised. The bishopric which had been established by Pope John XXII in 1317 was abolished, Castres later becoming part of the bishopric of Albi. Capital of the &#x27; of Tarn in 1790, the town was downgraded to capital of an arrondissement in 1797, Albi being made the capital of the &#x27;.

Despite these setbacks, in the 19th century the economy of Castres developed greatly, and the town grew outside of its old medieval center. As early as 1815, the first mechanized wool mill was set up in town. Originally specialized in luxury cloth, the Castres textile industry then turned toward more ordinary types of cloth, whose markets were considerably larger. Around 1860, there were 50 wool mills in town, employing 3,000 people. In the end of the 19th century, mechanical engineering industries appeared beside the textile industry, which led to Castres becoming a major arsenal for the French army during the First World War. Castres was linked to the French railway network in 1865. At the end of the 19th century, Castres was the largest town in the &quot;&quot; of Tarn, with 5,000 more inhabitants than Albi.

However, in the 20th century the town entered a new period of decline. Although Castres emerged from the two world wars unscathed, no military operations or combats taking place in southwest France, the local economy has been hard hit by change. Like so many towns and cities of Europe which had benefited most from the Industrial Revolution, Castres is experiencing a difficult restructuring of its industrial base. Textile has particularly suffered. Castres is also crippled by its geographical location, isolated in a dead end at the foot of the Massif Central mountains, away from the main exchange and transport routes. Castres is still not connected to the motorway (freeway) network of France, the only town of that size in France not yet connected. The creation of the Greater Castres-Mazamet Council in 2000 was expected to deal with the transport problem, and to work on attracting new industries. The good fortune of Castres is to be located only away from the very dynamic Toulouse. The long-promised motorway link with Toulouse is due to be completed soon, and Castres hopes to benefit from its proximity with the big Occitan city.

==Economy==
The principal industries are mechanical and electrical engineering, machine tools, wooden furniture, granite, textile, fur and leather-dressing, tanning, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and selective breeding of cows.

Traditional and polluting industries such as textile, tanning, fur and leather-dressing, or chemicals, are in sharp decline. However, a multinational pharmaceutical group (Pierre Fabre Group) emerged in the town in the 1960s, and it has kept its headquarters and R&amp;D division in the metropolitan area, helping to counterbalance the general decline in industry. Some now accuse its founder and president, Pierre Fabre, of being the real &quot;master&quot; of Castres, making and designating Castres&#x27; mayors at will.

===Transport===

The Gare de Castres railway station is served by regional trains to Mazamet and Toulouse.

Castres is intersected from north to south by the river Agout. The river is fringed by old houses the upper stories of which project over its waters.

The church of Saint Benoît, once the cathedral of Castres, and the most important of the churches of Castres today, dates only from the 17th and 18th centuries. The city hall occupies the former bishop&#x27;s palace, designed in the 17th century by Jules Hardouin-Mansart (the architect of Versailles), and with gardens designed by André Le Nôtre (the designer of the gardens in Versailles). The Romanesque tower beside it (&quot;Tour Saint Benoît&quot;) is the only survival of the old Benedictine abbey. The town possesses some old mansions from the 16th and 17th century, including the &quot;Hôtel de Nayrac&quot;, of the Renaissance.

Castres possesses the renowned Goya Museum, created in 1840, which contains the largest collection of Spanish paintings in France. A Jaurès Museum was also opened in 1954 in the house where Jean Jaurès was born in 1859.

The Jardin botanique Pierre Fabre &quot;La Michonne&quot; is a private botanical garden and conservatory that can be visited.

<text>The Mob is an English anarcho-punk band, formed in Yeovil, Somerset in the late 1970s.

== Background ==
The band&#x27;s initial line-up consisted of Mark Wilson (vocals, guitar), Curtis Youé (bass guitar) and Graham Fallows (drums). Later drummers included Adie Tompkins, Tim Hutton and Joseph Porter. The Mob disbanded in 1983 and reformed in 2011, playing a number of gigs with the original members. The first was on 8 April 2011 at The Fleece in Bristol and later in the year, The Levellers&#x27; Beautiful Days Festival in Devon on 20 August. North American shows followed in October 2012, and various European gigs in 2012/13. Their first new release in almost 30 years was the single Rise Up! in August 2013. Further North American/European dates followed in 2014/15.

== All the Madmen Records == 
All the Madmen Records is a record label started by The Mob in Yeovil before Mark Wilson and Curtis Youé relocated to London in the early 1980s. Profits from the band&#x27;s &quot;Let the Tribe Increase&quot; LP were ploughed back into the label, co-organised by members of the collective that published the Kill Your Pet Puppy zine. Today, All the Madmen Records is housed in Rockaway Park, a commune based in Temple Cloud, Somerset.&lt;br&gt;All the buildings on the Rockaway Park grounds were designed and built by Mark Mob (Wilson) and contain large percentages of recycled materials that were sourced from various places.

== Reunion == 
The Mob reunited in 2011 with the band’s original line-up. Wilson had heard of a surprise party planned for his upcoming birthday that was to feature a (The Mob) cover band and decided he would rather perform himself. The original members of the band agreed to join him. Prior to this reunion Wilson stated that he had not touched a guitar in 20 years. After gigs around the UK the band played in various countries across Europe. A tour of the US and Canada followed in 2012 which included headlining the &#x27;Chaos in Tejas&#x27; festival in Austin, Texas.

<text>MedlinePlus is an online information service produced by the United States National Library of Medicine. The service provides curated consumer health information in English and Spanish with select content in additional languages.
The site brings together information from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), other U.S. government agencies, and health-related organizations. There is also a site optimized for display on mobile devices, in both English and Spanish. In 2015, about 400 million people from around the world used MedlinePlus. The service is funded by the NLM and is free to users.

MedlinePlus provides encyclopedic information on health and drug issues, and provides a directory of medical services. MedlinePlus Connect links patients or providers in electronic health record (EHR) systems to related MedlinePlus information on conditions or medications.

PubMed Health was another NLM site that offered consumer health information, in addition to information for health professionals. However, &quot;PubMed Health, a portal for systematic reviews as well as consumer health information, was discontinued on October 31, 2018. The same or similar content is being provided through other NLM resources, namely PubMed and Bookshelf (for systematic review content), and MedlinePlus (for consumer health information).&quot;

==History==
The National Library of Medicine has long provided programs and services for professional medical scientists and health care providers, including MEDLINE and the various services that access it, such as PubMed and Entrez. By the 1990s, more members of the general public were using these services as Internet access became widespread. But nonprofessional users could benefit from reliable health information in a layperson-accessible format. The National Library of Medicine introduced MedlinePlus in October 1998, to provide a non-commercial online service similar, for example, to the commercial WebMD. In 2010 another NCBI service, PubMed Health, complemented MedlinePlus in offering curated consumer health information; PubMed Health focuses especially on finding information about clinical effectiveness of treatments.

MedlinePlus initially provided 22 health topics in English, which expanded to almost 1000 health topics in English and Spanish, plus links to health information in over 40 languages. MedlinePlus was recognized by the Medical Library Association for its role in providing health information. The site scored 84 in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for 2010.

In 2000s, A.D.A.M.&#x27;s medical encyclopedia was incorporated into MedlinePlus. The &quot;Animated Dissection of Anatomy for Medicine, Inc.&quot; is a NASDAQ-traded public company based in Atlanta, Georgia, that provides consumer health information and benefits technology products to healthcare organizations, employers, consumers, and educational institutions.

== Key features ==
The MedlinePlus website provides information in text-based webpages as well as in videos and tools. Other ways to access to access MedlinePlus content include MedlinePlus Mobile, which is a point-of-care tool for clinicians, and MedlinePlus Connect, which connects to Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

<doc id="894263" wikidata="Q7716237" url="?curid=894263" title="The Bedsitting Room (play)">
<text>The Bedsitting Room is a satirical play by Spike Milligan and John Antrobus. It began as a one-act play which was first produced on 12 February 1962 at the Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury, England. The Bedsitting Room was then adapted to a longer play and Bernard Miles put it on at the Mermaid Theatre, where it was first performed on 31 January 1963 before transferring several weeks later to the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End.

The production included a &quot;coup de théâtre&quot;, when the character &quot;Mate&quot; (originally played in London by Spike Milligan) entered wearing a mixture of ragged military uniforms from across the centuries. Attached to his boots were long strips of canvas to which were attached pairs of boots. As he marched across the stage, the empty boots marched in time behind him. The play was considered a critical and commercial hit, and was revived in 1967 with a provincial tour, before opening at London&#x27;s Saville Theatre on 3 May 1967. The script was later published in paperback book.

The play was presented in repertory by the Theatre Royal, York in 1972, and was also shown by Bench Theatre in Havant for seven nights in July 1981.

The play is set in a post-apocalyptic London, nine months after World War III (the &quot;Nuclear Misunderstanding&quot;), which lasted for two minutes and twenty-eight seconds – &quot;including the signing of the peace treaty&quot;. Nuclear fallout is producing strange mutations in people; the title refers to the character Lord Fortnum, who finds himself transforming into a bed-sitting room (other characters turn into a parrot and a wardrobe). The plot concerns the fate of the first child to be born after the war.

A film based on the play was released in 1969. The film was directed by Richard Lester and the cast included Ralph Richardson, Arthur Lowe, Rita Tushingham, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Michael Hordern, Marty Feldman, Harry Secombe and Milligan himself.

== Authors&#x27; intentions ==

In his 2002 book of reflections, Antrobus describes his idea as about &quot;a man who fears he will turn into a bedsitting room, which he does, and the dubious doctor he has been seeing moves in with his fiancée, declaring that it will be easier to work a cure on the premises. Therein lies the dilemma. For the doctor to heal the condition would mean becoming homeless&quot;.

In a 1988 interview with Bernard Braden on ITV&#x27;s &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot;, Milligan portrayed his view of &quot;The Bedsitting Room&quot; thus:

== Original cast list for play ==

The following is the original cast list as it appears on page 5 of the 1973 paperback of the script, with music played by The Temperance Seven.

*Captain Pontius Kak, Graham Stark. This is Lord Fortnum&#x27;s doctor, whose name appears to have later changed to Captain Martin. At one time Barry Humphries played this role, which he names as Captain Martin Bules.
*Lord Fortnum of Alamein, Valentine Dyall
*Mate/Arthur Scroake, Spike Milligan
*Shelter Man, John Bluthal
*Plastic Mac Man, John Bluthal
*Underwater Vicar, John Bluthal
*Brigadier/Sergeant, John Bluthal
*Chest of Drawers/Gladys Scroake, Marjie Lawrence
*Penelope, Marjie Lawrence
*Diplomat, Bob Todd
*First Announcer, Bob Todd
*Sea Captain, Bob Todd
*Second Announcer, Johnny Vyvyan
*Delivery Man/Chauffeur, Johnny Vyvyan
*Seaman, Johnny Vyvyan
*Coffin Man, Clive Elliott
*Pianist, Alan Chase
*Third Announcer, Bill Kerr
*Extras:
**Phantom
**Old Soldier
**Orderly
== Literary and dramatic counterparts ==

&quot;The Bedsitting Room&quot; can be compared with &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, in which Milligan and Secombe were involved, but with a savage, cynical and even more surreal edge, and an existential despair. It is widely cited that a critic described it as being &quot;like Samuel Beckett, but with better jokes&quot;, but this quote is never attributed to a particular author. However, in his review of the BFI&#x27;s DVD and Blu-ray release of the film in The Guardian, Phelim O&#x27;Neill says, &quot;It&#x27;s a bleak and funny mix of music hall gags and Samuel Beckett-style existentialism&quot;.

== Radio adaptation ==
A radio adaptation was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 26 December 2015 featuring Paul Merton, Derek Jacobi, Bernard Cribbins and Catherine Tate.

<text>Haymana is a municipality and district of Ankara Province, Turkey. Its area is 2,164 km2, and its population is 26,016 (2022). It is 72 km south of the capital, Ankara. Its elevation is 1200 m.

==Etymology==
According to the 1074-dated dictionary Dīwān ul-Lughat al-Turk, haymana means prairie in Turkish.

==History==
Archaeological excavations were launched in &quot;Gavur Kalesi&quot;, a castle situated in the village of Dereköy, in the years 1930 and 1998. The results showed that it was an important Phrygian settlement. Besides, the tumuli located in Türkhöyük and Oyaca villages prove that the area was also inhabited during the Hittite period.

After the periods of the Roman and Byzantine rule, the area was captured by the Seljuk Turks in 1127. After the Battle of Köse Dağ it came under Ilkhanate control for a while. In the mid 14th century the area was annexed by the Ottomans. After a brief period of Timurid rule in the wake of the Battle of Ankara in 1402, it was re-captured by the Ottomans.

<doc id="894284" wikidata="Q5223269" url="?curid=894284" title="Dark Horse Presents">
<text>Dark Horse Presents was a comic book published by Dark Horse Comics from 1986. Their first published series, it was their flagship title until its September 2000 cancellation. The second incarnation was published on MySpace, running from July 2007 until August 2010. A third incarnation began in April 2011, released in print form once again.

==Publishing history==
===First incarnation: Volume 1===
&quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; was conceived as an anthology title and was the first comic to be released by the newly formed Dark Horse Comics in 1986. The first issue featured &quot;Black Cross&quot; on the cover and featured the first appearance of Paul Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;Concrete&quot;. The title became successful thanks to the increasing popularity of &quot;Concrete&quot; which quickly became the regular cover feature for much of the first few years of the title.

&quot;Concrete&quot; eventually spun off into its own title, and this was something which would happen to several characters and stories appearing in &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot;. These included John Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Next Men&quot; comic book, as well as Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;Sin City&quot; stories, with the first &quot;Sin City&quot; story (later retitled &quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot;) being serialized within the pages of the comic. The title also contained stories featuring Dark Horse&#x27;s licensed comics, &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot;, as well as a &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; story.

&quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; was Dark Horse&#x27;s longest running title, and provided a mix of material from established and new creators. The title ended with issue #157 in September 2000.

Winner of the Eisner Award for &quot;Best Anthology&quot; - 1992, 1994

Winner of the Harvey Award for &quot;Best Anthology&quot; - 1992, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1998

===Second incarnation: MDHP===
&quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; was revived online through the social networking website MySpace. The first issue of &quot;MDHP&quot; featured new talents as well as well-known writers like Joss Whedon and Ron Marz. &quot;MDHP&quot; ran from August 2007 to July 2010, a total of thirty-six issues which were collected in six trade paperbacks.

===Third incarnation: Volume 2===
&quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; returned as an eighty-page anthology comic on April 20, 2011 with all-new stories including a &quot;Concrete&quot; story by Paul Chadwick, a &quot;Mr. Monster&quot; story by Michael T. Gilbert, a &quot;Crimson Empire&quot; story from the Star Wars universe, a new strip called &quot;Marked Man&quot; by Howard Chaykin, a strip called &quot;Blood&quot; by Neal Adams (his first work for Dark Horse), and a sneak peek of Frank Miller’s prequel to &quot;300&quot;, &quot;Xerxes&quot;. Two covers were available for the first issue, one featuring Concrete and the other featuring Xerxes. The new DHP has seen the revival of a number of older Dark Horse properties, including &quot;Ghost&quot; (leading to the launch of a new monthly title) and Ron Randall&#x27;s &quot;Trekker&quot;.

Dark Horse&#x27;s May 2014 solicitations for the 36th issue announced &quot;...Living legends Mike Mignola, Stan Sakai, and Jaime Hernandez all contribute to this final issue of Dark Horse Presents&quot;, although the following day Bleeding Cool reported this was merely the end of the comic in the eighty-page format, and it would return with fewer pages at a later date.

Winner of the Eisner Award for &quot;Best Anthology&quot; – 2012, 2013, 2014

Winner of the Harvey Award for &quot;Best Anthology&quot; – 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015

===Fourth Incarnation: Volume 3===
Beginning in August 2014, &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; returned as a forty-eight-page book. According to Dark Horse&#x27;s Mike Richardson: &quot;The main reason is that for three and a half years we&#x27;ve been producing eighty pages a month – that&#x27;s about ten different features – and it&#x27;s time to make it a little easier on ourselves&quot;. This volume ended in 2017 with issue 33.

<doc id="894287" wikidata="Q7372727" url="?curid=894287" title="Roy Dalgarno">
<text>Frederick Leslie Roy Dalgarno (2 December 1910 – 1 February 2001) was an Australian social realist artist.

==Early life, education and training==
Born in Melbourne, Victoria (Australia) in 1910, Dalgarno was educated at Ballarat Grammar School. From 1926 to 1930 he attended National Gallery Art School in Melbourne, where he met social realists Noel Counihan and Herbert McClintock. He then attended the Academy of Art under Dattilo Rubbo from 1930 to 1932. From 1932 to 1934 he attended East Sydney Technical College Painting &amp; Drawing. Later, between 1951 and 1953 he was at Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, including in 1951–52 William Hayter’s Atelier 17 (etching). In 1980 he studied etching and collography at the Pratt Graphic Centre, New York.

==Career==
He joined the Communist Party of Australia in the 1930s but, according to art historian Bernard Smith, his bohemian temperament was incompatible with party puritanism. He left the party in 1949. In the late 1930s he travelled to the canefields of North Queensland, where he concentrated on his painting.

He co-founded the Studio of Realist Art (SORA) Sydney in 1945. From 1947 to 1949 he worked as lecturer at the East Sydney Technical College. After studying in Paris, he moved to India, where he co-founded &quot;Editions Anarkali&quot;, publisher of fine arts in Bombay, while being employed as a visiting lecturer in lithography at the School of Fine Arts.

In 1953 he won the First Prize for Diploma Students, lithography, at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris. In 1965 he won first prize at the Mahasartra State (India) exhibition.

In 1975 he moved to Auckland, New Zealand, where he worked as a Lecturer in drawing and composition at the Auckland Society of Arts.

==Death==
Dalgarno died in Auckland of pneumonia in 2001.

==Legacy==
Described as a socialist bohemian and a social realist painter, his work commissioned by the Australian maritime and mining trade unions is perhaps the best remembered, for its depiction of Australian workers and working conditions.

The art historian Bernard Smith wrote of Dalgarno: &quot;He belongs to that great generation of social realist Australian artists who flourished during World War II and early post-war years but – in the aftermath of the Cold War – are now largely stored and forgotten by curators.&quot; (&#x27;Artist of the Everyday&#x27; &quot;The Australian&quot;, 23 February 2001)

<text>A law firm is a business entity formed by one or more lawyers to engage in the practice of law. The primary service rendered by a law firm is to advise clients (individuals or corporations) about their legal rights and responsibilities, and to represent clients in civil or criminal cases, business transactions, and other matters in which legal advice and other assistance are sought.

== Arrangements ==
Law firms are organized in a variety of ways, depending on the jurisdiction in which the firm practices. Common arrangements include:
* Sole proprietorship, in which the attorney &quot;is&quot; the law firm and is responsible for all profit, loss and liability;
* General partnership, in which all the attorneys who are members of the firm share ownership, profits and liabilities;
* Professional corporations, which issue stock to the attorneys in a fashion similar to that of a business corporation;
* Limited liability company, in which the attorney-owners are called &quot;members&quot; but are not directly liable to third party creditors of the law firm (prohibited as against public policy in many jurisdictions but allowed in others in the form of a &quot;Professional Limited Liability Company&quot; or &quot;PLLC&quot;);
* Professional association, which operates similarly to a professional corporation or a limited liability company;
* Limited liability partnership (LLP), in which the attorney-owners are partners with one another, but no partner is liable to any creditor of the law firm nor is any partner liable for any negligence on the part of any other partner. The LLP is taxed as a partnership while enjoying the liability protection of a corporation.

=== Restrictions on ownership interests ===
In many countries, including the United States, there is a rule that only lawyers may have an ownership interest in, or be managers of, a law firm. Thus, law firms cannot quickly raise capital through initial public offerings on the stock market, like most corporations. They must either raise capital through additional capital contributions from existing or additional equity partners, or must take on debt, usually in the form of a line of credit secured by their accounts receivable.

In the United States this complete bar to nonlawyer ownership has been codified by the American Bar Association as paragraph (d) of Rule 5.4 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and has been adopted in one form or another in all U.S. jurisdictions, except the District of Columbia. However, D.C.&#x27;s rule is narrowly tailored to allow equity ownership only by those nonlawyer partners who actively assist the firm&#x27;s lawyers in providing legal services, and does not allow for the sale of ownership shares to mere passive nonlawyer investors. The U.K. had a similar rule barring nonlawyer ownership, but under reforms implemented by the Legal Services Act of 2007 law firms have been able to take on a limited number of non-lawyer partners and lawyers have been allowed to enter into a wide variety of business relationships with non-lawyers and non-lawyer owned businesses. This has allowed, for example, grocery stores, banks and community organizations to hire lawyers to provide in-store and online basic legal services to customers.

The rule is controversial. It is justified by many in the legal profession, notably the American Bar Association which rejected a proposal to change the rule in its Ethics 20/20 reforms, as necessary to prevent conflicts of interest. In the adversarial system of justice, a lawyer has a duty to be a zealous and loyal advocate on behalf of the client, and also has a duty to not bill the client excessively. Also, as an officer of the court, a lawyer has a duty to be honest and to not file frivolous cases or raise frivolous defenses. Many in the legal profession believe that a lawyer working as a shareholder-employee of a publicly traded law firm might be tempted to evaluate decisions in terms of their effect on the stock price and the shareholders, which would directly conflict with the lawyer&#x27;s duties to the client and to the courts. Critics of the rule, however, believe that it is an inappropriate way of protecting clients&#x27; interests and that it severely limits the potential for the innovation of less costly and higher quality legal services that could benefit both ordinary consumers and businesses.

In 2025, Arizona became the first state (the District of Columbia is not a state) to authorize &quot;alternative business structures&quot; with nonlawyer owners. KPMG was the first such alternative business structure to win conditional approval to practice law in Arizona, but under the condition that it cannot provide legal services to clients for whom KPMG or its member firms were already providing audits or attestations.

===Multinational law firms===
Law firms operating in multiple countries often have complex structures involving multiple partnerships, particularly in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and Japan which restrict partnerships between local and foreign lawyers. One structure largely unique to large multinational law firms is the Swiss Verein, pioneered by Baker McKenzie in 2004, in which multiple national or regional partnerships form an association in which they share branding, administrative functions and various operating costs, but maintain separate revenue pools and often separate partner compensation structures. Other multinational law firms operate as single worldwide partnerships, such as British or American limited liability partnerships, in which partners also participate in local operating entities in various countries as required by local regulations.

=== Financial indicators ===
Three financial statistics are typically used to measure and rank law firms&#x27; performance:
* Profits per equity partner (PPEP or PPP): Net operating income divided by number of equity partners. High PPP is often correlated with prestige of a firm and its attractiveness to potential equity partners. However, the indicator is prone to manipulation by re-classifying less profitable partners as non-equity partners.
* Revenue per lawyer (RPL): Gross revenue divided by number of lawyers. This statistic shows the revenue-generating ability of the firm&#x27;s lawyers in general, but does not factor in the firm&#x27;s expenses such as associate compensation and office overhead.
* Average compensation of partners (ACP): Total amount paid to equity and nonequity partners (i.e., net operating income plus nonequity partner compensation) divided by the total number of equity and nonequity partners. This results in a more inclusive statistic than PPP, but remains prone to manipulation by changing expense policies and re-classifying less profitable partners as associates.

==Structure and promotion==

===Partnership===
Law firms are typically organized around partners, who are joint owners and business directors of the legal operation; associates, who are employees of the firm with the prospect of becoming partners; and a variety of staff employees, providing paralegal, clerical, and other support services. An associate may have to wait as long as 11 years before the decision is made as to whether the associate is made a partner. Many law firms have an &quot;up or out policy&quot;, integral to the Cravath System, which had been pioneered during the early 20th century by partner Paul Cravath of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, and became widely adopted by, particularly, white-shoe firms; associates who do not make partner are required to resign, and may join another firm, become a solo practitioner, work in-house for a corporate legal department, or change professions. Burnout rates are notably high in the profession.

Making partner is very prestigious at large or mid-sized firms, due to the competition that results from higher associate-to-partner ratios. Such firms may take out advertisements in professional publications to announce who has made partner. Traditionally, partners shared directly in the profits of the firm, after paying salaried employees, the landlord, and the usual costs of furniture, office supplies, and books for the law library (or a database subscription). Partners in a limited liability partnership can largely operate autonomously with regard to cultivating new business and servicing existing clients within their book of business.

Partner compensation methods vary greatly among law firms. At major United States law firms, the &quot;compensation spread&quot; (ratio between the highest partner salary and lowest partner salary) among firms disclosing information ranges from 3:1 to 24:1. Higher spreads are intended to promote individual performance, while lower spreads are intended to promote teamwork and collegiality.

Many large law firms have moved to a two-tiered partnership model, with equity and non-equity partners. Equity partners are considered to have ownership stakes in the firm, and share in the profits (and losses) of the firm. Non-equity partners are generally paid a fixed salary (albeit much higher than associates), and they are often granted certain limited voting rights with respect to firm operations.

The oldest continuing partnership in the United States is that of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft, founded in 1792 in New York City. The oldest law firm in continuous practice in the United States is Rawle &amp; Henderson, founded in 1783 in Philadelphia.

==== Termination of one&#x27;s partnership ====
It is rare for a partner to be forced out by fellow partners, although that can happen if the partner commits a crime or malpractice, experiences disruptive mental illness, or is not contributing to the firm&#x27;s overall profitability. However, some large firms have written into their partnership agreement a forced retirement age for partners, which can be anywhere from age 65 on up. In contrast, most corporate executives are at much higher risk of being fired, even when the underlying cause is not directly their fault, such as a drop in the company&#x27;s stock price. Worldwide, partner retirement ages can be difficult to estimate and often vary widely, particularly because in many countries it is illegal to mandate a retirement age.

===&quot;Of counsel&quot; role===
In the United States, Canada and Japan, many large and midsize firms have attorneys with the job title of &quot;counsel&quot;, &quot;special counsel&quot; or &quot;of counsel&quot;. As the Supreme Court of California has noted, the title has acquired several related but distinct definitions which do not easily fit into the traditional partner-associate structure. These attorneys are people who work for the firm, like associates, although some firms have an independent contractor relationship with their counsel. But unlike associates, and more like partners, they generally have their own clients, manage their own cases, and supervise associates. These relationships are structured to allow more senior attorneys to share in the resources and &quot;brand name&quot; of the firm without being a part of management or profit sharing decisions. The title is often seen among former associates who do not make partner, or who are laterally recruited to other firms, or who work as in-house counsel and then return to the big firm environment. At some firms, the title &quot;of counsel&quot; is given to retired partners who maintain ties to the firm. Sometimes &quot;of counsel&quot; refers to senior or experienced attorneys, such as foreign legal consultants, with specialized experience in particular aspects of law and practice. They are hired as independent contractors by large firms as a special arrangement, which may lead to profitable results for the partnership. In certain situations &quot;of counsel&quot; could be considered to be a transitional status in the firm.

===Mergers and acquisitions between law firms===
Mergers, acquisitions, division and reorganizations occur between law firms as in other businesses. The specific books of business and specialization of attorneys as well as the professional ethical structures surrounding conflict of interest can lead to firms splitting up to pursue different clients or practices, or merging or recruiting experienced attorneys to acquire new clients or practice areas. Results often vary between firms experiencing such transitions. Firms that gain new practice areas or departments through recruiting or mergers that are more complex and demanding (and typically more profitable) may see the focus, organization and resources of the firm shift dramatically towards those new departments. Conversely, firms may be merged among experienced attorneys as partners for purposes of shared financing and resources, while the different departments and practice areas within the new firm retain a significant degree of autonomy.

Law firm mergers tend to be assortative, in that only law firms operating in similar legal systems are likely to merge. For example, U.S. firms will often merge with English law firms, or law firms from other common law jurisdictions. A notable exception is King &amp; Wood Mallesons, a multinational law firm that is the result of a merger between an Australian law firm and a Chinese law firm.

Though mergers are more common among better economies, slowing down a bit during recessions, big firms sometimes use mergers as a strategy to boost revenue during a recession. Nevertheless, data from Altman Weil indicates that only four firms merged in the first half of 2013, as compared to eight in the same period in 2012, and this was taken by them as indicating a dip in morale regarding the legal economy and the amount of demand.

==Size==

Law firms can vary widely in size. The smallest law firms are lawyers practicing alone, who form the vast majority of law practices in nearly all countries.

Smaller firms tend to focus on particular specialties of the law (e.g. patent law, labor law, tax law, criminal defense, personal injury); larger firms may be composed of several specialized practice groups, allowing the firm to diversify its client base and market, and to offer a variety of services to their clients.

Large law firms usually have separate litigation and transactional departments. The transactional department advises clients and handles transactional legal work, such as drafting contracts, handling necessary legal applications and filings, and evaluating and ensuring compliance with relevant law; while the litigation department represents clients in court and handles necessary matters (such as discovery and motions filed with the court) throughout the process of litigation.

=== Anglo-American development ===
==== Boutique law firms ====
Lawyers in small cities and towns may still have old-fashioned general practices, but most urban lawyers tend to be highly specialized due to the overwhelming complexity of the law today. Thus, some small firms in the cities specialize in practicing only one kind of law (like employment, antitrust, intellectual property, investment funds, telecommunications or aviation) and are called boutique law firms.

==== Virtual law firms ====
A 21st century development has been the appearance of the virtual law firm, a firm with a virtual business address but no brick &amp; mortar office location open to the public, using modern telecommunications to operate from remote locations and provide its services to international clients, avoiding the costs of maintaining a physical premises with lower overheads than traditional law firms. This lower cost structure allows virtual law firms to bill clients on a contingency basis rather than by billable hours paid in advance by retainer.

Related innovations include alternative legal services provider (ALSP), legal outsourcing and what is sometimes called &quot;NewLaw&quot;.

The largest law firms have more than lawyers. These firms, often colloquially called &quot;megafirms&quot; or &quot;BigLaw&quot;, generally have offices on several continents, bill US$750 per hour or higher, and have a high ratio of support staff per attorney. Because of the localized and regional nature of firms, the relative size of a firm varies.

=== BigLaw firms ===

The largest U.S.-based firms are often referenced as &quot;BigLaw&quot; firms, a phrase often used to describe large law firms that follow the Cravath System&#x27;s &quot;loosely pyramid-shaped hierarchy of advancement&quot;. BigLaw firms typically specialize in all categories of legal work with high billable hour rates, including mergers and acquisitions transactions, banking, and corporate litigation. These firms rarely do plaintiffs&#x27; personal injury work. However, in terms of revenue and employee headcount, the largest law firms are still smaller than their counterparts in other types of professional services like consulting and accounting.

In 2008, the largest law firm in the world was the British firm Clifford Chance, which had revenue of over US$2 billion. In 2020, Kirkland &amp; Ellis came out on top with US$4.15 billion in revenue while Hogan Lovells rounded out the list at number ten with US$2.25 billion. Clifford Chance remains the only British firm among the top 10 considered &quot;BigLaw&quot;. This can be compared with $404 billion for the world&#x27;s largest firm by turnover ExxonMobil and $28 billion for the largest professional services firm Deloitte.

=== Worldwide ===
The largest law firms in the world are headquartered primarily in the United Kingdom, where they are deemed part of the Magic Circle, and in the United States, where they are known as &quot;BigLaw&quot; firms. Large firms of more than 1,000 lawyers are also found in Australia (MinterEllison, 1,500 attorneys), China (Dacheng, 2,100 attorneys) and Spain (Garrigues, 2,100 attorneys). The American system of licensing attorneys on a state-by-state basis, the tradition of having a headquarters in a single U.S. state and a close focus on profits per partner (as opposed to sheer scale) has to date limited the size of most American law firms. Thus, whilst the most profitable law firms in the world remain in New York, four of the six largest firms in the world are based in London in the United Kingdom. The sheer size of the United States results in a larger number of large firms overall – a 2003 paper noted that the U.S. had 901 law firms with more than 50 lawyers, while there were only 58 such firms in Canada, 44 in Great Britain, 14 in France, and 9 in Germany. During the 21st century, law firms have increased activity in transatlantic mergers, with globalisation of firms reaching an all-time peak in 2021. Both UK and U.S. firms are reported as continuing to seek an increasingly global reach, through mergers and acquisitions, in 2024. 

Due to their size, the U.S.- and U.K.-based law firms are the most prestigious and powerful in the world, and they tend to dominate the international market for legal services. A 2007 research paper noted that firms from other countries merely pick up their leftovers: &quot;[M]uch of the competition is relatively orderly whereby predominantly Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian firms compete for business not required by English or American law firms.&quot;

Since the early 1970s, the largest U.K. law firms have struggled to break into the much larger U.S. legal market, with only limited success in establishing footholds along the East Coast in important markets like New York City. In 2020, several of the largest U.K. firms began to invest in expansion into multiple regions of the United States, such as Silicon Valley. However, as of early 2024, the largest U.K. firms were losing ground on their home turf in London to rapid growth by the largest U.S. firms and were forced to raise salaries in response. The Americans recruited many British solicitors by offering more generous salaries, but also brought with them a different work-life balance, with higher billable hours requirements and the American expectation that lawyers routinely work on weekends.

=== Recession ===
As a result of the U.S. recession of 2007 to 2009, many American law firms downsized personnel, while others permanently shuttered. On February 12, 2009, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that 700 jobs were cut during that single day at law firms nationwide. The &quot;Denver Post&quot; reported that major law firms cut more than 10,000 jobs nationwide in 2009. Among closed firms of the era was Heller Ehrman, a San Francisco-based law practice established in 1890. Similarly, Halliwells of the UK was dissolved in 2010. Law firm layoffs became so common that trade publications like &quot;American Lawyer&quot; produced an ongoing &quot;Layoff List&quot; of the law firms nationwide experiencing personnel cuts.

==Salaries==
Law firm salary structures typically depend on firm size. Small-firm salaries vary widely within countries and from one country to the next, and are not often publicly available. Because most countries do not have unified legal professions, there are often significant disparities in income among the various legal professions within a particular country. Finally, the availability of salary data also depends upon the existence of journalists and sociologists able to collect and analyze such data.

=== United States ===
The U.S. is currently the only country with enough lawyers, as well as journalists and sociologists who specialize in studying them, to have widely available data on salary structures at major law firms.

In 2006, median salaries of new graduates ranged from US$50,000 per year in small firms (two to ten attorneys) to US$160,000 per year in very large firms (more than 501 attorneys). The distribution of these salaries was highly bimodal, with the majority of new lawyers earning at either the high end or the low end of the scale, and a median salary of US$62,000. In the summer of 2016, New York law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore raised its first-year associate salary to $180,000. Many other high-end New York-based and large national law firms soon followed. Two years later, in the summer of 2018, New York law firm Milbank raised its first-year associate salary to $190,000, with other major firms following shortly thereafter. In 2022 Milbank increased first-year compensation to $215,000, with most comparable firms following suit.

The traditional salary model for law firm associates is lockstep compensation, in which associate salaries go up by a fixed amount each year from the associate&#x27;s law school graduation. However, many firms have switched to a level-based compensation system, in which associates are divided into three (or sometimes four) levels based on skills mastered. In 2013, the median salaries for the three associate levels were $152,500, $185,000 and $216,000 among large firms (more than 700 lawyers), and $122,000, $143,500 and $160,000 among all firms.

Some prominent law firms, like Goodwin Procter and Paul Hastings, give generous signing bonuses (e.g., $20,000) to incoming first-year associates who hold JD/MBA degrees.

Another way law firm associates increase their earnings or improve their employment conditions is through a lateral move to another law firm.
A 2014 survey by LexisNexis indicated that over 95% of law firms consulted intended to hire lateral attorneys within the next two years. Though the success for both the attorney and the law firms in lateral hiring has been questioned. The National Law Review reported that the cost of recruiting, compensating, and integrating a lateral attorney can be upwards of $600,000 and that 60% of lateral attorney hires fail to thrive at their new law firms.

===United Kingdom===
British firms typically practise lockstep compensation. In London, entry-level solicitor salaries (NQ - Newly Qualified) are typically: (i) £40,000–70,000 at boutique and national firms, (ii) £80,000–100,000 at magic circle firms, and (iii) £120,000–155,000 at London offices of leading US firms.

A senior associate with six years&#x27; experience may make £68,000-120,000 at a national firm or upwards of £160,000 at a global firm. Salary levels are lower in areas outside London.

===Australia===
Australia has regional variation in lawyer salaries, with the highest salary levels in Sydney, followed by Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, then Adelaide. Salaries vary between top-tier, mid-size, and small firms. At top-tier firms in Sydney, salaries of lawyers who have been admitted to practice range from $75,000 to $92,000 and partners make on average $1,215,000. In Sydney, mid-tier starting salaries for admitted lawyers range from between $65,000 and $82,000 Most Australian lawyers are not admitted until ten months into their time at their law firm, since the initial period involves supervised legal training before admission is granted.

Typically in Australian firms lawyers are in a lock-step system for the first two years of practice, following which pay increases are dependent on performance assessed, in large measure, by satisfaction of billable hour targets.

===Hong Kong===
Newly qualified associates at leading firms in Hong Kong typically make HK$840,000 to HK$948,000, with partners in the HK$1.6 million to HK$4 million+ range; many firms pay New York salaries with cost of living adjustments.

=== Korea (South Korea) ===
Newly qualified lawyers at leading law firms in Korea typically make between KRW 80,000,000 to KRW 90,000,000 per year.

===Singapore===
At local firms in Singapore, associates in their first three years typically make $60,000 to $100,000, while midlevel (4–7 years) associates make $110,000 to $180,000 and senior (8+ years) associates make $160,000 or more. International firms pay significantly more, with senior associates often making more than $250,000.

===India===
There is more information available for entry level associates. First-year lawyers may earn anywhere between INR 8,000 to INR 1,10,000 per month. Tier 1 law firms provide the best pay package, of about INR 15,00,000 annually. There is a wide difference in the salary range depending on the city, law firm, and university of the candidate. For instance, the salary is higher in cities like Mumbai and Delhi NCR as opposed to other cities like Kolkata, Pune, Ahmedabad, etc.

==Location==
Most law firms are located in law office buildings of various sizes, ranging from modest one-story buildings to some of the tallest skyscrapers in the world (In 2004, Paul Hastings was the first firm to put its name on a skyscraper).

In late 2001, it was widely publicized that John C. Dearie&#x27;s personal injury plaintiffs&#x27; firm in the state of New York has been experimenting with bus-sized mobile law offices. The firm insists that it does not &quot;chase ambulances&quot;. It claims that a law office on wheels is more convenient for personal injury plaintiffs, who are often recovering from severe injuries and thus find it difficult to travel far from their homes for an intake interview.

==Rankings==
Law firms are ranked both objectively, such as by revenue, profits per partner, and subjectively, by various legal publishers and journalists.

As legal practice is adversarial, law firm rankings are widely relied on by prospective associates, lateral hires and legal . Subjective rankings typically cover practice areas such as &quot;The American Lawyer&quot;&#x27;s Corporate Scorecard and Top IP Firms. Work place rankings are directed toward lawyers or law students, and cover such topics as quality of life, hours, family friendliness and salaries. Finally, statistical rankings generally cover profit-related data such as profits per partner and revenue per lawyer. Third party attorney ranking services such as Chambers and Partners and Martindale-Hubbell are generally very competitive and can help raise an individual attorney&#x27;s professional profile, and to catch this marketing advantage, over 1,200 attorney ranking and or awards have sprung up in the U.S. Various state bar associations have taken notice of the prolific growth of attorney honor awards and have determined that lawyers may refer to such honors in advertising &quot;only when the basis for comparison can be verified&quot; and the organization providing the award &quot;has made adequate inquiry into the fitness of the individual lawyer&quot;.

In an October 2007 press conference reported in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the law student group Building a Better Legal Profession released its first annual ranking of top law firms by average billable hours, &quot;pro bono&quot; participation, and demographic diversity. Most notably, the report ranked the percentages of women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, and gays and lesbians at America&#x27;s top law firms. The group has sent the information to top law schools around the country, encouraging students to take this demographic data into account when choosing where to work after graduation. As more students choose where to work based on the firms&#x27; diversity rankings, firms face an increasing market pressure in order to attract top recruits.

==In popular culture==
A number of television shows, movies and books have revolved around relationships occurring in fictional law firms, highlighting both public fascination with and misperception of the lives of lawyers in high-powered settings.

&quot;Suits&quot; is a popular American legal drama television series. &quot;Boston Legal&quot; is a popular American comedy drama, a spin-off of another long running series created by David E. Kelley, &quot;The Practice&quot;.

The film &quot;The Firm&quot; was adapted from a book written by John Grisham.

The television series &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; features several fictional law firms.

<doc id="894303" wikidata="Q1440379" url="?curid=894303" title="Fractional Orbital Bombardment System">
<text>A Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) is a warhead delivery system that uses a low Earth orbit towards its target destination. Just before reaching the target, it deorbits through a retrograde engine burn.

The Soviet Union first developed FOBS as a nuclear-weapons delivery system in the 1960s. It was one of the first Soviet efforts to use space to deliver nuclear weapons. In August 2021, the People&#x27;s Republic of China tested a weapon that combined a FOBS with a hypersonic glide vehicle.

Like a kinetic bombardment system but with nuclear weapons, FOBS has several attractive qualities: it has no range limit, its flight path would not reveal the target location, and warheads could be directed to North America over the South Pole, evading detection by NORAD&#x27;s north-facing early warning systems.

The maximum altitude would be around 150 km. Energetically, this would require a launch vehicle powerful enough to be capable of putting the weapon &#x27;into orbit&#x27;. 

== Development history and deployment ==
=== Lead-up to FOBS development ===
Some USSR officials began expressing a desire for a FOBS-type weapon around the time of Sputnik&#x27;s launch. By the early 1960s, the Soviet Union felt that pursuing a system like the FOBS would be a natural next step given its belief that the US was already planning to use space to mount nuclear attacks. The success of the Soviet Vostok program which saw a rocket send a human into orbit and then land at a predesignated location made this kind of weapon seem more feasible.

=== Competing FOBS designs ===
Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolev seems to have been responsible for the first FOBS-type missile design. His offering was the GR-1; it was also known as &#x27;Global Missile 1&#x27; within Korolev&#x27;s design bureau, as SS-X-10 Scrag by NATO authorities, and as 11A513 (or 8K73) by Soviet GRAU index. Korolev&#x27;s research began as early as 1960 and the GR-1 project was sanctioned by Soviet officials on September 24, 1962.

Korolev brought up the idea of the GR-1 to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in early 1962. Soon after, Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union was capable of utilizing &quot;global missiles&quot; that could fly over both the North and South Poles on their way to a target, continuing on to say that this type of weapon would render early warning radar systems practically obsolete and leave the enemy with no time to retaliate before the weapon&#x27;s impact. Korolev&#x27;s engineers first estimated that NATO radar systems would detect the GR-1&#x27;s warhead only two minutes before arrival.

The GR-1 was to use the NK-9 and NK-9V as main engines in its first and second stages respectively. Though the NK-9 and NK-9V weren&#x27;t created by Korolev&#x27;s team, the GR-1&#x27;s 8D726 retrorocket engine was. This engine would prove to be instrumental to the progress of Russian rocketry, specifically for its importance in the development of the Blok-D upper stage of rockets like the N1, Proton, and Zenit. 

The GR-1 had three stages and a total vehicle mass of 117 tons. It was 35.31 meters long with a 2.68 meter diameter and could carry a single 2.2 megaton yield nuclear warhead. It was cryogenic liquid propelled, utilizing a mix of RG-1 kerosene with liquid oxygen (LOX).

Two other FOBS-type missile projects emerged around the time of the GR-1&#x27;s early development. It seems that each of these projects were competing with one another for usage selection.

The first of the two other projects was that of Soviet missile engineer Vladimir Chelomey who proposed two designs: one called the UR-200A (GRAU index 8K83) that was derivative of his UR-200 ICBM and another designated as GR-2 which built off of his colossal UR-500 prototype ICBM and had a much larger explosive yield of 30 megatons. The UR-200A design was eventually selected for further development over the GR-2. It was to use the RD-0202 and RD-0205 engines for its first and second stages respectively and be equipped with an AB-200 aeroballistic warhead. Unlike the GR-1, the UR-200 and its derivatives used storable (or hypergolic) liquid propellants; specifically nitrogen tetroxide and UDMH. Chelomey and his engineers received development authorization for the UR-200 ICBM on March 16, 1961, beginning work on the UR-200A variant at some point after.

The second of the two other projects came from the Soviet missile designer Mikhail Yangel. His proposal was the R-36O (8K69 by GRAU index and SS-9 Mod 3 Scarp by NATO report) which was approved for development by Soviet officials on April 16, 1962. Yangel used an ICBM design of his own, the R-36 (NATO designation SS-9 Scarp), as a base for the R-36O. The missile had three stages, using the RD-251 engine in its first stage and the RD-252 engine in its second stage. The weapon&#x27;s third stage was related to the deorbiting process as well as warhead guidance and delivery; the Soviets referred to this system as OGCh. 

An aiming system inside the OGCh would check and rectify trajectory issues in relation to the desired target location through the use of various instruments (for instance, a radio altimeter used in conjunction with an inertial navigation system). The aiming system would make its checks directly after the missile came into orbit and immediately before third stage ignition. Deorbiting would be induced by the missile&#x27;s retrorocket, the RD-854 engine, causing the warhead to take on a ballistic path towards its target. 

The warhead, retrorocket, and guidance system were each contained inside the OGCh module. A series of nozzles on the RD-854 enabled aerial maneuvering of the OGCh. Other nozzles facilitated the separation of the warhead from the rest of the OGCh, allowing it to fall alone on a ballistic path to the target. The R-36O&#x27;s 8F021 warhead had an explosive yield between 5-20 megatons according to Soviet sources. Western intelligence suggests that the yield was smaller, being somewhere between 1-3.5 megatons. The missile was 32.60 meters long with a 3.00 meter diameter and a total launch mass of 180 tons. The R-36O used the same hypergolic propellants as the UR-200.

=== Yangel design selection ===
In 1965, Soviet military officials worked to select one of the three FOBS projects. The R-36O of Yangel&#x27;s design bureau was chosen for further development over the others. The reasoning behind the Soviet FOBS design selection process remains somewhat unclear. A particularly confounding factor to consider is that none of the three proposed missiles had undergone a single test flight prior to the R-36O&#x27;s selection. Even so, there are some explanations as to why Yangel&#x27;s design was chosen in the end. These revolve around the occurrence of negative events in the competing GR-1 and UR-200A projects that effectively knocked them out of contention. 

One strike against Korolev&#x27;s GR-1 was that it used a cryogenic propellant, thereby rendering the missile a poor candidate for operational storage in a missile silo as the Soviet military desired. Other negative factors include that the GR-1&#x27;s 8D726 retrorocket was demonstrating a proclivity for failure in its initial tests and, as a cause for yet more worry, the troublesome R-9A, the subject of a different ongoing Korolev ICBM project, was quite similar to the GR-1 in construction. Thus, military leadership was encouraged to look elsewhere for more immediate progress. 

The GR-1&#x27;s ability to deal with US ABM systems and its lengthy fueling process were questioned by Soviet analysts. There were also significant delays associated with the production of the GR-1&#x27;s NK-9 engine, of which the Kuznetsov bureau was responsible for. Under the weight of these issues, the GR-1 project fell apart in January 1965. 

Chelomey&#x27;s UR-200A project lost a great deal of support after Khrushchev, his most important political ally, was ousted in 1964. Military authorities under the Brezhnev administration were far less friendly to Chelomey and quick to deem the R-36O a better choice for further FOBS development. Having lost the ability to tap into the Soviet Premier&#x27;s influence, Chelomey ultimately failed to secure the survival of the UR-200A, its development coming to an end in 1965.

=== Flight testing and deployment ===
At its missile range near Baikonur, Kazakhstan, the Soviet Union tested and deployed the R-36O. A testing station and a horizontal assembly facility were constructed for the missile&#x27;s development initially. Over most of 1965, two R-36 test pads were modified to work with the R-36O for its early test flights. In addition, 18 silos capable of launching the R-36O were built over the mid 1960s to 1971; three rounds of construction occurred with six silos being built each time. Those built in the same area were placed 10-15 kilometers away from one another to prevent the possibility of a single nuclear strike destroying multiple silos.

The Soviet Union originally planned nineteen R-36O launches, but 24 were carried out by 1971. The initial four were to begin from a ground-based testing pad and then fly to the Kamchatka Peninsula. The other tests called for the R-36O to be launched from a silo into orbit where it would then execute its third stage deorbit process over the Pacific Ocean; the missile&#x27;s payload would be retrofired into Soviet territory. Over 2000 Soviet service people participated in the tests. Six of the tests were outright failures while the others achieved either complete or partial success. Prior to the first launches, the Soviet Union stated that a &quot;space vehicle landing system&quot; was being tested over the Pacific.

The first test flight occurred on December 16, 1965. It missed the landing area by a wide margin owing to a stabilization instrument malfunction. The second test was on February 5, 1966 and was also a failure due to a retrorocket issue. The third test took place on March 16, 1966. Nitrogen tetroxide spilled over the surface pad during fueling due to a miscommunication and the missile was quickly destroyed by fire. Some success was had with the fourth test on May 20, 1966, but the payload didn&#x27;t break away from the missile&#x27;s guidance system as intended. 

The following tests were conducted from silos. The first two tests of the silo phase ended in the intentional destruction (via self-destruct functionality) of the R-36O as a result of the second stage engine accidentally being activated for too long, sending the payload into an unplanned orbit. NATO radar systems picked up on the large mass of resulting debris. In one failed test case, small pieces of the missile rained down on the midwestern United States.

In 1967, the Soviet Union conducted ten more R-36O tests, nine of them seeing some level of success. In that year and beyond, the Soviet Union used public statements about satellite launch tests as cover for any R-36O test that was intended to put its payload into orbit for some period of time. 

On November 19, 1968, about a month after the 20th test, the Soviet Union designated the R-36O as operational and began its deployment in three groups of six. By 1971, all 18 of the Soviet Union&#x27;s R-36O silos were in service in Kazakhstan. NATO intelligence suggests that a primary target was the US Grand Forks Air Force Base where an ABM system was set to be established in the late 1960s to early 1970s. The R-36O wasn&#x27;t equipped with a nuclear payload until 1972.

== Reasons for development ==

The Soviet Union identified a number of strategic advantages of the FOBS. The following points prompted its development:

* The system granted unlimited striking range with a nuclear weapon.
* The system allowed a strike to be carried out from any direction. For instance, the Soviet Union could launch an attack against the United States using a South Pole or North Pole flight path; technically, it could even execute both of these attack plans simultaneously.
* The system provided a way of evading early warning radar systems. This advantage comes from two different attributes of the FOBS: (1) that it could attack from any direction, as stated above, and (2) that it could travel along a very low Earth orbital path. The first point has to do with the fact that one of the primary missile defense radar systems of the US around the time of the FOBS&#x27; early development was the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS). The BMEWS was oriented to detect ballistic missiles coming from the aforementioned &#x27;North Pole route&#x27; (its three stations being located in Alaska, Greenland, and the United Kingdom) and therefore wouldn&#x27;t detect a strike flying along a southern orbital path. The second point considers that FOBS missiles could fly relatively close to the Earth&#x27;s surface; they could have a perigee of under 100 miles (160 km) and an apogee as low as 125 miles (200 km) above the ground (see apsis). US radar systems like the BMEWS were configured to detect ICBMs that flew several hundred to upwards of 1000 miles (1600 km) above the surface, not low altitude missiles like that of the FOBS. Thus, the Soviet Union felt that striking with a FOBS would deprive the United States of valuable warning time that ICBMs were likely to give away, time that could be used to mount a devastating retaliatory attack.
*The system concealed the target location until the payload was dropped out of orbit. Theoretically, the FOBS was capable of staying in orbit for several orbits, at most, due to the exceptionally low trajectory, but could separate its warhead from the FOBS vehicle at any given point in the orbit.
*The FOBS&#x27; flight duration was shorter than that of an ICBM (assuming an indirect route isn&#x27;t taken for the purpose of radar evasion). A FOBS missile may have been able to reach its target around 10 minutes before an ICBM would.
*The Soviet Union supposed that the FOBS would be capable of trumping US anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems. This was actually a primary objective of the Soviet FOBS from its origin. On one hand, the FOBS was seen as a tool that could boost the effectiveness of a Soviet ICBM strike by first eliminating some of the enemy&#x27;s safeguards (like ABM systems). Given the notion that a FOBS missile could not be destroyed by an ABM system, it also follows that the FOBS could be used alone to carry out a nuclear attack. In late 1967, US officials indicated that they could develop ABMs to counter the Soviet FOBS, the implication being that it was indeed capable of besting American ABM systems at that time and beforehand.

== End of deployment and associated reasons ==

There are two main technical disadvantages of the FOBS to consider:
* Its nuclear payload was drastically reduced relative to that of an ICBM due to the high level of energy needed to get the weapon into orbit. According to American intelligence, the FOBS&#x27; nuclear warhead mass needed to be roughly to of that of an ICBM, and required a more robust ablative system, due to the higher entry velocities.
* The FOBS was less accurate than an ICBM. This was empirically demonstrated in the series of Soviet R-36O flight tests that occurred over 1965-1971.

There are a number of other factors to consider that prompted the end of FOBS deployment in the Soviet Union:
* The FOBS wouldn&#x27;t be able to overcome later early warning radar system developments made by the US, especially those that came in the form of space-based radar deployments. The US established missile detection systems of this type by the early 1970s. The FOBS was made to counter relatively simple ground-based systems like the BMEWS, not the more expansive radar network that followed it. The Soviet FOBS thus had lost one of its primary capabilities only several years into its deployment, a FOBS strike no longer having an adequate probability of going undetected by the US.
*An additional primary use of the Soviet FOBS—its ability to counter an American ABM system—was found out to be needless as time passed. Contrary to earlier Soviet projections, the US never built a large ABM system purposed in fending off a Soviet ICBM attack. The only significant American ABM system constructed was Safeguard (initially called Sentinel), but it was shut down by 1976 and mainly China-oriented anyway; it would have been practically useless in the face of anything beyond a limited Soviet nuclear attack regardless of the FOBS.
*Soviet SLBM technology grew into a good replacement for the FOBS on the basis of low flight time, high range (via the submarine&#x27;s ability to move near its target), and the element of surprise.
*The FOBS potentially acted as a dangerous accelerant to the Cold War arms race for the reason that it was most useful in the context of a pre-emptive nuclear strike. A nation observing their enemy developing the FOBS could logically conclude that they viewed a first strike as a viable nuclear strategy; the observing nation may react to this realization by ramping up its own weapon production and perhaps adopting a first strike nuclear strategy as well.

The Soviet Union began decommissioning and dismantling the FOBS deployment in 1982 (officially in January 1983). The R36-O missile was completely removed from service by February 1983. Starting in May 1984, the Soviet Union razed its FOBS-capable silos. There&#x27;s confusion over whether all 18 silos were destroyed. One source suggests that six silos were instead modified for the purpose of ICBM modernization testing, as per a SALT II agreement (see Outer Space Treaty and SALT II).

== Outer Space Treaty and SALT II == 

Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 stated that:
Parties to the Treaty undertake not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install such weapons on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space in any other manner.

The overriding opinion of US administrators was that the Soviet FOBS did not violate the treaty, mostly for the reason that the system didn&#x27;t go into a full orbit. For instance, US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara argued that the Soviet Union had only agreed &quot;not to place [nuclear] warheads in orbit,&quot; continuing on to point out that the FOBS executes its mission on a &quot;fractional orbit, not a full orbit.&quot; Senator Henry M. Jackson, chairman of the Joint Atomic Energy Subcommittee on Military Applications, countered that the Soviet FOBS was at least a &quot;good faith violation of the treaty,&quot; alluding to the notion that the weapon could go into technical orbit. 

This is certainly true: the only thing stopping the Soviet FOBS&#x27; payload from completing a full revolution around the Earth (and thereby literally going orbital and violating the treaty) was the firing of the system&#x27;s retrorocket. Even so, McNamara also drew attention to the fact that the treaty did not ban any form of weapons testing—not even the testing of an orbital nuclear weapons system. None of the Soviet Union&#x27;s test R-36Os were ever equipped with a nuclear warhead; so, even if it were the case that the launches went orbital, they still would not have broken the treaty.

Unlike the Outer Space Treaty, the SALT II agreement of 1979 explicitly prohibited the pursuance and deployment of the FOBS:

The SALT II agreement was never ratified by the United States Senate. The Soviet Union ultimately complied with its terms anyway, decommissioning its FOBS in 1983 (see the &#x27;End of deployment and associated reasons&#x27; section). The agreement also stipulated that 12 of the 18 Soviet FOBS launchers in Kazakhstan were to be taken apart or demolished and never replaced. This was meant to happen within an eight month period following the treaty&#x27;s ratification. The terms allowed the USSR to modify the six remaining launchers to fit missile modernization testing purposes.

== American view == 

The U.S. considered creating orbital bombardment weapons in the early 1960s, but concluded in 1963 that they offered few advantages over the ICBM. So when the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) began in 1962 to suspect that the Soviet Union would develop a FOBS-like system, they concluded that Moscow sought the weapon for &quot;propaganda or political reasons&quot;, not any militarily significant capacity. 

The Soviet Union&#x27;s R-36O test launches in 1966 and 1967 persuaded the CIA that Moscow was more serious about the military applications (though even through October 1968, around a month before the R-36O was declared operational by the USSR, it remained unclear to the CIA whether the tests they had observed involved a FOBS or a &quot;depressed trajectory&quot; ICBM).

At a news conference on November 3, 1967, Defense Secretary McNamara announced that the Soviet Union might be creating a FOBS. This was the first time that the FOBS project had been explicitly referred to in public (though Khrushchev alluded to this kind of weapon in the early 1960s). McNamara emphasized that the potential Soviet FOBS did not worry him in consideration of its disadvantages compared to the ICBM. At a subsequent congressional hearing, John S. Foster Jr., Director of Defense Research and Engineering, said that the U.S. had since 1963 been developing &quot;over-the-horizon&quot; radar networks that could give about 30 minutes&#x27; warning of a FOBS strike, and that such funding would continue. 

The U.S.&#x27; view that the FOBS was not particularly useful militarily may explain why the Soviet FOBS was defended by McNamara and others as legal under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. U.S. officials may not have been willing to see the treaty break down over a single issue like the FOBS, especially given that they had already evaluated it as a minor threat in the grand scheme of that period&#x27;s nuclear weapon landscape.

== Recent developments ==
In 2021, United States Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall III said that the People&#x27;s Liberation Army was developing and testing a FOBS.

In 2021, Russia entered into service a new ICBM that could arguably fit the criteria to be considered a FOBS. The RS-28 Sarmat or SS-X-30 Satan II is a liquid-fueled missile with a range of 10,000-18,000km and a payload capacity of 10,000kg which can be various types of warheads and weapons. The RS-28 Sarmat will be replacing the R-36M2 or known to NATO as SS-18 Satan. The United States Pentagon claims that the RS-28 ICBM can be deployed as a FOBS and could potentially increase the range up to 38,000km. Not only is this idea concerning for security reasons, but the 1967 Outer Space Treaty would prohibit this action likely resulting with responses from NATO, the severity of the consequences would likely depend on the initial action. The RS-28 Sarmat had entered service in 2021, but was not successfully tested until 2022 when it concluded its first test flight. Following Russia&#x27;s new highly advanced missile, the United States is leaning towards the development of a new missile to replace the outperformed Minuteman III missile. The United States response program would cost ~$85 billion according to the Pentagon. 

The results of these missile developments, particularly the RS-28 Sarmat which is capable of FOBS implementation could be a new form of an arms race setting back both countries in the progress made following the Cold War. The Cold War brought many times of uncertainty surrounding nuclear arms which presented many agreements between the two powers. Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) are the primary weapon of nuclear capability today. The development of the RS-28 Sarmat classified as a ICBM, but possessing the ability to function as an FOBS is concerning to many world leaders. The specifications that present the primary concern is the extreme range with low trajectory flight to prevent detection from the NORAD system in Alaska, US. The undetected missile could release at-least 10 multiple targeted re-entry vehicles. 

In September 2023, the leader of Russia, Vladimir Putin confirmed that the country had deployed missiles that would ensure safety and provide a strong deterrence to any enemy (referring to the Sarmat). 

== Chinese FOBS Development ==
China tested a FOBS missile system in July and August of 2021. A rocket was launched into orbital flight and re-entered the atmosphere deploying a glide vehicle that traveled at hypersonic speeds. It is claimed that the warhead missed its unidentified target by roughly twenty-four miles. FOBS are technologies from the Cold War and ICBMs tend to be the go-to for most advanced militaries. ICBMs can hold larger warheads because they do not need retrorockets to get the warhead out of orbit like the FOBS does. The amount of warheads the vehicle can deliver is still unknown.

The invention of FOB missiles is nothing new. In the 1960s, the Soviet Union tested these missiles. The development was scrapped in the late 1960s however, because the Soviet government thought they were inadequate due to their decreased payload and easier detection. The Chinese military tested these same missiles using the new Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (or HGVs) equipment. Like other medium and long range ballistic missiles, HGVs can reach Mach 5 speeds easily at around 1 mile per second. The difference between missiles equipped with HGVs and those that are not, are that HGV missiles can maneuver and change course after launch far easier than regular ballistic missiles without an HGV. While these missiles can still be detected, the flight path of an HGV based missile is harder to predict, and could cause trouble for anyone attempting to intercept them.  
While a FOBS system could essentially bypass missile defense systems located in the northern regions of the United States, the United States has been upgrading existing radar on stationary and mobile platforms as well, which could diminish the strike rate of a hypersonic glide vehicle.

<text>Las Ketchup is a Spanish girl group founded by flamenco record producer Manuel &quot;Queco&quot; Ruiz. The group, which consists of sisters Lucía, Lola, and Pilar Muñoz (later to be joined by a fourth sister Rocío), is best known for the 2002 hit single, &quot;The Ketchup Song (Aserejé)&quot;, a single that sold over seven million copies worldwide. The group&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Hijas del Tomate&quot;, has sold over two million copies worldwide.

They represented at Eurovision Song Contest 2006 in Athens with the song &quot;Un Blodymary&quot;. The group has not released any singles since 2006, but still performs together publicly around Spain and other countries.

== History ==

=== 2001–2002: Formation ===

All members of the group are daughters of flamenco musician Juan Manuel Muñoz Expósito, best known by his stage name, El Tomate (Spanish for &quot;The Tomato&quot;).

Las Ketchup was originally discovered by the flamenco record producer Manuel &quot;Queco&quot; Ruiz, who signed them to his newly formed, independent Córdoba label Shaketown Music, that he ran together with Manuel Illán.

=== 2002–2005: Hijas del Tomate ===

In the middle of 2002, they had a major flamenco Europop fusion hit with &quot;Aserejé&quot; (released as &quot;The Ketchup Song&quot; in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries), which reached the top of the charts in many countries, including: Spain, Portugal, Colombia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Albania, France, Finland, Turkey, Syria, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Switzerland, Germany, Romania, Canada and Australia. However, it failed to hit the top 40 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The title and part of the lyrics were in Spanish. The hit also had an accompanying dance. The second single was &quot;Kusha Las Payas&quot; and garnered moderate success. The group re-released &quot;The Ketchup Song&quot; later in the same year, with a new video, as a Christmas song.

=== 2006: Un Blodymary and addition of Rocío ===

The group took an extended absence from the public eye to write songs for a new album and, during the same period, Pilar had a baby. In 2006, they were joined by Rocío, a fourth sister, and came back as a four girl group to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. The girls said themselves that Rocío had always been a member of &quot;Las Ketchup&quot;, but that had not appeared in the promo material or performances because she was pregnant. They released their second studio album, titled &quot;Un Blodymary&quot;. The album release was delayed until the beginning of 2006. They planned to release one million copies and their record producer Queco, who also produced and wrote their worldwide single, &quot;Aserejé&quot;, indicated that the album displayed their original sound. Their first single from the album was also titled &quot;Un Blodymary&quot; for the Spanish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. The song finished twenty-first with only 18 points.

=== 2016–2017 ===

In 2016, the group performed their hit &quot;The Ketchup Song (Aserejé)&quot; as an interval during the first semi-final of the Swedish pre-selection to the Eurovision Song Contest, Melodifestivalen. In 2017, they performed at the Pal Norte in Monterrey, Mexico.

<text>The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms is a 1953 American independent monster film directed by Eugène Lourié, with stop motion animation by Ray Harryhausen. It is partly based on Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1951 short story of the same name, which was later reprinted as &quot;The Fog Horn&quot;. In the film, the &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot;, a giant dinosaur is released from its frozen state in the Arctic by an atomic bomb test. Paul Christian stars as Thomas Nesbitt, the foremost surviving witness of the creature before it causes havoc while traveling toward New York. Paula Raymond, Cecil Kellaway, and Kenneth Tobey are featured in supporting roles.

Jack Dietz and Hal E. Chester arranged the production of a monster movie in response to the successful 1952 re-release of &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). While Lou Morheim and Fred Freiberger were solely credited for screenwriting, many contributed to writing the film, including Dietz, Harryhausen, and Lourié. On an estimated budget, principal photography occurred in New York from July to August 1952, under the title &quot;The Monster from Beneath the Sea&quot;. Harryhausen and Willis Cook created the special effects over roughly six months. In 1953, Warner Bros. bought the film for , retitled it, and hired David Buttolph to replace Michel Michelet&#x27;s original score.

&quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; was released throughout the United States in June 1953, to widespread critical praise for its special effects. The film grossed over worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1953. It pioneered the &quot;atomic monster&quot; genre and is credited with launching the giant monster and &quot;kaiju&quot; movie trend that ensured its initial release. &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954) is often cited as having taken inspiration from the film. In recent years, &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; has acquired a cult following and has been listed among the greatest science fiction, horror, and B movies of the 1950s.

== Plot ==

Far north of the Arctic Circle, a nuclear bomb test, dubbed &quot;Operation Experiment&quot;, is conducted. Prophetically, right after the blast, physicist Thomas Nesbitt muses &quot;What the cumulative effects of all these atomic explosions and tests will be, only time will tell&quot;. The explosion awakens a long carnivorous dinosaur known as a &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot;, thawing it out of the ice where it had been held in suspended animation for millions of years. Nesbitt is the only surviving witness to the beast&#x27;s awakening and later is dismissed out-of-hand as being delirious at the time of his sighting. Despite the skepticism, he persists, knowing what he saw.

The dinosaur begins making its way down the east coast of North America, sinking a fishing ketch off the Grand Banks, destroying another near Marquette, Canada, wrecking a lighthouse in Maine, and destroying buildings in Massachusetts. Nesbitt eventually gains allies in paleontologist Thurgood Elson and his young assistant Lee Hunter after one of the surviving fishermen identifies from a collection of drawings the very same dinosaur that Nesbitt saw. Plotting the sightings of the beast&#x27;s appearances on a map for skeptical military officers, Elson proposes the dinosaur is returning to the Hudson River area, where fossils of &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot; were first found. In a diving bell search of the undersea Hudson River Canyon, Professor Elson is killed after his bell is swallowed by the beast, which eventually comes ashore in Manhattan. It devours a police officer shooting at it, totals cars, knocks over buildings, and generally causes a panicking frenzy. A later newspaper report of its rampage lists &quot;180 known dead, 1500 injured, damage estimates $300 million&quot;.

Meanwhile, military troops led by Colonel Jack Evans attempt to stop the &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot; with an electrified barricade, then blast a hole with a bazooka in the beast&#x27;s throat, which drives it back into the sea. Unfortunately, it bleeds all over the streets of New York, unleashing a horrible, virulent prehistoric contagion, which begins to infect the populace, causing even more fatalities. The infection precludes blowing up the &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot; or even setting it ablaze, lest the contagion spread further. It is decided to shoot a radioactive isotope into the beast&#x27;s neck wound with hopes of burning it from the inside, while at the same time neutralizing the contagion.

When the &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot; comes ashore and reaches the Coney Island amusement park, military sharpshooter Corporal Stone takes a rifle grenade loaded with a potent radioactive isotope and along with Nesbitt climbs on board the Coney Island Cyclone roller coaster. Riding the coaster to the top of the tracks to get to eye-level with the beast, he fires the isotope into its open neck wound. It thrashes about in reaction, causing the roller coaster to spark when falling to the ground, setting the amusement park ablaze. With the fire spreading rapidly, Nesbitt and Stone climb down as the park becomes engulfed in flames. The &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot; collapses and eventually dies from the isotope&#x27;s radiation poisoning.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

=== Development ===
&quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; had a production budget of around $200,000. Lourié asserted that the budget was ; Chester said it was ; and &quot;Variety&quot; reported was spent on the film.
The film was first announced in the trades on July 30, 1951, as &quot;The Monster from Beneath the Sea&quot;, one of 16 titles the newly formed Mutual Films Corporation were readying for production. This appeared exactly a week after Ray Bradbury had his short story &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, which was later anthologized under the title &quot;The Fog Horn&quot;. During preproduction, in the spring of 1952, according to Ray Harryhausen, Dietz showed him an illustration of the monster from the Ray Bradbury story published the previous year. This story was about a marine-based prehistoric dinosaur that destroys a lighthouse. A similar sequence appeared in the draft script of &quot;The Monster from Beneath the Sea&quot;. During production, Bradbury visited his friend Harryhausen at the studio and was invited to read the script. When Bradbury pointed out to the producers similarities to his short story, they quickly bought the rights to his story. When Warner Bros. bought &quot;The Monster from Beneath the Sea&quot; from Mutual over a year later, they changed the film&#x27;s title to match the story&#x27;s title. Bradbury&#x27;s name was used extensively in their promotional campaign. It also had an on-screen credit that read &quot;Suggested by &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; story by Ray Bradbury&quot;.

Eugène Lourié, Harryhausen, and Robert Smith contributed to the screenplay, adapting it from producer Jack Dietz&#x27;s initial draft. None of them were credited in this position within the film itself. A retrospective source indicated that Lourié had once said that a blacklisted screenwriter also worked on the film. It theorized that Robert Smith was that individual&#x27;s pseudonym, and this is why Smith was only credited in the script. However, a screenwriter with that name is listed in the AFI catalog with credits dating back to 1945, two years before the Hollywood blacklist. According to historian Bill Warren, the uncredited blacklisted screenwriter was Daniel James, who worked on Lourié&#x27;s &quot;The Giant Behemoth&quot; (1959) and &quot;Gorgo&quot; (1961) under the pen name Daniel Hyatt.

===Creature design and effects===
Some early pre-production conceptual sketches of the Beast showed that, at one point, it was to have a shelled head and later was to have a beak. Creature effects were assigned to Harryhausen, a protégé of King Kong co-creator Willis O&#x27;Brien. The film monster looks nothing like the &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;-type creature of the short story. It is instead a kind of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;-type prehistoric predator, though quadrupedal in stature. The monster was unlike any real carnivorous dinosaur and more closely resembled a rauisuchian. A drawing of the creature was published along with the story in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;.

According to author A. T. McKenna, at one point, there were plans to have the Beast snort flames, but this idea was dropped before production began due to budget restrictions. The concept was later used for the film&#x27;s poster and allegedly became an inspiration for Godzilla&#x27;s atomic breath.

=== Filming ===
The climactic roller coaster live-action scenes were filmed on location at the Pike in Long Beach, California, and featured the Cyclone Racer entrance ramp, ticket booth, loading platform and beach views of the structure. Split-matte, in-camera special effects by Harryhausen effectively combined the live action of the actors and the roller coaster background footage from the Pike&#x27;s parking lot with the stop-motion animation of the Beast&#x27;s destroying a shooting miniature of the coaster.

In a scene attempting to identify the &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot;, Professor Tom Nesbitt rifles through dinosaur drawings by Charles R. Knight, a man whom Harryhausen claimed as an inspiration. The dinosaur skeleton featured in the museum sequence is artificial; it was obtained from RKO Pictures&#x27; prop storage where it had been constructed for its classic comedy &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938).

=== Music ===
An original music score was composed by Michel Michelet, but when Warner Bros. purchased the film, it had a new score written by David Buttolph. Ray Harryhausen had been hoping that his film music hero Max Steiner, under contract at the time with Warner Bros., would write the film score. Steiner had written the landmark score for RKO&#x27;s &quot;King Kong&quot; in 1933. Unfortunately for Harryhausen, Steiner had too many commitments, but Buttolph composed one of his more memorable and powerful scores, setting much of the tone for giant monster film music of the 1950s.

== Release ==

Warner Bros. acquired the film for $400,000, $450,000, or $800,000 and launched a large advertising campaign for its June 1953 release. Sources differ on the exact day it was distributed that month, though &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; and the official websites of the AFI and Warner Bros suggest it was the 13th. However, many contemporaneous American newspapers from June 1953 reported the opening date as the 17th. &quot;Boxoffice&quot; listed the film&#x27;s distribution date as 27th. &quot;The 1954 Film Daily Year Book of Motion Pictures&quot; cited the 24th, which &quot;Variety&quot; stated was its New York premiere. The film had one of the widest and fastest releases of the time, planning to have most of its bookings in its first two months, opening in 1,422 theaters nationwide within the first week. Original prints of &quot;Beast&quot; were sepia toned. The film earned roughly at the North American box office and more than $5 million worldwide. It is believed to have been a sleeper hit.

The film was distributed by Daiei Film in Japan on October 17, 1954.

==Reception==

===Critical response===

According to Turner Classic Movies (TCM), &quot;The Beast&quot; was met with a mixed critical reception, but garnered unanimous praise for its special effects. In July 1953, &quot;Boxoffice&quot; analyzed that contemporary critical reviews were generally positive. &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; described the initial critical response as &quot;respectable&quot;.

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; described the film as a &quot;fantastic horror-melodrama&quot;, adding that it is a &quot;highly exciting thriller of its type&quot;. Hy Hollinger of &quot;Variety&quot; lauded Harryhausen&#x27;s effects, Lourié&#x27;s direction, and the acting of Christian and Kellaway; he also felt the script and cinematography were documentary-like. Hollinger directed criticism towards Raymond&#x27;s performance citing it as &quot;too still&quot; and &quot;unconvincing&quot;.

TCM said the review from &quot;The New York Times&quot; was &quot;lukewarm&quot;. The reviewer wrote: &quot;And though the sight of the gigantic monster rampaging through such areas as Wall Street and Coney Island sends the comparatively ant-like humans on the screen scurrying away in an understandable tizzy, none of the customers in the theater seemed to be making for the hills. On sober second thought, however, this might have been sensible&quot;.

=== Reception of the &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot; ===
The &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot; was largely panned by dinosaur experts, who felt that its depiction was unrealistic. These viewers also complained that the filmmakers should have used an actual dinosaur instead of creating a fictional one. Lourié subsequently explained that the &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot; was created because the crew agreed that a regular dinosaur would not frighten modern-day audiences.

== Legacy ==

=== Aftermath and cultural influence ===
The film&#x27;s financially successful release and RKO&#x27;s re-release of &quot;King Kong&quot; spawned the giant monster film genre of the 1950s. It is considered the first live-action film to feature a giant monster unleashed by an atomic bomb. According to numerous retrospective sources, Ishirō Honda&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954) was heavily inspired by the film and this concept. Its initial proposal was allegedly titled , and the original story by Shigeru Kayama featuring Godzilla destroying a lighthouse. However, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka claimed to have been ignorant of &quot;The Beast&quot;&#x27;s existence. Authors Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski noted how Japanese critics compared the two films but felt that &quot;Godzilla&quot; lacks direct resemblance to it. During his late life, Harryhausen expressed his belief that the original &quot;Godzilla&quot; film was a rip-off of &quot;The Beast&quot;, and allegedly disliked the Toho monster presumably due to the aftermath of the 1962 film &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;.

Harryhausen continued to gain popularity for his efforts on monster movies such as &quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea&quot; (1955) and &quot;20 Million Miles to Earth&quot; (1957). He eventually decided to venture into other genres, accepting that &quot;Godzilla&quot; and other Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; movies were making the giant monster genre &quot;tiresome&quot;. In 1958, the &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot; model was reused by Harryhausen to portray the dragon in &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot;. Likewise, Lourié later directed two productions featuring fictitious giant dinosaurs. &quot;The Giant Behemoth&quot; (1958) was a British-American co-production panned by critics for its close resemblance to &quot;The Beast&quot;; Lourié accused himself of plagiarizing from it when scripting. &quot;Gorgo&quot; (1961) is considered the British edition of a &quot;Godzilla&quot; movie or rip-off thereof.

Daiei Film later yielded the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise. The original 1965 film &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot; depicted the titular monster that was awoken by a nuclear explosion in the Arctic and later destroys a lighthouse. Before this, Daiei Film distributed the re-released edition of RKO&#x27;s &quot;King Kong&quot; in Japan in 1952, making it the first post-war release of monster movies in Japan, and these distributions presumably influenced productions of the first films of &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Gamera&quot; franchises.

The film &quot;Cloverfield&quot; (2008), which also involves a giant monster terrorizing New York City, inserts a frame from &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; (along with frames from &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;Them!&quot;) into the hand-held camera footage used throughout the film.

The film was featured in the &quot;TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Sci-Fi Adventures&quot; DVD box set along with &quot;Them!&quot;, &quot;World Without End&quot;, and &quot;Satellite in the Sky&quot; (both 1956). It was also released on standalone DVD and Blu-ray.

=== Retrospective assessment and analysis ===
Since its release, &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; has been assessed as one of the greatest monster, science fiction, and horror films of the 1950s. It was also nominated for AFI&#x27;s Top 10 Science Fiction Films list, and listed among the best B-movies of its decade by &quot;Collider&quot; and &quot;Screen Rant&quot;. 

Harryhausen&#x27;s stop-motion and special effects work in particular have continued to receive critical acclaim in retrospective reviews. Leonard Maltin cited Harryhausen&#x27;s effects in the last act.

&quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; has been analyzed as reflecting distress of the outcome of nuclear testing during the Atomic Age. Some believe that it is the first film to directly address this subject. Writers have also ofted noted how upon the bomb&#x27;s detonation in the movie, one of the characters states: &quot;Every time one of these things goes off, I feel as if we were helping to write the first chapter of a new Genesis&quot;. According to Cynthia Hendershot and Dominic Lennard, the film offers the theory that nuclear testing could result in the dominance of other lifeforms over humanity. Hendershot felt that the &quot;Rhedosaurus&quot; is a metaphor for the fears of the destruction of New York that the American public had during the 1950s.

<text>John Lawrence LeConte MD (May 13, 1825 – November 15, 1883) was an American entomologist, responsible for naming and describing approximately half of the insect taxa known in the United States during his lifetime, including some 5,000 species of beetles. He was recognized as the foremost authority on North American beetles during his career, and has been described as &quot;the father of American beetle study&quot;.

==Early life==

A member of the scientifically inclined LeConte family, John Lawrence was born in New York City, the son of naturalist John Eatton Le Conte. His mother, Mary A. H. Lawrence, died when John Lawrence was only a few months old, and he was raised by his father. Most reliable sources spell his name &quot;LeConte&quot; or &quot;Leconte&quot;, without the space used by his father, and samples of his signature show the preference for &quot;LeConte&quot;.

He graduated from Mount Saint Mary College, Emmettsburg, Maryland, in 1842, and from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, in 1846. He worked as a chemical assistant to John Torrey and after receiving his medical degree he briefy practiced medicine. He also married Helen Grier and in the same year he gave up medical practice. During the civil war he again worked as a medical inspector and received the rank of lieutenant colonel. Having inherited enough money to make himself independent, LeConte did not practice medicine professionally. Influences in his life included Louis Agassiz and Hermann Rudolph Schaum who stayed in the Leconte home.

While still in medical college, in 1844, John Lawrence traveled with his cousin Joseph LeConte to the Great Lakes. Starting at Niagara Falls, they visited Detroit and Chicago and traversed Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois before returning up the Ohio River to Pittsburgh and on to New York. John Lawrence published his first three papers on beetles that year.

==Travels==
After graduating from medical college John Lawrence LeConte made several trips west, including to California via Panama in 1849. While in San Francisco, he sent 10,000 beetles preserved in ethanol back to his father. Another 20,000 beetle specimens were lost in a fire in 1852. LeConte also traveled to Europe, Egypt and Algiers. He spent two years exploring the Colorado River, and was in Honduras for the building of the Honduras Interoceanic Railway, and in Colorado and New Mexico with the party surveying for the Kansas Pacific Railroad. He moved to Philadelphia in 1852, residing there for the rest of his life. He died in Philadelphia on November 15, 1883.

==Military service==
During the American Civil War he enlisted in the Army Medical Corps as a surgeon. He was promoted to the position of medical inspector and reached the rank of lieutenant colonel by the end of the war.

==U.S. Mint==
In 1878 he became the chief clerk (assistant director) of the United States Mint in Philadelphia. He retained that position until his death in 1883.

==Scientific societies==
LeConte was active in the scientific societies of his time, with stints as vice-president of the American Philosophical Society (1880–1883) and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1873). He was a founder of the American Entomological Society, and a charter member of the National Academy of Sciences.

==Legacy==
The genera &quot;Lecontella&quot;, &quot;Lecontellus&quot;, &quot;Lecontia&quot;, and &quot;Contia&quot; and several hundred species (mostly beetles) are named after him, including a bird, LeConte&#x27;s thrasher (&quot;Toxostoma lecontei&quot;), which he discovered while on a beetle-collecting trip to Arizona, and was named after him by George Newbold Lawrence. LeConte communicated with and collected birds and other natural history specimens for Spencer Fullerton Baird, a distant cousin and assistant director and then director of the Smithsonian Institution for a total of 39 years. In turn Baird asked other naturalists to collect beetles for LeConte.

In the 1850s, LeConte collected some crystals from a cave in Honduras being mined for bat guano. It was later found to be a new mineral that was named &quot;lecontite&quot; in his honor.
