<text>Enbridge Inc. is a multinational pipeline and energy company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Enbridge owns and operates pipelines throughout Canada and the United States, transporting crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, and also generates renewable energy. Enbridge&#x27;s pipeline system is the longest in North America and the largest oil export pipeline network in the world. Its crude oil system consists of 28,661 kilometres (17,809 miles) of pipelines. Its 38,300 kilometre (23,800 mile) natural gas pipeline system connects multiple Canadian provinces, several US states, and the Gulf of Mexico. The company was formed by Imperial Oil in 1949 as the Interprovincial Pipe Line Company Limited to transport Alberta oil to refineries. Over time, it has grown through acquisition of other existing pipeline companies and the expansion of their projects.

Enbridge has been responsible for several oil spills, including a spill on Line 3, which was the largest inland oil spill in the US. Opposition to Enbridge projects has resulted in several popular uprisings, most notably the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, and the Stop Line 3 protests.

==History==
The company was initially incorporated by Imperial Oil as Interprovincial Pipe Line Company (IPL) on April 30, 1949, after Canada&#x27;s first major oil discovery, in 1947, at Leduc, Alberta. In the same year, the company built its first oil pipeline from Leduc to Regina, Saskatchewan. In 1950, it was expanded through Gretna, Manitoba, to Superior, Wisconsin, in the United States. To operate the United States portion of the pipeline, the Lakehead Pipe Line Company (now Enbridge Energy Partners) was created. In 1953, the pipeline was expanded to Sarnia, Ontario, and in 1956 to Toronto and Buffalo, New York.

In 1953, IPL was listed on the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges. In 1983, IPL built the Norman Wells pipeline and joined Frontier Pipeline Company. In 1986, through a series of stakes exchanges, IPL gained control of Home Oil and in 1988, it changed its name to Interhome Energy Inc. In 1991, it changed its name to Interprovincial Pipe Line Inc.

In 1992, Interprovincial Pipe Line Inc. was acquired by Interprovincial Pipe Line System Inc., which changed its name to IPL Energy Inc. in 1994, after the acquisition of Consumers&#x27; Gas (now Enbridge Gas Inc.) and diversification into the gas distribution business. In addition, it acquired stakes in AltaGas Services and the electric utility of Cornwall, Ontario. Through the 1990s, the company expanded its gas pipeline network and acquired a stake in the Chicap oil pipeline. It also built the Athabasca Pipeline from northeastern Alberta to the main pipeline system. In 1995, the company expanded its activities outside of North America by taking a stake in the Ocensa pipeline. This stake was sold in 2009. IPL Energy became Enbridge Inc in 1998. The Enbridge name is a portmanteau from &quot;energy&quot; and &quot;bridge&quot;.

In the 2000s, Enbridge introduced several large projects. Enbridge made their first investment into renewable energy in 2002 with the purchase of a wind farm. In 2006, it announced the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines Project from Athabasca to Kitimat, British Columbia. The same year, it announced the Alberta Clipper pipeline project from Hardisty, Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin, to connect oil sands production area with the existing network. This pipeline became operational in 2010.

In 2009, Enbridge bought the Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant and expanded it up to 80 MW, which was the world&#x27;s largest photovoltaic power station at that time.

In January 2017, Enbridge acquired Midcoast Energy Partners for $170 million in cash, and later in 2018, ArcLight acquired Midcoast Operating, L.P. from Enbridge for $1.1 billion.

Enbridge released its first annual sustainability report in 2001, and in November 2020, Enbridge expanded its environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals and targets. The company aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with an interim target to reduce emissions intensity by 35% by 2030. That same year, President and CEO Al Monaco said that renewable power is now &quot;the fourth Enbridge platform.&quot; Enbridge&#x27;s ESG goals also aim to diversify its workforce with 28% representation from racial and ethnic groups and 40% from women by 2025.  

In 2021, Enbridge was recognized as one of Canada&#x27;s top 100 employers for the 18th time, and as one of Canada&#x27;s best diversity employers for the seventh time.

In September 2023, it was announced  Enbridge had agreed to acquire East Ohio Gas, Questar Gas, and Public Service Co. of North Carolina, from Dominion Energy for a total enterprise value worth $14 billion. The acquisition will result in Enbridge being the largest natural gas utility franchise in North America.

===Merger with Spectra Energy===
On September 6, 2016, Enbridge agreed to buy Spectra Energy in an all-stock deal valued at about $28 billion.
Spectra, headquartered in Houston, Texas, operated in three key areas of the natural gas industry: transmission and storage, distribution, and gathering and processing. Spectra was formed in late 2006 as a spin-off from Duke Energy. Spectra owned the Texas Eastern Pipeline (TETCo), a major natural gas pipeline transporting gas from the Gulf of Mexico coast in Texas to the New York City area; TETCo was one of the largest pipeline systems in the United States. Spectra also operated three oil pipelines, numerous other gas pipelines and was proposing to build still 3 more gas pipelines in the U.S. The merger was completed on February 27, 2017.

==Operations==
===Crude oil and liquids pipelines===
The company is the largest transporter of crude oil in Canada with 3 million barrels per day of oil and liquids. The Enbridge Pipeline System is the world&#x27;s longest crude oil and liquids pipeline system, with 27,564 km (17,127 mi) of active crude pipeline in both Canada and the United States. This pipeline network delivers 3 million barrels of oil per day.

Enbridge delivered more than 3.77 billion barrels of crude oil in 2020, and more than 29.5 billion barrels over the past decade, from 2011 through 2020 inclusive.

Enbridge has several new capacities and expansion projects, including the expansion of the Alberta Clipper, replacing of Line 6B, reversal of Line 9 and others. Its Light Oil Market Access initiative is a project to deliver light crude oil from North Dakota and Western Canada to refineries in Ontario, Quebec, and the U.S. Midwest. Eastern Access, including a reversal of Line 9, is a project to deliver oil to Western Canada and Bakken to refineries in Eastern Canada and the midwest and eastern U.S. Western Gulf Coast Access, including reversal and expansion of the Seaway Pipeline and the Flanagan South Pipeline, is a plan to connect Canadian heavy oil supply to refineries along the Gulf Coast of the United States.

Enbridge&#x27;s oil pipelines cross North America, with 13,833 km (8,672 mi) of active pipe in the United States and 13,681 km (8500 mi) of active pipe in Canada. The list below outlines eight of those lines.

* Line 1 is a 1,767 km (1,098 mi) pipeline that starts in Enbridge&#x27;s Edmonton Terminal in Alberta, and runs to its Superior Terminal in Wisconsin. On average, this pipeline delivers 237,000 barrels of light crude, natural gas liquids, and refined products daily.
* Line 2A is a 966 km (600 mi) pipeline that runs from an Enbridge terminal in Edmonton, Alberta, to its Cromer Terminal in Manitoba.

* Alberta clipper Pipeline (Line 67) is a 1,790 km (1,112 mi) pipeline that runs from Hardisty, Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin. An average of 800,000 barrels of heavy crude oil is moved through this pipeline per day. 
* Southern Lights Pipeline (Line 13) is a 2,560 km (1,591 mi) pipeline that runs from Manhattan, Illinois to the Edmonton terminal. This pipeline carries on average, 180,000 barrels of diluent per day.

===Natural gas pipelines===
Enbridge&#x27;s pipelines transport 20% of the natural gas consumed in the United States. It owns and operates Canada&#x27;s largest natural gas distribution network, providing distribution services in Ontario and Quebec. Union Gas in Ontario now fully operates under Enbridge Gas Inc. In Quebec, Enbridge has interest ownership in Gazifère.

Enbridge builds, owns and operates a network of natural gas transmission pipelines across North America, connecting the continent&#x27;s prolific natural gas supply to major markets in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and further abroad.

Enbridge&#x27;s natural gas network currently covers 38,375 km (23,850 mi) across five Canadian provinces, 30 U.S. states, and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, transporting roughly 16.2 Bcf (billions of cubic feet per day) of natural gas.

==== Canadian gas transmission: major assets ====

* B.C. Pipeline (2.9 Bcf/d): this pipeline system runs from Fort Nelson in northeastern British Columbia to the U.S. border at Huntington-Sumas stretching 2,858 km (1,776 mi). It transports 60 percent of all natural gas produced in B.C., and provides natural gas service to the province as well as US states including Oregon, Idaho, and Washington.
* Alliance Pipeline (1.6bcf/d): running 3,848 km (2,391 mi) from northern British Columbia across the U.S.-Canada border to Aux Sable gas processing plant in Channahon, Illinois. Enbridge owns 50 percent of the Alliance Pipeline and 42% of the Aux Sable processing facility.

*Texas Eastern (11.69 Bcf/d): delivers natural gas from Texas and the Gulf Coast through 8.83 miles of pipeline to markets in the Northeastern UW including New York, Boston, and Pittsburgh. 
*Valley Crossing Pipeline (2.6 Bcf/d): placed into service in November 2018, this pipeline moves Texas sourced natural gas to a Mexico State-owned power utility, the Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE).
*Vector Pipeline: this pipeline acts as a connector for other pipelines including the Alliance pipeline and NEXUS Gas Transmission to the Union Gas Dawn Hub.

==== DCP Midstream ====
DCP Midstream is a joint venture between Enbridge and Phillips 66. Phillips 66 is one of the largest petroleum services companies in the US, owning and operating 39 natural gas plants and 51,000 miles of gathering pipe. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DCP operates a portfolio of natural gas gathering, logistics, marketing and processing services across nine states.

=== Renewable energy generation ===

Enbridge made its first investment into renewable energy in 2002 with the purchase of a wind farm. To date Enbridge has invested in 23 wind farms, 7 solar energy projects, 5 waste heat recovery facilities, 1 geothermal project, 1 power transmission project and 1 hydroelectric facility.

Enbridge has a growing interest in European offshore wind energy, and its renewable assets are part of the company&#x27;s plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

In 2020, President and CEO Al Monaco said that renewable power is now &quot;the fourth Enbridge platform.&quot;
====Power transmission====
In February, 2020, Enbridge sold its shares of Montana-Alberta Tie-Line (MATL) to Berkshire Hathaway Energy. The MATL project is a 300-megawatt (MW), 230-kilovolt (kV) electrical transmission line allowing movement of power between Alberta and Montana. The MATL project, which was placed in service the fall of 2013, supports ongoing development of a rich wind-powered generation resource and allows electrical energy to flow in both directions. The transmission line is 210 miles (345 km) long and runs between the Lethbridge, Alberta area and the Great Falls, Montana area. Roughly one third of the line is in Canada and two thirds in the U.S.

=== Natural gas utility ===
Enbridge Gas Inc. was formed on January 1, 2019, with the combination of Enbridge Gas Distribution and Union Gas. Its network consists of 5,471 km of gas transmission lines, 66,787 km of gas distribution service lines, and 78,214 km of gas distribution main lines.

They deliver to over 15 million people in Ontario and Quebec through 3.8 million residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional meter connections and distribute roughly 2.3 bcf/d of natural gas. Additionally, in southwestern Ontario they have the largest integrated underground storage facility in Canada, and one of North America&#x27;s top natural gas trading hubs.

Enbridge&#x27;s natural gas distribution also includes interest ownership in two additional natural gas distributors. This includes Gazfiére, serving people in Outaouais region of Quebec, and Ènergir LP, a company that operates gas transmission, gas distribution, and power distribution throughout Quebec and Vermont.

In September 2023, Enbridge agreed to acquire three natural gas utility companies from Dominion Energy for $14 billion. The companies include the East Ohio Gas Company, Questar Gas Company, and the Public Service Company of North Carolina. These companies serve 3 million customers in the states of Ohio, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, and North Carolina. Upon completion of the acquisition, Enbridge Gas Inc. will become the largest natural gas utility in North America supplying 9 bcf/d to 7 million customers.

== Oil spills and violations ==
Enbridge&#x27;s pipeline was responsible for the largest inland oil spill in the United States in 1991, when of oil ruptured from a buried pipeline in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, spilling crude into a wetland and a tributary of the Mississippi River.

Using data from Enbridge&#x27;s own reports, the Polaris Institute calculated that 804 spills occurred on Enbridge pipelines between 1999 and 2010. These spills released approximately of crude oil into the environment.

On July 4, 2002, an Enbridge pipeline ruptured in a marsh near the town of Cohasset, Minnesota, in Itasca County, spilling of crude oil. In an attempt to keep the oil from contaminating the Mississippi River, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources set a controlled burn that lasted for one day and created a smoke plume about high and long.

In 2006, there were 67 reportable spills totaling on Enbridge&#x27;s energy and transportation and distribution system; in 2007 there were 65 reportable spills totalling . On March 18, 2006, approximately of crude oil were released when a pump failed at Enbridge&#x27;s Willmar terminal in Saskatchewan. According to Enbridge, roughly half the oil was recovered.

On January 1, 2007, an Enbridge pipeline that runs from Superior, Wisconsin to near Whitewater, Wisconsin cracked open and spilled ~ of crude oil onto farmland and into a drainage ditch. The same pipeline was struck by construction crews on February 2, 2007, in Rusk County, Wisconsin, spilling ~ of crude, of which about were recovered. Some of the oil filled a hole more than deep and contaminated the local water table.

In April 2007, roughly of crude oil spilled into a field downstream of an Enbridge pumping station near Glenavon, Saskatchewan.

In January 2009, an Enbridge pipeline leaked about of oil southeast of Fort McMurray at the company&#x27;s Cheecham Terminal tank farm. Most of the spilled oil was contained within berms but about 1% of the oil, about , sprayed into the air and coated nearby snow and trees.

On January 2, 2010, Enbridge&#x27;s Line 2 ruptured near Neche, North Dakota, releasing about 3,784 barrels of crude oil, of which was recovered. In April 2010, an Enbridge pipeline ruptured spilling more than of oil in Virden, Manitoba. This oil leaked into the Boghill Creek, which eventually connects to the Assiniboine River.

In the July 2010 Kalamazoo River oil spill, a leaking pipeline spilled more than of oil sands crude oil into Talmadge Creek leading to the Kalamazoo River in southwest Michigan on July 26, near Marshall, Michigan. A United States Environmental Protection Agency update of the Kalamazoo River spill concluded the pipeline rupture &quot;caused the largest inland oil spill in Midwest history&quot; and reported the cost of the cleanup at $36.7 million (US) as of November 14, 2011. PHMSA raised concerns in a Corrective Action Order (CAO) about numerous anomalies that had been detected on this pipeline by internal line inspection tools, yet Enbridge had failed to check a number of those anomalies in the field. The Michigan spill affected more than of waterways and wetlands and about 320 people reported symptoms from crude oil exposure. The National Transportation Safety Board said at $800 million, it was the costliest onshore spill cleanup in U.S. history. The NTSB found Enbridge knew of a defect in the pipeline five years before it burst. In June 2013, a Kalamazoo man lodged himself into an Enbridge pipeline in Marshall, MI to protest Enbridge&#x27;s lack of accountability for the 2010 spill and to encourage landowners along Enbridge&#x27;s Line 6B expansion to offer increased resistance to construction in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP Photo/EPA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Enbridge completed cleanup of the river per the EPA&#x27;s order.

On September 9, 2010, a broken water line caused a rupture on Enbridge&#x27;s Line 6A pipeline near Romeoville, Illinois, releasing an estimated of oil into the surrounding area.

On June 22, 2013, Enbridge subsidiary Athabasca pipelines reported a pipeline leak of approximately 750 barrels of light synthetic crude oil from Line 37 near Enbridge&#x27;s Cheecham, Alberta, terminal about southeast of Fort McMurray. The 17-kilometre-long, 12-inch diameter pipe was constructed in 2006 and links the Long Lake oilsands upgrader to the Cheetham terminal as part of Enbridge&#x27;s Athabasca system. Unusually heavy rainfall in the region, also responsible for the 2013 Alberta floods, may have caused &quot;ground movement on the right-of way that may have impacted the pipeline.&quot; Enbridge&#x27;s Athabasca (Line 19) shares a portion of right of way with Line 37 and Enbridge&#x27;s Wood Buffalo/Waupisoo (Line 75/18), a major part of the network that serves Alberta&#x27;s oilsands. All three lines were closed down as a precautionary measure. Operations between Hardisty and Cheecham were restored on June 23 when Enbridge&#x27;s Athabasca pipeline (Line 19) was restored to service.

On July 1, 2013, WWMT News in Michigan reported that the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality had issued a citation against Enbridge for contamination of North Ore Creek by an Enbridge pipeline maintenance activity.

On January 30, 2017, a road crew in Texas punctured the Seaway S-1 crude oil pipeline, which is jointly owned by Enterprise Products Partners and Enbridge through the joint venture Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. Two days later, it was unclear how much oil had spilled over the nearby Highway 121 northeast of Dallas. After the incident, supply concerns reportedly helped push &quot;oil prices 2% higher in early trading to nearly $54 a barrel.&quot;

On October 9, 2018, Enbridge&#x27;s Westcoast Pipeline exploded in Shelley, British Columbia, sparking a massive fireball and leading to shortages of natural gas throughout British Columbia.

On November 11, 2024 Enbridge&#x27;s Line 6 pipeline spilled 69,300 gallons of crude oil underground. According to Enbridge, the spilt oil was a result of a faulty connection on a pump transfer pipe. An enbridge technician was the first to discover the spill in Oakland, Jefferson County, Wisconsin. Enbridge in response started soil removal in polluted areas from the spill.

==Protests==
In May 2012, West Coast First Nations members and supporters protested near Enbridge&#x27;s Annual Shareholder&#x27;s meeting, against the proposed Northern Gateway Project and on May 31, 2012, the Vancouver Observer reported about 40 protesters outside the Canadian Oil and Gas Export Summit, protesting the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Project.

On July 17, 2012, a group calling itself &quot;We are the Kalamazoo&quot; protested against Enbridge&#x27;s response to the Kalamazoo spill and its plans to construct the line 6B pipeline. This protest was on the second anniversary of the Kalamazoo spill.

On November 12, 2012, the Lansing State Journal reported that the head of the Line 6B Pipeline project stated that he had never seen as much organized landowner resistance despite 30 years in the pipeline industry. They noted that this was probably because of the 2010 Kalamazoo River spill.

In May 2013, Hamilton area residents protested the reversal of flow in Line 9 and temporarily closed Ontario Highway 6. Later that year, on June 6, 2013, a group called Hamilton 350 sent a letter of complaint to the Hamilton (Ontario) police service (HPS) for accepting over $44,000 in donations from Enbridge. The letter questions whether police officers would be impartial during any anti-Enbridge protests, given the donation.

On June 26, 2013, Hamilton Police arrested at least 10 people who occupied an Enbridge compound for six days to protest the expansion of Enbridge&#x27;s Line 9 and intent to ship diluted bitumen through the line.

On July 22, 2013, a group of protesters locked themselves to equipment at an Enbridge pipeline construction site in Stockbridge, Michigan. Protesters stated that they had to take matters into their own hands given that state regulators were failing the public, &quot;We felt that there was no other option.&quot;

A September 16, 2013, &quot;Inside Climate News&quot; report by journalist David Hasemeyer describes how many Michigan landowners are concerned about the safety of new Enbridge pipeline being laid within a few feet of their homes, and the lack of regulations for how close a pipeline can be constructed to an existing home. The article quotes Richard Kuprewicz, President of an engineering consulting company and an adviser to Pipeline Hazardous Materials Administration: &quot;Clearly the pipeline safety regulations aren&#x27;t adequate in this area and the siting regulations aren&#x27;t adequate,&quot; Kuprewicz said. &quot;It&#x27;s a bad combination.&quot;

In September 2016, a group of Native Americans protested the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which Enbridge had announced plans to acquire a portion of in a $2 billion deal.

In November 2020, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer revoked a 1953 easement for an Enbridge pipeline connecting two parts of the Great Lakes through the Straits of Mackinac.

In June 2021, Enbridge resumed construction on the Line 3 replacement project in Northern Minnesota after taking a brief planned break. Enbridge&#x27;s plans to expand its Line 3 pipeline in Minnesota along a new route have been met with prolonged resistance from Native communities and activists calling themselves water protectors.

In January 2022, a group of about 400 met in front of a Bank of America location in Austin to protest Enbridge&#x27;s plans to expand the Moda Ingleside Energy Center onto historic Karankawa land in Corpus Christi, Texas.

In September, 2023, in a trial flawed by numerous protocol breaches on the part of the prosecution and local authorities, Mylene Vialard was found guilty of felony obstruction. According to the article, Vialard was among more than a thousand arrests by Minnesota law enforcement – which along with other agencies received at least $8.6m in payments from Enbridge.

In 2024, the film &quot;Bad River&quot; was released. The film documented Enbridge&#x27;s trespassing on the Bad River reservation with Line 5 and the local community&#x27;s struggle to get the pipeline removed. It also covered how Enbridge attempted to influence the Bad River tribal elections.

== Technology and innovation ==
Enbridge has two Technology and Innovation labs. In January 2019, the first lab opened in Calgary, Alberta. In April 2019, the second lab opened in Houston, Texas. The labs use industrial predictive algorithms, machine learning, and sentiment analysis to find efficiencies within the company and help improve safety and reliability of their pipeline infrastructure.

The labs have developed ways to get sensor data from pipelines, helping to improve flows of natural gas and crude oil terminals. Additionally, the labs have helped enhance pipeline leak detection, and ensure better maintenance schedules. For renewable energy projects, the labs have developed different ways to reposition wind turbine blades to help maximize wind power generation.

It operates over 100 care facilities and is based in Markham, Ontario. The company operates retirement residences and long-term care facilities under the Extendicare, Esprit Lifestyle and ParaMed brands, with 23,000 employees.

In 2006, the company became a real estate investment trust (REIT) and began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) under the symbol EXE.UN on November 10, 2006. In 2012, the company completed its conversion from an income trust structure named Extendicare Real Estate Investment Trust to a corporate structure named Extendicare Inc.

Extendicare owns and operates dozens of long-term care and retirement facilities, with the majority in Ontario and 11% in Alberta. The company has a number of significant subsidiaries and divisions, including ParaMed, Esprit Lifestyle Communities, Extendicare Assist, and its Purchasing Partner Network division, SGP.

From January to September 2020, Extendicare paid out about CA$29 million to shareholders. During the same period, Extendicare&#x27;s ParaMed division received CA$82.2 million from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). The company said that government funds went to LTC workers directly, not towards dividends.

==Board of directors==
Michael Guerriere has been the President and CEO of Extendicare since 2018. Prior to that, Guerriere was CMO and VP at TELUS Health from 2002 to 2018, and with Courtyard Group, which was acquired by TELUS Health in 2002.

Hibben, Brent Houlden, Donna E. Kingelin, Samir Manji, and Al Mawani.

==Segments and subsidiaries==
According to its 2020 Annual Report, the company earned a total of CA$1,155.3 million in revenue in 2020. Its segments include long-term care—which generated a revenue of CA$715.6 million, retirement living, home health care, &quot;contract services, consulting and group purchasing&quot;, and corporate activities, among others.

By 2020, most of Extendicare&#x27;s LTC and retirement facilities were in two provinces – about 77% in Ontario and 11% in Alberta. In 2020, Extendicare owned and operated 58 LTC facilities, and Esprit Lifestyle Communities owned and operated 11 retirement living facilities. Through the Extendicare Assist division, the company also provided 52 facilities with contract services. The Purchasing Partner Network division—SGP—contracts purchases of &quot;food, capital equipment, furnishings, cleaning and nursing supplies, and office products&quot;.

==COVID-19 pandemic==
The company had &quot;no plan to deal with&quot; the coronavirus and in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, 80 people in the care of Extendicare died &quot;after contracting COVID-19&quot;. The company spent CA$300,000 of its &quot;own money on COVID-19, while distributing over $10,000,000 to shareholders during the pandemic&quot;, according to its May 28, 2020 Annual General Meeting.

During the pandemic—from January to September 30, 2020—revenues from the company&#x27;s long-term-care facilities rose to CA$523.4 million, compared to CA$477.1 million in the same period in 2019.

===Extendicare Parkside===
By December 2020, 38 residents with COVID-19 had died in Parkside Extendicare in Regina, Saskatchewan. The outbreak was declared on November 20, 2020, and two weeks later, there were 50 residents that had tested positive for COVID-19. By March 21, it was confirmed by Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) that 41 people had died at Extendicare Parkside from the virus and over 200 residents and staff tested had positive for COVID-19 during the outbreak. In response to the second wave Extendicare Parkside outbreak, the Provincial Ombudsman began an investigation at the request of the Government of Saskatchewan. On December 9, SHA into a co-management agreement with Parkside Extendicare which lasted into 2021.

By March 2020, families of those who died in Extendicare facilities in Saskatchewan, represented by Regina-based lawyer Tony Merchant, prepared to file a class-action lawsuit for substandard care in Extendicare&#x27;s long-term care facilities. According to Merchant, of the 117 people who died from COVID-19 in the province&#x27;s care homes from the beginning of the outbreak to the middle of March 2020, 35% were in Extendicare facilities when they died.
On October 12th, 2022, the Saskatchewan Health Authority and the ECI group formally agreed that the SHA would assume responsibility for five Saskatchewan based Long Term Care Extendicare facilities. Details of the agreement include the transition of nearly 1,300 Extendicare staff to the SHA and the purchase of all five properties (one in Saskatoon, one in Moose Jaw and three in Regina). 

===Financial support to LTC facilities===
The Ontario Ministry of LTC provided COVID funding of CA$398.0 million, &quot;which included $268.0 million in funding for COVID prevention and containment efforts&quot;. According to their 2020 annual report, they received CA$6.6 million in the spring of 2021 for the FY 2020.

According to a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; analysis of Extendicare&#x27;s 2020 financial statements, in the first 3 quarters ending in September 2020, this for-profit company paid out nearly CA$29 million to shareholders in dividends at the same time that ParaMed received CA$82.2 million in federal wage subsidies through the program for front-line workers, the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). The &quot;Star&quot; investigation included the three major for-profit LTC providers, Sienna Senior Living, Chartwell Retirement Residences, as well as Extendicare. The companies said that the CEWS grants went directly to their frontline workers and were not to pay dividends.

===Class-action lawsuits and regulatory actions===
There have been several COVID-related lawsuits filed against Extendicare facilities.

These lawsuits include an October 2020 CA$600,000 class action lawsuit with multiple defendants against multiple homes and levels of government, a second CA$210 class action lawsuit alleging &quot;gross negligence&quot; filed in October 2020, regarding one of Extendicare&#x27;s LTC facilities—later amended to include claims against 35 Extendicare&#x27;s operations.

In November 2020, the Ontario government, under Premier Doug Ford passed Bill 218, Supporting Ontario&#x27;s Recovery Act—retroactive to March 17, 2020—which provides some liability protections to individuals, corporations, or other entities, including LTC corporations, against COVID-19-related legal claims that limit claimants ability to win a lawsuit &quot;except in certain circumstances&quot;. Claimants must prove that an individual, corporation, or other entity acted in &quot;gross negligence&quot;, not in a &quot;good faith&quot; or &quot;honest&quot; effort to comply with public health guidance and laws relating to COVID-19.

It had no domestic holdings. In September, 2005, the company announced that it had a plan in place to move towards production wells in Algeria, driving the share price upwards.

Common shares of First Calgary Petroleums Ltd. used to trade on the Alternative Investments Market (AIM) market of the London Stock Exchange under the symbol FPL and on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol FCP.

On November 21, 2008, ENI S.p.A. completed its acquisition of First Calgary for $923 million in Canadian funds, giving Italy&#x27;s ENI group better access to reserves under First Calgary&#x27;s control in Algeria.

<doc id="898456" wikidata="Q489529" url="?curid=898456" title="Styrbjörn the Strong">
<text>Styrbjörn the Strong ( ; died ) according to late Norse sagas was a son of the Swedish king Olof Björnsson, and a nephew of Olof&#x27;s co-ruler and successor Eric the Victorious, who defeated and killed Styrbjörn at the Battle of Fyrisvellir. As with many figures in the sagas, doubts have been cast on his existence, but he is mentioned in a roughly contemporaneous skaldic poem about the battle. According to legend, his original name was &quot;Björn&quot;, and &quot;Styr-&quot;, which was added when he had grown up, was an epithet meaning that he was restless, controversially forceful and violent.

==Prose retellings==
Most of what is extant about Styrbjörn is found in the short &quot;Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa&quot;. Parts of his story are also retold in &quot;Eyrbyggja saga&quot;, Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (book 10), &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot; and &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;. He is also mentioned in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; (several times), and in &quot;Yngvars saga víðförla&quot;, where Ingvar the Far-Travelled is compared to his kinsman Styrbjörn. Oddr Snorrason also mentions him in &quot;Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar&quot; (around 1190), writing that Styrbjörn was defeated through magic. In modern days, he is also the hero of a novel called &quot;Styrbiorn the Strong&quot; by English author E. R. Eddison (1926), and he is featured in &quot;The Long Ships&quot;, by Frans G Bengtsson.

==Contemporaneous poetry==
The extant poetry on Styrbjörn is found in &quot;Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa&quot;, where the following &quot;lausavísa&quot; (about 985) mentions him:

: The Jótar were not willing to pay tribute for ships before the beasts of Strǫnd &lt;river&gt; [SHIPS] of Styrbjǫrn stood by the coast. Now the lord of Denmark [DANISH KING = Haraldr] has joined the troop of warriors; he lives oppressed by fate, deprived of lands and people.

The contemporary skald Þórvaldr Hjaltason also described the Battle of Fyrisvellir in the following pair of &quot;lausavísur&quot;, for which Eric rewarded him with two rings both worht a half mark, one for each stanza:

: &quot;Guardian of the sun of battles [SWORD &gt; WARRIOR], let every one of the horses of the evening-rider [TROLL-WOMAN &gt; WOLVES] who is hungry go west to Fýrisvǫllr, to the enclosure of the stronghold. There Eiríkr has cut down the storm-logs of the sun of the ski of the river [SHIP &gt; SHIELD &gt; BATTLE &gt; WARRIORS] before wolves in the tumult of spears [BATTLE]; that is without exaggeration.&quot;

: &quot;The vikings’ surge from their home to Sweden turned out afterwards [to be] disastrous for the wealth-demanders of the bed of fish of the mountains [SNAKES &gt; GOLD &gt; MEN]. Only that part of them survives, that ran away; they had the more numerous force; it was good to catch Hundingr’s army.&quot;

&quot;Hundmargs&quot; (&quot;of a myriad&quot;) in the second verse has also been read as &quot;Hundings&quot;, referring to a chief of the Jomsvikings named Hunding, but there is no other record of such a historical figure, so the argument that this disproves Styrbjörn&#x27;s historical existence has been generally set aside in favour of the evidence of the other contemporary poem.

==&quot;Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa&quot;==

&quot;Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa&quot; (&#x27;the tale of Styrbjörn the Swedish Champion&#x27;), preserved in the Flatey Book, is the source that contains the most material about Styrbjörn.

According to the tale, Styrbjörn, who was originally called Björn, was the son of Olof, a brother of King Eric, who died of poisoning when Björn was still a young boy. When he was 12 years old, he asked his uncle King Eric for his birthright, but was denied the co-rulership until he turned 16. One day he got into a fight with and killed a courtier, who had hit him on the nose with a drinking horn.

When he was 16, the Thing decided that he was not fit to be king, and instead appointed a man of low birth. His uncle Eric did not want him to stay at home, because of his violent nature and the complaints from the free farmers, so he gave Björn 60 well equipped longships, whereupon the frustrated boy took his sister Gyrid and left. Eric also called him &quot;Styrbjörn&quot;, adding &quot;Styr-&quot; because of his nephew&#x27;s unruly and quarrelsome nature.

He ravaged the shores of the Baltic Sea and when he was twenty, took the stronghold of Jomsborg from its founder Palnetoke and became the ruler of the Jomsvikings. After some time he allied himself with the Danish king Harald Bluetooth and had his sister Gyrid married to him. Styrbjörn married Harald&#x27;s daughter Tyra Haraldsdotter whom he was given by Harald for conquering Jomsborg.

Harald gave him even more warriors and now Styrbjörn set about trying to take the throne of Sweden. He sailed with a huge force which included 200 Danish longships in addition to his own Jomsvikings. When they arrived at Föret (Old Norse &quot;Fyris&quot;) in Uppland, he burnt the ships in order to force his men to fight to the end. However, the Danish force changed its mind and returned to Denmark. Styrbjörn marched alone with his Jomsvikings to Gamla Uppsala. His uncle, however, was prepared and had sent for reinforcements from all directions.

During the first two days, the battle was even. The latter evening, Eric went to the statue of Odin at the Temple at Uppsala, where he made a sacrifice. He promised Odin that if he won the battle, he would belong to Odin and arrive at Valhalla ten years from then. The next day, Eric threw his spear over the enemy and said, &quot;I sacrifice you all to Odin&quot;. Styrbjörn and his sworn men stayed and died.

==&quot;Eyrbyggja saga&quot;==

The &quot;Eyrbyggja saga&quot; has a short summary of Styrbjörn&#x27;s career in connection with one of its protagonists:
==&quot;Hervarar saga&quot;==

The &quot;Hervarar saga &quot; gives an even shorter summary of Styrbjörn&#x27;s story and his battle with his uncle Eric:
==&quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot;==

The &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot; recounts that Styrbjörn was the son of the Swedish king Olaf. When Harald Bluetooth ruled Denmark, Styrbjörn was making war in the east (&quot;í hernaði í Austrveg&quot;) and then came to Denmark where he took Harald captive. Harald gave his daughter Tyra to Styrbjörn and joined him on his expedition to Sweden. On arrival, Styrbjörn set his own ships on fire, but when Harald saw that Styrbjörn no longer had any ships he sailed back out onto Lake Mälaren (&quot;Löginn&quot;) and returned to Denmark. Styrbjörn fought his uncle Eric on the Fyrisvellir and he fell together with most of his men. Some of his men fled and this the Swedes called the &quot;Fyriselta&quot;, the chase of the Fyris.

==&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==

The Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus tells a more pro-Danish version in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Book 10). According to him, Styrbjörn was the son of the Swedish king Björn. Styrbjörn had an uncle named Olaf, whose son Eric had taken the Swedish kingdom from Styrbjörn. Styrbjörn came to Harald Bluetooth, bringing his sister Gyrithe with him, and humbly asked Harald for help. Harald decided to befriend Styrbjörn and Harald offered his sister Gyrithe to be Stybjörn&#x27;s wife. Harald then conquered the land of the Slavs and took the stronghold Julin (Jomsborg), which he gave to Styrbjörn to command with a strong force. Styrbjörn and his force (the Jomsvikings) dominated the seas, winning many victories, and they were more beneficial to Denmark than any force on land would have been. Among the warriors were Bue, Ulf, Karlsevne and Sigvald.

Styrbjörn wanted revenge and asked Harald for help to take the throne of Sweden. Harald wanted to help Styrbjörn and to this end he sailed to Halland, but was informed that the German emperor Otto had attacked Jutland, and Harald was more eager to defend his own country than to attack another one. When Harald had driven away the Germans, Styrbjörn had already rashly departed with his own force for Sweden, where he fell.

==Alleged descendants==
In the 18th century, Danish historian Jacob Langebek proposed that Styrbjörn and Tyra were the parents of Thorkel Sprakalegg, who was father of Ulf the Earl and of Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, wife of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and thus grandfather of kings Sweyn II of Denmark and Harold Godwinson of England. The earliest known source which says anything about the father of Thorkell Sprakalegg was the chronicle of John of Worcester, who says that &#x27;Spraclingus&#x27; was son of &#x27;Urso&#x27;, (Latin for bear) which would be Bjorn. Both Saxo Grammaticus and &quot;Gesta Antecessorum Comitis Gualdevi&quot; derive Thorkel from the mating of a bear with a noblewoman, Saxo relating that they produced a son named for his father (i.e. named Bjorn), who was in turn father of &#x27;Thrugillus, called Sprageleg&#x27;, while the &quot;Gesta&quot; tells a similar story but turns the Urso, father of &#x27;Spratlingus&#x27; (sic) in John of Worcester&#x27;s pedigree into the actual bear involved. Langebek suggested that Saxo&#x27;s tale of a &#x27;Wild&#x27; Björn, father of Thorkel, was an allegorical reference to Styrbjörn. Otto Brenner, in his accounting of the descendants of Gorm the Old, rejects Thorkill as son of Styrbjörn and Thyra.

<text>Ashford Town (Middlesex) Football Club are a football club based in Stanwell, Surrey, England. The club are currently members of the and usually play at the Robert Parker Stadium in Short Lane, but are groundsharing at Leg O&#x27;Mutton Field in Cobham for the 2024–25 season. They are affiliated to both the Middlesex FA and the Surrey FA.

==History==
The club was established in 1958 as Ashford Albion and joined Division Two of the Hounslow &amp; District League. They finished second in their first season, earning promotion to Division One. They finished as runners-up again the following season, and were promoted to the Premier Division, adopting their current name in 1964. However, the club pulled out the Premier Division during the 1964–65 season, resulting in their record being expunged. The following season the first team took over from the reserves in Division Two.

The club finished third in Division Two in 1965–66, resulting in promotion to Division One. After finishing as runners-up in Division One the following season, the club joined the Premier Division B of the Surrey Intermediate League (Western) for the 1967–68 season. They finished fourth in their first season, earning promotion to Premier Division A. After claiming the runners-up spot in 1972–73, they won the division in 1974–75.

Ashford became founder members of the Surrey Premier League in 1982. In 1989–90 they were league runners-up and won the Surrey Premier Cup, beating Farnham Town Reserves 3–0 in the final. In 1990 they were formally renamed Ashford Town (Middlesex) to avoid confusion with the Kent club which previously shared the same name, but are now named Ashford United. In the same year they joined the Combined Counties League. They finished as runners-up in 1993–94, and won the league the following season. They went on to win the league in each of the next three seasons, and again in 1999–2000 (a season in which they also won the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup), after which they were promoted to Division Three of the Isthmian League.

After finishing third in their first season in Division Three, they were promoted to Division Two. In 2002, they were moved to Division One South as a result of league reorganisation and, in 2004, switched to the Western Division of the Southern League. In 2005–06, they finished second in the division, and were promoted, being placed in the Isthmian League Premier Division. In 2006–07 they won the Isthmian League Cup and, in 2008–09, the Surrey Senior Cup. At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club were relegated and placed in Division One Central of the Southern League; although they were offered a late reprieve from relegation after Merthyr Tydfil were liquidated, the club declined to take it and started the 2010–1 season in Division One Central.

In 2011–12 the club won both the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup (beating Northwood on penalties after a 4–4 draw) and the Aldershot Senior Cup (defeating Badshot Lea 3–1 in the final). The 2013–14 saw the club finish bottom of Division One Central, resulting in relegation back to the Combined Counties League. After finishing third in the Premier Division in their first season back in the league, they were runners-up in 2015–16 and were promoted back to Division One Central of the Southern League. The following season saw the club win the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup for the third time, beating Wealdstone 2–1 in the final. At the end of the 2017–18 season they were transferred to the South Central Division of the Isthmian League.

<text>Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited is a Canadian financial holding company based in Toronto, Ontario, engaged in property, casualty, insurance and reinsurance, investment management, and insurance claims management. The company operates primarily through several subsidiaries, including Allied World, Odyssey Re, Northbridge Financial, Crum &amp; Forster, Verassure Insurance, Onlia Agency Inc., and Zenith Insurance Company. The company was also the largest shareholder of Torstar with 40% of the Class B shares, as of May 2020. 

Fairfax is led by chairman and CEO Prem Watsa, who controls nearly half of the firm.

==History==

=== Markel ===
Fairfax was incorporated as Markel Service of Canada on March 13, 1951, and continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act in 1976. The name was subsequently changed to Markel Financial Holdings Ltd.

In 1984, Prem Watsa left GW Asset Management to found his own asset management firm, Hamblin Watsa Investment Counsel Ltd. together with his former boss from Confed, Tony Hamblin. Tony was the Chief Investment Officer at Confed. The five founding partners were: Tony Hamblin, Prem Watsa, Roger Lace, Brian Bradstreet and Frances Burke.

In 1985, Watsa took control of Markel Financial, a Canadian-based specialist in trucking insurance. The company was controlled by the Virginia-based Markel family.

=== Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited ===
In May 1987, Watsa re-organized Markel Financial Holdings Limited and renamed it Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited &quot;(FAIRFAX: short for &quot;fair, friendly acquisitions&quot;)&quot;.

From 1985 to the end of 2010, the firm had a compound growth rate of approximately 25% in book value per share (per year), it is about 243 times what Fairfax began with in 1985.

Prem Watsa has served as chairman and chief executive officer of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited since 1985 and as vice president of Hamblin Watsa Investment Counsel since 1985. Watsa, directly, and indirectly through 1109519 Ontario Limited, The Sixty Two Investment Company Limited and 810679 Ontario Ltd., owns the controlling equity voting interest of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (&quot;Fairfax&quot;). He owns roughly 10% of Fairfax, which accounts for 99% of his personal wealth. His 10-for-1 multiple voting shares give him just over 50% ownership. 

===Subprime mortgage bubble===
As early as the 2003, in an annual report issued by the company, chief executive Prem Watsa raised concerns about securitized products and talks about the subprime mortgage crisis and the United States housing bubble.

In an interview in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in 2007, Watsa said believed that the global credit squeeze is in its &quot;early days&quot;, and indicated he believed there may be similarities to the Japanese asset price bubble.

The investment team of HWIC benefited from the subprime fallout, like John Paulson&#x27;s New York-based Paulson &amp; Co., Kyle Bass&#x27; Hayman Capital, Andrew Lahde&#x27;s California-based Lahde Capital, Julian Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Tiger Cubs&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Tiger Management Corp.&quot;), and Michael Burry&#x27;s Scion Capital (White Mountains Insurance Group is a minority investor in Scion Capital LLC), they have used derivatives to bet on the housing bubble. As of September 30, 2007, Fairfax and its subsidiaries owned an enormous credit default swap (CDS) book with a $18.5 billion notional amount and an average term to expiry of 4.2 years, on about 25 to 30 companies, the majority of which were bond insurers and mortgage lenders. The CDS book had a cost of $344 million, and a market value of $546 million. The market value of these swaps had fluctuated significantly in the 3rd quarter of 2007 from less than $200 million at the end of June, to $537 million at the end of July to almost $1 billion (twice that value) in August to $544 million at the end of September. 

=== Recent years ===
As of December 31, 2010, Fairfax had total assets of approximately $31.7 billion, and its revenue for the prior twelve months was approximately $6.2 billion. Since Watsa took over, the company book value per share has compounded by 23% per year, while the common stock price has followed the growth at 19% per year.

On September 23, 2013, Fairfax made an offer to purchase cell phone maker BlackBerry for $4.7 billion or $9.00 a share. BlackBerry announced it had signed a letter of intent but would be open to other offers until November 4, 2013. Fairfax already held 10% of BlackBerry. The deal was later scrapped in favor of a US$1 billion cash injection which, according to one analyst, represented the level of confidence BlackBerry&#x27;s largest shareholder had in the company.

In 2016, Fairfax offered seed funding to Kitchener startup, DOZR Inc. through their investment and innovation unit, Fair Ventures. Fair Ventures and Fairfax went on to support DOZR through multiple funding pitches, including the Colorado-based BaseCamp Equity Partners pitch in 2019. This pitch landed DOZR with $14 million CAD.

In 2017, Fairfax Financial Holdings increased its ownership of Torstar&#x27;s non-voting shares from 20% to 40%. In late May 2020, Torstar accepted an offer of a sale of the company to NordStar Capital. The $52 million deal, supported by Fairfax, was expected to close by year end. 

On April 24, 2018, it was announced that Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. would acquire the Canadian division of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us for approximately $234 million with the intention to keep the 82 remaining stores in Canada open under the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us brand even after the chain&#x27;s liquidation in the United States. The deal was completed on June 1, 2018. Fairfax sold Toys R Us Canada to businessman Doug Putman in 2021.

Fairfax Latin America Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairfax. Based in Miami, Florida, it offers a wide range of general insurance products, including property, automobile and various specialty lines, through its subsidiaries located in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay.
Fairfax Latin America has approximately 970 employees and, in 2021, generated annual gross premiums that exceeded US$727 million.
Fairfax Latin America underwrites through SBS Seguros Colombia S.A., Southbridge Insurance Company, Meridional Seguros and SBI Seguros Uruguay S.A.

Fairfax Financial has over 8,200 employees worldwide (5,000 of them in the United States). There are just 30 employees at head office in Toronto. 

On August 9, 2022, Fairfax Financial proposed a $954 million takeover bid for the Canadian restaurant operator Recipe Unlimited Corp.

<text>Small sausage in large sausage () is a snack sausage sandwich invented in Taiwan in the late 20th century. A segment of Taiwanese pork sausage is wrapped in a (slightly bigger and fatter) sticky rice patty, and usually served chargrilled. Deluxe versions are available in night markets in Taiwan, with condiments such as pickled bokchoy, pickled cucumber, garlic, hot peppers, wasabi, and thick soy sauce paste to complement the taste.

<doc id="898471" wikidata="Q1475659" url="?curid=898471" title="List of human spaceflights to the International Space Station">
<text>This is a chronological list of spaceflights to the International Space Station (ISS), including long-term ISS crew, short term visitors, replacement/rescue missions and mixed human/cargo missions. Uncrewed visiting spacecraft are excluded (see Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station for details). ISS crew members are listed in bold. &quot;Time docked&quot; refers to the spacecraft and does not always correspond to the crew.

, 269 people from 21 countries had visited the space station, many of them multiple times. The United States sent 163 people, Russia sent 57, 11 were Japanese, nine were Canadian, five were Italian, four were French, four were German, two from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and one each from Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Israel, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

U.S. Space Shuttle missions were capable of carrying more humans and cargo than the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, resulting in more U.S. short-term human visits until the Space Shuttle program was discontinued in 2011. Between 2011 and 2020, Soyuz was the sole means of human transport to the ISS, delivering mostly long-term crew. Russian cargo deliveries have been exclusively carried out by the uncrewed missions of Progress spacecraft, requiring fewer human spaceflights.

Continued international collaboration on ISS missions has been thrown into doubt by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions on Russia, but is still continuing as of 2024.

<text>In algebraic geometry, a semistable abelian variety is an abelian variety defined over a global or local field, which is characterized by how it reduces at the primes of the field.

For an abelian variety formula_1 defined over a field formula_2 with ring of integers formula_3, consider the Néron model of formula_1, which is a &#x27;best possible&#x27; model of formula_1 defined over formula_3. This model may be represented as a scheme over formula_7 (cf. spectrum of a ring) for which the generic fibre constructed by means of the morphism
formula_8
gives back formula_1. The Néron model is a smooth group scheme, so we can consider formula_10, the connected component of the Néron model which contains the identity for the group law. This is an open subgroup scheme of the Néron model. For a residue field formula_11, formula_12 is a group variety over formula_11, hence an extension of an abelian variety by a linear group. If this linear group is an algebraic torus, so that formula_12 is a semiabelian variety, then formula_1 has &quot;semistable reduction&quot; at the prime corresponding to formula_11. If formula_2 is a global field, then formula_1 is semistable if it has good or semistable reduction at all primes.

The fundamental [[semistable reduction theorem]] of Alexander Grothendieck states that an abelian variety acquires semistable reduction over a finite extension of formula_2.

==Semistable elliptic curve==
A semistable elliptic curve may be described more concretely as an elliptic curve that has bad reduction only of multiplicative type. Suppose is an elliptic curve defined over the rational number field formula_20. It is known that there is a finite, non-empty set &quot;S&quot; of prime numbers for which has &quot;bad reduction&quot; &quot;modulo&quot; . The latter means that the curve formula_21 obtained by reduction of to the prime field with elements has a singular point. Roughly speaking, the condition of multiplicative reduction amounts to saying that the singular point is a double point, rather than a cusp. Deciding whether this condition holds is effectively computable by Tate&#x27;s algorithm. Therefore in a given case it is decidable whether or not the reduction is semistable, namely multiplicative reduction at worst.

The semistable reduction theorem for may also be made explicit: acquires semistable reduction over the extension of generated by the coordinates of the points of order 12.

<doc id="898487" wikidata="Q1393345" url="?curid=898487" title="Fairmont Hotels and Resorts">
<text>Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts is a global chain of luxury hotel that operates more than 70 properties worldwide, with a strong presence in Canada.

The company originated from two hotel businesses established in the late 19th century, the Canadian Pacific Limited-owned Canadian Pacific Hotels &amp; Resorts, and Fairmont Hotels. In 1999, Canadian Pacific Hotels acquired a majority interest in Fairmont Hotels; with Canadian Pacific Hotels later renaming its entire hotel portfolio under the Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts banner in 2001. Shortly after the hotel division was renamed, Canadian Pacific Limited was split into several smaller companies in a starburst move, with Fairmont becoming a separately-traded company.

In 2006, Fairmont was acquired by Colony Capital, who subsequently entered into a joint partnership with the Kingdom Holding Company; consolidating Fairmont with their other hotel brands, Raffles and Swissôtel to form Fairmont Raffles Hotels International (FRHI). FRHI in turn became a subsidiary of AccorHotels in 2016.

== History ==
===Predecessors (1886–1999)===
====Canadian Pacific Hotels====
Canadian Pacific Hotels (CP Hotels) began as a division of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) Hotels department. The division operated a series of hotels along CPR&#x27;s rail lines as early as 1886. Many of these resort hotels were built and operated by the railway&#x27;s hotel department, while a few were later acquired from Canadian National Hotels, a hotel division of the Canadian National Railway. Over the years, a collection of grand railway hotels was put together throughout Canada, both rural and urban. By the 1980s, CP Hotels&#x27; collection included the Chateau Lake Louise, the Banff Springs Hotel, the Château Frontenac, the Empress Hotel, the Palliser Hotel, the Fairmont Royal York, and others. In addition to its properties in Canada, the hotel chain operated a few hotels outside Canada, with properties in Germany, Israel, Mexico, and the United States.

CPR&#x27;s rival Grand Trunk Railway and later Canadian National Railway copied Van Horne&#x27;s approach by building hotels such as the Jasper Park Lodge in Jasper, Alberta, and the Château Laurier in Ottawa. CPR purchased Canadian National Hotels, Canadian National Railway&#x27;s hotel division in 1988, making CP Hotels the nation&#x27;s largest hotel owner. In the 1990s, CP Hotels began to expand and purchased the Canadian Delta Hotels chain and the international Princess Hotels chain in 1998, which became wholly owned subsidiaries of CP Hotels. In 1999, the CP Hotels purchased the San Francisco-based Fairmont Hotels and Resorts chain.

====Fairmont Hotels====
During the 1890s, James Graham Fair bought the land where the Fairmont San Francisco now stands, the first hotel to bear the Fairmont namesake. The nearly completed structure survived the earthquake of 1906. Although heavily damaged by the subsequent fires, the hotel was renovated under the eye of architect Julia Morgan and finally opened in 1907. In 1926, the Penthouse Suite was created with three secret passageways to access it. 

In 1945, the Fairmont San Francisco was acquired by Benjamin Swig. Beginning in the 1960s, the Swig family developed Fairmont into a small chain of luxury hotels throughout the United States. Operating as Fairmont Hotels Management, the hotel chain acquired, and built a number of hotel properties. The chain acquired the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans in 1965, renaming it the Fairmont Roosevelt, and then Fairmont New Orleans. The Fairmont San Jose was opened by the hotel chain in 1987. The company assumed management of the Plaza Hotel in New York in 1995 and purchased the Copley Plaza Hotel in 1996, renaming it The Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel. By 1998, the company managed seven properties in the United States.

In addition to those properties, the company also operated the Colony Square Hotel in Atlanta as Fairmont Colony Square Hotel from its opening in 1974 to 1977, and The Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia as Fairmont Philadelphia from 1979 to 1980.

===Merger (1999–2001)===
In April 1999, Canadian Pacific Hotels, Kingdom Hotels International and Maritz Wolff &amp; Co. bought Fairmont Hotels Management L.P., with Canadian Pacific Hotels holding the majority of the shares (67%).

In 2001, Canadian Pacific Limited, the parent company of both Canadian Pacific Hotels and Resorts, and Canadian Pacific Railway, was reorganized. During this reorganization, Canadian Pacific Hotels and Resorts was renamed to Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, using the name of the company it had purchased in 1999. The newly re-organized Fairmont company transferred several properties to its Delta Hotels subsidiary, although it retained most of the &quot;signature&quot; hotels and resorts under the new Fairmont banner.

Later that year in October 2001, Canadian Pacific Limited spun off all of its subsidiary companies into separately traded &quot;independent&quot; companies, including Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. Companies like Fairmont Hotels and Resorts were split into smaller companies in a 2001 &quot;starburst&quot; move designed to increase the valuations of its individual divisions.

===Fairmont Hotel and Resorts (2001–present)===
In the early 2000s, Fairmont multiplied its openings in the United States. In 2001, Fairmont introduced the Willow Stream Spa prototype, a $7 million 2-floor 8,000-square-foot spa located inside the Fairmont Empress Hotel. The signature spa brand was then implemented in many of Fairmont&#x27;s locations. In July 2001, Fairmont Hotels signed a joint-venture with Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan for a minority-stake purchase and the management of a luxury 393-room hotel in Dubai. The Fairmont Dubai property was the first Fairmont branded hotel in the Middle East. In 2003, Fairmont introduced Fairmont Heritage Place, a chain of timeshare hotels, with the first opening in Mexico.

In 2004, Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. paid $70 million to take full control of the management company that runs its properties. Then in early 2006, a cluster of Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts was sold for US$3.9 billion to Colony Capital, LLC. As a result of that purchase, Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts was united with Raffles Hotels and Resorts and Swissôtel to form Fairmont Raffles Hotels International (FRHI), though the four chains still operate under their individual names.

In April 2010, Kingdom Hotels sold 22% of its shares of FRHI (from 58% to 35%) to Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment, giving them 40% of FRHI and became the second largest shareholder of the company. The remaining 60% belonged to a private shares holding in Sweden, trusted in ACCOR hotels, and other investors. The Middle East became Fairmont&#x27;s new target market, where Fairmont opened in the Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel in 2010 and at the Palm Jumeirah in 2012. In Asia, Fairmont reopened the Peace Hotel in Shanghai in 2010, opened in Baku’s Flame Towers in 2011, and opened its first hotel in India in 2012. In the USA, Fairmont acquired the Claremont Hotel in Berkeley, California in 2014.

In 2015, AccorHotels, with the approval and support of the external party, announced the acquisition of FRHI, thus adding Raffles Hotels and Resorts, Fairmont and Swissôtel to its Luxury Hotel Brands portfolio. Acquiring Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts enabled the French hotel group to gain greater access to the lucrative North American market.

In 2015, Fairmont stated it would invest in two new hotels in Egypt, in addition to its existing Fairmont hotel located in Cairo.

In 2017, Fairmont opened the Fairmont Quasar Istanbul, its first hotel in Turkey.

In 2019, Fairmont opened its first South American hotel in Brazil.

In 2021, Fairmont opened the Fairmont Taghazout Bay hotel in Morocco, and the Fairmont Ambassador Seoul in South Korea.

<doc id="898490" wikidata="Q314061" url="?curid=898490" title="Pavel Tretyakov">
<text>Pavel Mikhaylovich Tretyakov (; 27 December 1832 – 16 December 1898) was a Russian businessman, patron of art, collector, and philanthropist who gave his name to the Tretyakov Gallery and Tretyakov Drive in Moscow. His brother Sergei Tretyakov was also a famous patron of art and a philanthropist.

==Childhood==

Together with other Moscow businessmen he acted as the founder of the Moscow Merchant Bank (becoming one of its heads), the Moscow commercial and industrial company, some other large firms. He amassed a considerable fortune (4.4 million rubles), consisting of real estate (5 houses in Moscow), securities, money and bills.

==Collecting art==

Tretyakov started to collect art in 1854 at the age of 22; his first purchase was 10 canvases by Old Dutch masters. He laid down for himself the aim of creating a Russian National Gallery. In his collection Tretyakov included the most valuable and remarkable products, first of all the contemporaries, from 1870 - mainly members of the society of circulating art exhibitions (&quot;Tovarishchestvo peredvizhnyh hudozhestvennyh vystavok&quot; or Peredvizhniki, Передвижники in Russian). He bought paintings at exhibitions and directly from artists&#x27; studios, sometimes he bought the whole series: in 1874 he acquired V.V. Vereschagin&#x27;s &quot;Turkestan series&quot; (13 pictures, 133 figures and 81 studies), in 1880 - his &quot;Indian series&quot; (78 studies). In his collection there were over 80 studies by Alexander Ivanov. In 1885 Tretyakov bought 102 studies by V.D. Polenov painted by the artist during journeys across Turkey, Egypt, Syria and Palestine. He also acquired Viktor Vasnetsov’s collection of the sketches made during his work on St Volodymyr&#x27;s Cathedral in Kiev. Tretyakov had the fullest collection of such artists as: V.G. Perov, I.N. Kramskoi, Ilya Repin, Vasily Surikov, I.I. Levitan, and Valentin Serov. Aspiring to show the beginnings and development of the domestic school of art, Tretyakov began to acquire pictures by masters of the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries and landmarks of Old Russian painting. He also conceived the creation of a &quot;Russian pantheon&quot; - a portrait gallery of famous Russians. He commissioned especially for it portraits of figures of domestic culture from leading masters of this genre - N.N. Ge, Kramskoi, N.V. Nevrev, Perov, Repin.

In 1870-80 Tretyakov also began to collect illustrations (471 by 1893), and in 1890 he began to collect icons. During his lifetime they were kept in his study and were not put on public display. He also had a small collection of sculpture (9 sculptures by 1893).

At first the gallery was located in Tretyakov&#x27;s house in Lavrushenski pereulok. But as his collection expanded he decided to reconstruct his house to accommodate it. In 1870-1880 the house was reconstructed a number of times by the architect Kaminski.

Tretyakov wanted to transfer the gallery to the city as discreetly as possible, without any fuss; he didn&#x27;t want to be in the centre of general attention and an object of gratitude. But this was not possible and he was very dissatisfied.

From 1881 his gallery became popular (by 1885 it was visited by about 30 thousand people). In 1892 Tretyakov inherited a collection of Western European painting from his brother and placed it in two halls of the western school. The collection in Tretyakov&#x27;s gallery was equal in importance with the largest museums in Russia at that time, and became one of sights of Moscow. In August 1892 Tretyakov donated his collection and a private residence to Moscow. By then in the collection there were 1287 pictures and 518 graphics of the Russian school, 75 pictures and 8 figures of the West-European school, 15 sculptures and a collections of icons. 

On 15 August 1893 the official opening of a museum under the name &quot;Pavel and Sergey Tretyakov City art gallery&quot; (nowadays Tretyakov Gallery) took place. By 1890 it was visited by up to 150 thousand people annually. Tretyakov continued to build up his collection, for example, in 1894 he donated a gallery of 30 pictures, 12 figures and a marble statue “The Christian martyrs“ works by Mark Antokolski. He was also involved in studying the collection, and from 1893 he produced its catalogue.

==Other work==

Apart from engaging in collecting, Tretyakov was active in charity. Charity for him was as natural as the creation of a national gallery.

He was an honorary member of the Society of Collectors of the Applied Arts and of the Musical Society from the dates of their foundations. He granted large amounts of money to these organizations, supporting all their educational undertakings. He supported an initiative to help the families of soldiers who died during the Crimean and Russo-Turkish War. He established grants in commercial schools in Moscow and Alexandrovskoe. He never refused monetary help to artists and others, and carefully looked after the affairs of painters who without fear entrusted their savings to him. He repeatedly lent money to his counsellor and adviser I.N. Kramskoi, and to V.G. Khudyakov, K.A. Trutovski, M.K. Klodt.

With his brother Sergey he supported the Moscow School for the Deaf, founded in 1860 by the artist Ivan Karlovich Arnold, and became its patron. In 1900 the school was renamed the Arnoldo-Tretyakov School.

== Death and legacy ==
Pavel Tretyakov died in December 1898, and his funeral was held at the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi where he was an active parishioner. He was buried in Danilov Cemetery, but in 1948 his remains were transferred to Novodevichy Cemetery.

Tretyakov bequeathed half of his estate to charitable purposes. He provided for the financing of the gallery, and also for a shelter for the widows, juvenile children and unmarried daughters of artists who had died.

In his will he also provided large sums for the school for the deaf. He bought a big stone house with a garden for the school. 150 boys and girls lived in this house. Here they were looked after till they reached the age of 16. Tretyakov selected the best teachers, and became acquainted with the methods of study.

A minor planet 3925 Tretʹyakov, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1977 is named after Pavel Tretyakov and his brother Sergei Mikhailovich Tretyakov (1824–1892).

His daughter Vera married the pianist and composer Alexander Siloti. His other daughter, Lyubov, married the maritime artist, Nikolay Gritsenko.

<text>Oyster vermicelli or oyster misua (traditional Chinese: 蚵仔麵線; Taiwanese Hokkien:&quot; ô-á mī-sòaⁿ&quot;) is a kind of noodle soup originating in Taiwan. Its main ingredients are oysters and &quot;misua&quot; (Chinese vermicelli). One of the famous places serving this is in Dihua Street, Dadaocheng, Taipei. A tan-brown variety of vermicelli used for this dish is made primarily with wheat flour and salt, and gains its unique colour due to a steaming process that darkens the sugars in the dough, allowing it to be cooked for longer periods without breaking down.

An alternative is vermicelli with large intestine, in which oysters are substituted with small segments of pig&#x27;s large intestine.

<text>Steam is a digital distribution service and storefront developed by Valve. It was launched as a software client in September 2003 to provide game updates automatically for Valve&#x27;s games and expanded to distributing third-party titles in late 2005. Steam offers various features, such as game server matchmaking with Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) measures, social networking, and game streaming services. The Steam client functions include update maintenance, cloud storage, and community features such as direct messaging, an in-game overlay, discussion forums, and a virtual collectable marketplace. The storefront also offers productivity software, game soundtracks, videos, and sells hardware made by Valve, such as the Valve Index and the Steam Deck.

Steamworks, an application programming interface (API) released in 2008, is used by developers to integrate Steam&#x27;s functions, including digital rights management (DRM), into their products. Several game publishers began distributing their products on Steam that year. Initially developed for Windows, Steam was ported to macOS and Linux in 2010 and 2013 respectively, while a mobile version of Steam for interacting with the service&#x27;s online features was released on iOS and Android in 2012.

The service is the largest digital distribution platform for PC games, with an estimated 75% of the market share in 2013 according to IHS Screen Digest. By 2017, game purchases through Steam totaled about 4.3 billion, or at least 18% of global PC game sales according to Steam Spy. By 2021, the service had over 34,000 games with over 132 million monthly active users. Steam&#x27;s success has led to the development of the Steam Machine gaming PCs in 2015, including the SteamOS Linux distribution and Steam Controller; Steam Link devices for local game streaming; and in 2022, the handheld Steam Deck tailored for running Steam games.

== History ==
In the early 2000s, Valve was looking for a better way to update its published games, as providing downloadable patches for multiplayer games resulted in most users disconnecting for several days until they had installed the patch. They decided to create a platform that would update games automatically, and implement stronger anti-piracy and anti-cheat measures. They approached several companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo!, and RealNetworks, to build a client with these features, but were rejected.

Valve began its own platform development in 2002, using the working names &quot;Grid&quot; and &quot;Gazelle&quot;. The Steam platform was announced at the Game Developers Conference event on March 22, 2002, and released for beta testing that day. Prior to the implementation of Steam, Valve had a publishing contract with Sierra Studios; the 2001 version of the contract gave Valve rights to digital distribution of its games. Valve took Sierra and its owners, Vivendi Games, to court in 2002 over a claimed breach of contract. Sierra counter-sued, asserting that Valve had undermined the contract by offering a digital storefront for their games, to compete directly with Sierra.

Steam was released out of beta on September 12, 2003. In November 2004, &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; was the first high-profile game to be offered digitally on Steam, requiring installation of the Steam client for retail copies. During this time users faced problems attempting to play; part of legal issues that Valve had with Vivendi, who claimed that physical copies they published could not be activated as to them the game had not been released. The Steam requirement was met with concerns about software ownership and requirements, as well as problems with overloaded servers - demonstrated previously by the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; rollout.

In 2005, third-party developers were contracted to release games on Steam, such as &quot;Rag Doll Kung Fu&quot; and &quot;Darwinia&quot;. In May 2007, ATI included Steam in the ATI Catalyst GPU driver as well as offering a free Steam copy of &quot;Half-Life 2: Lost Coast&quot; and &quot;Half-Life 2: Deathmatch&quot; to ATI Radeon owners. 

In January 2008, Nvidia promoted Steam in the GeForce GPU driver, as well as offering a free Steam copy of &quot;Portal: The First Slice&quot; to Nvidia hardware owners. In 2011, some Electronic Arts games, such as &quot;Crysis 2&quot;, &quot;Dragon Age II&quot;, and &quot;,&quot; were removed from sale because of terms of service that prevented them having their own in-game storefront for downloadable content. These were later launched on the Origin service. 

In 2019, Ubisoft announced that it would stop selling future games on Steam, starting with &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division 2&quot; because Valve would not modify its revenue sharing model. In May 2019, Microsoft distributed its games on Steam in addition to the Microsoft Store.

In 2020, Electronic Arts started to publish selected games on Steam, and offered its rebranded subscription service EA Play on the platform. In 2022, Ubisoft announced that it would return to selling its recent games on Steam, starting with &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;, stating that it was &quot;constantly evaluating how to bring our games to different audiences wherever they are&quot;. By 2014, total annual game sales on Steam were estimated at $1.5 billion. By 2018, the service had over 90 million monthly active users. In 2018, its network delivered 15 billion gigabytes of data, compared to less than 4 billion in 2014.

== Features and functionality ==
=== Software delivery and maintenance ===
Steam&#x27;s primary service is to allow its users to purchase games and other software, adding them to a virtual library from which they may be downloaded and installed an unlimited number of times. Initially, Valve was required to be the publisher for these games since they had sole access to Steam&#x27;s database and engine, but with the introduction of the Steamworks software development kit (SDK) in May 2008, anyone could integrate Steam into their game without Valve&#x27;s direct involvement.

Valve intended to &quot;make DRM obsolete&quot; as games released on Steam had traditional anti-piracy measures, including the assignment and distribution of product keys and support for digital rights management software tools such as SecuROM or non-malicious rootkits. With an update to the Steamworks SDK in March 2009, Valve added &quot;Custom Executable Generation&quot; (CEG), which creates a unique, encrypted copy of the game&#x27;s executable files for the given user, which allows them to install it multiple times and on multiple devices, and make backup copies of their software. Once the software is downloaded and installed, the user must then authenticate through Steam to de-encrypt the executable files to play the game. Normally this is done while connected to the Internet following the user&#x27;s credential validation, but once they have logged into Steam once, a user can instruct Steam to launch in a special offline mode to be able to play their games without a network connection. Developers are not limited to Steam&#x27;s CEG and may include other forms of DRM (or none at all) and other authentication services than Steam; for example, some games from publisher Ubisoft require the use of their Uplay gaming service.

In September 2008, Valve added support for Steam Cloud, a service that can automatically store saved game and related custom files on Valve&#x27;s servers; users can access this data from any machine running the Steam client. Users can disable this feature on a per-game and per-account basis. Cloud saving was expanded in January 2022 for Dynamic Cloud Sync, allowing games developed with this feature to store saved states to Steam Cloud while a game is running rather than waiting until the user quit; this was added ahead of the portable Steam Deck unit so that users can save from the Deck and then put the unit into a suspended state. In May 2012, the service added the ability for users to manage their game libraries from remote clients, including computers and mobile devices. Product keys sold through third-party retailers can also be redeemed on Steam. For games that incorporate Steamworks, users can buy redemption codes from other vendors and redeem these in the Steam client to add the title to their libraries. Steam also offers a framework for selling and distributing downloadable content (DLC) for games.

In September 2013, Steam introduced the ability to share most games with family members and close friends by authorizing machines to access one&#x27;s library. Authorized players can install the game locally and play it separately from the owning account. Users can access their saved games and achievements provided the main owner is not playing. When the main player initiates a game while a shared account is using it, the shared account user is allowed a few minutes to either save their progress and close the game or purchase the game for their own account. Within Family View, introduced in January 2014, parents can adjust settings for their children&#x27;s tied accounts, limiting the functionality and accessibility to the Steam client and purchased games. A more robust implementation of Family Sharing, titled &quot;Steam Families&quot;, was released in September 2024, allowing up to five members of a household to share games from a single account, including the ability to play different games on those accounts along with different game saves and profiles, and enhanced parental control tools for those accounts.

By its acceptable use policy, Valve retains the right to block customers&#x27; access to their games and Steam services when Valve&#x27;s Anti-Cheat (VAC) software determines that the user is cheating in multiplayer games, selling accounts to others, or trading games to exploit regional price differences. Blocking such users initially removed access to their other games, leading to some users with high-value accounts losing access because of minor infractions. Valve later changed its policy to be similar to that of Electronic Arts&#x27; Origin platform, in which blocked users can still access their games but are heavily restricted, limited to playing in offline mode and unable to participate in Steam Community features. Customers also lose access to their games and Steam account if they refuse to accept changes to Steam&#x27;s end user license agreements; this last occurred in August 2012. In April 2015, Valve began allowing developers to set bans on players for their games, but enacted and enforced at the Steam level, which allowed them to police their own gaming communities in a customizable manner.

=== Storefront features ===
The Steam client includes a digital storefront called the Steam Store through which users can purchase games. Once the game is bought, a software license is permanently attached to the user&#x27;s Steam account, allowing them to download the software on any compatible device. Game licenses can be given to other accounts under certain conditions. Content is delivered from an international network of servers using a proprietary file transfer protocol. Products sold on Steam are available for sale in different currencies, which changes depending on the user&#x27;s location. In December 2010, the storefront began supporting WebMoney for payments, and from April 2016 until December 2017 supported Bitcoin payments before dropping support due to high value fluctuations and costly service fees. The Steam storefront validates the user&#x27;s region; the purchase of games may be restricted to specific regions because of release dates, game classification, or agreements with publishers. Since 2010, the &quot;Steam Translation Server&quot; project allows Steam users to assist with the translation of the Steam client, storefront, and a selected library of Steam games for twenty-eight languages. In October 2018, official support for Vietnamese and Latin American Spanish was added, in addition to Steam&#x27;s then 26 languages. Steam also allows users to purchase downloadable content for games, and for some specific games such as &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, the ability to purchase in-game inventory items. In February 2015, Steam began to open similar options for in-game item purchases for third-party games. In November 2007, achievements were added, similar to Xbox 360 Achievements.

In conjunction with developers and publishers, Valve frequently provides discounted sales on games on a daily and weekly basis, sometimes oriented around a publisher, genre, or holiday theme, and sometimes allows games to be tried for free during the days of these sales. The site normally offers a large selection of games at a discount during its annual Summer and Holiday sales, including gamification of these sales.

Users of Steam&#x27;s storefront can also purchase games and other software as gifts for another Steam user. Before May 2017, users could purchase these gifts to be held in their profile&#x27;s inventory until they opted to gift them. However, this feature enabled a gray market around some games, where a user in a country where the price of a game was substantially lower than elsewhere could stockpile giftable copies to sell to others in regions with much higher prices. In August 2016, Valve changed its gifting policy to require that games with VAC and Game Ban-enabled games be gifted immediately to another Steam user, which also served to combat players that worked around VAC and Game Bans; in May 2017, Valve expanded this policy to all games. The changes also placed limitations on gifts between users of different countries if there is a large difference in pricing. Due to runaway inflation in Argentina and Turkey, Valve eliminated the use of local currency pricing for users in those storefronts in November 2023, instead moving them to a special regional pricing model based on U.S. dollars as a means to provide fair payments to publisher and developers, though these local users saw effective price hikes as high as 2900%.

The Steam store also enables users to redeem store product keys to add software from their library. The keys are sold by third-party providers such as Humble Bundle, distributed as part of a physical release, or given to a user as part of promotions, often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowdfunding rewards. A grey market exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these keys to users or other third-party sites at a higher price. This caused some of these third-party sites, such as G2A, to be embroiled in this grey market. It is possible for publishers to have Valve track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user&#x27;s libraries. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, have set a minimum price that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases. In June 2021, Valve began limiting how frequently Steam users could change their default region to prevent them from purchasing games from outside their home region for cheaper.

In 2013, Steam began to accept player reviews of games. Other users can subsequently rate these reviews as helpful, humorous, or otherwise unhelpful, which are then used to highlight the most useful reviews on the game&#x27;s Steam store page. Steam also aggregates these reviews and enables users to sort products based on this feedback while browsing the store. In May 2016, Steam further broke out these aggregations between all reviews overall and those made more recently in the last 30 days, a change Valve acknowledges to how game updates, particularly those in Early Access, can alter the impression of a game to users. To prevent observed abuse of the review system by developers or other third-party agents, Valve modified the review system in September 2016 to discount review scores for a game from users that activated the product through a product key rather than directly purchased by the Steam Store, though their reviews remain visible. Alongside this, Valve announced that it would end business relations with any developer or publisher that they found to be abusing the review system. Separately, Valve has taken actions to minimize the effects of review bombs on Steam. In particular, Valve announced in March 2019 that they mark reviews they believe are &quot;off-topic&quot; as a result of a review bomb, and eliminate their contribution to summary review scores; the first such games they took action on with this were the &quot;Borderlands&quot; games after it was announced &quot;Borderlands 3&quot; would be a timed-exclusive to the Epic Games Store.

Valve added support for free-to-play games on Steam as well as support for in-game microtransactions through the use of Steamworks in June 2011, while support was added in September 2011 for trading in-game items and &quot;unopened&quot; gifts between users. Steam Coupons, which was introduced in December 2011, provides single-use coupons that provide a discount to the cost of items. Steam Coupons can be provided to users by developers and publishers; users can trade these coupons between friends in a similar fashion to gifts and in-game items. In May 2015, GameStop began selling Steam Wallet cards. Steam Market, a feature introduced in beta in December 2012 that would allow users to sell virtual items to others via Steam Wallet funds, further extended the idea. Valve levies a transaction fee of 15% on such sales and game publishers that use Steam Market pay a transaction fee. For example, &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;the first game supported at the beta phaseincurred both fees. Full support for other games was expected to be available in early 2013. In April 2013, Valve added subscription-based game support to Steam; the first game to use this service was &quot;Darkfall Unholy Wars&quot;.

In October 2012, Steam introduced non-gaming applications, which are sold through the service in the same manner as games. Creativity and productivity applications can access the core functions of the Steamworks API, allowing them to use Steam&#x27;s simplified installation and updating process, and incorporate features including cloud saving and Steam Workshop. Steam also allows game soundtracks to be purchased to be played via Steam Music or integrated with the user&#x27;s other media players. Valve adjusted its approach to soundtracks in 2020, no longer requiring them to be offered as DLC, meaning that users can buy soundtracks to games they do not own, and publishers can offer soundtracks to games not on Steam.

Valve has also added the ability for publishers to rent and sell digital movies via the service, with initially most being video game documentaries. Following Warner Bros. Entertainment offering the &quot;Mad Max&quot; films alongside the September 2015 release of the game based on the series, Lionsgate entered into agreement with Valve to rent over one hundred feature films from its catalog through Steam starting in April 2016, with more films following later. In March 2017, Crunchyroll started offering various anime for purchase or rent through Steam. However, by February 2019, Valve shuttered video from its storefront save for videos directly related to gaming content. While available, users could also purchase Steam Machine related hardware.

Valve took a flat 30% share of all revenue generated from direct Steam sales and microtransactions until October 2018 when they changed their policy to reduce the cut to 25% once revenue for a game surpasses , and further to 20% at . The policy change was seen by journalists as trying to entice larger developers to stay with Steam, while the decision was also met with backlash from indie and other small game developers, as their revenue split remained unchanged.

While Steam allows developers to offer demo versions of their games at any time, Valve worked with Geoff Keighley in 2019 in conjunction with The Game Awards to hold a week-long Steam Game Festival to feature a large selection of game demos of current and upcoming games, alongside sales for games already released. This event has since been repeated two or three times a year, typically in conjunction with game expositions or award events, and since has been renamed as the Steam Next Fest. Valve expanded support for demo versions of games in July 2024, allowing demos to have their own store page with user reviews and made it easier for user to manage demos within their game library.

A Steam Points system and storefront was added in June 2020, which mirrored similar temporary points systems that had been used in prior sales on the storefront. Users earn points through purchases on Steam or by receiving community recognition for helpful reviews or discussion comments. These points can be redeemed in the separate storefront for cosmetics that apply to the user&#x27;s profile and chat interface.

=== Privacy, security and abuse ===
The popularity of Steam has led to the services being attacked by hackers. An attempt occurred in November 2011, when Valve temporarily closed the community forums, citing potential hacking threats to the service. Days later, Valve reported that the hack had compromised one of its customer databases, potentially allowing the perpetrators to access customer information, including encrypted passwords and credit card details. At that time, Valve was not aware whether the intruders actually accessed this information or discovered the encryption method, but nevertheless warned users to be alert for fraudulent activity.

Valve launched Steam Guard in March 2011 with the goal of protecting Steam users against account hijacking via phishing schemes, one of the largest security problems Valve had at the time. Steam Guard was advertised to take advantage of the identity protection provided by Intel&#x27;s second-generation Core processors and compatible motherboard hardware, which allows users to lock their account to a specific computer. Once locked, activity by that account on other computers must first be approved by the user on the locked computer. Support APIs for Steam Guard are available to third-party developers through Steamworks. Steam Guard also offers two-factor, risk-based authentication that uses a one-time verification code sent to a verified email address associated with the Steam account; this was later expanded to include two-factor authentication through the Steam mobile application, known as Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator.

In 2015, Valve stated that the potential monetary value of virtual goods attached to user accounts had drawn hackers to try to access accounts for financial benefit. Valve reported that in December 2015, around 77,000 accounts per month were hijacked, enabling the hijackers to empty the user&#x27;s inventory of items through the trading features. To improve security, the company announced that new restrictions would be added in March 2016, under which 15-day holds are placed on traded items unless they activate, and authenticate with Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator. After a &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot; gambling controversy, Valve stated it was cracking down on third-party websites using Steam inventory trading for skin gambling in July 2016.

ReVuln, a commercial vulnerability research firm, published a paper in October 2012 that said the Steam browser protocol was posing a security risk by enabling malicious exploits through a simple user click on a maliciously crafted codice_1 URL in a browser. This was the second serious vulnerability of gaming-related software following a problem with Ubisoft&#x27;s Uplay. German IT platform Heise online recommended strict separation of gaming and sensitive data, for example using a PC dedicated to gaming, gaming from a second Windows installation, or using a computer account with limited rights dedicated to gaming.

In July 2015, a bug in the software allowed anyone to reset the password to any account by using the &quot;forgot password&quot; function of the client. High-profile professional gamers and streamers lost access to their accounts. In December 2015, Steam&#x27;s content delivery network was misconfigured in response to a DDoS attack, causing cached store pages containing personal information to be temporarily exposed for 34,000 users.

Valve added new privacy settings to Steam in April 2018, allowing users to hide their activity status, game lists, inventory, and other profile elements. While these changes brought Steam&#x27;s privacy settings in line with services such as PlayStation Network and the Xbox network, third-party services such as Steam Spy were impacted, due to their reliance on public data to estimate Steam product sales.

Valve established a HackerOne bug bounty program in May 2018, a crowdsourced method to test and improve the security features of the Steam client. In August 2019, a security researcher exposed a zero-day vulnerability in the Windows client of Steam, which allowed for any user to run arbitrary code with LocalSystem privileges using just a few simple commands. The vulnerability was then reported to Valve via the program, but it was initially rejected for being &quot;out-of-scope&quot;. Following a second vulnerability found by the same user, Valve apologized and patched them both, and expanded the program&#x27;s rules to accept any other similar problems.

The Anti-Defamation League published a report that stated the &quot;Steam Community&quot; platform harbors hateful content in April 2020. In January 2021, a trading card glitch let players generate Steam Wallet funds from free Steam trading cards with bots using Capcom Arcade Stadium and other games, resulting in the game becoming one of the statistically most played titles.

=== User interface and functionality ===
Since November 2013, Steam has allowed for users to review their purchased games and organize them into categories set by the user and add to favorite lists for quick access.
Players can add non-Steam games to their libraries, allowing the game to be easily accessed from the Steam client and providing support where possible for Steam Overlay features. The Steam interface allows for user-defined shortcuts to be added. In this way, third-party modifications and games not purchased through the Steam Store can use Steam features. Valve sponsors and distributes some modifications free of charge; and modifications that use Steamworks can also use any Steam features supported by their parent game. For most games launched from Steam, the client provides an in-game overlay from which the user can access Steam Community lists and participate in chat, manage selected Steam settings, and access a built-in web browser without having to exit the game. Since the beginning of February 2011 as a beta version, the overlay also allows players to take screenshots of the games in process. As a full version on February 24, 2011, this feature was reimplemented so that users could share screenshots on websites of Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit directly from a user&#x27;s screenshot manager. Store game pages display a score from Metacritic since 2007.
Steam&#x27;s &quot;Big Picture&quot; mode was announced in 2011; public betas started in September 2012 and were integrated into the software in December 2012. Big Picture mode is a 10-foot user interface, which optimizes the Steam display to work on high-definition televisions, allowing the user to control Steam with a gamepad or with a keyboard and mouse. Gabe Newell stated that Big Picture mode was a step towards a dedicated Steam entertainment hardware unit. With the introduction of the Steam Deck, Valve began pushing the new Big Picture mode based on the Steam Deck UI in beta testing in October 2022, and full release in February 2023. The new UI was also adopted by SteamVR in October 2023.

In 2012, Valve announced &quot;Steam for Schools,&quot; a free function-limited version of the Steam client for schools. It was part of Valve&#x27;s initiative to support gamification of learning. It was released alongside free versions of &quot;Portal 2&quot; and a standalone program called &quot;Puzzle Maker&quot; that allowed teachers and students to create and manipulate levels. It featured additional authentication security that allowed teachers to share and distribute content via a Steam Workshop-type interface but blocks access from students.

In-Home Streaming was introduced in May 2014; it allows users to stream games installed on one computer to another on the same home network with low latency. By June 2019, Valve renamed this feature to Remote Play, allowing users to stream games across devices that may be outside of their home network. Steam&#x27;s &quot;Remote Play Together&quot;, added in November 2019 after a month of beta testing, gives the ability for local multiplayer games to be played by people in disparate locations, though will not necessary resolve latency problems typical of these types of games. Remote Play Together was expanded in February 2021 to give the ability to invite non-Steam players to play through a Steam Link app approach.
The Steam client, as part of a social network service, allows users to identify friends and join groups using the Steam Community feature. Through the Steam Chat feature, users can use text chat and peer-to-peer VoIP with other users, identify which games their friends and other group members are playing, and join and invite friends to Steamworks-based multiplayer games that support this feature. Users can participate in forums hosted by Valve to discuss Steam games. Each user has a unique page that shows his or her groups and friends, game library including earned achievements, game wishlists, and other social features; users can choose to keep this information private. In January 2010, Valve reported that 10 million of the 25 million active Steam accounts had signed up to Steam Community. In conjunction with the 2012 Steam Summer Sale, user profiles were updated with Badges reflecting the user&#x27;s participation in the Steam community and past events. Steam Trading Cards, a system where players earn virtual trading cards based on games they own, were introduced in May 2013. Using them, players can trade with other Steam users on the Steam Community Marketplace and use them to craft &quot;Badges&quot;, which grant rewards such as discount coupons, and user profile page customization options. In 2010, the Steam client became an OpenID provider, allowing third-party websites to use a Steam user&#x27;s identity without requiring the user to expose his or her Steam credentials. In order to prevent abuse, access to most community features is restricted until a one-time payment of at least 5 is made to Valve. This requirement can be fulfilled by making any purchase of five dollars or more on Steam, or by adding at the same amount to their wallet.

Through Steamworks, Steam provides a means of server browsing for multiplayer games that use the Steam Community features, allowing users to create lobbies with friends or members of common groups. Steamworks also provides Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC), Valve&#x27;s anti-cheat system; game servers automatically detect and report users who are using cheats in online, multiplayer games. In August 2012, Valve added new featuresincluding dedicated hub pages for games that highlight the best user-created content, top forum posts, and screenshotsto the Community area. In December 2012, a feature where users can upload walkthroughs and guides detailing game strategy was added. Starting in January 2015, the Steam client allowed players to livestream to Steam friends or the public while playing games on the platform. For the main event of The International 2018 &quot;Dota 2&quot; tournament, Valve launched Steam.tv as a major update to Steam Broadcasting, adding Steam Chat and Steamworks integration for spectating matches played at the event. It has also been used for other events, such as a pre-release tournament for the digital card game &quot;Artifact&quot; and for The Game Awards 2018 and Steam Awards award shows. Game Recording was added in beta in June 2024 and released in full by November 2024, allowing for recording of gameplay sessions both on demand or as a background recording. Users can then edit and clip footage to share via Steam with other users.

In September 2014, Steam Music was added to the Steam client, allowing users to play through music stored on their computer or to stream from a locally networked computer directly in Steam. An update to the friends and chat system was released in July 2018, allowing for non-peer-to-peer chats integrated with voice chat and other features that were compared to Discord. A standalone mobile app based on this for Android and iOS was released in May 2019.

A major visual overhaul of the Library was released in October 2019, with the goal of aiding users in organizing their games, help showcase what shared games a user&#x27;s friends are playing, games that are being live-streamed, and new content that may be available, along with more customization options for sorting games. Along with the redesign, Valve launched Steam Events, allowing game developers to communicate when new in-game events are approaching, which appear to players in the Library and game listings. 

In June 2023, a visual and architectural overhaul was released, unifying the backend functions of the Steam and Steam Deck clients and redesigning the desktop client. As part of this, the in-game overlay received a new customizable design where users can pin windows such as chat or game guides on top of the current game window. It also received several new features, including the ability to create pinnable personal notes stored in the cloud.

=== Developer features ===
Valve provides developers the ability to create storefront pages to help generate interest in their game ahead of release. This is also necessary to fix a release date that functions into Valve&#x27;s &quot;build review&quot;, a free service performed by Valve about a week before this release date to make sure the game&#x27;s launch is trouble-free. Updates in 2020 to Discovery queues have given developers more options for customizing their storefront page and how these pages integrate with users&#x27; experiences with the Steam client.

Valve offers Steamworks, an application programming interface (API) that provides development and publishing tools free of charge to game and software developers. Steamworks provides networking and player authentication tools for both server and peer-to-peer multiplayer games, matchmaking services, support for Steam community friends and groups, Steam statistics and achievements, integrated voice communications, and Steam Cloud support, allowing games to integrate with the Steam client. The API also provides anti-cheating devices and digital copy management. In 2016, after introducing the Steam Controller and improvements to the Steam interface to support numerous customization options, the Steamworks API was also updated to provide a generic controller library for developers and these customization features for other third-party controllers, starting with the DualShock 4. Steam&#x27;s Input API has since been updated to include official support for other console controllers such as the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller in 2018, the Xbox Wireless Controller for the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, and the PlayStation 5&#x27;s DualSense, as well as compatible controllers from third-party manufacturers in 2020. In November 2020, Valve said the controller usage had more than doubled over the past 2 years. In March 2019, Steam&#x27;s game server network was opened to third-party developers.

Developers of software available on Steam can track sales of their games through the Steam store. In February 2014, Valve announced that it would begin to allow developers to set up their own sales for their games independent of any sales that Valve may set. Valve may also work with developers to suggest their participation in sales on themed days.

Steam has conducted and partially published a monthly opt-in hardware and software survey between 2007 and 2010.

Valve added the ability for developers to sell games under an early access model with a special section of the Steam store, starting in March 2013. This program allows developers to release functional, but not finished, products such as beta versions to the service to allow users to buy the games and help provide testing and feedback towards the final production. Early access also helps to provide funding to the developers to help complete their games. The early access approach allowed more developers to publish games onto the Steam service without the need for Valve&#x27;s direct curation of games, significantly increasing the number of available games on the service. Valve added Steam Playtest for developers in 2020, allowing them to run closed beta testing for their games prior to a public release.

Developers can request Steam keys of their products to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different prioritization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings that are designed to manipulate the Steam storefront and other features.

Valve enabled the ability for multiple developers to create bundles of games from their offerings in June 2021.

=== Steam Workshop ===
The Steam Workshop is a service that allows users to share user-made content and modifications for video games available on Steam. New levels, art assets, gameplay modifications, or other content may be published to or installed from the Workshop depending on the title. The Workshop was originally used for distribution of new in-game items for &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;; it was redesigned to extend support for any game in early 2012, including modifications for &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;. A May 2012 patch for &quot;Portal 2&quot;, enabled by a new map-making tool through the Workshop, introduced the ability to share user-created levels. Independently developed games, including &quot;Dungeons of Dredmor&quot;, are able to provide Workshop support for user-made content. &quot;Dota 2&quot; became Valve&#x27;s third published title available for the Workshop in June 2012; its features include customizable accessories, character skins, and announcer packs. Workshop content may be monetized; Newell said that the Workshop was inspired by gold farming from &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; to find a way to incentive both players and content creators in video games, and which had informed them of their approach to &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; and their later multiplayer games.

By January 2015, Valve themselves had provided some user-developed Workshop content as paid-for features in Valve-developed games, including &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; and &quot;Dota 2&quot;; with over $57 million being paid to content creators using the Workshop. Valve began allowing developers to use these advanced features in January 2015; both the developer and content generator share the profits of the sale of these items; the feature went live in April 2015, starting with various mods for &quot;Skyrim&quot;. This feature was pulled a few days afterward following negative user feedback and reports of pricing and copyright misuse. Six months later, Valve stated they were still interested in offering this type of functionality in the future. In November 2015, the Steam client was updated with the ability for game developers to offer in-game items for direct sale via the store interface, with &quot;Rust&quot; being the first game to use the feature.

=== SteamVR ===
SteamVR is a virtual reality hardware and software platform developed by Valve, with a focus on allowing &quot;room-scale&quot; experiences using positional tracking base stations, as opposed to those requiring the player to stay in a singular location. SteamVR was first introduced for the Oculus Rift headset in 2014, and later expanded to support other virtual reality headsets. Initially released for support on Windows, macOS, and Linux, Valve dropped macOS support for SteamVR in May 2020. SteamVR 2.0 was released in October 2023, introducing a new overlay interface that is unified with the updated SteamOS and Big Picture mode interfaces.

== Storefront curation ==
Until 2012, Valve handpicked games to be included onto the Steam service, limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records. Since then, Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. In 2017, Steam development team member Alden Kroll said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company does not want to be in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games in the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games.

=== Steam Greenlight ===
Valve announced Steam Greenlight to streamline game addition to the service in July 2012 and released the following month. Through Greenlight, Steam users would choose which games were added to the service. Developers were able to submit information about their games, as well as early builds or beta versions, for consideration by users. Users would pledge support for these games, and Valve would make top-pledged games available on Steam. In response to complaints during its first week that finding games to support was made difficult by a flood of inappropriate or false submissions, Valve required developers to pay to list a game on the service. Those fees were donated to the charity Child&#x27;s Play. This fee was met with some concern from smaller developers, who often are already working in a deficit and may not have the money to cover such fees. A later modification allowed developers to put conceptual ideas on the Greenlight service to garner interest in potential projects free-of-charge; votes from such projects are visible only to the developer. Valve also allowed non-gaming software to be voted onto the service through Greenlight.

The initial process offered by Greenlight was panned by developers because while they favored the concept, the rate of games that were eventually approved were small. In January 2013, Newell stated that Valve recognized that its role in Greenlight was perceived as a bottleneck, something the company was planning to eliminate in the future through an open marketplace infrastructure. On the eve of Greenlight&#x27;s first anniversary, Valve simultaneously approved 100 games to demonstrate this change of direction.

=== Steam Direct ===
Valve launched Steam Direct on June 13, 2017, following Greenlight&#x27;s shutdown the week before. With Steam Direct, a developer or publisher wishing to distribute their game on Steam needs only to complete appropriate identification and tax forms for Valve and then pay a recoupable application fee for each game they intend to publish. Once they apply, a developer must wait thirty days before publishing the game to allow Valve to review the game to ensure it is &quot;configured correctly, matches the description provided on the store page, and doesn&#x27;t contain malicious content&quot;.

On announcing its plans for Steam Direct, Valve suggested the fee would be in the range of $100–5,000, meant to encourage earnest software submissions to the service and weed out poor quality games that are treated as shovelware, improving the discovery pipeline to Steam&#x27;s customers. Smaller developers raised concerns about the Direct fee harming them, and excluding potentially good indie games from reaching the Steam store. Valve opted to set the Direct fee at $100 after reviewing concerns from the community and outlined plans to improve their discovery algorithms and inject more human involvement to help these. Valve refunds the fee should the game exceed $1,000 in sales. In the process of transitioning from Greenlight to Direct, Valve mass-approved most of the 3,400 remaining games that were still in Greenlight, though the company noted that not all of these were at a state to be published. Valve anticipated that the volume of new games added to the service would further increase with Direct in place. Some groups, such as publisher Raw Fury and crowdfunding/investment site Fig, have offered to pay the Direct fee for indie developers who cannot afford it. VentureBeat compared the system to the Google Play Store.

=== Games discovery changes ===
Without more direct interaction in the curation process, Valve had looked to find methods to allow players to find games they would be more likely to buy based on previous purchase patterns. Valve has rejected the use of paid advertising or placement on the storefront, which would have created a &quot;pay to win&quot; scenario. Instead, the company had relied on algorithms and other automatic features for game discovery, which has allowed for unexpected hits to gain more visibility.

The September 2014 &quot;Discovery Update&quot; added tools that would allow existing Steam users to be curators for game recommendations, and sorting functions that presented more popular games and recommended games specific to the user. This Discovery update was considered successful by Valve, as they reported in March 2015 in seeing increased use of the Steam Storefront and an increase in 18% of sales by revenue from just prior to the update. A second Discovery update was released November 2016, giving users more control over what games they want to see or ignore within the Steam Store, alongside tools for developers and publishers to better customize and present their game.

By February 2017, Valve reported that with the second Discovery update, the number of games shown to users via the store&#x27;s front page increased by 42%, with more conversions into sales from that viewership. In 2016, more games are meeting a rough metric of success defined by Valve as selling more than $200,000 in revenues in its first 90 days of release. Valve added a &quot;Curator Connect&quot; program in December 2017. Curators can set up descriptors for the type of games they are interested in, preferred languages, and other tags along with social media profiles, while developers can find and reach out to specific curators from this information, and, after review, provide them directly with access to their game. This step, which eliminates the use of a Steam redemption key, is aimed at reducing the reselling of keys, as well as dissuading users who may be trying to game the curator system to obtain free game keys.

Valve has attempted to deal with &quot;fake games&quot;, those that are built around reused assets and little other innovation, by adding Steam Explorers atop its existing Steam Curator program. Any Steam user can sign up to be an Explorer and be asked to look at under-performing games on the service to either vouch that the game is truly original or if it is an example of a &quot;fake game&quot;, at which point Valve can take action to remove the game.

In July 2019, the Steam Labs feature was introduced as a means to showcase experimental discovery features Valve considered for including into Steam, to seek public feedback. For example, an initial experiment released at launch was the Interactive Recommender, which uses artificial intelligence algorithms pulling data from the user&#x27;s past gameplay history to suggest new games that may be of interest to them. As these experiments mature through end-user testing, they have then been brought into the storefront as direct features.

The September 2019 Discovery update, which Valve claimed would improve the visibility of niche and lesser-known games, was met with criticism from some indie game developers, who recorded a significant drop in the exposure of their games, including new wishlist additions and appearances in the &quot;More Like This&quot; and &quot;Discovery queue&quot; sections of the store.

Steam Charts were introduced in September 2022 and publicly track the storefront&#x27;s best-selling and most-played games, including historically by week and month. Charts replaced a previous statistics page to be more comprehensive, and features content that had previously been part of third-party websites including SteamSpy, SteamDB, and SteamCharts.

== Games and account policies ==
In June 2015, Valve created a formal process to allow purchasers to request refunds, with refunds guaranteed within the first two weeks as long as the player had not spent more than two hours in a game. Prior to June 2015, Valve had a no-refunds policy, but allowed them in certain circumstances, such as digital rights management issues or false advertising.

Games that are no longer available for sale for various reasons can still be downloaded and played by those who have already purchased these.

=== Quality control ===
With the launch of Steam Direct, effectively removing any curation of games by Valve prior to being published on Steam, there have been several incidents of published games that have attempted to mislead Steam users. Starting in June 2018, Valve has taken actions against games and developers that are &quot;trolling&quot; the system; in September 2018, Valve explicitly defined that trolls on Steam &quot;aren&#x27;t actually interested in good faith efforts to make and sell games to you or anyone&quot;. As an example, Valve&#x27;s Lombardi stated that the game &quot;Active Shooter&quot;, which would have allowed the player to play as either a SWAT team member tasked to take down the shooter at a school shooting incident or as the shooter themselves, was an example of trolling, as he described it was &quot;designed to do nothing but generate outrage and cause conflict through its existence&quot;. Within a month of clarifying its definition of trolling, Valve removed approximately 170 games from Steam.

In addition to removing bad actors, Valve has also taken steps to reduce the impact of &quot;fake games&quot; which could be used to manipulate the trading card marketplace or artificially boost a user&#x27;s Steam level, in addition to changes in Steam to prevent such abuse. Some of these changes have resulted in select false positives for legitimate games with unusual end-user usage patterns, such as &quot;Wandersong&quot; which was flagged in January 2019 for what the developer believed was related to near-unanimous positive user reviews from the game.

Other actions taken by developers against the terms of service or other policies have prompted Valve to remove games, which has included asset flips, review manipulation, misuse of Steamworks tools, and hostile activities towards Steam users.

Valve has banned games that incorporate blockchain-type technologies, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) since 2022 due to the questionable nature of their markets.
With the rise of generative artificial intelligence in 2023, Valve originally established that games with content generated in this manner could be distributed through Steam, though cautioned developers about assuring that they had the rights for this type of content. As greater concerns about the copyright and ethical nature of generational AI in the latter half of 2023, Valve clarified its stance in January 2024, requiring games that did use content from generational AI to disclose this on the game&#x27;s store page, including methods that the developers used to assure the AI engines did not generate illegal content. Valve updated policies in February to ban games that encorporated paid advertising as part of the gameplay cycle, such as viewing an ad for virtual rewards.

=== Mature content and moderation ===
Valve has also removed or threatened to remove games due to inappropriate or mature content, though there was often confusion as to what material qualified for this. For example, Eek Games&#x27; &quot;House Party&quot; included scenes of nudity and sexual encounters in its original release, which drew criticism from conservative religious organization National Center on Sexual Exploitation, leading Valve to remove the title. Eek Games later included censor bars within the game, allowing the game to be added back to Steam, though they offered a patch on their website to remove the bars. In May 2018, several developers of anime-stylized games that contained some light nudity, such as &quot;HuniePop&quot;, were told by Valve they had to address sexual content within their games or face removal from Steam, leading to questions of inconsistent application of Valve&#x27;s policies. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation took credit for convincing Valve to target these games. However, Valve later rescinded its orders, allowing these games to remain.

In June 2018, Valve clarified its policy on content, taking a more hands-off approach outside of illegal material. Rather than trying to make decisions themselves on what content is appropriate, Valve enhanced its filtering system to allow developers and publishers to indicate and justify the types of mature content (violence, nudity, and sexual content) in their games. Users can block games that are marked with this type of content from appearing in the store, and if they have not blocked it, they are presented with the description before they can continue to the store page. Developers and publishers with existing games on Steam have been strongly encouraged to complete these forms for these games, while Valve will use moderators to make sure new games are appropriately marked. Valve also committed to developing anti-harassment tools to support developers who may find their game amid controversy.
Until these tools were in place, some adult-themed games were delayed for release. &quot;Negligee: Love Stories&quot; developed by Dharker Studios was one of the first sexually explicit games to be offered after the introduction of the tools in September 2018. Dharker noted in discussions with Valve that they would be liable for any content-related fines or penalties that countries may place on Valve, a clause of their publishing contract for Steam, and took steps to restrict sale of the game in over 20 regions. Games that feature mature themes with primary characters that visually appear to be underaged, even if the game&#x27;s narrative establishes them as adults, have been banned by Valve.

In March 2019, Valve faced pressure over &quot;Rape Day&quot;, a planned game described as being a dark comedy and power fantasy where the player would control a serial rapist amid a zombie apocalypse. Valve ultimately decided against offering the game on Steam, arguing that while it &quot;[respects] developers&#x27; desire to express themselves&quot;, there were &quot;costs and risks&quot; associated with the game, and the developers had &quot;chosen content matter and a way of representing it that makes it very difficult for us to help them [find an audience]&quot;.

The Anti-defamation League published a report in November 2024 accusing Valve of allowing the proliferation of hate and anti-semitic content generated by users and user groups, with over 40,000 groups identified to have names referring to such extreme views. Senator Mark Warner followed with a letter to Valve, asking the company if they were following their published online content policies and to review the cases identified by the ADL.

== Platforms, devices and regions ==
Valve introduced the Steam Hardware Survey in 2003 ahead of the release of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. At that time, no information was available as to the distribution of CPU and GPU units among gamers, so Valve used the survey, which automatically collected hardware information with the user&#x27;s permission through the Steam client, to collect this information and refine the hardware targets for &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; to meet the widest possible specifications. Since then, Valve continues to use the Steam Hardware Survey to collect hardware distribution information, sharing the net results with other developers to understand the current market, as well as to make choices on when to discontinue support for older hardware and software.

=== Windows ===
Steam was originally released exclusively for Microsoft Windows in 2003, but has since been ported to other platforms. More recent Steam client versions use the Chromium Embedded Framework. To take advantage of some of its features for newer interface elements, Steam uses 64-bit versions of Chromium, which makes it unsupported on older operating systems such as Windows XP and Windows Vista. Steam on Windows also relies on some security features built into later versions of Windows. Support for XP and Vista was dropped in 2019. While users still on those operating systems can use the client, they do not have access to newer features. Around 0.2% of Steam users were affected by this when it began. In March 2023, Valve announced that Steam would drop support for Windows 7 and 8 on January 1, 2024.

=== macOS ===
Valve announced a client for macOS in March 2010. The announcement was preceded by a change in the Steam beta client to support the cross-platform WebKit web browser rendering engine instead of the Trident engine of Internet Explorer. Valve teased the release by emailing several images to Mac community and gaming websites; the images featured characters from Valve games with Apple logos and parodies of vintage Macintosh advertisements. Valve developed a full video homage to Apple&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot; Macintosh commercial to announce the availability of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; on the service; some concept images for the video had previously been used to tease the Mac Steam client.

Steam for macOS was originally planned for release in April 2010 before being pushed back to May 12, 2010. In addition to the Steam client, several features were made available to developers, allowing them to take advantage of the cross-platform Source engine and Steamworks&#x27; platform and network capabilities. Through the Steam Play functionality, the macOS client allows players who have purchased compatible products in the Windows version to download the Mac versions at no cost. The Steam Cloud, along with many multiplayer PC games, also supports cross-platform play.

=== Linux ===
In July 2012, Valve announced that it was developing a client for Linux based on the Ubuntu distribution. This announcement followed months of speculation, primarily from the website Phoronix that had discovered evidence of Linux developing in recent builds of Steam and other Valve games. Newell stated that getting Steam and games to work on Linux is a key strategy for Valve; Newell called the closed nature of Microsoft Windows 8 &quot;a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space&quot;, and that Linux would maintain &quot;the openness of the platform&quot;. Valve is extending support to any developers that want to bring their games to Linux, by &quot;making it as easy as possible for anybody who&#x27;s engaged with usputting their games on Steam and getting those running on Linux&quot;, according to Newell.

The team developing the Linux client had been working for a year before the announcement to validate that such a port would be possible. As of the official announcement, a near-feature-complete Steam client for Linux had been developed and successfully run on Ubuntu. Internal beta testing of the Linux client started in October 2012; external beta testing occurred in early November the same year. Open beta clients for Linux were made available in late December 2012, and the client was officially released in mid-February 2013. At the time of announcement, Valve&#x27;s Linux division assured that its first game on the OS, &quot;Left 4 Dead 2&quot;, would run at an acceptable frame rate and with a degree of connectivity with the Windows and Mac OS X versions. From there, it began working on porting other games to Ubuntu and expanding to other Linux distributions. Versions of Steam working under Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux were released by October 2013. There were over 500 Linux-compatible games on Steam in June 2014, and in February 2019, Steam for Linux had 5,800 native games and was described as having &quot;the power to keep Linux [gaming] alive&quot; by Engadget.

In August 2018, Valve released a beta version of Proton (named &quot;Steam Play&quot;), an open-source Windows compatibility layer for Linux, so that Linux users could run Windows games directly through Steam for Linux. Proton comprises a set of open-source tools including Wine and DXVK. The software allows the use of Steam-supported controllers, even those not compatible with Windows. Released in February 2022, Valve&#x27;s handheld computer, the Steam Deck, runs SteamOS 3.0 which is based on the Arch Linux distribution and uses Proton to support Windows-based games without native Linux ports. Valve worked with various middleware developers to make sure their tools were compatible with Proton on Linux and maximize the number of games that the Steam Deck would support. This included working with various anti-cheat developers such as Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye to make sure their solutions worked with Proton. To help with compatibility, Valve developed a classification system that they will populate to rank any game as to how well it works as a Linux native solution or through Proton.

Support for Nvidia&#x27;s proprietary deep learning super sampling (DLSS) on supported video cards and games was added to Proton in June 2021, though this is not available on the Steam Deck which is based on AMD hardware.

In March 2022, Google offered a prerelease version of Steam on Chromebooks, and entered public beta in November 2022.

=== Steamworks on consoles ===
At E3 2010, Newell announced that Steamworks would arrive on the PlayStation 3 with &quot;Portal 2&quot;. Steamworks made its debut on consoles with &quot;Portal 2&quot; PlayStation 3 release. Several featuresincluding cross-platform play and instant messaging, Steam Cloud for saved games, and the ability for PS3 owners to download &quot;Portal 2&quot; from Steam (Windows and Mac)were offered. Valve&#x27;s &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot; also supports Steamworks and cross-platform features on the PlayStation 3, including using keyboard and mouse controls as an alternative to the gamepad. Valve said it &quot;hope[s] to expand upon this foundation with more Steam features and functionality in DLC and future content releases&quot;.

The Xbox 360 does not have support for Steamworks. Newell said that they would have liked to bring the service to the console through the game &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;, but later said that cross-platform play would not be present in the final version of the game. Valve attributes the inability to use Steamworks on the Xbox 360 to limitations in the Xbox Live regulations of the ability to deliver patches and new content. Valve&#x27;s Erik Johnson stated that Microsoft required new content on the console to be certified and validated before distribution, which would limit the usefulness of Steamworks&#x27; delivery approach.

=== Mobile apps ===
Valve released an official Steam client for iOS and Android devices in late January 2012, following a short beta period. The application allows players to log into their accounts to browse the storefront, manage their games, and communicate with friends in the Steam community. The application also incorporates a two-factor authentication system that works with Steam Guard. Newell stated that the application was a strong request from Steam users and sees it as a means &quot;to make [Steam] richer and more accessible for everyone&quot;. A mobile Steam client for Windows Phone devices was released in June 2016. In May 2019, a mobile chat-only client for Steam was released under the name Steam Chat.

On May 14, 2018, a &quot;Steam Link&quot; app with remote play features was released in beta to allow users to stream games to Android phones, named after discontinued set-top box Steam Link. It was also submitted to the iOS App Store, but was denied by Apple Inc., who cited &quot;business conflicts with app guidelines&quot;. Apple later clarified its rule at the following Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in early June, in that iOS apps may not offer an app-like purchasing store, but does not restrict apps that provide remote desktop support. In response, Valve removed the ability to purchase games or other content through the app and resubmitted it for approval in June 2018, where it was accepted by Apple and allowed on their store in May 2019.

=== Steam-branded devices ===
Before 2013, industry analysts believed that Valve was developing hardware and tuning features of Steam with apparent use on its own hardware. These computers were pre-emptively dubbed as &quot;Steam Boxes&quot; by the gaming community and expected to be a dedicated machine focused on Steam functionality and maintaining the core functionality of a traditional video game console. In September 2013, Valve unveiled SteamOS, a custom Linux-based operating system they had developed specifically aimed for running Steam and games, and the final concept of the Steam Machine hardware. Unlike other consoles, the Steam Machine does not have set hardware; its technology is implemented at the discretion of the manufacturer and is fully customizable, much like a personal computer. In 2018 the Steam Machines were removed from the storefront due to low sales and small user traffic.

In November 2015, Valve released the set-top box Steam Link and Steam Controller (which was discontinued in 2019). The Steam Link removed the need for HDMI cables for displaying a PC&#x27;s screen and allowed for wireless connection when connecting to a TV. That was discontinued in 2018, but now &quot;Steam Link&quot; refers to the Remote Play mobile app that allows users to stream content, such as games, from a PC to a mobile device over a network.

Valve released the Steam Deck, a handheld gaming computer running an updated version of SteamOS, with initial shipments starting on February 25, 2022. The Deck is designed for the play of Steam games, but it can be placed into a separate dock that allows the Deck to output to an external display. The Deck was released on February 25, 2022. Among updates to Steam and SteamOS included better Proton layer support for Windows-based games, improved user interface features in the Steam client for the Steam Deck display, and adding Dynamic Cloud Saves to Steam to allow synchronizing saved games while a game is being played. Valve began marking all games on the service through a Steam Deck Validated program to indicate how compatible they were with the Steam Deck software.

=== Steam Cloud Play ===
Valve included beta support for Steam Cloud Play in May 2020 for developers to allow users to play games in their library which developers and publishers have opted to allow in a cloud gaming service. At launch, Steam Cloud Play only worked through Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce Now service and would link up to other cloud services in the future though whether Valve would run its own cloud gaming service was unclear.

=== Steam China ===
China has strict regulations on video games and Internet use; however, access to Steam is allowed through China&#x27;s governmental firewalls. Currently, a large portion of Steam users are from China. By November 2017, more than half of the Steam userbase was fluent in Chinese, an effect created by the large popularity of &quot;Dota 2&quot; and &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot; in the country, and several developers have reported that Chinese players make up close to 30% of the total players for their games.

Following a Chinese government-ordered temporary block of many of Steam&#x27;s functions in December 2017, Valve and Perfect World announced they would help to provide an officially sanctioned version of Steam that meets Chinese Internet requirements. Perfect World has worked with Valve before to help bring &quot;Dota 2&quot; and &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot; to the country through approved government processes. All games to be released on Steam China are expected to pass through the government approval process and meet other governmental requirements, such as requiring a Chinese company to run any game with an online presence.

The platform is known locally as &quot;Steam Platform&quot; () and runs independently from the rest of Steam. It was made to comply with China&#x27;s strict regulations on video games. Valve does not plan to prevent Chinese users from accessing the global Steam platform and will try to assure that a player&#x27;s cloud data remains usable between the two. The client launched as an open beta on February 9, 2021, with about 40 games available at launch. As of December 2021, only around 100 games that have been reviewed and licensed by the government are available through Steam China.

On December 25, 2021, reports emerged that Steam&#x27;s global service was the target of a domain name system attack that prevented users in China from accessing its site. The Chinese government Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) later confirmed that Chinese gamers would no longer be able to use Steam&#x27;s global service as its international domain name has been designated as &quot;illegal&quot;. The block has effectively locked all Chinese users out of games they had purchased through Steam&#x27;s international service. In 2023, reports emerged that the Steam Store could be used as normal in China, while the Steam Community was still blocked.

== Reception and impact ==
Steam&#x27;s success has led to some criticism because it supported DRM and for being an effective monopoly. In 2012, Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman called DRM using Steam on Linux &quot;unethical&quot;, but still better than Windows.

Steam&#x27;s customer service has been highly criticized, with users citing poor response times or lack of response. In March 2015, Valve was given a failing &quot;F&quot; grade from the Better Business Bureau due to a large number of complaints about Valve&#x27;s handling of Steam, leading Valve&#x27;s Erik Johnson to state that &quot;we don&#x27;t feel like our customer service support is where it needs to be right now&quot;. Johnson stated the company plans to better integrate customer support features into the Steam client and be more responsive. In May 2017, in addition to hiring more staff for customer service, Valve publicized pages that show the number and type of customer service requests it was handling over the last 90 days, with an average of 75,000 entered each day. Of those, requests for refunds were the largest segment, and which Valve could resolve within hours, followed by account security and recovery requests. Valve stated at this time that 98% of all service requests were processed within 24 hours of filing.

=== Users and revenue ===

In August 2011, Valve said Steam&#x27;s revenue, estimated to be $1 billion in 2010, was comparable to that of its published games and that this makes the company &quot;tremendously profitable.&quot; Valve reported that there were 125 million active accounts on Steam by the end of 2015. By August 2017, the company reported that there were 27 million new active accounts since January 2016, bringing the total number of active users to at least 150 million. Most accounts were from North America and Western Europe, with there being a significant growth in accounts from Asia around 2017, spurred by their work to help localize the client and make additional currency options available to purchasers. In September 2014, 1.4 million accounts belonged to Australian users; this grew to 2.2 million by October 2015.

Valve also considers concurrent users – how many accounts were logged in at the same time – a key indicator of the success of the platform. By August 2017, Valve reported that they saw a peak of 14 million concurrent players, up from 8.4 million in 2015, with 33 million concurrent players each day and 67 million each month. By January 2018, the peak online count had reached 18.5 million, with over 47 million daily active users. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, in which a large proportion of the world&#x27;s population were at home, Steam saw a concurrent player count of over 23 million in March, along with several games seeing similar record-breaking concurrent counts. The highest concurrent player count reached 39.2 million by December 2024, in part from the combined releases of &quot;Marvel Rivals&quot; and &quot; Path of Exile 2&quot;.

=== Sales and distribution ===
Steam has grown from seven games in 2004 to over 30,000 by 2019, with additional non-gaming products, such as creation software, DLC, and videos, numbering over 20,000. More than 50,000 games were on the service as of February 2021. The growth of games on Steam is attributed to changes in Valve&#x27;s curation approach, which allows publishers to add games without Valve&#x27;s direct involvement, and games supporting virtual reality technology. The addition of Greenlight and Direct has accelerated the number of games present on the service, with almost 40% of the 19,000 games on Steam by the end of 2017 having been released in 2017. Before Greenlight, Valve saw about five new games published each week. Greenlight expanded this to about seventy, and which doubled to one hundred and eighty week following the introduction of Direct.

Although Steam provides direct sales data to developers and publishers, it does not provide public sales data. In 2011, Valve&#x27;s Jason Holtman stated that the company felt that such data was outdated for a digital market. Data that Valve does provide cannot be released without permission because of a non-disclosure agreement.

Developers and publishers have asked for some metrics of sales for games, to allow them to judge the potential success of a title by reviewing how similar games have performed. Algorithms that worked on publicly available data through user profiles to estimate sales data with some accuracy led to the creation of the website Steam Spy in 2015. Steam Spy was credited with being reasonably accurate, but in April 2018, Valve added new privacy settings that defaulted to hiding user game profiles, stating this was part of compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union. The change broke the method by which Steam Spy had collected data, rendering it unusable. A few months later, another method had been developed using game achievements to estimate sales with similar accuracy, but Valve shortly changed the Steam API that reduced its functionality. Some have asserted that Valve used the GDPR change as a means to block methods of estimating sales, although Valve subsequently promised to provide tools to developers to help gain such insights that they say will be more accurate. In 2020, Simon Carless revised an approach originally proposed by Mike Boxleiter as early as 2013, with Carless&#x27;s method used to estimate sales based on the number of reviews it has on Steam based on a modified &quot;Boxleiter number&quot; used as a multiplication factor.

=== Competition and curation impact ===
The accessibility of publishing games on digital storefronts like Steam has been described as key to the popularity of indie games. As these processes allow developers to publish games on Steam with minimal oversight from Valve, journalists have criticized Valve for lacking curation policies that make it difficult to find quality games among poorly produced games, sometimes called &quot;shovelware&quot;.

Following the launch of Steam Direct, the video game industry was split on Valve&#x27;s hands-off approach. Some praised Valve for favoring avoiding trying to be a moral adjudicator of content and letting consumers decide what content they want to see, while others felt that this would encourage developers to publish games that are purposely hateful, and that Valve&#x27;s reliance on user-filters and algorithms may not succeed in blocking undesirable content. Some further criticized the decision based on the financial gain from avoiding blocking any game content, as Valve collects a cut from sales through Steam. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation denounced the policy for avoiding corporate and social responsibility &quot;in light of the rise of sexual violence and exploitation games being hosted on Steam&quot;.

Steam was estimated to have the largest share of the PC digital distribution market in the 2010s. In 2013, sales via the Steam catalog are estimated to be between 50 and 75 percent of the total PC gaming market. In 2010 and 2013, with an increase in retail copies of major game publishers integrating or requiring Steam, retailers and journalists referred to the service as a monopoly, which they claimed can be detrimental to the industry and that sector competition would yield positive results for consumers. Several developers also noted that Steam&#x27;s influence on the PC gaming market is powerful and one that smaller developers cannot afford to ignore or not work with, but believe that Valve&#x27;s corporate practices make it a type of &quot;benevolent dictator&quot;.

Because of Valve&#x27;s oversight of sales data, estimates of the market share that Steam has of the videogame market are difficult to compile. Stardock, developer of competing platform Impulse, estimated that Steam had a 70% share in 2009. In February 2011, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that Steam sales constituted 50–70% of the market for downloaded PC games and that Steam offered game producers gross margins of 70% of the purchase price, compared with 30% at retail.

Steam has been criticized for its reported 30% cut on revenue with publishers from game sales, a value that is similar to other digital storefronts according to IGN. However, some critics have asserted that the share no longer scales with cheaper costs of serving data. A 2019 Game Developers Conference survey showed only 6% of the 400 respondents deemed the share justified. Epic Games&#x27; Tim Sweeney postulated that Valve could reduce its cut to 8%, given that content delivery network costs has dropped significantly. Other services have promoted their sites having a lower cut, including the Epic Games Store and Discord.

In November 2009, online retailers Impulse, Direct2Drive and GamersGate refused to offer &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot; because it includes mandatory installation of Steamworks. Direct2Drive accused Steamworks of being a &quot;trojan horse&quot;. Valve&#x27;s business development director Jason Holtman replied Steamworks&#x27; features were chosen by developers and based on consumer wants and that &quot;Modern Warfare 2&quot; was one of Steam&#x27;s &quot;greatest sellers&quot;. In December 2010, MCV/Develop reported that &quot;key traditional retailers&quot; would stop offering games that integrate Steam.

=== Legal disputes ===
Steam&#x27;s predominance has led to Valve becoming involved in various legal cases. The lack of a formal refund policy led the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to sue Valve in September 2014 for violating Australian consumer laws that required stores to offer refunds for faulty or broken products. The ACCC won the lawsuit in March 2016, though recognizing Valve changed its policy in the interim. In December 2016, the court fined Valve , as well as requiring Valve to include proper language for Australian consumers outlining their rights when purchasing games off of Steam. In January 2018, Valve filed for special leave to appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia, but the High Court dismissed this request. In September 2018, Valve&#x27;s Steam refund policy was found to violate France&#x27;s consumer laws, and it was fined and required to modify its refund policy.

In December 2015, the French consumer group UFC-Que Choisir initiated a lawsuit against Valve for several of its Steam policies that conflicted with French law, including the restriction on reselling of purchased games, which is legal within the European Union. In September 2019, the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris found that Valve&#x27;s practice of preventing resales violated the EU’s Information Society Directive of 2001 and the Computer Programs Directive of 2009, and required them to allow it in the future. The Interactive Software Federation of Europe (ISFE) issued a statement that the French court ruling goes against established EU case law related to digital copies and threatened to upend much of the digital distribution systems in Europe should it be upheld.

In August 2016, BT Group filed a lawsuit against Valve, stating that Steam&#x27;s client infringed on four of its patents, which it said were used within Steam&#x27;s Library, Chat, Messaging, and Broadcasting services.

In 2017, the European Commission began investigating Valve and five other publishers—Bandai Namco Entertainment, Capcom, Focus Home Interactive, Koch Media, and ZeniMax Media—for anti-competitive practices, specifically the use of geo-blocking to prevent access to software within certain countries within the European Economic Area. Such practices would be against the Digital Single Market initiative set by the European Union. The French gaming trade group, Syndicat National du Jeu Vidéo, noted that geo-blocking was a necessary feature to hinder inappropriate product key reselling. The Commission found, in January 2021, that Valve and co-defendants had violated antitrust rules of the European Union, issued combined fines of , and determined that these companies may be further liable to lawsuits from affected consumers. Valve had chosen &quot;not to cooperate,&quot; and was fined , the most of any of the defendants.

A January 2021 class-action lawsuit filed against Valve asserted that it forced developers into entering a &quot;most favored nation&quot;-type of pricing contract to offer games on their storefront, which required the developers to price their games the same on other platforms as they did on Steam, thus stifling competition. &quot;Gamasutra&quot;″s Simon Carless analyzed the lawsuit and observed that Valve&#x27;s terms only apply the resale of Steam keys and not games themselves, and thus the lawsuit may be without merit.

A separate class-action lawsuit filed against Valve by Wolfire Games in April 2021 asserted that Steam is essentially a monopoly, since developers must sell to PC users through it and that its 30% cut and &quot;most favored nation&quot; pricing practices violate antitrust laws as a result of their position. Valve&#x27;s response, filed in July 2021, dismissed the complaint stating that it &quot;has no duty under antitrust law to allow developers to use free Steam Keys to undersell prices for the games they sell on Steam—or to provide Steam Keys at all&quot;. Valve defended its 30% revenue as meeting the current Industry standard and claimed Wolfire&#x27;s figure Steam&#x27;s market share to lack evidence. Wolfire&#x27;s suit was dismissed by the presiding judge in November 2021 after determining that Wolfire had failed to show that Valve had a monopoly on game sales and that the 30% cut has remained unchanged throughout Valve&#x27;s history. Wolfire refiled its case, narrowing the complaint to Valve&#x27;s use of its dominance to intimidate developers that sell their game for less on other marketplaces, which the judge allowed to proceed in May 2022. According to discovery, Valve was ordered to have Gabe Newell submit to a deposition for discussion of Valve&#x27;s business strategy related to Steam.

Valve changed the Steam terms of service in September 2024 to eliminate the forced arbitration clause, such that any disputes with the storefront are to be resolved within courtrooms, and allowing for class-action lawsuits.

<doc id="898506" wikidata="Q1145550" url="?curid=898506" title="Fastback">
<text>A fastback is an automotive styling feature, defined by the rear of the car having a single slope from the roof to the tail.

The kammback is not a fastback design with a roofline that tapers downward toward the car&#x27;s rear before being cut off abruptly.

Some models, such as the Ford Mustang, have been marketed explicitly as fastbacks, often to differentiate them from other body styles (e.g. coupé models) in the same model range.

== Definition ==
A fastback is often defined as having a single slope from the roof to the rear of the vehicle.

Traditionally a fastback will have a trunk opening that is separate from the rear window which remains in a fixed position. The term &quot;fastback&quot; is not interchangeable with &quot;liftback&quot;; the former describes the car&#x27;s shape, and the latter refers to a roof-hinged tailgate that lifts upwards for storage area access.

More specifically, the &quot;Road &amp; Track Illustrated Automotive Dictionary&quot; defines the fastback as

A closed body style, usually a coupe but sometimes a sedan, with a roof sloped gradually in an unbroken line from the windshield to the rear edge of the car. A fastback naturally lends itself to a hatchback configuration and many have it, but not all hatchbacks are fastbacks and vice versa.
In the case of the Ford Mustang, the term &quot;fastback&quot; is used to differentiate against the coupé notchback body style, which has a steeper rear window followed by a horizontal trunk lid.

==History==
Automobile designers in the 1930s began using elements of aircraft aerodynamics to streamline the boxy-looking vehicles of their day. Such designs, which were ahead of their time when exhibited during the early 1930s, included a droplet-like streamlining of the car&#x27;s rear, a configuration similar to what would become known as the &quot;fastback&quot; 25 years later. Merriam-Webster first recognized the term &quot;fastback&quot; in 1954, many years before the popularization of the term &quot;hatchback&quot;, which entered the dictionary in 1970. Opinions vary as to whether the terms are mutually exclusive.

Early examples of fastback cars include the 1929 Auburn Cabin Speedster, 1933 Cadillac V-16 Aerodynamic Coupe, 1935 Stout Scarab, 1933 Packard 1106 Twelve Aero Sport Coupe, Bugatti Type 57 Atlantic, Tatra 87, Porsche 356, Saab 92/96, Standard Vanguard, GAZ-M20 Pobeda, and Bentley Continental R-Type.

==Aerodynamic advantages==
Fastbacks provide an advantage in developing aerodynamic vehicles with a low drag coefficient. For example, although lacking a wind tunnel, Hudson designed its post-World War II cars to look aerodynamic, and &quot;tests conducted by Nash later found that the Hudson had almost 20% less drag than contemporary notchback sedans&quot;. However, the aerodynamic teardrop shape meant lower headroom for rear seat passengers, limited visibility to the rear for the driver, and also meant a less practical, elongated rear end design.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, fastbacks (known as &quot;slopers&quot;) were introduced in 1935, first designed by General Motors&#x27; Holden as one of the available bodies on Oldsmobile, Chevrolet, and Pontiac chassis. The sloper design was added by Richards Body Builders in Australia to Dodge and Plymouth models in 1937; it was subsequently adopted by Ford Australia in 1939 and 1940, as well as a sloper style made on Nash chassis. According to automotive historian G.N. Georgano, &quot;the Slopers were advanced cars for their day&quot;.

=== Europe ===
In Europe, there was a sloping rear on streamlined cars as early as 1945, from which the shapes of the Volkswagen Beetle and Porsche 356 are derived.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, the Toyota AA first adopted the fastback style in 1936. It was strongly influenced by the 1933 DeSoto Airflow. The 1965 Mitsubishi Colt 800 was the first post-war Japanese fastback, and the 1958 Subaru 360 was the first kei fastback. The Prince Skyline 1900 Sprint was developed by Prince Motor Company in 1963, but was never marketed.

Afterwards, all Japanese automakers adopted the fastback style, with the 1967 Honda N360, 1968 Nissan Sunny Coupe, 1968 Mazda Familia Rotary Coupe, 1970 Suzuki Fronte &quot;Sting Ray Look&quot;, and 1971 Daihatsu Fellow Max. From the late 1960s to the 1970s, American coke bottle styling became popular in Japan, as seen on Toyota&#x27;s 1973 Celica &quot;Liftback&quot;.

=== North America ===
In North America, the numerous marketing terms for the fastback body style included &quot;aerosedan&quot;, &quot;club coupe&quot;, &quot;sedanette&quot; and &quot;torpedo back&quot;. Cars included Cadillac&#x27;s Series 61 and 62 Club Coupes, as well as various other models from General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler.

From the early 1940s until 1950, nearly every domestic manufacturer offered at least one fastback body style within their model lineups. Although the styling was good, the cars had less trunk capacity compared to the notchback designs. In the mid-1960s, the style was revived on many GM and Ford products until the mid-1970s.

==&quot;4-door coupe&quot; ==
Marketing terminology changed in 2004, with the launch of the first generation Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class. It was described as a &quot;4-door coupé&quot;, a purely marketing term describing its fastback sedan arrangement, with fastback coupé-profiled bodywork and two doors on each side. The design reinterpreted the concept used in the 1992-1997 Infiniti J30/Nissan Leopard J Férié, which is not a true fastback.

This marketing term was followed by other competing models, such as the Audi A7 and the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé, Audi A5 Sportback, BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé, Volkswagen CC, Volkswagen Arteon, Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class, Togg T10F, Aston Martin Rapide, and Porsche Panamera.

<doc id="898509" wikidata="Q2721584" url="?curid=898509" title="Upma">
<text>Upma, uppumavu, or uppittu is a dish of thick porridge from dry-roasted semolina or coarse rice flour. Upma originated from Southern India, and is most common in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra. Often, depending on preference, it has various seasonings and/or vegetables added during cooking.

Like many South Indian dishes, Upma has also become part of Sri Lankan culinary habits (particularly those of Sri Lankan Tamils) since the 20th century.

==Etymology==
The different names for the dish derive from the combinations of the word &quot;uppu&quot;, meaning salt in Tamil and &quot;mavu&quot; meaning ground grain meal in Tamil. In North India, the dish is called &quot;upma&quot;. In Maharashtra, the dish traditionally had the name &quot;saanja&quot; in Marathi.

==Ingredients and preparation==
Upma is typically made by first lightly dry roasting semolina (called &quot;rava&quot; or &quot;sooji&quot; in India). The semolina is then taken off the fire and kept aside while spices, lentils, onion, ginger, etc are sautéed in oil or ghee. The semolina is then added back to the pan and mixed thoroughly. Boiling water is added, and the mixture is stirred until the semolina absorbs the liquid and becomes fluffy in texture.

There are several ways in which upma is made, and the variations are obtained by either adding or removing spices and vegetables. The texture can vary significantly as well, depending on how much water is added to it, and how long the mixture is allowed to remain on the flame thereafter.

==Major variations==

===Semolina upma===

The most popular version with wide variations of upma is made with whole or refined ground semolina made out of durum wheat. Sometimes a wide range of vegetables may be added, and may be garnished with a variety of beans (raw or sprouted), cashews and peanuts. For a variation called &quot;masala upma&quot; (known as &quot;kharabath&quot; in Karnataka), sambar masala or garam masala is added along with red chilli powder, instead of green chillies. This variety is more popular in Karnataka, Maharastra, Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh and is usually served in South Indian restaurants. Uppumavu paired with hand-mashed banana is a common breakfast item in Kerala homes.

===Whole wheat upma===

Whole wheat or wheat dalia (cracked wheat) is a common variation of upma in Tamil Nadu, where it is eaten for breakfast or dinner. Sometimes it is cooked with vegetables like peas, carrots, and beans.

=== Upma pesarattu ===
Upma pesarattu is the most popular version in Andhra Pradesh, Yanam and Telangana. The dish contains upma and pesarattu combined. The upma is eaten by wrapping it in the pesarattu.

===Rice upma===

Rice upma, which is mainly popular in Tamil Nadu and southern parts of Karnataka, is referred to as &quot;akki tari uppittu&quot; (rice coarse flour uppittu). Another variant of upma is prepared with grated coconut instead of onions, especially on holy days, when onion is avoided. This type of upma is generally smeared with ghee at the end of preparation. Dishes similar to upma can be made by substituting small crumbs of leftover bread or idli instead of flour. Upma made from coarser rava known as &quot;sajjige&quot; is a dish of Udupi cuisine. It is sometimes served along with snacks such as sautéed and spiced poha or chevdo.

===Corn upma===

Another variation, particularly as a breakfast dish, is corn upma, eaten with milk and nuts.

===Kesari bhath===
In Karnataka, upma is also served with another common sweet dish of Karnataka, kesari bhath (ಕೇಸರಿ ಬಾತ್), with a scoop of each on one plate, in a presentation commonly called &quot;chow chow bath&quot;.

===Aval upma/Atukula upma===
In Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, upma is made with flattened rice as a substitute for semolina. This dish is popularly called as Aval upmavu in Malayalam (അവൽ ഉപ്പുമാവ്) and Atukulu upma (అటుకులు ఉప్మా) in Telugu. This variant is also known as aval upma in the Chennai region when made with rice flakes similar to poha.

===Vermicelli upma===

A popular light evening snack is upma made with vermicelli and tomato, peas and carrot.

===Upma with ghugni===
In most parts of Odisha, a popular breakfast consists of sooji upma served with ghugni.

Due to the geography, the inhabitants historically, have been nomadic. In modern times, people have migrated to urban centres during the drought in the 1970s and the early 1980s. There are a few sedentary cultivators, who are located only in the southern regions of the country. Research has indicated that the Saharan movement has resulted in reduction of rains in the region from the 1960s, when it received close to of rainfall.

==Administration==

Trarza is divided into six departments, namely, Boutilimit, Keur Massene, Mederdra, Ouad Naga, R&#x27;Kiz and Rosso. The local administration is adopted from French local administration framework with a Ministry of Internal Control governing the local bodies. The original administration was held by governors of each district, but after the municipal elections in 1994, the powers has been decentralized from the district bodies. Mauritania has been divided into 13 &quot;wilayas&quot; (regions), including the Nouakchott Capital District. The smallest administrative division in the country is the commune and the country has 216 of them. A group of communes form a &quot;moughataa&quot; (department) and the group of &quot;moughataa&quot; form a district. There are total of 53 &quot;moughataa&quot; for the 13 districts in the country. The executive power of the district is vested on a district chief, while it is on &quot;hakem&quot; for &quot;moughataa&quot;. Out of the 216 communes, 53 classified as urban and rest 163 are rural. The communes are responsible for overseeing and coordinating development activities and are financed by the state. 

The local governments have their own legal jurisdiction, financial autonomy, an annual budget, staff, and an office. The elections for the local government are conducted every five years along with regional and parliamentary elections. On account of the political instability, the last elections were held in 2023.

<text>Basque pelota (Basque: &quot;pilota&quot;, Spanish: &quot;pelota vasca&quot;, French: &quot;pelote basque&quot;) is the name for a variety of court sports played with a ball using one&#x27;s hand, a racket, a wooden bat or a basket, against a wall (&quot;frontis or fronton&quot;) or, more traditionally, with two teams face to face separated by a line on the ground or a net. The roots of this class of games can be traced to the Greek and other ancient cultures.

The term &quot;pelota&quot; probably comes from the Vulgar Latin term &quot;pilotta&quot; (ball game). It is a diminutive form of the word &quot;pila&quot; which may relate to a hard linen or leather ball filled with &quot;pilus&quot; (fur or hair) or to the Latin words for or and is related to the English word &quot;pellet&quot;.

Today, Basque pelota is played in several countries. In Europe, this sport is concentrated in Spain and France, especially in the Basque Country. The sport is also played in Latin American countries such as Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Cuba. Operated as a gaming enterprise called jai alai, it is seen in parts of the U.S. such as Florida, Connecticut, Nevada, and Rhode Island.

In Valencia, Valencian pilota is considered the national sport; it is also played in Belgium, northern Italy, Mexico, and Argentina.

Since its creation, the International Federation of Basque Pelota has standardised the different varieties into four modalities and fourteen disciplines, with fixed ball weights, rules and court sizes. The four modalities— wall, wall, wall and &quot;trinquete&quot;—admit fourteen disciplines, depending the use of bare hand, leather ball, rubber ball, &quot;paleta&quot; (pelota paleta), racket (frontennis) and &quot;xare&quot;. Two of the fourteen disciplines are played by both men and women (frontenis and rubber pelota in trinquete); the other twelve are played only by men. This allows championship play at the international level, and allows the participation of players and teams from around the world using the same rules. There is, however, criticism about this, since purists might argue that some of the original traits of each particular modality could be lost.

Even with protection, accidents do happen. With the ball easily travelling at , pelota can kill if safety equipment is not used properly or at all; while rare, occasional deaths do occur.

== History ==

The origin of this sport is tied to the decline of the ancient jeu de paume (jeu de paume au gant), ca. 1700. While the game evolved to the modern jeu de paume (with racquet, called real tennis in England) and eventually to lawn tennis, rural Alpine and Pyrenean communities kept the tradition.

In the Basque Country the &quot; and &quot;, local versions of the paume evolved to the peculiar style of the pilota: instead of playing face to face, with a net in the midfield, the Basques began to fling the ball against a wall.

According to the Basque pilota historian Chipitey Etcheto, the first recorded matches took place in Napoleonic times; it is believed that the game was close to currently rare speciality of &quot;&quot;.

The mid-19th century saw the explosion of the &quot;pelota craze&quot;. The player &quot;Gantxiki&quot; is considered the original &quot;father&quot; of the chistera, the basket-shaped racquet that can propel the ball at high speeds, introduced around 1850.

The top champions of the end of the 19th century, such as &quot;Chiquito de Cambo&quot;, were immensely popular and the best-paid sportsmen of their time. The first official competitions were organized in the 1920s and led to the world championship in the 1950s.

In 1924, the United States built its first fronton, in Miami. During the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, Jai-Alai was especially popular in Miami and Florida, but with the growth of casinos and legalized betting in the United States, the popularity of jai-alai evaporated, and only one non-amateur fronton is still known to exist in the country.

== Countries that play pelota ==
Pelota is usually played in the Basque regions of south-western France and north-western Spain, where it originated. There are also federations of Basque ball in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Greece, India, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Sweden, the United States (including Puerto Rico), Uruguay and Venezuela. Due to the origin of the game, there are many good players who are Basques, either natives or from the Basque diaspora. The sport has been part of the Pan-American Games since 1995, but was dropped at the 1999, 2007 and 2015 editions due to its low popularity in Brazil and Canada.

=== Pelota in the Olympics ===
Basque pelota was an official Olympic sport once, in the 1900 Paris Games, and a demonstration sport in 1924 (men), 1968 (men) and 1992 (men and women). See also Basque pelota at the 1900 Summer Olympics.

In the 1900 Paris Games, there were two teams entered, France and Spain, but the French team, Maurice Durquetty and Etchegaray, withdrew on the afternoon of the contest; therefore, the contest was scratched and the Spanish team, Amezola and Villota, were awarded the gold medal.

== Playing area ==

Basque pelota is usually played in a two walled court ( or , French: &quot;fronton&quot;, Spanish: &quot;frontón&quot;). As seen in the picture, there are also courts with one wall, a modality prevailing on the French side of the Basque Country, some spots of Navarre or at the highly exceptional court of Zubieta in province Gipuzkoa. Yet they are not recognized by the International Federation of Basque Pelota for international tournaments, and usually reserved to joko-garbia and open-air grand chistera games.

=== Trinquet ===

The trinquet is a court in Pelota where there is a front wall, a glass wall on the right and a wall on the left that has a dugout built into it and lastly a wall at the back. Where the right wall and the front wall meet there is small 45-degree wall. The trinquet is 8.50 meters high, 28.50 meters long and 9.30 meters wide.

=== Mur a Gauche ===
The mur a gauche is French for &#x27;wall on the left&#x27; which it truly is, as represented in the diagram below where there is a front wall called a frontis, a left wall and a back wall called a rebot. The mur a gauche is 36 meters long, 10 meters wide and 10 meters high.

=== Jai-Alai ===
The Jai-Alai court has the same layout as the mur a gauche, but instead of being 36 meters long, it is 54 meters long.

== Rules (hand pilota) ==

The basic principle in hand-pelota is that there are two teams of two players each. The team to serve bounces the ball, then propels it towards the playing area of the narrow, front wall where it has to rebound between the low line demarcating the low off-area and the high line demarcating the high off-area.

The ball may either be played so it rebounds directly off the front wall onto the playing floor or onto the long side wall first. The opposing team may either play the ball immediately after rebounding from the front wall or side wall without rebounding from the playing floor or after having rebounded from the playing floor once.

A team scores by:
* playing the ball in such a way that the opposing team is unable to play the ball before it has rebounded off the playing floor more than once.
* playing the ball in such a way that it rebounds off the front wall and rebounds off the floor and outside the playing area.
A team may also score by the opposing team:
* hitting the front wall but either below the low line or above the high line.
* hitting the ball in time but failing to reach the front wall.

== Equipment ==

=== The ball ===
The ball used to play pelota is called &quot;pilota&quot; in Basque, &quot;pelote&quot; in French, and &quot;pelota&quot; in Spanish. There are different sizes, different weights and different materials for each discipline that is played.

The ball is made out of a boxwood core from in diameter. This is wrapped in a latex wire (for Hand Pelota, Grand Chistera, Jai-Alai, and open-air Pala). The core of the ball is different for individual age groups so that the weight limit is respected. The core can also be made from latex (for Cesta Punta, Xare, Pala Corta, and Remonte).

A wire of pure new wool is then carefully wrapped carefully around the core so that the ball is round and even throughout. A structure of cotton wire is sewed on the surface of the ball so that the wool stays in place. Number eight shapes are cut out from goat skin and are sewn together onto the ball in one or two layers.

=== The gloves (&quot;chistera&quot;) ===
Some of the disciplines in pelota require the use of a glove or Chistera.

;Chistera Joko Garbi: A short and shallow glove that is used in Joko Garbi and is played on a fronton.
;Grand Chistera: A long and deep glove. In France, the grand Chistera is used to play Grand Chistera on &quot;place libre&quot;, and it is called Cesta Punta when it is played on a Jai-Alai.
;Chistera de Remonte: It is only used in Spain for Remonte (played on a Jai-Alai court). It is a shallow glove like the Chistera Joko Garbi but longer.

=== The &quot;palas&quot; and &quot;paletas&quot; ===

The Palas and Paletas are wooden made rackets that are used to strike or hit the ball. The difference between them is their weight, length, and width.

;Paleta Gomme Creuse-Paleta Goma: The larger of the two Paleta Gomme, it can weigh from 400 to 500 grams. It is used in the trinquet and on the mur a gauche.
;Paleta Gomme Pleine-Pala Ancha: This Paleta is narrower but thicker than the Paleta Gomme creuse and is also 400 to 500 grams. It is used in the trinquet and the mur a gauche as well as the fronton &#x27;place libre&#x27;.
;Paleta Cuir-Paleta Cuero: This Paleta is thicker and narrower than both of the Paleta Gomme rackets and weighs from 500 to 600 grams. It is used in the trinquet, mur a gauche and fronton &#x27;place libre&#x27;.
;Grosse Pala-Pala Corta : A Pala that is even thicker and narrower than the Paleta Cuir, which results the Pala to be from 600 to 800 grams. The Pala is used in fronton &#x27;place libre&#x27; and mur a gauche.
;Pala Larga: Only used in Spain to play a game also called Pala Larga, it is the longest and heaviest of all the Palas and Paletas with a weight of 900 grams.

== Variants ==
=== Jai alai ===

This is the version known outside Europe as jai alai. It is called &quot;zesta punta&quot; in Basque and &quot;cesta-punta&quot; in Spanish (literally: &#x27;edged basket&#x27;). It uses a special glove that extends into a long pointed curved basket (hence the name), circa 60 cm long in straight line and 110 cm by curved line. The basket (&quot;xistera&quot; in Basque and &quot;chistera&quot; in French) was introduced by Gantchiqui Dithurbide from Saint-Pée, France in 1860, and its long version by Melchior Curuchage, from Buenos Aires in 1888. The players use it to catch the rubber ball and propel it back against the main court. The Basque Government claims it as &quot;the fastest game on Earth&quot;, the record being 302 km/h or 187.65 mi/h (José Ramón Areitio at the Newport Jai Alai, Rhode Island, USA on 3 August 1979).

=== Frontenis ===

It is a modern Mexican fusion between tennis and Basque pelota. It uses tennis rackets in a short court, although the ball has a different surface to the tennis one. Men and women both play this game. It is played only in 30 meter courts.

=== Hand-pelota ===
Hand-pelota (Basque: &quot;esku huska&quot; or &quot;esku huskako pilota&quot;, Spanish: &quot;pelota a mano&quot;) is played barehanded (or with minimal protections) and with a traditional ball made of wool around a hard core and covered with leather. The standard ball should weigh 92–95 grams. It is played in the short court either individually (one vs. one) or by pairs (two vs. two). Traditionally and professionally it is reserved for men. Players can be distinguished by the swelling of their hitting hand.
It was originally played in the 13th century in the Basque region of Spain and France, and has been played for a long time in Mexico, South America, Cuba, Italy and many US states, including Florida. The sport is similar to squash or fives, players hit the ball against the end wall, trying to get the ball out of the opponent&#x27;s reach.

=== &quot;Paleta goma&quot; (rubber) ===

Also called &quot;Argentine paleta goma&quot;, this is played with a short and broad wooden bat, called &quot;paleta&quot; in both Spanish and Basque, and a gas-filled rubber ball.
The ball is neither solid nor hollow. It is made from two-halves glued together. Before being glued, the core is filled with a special gas which gives the ball firmness and bounce, and thus greater speed.
Paleta goma can be played by either men or women. This version of paleta was invented in Argentina and is widely played there. The Argentine male &quot;pelotaris&quot; are used to dominate international competitions.

=== &quot;Paleta cuero&quot; (leather) ===
This variant is played with a bat similar to the previous one but with a traditional leather ball. This game is mainly played by men.

=== &quot;Pala corta&quot; (short bat) ===

This is played with somewhat shorter but thicker and much narrower bat (&quot;pala ancha&quot;). The ball is leather or rubber. It is reserved, in principle, for men.

=== &quot;Pala larga&quot; (long bat) ===
Is played with a longer bat (&quot;pala larga&quot;), again thick and not much wide. Leather or rubber ball in the long court. In principle, this game is reserved for men.

=== &quot;Grand Chistera&quot; ===

This version of the sport is played essentially in France by 2 teams of 3 players on an outside court referred to as &quot;place libre&quot;, meaning &quot;free space&quot; in French, or &quot;Cancha&quot;, meaning &quot;court&quot; in Spanish. The court is 16 m wide and 100 m long with the limit for play being at 80 m from the wall or Fronton and has no side walls. The sport is played with the same glove as the zesta punta.

=== &quot;Joko-garbi&quot; ===
A variant of the above. The basket-glove is shorter and less deep and it is allowed to retain the ball only momentarily.
The Basque name &quot;joko garbi&quot; means &quot;pure game&quot;, in opposition to the abuse of &quot;atxiki&quot; (unfair retention of the ball), typical of the late 19th century style of playing, dubbed &quot;joko zikin&quot; (&quot;dirty game&quot;).

This game is for men only.

=== &quot;Remonte&quot; ===

Similar to joko-garbi, but the xistera is flatter and doesn&#x27;t allow the atchiki foul. It can be played by individuals or teams of two players.
This game is still performed by professionals in several Jai-Alai frontons in northern Spain.

=== &quot;Xare&quot; ===

&quot;Xare&quot; or &quot;sare&quot; (from name of the racket, which means &quot;net&quot; in Basque; also spelled &quot;share&quot; in Spanish) is played with a wooden ring strung with a net, meaning that the ball is thrown instead of hit. It is played only on the trinquet court. Xare is known for the quick, precise and sharp movements of the &quot;pelotaris&quot; who are capable of reaching balls considered impossible for &quot;pelotaris&quot; of other specialties. Bicycle-like helmets are also worn. It is traditionally strong in South American countries, especially Argentina, as a result of which it is also known as &quot;raqueta argentina&quot; and &quot;raquette argentine&quot; in Spanish and French.
== Professionalism in pelota ==
Professional competitions and exhibitions in the Basque Country are organized by Asegarce and ASPE for the discipline of handball, Orriamendi for Remonte, Inpala for Pala Larga. Various tournaments exist for Cesta Punta professional players in France and Spain.

In the United States pelota was mainly a professional sport, strongly tied to betting and the pari-mutuel system.

In professional environment is common to play special plays called &quot;quinielas&quot; well adapted to the
betting needs.

=== Main tournaments ===
* 1st Hand-pelota, singles category
* 1st Hand-pelota, doubles category
* Cuatro y Medio
* 2nd Hand-pelota, singles category

In 1994, the production company Asegarce started painting the courts green so that the ball would be more visible on TV.

Mauritania has been divided into 13 &quot;wilayas&quot; (regions), including the Nouakchott Capital District. The smallest administrative division in the country is the commune and the country has 216 of them. A group of communes form a &quot;moughataa&quot; (department) and the group of &quot;moughataa&quot; form a district. There are total of 53 &quot;moughataa&quot; for the 13 districts in the country. The executive power of the district is vested on a district chief, while it is on &quot;hakem&quot; for &quot;moughataa&quot;.

The communes are responsible for overseeing and coordinating development activities and are financed by the state. The local governments have their own legal jurisdiction, financial autonomy, an annual budget, staff, and an office. The elections for the local government are conducted every five years along with Regional and Parliamentary elections. On account of the political instability, the last elections were held in 2023.

<doc id="898527" wikidata="Q1092097" url="?curid=898527" title="Cimetière des Chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques">
<text>The Cimetière des Chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques is often claimed to be the first zoological necropolis in the modern world. The ancient Ashkelon dog cemetery predates it by thousands of years. It opened in 1899 at 4 pont de Clichy on Île des Ravageurs in Asnières-sur-Seine, Île-de-France.

This &quot;Cemetery of Dogs and Other Domestic Animals&quot; is an elaborate pet cemetery, the burial site for dogs, cats, and a wide variety of pets ranging from horses to monkeys to lions and even fish.

Located in a northwest suburb of Paris, the pet cemetery caters to a very elite clientele. It contains many ornate sculptures, and at the entry is the monument to Barry, a Saint Bernard mountain rescue dog who died in 1814. The plaque says that during his lifetime, &quot;Barry&quot; was responsible for saving the lives of 40 people lost or trapped in the mountain snow. (Barry himself is not buried at the cemetery; his preserved body is on display at the Swiss Natural History Museum in Bern.)

Some of the cemetery&#x27;s residents are famous in their own right such as Rin Tin Tin, the star of Hollywood films following his rescue during World War I, while others are the beloved pets of the wealthy who could afford this elaborate burial place such as film director Sacha Guitry. Buried here too, is the pet lion of stage actress, feminist, and co-founder of the cemetery, Marguerite Durand and the pet of Camille Saint-Saëns, composer of &quot;Carnival of the Animals&quot;.

In 1987, the government of France classified the cemetery as an historical monument. The cemetery presently is owned and managed by the city of Asnières and is open to visitors.

The impressive entrance to the cemetery was designed by noted architect Eugène Petit in Art Nouveau style.

In 1910, the gates of the cemetery were reproduced in the city of Curitiba, Brazil, for the entrance of its first urban park, Passeio Público. The reference is indicated on bronze plates next to the construction.

<text>The Kabbalah Centre International is a non-profit organization located in Los Angeles, California that provides courses on the Zohar and Kabbalistic teachings online as well as through its regional and city-based centers and study groups worldwide. The Kabbalah Centre&#x27;s presentation of Kabbalah was developed by its director, Philip Berg, along with his wife, Karen Berg.

==History==

The Kabbalah Centre was founded in the United States in July 1965 initially as a publishing house called &quot;The National Institute for the Research in Kabbalah&quot; by Philip Berg (born Feivel Gruberger) and Rabbi Levi Isaac Krakovsky. It is likely that Berg was encouraged by his &quot;Rebbe&quot; and former wife&#x27;s uncle Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein to establish the publishing house to aid the funding of Brandwein&#x27;s Yeshiva in Jerusalem. Brandwein was the dean of Yeshivah Kol Yehuda, his son Rabbi Abraham Brandwein succeeded him as the head of the Yeshivah. Kol Yehuda was founded in 1922 and continues to this day. The uniqueness of &quot;Kol Yehuda&quot; is that students focus on kabbalistic study. The students would receive a salary to cover their living expenses so they can devote themselves to full-time learning, however Brandwein faced difficulty in finding funds for the yeshiva and publishing. After Brandwein&#x27;s death, and after several years in Israel, Philip Berg and his wife Karen Berg, re-established the independent U.S. Kabbalah Centre in New York City.

The Kabbalah Centre in Los Angeles was opened in 1984. After the death of Berg, Karen and Michael Berg acted as directors and spiritual teachers of the organization. The organization is a registered non-profit with over fifty branches worldwide, including major ones in Los Angeles, New York City, London and Toronto.
==Philanthropy==
The Kabbalah Centre donates to non-profit organizations and engages in volunteer work through its Charitable Causes initiative. Charitable Causes has worked with or donated to Habitat for Humanity, Partners in Health, American Red Cross, and Sunrise Day Camp.

==Teachings==

===Approach===
The Kabbalah Centre&#x27;s approach to teaching is to start students with teachings of Kabbalah that do not require knowledge of Hebrew and Jewish texts.

===Relation to religion===
According to its views, all widely held spiritual or religious belief systems are merely specific branches of universal wisdom. The effect of this is a resemblance of religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Buddhism, as well as new-age teachings, to Kabbalah. In accordance with this belief, the Kabbalah Centre does not present itself as an alternative to any religion in particular, but rather, as a supplement to it.

===The Bible===
Some biblical passages, such as the Passage of the Red Sea, are understood to be codes to life and unseen universal laws which the Zohar and writings of the Kabbalists throughout history unravel. According to Berg &quot;The Zohar reveals the dynamic interplay and interconnectedness of our universe and man&#x27;s relationship to it.&quot; The Kabbalah Centre has produced a series of the Books of the Bible with Kabbalistic commentaries to each of the Weekly portion of the Torah.

===The Light===
One should primarily be concerned with their relationship with the essence of God, rather than God itself, as it is beyond comprehension. The essence of God is referred to in its teachings as Light.

===99%===
The five senses supposedly provide access to a mere 1% of reality, which is the byproduct of a 99% reality that cannot be accessed by the senses.

===Klippot===
Kabbalah Centre teaches the Kabbalistic concept of Klippot. The idea is that everyone has a direct and clear connection to the upper metaphysical-spiritual world of the Light (Ein Sof, unbounded God), but that this channel is blocked by Klippot, restricting the spiritual energy from entering the physical body. It is through study and practice of Kabbalah teachings and Jewish law (which the Kabbalah Centre says is early rabbinistic construction to aid in practicing Kabbalah without revealing its secrets) that one removes Klippot, and it is by violence and negative behavior that one adds Klippot.

===Astrology===

The Kabbalah Centre has a strong belief in astrology and asserts that astrology has always been part of Judaism. Astrology was studied by Jewish scholars throughout the Middle Ages, though it was opposed by more philosophically inclined thinkers such as Maimonides.

There is a strong belief in the Kabbalah tradition that cosmic forces affect everything, and knowing how to understand them can prove to be valuable to the aspiring Kabbalist. Berg, the founder of the Kabbalah Centre, wrote numerous books on astrology during his career.

===Sex===
In a book written by Yehuda Berg, a former teacher at the center, he recommended that men not masturbate as semen generated without loving, shared intention does not serve its purpose. He also wrote that a man should not orgasm before the woman, as it injects selfishness into the act of love making. Other thoughts on sex include that a man should not orgasm with the woman positioned above him, as she is then drawing energies into herself from below, instead of above. The most Light is derived from sex that occurs just after midnight on Saturday morning.

==Celebrity followers==
Madonna studies regularly with a personal Kabbalah Centre rabbi, no longer gives concerts on Friday night (which is the onset of Shabbat), wears the red string around her left wrist for protection and to ward off the &quot;evil eye&quot; (&quot;Ayin Hara&quot;), has introduced Jewish ritual objects such as tefillin (&quot;phylacteries&quot;) into her videos and tithes regularly to the Kabbalah Centre. In July 2006, it was reported that Madonna was leaving the Kabbalah Centre and one media columnist speculated that one reason was alleged financial irregularities of donations to the centre. Despite uncorroborated allegations of financial irregularities, the rumour turned out to be false, and Madonna continued to attend Kabbalah Centre events. In August 2006, Madonna collaborated with the Kabbalah Centre on a project called Raising Malawi, which provided relief aid to the African nation of Malawi.

Celebrity followers include Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Demi Moore, James Van Der Beek, Marla Maples, Madonna, Ariana Grande, Frankie Grande, and more, according to social media, etc.

Celebrities that have been associated with the Centre include Britney Spears, Diane Keaton, Roseanne Barr, Sandra Bernhard, Anthony Kiedis, Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall, Lucy Liu, Alex Rodriguez, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Naomi Campbell, Donna Karan, Elizabeth Taylor, Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Kyle Richards, Heather McComb and Lindsay Lohan.

==Controversy and criticism==
According to a BBC news article, Eliyahu Yardeni, a senior figure in the London Kabbalah Centre, made controversial comments regarding the Holocaust. The Kabbalah Centre also made claims that spring water sold by the group had among its effects a curative effect on cancer.

Other media criticisms have alleged that The Kabbalah Centre is an &quot;opportunistic offshoot of the faith, with charismatic leaders who try to attract the rich and the vulnerable with the promise of health, wealth, and happiness.&quot;

Beginning in 2011 the centre was put under investigation by the IRS and FBI for financial malfeasance, following the abandonment of the Raising Malawi school project with millions of donors&#x27; dollars unaccounted for. In 2012, a Kabbalah Centre charity, Spirituality for Kids, accepted a $600,000 donation from an 87-year-old woman who some claim had dementia. In November 2013, two lawsuits were filed by former donors alleging that their gifts were misused.

In November 2015, the centre was ordered to pay $42,500 damages to one of its former students after it was found to have been negligent in the supervision of one of its co-directors, Yehuda Berg, who had caused emotional distress to the student.

Mauritania has been divided into 13 &quot;wilayas&quot; (regions), including the Nouakchott Capital District. The smallest administrative division in the country is the commune and the country has 216 of them. A group of communes form a &quot;moughataa&quot; (department) and the group of &quot;moughataa&quot; form a district. There are total of 53 &quot;moughataa&quot; for the 13 districts in the country. The executive power of the district is vested on a district chief, while it is on &quot;hakem&quot; for &quot;moughataa&quot;. Out of the 216 communes, 53 classified as urban and rest 163 are rural. 

The communes are responsible for overseeing and coordinating development activities and are financed by the state. The Local Governments have their own legal jurisdiction, financial autonomy, an annual budget, staff, and an office. The elections for the local government are conducted every five years along with Regional and Parliamentary elections. On account of the political instability, the last elections were held in 2023.

<text>Broadview is a neighborhood in northwestern Seattle, Washington, United States. It is at the northwestern corner of the city, adjacent to Puget Sound and the city of Shoreline to the north. The neighborhood is predominantly residential and includes portions of Carkeek Park.

==Name==

The name &quot;Broadview&quot; was given to the neighborhood because of its panoramic views of the Puget Sound and Olympic Mountains, which can be viewed to the west from its steep, westerly hillsides.

==History==

Farmers began to settle in Broadview and neighboring Bitter Lake in June 1889, after the Great Seattle Fire. These farmers had to float their goods into Seattle via the Puget Sound, because there were no roads at the time. Eventually, logging began in the area.

Broadview and neighboring Bitter Lake were annexed into the City of Seattle on January 1, 1954. The neighborhood&#x27;s first residential areas had been developed while it was unincorporated, leading to a lack of sidewalks on most minor streets.

==Geography==

Broadview is bounded on the west by Puget Sound; on the north by the Seattle city limits at N.W. 145th Street, beyond which is The Highlands community in the city of Shoreline; on the east by Greenwood Avenue N., beyond which lies the neighborhood of Bitter Lake; and on the south by Carkeek Park, beyond which, from west to east, are the neighborhoods of Blue Ridge, Crown Hill, and Greenwood.

On the western edge of Broadview is a bluff, below which runs the BNSF Railway mainline along Puget Sound. The neighborhood has several waterways, including Broadview Creek, which flow for from its headwaters near Northsite Road into Puget Sound.

==Parks and attractions==

Carkeek Park occupies the southwest corner of the neighborhood along the shoreline; within it is Pipers Creek. On the northwest side of Broadview bordering the Highlands, the Llandover Woods Greenspace is home to native habitats and hiking areas. It was acquired by the city government in 1995 and had been preserved due to limited residential development in the area. The greenspace includes old-growth forests and habitats for owls, eagles, and mountain beavers.

==Landmarks==

The Dunn Gardens were constructed in 1915 using a plan by the Olmsted Brothers, the landscape architects who designed many of Seattle&#x27;s major parks. The grounds are open for public tours and maintained by volunteers under the direction of the E.B. Dunn Historic Garden Trust, which owns the property.

The Seattle Public Library system has a branch library in Broadview that opened on January 3, 1955. It replaced a King County Library System branch in the same building that had been established in 1944 after lobbying from local community groups. A new library building at Greenwood Avenue and North 130th Street was approved in 1967, but funding was held due to city appropriations needed to renovate Sicks&#x27; Stadium for use by Major League Baseball. The Broadview Library opened on January 25, 1976, and had a collection that was designed for its suburban clientele. The library was renovated in 1988 and expanded in 2007 using funding from the 1998 Libraries for All bond measure.

==Demographics==

According to &quot;HistoryLink&quot;, the population of Broadview is approximately 13,000. The area is mainly residential.

<doc id="898541" wikidata="Q7225046" url="?curid=898541" title="Political party strength in U.S. states">
<text>Political party strength in U.S. states is the level of representation of the various political parties in the United States in each statewide elective office providing legislators to the state and to the U.S. Congress and electing the executives at the state (U.S. state governor) and national (U.S. President) level.

==History==
Throughout most of the 20th century, although the Republican and Democratic parties alternated in power at a national level, some states were so overwhelmingly dominated by one party that nomination was usually tantamount to election. This was especially true in the Solid South, where the Democratic Party was dominant for the better part of a century, from the end of Reconstruction in the late 1870s, through the period of Jim Crow Laws into the 1960s. Conversely, the rock-ribbed New England states of Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire were dominated by the Republican Party, as were some Midwestern states like Iowa and North Dakota.

However, in the 1970s and 1980s the increasingly conservative Republican Party gradually overtook the Democrats in the southeast. The Democrats&#x27; support in the formerly Solid South had been eroded during the vast cultural, political, and economic upheaval that surrounded the 1960s. By the 1990s, the Republican Party had completed the transition into the southeast&#x27;s dominant political party, despite typically having fewer members due to the prevalence of Republican voting generational Democrats. In New England, the opposite trend occurred; the former Republican strongholds of Maine and Vermont became solidly Democratic, as did formerly Republican areas of New Jersey, New York, California, and Connecticut.

In the U.S. state legislative elections of 2010, the Republican Party held an outright majority of 3,890 seats (53% of total) compared to the Democratic party&#x27;s 3,450 (47% of total) seats elected on a partisan ballot. Of the 7,382 seats in all of the state legislatures combined, independents and third parties account for only 16 members, not counting the 49 members of the Nebraska Legislature, which is the only legislature in the nation to hold non-partisan elections to determine its members. As a result of the 2010 elections, Republicans took control of an additional 20 state legislative chambers, giving them majority control of both chambers in 25 states versus the Democrats&#x27; majority control of both chambers in only 17 states, with 7 states having split or inconclusive control of both chambers (not including Nebraska). Before the 2010 elections, it was Democrats who controlled both chambers in 27 states versus the Republican party having total control in only 14 states, with 8 states divided, and Nebraska being nonpartisan.

Since this election, Republicans have maintained a majority of state legislative chambers and seats, as well as governorships nationwide. As of 2024, there are 23 Republican trifectas, 17 Democratic trifectas, and 10 divided governments with both parties holding either legislative chambers or the governorship. However, following the 2022 elections, Democratic trifectas represent a majority of the national population.

==Current party strength==
===Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI)===
Another metric measuring party preference is the Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI). Cook PVIs are calculated by comparing a state&#x27;s average Democratic Party or Republican Party share of the two-party presidential vote in the past two presidential elections to the nation&#x27;s average share of the same. PVIs for the states over time can be used to show the trends of U.S. states towards, or away from, one party or the other.

=== Gallup ===
On December 17, 2020, Gallup polling found that 31% of Americans identified as Democrats, 25% identified as Republicans, and 41% as Independent. Additionally, polling showed that 50% are either &quot;Democrats or Democratic leaners&quot; and 39% are either &quot;Republicans or Republican leaners&quot; when Independents were asked, &quot;do you lean more to the Democratic Party or the Republican Party?&quot;

In 2018, the number of competitive states according to opinion polling dropped down to 10, the lowest number since 2008. From 2017 to 2018, New Hampshire, Nevada, and Pennsylvania moved from competitive to lean Democratic, while West Virginia, Louisiana, and Indiana moved from competitive to lean Republican, and Nebraska moved from lean Republican to competitive.

As of 2018, Massachusetts was the most Democratic state, with 56% of residents identifying as Democrats, while only 27% of residents identified as Republicans. However, it is important to note that Washington D.C. (while not a state) has 3 electoral votes and 76% of residents identify as Democrats, while 6% identify as Republicans. Wyoming was the most Republican state, with 59% of residents identifying as Republicans, and only 25% of residents identifying as Democrats.
===Voter registration===
The state Democratic or Republican Party controls the governorship, the state legislative houses, and U.S. Senate representation. Nebraska&#x27;s legislature is unicameral (i.e., it has only one legislative house) and is officially non-partisan, though party affiliation still has an unofficial influence on the legislative process.

The simplest measure of party strength in a state voting population is the affiliation totals from voter registration from the websites of the Secretaries of State or state Boards of Elections for the 30 states and the District of Columbia that allow registered voters to indicate a party preference when registering to vote. 20 states do not include party preference with voter registration. The party affiliations in the party control table are obtained from state party registration figures where indicated.

As of 2024, a plurality of voters in California, Nevada, New Mexico, Louisiana, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Maine are Democratic, while a majority of voters in Maryland and Washington DC are Democratic. Meanwhile, a plurality of voters in Arizona, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Florida are Republicans. A majority of voters in Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Oklahoma are Republicans. In Oregon, Colorado, North Carolina, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Alaska, and New Hampshire, a plurality of voters are Independents. While in Massachusetts, a majority of voters are independents.

<doc id="898542" wikidata="Q3351571" url="?curid=898542" title="Bulleh Shah">
<text>Sayyid Abdullāh Shāh Qādrī (; ), popularly known as Baba Bulleh Shah and vocatively as Bulleya, was a Punjabi revolutionary philosopher, reformer and Chishti Sufi poet, regarded the &#x27;Father of Punjabi Enlightenment&#x27;; and one of the greatest poets of the Punjabi language. He criticised powerful religious, political, and social institutions; and is revered as the &#x27;Poet of the People&#x27; amongst Punjabis.

Born in Uch, Subah of Multan, Bulleh Shah belonged to a family of religious scholars. In his juvenile years, his family moved to Malakwal, and later Pandoke, in the Subah of Lahore; where he got his early education from his father, while working as a herder, in the village. He received his higher religious education at Kasur from Hafiz Ghulam Murtaza; and later studied in Lahore under Shah Inayat Qadiri.

Bulleh Shah’s poetry resonated with a wide audience due to the use of colloquial language; employing metaphors and imagery to convey complex spiritual ideas to those outside formal religious circles. He became known for his mystic poetry, which blended his philosophy of oneness of god, divine love, humanism, social equality and tolerance; and critiqued social norms and institutions for exploiting the ordinary people. His poetry caused the spread of reformist ideas throughout the Punjab, which included calls for social, religious and political reforms. Bulleh Shah&#x27;s works also left an impact on the Punjabi language, marking a new era of Punjabi literature which helped propagate a literary variety of Punjabi, based on colloquial speech, employing nuances from various local forms of the language.

He spent most of his life in Kasur, where he died at the age of 77. He is revered as the &#x27;Sheikh of Both Worlds&#x27; amongst Punjabi Muslims. His poetry has been ingrained in Punjabi proverbs, &quot;qisse&quot;, and folk traditions; and has been recited at many cultural events, particularly his &quot;kafis&quot;, including one organized by UNESCO. It has also brought fourth many modern renditions, particularly in the form of &quot;qawwali&quot;.

== Biography ==
===Early life and education===
Bulleh Shah was born around 1680 in Uch, Subah of Multan (present-day Punjab, Pakistan) in Mughal Punjab, into a Sayyid family.

Bulleh Shah&#x27;s father, Shah Muhammad Darwaish, was well-versed in Arabic, Persian, and the Quran. For unknown reasons, in his early life, his family moved to Malakwal, a village near Sahiwal. Bulleh Shah had at least one sister who was also Sufi. Both siblings never married. According to another account, he had two sisters and none of them ever married.

Later, when Bulleh Shah was six years old, his family moved to Pandoke, which is 50 miles southeast of Kasur. Bulleh Shah was schooled by his father along with the other children of the village. Most sources confirm that Bulleh Shah had to work, as a child and adolescent, as a herder in the village. It is confirmed that he received his higher education in Kasur. Some historians claim that Bulleh Shah received his education at a highly reputed madrassa run by Hafiz Ghulam Murtaza, where he taught for some time after his graduation. After his early education, he went to Lahore where he studied with Shah Inayat Qadiri, a Sufi murshid of Lahore. Bulleh Shah later became an eminent scholar of Arabic and Persian.

By social stratum, Bulleh Shah was a peasant.

===Persecution===
There is a fort-like Gurdwara in Daftuh that was built in the 18th century by the Sikh Chieftainess Bibi Isher Kaur, who donated 80 squares of land for its construction. Bulleh Shah took refuge in this Gurdwara after a group of Islamic fundamentalists started threatening his life.

In his bad times, when even his family looked down upon him (for accepting a lower-caste Shah Inayat Qadiri as a teacher), his sister loved him and stood with him.

During his lifetime, he was outcast as kafir (non-believer) by some Muslim clerics.

===Death===
He died in 1757, at the age of 77. He was buried in Kasur, where he had spent most of his life. As he was declared a kafir (a non-believer), religious fundamentalists of Kasur claimed it was prohibited to offer the prayer at his funeral. He was then buried on the outskirts of Kasur and his funeral prayer was led by Syed Zahid Hamdani, a renowned religious personality of Kasur.

===Tomb===
A dargah was built over his tomb in the following decades. It is now, officially, a protected monument under regulation of the Punjab government. 

== Poetry ==
Bulleh Shah lived after the Punjabi Sufi poet and saint Fariduddin Ganjshakar (1179–1266), and lived in the same period as other Punjabi Sufi poet Sultan Bahu (1629–1691). His lifespan also overlapped with the Punjabi poet Waris Shah (1722–1799), who is famous for &quot;Heer Ranjha&quot;, the Sindhi Sufi poet Sachal Sarmast (1739–1829), and the Pashtun poet Khushal Khattak (1613–1689). Amongst Urdu poets, Bulleh Shah lived 400 miles away from Mir Taqi Mir (1723–1810) of Delhi.

Bulleh Shah practised the Sufi tradition of Punjabi poetry established by poets like Shah Hussain (1538–1599), Sultan Bahu (1629–1691), and Shah Sharaf (1640–1724).

The verse form Bulleh Shah primarily employed is the Kafi, popular in Punjabi and Sindhi poetry. His poetry is a mixture of traditional mystic thought and intellectualism.

Many people have put his Kafis to music, from humble street-singers to renowned Sufi singers like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Fareed Ayaz, Pathanay Khan, Abida Parveen, the Waddali Brothers and Sain Zahoor, from the synthesised techno qawwali remixes of UK-based Asian artists to the Pakistani rock band Junoon.

Among the most distinguished persons to be influenced by Bulleh Shah&#x27;s poetry had been Muhammad Iqbal. It is maintained that Iqbal took his last breath while listening to his kafi.

He is the &quot;most famous and celebrated&quot; Punjabi poet and is widely recognized as &quot;poet par excellence&quot;. A sample of his poetic work is presented below:

Verse 1:

&quot;&quot;The mullah and the torch-bearer&quot;

&quot;Hail from the same stock;&quot;

&quot;They give light to others,&quot;

&quot;And themselves are in the dark.&quot;

Verse 2:

&quot;Let anyone who calls me Sayyid be punished&quot;

&quot;with the tortures of hell;&quot;

&quot;And let him revel in the pleasures of heaven,&quot;

&quot;who labels me an Arain&quot;.&quot;

== Philosophy and views ==

Bulleh Shah&#x27;s non-orthodox views and simple language played important role in popularization of his poetry. It has been noted in literature that &quot;one reason for his all-time popularity is his relatively modern vocabulary.&quot; Among the core tenets of his philosophy includes humanism, equality, tolerance, rejection of double standards, and defiance to the authority of Ulama and blind faith in their authority. For his criticism of replication of beliefs (blind faith and following), the &quot;Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare&quot; compared Bulleh Shah with Percy Bysshe Shelley. For his &quot;ruthless [analysis of] human society&quot; and an &quot;unending quest&quot; to change it, he is often compared with Karl Marx. Among major taboos in his philosophy was reciting words without comprehending them. He was a reformer with very much conscious of the contemporary religious, political and social situations.

In Bulleh Shah&#x27;s poetry, Sufism can be seen as an indigenous philosophy of political activism and class struggle and resistance to powerful institutions like religion and imperialism. Through his poems he spoke against &quot;religious, political and social patriarchal high handedness&quot; of his time. This side of his poetry is evident from his defying of the imperial ban on dancing and singing, and support for Sikhs, in general, and Guru Tegh Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh, in particular, in their struggle against the imperialist Mughal Empire. Thus, his version of Sufism is usually considered opposite to that of Ali Hajweri and other &#x27;more spiritual&#x27; sufis who were confined to their libraries and schools and rarely participated in public discourse.

Bulleh Shah was a &quot;revolutionary&quot; and &quot;rebel&quot; poet who spoke against powerful religious, political and social institutions of his time and, thus, his influence can be seen on many noted socialists, progressives and workers and women rights activists like Jam Saqi, Taimur Rahman, Bhagat Singh, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Madeeha Gauhar, and Major Ishaque Muhammad.

Humanism is the key attribute of the life and works of Bulleh Shah.

==Modern renderings==
===Bands and albums===
In the 1990s, Junoon, a rock band from Pakistan, rendered his poems &quot;Bullah Ki Jaana&quot; and &quot;Aleph&quot; (&quot;Ilmon Bas Kareen O Yaar&quot;). In 2004, Indian musician Rabbi Shergill turned the classical poem &quot;Bullah Ki Jaana&quot; into a rock/fusion song in his debut album &quot;Rabbi&quot;; the song was a chart-topper in 2005, helping the album to eventually sell over 10,000 copies and became immensely popular in India and Pakistan.

The Wadali Bandhu, a Punjabi Sufi group from India, have also released a version of &quot;Bullah Ki Jaana&quot; in their album &quot;Aa Mil Yaar... Call of the Beloved&quot;. They also worked with British-Punjabi music composer, Mukhtar Sahota, to create their own rendition of a famous Punjabi folk song, &quot;Charkha&quot; which was released in May 2007. Another version was performed by Lakhwinder Wadali and entitled &quot;Bullah&quot;. Dama Dam Mast Qalandar, a qawwali composed in honour of Shahbaz Qalandar, has been one of Bulleh Shah&#x27;s most popular poems and has been frequently rendered by many Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi singers including Noor Jehan, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Abida Parveen, Sabri Brothers, Wadali brothers, Reshman and Runa Laila. Other qawwali songs by Bulleh Shah, include &quot;Sade Vehre Aya Kar&quot; and &quot;Mera Piya Ghar Aaya&quot;.

Ali named the song &quot;Bulleh Shah&quot; in honor of the poet.

In 2016, a collaboration between two EDM artists (Headhunterz and Skytech) named &quot;Kundalini&quot; used words created by Bulleh Shah, as well as having the words Bulleh Shah in the lyrics. Bulleh Shah&#x27;s verses have been an inspiration to painters as well, as in the two series of paintings (&quot;Jogia Dhoop&quot; and &quot;Shah Shabad&quot;) by an Indian painter Geeta Vadhera inspired by the poetry of Bulleh Shah and other Sufi poets and saints. In 2017, British-Pakistani singer Yasir Akhtar used Bulleh Shah&#x27;s poetry in his song &quot;Araam Naal Kar – Take it Easy&quot;. In 2019, Sona Mohapatra used a verse of Bulleh Shah in her song &quot;R.A.T. Mashup&quot;.

==Legacy==
Academic and literary circles

The journalist Najam Sethi attempted to translate the verses of Bulleh Shah into English. However, his friend Taufiq Rafat published the finest translation of Bulleh Shah&#x27;s selected poems.

The work of Bulleh Shah influenced and inspired many other poets and artists, such as Muhammad Iqbal, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Ali Arshad Mir, and Mian Muhammad Bakhsh.

Socio-economics

In 2012, the government of Punjab, most populous province of Pakistan, renamed an important road in the provincial capital Lahore to &quot;Bulleh Shah Road&quot;. In 2021, the government of Pakistan also approved his name for a road in the country. Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;largest renewable packaging facility&quot; is also named after him. There is a housing community in Kasur called &quot;Bulleh Shah Colony.&quot; Also, a road in Kasur is called &quot;Baba Bulleh Shah Road.&quot; A roadway junction on Lahore Ring Road is called &quot;Bulleh Shah Interchange.&quot; In 2023, a public hospital in Kasur was renamed to &quot;Baba Bulleh Shah Hospital.&quot;

An educational institute called &quot;Bulleh Shah Institute&quot; is operating in Badhni Kalan, India, since 2003. Another educational institute called &quot;Bulleh Shah Law College&quot; (affiliated with University of the Punjab) operates in Kasur. In 2007, Pakistani senator Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmed raised the proposal for establishment of Bulleh Shah University in Kasur. In 2023, the National Assembly of Pakistan passed a bill, proposed by Asiya Azeem, for the establishment of &quot;Bulleh Shah International University&quot; in Kasur.

The renowned Pakistani businessman Syed Babar Ali mentioned Bulleh Shah in his autobiography, and the role played by his team in publishing his works.

Politics

In the 1960s and 1970s, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto exploited the rising popularity of the ideas of Bulleh Shah, and the slogan of &quot;Roti Kapra aur Makan&quot; (that inspired the film Roti Kapda Aur Makaan) among the common masses and emerged as a populist leader who eventually became the ninth Prime Minister of Pakistan. Bhutto used the term “Dama Dam Mast Qalandar” (a song adapted by Bulleh Shah) in 1973 to predict the political turmoil ahead.

In February 2006 then Chief Minister of Punjab Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi addressed a conference at the University of the Punjab, in which he said, Bulleh Shah and other Sufi&#x27;s &quot;were not only preachers, but also historians of social history.&quot;

In March 2013, Hamza Shahbaz (on the behalf of Punjab&#x27;s chief minister Shehbaz Sharif) inaugurated &quot;Yadgar-e-Baba Bulleh Shah&quot; (a memorial to Bulleh Shah) in Kasur. In 2015, in his address the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif recited a verse of Bulleh Shah.

In 2015, the cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan (former Prime Minister) called Bulleh Shah &quot;the great Sufi inspirational heritage of our region.&quot;

In August 2023, the caretaker chief minister of Punjab Mohsin Raza Naqvi laid the foundation stone of the extension project of the dargah of Bulleh Shah. He said, the teachings of Bulleh Shah are &quot;an enlightening as well as an illuminating chapter for us.&quot; Among the attendees were Nayyar Ali Dada.

Aseff Ahmad Daula, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, was an admirer of Bulleh Shah. In one of his essays, he equated &quot;Punjabi&quot; with the language of Bulleh Shah. Another Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri praised Bulleh Shah for &quot;always projecting truth in his verses.&quot;

<text>Negu Gorriak (Basque for &quot;Red Winters&quot; or &quot;Severe/Harsh Winters&quot;) were an underground Spanish group from the Basque Autonomous Community. Their musical style combines various styles such as hardcore punk, hip-hop, ska, and reggae, always linked to the band&#x27;s political ideology and its identification with the Basque Country and its language (Euskara).

== History ==
Negu Gorriak was formed in 1990 by the brothers Fermin and Iñigo Muguruza with Kaki Arkarazo (former members of the band Kortatu). Later in 1990, Mikel Anestesia joined them and in 1991, Mikel Bap. This was the complete membership of the group until its dissolution in 1996.

They were completely committed to the political movement, starting with their choice to sing only in Euskera and continuing through their way of work and the message in their songs. They decided to manage themselves and created the record label Esan Ozenki. They performed their first concert in front of Herrera de la Mancha maximum security prison, leading to problems with the government. They were renounced by the Guardia Civil general, Enrique Rodríguez Galindo for the lyrics of the song «Ustelkeria», which accuses the general and the Guardia Civil of being involved in drug trafficking. This was the first time since the end of Francoist Spain that the government denounced a form of expression. These charges were dropped in 2001, five years after the group stopped performing together. In honour of their legal victory, the group performed three celebratory concerts to more than 30,000 people.

== Basque nationalism and other influences ==
Negu Gorriak was formed at the end of the Basque Radical Rock movement of the 1980s, a genre most similar to punk. Their sound can be identified as a mixture of Basque Radical Rock and American hip-hop. The Basque nationalist movement greatly affected the music and actions of all the members of the group. All of their songs are in Euskera, and two of the group&#x27;s members went to adult language school (Euskaltegi) in order to be able to communicate in their language. This was a strong message to the Basque Nationalist movement, demonstrating the importance of language with regard to identity. Negu Gorriak also incorporated traditional Basque instruments into their music, such as the &quot;trikitixa&quot; (button accordion).

Negu Gorriak was also heavily influenced by American hip-hop and the African-American community. They considered Public Enemy one of their biggest influences because of their use of militant hip-hop to spread a message to African-Americans. The group related to the oppression of the African-American community because they viewed themselves, as Basques, similarly oppressed. However, when Public Enemy toured Spain, the group was disappointed that Public Enemy were ignorant to their cause. The popularity of Negu Gorriak was growing at this point throughout the world, and so they turned to other oppressed people who appreciated the ally.

Blatantly criticizing the Spanish government, Negu Gorriak songs condemn police brutality, Spanish institutions like the Catholic Church, and the past Francoist State. Their song &quot;Corruption&quot; about police brutality accused the chief of police of San Sebastián of having ties to embezzling drugs. After releasing this song, the group was tried and required to pay 15 million pesetas (approx. €90,150). Just weeks later the chief of police was convicted of the drug charges. Thus, Negu Gorriak not only used their music to express ideas and opinions, they also educated the youth about the reality of the Basque Country situation and the restrictive policies of the new government. The group logo shows two crossed axes on a red background, that some people consider to be related to ETA&#x27;s symbol, made up of a snake winding up an axe. With such a militant message, it is no surprise that the group idolised many black militants including Malcolm X, making more of a connection with the racist oppression and a marginalised form of expression, hip hop.

For these reasons, Negu Gorriak used hip hop not only to reach the young listeners, but also to make a political radical political statement. On Negu Gorriak&#x27;s album Esan Ozenki, the title of the track &quot;Napartheid&quot; (1990) is a pun cross-referencing the discrimination of the Basque culture and people in Navarre to the system of legalized racism in South Africa. Furthermore, the song continues to pull at racism with the lyrics such as &quot;the white man has invaded our earth. There is no peace, we have unearthed for always the war axe and it will stand until the death ends with us&quot;. These lyrics use the white man to symbolise the threat of Spanish nationalism and central government domination. Moreover, connecting the apartheid in South Africa with the Spanish political system draws on themes of injustice, racism, and oppression. All of these ideas allow the Basque people, like those of other regions throughout the world, use hip-hop music to make the connection between minority communities worldwide and the black experience in America. Then, the song calls for action against these restrictive institutions by saying, &quot;let’s break the chains imposed by the white man&quot;. This is the very essence of Gorriak&#x27;s music, not only creating awareness for the cause but also calling for organisation and action.

<doc id="898561" wikidata="Q610339" url="?curid=898561" title="Antwone Fisher (film)">
<text>Antwone Fisher is a 2002 American biographical drama film directed by and starring Denzel Washington in his film directing debut. Washington stars in the film as the psychiatrist Jerome Davenport, alongside Hollywood newcomer Derek Luke, who plays the title role (and personally knew the real Antwone Fisher), and former model Joy Bryant, as Fisher&#x27;s girlfriend. The film marked Luke&#x27;s film debut.

The film is inspired by a true story, with the real Antwone Fisher credited as the screenwriter and is based on his autobiographical book &quot;Finding Fish&quot;. The film was produced by Todd Black, Randa Haines, and Washington and features a soundtrack by Mychael Danna.

Black was first inspired to make the film upon hearing the story from Fisher, who was then working as a security guard at Sony Pictures Studios.

==Plot==
Antwone &quot;Fish&quot; Fisher is a temperamental young man from Cleveland, Ohio, with a violent history who is serving in the U.S. Navy. His father was killed before he was born and his teenage mother, Eva Mae Fisher, ended up arrested soon after and put in jail, where she gave birth to him. He was then placed in an orphanage until she was released and could claim him. Since she had not yet claimed him, at the age of two Antwone was placed in a foster home run by a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Tate. Antwone suffers years of physical and emotional abuse at Mrs. Tate&#x27;s hands and is molested by her adult niece Nadine. He finally leaves the home at age 14. After living out on the streets for the next few years, he decides to join the U.S. Navy to make something out of his life.

The rough life he had as a child has caused him to have a violent temper; after getting into a fight with a fellow sailor, Antwone is sentenced at a captain&#x27;s mast to be demoted, fined, and restricted to the ship for 45 days. His commanding officer also orders him to go to psychiatric treatment. Antwone goes in to meet Dr. Jerome Davenport, who attempts to get him to open up. Antwone is at first extremely resistant, but gradually comes to trust Davenport and opens up about his traumatic childhood. Meanwhile, Antwone develops feelings for fellow Navy sailor Cheryl. With Antwone still getting into altercations, Davenport tries to explore his feelings for Cheryl in order to channel Antwone&#x27;s feelings into something positive. Antwone finally goes on a date with Cheryl and establishes a relationship with her.

While on leave in Mexico, Antwone gets into a fight with a sailor who insinuates that he is gay and is thrown into jail. Davenport meets him in jail, where Antwone confides the sexual abuse he suffered as a child. Antwone eventually reveals to Cheryl that he sees a psychiatrist.

At a Thanksgiving dinner, Davenport advises Antwone to find his real family. Antwone refuses, but thanks Davenport before inviting him to a graduation ceremony. Following the graduation ceremony, Davenport tells Antwone that he&#x27;s ending the sessions and feels Antwone needs to progress on his own. Antwone breaks down, feeling everyone has abandoned him. He reveals his best friend Jesse was killed while attempting a robbery, and that he resents Jesse for leaving him behind. Realizing he needs to find his parents to find closure, Antwone asks Cheryl to go with him to Cleveland. After a dead end at social services, Antwone decides to return to the Tate household. There he confronts Nadine and Mrs. Tate about their abuse. Mrs. Tate ultimately reveals Antwone&#x27;s father&#x27;s name: Edward Elkins.

After looking through multiple telephone books, Antwone comes into contact with his aunt Annette and visits her. Antwone learns his mother lives nearby and goes to visit her. Antwone finds closure, forgives her, and leaves. When he returns to the Elkins household, he finds a feast prepared for him and finds the family he lost.

Antwone visits Davenport and thanks him for everything. Davenport then replies that it is he who should be thanking Antwone. Davenport confesses that he had been failing to deal with his own problems - particularly that he and his wife were unable to have children, and that treating Antwone prompted him to finally confront his demons. The film draws to a close as Davenport and Antwone go to eat.

==Cast==
==&quot;Finding Fish&quot;==

&quot;Finding Fish&quot; is an autobiographical account written by Antwone Fisher upon which the movie was based. The film generally follows the plot of the novel. However, the book proceeds in a linear fashion while the movie is explained through various flashbacks. The movie stresses Antwone&#x27;s relationship with his doctor, whereas the book chronicles Antwone&#x27;s entire life.

==Production==
In his novel &quot;Finding Fish&quot;, Antwone Fisher explains he took a free screenwriting class at Bethel A.M.E. Church after a chance encounter with a limo driver. The class was taught by Chris Smith, who delivered an introduction to a producer named Todd Black. Black was impressed with Fisher&#x27;s story. Black reviewed the script for a week and told Fisher that though he couldn&#x27;t make a deal, he wanted to hire him full-time as a screenwriter. Fisher wrote 41 drafts until the script was sold by Black to 20th Century Fox, who ultimately released it under their Fox Searchlight Pictures banner. The film marks the directorial debut of Denzel Washington, the first screenwriting credit for Antwone Fisher, and the first feature film role for Derek Luke. Washington was brought the script originally just to play the part of Jerome Davenport. But Washington&#x27;s agent called Black and told him he not only wanted to act in the film, he wanted it to be his directorial debut.

Fisher had known Luke as a young actor working at the Sony Pictures gift shop while he was writing the screenplay. Fisher encouraged Luke to try out for the part. An audition with casting director Robi Reed-Humes went well enough that Luke was called in to meet with Washington. Washington was impressed with Luke&#x27;s audition and asked that he personally deliver the good news. Though Luke had no prior film credits, Washington wanted to give a younger generation of Black actors the opportunity to break through. To prepare the cast, Washington required all the principal cast members to know his or her character&#x27;s history and story inside out before coming to the set, telling cast and crew, &quot;We’re doing it for Antwone.&quot;

Inspired by Fisher&#x27;s story, the filmmakers sought to give back to the communities that supported them during the shoot. In the Cleveland neighborhood where scenes of Fisher&#x27;s youth and homecoming were shot, the filmmakers renovated and reinforced structures like the apartment building where Eva Mae&#x27;s character lives. Members of the community were hired to work on the production, and Washington personally met with these people and offered his thanks for their help.

==&quot;The Slave Community&quot;==
The book &quot;The Slave Community&quot;, written by American historian John W. Blassingame and referenced in the film, was one of the first historical studies of slavery in the United States. The book contradicted others which suggested that African American slaves were largely submissive. Blassingame used psychology to determine the mentality developed by slaves during the era and possibly passed on to generations after.

Davenport suggests that Antwone read the book to understand why Mrs. Tate abused him. Davenport does not intend to justify her actions, but he seeks to help Antwone understand where her mentality of beatings and verbal abuse to keep the foster children subservient came from. Antwone is seen briefly reading the book in the next scene.

==Reception==

===Author&#x27;s reaction to the film===
When I saw the film for the first time, I was overwhelmed by a mixture of feelings: fear, joy, pride and satisfaction—all of which still linger, and I am certain they will for the rest of my life. I hope others, too, walk away with those same feelings and the courage to do something to better the lives of children in general. I hope that after seeing the movie and reading my memoir that people will see that every child has value and boundless potential and that even if all one has to give is an encouraging word as a genuine gesture of care. ... that gift alone can save a child&#x27;s life and give hope for the future.
:— Antwone Fisher

===Critical response===
Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports 78% of critics reviewed the film positively, based on 150 reviews. The website&#x27;s critic consensus says, &quot;Washington&#x27;s directing debut is a solidly crafted, emotionally touching work.&quot; Metacritic gave the movie a score of 62 based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.

Praise was given especially towards Washington&#x27;s directing and Luke&#x27;s performance. Moira Macdonald of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; wrote, &quot;There&#x27;s a simplicity and heart to &quot;Antwone Fisher&quot;, Denzel Washington&#x27;s directing debut, that&#x27;s extremely appealing; the emotional wallop of the movie sneaks up on you, despite its entirely predictable trajectory.&quot;

<text>Wallace &quot;Wally&quot; Berman (February 18, 1926 – February 18, 1976) was an American experimental filmmaker, assemblage, and collage artist and a crucial figure in the history of post-war California art.

==Personal life and education==

Wallace Berman was born in Staten Island, New York in 1926. In the 1930s his family moved to Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. 

Berman was discharged from high school for gambling in the early 1940s and became involved in the West Coast jazz scene. Berman wrote a song with Jimmy Witherspoon. He attended classes at Jepson Art Institute and Chouinard Art Institute in the 1940s. For a few years from 1949 he worked in a factory finishing furniture. It was at the factory where he began creating sculptures from wood scraps. This led to him becoming a full-time artist by the early 1950s, and to an involvement in the Beat Movement. He married Shirley Morand (aka Shirley Berman) and together they had a son Tosh in 1954. 

He moved from Los Angeles to San Francisco in late 1957 where he mostly focused on his magazine &quot;Semina&quot;, which consisted of poetry, photographs, texts, drawings and images assembled by Berman. In 1961, he came back to L.A., then moved to Topanga Canyon in 1965. He started creating his series of &quot;Verifax Collages&quot; in 1963 or 1964. Director Dennis Hopper, a collector of Berman&#x27;s work, gave Berman a small role in his 1969 film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. He produced work until his death in 1976 in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. 

Berman had said to his mother as a child he would die on his 50th birthday, which is precisely what did occur.

==Artistic career==


Berman created &quot;Verifax collages&quot;, which consist of photocopies of images from magazines and newspapers, mounted onto a flat surface in collage fashion, mixed with occasional solid areas of acrylic paint. To make them, Berman used a Verifax copier (Kodak) machine to copy images which he often juxtaposed in a grid format, creating what the critic Will Fenstermaker called &quot;psychedelic typologies.&quot;

Berman was influenced by jazz music, rock music, poetry of his Beat circle, Surrealism, Dada, as well as the Kabbalah. Though he was not religious, the influence of the Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism is seen in his collages that included Hebrew letters. These letters also appear in his only film, &quot;Aleph&quot;. His involvement with the jazz scene allowed him opportunities to work with jazz musicians, creating bebop album covers for Charlie Parker.

In 1957 Berman had his first exhibition of his artworks at the newly opened Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. His friends were the curators/owners of the gallery, Ed Kienholz, Robert Alexander and Walter Hopps. After the opening, the L.A. vice squad got a telephone tip from an anonymous caller and during the raid they found what was deemed to be a pornographic image by Cameron Parsons titled &quot;Peyote Vision&quot; at the bottom of one of Berman&#x27;s assemblage works called &quot;Temple&quot;. He later was convicted of displaying lewd and obscene materials. At the summation in the courtroom, Berman wrote on the blackboard &quot;There is no justice, only revenge&quot;. His actor-friend Dean Stockwell paid the $150 fine to release Berman. Ferus was the last showing in a public gallery for Berman during his life.

==&quot;Semina&quot;==
His mail art publication &quot;Semina&quot; was a series of folio packages that were limited edition and sent or given to his friends. &quot;Semina&quot; consisted of collages mixed with poetry by writers Michael McClure, Philip Lamantia, David Meltzer, Charles Bukowski, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Jean Cocteau, John Kelly Reed and Berman, which he published under the pseudonym Pantale Xantos. &quot;Semina&quot; was published from 1955 to 1964. The cover of the first issue of &quot;Semina&quot; featured a photograph of artist and occultist Marjorie Cameron. The volume also included Cameron&#x27;s drawing, &quot;Peyote Vision.&quot; This artwork was featured in Berman&#x27;s 1957 exhibition at Los Angeles&#x27; Ferus Gallery, which was raided and shut down by police. Investigating officers claimed that &quot;Peyote Vision&quot;, which featured two copulating figures, was pornographic and indecent, thus legitimizing their actions.

==&quot;Aleph&quot;==
Berman created a 6 minute 8mm silent experimental film entitled &quot;Aleph&quot; that he worked on from 1958 to 1976. Berman began work on &quot;Aleph&quot; soon after the release of the first issues of &quot;Semina&quot;, and the film incorporated techniques carried over from collage and painting. The film includes hand coloring, Letraset symbols, and collage portraits of pop-culture icons, which Berman superimposed on images of a Sony transistor radio. After Berman&#x27;s death, filmmaker Stan Brakhage salvaged the film and enlarged it to 16mm for public screening. The film was named &quot;Aleph&quot; by Berman’s son Tosh, after the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet which had been adopted by his father as a monogram.

==Legacy==
Berman&#x27;s likeness appears on the album cover of the Beatles&#x27; 1967 &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. The portrait is from a photograph taken by Dean Stockwell. It is directly above John Lennon, two rows up, next to Tony Curtis. In 1992 Berman&#x27;s papers were donated to the Archives of American Art by his son Tosh Berman.

<text>A goniometer is an instrument that either measures an angle or allows an object to be rotated to a precise angular position. The term goniometry derives from two Greek words, &#x27;angle&#x27; and &#x27;measure&#x27;. The protractor is a commonly used type in the fields of mechanics, engineering, and geometry.

The first known description of a goniometer, based on the astrolabe, was by Gemma Frisius in 1538.

==Protractor==

A protractor is a measuring instrument, typically made of transparent plastic, for measuring angles. Some protractors are simple half-discs or full circles. More advanced protractors, such as the bevel protractor, have one or two swinging arms, which can be used to help measure the angle.

Most protractors measure angles in degrees (°). Radian-scale protractors measure angles in radians. Most protractors are divided into 180 equal parts. Some precision protractors further divide degrees into arcminutes. A protractor divided in centiturns is normally called a &quot;percentage protractor&quot;.

===Bevel===

A bevel protractor is a graduated circular protractor with one pivoted arm; used for measuring or marking off angles. Sometimes Vernier scales are attached to give more precise readings. It has wide application in architectural and mechanical drawing, although its use is decreasing with the availability of modern drawing software or CAD.

Universal bevel protractors are also used by toolmakers; as they measure angles by mechanical contact they are classed as mechanical protractors.

The bevel protractor is used to establish and test angles to very close tolerances. It reads to 5 arcminutes (5′ or °) and can measure angles from 0° to 450°.
The bevel protractor consists of a beam, a graduated dial, and a blade which is connected to a swivel plate (with Vernier scale) by a thumb nut and clamp. When the edges of the beam and blade are parallel, a small mark on the swivel plate coincides with the zero line on the graduated dial. To measure an angle between the beam and the blade of 90° or less, the reading may be obtained directly from the graduation number on the dial indicated by the mark on the swivel plate. To measure an angle of over 90°, subtract the number of degrees as indicated on the dial from 180°, as the dial is graduated from opposite zero marks to 90° each way.
Since the spaces, both on the main scale and the Vernier scale, are numbered both to the right and the left from zero, any angle can be measured. The readings can be taken either to the right or to the left, according to the direction in which the zero on the main scale is moved.

==Applications==
===Surveying===

Prior to the invention of the theodolite, the goniometer was used in surveying. The application of triangulation to geodesy was described in the second (1533) edition of &quot;Cosmograficus liber&quot; by Petri Appiani as a 16-page appendix by Frisius entitled &quot;Libellus de locorum describendorum ratione&quot;.

===Communications ===
The Bellini–Tosi direction finder was a type of radio direction finder that was widely used from World War I to World War II. It used the signals from two crossed antennas, or four individual antennas simulating two crossed ones, to re-create the radio signal in a small area between two loops of wire. The operator could then measure the angle to the target radio source by performing direction finding within this small area. The advantage to the Bellini–Tosi system is that the antennas do not move, allowing them to be built at any required size.

The basic technique remains in use, although the equipment has changed dramatically. Goniometers are widely used for military and civil purposes, e.g. interception of satellite and naval communications on the French warship Dupuy de Lôme uses multiple goniometers.

===Crystallography===
In crystallography, goniometers are used for measuring angles between crystal faces. They are also used in X-ray diffraction to rotate the samples. The groundbreaking investigations of physicist Max von Laue and colleagues into the atomic structure of crystals in 1912 involved a goniometer.

===Light measurement===
Goniophotometers measure the spatial distribution of light visible to the human eye (often luminous intensity) at specific angular positions, usually covering all spherical angles.

===In medicine===
A goniometer is used to document initial and subsequent range of motion, at the visits for occupational injuries, and by disability evaluators to determine a permanent disability. This is to evaluate progress, and also for medico-legal purposes. It is a tool to evaluate Waddell&#x27;s signs (findings that may indicate symptom magnification.)

===Rehabilitative therapy===
In physical therapy, occupational therapy, Orthotics and prosthetics and athletic training, a goniometer measures range of motion of limbs and joints of the body. These measurements help accurately track progress in a rehabilitation program. When a patient has decreased range of motion, a therapist assesses the joint before performing an intervention, and continues to use the tool to monitor progress. The therapist can take these range of motion measurements at any joint. They typically require knowledge about the anatomy of the body, particularly bony landmarks. For example, when measuring the knee joint, the therapist places the axis (point of rotation) on the lateral epicondyle of the femur, and lines up the stationary arm with the greater trochanter of the femur. Finally, the therapist lines up the moveable arm of the goniometer with the lateral malleolus of the fibula, and records a measurement using the degree scale on the circular portion of the tool. Reading accuracy is sometimes a problem with goniometers. Issues with the intra-measure (between measures) and inter-tester (between clinicians) reliability may increase as the experience of the examiner decreases. Some studies suggest that these errors can be anywhere between 5 and 10 degrees.

These goniometers come in different forms that some argue increase reliability. The universal standard goniometer is a plastic or metal tool with 1 degree increments. The arms are usually not longer than 12-inches, so it can be hard to accurately pinpoint the exact landmark for measurement. The telescopic-armed goniometer is more reliable—with a plastic circular axis like a classic goniometer, but with arms that extend to as long as two feet in either direction.

More recently in the twenty-first century, smartphone application developers have created mobile applications that provide the functions of a goniometer. These applications (such as Knee Goniometer and Goniometer Pro) use the accelerometers in phones to calculate joint angles. Recent research supports these applications and their devices as reliable and valid tools with as much accuracy as a universal goniometer.

Modern rehabilitative therapy motion capture systems perform goniometry at the very least measuring active range of motion. While in some cases accuracy may be inferior to a goniometer, measuring angles with a motion capture system is superior at measuring during dynamic, as opposed to static situations. Furthermore, using a traditional goniometer takes valuable time. In the clinical context, performing manual measurements takes valuable time and may not be practical.

===Surface science===

====Contact angle goniometer====
In surface science, an instrument called a contact angle goniometer or tensiometer measures the static contact angle, advancing and receding contact angles, and sometimes surface tension. The first contact angle goniometer was designed by William Zisman of the United States Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. and manufactured by ramé-hart (now ramé-hart instrument company), New Jersey, USA. The original manual contact angle goniometer used an eyepiece with a microscope. Today&#x27;s contact angle goniometer uses a camera and software to capture and analyze the drop shape, and is better suited for dynamic and advanced studies.

====Surface tension====
Contact angle goniometers can also determine the surface tension for any liquid in gas or the interfacial tension between any two liquids. If the difference in densities between the two fluids is known, the surface tension or interfacial tension can be calculated by the pendant drop method. An advanced instrument often called a goniometer / tensiometer includes software tools that measure surface tension and interfacial tension using the pendant drop, inverted pendant drop, and sessile drop methods, in addition to contact angle. A centrifugal adhesion balance relates the contact angles to the adhesion of the drop to the surface. A gonioreflectometer measures the reflectivity of a surface at a number of angles.

===Positioning===
A positioning goniometer or goniometric stage is a device that rotates an object precisely about a fixed axis in space. It is similar to a linear stage—however, rather than move linearly relative to its base, the stage platform rotates partially about a fixed axis above the mounting surface of the platform. Positioning goniometers typically use a worm drive with a partial worm wheel fixed to the underside of the stage platform meshing with a worm in the base. The worm gear may be rotated manually, or by a motor in automated positioning systems.

===Knife and blade cutting edge angle measurement===
The included cutting angles of all kinds of sharp edge blades are measured using a laser reflecting goniometer. Developed by the Cutlery and Allied Trades Research Association (CATRA) in the UK, a range of devices can accurately determine the cutting edge profile, including a rounding of the tip to ½°. The included angle of a blade is important in controlling its cutting ability and edge strength—i.e., a low angle makes a thin sharp edge optimized for cutting softer materials, while a large angle makes a thick edge that is less sharp but stronger, which may be better for cutting harder materials.

===Doctor blade inspection===
Used doctor blades, from gravure and other printing and coating processes, can be inspected with a goniometer, typically with a built-in light source, to examine the blade edge for wear and correct angles. A difference in angle from that set on the machine may indicate excessive pressure, and a range of angles (&quot;rounding&quot;) probably indicates a lack of stiffness, or wear, in the blade holder assembly.

<text>Horizons of Rock Developing Everywhere or H.O.R.D.E. Festival was a touring summer rock music festival originated by the musical group Blues Traveler in 1992. In addition to travelling headliners, the festival gave exposure to bands, charities, and organizations from the local area of the concert.

==History==
The H.O.R.D.E. Festival began in 1992 as a solution to the dilemma of five East Coast bands that sought to avoid the club circuit in the summertime when other larger bands were playing to sold out amphitheaters. John Popper, the singer for Blues Traveler, explained this in a &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview: &quot;In the summer, we&#x27;d all go out and draw maybe one or two thousand people. And there are no places outdoors that small, so we&#x27;d have to play indoors, which sucked. Then a couple of us got together and wondered &#x27;What if we all went on tour? If we each drew our usual two thousand people, we might draw enough to fill a big shed (amphitheater). So from the outside, it may have looked like there was this big movement happening, but really, it was just a bunch of bands thinking about how to survive.&quot;

Inspired by the previous summer&#x27;s success of Perry Farrell&#x27;s Lollapalooza festival (which had been organized by Bill Graham Presents, the driving force behind Blues Traveler&#x27;s record and promotional deal), John Popper and Dave Frey called upon their compatriots Widespread Panic, The Samples, the Spin Doctors, the Aquarium Rescue Unit and Phish to join them in a nationwide, summer, amphitheater tour. After originally christening the traveling spectacle &quot;Horizons of Rock Developing East Coast&quot;, the vision spread to &quot;Everywhere&quot;, and so the name was created. It is rumored John Popper came up with the idea of the H.O.R.D.E. tour at Arrowhead Ranch, a Deadhead-managed dude ranch in Parksville, New York, where Phish, Blues Traveler, Spin Doctors, Widespread Panic and Aquarium Rescue Unit, among others, had played in 1991.

The H.O.R.D.E. tour can be viewed as the beginnings of the second incarnation of jam band music, as well as the improvisation, community of fans, and diversity of music that became trademarks of the genre. The initial incarnation of jam music, led and epitomized by bands like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers Band, sparked a love for improvisational rock and jazz that was fostered by both the musicians and fans associated with the second wave of &#x27;jam&#x27; music. The H.O.R.D.E. tour, featuring such new jam icons as the Spin Doctors, Phish, Widespread Panic, the Aquarium Rescue Unit (and subsequent Col. Bruce Hampton projects), including Dave Matthews Band, allowed for a new generation of experimental improvisational music to hit a national audience. The festival was able to bring together a group of musicians with a similar approach to live performance, and thus consolidate fans of the music; hence, a scene was created around the developing genre.

After seven successful years, the final H.O.R.D.E. Tour concert took place on September 5, 1998, at Portland Meadows in Portland, Oregon.

==Return==
There were rumors over the years that the band would eventually revive the H.O.R.D.E. tour. Asked about this in 2006, Blues Traveler drummer Brendan Hill replied, &quot;The future is always bright for us, and we are constantly thinking about the future, maybe two or three years in advance.&quot; The H.O.R.D.E. Festival was officially revived on July 9, 2015, featuring Blues Traveler, 311, The Verve Pipe and Big Head Todd and the Monsters. The inaugural performance was held at the DTE Energy Music Theatre in Clarkston, Michigan.

As of 2008, the economic activity rate was 59.8% and the dependency ratio was 0.69. As of 2014, 26.1% of people worked for the government, 18.5% worked for private businesses, and 22.8% were self-employed. As of 2015, 97.4% of children aged 0 to 11 months had received the DPT vaccine, 76.0% had received the BCG vaccine, and 97.4% had received the polio vaccine. As of 2008, the literacy rate for people aged 15 years and over was 63.6%. The net enrollment ratio of girls in secondary level was 19.4% and that of boys was 10.0%. The region has also become a hub for the gold mining industry. 

As of 2014, The unemployment rate of the average Mauritanian within Inchiri was 17.9%, The dependency ratio was 1.2, and the access to water was estimated to be around 87.6%. The vast majority of households as of 2014 did not have access to any type of home computer system, with the ownership rate being around 3.4%. More recent information on the current economic state of the Inchiri region remains hard to come by, as the government hasn&#x27;t updated its economic census on the region in many categories since 2008. 

The goldmine with what seems to be the most accessible information about it seems to be the Tasiast Gold Mine in Northern Inchiri. The mine seems to be operated by Tasiast Mauritanie Ltd. S.A, a subsidiary of Kinross Gold Corporation which is located in Canada. While gold is the most attractive mineral available in Inchiri, there&#x27;s multiple other minerals within the region. Those being: 

Asbestos, Beryllium, Chromium, Cobalt, Copper, Gold, Iron, Nickel, Titanium, and Tungsten. The majority of mining operations occur away from popular residential areas.

<doc id="898589" wikidata="Q1345034" url="?curid=898589" title="Eratosthenes (crater)">
<text>Eratosthenes crater is a relatively deep lunar impact crater that lies on the boundary between the Mare Imbrium and Sinus Aestuum mare regions. It forms the western terminus of the Montes Apenninus mountain range. It is named after ancient Greek astronomer Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who estimated the circumference of the Earth, and the distance from the Earth to the Sun.

==Description==
The crater has a well-defined circular rim, d inner wall, central mountain peaks, an irregular floor, and an outer of ejecta. It lacks a ray system of its own, but is overlain by rays from the prominent crater Copernicus to the south-west.

The Eratosthenian period in the lunar geological timescale is named after this crater, though it does not define the start of this time period. The crater is believed to have been formed about 3.2 billion years ago.

At low Sun-angles, this crater is prominent due to the shadow cast by the rim. When the Sun is directly overhead, however, Eratosthenes visually blends into the surroundings, and it becomes more difficult for an observer to locate it. The rays from Copernicus lie across this area, and their higher albedo serves as a form of camouflage.

In 1851 Shropshire Astronomer Henry Blunt constructed a model of the Moon&#x27;s surface showing Eratosthenes. The model is based on observations made by Blunt with a reflecting telescope from his home in Shrewsbury and was displayed in the same year at the Great Exhibition, London.

From 1910 to the 1920s, William H. Pickering noted dark patches in the crater that varied in a regular manner over each lunar day. He first put forward the speculative idea that these patches appeared to migrate across the surface, suggestive of vegetation. Pickering believed that the Moon had a thicker atmosphere and reported seeing climatic variations such as frost and snow, leading him to refer to the crater as the &quot;Gardens of Eratosthenes&quot;. Later his views would change, and he would come to believe that the vegetation was instead &quot;swarms of animal life&quot;, which he often referred to as swarms of insects, or &quot;lunar insects&quot;. The scientific community did not share his enthusiasm for these ideas, but they received a degree of attention in the popular press of the time primarily due to Pickering&#x27;s reputation.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Eratosthenes.

<doc id="898596" wikidata="Q17020450" url="?curid=898596" title="Southwide Baptist Fellowship">
<text>The Southwide Baptist Fellowship is an Independent Baptist Christian denomination in United States. It is a member of the International Baptist Network.

==Organisation==
The organizational structure of government and by-laws within the Southwide Baptist Fellowship are not available for public viewing, but the organization includes a moderator and one of its main purposes is to convene regularly for conferences.

==Beliefs==
Considered a conservative and &quot;Fundamentalist&quot; association of Baptist churches, the Southwide Baptist Fellowship is not as staunchly devoted as other Baptist Fundamentalist Fellowships to the concept of absolute autonomy (local church independence) or the essential requirement of the King James Version (KJV). Certainly, most member churches of the Southwide Baptist Fellowship are Independent Baptist and remain &quot;KJV-only&quot;.

When it originated, the Southwide Baptist Fellowship was almost identical in teaching and outlook as the core of Independent Baptist Fundamentalism. It was heavily influenced by Lee Roberson and John R. Rice. Its hallmark code of behaviors (short hair on men, dresses on women, no mixed bathing, no movies, no contemporary music) and its theology of Dispensationalism were standard for Baptist Fundamentalism. Many of its members were openly antagonistic towards the Southern Baptist Convention and were outposken critics of SBC policies which, two decades ago, permitted a certain degree of liberal theology.

===Increasing openness===
Over time, particularly since the 1990s, the Southwide Baptist Fellowship has loosened some of its more strict requirements of dress and behavior.

Currently, it remains a loose federation of Baptist churches that stand for conservatism, both religious and political, including political action, and overall it remains Dispensational in theology. It embraces but does not require strict independence.

==Splinter Organizations==

Once Southwide began to open up to more Southern Baptists and Contemporary Christian influences, the more conservative, KJV Only sections began forming separate fellowships such as the Nationwide Independent Baptist Fellowship, now known as the Atlanta Super Conference, and more recently the new Southwide Independent Baptist Fellowship. Both of these groups have been influenced by leaders from independent Baptist institutions such as Crown College (Tennessee), West Coast Baptist College and Hyles-Anderson College.

<doc id="898605" wikidata="Q2137517" url="?curid=898605" title="Rain sensor">
<text>A rain sensor or &quot;rain switch&quot; is a switching device activated 
by rainfall. There are two main applications for rain sensors. The first is a water conservation device connected to an automatic irrigation system that causes the system to shut down in the event of rainfall. The second is a device used to protect the interior of an automobile from rain and to support the automatic mode of 
windscreen wipers.

== Principle of operation ==
The rain sensor works on the principle of total internal reflection. An infrared light shone at a 45-degree angle on a clear area of the windshield is reflected and is sensed by the sensor inside the car. When it rains, the wet glass causes the light to scatter and a lesser amount of light gets reflected back to the sensor.

An additional application in professional satellite communications antennas is to trigger a rain blower on the aperture of the antenna feed, to remove water droplets from the mylar cover that keeps pressurized and dry air inside the wave-guides.

==Irrigation sensors==
Rain sensors for irrigation systems are available in both wireless and hard-wired versions, most employing hygroscopic disks that swell in the presence of rain and shrink back down again as they dry out — an electrical switch is in turn depressed or released by the hygroscopic disk stack, and the rate of drying is typically adjusted by controlling the ventilation reaching the stack. However, some electrical type sensors are also marketed that use tipping bucket or conductance type probes to measure rainfall. Wireless and wired versions both use similar mechanisms to temporarily suspend watering by the irrigation controller specifically they are connected to the irrigation controller&#x27;s sensor terminals, or are installed in series with the solenoid valve common circuit such that they prevent the opening of any valves when rain has been sensed.

Some irrigation rain sensors also contain a freeze sensor to keep the system from operating in freezing temperatures, particularly where irrigation systems are still used over the winter.

Some type of sensor is required on new lawn sprinkler systems in Florida, New Jersey, Minnesota, Connecticut and most parts of Texas.

==Automotive sensors==

In 1958, the Cadillac Motor Car Division of General Motors experimented with a water-sensitive switch that triggered various electric motors to close the convertible top and raise the open windows of a specially-built Eldorado Biarritz model, in case of rain. The first such device appears to have been used for that same purpose in a concept vehicle designated Le Sabre and built around 1950–51.

General Motors&#x27; automatic rain sensor for convertible tops was available as a dealer-installed option during the 1950s for vehicles such as the Chevrolet Bel Air.

For the 1996 model year, Cadillac once again equipped cars with an automatic rain sensor; this time to automatically trigger the windshield wipers and adjust their speed to conditions as necessary.

In December 2017 Tesla started rolling out an OTA update (2017.52.3) enabling their AP2.x cars to utilize the onboard cameras to passively detect rain without the use of a dedicated sensor.

Most vehicles with this feature have an &quot;auto&quot; position on the control column.

==Physics of rain sensor==

The most common modern rain sensors are based on the principle of total internal reflection. At all times, an infrared light is beamed at a 45-degree angle into the windshield from the interior. If the glass is dry, the critical angle for total internal refraction is around 42°. This value is obtained with the total internal refraction formula.

formula_1

where formula_2 is the approximate value of air&#x27;s refraction index for infrared and formula_3 is the approximate value of the glass refraction index, also for infrared. Since the incident angle of light is 45°, all the light is reflected, and the detector receives maximum intensity.

If the glass is wet, the critical angle changes to around 60° because the refraction index of water is higher than air (formula_4). In that case, because the incident angle is 45°, total internal reflection is not obtained. Part of the light beam is transmitted through the glass, and the intensity measured for reflection is lower: the system detects water, and the wipers turn on.

<doc id="898606" wikidata="Q9294355" url="?curid=898606" title="Joe Bob Briggs">
<text>John Irving Bloom (born January 27, 1953), known by the stage name Joe Bob Briggs, is an American syndicated film critic, writer, actor, comic performer, and horror host. He is known for having hosted &quot;Joe Bob&#x27;s Drive-in Theater&quot; on The Movie Channel from 1986 to 1996, the TNT television series &quot;MonsterVision&quot; from 1996 to 2000, and &quot;The Last Drive-in with Joe Bob Briggs&quot; on Shudder beginning in 2018. In 2019, he was named the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards&#x27; Monster Kid of the Year, and in 2023 was inducted into the Rondo Hatton Awards&#x27; Monster Kid Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
John Irving Bloom was born January 27, 1953, in Dallas, Texas, the son of Thelma Louise (née Berry) and Rudolph Lewis Bloom.

Bloom was raised in Little Rock, Arkansas, and by age 13 was a sportswriter at what was then the &quot;Arkansas Democrat&quot;. He won a Fred Russell-Grantland Rice Sportswriting Scholarship to Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, Tennessee, where he majored in English and wrote for the student newspaper, &quot;The Vanderbilt Hustler&quot;. After graduating in 1975, he became a reporter for &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; and later wrote for &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; magazine. Taking a leave of absence from the newspaper in order to co-write (with Jim Atkinson) his many books, the true crime book &quot;Evidence of Love&quot; (later adapted as the TV film, &quot;A Killing in a Small Town&quot;), he supported himself by writing movie reviews for the paper. There he created the humorous persona of &quot;Joe Bob Briggs&quot; to review exploitation films and other genre movies.

==Persona==
Bloom&#x27;s acting persona as &quot;Briggs&quot; is that of an unapologetic redneck Texan with an avowed love of the drive-in theaters. He specializes in humorous but appreciative reviews of B-movies and cult films, which he calls &quot;drive-in movies&quot; (as distinguished from &quot;indoor bullstuff&quot;). In addition to his usual parody of urbane, high-brow movie criticism, his columns characteristically include colorful tales of woman troubles and high-spirited brushes with the law, which inevitably conclude with his rush to catch a movie at a local drive-in, usually with female companionship. &quot;Briggs&quot; revealed in an interview that he intended the character to have an ambiguous sounding name and initially thought of calling himself &quot;Bubba Rodriguez&quot;, but was told that the name Rodriguez would be perceived as racist and decided to go with: &quot;The whitest name I could come up with.&quot;

The reviews typically end with a brief rating of the movie in question&#x27;s &quot;high points&quot;, including the types of action (represented by nouns naming objects used in fight scenes suffixed with &quot;-Fu&quot;), the number of bodies, number of female breasts bared, the notional number of total pints of blood spilled, and for appropriately untoward movies, a &quot;vomit meter&quot;.

A typical review summary might read: 

Originally, Bloom&#x27;s film reviews as &quot;Briggs&quot; were limited to pictures shown at local drive-ins, as others at the newspaper were assigned to legitimate cinema and grindhouse cinema. Later, after a tongue-in-cheek &quot;battle&quot; with his own convictions in &quot;Joe Bob Goes Back to the Drive In&quot;, he also began reviewing films released on VHS and DVD.

===Reaction to redevelopment of 42nd Street===
During the early 1980s, when New York City was in the planning stages of redeveloping its run-down 42nd Street, Times Square area, which included closing many grindhouses showing B-movies on double and triple bills around the clock, as well as many porn theaters, Briggs encouraged a &quot;postcard-Fu&quot; campaign encouraging genre-film fans to write to city officials and pressure them into saving &quot;the one place in New York City you could see a decent drive-in movie&quot;.

==Television==
In 1986, as a result of the stage show, &quot;Briggs&quot; was asked to be a guest host on &quot;Drive-in Theater&quot;, a late-night B-movie show on The Movie Channel (TMC). This led to his hosting &quot;Joe Bob&#x27;s Drive-in Theater&quot;, which ran from 1986 to 1996, It was twice nominated for the industry&#x27;s CableACE Award. After the show ended, he hosted the TNT network&#x27;s similar &quot;MonsterVision&quot; for four years through July 2000.

In the late 1990s, &quot;Briggs&quot; spent two seasons as a commentator on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show&quot; (under his given name, John Bloom), with a recurring segment called God Stuff. He appears in Frank Henenlotter&#x27;s documentary &quot;Herschell Gordon Lewis – Godfather of Gore&quot;.

In 2018, the horror-themed subscription video on demand service Shudder, owned and operated by AMC, signed Briggs for a new series, &quot;The Last Drive-in with Joe Bob Briggs&quot;, which premiered as a 13-film marathon on July 13, 2018. During the premiere, Shudder&#x27;s servers crashed as a result of a large number of subscribers attempting to access the show. Shudder streamed two shorter marathons on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day 2018 Beginning in March 2020, the show returned to Briggs&#x27; old double-feature format. A second season consisting of 10 films premiered April 24, 2020. Season 3 began April 16, 2021.

&quot;Briggs&quot; was also a commentator for a Fox TV news magazine for two seasons. He also appeared in episodes of the Fox sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot; in season 8 and 9 as Billy Ray Wetnap, co-owner of Pest Boys Pest Control. He also wrote and performed in specials for Fox and Showtime, and collaborated with comedy writer Norman Steinberg on an unproduced NBC sitcom.

==Magazine and newspaper writing==
&quot;Briggs&quot; has written for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;National Review&quot;,

Bloom&#x27;s two syndicated newspaper columns as &quot;Briggs&quot;, &quot;Joe Bob Goes to the Drive-in&quot; and &quot;Joe Bob&#x27;s America&quot;, were picked up by &quot;The New York Times&quot; Syndicate in the 1990s. For one year he wrote a humorous sex advice column in &quot;Penthouse&quot;. In 2000, he started writing the &quot;Drive-in&quot; column again, this time for United Press International, along with a second column, &quot;The Vegas Guy&quot;, which chronicles Briggs&#x27; weekly forays into the casinos of America.

&quot;Briggs&quot; was president of the Trinity Foundation of Dallas, a non-denominational, non-profit public foundation that serves as a religious group and publishes &quot;The Door&quot;, a Christian satire magazine, for which &quot;Briggs&quot; was a regular columnist.

==Books==
Under his given name, John Bloom, he co-wrote (with Jim Atkinson) the nonfiction book &quot;Evidence of Love: The Candy Montgomery Story&quot; (1984). The book recounts the 1980 Wylie, Texas murder case in which Montgomery killed her ex-lover&#x27;s wife, Betty Gore, by striking her 41 times with an axe and whose highly publicized trial ended in an unexpected acquittal. The book was adapted into the CBS TV film, &quot;A Killing in a Small Town&quot;, starring Barbara Hershey, and the HBO Max miniseries, &quot;Love &amp; Death,&quot; starring Elizabeth Olsen.

As &quot;Joe Bob Briggs&quot;, Bloom has published five books of satire—&quot;Joe Bob Goes to the Drive In&quot;, &quot;A Guide to Western Civilization, or My Story&quot;, &quot;Joe Bob Goes Back to the Drive In&quot;, &quot;The Cosmic Wisdom of Joe Bob Briggs&quot;, and &quot;Iron Joe Bob&quot;, his homage to the men&#x27;s movement and the nonfiction books &quot;Profoundly Disturbing: Shocking Movies That Changed History&quot; and &quot;Profoundly Erotic: Sexy Movies that Changed History&quot;.

In 2016, again under his given name, Bloom wrote the nonfiction book &quot;Eccentric Orbits: The Iridium Story&quot; in which he traces the conception, development, and launching of the Iridium satellite constellation and the race to save it from destruction.

==One-man shows==
In July 1985, Bloom&#x27;s one-man show &quot;An Evening with Joe Bob Briggs&quot; debuted in Cleveland, Ohio. Later re-titled &quot;Joe Bob Dead in Concert&quot; for home release, the show evolved into a theatrical piece involving storytelling, comedy and music. The show was performed in more than 50 venues over the next two years, including Carolines on Broadway in New York and regular engagements at Wolfgang&#x27;s and the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, as well as at convention centers, theaters, music clubs and other comedy clubs. In 2019, Briggs began performing a new one-man show, &quot;How Rednecks Saved Hollywood&quot;, at genre film festivals and revival movie houses.

==Other==
&quot;Briggs&quot; has contributed audio commentaries to DVDs released by Media Blasters and Elite Entertainment including &quot;Jesse James Meets Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Double-D Avenger&quot;, Michael Findlay&#x27;s &quot;Blood Sisters&quot;, &quot;Warlock Moon&quot;, &quot;Samurai Cop&quot;, &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot;, and several Ray Dennis Steckler films including &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot; and &quot;Blood Shack&quot;.

Bloom appeared as himself in the Jonathan Maberry novel &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; (2008). Joe Bob is one of several real-world horror celebrities who are in the fictional town of Pine Deep when monsters attack.

==Controversies==
In 1985, Briggs wrote a satirical column about the &quot;We Are the World&quot; video. The resulting controversy, which included accusations of racism towards Bloom, ended Bloom&#x27;s position at the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot;. His syndicated column changed distributors.

In May 2020, Briggs received backlash for writing articles published on the right-wing website &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in which he criticized the LGBTQ initialism &quot;and argued for the &#x27;need&#x27; to listen to white supremacist speakers.

==Personal life==
In May 2020, Bloom contracted COVID-19 but did not make his condition known to the public. Discussing the experience on the podcast &quot;Geek Tawk&quot;, Bloom stated, &quot;Many people have had [COVID-19] and most of them were much worse off than me. [...] I wish everybody thought it was a death sentence, because then everyone would wear the fucking mask and then we would get rid of it.&quot;

==Filmography==
===Podcast appearances===
&quot;Briggs&quot; appeared on Ken Reid&#x27;s &quot;TV Guidance Counselor&quot; podcast on June 16, 2016, as well as the podcasts &quot;Frightday&quot; on July 11, 2018, &quot;Astonishing Legends Podcast&quot; on December 9, 2018, and &quot;The Last Podcast on the Left&quot; on March 28, 2019.

Fury of the Gods&quot;.

In 2023, he co-founded the media company Ghost Machine alongside several other comic book writers and artists to publish independent work.

==Early life==
Geoff Johns was born January 25, 1973, in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Barbara and Fred Johns. He is of half-Lebanese ancestry and grew up in the suburbs of Grosse Pointe and Clarkston. As a child, Johns and his brother first discovered comics through an old box of comics they found in their grandmother&#x27;s attic, which included copies of &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, and &quot;Batman&quot; from the 1960s and 1970s. He has named the Flash as his favorite character, stating that he owns every issue of it.

Johns eventually began to patronize a comics shop in Traverse City, recalling that the first new comics he bought were &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #3 or 4 and &quot;The Flash&quot; #348 or 349, as the latter was his favorite character. As Johns continued collecting comics, he gravitated toward DC Comics and later Vertigo, and drew comics. After graduating from Clarkston High School in 1991, he studied media arts, screenwriting, film production and film theory at Michigan State University. He graduated from Michigan State in 1995, and then moved to Los Angeles, California.

==Career==
===Early career===
In Los Angeles, Johns cold-called the office of director Richard Donner looking for an internship, and while Johns was being transferred to various people, Donner picked up the phone by accident, leading to a conversation and the internship. Johns started off copying scripts, and after about two months, was hired as a production assistant for Donner, whom Johns regards as his mentor.

While working on the production of Donner&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot;, Johns visited New York City, where he met DC Comics personnel such as Eddie Berganza, reigniting his childhood interest in comics.

Berganza invited Johns to tour the DC Comics offices, and offered Johns the opportunity to suggest ideas, which led to Johns pitching &quot;Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.&quot;, a series based on the second Star-Spangled Kid and her stepfather, to editor Chuck Kim a year later. Johns expected to write comics &quot;on the side&quot;, until he met David Goyer and James Robinson, who were working on &quot;JSA&quot;. After looking at &quot;Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.&quot;, Robinson offered Johns co-writing duties on &quot;JSA&quot; in 2000, and Johns credits both him and Mike Carlin with shepherding him into the comics industry. He also credits reading James Robinson&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Age&quot; as the book responsible for his love of the characters featured in the book, and for his decision to accept writing duties on &quot;JSA&quot;.

That same year, Johns became the regular writer on &quot;The Flash&quot; ongoing series with issue 164. Johns&#x27; work on &quot;The Flash&quot; represents one example of his modeling of various elements in his stories after aspects of his birth town, explaining, &quot;When I wrote &quot;The Flash&quot;, I turned Keystone City into Detroit, made it a car town. I make a lot of my characters from Detroit. I think self-made, blue-collar heroes represent Detroit. Wally West&#x27;s Flash was like that. I took the inspiration of the city and the people there and used it in the books.&quot; Johns&#x27; &quot;Flash&quot; run concluded with #225.

He co-wrote a &quot;Beast Boy&quot; limited series with Ben Raab in 2000 and crafted the &quot;Return to Krypton&quot; story arc in the Superman titles with Pasqual Ferry in 2002. After writing &quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 3 #57–76 (Oct. 2002–Feb. 2004) and &quot;Avengers Icons: The Vision&quot; #1–4 (Oct. 2002–Jan. 2003) for Marvel Comics, Johns oversaw the re-launch of &quot;Hawkman&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans&quot;.

Johns was responsible for the return of Hal Jordan in 2005 as the writer of the &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot; mini-series and subsequent &quot;Green Lantern&quot; ongoing title. Johns was the writer of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; crossover limited series (December 2005 – June 2006), a sequel to 1985&#x27;s &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths.&quot; Following this, Johns was one of four writers, with Mark Waid, Grant Morrison, and Greg Rucka, on the 2006–2007 weekly series &quot;52&quot;.
In 2006, Johns and Kurt Busiek co-wrote the &quot;&quot; story arc in &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Action Comics&quot;. He then reunited with Richard Donner on the &quot;Last Son&quot; storyline in &quot;Action Comics&quot; with Donner co-plotting the series with his former assistant. The &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; series by Johns and artist Dale Eaglesham began in February 2007 and six months later, he and Jeff Katz launched the new &quot;Booster Gold&quot; series. That same year, Johns helmed the critically acclaimed &quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot; storyline in the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; titles. He wrote the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; one-shot &quot;Rage of the Red Lanterns&quot; with artist Shane Davis and collaborated with Gary Frank on &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Johns and Frank produced the &quot;Brainiac&quot; storyline in which Superman&#x27;s adopted father Jonathan Kent was killed and retold Superman&#x27;s origin story in 2009&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

Also in 2009, Johns teamed with artist Ethan Van Sciver on &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot; miniseries, which centered on the return of Barry Allen as the Flash and wrote the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; limited series. Commenting on Johns&#x27;s creation of such concepts as the Blue Lantern Corps, the Red Lantern Corps, and the Indigo Tribe, DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz noted in 2010 that &quot;One of Johns&#x27; sharpest additions to DC mythology is the notion that the Green Lanterns are but one color within a rainbow spectrum, and that the other hues have their own champions. Folding in old concepts and inventing new ones, Johns has established limitless story possibilities.&quot;

===President and CCO of DC Entertainment===
On February 18, 2010, Johns was named the Chief Creative Officer of DC Entertainment, which was established to expand the DC Comics brand across other media platforms. Johns stated that the position would not affect his writing. He then co-wrote the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; series with Peter Tomasi. He and Marv Wolfman were the principal writers of &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released in 2011.

In September 2011, following the conclusion of Johns&#x27;s mini series, &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, and the crossover storyline of the same name, DC Comics instituted an initiative called The New 52, in which the publisher cancelled all of its superhero titles and relaunched 52 new series with #1 issues, wiping out most of the then-current continuity. Johns and artist Jim Lee, DC Comics&#x27; Co-Publisher, launched the line with a new &quot;Justice League&quot; series, written and illustrated by Johns and Lee, respectively. The series&#x27; first story arc was a new origin of the Justice League, which depicted the return of DC&#x27;s primary superheroes to the team. Johns&#x27;s contributions to The New 52 include a serialized Shazam! (Captain Marvel) backup feature in &quot;Justice League&quot; that began with issue #7, as well as the relaunched &quot;Aquaman&quot; and &quot;Green Lantern&quot; monthly titles.

Johns and Gary Frank collaborated on the &quot;&quot; graphic novel, an out of continuity story, released in mid-2012, which served as the first in a series of graphic novels intended to redefine Batman. In 2013, after writing &quot;Green Lantern&quot; for nine years, Johns ended his run with issue 20 of the New 52 series, which was released May 22, 2013. DC Comics&#x27; All Access webcast announced on February 4, 2014, that Johns would be writing the &quot;Superman&quot; series which would be drawn by John Romita Jr. The Johns/Romita Jr. team was joined by inker Klaus Janson. In May 2016, Johns was promoted to President and Chief Creative Officer of DC Entertainment and reported to Diane Nelson, the President of DC Entertainment.

Johns and Gary Frank collaborated on &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, a limited series featuring Superman and Doctor Manhattan. Johns and Richard Donner co-wrote &quot;The Car&quot; chapter in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1000 (June 2018) which was drawn by Olivier Coipel.

In June 2018, Johns stepped down from his executive role at DC Entertainment and entered into a writer and producer deal with Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment. He opened Mad Ghost Productions, a production company that works on film, television and comic books based on DC Comics properties.

===After DC Entertainment===
At San Diego Comic-Con in 2018, DC announced a new &quot;pop-up&quot; imprint, &quot;The Killing Zone&quot;, to be curated by Johns. It was initially set to begin publishing in May 2019. In May 2020, Johns confirmed that the imprint was in development.

In November 2020, it was announced that Johns would launch a new creator-owned series from Image Comics titled &quot;Geiger&quot; with long-time collaborator Gary Frank, to debut in April 2021. The series would be his first independent comics series in more than ten years. In September 2021 it was reported that Johns and Frank would expand &quot;The Unnamed Universe&quot; of &quot;Geiger&quot;, starting with &quot;Junkyard Joe&quot; in October 2022.

On October 12, 2023, Johns and a group of colleagues announced at the New York Comic Con that they were forming a cooperative media company called Ghost Machine, which would publish creator-owned comics, and allow the participating creators to benefit from the development of their intellectual properties. The company publishes its books through Image Comics, and its other founders includes Brad Meltzer, Jason Fabok, Gary Frank, Bryan Hitch, Francis Manapul, and Peter J. Tomasi, all of whom would produce comics work exclusively through that company. Johns&#x27; inaugural work for the company was writing &quot;Geiger: Ground Zero&quot;, a two-issue series drawing by Frank that serves as a prequel to their 2021 miniseries of the same name. Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the book centers upon a man named Tariq Geiger who lost his family and his humanity in a nuclear war, when he was transformed into the Glowing Man, a being who can absorb radiation but struggles to contain it. &quot;Ground Zero&quot; would be followed by an ongoing &quot;Geiger&quot; series.

===Film===

Johns served as a co-producer and creative consultant for the 2011 &quot;Green Lantern&quot; film directed by Martin Campbell and starring Ryan Reynolds.

Johns was an executive producer on the 2016 film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;. Following negative critical reception to the film, Johns and Jon Berg were named to jointly run the DC Extended Universe and a newly established Warner Bros. division, DC Films, in May 2016. They served as producers on the 2017 film &quot;Justice League&quot;. Johns also co-wrote the story for &quot;Aquaman&quot; with James Wan and Will Beall, co-wrote the story for &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot; with David S. Goyer and co-wrote &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; with Patty Jenkins and David Callaham. In January 2018, after &quot;Justice League&quot; underperformed at the box office, Jon Berg was replaced by Walter Hamada as the head of DC Films, with Johns still working &quot;closely&quot; with Hamada on future productions.

===Television===
&quot;Recruit&quot;, a 2005 episode of the Superman prequel series &quot;Smallville&quot;, on which Johns&#x27;s studio mate Jeph Loeb was a writer–producer, featured a villain by the name of Geoff Johns. In 2008, Johns wrote &quot;Legion&quot;, the eleventh episode of the eighth season, in which he introduced the three core members of the Legion of Super-Heroes. At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, he announced that he was writing another &quot;Smallville&quot; episode, titled &quot;Society&quot;, based on the Justice Society of America. The success of his first episode and the ambitious nature of his follow-up episode enabled the producers to transform it into a two-part story, which subsequently aired as a feature-length episode titled &quot;Absolute Justice&quot;.

In 2006, Johns co-wrote the story for the &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; episode &quot;Ancient History&quot;, which starred Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, Hawkman, Shadow Thief, and Vixen.

Johns and David S. Goyer co-wrote the pilot for the Spike TV drama &quot;Blade&quot;, which premiered in June 2006. Johns served as one of the writing staff on the television show. Later that year, Johns teamed up with Matthew Senreich of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; fame to write the screenplay for a holiday family-friendly movie titled &quot;Naughty or Nice&quot; for Dimension Films. Johns and Senreich are billed as directors of the movie, with actor/producer Seth Green set to provide a lead voice as well as serving as voice director on the film. This association led to Johns contributing material to the fourth season of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;.

In 2012, Johns joined The CW&#x27;s Green Arrow origin series &quot;Arrow&quot;, as a writer. He first contributed to the first-season episode &quot;Muse of Fire&quot;, which served as the introduction of The Huntress, the teleplay for which he co-wrote with executive producer Marc Guggenheim from a story by co-creator Andrew Kreisberg. Later in the season, Johns wrote the sixteenth episode, &quot;Dead to Rights&quot;. The episode was directed by frequent Johns collaborator Glen Winter.

On July 30, 2013, it was announced at the summer TCA tour that Johns and &quot;Arrow&quot; co-creators Kreisberg and Greg Berlanti would be introducing Barry Allen in the second season of the show, with the potential of a spin-off for the character with the 20th episode acting as a backdoor pilot. CW executives were so pleased with the handling of the character that they forwent the backdoor pilot, in favor of a full-fledged version. In May 2014, &quot;The Flash&quot; was picked up to series, to premiere later that year. Johns serves as co-developer and executive producer. He co-wrote, with Kai Yu Wu, the episodes &quot;Going Rogue&quot;, which introduces the villain Leonard Snart/Captain Cold to the series, and &quot;Revenge of the Rogues&quot;, which brought the rogue Heat Wave to the series fully after being introduced off screen in &quot;Going Rogue&quot;.

In a July 2015 interview, Johns said he was collaborating with Reginald Hudlin and Denys Cowan on a live-action digital &quot;Static&quot; series from DC and Warner Bros. Blue Ribbon division.

Kreisberg, a producer on the TV series &quot;Supergirl&quot;, credits Johns with the idea that Hank Henshaw was really Martian Manhunter during production of that series&#x27; pilot in 2015.

In July 2018, Johns announced that he would be writing and executive-producing a DC Universe television series about Courtney Whitmore, a character that he created, titled &quot;Stargirl&quot;. The series premiered in May 2020.

In April 2020, it was reported that Johns is to produce a series based on Green Lantern for HBO Max.

In October 2022, it was announced that Paramount Television Studios would develop a TV adaptation of Geiger from Johns and Justin Simien, with Johns writing the pilot, serving as showrunner, and executive producing along with Jamie Iracleanos for Mad Ghost Productions, and Gary Frank.

==Personal life==
Johns&#x27; younger sister, Courtney, was a victim of the TWA Flight 800 crash. The DC Comics superheroine Courtney Whitmore/Stargirl, whom Johns created, is based on her.

In a 2010 interview, Johns named Steve McNiven as an artist he would like to collaborate with, J. Michael Straczynski&#x27;s run on &quot;Thor&quot; as his then-favorite ongoing comic book.

Johns is a comic book retailer who co-owns Earth-2 Comics in Northridge, California.

<text>Anne Shakespeare (née Hathaway; 1556 – 6 August 1623), commonly known as Anne Hathaway, was the wife of William Shakespeare, an English poet, playwright and actor. They were married in 1582, when Hathaway was 26 years old and Shakespeare was 18. She outlived her husband by seven years. Very little is known about her life beyond a few references in legal documents. Her personality and relationship to Shakespeare have been the subject of much speculation by many historians and writers.

==Life ==
Anne Hathaway is believed to have grown up in Shottery, a village just to the west of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England. She is assumed to have grown up in the farmhouse that was the Hathaway family home, which is located at Shottery and is now a major tourist attraction for the village. Her father, Richard Hathaway, was a yeoman farmer. He died in September 1581 and left his daughter the sum of ten marks or £6 13s 4d (six pounds, thirteen shillings and fourpence) to be paid &quot;at the day of her marriage&quot;. In her father&#x27;s will, her name is listed as &quot;Agnes&quot;, leading to some scholars believing that she should be referred to as &quot;Agnes Hathaway&quot;.

===Marriage===

Hathaway married Shakespeare in November 1582, likely November 28, while already pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first child, to whom she gave birth six months later. The age difference, added to Hathaway&#x27;s antenuptial pregnancy, has been employed by some historians as evidence that it was a &quot;shotgun wedding&quot;, forced on a somewhat reluctant Shakespeare by the Hathaway family. There is, however, no other evidence for this inference.

For a time it was believed that this view was supported by documents from the Episcopal Register at Worcester, which records in Latin the issuing of a wedding licence to &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; and one &quot;Anne Whateley&quot; of Temple Grafton. The following day, Fulk Sandells and John Richardson, friends of the Hathaway family from Stratford, signed a surety of £40 as a financial guarantee for the wedding of &quot;William Shagspere and Anne Hathwey&quot;. Frank Harris, in &quot;The Man Shakespeare&quot; (1909), argued that these documents are evidence that Shakespeare was involved with two women. He had chosen to marry one, Anne Whateley, but when this became known he was immediately forced by Hathaway&#x27;s family to marry their pregnant relative. Harris believed that &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s loathing for his wife was measureless&quot; on account of this forced marriage, and that this was the spur to his decision to leave Stratford and pursue a career in the theatre.

However, according to Stanley Wells, writing in the &quot;Oxford Companion to Shakespeare&quot;, most modern scholars take the view that the name Whateley was &quot;almost certainly the result of clerical error&quot;.

Germaine Greer, in &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Wife&quot;, argues that the age difference between Shakespeare and Hathaway is not evidence that he was forced to marry her, but that he was the one who pursued her. Women such as the orphaned Hathaway often stayed at home to care for younger siblings and married in their late twenties. As a husband Shakespeare offered few prospects; his family had fallen into financial ruin, while Hathaway, from a family in good standing both socially and financially, would have been considered a catch. Furthermore, a &quot;handfast&quot; and pregnancy were frequent precursors to legal marriage at the time. Examining the surviving records of Stratford-upon-Avon and nearby villages in the 1580s, Greer argues that two facts stand out quite prominently: first, that a large number of brides went to the altar already pregnant; and second, that autumn, not spring, was the most common time to get married. Shakespeare was bound to marry Hathaway, who had become pregnant by him, but there is no reason to assume that this had not always been his intention. It is nearly certain that the respective families of the bride and groom had known one another.

Three children were born to Hathaway and her husband: Susanna in 1583 and the twins Hamnet and Judith in 1585. Hamnet died at 11 years old during one of the frequent outbreaks of the bubonic plague and was buried in Stratford-upon-Avon on 11 August 1596.

Apart from documents related to her marriage and the birth of her children, the only recorded reference to Hathaway in her lifetime is a curious bequest in the will of her father&#x27;s shepherd, Thomas Whittington, who died in 1601. Whittington left 40 shillings to &quot;the poor of Stratford&quot;, adding that the money was &quot;in the hand of Anne Shakespeare wife unto Master William Shakespeare, and is due debt unto me, being paid to mine executor by the said William Shakespeare or his assigns according to the true meaning of this my will.&quot; This passage has been interpreted in several different ways. One view is that Whittington may have lent Anne the money, presumably because she was short of cash while her husband was away. More likely, however, it may have been &quot;uncollected wages, or savings held in safekeeping&quot;, since the will also lists debts owed to him from her brothers in the same amount.

In 1607, Hathaway&#x27;s daughter Susanna married the local doctor, John Hall, giving birth to Hathaway&#x27;s and Shakespeare&#x27;s granddaughter, Elizabeth, the following year. Judith married Thomas Quiney, who was a vintner and tavern owner from a good family, in February 1616 when she was 31 and he was 27. Shakespeare may later have disapproved of this choice when it was discovered that Quiney had got another girl pregnant; also, Quiney had failed to obtain a special wedding licence needed during Lent, leading to Judith and Thomas being excommunicated on 12 March. Soon afterwards, on 25 March 1616, Shakespeare modified his will for Judith to inherit £300 in her own name, leaving Quiney out of the will and giving most of his property to Susanna and her husband.

It has sometimes been inferred that Shakespeare came to dislike his wife, but there is no existing documentation or correspondence to support this supposition. For most of their married life, he lived in London, writing and performing his plays, while she remained in Stratford. However, according to John Aubrey, he returned to Stratford for a period every year. When he retired from the theatre in 1613, he chose to live in Stratford with his wife, rather than in London.

=== Shakespeare&#x27;s will ===
In his will Shakespeare famously made only one bequest to his wife, his &quot;second-best bed with the furniture&quot;. There is no reference to the &quot;best&quot; bed, which would have been included in the main bequest to Susanna. This bequest to Anne has often been interpreted as a slight, implying that Anne was in some sense only the &quot;second best&quot; person in his intimate life. A few explanations have been offered: first, it has been claimed that, according to law, Hathaway was entitled to receive one third of her husband&#x27;s estate, regardless of his will, though this has been disputed. It has been speculated that Hathaway was to be supported by her children. Germaine Greer suggests that the bequests were the result of agreements made at the time of Susanna&#x27;s marriage to Dr Hall: that she (and thus her husband) inherited the bulk of Shakespeare&#x27;s estate. Shakespeare had business ventures with Dr Hall, and consequently appointed John and Susanna as executors of his will. Dr Hall and Susanna inherited and moved into New Place after Shakespeare&#x27;s death. This would also explain other examples of Shakespeare&#x27;s will being apparently ungenerous, as in its treatment of his younger daughter Judith.

There is indication that Hathaway may have been financially secure in her own right. The National Archives states that &quot;beds and other pieces of household furniture were often the sole bequest to a wife&quot; and that, customarily, the children would receive the best items and the widow the second-best. In Shakespeare&#x27;s time, the beds of prosperous citizens were expensive affairs, sometimes equivalent in value to a small house. The bequest was thus not as minor as it might seem in modern times. In Elizabethan custom, the best bed in the house was reserved for guests. If so, then the bed that Shakespeare bequeathed to Anne could have been their marital bed, and thus not intended to insult her.

However, the will as initially drafted did not mention Anne at all. It was only through a series of additions, made on 25 March 1616, slightly less than a month before Shakespeare died, that the bequest to his wife of his &quot;second best bed with the furniture&quot; was made. Author Stephen Greenblatt in &quot;Will in the World,&quot; suggests that as Shakespeare lay dying, &quot;he tried to forget his wife and then remembered her with the second-best bed. And when he thought of the afterlife, the last thing he wanted was to be mingled with the woman he married. There are four lines carved in [Shakespeare&#x27;s] gravestone in the chancel of Stratford Church: &quot;Good friend for Jesus sake forbeare, To digg the dust encloased heare: Bleste be ye man y&#x27;t spares thes stones, And curst be he y&#x27;t moves my bones.&quot; [Shakespeare may have] feared that his bones would be dug up and thrown in the nearby charnel house ... but he may have feared still more that one day his grave would be opened to let in the body of Anne Shakespeare.&quot;

=== Burial ===

A tradition recorded in 1693 is that Hathaway &quot;greatly desired&quot; to be buried with her husband. In fact she was interred in a separate grave next to him in the Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon. The inscription states, &quot;Here lyeth the body of Anne wife of William Shakespeare who departed this life the 6th day of August 1623 being of the age of 67 years.&quot; A Latin inscription followed which translates as &quot;Breasts, O mother, milk and life thou didst give. Woe is me—for how great a boon shall I give stones? How much rather would I pray that the good angel should move the stone so that, like Christ&#x27;s body, thine image might come forth! But my prayers are unavailing. Come quickly, Christ, that my mother, though shut within this tomb may rise again and reach the stars.&quot; The inscription is believed to have been written by John Hall on behalf of his wife, Anne&#x27;s daughter, Susanna.

==In literature==
===Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets===

One of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets, number 145, has been claimed to make reference to Anne Hathaway: the words &#x27;hate away&#x27; may be a pun (in Elizabethan pronunciation) on &#x27;Hathaway&#x27;. It has also been suggested that the next words, &quot;And saved my life&quot;, would have been indistinguishable in pronunciation from &quot;Anne saved my life&quot;. The sonnet differs from all the others in the length of the lines. Its fairly simple language and syntax have led to suggestions that it was written much earlier than the other, more mature, sonnets.

===Other literature===
The following poem about Anne has also been ascribed to Shakespeare, but its language and style are not typical of his verse. It is widely attributed to Charles Dibdin (1748–1814) and may have been written for the Stratford-upon-Avon Shakespeare Festival of 1769:

===In fiction===
Anne is depicted in fiction during the 19th century, when Shakespeare started to become a figure in wider national and popular culture. Emma Severn&#x27;s novel &quot;Anne Hathaway, or, Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1845) portrays an idealised romance and happy marriage in an idyllic rural Stratford. She also appears in William Black&#x27;s 1884 novel &quot;Judith Shakespeare&quot; about her daughter, portrayed as a conventional dutiful wife and concerned parent with a wayward daughter.

By the early 20th century a more negative image of Hathaway emerged, following the publication of Frank Harris&#x27;s books on Shakespeare&#x27;s love life, and after the discovery that Anne was already pregnant when the couple married. A trend in literature on Hathaway in this period was to imagine her as a sexually incontinent cradle-snatcher, or, alternatively, a calculating shrew. More recent literature has included more varied representations of her. Historian Katherine Scheil describes Hathaway as a &quot;wife-shaped void&quot; used by modern writers &quot;as a canvas for expressing contemporary woman&#x27;s struggles—over independence, single motherhood, sexual freedom, unfaithful husbands, woman&#x27;s education and power-relations between husband and wife.&quot;

An adulterous Anne is imagined by James Joyce&#x27;s character Stephen Dedalus, who makes a number of references to Hathaway. In &quot;Ulysses&quot;, he speculates that the gift of the infamous &quot;second-best bed&quot; was a punishment for her adultery, and earlier in the same novel, Dedalus analyses Shakespeare&#x27;s marriage with a pun: &quot;He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way.&quot; Anne also appears in Hubert Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Shakespeare Play&quot; (c. 1911) and its sequel &quot;The Good Men Do&quot; (1917), which dramatises a meeting between the newly widowed Anne and her supposed old rival for William&#x27;s love &quot;Anne Whateley&quot;. Anne is depicted as shrewish in the first play, and as spiteful towards her former rival in the latter. 
William Gibson&#x27;s play &quot;A Cry of Players&quot; (1968) portrayed the young Shakespeare and Anne and was performed on Broadway (at Lincoln Center) with Frank Langella and Anne Bancroft as the couple. A frosty relationship is also portrayed in Edward Bond&#x27;s play &quot;Bingo: Scenes of Money and Death&quot; (1973), about Shakespeare&#x27;s last days, and in the 1978 TV series &quot;Will Shakespeare&quot;.

&quot;The World&#x27;s Wife&quot;, a collection of poems by Carol Ann Duffy, features a sonnet entitled &quot;Anne Hathaway&quot;, based on the passage from Shakespeare&#x27;s will regarding his &quot;second-best bed&quot;. Duffy chooses the view that this would be their marriage bed, and so a memento of their love, not a slight. Anne remembers their lovemaking as a form of &quot;romance and drama&quot;, unlike the &quot;prose&quot; written on the best bed used by guests, &quot;I hold him in the casket of my widow&#x27;s head/ as he held me upon that next best bed&quot;. In Robert Nye&#x27;s novel &quot;Mrs Shakespeare: the Complete Works&quot;, which purports to be Anne&#x27;s autobiographical reminiscences, Shakespeare buys the best bed with money given to him by the Earl of Southampton. When Anne comes to London, the couple use the bed for wild sexual adventures, in which they engage in role-playing fantasies based on his plays. He refers to the bed he bequeaths her as &quot;the second best&quot; to remind her of the best bed of their memories. The novel was dramatised for BBC radio in 1998 with Maggie Steed playing Hathaway.

The Connie Willis short story &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale,&quot; which combines factual information about Anne Hathaway with a fictitious Shakespeare identity theory, also characterises the nature of the relationship as loving and the bequeath of the second-best bed as romantically significant.

Anne Hathaway appears in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s comic book section &quot;The Tempest&quot;, part of &quot;The Sandman&quot; series. She and Shakespeare share a tumultuous, yet affectionate, relationship. Gaiman&#x27;s interpretation suggests that Anne deliberately became pregnant to force her husband to marry her, but the context implies that neither of them ultimately regret their decision.

Through her long-running solo show &quot;Mrs Shakespeare, Will&#x27;s first and last love&quot; (1989) American actress-writer Yvonne Hudson has had a long relationship with both the historical and dramatic Anne Hathaway. She depicts Anne and Will as maintaining a friendship despite the challenges inherent to their long separations and tragedies. Mining early and recent scholarship and the complete works, Hudson concurs that evidence of the couple&#x27;s mutual respect is indeed evident in the plays and sonnets, along with support for the writer&#x27;s infatuations and possibly adulterous relationships. Hudson also chooses the positive view of the bed bequest, sharing that &quot;it may have been only here that I possessed William.&quot; &quot;Mrs Shakespeare&quot; explores the realities of keeping house without a husband while applying some dramatic licence. This allows Anne to have at least a country wife&#x27;s understanding of her educated spouse&#x27;s work as she quotes sonnets and soliloquies to convey her feelings. The 2005 play &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Will&quot; by Canadian playwright Vern Thiessen is similar in form to Hudson&#x27;s show. It is a one-woman piece that focuses on Anne Hathaway on the day of her husband&#x27;s funeral. Avril Rowland&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Shakespeare&quot; (2005) depicts Anne as a multi-tasking &quot;superwoman&quot; who runs the home efficiently while also writing her husband&#x27;s plays in a businesslike partnership with him as her promoter/performer.
The romantic comedy film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; provides an example of the negative view, depicting the marriage as a cold and loveless bond that Shakespeare must escape to find love in London. The same situation occurs in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s alternate-history novel &quot;Ruled Britannia&quot; (2002), in which Shakespeare seeks and actually wins a divorce from Hathaway to marry his new girlfriend. A similarly loveless relationship is depicted in the film &quot;A Waste of Shame&quot; (2005).

&quot;The Secret Confessions of Anne Shakespeare&quot; (2010), a novel by Arliss Ryan, also proposes Anne Hathaway as the true author of many of the Shakespeare plays (a claim originally made in 1938). In the novel, Anne follows Will to London to support his acting career. As he finds his true calling in writing, Anne&#x27;s own literary skills flower, leading to a secret collaboration that makes William Shakespeare the foremost playwright in Elizabethan England.

She is portrayed by Liza Tarbuck in the BBC Two comedy series &quot;Upstart Crow&quot;, which follows the writing and preparation to stage &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; after William has gained some early career notoriety for his poetry, &quot;Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;.

Anne Hathaway is portrayed by Judi Dench in the 2018 historical film &quot;All Is True&quot;.

Anne is portrayed by actress Cassidy Janson in the musical &quot;&amp; Juliet&quot;. The show opened in the West End on 20 November 2019. The show transferred to Broadway in 2022. It officially opened on 17 November 2022. In the Broadway and Australian production, Anne is portrayed by Betsy Wolfe and Amy Lehpamer, respectively.

Anne Hathaway is a main character in Maggie O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;Hamnet&quot;, centered around Hamnet&#x27;s death. It won the Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction in the same year.

Martha Howe-Douglas portrayed Anne Hathaway in the comedy film &quot;Bill&quot;.

A poetry anthology about Anne Hathaway, titled &quot;Anne-thology&quot;, was released by Broken Sleep Books in 2023, edited by Paul Edmondson, Aaron Kent, Chris Laoutaris, and Katherine Scheil, featuring poetry by poets such as Carol Ann Duffy, U. G. Világos, Roger Pringle, John Agard, and Imtiaz Dharker. &quot;Anne-thology&quot; was chosen as a &quot;Guardian&quot; Book of the Year 2023, and a Daily Telegraph book of the year 2023.

==Anne Hathaway&#x27;s Cottage==

Anne Hathaway&#x27;s childhood was spent in a house near Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, England. Although it is often called a cottage, it is, in fact, a spacious twelve-roomed farmhouse, with several bedrooms, now set in extensive gardens. It was known as Hewlands Farm in Shakespeare&#x27;s day and had more than of land attached to it. As in many houses of the period, it has multiple chimneys to spread the heat evenly throughout the house during winter. The largest chimney was used for cooking. It also has visible timber framing, a trademark of vernacular Tudor style architecture.

After the death of Anne&#x27;s father, the cottage was owned by Anne&#x27;s brother Bartholomew, and was passed down the Hathaway family until 1846, when financial problems forced them to sell it. It is now owned and managed by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, and is open to public visitors as a museum.

<text>No. 4 Squadron, also known as No. IV Squadron, is a squadron of the Royal Air Force. Since November 2011, it has operated the BAE Hawk T2 from RAF Valley, Anglesey, Wales. The squadron provides weapons and tactics training for student pilots after they have completed their conversion to jet aircraft with No. XXV(F) Squadron. Between 1970 and January 2011, the squadron operated various variants of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and British Aerospace Harrier II. 

==History==

===Formation and First World War (1912–1919)===
No. 4 Squadron formed at Farnborough in 1912 as part of the Royal Flying Corps. Operating a mixture of aircraft including early versions of the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 and Breguet biplane, the squadron quickly moved to Netheravon where it remained until the outbreak of the First World War. The more useful aircraft in its inventory were sent to France under the command of Major G. H. Rayleigh on 16 August 1914, to carry out reconnaissance in support of the British Expeditionary Force. On 19 August Lieutenant G. W. Mapplebeck flew the squadron&#x27;s first mission over France, a reconnaissance flight searching for German cavalry in the vicinity of Gembloux, Belgium. Other aircraft remained in England to carry out anti-Zeppelin patrols.

The contingent in France was reinforced on 20 September by the personnel who had remained behind in England, forming C Flight, equipped with the Maurice Farman MF.11 Shorthorn. It concentrated on the reconnaissance role, standardising on the B.E.2 in 1916. In the Battle of the Somme, the squadron flew contact patrols keeping track of the position of advancing troops at low level, in addition to more regular reconnaissance and artillery spotting missions. It re-equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in June 1917, in time to take part in the Battle of Messines and the Battle of Passchendaele. During this period William Robinson Clarke, the first black pilot to serve for Britain, flew for the squadron. It remained equipped with the R.E.8 until the Armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918 ended the fighting. The squadron returned to the United Kingdom in February 1919 as a cadre.

===Between the wars (1920–1939)===
No. 4 Squadron returned to full strength on 30 April 1920 at Farnborough, equipped with Bristol F.2 Fighters. Part of the squadron moved to Aldergrove near Belfast in November 1920 as a result of the Irish War of Independence, moving to Baldonnel Aerodrome near Dublin in May 1921, before rejoining the rest of the squadron at Farnborough in January 1922. The squadron deployed on Royal Navy aircraft carriers when they sailed to Turkey on HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and &quot;Argus&quot; during the Chanak crisis in August 1922, returning to Farnborough in September 1923. When the 1926 General Strike broke out, the squadron&#x27;s aircraft were used to patrol railway lines to deter feared sabotage.

In October 1929, the elderly Bristol Fighters were replaced with new Armstrong Whitworth Atlas, purpose-designed for the squadron&#x27;s army co-operation role. These in turn were replaced by Hawker Audaxes in December 1931. In February 1937, it moved from Farnborough to RAF Odiham, soon re-equipping with the Hawker Hector, a more powerful derivative of the Audax. In January 1939, it discarded its Hector biplanes in favour of the new monoplane Westland Lysander.

===Second World War (1939–1945)===

Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the squadron moved to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force. Following Germany&#x27;s invasion of France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940, the squadron was frequently forced to change bases by the approach of the advancing German armies, being withdrawn to the UK on 24 May. Losses had been heavy, with 18 aircrew killed, while 60% of the groundcrew were lost. It continued in the coastal patrol and air-sea rescue role while training for its main army co-operation role after returning to the UK.

In 1942, the squadron changed its mission from the army co-operation role, where it would operate fairly low-performance aircraft from airstrips close to the front-line, to that of fighter-reconnaissance, receiving the more modern Curtiss Tomahawk and North American Mustang, with the latter soon replacing Tomahawk, flying low-level attack and reconnaissance flights against targets on the continent. 

In August 1943, it joined the Second Tactical Air Force in support of the planned invasion of Europe, changing to the pure reconnaissance mission in January, and replacing its Mustangs with the Mosquito PR.XVI and Spitfire PR.XI. It discarded its Mosquitoes in June, moved to France in August, and briefly supplemented its Spitfires with a few Hawker Typhoons for low-level reconnaissance. It retained its Spitfires at VE Day, moving to Celle in Germany to carry out survey operations in support of the British Army of Occupation until it was disbanded on 31 August 1945.

=== Post-war and Cold War (1946–1999) ===
The squadron reformed the next day by renumbering No. 605 Squadron, a light bomber squadron equipped with Mosquitoes based at Volkel in the Netherlands. It re-equipped with de Havilland Vampire fighter-bombers in July 1950, replacing them with North American Sabres in October 1953. The Sabres were discarded in favour of the Hawker Hunter in July 1955, retaining these until the squadron disbanded at RAF Jever on 31 December 1960.

Again, the squadron did not remain dormant for long, as it reformed on 1 January 1961 by renumbering No. 79 Squadron, flying the Hunter FR.10 in the low-level reconnaissance role. It re-equipped with the Hawker-Siddeley Harrier in 1970, first flying from RAF Wildenrath in West Germany. It moved on to RAF Gütersloh in 1977.The squadron operated the Harrier until the final withdrawal of the type, receiving numerous upgrades and new versions over the years. In April 1999, the squadron left Germany to move to RAF Cottesmore.

=== 21st century (2000–present) ===
On 31 March 2010, the squadron disbanded and reformed as No. 4 (Reserve) Squadron at RAF Wittering, taking over from No. 20 (R) Squadron as the Harrier Operational Conversion Unit. As a result of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the squadron disbanded in January 2011, only to reform on 24 November 2011, when No. 19 (R) Squadron, operating the BAE Hawk T2 from RAF Valley in the tactical weapons training role, was renumbered.

In March 2020, the squadron was awarded the right to emblazon a battle honour on its squadron standard, recognising its role in Bosnia during 1995.

== Heritage ==
Approved by King Edward VIII in May 1936, the squadron&#x27;s badge features a sun in splendour divided per bend by a flash of lightning. The red and black segmented sun suggests round-the-clock operations (day and night), while the lightning flash is a reference to the unit&#x27;s early use of wireless telephony for artillery co-operation.

The squadron&#x27;s motto is .

<doc id="898643" wikidata="Q744425" url="?curid=898643" title="Johnny Thunder">
<text>Johnny Thunder is the name of three superheroes appearing in comics published by DC Comics. A fourth character has the variant name Jonni Thunder.

The character appeared in the second season of &quot;Stargirl&quot; on The CW network played by Ethan Embry.

==Publication history==
Johnny Thunder first appeared in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 (January 1940) and was created by John Wentworth and Stan Aschmeier. In the first few issues, the title of the feature was &quot;Johnny Thunderbolt&quot;. He continued in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; until issue #91 (Jan 1948).

==Fictional character biography==
===Earth-Two version===
John L. Thunder is the seventh son of a seventh son, born at 7 a.m. on Saturday, July 7, the seventh day of the week, the seventh day of the seventh month in 1917. This causes him to be kidnapped by men from Badhnesia who sought to harness his power.

Johnny gained possession of the pink, lightning-haired genie-like Thunderbolt named Yz during a mystic ritual on his 7th birthday, which was intended to allow the Badhnesians to use Johnny to rule the world. However, the plan is soon aborted after an attack from a neighboring country.

Johnny eventually returns to the United States and lives an ordinary life until one day, while washing windows, he inadvertently summons the Thunderbolt with the magic words &quot;Cei-U&quot; (pronounced &quot;say you&quot;). Johnny underwent several adventures, repeatedly summoning Thunderbolt by accident before learning of his existence.

Johnny lived with his parents, dated his on-again, off-again girlfriend Daisy Darling (who had a somewhat less-than-scrupulous businessman father). In 1941, he adopted a little freckle-faced blond orphan girl named Peachy Pet, who, despite her cutesy name and clothing, was a tough little girl who was much smarter than him. Many times during his adventures, which included a stint with the United States Navy, Peachy would instruct her befuddled but beloved &quot;Papa John&quot; on how and when to use Thunderbolt&#x27;s powers.

Johnny&#x27;s appearances with the Justice Society of America and in his own solo adventures tended to be quite comedic, as Johnny&#x27;s main personality trait was being fairly dimwitted, which prompts his much-smarter Thunderbolt to possess a sarcastic (if patient) attitude toward his &quot;boss&quot;, while knowing full well that he could not do anything until his master told him to.

Johnny accidentally joined the Justice Society after wishing that he could be a member and was immediately taken to their meeting by the Thunderbolt. Despite recurring impatience with his stupidity, his fellow JSAers genuinely valued Johnny&#x27;s good-heartedness and dedication and considered him a friend. Furthermore, the Thunderbolt&#x27;s vast power may have contributed to Johnny&#x27;s continued JSA membership, his frequent blunders notwithstanding, since the more competent heroes doubtlessly thought it wise to keep an eye on the pair whenever possible. He finally became a member after the Flash left and the group told him to capture Mister X, which he accidentally succeeded in doing. Like most of the JSA members, he had his aging factor greatly slowed during an encounter with the villain Ian Karkull.

Johnny&#x27;s adventures ceased in the late 1940s when he was replaced in the &quot;Justice Society&quot; stories by a heroine he had begun teaming up with, the Black Canary. The reason for his leaving the Justice Society is eventually explained to be that his control over his Thunderbolt is weakening, thanks to a spell cast by renegade Badhnesian priests. In the early 1950s, Johnny is kidnapped again by agents from Badhnesia, with the intention of executing their original world conquest plan. Johnny manages to summon Superman, and the would-be conquerors&#x27; plans are defeated. Johnny spent some time in Badhnesia afterwards, teaching the native citizens about democracy. He returns home after the country elects its first President. Johnny joins the Justice Society on various adventures.

====&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and Ragnarök====
Following the maxiseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; was the one-shot &quot;Last Days of the Justice Society of America Special&quot; (1986). This book depicted the sacrifice of Johnny and his JSA teammates as they left the &#x27;new&#x27; Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; world and entered into a Limbo dimension. Caused by the actions of Adolf Hitler in April 1945, a wave of destruction appears over Earth even as it is settling down from the Crisis. To stop a literal Ragnarök, the heroes enter into an eternal battle and so leave the world.

===Earth-One version===
Prior to the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; retcon, an alternate version of Johnny Thunder existed on Earth-One. This version was a simple petty criminal with no Thunderbolt. Upon meeting the Earth-Two Thunder (who had traveled to Earth-One out of curiosity), the criminal Johnny Thunder knocked his counterpart out and seized control of the Thunderbolt. He uses it to temporarily reshape Earth-One such that several heroes, such as Superman, Batman, and Green Lantern, retroactively cease to exist. The criminal exploits the fact that the Thunderbolt is &quot;keyed&quot; to simply obey Johnny Thunder, without any distinction made between alternate versions, leaving the Thunderbolt obligated to obey whichever Johnny is conscious despite his own morality. However, the Thunderbolt often tries to work in loopholes to give the heroes an advantage, such as informing the criminal that the Justice Society—who had come to Earth-1 to find out what had happened to their friends in the Justice League——had disappeared, when they had, in fact, disguised themselves as the Justice League to provoke Johnny into revealing what had happened to their version, or making a barrier which keeps out cops, but not superheroes. The Earth-2 Johnny is apparently placed in a coma by the Thunderbolt&#x27;s magic, though this is not shown.

The alternate version of Earth-One that Johnny creates is sometimes referred to as Earth-A (Earth Alternate), which Johnny thinks up himself. Thunder&#x27;s &#x27;Lawless League&#x27; of evil people with powers like the Justice League heroes, which are made up of Johnny&#x27;s fellow criminals who were given the powers of the Justice League members, are defeated by the visiting Justice Society of Earth-Two, who had originally disguised themselves as the JLA, after learning of Johnny&#x27;s disappearance, the Society&#x27;s greater experience allowing them to easily defeat their criminal counterparts. They subsequently face off against Johnny Thunder on the Moon, and the three creatures that the Thunderbolt creates, Medusa-Man (who turns people into wood), Absorbo-Man (who can absorb the powers of others), and Repello-Man (who throws attacks back at their origins). All of the members are defeated, except for Doctor Fate. He creates a golden mask over Medusa-Man&#x27;s face, and sends the wooden Mr. Terrific and Atom at Absorbo-Man, who had absorbed Green Lantern&#x27;s power, meaning he is vulnerable to wood and is destroyed. He uses repello-magic on Repello-Man, which is repelled and destroys him. When the fight comes down to a struggle between Doctor Fate and the Thunderbolt, Johnny Thunder is so battered about by the combatting magic wielders - whose powers fail to do any actual damage to each other - that he finally gives up his attempts to use the Thunderbolt and wishes that none of these events had taken place. The two Earths and their respective heroes are restored, with the Justice League mentioning their world&#x27;s Johnny Thunder as a small-time criminal at their meeting. The Johnny Thunder of Earth-One would return as a threat in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #219-220.

===Johnny&#x27;s return===
The absence of the JSA and of Johnny Thunder did not last long. In 1992 DC published &quot;Armageddon: Inferno&quot;, the miniseries which brought the JSA out of Limbo and into the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; world. This was followed by &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (1992–1993). This series showed how the heroes were adjusting to a &#x27;normal&#x27; life. Johnny is depicted as an overweight man, not as old as his friends, but nostalgic for the past. It is explained that before he had entered into Limbo, he had lent his foster daughter a few thousand dollars and during his time fighting for the universe, she had created &quot;Peachy&#x27;s Frozen Yogurt&quot;, a very successful chain of which Johnny is half owner and now very wealthy. Of greater import to Johnny is his discovery that the Bahdnesians have all but disappeared. A visit to the island of Bahdnesia (now under the ownership of Pol St. Germain) proves that no Bahdnesians are left there. In issue #7, Johnny states: &quot;There were never very many of them...and the island magic had worn out. T-Bolt was all that was left, and he was with me in limbo. They had to leave or starve to death&quot;. This series also introduced the young Kiku, according to the Thunderbolt, the last remaining Bahdnesian.

After this, Johnny is depicted as having dementia. At one point, he loses a pen in which the Thunderbolt is being stored, which Jakeem Thunder later obtains.

===Johnny Thunderbolt===
In a later battle with Solomon Grundy, Johnny is controlled by the Ultra-Humanite and eventually killed, causing Thunderbolt to fuse with him to save his life. This creates a new being with the memories of both, known as Johnny Thunderbolt.

In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Johnny Thunder is temporarily revived as a Black Lantern.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
Johnny Thunder is later revived in the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; initiative, and depicted as living at a retirement home and desperately trying to regain Thunderbolt&#x27;s power. He regains his powers when Doctor Manhattan restores the timeline.

==Variants==
===Jonni Thunder===

Jonni Thunder is the name of a superhero appearing in comics published by DC Comics. She was a rebooted variant of Johnny Thunder and is commonly assisted by a new Thunderbolt.

====Publication history====
Jonni Thunder first appeared in a four-issue miniseries from 1985 named &quot;Jonni Thunder aka Thunderbolt&quot;, written by Roy Thomas. In the first few issues, the title of the feature was &quot;Johnny Thunderbolt&quot;. Jonni existed on Earth-Two before &quot;Crisis&quot; and is briefly seen on the merged Earth created post-&quot;Crisis&quot;.

====Fictional character biography====
Jonni Thunder is a female private detective. A small gold statue gives her the power to turn into a human thunderbolt, while leaving her body behind. Initially described as a stone imbued with the power of Inca deity Apu Illapu, the thunderbolt is later revealed to be a hostile alien. It is eventually defeated and imprisoned, leaving Jonni powerless.

====Other versions====
In the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; continuity, she and Black Lightning have a child who becomes the antihero Lightning, possessing the electricity-based powers of both of her parents. However, in the contemporary DC Universe, Black Lightning&#x27;s daughter Lightning, who recently joined the JSA, is identified as the daughter of Black Lightning and his ex-wife Lynn Stewart.

In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC Comics universe and the history of characters related to the Golden Age of Comics has been drastically altered. A new version of Jonni Thunder is introduced on the parallel world of Earth 2 and appeared in the miniseries &quot;Earth 2: Worlds End&quot;. This version is seemingly possessed by the Thunderbolt which grants her electrical abilities and a multi-armed appearance similar to a Hindu goddess where she is described as a &quot;lass with a powerful friend&quot;. Jonni Thunder was imprisoned at Arkham Base with Brainwave, Karnevil, and Obsidian. She is part of a team of heroes recruited by the mage John Constantine in his attempt to return to his own world of Prime Earth.

====Reception====
Brian Cronin of Comic Book Resources placed her series as part of failed reboots that are way better than the original explaining that &quot;Thomas and Giordano managed to do a well-done comic detective series, which is no small feat&quot;.

===Son of Johnny Thunder (Will Power of &quot;Primal Force&quot;)===
William Twotrees is the illegitimate son of 1940s hero Johnny Thunder and a Jicarilla Apache woman. Afraid of prejudices against mixed marriages, Johnny abandoned his son, something he later regretted deeply. However, it seems as if Johnny&#x27;s partner, the magic Thunderbolt named Yz, left his mark on young William, who developed astonishing Thunderbolt powers of his own later in his life. As Will Power, William joined the supernatural/metahuman team of heroes called the Leymen (a.k.a. Primal Force) until it was disbanded. He was last seen searching for his father, touring with a rock band as a &quot;human light show&quot;.

Twotrees has neither reappeared since the cancellation of the &quot;Primal Force&quot; series, nor has he been referenced in any way in any of the later Justice Society of America titles.

<text>The 2004 NHL entry draft was the 42nd NHL entry draft. It was held on June 26 and 27, 2004 at the RBC Center in Raleigh, North Carolina. It is especially notable because it was the last NHL event to take place before the beginning of the lockout, which canceled all the games scheduled for the 2004–05 NHL season.

As of 2024, the remaining active players in the NHL from this draft are Alexander Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin, and Blake Wheeler.

<text>Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), also known as Heller syndrome and disintegrative psychosis, is a rare condition characterized by late onset of developmental delays—or severe and sudden reversals—in language (receptive and expressive), social engagement, bowel and bladder, play and motor skills. Researchers have not been successful in finding a cause for the disorder. CDD has some similarities to autism and is sometimes considered a low-functioning form of it. In May 2013, CDD, along with other sub-types of PDD (Asperger&#x27;s syndrome, Classic autism, and PDD-NOS), was fused into a single diagnostic term called &quot;autism spectrum disorder&quot; under the new DSM-5 manual.

CDD was originally described by Austrian educator Theodor Heller (1869–1938) in 1908, 35 years before Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger described autism. Heller had previously used the name &quot;dementia infantilis&quot; for the syndrome.

An apparent period of fairly normal development is often noted before a regression in skills or a series of regressions in skills. The age at which this regression can occur varies; after three years of normal development is typical. The regression, known as a prodrome, can be so dramatic that the child may be aware of it, and may in its beginning even ask, vocally, what is happening to them. Some children describe or appear to be reacting to hallucinations, but the most obvious symptom is that skills apparently attained are lost.

Many children are already somewhat delayed when the disorder becomes apparent, but these delays are not always obvious in young children. This has been described by many writers as a devastating condition, affecting both the family and the individual&#x27;s future. As is the case with all pervasive developmental disorder categories, there is considerable controversy about the right treatment for CDD.

==Signs and symptoms==
CDD is a rare condition, with only 1.7 cases per 100,000.

A child affected with childhood disintegrative disorder shows normal development. Up until this point, the child has developed normally in the areas of language skills, social skills, comprehension skills, and has maintained those skills for about two years. However, between the ages of two and 10, skills acquired are lost almost completely in at least two of the following six functional areas:
* Expressive language skills (being able to produce speech and communicate a message)
* Receptive language skills (comprehension of language – listening and understanding what is communicated)
* Social skills and self care skills
* Control over bowel and bladder
* Play skills
* Motor skills

Lack of normal function or impairment also occurs in at least two of the following three areas:
* Social interaction
* Communication
* Repetitive behavior and interest patterns

In her book &quot;Thinking in Pictures,&quot; Temple Grandin argues that compared to &quot;Kanner&#x27;s classic autism&quot; and to Asperger syndrome, CDD is characterized with more severe sensory processing disorder but less severe cognitive problems, despite the fact that most children with CDD regress to severe intellectual disability. She also argues that compared to most autistic individuals, persons with CDD have more severe speech pathology and they usually do not respond well to stimulants.

==Causes==
All of the causes of childhood disintegrative disorder are still unknown. Sometimes CDD surfaces abruptly within days or weeks, while in other cases it develops over a longer period of time. A Mayo Clinic report indicates: &quot;Comprehensive medical and neurological examinations in children diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder seldom uncover an underlying medical or neurological cause. Although the occurrence of epilepsy is higher in children with childhood disintegrative disorder, experts don&#x27;t know whether epilepsy plays a role in causing the disorder.&quot;

CDD, especially in cases of later age of onset, has also been associated with certain other conditions, particularly the following:
* Lipid storage diseases: In this condition, a toxic buildup of excess fats (lipids) takes place in the brain and nervous system.
* Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis: Chronic infection of the brain by a form of the measles virus causes subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. This condition leads to brain inflammation and the death of nerve cells.
* Tuberous sclerosis (TSC): TSC is a genetic disorder. In this disorder, tumors may grow in the brain and other vital organs like kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. In this condition, noncancerous (benign) tumors, hamartomas, grow in the brain.
* Leukodystrophy: In this condition, the myelin sheath does not develop in a normal way, causing white matter in the brain to eventually fail and disintegrate.
* Encephalitis: Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain sometimes caused by viral or bacterial infection, highlighting the importance of childhood vaccinations, especially in people with compromised immune systems.

==Treatment==

Loss of language and skills related to social interaction and self-care are serious. The affected children face ongoing disabilities in certain areas and require long-term care. Treatment of CDD involves both behavior therapy, environmental therapy and medications.

* Behavior therapy: Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is considered to be the most effective form of treatment for autism spectrum disorders by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The primary goal of ABA is to improve quality of life, and independence by teaching adaptive behaviors to children with autism, and to diminish problematic behaviors like running away from home, or self-injury by using positive or negative reinforcement to encourage or discourage behaviors over time.
* Environmental therapy: Sensory enrichment therapy uses enrichment of the sensory experience to improve symptoms in autism, many of which are common to CDD.
* Medications: There are no medications available to directly treat CDD. Antipsychotic medications are used to treat severe behavior problems like aggressive stance and repetitive behavior patterns. Anticonvulsant medications are used to control seizures.

<text>Jakeem Thunder (Jakeem Johnny Williams), initially called J.J. Thunder, is a fictional character in the DC Comics Universe, a member of the superhero team the Justice Society of America.
The character appeared starting in the second season of &quot;Stargirl&quot; on The CW network, portrayed by Alkoya Brunson.

==Publication history==
Jakeem first appeared in &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 2) #134 (February 1998), and was created by Grant Morrison, Mark Millar and Paul Ryan.

==Fictional character biography==
Jakeem Johnny Williams is a precocious teenager from Keystone City—home of Jay Garrick (the original Flash) and Wally West (one of Garrick&#x27;s successors). Jakeem&#x27;s mother left his father while she was still pregnant with the boy and later died of cancer. His aunt Lashawn was then granted custody and his father Phil, never knew (and still does not know) about his birth. Jakeem became a self-reliant latchkey kid who grew up on the streets and adopted a tough, foul-mouthed attitude to survive.

When Johnny Thunder lost control over his &quot;genie&quot; Thunderbolt due to his declining mental health, he put the genie inside an ink pen, which Jay later gave to Jakeem. He discovers the genie&#x27;s powers while helping the Justice League and Justice Society fight the evil blue genie Lkz.

===Justice Society of America===

Jakeem subsequently joins the Justice Society as a part-time member and befriends fellow member Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl.

===Johnny Thunderbolt===
During the battle with Grundy, the Ultra-Humanite takes over Johnny Thunder&#x27;s body to command the Thunderbolt&#x27;s powers. After Johnny is killed, Jakeem&#x27;s genie fuses with him to save his life, creating a new being with the memories of both who is known as Johnny Thunderbolt. With Johnny&#x27;s help, Jakeem meets his biological father Phil, who is now an engineering student.

===Infinite Crisis===

During the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, the Spectre transports Jakeem to the Fifth Dimension, where he is controlled by Qwsp and becomes a mad tyrant before the Justice Society free him.

===Return===
Following the events of &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, Jakeem and the Justice Society are not present in the rebooted &quot;The New 52&quot; timeline, with the Justice League instead taking over as the world&#x27;s first publicly-known superhero team. This is later revealed to be the result of Doctor Manhattan erasing them from history, with Superman eventually convincing him to restore them.

==Powers and abilities==
Jakeem has the ability to summon and control a fifth-dimensional genie in the form of &quot;Johnny Thunderbolt&quot;. The genie can fulfill any wish made by Jakeem, though he occasionally follows Jakeem&#x27;s wishes too literally. The Thunderbolt&#x27;s abilities have become limited due to certain limitations according to the new rules of the &quot;Tenth Age of Magic&quot;.

==In other media==

<text>Jess Collins (August 6, 1923 – January 2, 2004), simply known today as Jess, was an American visual artist.

== Biography ==
Jess was born Burgess Franklin Collins in Long Beach, California. He was drafted into the military and worked on the production of plutonium for the Manhattan Project. After his discharge in 1946, Jess worked at the Hanford Atomic Energy Project in Richland, Washington, and painted in his spare time, but his dismay at the threat of atomic weapons led him to abandon his scientific career and focus on his art.

In 1949, Jess enrolled in the California School of the Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) and, after breaking with his family, began referring to himself simply as &quot;Jess&quot;. In the late 1940s, Jess met Robert Duncan and the painter Lyn Brockway, and became active in numerous exhibitions, poetry gatherings, and creative endeavors through their circle. He met Robert Duncan in 1951 and began a relationship with the poet that lasted for 37 years until Duncan&#x27;s death in 1988. In 1952, in San Francisco, Jess, with Duncan and painter Harry Jacobus, opened the King Ubu Gallery, which became an important venue for alternative art and which remained so when, in 1954, poet Jack Spicer reopened the space as the Six Gallery.

Many of Jess&#x27;s paintings and collages have themes drawn from chemistry, alchemy, the occult, and male beauty, including a series called &quot;Translations&quot; (1959–1976) which is done with heavily laid-on paint in a paint-by-number style. In 1975, the Wadsworth Atheneum displayed six of the &quot;Translations&quot; paintings in their &quot;Matrix 2&quot; exhibition. In the late 1950s, Jess also filled Pauline Kael&#x27;s home on Oregon St in Berkeley, CA, with fantastical and Romantic murals, which still adorn the walls today. Collins also created elaborate collages using old book illustrations and comic strips (particularly, the strip &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, which he used to make his own strip &quot;Tricky Cad&quot;). Jess&#x27;s final work, &quot;Narkissos&quot;, is a complex rendered 6&#x27;x5&#x27; drawing owned by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

A Jess retrospective (&quot;Jess: A Grand Collage, 1951–1993&quot;) toured the United States in 1993 to 1994, accompanied by a book of the same title. The book included pictures of some of the paintings and collages from the tour. Interspersed between the pictures were essays by various contributors including poet Michael Palmer who wrote an extended piece on Jess&#x27;s &quot;Narkissos.&quot;

Sections of Jess&#x27;s paintings &#x27;Arkadia Last Resort&#x27; were used by Faithless in 2004 for the front covers to their single &quot;I Want More&quot;.

In 2008, an exhibition of Jess&#x27;s drawings was held at Gallery Paule Anglim in San Francisco. 

In 2014 and 2015, a traveling exhibit titled &quot;An Opening of the Field: Jess, Robert Duncan, and Their Circle&quot; toured across the country to warm reception. The exhibit explored what it was like for the couple to be &quot;young, gifted, and odd&quot; in San Francisco after World War II. The two men lived and worked for decades from their historic Victorian home in the Mission District, which was lined with more than 5,000 books, 5,300 music records, and countless works of visual art.

<text>Visions of Light (also known as Visions of Light: The Art of Cinematography) is a 1992 documentary film directed by Arnold Glassman, Todd McCarthy and Stuart Samuels. The film covers the art of cinematography since the conception of cinema at the turn of the 20th century. It features numerous filmmakers and cinematographers as interview subjects, presenting their views and discussing the importance of cinematography in the craft of filmmaking.

==Synopsis==
The film includes interviews with many modern-day directors of photography and cinematographers, who illustrate via examples their best work and the scenes from films that influenced them to pursue their art. These subjects include Néstor Almendros, John Bailey, Conrad Hall, Michael Chapman, and László Kovács.

Among the pioneers they pay homage are Gregg Toland, Billy Bitzer, James Wong Howe and John Alton. The practitioners also explain the origins behind many of their most indelible images in cinema history.

<text>Sidney Green (born August 1, 1929) is a retired politician in Manitoba, Canada. He twice ran for the leadership of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba, served in the cabinet of Premier Edward Schreyer, and later formed the Progressive Party of Manitoba.

==Biography==
Green was born into a Jewish family in the mostly working-class North End of Winnipeg, Manitoba. He graduated from the University of Manitoba&#x27;s Law School, and subsequently worked as a labour lawyer. While a student, Green articled with Joseph Zuken, then a Communist school trustee and later an alderman. Despite having some radical tendencies in his early years, Green never became involved with the Communist Party.

On the advice of Stephen Lewis and Lloyd Stinson, Green joined the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) in the early 1960s soon after it was founded. He was the party&#x27;s federal candidate for Winnipeg South in the 1962 election, placing a distant third in a riding that the party acknowledged it would probably not win. Shortly thereafter, Green won election to the municipal council of Winnipeg for a North End ward, defeating Communist candidate William Kardash and John J. Thomas of the pro-business Metro Election Committee. Green was re-elected in 1964.

Green resigned his seat to contest Winnipeg South again federally in 1965. He became the first NDP or Co-operative Commonwealth Federation candidate to receive over 10,000 votes in the riding, but still placed third.

In 1966, Green won election to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the north-end Winnipeg riding of Inkster. Ironically, he had initially lost the party&#x27;s nomination to Howard Mitchell by sixty-one votes to three. Mitchell withdrew before the election, however, and Green took his place. In the general election, Green finished well ahead of his three opponents, including Communist Party leader William Ross.

During this period, Russell Paulley, an old-style labour politician not popular among younger members of his caucus, led the provincial NDP. Along with others in the party, Green believed the NDP needed a new leader to become a serious challenger for government. He supported a plan to have federal Member of Parliament (MP) Edward Schreyer replace Paulley in 1968. That came to nothing, and on September 3, 1968, Green announced he would seek the party&#x27;s leadership himself. Although Green claimed (probably correctly) he was not challenging Paulley on ideological grounds, many interpreted his challenge as being endorsed by the party&#x27;s radical left. Many members of the NDP&#x27;s youth wing endorsed Green&#x27;s campaign for the leadership.

One month later, the remainder of the provincial NDP caucus (aside from Ben Hanuschak, who backed Green) announced they would support Paulley in the leadership challenge, with the understanding he would stand down in favour of Ed Schreyer the following year. With this unusual endorsement, Paulley defeated Green by 213 to 168 votes at a delegated convention.

Green was the first Jewish Canadian politician to make a serious bid for the leadership of a major party. He later claimed his efforts opened the door for future leadership bids by Dave Barrett, who won the British Columbia NDP&#x27;s leadership in 1970, and David Lewis, who was elected leader of the federal party in 1971. Few other prominent Jewish New Democrats in Winnipeg supported his campaign, however. Green later accused Saul Cherniack, Saul Miller, and David Orlikow (the first two of whom were also MLAs, the last the MP for Winnipeg North, in 1968) of promoting &quot;Jewish-fuelled anti-semitism&quot;, claiming that a Jewish lawyer would be unelectable in rural Manitoba. Green&#x27;s relations with Cherniack, Miller, and Orlikow deteriorated during the 1968 campaign, and remained poor thereafter.

Green ran against Ed Schreyer for the party&#x27;s leadership in 1969, in what proved to be a much less divisive campaign. Schreyer won this contest by 506 votes to 177.

Green was easily re-elected in Inkster in 1969, and with the NDP defeating the governing Progressive Conservatives at a provincewide level to form the first social democratic government in Manitoba&#x27;s history, held several portfolios in Schreyer&#x27;s government. He served as Minister of Health and Social Services from July 15, 1969 to December 18, 1969, Minister of Mines and Natural Resources from December 18, 1969 to March 3, 1972 (the position was renamed Minister of Mines, Resources and Environmental Management in 1971) and Minister of Urban Affairs from September 9, 1971 to March 3, 1972.

On March 3, 1972, Green resigned from cabinet over a disagreement with Premier Schreyer on funding to denominational schools: Schreyer supported limited funding and Green opposed any funding. The issue was subsequently resolved, and Green rejoined cabinet on July 21, 1972, returning to the portfolio of Mines, Resources and Environmental Management. He became Minister responsible for the Manitoba Development Corporation on February 16, 1973, and remained in this position for the rest of the Schreyer government&#x27;s lifetime.

During his time in government, Green was involved in the government&#x27;s controversial negotiations over the proposed flooding of South Indian Lake. He also publicly opposed an attempt by Russell Paulley (by then Labour Minister) to impose &quot;back to work legislation&quot; on striking Winnipeg Transit workers in 1976.

After the Schreyer government was defeated in 1977, Green became disillusioned with the direction of the provincial NDP. He said the party was becoming dominated by &quot;the trade union movement and militant feminists&quot;, and opposed its plans to introduce anti-scab legislation if re-elected. Despite his roots as a labour lawyer, Green opposed what he called &quot;special privileges&quot; for unionized labour.

After Schreyer was appointed Governor General of Canada in 1979, Green stood for the party&#x27;s interim leadership, but lost to Howard Pawley in a vote of caucus members. At least five of the seven MLAs who supported Green left the NDP during the 1980s. Green himself left the Manitoba NDP on December 4, 1979, citing the proposed anti-scab legislation as his reason. He sat as an independent MLA until March 3, 1981, when he became one of the founding members of the Progressive Party of Manitoba. The party recognized Green as its leader. MLAs Hanuschak and Bud Boyce were also in the new party.

The Progressive Party was regarded as socialist initially, and supported traditional leftist causes such as full employment and increased profits taxation on resource industries. The party also opposed &quot;special status&quot; designations for minority groups, however, and was arguably closer to the political right in such matters.

The Progressives hoped to run a full slate of candidates in the 1981 election, but were unsuccessful. All the party&#x27;s candidates were defeated. Green, who had been re-elected easily in 1973 and 1977, placed a distant third in Inkster, receiving only 783 votes against 6,283 for Don Scott of the NDP.

Green continued as leader of the Progressive Party. In 1984, he contested a by-election in the south Winnipeg riding of Fort Garry, but finished fourth with 1,035 votes (Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs was also a candidate). He ran in Wolseley, a district in central Winnipeg, in 1986, this time earning 347 votes and again placing fourth.

The Progressive Party gained some notoriety in the 1988 election by convincing former Manitoba premier Douglas Campbell, a veteran of the province&#x27;s original Progressive Party, to speak at a fundraising event. This did not help the party&#x27;s electoral fortunes, however: all its candidates again were defeated, and Green won only 445 votes when he ran in Kildonan.

Green made further unsuccessful bids for the legislature in the 1990 general election in Kildonan, and the 1992 Crescentwood by-election, coming in fourth both times. He was unable to find a successor as party leader in 1995, and dissolved the Progressive Party on July 13 of that year, after having fielded no candidates in the provincial election on April 25.

Green&#x27;s political position shifted rightward in the 1980s. In a 1990 advertisement, the Progressive Party argued in support of balanced budgets and rejected any state sanctioning of &quot;distinct status&quot; for minority groups such as aboriginals and homosexuals. In addition to leading the Progressive Party, Green also continued his law practice throughout the 1980s. He published his memoir, &quot;Rise and Fall of a Political Animal&quot;, in 2003.

In May 2013, Green wrote an opinion piece advocating the abolition of the Senate of Canada.

<text>John Thomas Walton (October 8, 1946 – June 27, 2005) was an American war veteran and a son of Walmart founder Sam Walton. He was also the chairman of True North Venture Partners, a venture capital firm. Walton cofounded the Children&#x27;s Scholarship Fund, providing tuition scholarships for disadvantaged youth.

==Early life and service in the Vietnam War==
Walton was born in Newport, Arkansas. He graduated from Bentonville High School where he was a star football player. Walton went on to attend the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio. He dropped out of college in 1968 to spend more time playing the flute and enlisted in the U.S. Army (after the Vietnamese Tet Offensive).

During the Vietnam war, Walton served in the Green Berets as part of the Studies and Observations Group. He was involved in combat in the A Shau Valley and in Laos. During his time in Vietnam, he served in Spike Team Louisiana, of MACV-SOG, and presided as the 1-1 (Assistant team leader.) of his Spike team. &quot;. Walton later received a Silver Star for bravery in combat.

==Later life==
After returning from Vietnam, Walton learned to fly and went to work as a pilot for Walmart. He later left the company to fly crop-dusters over cotton fields in several southern states and co-founded Satloc, an aerial application company that pioneered the use of GPS technology in agricultural crop-dusting. Walton then moved to San Diego where he founded Corsair Marine, a company that built trimaran sailboats. He also lived in Durango, Colorado, and was an enthusiastic skier, mountain biker, hiker, motorcycle rider, skydiver and scuba diver.

In 1998, as part of the Philanthropy Roundtable, Walton and friend Ted Forstmann established the Children&#x27;s Scholarship Fund to provide tuition assistance for low-income families to send their children to private schools. He was an advocate of school vouchers. For his achievements, he received the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.

==Death==
Walton died on June 27, 2005, when the CGS Hawk Arrow home-built ultralight aircraft (registered as an &quot;experimental aircraft&quot; under FAA regulations) that he was piloting crashed in Jackson, Wyoming. Walton&#x27;s plane crashed at 12:20 p.m. local time (18:20 UTC) shortly after taking off from Jackson Hole Airport.

The National Transportation Safety Board later reported that Walton had improperly reinstalled the rear locking collar on the elevator control torque tube. This allowed the torque tube to move rearward during his flight and loosened the elevator control cable tension. The outcome of the failed repair was an inflight loss of pitch control, without which Walton could not control the aircraft&#x27;s altitude.

Shortly before his death, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine had estimated Walton&#x27;s net worth to be billion, tied with his brother Jim as the 4th richest person in the United States and 11th-richest person in the world.

Walton was survived by his wife Christy and their son Lukas. He was previously married to Mary Ann Gunn, who later became a judge in Arkansas. He had two brothers, S. Robson Walton and Jim Walton and a sister, Alice Walton.

<text>Peter Fechter (14 January 1944 – 17 August 1962) was a German bricklayer who became the twenty-seventh known person to die at the Berlin Wall. Fechter was 18 years old when he was shot and killed by East German border guards while trying to cross over to West Berlin.

==Biography==
Peter Fechter was born on 14 January 1944, in Berlin, Germany, during the final years of World War II. Fechter was the third of four children, and raised in the Weißensee district of Berlin. His father was a mechanical engineer and his mother was a saleswoman. Fechter finished school at the age of 14, and graduated as a bricklayer. After World War II had ended, Weißensee was located in the Soviet occupation zone of Berlin when the city was divided during the Allied Occupation, with the Soviet Sector later becoming East Berlin in East Germany. Fechter&#x27;s eldest sister had married and now lived in West Berlin, where she was regularly visited by her parents and siblings. On 13 August 1961, the East German authorities abruptly closed the border and began construction of the Berlin Wall, effectively separating Fechter and his family from his sister in West Berlin. Fechter&#x27;s colleague, Helmut Kulbeik, later stated that he and Fechter had been contemplating defecting to West Berlin for a while, and that they had also explored the border installations, but no concrete planning was ever made at the time. Shortly after, Fechter was denied a legally sanctioned trip to West Germany by his company, despite receiving good judgement.

==Death==
On 17 August 1962, around one year after the construction of the Berlin Wall, Fechter and Helmut Kulbeik attempted to flee from East Germany. The plan was to hide in a carpenter&#x27;s workshop near the wall on Zimmerstrasse and, after observing the border guards from there, to jump out of a window into the &quot;death-strip&quot; (a strip running between the main wall and a parallel fence which they had recently started to construct), run across it, and climb over the two-metre (6.5 ft) wall topped with barbed wire into the Kreuzberg district of West Berlin near Checkpoint Charlie.

Their plan was initially successful as both Fechter and Kulbeik reached the final wall, but as they began to climb the East German border guards fired at them. Although Kulbeik succeeded in crossing over the wall, Fechter was shot in the pelvis while still climbing, in plain view of hundreds of witnesses. He fell back into the death-strip on the East German side, where he remained in view of West German onlookers, including journalists. Despite his screams, Fechter received no medical assistance from the East German side, and could not be tended to by those on the West side. West Berlin police threw him bandages, which he could not reach, and he bled to death after approximately one hour. As a result of his death, hundreds in West Berlin formed a spontaneous demonstration, shouting &quot;Murderers!&quot; at the border guards. The lack of medical assistance for Peter Fechter was attributed to mutual fear: Western bystanders were apparently prevented at gunpoint from assisting him, although according to a report in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, a second lieutenant of the US Army on the scene received specific orders from the US Commandant in West Berlin to stand firm and do nothing. It also emerged during the trial that any aid attempt from the West had indeed been made impossible, but according to a report from forensic pathologist Otto Prokop, &quot;Fechter had no chance of survival. The shot in the right hip had caused severe internal injuries.&quot;

==Trial==
In March 1997, seven years after the reunification of Germany and 35 years after Fechter&#x27;s death, two former East German guards, Rolf Friedrich and Erich Schreiber, faced manslaughter charges for Fechter&#x27;s death. Both admitted to the shooting after an intense investigation. They were both convicted and sentenced to 20 and 21 months&#x27; imprisonment on probation. Due to a lack of conclusive evidence, the court was unable to determine which of three gunmen (one of whom had already died) had fired the fatal bullet. After pleading guilty to the crime, during sentencing, both guards apologized for killing Fechter, saying that if they could take it back, they would, and that they were honestly remorseful for their actions.

==Commemoration==

A cross was placed on the western side near the spot where Fechter was shot and bled to death. At the invitation of Willy Brandt, the mayor of West Berlin, the Yale Russian Chorus sang a German translation of Mozart&#x27;s Ave Verum Corpus near the site in the week following the shooting. On the first anniversary, a wreath was placed there by Willy Brandt and US major general James Polk.

The story of Peter Fechter was the headline of American news magazine &quot;Time&quot; in August 1962. In this article was used the noun &quot;Wall of Shame&quot; (Mauer der Schande), and this became a synonym for the wall.
After German reunification in 1990, the Peter-Fechter-Stelle memorial was constructed on Zimmerstraße, at the precise spot where he had died on the Eastern side, and this has been a focal point for some of the commemorations regarding the wall. The shooting has also been the subject of documentaries on German television. Cornelius Ryan dedicated his book &quot;The Last Battle&quot; to the memory of Fechter. Composer Aulis Sallinen wrote an orchestral work &quot;Mauermusik&quot; to commemorate Fechter. In 2007, artist Mark Gubb was commissioned by the Institute of Contemporary Arts to create a performance based on the death of Peter Fechter. The performance was a one-hour live piece that was later recorded and screened at the ICA with a discussion panel at the end consisting of the artist, and actor Dominik Danielewicz who played the part of Peter Fechter. The 1972 ballad &quot;Libre&quot; (&quot;Free&quot;) – a recording famous in all Ibero-America – by Spanish singer Nino Bravo, remembers this event. In 2012 Canadian playwright Jordan Tannahill&#x27;s play &quot;Peter Fechter: 59 Minutes&quot;, a poetic re-imagining of the final hour of Fechter&#x27;s life, was produced in Canada and Berlin.

<text>The Groom Porter was an office at the royal court of the monarch of Britain, who had &quot;the Inspection of the King&#x27;s Lodgings, and takes care that they are provided with Tables, Chairs, Firing, &amp;c. As also to provide Cards, Dice, &amp;c. when there is playing at Court: To decide Disputes which arise in Gaming&quot;. He was also responsible for &quot;oversight of common Billiards Tables, common Bowling Grounds, Dicing Houses, Gaming Houses and Common tennis Courts and power of Licensing the same within the Citys of London and Westminster or Borough of Southwark.&quot;

The title may originally have referred to the keeper of the king&#x27;s furnishings in his bedchamber. It was a position in the royal household, and therefore had certain privileges associated with it. A somewhat extended account of the Office is given in King James I&#x27;s grant of it to Clement Cotterell in 1620. In 1702 the remuneration was raised to £680 per year, which it remained until it was abolished with other sinecure offices at court in 1782. Eventually, the term became used for the owner, or operator of a gaming hall.

<doc id="898681" wikidata="Q1269315" url="?curid=898681" title="EuroGames">
<text>The EuroGames are an LGBT+ multi-sport event in Europe, licensed by the EGLSF (European Gay and Lesbian Sport Federation) to a local city host each year and organised (most often) by one or more of the federation&#x27;s member clubs. Similar to the Gay Games, EuroGames are a sports-for-all event, open for participation irrespective of sex, age, sexual identity or physical ability. Additionally it often included less prominent non-olympic sports and disciplines catering to interest of LGBT+ communities like same-sex ballroom dance, line dance, cheerleading, aerobics, bodybuilding as well synchronised/artistic swimming with male participants, which was historically forbidden.

In terms of scale EuroGames range from 1,5 to cca 4 thousand (or exceptionally more) participants primarily from the West and South of Europe but also elsewhere (often Asian and American diasporic communities), most often with extra outreach support subsidies for less privileged participants. The EuroGames is most often an extended weekend event with opening and closing ceremonies, some of the sport, social, policy and cultural activities also happening on the days before. 

==History==
The official name of the EuroGames is the European Gay and Lesbian Multi-Sports Championships. It is a Dutch initiative inspired by GayGames, first organized in The Hague in 1992.

The EuroGames are a multi-day sporting event. They are organized annually in a European city, except in years when the global Gay Games take place. Since the advent of the World Outgames in 2006, this has been taken into account in determining whether or not a city is assigned to a particular year. In a year in which Gay Games and/or World Outgames take place, EuroGames generally do not take place.

Like the Gay Games as well as the World Outgames, the EuroGames are open to everyone regardless of gender, age, race, religion, sexual orientation or disability. When a competitive sport has not yet reached the maximum number of participants, participants from non-European countries are also admitted.

Since 2001, the EuroGames have existed in two versions: the big EuroGames and the small EuroGames. It was planned that these small Games would have a maximum of 1,500 participants and seven sports and would last two days. The &quot;small&quot; EuroGames Utrecht 2005 were an exception to this. Almost 3,000 participants, nine competition sports and three competition days made Utrecht, as the smallest organizing city until then, have the largest &#x27;small&#x27; Games compared to Hannover and Copenhagen in 2001 and 2003 respectively.

<text>Ben Hanuschak (born April 29, 1930) is a Canadian politician from the province of Manitoba. He was a cabinet minister in the government of New Democratic Premier Edward Schreyer, and was subsequently a founding member of the Progressive Party of Manitoba.

Hanuschak was born in Earl Grey, Saskatchewan. He was educated at the University of Manitoba, and worked as a teacher.

Hanuschak was elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1966, defeating Liberal incumbent Mark Smerchanski in the north Winnipeg riding of Burrows. Along with others in the party, he believed that leader Russell Paulley needed to be replaced before the next election. In 1968, he was the only member of the party&#x27;s parliamentary caucus to support Sidney Green&#x27;s leadership bid.

Edward Schreyer became provincial NDP leader in 1969, and won the subsequent election for the party. Hanuschak was chosen Speaker of the House on August 14, 1969, and kept this position until August 20, 1970.

Hanuschak joined Schreyer&#x27;s cabinet on August 20, 1970. He initially served as Minister of Consumer and Corporate and Internal Services (August 20, 1970 – December 1, 1971), and later became Minister of Education (September 9, 1971 – September 22, 1976), Minister of Colleges and Universities (September 15, 1973 – September 22, 1976), Minister of Urban Affairs (February 15, 1973 – August 29, 1973) and Minister of Continuing Education and Manpower and Minister of Tourism, Recreation and Cultural Affairs from September 22, 1976 to October 24, 1977. He left cabinet when the Schreyer government was defeated in 1977.

Like Sidney Green, Hanuschak became disillusioned with the directions taken by the provincial NDP after 1977. On March 3, 1981, he joined with Green and one other MLA to create the Progressive Party of Manitoba. Although initially socialist, this party also incorporated elements of the radical (but not extreme) right. It opposed the NDP&#x27;s proposed anti-scab legislation, for instance, and was against &quot;distinct status&quot; recognition for minority groups.

The Progressive Party did not elect any members in the 1981 election. Hanuschak, who had been re-elected without difficulty in 1969, 1973 and 1977, received only 728 votes, against 4890 for Conrad Santos of the NDP. He ran for the Progressive Party on two further occasions, but fared no better.

Hanuschak returned to political life in 1986 as a school trustee in the Seven Oaks division. As of 2004, serves in this position.

<text>Magnus Felix Ennodius (473 or 47417 July 521 AD) was Bishop of Pavia in 514, and a Latin rhetorician and poet.

He was one of four Gallo-Roman aristocrats of the fifth to sixth-century whose letters survive in quantity: the others are Sidonius Apollinaris, prefect of Rome in 468 and bishop of Clermont (died 485), Ruricius, bishop of Limoges (died 507) and Alcimus Ecdicius Avitus, bishop of Vienne (died 518). All of them were linked in the tightly bound aristocratic Gallo-Roman network that provided the bishops of Catholic Gaul. He is regarded as a saint, with a feast day of 17 July.

== Life ==
Ennodius was born at Arelate (Arles) and belonged to a distinguished but impecunious family. As Mommaerts and Kelley observe, &quot;Ennodius claimed in his letters to them to be related to a large number of individuals. Unfortunately, he seldom specified the nature of the relationship.&quot; Because his sister Euprepia (born 465 or 470) is known to have had a son named Flavius Licerius Firminus Lupicinus, who was named for his grandfather, Vogel argued that Ennodius&#x27; father was named Firminus. Jacques Sirmond suggested that Ennodius was the son of one Camillus of Arles, whose father was a proconsular and the brother of Magnus, the consul of 460; but Mommaerts and Kelley dismiss Sirmond&#x27;s identification as untenable.

Having lost his parents at an early age, Ennodius was brought up by an aunt at Ticinum (Pavia); according to some, at Mediolanum (Milan). After her death he was received into the family of a pious and wealthy young lady, to whom he was betrothed. It is not certain whether he actually married this lady; she seems to have lost her money and retired to a convent, whereupon Ennodius entered the Church, and was ordained deacon (about 493) by Epiphanius, bishop of Pavia.

From Pavia he went to Milan, which Ennodius made his home until his elevation to the see of Pavia about 515. During his stay at Milan he visited Rome and other places, where he gained a reputation as a teacher of rhetoric. As bishop of Pavia he played a considerable part in ecclesiastical affairs. On two occasions (in 515 and 517) he was sent to Constantinople on an embassy to the emperor Anastasius, to endeavour to bring about a reconciliation over the Acacian schism that divided the Eastern and Western churches. Ennodius&#x27; epitaph still exists in the basilica of San Michele Maggiore, Pavia.

== Writings ==
Ennodius is one of the best representatives of the two-fold (pagan and Christian) tendency of 5th century literature, and of the Gallo-Roman clergy who upheld the cause of civilization and classical literature against the inroads of barbarism. But his anxiety not to fall behind his classical models—the chief of whom was Virgil—his striving after elegance and grammatical correctness, and a desire to avoid the commonplace have produced a turgid and affected style, which, aggravated by rhetorical exaggerations and popular barbarisms, makes his works difficult to understand. It has been remarked that his poetry is less unintelligible than his prose.

The numerous writings of this ecclesiastic may be grouped into four types: letters, miscellanies, discourses, and poems. His letters on a variety of subjects, addressed to high church and state officials, are valuable for the religious and political history of the period. Of the miscellanies, the most important are:
*The &quot;Panegyric of Theodoric&quot;, written to thank the Arian king for his tolerance of Catholicism and support of Pope Symmachus (probably delivered before the king on the occasion of his entry into Ravenna or Milan); like all similar works, it is full of flattery and exaggeration, but if used with caution is a valuable authority.
*The &quot;Life of St Epiphanius, bishop of Pavia&quot;, the best written and perhaps the most important of all his writings, an interesting picture of the political activity and influence of the church
*&quot;Eucharisticon de Vita Sua&quot;, a sort of confessions, after the manner of Augustine of Hippo
*the description of the enfranchisement of a slave with religious formalities in the presence of a bishop
*&quot;Paraenesis didascalica&quot;, an educational guide, in which the claims of grammar as a preparation for the study of rhetoric, the mother of all the sciences, are strongly insisted on.
The discourses (&quot;Dictiones&quot;) are on sacred, scholastic, controversial and ethical subjects. The discourse on the anniversary of Laurentius, bishop of Milan, is the chief authority for the life of that prelate; the scholastic discourses, rhetorical exercises for the schools, contain eulogies of classical learning, distinguished professors and pupils; the controversial deal with imaginary charges, the subjects being chiefly borrowed from the &quot;Controversiae&quot; of Seneca the Elder; the ethical harangues are put into the mouth of mythological personages (e.g. the speech of Thetis over the body of Achilles).

His poems include:
* two &quot;Itineraria&quot;, descriptions of a journey from Milan to Brigantium (Briançon) and of a trip on the Po River
* a defense of the study of secular literature
* an &quot;epithalamium,&quot; in which Love is introduced as execrating Christianity
* a dozen hymns, after the manner of Ambrose, probably intended for church use
* epigrams on various subjects, some being epigrams proper (inscriptions for tombs, basilicas, baptisteries) and others imitations of Martial, satiric pieces and descriptions of scenery.

==Critical editions==
The &quot;editio princeps&quot; of Ennodius was published by Johann Jakob Grynaeus in 1569 at Basel. Sirmond edited his works in 1611, organizing the individual works into the four groupings described above; this presentation remained &quot;the classic text&quot; until Guilelmus Hartel (vol. vi. of &quot;Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum&quot;, Vienna, 1882). However, it was not until 1885 that Friedrich Vogel prepared an edition for the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot; (&quot;Auctores Antiquissimi&quot;, vol. vii), that the individual works were once again presented in the miscellaneous order of the manuscripts. Vogel did so seeing traces of a chronological sequence in that order, which Sr. Genevieve Cook notes led to &quot;a series of studies on the chronology of the works of Ennodius&quot;.

A modern edition of Ennodius&#x27; correspondence is under way: Stéphane Gioanni, &quot;Ennode de Pavie, Lettres&quot;, tome I: Livres I et II, Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 2006, based on his 2004 Ph.D. thesis. See a first review (Joop van Waarden) and Stéphane Gioanni, &quot;Ennode de Pavie, Lettres&quot;, tome II, livres III et IV, Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 2010.

<text>The interrex (plural interreges) was an extraordinary magistrate during the Roman Kingdom and Republic. Initially, the interrex was appointed after the death of the king of Rome until the election of his successor, hence its name—a ruler &quot;between kings&quot; (). The position was retained during the Republic when both consuls were unable to assume their duties, especially holding elections. Interreges ruled for only five days, which often led several of them to be appointed in succession, the record being 15 interreges in 326 BC. They were exclusively chosen from among patrician senators, and during the Conflict of the Orders, their appointment was sometimes designed to hinder plebeians from reaching power or passing laws.

As with the dictatorship, interreges are mostly found until the time of the Second Punic War. The position was only resurrected by Sulla in 82 BC so he could become dictator, and between 55 and 52 BC, when Pompey disturbed the constitution for his own benefit.

==History==
The office of &quot;interrex&quot; was supposedly created following the death of Rome&#x27;s first king Romulus, and thus its origin is obscured by legend. The Senate of the Roman Kingdom was at first unable to choose a new king. For the purpose of continuing the government of the city, the Senate, which then consisted of one hundred members, was divided into ten &quot;decuriae&quot; (groups of ten); and from each of these &quot;decuriae&quot; one senator was nominated as &quot;decurio&quot;. Each of the ten &quot;decuriones&quot; in succession held the regal power and its badges for five days as &quot;interrex&quot;; and if no king had been appointed at the expiration of fifty days, the rotation began anew. The period during which they exercised their power was called an interregnum, and on that occasion lasted for one year. Thereafter Numa Pompilius was elected as the new king.

After the death of each subsequent king, an &quot;interrex&quot; was appointed by the Senate. His function was to call a meeting of the &quot;Comitia Curiata&quot;, which would elect a new king.

Under the Republic, &quot;interreges&quot; were appointed to hold the &quot;comitia&quot; for the election of the consuls when the consuls, through civil commotion or other cause such as death, had been unable to do so during their year of office. Each &quot;interrex&quot; held the office for only five days, as under the kings. During the brief &quot;interregnum&quot;, they cumulated most of the original power of the king, or the power of the two consuls in the first years of the Republic. The &quot;comitia&quot; were, as a general rule, not held by the first &quot;interrex&quot;, who was originally the &quot;curio maximus&quot;, but more usually by the second or third; in one instance we read of an eleventh, and in another of a fourteenth &quot;interrex&quot;. The &quot;comitia&quot; to elect the first consuls were held by Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus either as &quot;interrex&quot; or as &quot;praefectus urbi.&quot; The &quot;interreges&quot; under the Republic, at least from 482 BC, were elected from ex-consuls by the Senate, and were not confined to the &quot;decem primi&quot; or ten chief senators as under the kings. Plebeians, however, were not admissible to this office; and consequently when the Senate included plebeians, the patrician senators met together without the plebeian members to elect an &quot;interrex&quot;. For this reason, as well as on account of the influence which the &quot;interrex&quot; exerted in the election of the magistrates, we find that the tribunes of the plebs were strongly opposed to the appointment of an &quot;interrex&quot;. The interrex had &quot;jurisdictio&quot;. It is possible that &quot;interreges&quot; were the only magistrates exempted from the veto power of a tribune - which would be exceptional, since even dictators were usually subject to the veto.

&quot;Interreges&quot; continued to be appointed occasionally until the time of the Second Punic War. After that no &quot;interrex&quot; was appointed until the Senate, by command of Sulla, named L. Valerius Flaccus to hold the &quot;comitia&quot; for his election as Dictator in 82 BC. In 55 BC, another &quot;interrex&quot; was appointed to hold the &quot;comitia&quot; in which Pompey and Crassus were elected consuls. There were multiple &quot;interreges&quot; in 53 and 52 BC, the last known being Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir); in 52 an &quot;interrex&quot; held the &quot;comitia&quot; in which Pompey was appointed sole consul. The number of &quot;interreges&quot; during these two years was so high that Cicero ironised about it in a letter.

<doc id="898699" wikidata="Q1548898" url="?curid=898699" title="Metro Toronto Convention Centre">
<text>Metro Toronto Convention Centre (originally and still colloquially Metro Convention Centre, and sometimes MTCC), is a convention complex located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada along Front Street West in the former Railway Lands in downtown Toronto. The property is today owned by Oxford Properties. The centre is operated by the Metropolitan Toronto Convention Centre Corporation, an independent agency of the Government of Ontario.

==Description==
The MTCC has of space, and is home to the 1232-seat John Bassett Theatre. To the east end of the complex is the 586-room InterContinental Toronto Centre hotel (formerly Canadian National Railway&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Hotel CN&quot;). At the west end of the complex is a 265,000 square foot Class-B office building. Within the office building is the Pint restaurant, which was formerly a Baton Rouge from 2006 to 2017 and a Planet Hollywood from 1996 to 2006. A south building containing exhibition space is located on Bremner Boulevard, south of the rail lines.

The centre is connected to the Union Station railway and transit station through the SkyWalk, and the centre is also accessible via the underground Path system. The centre is also connected by the Skywalk system to the nearby Rogers Centre and large conventions or exhibitions will sometimes also use it as an additional venue. The Skywalk also connects the convention centre to the CN Tower and Ripley&#x27;s Aquarium of Canada.

According to a 2018 report, over the past 34 years, the MTCC has hosted over 20,000 events and has added in direct spending economic impact to the community. Direct spending economic impact is created when conference, trade and public show attendees spend on dining, hotel nights, shopping, transportation and more in Toronto. Based on the Ontario Tourism Regional Economic Impact Model (TREIM), the MTCC also sustained a record-breaking 7,622 jobs in the community in its 2017/18 fiscal year.

==History==
The site was formerly federally owned Railway Lands. Prior to the early 1980s, the site was home to tail end tracks and a parking lot. During the 1970s, the site was part of the proposed and failed &quot;Metro Centre&quot; development which sought to convert the large rail lands in one large development. Development instead proceeded in parcel-by-parcel fashion, with developments such as Roy Thomson Hall, the CN Tower, the SkyDome stadium (renamed Rogers Centre in 2005) and Ripley&#x27;s Aquarium of Canada. The rail yards were transferred to new locations north and east of Toronto. The main rail lines south of the centre were retained.

The convention centre and hotel was completed in 1984, built by CN Real Estate designed by Architects Crang and Boake. In 1995, ownership was transferred to Canada Lands Corporation, an agency of the Government of Canada. A new largely underground addition, designed by Bregman + Hamann Architects, was added south of the railways, east of the CN Tower in 1997 to expand convention space. In April 2011, the Canada Lands Corporation announced that the centre and hotel was for sale. OMERS-owned Oxford Properties won the rights to the complex in August 2011. The purchase of the North Building, the hotel, the 277 Front Street West office building and a 1,200 stall parking facility was completed in September 2011 for . The complex was adjacent to other Oxford-owned properties at 315 and 325 Front Street.

In October 2012, Oxford Properties proposed the re-development of the site with an updated convention centre, casino, hotel and retail complex. The current MTCC complex would be demolished and replaced with a new complex.

In January 2021, a site at the convention centre opened as a large-scale clinic for distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto.

==Events==
The centre has hosted many large-scale events over the years. The G-20 summit was held at the centre on June 26 and June 27, 2010. It was the same venue for the 14th G7 summit held in 1988. The 1985 NHL Entry Draft was held at the centre. It has also hosted the XVI International AIDS Conference in 2006. As well, it has played host to Toronto auditions for &quot;So You Think You Can Dance Canada&quot; and &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;. It has also been the site of numerous political conventions, and was the annual home of the NHL Awards. Fan Expo &amp; Enthusiast Gaming Live Expo (EGLX) is held here, as well as the Canadian International Auto Show. The 2016 Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference was held here as well.

In 2011, on the occasion of Art Toronto the artist Achim Zeman presented an installation at the entrance-hall of the building called &quot;Str@del&quot;: Eight columns, walls, the ceiling and the reception were covered in red and matte white fluorescent foils. The stripes, wide and narrow surrounded the architectural space, and because of their arrangement left the impression on the viewer as if he was experiencing countless whirlpools, which swirled around him.

<text>The  (German for &#x27;heavy armoured reconnaissance vehicle&#x27;), is a series of six- and eight-wheeled armoured cars that were used by Germany during the Second World War.

In the German Army, armoured cars were intended for the traditional cavalry missions of reconnaissance and screening. They scouted ahead and to the flank of advancing mechanized units to assess enemy location, strength and intention. Their primary role was reconnaissance, but they would engage similar or light units and at times attempt to capture enemy patrols.

==History==
The heavy was a large but fast addition to the German Army. The original (six wheel) versions were based on a 6x4 truck with an armoured body, but by 1937 they were being replaced by versions. During the replacement phase, the Sd.Kfz. (&quot;Sonderkraftfahrzeug&quot;, &#x27;special vehicle&#x27;) numbers were carried directly over; differentiation was made by the inclusion of 6-Rad or 8-Rad in the vehicle&#x27;s name.

These vehicles were used throughout the war in various guises and first saw combat in the campaign against Poland and in the Battle of France. Later, they saw use in both the USSR and North Africa campaigns. Extreme climatic conditions in both these areas proved too severe for the vehicle. In the USSR, adverse ground conditions immobilized 150 Sd.Kfz 232s during the first wet season of the campaign. The speed of the eight-wheeled cars made them the best scouting vehicles that Rommel had for long-range reconnaissance across the wide desert territory.

==Armour==
The Sd.Kfz. 232 had of slightly sloped homogeneous steel armour on the front, on the sides, and on the back, with and of armour on the top and bottom respectively. This armour was designed to provide protection from small arms fire and HE fragments; it was ineffective against heavier weapons. After the French campaign, additional spaced frontal armour plate was added to provide better protection. Armour was increased up to in the later Sd.Kfz. 234 series. However, it was not designed to provide protection from anti-tank weapons.

==Armament==
The Sd.Kfz. 232 was armed with a 20 mm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon. This cannon was based on the 20 mm FlaK 30 anti-aircraft gun, and was capable of firing at a cyclic rate of 280 rounds per minute.

The cannon was not designed to defeat enemy tanks; experiments were made towards replacing it with a heavier gun, which resulted in the Sd.Kfz. 234/2. The Sd.Kfz. 234/2&#x27;s gun could penetrate and knock out Allied armoured cars and light tanks, but this was not the vehicle&#x27;s role. The role intended was for the car&#x27;s armour to protect the crew from small arms fire during reconnaissance missions.

Using high explosive ammunition, the autocannon was highly effective against infantry and unarmoured vehicles. Great success was also achieved by replacing the regular armour-piercing explosive ammunition with Armour Piercing Composite Rigid rounds, but this ammunition was in chronically short supply.

== Propulsion ==
Production versions of the Sd.Kfz. 232 were fitted with a , eight-cylinder Büssing-NAG L8V-G petrol engine, which gave a top speed of and a range of .

==Crew==
A crew of four was typical. The commander and gunner sat in the turret. The Sd.Kfz. 232 employed a dual driver arrangement, with one driver seated at each end of the vehicle. This allowed the vehicle to be driven in either direction (forward or backward) with ease.
== Six wheelers ==
All 6-rad versions were produced from 1932 to 1937.

===Sd.Kfz. 231===

The first of the German armoured cars, the Sd.Kfz. 231, was based on a modified Daimler-Benz, Büssing or Magirus 6x4 truck chassis. The 231 was armed with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon, and a &quot;Maschinengewehr&quot; 13 machine gun. The 231 was introduced into service in 1932 and began to be replaced in 1937 when the German Army switched production to 8-wheeled armoured cars instead of 6-wheeled. Despite being replaced, they were used by (&#x27;reconnaissance&#x27;) units during the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France, and the invasion of the USSR. They were withdrawn afterwards for use in internal security and training. The crew consisted of a commander, gunner, driver, and a radio operator/rear driver.

===Sd.Kfz. 232===

The 232 carried a Fu.Ger.11 SE 100 medium-range and a Fu.Spr.Ger.A short-range radio. This model was very distinctive because of the heavy &quot;bedspring&quot; antenna over most of the hull. This antenna was supported by two insulated vertical connecting tubes at the back corners and an inverted U-shape tube construction on the turret sides with a central joint that allowed the turret its full 360° traverse.

=== Sd.Kfz. 263 ===
This was a radio vehicle, , equipped with extra long-range radio equipment and an additional radio operator. To support the additional equipment, the turret was omitted, the superstructure was raised and only a single ball-mounted machine gun was mounted.

== Eight wheelers ==


===Sd. Kfz. 231 family===
As the cross-country performance of the 6-wheeled armoured cars was deemed insufficient, the Heer Ordnance department (WaPrw 6) signed a contract with Büssing to develop an eight-wheel armoured car with all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering and two driver positions at front and rear. Deutsche Werke in Kiel were contracted to design the armoured body. The turret in the 231/232 series was altered to a hexagonal shape for increased internal volume, it was equipped with a long barrelled 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon and a coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun.

The Sd. Kfz. 231, 232 and 263 were initially built on chassis slightly modified for their needs. From July 1942 they were built on the same chassis and had their armour increased to 30 mm. From September 1941, a more powerful engine was installed, providing 180 PS instead of 155 PS. From late 1940 Stand-off angled armour plates were mounted about 50 cm in front of the vehicles. This additional armour was retrofitted to older vehicles and dropped with introduction of the strengthened front armour in July 1942.

;Sd. Kfz. 231
This was the standard reconnaissance variant built from 1937 to 1941. From July 1941, any need for a 231 was fulfilled by producing a 232 without the additional radio equipment. The official name was Sd. Kfz. 231 (8-&quot;rad&quot;).

;Sd. Kfz. 232
The Sd. Kfz. 232 (8-Rad), which was produced from 1938 to 1943, was a 231 with additional medium range radio sets and a large frame aerial. From 1942, a small (&#x27;star aerial&#x27;) replaced the frame aerial, a modification retrofitted to older models. The official name was (Fu) Sd. Kfz. 232 (8-rad).

;Sd. Kfz. 233
This was equipped with a short barrelled (L/24) 7.5 cm KwK 37 gun and based on the open-topped superstructure of the Sd. Kfz. 263 (8-Rad) radio vehicle. 109 of these vehicles were built at the Büssing plant between December 1942 and October 1943. A further 10 were converted from 263 chassis in October 1942. This variant of the Sd.Kfz. series entered service during 1942 and remained in use throughout the war. They were issued as a platoon of six vehicles in support of reconnaissance battalions. The official name was (7,5 cm) Sd. Kfz. 233.

;Sd. Kfz. 263 (8-rad)

This was an eight-wheeler with an increased height superstructure armed with a single 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun. It was a dedicated radio vehicle with the bedstead frame aerial. The official name was &quot;Sd. Kfz&quot;. 263 (8-&quot;rad&quot;).

===Sd.Kfz. 234 family===

The Sd.Kfz. 234 series were completely new designs, of a similar size and appearance to the Sd.Kfz. 231 family that they replaced. They were powered by a Tatra diesel. One external difference is the single-piece mudguards compared to the two-piece mudguards on the 232 series.

;Sd. Kfz. 234/1
The Sd.Kfz. 234/1 was fitted with a 2 cm KwK 38 L/55 gun and coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 or MG 42 machine gun in a rotating six-sided open-topped turret. The open top was protected from grenades by a mesh-covered frame. The second version to enter production, it was built from July 1944 to the end of war.

;Sd. Kfz. 234/2
This version had a turret adapted from the cancelled VK 1602 &quot;Leopard&quot; mounting a long barrel (60 calibres) 5 cm KwK 39/1, similar to the weapon previously used on the later versions of the Panzer III. It weighed nearly 12 tons but was still capable of . It was one of the most heavily armed armoured cars available. However, engagement was strictly discouraged due to its thin armour, and also due to its intended role of reconnaissance. The armoured car could be driven backwards by the radio operator in an emergency. Series production started in December 1943 and ended in July 1944, with production switching to 234/1 and 234/3. Many publications use the name &quot;Puma&quot; for this vehicle, but this was neither officially used nor was it a nickname.

;Sd. Kfz. 234/3
This version, like the Sd.Kfz. 233, carried the short-barreled (24 calibres) 7.5 cm K 51 gun, in a raised open superstructure. The gun&#x27;s low velocity made its armour-piercing round ineffective against most Allied tanks, but allowed the high-explosive shell casing to be thinner and thus contain more explosive. The HEAT round for this weapon was, however, effective against vehicles. In December 1944, production ended in favour of the 234/4.

;Sd. Kfz. 234/4
Another variant of the 8 wheeler, but mounting a 7.5 cm PaK 40 L/46 anti-tank gun in an open compartment. This variant was similar to the Marder tank destroyer series in that it was a weakly armoured, open-topped anti-tank vehicle that could not engage enemy armour head to head; it was a stop-gap measure.

<text>Crystal Castles is an arcade video game released by Atari, Inc. in 1983. The player controls Bentley Bear who has to collect gems located throughout trimetric-projected rendered castles while avoiding enemies, some of whom are after the gems as well. 

The game was made by Franz Lanzinger and was the first game he ever developed. He joined Atari in 1983 and was initially tasked with making a game like &quot;Asteroids&quot; (1979). While he was developing the graphics for it involving the unique backgrounds, the game began to evolve into what became &quot;Crystal Castles&quot;. It is a maze video game with warp zones to higher levels and an ending, which were not typical in arcade games in 1983.

Following the game&#x27;s release in arcades, it was released for the Atari 2600 home console and various home-computer lines. Critics often complimented the game for its unique graphics. Bentley Bear appeared in educational home computer programs from Atari as well as &quot;Atari Karts&quot; (1995) for the Jaguar. Lanzinger left Atari after developing the game and, after attempting to get the rights to the character, he developed a similarly styled game with &quot;Gubble&quot; (1997).

==Gameplay==

&quot;Crystal Castles&quot; features Bentley Bear as the playable character. In the Arcade flyer, the narrative states that Bentley Bear went to the land of Crystal Castles to gather gemstones. The Atari 2600 manual alters the narrative slightly in that, after taking a nap, Bentley found himself in a huge castle where he was trapped by Berthilda the Witch. To escape, he had to collect gems while avoiding the Berthhilda&#x27;s minions.

In the original arcade game, the player controls Bentley with a trackball throughout a maze of 16 different playing fields. Bentley can also jump which allows him to avoid obstacles. The player must collect all of the gemstones scattered throughout each maze to progress to the next level. Since some enemies eat the gems, players can earn bonus points for collecting the last gem on the board. Other items are sometimes present, like honeypots, that award bonus points when picked up. Different enemies follow unique patterns, such as trees that try to find the quickest path to Bentley and are stunned briefly if he jumps over them. The Gem Eaters can be defeated if Bentley runs into them while a gemstone is rising up through their body. Each level has four waves; the fourth one features Berthilda the Witch, whom Bentley can defeat when he wears the magic hat located in the maze. The hat otherwise makes Bentley briefly invincible to enemies. In the ending, the players receive a congratulatory message and ranking based on how many lives they have and a bonus score based on how quickly they played, followed by an animation that reproduces rectangles.

==Development==
Franz Lanzinger was the developer of &quot;Crystal Castles&quot;. Lanzinger had been programming on his own since 1971 and dropped out of a mathematics degree at the University of California in Berkeley to pursue a career in scientific research. Lanzinger was a fan of arcade games and when his friend Brian McGhie was hired by Atari as part of a testing group, Lanzinger was recommended to Atari by McGhie due to his proficiency in coding in assembly language and was hired in 1982. It was the first game he ever developed. Lanzinger later thanked McGhee, including his initials &quot;BBM&quot; in a level in &quot;Crystal Castles&quot;. 

Upon arrival at the company, Lanzinger had to choose from a book on approved projects and picked one titled &quot;Toporoids&quot;, a variation of Atari&#x27;s &quot;Asteroids&quot; (1979) arcade game. He was without a development system for his first month at Atari, leading him to spend the first few months working on a Mainframe computer creating three-dimensional backgrounds as the intended topology of the game. He recalled he would make five or so variants of the backgrounds each day. As he developed them, he began experimenting with them, and created an E.T.-like character that would move along the architecture. He started to feel like he could make a very different game than &quot;Toporoids&quot;.

At this time, there was no theme or enemies in the game. Lanzinger and some co-workers began thinking of ideas for the game and developed a Fairy tale theme such as moving trees and a witch from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). The idea of Bentley Bear came from these sessions. The bear was initially named Bear Braveheart, which was changed by Atari&#x27;s marketing team feeling it would be offensive to Indigenous people. A competition was held among the engineering team to rename the character with Bentley being chosen.

Lanzinger was a fan of the games &quot;Centipede&quot; (1981) and &quot;Millipede&quot; (1982) that used a trackball to control the game, which led him to using one in &quot;Crystal Castles&quot;. 
Towards the end of development, Lanzinger said Atari management had strongly encouraged him to change to a joystick control scheme. He recalled that this motion did not go forward as the game became much worse through joystick control as it was not designed for it. Lanzinger wrote all the code for the game. Two graphic artists employed by Atari contributed to the art, including Barbara Singh who created the majority of the motion objects and Susan McBride who also added a few. Lanzinger described the gameplay as &quot;really just 3D &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980).&quot; Atari programmer Dave Ralston helped design some additional mazes when prototypes were being placed in arcades. Originally, there were 12 mazes, with Ralston helping design some of the more complicated ones for the later portion of the game.

While developing the game, he spent $2,000 as a tax write-off playing arcade games as research. He stated that it was important to be accustomed to arcade games which helped him &quot;make good decisions about game design, it pushed me in the right direction.&quot; Watching other people play games like &quot;Tempest&quot; (1981) and having to take long periods of time to get to the skill level they wanted to be at inspired Lanzinger to include warps in the game, to let advanced players get to the more difficult stages early on and to keep game time low for more income on a coin-op. The secret of the warps are shown later in the game to alert players to them.

&quot;Crystal Castles&quot; for the Atari ST was programmed by Andromeda Software, a company based in Hungary.

==Release==
&quot;Crystal Castles&quot; was released in arcades on July 8, 1983. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade game on their December 15, 1983 issue as being the fifth most-successful upright arcade unit of the month. 

Both the Atari 2600 and the original Arcade versions of &quot;Crystal Castles&quot; was re-released in various compilation formats, such as the &quot;Atari Anniversary Edition&quot; for Dreamcast and PlayStation in 2001, &quot;Atari 80 in One&quot; for Windows in 2003 and the &quot;Atari Anthology&quot; for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2004, &quot;Atari Greatest Hits: Volume 2&quot; for Nintendo DS in 2011, and the &quot;Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration&quot; (2022) compilation for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Steam, and Xbox One.

==Reception==
Reviewing the original arcade release, Bill Kunkel of &quot;Electronic Games&quot; described the sound and graphics as &quot;top notch&quot;, but what made &quot;Crystal Castles&quot; a solid game was its play value. Michael Blanchet of &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot; said that while &quot;unimaginative maze games abound&quot;, &quot;Crystal Castles&quot; benefitted from a &quot;fresh and novel approach&quot; Roger C. Sharpe writing in &quot;Play Meter&quot; found the games graphics and cabinet to have &quot;stunning&quot; artwork, and highlighted the games personality, writing &quot;what&#x27;s nice about the game is that players have a storyline. You do get a sense of movement as you finish a screen and then watch Bentley move to another as it quickly takes shape on screen.&quot; In &quot;Electronic Games&quot; 1985 Arkie Awards, &quot;Crystal Castles&quot; received a Certificate of Merit in the Coin-op Division. The award was a salute to &quot;the upper crust of gameware&quot; which did not win any major award.

The Atari 2600 port of &quot;Crystal Castles&quot; was released in March 1984. In 1984, several ports for &quot;Crystal Castles&quot; were announced, including the Commodore 64, Apple IIe, IBM Personal Computer, and VIC-20. In 1984, Andy Harris wrote in &quot;TV Gamer&quot; that none of the home versions of the game had the superb graphic quality of the arcade game, which was constantly entertaining with several surprises. Reviewing versions for the BBC Micro and Commodore 64 (C64), &quot;Nicky&quot; of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; stated they &quot;haven&#x27;t played such a satisfying game of grab-the-loot-and-run for a long time&quot; noting both versions ran quickly and were faithful copies of the arcade games. Reviewing the C64 release, the reviewers in &quot;Zzap!&quot; disagreed on the overall quality. One reviewer fond of the arcade game recommended it to fellow fans. Another felt it did not live up to the arcade game while another said the game was &quot;little more than glorified &quot;Pac-Man&quot;&quot;.

In retrospective reviews, Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame gave the arcade game a four and a half star rating out of five, noting the game had memorable characters, catchy music, addicting gameplay and was a &quot;beautiful game.&quot; In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked the game 95th on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot; In his book &quot;The Video Games Guide&quot;, Matt Fox gave the arcade game a two out of five star rating, finding the building-block like graphics unappealing and that the all the gems, enemies and Bentley appeared small which made the game &quot;worlds away&quot; from the immediacy of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. Reviewing the game in 1989, &quot;ACE&quot; commented that the arcade release was &quot;one of the most addictive cabinets ever&quot;, and the budget release from home computers by Kixx was &quot;ultimately pointless, yet totally unputdownable arcade entertainment.&quot; &quot;Zzap!&quot; re-reviewed the budget re-release; while finding it repetitive and difficult to control, ultimately they wrote that &quot;the Pac-man concept still has a lot of strength (look at &quot;Pac-Mania&quot; on the Amiga) and this is one of the best versions around.&quot;

==Legacy==
Following &quot;Crystal Castles&quot;, Lanzinger began development on an arcade machine based on the film &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984). He visited the set, but left Atari after a dispute with them over residuals paid to coin-op developers for sales of home conversions. In an interview published in 2022, Lanzinger commented &quot;I was young and naïve and felt that I owned &quot;Crystal Castles&quot;.&quot; He initially left the video game industry before working for Tengen on their ports of games like &quot;Toobin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;.

&quot;Crystal Castles&quot; did not receive a sequel. Lanzinger initially worked on one making a follow-up with new levels and giving Bentley Bear the ability to jump twice as high. Development on the sequel was never completed. In the mid-1990s, Lanzinger formed Actual Entertainment to create a sequel to &quot;Crystal Castles&quot;. The group could not get the rights, but they developed a similarly themed game titled &quot;Gubble&quot; (1997). Bentley Bear reappeared in educational programs such as &quot;Bentley Bear&#x27;s Magical Math&quot; for the Atari ST and as a playable character in &quot;Atari Karts&quot; (1995) for the Atari Jaguar. In 2024, Atari announced the release of an updated version of their Atari 7800 console with the 7800+. The release would include a sequel to &quot;Crystal Castles&quot; titled &quot;Bentley Bear&#x27;s Crystal Quest&quot;. The game is a platformer that was initially programmed as a homebrew title.

Lanzinger stated that &quot;Crystal Castles&quot; remained his favorite game which he had worked on, but later said he did not think of the implications of using a trackball for the game, saying &quot;In retrospect, having a trackball is a hindrance as it&#x27;s hard to get the feel right with a different controller.&quot;

&quot;Crystal Castles&quot; includes warps, pre-dating their popular use in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985). It is also among the earliest arcade games to have a distinct ending. Lanzinger wrote a two-page memo to his bosses stating that if video games are aspiring to tell stories, they should have satisfying conclusions.
