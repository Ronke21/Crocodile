<text>Fortunatus is a German proto-novel or chapbook about a legendary hero popular in 15th- and 16th-century Europe, and usually associated with a magical inexhaustible purse.

The plot of the novel also appears in variants from oral tradition across Europe, Asia, Americas and Africa, which are classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as tale type ATU 566, &quot;The Three Magic Objects and the Wonderful Fruits&quot;.

==Tale==
The tale follows the life of a young man named Fortunatus from relative obscurity through his adventures towards fame and fortune; it subsequently follows the careers of his two sons. Fortunatus was a native, says the story, of Famagusta in Cyprus, and meeting the goddess of Fortune in a forest received from her a purse which was continually replenished as often as he drew from it. With this he wandered through many lands, and at Cairo was the guest of the sultan. Among the treasures which the sultan showed him was an old napless hat which had the power of transporting its wearer to any place he desired. Of this hat, he feloniously possessed himself and returned to Cyprus, where he led a luxurious life. On his death he left the purse and the hat to his sons Ampedo and Andelosia; but they were jealous of each other, and by their recklessness and folly soon fell on evil days.

Like Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; tale &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, &quot;Fortunatus&quot; is a tale which marks the passing of the feudal world into the more modern, globalised, capitalist world. Not quite a morality tale in the purest sense, it nonetheless was clearly written in order to convey lessons to the reader. The moral of the story is obvious: men should desire reason and wisdom before all the treasures of the world. It is far too easy, without wisdom, to lose one&#x27;s fortune, no matter how it was acquired.

==Sources==

According to the recent English translator Michael Haldane, &quot;Fortunatus&quot; was first published in Augsburg in 1509. It was printed by one Johann Otmar and sold in Johannes Heybler&#x27;s apothecary in that city. Many sources were integrated to create the text. These include:
* The &quot;Itinerarius&quot; of Johannes von Montevilla (or John de Mandeville), 1355; translated into German 1480, the oldest extant dated editions having been printed in Augsburg (1481 and 1482).
* The story of Wlad III Drakul (1456–62, 1476 Lord of Wallachia, or Vlad the Impaler), the oldest extant dated German accounts having been printed in Nuremberg (1488), Bamberg (1491) and Augsburg (1494).
* The &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;, printed in Augsburg in 1473.
* Two accounts of St. Patrick&#x27;s Purgatory printed in Augsburg in 1489.
* Hans Tucher der Ältere, &quot;Beschreibung der Reyß ins Heylig Land&quot; [1479-80] (Augsburg, 1482).
* Bernhard von Breydenbach, &quot;Peregrinationes in terram sanctam&quot; (1486); &quot;Die heyligen reyssen gen Jherusalem&quot; (Mainz, 1486; Augsburg, 1488?).
* Rudolf von Ems, &quot;Willehalms von Orlens und Amelies&quot;. 13th century; printed in Augsburg, 1491.
* Perhaps the travels of the Bohemian nobleman Leo von Rozmital (1465–67). These can be read in: Malcolm Letts (ed.), &quot;The Travels of Leo of Rozmital through Germany, Flanders England, France Spain, Portugal and Italy, 1465-67&quot;. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1957.

In its full form the history of Fortunatus occupies, in Karl Simrock&#x27;s &quot;Die deutschen Volksbucher&quot;, vol. iii., upwards of 158 pages. The scene is continually shifted – from Cyprus to Flanders, from Flanders to London, from London to France; and a large number of secondary characters appear.

The style and allusions indicate a comparatively modern date for the authorship; but the nucleus of the legend can be traced back to a much earlier period. The stories of Jonathas and the three jewels in the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;, of the emperor Frederick and the three precious stones in the &quot;Cento Novelle antiche&quot;, of the Mazin of Khorassan in the &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot;, and the flying scaffold in the &quot;Bahar Danush&quot;, have all a certain similarity.

The 19th-century German journalist Joseph Görres wrote a lengthy essay about the source of the story of Fortunatus, suggesting a Nordic origin and a possible ancient source: the tale of Jonathan, son of Darius, in the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;.

The Brothers Grimm, in the annotations to their tales, suggested an Iberian or Spanish source for the Fortunatus tale, based on names such as Ampedo and Andolosia.

==Author==
The author is not known; it has been suggested that he may have been Burkhard Zink (1396-1474/5), an Augsburg merchant, councillor, chronicler and traveller. His Augsburg chronicle covers the years 1368-1468 and comprises four books, of which the third, an autobiography, is considered the best, and he is praised for giving &quot;Einblicke von seltener Eindringlichkeit in die Lebensrealität des SpätMA&quot; (&quot;outstandingly penetrating insights into the reality of life in the late Middle Ages&quot;); The most plausible suggestion to date is that Johannes Heybler – the publisher – was himself the author.

==Versions==

The earliest known edition of the German text of &quot;Fortunatus&quot; appeared at Augsburg in 1509, and the modern German investigators are disposed to regard this as the original form. Karl Simrock reproduced this version in his &quot;Deutsche Volksbücher&quot; (3 vols., Frankfort, 1846). In 1530 an edition was published entitled &quot;Fortunatus von seinem Seckel und Wunschhütlein&quot;. Innumerable versions occur in French, Italian, Dutch and English. The story was dramatized by Hans Sachs in 1553, and by Thomas Dekker in 1600, titled &quot;Old Fortunatus;&quot; and the latter&#x27;s comedy appeared in a German translation in &quot;Englische Komodien und Tragodien&quot;, 1620. Ludwig Tieck has utilized the legend in his &quot;Phantasus&quot;, and Adelbert von Chamisso in his &quot;Peter Schlemihl&quot;; and Ludwig Uhland left an unfinished narrative poem entitled &quot;Fortunatus and his Sons&quot;.

19th-century theologue Johann Andreas Christian Löhr wrote an abridged and moralizing tale (German: &quot;Fortunat mit seinem Säckel und Wünschhütlein&quot;; English: &quot;Fortunatus with his bag and wishing-cap&quot;), using as basis the story of Fortunatus.

An anonymous English compilation of French fairy tales written by Charles Perrault and Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy published the story as &quot;Fortunatus, or the Wishing Cap&quot;. A later publication renamed it &quot;Fortunatus and the Wishing Cap&quot;. Andrew Lang included it in &quot;The Grey Fairy Book&quot; as &quot;Fortunatus and his Purse&quot;.

A fairy tale compilation by English novelist Dinah Craik included the tale, under the name &quot;Fortunatus&quot;, following an 1818 publication by Benjamin Tabart, who included an homonymous tale. In the same vein, Ernest Rhys edited a collection of English fairy tales and included one version of tale, named &quot;Old Fortunatus&quot; after the English play. A third English version exists, titled &quot;The History of Fortunatus&quot;.

==Analysis==
===Hero and donor===
In folkloristics, the gifting of a never-emptying purse by a magical being is part of a series of tales later classified in the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index as ATU 566, &quot;The Three Magic Objects and the Wonderful Fruits&quot;. In several variants, the goddess of Fortune of the original tale is replaced by an old lady, a princess or other supernatural being.

Scholarship points that the hero of the tale is sometimes an only child who is given the three objects, or one of three brothers or friends who are each given one of the items. Folklorist Joseph Jacobs also noted that the protagonists of the story were &quot;generally ... three soldiers, or often brothers, but more frequently casual comrades.&quot;

===Magic objects===
The tale is close to &quot;The Knapsack, the Hat, and the Horn&quot; (KHM 54 and ATU 569), where three brothers are given the magical objects. In the same vein, scholarship points to some relationship between tale types ATU 563, &quot;The Table, the Ass, and the Stick&quot;, ATU 566 and ATU 569, a relationship already noticed by scholar Reinhold Köhler (de).

Despite their proximity, these tales differ in that in the ATU 566 the adversary is a cunning princess who acquires the magical objects, but gets her just deserts with magical fruits that grow horns or other deformities when eaten. The usual deformities are horns, instead of the nose (as in Grimm&#x27;s version). In tale type ATU 563, the hero regains the magical objects by a third magical item, usually a stick.

William Alexander Clouston, Scottish folklorist, published an essay in which he compared the magic objects of the &quot;Fortunatus&quot; tale with many tales featuring similar items. Professor Michael Meraklis noted that the usual objects in Greek variants are a hat that grants invisibility, a rifle that shoots in any direction, a sheet that makes the user fly and a tobacco pipe that summons a servant.

===Possible origins===
Folklorist Stith Thompson suggested that the ATU 566 tale is &quot;essentially west European folk tradition&quot;, following professor Antti Aarne&#x27;s study on some 145 variants (most of which are European). On the other hand, French scholar Claude Bremond put forth a theory that tale types 566 &quot;Fortunatus&quot;, 567 &quot;The Magic Bird-Heart&quot; and 938 &quot;Placidus&quot;/&quot;Eustacius&quot; are related and derive from a single source, possibly Indian.

A third position, by Hans-Jörg Uther, argues that, due to the proximity between tale types ATU 566, ATU 567, ATU 567A, the type ATU 567 may have originated from a combination with type ATU 566. In this regard, scholar Christine Ohno&#x27;s analysis of all three tale types suggested a combination of the Indian version of ATU 566 and ATU 567A, &quot;The Magic Bird-Heart and the Separated Brothers&quot;, gave rise to the South Asian story of &quot;Saiyid and Said&quot; and from the latter originated the &quot;West European&quot; version of the tale type ATU 567, where the magical bird falls into the hands of a sole hero, instead of two brothers as in other variants.

Emmanuel Cosquin noted, in his time, two distinct groups of stories: the first one, where the hero regains the magical objects with the use of the fruits; and the second one, close to the tales later classified as ATU 567, &quot;The Magic Bird-Heart&quot;. Stith Thompson mentioned that Aarne&#x27;s folktale study pinpointed its origin as Asiatic, possibly originating in Persia, and Richard MacGillivray Dawkins remarked that variants are found in Turkey, south Siberia and in Persia itself. Regardless, the tale can also be found throughout India and versions of it are attested in ancient Buddhist and Jain literature. Similar stories are attested in historical Burmese anecdotes and as an ancient tale from the &quot;Jatakas&quot;, with a magical rooster, or a pair of birds named Bihangama and Bihangami.

French man of letter, Comte de Caylus wrote a version of the tale of the Magic Bird Heart, titled &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Jaune&quot; (&quot;The Yellow Bird&quot;) and inserted the story in the narrative of his tale &quot;Sylvain and Jocosa&quot;. &quot;The Yellow Bird&quot; shows heavy Eastern influence.

==Variants==
===Early parallels===
Johannes Bolte and Jiří Polívka list as early literary parallels an Italian story from the 16th century (&quot;Historia di tre giovani e di tre fate&quot;) and a French literary story from &quot;Le Cabinet des Fées&quot; with an oriental flair (French: &quot;Histoire du Prince Tangut et de la princesse au pied de nez&quot;; English: &quot;The History of Prince Tangut and the princess with a nose a foot long&quot;).

Another literary predecessor pointed by both scholars is &quot;Die Prinzessin mit der langen Nase&quot;, penned by Friedrich Hildebrand von Einsiedel, whose work was published in the collection &quot;Dschinnistan&quot; (1789), by Christoph Martin Wieland. This tale was also adapted to the stage as &quot;Der Barometermacher auf der Zauberinsel&quot; (1823) (de).

David Blamires points that the tale of Jonathan, in the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;, is a version of the folktype later classified as ATU 566.

Spanish scholarship recognizes &quot;La ventura en la desdicha&quot;, one of the works of Zaragozan religious writer Ana Francisca Abarca de Bolea (1679), as containing an incarnation of the story of Fortunatus written as a moralizing tale.

===Europe===
==== Ireland ====
Irish folklorist Patrick Kennedy listed an Irish variant titled &quot;Gilla na Gruaga Donna&quot; (&quot;The fellow with the brown hair&quot;), and noted, in his commentaries, that the tale was known in Germany as &quot;Die Drei Soldaten&quot; (&quot;The Three Soldiers&quot;).

Author Seumas MacManus published an Irish tale titled &quot;The Wishing Chair of the Lord of Errigal&quot;. In this tale, the Lord of Errigal dies, and his heirlooms are bequeathed to his son Cormac, a handsome fellow, but also a spendthrift. Part of the inheritance is a normal looking armchair that is actually a magical wishing chair. He decides to have the daughter of the Lord Mayor as his wife (and her fortune). Unfortunately for him, she is also a skilled gambler, and beats him in a game, leaving him penniless. Later, Cormac meets some hunters on a hunt for a specific hare, the White Hare of Glen-na-smoil, whose right paw grants infinite money. With this new source of money, Cormac regains his wealth, to the Lord Mayor&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s interest: she plays with him again and steals from him the hare&#x27;s right paw while he is asleep. Next, Cormac finds another source of wealth, an egg from the Blackbird of Glen-na-smoil, which is also stolen by the Lord Mayor&#x27;s daughter. Falling into poverty twice, the youth goes to rest on his father&#x27;s unsuspecting armchair, and utters loudly he wishes to be in the Lord Mayor&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s house. It happens thus: the Lord Mayor&#x27;s daughter finds out about the Wishing Chair, and goads Cormac to wish them away to the &quot;Isle of Loneliness&quot;. He fulfills her request, and both are teleported to the island. The girl takes the opportunity to caress his hair and stick a &quot;bioran suan&quot; (a sleeping pin) on his head, sits on the chair and wishes her away, abandoning Cormac on the island. The youth wakes up and notices he all alone in the island, then goes to find some food source: green apples that make horns appear on the head, and red apples that make it fall. The next year, Cormac waits for a ship to rescue him and takes the apples with him to teach the Lord Mayor&#x27;s daughter a lesson.

Irish author Edna O&#x27;Brien published an Irish variant in her book &quot;Tales for the Telling&quot;, with the title &quot;The Magic Apples&quot;. In this tale, a very lazy boy named Marty welcomes a beggar and his daughter, Sinead, to his house and gives them manna as food. Marty and Sinead marry and have a son named Marteen. Years later, Marteen decides to earn his fortune, and meets a pedlar on the road, who tells him of a rich lord and his daughter in Limerick. Marteen decides to go there to impress the lord&#x27;s daughter with his acrobatics and tricks, and meets three beggars on the road (who are the same person), to whom Marteen gives his money. In gratitude, the beggar takes Marteen to an inn and gives the youth a magic ring that always produces money. Marteen goes to Limerick, buys some fine clothes and introduces himself to the lord and his daughter. Marteen falls asleep and his ring falls from his pocket, which the lord&#x27;s daughter fetches, but her stepsister snatches from her hand and runs to her room. The stepsister sees the ring in action when it provides bars of gold, and lies to the girl the ring fell in a pond. Marteen learns of the ring&#x27;s loss, then goes home despondent. Some time later, after an episode with the lord himself and four talking cats, Marteen cures the lord with water from the boundary well of Coolawn, and asks him again about the ring. Later, Marteen meets in the woods three brothers boxing over their inheritance: a teleporting ring, a self-filling goblet and a harp that plays every tune. Marteen tricks the boys, unburies the objects and goes again to Limerick to impress his beloved. Again, Marteen drinks from the self-filling cup and falls asleep; the stepsister steals the second ring, the cup and the harp. Marteen wakes up and, not seeing the objects, leaves. He then goes to an orchard where he eats red apples (which make horns grow on his head) and golden apples (which breaks off the horns). Marteen takes both types of fruits with him to the lord&#x27;s house in Limerick and offers them to the inhabitants: horns grow on their heads, and Marteen promises to reverse the change if he gets the objects back. His beloved, the girl, points to her stepsister as the culprit, and Marteen gives them the golden apples, as he promised.

==== Scotland ====
A Scottish variant, titled &quot;The Three Soldiers&quot;, was collected by John Francis Campbell in &quot;Popular Tales of the West Highlands&quot;. He also collected and transcribed a version in Gaelic (&quot;Ursgeul&quot;), as well as a version with &quot;Coinneach Buidhe&quot; (&quot;Kenneth the Yellow&quot;), from Dibaig, and a version from Castle Bay, Barra, involving swan maidens. He also compared it to &quot;The Krautesel&quot;, or &quot;Donkey Cabbages&quot;, where the characters are transformed into donkeys. Campbell&#x27;s tale was translated by Loys Brueyre as &quot;Les Trois Soldats&quot;.

====Germany====
French-born poet Adelbert von Chamisso developed in 1806 his own treatment of the Fortunatus legend, titled &quot;Fortunati Glücksäckel und Wunschhütlein&quot;.

The Brothers Grimm collected a previous version titled &quot;Die lange Nase&quot;, with many similarities to the Donkey Cabbages tale, but it was expunged from later editions of the collection. Apart from Grimm&#x27;s purged tale, variants with the title &quot;Die lange Nase&quot; (English: &quot;The long nose&quot;) or the like were also collected by Louis Curtze, from Berndorf, August Ey, in Oberharze; Wilhelm Wisser, in Silesia (German: &quot;De Prinzessin mit de lang&#x27; Nes&quot;&#x27;).

A Hessian variant was collected by the Brothers Grimm, but not published in their famous collection. Instead, it found its place in the third volume of their &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot; (1856 publication), which contained their annotations on the tales: three soldiers stand guard in a forest at night and receive the items from a short old man. The Brothers Grimm version was translated into the English language as &quot;The Nose&quot;, by Edgar Taylor, as &quot;The Three Soldiers and the Dwarf&quot;, by Laura Valentine, as &quot;The Nose-Tree&quot; by Marian Edwardes, in her 1912 publication, and as &quot;Red Jacket, or, The Nose Tree&quot;, in a book illustrated by Leonard Leslie Brooke. &quot;The Nose Tree&quot; was supposedly collected from Dorothea Viehmann (&quot;Zwehrn&quot;), a regular contributor of tales to the Brothers Grimm.

A version by Heinrich Pröhle (&quot;Die Geschenke der Klagefrau&quot;) differs in that four soldier brothers are given the magic objects, instead of the usual three heroes.

A variant where the soldier&#x27;s name is explicitly given as Fortunatus, and the stealing princess is killed, can be found in the newly discovered collection of Bavarian folk and fairy tales of Franz Xaver von Schönwerth, titled &quot;The Scorned Princess&quot; (German: &quot;Der Wunderbeutel, das Wünschhütchen und das Wunderhorn&quot;).

A literary treatment of the legend of Fortunatus is present in the work of Johann Karl August Musäus: his &quot;Volksmärchen der Deutschen&quot; contains the story of &quot;Rolands Knappen&quot; (&quot;Roland&#x27;s Squires&quot;). A French translation (&quot;Les Écuyers de Roland&quot;) can be found in &quot;Contes de Museäus&quot; (1826). In a short summary: three military companions, in a crusade against &quot;infidels&quot;, take shelter in a cavern with an old lady who gifts them the purse, a mantle and a gauntlet. At the end of the tale, they never recover the objects, and rejoin the army to avenge their fallen leader, Roland.

A variant from Merano, &quot;Beutel, Hütlein und Pfeiflein&quot;, was collected by Ignaz and Joseph Zingerle.

Johann Reinhard Bünker collected a variant from the Heanzisch dialect, transcribing the dialect (&quot;Ta&#x27; Këinich van Rous&#x27;npea&#x27;ch&quot;).

There are variants where the hero does not marry the princess that cheats him out of the magical objects. Instead, he returns to the house where he gained the magical items and marries the donor (an enchanted maiden), as in a tale from Lower Saxony, &quot;Die Prinzessin mit dem Horne&quot; (English: &quot;The Princess with Horns&quot;).

====Austria====
In an Austrian variant, collected by the Zingerle Brothers in Zillertal (&quot;Vom reichen Ritter und seinen Söhnen&quot;), the father, a famous and beloved local lord, dies and his sons discover the secret of their fortune (the three magical objects: a pipe, a green hat and a ring).

====The Netherlands====
A version of the tale, titled &quot;De appels van Damasko&quot; (English: &quot;The apples of Damascus&quot;), was sent in 1894 to the collection of Dutch philologist Gerrit Jacob Boekenoogen. Another version was collected in 1901, narrated by a pair of siblings about a pair of brothers that inherit a magic flute and a magic cap, and the magical fruits are pears.

Another variant where pears are the transforming fruits is &quot;Van het tooverbeurzeken, het tooverstoksken en het tooverhoedje&quot; (&quot;The magical purse, the magical wand and the magical hat&quot;).

A recent study attested the presence of popular trickster hero Anansi, of West African folklore, in a ATU 566 tale collected from Creole inhabitants of the Netherlands.

====Belgium====
In a tale collected from Wallonia, &quot;L&#x27;arbre a cornes, ou Le cuisinier sans paireil&quot;, three brothers stay the night at a haunted inn and each of them receives a gift: a cloak, a tablecloth and the purse. The youngest borrows the other two objects from his elder brothers and teleports to another kingdom. There, he employs himself as a cook for the princess&#x27;s wedding feast. The princess steals the objects but he regains them with the aid of nose-enlarging prunes.

In a Flemish variant, &quot;Van Siepe, Sappe en Sijpe&quot;, the titular soldiers return from war with the three magical objects: the inexhaustible purse, a teleporting cloak and a cane that can summon an army. The trio use the items to rule over the native village, which attracts the attention of the king to put a stop to the situation. The princess suggests the king invites the three soldiers for a banquet. The soldiers then drink until they pass out. The princess then seizes the opportunity to take the objects and expel the drunken trio from the palace.

====France====
The Brothers Grimm, in the annotations to their tales, mentioned the existence of &quot;an old French fabliau&quot; version, with no further information.

Andrew Lang included a French variant in his &quot;The Green Fairy Book&quot; (&quot;The Little Soldier&quot;), which he obtained from Charles Deulin (titled &quot;Le Petit Soldat&quot;).

Henry Carnoy collected a variant from Warloy-Baillon, titled &quot;La bague magique&quot;, where the protagonist enlarges the nose of the princess with a ring and a spell.

Emmanuel Cosquin collected two variants from Lorraine: &quot;La bourse, le sifflet et le chapeau&quot; and a nameless variant in his annotations.

Two variants from Brittany were collected by François-Marie Luzel (&quot;Le laboureur, le prêtre et le clerc, ou La bourse, la serviette et le manteau&quot;) and Paul Sébillot (&quot;Les cornes enchantées&quot;). Sébillot also published two abridged versions in &quot;Revue de traditions populaires&quot;: &quot;Les poires qui font les cornes&quot; and &quot;La serviette, le manteau et la bourse&quot;.

Another variant was collected in Brittany by Adolphe Orain (&quot;Coeur de pigeon&quot;, &quot;The pigeon&#x27;s heart&quot;): a poor boy is adopted by a fairy who lives in the woods. The fairy helps her adopted child to win the hand of the princess.

Abbot Leopold Dardy collected two tales from Albret (Labrit) and Gascony: &quot;Pipéto&quot; (&quot;Pipette&quot;) and &quot;Lous trés hillos de là hadéto&quot; (&quot;Les trois filleuls de la fée&quot;).

In the 20th century, French ethnologist Genevieve Massignon collected another variant, from the Pyrenees, titled &quot;Les trois déserteurs&quot;. In a second variant, from Central France, collected by Henri Pourrat (&quot;La demoiselle au long nez&quot;; English: &quot;The Damsel with the Long Nose&quot;), the protagonist is given the magical objects by a miller&#x27;s daughter, and at the conclusion of the tale uses the items to return to the humble maiden, choosing her over the haughty princess. A third modern variant, collected by Achille Millien (&quot;Le Roi de Russie et le roi d&#x27;Espagne&quot;), was among the tales collected from Morvan and Nivernais.

====Basque country====
Wentworth Webster collected a Basque version called &quot;Dragon&quot; and, on a footnote, noted the parallel to John Francis Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Three Soldiers&quot; and its wide diffusion.

====Eastern Europe====
Folkloristic scholarship on Russian folk tales acknowledges the spread of the tale type &quot;in East Slavic tradition&quot;.

A tale from Bukovina, collected from Gypsy populations (&quot;The Seer&quot;), mixes two sources of physical transformation: figs and the water from a stream. The tale is also part of the &quot;Three Stolen Princesses&quot; type: three brothers/heroes rescue three princesses from a subterranean hideout.

In West Slavic sources, a version of the Slavic witch Baba Yaga, named Jezibaba, appears as an antagonist in a version of the ATU 566.

=====Russia=====
Professor Andrejev noted that the tale type 566, &quot;The Horns&quot;, showed 22 variants in Russia.

An early version in Russian was recorded in &quot;Старая погудка на новый лад&quot; (1794-1795), with the name &quot;Сказка об Иване-гостином сыне&quot; (&quot;The Tale of Ivan, the guest son&quot;): the story of two brothers, one eats the head of a magic bird and the other the heart. The one who ate the heart goes into the forest and resolves a dispute over magical objects (one of which is the purse) and escapes in a magic carpet to another kingdom.

Russian folktale collector Alexander Afanasyev compiled three variants of the tale, under the banner &quot;Рога&quot; (&quot;Roga&quot;; &quot;Horns&quot;).

Emmanuel Cosquin cited a Russian version from author A. A. Erlenwein, which was translated by Angelo de Gubernatis in his &quot;Florilegio&quot; with the name &quot;I tre Soldati&quot; (&quot;The three soldiers&quot;).

In another Russian variant, &quot;Bronze Brow&quot;, the tsarevich is expelled from home by the tsar because he let a creature named &quot;Bronze Brow&quot; escape. In his travels, he plays cards with the devil and wins the inexhaustible purse. Later on, a tsarevna and her father, who like to play cards, conspire to steal the magic purse.

In another Russian variant, &quot;Офицеръ и барыня&quot; (&quot;The Officer and the Lady&quot;), collected by Ivan Khudyakov (ru), an officer and a soldier desert from the army and camp out in a forest. A small forest creature meets the officer during three nights and gives him a tablecloth, a ring of invisibility and an inexhaustible wallet. They bet the items against a rich lady and lose them. The officer then wanders through the forest and finds some berries. After he eats the fruits, many horns grow on his body.

=====Ukraine=====
Professor Andrejev noted that the tale type 566, &quot;The Horns&quot;, showed 7 variants in Ukraine.

In a Ukrainian tale collected by folklorist from Khust with the title &quot;Сын лесника&quot; (&quot;The Forester&#x27;s Son&quot;), a forester keeps watch over a forest. On his deathbed, he tells his three sons to take over his job, but warn them never to enter the forest. After he dies, the youngest son, Mykola, suggests he and his brothers venture in to the forest, named Dead Forest, despite their father&#x27;s prohibition. And so they go. One night, they stop to rest, and the elder brother has the first watch. A forest spirit appears; the elder brother aims a gun at him, but the forest spirit begs to be spared and gives him a cap of invisibility. The same happens to the middle brother, who gains a magic pipe that summons an infinite amount of armed regiments, and Mikola, who gains a magic inexhaustible purse. They make their way of the forest and into an open field. They compare the gifts the forest spirit gave them, and, with the magic purse, buy themselves a large estate and live in luxury. The elder brothers find wives for themselves, and Mykola goes to another city, where he bets with a beautiful princess. He loses the cap of invisibility the first time, and borrows the magic purse to bet an inordinate amount of money against the princess, who exchanges the purse for a normal one and expels Mykola from the kingdom. He then borrows the magic pipe and tries to force the princess to return the objects, but she also steals the magic pipe. Mykola is sentenced with death, but the princess mitigates the sentence by having him blinded and dropped off in the forest. Mykola is guided to a forest, where he finds apples that make horns grow, pears that make them fall, and water of life that restores his sight. Mykola takes thea apples and pears, returns to the kingdom and sells the former to the princess and her parents. Horns grow on their heads; Mykola disguises himself as a doctor and goes to court to cure the royal family; but reserves a special punishment for the princess until she return the three objects she stole. After he gains the objects back, Mykola heals the princess and they marry.

=====Poland=====
Polish ethnographer Stanisław Ciszewski (pl) collected a variant from Smardzowice, titled &quot;O trzech braciach, którym królewna kradnie cudowne przedmioty, za co wyrastają jej rogi&quot; (&quot;About three brothers, from which a princess steals items and on whom horns grow&quot;), where the three brothers gain a cloak of invisibility, a whistle to summon an army and magical shoes. The princess steals the items, the youngest brother who gained the shoes uses magic apples to retrieve the items and does not marry the princess.

=====Czech Republic=====
In a Czech version, &quot;The Soldier and the Devil&quot;, a soldier meets three beggars on his way and gives each a penny. Seeing his generosity, God gives him three items: a self-igniting pipe, a knapsack that forces people to enter it with one specific command and the never-emptying purse. The soldier was also a skilled cardplayer and wanted to bet with a card-playing princess. Ending at a draw, the princess resorts to stealing the items while the soldier is asleep.

In another Czech variant, &quot;The Cuirassier and the Horned Princess&quot;, translated by Jeremiah Curtin, twelve soldiers desert their regiment and pass the night in a sorceress&#x27;s house. Nine of them die that night for disobeying the sorceress&#x27;s orders to not open the boxes they received. The three survivors are allowed to leave the house with their boxes by the sorceress. They soon find a mantle, a cap and the purse. The tale was first collected by Benes Method Kulda, with the title &quot;O jednom kyrysarovi&quot; (&quot;About one cuirassier&quot;).

In a Moravian version, &quot;Princezna Tuta s dlouhým nosem&quot; (&quot;Princess Tuta with the long nose&quot;), a poor king reveals to his son the secret of his fortune, buried an apple tree, and dies. His son soon digs under the tree and finds three chests with three treasures: the purse, a belt that can teleport and a whistle to summon an army. He tries to use the objects to impress the princess from a neighbouring kingdom, who steals the items. Later the prince tries to kill himself, but finds a pear tree with the nose-enlarging fruits and a stream whose water unmakes the transformation.

In another Moravian variant, &quot;O třech vojácích&quot; (&quot;About three soldiers&quot;), a drummer, a soldier and a corporal desert the army and pass the night in a house in the forest. Inside the house, the soldiers are greeted by three cursed princesses, who ask the three men to help her break their curse. After three nights, the men depart, but not before giving them a sword that can summon an army, a teleporting cloak and the purse. Soon after, the men arrive in a city where the princess steals the items from them. The soldiers then decide to get new jobs. One day, the three find a magic candle that can summon a spirit. They use the spirit to retrieve the magic objects and expel the princess and her father and reign in their place.

====Slovakia====
Linguist Jiri Polívka analysed two Slovak variants, wherein three brothers enter an enchanted castle and see three enchanted maidens, who asks for their help in breaking the curse of the castle. The brothers fail, yet are still rewarded with the magical items. In the first variant, the three men never return to the castle, but one of the brothers, named Janko, uses the magical fruits (pears) on a princess and marries her. In another, the items are stolen by a taverner&#x27;s daughter and are given back when the fruits are used (apples and pears). In this second variant, the brothers return to the enchanted castle and disenchant the princesses.

====Hungary====
Hungarian folktale collections attest a few variants: &quot;A szent leányok ajándéka&quot; (&quot;The gifts of the fairies&quot;); &quot;A három szerencsepróbáló&quot; (&quot;The three trials of fortune&quot;), collected by Elek Benedek.

In another tale, &quot;A három mirha&quot;, a mother gifts three things for her third and youngest son (a golden watch, a golden necklace and a necktie). The youth becomes infatuated with a woman, who steals his belongings. Later, he discovers a stream whose water makes one ill and apples that make one healthy.

In the tale &quot;A két árva királyfi&quot; (&quot;The Two Orphaned Princes&quot;), the stepmother queen wants to eat the liver and the heart of her stepchildren&#x27;s pet bird. Princes Miklós and András eat the organs: Miklós becomes a king and András marries the youngest daughter of a foreign king. His wife gives him a cap of invisibility and a magical whip, before he travels to an enchanted castle that belongs to a maiden named Zsófi. Zsófi steals the whip, but prince András uses the cap to embark on a ship that leads him to a distant island. There, the prince finds a grapevine whose blue-black grapes make a millstone appear on the neck, and white grapes that make it disappear.

In the tale &quot;Három Nemeslegény&quot; (&quot;The Three Noblemen&quot;), three brothers give shelter to an old lady for three times, and every time the old lady rewards them with a gift: the inexhaustible purse, a cap of invisibility and a golden cane that can summon several troops. When they continue on their journey, they arrive at a city where a princess likes to gamble in card games. One of the brothers bets and loses the purse and the cap, and the princess tricks him out of the golden cane. Later, he sleeps underneath a tree and the old lady appears in his dreams to advise him to use magic apples and water from a magical spring to regain the objects.

====Romania====
A tale titled &quot;Härstäldai&quot; was collected from Romania and pertains to the ATU 566 tale-type: the soldier spends the night in a hut that belongs to the devil. Unflinching, the soldier menaces the creature with his gun and receives the magic purse.

In a second variant (German: &quot;Drei Spieler&quot;; English: &quot;Three Players&quot; or &quot;Three Gamblers&quot;), collected by Pauline Schullerus, three brothers, gamblers, acquire the magic items from a mysterious woman in a house in the forest. The youngest gains the magical purse and loses it to a princess. As a payback, he does not cure her of the horns when he gets his items back.

A variant from the Aromanian language, named &quot;Căciula, punga și trâmbița&quot; (&quot;The Cap, the Purse and the Horn&quot;), was collected and published in 1967, in a series of Romanian storybooks titled &quot;Povești nemuritoare&quot;. The tale is part of Volume 5 (ro).

The tale is attested in Pomaks oral tradition, but instead of figs, the usual fruits of the tale-type, the main character uses grapes to cause the condition.

====Italy====
A scholarly inquiry by Italian &quot;Istituto centrale per i beni sonori ed audiovisivi&quot; (&quot;Central Institute of Sound and Audiovisual Heritage&quot;), produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s, found fourteen variants of the tale across Italian sources. Studies suggest the distribution of the tale through Italy may have originated from a 17th-century translation of the German novel by abbot Pompeo Sarnelli.

Sicilian folklorist Giuseppe Pitrè collected a Sicilian variant named &quot;La vurza, lo firriolu e lu cornu &#x27;nfatatu&quot; (&quot;The purse, the cloak and the enchanted horn&quot;). In his commentaries, he also listed two short variants, and commented on similar tales found in the works of fellow folklorists Laura Gonzenbach and Vittorio Imbriani. The Sicilian version was later translated to German by Waldemar Kaden as &quot;Beutel, Mäntelchen und Wunderhorn&quot; and included in Fiabe italiane by Italo Calvino as tale nr. 189. &quot;La Reginetta cornuta&quot; (&quot;The Princess with horns&quot;).

Giuseppe Pitrè collected a second Sicilian variant named &quot;Petru, lu Massariotu&quot;, in which a poor man gambles with the princess the magical items he received, loses them and gets thrown in prison, where he learns from the other prisoners the tricks of the cheating princess. He also collected a Tuscan variant named &quot;Soldatino&quot;, with notes to other existing Italian and European versions.

Laura Gonzenbach, folklorist of Swiss origin, collected two Sicilian versions of the tale: &quot;Die Geschichte von Ciccu&quot; (&quot;The Story of Ciccu&quot;) and &quot;Von dem Schäfer, der die Königstochter zum Lachen brachte&quot;.

Thomas Frederick Crane published another version, &quot;The Shepherd Who Made the King&#x27;s Daughter Laugh&quot;, which he translated from Laura Gonzenbach&#x27;s book of Italian folktales (compiled originally in German).

Angelo de Gubernatis commented on a nameless narrative, in &quot;Zoological Mythology&quot;, which was collected in Osimo. Instead of the figs that grow horns, they grow a tail on the deceiving princess. At the end of the tale, the poor brother regains the magical items the princess stole, but he does not heal the princess.

Gherardo Nerucci collected a Montalese variant, titled &quot;I fichi brogiotti&quot;, where there are three poor brothers who sleep in the woods and dream of the fabled objects. When they wake up, an old man gifts each brother the respective item they saw in their dreams.

Carolina Coronedi-Berti wrote down a variant from Bologna (&quot;La fola del Nan&quot;), and compared it to Gonzenbach&#x27;s and Imbriani&#x27;s versions.

Scholar Jack Zipes classifies Venetian tale &quot;Der arme Fischerknabe&quot; (&quot;The poor fisherman&#x27;s son&quot;) as pertaining to the ATU 566 tale type: poor Almerigo witnesses a quarrel in the forest about an invisibility cloak, the never-emptying purse and a pair of fast travelling shoes.

Heinrich Zschalig collected a tale from Capri (&quot;Pfeife, Geldbeutel und Feder&quot;), where the magic objects (pipe, purse and feather) are inherited by three brothers and it is the &quot;king&quot; who steals the items.

A version from Livorno, &quot;Il fico boddone&quot;, related to the plot of &quot;Frutta che fanno crescere il naso&quot; (English: &quot;Fruits that make the nose grow&quot;), is reported to have been collected, but otherwise remains inedited.

A variant from Trentino (&quot;La Regina dalla coda&quot;) was collected by Nepomuceno Bolignini: there are two brothers who receive the magic purse and a cloak of invisibility.

In another variant from Mallorca, &quot;Sa Cadeneta&quot; (&quot;Das Kettchen&quot;), is singular in that the peasant brother uses the fruits (pears and figs) &quot;before&quot; the count&#x27;s daughter (the princess-like character in this variant) steals the magical items. Actually, there is no stealing in this version: the brother uses the items to impress the count and ask for his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage.

====Greece====
Johann Georg von Hahn collected a tale from Zagori, in Epirus, Greece (&quot;Von den Feigen, die Hörner erzeugen und Hörner vertreiben&quot;), and compared the characters in the tale to a Servian variant and a Romanian one.

With the belt and the purse, one of the king&#x27;s sons travels to a princess&#x27;s bedchambers. She manages to trick him into giving her the objects. Later, he returns with the horn, which the princess also manages to take from him. After he is expelled from the palace, the tsar&#x27;s son finds a tree with nose-enlarging fuits.

====Estonia====
Andrew Lang collected an Estonian variant, titled &quot;Tiidu the Piper&quot;, in &quot;The Crimson Fairy Book&quot;. The story tells of a piper who, at a later point in the tale, gets stranded on an island after a shipwreck and eats the nose-enlarging fruits. A previous English version (1895) was published as &quot;Tiidu, the Flute-Player&quot; by William Forsell Kirby, which had even noted the effects of the Nose-tree fruits. The tale was first published by Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald in &quot;Ehstnische Mährchen&quot; (1869), named &quot;Dudelsack-Tiddu&quot;.

====Norway====
A variant named &quot;The Magic Apples&quot; was collected by Klara Stroebe. In this variant, the protagonist just happens to previously own a self-setting tablecloth, the purse and a wishing cap.

Ornul Hodne, in his 1984 publication of Norwegian folktales, classified &quot;Underepla&quot; as ATU 566.

====Armenia====
Author Frédéric Macler translated into French an Armenian variant titled &quot;La belle de Tiflis&quot;, further translated into English as by folklorist Lucy Garnett as &quot;The Princess of Tiflis&quot;, and A. G. Seklemian as &quot;The World&#x27;s Beauty&quot;. In this tale, the hero is the son of a rich merchant and is instructed never to reveal the secret of the family&#x27;s wealth: the magical purse.

In another Armenian tale, &quot;The Peasant&#x27;s Son and the King&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, a peasant rescues the son of the King of Snakes (a snake) and is gifted a fez, a fife and a tobacco pouch. The peasant dies and his son inherits the objects. When he uses them for the first time, the fez grants invisibility, the fife summons an army and the tobacco pouch always replenishes itself with money. The King&#x27;s daughter steals the items, but the hero wins them back with white and red grapes that transform one into a buffalo.

====Tatar people====
In a tale from the Tatar people titled &quot;Младший сын&quot; (&quot;The Youngest Son&quot;), a father, on his deathbed, asks his three sons - the youngest considered a fool - to hold a vigil on his grave for three nights, one son on each night. The eldest son goes first and his father&#x27;s spirit gives him a cloak of invisibility. Next, the middle son gets a cow horn that summons an army, and the youngest a magic purse. Later, the local padishah announces a challenge: anyone is to have a contest in measuring fortunes with him, and he who proves he is richer than the padishah, shall marry his daughter. The youngest son goes to the padishah&#x27;s palace with the magic purse and produces an infinite amount of coins. The youngest son marries the padishah&#x27;s daughter, who dislikes her husband and, out of curiosity, asks him the secret of the purse. The youngest naïvely answers her, and she plots with some guards to steal the purse, beat the man and expel him from the palace. It happens thus. The youngest brother asks the middle one to borrow the army-summoning horn to get his revenge on his wife. She also steals the horn. Lastly, he borrows the cloak of invisibility and sneaks into the castle, but he also loses the cloak. After the third time, the padishah&#x27;s daughter orders her husband to be abandoned in some remote remote island. The man is left to die on an island, and finds three trees: one whose fruits make one beautiful, another whose fruits make expensive clothes appear, and a third whose fruits make large horns appear on the head. By listening to two birds, he learns of a fourth tree whose fruits make the horns disappear. The birds also talk about how the leaves of the fourth tree have buoying properties. The man gathers the fruits and uses the leaves to cross the sea back to his wife, so he can use the fruits on her.

Author James Riordan translated another Tatar tale with the title &quot;The Tale of the Three Talismans&quot;. In this tale, a poor father lives in an aul by the margins of Lake Baikal with his three starving sons. One day, he takes a hunting gun to shoot some game. He sights a strange, large bird by a tree. The bird begs the man to be spared and gives him a magic cloth that produces food. Some time later, the khan stops by their hunt on a hunt and asks for food. The man waves the cloth and produces a feast before the khan. The khan returns to his palace and learns he has to host foreign envoys, so he sends for the same peasant man that prepared the feast before him. The peasant man sends his son Osman in his stead with the magic cloth. After the feast, the khan plans to discover the peasant&#x27;s secret, and goads him into marrying his daughter, princess Isharad. The princess marries Osman and he shows her he cloth. She steals the object for her father, and the khan orders Osman to be locked in prison. Back to the peasant, he goes to hunt again, meets the same bird and is given a magic purse that produces golden coins. He loans the purse to his second son Mustafa, who goes to the khan&#x27;s court to finance a new palace for him. Mustafa also marries princess Isharad, who steals the purse for her father. Lastly, the peasant meets the bird a third time and is given a golden arrow that always lands on its target. The peasant gives it to his youngest son, named Taz-Oglan, who uses the golden arrow to defeat an enemy army and marries Isharad. Once again, the princess learns the secret of her husband and steals the object for her father. Taz-Oglan, in desperation, flees his spouse&#x27;s palace into the forest. There, he eats any type of berries and fruits, including ripe figs that make horns grow on his head. By using leaves from a bush, the horns fall off. With his newfound knowledge, Taz-Oglan goes back to the khan, punishes him and the princess, releases his brothers from prison and becomes the new khan.

He journeys alone and meets three giants-emegen quarreling about their inheritance, three magical objects: a wagon that takes the user where he wishes to go, a cap of invisibility, and a &quot;sakis&quot;, a type of chewing gum that, when spat out, produces gold. The youth tricks the giants and steals the objects, then goes to a royal city. He sees the city&#x27;s beautiful princess from a distance, and falls in love with her. Because she has been kept hidden from the world, many would pay to see her. The youth then spits out gold with the sakis and pays some maidservants to be allowed access to the princess. They enjoy each other&#x27;s company, but the princess gets him drunk and he reveals the secret of his fortune: the sakis. She steals the sakis and tosses the youth out of the city with the wagon and the hat. Eventually, she repeats her trick and steals the remaining objects from him. He decides to leave the city and finds work with some stupid giants. He helps them in harvesting their grains and is allowed to eat some fruits from their orchard: pears, carobs and apples.

<text>Thomas Wayne Hancock III (born May 1, 1965, in Dallas, Texas) better known as Wayne &quot;The Train&quot; Hancock, is an American singer-songwriter. Known as &quot;The King of Juke Joint Swing,&quot; his performances incorporate jazz, blues, western swing, country and rockabilly, styles of music that he began listening to as a kid. His influences include Jimmie Rodgers, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Hank Thompson, Hank Williams and Hank Snow because they were all in his parents&#x27; record collection.

Throughout his childhood, Hancock moved around seven times because his father was a Design engineer who worked at various engineering firms around the United States. Shortly after discovering country music, Hancock began writing songs at the age of twelve. Hancock&#x27;s vocal style was initially influenced by Hank Williams, and he has been compared to him throughout his career.

At eighteen years old, Hancock won the Wrangler Country Showdown contest. The son of a WWII veteran, Hancock joined the United States Marine Corps immediately after winning the contest and was shipped to recruit training. Hancock served in the military for four years. During a six-month deployment at Camp Hansen in Okinawa, Japan, he wrote one of his most well known songs, &quot;Cold Lonesome Wind&quot; from &quot;Thunderstorms and Neon Signs&quot;.

In 1990, Hancock moved to Austin, Texas. In 1994, he met Lubbock, Texas native Joe Ely, a member of the Flatlanders at the Continental Club in, Austin, Texas. Shortly thereafter, Hancock landed a role in Terry Allen and Jo Harvey Allen&#x27;s play, Chippy. Jimmie Dale Gilmore of the Flatlanders originally played Hancock&#x27;s character Mr. Jukebox. When Gilmore was unable to do the second run of the play, Ely brought Hancock in, saying &quot;This guy sounds just like Hank Williams, he&#x27;d be perfect.&quot; From there, Hancock joined the cast and went into the studio to record &quot;Thunderstorms and Neon Signs,&quot; for the soundtrack. It was his first recording of the song.

Hancock met Grammy Award winning producer, pedal steel player, and Lubbock, Texas native, Lloyd Maines when Maines was running sound for Chippy. Maines has produced all of Hancock&#x27;s albums, dating back to his 1995 debut, &quot;Thunderstorms and Neon Signs&quot;, released on Deja Disc Records. The album sold 22,000 copies in the first year. The follow-up was Hancock&#x27;s sophomore 1997 album, &quot;That&#x27;s What Daddy Wants&quot; released on Ark 21. Hancock gained the nickname The Train because of his marathon length shows, going on for 3, 4, even 5 hours long.&quot;

On his debut 1999 album, &quot;Risin&#x27; Outlaw&quot;, Hank Williams III, grandson of Hank Williams Sr., covered two songs from &quot;Thunderstorms and Neon Signs&quot;, the title track, and &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Leave Me Alone.&quot; He also recorded &quot;87 Southbound,&quot; from &quot;That&#x27;s What Daddy Wants&quot;.

In April 2014, Hancock was involved in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him with a fractured elbow and a collapsed lung. He was forced to cancel several months&#x27; worth of tour dates due to the wreck, but by the end of the year he was fully recovered and back on the road. In 2016, Hancock returned to the studio with producer Lloyd Maines to cut his eighth studio album Slingin&#x27; Rhythm.

<doc id="898727" wikidata="Q18615" url="?curid=898727" title="Still Life (Opeth album)">
<text>Still Life is the fourth studio album by Swedish progressive metal band Opeth. It was produced and engineered by Opeth alongside Fredrik Nordström, and released on 18 October 1999 through Peaceville Records. It was the only Opeth album to be released through Peaceville, following the band&#x27;s departure from Candlelight and Century Black after the release of &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot;, and the first album to feature Martin Mendez.

==Background==
=== Concept ===
Like its predecessor, &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot;, &quot;Still Life&quot; is a concept album. Frontman Mikael Åkerfeldt explains: &quot;&quot;Still Life&quot; was not Satanic but an anti-Christian theme. It sounds pretty naive when I explain it like this. It kind of takes place a long time ago when Christianity had a bigger importance than it has today. The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn&#x27;t got the same faith as the rest of the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old &#x27;babe&#x27;. Obviously a lot of bad things start happening with, as I call it on the album, &#x27;the council.&#x27; The big bosses of the town know that he&#x27;s back. A lot of bad things start happening. They see him as a hypocrite in a way. It&#x27;s almost like a devil&#x27;s advocate or whatever it&#x27;s called.&quot; The album then proceeds to portray Melinda&#x27;s proclamation of love towards the protagonist. These events lead to her murder and the main character going on a rampage against the ones responsible. The last song of the record, &quot;White Cluster&quot; concludes the story with his execution and him meeting Melinda in the afterlife.

===Preparation===
Due to time constraints, the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio. Delays with the album&#x27;s artwork pushed the release back an additional month, and the album was released in Europe under the Peaceville/Snapper label on 18 October 1999. Due to problems with the band&#x27;s new distribution network, the album was not released in American stores until 27 February 2001.

&quot;Still Life&quot; was the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover besides the band logo upon its initial release.

===Style===
Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic called &quot;Still Life&quot; a &quot;formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies&quot;.

==Release and reception==
The album was re-released by Peaceville Records in 2000 as a slipcase version and again as a digipak version in 2003. A third re-release came out on 31 March 2008, with reworked album artwork by original artist Travis Smith. This new edition has two discs, the first one being a remastered stereo mix of the album on Audio CD and the second one being an Audio DVD containing a 5.1 surround sound mix. The DVD also contains a live video for the album track &quot;Face of Melinda&quot; from &quot;The Roundhouse Tapes&quot; live performance in London. The remastered and remixed versions of the original recordings were done by Jens Bogren.

===Accolades===
In 2014, TeamRock put &quot;Still Life&quot; at #83 on their &quot;Top 100 Greatest Prog Albums Of All Time&quot; list with Jordan Griffin stating that it is &quot;still regarded by many fans as a career high point, &quot;Still Life&quot;’s deft blend of beauty and brutality was lauded by metal and prog fans. Opeth’s first true classic.&quot;. Loudwire placed the album at #54 on their &quot;Top 90 Hard Rock and Heavy Metal Albums of the 1990s&quot; list commenting that Opeth closed out the 90s with their strongest album yet. In 2021, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1999 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

<doc id="898732" wikidata="Q2403806" url="?curid=898732" title="Tensiometer (surface tension)">
<text>In surface science, a tensiometer is a measuring instrument used to measure the surface tension () of liquids or surfaces. Tensiometers are used in research and development laboratories to determine the surface tension of liquids like coatings, lacquers or adhesives. A further application field of tensiometers is the monitoring of industrial production processes like parts cleaning or electroplating.

==Types==

===Goniometer/Tensiometer===
Surface scientists commonly use an optical goniometer/tensiometer to measure the surface tension and interfacial tension of a liquid using the pendant or sessile drop methods. A drop is produced and captured using a CCD camera. The drop profile is subsequently extracted, and sophisticated software routines then fit the theoretical Young-Laplace equation to the experimental drop profile. The surface tension can then be calculated from the fitted parameters. Unlike other methods, this technique requires only a small amount of liquid making it suitable for measuring interfacial tensions of expensive liquids.

===Du Noüy ring tensiometer===


This type of tensiometer uses a platinum ring which is submersed in a liquid. As the ring is pulled out of the liquid, the force required is precisely measured in order to determine the surface tension of the liquid.

The method is well-established as shown by a number of international standards on it such as ASTM D971. This method is widely used for interfacial tension measurement between two liquids but care should be taken to make sure to keep the platinum ring undeformed.

===Wilhelmy plate tensiometer===
The Wilhelmy plate tensiometer requires a plate to make contact with the liquid surface. It is widely considered the simplest and most accurate method for surface tension measurement. Due to a large wetted length of the platinum plate, the surface tension reading is typically very stable compared to alternative methods. As an additional benefit, the Wilhelmy plate can also be made from paper for disposable use. For interfacial tension measurements, buoyancy of the probe needs to be taken into account which complicates the measurement.

===Du Noüy-Padday method===
This method uses a rod which is lowered into a test liquid. The rod is then pulled out of the liquid and the force required to pull the rod is precisely measured. The method isn&#x27;t standardized but is sometimes used. The Du Noüy-Padday rod pull tensiometer will take measurements quickly and will work with liquids with a wide range of viscosities. Interfacial tensions cannot be measured.

===Bubble pressure tensiometer===
Due to internal attractive forces of a liquid, air bubbles within the liquids are compressed. The resulting pressure (bubble pressure) rises at a decreasing bubble radius. The bubble pressure method makes use of this bubble pressure which is higher than in the surrounding environment (water). A gas stream is pumped into a capillary that is immersed in a fluid. The resulting bubble at the end of the capillary tip continually becomes bigger in surface; thereby, the bubble radius is decreasing.

The pressure rises to a maximum level. At this point the bubble has achieved its smallest radius (the capillary radius) and begins to form a hemisphere. Beyond this point the bubble quickly increases in size and soon bursts, tearing away from the capillary, thereby allowing a new bubble to develop at the capillary tip. It is during this process that a characteristic pressure pattern develops (see picture), which is evaluated for determining the surface tension.

Because of the easy handling and the low cleaning effort of the capillary, bubble pressure tensiometers are a common alternative for monitoring the detergent concentration in cleaning or electroplating processes.

<doc id="898739" wikidata="Q646493" url="?curid=898739" title="Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber">
<text>Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947), is a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court was asked whether imposing capital punishment (the electric chair) a second time, after it failed in an attempt to execute Willie Francis in 1946, constituted a violation of the United States Constitution. The issues raised surrounded the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment, as made applicable to the State of Louisiana via the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In an opinion by Justice Stanley Forman Reed, which three other justices (Chief Justice Vinson and Associate Justices Hugo Black and Robert H. Jackson) joined, and with which Justice Felix Frankfurter concurred, the Court held that re-executing Francis did not constitute double jeopardy or cruel and unusual punishment. Justice Reed wrote,
Our minds rebel against permitting the same sovereignty to punish an accused twice for the same offense. But where the accused successfully seeks review of a conviction, there is no double jeopardy upon a new trial. Even where a state obtains a new trial after conviction because of errors, while an accused may be placed on trial a second time, it is not the sort of hardship to the accused that is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment ... For we see no difference from a constitutional point of view between a new trial for error of law at the instance of the state that results in a death sentence instead of imprisonment for life and an execution that follows a failure of equipment. When an accident, with no suggestion of malevolence, prevents the consummation of a sentence, the state&#x27;s subsequent course in the administration of its criminal law is not affected on that account by any requirement of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. We find no double jeopardy here which can be said to amount to a denial of federal due process in the proposed execution. (Citations omitted).

Dissenting, however, Justice Harold Burton (joined by Justices William O. Douglas, Frank Murphy, and Wiley Rutledge) argued, 
How many deliberate and intentional reapplications of electric current does it take to produce a cruel, unusual and unconstitutional punishment? While five applications would be more cruel and unusual than one, the uniqueness of the present case demonstrates that, today, two separated applications are sufficiently &#x27;cruel and unusual&#x27; to be prohibited. If five attempts would be &#x27;cruel and unusual,&#x27; it would be difficult to draw the line between two, three, four and five. It is not difficult, however, as we here contend, to draw the line between the one continuous application prescribed by statute and any other application of the current. Lack of intent that the first application be less than fatal is not material. The intent of the executioner cannot lessen the torture or excuse the result.

Francis was successfully executed the following year.

Among his best-known works are the Shakespeare Monument in Chicago, the equestrian statue of General Grant in Brooklyn, the &quot;Pietà&quot; at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Manhattan, and the &quot;Pocahontas&quot; statue in Jamestown, Virginia.

==Life and career==
He was born in Paris, the younger son of George Sidney Partridge, Jr. and Helen Derby Catlin. His father was the Paris representative for the New York City department store A.T. Stewart. His mother was a cousin of the painter George Catlin. His brother, Sidney Catlin Partridge, became a bishop of the Episcopal Church.

===Education===

Partridge&#x27;s family returned to New York City in 1868, and enrolled him in Cheshire Academy in Connecticut, followed by Adelphi Academy in Brooklyn. He entered Columbia University in autumn 1881, but had to withdraw because of poor health. He traveled to Europe in 1882, and studied in Florence in the studio of Fortunato Galli, where he became friends with the young Bernard Berenson. Although he never formally enrolled at the Ecole de Beaux-Arts, he audited classes there in autumn 1883, and studied briefly in the Paris studio of sculptor Antonin Mercié. He returned to New York City in Spring 1884, and enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He appeared in a New York City production of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, and moved to Boston, where he supported himself by giving dramatic readings of Shakespeare and the Romantic poets. He continued to sculpt, and received encouragement in this from his cousin, the sculptor John Rogers.

In 1887, he married Augusta Merriam, a wealthy widow from Milton, Massachusetts, who was 15 years older. They traveled to Europe that year, where he studied briefly in the Paris studio of painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau. There he formed a close friendship with the neo-Gothic architect Ralph Adams Cram. The couple moved to Rome, where he studied in the studio of Polish sculptor Pio Welonski. They returned to Milton, Massachusetts in 1889, where he established his own studio.

===Sculptures===


Partridge created two larger-than-life bronze statues of Alexander Hamilton, executed 15 years apart. The first was commissioned by the Hamilton Club of Brooklyn, installed in front of the club&#x27;s headquarters in Brooklyn Heights, and dedicated on October 4, 1893. For months before and after that dedication, Partridge&#x27;s full-size plaster model of &quot;Hamilton&quot; was on exhibition at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The bronze statue stood in Brooklyn until 1936, when it was relocated to The Grange, Hamilton&#x27;s country house in northern Manhattan. The second Hamilton statue was commissioned by the Alumni Association of Columbia College [now University]. It was installed on campus in front of Hamilton Hall, and dedicated on May 27, 1908. Both Hamilton statues stand in northern Manhattan, less than apart.

In 1890, Partridge won a national competition to create a statue of William Shakespeare for Chicago, Illinois. He returned to Paris, where he set up a studio to work on the project. He exhibited his full-size plaster model of &quot;Shakespeare&quot; at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, along with nine other works. His bronze &quot;Shakespeare&quot; was installed in Lincoln Park the following spring, and dedicated on April 23, 1894, the Bard&#x27;s 330th birthday. Partridge wrote a sonnet for its dedication.

The &quot;Equestrian Statue of General Ulysses S. Grant&quot; (1895–1896) was Partridge&#x27;s most colossal work. Commissioned by the Union League Club of Brooklyn, it was installed in the center of Bedford Avenue, in front of the Club&#x27;s headquarters, and dedicated on April 27, 1896. The bronze horse and rider are approximately in height, and stand upon a granite pedestal approximately in height.

A bequest from Englishman James Smithson (–1829) funded the creation of the Smithsonian Institution. Partridge was commissioned in 1896 to create a bronze memorial tablet commemorating that bequest for Smithson&#x27;s gravesite in Genoa, Italy. He based his relief portrait of Smithson on an 1817 relief portrait taken from life by Pierre-Joseph Tiolier (formerly attributed to Antonio Canova). Partridge initially made two casts of the bronze tablet, one for the gravesite and the other for the nearby Protestant Chapel of the Holy Spirit. He made a third bronze cast in 1898 for Smithson&#x27;s alma mater, Pembrook College, University of Oxford. The gravesite&#x27;s bronze tablet was stolen, and the chapel&#x27;s bronze tablet was used as a model for a marble copy, that was installed at the gravesite in 1900. Upon learning that the Genoa cemetery was to be destroyed for the expansion of an adjacent quarry, Alexander Graham Bell, a member of the Smithsonian&#x27;s Board of Regents, proposed that Smithson&#x27;s remains be brought to the United States. In 1904, Smithson&#x27;s remains and grave monument were relocated to the Crypt of the Smithsonian&#x27;s Castle Building in Washington, D.C. The 1900 marble copy of Partridge&#x27;s tablet was part of that move. The Chapel of the Holy Spirit was destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II. A marble copy of Partridge&#x27;s tablet was carved in 1963, and stands today at the site of the chapel.

Partridge&#x27;s most famous religious work is the larger-than-life &quot;Pietà&quot; he created for St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Manhattan. The dead Christ is collapsed before a seated Mary, who cradles his face with her hand. Critic Robert Burns Wilson wrote a sensitive appreciation of the work. Carved from white Carrara marble, &quot;Pietà&quot; is located in the Ambulatory behind the High Altar.

The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities commissioned Partridge to create a larger-than-life bronze statue of Pocahontas, the Native American princess, for the 1907 Jamestown Exposition in Norfolk, Virginia. The exposition commemorated the 300th anniversary of the founding of the first permanent English settlement in the Americas. &quot;Pocahontus&quot; stood in front of the Administration Building for the exposition, and APVA later loaned the statue to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. APVA donated the statue to Jamestown, where it was re-dedicated on June 3, 1922. Queen Elizabeth II visited Jamestown in 1957 for the 350th anniversary, and was charmed by the statue. Her reaction inspired a posthumous replica to be cast, which was presented by the Governor of Virginia as a gift to the British people. Dedicated on October 5, 1958, the bronze replica was installed outside St. George&#x27;s, Gravesend, the English church in which Pocahontas had been interred in 1617.

===Teacher===
Partridge lectured at the National Social Science Association, the Concord School of Philosophy, and the Brooklyn Institute. From 1897 to 1903, he lectured at what is now George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., and went on to lecture at Stanford University in California.

He wrote a manual on sculpting: &quot;Technique of Sculpture&quot; (1895).

Partridge&#x27;s studio was at 15 West 38th Street, Manhattan. Lee Lawrie was among his studio assistants.

===Personal===
Partridge and Augusta Merriam had a daughter together, also named Augusta (d. 1916). The couple divorced in 1904.

On June 14, 1905 he married the poet Margaret Ridgely Schott. They had a daughter together, also named Margaret.

Partridge died in Manhattan, New York City, on May 22, 1930.

<doc id="898743" wikidata="Q47520069" url="?curid=898743" title="Healfdene">
<text>Halfdan (, , Medieval : &quot;half Dane&quot;) was a late 5th and early 6th century legendary Danish king of the Scylding (Skjöldung) lineage, the son of king named Fróði in many accounts, noted mainly as the father to the two kings who succeeded him in the rule of Denmark, kings named Hroðgar and Halga in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; and named Hróar and Helgi in Old Norse accounts.

== Various accounts ==
According to the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Book 2), Halfdan had two brothers named Ro and Skat who also sought the throne. Both were killed by Halfdan. Saxo adds that his brothers&#x27; supporters were hanged and that Halfdan continued to reign with great cruelty, but that he reigned long and died peaceably in extreme old age.

The &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; gives Halfdan (in this work also son of a king named Fróði) a brother named Fridleif and says both were great warriors but that Halfdan was the better of the two. This might have been a lead-in to a feud between the brothers if Snorri had been dealing with Danish matters rather than Swedish matters.

Snorri here only tells us that Halfdan attacked King Aun of Sweden and drove him into exile into Götaland. Halfdan then ruled Sweden for twenty years until he died in Uppsala of sickness and was buried in a mound.

According to &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, a Danish king named Fróði the Bold aided Aun&#x27;s successor Egil against the rebelling thrall Tunni. This may be Froda the Heathobard of &quot;Beowulf&quot; who becomes Fróði the slayer of Halfdan in other Norse traditions which do not make his end peaceful.

In the &quot;Saga of Hrolf Kraki&quot;, this Fróði is Halfdan&#x27;s younger brother but in the Latin epitome to the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; the younger brother, here a half-brother, is named Ingjalldus and this Ingjalldus is later father of a son named Frothi. Since in &quot;Beowulf&quot; Froda is father of a son named Ingeld, it is usually considered that the names have accidentally been interchanged in the tradition behind the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;. In the &quot;Saga of Hrolf Kraki&quot;, Fróði brother of Halfdan is ruler of a separate kingdom. Halfdan was calm and good-natured but Fróði was cruel and vicious. Fróði attacked Halfdan&#x27;s hall by night and burned it. Halfdan was killed in the battle and Fróði took over his country and his widow.

But eventually Halfdan&#x27;s sons in turn killed Fróði to avenge their father&#x27;s death. Thus the tradition in &quot;Beowulf&quot; of a feud between the Danes and Heathobards in which Fróda king of the Heathobards was slain appears in Norse texts as a family feud in which Halfdan&#x27;s brother Fróði kills Halfdan and Halfdan&#x27;s sons kill Fróði.

== Children of Halfdan ==
The poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; mentions Healfdene as follows:

There is obviously something wrong with line 62. A name of a daughter has dropped out, a daughter who was the wife of someone whose name ends in &quot;-ela&quot; and who was a Heatho-Scylfing, a battle-Scylfing. It is likely enough that at some time in copying the poem a scribe was unable to make out the exact spelling of these names and so left the text blank at that point to be fixed up later. It was never fixed up and so the names were lost in later copies.

Surviving Scandinavian texts know nothing about Heorogar though they speak much of the other two sons. Two sources also mention Halfdan&#x27;s daughter. According to the Latin epitome of the &quot;Skjöldung saga&quot;, the sons of Halfdanus are called Roas and Helgo and their sister Sigyna is married to a certain Sevillus. In &quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s Saga&quot;, Halfdan&#x27;s eldest child is his daughter Signy who is married to a certain Jarl Sævil. Then Hróar and Helgi are born.

Friedrich Kluge (1896) accordingly suggested that the line be restored as &quot;hyrde ic þ Sigeneow wæs Sæwelan cwen&quot;, rendering the Norse names in Old English forms. But Kluge has been seldom followed by editors or translators, in part because Sævil in &quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s Saga&quot; is in no way connected with Sweden so far as is told. Since the only certain Swedish (Scylfing) royal name ending in &quot;-ela&quot; that has come down to us is Onela, more often &quot;-ela&quot; is expanded instead to &quot;Onela&quot;. By Old English poetic rules of alliteration the name of the daughter must also begin with a vowel. The choice is usually the name Yrs or Yrse, since Scandinavian tradition speaks much of Yrsa the granddaughter of Halfdan and wife of King Adils of Sweden. This assumes great shifting of names and roles, since Adils is the Eadgils of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the enemy of Onela. Onela appears in Norse texts as Áli. Accordingly, many editors and translators prefer to simply note that the line is corrupt. But modern commentary sometimes refers to the marriage of Onela and Yrsa without indicating that this exists only through somewhat dubious conjectural emendation.

If the tradition of Halfdan/Healfdene being slain by Fróði/Froda is an old one, it might be that the &quot;Beowulf&quot; poet knew that tale and that Heorogar (Healfdene&#x27;s eldest son in &quot;Beowulf&quot;) was imagined Heorogar to have died with Halfdan. Unfortunately the &quot;Beowulf&quot; poet skims over all such matters.

== Other traditions of Harold, Fróði and Halfdan ==
A similar story is told in the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Book 7) of two brother kings named Harold and Fróði in which the envious Fróði has his brother Harold killed by treachery. Harold leaves two sons behind named Harald and Halfdan, and the story of their vengeance on their uncle Fróði for killing their father Harald is almost identical to that found in Norse texts about Hróar and Helgi&#x27;s vengeance on their uncle Fróði for killing their father Halfdan.

The &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; indeed says that some call Halfdan&#x27;s son Ro (that is Róar/Hrothgar) Halfdan instead.

As to this second Halfdan, Saxo has much to say about him, including his slaying of Siward king of Sweden and his battles against Erik son of his uncle Fróði by Signe, this Erik now the rightful king of Sweden. After many battles Halfdan gained the upper hand, Erik was bound with chains and left in a wild place for beasts to consume, and Halfdan became king of both Denmark and Sweden. Saxo relates further warlike exploits. Finally, this Halfdan died childless and left his kingdom to his friend King Ungvin of Götaland (see Geatish kings).

It is likely that more than one Halfdan has been confused with one another and with other kings, not to speak of simple invention by story tellers.

<text>Ernst Benjamin Salomo Raupach (21 May 178418 March 1852) was a German dramatist.

==Biography==
He was born at Straupitz (), near Liegnitz in Silesia, a son of the village pastor. He attended the gymnasium at Liegnitz, and studied theology at the university of Halle. In 1804 he obtained a tutorship in St Petersburg. He preached at times in the German Lutheran church, wrote his first tragedies, and in 1817 was appointed professor of German literature and history at a training college in connection with the university.

Owing to an outburst of jealousy against Germans in Russia, culminating in police supervision, Raupach left St Petersburg in 1822 and undertook a journey to Italy. The literary fruits of his travels were &quot;Hirsemeuzels Briefe aus und über Italien&quot; (Hirsemeuzel&#x27;s Letters from and about Italy, 1823). He next visited Weimar, but, being coldly received by Goethe, abandoned his idea of living there and settled in 1824 in Berlin. Here he spent the remainder of his life, writing for the stage, which for twenty years he greatly influenced, if not wholly controlled, in the Prussian capital. He died in Berlin on 18 March 1852.

==Works==

Raupach wrote both tragedies and comedies; of the former, &quot;Die Fürsten Chawansky&quot; (1818), &quot;Der Liebe Zauberkreis&quot; (1824), &quot;Die Leibeigenen, oder Isidor und Olga&quot; (1826), &quot;Rafaele&quot; (1828), &quot;Der Nibelungenhort&quot; (1834) and &quot;Die Schule des Lebens&quot; (1841), and of the latter &quot;Die Schleichhändler&quot; (1828) and &quot;Der Zeitgeist&quot; (1830) are pieces which enjoyed great popularity.

The historical dramas with which his name is chiefly associated are &quot;Die Hohenstaufen&quot; (1837–38), a cyclus of 15 dramatic pieces founded on Friedrich von Raumer&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der Hohenstaufen&quot;, and the trilogy &quot;Cromwell&quot; (1841–44).

Raupach&#x27;s &quot;Laßt die Todten ruhen&quot; (1823) published in &quot;Minerva&quot; magazine, was an early prose vampire story, which was soon translated into English as &quot;Wake not the Dead&quot; in &quot;Popular Tales and Romances of the Northern Nations&quot; (1823). It was incorrectly attributed to Ludwig Tieck in the English speaking world for many years, despite German scholars consistently identifying Raupach as the author.

Also noteworthy among his early pieces are: &quot;Die Gefesselten&quot; (1821) and &quot;Die Freunde&quot; (1825). Among his comedies may also be mentioned the farces &quot;Denk&#x27; an Cäsar&quot; and &quot;Schelle im Monde&quot;. Among his posthumous works are: &quot;Der Kegelspieler&quot; (1853); &quot;Mulier Taceat in Ecclesia&quot;, a tragi-comedy (1853); and &quot;Saat und Frucht&quot; (1854). The drama &quot;Der Müller und sein Kind&quot; was still on the stage in the early 20th century.

Raupach wrote in all about eighty plays, besides letters and poems. His collected dramas appeared under the title &quot;Dramatische Werke ernster Gattung&quot; (16 vols., 1830–43) and &quot;Dramatische Werke komischer Gattung&quot; (4 vols., 1829–35).

==Evaluation==
The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition attributed the popularity of his comedies and tragedies to their skillful dramatic handling, but thought the historical dramas cited superficial in treatment. The article conceded a great knowledge of theatrical effect and situations to Raupach, but complained that he contorted historical facts in order to foster support for the separation of church and state.

The 1905 New International Encyclopedia thought his writings display great knowledge of stage effect, a talent for the invention of new and interesting situations, and a fine play of verbal wit.

<text>Carlos Juan Finlay (December 3, 1833 – August 20, 1915) was a Cuban epidemiologist recognized as a pioneer in the research of yellow fever, determining that it was transmitted through mosquitoes &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Finlay was born Juan Carlos Finlay y de Barrés in Puerto Príncipe (now Camagüey), Cuba to Scottish-born Dr. Edward (Eduardo) Finlay and French-born Elisa (Isabel) de Barrés.

At that time Cuba was part of the Kingdom of Spain. He reversed the order of his given names to &quot;Carlos Juan&quot; later in his life. His father was a physician who had fought alongside Simón Bolívar, and his family owned a coffee plantation in Alquízar. He attended school in France in 1844, but was forced to return to Cuba after two years because he contracted chorea.

After recovering, he returned to Europe in 1848, but became stuck in England for another two years due to political turmoil, and after arriving in France to continue his education, he contracted typhoid fever and again returned to Cuba.

Because the University of Havana would not recognize his European academic credits, he enrolled at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which did not require prerequisites. Here Finlay met John Kearsley Mitchell, a proponent of the germ theory of disease, and his son Silas Weir Mitchell, who supervised his studies. He graduated from Jefferson Medical College in 1855.

He then returned to Havana and set up an ophthalmology practice in 1857, and then studied in Paris in 1860–61. In October 1865 he married Adela Shine, a native of the Island of Trinidad. They had three sons, Charles, George and Frank Finlay.

=== Professional career ===
Finlay&#x27;s work, carried out during the 1870s, finally came to prominence in 1900. He was the first to theorize, in 1881, that a mosquito was a carrier, now known as a disease vector, of the organism causing yellow fever: a mosquito that bites a victim of the disease could subsequently bite and thereby infect a healthy person.
He presented this theory at the 1881 International Sanitary Conference, where it was not well-received, and in fact made him subject to ridicule and mockery. A year later Finlay identified a mosquito of the genus &quot;Aedes&quot; as the organism transmitting yellow fever. His theory was followed by the recommendation to control the mosquito population as a way to control the spread of the disease.
His hypothesis and exhaustive proofs were confirmed nearly twenty years later by the Walter Reed Commission of 1900. Finlay went on to become the chief health officer of Cuba from 1902 to 1909. Although Reed received much of the credit in history books for &quot;beating&quot; yellow fever, Reed himself credited Finlay with the discovery of the yellow fever vector, and thus how it might be controlled. Reed often cited Finlay&#x27;s papers in his own articles and gave him credit for the discovery in his personal correspondence. 

In the words of General Leonard Wood, a physician and U.S. military governor of Cuba in 1900: &quot;The confirmation of Dr. Finlay&#x27;s doctrine is the greatest step forward made in medical science since Jenner&#x27;s discovery of the vaccination [for smallpox].&quot;

This discovery helped William C. Gorgas reduce the incidence and prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases in Panama during the American campaign, from 1903 onwards, to construct the Panama Canal. Prior to this, about 10% of the workforce had died each year from malaria and yellow fever.

Finlay was a member of Havana&#x27;s Royal Academy of Medical, Physical and Natural Sciences. He was fluent in French, German, Spanish, and English and could read Latin. His interests were widespread and he wrote articles on subjects as varied as leprosy, cholera, gravity, and plant diseases. His main interest, however, was yellow fever, and he was the author of 40 articles on this disease. His theory that an intermediary host was responsible for the spread of the disease was treated with ridicule for years. A humane man, he often took on patients who could not afford medical care. As a result of his work, Finlay was nominated seven times for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, although he was never awarded the prize. He received the National Order of the Legion of Honour of France in 1908.
Finlay died from a stroke, caused by severe brain seizures, at his house in Havana on August 20, 1915.

In 1928, President Gerardo Machado established the National Order of Merit Carlos J. Finlay, rewarding contributions to healthcare and medicine. It is the highest scientific decoration awarded by the Cuban Council of State. The order was discontinued between 1959 and 1981. 

In recognition of his work on Yellow Fever, The American Society of Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene posthumously awarded him the Walter Reed Medal in 1942.

On Cuba Street in downtown Old Havana, the Revolutionary Government in 1962 founded a medical history museum in honor of Carlos J. Finlay. On the wall of the Finlay Medical History Museum in Havana, the inscription states, &quot;History Museum of the Medical Sciences &#x27; Carlos J. Finlay&#x27;, created by the Revolutionary Government in eternal homage to the men who contributed to the advance of the sciences in Cuba. National Commission of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Cuba. Havana, 13 June 1962.&quot;

In the municipality of Marianao, now within the city of Havana, there is a monument in the shape of a syringe, honoring Finlay and usually referred to as &quot;El Obelisco&quot; (&quot;The Obelisk&quot;). Finlay was also commemorated on a 1981 Cuban stamp. A statue commemorating Finlay is located on the bayfront in Panama City, near the canal he helped make possible.

The UNESCO Carlos J. Finlay Prize for Microbiology is named in his honor.

Finlay was honoured with a Google Doodle on December 3, 2013, on the 180th anniversary of his birth. Carlos J. Finlay Military Hospital is named after him. The Finlay Institute for Vaccines (Instituto Finlay de Vacunas, in Spanish), created in 1991, is named after him, as is the exoplanet BD−17 63 b in Cetus. Miami-Dade County Public Schools operates Dr. Carlos J. Finlay Elementary School on the campus of Florida International University, in Westchester, Florida (formerly in the University Park census-designated place).

<text>Ale the Strong (Heimskringla) or &quot;Ole&quot; (English: &quot;Ola&quot;), in Scandinavian legend, belonged to the House of Skjöldung (Scylding), and he was the son of king Friðfróði of Denmark and a cousin of Helgi&#x27;s (and consequently of the Hrothgar of Beowulf). He fought several battles against king Aun of Uppsala, and he ruled in Uppsala for 25 years until he was killed by Starkad the old.

According to Starbäck and Bäckström, Saxo Grammaticus tells a related story in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.

Starkad was accepted with honour in the warband of the Norwegian hero Ole (&quot;Olo&quot;). However, when Ole had succeeded in conquering Zealand, Starkad was convinced to join Lennius/Lenus/Lennus scheme to attack and kill Ole. However, Ole was hard to kill as his gaze scared everyone. It was not until Starkad managed to cover Ole&#x27;s face that he could kill him. Starkad was rewarded with 120 pounds in gold, but regretted his crime, and avenged Ole&#x27;s death by killing Lennius.

<text>The basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) is the second-largest living shark and fish, after the whale shark. It is one of three plankton-eating shark species, along with the whale shark and megamouth shark. Typically, basking sharks reach in length. It is usually greyish-brown, with mottled skin, with the inside of the mouth being white in colour. The caudal fin has a strong lateral keel and a crescent shape. Other common names include bone shark, elephant shark, sailfish, and sunfish. In Orkney, it is called hoe-mother (contracted homer), meaning &quot;the mother of the piked dogfish&quot;.

The basking shark is a cosmopolitan migratory species found in all the world&#x27;s temperate oceans. A slow-moving filter feeder, its common name derives from its habit of feeding at the surface, appearing to be basking in the warmer water there. It has anatomical adaptations for filter-feeding, such as a greatly enlarged mouth and highly developed gill rakers. Its snout is conical, and the gill slits extend around the top and bottom of its head. The gill rakers, dark and bristle-like, are used to catch plankton as water filters through the mouth and over the gills. The teeth are numerous and very small and often number 100 per row. The teeth have a single conical cusp, are curved backwards and are the same on both the upper and lower jaws. This species has the smallest weight-for-weight brain size of any shark, reflecting its relatively passive lifestyle.

Basking sharks have been shown from satellite tracking to overwinter in both continental shelf (less than ) and deeper waters. They may be found in either small shoals or alone. Despite their large size and threatening appearance, basking sharks are not aggressive and are harmless to humans.

The basking shark has long been a commercially important fish as a source of food, shark fin, animal feed, and shark liver oil. Overexploitation has reduced its populations to the point where some have disappeared and others need protection.

==Taxonomy==
The basking shark is the only extant member of the family Cetorhinidae, part of the mackerel shark order Lamniformes. Johan Ernst Gunnerus first described the species as &quot;Cetorhinus maximus&quot;, from a specimen found in Norway, naming it. The genus name &quot;Cetorhinus&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;ketos&quot;, meaning &quot;marine monster&quot; or &quot;whale&quot;, and &quot;rhinos&quot;, meaning &quot;nose&quot;. The species name &quot;maximum&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;greatest&quot;. Following its initial description, more attempts at naming included: &quot;Squalus isodus&quot;, in 1819 by Italian zoologist Saverio Macri (1754–1848); &quot;Squalus elephas&quot;, by Charles Alexandre Lesueur in 1822; &quot;Squalus rashleighanus&quot;, by Jonathan Couch in 1838; &quot;Squalus cetaceus&quot;, by Laurens Theodorus Gronovius in 1854; &quot;Cetorhinus blainvillei&quot; by the Portuguese biologist Felix Antonio de Brito Capello (1828–1879) in 1869; &quot;Selachus pennantii&quot;, by Charles John Cornish in 1885; &quot;Cetorhinus maximus infanuncula&quot;, by Dutch zoologists Antonius Boudewijn Deinse (1885–1965) and Marcus Jan Adriani (1929–1995) in 1953; and &quot;Cetorhinus maximus normani&quot;, by Siccardi in 1961.

=== Evolutionary history ===
The oldest known members of Cetorhinidae are members of the extinct genus &quot;Keasius&quot;, from the middle Eocene of Antarctica, the Eocene of Oregon and possibly the Eocene of Russia. Members of the modern genus &quot;Cetorhinus&quot; appear during the Miocene, with members of the modern species appearing during the Late Miocene. The association of &quot;Pseudocetorhinus&quot; from the Late Triassic of Europe with Cetorhinidae is doubtful.

==Range and habitat==
The basking shark is a coastal-pelagic shark found worldwide in boreal to warm-temperate waters. It lives around the continental shelf and occasionally enters brackish waters. It is found from the surface down to at least . It prefers temperatures of but has been confirmed to cross the much warmer waters at the equator. It is often seen close to land, including in bays with narrow openings. The shark follows plankton concentrations in the water column, so it is often visible at the surface. It characteristically migrates with the seasons.

==Anatomy and appearance==
The basking shark regularly reaches in length with some individuals reaching . The average length of an adult is around weighing about . Historical sightings suggest basking sharks around in length, including three basking sharks estimated at ~40 fod () and a one ~45 fod () were reported between 1884 and 1905, but these visual estimates lack good evidence. A specimen trapped in a herring net in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, in 1851 has been credited as the largest recorded. Its weight has been estimated at . A study looking at the growth and longevity of the basking shark suggested that individuals larger than ~ are unlikely. This is the second-largest extant fish species, after the whale shark.

They possess the typical shark lamniform body plan and have been mistaken for great white sharks. The two species can be easily distinguished by the basking shark&#x27;s cavernous jaw, up to in width, longer and more obvious gill slits that nearly encircle the head and are accompanied by well-developed gill rakers, smaller eyes, much larger overall size and smaller average girth. Great whites possess large, dagger-like teeth; basking shark teeth are much smaller and hooked; only the first three or four rows of the upper jaw and six or seven rows of the lower jaw function. In behaviour, the great white is an active predator of large animals, not a filter feeder.

Other distinctive characteristics include a strongly keeled caudal peduncle, highly textured skin covered in placoid scales and a mucus layer, a pointed snout—distinctly hooked in younger specimens—and a lunate caudal fin. In large individuals, the dorsal fin may flop to one side when above the surface. Colouration is highly variable (and likely dependent on observation conditions and the individual&#x27;s condition): commonly, the colouring is dark brown to black or blue dorsally, fading to a dull white ventrally. The sharks are often noticeably scarred, possibly through encounters with lampreys or cookiecutter sharks. The basking shark&#x27;s liver, which may account for 25% of its body weight, runs the entire length of the abdominal cavity and is thought to play a role in buoyancy regulation and long-term energy storage.

On several occasions, &quot;globster&quot; corpses initially identified by non-scientists as a sea serpents or plesiosaurs have later been identified as likely to be the decomposing carcasses of basking sharks, as in the Stronsay Beast and the &quot;Zuiyo-maru&quot; cases.

==Life history==

Basking sharks do not hibernate and are active year-round. In winter, basking sharks often move to deeper depths, even down to and have been tracked making vertical movements consistent with feeding on overwintering zooplankton.

==Surfacing behaviors==
They are slow-moving sharks (feeding at about ) and do not evade approaching boats (unlike great white sharks). They are not attracted to chum.

The basking shark is large and slow, but it can breach jump entirely out of the water. This behaviour could be an attempt to dislodge parasites or commensals. Such interpretations are speculative, however, and difficult to verify; breaching in large marine animals such as whales and sharks might equally well be intraspecific threat displays of size and strength.

===Migration===
Argos system satellite tagging of 20 basking sharks in 2003 confirmed basking sharks move thousands of kilometres during the summer and winter, seeking the richest zooplankton patches, often along ocean fronts. They shed and renew their gill rakers in an ongoing process, rather than over one short period.

A 2009 study tagged 25 sharks off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and indicated at least some migrate south in the winter. Remaining at depths between for many weeks, the tagged sharks crossed the equator to reach Brazil. One individual spent a month near the mouth of the Amazon River. They may undertake this journey to aid reproduction.

On 23 June 2015, a , basking shark was caught accidentally by a fishing trawler in the Bass strait near Portland, Victoria, in southeast Australia, the first basking shark caught in the region since the 1930s, and only the third reported in the region in 160 years. The whole shark was donated to the Victoria Museum for research, instead of the fins being sold for use in shark fin soup.

While basking sharks are not infrequently seen in the Mediterranean Sea and records exist in the Dardanelles Strait, it is unclear whether they historically reached deeper basins of Sea of Marmara, Black Sea and Azov Sea.

===Social behaviour===

Basking sharks are usually solitary, but during summer months in particular, they aggregate in dense patches of zooplankton, where they engage in social behaviour. They can form sex-segregated shoals, usually in small numbers (three or four), but reportedly up to 100 individuals. Small schools in the Bay of Fundy and the Hebrides have been seen swimming nose to tail in circles; their social behaviour in summer months has been studied and is thought to represent courtship.

===Predators===
Basking sharks have few predators. White sharks have been reported to scavenge on the remains of these sharks. Killer whales have been observed feeding on basking sharks off California in the US and New Zealand. Lampreys are often seen attached to them, although they are unlikely to be able to cut through the shark&#x27;s thick skin.

===Diet===

The basking shark is a ram feeder, filtering zooplankton, very small fish, and invertebrates from the water with its gill rakers by swimming forwards with its mouth open. A basking shark has been calculated to filter up to of water per hour swimming at an observed speed of . Basking sharks are not indiscriminate feeders on zooplankton. Samples taken in the presence of feeding individuals recorded zooplankton densities 75% higher than adjacent non-feeding areas. Basking sharks feed preferentially in zooplankton patches dominated by small planktonic crustaceans called calanoid copepods (on average 1,700 individuals per cubic metre of water). They will also feed on copepods of the genera &quot;Pseudocalanus&quot; and &quot;Oithona&quot;. Basking sharks sometimes congregate in groups of up to 1,400 spotted along the northeastern U.S. Samples taken near feeding sharks contained 2.5 times as many &quot;Calanus helgolandicus&quot; individuals per cubic metre, which were also found to be 50% longer. Unlike the megamouth shark and whale shark, the basking shark relies only on the water it pushes through its gills by swimming; the megamouth shark and whale shark can suck or pump water through their gills.

===Reproduction===
Basking sharks are ovoviviparous: the developing embryos first rely on a yolk sac, with no placental connection. Their seemingly useless teeth may play a role before birth in helping them feed on the mother&#x27;s unfertilized ova (a behaviour known as oophagy). In females, only the right ovary appears to function, and it is currently unknown why only one of the organs seems to function.

Gestation is thought to span over a year (perhaps two to three years), with a small, though unknown, number of young born fully developed at . Only one pregnant female is known to have been caught; she was carrying six unborn young.
Mating is thought to occur in early summer, and birthing in late summer, following the female&#x27;s movement into shallow waters.

The age of maturity is thought to be between the ages of six and 13 and at a length of . Breeding frequency is thought to be two to four years.

The exact lifespan of the basking shark is unknown, but experts estimate it to be about 50 years.

==Conservation==
Aside from direct catches, by-catches in trawl nets have been one of several threats to basking sharks. In New Zealand, basking sharks had been abundant historically; however, after the mass by-catches recorded in the 1990s and 2000s, confirmations of the species became very scarce. Management plans have been declared to promote effective conservation. In June 2018 the Department of Conservation classified the basking shark as &quot;Threatened - Nationally Vulnerable&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

The eastern north Pacific Ocean population is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service species of concern, one of those species about which the U.S. Government&#x27;s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).

The IUCN Red List indicates this as an endangered species.

The endangered aspect of this shark was publicized in 2005 with a postage stamp issued by Guernsey Post.

==Importance to humans==
Historically, the basking shark has been a staple of fisheries because of its slow swimming speed, placid nature, and previously abundant numbers. Commercially, it was put to many uses: the flesh for food and fishmeal, the hide for leather, and its large liver (which has a high squalene content) for oil. It is currently fished mainly for its fins (for shark fin soup). Parts (such as cartilage) are also used in traditional Chinese medicine and as an aphrodisiac in Japan, further adding to demand.

As a result of rapidly declining numbers, the basking shark has been protected in some territorial waters and trade in its products is restricted in many countries under CITES. Among others, it is fully protected in the United Kingdom and the Atlantic and Mexican Gulf regions of the United States. Since 2008, it has been illegal to fish for, or retain if accidentally caught, basking sharks in waters of the European Union. It is partially protected in Norway and New Zealand, as targeted commercial fishing is illegal, but accidental bycatch can be used (in Norway, any basking shark caught as bycatch and still alive must be released). As of March 2010, it was also listed under Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks Memorandum of Understanding.

Once considered a nuisance along the Canadian Pacific coast, basking sharks were the target of a government eradication programme from 1945 to 1970. , efforts were underway to determine whether any sharks still lived in the area and monitor their potential recovery.

It is tolerant of boats and divers approaching it and may even circle divers, making it an important draw for dive tourism in areas where it is common.

<text>Halga, &quot;Helgi&quot;, &quot;Helghe&quot; or &quot;Helgo&quot; was a legendary Danish king living in the early 6th century. His name would in his own language (Proto-Norse) have been *&quot;Hailaga&quot; (dedicated to the gods). 

Scholars generally agree that he appears in both Anglo-Saxon (&quot;Beowulf&quot;) and Scandinavian tradition (Norse sagas and Danish chronicles). In both traditions, he was a Scylding, the son of Healfdene and the brother of Hroðgar. In &quot;Beowulf&quot;, his relationship to Hroðulf is not explained, but if he was not his father, as in the Scandinavian tradition, he was at least his uncle. Both traditions also mention his family&#x27;s feud with Froda and Ingeld. 

Whereas, not much is said about Halga in Anglo-Saxon sources, much more is said in Scandinavian ones. It is also noticed a curb in Halga storyline&#x27;s direction, all of them containing a version of the story of his incestuous relationship with his own daughter Yrsa. This liaison resulted in Halga&#x27;s son Hroðulf.

==&quot;Beowulf&quot;==
In the Anglo-Saxon epic &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Halga is hardly mentioned. He appears early in the poem where he is listed as the brave Halga, one of the four children of Healfdene, the others being Heorogar, Hroðgar and a daughter (who is unnamed, but called Signý in Norse sources) who was married to the king of Sweden. 

  Ðæm feower bearn    forðgerimed&lt;br&gt;
  in worold wocun    weoroda ræswa&lt;br&gt;
  heorogar. 7 hroðgar    7 halga til&lt;br&gt;
  hyrde ic þ    elan cwen&lt;br&gt;
  heaðo-Scilfingas    healsgebedda
This appears in Gummere&#x27;s translation as:
  Then, one after one, there woke to him,&lt;br&gt;
  to the chieftain of clansmen, children four:&lt;br&gt;
  Heorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave;&lt;br&gt;
  and I heard that — ela&#x27;s queen,&lt;br&gt;
  the Heathoscylfing’s helpmate dear.

Hroðulf (Hrólfr Kraki) is only mentioned as Hroðgar&#x27;s nephew, whereas he is specified as Halga&#x27;s son in Norse sources.

==&quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;==
The &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; (and the included &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;) tells that Haldan (Healfdene) had two sons, Helghe and Ro (Hroðgar). When Haldan died of old age, Helghe and Ro divided the kingdom so that Ro ruled the land, and Helghe the sea. One day, Helghe arrived in Halland/Lolland and slept with Thore, the daughter of one of Ro&#x27;s farmers. This resulted in a daughter named Yrse. Much later, he met Yrse, and without knowing that she was his daughter, he made her pregnant with Hrólfr Kraki (Hroðulf). Helghe later warred in Wendland and killed the king of the Wends. He also won all of Denmark by killing a Hodbrod. Lastly, he found out that Yrse, with whom he had slept, was his own daughter, went east and killed himself.

Both Helghe and Ro being dead, the Swedish king Hakon/Athisl (i.e. Eadgils) forced the Danes to accept a dog as king. The dog king was succeeded by Hrolf Kraki.

==&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==
If the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; reports that the Swedes humiliated the Danes after Helghe&#x27;s death, Saxo Grammaticus mentions nothing of this, but instead he has Helgo humiliate the Swedes in his &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, book 2. He also confused, or merged, Helgo with Helgi Hundingsbane, who in other sources is either a Völsung or a Geatish Wulfing (Ylfing). It is possible that it was the information that both killed a Hothbrodd and were called Helgi that inspired the merger.

Saxo agrees with &quot;Beowulf&quot; and the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; by describing Helgo and Ro (Hroðgar) as the sons of Haldanus (Healfdene). Like the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, he relates that Ro and Helgo shared the kingdom after Haldanus&#x27; death (of old age), Ro taking the land, and Helgo the sea. Saxo adds that Helgo was a rather tall man.

Helgo attacked and killed king Skalk of &quot;Sklavia&quot; (i.e. the king of Wendland), subduing Sklavia into a Danish province. Continuing his sea roving, Helgo arrived at Thurø, where he found and raped the young girl Thora, which resulted in Urse. 

He earned the name &quot;Hundingsbane&quot; by slaying Hunding, the king of Saxony, and conquered Jutland from the Saxons and entrusted it to his commanders Heske, Eyr and Ler. He then humiliated the Saxon aristocracy by enacting a law that the killing of one of them would be no more costly in wergild than the killing of a commoner. 

When Helgo after many years returned to Thurø, Thora avenged her lost virginity by sending Urse to Helgo, who unknowingly raped his own daughter. This resulted in Roluo Kraki (i.e. Hroðulf).

Whereas the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and the &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot; do not explain why Halga needed to kill Hodbrod to win all of Denmark, the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; presents Hothbrodd as a king of Sweden, who invaded Denmark and killed Ro. After having killed Hothbrodd, avenging the death of his brother, he humiliated the Swedes by forbidding that any crime against a Swede should result in any punishment by law. Then, hating his own country, he went east and died, reputedly by throwing himself onto his own sword. He was succeeded by his son Roluo.
==&quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;==
In &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, Halfdan (Healfdene) had three children, the sons Helgi and Hróarr (Hroðgar) and the daughter Signý. The sister was the eldest and married to Sævil Jarl, with whom she had the son Hrókr. Halfdan was murdered by his own brother Fróði (Froda) and the two brothers had to seek refuge with a man called Vivil on an island, until they could avenge their father and kill Fróði.

Hróarr moved to Northumbria and married king Norðri&#x27;s daughter Ögn, whereas Helgi became the new king of Denmark, but stayed unmarried. Wanting a spouse, Helgi went to the Saxons to woo their warlike queen Oluf. She was, however, not interested and humiliated Helgi by shaving his head and covering him with tar while he was asleep, and sending him back to his ship. Some time later, Helgi returned and through a ruse, he kidnapped the queen for a while during which time he got her pregnant.

Having returned to her kingdom, the queen bore a child, a girl whom she named Yrsa after her dog. Yrsa was set to live as a shepherd until she was 12 years old, when she met her father Helgi, who fell in love with her, not knowing it was his daughter. Oluf kept quiet about the parentage and saw it as her revenge that Helgi would wed his own daughter. Helgi and Yrsa had a son, Hrólfr Kraki (Hroðulf).

For his share of the kingdom, Hróarr had been given a precious ring, an heirloom. There was, however, a second relative who wanted his share, their nephew Hrókr. Since Hrókr was given neither a part of the kingdom nor the ring, he went to Northumbria, killed Hróarr and threw the ring into the water (later retrieved by Hróarr&#x27;s son Agnar). Helgi avenged his brother by cutting off Hrókr&#x27;s arms and legs.

Learning that Helgi and Yrsa were living happily together, Queen Oluf travelled to Denmark to tell her daughter the truth. Yrsa was shocked and although Helgi wanted their relationship to remain as it was, Yrsa insisted on leaving him. She was later taken by the Swedish king Aðils (Eadgils) as his queen, which made Helgi even more unhappy.

Later, one Yule, Helgi was visited by an ugly being while he was in his hunting house. No person in the entire kingdom would allow the being to enter their house, except Helgi. Later, the thing asked to sleep in his bed. Unwillingly he agreed, and as the thing got into bed, it turned into an elvish woman, who was clad in silk and who was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He raped her, and made her pregnant with a daughter named Skuld. Helgi forgot the woman and a couple of days after the date had passed, he was visited by the woman, who had Skuld in her arms. The daughter would later marry Hjörvarðr (Heoroweard), Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s killer. 

Missing Yrsa, Helgi went to Uppsala to fetch her, but was killed by Aðils in battle. He was succeeded by his son Hrólfr.

==&quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot;==
The &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot; relate that Halfdan (Healfdene) and his queen Sigrith had three children: the sons Roas (Hroðgar) and Helgo and the daughter Signy.

Ingjaldus (i.e. Ingeld, but here he is presented as Halfdan&#x27;s half-brother) attacked Halfdan, killed him and married Sigrith. Ingjaldus and Sigrith had the sons Rærecus and Frodo (Froda), while Signy grew up with her mother until she was married to Sævil, the jarl of Zealand. Roas and Helgo survived by hiding on an island near Skåne, and when they were old enough, they avenged their father by killing Ingjaldus.

The two brothers both became kings of Denmark, and Roas married the daughter of the king of England. Helgo, on the other hand, raped Olava, the queen of the Saxons, and she bore a daughter named Yrsa. The girl later married king Adillus (Eadgils), the king of Sweden. Some years later, Helgo attacked Sweden and captured Yrsa, whom he raped. His daughter bore him the son Rolfo (Hroðulf). After a few years, Yrsa&#x27;s mother, Queen Olava, came to visit her and told her that Helgo was her own father. Yrsa returned to Adillus, leaving her son behind. Helgo died when Rolfo was eight years old, and Rolfo succeeded him. Not much later, Roas was killed by his half-brothers Rærecus and Frodo, whereupon Rolfo became the sole king of Denmark.

==&quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;==
In Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, a part of the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, he mentions the tradition of Halga, Eadgils and Yrsa, and he based his account on the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; (he had access to the now lost original version).

He wrote that king Halfdan&#x27;s (Healfdene) son Helgi ruled in Lejre. He invaded Sweden with such a large army that king Aðils (Eadgils) could not do anything else but to flee Uppsala. Helgi amassed a great deal of booty and took queen Yrsa (whom Aðils had found in Saxony) with him. Yrsa bore a son named Hrólfr Kraki (Hroðulf). When the boy was three years of age, Yrsa&#x27;s mother, queen Alof of Saxony, came to visit her and told her that her husband Helgi was her own father. Then Yrsa returned to Sweden and king Aðils. Hrólfr Kraki was only eight years old when Helgi died during a war expedition, and Hrólfr was proclaimed his successor.

<text>Anne Beau Cox Chambers (December 1, 1919 – January 31, 2020) was an American media proprietor, diplomat, and philanthropist who served as United States Ambassador to Belgium from 1977 to 1981. She co-owned the family company Cox Enterprises, a privately held media empire, with her sister Barbara Cox Anthony for 33 years. Her net worth was estimated by &quot;Forbes&quot; at $16.1 billion in September 2014.

==Early life==
Cox was born in Dayton, Ohio. She was the daughter of James M. Cox, a newspaper publisher and politician who was the 1920 Democratic Presidential nominee, and his second wife, Margaretta Parker Blair. She attended the Hacienda Del Sol School for Girls in Tucson, Arizona, alongside Woodrow Wilson’s granddaughters. She later attended Miss Porter’s School in Farmington, Connecticut, and Finch College in New York.

==Career==
In 1974, upon the death of their brother, James M. Cox (known as &quot;Jim Jr.&quot;), Chambers and her sister Barbara Cox Anthony gained a controlling interest in the family company. That same year Chambers became chairwoman of Atlanta Newspapers. Anthony became chairwoman of Dayton Newspapers, while her husband, Garner Anthony, became the administrative head of Cox Enterprises, a large media company that includes newspapers, television, radio, cable television, and other businesses. In 1988 Anthony&#x27;s son James Cox Kennedy became chairman and chief executive officer. Henceforth Chambers remained a close advisor concerning the daily operation of the company, serving as a director of it.

Chambers was appointed ambassador to Belgium by U.S. president Jimmy Carter, a post she held from 1977 to 1981. She was a director of the board of The Coca-Cola Company during the 1980s, and she was the first woman in Atlanta to serve as a bank director (Fulton National Bank). She was also the first woman in Atlanta appointed to the board of the city&#x27;s chamber of commerce.

==Philanthropy==
Chambers was a supporter of a wide range of cultural and educational charities, particularly relating to the arts and international affairs. She served on the boards of the Atlanta Botanical Garden, the Atlanta Historical Society, and the Woodruff Arts Center, as well as on the boards of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Pasteur Foundation, and the Whitney Museum in New York. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003. In 1983, she received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Oglethorpe University. Following her service in Belgium, she received the French Legion of Honour award.

===High Museum of Art===
Her work with the High Museum of Art began in 1965 when Chambers helped to establish the Forward Arts Foundation, a fund-raising group for the museum. In the early 1980s Chambers served as honorary chair of the fund-raising effort to construct the museum&#x27;s Richard Meier–designed complex. In October 2006, the High, in collaboration with the Louvre in Paris, France, presented the exhibition &quot;Louvre Atlanta&quot;; the partnership had been facilitated by Chambers.

In 2005, the museum named one of the wings of its expanded facility after Chambers in recognition of her lifetime of support.

==Personal life and death==
Chambers was married to Louis G. Johnson with whom she had two daughters, Katherine and Margaretta. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1955, she married Robert William Chambers, with whom she had a son, James.

Chambers died at her home in Atlanta on January 31, 2020, at the age of 100 due to natural causes. Congressman Carter of Georgia included a note of remembrance in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; on February 11, 2020.

<text>Vidushi R. Vedavalli (born 9 November 1935) is an Indian Carnatic vocalist.

==Early life==
R. Vedavalli was born in Mannargudi, Tamil Nadu, India to Ramaswami Iyengar and Padmasani Ammal.

==Career==
R. Vedavalli&#x27;s talent for music was identified early on by Maurai Srirangam Iyengar, who brought the five-year-old a harmonium, and got her started on vocal lessons. The family moved to Madras in a few years time, and Vedavalli came under the tutelage of Mudicondan Venkatarama Iyer.

She received a Central Government scholarship to specialize in Padams and Javalis with T.Muktha, and in Pallavis with Venkataramana Iyer. Though she has performed since childhood, it was Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar who advised her to turn into a professional musician, when he heard her sing as an 18-year-old. She has travelled throughout India and abroad in North America, South-East Asia, the Far East and the Persian Gulf region, giving concerts and lecture demonstrations.

Vedavalli served in the Teacher&#x27;s College of Music of the Madras Music Academy for several years before becoming Professor of Vocal Music in the Government College of Music Adyar. She has thus shared her deep knowledge and extensive repertoire with numerous students at these institutions apart from training some privately.

She is also trained in playing the veena, and has a good command over Tamil, Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, which helps her sing with greater understanding or &quot;artha bhava&quot; (meaning and emotion). She lived in Chennai with her husband D. R. Santhanam and mother Padmasani Ammal, at the turn of the century. Later she and her husband moved to Pune to be with their daughter, and D R Santhanam died in Pune in July 2021.

==Awards and recognitions==

From a very young age, Vedavalli won several awards in prestigious competitions including All India Radio&#x27;s first prize for Classical Music and Light Classical Music, awarded by the President of India. In 2000, she received the Sangeetha Kalanidhi, which is considered the highest award in Carnatic music. She is one of the few women to have received this honor. She also received the &quot;Sangeetha Kalasikhamani&quot; award given by the Fine Arts Society, Chennai in 1995.

==Disciples==

Among her disciples today are accomplished performers, researchers, teachers and writers. Sumitra Vasudev and her daughter Sushruti Santhanam are her disciples. Sushruti is based in Pune and teaches music there.

<text>Dimensions is a French project that makes educational movies about mathematics, focusing on spatial geometry. It uses POV-Ray to render some of the animations, and the films are released under a Creative Commons licence.
The film is separated in nine chapters, which follow this plot:

* Chapter 1: Dimension two explains Earth&#x27;s coordinate system, and introduces the stereographic projection.
* Chapter 2: Dimension three discusses how two-dimensional beings would imagine three-dimensional objects.
* Chapters 3 and 4: The fourth dimension talks about four-dimensional polytopes (&quot;polychora&quot;), projecting the regular ones stereographically on the three-dimensional space.
* Chapters 5 and 6: Complex numbers are about the square root of negative numbers, transformations, and fractals.
* Chapters 7 and 8: Fibration show what a fibration is. Complex numbers are used again, and there are circles and tori rotating and being transformed.
* Chapter 9: Proof emphasizes the importance of proofs in mathematics, and proves the circle-conservationess of the stereographic projection as an example.

They are available for download in several languages.

<text>Barbara Blair Cox Anthony (December 8, 1922 – May 28, 2007) was the youngest daughter of James M. Cox, a Democratic governor of Ohio, newspaper publisher and broadcaster. With her sister Anne Cox Chambers and her brother James M. Cox, Jr., she inherited, via a trust, ownership and control of her father&#x27;s company, now called Cox Enterprises. Upon her brother&#x27;s death in 1974, the sisters received his share of the company equally.

Her net worth was estimated at $12 billion, based principally on her equity interest in Cox Enterprises, which made her one of the richest women in the United States and the richest resident of Hawaii.

She served as a Director of Cox Enterprises, one of the largest diversified media companies in the United States. It owns one of the nation&#x27;s largest cable television businesses, which provides internet and telephone, publishes newspapers including the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; and &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;, owns and operates broadcast television and radio stations and owns Manheim, an automobile auction firm. It also owns stakes in a variety of internet businesses, including AutoTrader.com, the largest retail automotive shopping site in the world. Her son James C. Kennedy is chairman of Cox Enterprises.

Well known in Hawaii for her support of philanthropic causes, Anthony helped found La Pietra: Hawaii School for Girls and served as its chair from 1978 until her death in Honolulu in 2007, aged 85, following an extended illness. She also made contributions to the Veterinary School of Colorado State University, endowing two chairs in equine health.

==Personal life==
Anthony was married four times. She did not have children with her first husband, Bradford Ripley, a naval aviator who died in World War II. She had two children with her second husband, airline executive Stanley C. Kennedy, Jr.: James C. Kennedy, chairman of Cox Enterprises, and Blair Parry-Okeden, Australia&#x27;s richest woman. They later divorced. Her third husband was James W. Glover, a successful contractor; he died a few years after their marriage. Her fourth husband was Garner Anthony, Jr., who preceded his stepson James Kennedy as chairman of Cox Enterprises, serving in that position from 1974 to 1987. As Mrs. Bradford Williams Ripley II, she was the ship&#x27;s sponsor for the aircraft carrier USS Midway (CVB 41) and christened the ship at its launch at Newport News Shipbuilding, Virginia, on March 20, 1945.

<doc id="898781" wikidata="Q1061375" url="?curid=898781" title="Permalloy">
<text>Permalloy is a nickel–iron magnetic alloy, with about 80% nickel and 20% iron content. Invented in 1914 by physicist Gustav Elmen at Bell Telephone Laboratories, it is notable for its very high magnetic permeability, which makes it useful as a magnetic core material in electrical and electronic equipment, and also in magnetic shielding to block magnetic fields. Commercial permalloy alloys typically have relative permeability of around 100,000, compared to several thousand for ordinary steel.

In addition to high permeability, its other magnetic properties are low coercivity, near zero magnetostriction, and significant anisotropic magnetoresistance. The low magnetostriction is critical for industrial applications, allowing it to be used in thin films where variable stresses would otherwise cause a ruinously large variation in magnetic properties. Permalloy&#x27;s electrical resistivity can vary as much as 5% depending on the strength and the direction of an applied magnetic field. Permalloys typically have the face-centered cubic crystal structure with a lattice constant of approximately 0.355 nm in the vicinity of a nickel concentration of 80%. A disadvantage of permalloy is that it is not very ductile or workable, so applications requiring elaborate shapes, such as magnetic shields, are made of other high permeability alloys such as mu metal. Permalloy is used in transformer laminations and magnetic recording heads.

==Development==

Permalloy was initially developed in the early 20th century for inductive compensation of telegraph cables. When the first transatlantic submarine telegraph cables were laid in the 1860s, it was found that the long conductors caused distortion which reduced the maximum signalling speed to only 10–12 words per minute. The right conditions for transmitting signals through cables without distortion were first worked out mathematically in 1885 by Oliver Heaviside. It was proposed by Carl Emil Krarup in 1902 in Denmark that the cable could be compensated by wrapping it with iron wire, increasing the inductance and making it a loaded line to reduce distortion. However, iron did not have high enough permeability to compensate a transatlantic-length cable. After a prolonged search, permalloy was discovered in 1914 by Gustav Elmen of Bell Laboratories, who found it had higher permeability than silicon steel. Later, in 1923, he found its permeability could be greatly enhanced by heat treatment. A wrapping of permalloy tape could reportedly increase the signalling speed of a telegraph cable fourfold.

This method of cable compensation declined in the 1930s, but by World War II many other uses for Permalloy were found in the electronics industry.

==Other compositions==
Other compositions of permalloy are available, designated by a numerical prefix denoting the weight percentage of nickel in the alloy, for example &quot;45 permalloy&quot; means an alloy containing 45% nickel, and 55% iron by weight. &quot;Molybdenum permalloy&quot; is an alloy of 81% nickel, 17% iron and 2% molybdenum. The latter was invented at Bell Labs in 1940. At the time, when used in long distance copper telegraph lines, it allowed a tenfold increase in maximum line working speed. Supermalloy, at 79% Ni, 16% Fe, and 5% Mo, is also well known for its high performance as a &quot;soft&quot; magnetic material, characterized by high permeability and low coercivity.

== Applications ==
Due to its high magnetic permeability and low coercivity, Permalloy is often used in applications that require efficient magnetic field generation and sensing. This nickel-iron magnetic alloy, typically composed of about 80% nickel and 20% iron, exhibits low energy loss, which is beneficial for improving the performance of magnetic sensors, transformers, and inductors. Permalloy is also used in the production of magnetic shielding materials, which help protect electronic equipment from external magnetic interference.

<doc id="898783" wikidata="Q253974" url="?curid=898783" title="Flodoard">
<text>Flodoard of Reims (; 893/4 – 28 March 966) was a Frankish chronicler and priest of the cathedral church of Reims in the West Frankish kingdom during the decades following the dissolution of the Carolingian Empire. His historical writings are major sources for the history of Western Europe, especially France, in the early and mid-tenth century.

==Biography==
The sources for Flodoard&#x27;s life are almost exclusively his own writings. Local tradition holds that he was born at Épernay. He was educated at the cathedral school of Reims which had been established by Archbishop Fulk.

As a young canon of Reims, he gained prominent roles in the administrations of the archbishops Heriveus (900–22) and Seulf (922–25), particularly in the cathedral scriptorium. Following Seulf&#x27;s death in 925, the magnate Herbert II, Count of Vermandois installed his four-year-old son, Hugh, as the new archbishop. Flodoard refused to participate in the boy&#x27;s election, and was stripped of his position and benefices. In 931, Reims was captured from Count Herbert by King Raoul and Duke Hugh the Great, who ejected Hugh and oversaw the election of a new archbishop, Artold. 

Flodoard appears to have regained his charges under Artold&#x27;s leadership. In 936/7, he visited Rome, perhaps on pilgrimage, where he met Pope Leo VII. Herbert recaptured Reims in 940, deposing Artold and reimposing his son Hugh on the see. Flodoard objected to the invasion of the bishopric on canonical grounds; consequently, he was detained by Herbert and once again stripped of his prebends. Between 943 and 946, Flodoard may have been away from Reims with Artold at the court of King Louis IV. In 946, Louis gained control of Reims with the assistance of the East Frankish ruler Otto I. Hugh was again deposed, and Artold was re-ordained. His claim to the see was eventually ratified at the 948 Synod of Ingelheim, which Flodoard attended.

In 951, Flodoard was sent to Otto&#x27;s court at Aachen, where he represented the church of Reims in a property dispute, and he seems to have been involved in the administration of his church&#x27;s property. He retired from his canonical office in 963, aged 70, and died on 28 March 966.

== Works ==
Flodoard wrote three substantial historical works and at least two other minor works. In 922, he began writing a chronicle known today as the &quot;Annals&quot;, which he maintained for most of his career. Flodoard primarily reported major political and military events, focusing on those in West Francia but extending his coverage to the Ottonian empire and Italy. He also regularly recorded miracles and other supernatural phenomena. Flodoard seems generally to have written his annals in a year-by-year fashion, and there is no evidence that he revised his text. The &quot;Annals&quot; constitute one of the tenth century&#x27;s relatively few contemporary chronicles, and the work is the only major West Frankish chronicle to have survived from this time, so Flodoard&#x27;s work has been much valued by modern historians.

Flodoard&#x27;s &quot;History of the Church of Reims&quot; (&quot;Historia Remensis ecclesiae&quot;) is one of the most remarkable productions of the tenth century. This work recounts the history of Reims back to its supposed origins in the time of Romulus and Remus, though it focuses principally on the Christian era up to 948. The work, a celebrated example of the genre of &quot;gesta episcoporum&quot; (&quot;the deeds of bishops&quot;), takes the form of serialized biographies of the church&#x27;s bishops. Flodoard had access to an episcopal archive stretching back to the sixth century, and based much of his history on original documents which he summarized or reproduced extracts from. His summaries of some 450 letters of Archbishop Hincmar have been considered especially valuable.

Flodoard&#x27;s poetical works are of hardly less historical interest. In the 930s he composed an epic poem known as &quot;The Triumphs of Christ&quot; (&quot;De triumphis Christi&quot;), a history of Christianity in nearly 20,000 verses. The poem narrates the victories of Christ, martyrs, saints and popes, drawing on a vast range of earlier historical and hagiographical literature. Flodoard evidently gathered material for the work when he visited Rome in 936/7, and the text is a rare witness to the history of the city and the popes in the early tenth century.

The historian wrote at least two other minor works. One, known today as the &quot;Visions of Flothilde&quot;, records the otherworldly visions of a local girl in the early 940s, a time of great political conflict in Reims. Another work, now lost, is also referred to in the &quot;History of the Church of Reims&quot;: when discussing miracles that had taken place in and around Reims cathedral and were attributed to the Virgin Mary, Flodoard mentioned that he had previously collected these and put them into verse.

Flodoard&#x27;s works were published in full by JP Migne (&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;, vol. 135); the best modern edition of the &quot;Annales&quot; is that edited by Philippe Lauer in 1905. The &quot;History of the Church of Reims&quot; was recently re-edited for the Monumenta Germaniae Historica by Martina Stratmann (1998). There is, however, no modern edition of &quot;The Triumphs of Christ&quot;, which remains best consulted in Migne&#x27;s &quot;Patrologia Latina&quot; edition.

<text>In linear algebra, the quotient of a vector space formula_1 by a subspace formula_2 is a vector space obtained by &quot;collapsing&quot; formula_2 to zero. The space obtained is called a quotient space and is denoted formula_4 (read &quot;formula_1 mod formula_2&quot; or &quot;formula_1 by formula_2&quot;).

== Definition ==
Formally, the construction is as follows. Let formula_1 be a vector space over a field formula_10, and let formula_2 be a subspace of formula_1. We define an equivalence relation formula_13 on formula_1 by stating that formula_15 iff . That is, formula_16 is related to formula_17 if and only if one can be obtained from the other by adding an element of formula_2. This definition implies that any element of formula_2 is related to the zero vector; more precisely, all the vectors in formula_2 get mapped into the equivalence class of the zero vector.

The equivalence class – or, in this case, the coset – of formula_16 is defined as 
:formula_22
and is often denoted using the shorthand formula_23.

The quotient space formula_4 is then defined as formula_25, the set of all equivalence classes induced by formula_13 on formula_1. Scalar multiplication and addition are defined on the equivalence classes by 
*formula_28 for all formula_29, and
*formula_30.
It is not hard to check that these operations are well-defined (i.e. do not depend on the choice of representatives). These operations turn the quotient space formula_4 into a vector space over formula_10 with formula_2 being the zero class, formula_34.

The mapping that associates to the equivalence class formula_35 is known as the quotient map.

Alternatively phrased, the quotient space formula_4 is the set of all affine subsets of formula_1 which are parallel to 

== Examples ==

===Lines in Cartesian Plane===

Let be the standard Cartesian plane, and let &quot;Y&quot; be a line through the origin in &quot;X&quot;. Then the quotient space &quot;X&quot;/&quot;Y&quot; can be identified with the space of all lines in &quot;X&quot; which are parallel to &quot;Y&quot;. That is to say that, the elements of the set &quot;X&quot;/&quot;Y&quot; are lines in &quot;X&quot; parallel to &quot;Y&quot;. Note that the points along any one such line will satisfy the equivalence relation because their difference vectors belong to &quot;Y&quot;. This gives a way to visualize quotient spaces geometrically. (By re-parameterising these lines, the quotient space can more conventionally be represented as the space of all points along a line through the origin that is not parallel to &quot;Y&quot;. Similarly, the quotient space for R3 by a line through the origin can again be represented as the set of all co-parallel lines, or alternatively be represented as the vector space consisting of a plane which only intersects the line at the origin.)

===Subspaces of Cartesian Space===

Another example is the quotient of R&quot;n&quot; by the subspace spanned by the first &quot;m&quot; standard basis vectors. The space R&quot;n&quot; consists of all &quot;n&quot;-tuples of real numbers . The subspace, identified with R&quot;m&quot;, consists of all &quot;n&quot;-tuples such that the last &quot;n&quot; − &quot;m&quot; entries are zero: . Two vectors of R&quot;n&quot; are in the same equivalence class modulo the subspace if and only if they are identical in the last &quot;n&quot; − &quot;m&quot; coordinates. The quotient space R&quot;n&quot;/R&quot;m&quot; is isomorphic to R&quot;n&quot;−&quot;m&quot; in an obvious manner.

===Polynomial Vector Space===

Let formula_38 be the vector space of all cubic polynomials over the real numbers. Then formula_39 is a quotient space, where each element is the set corresponding to polynomials that differ by a quadratic term only. For example, one element of the quotient space is formula_40, while another element of the quotient space is formula_41.

===General Subspaces===

More generally, if &quot;V&quot; is an (internal) direct sum of subspaces &quot;U&quot; and &quot;W,&quot;
:formula_42
then the quotient space &quot;V&quot;/&quot;U&quot; is naturally isomorphic to &quot;W&quot;.

===Lebesgue Integrals===

An important example of a functional quotient space is an L&quot;p&quot; space.

== Properties ==

There is a natural epimorphism from &quot;V&quot; to the quotient space &quot;V&quot;/&quot;U&quot; given by sending &quot;x&quot; to its equivalence class [&quot;x&quot;]. The kernel (or nullspace) of this epimorphism is the subspace &quot;U&quot;. This relationship is neatly summarized by the short exact sequence
:formula_43

If &quot;U&quot; is a subspace of &quot;V&quot;, the dimension of &quot;V&quot;/&quot;U&quot; is called the codimension of &quot;U&quot; in &quot;V&quot;. Since a basis of &quot;V&quot; may be constructed from a basis &quot;A&quot; of &quot;U&quot; and a basis &quot;B&quot; of &quot;V&quot;/&quot;U&quot; by adding a representative of each element of &quot;B&quot; to &quot;A&quot;, the dimension of &quot;V&quot; is the sum of the dimensions of &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot;/&quot;U&quot;. If &quot;V&quot; is finite-dimensional, it follows that the codimension of &quot;U&quot; in &quot;V&quot; is the difference between the dimensions of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;U&quot;:
:formula_44

Let &quot;T&quot; : &quot;V&quot; → &quot;W&quot; be a linear operator. The kernel of &quot;T&quot;, denoted ker(&quot;T&quot;), is the set of all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;V&quot; such that &quot;Tx&quot; = 0. The kernel is a subspace of &quot;V&quot;. The first isomorphism theorem for vector spaces says that the quotient space &quot;V&quot;/ker(&quot;T&quot;) is isomorphic to the image of &quot;V&quot; in &quot;W&quot;. An immediate corollary, for finite-dimensional spaces, is the rank–nullity theorem: the dimension of &quot;V&quot; is equal to the dimension of the kernel (the nullity of &quot;T&quot;) plus the dimension of the image (the rank of &quot;T&quot;).

The cokernel of a linear operator &quot;T&quot; : &quot;V&quot; → &quot;W&quot; is defined to be the quotient space &quot;W&quot;/im(&quot;T&quot;).

== Quotient of a Banach space by a subspace ==
If &quot;X&quot; is a Banach space and &quot;M&quot; is a closed subspace of &quot;X&quot;, then the quotient &quot;X&quot;/&quot;M&quot; is again a Banach space. The quotient space is already endowed with a vector space structure by the construction of the previous section. We define a norm on &quot;X&quot;/&quot;M&quot; by
:formula_45

=== Examples ===
Let &quot;C&quot;[0,1] denote the Banach space of continuous real-valued functions on the interval [0,1] with the sup norm. Denote the subspace of all functions &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;[0,1] with &quot;f&quot;(0) = 0 by &quot;M&quot;. Then the equivalence class of some function &quot;g&quot; is determined by its value at 0, and the quotient space is isomorphic to R.

If &quot;X&quot; is a Hilbert space, then the quotient space &quot;X&quot;/&quot;M&quot; is isomorphic to the orthogonal complement of &quot;M&quot;.

=== Generalization to locally convex spaces ===
The quotient of a locally convex space by a closed subspace is again locally convex. Indeed, suppose that &quot;X&quot; is locally convex so that the topology on &quot;X&quot; is generated by a family of seminorms {&quot;p&quot;α | α ∈ &quot;A&quot;} where &quot;A&quot; is an index set. Let &quot;M&quot; be a closed subspace, and define seminorms &quot;q&quot;α on &quot;X&quot;/&quot;M&quot; by

:formula_46

Then &quot;X&quot;/&quot;M&quot; is a locally convex space, and the topology on it is the quotient topology.

If, furthermore, &quot;X&quot; is metrizable, then so is &quot;X&quot;/&quot;M&quot;. If &quot;X&quot; is a Fréchet space, then so is &quot;X&quot;/&quot;M&quot;.

<doc id="898790" wikidata="Q2309575" url="?curid=898790" title="Inchtuthil">
<text>Inchtuthil is the site of a Roman legionary fortress situated on a natural platform overlooking the north bank of the River Tay southwest of Blairgowrie, Perth and Kinross, Scotland (Roman Caledonia).

It was built in AD 82 or 83 as the advance headquarters for the forces of governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in his campaign against the Caledonian tribes. Positioned at the head of one of the main routes in and out of the Scottish Highlands, it was occupied by Legion XX &quot;Valeria Victrix&quot; and covered a total area of .

Construction of the large fortress would have taken two or three seasons and a temporary camp was built nearby to house and protect the soldiers over the winter. Additional, smaller forts were built further north and south at the mouth of each nearby glen forming what are now referred to as the Glenblocker forts.

The fort at Inchtuthil is thought to be part of the Glenblocker forts, as well as others in Strathmore, such as Cardean and Stracathro, formed a uniform system composed of several elements, the forts and watchtowers on the Roman road of the Gask Ridge, the Glenblockers and the Strathmore forts. Inchtuthil as the largest military base would have functioned as the lynch-pin and the only site large enough to launch an invasion into the Highlands and beyond.

==Layout and garrison==
Unlike other legionary fortresses in Britain, Inchtuthil was not later built over and its layout was still largely preserved when Sir Ian Richmond excavated it between 1952 and 1965. It is therefore notable as the site which provides the only complete plan of a legionary fortress anywhere in the Roman empire. 
Its defences consisted of a turf rampart faced with stone, with an outside ditch and gatehouses on each side, following the standard Roman plan. The legion it accommodated would have numbered 5,400 at full strength, though there would have been additional specialist troops accompanying them.
Facilities included a hospital () that covered , a workshop covering , and 64 barrack buildings. The timber walls of these buildings have been calculated to have had a total perimeter of . A headquarters building containing an aedes where the legion&#x27;s colours and images of the emperor would have been kept has also been identified in the insula in the centre of the fortress. However, it was much smaller than would be expected for a legionary fortress, and must have been of a temporary nature. The large empty insula to its east should have been the site for the Praetorium, the commander&#x27;s house. However, no signs of building foundations for such a large structure were found though the site had been levelled and prepared.

Inchtuthil was only briefly occupied and was evacuated around summer AD 86 and certainly no later than early in AD 87. The reason for this was probably that Legio II &quot;Adiutrix&quot; had been called to Moesia from its base in Deva Victrix (Chester) to deal with a Dacian invasion in 86 and XX &quot;Valeria Victrix&quot; was obliged to move back south to take its place. However recent archaeology has cast some doubt on this, indicating that the fortress may have been in use for considerably longer than previously thought.

==Nail hoard==
During the excavations started by Richmond in the 1950s, a large pit was found in the summer of 1960 containing 875,400 complete iron nails (Square shaft) ranging from plus another 28 (round shaft nails) weighing , together with other iron objects, including cartwheel rims weighing a combined total weight of ten tonnes. The nails and ironwork were found in a pit which was elaborately concealed. They were almost certainly buried by the Roman troops when they dismantled the fortress before departure to deny them to the local tribes.

Many of the nails were sent to museums while some of the hoard was sold to the public and other interested organisations with an offer of 5 shillings for a nail and 25 shillings for a boxed set of five nails. David Colville &amp; Sons (Iron and Steel refiners) was given the task of sorting and storing the nails; the process of sorting, gifting and selling all complete nails was done by 1963, three years after their discovery.

The almost 2000-year-old iron nails from Inchtuthil have been used by atomic scientists to estimate the corrosion effects on barrels of nuclear waste.

<doc id="898792" wikidata="Q996383" url="?curid=898792" title="Euler's equations (rigid body dynamics)">
<text>In classical mechanics, Euler&#x27;s rotation equations are a vectorial quasilinear first-order ordinary differential equation describing the rotation of a rigid body, using a rotating reference frame with angular velocity ω whose axes are fixed to the body. They are named in honour of Leonhard Euler. 

In the absence of applied torques, one obtains the Euler top. When the torques are due to gravity, there are special cases when the motion of the top is integrable.

==Formulation==
Their general vector form is
:formula_1

where &quot;M&quot; is the applied torques and &quot;I&quot; is the inertia matrix.
The vector formula_2 is the angular acceleration. Again, note that all quantities are defined in the rotating reference frame.

In orthogonal principal axes of inertia coordinates the equations become
:formula_3

where &quot;Mk&quot; are the components of the applied torques, &quot;Ik&quot; are the principal moments of inertia and ω&quot;k&quot; are the components of the angular velocity.

==Derivation==
In an inertial frame of reference (subscripted &quot;in&quot;), Euler&#x27;s second law states that the time derivative of the angular momentum L equals the applied torque:
:formula_4
For point particles such that the internal forces are central forces, this may be derived using Newton&#x27;s second law.
For a rigid body, one has the relation between angular momentum and the moment of inertia Iin given as
:formula_5
In the inertial frame, the differential equation is not always helpful in solving for the motion of a general rotating rigid body, as both Iin and ω can change during the motion. One may instead change to a coordinate frame fixed in the rotating body, in which the moment of inertia tensor is constant. Using a reference frame such as that at the center of mass, the frame&#x27;s position drops out of the equations.
In any rotating reference frame, the time derivative must be replaced so that the equation becomes
:formula_6
and so the cross product arises, see time derivative in rotating reference frame.
The vector components of the torque in the inertial and the rotating frames are related by
formula_7
where formula_8 is the rotation tensor (not rotation matrix), an orthogonal tensor related to the angular velocity vector by
formula_9
for any vector u.
Now formula_10 is substituted and the time derivatives are taken in the rotating frame, while realizing that the particle positions and the inertia tensor does not depend on time. This leads to the general vector form of Euler&#x27;s equations which are valid in such a frame
:formula_1
The equations are also derived from Newton&#x27;s laws in the discussion of the resultant torque.

More generally, by the tensor transform rules, any rank-2 tensor formula_12 has a time-derivative formula_13 such that for any vector formula_14, one has formula_15. This yields the Euler&#x27;s equations by plugging in formula_16

===Principal axes form===
When choosing a frame so that its axes are aligned with the principal axes of the inertia tensor, its component matrix is diagonal, which further simplifies calculations. As described in the moment of inertia article, the angular momentum L can then be written
:formula_17
Also in some frames not tied to the body can it be possible to obtain such simple (diagonal tensor) equations for the rate of change of the angular momentum. Then ω must be the angular velocity for rotation of that frames axes instead of the rotation of the body. It is however still required that the chosen axes are still principal axes of inertia. The resulting form of the Euler rotation equations is useful for rotation-symmetric objects that allow some of the principal axes of rotation to be chosen freely.

==Special case solutions==
===Torque-free precessions===
Torque-free precessions are non-trivial solution for the situation where the torque on the right hand side is zero. When I is not constant in the external reference frame (i.e. the body is moving and its inertia tensor is not constantly diagonal) then I cannot be pulled through the derivative operator acting on L. In this case I(&quot;t&quot;) and ω(&quot;t&quot;) do change together in such a way that the derivative of their product is still zero. This motion can be visualized by Poinsot&#x27;s construction.

==Generalized Euler equations==
The Euler equations can be generalized to any simple Lie algebra. The original Euler equations come from fixing the Lie algebra to be formula_18, with generators formula_19 satisfying the relation formula_20. Then if formula_21 (where formula_22 is a time coordinate, not to be confused with basis vectors formula_23) is an formula_18-valued function of time, and formula_25 (with respect to the Lie algebra basis), then the (untorqued) original Euler equations can be written
formula_26
To define formula_27 in a basis-independent way, it must be a self-adjoint map on the Lie algebra formula_28 with respect to the invariant bilinear form on formula_28. This expression generalizes readily to an arbitrary simple Lie algebra, say in the standard classification of simple Lie algebras.

This can also be viewed as a Lax pair formulation of the generalized Euler equations, suggesting their integrability.

<text>Fridleif, Fridlevus or Fritleff is a legendary king of the Danes.

==&quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;==
According to &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, he was a son of Fróði of the Skjöldung (Scylding) lineage. In that work he was the brother of Halfdan and the father of Áli the Strong.

==&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==
Fridleif is also mentioned in Book VI of &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; by Saxo Grammaticus. In this, he was also a son of Frode and was being reared in Russia at the time of Frode&#x27;s death. The Danes believed that Fridleif had also perished, and therefore gave the crown instead to a poet named Hiarn. Fridleif was called to the aid of his kinsman Halfdan, governor of Sweden after his father Erik, to help defeat 12 Norwegian brothers who were attacking his country. Fridleif killed 11 of the brothers, but subsequently recruited the strongest of the brothers, Biorn. During this adventure, he learned of his father&#x27;s passing and then returned to Denmark, revealing to the people that he had not died as previously believed. Hiarn refused to yield the throne, leading to civil war. Hiarn disguised himself to infiltrate Fridleif&#x27;s court and kill him, but was discovered. Fridleif defeated Hiarn in single combat and became king of Denmark.
==&quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;==
In the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, Fritleff came from the northern regions during the reign of Aki, married the daughter of Rolf Kraki, and had a son by her named Frothi. He then killed King Aki and became king in his place. When he died, he was succeeded by Frothi, who was nicknamed Largus (possibly meaning &quot;the Generous&quot; or &quot;the Tall&quot;).

<text>Johannes Andreas Grib Fibiger (23 April 1867 – 30 January 1928) was a Danish physician and professor of anatomical pathology at the University of Copenhagen. He was the recipient of the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for his discovery of the &quot;Spiroptera carcinoma&quot;&quot;. He claimed to have shown that the roundworm which he called &quot;Spiroptera carcinoma&quot; (but is correctly named &quot;Gongylonema neoplasticum&quot;) could cause stomach cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) in rats and mice. His experimental results were later proven to be a case of mistaken conclusion. 

While working at the Institute of Pathological Anatomy of University of Copenhagen, Fibiger discovered new roundworms in 1907 from wild rats. He suspected that the roundworms were responsible for stomach cancer in those rats. In 1913, he reported that he could experimentally induce cancer in healthy rats using the roundworms. His discovery was considered &quot;the greatest contribution to experimental medicine&quot; at the time. In 1926, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Katsusaburo Yamagiwa, who had experimentally induced carcinoma by painting crude coal tar on the inner surface of rabbits&#x27; ears in 1915. However, they were considered undeserving, and the 1926 prize was not given. In the next year Fibiger alone was retrospectively chosen for the 1926 Nobel Prize.

After his death, independent researches proved that &quot;G. neoplasticum&quot; cannot cause cancer. Tumours and cancer produced by Fibiger were due to vitamin A deficiency. Historical reassessment of Fibiger&#x27;s data revealed that he had mistaken non-cancerous tumours for cancerous tumours. Erling Norrby, who had served as the Permanent Secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and Professor and Chairman of Virology at the Karolinska Institute, in 2010 declared Fibiger&#x27;s Nobel Prize as &quot;one of the biggest blunders made by the Karolinska Institute.&quot;

Fibiger&#x27;s research method on diphtheria is regarded as the origin of an important research methodology in medicine known as controlled clinical trial.

==Biography==
Fibiger was born in Silkeborg, Midtjylland, Denmark. He was the second son of Christian Ludvig Wilhelm Fibiger and Elfride Fibiger (&quot;née&quot; Müller). His father was a local physician and his mother, an author. He was named after his uncle, who was a clergyman and a poet. His father died of internal bleeding when he was three years of age, after which the family moved to Copenhagen where his mother earned their living by writing. His mother established there the first cooking school, the Copenhagen Cooking School. 

His namesake uncle supported Fibiger for his education. In 1883, at age 16, he passed his matriculation and was enrolled at the University of Copenhagen to study zoology and botany. He self-supported by teaching and working at the laboratories. He graduated in 1883. He continued for a medicine course and earned his medical degree in 1890. For a few months he worked as a physician at different hospitals, and also continued to study under Robert Koch and Emil Adolf von Behring in Berlin. Between 1891 and 1894, he was assistant to C. J. Salomonsen at the Department of Bacteriology of Copenhagen University. From 1894 he joined the Royal Danish Army Medical Corps, where he served till 1897. It was during his army service that he completed his doctoral thesis &quot;Research into the bacteriology of diphtheria&quot;. The University of Copenhagen awarded him a doctorate degree in 1895. He continued the diphtheria research at Blegdamshospitalet in Copenhagen, working as a Junior Physician. In 1897, he was appointed prosector at the Institute of Pathological Anatomy of University of Copenhagen. He was promoted to full Professor and eventually its Director in 1900. He also served as Principal of the Laboratory of Clinical Bacteriology of the Army from 1890 to 1905), and Director of the Central Laboratory of the Army and Consultant Physician to the Army Medical Service in 1905.

Fibiger died of cardiac arrest in Copenhagen on 30 January 1928.

==Contributions==

===Diphtheria research===

Fibiger&#x27;s doctoral research was on diphtheria. He developed more efficient method of growing bacteria in a laboratory setting. He discovered that there were two different forms (strains) of the diphtheria bacillus (&quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;) that produce two different symptoms, now called nasopharyngeal and cutaneous diphtheria. He also produced a blood serum against the disease. He was known for his methodological system of research. One of his experiments from 1898 in which he tested the blood serum for diphtheria is regarded by some as the first controlled clinical trial. While working as a Junior Physician in Blegdamshospitalet, he tested his diphtheria serum among hundreds (484) patients. As would be in modern clinical trial, he separated serum-treated and untreated patients, and found that more of untreated patients died than the treated ones. According to an article in &quot;The British Medical Journal&quot; in 1998:
===Cancer and parasitology research===
While studying tuberculosis in lab rats, Fibiger found tumors in some wild rats collected from Dorpat (officially Tartu, now in Estonia) in 1907. Rats having stomach tumour (papilloma) also had nematodes and their eggs. He found that some tumours were metastatic (cancerous). He hypothesised that the nematodes caused the stomach cancer. After years of investigation, he experimentally demonstrated in 1913 that the nematode could induce stomach cancer. He published his discovery in a series of three papers, and also presented them at the Académie Royale des Sciences et des Lettres de Danemark (Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters), and Troisième Conférence Internationale pour l’Étude du Cancer (Third International Conference for Researches in Cancer) at Brussels the same year. He knew that the nematode was a new species, and provisionally named it &quot;Spiroptera carcinom &quot; in 1914. With Hjalmar Ditlevsen, of the Zoological Museum of the University of Copenhagen, he described it as &quot;Spiroptera&quot; (&quot;Gongylonema&quot;) &quot;neoplastica&quot; in 1914. Ditlevsen revised the description in 1918, and gave the final valid name &quot;Gongylonema neoplasticum&quot;. But Fibiger never used the formal scientific name, and persistently used &quot;Spiroptera carcinoma&quot;.

Fibiger&#x27;s experiment was the first to show that helminth parasites can cause cancer, and that cancer (tumour) can be experimentally induced. His discovery was supported by the experiment of two Japanese scientists Katsusaburo Yamagiwa and Koichi Ichikawa in 1918. Yamagiwa and Ichikawa demonstrated the induction of cancer (carcinoma) in rabbits. They showed that it was relatively easy to produce cancer was by painting coal-tar on the inner surface of the ear. A number independent experiments subsequently confirmed the cancer-inducing effect of coal-tar in mice. With such supporting evidence, Fibiger&#x27;s work was regarded a milestone in cancer study.

==Personal life==

Fibiger was married to Mathilde Fibiger (1863–1954). Mathilde was his cousin who came to help her mother&#x27;s business while he was studying medicine. They got married on 4 August 1894. Fibiger had been suffering from colon cancer, and a month after he received his Nobel Prize, he died of heart attack on 30 January 1928 due to his worsening cancer. He was survived by his wife and two children.

==Nobel Prize controversy==

===Nomination and selection===

Fibiger was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 18 times from 1920. In 1926, he received two nominations along with Katsusaburo Yamagiwa. Folke Henschen and Hilding Bergstrand were appointed by the Nobel Committee as assessors. They disagreed on each other&#x27;s conclusion. Henschen was in favour of the nomination and concluded that &quot;the experimental carcinoma is worthy of the Nobel Prize. It should therefore be just if the prize would be divided between Johannes Fibiger, the discoverer of the experimental spiroptera carcinoma, and Katsusaburo Yamagiwa, the discoverer of the experimental tar carcinoma.&quot; But Bergstrand opposed to it, concluding that &quot;an experimental confirmation of a previously known fact... [referring to the prevalence of cancer among chimney sweeps and factory workers, an already established medical fact at the time] can, in this case, not be considered... that one cannot, at this point, find much support for the possibility that the work of Fibiger and Yamagiwa will have great importance in the solving of the riddle of cancer. Under such circumstances I do not consider these discoveries worthy of the Nobel Prize.&quot; The Nobel Committee could not make the final decision and decided not to give the prize for 1926. In the next year, Fibiger received seven nominations, and Yamagiwa was then excluded. Instead there were two other nominees, Otto Heinrich Warburg and Julius Wagner-Jauregg. In addition to Henschen and Bergstrand, Einar Hammersten was appointed as the third assessor. On Fibiger, Bergstrand was of the same opinion, Hammersten was in favour. Hence the three nominees were recommended for the award. The Nobel Committee decided to give the 1926 prize jointly to Fibiger and Warburg, and the 1927 prize to Wagner-Jauregg. However, the authority at the Karolinska Institute disagreed with the recommendation for Warburg for undisclosed reasons, and Fibiger became the sole winner. (Warburg was eventually awarded the prize in 1931.)

===Posthumous criticism and disproof===

Fibiger&#x27;s discovery was unchallenged during his lifetime. The only serious criticism was by F. D. Bullock and G. L. Rohdenburg. In 1918, they argued that the cancerous tumours produced in Fibiger&#x27;s experiments were similar to non-cancerous tumours. Such tumours easily developed in epithelial cells. Fibiger defended himself, saying, &quot;That these tumors are true carcinomata cannot, thus, be doubted, and the fact that they may occur in younger animals does not diminish our right to range them among the true malignant neoplasms.&quot; 

It was only after Fibiger&#x27;s death that the importance of vitamin A in cancer development was fully appreciated. Fibiger had used rats which were fed vitamin A-less diet. It was found that Vitamin A deficiency alone can cause tumours and cancers. The parasites had merely caused the tissue irritation (chronic inflammation) that drove the damaged cells into cancer; any tissue irritation could have induced the tumours. The major challenge came from Richard Douglas Passey, with his colleagues A. Léese, and J.C. Knox. They reported a new finding in 1935 that &quot;S. carcinoma&quot; do not cause cancer in rats. They concluded that Fibiger had probably mistaken metaplasia (a non-cancerous tumour) with malignant neoplasia (true cancer). In 1937, W. Cramer experimentally showed that Fibiger&#x27;s tumour were not cancerous. The final disproof was shown by Claude R. Hitchcock and E. T. Bell. In 1952, they repeated Fibiger&#x27;s experiments using advanced microscopy and histology, and conclusively demonstrated that the tumours due to &quot;G. neoplasticum&quot; in rats were non-cancerous, and that the tumours were primarily due to vitamin A deficiency. 

It is also claimed that exclusion of Yamagiwa was another mistake. Yamagiwa&#x27;s work has become the primary basis for induction of tumours in cancer research. Because of this, some consider Fibiger&#x27;s Nobel Prize to be undeserved particularly because Yamagiwa did not receive the prize. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; guide to Nobel Prizes in cancer research mentions Yamagiwa&#x27;s work as a milestone without mentioning Fibiger.

Although &quot;G. neoplasticum&quot; is non-carcinogenic, other helminth parasites such as &quot;Schistosoma haematobium&quot;, &quot;Opisthorchis viverrini&quot; and &quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot; are now established to cause cancer in humans.

<doc id="898820" wikidata="Q671247" url="?curid=898820" title="Lewis R. Bradley">
<text>Lewis Rice &quot;Broadhorns&quot; Bradley (February 18, 1805 – March 21, 1879) was an American politician who was the second Governor of Nevada from 1871 to 1879. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Biography==
Bradley was born on February 18, 1805, in Orange County, Virginia. When he was thirteen years old, his father died and he quit school and became a mule trader to support his mother and his many younger siblings. He married Virginia Hode Willis and the couple had three children. He moved to Missouri, the mule capital of the nation. His wife, Virginia, died May 11, 1852, in Fayette, Howard County, Missouri.

==Career==
In 1852, Bradley and his son, John R. Bradley, bought a herd of Texas Longhorn cattle and pushed them west, earning him the nickname &quot;Old Broadhorns&quot;, and arriving in the San Joaquin Valley, California, with a 40% loss. He settled in Stockton, California, and drove horses, mules, and sheep in from Missouri. The winter and spring floods of 1861 and 1862 ruined their lands, and the Bradleys moved to Nevada where he worked in the cattle business in Elko County, near Jiggs.

Bradley, running for governor, bought a defunct newspaper, &quot;The Daily Inland Empire&quot;, used it as a campaigning tool, then let it go under again. He served two terms as governor, but was narrowly defeated for the third time he ran as governor. Since he was a widower, his daughter, Virginia, acted as his official hostess during his term. In 1959, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

==Death==
Bradley died on March 21, 1879, in Elko, Nevada, at the age of 74. He is interred at Elko City Cemetery in Elko.

<doc id="898821" wikidata="Q3567610" url="?curid=898821" title="2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony">
<text>The [[Olympic Games ceremony#Opening|opening ceremony]] of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] was held on August 13, 2004 starting at 20:45 EEST (UTC+3) at the Olympic Stadium in Marousi, Greece, a suburb of Athens. As mandated by the Olympic Charter, the proceedings combined the formal and ceremonial opening of this international sporting event, including welcoming speeches, hoisting of the flags and the parade of athletes, with an artistic spectacle to showcase the host nation&#x27;s culture and history. 72,000 spectators (with nearly 50 world leaders) attended the event, with approximately 15,000 athletes from 202 countries participating in the ceremony as well. It marked the first-ever international broadcast of high-definition television, undertaken by the U.S. media conglomerate NBC Universal and the Japanese broadcaster NHK.
The Games were officially opened by President of the Hellenic Republic Konstantinos Stephanopoulos at 23:46 EEST (UTC+3).

==Proceedings==
===Countdown and Welcome===
The opening ceremony began with a 28-second countdown—one second per Olympics held since Athens last hosted the first modern games, paced by the sounds of an amplified heartbeat. At the end of the countdown, fireworks were set off. 

Four hundred percussionists performed the zeimbekiko before marching around the edge of the flooded stadium grounds, accompanied by a 50-person strong bouzouki band. The performance was led by two drummers, one inside the stadium and one projected on the stadium screen from the ancient stadium of Olympia, the locale of the Olympic games in antiquity. On screen was Petros Kourtis, with Nikos Hatzidavitidis responding live at the ceremony. A blazing comet, seemingly coming from the ancient stadium of Olympia, lands on the flooded stadium floor drawing the Olympic Rings with its fire. The comet symbolizes the fire of the ancients giving life to the modern Olympic movement, thus bridging the past and the present together. According to Dimitris Papaioannou, the event &quot;was a pageant of traditional Greek culture and history harkening back to its mythological beginnings, and viewed through the progression of Greek art.&quot; 

Next, a young Greek boy Michalis Patsatzis sailed into the stadium on a giant paper boat waving the host nation&#x27;s flag, symbolizing Greece&#x27;s maritime tradition and its close connection to the sea. The Hellenic Naval Band then walks into the stadium. The President of the Athens Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (ATHOC), Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, and President of the International Olympic Committee Jacques Rogge walk onto the stadium floor. The Band then performs the Presidential fanfare, where President of the Hellenic Republic Konstantinos Stephanopoulos then also arrives on the stadium floor. The three presidents meet the young boy, before Hymn to Liberty, the Greek national anthem was performed a cappella with the raising of the Greek Flag.

===Artistic section===
The segments that followed were divided in two main parts. The first part of the main artistic segment of the opening ceremony was called &quot;Allegory.&quot; &quot;Allegory&quot; introduced the main conceptual themes and ideals that are going to be omnipresent throughout the entire opening ceremony, such as the confluence of the past and present, love and passion as the progenitors of history, and humanity&#x27;s attempt to understand itself. The second part, called the &quot;Clepsydra,&quot; or &quot;Hourglass,&quot; celebrates the themes introduced in the &quot;Allegory&quot; section through a portrayal of Greek history from the ancient to the modern times.

====Allegory====
The &quot;Allegory&quot; segment begins with a recitation of a verse from Nobel Prize-winning Greek poet George Seferis&#x27; poem &quot;Mythistorema 3.&quot; As the verse is being recited on the speakers, the spotlights are focused upon a woman clad in a black gown looking out to the water. Holding a marble sculpture head, the woman seems to be entering into a dream. As she looks into the dark water, a centaur appears whose human and animal parts supposedly symbolize the duality of spirit and body. The centaur then walks about and then throws a spear of light into the center of the stadium, from which a giant statue that exemplifies Cycladic art (and thus one of the first depictions of the human form in Greek art) emerges. This Cycladic head also represents one of the first attempts of humanity to understand itself. With the use of lasers, geometrical shapes and other scientific images (such as a stylistic representation of the Solar System) are displayed on the figure&#x27;s face. The statue then breaks into pieces that float away, and from within it emerges a smaller kouros statue from the Archaic Period of Greek sculpture, which in turn breaks apart to reveal the depiction of man in a sculpture of the classical period, symbolizing the dawn of individuality and extolling human scale, one of the principal themes of the 2004 Olympics. At the end of this sequence, a cube arises from the water, and a man starts slowly balancing himself on the rotating cube while representations of humankind&#x27;s greatest achievements, contrasted to humanistic representations and images of people of various ethnicities and ages, are projected onto the pieces of broken sculpture, which seem to be floating above the water. This last sequence is meant to symbolize the birth of logical thought, higher learning, and humanity finally making sense of the world in which it lives. After this sequence, the pieces of sculpture descend to the water, meant to symbolize the Greek isles.

====Clepsydra====

In the next sequence, Eros, the Greek god of love, is introduced flying over a pair of lovers (a man and a woman) frolicking in the pool of water located in the center of the stadium. The young couple along with Eros symbolize the fact that the humanity which creates and shapes history is born out of love and passion. This segment introduces the next part of the ceremony, the &quot;Clepsydra,&quot; which highlights the themes of the opening ceremony through a celebration of Greek history. The lovers then lie down in the water, and both fall into a dream state. Throughout the rest of the scenes from history and mythology, Eros flies over the parade, occasionally touching or stepping on the floats moving beneath him, thus reinforcing the theme of love and passion as the source for all history.

The pageantry following the statues and the introduction of Eros continues to portray scenes that show the sequence of Greek civilisation through its art. The scenes start with the Minoan civilisation. The first float features the iconic image of Minoan civilization: that of the fertility goddess clad in a bodice exposing her breasts and clutching serpents in both hands. The subsequent floats then feature scenes of bull-jumping, dolphins, and other elements that harken back to the images in the frescoes of Phaestos. The scenes then proceed to the more stark art of the Mycenean civilisation, followed by representations of the Classical period. A chariot carrying an actor portraying Alexander the Great introduces images from the Hellenistic period, which in turn are followed by representations of Byzantine art, the Greek War of Independence, and lastly of 20th century elements of Greek culture, such as the popular shadow-theatre figure Karagiozis, who is said to be a humorous and self-deprecating depiction (and parody) of Greek mentality.

At the end of the parade, &quot;Eros&quot; lowered enough to help a pregnant woman remove her outer garment. This last part represents the ceremony coming into full circle: the &quot;Clepsydra&quot; segment began with the image of the Minoan fertility goddess and is now ending with a pregnant woman representing the future of all humanity and history. With belly glowing, the woman moves into the lake of water as the stadium&#x27;s lights dim and lights underneath the pool of water turn on, thus creating an image of stars in a galaxy. According to Greek myth, the stars of the galaxy were born out of the milk of Hera&#x27;s fertile breasts. In fact, the name for the Milky Way Galaxy, the home to planet Earth, was born out of this myth. Slowly the stars rise around the woman, and move to form a rapidly rotating DNA double helix, which is the basis for all life on the planet. Humanity&#x27;s attempt to understand itself, a theme that has been omnipresent throughout the entire ceremony beginning with the Cycladic head, is further reinforced by the representation of the DNA double helix, which symbolizes humanity&#x27;s latest and most recent attempt to understand itself: the late 20th and early 21st centuries witnessed great advances in the field of genetics with the mapping of the human genome.

Finally, all the characters of the parade begin to walk inside the pool, around its center, mixing the past and the present in a single marching beat of the drums. The confluence of the past and the present is another main theme of the opening ceremony. The music begins a crescendo with choruses, when all of a sudden an olive tree is lifted from the center of the pool—symbolizing goddess Athena&#x27;s preferred gift by the Greeks—land and food—over Poseidon&#x27;s gift, the horse—a tool of warfare. At the music&#x27;s climax, all the characters stop and raise their arms as if worshipping the Tree, which is high above, surrounded also by the fragments of the deconstructed statues who resemble a mount.

===Parade of Nations===

In order to prepare for the entry of the athletes to the stadium, the giant pool of water that had been constructed on the floor of the stadium had to first be drained. 2,162,000 liters of water were drained from the stadium in a time period of three minutes, providing a dry, hard surface for the athletes to march and gather on.

Typically, Greece leads the Parade of Nations in any Olympics, with the host nation entering the stadium last. However, since Greece was the host nation, they went last, sending only their flag with the weightlifter Pyrros Dimas as the flag bearer into the stadium at the beginning of the parade, and the athletes themselves at the end of it.

The debut position was given to Saint Lucia (Αγία Λουκία in Greek), who led the Parade of Nations into the stadium. As the nations entered in Greek alphabetical order, Zimbabwe—which has usually been the penultimate nation, followed only by the host country—appeared in the middle of the parade. Countries such as the United States and Switzerland, which are usually at the rear of the pack, were granted earlier entries as well due to their position in the Greek alphabet.

The entrances of Afghanistan and Iraq were emotional highpoints of the parade. The nation of Kiribati made its debut Olympic appearance at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and East Timor marched under its own flag for the first time. Serbia and Montenegro appeared at the Olympics under the nation&#x27;s new name for the first time since the country was officially renamed in 2003, its only time at the Summer Olympics prior to the union&#x27;s dissolution in 2006 (just after the 2006 Winter Olympics); it had previously been known as Yugoslavia.

Due to the unpopularity of the American-led invasion of Iraq among Greeks, it had been expected by the media that audience members would protest against the war during the entrance of the American delegation into the stadium by booing; however, the Americans did receive a warm welcome, much to the pleasant surprise of US news anchors covering the event as well as NBC Sports anchor Bob Costas. NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Olympics has been praised, and the company was awarded with 6 Emmy Awards for its coverage of the Games and technical production. Additionally, NBC televised all 28 sports in the 2004 Games, becoming the first broadcaster to do so.

Apart from Greece, the Greek crowd reserved some of their loudest cheers for their fellow Greeks from Cyprus, Australia, home to many Greeks and site of the previous Summer Olympics and Mediterranean countries such as France and Italy, as well as for Brazil and Canada. A loud cheer was also given for Djibouti, because it had only one person enter the stadium. The teams from Palestine and Serbia and Montenegro were also very warmly welcomed. Cheers greeted Portugal, the nation that hosted the UEFA Euro 2004, which Greece won beating Portugal in the final match by 1–0.

High-ranking politicians and royalty from all around the world applauded as the teams from their respective countries paraded by. Important guests like U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Crown Prince Haakon of Norway (who lit the Cauldron for the 1994 Winter Olympics), and Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, (among others) each stood and applauded the teams from their countries. Past world leaders, including U.S. President George H. W. Bush, also attended and applauded their national teams during the parade, in which DJ Tiësto played trance music.

===Oceania - A Song for the Athletes===
Björk then sang her song Oceania. The song was written at the ocean&#x27;s point of view, from which the singer believes all life emerged, and details the human&#x27;s evolution, whilst accompanied by a choir. While she sang, her dress slowly covered the athletes with a white sheet. At the end of the song, a projection of the world was shown on the dress. However, technical complications with the sheet meant that the sheet didn&#x27;t reach all the athletes by the end of the song. If the segment succeeded, it would be a call back to the flags covering all athletes in the Olympic opening ceremonies of 1992 and 2000.

A video from the International Space Station Expedition 9 crew then played, with Russian Commander Gennady Padalka and United States Flight Engineer Michael Fincke welcoming the athletes and stressing the importance for human collaboration between countries for peace.

===108 Years of Olympic Games===
After introducing the founders of the Modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin and Demetrios Vikelas and the first games in 1896, runner Giorgos Sabanis carries a flag with an image of an olive branch symbolizing not only peace but Athens itself, lapped around the stadium, symbolically crossing tape dedicated to the previous 27 Olympiads. The runner symbolically stumbles at the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games which were canceled due to world wars. The runner ended his run at the very center of the stadium, where the olive tree from the artistic section has appeared, symbolizing the Modern Olympic Games journey around the world, and coming back home to Athens. 

While not officially part of the Olympic protocol, there has been a recognition of past host cities at some Opening Ceremonies. For the Summer Olympics, a recognition has appeared in the 1992 opening ceremony in Barcelona, 1996 opening ceremony in Atlanta and a reduced version at the 2012 opening ceremony in London. In the Winter Olympics, there has been a recognition in 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where banners of the previous 18 Winter Olympics entered Rice-Eccles Stadium at the beginning of the ceremony, the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Vancouver and the 2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing.

===Opening addresses===
Two short speeches were delivered in front of the olive tree, a traditional Greek and Olympic symbol. The first speech came from Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the President of the Athens Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (ATHOC), and the first female chief organizer of an Olympic Games. Angelopoulos-Daskalaki offered a message of welcome to the Athletes of the World in Greek and English: &quot;Καλως ΗΡΘΑΤΕ&quot;! and &quot;Welcome! Welcome to the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad. Welcome to a unique Olympic Homecoming.&quot; She told the athletes in Greek: &quot;Η Ελλάδα είναι εδώ. Είμαστε έτοιμοι.&quot; which translates into English as &quot;Greece is here. We&#x27;re ready&quot; and also stated, &quot;Ολυμπιακοί Αγώνες, Καλώς ήρθατε.&quot; (in Greek), &quot;Jeux olympiques, bienvenue.&quot; (in French), and &quot;Olympic Games, Welcome home!&quot; (in English). She also stated the people of Greece &quot;have waited long for this moment,&quot; alluding to the long period between the first modern Olympic Games in Greece and the 2004 Games.

Angelopoulos-Daskalaki was followed by the President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Jacques Rogge, who delivered a speech encouraging participating athletes to resist the urge to use banned performance-enhancing substances and &quot;show us that sport unites by overriding national, political, religious, and language barriers&quot;. Rogge speaking in Greek stated, &quot;Έχω τώρα την τιμή να καλέσω τον Πρόεδρο της Ελληνικής Δημοκρατίας. Να κηρύξει την Έναρξη των Αγώνων.&quot; which translate into English as &quot;I have the honor of inviting the President of the Hellenic Republic. To announce the opening of the Games.&quot; Rogge then introduced the President of the Hellenic Republic Konstantinos Stephanopoulos, who declared the games officially open. Stephanopoulos was accompanied by the Adjutant to the President of the Hellenic Republic Air Force Colonel Georgios Dritsakos, who spoke in Greek saying, which translates into English as &quot;I declare open the Olympic Games of Athens...and the celebration of the XXVIII Olympiad of the modern era.&quot;

===The Olympic Flag, Anthem and Oaths===
Five bells, each bell representing a continent, then are rung to heralded in the opening the games. The audience also rang their bells given to them. As the bells were rung, children run into the stadium floor holding olive branches. In the midst of their crowd, the Olympic flag made its entrance. It was carried in by eight Greek athletes. They were: 
* Petros Galaktopoulos (Greco-Roman wrestling) 
* Ilias Hatzipavlis (sailing)
* Niki Bakoyianni (athletics)
* Angelos Basinas (football) 
* Leonidas Kokas (weightlifting)
* Michalis Mouroutsos (taekwondo) 
* Valerios Leonidis (weightlifting) 
* Dimosthenis Tampakos (gymnastics) 
They then passed on the flag to the eight sailors of the Hellenic Navy and the Olympic flag was hoist and raised while singing of the Olympic Hymn which the Greek choirs of men and children sang in Greek was conducted by John Psathas.

Greek freestyle swimmer Zoi Dimoschaki gave the Athletes Oath on behalf of all athletes in Greek. Greek basketball referee Lazaros Voreadis delivered the officials oath in Greek.

===Torch relay and the lighting of the cauldron===

The Opening Ceremony culminated at the end of the torch relay, a tradition began when Berlin hosted the games in 1936. This segment preceding the torch&#x27;s arrival honored the first global torch relay that was begun in Athens. Before the torch came into the stadium, three rings arose from the center of the stadium that simulated a globe. Projections of doves were shown on the globe and on the LED screens as symbol of peace. Then actors, suspended on cables, started rising out of the crowd and ran towards the globe, carrying glowing sticks meant to simulate the Olympic torch. On the globe, the names of the cities which the torch visited were projected, and this segment ended with all the torchbearers floating mid-air coming together at the globe. After this segment ended, the lights were dimmed, and the sound of the heartbeat accompanied by thunderous cheers and applause met the torch&#x27;s final arrival to the Olympic Stadium.

Torch bearer Nikos Galis, considered to be the greatest Greek basketball player of all time, entered the stadium first. The torch was passed on, in sequential order, to Greek football legend Mimis Domazos, 1992 Hurdles champion Voula Patoulidou, 1996 Olympic weightlifting champion Kakhi Kakhiashvili, and 1996 Olympic gymnastics champion Ioannis Melissanidis.

The torch was finally passed to the 1996 Olympic sailing champion Nikolaos Kaklamanakis, who lit a giant tapered column resembling the Olympic torch — not, as usual, a cauldron — to burn during the duration of the 2004 Summer Olympics. As Kaklamanakis ascended the steps to light the cauldron, the cauldron seemed to bow down to him, symbolizing that despite advance of technology, technology is still a creation and tool of humanity and that it was meant to serve humanity&#x27;s needs. The ceremony concluded with a breathtaking fireworks display.

==Music performances==

During the &quot;Allegory&quot; segment highlighting the conceptual and themes and ideals of the opening ceremony, the chosen music was Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 in D Minor: 6. Langsam.
The music played during the &quot;Clepsydra&quot; segment highlighting Greek history and mythology was composed by Konstantinos Bita. The songs played were instrumental in nature and many used traditional Greek instruments. Famous Greek artists such as Stavros Xarhakos (whose song &quot;Zeimbekiko&quot; was played), Manos Hadjidakis, Mikis Theodorakis and Konstantinos Bita, were included in the Olympic soundtrack. The whole music project was arranged by composer George Koumendakis, who had worked in the past several times with Papaioannou and was assisted in this project by Maria Metaxaki. The music production team included Marcus Dillistone, Paul Stefanidis, Dick Lewsey and Julian Scott.

New Zealand composer John Psathas (son of Greek immigrant parents) was chosen to compose and arrange music to accompany parts of the opening ceremonies. The most prestigious engagement of his career to date, he joins the ranks of well-known composers, such as John Williams, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Leonard Bernstein and Mikis Theodorakis who have also written music for the Olympics.

Mr Psathas was engaged in 2003 to compose and arrange music for the Games’ opening and closing ceremonies. He has since commuted several times between Wellington and Athens to work on the music and supervise the rehearsal process.

His music includes a number of specially composed fanfares and processionals to accompany the arrival of the IOC President, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron and to precede the Olympic oaths, and he is responsible for the soundtrack to the entire ‘flame sequence’ of the ceremony. John Psathas has also arranged the National Anthem of Greece, the Olympic Hymn, and music by Shostakovich, Debussy and the foremost living Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis to accompany other parts of the ceremony. The fireworks at the Games’ closing ceremony on 29 August will also feature music by the composer.

During the Parade of Nations, Dutchman DJ Tiësto provided the music, becoming the first DJ ever to spin live at the Olympics. During the course of his performance the Dutch athletes started dancing in front of the DJ booth and had to be moved on by officials. Tiësto later released a condensed version of the performance on CD titled Parade of the Athletes. In the liner notes, he noted the IOC requested to him that the music not contain any lyrics as they could be inadvertently misinterpreted.

Björk performed &quot;Oceania&quot;, later included on her album &quot;Medúlla&quot;, immediately after the Parade of Nations ended. While the song was being played, a large piece of fabric (which belonged to Björk&#x27;s dress) was pulled over the heads of the athletes, who had gathered on the ground in the center of the stadium following their march around the stadium. At the conclusion of Björk&#x27;s performance, a map of the world was projected on the fabric.

The entrance of the torch on the stadium was surrounded by the &quot;Le Roi Lear Fanfare&quot;, by Claude Debussy; and the cauldron was lighted by the final part of &quot;Pirogov Suite&quot;, an epic suite by Dmitri Shostakovich. Both songs were adapted by John Psathas.

==Anthems==
* National Anthem of Greece
* Olympic Hymn (Greek)

==Reviews==
The ceremony was a source of major acclaim amongst international press and featured never before seen technologies used in a stadium, including a giant pool with slip-proof iridescent fiberglass flooring that drained its water in three minutes, beautiful and innovative lighting, and an ingenious staging system utilizing a complex network of automated cables that lifted, maneuvered, and choreographed the floating pieces of sculpture to follow the music and narrative of the opening ceremony. The costumes, which also drew great international praise, were designed by well-known London-based Greek fashion designer Sophia Kokosalaki. Eleftheria Deco was awarded for her lighting design of the opening ceremony with an Emmy award. NBC, an American television broadcaster of the 2004 Athens Olympics, has also been awarded with 6 Emmy Awards for its coverage of the Games and technical production.

<doc id="898826" wikidata="Q676775" url="?curid=898826" title="Gottschalk of Orbais">
<text>Gottschalk of Orbais (, &quot;Gotteschalchus&quot;; c. 808 – 30 October 868) was a Saxon theologian, monk and poet. Gottschalk was an early advocate for the doctrine of double predestination, an issue that ripped through both Italy and Francia from 848 into the 850s and 860s. Led by his own interpretation of Augustine&#x27;s teachings on the matter, he claimed the sinfulness of human nature and the need to turn to God with a humility for salvation. He saw himself as a divine vessel calling all of Christianity to repent for decades of Civil War. His attempts of this new Christianisation of Francia ultimately failed, his doctrine was condemned as heresy at the 848 council of Mainz and 849 council of Quierzy. Following his conviction as a heretic Gottschalk remained stubborn to his ideology disobeying the ecclesiastical hierarchy, making him an &quot;actual heretic in the flesh&quot;, for this disobedience Gottschalk was placed in monastic confinement; however the shockwaves his ideology sent around Western Christendom refused to stop reverberating, Gottschalk managed to win over more followers and the threat remained up until his death in 868.

Gottschalk was a son of Saxon count Bernus, child oblate at the monastery of Fulda under the tutelage of the Abbot Hrabanus Maurus of Mainz. Then, he was sent at Reichenau, he became close friends with Walafrid Strabo and Loup de Ferrières. In June 829, at the synod of Mainz, on the pretext that he had been unduly constrained by his abbot, he sought and obtained his liberty, withdrew first to Corbie.

==Priesthood==
Between 835 and 840 Gottschalk was ordained priest, without the knowledge of his bishop, by Rigbold, chorepiscopus of Reims. Gottschalk&#x27;s time at the Monastery of Corbie would have been formative in his development in both intellect and missionary ideology, Corbie being the centre for preparing missionaries. Before 840 Gottschalk deserted his monastery and went to Italy, where he preached his doctrine of twin predestination, and entered into relations with Notting, bishop of Verona, and Eberhard, margrave of Friuli.

He was however driven from Italy through the influence of Hrabanus Maurus, now archbishop of Mainz, who wrote two violent letters to Notting and Eberhard. Gottschalk travelled through Dalmatia, Pannonia and Noricum, while continuing to preach and write.

Gottschalk was at Trpimir I of Croatia&#x27;s court between 846 and 848, and his work &quot;De Trina deitate&quot; is an important source of information for Trpimir&#x27;s reign. Gottschalk was a witness to the battle between Trpimir and Byzantine strategos, probably of Dalmatia, when Trpimir was victorious.

==Predestination controversy==
Gottschalk returned to Francia after a decade of travels throughout Europe, during this time he had gained reputation for his teachings on predestination. The key foundations of this belief that God had granted grace to a select few while denying it to those destined for Hell. This was a direct split from theological belief that God viewed humans acts with final judgement being based upon a person&#x27;s nature and willingness to repent for sins, with God being able to deduce sinners and unrepentant. Gottschalk strengthened his ideas throughout the 830s and 840s a period in which the Carolingian Empire was falling continuously into crisis, in this time of uncertainty Gottschalk&#x27;s teachings were clear wish for atonement, this message grew from the culture of the 820s–830s that saw Louis the Pious perform public penance, also inspired by Augustine. This state of repentance had to be permanent, the daily prayer for sin and confession of sins that was accepted within [monastic] life had clearly not worked, so a constant state of repentance was needed to keep from enticing God&#x27;s wrath.

Gottschalk&#x27;s heretical teachings went unopposed until the 848 synod of Mainz, here his old abbot Hrabanus presided over events now as Archbishop of Mainz, also present was King Louis the German. Gottschalk&#x27;s &quot;libellus&quot; to support his theological belief was condemned as heretical. Gottschalk was beaten by those present, before taking an oath never to return to Louis the Germans Kingdom of East Francia. Gottschalk was a priest and monk from the archdiocese of Rheims, so was sent to the Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims for containment. This exposed the diocese of Rheims to the extreme theological issues that Gottschalk brought with him.

Ninth century heresies had largely been foreigners (Spanish or Greek), creating a great other for Carolingian theologians to use to define faith boundaries, the one exception was Gottschalk who continuously refused to renounce his beliefs.

From Gottschalk&#x27;s position of confinement he gained help from the monks at Orbais, where he had been previously contained. From this position Gottschalk sent his doctrine to all forms of ecclesiastical and lay authority. Gottschalk expected this to find support, he did in the scholar Ratramnus who composed ideas on predestination similar to those of Gottschalk.

==Theology==
Gottschalk was influenced by the Augustinian soteriology, which centered on a divine monergism, and implied a double predestination. However, unlike Augustine, Gottschalk explicitly argued for double predestination based on the immutable sovereignty of God. He maintained that predestination was absolute, with God&#x27;s will determining the fate of both the saved and the damned. His teachings attracted significant attention and controversy, ultimately leading to his condemnation as a heretic.

At the heart of the controversy were the five propositions of Gottschalk. These can be summarized as follows:

1. God foreordains both the elect and the reprobate: Gottschalk argued that God, in his sovereignty, has predetermined not only who would be saved but also who would be damned. This double predestination was a central feature of Gottschalk’s theology.

2. The certainty of salvation and perdition: Gottschalk asserted that the eternal destinies of individuals were fixed. Those elected by God could not lose their salvation, while the reprobate were inevitably destined for perdition.

3. God does not will the salvation of all people: Gottschalk contended that God’s will was selective, choosing only the elect for salvation. He argued that when the Bible speaks of God’s desire for all to be saved, this &quot;all&quot; referred exclusively to the elect.

4. Limited atonement: Consistent with his doctrine of predestination, Gottschalk believed that Christ’s atoning death was intended only for the elect, not for all humanity.

5. Human freedom is limited to only evil: Gottschalk taught that humanity had no ability to choose good apart. After the fall, human will was bound to sin and incapable of turning to God.

==Council of Quierzy, 849==
The Council of Quierzy occurred six months after the Council at Mainz, when he was again questioned about his doctrine in an attempt to break his belief making him accept that the other bishops were correct. Gathered at this meeting were many notable including Archbishop Hincmar and King Charles the Bald the council was determined to prove Gottschalk&#x27;s ideas incorrect and his readings of Augustine being wrong. Gottschalk allegedly burst into abuse following this refusal to accept the ideology of twin predestination. In response to this Gottschalk was stripped of his priestly status, whipped, and held in custody at the monastery of Hauntvillers in silence. Gottschalk was forced to burn the writings that he had taken to the council, and was &#x27;beaten nearly to death&#x27; on the command of lower ranking abbots not those in ecclesiastical office.

==Writings==
From the 17th century, when the Jansenists exalted Gottschalk , much has been written on him. Two studies are F. Picavet, &quot;Les Discussions sur la liberté au temps de Gottschalk, de Raban Maur, d&#x27;Hincmar, et de Jean Scot&quot;, in &quot;Comptes rendus de l&#x27;acad. des sciences morales et politiques&quot; (Paris, 1896); and A. Freystedt, &quot;Studien zu Gottschalks Leben und Lehre&quot;, in &quot;Zeitschrsft für Kirchengeschichte&quot; (1897), vol. xviii.

For many years he was believed to be the author of the &quot;Eclogue of Theodulus&quot; (&quot;Ecolga Theoduli&quot;) because both Theodulus and Gottscalk both mean &quot;servant of God&quot; in their respective languages, and because Gottschalk is believed to have known some Greek and the use of Greek names in the dialogue. This authorship theory was disputed by Karl Strecker in 1924. Strecker showed the writing style (poetic meter) of Theodulus was different. Most scholars now agree that Gottschalk was not the author of the &quot;Ecolga&quot;.

== Legacy ==
There are multiple parallels with the views of Gottschalk and the Protestant reformers, which is why some see him as a forerunner of Protestantism. His views share most similarities with John Calvin, his similarities include the doctrine of justification by faith alone, which his views seem to have mirrored.

The 17th century Anglican Archbishop James Ussher also sided with Gottschalk for his predestinarian views.

<doc id="898827" wikidata="Q6544436" url="?curid=898827" title="Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee">
<text>The lieutenant governor and speaker of the Senate of Tennessee is the presiding officer of the Tennessee Senate and first in line in the succession to the office of governor of Tennessee in the event of the death, resignation, or removal from office through impeachment and conviction of the governor of Tennessee. 

The current lieutenant governor is Randy McNally, who was elected to the post on January 10, 2017, and is the second (consecutive) Republican to hold the post since Reconstruction. He succeeded Ron Ramsey, who held the post continuously from 2007 to 2017.

Under the Tennessee State Constitution of 1870, the speaker of the Senate is elected by the Tennessee State Senate from among its members. The lieutenant governor as a member of the Tennessee Senate has a four-year term as a senator but is subject to re-election by his peers with each new legislature; as the senators&#x27; terms are staggered by class and there could be a 50 percent turnover in membership between one legislature and the next.

== Compensation ==
The job is in theory a part-time one, paying $72,948 per year; the lieutenant governor is a member of the Tennessee General Assembly (the base pay for which is $24,316 per year), which is a legislature limited to 15 organizational days and 90 legislative days with full pay and expenses in each two-year sitting. 

== Line of succession ==
Since Tennessee became a state in 1796, four speakers of the Senate have succeeded to the governorship:

*William Hall, who succeeded upon the resignation of Sam Houston;
*Dewitt Clinton Senter, who succeeded William G. Brownlow, who resigned to accept election to the U.S. Senate;
*John I. Cox, who succeeded James B. Frazier, who resigned as governor after arranging his appointment to the unexpired term of U.S. Senator William B. Bate, who had died in office; and
*Henry Hollis Horton, who succeeded Austin Peay, the only governor of Tennessee to die in office .

Under the Tennessee Constitution, in the event of succession the Speaker does not become &quot;acting governor&quot; or &quot;interim governor,&quot; but assumes the title and full powers of the governorship, much as the vice president of the United States becomes president upon the death, resignation or removal from office of the president. An important distinction is that if the speaker becomes governor during the first 18 months of the governor&#x27;s four-year term, a special election for the balance of the term will be held at the next U.S. general election. If the speaker becomes governor after the first 18 months of the term, the speaker will serve the entire remainder of the term. In either case, any partial term counts toward the limit of two consecutive terms. For example, if the current speaker, Randy McNally, had ascended to the governorship during the second term of Bill Haslam, he would have been eligible to run for a full term in 2018, but would have had to leave office in 2023. However, this provision has not been put into practice since the gubernatorial term was extended to four years in 1953.

The title of lieutenant governor is granted to the speaker by statutory law enacted in 1951 in recognition of the fact that the speaker is the governor&#x27;s designated successor; such has been the case since the adoption of the first state constitution and Tennessee statehood in 1796.

== List of officeholders==
=== Before 1870 ===

===1870–present===
The following is a list of people who have served as Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee (formal title: &quot;Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the Senate&quot;) since the current Tennessee State Constitution was adopted in 1870. The title of Lieutenant Governor was formally added in 1951; however, the speaker of the Senate has been the designated successor to the governor of Tennessee since Tennessee achieved statehood in 1796. Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey (who served 2007–2017) was the first Republican to hold this office since the adoption of the current constitution, all previous ones having been Democrats.

<doc id="898830" wikidata="Q1363254" url="?curid=898830" title="Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi">
<text>Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi (, 15 August 1948 – 24 December 2018) was an Iranian-Iraqi Twelver Shia cleric and conservative politician who was the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council from 14 August 2017 until his death on 24 December 2018. He was previously the Chief Justice of Iran from 1999 to 2009.

He was also an Iraqi citizen and a former member of the Islamic Dawa Party. Shahroudi&#x27;s official English-language biographical information from the Iranian Assembly of Experts&#x27; website opens with his education received in Najaf, Iraq from Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, the Islamic Dawa Party&#x27;s founder, and takes the view that al-Sadr was killed; al-Sadr was executed without trial by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime in April 1980. Hashemi Shahroudi became the leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, which caused objections to his serving as the Head of Iran&#x27;s Judiciary. He was a member of Iran&#x27;s Guardian Council.

Upon accepting his position as the Head of Iran&#x27;s Judiciary, Shahroudi proclaimed: &quot;I have inherited an utter ruin from the previous judiciary,&quot; referring to Mohammad Yazdi&#x27;s 10 years in office. He appointed Saeed Mortazavi, a well known fundamentalist and controversial figure, prosecutor general of Iran. Later when Mortazavi led the judiciary against Khatami&#x27;s reform movement, Shahroudi was prevented by regime hardliners from stopping Mortazavi&#x27;s violent acts against dissidents or removing him from power. In July 2011 Shahroudi was appointed by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to head an arbitration body to resolve an ongoing dispute between Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the parliament. He was a favorite as one of the potential successors of Ali Khamenei as Supreme Leader of Iran.

According to one of his former alleged students, Shahroudi was considered among the wealthiest of Shi&#x27;i scholars in Iran, having amassed a substantial multi-million dollar revenue generating income from an export-import business. In 2010, he declared himself a Marja&#x27;.

Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi was born in Najaf, Iraq to ethnic Persian parents. His father, Ali Hosseini Shahroudi was a scholar and teacher at the Najaf seminary and Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi completed elementary schooling at Najaf&#x27;s Alaviye school before going to seminary. Ayatollah Khomeini and Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr were his teachers in Najaf. When he came to Iran following the Iranian Revolution, he taught at Qom and Hassan Nasrallah, current Secretary General of the Lebanese political and paramilitary party Hezbollah, was one of his students.

==Political career==
===Before the Iranian Revolution===
In 1974, Ayatollah Shahroudi was imprisoned by the Ba&#x27;ath Party, due to political activities related to the Dawa Party.

===After the Iranian Revolution===

After the Iranian Revolution, Shahroudi moved to Iran. Ayatollah Shahroudi helped preserve the relationship between Ayatollah Khomeini and Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr, as well as relaying the messages of Marja in Najaf to Ayatollah Khomeini.
He was elected as a member of guardian council in 1995. Then he was appointed the head of the Judiciary in 1999.
In July 2011, Shahroudi was appointed by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to head an arbitration body to resolve an ongoing dispute between president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the parliament. The five-member body which Shahroudi headed is made up of &quot;hard-liners known for their opposition to any reforms within the ruling system&quot;, according to the Associated Press news agency. The appointment was seen as a move to sideline or weaken the past President of Iran Hashemi Rafsanjani who helmed the Expediency Council, a body set up to arbitrate disputes within the ruling system in the Islamic Republic. Rafsanjani had alienated Khamenei and the Islamic establishment with &quot;his tacit support&quot; for opposition to the controversial June 2009 presidential elections results that re-elected president Ahmadinejad.

Shahroudi denounced ISIL as a terrorist organization that commits the worst sins of killing people in the name of jihad. Shahroudi had also denounced ISIL for wrecking the infrastructure of civilizations and countries, and for committing murder.

==Appointment as Chief Justice==

===Career in juridical power===
After Ayatollah Khamenei became leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Yazdi served as the president of the Supreme Court. He remained in the post for many years before being replaced by Ayatollah Shahroudi.

===Prosecution of parliament members===

In 2001, the judiciary prosecuted several reformist members of parliament for speeches and activities they had carried out in their capacity as MPs. The Iranian constitution grants immunity to members of parliament during their tenure and the courts have no right to put MPs on trial for speeches given in parliament. The incident led to a major conflict between Iranian president Mohammad Khatami and Chief of Judiciary Shahroudi. In a letter, Khatami protested the courts&#x27; prosecution of MPs, insisting the act contravened the political immunity which the Iranian Constitution has provided for the deputies. The notice prompted Shahroudi to respond, calling Khatami&#x27;s letter &quot;a surprise.&quot; &quot;Since judges, according to the Constitution and ordinary laws as well as the jurisprudential principles, are independent in their interpretation of the law and issuing verdicts, nobody -- not even the judiciary chief -- has the right to impose its interpretation of the law on judges,&quot; Shahroudi said in part of his letter to President Khatami. Shahroudi denounced reformist MPs, stating they weakened parliament by defending &quot;westernized&quot; journalists and other liberals.

===Decriminalization Bill===

The Decriminalization Bill (Persian: تعيين مجازات‌های جايگزين) refers to a legal bill submitted by the Iranian Judiciary to the parliament. It aims at substituting imprisonment and execution by educational workshops and social penalties. The bill is considered one of the most important legal bills to have been prepared by the Iranian judiciary during Shahroudi&#x27;s tenure.

According to the bill, for all minor crimes, whose punishment is less than six months of imprisonment, imprisonment will be substituted with social penalties. This category of crimes include crimes related to traffic, environmental, medical, family, cultural and hunting offenses. The bill also demands that criminals undergo an educational or skill training course convened by the judiciary system.

The bill also addresses the crimes conducted by minors in the three age categories 7–12, 12-15 and 15–18 years old. It is reminiscent to the Iranian criminal law of 1925. According to the bill, minors can no longer be executed. The bill is based on several years of continuous discussion with religious scholars at the seminaries.

According to the bill, the crimes conducted by children of 7–12 years old are not punishable. For the 12-15 and 15-18 age ranges, imprisonment is replaced by mandatory training and education programs. For the age category of 15–18, execution is applied for crimes like murders if and only if the judge is confident that the criminals are mentally developed as adults and the crime is intentional and premeditated. However, both teenagers and young adults (older than 18) with low mental development, cannot be sentenced to death.

In 2009, the bill was approved by the judiciary commission of the Iranian parliament. The bill will be ratified after the approval of the parliament and the guardian council.
Shahroudi is most notable in the West for instituting Iran&#x27;s 2002 moratorium on stoning as a form of capital punishment. The penalty remains on the books however, leaving open the possibility that the moratorium could again be overturned as it was in 2006 and 2007.

===2009 Bill on Iran&#x27;s Bar Association===
In 2009, Shahroudi offered a bill to the Iranian parliament that targets the independence of Iran&#x27;s Bar Association. According to this bill, lawyers will be watched by the Iranian ministry of Intelligence and their credentials depend on the approval of the intelligence service.

===Restriction of media===
In 2009, Shahroudi issued an order to restrict people&#x27;s access to Iranian Satellite TV Channels and to prosecute staff of Satellite TV Channels whose opinion is not in line with that of the Islamic Republic. People who support these channels and Internet users who do not act according to the line of the constitution can be punished with up to five years of imprisonment.

==Illness and death==

Shahroudi was admitted to a Tehran hospital in May 2017 due to illness. Some other officials, including the Iranian Supreme leader Ali Khamenei, visited him. Shahroudi&#x27;s physician indicated that his surgery was for a &quot;fairly common digestive disorder&quot;. In January 2018, Shahroudi&#x27;s son announced that he had traveled abroad to continue the treatment but did not refer to the country in which the further treatment was sought. The &quot;Hannoversche Allgemeine&quot; newspaper reported on 4 January 2018 that Shahroudi was currently in the International Neuroscience Institute in Hannover, Germany.

The news agencies then confirmed the news, a photo of Shahroudi was published along with Majid Samii, who heads the center. Shahroudi’s presence draw a lot of criticism in Germany. The mass-circulation Bild daily’s front-page headline Monday read: “Death judge in Iran, luxury patient in Germany.” At the same time, many Iranians from Germany resorted to the Neurology Clinic. So from these protests and criticisms made to Samii, a physician and surgeon in the Iranian brain, conducted an interview with the BBC Persian Department, claiming that he was not aware of the policy because of his departure. A poster on Instagram wrote that &quot;Any medicine that treats a patient with sex, race, sexual orientation, politics, or any other component&quot;. 
 With the rise of protests, Volker Beck, a Green Party member and former German MP, reportedly sued Shahroudi on charges of &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;crimes against humanity.&quot; However, the complaint did not finally come to a close, and Shahroudi left Germany for two days in the territory two days later. He later announced in an interview that he had been insinuing doctors to Germany, and he himself had opposed it. &quot;Bild&quot; and &quot;Hannoversche Allgemeine&quot; newspapers have reported that Shahroudi had a brain tumor.

On 23 December 2018, it was reported by some Iranian media outlets that Shahroudi had died. However, the news was not confirmed by his family. His medicine team announced that Shahroudi was in a coma and that there was no hope for his recovery. On 22:04 IST of the following day, his death was announced. He was 70. A state funeral was held on 26 December in Tehran and he was buried at Fatima Masumeh Mosque in Qom.

==Criticism==
Shahroudi received criticism from a number of Iranian scholars and lawyers. Mostafa Mohaghegh Damad, a well-known Iranian scholar and expert on Islamic law, wrote a letter criticizing Shahroudi in August 2009.

<doc id="898838" wikidata="Q6239800" url="?curid=898838" title="John Hope (meteorologist)">
<text>John Raymond Hope (May 14, 1919 – June 13, 2002) was an American meteorologist who specialized in hurricane forecasting and was an on-air personality on The Weather Channel.

==Life history==
Born in Pennsylvania, Hope served as a flight navigator in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After returning to civilian life, Hope earned a degree in meteorology from the University of Illinois. In 2002, he died from complications of an open heart surgery.

==National Weather Service==
Hope worked as a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Memphis, Tennessee, for thirteen years. When astronaut John Glenn made his famous spaceflight in 1962, Hope served on the mission&#x27;s meteorological team. In 1968, Hope began working for the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. While at the center, Hope began receiving recognition for his technical achievements in hurricane forecasting. During this time, he developed a theorem commonly known as the John Hope Rule. It consists of two sub-theorems. One, that if a system is not a bona fide tropical storm before crossing the Windward Islands, or the Lesser Antilles, it will not survive the trek across the Eastern Caribbean Sea. If the wave is still present, formation in the Western Caribbean is possible. The second portion is, that if the structure of a wave or storm is good, never discount it or write it off.

==The Weather Channel==
After retiring from thirty two years with the National Weather Service, John Hope joined The Weather Channel when it was created in 1982. With his calm on-air demeanor, Hope became quickly recognized as The Weather Channel&#x27;s in-house hurricane expert. In 1989 when Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina, Hope spent several hours on the air warning the channel&#x27;s viewers of the approaching hurricane&#x27;s danger. Some credit Hope with saving lives during the storm due to his tireless on-air efforts. He would continue to appear on-air for the channel&#x27;s Tropical Updates until his death, by which time full-time duties had passed to Steve Lyons. Hope was interred at Riverside Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.

==Source of Camille name on hurricane naming list==
In 1969, Hope&#x27;s daughter Camille graduated from high school. Although &quot;Carol&quot; was assigned to the 1969 list of names, there was concern over reusing the retired name, as papers continued to be published about its 1954 incarnation. Dr. Banner Miller was impressed with Camille Hope&#x27;s high school project—which involved hurricane research—and asked John to add her name to the list of potential hurricane names that year. They had no way of knowing that the storm named after John Hope&#x27;s daughter – Camille – would become one of the most powerful and destructive hurricanes to ever hit the United States when it slammed into Mississippi as a Category five hurricane. Camille Hope is married to former U.S. Representative Jim Marshall of Georgia.

<doc id="898841" wikidata="Q5499932" url="?curid=898841" title="Free Muslim Coalition Against Terrorism">
<text>Free Muslims Coalition Against Terrorism (FMCAT) is an Islamic organization, with headquarters in Washington, D.C., made up of American Muslims and Arabs dedicated to taking a stand against terrorism. FMCAT is also known by the shorthand name of the &quot;Free Muslims Coalition&quot; or an even shorter name of &quot;Free Muslims&quot;. It is dedicated to combating extremism and support for terrorism among extremists.

It was formed in May 2004 by Kamal Nawash, a lawyer and Palestinian immigrant. Nawash has appeared on CNN, Al Jazeera, and the Fox News Channel. He has also appeared on TV shows including &quot;O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, as well as on Al-Arabiya and others.

==Antiterrorism focus==
In May 2005, the Free Muslims organized the first ever Muslim-led rally against terrorism. The rally was endorsed by more than 80 organizations and received substantial media coverage. Furthering this focus on terrorism, Muslims can report suspicious activity on the FMCAT website.

In June 2005, Nawash&#x27;s work with the Free Muslims was recognized by the U.S. government when the White House appointed him to represent the U.S. before the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Nawash addressed leaders of Europe and the former Soviet republics in a speech on tolerance at an international conference in Spain.

In addition, in March 2006 Nawash was invited to Jerusalem to advance an alternative approach to solving the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. In summary, Nawash argued that in light of the passionate claims both Palestinians and Israelis have for the same territory the only solution for them is to become equal citizens in a confederacy rather than splitting the territory into two sovereign states.

In a &quot;CNN&quot; interview in December 2006, he said: After 9/11 ... unfortunately, many of the Muslim organizations in [the U.S.], rather than recognize that we have is a problem with extremism and trying to deal with it, since we are the only ones who can deal with it, instead they took the role of victimization and took the role of ... of calling anyone who notices the obvious, that we have a problem with extremism, they accuse that person of being anti-Islam if they mention that. I think human beings in general would rather talk about how the world is against them, as opposed to talk about hey, we need to look inward. We have a problem.

Commenting in June 2009 on the radical Islam that some terrorists practice, Nawash said: &quot;It&#x27;s a ridiculous form of Islam&quot;. He noted that some converts, particularly those who have been incarcerated, practice &quot;the most extreme version of the religion&quot;, and have their own personal and political grievances.

In December 2011 the Ariel University Center of Samaria jointly with organization Free Muslims Coalition held a special conference, entitled &quot;Best Plans for a Peaceful Israel/Palestine&quot; conference.
The conference, the second of its kind, featured three Israeli and three Arab speakers, each of whom presented his idea for a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.

==Other views==
The Free Muslims Coalition has condemned the reaction of American Muslim organizations and Muslim governments to the unfavorable depiction of Muhammad in European newspapers. In contrast to other Muslim organizations, FMCAT maintains a neutral stance, neither pro-Palestine nor pro-Israel. In addition, it supports the dismantling and disarming of Hezbollah.

One of her first jobs on the scheme was making clothes for Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot;’ puppet characters. After arriving in New York with $600 to her name, Taylor was eventually hired by fashion designer Cynthia Rowley, under whom she worked for six years.

She débuted at New York Fashion Week as part of the Gen Art Styles competition in the late 1990s, before doing her own catwalk show in 1999.

In 2007, Taylor was inducted into the Massey University College of Creative Arts Hall of Fame.

In 2018, Taylor announced a move to Paris for a year.

==Personal life==
She is married to Wayne Pate, who was introduced to her via mutual friends. Her younger sister, Victoria Taylor, is a nationally known jewellery designer in Wellington, New Zealand, and débuted her Tory Jewellery Company range at one of Rebecca Taylor&#x27;s catwalk shows in New York.

<doc id="898848" wikidata="Q7274181" url="?curid=898848" title="R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd">
<text>R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd &quot;(Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada v Big M Drug Mart Ltd)&quot; is a landmark decision by Supreme Court of Canada where the Court struck down the federal &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot; for violating section 2 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. This case had many firsts in constitutional law including being the first to interpret section two.

== Background ==

In 1978, Nancy Lockhart and Michael Lasrado opened Big M Drug Mart, a supermarket in the Forest Lawn community in Calgary. Big M and other stores remained open on Sundays despite the prohibition in the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot; as revenue exceeded the small fines of between $15–$40 ($–$ in ).

On Sunday, May 30, 1982, Calgary police officers entered Big M Drug Mart and observed the sale of groceries, plastic cups, and a bicycle lock to customers in contravention of the federal &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot;. At the Provincial Court of Alberta, Justice Brian Stevenson acquitted Big M Drug Mart and found the legislation unconstitutional under section 2 of the Charter, striking down section 4 of the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot;. At the Alberta Court of Appeal, the 3—2 majority written by Justice James Herbert Laycraft and concurred with by Justices Milt Harradence and William Stevenson upheld the Provincial Court&#x27;s acquittal. The dissent by Justice R. Paul Belzil and concurred with by Chief Justice William A. McGillivray relied on the 1963 Supreme Court of Canada judgement in &quot;Robertson and Rosetanni&quot;, finding section 4 of the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot; did not violate the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;.

The constitutional question put before the Court was whether the Act infringed the right to freedom of conscience and religion, if so, whether it is justified under section 1 of the &quot;Charter&quot;, and whether the Act was &quot;intra vires&quot; (&quot;within&quot;) Parliament&#x27;s criminal power under section 91(27) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;.

== Ruling ==
The Supreme Court ruled that the statute was an unconstitutional violation of section 2 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, deciding that there was no true secular basis for the legislation and its only purpose was, in effect, to establish a state religious-based requirement, and was therefore invalid. The drug store&#x27;s victory was made possible by section 52 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, which provides that unconstitutional laws can be found invalid, as opposed to section 24 of the &quot;Charter&quot;, which is for those whose rights are violated. In as much as a corporation is not a natural person, it cannot have a religion and therefore the &quot;corporation&quot;&#x27;s religious freedom was not violated.

In that case, Chief Justice Brian Dickson wrote that this freedom at least includes freedom of religious speech, including &quot;the right to entertain such religious beliefs as a person chooses, the right to declare religious beliefs openly and without fear of hindrance or reprisal, and the right to manifest religious belief by worship and practice or by teaching and dissemination.&quot; Freedom of religion would also prohibit imposing religious requirements.

The &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot; was the first law in &quot;Charter&quot; jurisprudence to be struck down in its entirety, and some of the section 1 analysis in the decision played a role in developing the &quot;Oakes test&quot; in the later case &quot;R v Oakes&quot;.

<text>Kelvin John Lancaster (10 December 1924 – 23 July 1999) was an Australian mathematical economist and John Bates Clark professor of economics at Columbia University. He is best known for the development of the Theory of the Second Best with Richard Lipsey. Lancaster was also active in developing the calculus of qualitative economics, formulating the household production function, and applying the hedonic model to the estimation of housing prices.

In a 1966 paper, Lancaster developed what he called a &quot;new theory of consumer demand&quot;, in which the then standard microeconomic demand theory was modified by stipulating that what consumers are seeking to acquire is not goods themselves (e.g. cars or train journeys) but the characteristics they contain (e.g. transport from A to B, display of fashion sense). As Palda (2013) explains

This theory provides a convenient account of the difference between less developed (so called &quot;primitive&quot;) consumption economies, in which there are fewer goods than characteristics, and more developed (&quot;sophisticated&quot;) consumption economies, in which there are more goods than characteristics, so that consumers can secure any combination of characteristics they desire, subject only to budget constraints. It also provides a way of predicting demand for new commodities, so long as they do not embody any new characteristics.

According to economist Jagdish Bhagwati, &quot;He was widely regarded as a potential recipient of the Nobel Prize, for the notable impact that had been made by his contributions to the theory of second best and the integration of variety into economic theory. He joins the list of extraordinary economists such as Joan Robinson, Roy Harrod, and Mancur Olson whom death deprived of this singular honor.&quot;

Lancaster attended Sydney Boys High School, graduating in 1940.

<doc id="898850" wikidata="Q456569" url="?curid=898850" title="Walafrid Strabo">
<text>Walafrid, alternatively spelt Walahfrid, nicknamed [[Strabo (disambiguation)|Strabo]] (or Strabus, i.e. &quot;squint-eyed&quot;) (c. 80818 August 849), was an Alemannic Benedictine monk and theological writer who lived on Reichenau Island in southern Germany.

==Life==
Walafrid Strabo was born about 805 in Swabia. He was educated at Reichenau Abbey, where he had for his teachers Tatto and Wetti, to whose visions he devotes one of his poems. Then he went on to the monastery of Fulda, where he studied for some time under Rabanus Maurus before returning to Reichenau, of which monastery he was made abbot in 838.

For unclear reasons, he was expelled from his house and went to Speyer. According to his own verses, it seems that the real cause of his flight was that, notwithstanding the fact that he had been tutor to Charles the Bald, he espoused the side of his elder brother Lothair I on the death of Louis the Pious in 840. He was, however, restored to his monastery in 842, and died in 849 on an embassy to his former pupil. His epitaph was written by Rabanus Maurus, whose elegiacs praise him for being the faithful guardian of his monastery.

==Works==
Walafrid Strabo&#x27;s works are theological, historical and poetical.

===Theological works===
There is an exposition of the first 20 psalms (published by Pez. in &quot;Thes. Anecdota nova&quot;, iv.) and an epitome of Rabanus Maurus&#x27;s commentary on Leviticus. An &quot;Expositio quatuor Evangeliorum&quot; is also ascribed to Walafrid.
His &quot;De exordiis et incrementis quarundam in observationibus ecclesiasticis rerum&quot; was written between 840 and 842 for Reginbert the Librarian. It deals in 32 chapters with ecclesiastical usages, churches, altars, prayers, bells, pictures, baptism and the Holy Communion. Incidentally, he introduces into his explanations the current German expressions for the things he is treating of, with the apology that Solomon had set him the example by keeping monkeys as well as peacocks at his court.

In his exposition of the Mass, Walafrid does not enter into the dispute over the doctrine of transubstantiation as taught by his famous contemporary Radbertus. Walafrid merely notes that Christ handed on to his disciples the sacraments of his Body and Blood in the substance of bread and wine (as opposed to the many and various sacrifices of the Old Covenant/Testament) and taught them to celebrate them, under what Walafrid regards as these most fitting appearances (&quot;speciebus&quot;), as a memorial of his Passion (see ch. XVI, &quot;De sacrificiis Novi Testamenti, et cur mutata sint per Christum sacrificia&quot;). He leaves no doubt, referring to Christ&#x27;s words in John 6 (&quot;My flesh truly is food and my blood truly is drink&quot;), that the Eucharist is &quot;truly the body and blood of the Lord&quot; (see Ch. XVII).

In the last chapter, Walafrid describes a hierarchical body of both lay and ecclesiastical officers, using Pauline metaphors (1 Cor 12:11-27) to underline the importance of such a body as an organic unity. In so doing, he articulates a view on the nature of public office, ideally based on a sense of responsibility with respect to society as a whole. While Johannes Fried is wary of associating this idealised scheme too much with current ideas about state and court in Louis&#x27; reign, Karl Ferdinand Werner and Stuart Airlie are rather more sympathetic to its relevance for contemporary thought at court: what gives the text added interest is that it was written by a courtier (Walafrid), representing a &quot;view from the centre&quot;.

===Historical and poetical works===
Walafrid&#x27;s chief historical works are the rhymed &quot;Vita sancti Galli&quot; (The Life of Saint Gall), which, though written down nearly two centuries after this saint&#x27;s death, is still the primary authority for his life, and a much shorter life of Saint Othmar, abbot of St. Gall (died 759).

Walafrid&#x27;s poetical works also include a short life of Saint Blathmac, a high-born monk of Iona, murdered by the Danes in the first half of the 9th century; a life of Saint Mammes; and a &quot;Liber de visionibus Wettini&quot;. This last poem, written in hexameters like the two preceding ones, was composed at the command of &quot;Father&quot; Adalgisus and was based upon a prose narrative by Haito, abbot of Reichenau from 806 to 822. It is dedicated to Grimald, brother of Wetti, his teacher. As Walafrid tells his audience, he was only eighteen when he sent it, and he begs his correspondent to revise his verses, because, &quot;as it is not lawful for a monk to hide anything from his abbot&quot;, he fears he may deserve to be beaten. In the vision, Wettin saw Charlemagne suffering torture in Purgatory because of his sexual incontinence. The name of the ruler alluded to is not directly stated in the text, but &quot;Carolus Imperator&quot; form the initial letters of the relevant passage. Many of Walafrid&#x27;s other poems are, or include, short addresses to kings and queens (Lothar I, Charles, Louis, Pippin, Judith, etc.) and to friends (Einhard; Grimald; Rabanus Maurus; Tatto; Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims; Drogo, bishop of Metz; etc.).

His most famous poem is the &quot;Liber de cultura hortorum&quot; which was later published as the &quot;Hortulus&quot;, dedicated to Grimald. It is an account of a little garden in Reichenau Island that he used to tend with his own hands, and is largely made up of descriptions of the various herbs he grows there and their medicinal and other uses, including beer brewing. Sage holds the place of honor; then comes rue, the antidote of poisons; and so on through melons, fennel, lilies, poppies, and many other plants, to wind up with the rose, &quot;which in virtue and scent surpasses all other herbs, and may rightly be called the flower of flowers.&quot;

The poem &quot;De Imagine Tetrici&quot; takes the form of a dialogue; it was inspired by an equestrian statue depicting a nude emperor on horseback believed to be Theodoric the Great which stood in front of Charlemagne&#x27;s palace at Aachen.

Codex Sangallensis 878 may be Walafrid&#x27;s personal &quot;breviarium&quot;, begun when he was a student at Fulda.

===Ascribed works===
Johannes Trithemius, Abbot of Sponheim (1462–1516), credited him with the authorship of the &quot;Glossa Ordinaria&quot; or &quot;Ordinary Glosses&quot; on the Bible. The work dates, however, from the 12th century, but Trithemius&#x27; erroneous ascription remained current well into the 20th century. The work is now attributed to Anselm of Laon and his followers.

<text>A fashion week is a week-long fashion industry event where fashion designers, brands, or &quot;houses&quot; display their latest collections in runway fashion shows to buyers and the media which influences upcoming fashion trends for the current and approaching seasons.

The most prominent fashion weeks are held in the fashion capitals of the world—in chronological order, New York City, London, Milan, and Paris, or the &quot;Big Four&quot;. The consecutive fashion weeks of the Big Four are referred to as fashion month.

The foundations of fashion week began in Paris in the late 1800s before spreading to New York, Milan, and London in the 20th century. What began as marketing garments in public spaces like racetracks grew into highly publicized events in themselves. In the 2000s, themes of sustainability began emerging at fashion weeks and grew popular across the next decade.

Fashion weeks in recent years have reflected a faster &quot;retail cycle&quot; with &quot;see now, buy-now&quot; and &quot;in-season&quot; fashion shows. Event organizers have proposed combining the collections for one season or men and women&#x27;s wear shows to reduce the carbon emissions associated with these events.

== History ==
One of history&#x27;s first signs of a fashion week, or seasonal collection, can be traced back to fashion designer Charles Frederick Worth during the late 1800s. The concept of the fashion week began in Paris, when marketers used to hire women to wear couture items in public places, from racetracks to beauty salons. These parades gradually became social events of their own. In France, runway shows are still called &quot;défilés de mode&quot; which when translated literally means &quot;fashion shows&quot; or &quot;fashion parades.&quot; A style show is an occasion placed on by a style planner to exhibit their forthcoming line of dress as well as embellishments during Fashion Week. Style shows debut each season, especially the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter seasons.

The first Paris Fashion Week was due to the work of designer Paul Poiret. Poiret was known as the King of Fashion and led the fashion world in the first decade of the 20th century. He wished to present his designs on live mobile bodies. Poiret decided that to make this idea a reality he would combine socializing and shopping by throwing multiple galas featuring his pieces. Guests were asked to dress in their best clothing to align with his lavish designs. As the shows continued they became less of a large affair and the invitations became more individualized. Fashion houses began to dress models in their collections in front of client-only guests. Unlike modern-day fashion shows photographers were prohibited due to tensions regarding copied designs.

The formation of the Fédération Française de la Couture marked the first official Paris Fashion Week in 1973. The show opened with the tension-building Battle of Versailles Fashion Show that displayed the famed battle between Paris and New York Fashion. The battle was set between five of the top French designers and five American designers with no famous backing.

In 1903, a Manhattan shop called Ehrich Brothers put on what is thought to have been the country&#x27;s first fashion show to lure middle-class women into the store. By 1910, many big department stores were holding shows of their own. It is likely that American retailers saw the &quot;fashion parades&quot; in couture salons and decided to use the idea. These &quot;parades&quot; effectively promoted stores and improved their status. By the 1920s, the &quot;fashion show&quot; had been used by retailers across the country. They were staged, and often held in the shop&#x27;s restaurant during lunch or teatime. These shows were usually more theatrical than those of today, heavily based upon a single theme, and accompanied by a narrative commentary.

On July 19 in 1943, the first-ever &quot;fashion week,&quot; New York Fashion Week, was held to give fashion buyers alternatives to French fashion during World War II, when workers in the fashion industry were unable to travel to Paris. Fashion shows were hugely popular, enticing crowds in their thousands – crowds so large, that stores in New York in the 1950s had to obtain a license to have live models. Until 1994, shows were held in different locations, such as hotels, or lofts. From 1994 to 2009, the event was held in a tent at Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library. Lincoln Center was the Fashion Week venue from 2010 to 2015, after which it moved to Clarkson Square, an events venue in SoHo in Manhattan. After 2017, Clarkson Square was abandoned for a decentralized format.

=== Sustainability ===
Before mainstream fashion events like fashion week began incorporating sustainable fashion, brands like Patagonia practiced sustainability by designing garments out of recycled materials. The Copenhagen Fashion Summit was then established in 2009 to discuss social and environmental issues facing the fashion industry. Designers were called on to cut their total number of collections per year in exchange for more durable garments which extended lifespan and minimized waste. Similarly, buyers were encouraged to purchase fewer longer lasting pieces. These informal initiatives stimulate a circular economy.

In 2014, the Connect4Climate trust fund (owned by the World Bank Group)financed the “Sustainability Dialogues in the Design Industry” initiative at Milan Fashion Week to create opportunities for pioneering young designers. At London Fashion Week in 2017, Vivienne Westwood and the Mayor of London created the &quot;Fashion Switch&quot; initiative to support UK brands transitioning to renewable energy. In Asia, mindful fashion and conscious designer labels were promoted at Lakme Fashion Week 2018. Connect4Climate also launched “X-Ray Fashion,” a virtual reality experience exploring the relationship between climate change and the fashion industry. In the next year, brands like H&amp;M, Burberry, and Zara followed in Patagonia’s footsteps and started producing garments with sustainably sourced materials.

In 2019, initiatives like the “Fashion Pact” and “Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action” articulated goals for the fashion industry around green energy, material use, and supply chain modernization to reduce carbon emissions. At London Fashion Week, the British Fashion Council promoted upcycling and remanufacturing by featuring new sustainable brands in designer showrooms. Influential brands like Chanel and Dolce &amp; Gabbana showcased sustainable design in the Spring and Summer 2020 collections as well. The same year, Gabriella Hearst organized New York Fashion Week’s first carbon neutral fashion show. She offset emissions, booked models already in the area, and hired caterers who used local ingredients. In May, designer Richard Marlone won the 2020 International Woolmark Prize for his radical ideas in sustainable development. Lakme Fashion Week also launched the Circular Design Challenge, the first sustainable fashion award in India.

Since 2021, advocacy groups have both attended and disrupted London Fashion Week and other major shows while calling for environmental and labor protections in the fashion industry. Organizers of Copenhagen Fashion Week 2023 set 18 minimum standards for the brands participating, an unprecedented decision. For example, seat cards and set pieces had to be recyclable, fur on garments was banned, and designs had to be 50% recycled material. Implementation of these rules was left up to the interpretation of designers, resulting in some variation due to the phrasing. Fashion week executives framed the standards as a transitional step to fully sustainable collections.

==About==
Although there are many notable fashion weeks around the world, only four are known as the &quot;Big Four&quot;: in chronological order, New York, London, Milan, and Paris. Paris began holding couture shows in 1945, Milan Fashion Week was founded by the Italian Chamber of Commerce in 1958, Paris Fashion Week was further organized in 1973 under the French Fashion Federation, and London Fashion Week was founded by the British Fashion Council in 1984. Although these key organizations still organize the main shows, there are independent events and producers in all cities, as well. Other notable fashion weeks are held in Copenhagen, Berlin, Madrid, São Paulo, Shanghai, and Tokyo.

=== Timing ===
The &quot;Big Four&quot; refers to fashion weeks which happen twice a year in the major fashion capitals of the world; New York, London, Milan, and Paris.

Traditionally, fashion weeks were held several months in advance of the season to allow the press and buyers a chance to preview fashion designs for the following season. In February and March, designers showcased their autumn and winter collections. In September and October, designers showcased their spring and summer collections.

This timing was largely created to follow the then slower &quot;retail cycle.&quot; In other words, it allowed time for retailers to purchase and incorporate the designers into their retail marketing. However, as customer expectations have increased, the retail cycle has increased. As a result, in 2016, designers started moving to &quot;in-season shows.&quot;

===See now, buy now===
In recent years, shows have begun to feature garments that are available for sale immediately, online or in stores. The other move has been to &quot;see now, buy now&quot; shows, often featuring clickable video, where looks are available online immediately following, or even during the show. &quot;See now, buy now&quot; experiences have included shows from Tom Ford, Nicole Miller, Moschino and Tommy Hilfiger. In the 2019 Tommy x Zendaya show, Hilfiger commented on the innovation of the &quot;see now, buy now&quot; concept. However, the French Federation of Fashion has not accepted the call to incorporate it as of 2017. The advent of &quot;see now, buy now&quot; shopping has also come about in response to so-called &quot;fast fashion&quot; retailers, who copy designs from the runway and bring them to retail faster than traditional design houses.

=== Environmental costs ===
Since fashion weeks were established, approximately 241,000 tons of CO2 have been released each year from attending the &quot;Big Four&quot; and major trade shows. Buyers and sellers generate emissions and waste from air travel, accommodations, ground transportation, and fashion shows. 37% of total CO2 emissions are attributed to New York Fashion Week. The carbon footprint of the average global citizen is a fraction of the average professional buyer&#x27;s from traveling approximately 19,213 km every year. On flights in business class, they generate up to 30% more CO2 emissions per person if the ratio of business seats to economy seats in each plane is taken into consideration. It is unrealistic for event organizers to ask guests to fly in economy class, take trains, or share accommodation, but paper invitations and plastic water bottles at events have become obsolete. Organizers for fashion week and other major events have also proposed combining all the collections for one season, displaying men and women’s wear at the same event, and establishing fashion “districts” in fashion capitals like New York to minimize traffic congestion during fashion week. Practicing sustainability at fashion week encourages sustainable development in the fashion industry because it reflects and influences major trends and market demand.

<text>Paschasius Radbertus (785–865) was a Carolingian theologian and the abbot of Corbie, a monastery in Picardy founded in 657 or 660 by the queen regent Bathilde with a founding community of monks from Luxeuil Abbey. His most well-known and influential work is an exposition on the nature of the Eucharist written around 831, entitled &quot;De Corpore et Sanguine Domini&quot;. He was canonized in 1073 by Pope Gregory VII. His feast day is 26 April.

His works are edited in &quot;Patrologia Latina&quot; vol. 120 (1852) and his important tract on the Eucharist and transubstantiation, &quot;De Corpore et Sanguine Domini&quot;, in a 1969 edition by B. Paulus, published by Brepols (Corpus Christianorum, Continuatio Mediaevalis 16).

==Life==
Paschasius was an orphan left on the steps of the convent of Notre-Dame de Soissons. He was raised by the nuns there, and became very fond of the abbess, Theodrara. Theodrara was sister of Adalard of Corbie and Wala of Corbie, two monks whom he admired greatly. At a fairly young age, Paschasius left the convent to serve as a monk under Abbot Adalard, at Corbie. There he also met Wala, Adalard&#x27;s brother and successor.

Through the abbotship of both Adalard and Wala, Paschasius focused on the monastic life, spending his time studying and teaching. In 822 he accompanied abbot Adalard into Saxony for the purpose of founding the monastery of New Corvey in Westphalia. When Adalard died in 826, Paschasius helped ensure Wala would become Abbot in his place. After Wala&#x27;s death in 836 Heddo became abbot. Ratramnus, who may have held the position of teaching master, held opposing views to Paschasius on a number of ecclesiastical issues. Ratramnus wrote a refutation of Paschasius&#x27; treatise on the Eucharist, &quot;De Corpore et Sanguine Domini&quot;, using the same title.

In 843 Paschasius succeeded Abbot Isaac; however, he resigned his title ten years later to return to his studies. He left Corbie for the nearby monastery of Saint-Riquier, where he lived in voluntary exile for some years. Why he resigned is unknown, but it is likely that his actions were motivated by factional disputes within his monastic community; misunderstandings between himself and the younger monks were likely factors in his decision. He returned to Corbie late in life, and resided in his old monastery until his death in 865.

Paschasius&#x27; body was first buried at the Church of St. John in Corbie. After numerous reported miracles, the Pope ordered his remains to be removed, and interred in the Church of St. Peter, Corbie.

==Writings==

===&quot;De Corpore et Sanguine Domini&quot;===
The most well-known and influential work of Paschasius, &quot;De Corpore et Sanguine Domini&quot; (written between 831 and 833), is an exposition on the nature of the Eucharist. It was originally written as an instructional manual for the monks under his care at Corbie, and is the first lengthy treatise on the sacrament of the Eucharist in the Western world. In it, Paschasius agrees with Ambrose in affirming that the Eucharist contains the true, historical body of Jesus Christ. According to Paschasius, God is truth itself, and therefore, his words and actions must be true. Christ&#x27;s proclamation at the Last Supper that the bread and wine were his body and blood must be taken literally, since God is truth. He thus believes that the transubstantiation of the bread and wine offered in the Eucharist really occurs. Only if the Eucharist is the actual body and blood of Christ can a Christian know it is salvific.

Paschasius believed that the presence of the historical blood and body of Christ allows the partaker a real union with Jesus in a direct, personal, and physical union by joining a person&#x27;s flesh with Christ&#x27;s and Christ&#x27;s flesh with his. To Paschasius, the Eucharist&#x27;s transformation into the flesh and blood of Christ is possible because of the principle that God is truth; God is able to manipulate nature, as he created it. The book was given to Charles the Bald, the Frankish king, as a present in 844, with the inclusion of a special introduction. The view Paschasius expressed in this work was met with some hostility; Ratramnus wrote a rebuttal by the same name, by order of Charles the Bald, who did not agree with some of the views Paschasius held. Ratramnus believed that the Eucharist was strictly metaphorical; he focused more on the relationship between faith and the newly emerging science. Shortly thereafter, a third monk joined the debate, Rabanus Maurus, which initiated the Carolingian Eucharist Controversy. Ultimately, however, the king accepted Paschasius&#x27; assertion, and the substantial presence of Christ in the Eucharist became the authoritative belief in the Roman Catholic faith.

===&quot;Vitae Adalhardi et Walae&quot;===
Written in 826 and 836, respectively, &quot;Vita Adalhardi&quot; and &quot;Vita Walae&quot; are spiritual biographies of Paschasius&#x27; role-models. They are personal tributes, written for the memory of two fathers, and the patterns of life depicted in them are intended to be followed.

&quot;Vita Adalhardi&quot; is rather brief; it is a fairly conventional representation of a saint&#x27;s life. However, the style that Paschasius uses is unique for the time in which it was written. Written in mourning for the loss of his friend, Paschasius compares Adalard to the painter Zeuxis. As described by Cicero, artists study models to perfect their art; Zeuxis&#x27; challenge was to paint the woman, Helen of Troy. Paschasius states that just as Zeuxis studied forms in order to perfect his art, so too does Adalard in trying to reform the image of God in himself. In making this comparison, Paschasius was identified with being a humanistic writer of the Carolingian period, as he compared classic and ancient literature with contemporary literature. Paschasius depicts Adalard as a mirror image of Christ, emphasizing the elements of infinite love and descent into suffering. He also parallels Adalard&#x27;s role in the church to that of a mother, which is a concept attributed to Cistercian spirituality in the 12th century, three hundred years after Paschasius&#x27; death. The grief felt over the death of Adalard is extremely strong in the book – although Paschasius knows that suffering should give way to joy, as depicted by his forefathers, such as Jerome, Paschasius&#x27; grief for the loss of his friend surpassed that of his literary models. This style of writing is also not seen elsewhere prior to the 12th century. Paschasius&#x27; justification of excess mourning is his most distinctive contribution to the tradition of consolation literature.

&quot;Vita Walae&quot; is much longer (about twice as long as &quot;Vita Adalhardi&quot;), and is structured as a dialogue. In total, there are eight characters represented, presumably monks of Corbie. These characters are given pseudonyms, probably nor with the intention of masking identities. It is more likely that these pseudonyms were employed to further support Paschasius&#x27; interpretation of Wala, as the names were taken from classical texts. Phrases and passages from a variety of sources are woven into the text (Acts of St. Sebastien, The Book of Job, various comedies of Terence). Although not displaying information about Wala, these additions reflect Paschasius&#x27; own beliefs and his skill at writing. While &quot;Vita Adalhardi&quot; was written to be in part a funeral eulogy, &quot;Vita Walae&quot; was written as a (fairly) accurate depiction of Wala. Paschasius used sources in writing this biography, a handbook written by Wala, and treatises of the time, probably to show his own views through his depiction of Wala.

===Other works===
Paschasius has an extensive collection of works, including many exegeses on various books of the Bible. He wrote commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew, Lamentations, and an exposition of Psalm 45, which he dedicated to the nuns at St. Mary at Soissons. &quot;De Partu Virginis&quot;, written for his friend Emma, Abbess of St. Mary at Soissons and daughter of Theodrara, describes the lifestyle of nuns. He also wrote a treatise, titled &quot;De Nativitae Sanctae Mariae&quot;, regarding the nature of the Virgin Mary and the birth of Jesus Christ. Paschasius probably wrote much more, but none of it has survived through the centuries. Paschasius wrote a commentary on &quot;Revelation&quot;.

==Theological contributions==

===Understanding of the human body===
In opposition to other Carolingian authors, Paschasius locates the &quot;Imago Dei&quot; (the &quot;Image of God&quot;) in the whole human being – body as well as soul. This view is in alignment with that of the second-century Church Father Irenaeus. Irenaeus believed that Jesus was the physical embodiment of God; the son is the image of the father. As such, humans represent the image of God not only in soul, but in flesh as well. This view is in opposition to the more accepted view of Origen of Alexandria, who believed that the physical body had no part in the image-relationship. Unlike other theologians of the time, Paschasius does not equate the sanctification process with a metaphysical detachment of the body and the soul. Instead, he believes that the human condition (existing in a physical form) can contribute positively to achieving sanctification. However, he did believe in a form of mitigated dualism, in which the soul plays a larger part in the process than the body. Paschasius believes that life is an opportunity to practice for death; however, the concept that the body is a prison for the soul is practically non-existent in his work, and probably only occurs due to pressure from his peers. Even though he believed that the body has a role in one&#x27;s sanctification process, he also acknowledged that flesh struggles against God, and thus has the ability to be corrupted.

===Understanding of Christ&#x27;s body===
Paschasius believed in a distinction between &quot;veritas&quot; (truth) and &quot;figura&quot; (form, or appearance). Christ&#x27;s descent from heaven to earth was a declension from truth to appearance, from the realm of perfection to the realm of imperfection. This would imply that Jesus in flesh is false, and imperfect; however, Paschasius asserted that not every figure is false. Christ is simultaneously both truth and figure because his external, physical self is the figure of the truth, the physical manifestation of the truth that exists in the soul. The person that was Jesus was subject to human needs, just like the rest of humanity. He required to eat, to sleep, and to be in company with others. In addition to this, however, he also performed miracles. These behaviours which Jesus exhibited imply a duality in the concept of &quot;Word made flesh&quot;. Miracles, until then only performed by God, the non-physical Truth or Word, were suddenly performed by a physical human being. The relationship between Jesus&#x27; humanity and his divinity is rather convoluted; however, it is analogous to the relation of figures (written letters) of words to their spoken counterparts. Therefore, Jesus in physical form is the visual representation, T-R-U-T-H, while his divinity is the spoken sound of those written letters together as a word.

<text>The Tennessee Walking Horse or Tennessee Walker is a breed of gaited horse known for its unique four-beat running-walk and flashy movement. It was originally developed as a riding horse on farms and plantations in the American South. It is a popular riding horse due to its calm disposition, smooth gaits and sure-footedness. The Tennessee Walking Horse is often seen in the show ring, but is also popular as a pleasure and trail riding horse using both English and Western equipment. Tennessee Walkers are also seen in movies, television, and other entertainment.

The breed was developed beginning in the late 18th century when Narragansett Pacers and Canadian Pacers from the eastern United States were crossed with gaited Spanish Mustangs from Texas. Other breeds were later added, and in 1886 a foal named Black Allan was born. He is now considered the foundation sire of the breed. In 1935 the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders&#x27; Association was formed, and it closed the studbook in 1947.

In 1939, the first Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration was held. In the early 21st century, this annual event attracted considerable attention and controversy because of issues linked to abuse of horses that was practiced to enhance their performance in the show ring.

The two basic categories of Tennessee Walking Horse show competition are called &quot;flat-shod&quot; and &quot;performance&quot;, distinguished by desired leg action. Flat-shod horses, wearing regular horseshoes, exhibit less exaggerated movement. Performance horses are shod with built-up pads or &quot;stacks&quot;, along with other weighted action devices, creating the so-called &quot;Big Lick&quot; style. The United States Equestrian Federation and some breed organizations now prohibit the use of stacks and action devices at shows they sanction.

In addition, the Tennessee Walking Horse is the breed most affected by the Horse Protection Act of 1970. It prohibits the practice of soring, abusive practices which can be used to enhance the Big Lick movement prized in the show ring. Despite the law, some horses are still being abused. The controversy over continuing soring practices has led to a split within the breed community, criminal charges against a number of individuals, and the creation of separate breed organizations. Congressional legislation to strengthen the Act has been introduced with broad support, but has yet to be enacted.

== Breed characteristics ==

The modern Tennessee Walking Horse is described as &quot;refined and elegant, yet solidly built&quot;. It is a tall horse with a long neck. The head is well-defined, with small, well-placed ears. The breed averages high and . The shoulders and hip are long and sloping, with a short back and strong coupling. The hindquarters are of &quot;moderate thickness and depth&quot;, well-muscled, and it is acceptable for the hind legs to be slightly over-angulated, cow-hocked or sickle-hocked.

They are found in all solid colors, and several pinto patterns. Common colors such as bay, black and chestnut are found, as are colors caused by dilution genes such as the dun, champagne, cream and silver dapple genes. Pinto patterns include overo, sabino and tobiano.

The Tennessee Walking Horse has a reputation for having a calm disposition and a naturally smooth riding gait. While the horses are famous for flashy movement, they are popular for trail and pleasure riding as well as show.

The Tennessee Walking Horse is best known for its running-walk. This is a four-beat gait with the same footfall pattern as a regular, or flat, walk, but significantly faster. While a horse performing a flat walk moves at , the running walk allows the same horse to travel at . In the running walk, the horse&#x27;s rear feet overstep the prints of its front feet by , with a longer overstep being more prized in the Tennessee Walking Horse breed. While performing the running walk, the horse nods its head in rhythm with its gait. Besides the flat and running walks, the third main gait performed by Tennessee Walking Horses is the canter. Some members of the breed perform other variations of lateral ambling gaits, including the rack, stepping pace, fox trot and single-foot, which are allowable for pleasure riding but penalized in the show ring. A few Tennessee Walking Horses can trot, and have a long, reaching stride.

=== Health ===
Some Tennessee Walking Horses may be affected by the following genetic conditions:
*Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB2) is a heritable genetic condition that has been found in some Tennessee Walking Horses. It is a recessive missense mutation in the &quot;GRM6&quot; gene and is believed to inhibit the ability of the ON-bipolar cell to uptake glutamate. CSNB is characterized by an inability to see in low light conditions. Horses may also be reluctant to move at night and may struggle to find food and water. It is a non-progressive condition that is present from birth. No treatment is available, however management strategies, such as leaving a light on at night can be used to assist affected animals. The allele frequency of CSNB2 in Tennessee Walking Horses is reported to be about 10%, horses homozygous for CSNB2 are affected, while a significantly larger number of animals heterozygous for the condition are unaffected carriers. Genetic testing is available to aid in diagnosis, management, and breeding decisions.
*Type 1 Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy (PSSM1), a muscle disease which also affects several other breeds. It results in the abnormal accumulation of glycogen, leading to a breakdown of muscle fibers (Equine exertional rhabdomyolysis), causing muscle pain, weakness, skin twitching, sweating, and reluctance to move. 
*Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome an X-linked recessive condition which affects male horses, where external genitalia fails to develop the animal is sterile.

== History ==

The Tennessee Walker originated from the cross of Narragansett Pacer and Canadian Pacer horses brought from Kentucky to Tennessee starting in 1790, with gaited Spanish Mustangs imported from Texas. These horses were bred on the limestone pastures of Middle Tennessee, and became known as &quot;Tennessee Pacers&quot;. Originally used as all-purpose horses on plantations and farms, they were used for riding, pulling and racing. They were known for their smooth gaits and sure-footedness on the rocky Tennessee terrain. Over the years, Morgan, Standardbred, Thoroughbred and American Saddlebred blood was also added to the breed.

In 1886, Black Allan (later known as Allan F-1) was born. By the stallion Allendorf (from the Hambletonian family of Standardbreds) and out of a Morgan mare named Maggie Marshall, he became the foundation sire of the Tennessee Walking Horse breed. A failure as a trotting horse, due to his insistence on pacing, Black Allan was instead used for breeding. From his line, a foal named Roan Allen was born in 1904. Able to perform several ambling gaits, Roan Allen became a successful show horse, and in turn sired several famous Tennessee Walking Horses.

The Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders&#x27; Association was formed in 1935. To reflect interest in showing horses, the name was changed in 1974 to the current Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders&#x27; and Exhibitors&#x27; Association (TWHBEA). The stud book was closed in 1947, meaning that since that date every Tennessee Walker must have both its dam and stud registered in order to be eligible for registration. In 1950, the United States Department of Agriculture recognized the Tennessee Walking Horse as a distinct breed.

In 2000, the Tennessee Walking Horse was named the official state horse of the US state of Tennessee. It is the third most-common breed in Kentucky, behind the Thoroughbred and the American Quarter Horse. As of 2005, 450,000 horses have been registered over the life of the TWHBEA, with annual registrations of 13,000–15,000 new foals. While the Tennessee Walking Horse is most common in the southern and southeastern US, it is found throughout the country.

== Uses ==

The Tennessee Walker is noted for its appearance in horse show events, particularly performances in saddle seat-style English riding equipment, but is also a very popular trail riding horse. Some are used for endurance riding. To promote this use, the TWHBEA maintains an awards program in conjunction with the American Endurance Ride Conference.

In the 20th century, the Tennessee Walking Horse was crossed with Welsh ponies to create the American Walking Pony, a gaited pony breed.

The breed has also been featured in television, movies and other performing events. The Lone Ranger&#x27;s horse &quot;Silver&quot; was at times played by a Tennessee Walker. &quot;Trigger, Jr.&quot;, the successor to the original &quot;Trigger&quot; made famous by Roy Rogers, was played by a Tennessee Walker named Allen&#x27;s Gold Zephyr. The position of Traveler, mascot of the University of Southern California Trojans, was held at various times by a purebred Tennessee Walking Horse, and by a Tennessee Walker/Arabian cross.

== Horse shows ==

The two basic categories of Tennessee Walking Horse show competition are called &quot;flat-shod&quot; and &quot;performance&quot;. Flat-shod horses compete in many different disciplines under both western and English tack. At shows where both divisions are offered, the flat-shod &quot;plantation pleasure&quot; division is judged on brilliance and show presence of the horses while still being well mannered, balanced, and manageable. &quot;Park pleasure&quot; is the most animated of the flat-shod divisions. Flat-shod horses are shown in ordinary horseshoes, and are not allowed to use pads or action devices, though their hooves are sometimes trimmed to a slightly lower angle with more natural toe than seen on stock horse breeds.

Tennessee Walking Horses are typically shown with a long mane and tail. Artificially set tails are seen in &quot;performance&quot; classes, on full-grown horses in halter classes, and in some harness classes, but generally are not allowed in pleasure or flat-shod competition.

Performance horses, sometimes called &quot;padded&quot; or &quot;built up&quot;, exhibit flashy and animated gaits, lifting their forelegs high off the ground with each step. This exaggerated action is sometimes called the &quot;Big Lick&quot;. The customary style for rider attire and tack is saddle seat. Horses are shod in double and triple-nailed pads, which are sometimes called &quot;stacks&quot;. In the early 21st century, this form of shoeing is now prohibited at shows governed by the National Walking Horse Association (NWHA), and the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF). Artificially set tails are seen in &quot;performance&quot; classes, on full-grown horses in halter classes, and in some harness classes, but generally are not allowed in pleasure or flat-shod competition. 

Horses in western classes wear equipment similar to that used by other breeds in western pleasure classes, and exhibitors may not mix English and Western-style equipment. Riders must wear a hat or helmet in western classes. Tennessee Walkers are also shown in both pleasure and fine harness driving classes, with grooming similar to the saddle seat horses. In classes where horses are turned out in saddle seat equipment, it is typical for the horse to be shown in a single curb bit with a bit shank under , rather than the double bridle more common to other saddle seat breeds. Riders wear typical saddle seat attire. Hats are not always mandatory, but use of safety helmets is allowed and ranges from strongly encouraged to required in some pleasure division classes.

=== Horse Protection Act ===


The showing, exhibition and sale of Tennessee Walking Horses and some other horse breeds is governed by the Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA) due to concerns about the practice of soring. This developed during the 1950s and became widespread in the 1960s, resulting in a public outcry against it. Congress passed the Horse Protection Act in 1970, declaring the practice to be &quot;cruel and inhumane&quot;. The Act prohibits anyone from entering a sored horse into a show, sale, auction or exhibition, and prohibits drivers from transporting sored horses to a sale or show.

Congress delegated statutory responsibility for enforcement to the management of sales and horse shows, but placed administration of the act with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Violations of the HPA may result in criminal charges, fines and prison sentences. The USDA certifies certain Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) to train and license Designated Qualified Persons (DQPs) to complete inspections. APHIS inspection teams, which include inspectors, investigators, and veterinary medical officers, also conduct unannounced inspections of some horse shows, and have the authority to revoke the license of a DQP who does not follow the standards of the Act.

Soring is defined by the HPA with four meanings:
&quot;(3)(A) an irritating or blistering agent has been applied, internally or externally, by a person to any limb of a horse, (B) any burn, cut, or laceration has been inflicted by a person on any limb of a horse, (C) any tack, nail, screw, or chemical agent has been injected by a person into or used by a person on any limb of a horse, or (D) any other substance or device has been used by a person on any limb of a horse or a person has engaged in a practice involving a horse, and, as a result of such application, infliction, injection, use, or practice, such horse suffers, or can reasonably be expected to suffer, physical pain or distress, inflammation, or lameness when walking, &quot;Action devices, which remain legal but are often used in conjunction with illegal soring practices, are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations as &quot;any boot, collar, chain, roller, or other device which encircles or is placed upon the lower extremity of the leg of a horse in such a manner that it can either rotate around the leg, or slide up and down the leg so as to cause friction, or which can strike the hoof, coronet band or fetlock joint&quot;.

Between 1978 and 1982, Auburn University conducted research as to the effect of applications of chemical and physical irritants to the legs of Tennessee Walking Horses. The study found that chains of any weight, used in combination with chemical soring, produced lesions and pain in horses. However, chains of 6 ounces or lighter, used on their own, produced no pain, tissue damage or thermographic changes.

Soring can be detected by observing the horse for lameness, assessing its stance and palpating the lower legs. Some trainers trick inspectors by training horses not to react to the pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching when the sored area is touched. The practice is sometimes called &quot;stewarding&quot;, in reference to the horse show steward. Some trainers use topical anesthetics, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Pressure shoeing is also used, eliminating use of chemicals altogether. Trainers who sore their horses have been observed leaving the show grounds when they find that the more stringent federal inspection teams are present.

Although illegal under federal law for more than 40 years, soring is still practiced; criminal charges have been filed against people who violate the Act. Enforcement of the HPA is difficult, due to limited inspection budgets and problems with lax enforcement by inspectors who are hired by the shows they were to police. As a result, while in 1999 there were eight certified HIOs, by 2010, only three organizations remained certified as HIOs, all known to be actively working to end soring.

In 2013, legislation to amend and strengthen the HPA was introduced in Congress. The President and executive committee of the TWHBEA voted to support this legislation, but the full board of directors chose not to. The bi-partisan bill, H.R. 1518, was sponsored by Representative Ed Whitfield (R-KY), and Representative Steve Cohen (D-TN), with 216 co-sponsors. On November 13, 2013 a hearing was held. Supporters included the American Horse Council, the American Veterinary Medical Association, members of the TWHBEA, the International Walking Horse Association, and Friends of Sound Horses. Opponents included members of the Performance Horse Show Association, and the Tennessee Commissioner of Agriculture. The legislation did not pass in the 113th Congress and was reintroduced in 2015 for the 114th Congress. In 2016, the USDA proposed new rules independent of the PAST Act, banning stacks and chains, and providing stricter inspections at training barns, auctions, and shows.

=== Show rules and organizations ===

Controversies over shoeing rules, concerns about soring, and the breed industry&#x27;s compliance with the Horse Protection Act has resulted in the development of multiple governing organizations. The breed registry is kept by the TWHBEA, which promotes all riding disciplines within the breed, but does not sanction horse shows.

The USEF does not currently recognize or sanction any Tennessee Walking Horse shows. In 2013 it banned the use of action devices and stacks at any time in any class.

The Tennessee Walking Horse Heritage Society is a group dedicated to the preservation of the original Tennessee Walker bloodlines, mainly for use as trail and pleasure horses, rather than for showing. Horses listed by the organization descend from the foundation bloodstock registered by the TWHBEA. Pedigrees may not include horses that have been shown with stacks post-1976.

Two organizations have formed to promote the exhibition of flat-shod horses. The National Walking Horse Association (NWHA) promotes only naturally gaited horses in its sanctioned horse shows, has its own rule book, and is the official USEF affiliate organization for the breed. The NWHA sanctions horse shows and licenses judges, and is an authorized HIO.

The NWHA was in the process of building its own &quot;tracking registry&quot; to document both pedigree and performance achievements of horses recorded there. These included the Spotted Saddle Horse and Racking Horse breeds as well as the Tennessee Walker. However, the NWHA was sued by the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders &amp; Exhibitors Association (TWHBEA), which eventually won some concessions regarding the use of the TWHBEA&#x27;s copyrighted registry certificates by the NWHA. While the judgment did not prohibit the NWHA from continuing its registry service, this is no longer advertised on the NWHA website.

Friends of Sound Horses (FOSH) also promotes exhibition of flat-shod and barefoot horses. It licenses judges for both pleasure classes and gaited dressage, promotes use of gaited horses in distance riding and sport horse activities, and is an authorized HIO.

Two organizations promulgate rules for horse shows in which action devices are allowed: the Walking Horse Owners Association (WHOA) and &quot;S.H.O.W.&quot; (&quot;Sound horses, Honest judging, Objective inspections, Winning fairly&quot;) which regulates the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration. The Celebration has been held in Shelbyville, Tennessee, each August since 1939. It is considered the showcase competition for the breed. In the early 21st century, the Celebration has attracted large amounts of attention and controversy due to the concerns about violations of the Horse Protection Act.

<text>In geometry, a conchoid is a curve derived from a fixed point , another curve, and a length . It was invented by the ancient Greek mathematician Nicomedes.

==Description==
For every line through that intersects the given curve at the two points on the line which are from are on the conchoid. The conchoid is, therefore, the cissoid of the given curve and a circle of radius and center . They are called &quot;conchoids&quot; because the shape of their outer branches resembles conch shells.

The simplest expression uses polar coordinates with at the origin. If 
:formula_1
expresses the given curve, then 
:formula_2
expresses the conchoid. 

If the curve is a line, then the conchoid is the &quot;conchoid of Nicomedes&quot;.

For instance, if the curve is the line , then the line&#x27;s polar form is and therefore the conchoid can be expressed parametrically as 
:formula_3

A limaçon is a conchoid with a circle as the given curve.

The so-called conchoid of de Sluze and conchoid of Dürer are not actually conchoids. The former is a strict cissoid and the latter a construction more general yet.

<doc id="898866" wikidata="Q1317290" url="?curid=898866" title="Microsoft Visual Studio Express">
<text>Microsoft Visual Studio Express was a set of integrated development environments (IDEs) that Microsoft developed and released free of charge. They are function-limited version of the non-free Visual Studio and require mandatory registration. Express editions started with Visual Studio 2005.

In 2013, Microsoft began supplanting Visual Studio Express with the more feature-rich Community edition of Visual Studio, which is available free of charge with a different license that disallow some scenarios in enterprise settings. The last version of the Express edition is the desktop-only 2017.

==2005–2010: Language-centric editions==
===History===
Visual Studio 2005 Express, the first version of the Express edition, was released in October 2005. It runs on Windows 2000 SP4 and later. The first service pack for 2005 Express was released in December 2006. This version is freeware and requires no registration.

Visual Studio 2008 Express reached general availability in November 2007. Its first service pack was first publicly available in on 11 August 2008. This version requires Windows XP SP3, although it can develop apps compatible with Windows 2000. Microsoft introduced mandatory registration in this version.

Visual Studio 2010 Express was released in April 2010, alongside Visual Studio 2010. While most of its components (see below) ran on Windows XP, its Windows Phone component needed Windows Vista.

===Characteristics===
The 2005, 2008, and 2010 versions of Visual Studio Express consist of several standalone IDEs, each of which is focused on a single programming language:

* Visual Basic Express (the Visual Basic .NET language)
* Visual C++ Express (the Visual C++ language)
* Visual C# Express (the C# language)
* Visual J# Express (the ill-fated J# language, 2005 only)
* Visual Web Developer Express (ASP.NET)
* Visual Studio Express for Windows Phone (2010 only)

===Visual Basic Express===
Visual Basic Express has the following limitations:
* No IDE support for databases other than SQL Server Express and Microsoft Access
* No support for web applications with ASP.NET (although, it is supported by Visual Web Developer Express)
* No support for developing for mobile devices (no templates or emulators)
* Absence of Crystal Reports
* Fewer project templates (e.g. Windows services template and Excel Workbook template are unavailable)
* Limited options for debugging and breakpoints
* No support for creating Windows Services (needs a separate project template)
* No support for OpenMP
* Limited deployment options for finished programs
* No code folding

Visual Basic 2008 Express includes the following improvements over 2005:

* Includes the visual Windows Presentation Foundation designer codenamed &quot;Cider&quot;
* Debugs at runtime
* Better IntelliSense support
**Fixes common spelling errors
**Corrects most forms of invalid syntax
**Provides suggestions to class names when specified classes are not found
Visual Basic 2005 and Visual Basic 2008 Express feature a Visual Basic 6.0 converter that makes it possible to upgrade Visual Basic 6.0 projects to Visual Basic.NET. The converter is not included with the Visual Basic 2010 Express.

===Visual Web Developer Express===
Visual Web Developer Express is a freeware web development tool that allows developers to evaluate the web development and editing capabilities of the other Visual Studio editions at no charge. Its main function is to create ASP.NET websites. It has a WYSIWYG interface, drag-and-drop user interface designer, enhanced HTML and code editors, a limited database explorer, support for CSS, JavaScript and XML, and integrated, design-time validation for standards including XHTML 1.0/1.1 and CSS 2.1.

Visual Web Developer 2005 Express lacks certain features, such as the Accessibility Checker, the ability to create standalone class library projects, third-party add-ins and macros. Visual Web Developer 2008 Express SP1 supports both class library and web application projects. It also includes a new integrated HTML designer based on Microsoft Expression Web. However, this edition cannot publish self-developed websites.

===Visual C++ Express ===
Visual C++ Express compiles .NET and Win32 applications in 32-bit only. It includes Windows SDK&#x27;s compilers and core files, which developers can use to build Win32 applications.

Limitations of Visual C++ Express:
* No support for MFC or ATL. These libraries can, however, be installed from an older version of the Windows SDK and Windows Driver Kit, or a Visual Studio Trial installation.
* Lack of a resource editor, which is available in commercial editions of Visual Studio.
* No profiling support.
* No support for add-ins or IDE macros.
* No option for crash dump generation.
* No &quot;list of all breakpoints&quot; window.
* No support for cross-language debugging, for example, a C# application calling a C++ DLL.

Limitations in earlier versions:
* No out-of-box support for developing 64-bit applications (prior to 2012).
* No support for OpenMP (prior to 2012).
* The debugger cannot be attached to a running process (prior to 2010).

While Microsoft lists memory windows as unavailable in Visual Studio 2010 Express, third parties have reported that they are available when Expert Settings are enabled.

Many open-source projects have started providing project files created with Visual C++ Express; noteworthy examples include the Ogre and Irrlicht engines. Modding kits for commercial engines, such as Valve&#x27;s Source engine, also support this development system.

===Visual C# Express===
Visual C# Express is a free, lightweight, integrated development environment (IDE) designed for novice developers, students and hobbyists to create applications and (when combined with the XNA Game Studio) video games for Windows, Xbox 360 and Zune. It can build console, Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Foundation applications, and class libraries.

Microsoft has found that a substantial community of game players are taking up C# programming.

Visual C# Express does not have a breakpoint control panel; breakpoints can only be toggled. The following refactoring modes were also unavailable:
* Encapsulate field
* Promote local to parameter
* Reorder parameters
* Remove parameters
* Extract interface

The limitations effectively reduce the refactoring capabilities of Visual C# Express to renaming and extracting methods. According to Microsoft, the reason the listed features are absent is &quot;to simplify the C# Express user experience&quot;. Some users remarked that the omission of refactoring capabilities removed useful functionality without actually simplifying use.

The ability to attach the debugger to an already-running process is also unavailable, hindering scenarios such as writing Windows services and re-attaching a debugger under ASP.NET when errors under the original debugging session cause breakpoints to be ignored.

==2012–2017: Ecosystem-centric==
For the 2012 release of Visual Express, Microsoft changed its distribution of editions so that each version is geared toward an overall solution type, and can contain more than one project type. (This is unlike previous Express editions, each of which was geared around a single programming language.) For example, a web solution might consist of a web application project and a couple of C# class-library projects. This change was made to reflect the wide diversity of applications available for the web and the new WinRT platform used on Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8.

Microsoft has released five Visual Studio Express 2012 products:
In October 2013, Microsoft released four new versions of its Visual Studio Express products. Like the 2012 Express edition, they are geared toward an overall solution type that may mix different types of projects. However, different IDEs are still offered for different destination platforms. They are:
* Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web
* Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows: &quot;Note: Works on Windows 8.1 only (x86 and x64).&quot;
* Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop
* Visual Studio Team Foundation Server Express 2013

Note that Visual Studio Express for Windows Phone was not released in the set of 2013 products, but Visual Studio Express for Windows Phone is now merged with Visual Studio Express for Windows 2013.2. With this new release, Windows 8.1 x86 is now supported for Windows Phone 8.1 development, but not for Windows Phone 8.0 development or the Windows Phone Emulator, the latter of which also requires a processor that supports Client Hyper-V and Second Level Address Translation (SLAT).

The Visual Studio Express 2015 editions are:
* Express for Desktop – for creating desktop Windows programs
* Express for Web - for creating responsive websites, web APIs, or &quot;real-time online experiences&quot;
* Express for Windows – core tools for creating Universal Windows Platform apps. Requires Windows 10.
* Team Foundation Server 2015 Express – platform for source code control, for project management, and for team collaboration

Microsoft terminated the Visual Studio Express lineage with the release of Visual Studio Express 2017 for Windows Desktop. This last release has no siblings specialized in Web or UWP projects. Developers interested a free solution for those projects were instead directed towards Visual Studio Community Edition or Visual Studio Code.

<text>Ernst Ludwig Dümmler (2 January 183011 September 1902) was a German historian.

== Biography ==
Ernst Ludwig was born in Berlin, the son of Ferdinand Dümmler, a Berlin bookseller. He studied law, classical philology and history, among other things, at Bonn under Johann Wilhelm Löbell, and in Berlin, where his influences were Leopold von Ranke and Wilhelm Wattenbach. His doctorate dissertation, &quot;De Arnulfo Francorum rege&quot; (Berlin, 1852), was a notable essay among historians.

He entered the faculty at Halle in 1855, and started an historical seminar. In 1858 he became an associate professor, in 1866 full professor. In 1875, he became a member of the revised committee directing the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot;, himself undertaking the direction of the section &quot;Antiquitates&quot;. In 1888 he became president of the central board in Berlin. This was an official recognition of Dümmler&#x27;s leading position among German historians.

== Selected works ==
In addition to numerous critical works and editions of texts, he published:
* &quot;Piligrim von Passau und das Erzbistum Lorch&quot; (1854) – Pilgrim of Passau and the Archdiocese of Laureacum.
* &quot;Uber die älteste geschichte der Slawen in Dalmatien, 549-928&quot; (1856) – On the early history of the Slavs in Dalmatia (549-928)
* &quot;Das Formelbuch des Bischofs Salomo III von Konstanz aus dem neunten Jahrhundert&quot; (1857) – Formulary of Bishop Solomon III of Constance from the ninth century.
* &quot;Anselm der Peripatetiker&quot; (1872) – Anselm the Peripatetic.
His great work was the &quot;Geschichte des ostfränkischen Reiches&quot; (Berlin, 1862–1865, 2 volumes; 2nd ed., 1887–1888, in 3 volumes). In conjunction with Wattenbach, he completed the &quot;Monumenta Alcuiniana&quot; (Berlin, 1873), which had been begun by Philipp Jaffé, and with Rudolf Köpke, he wrote &quot;Kaiser Otto der Grosse&quot; (Leipzig, 1876).

He edited the anonymous Lorsch riddles twice—first in 1879 and then again two years later, in 1881. He also edited the first and second volumes of the &quot;Poetae Latini aevi Carolini&quot; for the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot; (Berlin, 1881–84).

== Family ==
His son, Georg Ferdinand Dümmler (1859–1896), an archaeologist and philologist, was professor at the University of Basel from 1890 until his death on 15 November 1896, aged 37.

<text>Cat Mother and the All Night Newsboys was an American musical group originally formed in New York and later based in Mendocino, California, most active in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

== History ==
Cat Mother and The All Night Newsboys was co-founded by Roy Michaels (February 25, 1942 – September 23, 2008) and Bob Smith (July 7, 1942 – March 21, 1991) in the fall of 1967. Michaels had previously been playing with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay in the Au Go Go Singers, prior to the formation of Buffalo Springfield. Initial members were Bob Smith on vocals, keyboards and drums, Roy Michaels on vocals and bass guitar, William David &quot;Charlie&quot; Chin on vocals and guitar, Larry Packer on guitar and violin, and Michael Equine on drums and guitar. Jay Ungar was also initially associated with the group, on violin, and rejoined the group for their second album. Core band membership consisted of Michaels, Smith and Equine.

The ensemble&#x27;s popularity in New York grew during 1967 and 1968, through regular appearances at the Cafe Wha?, which led to an engagement as the house band at New York&#x27;s Electric Circus.

The band was particularly notable for its rock and roll &quot;Good Old Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, a Top 40 hit in the summer of 1969, reaching no. 13 in Canada, no. 21 on the U.S. Billboard Pop Chart, and which also ranked Number 35 in the &quot;Top 50 Songs from the Summer of 1969&quot;, just behind The Youngbloods&#x27; &quot;Get Together&quot; (No. 34) and ahead of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Lay Lady Lay&quot; (No. 41) and The Plastic Ono Band&#x27;s &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; (No. 43). Number 1 on this list, reflecting an era before stricter radio formatting, was Zager and Evans&#x27; &quot;In the Year 2525&quot;. &quot;Good Old Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; included cover versions of &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; by Chuck Berry, &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; by Little Richard, &quot;Chantilly Lace&quot; by The Big Bopper, &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot; by Jerry Lee Lewis, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; by Carl Perkins and &quot;Party Doll&quot; by Buddy Knox. &quot;Good Old Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was covered by the Dave Clark Five later in 1969. A second single &quot;Can You Dance To It&quot; reached no. 78 in Canada later in 1969.

The single and the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Street Giveth and the Street Taketh Away&quot;, were produced by Jimi Hendrix. The association with Hendrix came through the band meeting him in New York City. Cat Mother was initially managed by Michael Jeffery, who also managed Hendrix. Cat Mother opened for Hendrix on several occasions, as a result. Other notable early appearances included playing at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival, the historic concert headlined by The Doors, where John Lennon and The Plastic Ono Band appeared in a surprise performance.

Other popular songs by the band included &quot;Track in A&quot; and &quot;Strike a Match and Light Another.&quot; However, the band&#x27;s principal chart success remained &quot;Good Old Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, a work not representative of the diversity of its sound but rather the group&#x27;s ability in original, late 50s rock style. Similar to contemporaries Moby Grape, Poco and the post-1967 Byrds, as well as predating the Eagles, Cat Mother was one of the first rock bands to blend rock and country music.

As part of the band&#x27;s actions to sever ties with manager Michael Jeffery, the group relocated to San Francisco in 1970, and later settled in the Mendocino area. By the time of their 1970 second album, &quot;Albion Doo-Wah&quot;, they were joined by Jay Ungar (violin, mandolin, guitar, &amp; vocals), Paul Johnson (guitar), and special guest Lyndon Lee Hardy (vocals on two songs). The third album, &quot;Cat Mother&quot;, released in 1972, featured Michaels, Smith and Equine joined by Charlie Prichard (lead &amp; slide guitar) and Steve Davidson (congas &amp; percussion). By the time of the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Last Chance Dance&quot;, in 1973, Charlie Prichard had been replaced by Charlie Harcourt on guitar, harmonica and vocals. The band continued to perform until 1977.

Michaels, Smith Packer, Chin, Ungar, Johnson Prichard, Davidson and Harcourt all continued in music. (As of November 2020, Michael Equine is alive and the last remaining corporate officer of the band.)

&quot;The Street Giveth ... and the Street Taketh Away&quot; and &quot;Albion Doo-Wah&quot; are available through streaming services and as a digital downloads.

<text>Dreamland Margate is an amusement park and entertainment centre based on a traditional English seaside funfair located in Margate, Kent, England. The site of the park was first used for amusement rides in 1880, although the Dreamland name was not used until 1920 when the park&#x27;s Grade II* listed (particularly significant building of more than local interest) Scenic Railway wooden rollercoaster was opened.

The number of amusements at the park increased during the 1960s and 1970s, and in 1981 the site was sold to the Dutch Bembom brothers, who renamed it &quot;Bembom Brothers White Knuckle Theme Park&quot;. The name remained until it reverted to Dreamland in 1990.

In the early 2000s, the park began to enter into decline, and a number of rides were sold to other theme parks. The park&#x27;s owner, Jimmy Godden announced in 2003 that Dreamland would be closed and the site redeveloped, although the listing of the Scenic Railway meant it could not be moved. The site was sold to Margate Town Centre Regeneration Company in 2005, and this company proposed a residential redevelopment. A number of local residents then launched a campaign to restore and reopen Dreamland instead, although final closure was later in the same year. The site then fell into a state of disrepair as objections were raised to redevelopment plans, and was subject to a series of arson attacks including one which significantly damaged the Scenic Railway.

The public campaign to restore the park continued, and in September 2013, ownership passed to Thanet District Council after a compulsory purchase order was approved by a High Court judge. In 2014 it was confirmed that the park would be redeveloped. It re-opened in June 2015 as a &quot;Re-imagined Dreamland&quot;. The operating company became insolvent in December 2015, but continued to operate under administration. A second refurbishment and relaunch took place in 2017, funded by the major creditor.

==History==

===Origins===

The Dreamland site was a salt marsh known as the Mere that was inundated at high tide until 1809 when a causeway and seawall were built. In 1846 a railway terminus was built on the present Arlington site for the South Eastern Railway, followed in 1864 by a further terminus, for the rival London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) on the site of what is now Dreamland Cinema. The LCDR (under its subsidiary the Kent Coast Railway) completed this terminus in 1866, but no public service was ever offered. The junction faced Ramsgate, so a local Margate-Broadstairs-Ramsgate train service was envisaged.

Dreamland&#x27;s remote origins as an entertainment venue date from the same year, when London restaurateurs Spiers and Pond opened a restaurant and dance hall in the unused railway terminus on the Mere causeway. Not being very successful, this &#x27;Hall by the Sea&#x27; was bought by the Reeve family of Margate in 1870 for £3,750, who also gradually acquired the low-lying land at the rear of the Hall.
In 1870, circus entrepreneur George Sanger went into partnership to run the &#x27;Hall by the Sea&#x27; with Thomas Dalby Reeve, the then Mayor of Margate. After Reeve&#x27;s death in 1875, Sanger became the sole proprietor of the Hall and the land behind it. This land behind the Hall, the former &#x27;Mere&#x27;, was turned into pleasure gardens with a mock ruined abbey, lake, statues and a menagerie – as well as sideshows and roundabouts. Animal cages and Gothic walls on the present Dreamland western and southern boundaries (now listed Grade II) date from this time. The main purpose of the menagerie was to act as a breeding and training centre for animals used in Sanger&#x27;s travelling circus.

The first amusement rides were installed as early as 1880 when &#x27;Sea on Land&#x27; machines were installed. Passengers sat in &#x27;boats&#x27; that were made by a system of levers to pitch and roll as though at sea – a direct antecedent of the contemporary &#x27;flight simulator&#x27; rides. In 1893 a large skating rink was built. Shortly after this, the park gained some notoriety as the venue for the murder of a sex-worker by the local circus strong man.
Sanger died in 1911 during a scuffle arising from the attempted murder of a friend (although Sanger himself may have been the intended target), and the park entered an uncertain period as part of the attraction was the charisma of the man himself. In the end, the site was purchased from his estate in 1919 for £40,000 by John Henry Iles, who had already set up theme parks all over the world, including at Cairo, Berlin, Petrograd (now St Petersburg) and Pittsburgh.

Inspired by Coney Island, which he had visited in 1906, Iles renamed the site &#x27;Dreamland&#x27; and initiated work on the construction of the Scenic Railway rollercoaster in 1919, having purchased the European rights to the Scenic Railway design from inventor and patent holder LaMarcus Adna Thompson. The ride opened to the public in 1920 with great success, carrying half a million passengers in its first year. Iles also brought to the park other rides common to the time including a smaller roller coaster, the Joy Wheel, Miniature Railway, The Whip, and the River Caves.

===Expansion===
A ballroom was constructed on the site of the skating rink in 1920, and in 1923 Iles built his variety cinema on the site. (In 1926, he was also responsible for the building of Margate&#x27;s lido on the seafront.) Between 1920 and 1935 he invested over £500,000 in the site, constantly adding new rides and facilities and culminating in the construction of the Dreamland cinema complex in 1934. Iles ceased to be a director in 1938 and the business was taken over by his son Eric.

Most of the Dreamland site was requisitioned by the Government during World War II, with the park reopening in June 1946. Eric Iles was manager. From 1947, it received investment from Butlins.

Three generations of the Iles family – John Henry, Eric, and John – controlled Dreamland from 1919 until its sale in 1968. The new owners, Associated Leisure, introduced many innovations to Dreamland, including squash courts and, in an echo of the Sanger era, an ice rink and zoo. Much of the planting of the pleasure gardens dating from the 1870s survived until the 1970s when the gardens were removed and the rides expanded. 1976 saw the debut of a revolutionary new ride, the &#x27;Orbiter&#x27;, unveiled by travelling showman and Dreamland lessee Henry Smith, a ride which went on to become highly successful in other amusement parks and travelling fairs around the world. Smith, himself a descendant of George Sanger, also had a Skid, Waltzer, Speedway, Tip Top, and another Orbiter up until the park&#x27;s change of ownership in 1981. 1980 saw the opening of a 240-seater 148 ft high Big wheel.

Dreamland was purchased by the Dutch Bembom Brothers in 1981. They owned several other amusement parks in continental Europe and renamed the site Bembom Brothers White Knuckle Theme Park, bringing in a new headline attraction in the form of the Anton Schwarzkopf-designed &#x27;Looping Star&#x27; roller coaster. The name change lasted until 1990, when it reverted to Dreamland. Other changes they made included ceasing evening hours and charging for admission, rather than per ride. They also introduced many new &#x27;high-tech&#x27; rides that updated the park and made it, by the late 1980s, one of the top ten most visited tourist attractions in the United Kingdom.

===Decline===
In common with other traditional British seaside resorts, Margate&#x27;s economic base depended on residential holidaymakers staying for several days, usually families holidaying for a week or more. This was supplemented by day-trippers on weekends and public holidays, when the resort could become very busy. With the rise of cheap package holidays abroad from the 1960s, however, the residential holiday trade progressively collapsed in the 1970s. This meant that footfall at entertainment venues in these resorts, such as Dreamland, declined sharply on summer weekdays while remaining relatively buoyant at weekends.

Day-tripper trade at Margate remained substantial, but the loss of holiday revenue meant that the town began to struggle to maintain its infrastructure. This, in turn, started to affect its attractiveness as a day destination. However, the investment by Bembom Brothers indicates that this was not regarded as an appreciable threat to Dreamland at the beginning of the 1980s.

More immediately serious was the opening of much larger amusement parks closer to London, on expansive sites and with ample vehicle parking. Thorpe Park opened in 1979, and Chessington World of Adventures in 1987. At this time, the fastest train journey from London to Margate was just under two hours, and Dreamland has never had any public on-site parking.
In 1996 the Bembom family sold the site to local entrepreneur Jimmy Godden, who had previously operated the Rotunda Amusement Park at Folkestone and Ramsgate Pleasure Park at Ramsgate. At this time, most of the rides they owned were relocated. The &#x27;Looping Star (Great America)&#x27; went to an amusement park in Budapest together with the looping boat ride &quot;The Mary Rose&quot;. The Looping Star&#x27;s sister ride made a brief appearance for two seasons at Margate (previously at Camelot Theme park) before leaving again for its current home, Loudon Castle theme park, where it is called the Twist &#x27;n&#x27; Shout.

After his purchase of the park, Godden was able to secure European and regional grant aid to assist in an initial £3m redevelopment. However, during Godden&#x27;s tenure many of the rides were sold off, including the big wheel which had dominated the Margate skyline for two decades but was dismantled and sold to a park in Mexico.

===Closure===

In 2003, Godden announced that Dreamland would close down and the land would be redeveloped. A vocal section of public opinion supported continued use of the Dreamland site as an amusement park, along with a government report in 2004.

After the closure announcement, Dreamland was sold to Margate Town Centre Regeneration Company (MTCR) in 2005 for £20m. A number of local residents then formed the &#x27;Save Dreamland Campaign&#x27;. The campaign proposed to turn Dreamland into a heritage amusement park, consisting of a number of vintage rides and attractions from other British amusement parks. Some rides were obtained by Save Dreamland and placed in storage.

Although it was initially announced that Dreamland would close in November 2003, it operated during 2004 and 2005. Definitive closure to the public was in 2005 and all of the rides apart from the Scenic Railway were then removed from the site. The Scenic Railway had been granted Grade-II listed status in 2002, and so could not be moved or dismantled.

Part of the Scenic Railway was damaged by fire after an arson attack on 7 April 2008. About 25% of the structure, boarding station, storage sheds, and trains were destroyed and had to be removed as irreparable. The physical security of the site was upgraded, and the surviving structure surveyed. Some of the surviving machinery and chassis from the cars were salvaged and stored on site. Another suspected arson attack was carried out on the site on 28 May 2014, but this was confined to a disused building near the Scenic Railway.

On 25 April 2008 the Dreamland cinema&#x27;s Listed building status increased from Grade II (buildings of special architectural or historic interest) to Grade II* (particularly significant buildings of more than local interest). The cinema, which featured a Compton theatre organ, was closed in 2007 following the opening of a new multiplex cinema at Westwood Cross. The buildings were placed under renovation and the Dreamland sign on the front tower has been refurbished with LED lighting and shines brightly at night.

The defunct cinema was sold by MTCR, by then renamed DreamlandLive Ltd. This was before the result of a court appeal by this company to stop Thanet District Council taking possession of the theme park under a compulsory purchase order, served in June 2011. The CPO was approved in August 2012.

===Re-opening project===
The success of the Save Dreamland Campaign in attracting public awareness led to the establishment of the Dreamland Trust, a registered charity, in 2007 to co-ordinate a re-opening project.

A total of £18m in public funding was subsequently awarded to the project, to restore, preserve and maintain the listed structures, which included the Scenic Railway, menagerie cages and some of the internal building spaces. This money was also used to purchase five heritage rides.

On 16 November 2009, the Dreamland Trust was awarded a grant of £3m by the Heritage Lottery Fund with further funding of £3.7m and £4m coming from the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Thanet District Council respectively, to restore the Scenic Railway and to develop the former Dreamland site as necessary for rejuvenation.

The Scenic Railway was regarded as being the focus of the rejuvenation of Dreamland as a heritage amusement park. Work began in September 2014, with a complete refurbishment of the track and new trains being built.

Some historic rides from other parks were donated to the Dreamland Trust and put in storage for restoration at a later date. The majority of unique old rides at Pleasureland Southport were donated, which included the 1940s Caterpillar ride, King Solomon&#x27;s Mines wooden roller-coaster (formerly of Frontierland, Morecambe and later moved to Pleasureland Southport), workings from the Ghost Train and River Caves, the Hall of Mirrors, Mistral, Haunted swing and the Skyride (Chairlift ride). The Junior Whip which stood at Blackpool Pleasure Beach was also donated.

Wayne Hemingway, his wife Gerardine, and the &#x27;HemingwayDesign&#x27; team were appointed as designers of the envisaged new Dreamland in 2012. This includes the creative vision for re-imagination and branding.

An additional £10m in private funding was invested in the re-opening of Dreamland by the commercial operators chosen to run it, Sands Heritage Ltd. These funds were used to introduce a collection of 17 additional rides to create the amusement park, as well as a Roller Disco &amp; Diner, Amusement Arcade, Vintage Pin Ball Arcade, Dreamland Emporium and The Octopus&#x27;s Garden. The running agreement between Sands Heritage and Thanet District Council involved the former taking out a 99-year lease of the freehold property owned by the council as a result of the CPO, while the council remained responsible for certain aspects of repair and maintenance including as regards the Scenic Railway. Part of the capital raised by Sands Heritage was a £600 000 short-term secured loan from Arrowgrass Master Fund, an investment company based in the Cayman Islands. This company also held 31% of the share capital of Sands Heritage.

===Opening of Re-imagined Dreamland===
The park re-opened on 19 June 2015, garnering much media coverage. BBC Radio Kent spent the opening day broadcasting live from Dreamland. There was a slight delay to the opening ceremony, and BBC Kent broadcasters Jo Burn and Zac Daunt-Jones spent 45 minutes entertaining the crowds, while live on-the-air. Additional rides opened in July.

The entry fee to the park was £14.95.

The park&#x27;s centrepiece, the Scenic Railway, was still in the process of being rebuilt by Thanet District Council. It opened to the public only on 17 October 2015, owing to delays in rebuilding the train carriages. Member and press previews took place on 16 October 2015. Sands Heritage put in a claim for lost revenue as a result of the delay, which was settled in November with a compensation payment by TDC to Sands Heritage after the delay to opening the Scenic Railway forced the company into administration.

===Administration===
On 8 December 2015, Sands Heritage were forced to apply to the High Court for a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) in relation to a debt of £2.9m owed to Arrowgrass. This amounted to the original £600 000 owed as a secured loan, plus unpaid compound interest and charges. At a meeting on 23 December 2015 the company&#x27;s creditors agreed to accept the CVA, allowing the company more time to pay off its existing debts. Sands Heritage representatives at the meeting promised that the debt to Arrowgrass would be repaid over five years - as a secured debt, this took priority over other debts. The insolvency administrators appointed in the CVA were Duff &amp; Phelps.

The financial failure was attributed primarily to the number of visitors in the summer season of 2015 being half of what was predicted for the capital structuring of the project. Media reports estimated the cash loss suffered by the company as being on the order of £5 million. The major contributing factor for visitor shortfall was the delay of the Scenic Railway project and lack of communication from the management team of Thanet District Council to Sands Heritage, leading to a premature opening when preparatory works were incomplete. This led to an almost immediate closure of seventeen days to complete these, and the Scenic Railway was to take longer. Also, there were problems with running repairs to rides, leading to breakdowns. Despite popular belief, the admission price cited as discouraging visitors was not the reason for Sand Heritage&#x27;s cash flow problems; however, the management team and the administrators, Duff &amp; Phelps, abolished it to drive footfall when it became apparent the Scenic Railway would not work for a second summer season.

In August 2016, the CEO of Dreamland, Eddie Kemsley, resigned. A creditors&#x27; meeting held in August 2016 revealed that creditors were owed £8.34m, with Sands Heritage having an overall balance sheet shortfall of £14m (£10m of which reflected the investment made by Sands Heritage themselves). An auditors&#x27; report to Thanet District Council in December that year revealed that several of these creditors were small local businesses with little hope of any repayment.

The administrators initially expressed their hope that Dreamland as a business could be sold as a going concern in March 2017, after the 2016 summer season. However, this was rendered improbable by their half-yearly report to creditors (December 2015 to June 2016) when they revealed that operating losses during the period were over £1m or about £41 000 per week. They warned that losses were continuing, factors cited being bad weather in early summer and the failure of the Scenic Railway in mid-June.

The Scenic Railway had been restored by Thanet District Council following the arson attack. Unfortunately the right knowledge and expertise had not been available when it was rebuilt, and so it failed a safety test in June 2017. The ride is powered by cable haulage, nowadays a rare form of traction worldwide, and the wrong sort of cables was specified. When TDC tried to rectify the matter after the failure, it found that the skills concerned were so specialist that they were rare worldwide and sourcing them was only successful after the summer season was over. The administrators indicated their intention to seek compensation for the failure.

===Second relaunch===
Arrowgrass covered the operating losses for the summer season of 2016 with a further loan of £1m, secured on the premises of 49–51 Marine Terrace. This was a former pub owned freehold by Sands Leisure (not part of the TDC lease), which had been called the Cinque Ports Arms before the later 20th century. An extension of the administration period was sought, and granted.

Then it was announced that the investment company had increased its lending to just under £10m, to allow for a re-vamp of the business. In February 2017 it was reported that a £25m private investment from Arrowgrass had been obtained.

The new loan was used to re-landscape the site and to add some new rides, with refurbishment of the Cinque Ports pub. The premises had been used as the ticket office for Dreamland and the administrative centre of Sands Leisure, but a bar was opened in it by the administrators in the 2016 season and it was due to be restored to a complete pub for the 2017 re-launch.

The improved park was announced as reopening on 28 April 2017; however this was later delayed to 26 May. The event attracted national media attention. The major new feature which was mentioned as adding to the viability of the business was a new music venue with a capacity of 15 000.

Private investigation by a Thanet District councillor revealed that all the fixed assets of Sands Leisure had loans secured on them for repayment to Arrowgrass. These included the fairground rides owned by the company, as well as the 99-year lease from TDC and other properties owned freehold by the company. If the figure of indebtedness of £25m quoted by the national media was correct, in May 2017 Arrowgrass had almost complete control of the value of the assets of Dreamland. According to the terms of the security given for the loans, if repayment conditions were breached then Arrowgrass could apply for Sands Leisure to be liquidated and could then claim the equity of the lease of the property in lieu.

In 2017, the park hosted 15,000 people at the Demon Dayz festival with Gorillaz. In October 2017 the park exited administration.

There has been interest in redeveloping the Arlington House tower block, next door to Dreamland, which is owned by Thanet Council. In 2018, it was reported that any future deal for the redevelopment of Dreamland could include the Arlington House site.

In 2019 the park reported experiencing its most successful year since reopening, with more than 700,000 visitors across the year, and announced a new programme of events for its 100th anniversary in 2020. In August 2019, the park unveiled a seven metre inflatable sculpture of Tina Turner&#x27;s head, created by Cool Shit, in celebration of the 2019 Turner Prize exhibition being hosted in Margate.

==Rides and attractions==
==Festivals==
On 6 March 2017 Gorillaz announced the Demon Dayz festival to be held at Dreamland on 10 June 2017. Tickets sold out in 32 minutes, at about 15,000 tickets in an hour.

On 14 September 2018 the National Citizen Service hosted their graduation ceremony at Dreamland, at which 700 Kent and Sussex teens graduated from the employability programme. Each received a signed certificate from the Prime Minister.

==In popular culture==
Dreamland was the subject of a 1953 documentary film, &quot;O Dreamland&quot;. It was also visited by characters in the 1989 Christmas special of the BBC Television sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; titled &quot;The Jolly Boys&#x27; Outing&quot;. Some of the rides seen in the sitcom were renamed and repainted at Loudoun Castle Theme Park in Scotland (now closed). The &quot;Mary Rose&quot; was renamed the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and is now at Lightwater Valley in North Yorkshire. In an episode of British sitcom &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; titled &quot;Dreamland&quot;, during a conversation with Victor, Margaret recalls the couple visiting Margate and Dreamland on their third anniversary.

The park was also the filming location for the 2007 film &quot;Exodus&quot; and featured prominently in the 2000 film &quot;Last Resort&quot;, about a young Russian immigrant seeking asylum in England.

Dreamland is frequently alluded to in Graham Swift&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;Last Orders&quot;, as well as the 2001 film adaptation.

The Romford-based band Five Star shot the majority of the video for their 1984 single &quot;Crazy&quot; at Dreamland.

On 29 June 2015, the music video for the song &#x27;Blue&#x27; by Marina and the Diamonds was shot at Dreamland.

On 26 September 2017, the Sky Mobile iPhone 8 commercial with actor Tom Hardy was shot at Dreamland.

In February 2022, the Dreamland Cinema signage was changed while the building was used as a set in Sam Mendes&#x27; 1980s period film &quot;Empire of Light&quot;.

In June 2022, Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds performed at Dreamland.

<doc id="898878" wikidata="Q2229130" url="?curid=898878" title="Scenic Railway (Dreamland Margate)">
<text>The Scenic Railway is a wooden roller coaster located at the Dreamland Amusement Park in Margate, United Kingdom. It first opened in 1920 and is the oldest roller coaster in the UK. The ride is distinctive compared to modern-day roller coasters, as a brakeman is still required to travel with the train to control its speed, manually applying brakes when needed. It is also one of only eight scenic railways in the world, and the UK&#x27;s English Heritage granted the roller coaster Grade II listed status in 2002 and Grade II* listed status in 2011. The Scenic Railway was non-operational from 2006 until 2015 amid park closure and restoration following an arson attack.

==History==
In 1919, John Henry Iles bought the European usage rights to the scenic railway from LaMarcus Adna Thompson, who had patented the scenic railway design in 1884. Iles was a co-owner of Dreamland and had the Scenic Railway constructed at Dreamland from local timber and had mechanical parts for the ride shipped over from the US. The ride drew on ideas from several other designers, but was constructed by local carpenters within the area specified by Iles.

Fire destroyed part of the ride in 1949 and the structure required major repairs. Replacement timber for the ride was bought from the dismantled pier at Lowestoft and the ride re-opened in 1950. Fire again destroyed parts of the ride in 1957.

Some of the Margate trains were sold to Battersea Fun Fair in the 1960s where they were used on the Scenic Railway there (called the &#x27;Big Dipper&#x27; at that site). It was one of the ex-Margate trains that was involved in the Battersea Big Dipper disaster of 1972 when 5 children were killed and several injured. It was during the aftermath of this accident that most of the wooden roller coasters in Britain&#x27;s amusement parks were removed as, irrespective of the actual standards of safety on the rides, public confidence had been dented.

The Scenic Railway was successfully granted Grade II listed status in 2002, making it the first roller coaster ever to be given any form of protection against demolition. It continued operating until 2006 after Dreamland closed to the public in 2003. On 7 April 2008, it was targeted in an arson attack, and a significant portion of the ride was damaged. In 2011 the ride&#x27;s listing status was upgraded from Grade II to Grade II* despite the fire damage due to the rarity of the ride and its international significance as one of the world&#x27;s oldest roller coasters. It reopened in 2015 after going through an extensive repair process.

=== Restoration ===
Dreamland restored the Scenic Railway as part of a broader initiative to rejuvenate the amusement park. On 16 November 2009, the Dreamland Trust was awarded a grant by UK&#x27;s Department for Culture, Media and Sport to restore the Scenic Railway and other historic areas of the park. Topbond Plc of Kent were contracted to rebuild the woodwork, while WGH Engineering from Doncaster restored the ride&#x27;s mechanical operation. During restoration, the wooden structure that was in the midst of being rebuilt was knocked down by high winds in December 2014, which set back the timeline to reopen the attraction. The roller coaster reopened to the public on 15 October 2015.

==Incidents==
*On 10 August 2024, a train derailed and collided with one of the brake pads, causing damage to part of the structure. No injuries were reported. 

==Ride description==
The ride consists of a wooden-tracked railway with steel rails supported by a wooden structure. The ride occupies a space approximately and . The track is in a trough, and as such is often incorrectly referred to as a side-friction coaster. The train actually makes no contact with the trough walls; they are present simply to provide some lateral protection from derailment as the running wheels are flanged like those of railway vehicles. The layout of the track consists of a double-loop with two cable lift-hill sections. The drops off both of the lift hills are double-drops.

The original trains were destroyed by the fire in 2008, so new trains were constructed for the restored ride in 2015. The trains of the ride consist of three cars mounted on bogies. The bodies and much of the chassis of the cars are wooden, and 28 riders can travel on each train. The brakeman rides between the first and second cars on the bogie and operates the brakes with a large lever.

<text>USS &quot;Robinson&quot; (DD-88) was a in the United States Navy, later transferred to the Royal Navy, as HMS &quot;Newmarket&quot; (G47). She was the first ship named for Isaiah Robinson.

She was laid down 31 October 1917 by the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, launched 28 March 1918, sponsored by Miss Evelyn Tingey Selfridge, and commissioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 19 October 1918.

==Construction and design==
In 1916, the US Congress authorized a massive three-year shipbuilding program, with the aim of matching the largest navy in the world, the British Royal Navy. The program included 50 destroyers, which were to be built to a modified version of the , designed to reach rather than the of the &quot;Caldwell&quot;s. As such, the new design, the , had more powerful machinery with geared steam turbines, but retained the same flush-decked layout and armament used by the &quot;Caldwell&quot;s. The &quot;Wickes&quot; were built to one of two detailed designs, one design by Bethlehem Steel, used by the two Bethlehem-owned shipyards, Union Iron Works and the Fore River Shipyard, while the design by Bath Iron Works was used by all other shipyards involved in the program.

&quot;Robinson&quot; was one of 20 destroyers ordered as the first stage of the construction plan, under the Fiscal year 1917 construction program. She was laid down at Union Iron Works&#x27; San Francisco yard on 31 October 1917, was launched on 28 March 1918 and commissioned at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 19 October 1918.

The Bethlehem-designed ships, like &quot;Robinson&quot;, were long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draft of . Displacement was normal and full load. Four Yarrow boilers fed steam to geared sets of steam turbines and driving two shafts The machinery was designed to give , giving a design speed of . 225 tons of oil were carried, giving a design range of at .

==Service history==

===United States Navy===
&quot;Robinson&quot; cleared San Francisco Bay 24 October 1918 for the east coast of the United States. Transiting the Panama Canal 3 November 1918, she set course by way of Guantanamo Bay for Norfolk, Virginia where she arrived on 8 November.

On 10 January 1919, &quot;Robinson&quot; put to sea from Norfolk to conduct winter training out of Guantanamo Bay, which ended at New York Harbor 14 April 1919. She then prepared for lifeguard duty supporting the first transatlantic flight from America to Europe to be attempted by Navy Seaplane Division Number 1.

&quot;Robinson&quot; got underway from Norfolk on 30 April, arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, 4 May 1919, and stood out toward the entrance of the harbor on the afternoon of 8 May. At 1944, she sighted the first of the Navy seaplanes, the NC-3, approach the harbor on the first leg of the transatlantic flight. Two days later, &quot;Robinson&quot; took station at sea to assist in guarding the flight of the two seaplanes to Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, then returned to Halifax 11 May and got underway on 14 May to act as plane guard for seaplane NC-4 which had been delayed by repairs at Chatham Naval Air Station, and passed overhead at 1645, on 15 May, to join the other two seaplanes at Trepassey Bay.

After NC-4 faded from view, &quot;Robinson&quot; set course for station on the Azores route to be followed by the seaplanes from Trepassey Bay, 16 May 1919. These seaplanes would be guided on their 1,380-mile flight to the Azores, by &quot;Robinson&quot; and other destroyers who poured smoke from their funnels in daylight and fired starshells or turned on searchlights during the night. The first seaplane passed &quot;Robinson&quot; abeam an hour before midnight of 16 May 1919, and the two others also passed within the next 20 minutes.

The NC-4 covered the flight in 15 hours and 13 minutes setting down at Horta, the emergency stop in the Azores Islands. This seaplane had found its way above the dense fog which completely blinded the pilots of the others. An hour before the NC-4 landed, the NC-1 was forced to the water about off Flores Island and the NC-3 had also descended about from Fayal. The NC-1 sank in the heavy seas and Robinson joined in the search for the NC-3 which refused all assistance and finally taxied to Ponta Delgada under its own power.

&quot;Robinson&quot; anchored at Horta, Fayal Island, the afternoon of 19 May and stood out of the harbor the next morning to transport newspaper reports to Ponta Delgada where she arrived that afternoon. On 25 May 1919, she was en route to Station Number Seven () to cover the fourth leg of the transoceanic flight of the lone NC-4. She sighted the seaplane at 1330 on the afternoon of 26 May and the NC-4 faded from view on its way to a royal welcome by the Portuguese at Lisbon on 25 May and at Plymouth, England, on 31 May, terminating the historic 4,500-mile flight.

&quot;Robinson&quot; returned to Ponta Delgada on 28 May 1919 and put to sea on 2 June to arrive at Newport on 8 June. She underwent overhaul in the Norfolk Navy Yard and conducted operations in local areas of Newport until her arrival at New York on 30 September 1919. She joined five other destroyers off Sandy Hook on the afternoon of 1 October, then made rendezvous off Fire Island with to act as honor escort for the King of Belgium. She cleared port on 6 October for operations off Key West and Pensacola, Florida, visiting Beaufort, South Carolina, on her return voyage to New York where she arrived 5 November 1919.

On 22 November 1919, &quot;Robinson&quot; stood out of New York Harbor, leading the second section of the honor detachment on the port quarter of , flying the standard of the Prince of Wales, in company with . She was relieved of her royal escort duty off Nantucket Shoals and returned to New York on 25 November. After a visit to Savannah, and voyage repairs in the Portsmouth Navy Yard, she cleared Boston Harbor on 14 January 1920 for fleet maneuvers off Guantanamo Bay and near the Panama Canal. She returned to New York on 1 May 1920 and entered the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 25 May 1920 for a year of inactivity. She shifted from the yard to Newport on 25 May 1921 for local operations until 10 October, and then visited New York before her arrival at Charleston, South Carolina, on 19 November 1921. After several months in local waters off Charleston, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard where she decommissioned 3 August 1922.

&quot;Robinson&quot; remained inactive until 23 August 1940 when she recommissioned for transfer to the British Government under terms of the destroyers-in-exchange-for-bases agreement. The transfer was effected at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 26 November 1940 when &quot;Robinson&quot; was renamed HMS &quot;Newmarket&quot; (G47) and taken over by a care and maintenance party of the Royal Canadian Navy. She was commissioned in the Royal Navy on 5 December 1940, and struck from the U.S. Navy list 8 January 1941.

===Royal Navy===

&quot;Newmarket&quot; departed Halifax on 15 January for the United Kingdom, calling at St. John&#x27;s and arriving at Belfast on 26 January and at Plymouth, England, on 30 January.

After a short refit in the Humber, she began convoy escort work in the Western Approaches Command and on 2 June 1941, was unsuccessfully attacked by an aircraft in the northwestern approaches. Later that month she proceeded to Sheerness, and was in dockyard hands until November when she joined the 8th Escort Group, at Derry. &quot;Newmarket&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original /50 and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of hedgehog.

On 3 January 1942, &quot;Newmarket&quot; had to leave Convoy HX 166 because of boiler trouble, and proceeded to Lough Foyle. On 30 January 1942 she arrived at Liverpool, and was under refit until the end of March 1942.

In April 1942, she escorted the Russian convoy PQ-14, but a month later, she was allocated for duty as an aircraft target ship in the Firth of Forth. She refitted at Leith between December 1942 and February 1943, and later in the year, refitted again at Rosyth, Scotland. In September 1943, &quot;Newmarket&quot; was reduced to care and maintenance status at Rosyth but resumed duty as an aircraft target ship from the spring of 1944, until after the end of the war in Europe. She was scrapped at Llanelli in September 1945.

<text>Angus William MacLise (March 14, 1938 – June 21, 1979) was an American percussionist, composer, poet, occultist and calligrapher, known as the first drummer for the Velvet Underground who abruptly quit due to disagreements with the band playing their first paid show.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Angus William MacLise was born on March 14, 1938, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the son of a book dealer. Despite some formal training as a percussionist, his playing style became so idiosyncratic that many assumed he was self-taught.

===The Velvet Underground===
MacLise was a member of La Monte Young&#x27;s Theatre of Eternal Music, with John Cale, Tony Conrad, Marian Zazeela and sometimes Terry Riley. He contributed to the early Fluxus newspaper VTre, edited by George Brecht, and was also an early member of the Velvet Underground, having been brought into the group by flatmate John Cale when they were living at 56 Ludlow Street in Manhattan. Lou Reed recruited his friend Sterling Morrison, whom he knew from Syracuse University, and the initial line-up of the Velvets consisted of Reed, Cale, Morrison and MacLise.

MacLise played bongos and hand drums during 1965 with the first incarnation of the Velvet Underground and he was also capable of playing tabla, cimbalom and tambourine. Although the band regularly extemporized soundtracks to underground films during this era, MacLise never officially recorded with them, and is often considered something of a shadowy, legendary figure in their history. Demos recorded during this period are included on the &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot; box set, but MacLise plays on none of them because (according to John Cale) he did not appreciate the need to turn up on time.

Cale describes MacLise as &quot;living on the Angus calendar&quot;, showing up to gigs hours or even days after the band had finished.

When the band&#x27;s first paying gig in November 1965 arose, MacLise quit, suggesting the group were selling out. He was replaced by Moe Tucker, resulting in the &quot;classic&quot; lineup of the Velvet Underground.

===Brief return to the Velvet Underground===
In 1966 when Velvet Underground lead singer and guitarist Lou Reed was in the hospital with hepatitis, MacLise rejoined the group for a five-day run of performances at Poor Richard&#x27;s in Chicago, June 21–26, 1966 during the Exploding Plastic Inevitable performances, sharing duties with Gerard Malanga, whom Angus had taught to play tabla. Cale took over lead vocals and organ, drummer Maureen Tucker switched to bass and MacLise drummed; by now, Tucker&#x27;s idiosyncratic tribal style of drumming was integral to the group&#x27;s music.

During an Exploding Plastic Inevitable performance in 1966, MacLise showed up half an hour late and carried on drumming for half an hour after the set had finished to compensate for his late arrival.

By this time the Velvet Underground had found some recognition (if not great financial success) and MacLise was anxious to rejoin the group, but according to the notes of the box set &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot;, the VU&#x27;s primary songwriter and &quot;de facto&quot; bandleader Lou Reed had specifically prohibited MacLise from rejoining the band full-time due to his erratic behavior.

===Later years===
After leaving the Velvet Underground for good, MacLise moved to Berkeley, California. He married Hetty McGee in a wedding ceremony at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, presided over by LSD guru Timothy Leary. Together, they had a son named Ossian Kennard MacLise, who was recognized by Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, the 16th Karmapa, as a reincarnation of a Tibetan saint, or tulku, and at age four became a Buddhist monk. The MacLises travelled to Canada, France, Greece and India, before finally settling in Nepal.

A student of Aleister Crowley (he was working on a script for a film version of Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Drug Fiend&quot; before he died), he began to blend Tibetan mysticism with his music to create sound through various drone techniques.

==Death==
A heavy drug user who was never particularly mindful of his physical health, MacLise died of hypoglycemia and pulmonary tuberculosis at the Shanta Bhawan Hospital in Kathmandu on June 21, 1979, aged 41. The cause of death has also been attributed to malnutrition. He was cremated to the traditions of Tibetan Buddhists in a funeral pyre.

==Recorded music==
MacLise recorded a vast amount of music that went largely unreleased until 1999. These recordings, produced between the mid-&#x27;60s and the late-&#x27;70s, consist of tribal trance workouts, spoken word, poetry, tape cut-ups and minimalist droning and electronics, as well as many collaborations with his wife Hetty. In 2008, she bequeathed a collection of her husband&#x27;s tapes to the Yale Collection of American Literature.

Selections can be found on:
*&quot;The Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda&quot; (Siltbreeze, 1999)
*&quot;Brain Damage in Oklahoma City&quot; (Siltbreeze, 2000)
*&quot;The Cloud Doctrine&quot; (Sub Rosa, 2002)
*&quot;Astral Collapse&quot; (Quakebasket, 2003)
*&quot;The Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda&quot; (DVD, Bastet/Saturnalia, 2006)

MacLise also collaborated with Tony Conrad, John Cale and La Monte Young on several other recordings:

*&quot;Inside the Dream Syndicate Vol.I: Day Of Niagara&quot; (Table of the Elements, 2000)
*&quot;Inside the Dream Syndicate Vol.III: Stainless Steel Gamelan&quot; (Table of the Elements, 2002)
*&quot;An Anthology of Noise &amp; Electronic Music: First A-Chronology 1921-2001/Vol.1&quot; (Sub Rosa, 2002)

He worked on soundtracks for several underground films by Piero Heliczer, and appears in at least two: &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction&quot; (1965). He also worked on the soundtrack for &quot;Voyage&quot;, a short film by Jerry Jofen.

==Influence==
As co-founder of the Dead Language Press with Piero Heliczer, MacLise published works by influential writers, including early work by the Beat poet Gregory Corso.

English experimental music group Coil regarded MacLise as an important influence in the later years of their career; lead member Jhonn Balance referred to MacLise as a &quot;a liminal genius and, alongside such people as Ira Cohen, largely and unjustly semi-neglected&quot;, and the title of their album &quot;Astral Disaster&quot; is an intentional tribute to MacLise&#x27;s archival release &quot;Astral Collapse&quot;.

==Dreamweapon==
In May 2011 a major retrospective exhibit &quot;Dreamweapon: The Art and Life of Angus MacLise (1938–1979)&quot; was mounted by the Boo-Hooray Gallery in Chelsea, New York City. The exhibit features the contents of a recently discovered suitcase containing photographs, notes, poetry, and 100 reels of music. In addition to the gallery exhibit, there are sound installations at Boo-Hooray&#x27;s second location in Chinatown and film screenings at the Anthology Archives.

In 1965, a work by MacLise titled &quot;Rites of the Dream Weapon&quot; was included in the New Cinema Festival (also known as the Expanded Cinema Festival), an extensive series of multimedia productions in New York presented by Jonas Mekas and featuring the work of such artists as Robert Rauschenberg and Claes Oldenburg. Mekas was impressed with MacLise, writing in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, &quot;The first three programs of the New Cinema Festival – the work of Angus McLise [sic], Nam June Paik, and Jerry Joffen [sic] – dissolved the edges of this art called cinema into a frontiersland mystery.&quot; MacLise&#x27;s entry also made a lasting impression on the playwright Richard Foreman, who praised it years later in an interview. According to Sterling Morrison, Andy Warhol&#x27;s multimedia shows (Andy Warhol Uptight and the Exploding Plastic Inevitable) were based on similar works by MacLise and Heliczer, which they called &quot;ritual happenings.&quot;

<text>Captain Thomas Holdup Stevens, USN (February 22, 1795 – January 21, 1841) was an American naval commander in the War of 1812.

Born in Charleston, South Carolina, Thomas Holdup was orphaned at an early age and was adopted by General Daniel Stevens. On February 8, 1809, he was appointed midshipman on board &quot;Hornet&quot;. From then until 1812, he served successively in &quot;Constitution&quot;, &quot;President&quot;, and &quot;John Adams&quot;. Late in 1812, he was assigned to duty with Commodore Isaac Chauncey and distinguished himself in the attack on Black Rock on November 28. Commodore Chauncey appointed him acting lieutenant in January 1813 and his permanent commission in that rank, to date from July 24, was confirmed by the Senate on August 3.

On September 10, he again distinguished himself as captain of the sloop, &quot;Trippe&quot;, during the Battle of Lake Erie. In 1815, an Act of the Legislature of South Carolina enabled him to add General Stevens&#x27; surname to his own. Following the War of 1812, Stevens held many posts, both ashore and afloat, including tours of duty at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and the Washington Navy Yard. He was promoted to Master Commandant on March 3, 1825 and, in 1829, he embarked on a two-year tour as commanding officer of &quot;Ontario&quot;, serving in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1832, he was assigned to the Navy Yard at Pensacola and in 1836 he was appointed captain, to date from January 27, 1836. After waiting two years for orders, he was appointed to command of the Washington Navy Yard on February 29, 1840. He served in that capacity until his death there early on the morning of January 21, 1841.

The first &quot;Stevens&quot; (Destroyer No. 86) was named for the first Thomas Holdup Stevens and the second &quot;Stevens&quot; (DD-479) honored both him and his son, Rear Admiral Thomas Holdup Stevens, Jr.

Originally buried at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, his remains were moved to Arlington National Cemetery in June 1905 to rest beside those of his son.

<doc id="898893" wikidata="Q5084818" url="?curid=898893" title="Charlie Ergen">
<text>Charles William Ergen (born March 1, 1953) is an American billionaire businessman and the is co-founder and chairman of Dish Network and EchoStar. He was CEO of Dish Network until May 2011, when he was succeeded by Joseph Clayton. Ergen resumed the role in March 2015 after Clayton&#x27;s retirement, until December 2017, when Erik Carlson, then president and COO, was promoted to CEO. Ergen remains chairman of the company. Ergen owns 48 percent of Dish and 46 percent of Echostar shares, which gives him 78 percentage of Dish&#x27;s and 72 percent of EchoStar&#x27;s total voting power.

==Early career==
After graduating with an M.B.A. from Wake Forest in 1976, Ergen worked as a financial analyst for Frito-Lay. He &quot;retired&quot; in 1978 in hopes of working for himself. Afterward, he was a professional gambler, playing poker and blackjack.

== EchoStar ==

In 1980 Ergen, his future wife Candy, and Jim DeFranco started a new business called EchoSphere Corporation, investing $60,000 to purchase two C-Band antennas, targeting rural Colorado. They drove around the Denver metro area on a small budget, selling satellite dishes from the back of their truck.

In 1990 Ergen elevated EchoStar&#x27;s profile by raising $335 million in junk bonds and purchasing orbital slots for satellites. Two years later, EchoStar got a DBS license from the Federal Communications Commission, giving the company its own geostationary orbital slot. In 1993, EchoStar Communications was incorporated. Under Ergen, EchoStar&#x27;s net income doubled to $20.4 million, in 1993.

== Dish ==

Under Ergen, Dish was the first satellite television provider to offer two-way high-speed internet access as an investor in and dealer for StarBand Communications&#x27; geostationary Ku-band satellite internet access service in the United States and the first to introduce a Digital video recorder in a set-top box. He was also instrumental in making satellite receivers available for under $200. In 2012, the Big Four Broadcasters, NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox filed a suit against Dish after it launched AutoHop, a technology that records broadcasting programming and plays it back without commercials. Dish filed a suit seeking a declaratory judgment asserting the legality of the judgment. Preliminary injunction by Fox to block the service was denied. Ergen has stated that Dish&#x27;s present focus is on acquiring a significant share of the spectrum for cellular wireless services. Dish is also looking for a partner to build a wireless network, with Google and AT&amp;T speculated to be potential partners.

Under Ergen, EchoStar and Dish Network acquired multiple companies, after an $8 million deal for 22 channel assignments of DBSC.

==Litigation==
Various lawsuits in which Ergen has been involved include:

* In 2013 and 2014, Harbinger Capital Partners, a hedge fund managed by Philip Falcone, sued Dish Network and Charles Ergen personally in federal court in New York City, alleging racketeering and claiming that Dish Network had illegally tried to take away the hedge fund&#x27;s control over LightSquared Inc. during its bankruptcy. In 2015, the federal court dismissed the suit.
* The Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund filed suit against Ergen in federal court in Colorado in September 2013. Ergen bought large amounts of LightSquared&#x27;s debt at deep discounts while it was in bankruptcy. Ergen then made a personal bid of $2 billion to acquire LightSquared&#x27;s assets. This increased the price that Dish had to bid in order to acquire LightSquared&#x27;s rights to wireless spectrum. Indeed, Ergen ordered Dish to bid $2.2 billion on these assets. The suit claims this was a breach of Ergen&#x27;s fiduciary duties to Dish shareholders. Dish and Ergen prevailed in the litigation.
* In 2005, a discrimination lawsuit was filed against EchoStar in federal court in Denver by an employee who said that EchoStar had engaged in &quot;hostile conduct&quot; against her after she had a baby in 2001. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount in August 2005.

==Personal life==
Ergen was born into an Episcopalian family in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on March 1, 1953, the fourth of five children born to Viola (née Siebenthal) and William Krasny Ergen. His mother was one of the first female accountants in the state of Minnesota. His father was an Austrian immigrant who was working in Sweden as a nuclear physicist, and left Europe prior to World War II. His father coined the phrase &quot;China syndrome&quot;. His parents married in Minnesota in 1944 and then moved to Camden, New Jersey, before settling in Oak Ridge where his father accepted a position at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Ergen graduated from Oak Ridge High School. He then received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, where he was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and an M.B.A. from Wake Forest University. He was a professional blackjack and poker player.

Ergen is well known for his frugality. His office is furnished with second-hand couches and he does not fly first class. Ergen used to sign all the checks his company issued but currently signs only checks for $100,000 or more. Ergen&#x27;s supporters call his negotiating style patient and prudent.

He is married to Cantey (&quot;Candy&quot;) McAdam. They have five children. They live in The Village at Castle Pines, Colorado.

== Wealth ==
Ergen first appeared in the Forbes 400 list in 1999 at the age of 46, with a net worth of US$4.8 billion and was ranked 36th in the list, as Dish share price rose more than 702.1% from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999. He was also the third richest person in Colorado at that time. In 2000, Ergen first appeared in The World&#x27;s Billionaires by Forbes and having a net worth of $11.2 billion, making him the 21st richest person in the world.

Ergen appeared on the &quot;Forbes 400&quot; list every year from 1999 until 2022, but he was dropped in 2023. On November 6, 2023, Dish Network&#x27;s and EchoStar share price plunged 37.43% and 31.28% respectively after both companies reported earnings below analysts&#x27; expectations and a decline in subscriber numbers. As a result, Ergen lost $786 million in a day, causing his net worth to drop from $1.6 billion to $857.6 million, marking the first time in nearly 25 years that he lost his billionaire status. However, as of November 2024, Forbes estimates his net worth at $2.5 billion.

== Recognition ==
Ergen was recognized with a Rocky Mountain News&#x27; Business &quot;Person of the Year Award&quot; in 1996, and honoured a second time in 2001.

Ergen co-founded the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association. In 2012, Ergen was inducted into the Consumer Electronics &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;.

<doc id="898904" wikidata="Q560635" url="?curid=898904" title="David Del Tredici">
<text>David Walter Del Tredici (March 16, 1937 – November 18, 2023) was an American composer. He won a Pulitzer Prize for Music and was a Guggenheim and Woodrow Wilson fellow. Del Tredici is considered a pioneer of the neo-romantic movement. He was also described by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;one of our most flamboyant outsider composers&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Del Tredici was born in Cloverdale, California, on March 16, 1937. He came from a non-musical family and began his musical life as an aspiring concert pianist at the age of twelve, taking piano lessons with German concert pianist Bernhard Abramovitch. If he had not been a pianist, he said, he would have become a florist.

Abramovitsch encouraged him to be &quot;very creative&quot; in his playing, which he later cited as prepared him for composing. &quot;I was only interested in playing ... great sprawling things like the Schumann Fantasy, that the performer had to mold and shape&quot;, he reflected. Thus he learned how to &quot;sustain a [musical] thread so that it was never broken&quot;.

He debuted with the San Francisco Symphony at age 16 and later performed Liszt and Tchaikovsky concertos under Arthur Fiedler. Then he attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he continued studying piano. He played primarily Romantic works. He also played &quot;a lot of Schoenberg and Berg and loved their music&quot;.

While enrolled at Berkeley, he attended the Aspen Music Festival and School. The pianist he was going to study with was &quot;mean&quot; to him, so Del Tredici tried his hand at composing music instead. He wrote &quot;Opus 1&quot; as his first piece and was invited to perform it for Milhaud, who complimented him. Thereafter Del Tredici concentrated on composition. His earliest works were his &quot;own version of German expressionism&quot;. Finishing his studies with Seymour Shifrin at Berkeley, he graduated in 1959.

He then studied composition with Earl Kim and Roger Sessions for one year at Princeton University on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship. Princeton was then, Tim Page described, &quot;the center for the American atonal avant-garde&quot;. &quot;I was there at the height of the serial movement,&quot; Del Tredici said. He felt like an outsider: &quot;[They] seemed to be trying to take the expressionist element out of German expressionism,&quot; he added.

Del Tredici left Princeton to work with Robert Helps in New York. He found a mentor in Helps, who supported his instincts. He returned to Princeton, earning his MFA in 1963.

==Career==
In 1964, Del Tredici met Aaron Copland at Tanglewood; they would be friends for the remainder of Copland&#x27;s life, and his musical style remained an influence on Del Tredici.

Del Tredici taught at Harvard University, where he worked alongside Leon Kirchner and was a part of the modernist movement. He stated that &quot;anything bad appeals to any young composer&quot;, including himself.

Much of Del Tredici&#x27;s work was inspired by literature, including author and poet James Joyce. As a fellow lapsed Catholic, Del Tredici was attracted to Joyce&#x27;s struggles with his own Catholic past and &quot;tortured life&quot;, which found voice in Del Tredici&#x27;s &quot;dissonant and nearly atonal&quot; style. He also found inspiration in Martin Gardner&#x27;s &quot;The Annotated Alice&quot; and its commentary on the works of Lewis Carroll. During this period, he found himself moving back towards tonality, which he felt was more appropriate for works such as his &quot;Final Alice&quot; and &quot;Adventures Underground&quot;.

Del Tredici was Composer-In-Residence at the New York Philharmonic from 1988 until 1990. In 1999 and 2000 he taught at Yale University. He also taught at Boston University, Juilliard School, and the University of Buffalo. , he was a faculty member of the City College of New York.

Towards the end of his life, Del Tredici continued to draw on literature for his song cycles. His work continued to draw on Lewis Carroll (particularly &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;), but he was also inspired by contemporary American poets. He also created works celebrating &quot;gayness&quot;, acknowledging that many great composers were gay and that &quot;it&#x27;s something to be celebrated&quot;. A reviewer noted that themes in his work examine &quot;tormented relationships, personal transformations, and the joys and sorrows of gay life&quot;. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and held additional residencies at Yaddo, the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, and the MacDowell Colony.

==Death==
Del Tredici died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at his home in Manhattan on November 18, 2023, at the age of 86.
==Works==
Del Tredici composed work for Michael Tilson Thomas and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. His work &quot;Adventures Underground&quot; drew inspiration from the poem &quot;The Mouse&#x27;s Tail&quot;. Del Tredici also composed works influenced by rock and folk music. He wrote works for Phyllis Bryn-Julson, the San Francisco Symphony, and the New York Philharmonic. He also composed an opera and song cycles. He wrote music using the work of, or as tribute to, Chana Bloch, Colette Inez, Allen Ginsberg, Thom Gunn, Paul Monette, and Alfred Corn.

His &quot;In Memory of a Summer Day&quot; (part one of &quot;Child Alice&quot;) won Del Tredici a Pulitzer Prize. That piece was developed into a ballet, which has been performed by the National Ballet of Canada and the Grand Théâtre de Genève. In 1988, his work &quot;Tattoo,&quot; commissioned by the Concertgebouw Orchestra, was debuted by Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic.

<doc id="898906" wikidata="Q10434928" url="?curid=898906" title="Braviken Paper Mill">
<text>Braviken Paper Mill (or simply Braviken) is a paper mill located outside Bråviken, Norrköping, in Sweden. It is owned by Holmen Paper, which in turn is a subsidiary of Holmen.

Since the name is derived from the location, Bråviken, and since the name of the paper mill was to be internationally read and spoken, the ring diacritic above the &quot;a&quot; was dropped.

The current mill manager is Fredrik Hålgersson.

==Introduction==
Braviken mainly produces magazine, book and newsprint paper, both white and colored.

Three paper machines are located at the mill:

* PM51, the oldest one, was built 1977 and production ended September 14, 2013. Produced mainly directory paper in different colors (white, yellow and pink). The width of the rolls leaving the paper machine was 8.50m. Produced 200.000 tons of paper per year.
* PM52, built in 1986. Produces newsprint and book paper. Colors of the paper produced are white and what is referred to as baby pink, which is, as the name suggests, a variant of pink produced for Sportbladet. The width of a roll is 8.55m. Produces 250.000 tons of paper per year.
* PM53, the latest, and obviously most modern of the machines produces magazine paper, at a rate of 300.000 tons per year.

Each machine goes in a distinctive color: PM51 is completely green, PM52 is blue, while the PM53 is blue with a touch of violet.

The name of the machines comes from the fact that the mill used to be the fifth when MoDo AB owned it. The company itself does &quot;not&quot; own fifty machines.

== Technology ==
The mill has its own TMP factory which produces the pulp needed for the production.

== History ==
The production began in central Norrköping during the 15th century. Since expansion was hindered by lack of area the production moved outside Norrköping to Bråviken. The construction began in 1977, and by 1986 the second machine was built. In 1986 the last machine in central Norrköping shut down, and all of the operations moved to the new location.

<doc id="898914" wikidata="Q5330277" url="?curid=898914" title="Eastern Market, Washington, D.C.">
<text>The Eastern Market is a public market in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C., housed in a 19th-century brick building. Eastern Market was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. It is located on 7th Street, S.E., a few blocks east of the U.S. Capitol between North Carolina Avenue SE and C Street SE. Badly damaged by an early-morning fire in 2007, the market building reopened in the summer of 2009 following an extensive renovation.

Eastern Market also marks a smaller community within the Capitol Hill neighborhood by serving as an anchor point for other nearby stores and restaurants. It is served by the nearby Washington Metro Eastern Market (station) on the Blue, Orange, and Silver Lines.

== Overview ==
Of Washington’s eight wards, Eastern Market is located in Ward 6. Nestled in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, this area is bounded by North and South Capitol Streets on the west, 15th Street on the east, H Street on the north, and by the Southeast-Southwest Freeway. Working adults, single adults, and families with young children largely populate the neighborhood, which is dominated by rowhouses. It is presently managed under the guidance of interim manager Barry Margeson. The flea market of Eastern Market hosts up to 100 exhibitors from five continents. Presently, Eastern Market is being met with proposals for renovation. The goal of the renovation plan is to link 8th Street&#x27;s Barracks Row and Eastern Market in order to create a community gathering space. 

Eastern Market&#x27;s North Hall can be rented for weddings and other occasions.

Eastern Market has been featured in scenes of movies including &quot;Body of Lies&quot; (2008) and &quot;Mercury Rising&quot; (1998).

==History==
===Original market===
The first Eastern Market was one of three public marketplaces included in Pierre L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan for the city, to supplement existing markets in Alexandria and Georgetown. The plan also called for a Center Market and a Western Market. In 1805, Thomas Jefferson issued a proclamation calling for Eastern Market to be set up at 7th and L Streets SE, near the Navy Yard.

The original market received heavy fire damage during the British attack of 1814. It was repaired and remained active until the Civil War caused a disruption of supplies. During the war, farmers from southern Maryland set up their own marketplace on the opposite side of the Anacostia River. The market fell into disrepair, and was nearly abandoned. An 1871 newspaper account called it a &quot;disgraceful shed.&quot;

===1873 relocation===
The current Eastern Market was designed by Adolf Cluss and was in continuous operation as a public market from 1873 until April 30, 2007. It was the first in a larger city-owned public market system, initiated to urbanize Washington, make orderly provision for the distribution of goods to its residents, and serve as a magnet to draw residents. The Market was expanded in 1908 with the addition of the Center and North Halls designed by Snowden Ashford. At the start of the 20th century, the Eastern Market was recognized as the unofficial &quot;town center&quot; of Capitol Hill. It is the last of the city&#x27;s public markets still in operation.

The market nearly closed because of competition from grocery store chains and a decline in neighborhood investment. Local residents fought to keep it open, and the area has since been revitalized. Eastern Market continues to host a thriving farmers&#x27; market. Fresh meats, baked goods and cheeses are sold from indoor stalls, and fresh produce is sold outside along the tent-covered sidewalk. Artisans and antiques dealers also sell their goods outside the market on weekends, making Eastern Market a popular stop for locals as well as tourists. The Market 5 Gallery organizes art shows, music and theater performances, and craft sales at the Eastern Market.

===2007 fire and aftermath===
Eastern Market was badly damaged by an early-morning 3-alarm fire on April 30, 2007. The heaviest damage was in the South Hall of the market, the portion occupied by vendors&#x27; stalls, where the roof suffered a partial collapse. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; has described the South Hall as &quot;gutted so badly that birds can now fly in through the front windows and out the back ones.&quot; Following the fire, Washington, D.C., Mayor Adrian Fenty promised to rebuild the market. The outdoor weekend market was disrupted but never closed. Many of the food vendors re-opened for business within weeks of the fire, selling their products outside of the building. In August 2007, the city completed a temporary market annex, known as the &quot;East Hall,&quot; on the opposite side of 7th Street, on the grounds of Hine Junior High School. This housed the vendors until the reopening of the market building, with a ribbon-cutting on June 26, 2009. The Washington, D.C., Fire and Emergency Services Department determined officially that the fire originated outside of the Eastern Market between a dumpster and the exterior of the west wall, and that the fire was caused by an electrical failure on the electric supply wire for a nearby trash compactor. However, former D.C. fire investigators Gerald Pennington and Greg Bowyer have suggested the fire was deliberately set by suspect Joel Ramos.
Eastern Market reopened its doors on June 26, 2009, after two years of reconstruction work. On March 9, 2010, the renovation of the market received the Outstanding Project Award from the Structural Engineering Association of Metropolitan Washington in April. The Market has already received an &quot;Honor Award&quot; in the design category and has been recognized as a National Finalist by the American Counsel of Engineering Companies of Metropolitan Washington. The restoration process was a detailed and challenging effort to re-purpose and salvage various components of the critically damaged building. Among many innovative improvements, the historic roof was restored and state of the art equipment was installed. The design allowed the previously hidden historic skylight to be reintroduced as a prominent architectural feature of the new Eastern Market South Hall. Renovation was overseen by the Department of Real Estate Services and coordinated with Robert Silman Associates and Quinn Evans Architects. Mayor Adrian Fenty moved to have 7th Street, in front of the market, closed to vehicle traffic on the weekends to function as a &quot;pedestrian plaza.&quot;

<text>Mantou (), often referred to as a Chinese steamed bun, is a white and soft type of steamed bread or bun popular in northern China. Folk etymology connects the name &quot;mantou&quot; to a tale about Zhuge Liang.

== Description ==
&quot;Mantou&quot; are typically eaten as a staple food in northern parts of China where wheat, rather than rice, is grown. They are made with milled wheat flour, water and leavening agents. In size and texture, they range from , soft and fluffy in the most elegant restaurants, to over , firm and dense for the working man&#x27;s lunch. As white flour, being more heavily processed, was once more expensive, white &quot;mantou&quot; were something of a luxury in preindustrial China.

Traditionally, &quot;mantou&quot;, &quot;bing&quot;, and wheat noodles were the staple carbohydrates of the northern Chinese diet, analogous to rice, which forms the mainstay of the southern Chinese diet. They are also known in the south but are often served as street food or in restaurants, rather than as a staple or home cooking. Restaurant &quot;mantou&quot; are often smaller and more delicate and can be further manipulated, for example, by deep frying and dipping in sweetened condensed milk. Colors or flavors may be added with other ingredients from brown sugar to food coloring in mantou making. For special occasions, &quot;mantou&quot; are sometimes kneaded into various shapes in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Shandong.

Precooked mantou are commonly sold in the frozen section of Asian supermarkets, ready for preparation by steaming or heating in the microwave oven.

A similar food, but with a savory or sweet filling inside, is &quot;baozi&quot;. &quot;Mantou&quot; is the older word, and in some regions—such as the Jiangnan region of China, and Korea—&quot;mantou&quot; (or the equivalent local reading of the word) can describe both the filled and unfilled buns. In Japan, the equivalent local reading of the Chinese word (&quot;manjū&quot;) refers only to filled buns.

==Etymology and history==
Mantou may have originated in the Qin State of the Zhou dynasty during the reign of King Zhaoxiang (307 BCE – 250 BCE). Mantou as well as other wheat derived foodstuffs such as noodles, Shaobing and Baozi became popular during the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 206 CE) and collectively were known as ; mantou was distinguished as or . During the Western Jin dynasty (265–316 CE), Shu Xi () wrote about steamed cakes () in his &quot;Ode to boiled cakes&quot; (), written around 300 CE. He first called them &quot;mantou&quot; (). In this book, it was advised to eat this in a banquet during the approach of spring.

The Mongols are thought to have taken the filled (&quot;baozi&quot;) style of &quot;mantou&quot; to many countries of Central and East Asia about the beginning of the Yuan dynasty in the 13th century. The name &quot;mantou&quot; is cognate to &quot;manty&quot; and &quot;mantı&quot;; these are filled dumplings in Turkish, Uzbek, (&quot;mantu&quot;) cuisines.

==Folklore==
A popular Chinese legend relates that the name &quot;mantou&quot; actually originated from the homophonous word 蠻頭 &quot;mántóu&quot;, which literally means &quot;barbarian&#x27;s head&quot;.

The legend was set in the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 CE) when Zhuge Liang, the chancellor of the state of Shu Han, led the Shu army on a campaign against Nanman forces in the southern lands of Shu, which correspond to roughly present-day Yunnan, China, and northern Myanmar.

After subduing the Nanman king Meng Huo, Zhuge Liang led the army back to Shu, but met a swift-flowing river which defied all attempts to cross it. A barbarian lord informed him that the river was raging due to the spirits of the enemies(bamboo army) he killed using fire previously and to appease them, in olden days, the barbarians would sacrifice 50 men and throw their heads into the river to appease the river deity and allow them to cross. As Zhuge Liang did not want to cause any more of his men to lose their lives, he ordered his men to slaughter the livestock the army brought along, and fill their meat into buns shaped roughly like human heads (round with a flat base). The buns were then thrown into the river. After a successful crossing, he named the bun &quot;barbarian&#x27;s head&quot; (&quot;mántóu&quot;, 蠻頭, which evolved into the modern 饅頭). Another version of the story relates back to Zhuge Liang&#x27;s southern campaign when he instructed that his soldiers who had fallen sick from diarrhea and other illnesses in the swampy region be fed with steamed buns with meat or sweet fillings.

==Variations of Mantou==

;Northern Chinese Mantou
* Ingredients: Typically made with wheat flour, water, and yeast. They may include a bit of sugar for sweetness.
* Texture: Northern mantou is generally denser and chewier. The dough is often kneaded thoroughly to develop gluten, resulting in a firmer texture.
* Shape and Size: Usually larger and rounder. They can be plain or filled with various ingredients.
* Serving: Often served as a staple side dish with meals, especially in northern regions like Beijing and Shanxi.
;Southern Chinese Mantou
* Ingredients: Also made with wheat flour, but may use different types of flour or add rice flour for a slightly different texture. Sugar is often more prominent in the dough.
* Texture: Southern mantou tends to be softer and fluffier, with a lighter and more delicate texture due to variations in the kneading process and fermentation.
* Shape and Size: Often smaller and can be shaped into different forms. They may also be filled, but plain versions are common as well.
* Serving: Commonly served as a snack or breakfast item, and can be found in various forms, including sweet versions with fillings like red bean paste.

Northern Chinese mantou is denser and more substantial, while Southern Chinese mantou is lighter and fluffier, reflecting regional culinary preferences and local ingredients.

==Variations in meaning outside Northern China==

Prior to the Song dynasty (960–1279), the word &quot;mantou&quot; meant both filled and unfilled buns. The term &quot;baozi&quot; arose in the Song dynasty to indicate filled buns only. As a result, &quot;mantou&quot; gradually came to indicate only unfilled buns in Mandarin and some varieties of Chinese.

In many areas, however, &quot;mantou&quot; still retains its meaning of filled buns. In the Jiangnan region where Wu Chinese is spoken, it usually means both filled and unfilled buns. In Shanxi, where Jin Chinese is spoken, unfilled buns are often called &quot;momo&quot; (饃饃), which is simply the character for &quot;steamed bun&quot;. The name &quot;momo&quot; spread to Tibet and Nepal and usually now refers to filled buns or dumplings.

The name &quot;mantou&quot; is cognate to &quot;manty&quot; and &quot;Manti&quot;; these are filled dumplings in Armenian, Persian, Uzbek, and Pakistani (&quot;mantu&quot;, originated from Turko-Mongol immigrants) cuisines. In Japan, &quot;manjū&quot; (饅頭) usually indicates filled buns, which traditionally contain bean paste or minced meat-vegetable mixture (nikuman 肉まん &quot;meat &quot;manjū&quot;&quot;). Filled &quot;mantou&quot; are called &quot;siyopaw&quot; in Philippine, ultimately derived from Chinese &quot;shāobāo&quot; (). In Thailand they serve &quot;salapao&quot; (ซาลาเปา), a filled &quot;mantou&quot;. In Korea, &quot;mandu&quot; () can refer to both &quot;baozi&quot; (飽子) or &quot;jiaozi&quot; (餃子). In Mongolian cuisine, the &quot;buuz&quot; and &quot;manty&quot; or &quot;mantu&quot; are steamed dumplings, a steamed variation is said to have led to the Korean &quot;mandu&quot;. In Singapore and Malaysia, chili crab is commonly served with a fried version of &quot;mantou&quot;. In Nauru and Papua New Guinea, &quot;mantou&quot; are known as &quot;mãju&quot;.

<doc id="898917" wikidata="Q3549976" url="?curid=898917" title="One-liner program">
<text>In computer programming, a one-liner program originally was textual input to the command line of an operating system shell that performed some function in just one line of input. In the present day, a one-liner can be
* an expression written in the language of the shell;
* the invocation of an interpreter together with program source for the interpreter to run;
* the invocation of a compiler together with source to compile and instructions for executing the compiled program.
Certain dynamic languages for scripting, such as AWK, sed, and Perl, have traditionally been adept at expressing one-liners.
Shell interpreters such as Unix shells or Windows PowerShell allow for the construction of powerful one-liners.

The use of the phrase &quot;one-liner&quot; has been widened to also include program-source for any language that does something useful in one line.

==History==
The concept of a one-liner program has been known since the 1960s with the release of the APL programming language. With its terse syntax and powerful mathematical operators, APL allowed useful programs to be represented in a few symbols.

In the 1970s, one-liners became associated with the rise of the home computer and BASIC. Computer magazines published type-in programs in many dialects of BASIC. Some magazines devoted regular columns solely to impressive short and one-line programs.

The word &quot;One-liner&quot; also has two references in the index of the book &quot;The AWK Programming Language&quot; (the book is often referred to by the abbreviation &quot;TAPL&quot;). It explains the programming language AWK, which is part of the Unix operating system. The authors explain the birth of the &quot;one-liner&quot; paradigm with their daily work on early Unix machines:
Notice that this original definition of a &quot;one-liner&quot; implies immediate execution of the program without any compilation. So, in a strict sense, only source code for interpreted languages qualifies as a &quot;one-liner&quot;. But this strict understanding of a &quot;one-liner&quot; was broadened in 1985 when the IOCCC introduced the category of &quot;Best One Liner&quot; for C, which is a compiled language.

==Examples==
One-liners are also used to show off the differential expressive power of programming languages. Frequently, one-liners are used to demonstrate programming ability. Contests are often held to see who can create the most exceptional one-liner.

===BASIC===

A single line of BASIC can typically hold up to 255 characters, and one liners ranged from simple games to graphical demos. One of the better-known demo one-liners is colloquially known as &quot;10PRINT&quot;, written for the Commodore 64:

10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10
===C===
The following example is a C program (a winning entry in the &quot;Best one-liner&quot; category of the IOCCC).

main(int c,char**v){return!m(v[1],v[2]);}m(char*s,char*t){return*t-42?*s?63==*t|*s==*t&amp;&amp;m(s+1,t+1):!*t:m(s,t+1)||*s&amp;&amp;m(s+1,t);}
This one-liner program is a glob pattern matcher. It understands the glob characters , meaning zero or more characters, and , meaning exactly one character, just like most Unix shells.

Run it with two args, the string and the glob pattern. The exit status is 0 (shell true) when the pattern matches, 1 otherwise. The glob pattern must match the whole string, so you may want to use * at the beginning and end of the pattern if you are looking for something in the middle. Examples:

$ ./a.out foo &#x27;f??&#x27;; echo $?
$ ./a.out &#x27;best short program&#x27; &#x27;??st*o**p?*&#x27;; echo $?
===AWK===
The book &quot;The AWK Programming Language&quot; contains 20 examples of &quot;one-liners&quot; at the end of the book&#x27;s first chapter.

Here are the very first of them:
# Print the total number of input lines (like wc -l): END { print NR }
# Print the tenth input line: NR == 10
# Print the last field of every input line: { print $NF }

===J===
Here are examples in J:
* A function avg to return the average of a list of numbers: avg=: +/ % #
* Quicksort: quicksort=: (($:@(&lt;#[) , (=#[) , $:@(&gt;#[)) ({~ ?@#)) ^: (1&lt;#)

===Perl===
Here are examples in the Perl programming language:
* Look for duplicate words
 perl -0777 -ne &#x27;print &quot;$.: doubled $_\n&quot; while /\b(\w+)\b\s+\b\1\b/gi&#x27; 
* Find Palindromes in /usr/dict/words
 perl -lne &#x27;print if $_ eq reverse&#x27; /usr/dict/words
* in-place edit of *.c files changing all foo to bar
 perl -p -i.bak -e &#x27;s/\bfoo\b/bar/g&#x27; *.c

Many one-liners are practical. For example, the following Perl one-liner will reverse all the bytes in a file:

perl -0777e &#x27;print scalar reverse &lt;&gt;&#x27; filename
While most Perl one-liners are imperative, Perl&#x27;s support for anonymous functions, closures, map, filter (grep) and fold (List::Util::reduce) allows the creation of &#x27;functional&#x27; one-liners.

This one-liner creates a function that can be used to return a list of primes up to the value of the first parameter:

my $z = sub { grep { $a=$_; !grep { !($a % $_) } (2..$_-1)} (2..$_[0]) }

It can be used on the command line, like this:

 perl -e&#x27;$,=&quot;,&quot;;print sub { grep { $a=$_; !grep { !($a % $_) } (2..$_-1)} (2..$_[0]) }-&gt;(shift)&#x27; number

to print out a comma-separated list of primes in the range 2 - number.

===Haskell===
The following Haskell program is a one-liner: it sorts its input lines ASCIIbetically.

main = (mapM_ putStrLn . Data.List.sort . lines) =« getContents -- In ghci a qualified name like Data.List.sort will work, although as a standalone executable you&#x27;d need to import Data.List.
An even shorter version:

main = interact (unlines . Data.List.sort . lines) -- Ditto.
Usable on the command line like:

cat filename | ghc -e &quot;interact (unlines . Data.List.sort . lines)&quot;
===Racket===
The following Racket program is equivalent to the above Haskell example:

#lang racket
(for-each displayln (sort (port-&gt;lines) string&lt;?))

and this can be used on the command line as follows:
 racket -e &#x27;(for-each displayln (sort (port-&gt;lines) string&lt;?))&#x27;

===Python===
Performing one-liners directly on the Unix command line can be accomplished by using Python&#x27;s -cmd flag (-c for short), and typically requires the import of one or more modules. Statements are separated using &quot;;&quot; instead of newlines. For example, to print the last field of unix long listing:
 ls -l | python -c &quot;
import sys;[sys.stdout.write(&#x27; &#x27;.join([line.split(&#x27; &#x27;)[-1]])) for line in sys.stdin]&quot;

====Python wrappers====
Several open-source scripts have been developed to facilitate the construction of Python one-liners. Scripts such as 
pyp or Pyline import commonly used modules and provide more human-readable variables in an attempt to make Python functionality more accessible on the command line. Here is a redo of the above example (printing the last field of a unix long listing):

ls -l | pyp &quot;whitespace[-1]&quot; # &quot;whitespace&quot; represents each line split on white space in pyp
ls -l | pyline &quot;words[-1]&quot; # &quot;words&quot; represents each line split on white space in pyline
====Executable libraries====
The Python CGIHTTPServer module for example is also an executable library that performs as a web server with CGI. To start the web server enter:
$ python -m CGIHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 …

===Tcl===
Tcl (Tool Command Language) is a dynamic programming/scripting language based on concepts of Lisp, C, and Unix shells. It can be used interactively, or by running scripts (programs) which can use a package system for structuring.

Many strings are also well-formed lists. Every simple word is a list of length one, and elements of longer lists are separated by whitespace. For instance, a string that corresponds to a list of three elements:

set example {foo bar grill}
Strings with unbalanced quotes or braces, or non-space characters directly following closing braces, cannot be parsed as lists directly. You can explicitly split them to make a list.

The &quot;constructor&quot; for lists is of course called list. It&#x27;s recommended to use when elements come from variable or command substitution (braces won&#x27;t do that). As Tcl commands are lists anyway, the following is a full substitute for the list command:

proc list args {set args}
===Windows PowerShell===
Finding palindromes in file words.txt

Get-Content words.txt | Where { $_ -eq -join $_[($_.length-1)..0] }
Piping semantics in PowerShell help enable complex scenarios with one-liner programs. This one-liner in PowerShell script takes a list of names and counts from a comma-separated value file, and returns the sum of the counts for each name.

ipcsv .\fruit.txt –H F, C|Group F|%{@{&quot;$($_.Name)&quot;=($_.Group|measure C -sum).Sum}}|sort value

<doc id="898918" wikidata="Q5325613" url="?curid=898918" title="Eanmund">
<text>Eanmund was a Swedish prince of the Scylfing dynasty, whose existence is alleged in &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

== Life according to &quot;Beowulf&quot;==
Unlike his relatives, Eanmund is only mentioned in Beowulf. Eanmund was the son of Ohthere, and was the brother of Eadgils. If he existed in real life, his real name was probably Proto-Norse *&quot;Aiwamunduz&quot; (Old East Norse &quot;Ēmund&quot;) or &quot;Āmunduz&quot; (Old East Norse &quot;Āmund&quot;).
Ohthere died, and Ohthere&#x27;s younger brother Onela, usurped the Swedish throne. Since their uncle had seized power, Eanmund and Eadgils sought refuge among the Geats. This caused Onela to attack the Geats, an attack which was also motivated by the fact that the Geatish thane Eofor had killed Onela&#x27;s father Ongentheow. During the battle, Eanmund was killed by Onela&#x27;s champion Weohstan and Heardred was killed as well. Eadgils, however, survived and according to the poem Beowulf later helped him avenge Eanmund and Ohthere by slaying Onela, an event which also appears in Scandinavian sources.

In the tale, Weohstan took Eanmund&#x27;s sword which was inherited by his son Wiglaf who used the sword when fighting the dragon together with Beowulf.

<text>Citizen Band were a New Zealand band formed by the brothers Geoff and Mike Chunn, both of whom had previously been members of Split Enz.

== Band members ==

Geoff Chunn played guitar, sang, and wrote most of the songs. Mike Chunn played bass guitar. Other members were guitarist Greg Clark and drummer Brent Eccles, both previously in New Zealand glam rock band Space Waltz. Formed in 1977 after Mike Chunn left Split Enz due to his struggles with agoraphobia, the band played concerts around Auckland including a free concert in Albert Park and a one-day rock festival. The band recorded their first album &quot;Citizen Band&quot; at Mandrill studios, produced by the band and Glyn Tucker.

Their second album &quot;Just Drove Thru Town&quot; was recorded at Mandrill Studios on 18–30 June 1979. It was produced by Jay Lewis and engineered by Glyn Tucker. Two singles were released from the album, &quot;Rust in My Car&quot;/&quot;Dig That Tex&quot; and &quot;No Stereo&quot;/&quot;SOS&quot;.

After the band moved to Australia, Mike Chunn left the band, and was replaced by Roland Killeen. The band broke up in 1982.

Citizen Band&#x27;s original lineup could be regarded as a New Zealand supergroup, as both Chunn brothers were previously in Split Enz, and Clark and Eccles were in glam rock band Space Waltz.

==Discography==
== Concerts ==
In 2012, Citizen Band, along with other NZ bands who played at The Gluepot in the 1970s: Dragon, Hello Sailor, and Street Talk, reunited for a &#x27;Gluepot Reunion&#x27; concert.

On 27 May 2016, Citizen Band reformed for a one-off concert at the inaugural Sounds Session organised by The Sound radio station at the Tuning Fork in Auckland. Tickets could only be obtained by winning them from the radio station via a TXT message sent when an earlier named New Zealand song was played (May is New Zealand Music Month).

The play list was:
# Good Morning Citizen
# The Man&#x27;s A Wonder
# Dig That Tex
# Julia
# Rust in My Car
# I Feel Good
and then an encore of &quot;Hold Tight&quot; a cover of a Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich song.

<doc id="898930" wikidata="Q15522038" url="?curid=898930" title="Michael Brown (writer)">
<text>Michael Brown (December 14, 1920 – June 11, 2014) was an American composer, lyricist, writer, director, producer, and performer. He was born in Mexia, Texas. His musical career began in New York cabaret, performing first at Le Ruban Bleu. In the 1960s, he was a producer of industrial musicals for major American corporations such as J.C. Penney and DuPont. For the DuPont pavilion at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Brown wrote and produced a musical revue, &quot;The Wonderful World of Chemistry&quot; staged 48 times a day by two simultaneous casts in adjacent theaters. For years, he maintained a reunion directory of the cast and crew, which included Robert Downey, Sr. as a stage manager. 2005 mailing: “After all, it was a remarkable time in all of our lives. We can be fairly certain nothing like it will be seen again. Love all round, Mike.” Several of his songs have entered the American repertoire, including &quot;Lizzie Borden&quot; and &quot;The John Birch Society,&quot; which were popularized by the Chad Mitchell Trio.
Children know him best as the author of three Christmas books about Santa&#x27;s helper, Santa Mouse.

==Cabaret and off-Broadway==
His off-Broadway and cabaret contributions of music and lyrics were myriad. In 1948, performing his own music and lyrics, he auditioned for Julius Monk. His engagement at Le Ruban Bleu lasted a record 54 weeks. Returning to cabaret every ten years or so, he performed at The Blue Angel, the Ballroom, Plaza 9, Upstairs at the Downstairs, and The Savoy in London.
He wrote the words and music for songs that were featured in all of Julius Monk&#x27;s cabaret revues, including &quot;Four Below&quot;, 1956; &quot;Take Five&quot;, 1957; &quot;Four Below Strikes Back&quot;, 1959; &quot;Dressed to the Nines&quot;, 1960; &quot;Seven Come Eleven&quot;, 1961; &quot;Dime a Dozen&quot;, 1962; &quot;Baker&#x27;s Dozen&quot;, 1964; and &quot;Bits and Pieces XIV&quot;, 1964. His songs for these revues included &quot;Lola Montez,&quot; “Won&#x27;t You Come Home, Judge Crater,&quot; “Love Letters Written to My Mother,&quot; “Don&#x27;t Let Them Take the Paramount,&quot; and &quot;The Third Avenue El.”
Dan Dietz wrote about &quot;The Third Avenue El&quot;: &quot;This sweetly nostalgic song about the passing of a New York City landmark resonates more than ever today, and is particularly touching in its wish that vanished New York sites might always be with us, if not in concrete and steel, then at least in memory.&quot;

His musical, &quot;Is There Intelligent Life on Earth?&quot; was produced in Bristol, UK, in 1964. Songs in that production included &quot;Blue-Green Planet,&quot; “Communicate with Me,&quot; “Serene Morning in Jersey,&quot; and &quot;Goodbye, Old World.”

==Broadway==
His first work on Broadway was the song &quot;Lizzie Borden&quot; in Leonard Sillman&#x27;s &quot;New Faces of 1952&quot; filmed as New Faces. It was later recorded by the Chad Mitchell Trio, who also recorded his &quot;John Birch Society.&quot; In 2004, he wrote to Julie Harris: &quot;There was never any objection—at least none that I heard—that the number was about a brutal double murder. Time seemed to tidy up all the blood. Even so, Leonard Sillman asked me to replace the original final chorus.&quot;

&quot;New Faces of 1952&quot; was revived in 1982.

He wrote the lyrics to Harold Arlen’s music for Pearl Bailey’s show-stopping number &quot;Indoor Girl&quot; in &quot;House of Flowers&quot;. In 1956 he contributed the song &quot;The Washingtons are Doing OK&quot; for Leonard Sillman&#x27;s New Faces of 1956. He also wrote a production number for the Carol Channing company of &quot;Sugar Babies&quot;.

Michael Brown wrote the book, lyrics, and music for the nineteen-day run of &quot;Different Times,&quot; and directed the production. The story followed multiple generations of one family, and was presented at the ANTA Theater, opening on May 1, 1972. The cast album was recorded in 1987.

==One-man show==
In the 1970s, he wrote and extensively toured &quot;Out of Step: The Great American Nut Show&quot; in which he presented the results of his lifelong fascination with such people as John Dillinger, Starr Faithfull, Judge Crater, Aimee Semple McPherson, and the original Siamese twins, Chang and Eng. He shared his years of researching letters, rare photographs, newsreel footage, and examples of signs-of-the-times, through the use of slides, film, and song and dance. His songs to accompany the tale of each of his special people ranged from satirical comment, such as an unemotional campaign song for Calvin &quot;Silent Cal&quot; Coolidge, to sensitive ballads revealing a particular tragedy or grief in a person&#x27;s life, such as Baby Doe Tabor. One of the most touching songs was his musical setting of &quot;Starr Faithfull&#x27;s Last Letter.&quot; She was a beautiful, young playgirl in the 1930s whose death remains a mystery to this day.

==Personal life==
Brown started reading at age 4 and playing piano at age 6. In 1940, at the age of 19, he was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the Plan II program at the University of Texas, Austin. After attending Harvard University and the University of Iowa, he defended his master&#x27;s thesis in English Literature, on the writer Wilkie Collins, at the University of Virginia.
During World War II he enlisted in the Army Air Forces on April 6, 1944. He attended Officers’ Candidate School at Yale, where Glenn Miller played in the mess hall. He served with the 723rd Army Air Forces Base Unit as a Cryptographic Officer (0224). The bulk of his time was spent in the Caribbean where he wrote and performed songs when not deciphering phantom enemy submarine signals. Up to the time of his discharge on June 4, 1946, he used his name given at birth, Marion Martin Brown, II.
He moved to New York City in 1947. Thereafter, he used the name Michael. In 1950 he married Joy Williams Brown, a former ballerina who trained at the School of American Ballet and joined Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in New York at the invitation of George Balanchine. She also danced in Europe as a principal with Roland Petit&#x27;s Les Ballets de Paris. Michael Brown became friends with Margot Fonteyn through his wife, Joy, and was thus introduced to the ballet world.

With his wife Joy, he had three children, Michael Martin Brown, Jr. of Hoboken, New Jersey, born in 1951; Kelly Kennedy Brown of Portland, Oregon, born in 1954; and Adam Anderson Brown born in 1964. Adam died in 1994.

Michael Brown died June 11, 2014, at the age of 93 New York City.

On November 4, 2014, a Memorial Celebration was held at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts and speakers included Michael Feinstein, Jefferson Mays, and Charles Strouse.

The couple was instrumental in the career of Harper Lee, whom Michael met through his friend Truman Capote. The Browns made it possible for Lee to work on &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by giving her the gift of a year&#x27;s financial support in 1956 with the note: &quot;You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas.&quot;
Harper Lee wrote about this Christmas gift in &quot;McCalls&quot; magazine in December 1961. However, neither she nor the Browns ever disclosed their names, which led to years of speculation in literary circles until the 2006 publication of Charles J. Shields’ unauthorized biography &quot;Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee&quot;.
Confirmation of the story occurred when the Browns broke their silence in interviews they gave for Mary Murphy’s documentary &quot;Harper Lee: Hey, Boo&quot; presented by PBS in the &quot;American Masters&quot; series in 2012.

==Santa Mouse==
In 1966, as the result of a casual inquiry, he wrote the children&#x27;s Christmas story &quot;Santa Mouse&quot;. That book was followed in 1968 by &quot;Santa Mouse Where Are You?&quot; and, in 1969, by &quot;Santa Mouse Meets Marmaduke&quot;. To avoid confusion with the Marmaduke comic strip, this was re-titled &quot;Santa Mouse Meets Montague&quot; when a compilation of all three books was republished under the title &quot;Santa Mouse Stories.&quot;

<doc id="898937" wikidata="Q492145" url="?curid=898937" title="Tokenism">
<text>In sociology, tokenism is the social practice of making a perfunctory and symbolic effort towards the equitable inclusion of members of a minority group, especially by recruiting people from under-represented social-minority groups in order for the organization to give the public appearance of racial and gender equality, usually within a workplace, government, or a school. The sociological purpose of tokenism is to give the appearance of inclusivity to a workplace or a school that is not as culturally diverse (racial, religious, sexual, etc.) as the rest of society.

==History==
The social concept and the employment practice of &quot;tokenism&quot; became understood in the popular culture of the United States in the late 1950s. In the face of racial segregation, tokenism emerged as a solution that though earnest in effort, only acknowledged an issue without actually solving it. In the book &quot;Why We Can&#x27;t Wait&quot; (1964), civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. discussed the subject of tokenism, and how it constitutes a minimal acceptance of black people to the mainstream of U.S. society.

When asked about the gains of the Civil Rights Movement in 1963, human rights activist Malcolm X answered: &quot;Tokenism is hypocrisy. One little student in the University of Mississippi, that&#x27;s hypocrisy. A handful of students in Little Rock, Arkansas, is hypocrisy. A couple of students going to school in Georgia is hypocrisy. Integration in America is hypocrisy in the rawest form. And the whole world can see it. All this little tokenism that is dangled in front of the Negro and then he&#x27;s told, &#x27;See what we&#x27;re doing for you, Tom.&#x27; Why the whole world can see that this is nothing but hypocrisy? All you do is make your image worse; you don&#x27;t make it better.&quot; Malcolm X highlights that tokenism is used as a tool by America to improve its image but fails in its attempts. For instance, in 1954, the United States ruled segregation in public schools unconstitutional through the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; case. Malcolm X references Little Rock, Arkansas, where nine students sought to fight for their rights to attend school. On September 4, 1957, Arkansas National Guard troops were sent around Central High School to prevent the entry of nine African American students into an all-white school, defying federal law. President Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and enforced federal troops to uphold the law. While this marked the day that ignited change within Arkansas&#x27; school system for African-American children, desegregation did not constitute equality. All nine of the students were brutally bullied by white students and this behavior was encouraged by the school&#x27;s administration. Malcolm X&#x27;s example of Little Rock exemplifies how tokenism can be intended to create the impression of social inclusiveness and diversity without bringing about any significant changes to the inclusion of underrepresented groups.

== In psychology ==
In the field of psychology, the broader definition of tokenism is a situation in which a member of a distinctive category is treated differently from other people. The characteristics that make the person of interest a token can be perceived as either a handicap or an advantage, as supported by Václav Linkov. In a positive light, these distinct people can be seen as experts in their racial/cultural category, valued skills, or a different perspective on a project. In contrast, tokenism is most often seen as a handicap due to the ostracism of a selected sample of a minority group. Linkov also attributes drawbacks in psychology to Cultural and Numerical Tokenism, instances that have shifted where value of expertise is placed and its effect on proliferating information that is not representative of all the possible facts.

== In the workplace ==
A Harvard Business School professor, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, asserted back in 1977 that a token employee is usually part of a &quot;socially-skewed group&quot; of employees who belong to a minority group that constitutes less than 15% of the total employee population of the workplace.

By definition, token employees in a workplace are known to be few; hence, their alleged high visibility among the staff subjects them to greater pressure to perform their work at higher production standards of quality and volume and to behave in the expected, stereotypical manner. Given the smallness of the group of token employees in a workplace, the individual identity of each token person is usually disrespected by the dominant group, who apply a stereotype role to them as a means of social control in the workplace. In order to avoid tokenism within the workplace, diversity and inclusion must be integrated to foster an environment where people feel connected and included. Employees must be hired on the basis of their capabilities rather than their gender, ethnicity, race, and sexuality.

Tokenism can also have an impact on mental health in the workplace. According to one study, racial minorities also experience heightened performance pressures related to their race and gender; however, many reported that racial problems were more common than gender problems. Being a token makes one appear more visible within the workplace, placing more scrutiny and pressure for them to represent an entire group. Anxiety, stress, exhaustion, guilt, shame and burnout can arise from overworking in efforts to become a good representative of their identity group.

In professor Kanter&#x27;s work on tokenism and gender, she found that the problems experienced by women in typically male-dominated occupations were due solely to the skewed proportions of men and women in these occupations. For example, women are often underrepresented within the STEM field, where women also sometimes face more hostile working environments where discrimination and sexual harassment are more frequent. Women in STEM may experience greater performance pressure to work harder in a male-dominated field while also experiencing social isolation from the males within their workplace. The pressure to perform better can be influenced by the stereotype of women being less competent in mathematics and science. These non-inclusive measures contribute to the lack of women in STEM.

Professor Kanter found that being a token evoked three behaviour consequences of visibility, polarization, and assimilation. Firstly, tokens often felt that they were being watched all the time, leading to the feeling of more pressure to perform well. In attempts to perform well, tokens will feel the need to work harder and strive for perfection. Secondly, polarization implies that the dominant group are uncomfortable around tokens or feel threatened by them due to their differences. As a result, tokens may experience social isolation from the exclusion of the majority group. Finally, tokens will feel the need to assimilate to the stereotyped caricature of their roles. For instance, women will feel forced to perform the “suitable behaviour&quot; of a woman in reinforcing the behaviour of stereotypes attached to which they are associated with.

There has been much debate surrounding the concept of tokenism behind women directors on corporate boards. Since men disproportionately occupy the majority of board seats globally, governments and corporations have attempted to address this inequitable distribution of seats through reform measures. Reform measures include legislation mandating gender representation on corporate boards of directors, which has been the focus of societal and political debates. All-male boards typically recruit women to improve specialized skills and to bring different values to decision making. In particular, women introduce useful female leadership qualities and skills like risk averseness, less radical decision-making, and more sustainable investment strategies. However, the mandate of gender diversity may also harm women. Some critics of the mandate believe that it makes women seem like &quot;space fillers,&quot; which undermines the qualifications that women can bring to their jobs.

==In politics==
In politics, allegations of tokenism may occur when a political party puts forward candidates from under-represented groups, such as women or racial minorities, in races that the party has little or no chance of winning, while making limited or no effort to ensure that such candidates have similar opportunity to win the nomination in races where the party is safe or favoured. The &quot;token&quot; candidates are frequently submitted as paper candidates, while nominations in competitive or safe seats continue to favor members of the majority group.

The end result of such an approach is that the party&#x27;s slate of candidates maintains the appearance of diversity, but members of the majority group remain overrepresented in the party&#x27;s caucus after the election—and thus little to no substantive progress toward greater inclusion of underrepresented groups has actually occurred.

Legal scholar David Schraub writes about the use of &quot;dissident minorities&quot; by political movements to give themselves a veneer of legitimacy while promoting policies that the majority of the minority group opposes. He uses the examples of Anti-Zionist Jews and African-American conservatives, both of which dissent from their demographic group&#x27;s consensus position on matters critical to their group&#x27;s collective liberation or interests. These &quot;dissidents&quot; from minority groups are accused of either allowing the majority to tokenize them, or willingly tokenizing themselves as a shield against complaints and accusations made by the rest of that minority, and an excuse for the majority to avoid addressing or considering the concerns of the minority in question. Sometimes they may actively work to exclude non-dissident members of their group, to preserve their social and political power within the movement they support. Schraub contends that the majority of the movement dissident minorities support values them not for their contributions but for their identity, since more weight is given to people of minority background when talking about issues concerning that minority. If they break ranks and criticize their political movement, they often find themselves shunned, since they are no longer a reliable token.

==In fiction==

In fiction, token characters represent groups which vary from the norm (usually defined as a white, heterosexual male) and are otherwise excluded from the story. The token character can be based on ethnicity (e.g. black, Hispanic, Asian), religion (e.g. Jewish, Muslim), sexual orientation (e.g., gay), gender (typically a female character in a predominantly male cast) or disability. Token characters are usually background characters, and, as such, are usually disposable and are eliminated from the narrative early in the story, in order to enhance the drama, while conserving the main characters.

==In television==
Tokenism, in a television setting, can be any act of putting a minority into the mix to create some sort of publicly viewed diversity. A racial divide in TV has been present since the first television show that hired minorities, &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; (1928–1960), in 1943. Regardless of whether a token character may be stereotypical or not, tokenism can initiate a whole biased perception that may conflict with how people see a specific race, culture, gender or ethnicity. From &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, America Ferrera states: “Tokenism is about inserting diverse characters because you feel you have to; true diversity means writing characters that aren&#x27;t just defined by the color of their skin, and casting the right actor for the role&quot;.

Ethnic and racial representation in television has been proven as an educational basis to inform mass audiences. However, tokenism leads to a narrow representation of minority groups, and this trend often leads to minority characters being exposed in negative or stereotypical fashions. Research done as early as the 1970s suggests an early recognition and disapproval of tokenism and its effects on perceptions of minority groups—specifically, perceptions of African Americans. Tokenism seemed to be used as a quick fix for the complete void of major/recurring minority roles in television, but its skewed representation lacked room for thoroughly independent and positive roles. Throughout that decade, major broadcast networks including NBC and ABC held a collective 10:1 ratio of white characters to black characters, a much smaller margin of which had recurring African American characters. At that, the representation of African American women was much slimmer. The use of these token characters often portrayed African American people to stand in sidekick positions to their white counterparts. Research completed on token ethnic characters into the new millennium has found that the representation of males has grown in numbers, but has not improved in negative portrayal. Statistics on token ethnic characters still suggest toxic masculinity in African American males; threateningly powerful stereotypes of African American women; hyper-sexuality of African American and Asian women; and effeminate characteristics in Asian men and men of other racial minorities.

== In the media ==
Just like television, tokenism in the media has changed over time to coincide with real-life events. During the years of 1946–87, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was analyzed to determine how often and in what situations black people were being portrayed in the magazine&#x27;s cartoon section. Over the 42 years of research, there was only one U.S. black main character in a cartoon where race was not the main theme, race was actually completely irrelevant. All cartoons from the earliest times depicted black people in the U.S. in stereotypical roles. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, cartoons were mostly racially themed, and depicted black people in &quot;token&quot; roles where they are only there to create a sense of inclusion.

Tokenism appears in advertising as well as other subdivisions of major media. Tokenism is interpreted as reinforcing subtle representations of minorities in commercials. Studies have shown that, among other racial minorities, Asian Americans are targeted by advertising companies to fulfill casting diversity, but are the most likely ethnic minority to be placed in the backgrounds of advertisements.

Black characters being the first characters to die was first identified in Hollywood horror movies of the 1930s, notes writer Renee Cozier. The Oscars ceremonies have received criticism over a lack of representation of people of color, as critics have pointed towards a lack of minorities nominated for awards, particularly in 2015 and 2016, when not a single actor of color was nominated. Around this time, minorities accounted for 12.9% of lead roles in 163 films surveyed in 2014, according to the 2016 Hollywood Diversity Report.

=== Film examples ===
Since the release of the original three &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and the later three prequels, there has been much discussion, on Twitter and Reddit especially, of this use of tokenism. The character of Lando Calrissian (portrayed by Billy Dee Williams) and Mace Windu (portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson) have been cited as two human characters of a racial minority that appear on screen. Lando was one of the first developed black characters in a science-fiction film at the time. Loyola Marymount University Professor of African American Studies, Adilifu Nama, has stated that this character is &quot;a form of tokenism that placed one of the most optimistic faces on racial inclusion in a genre that had historically excluded Black representation.&quot;

When the first film of the newest installment of the franchise, &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, was released in 2015, the conversation shifted. Where in the past two trilogies the main three characters were two white men and a white woman, in the new trilogy the main trio consists of a black man (John Boyega), a Hispanic man (Oscar Isaac), and a white woman (Daisy Ridley).

Directed by Ryan Coogler, the film &quot;Black Panther&quot; portrays the heroes of the fictional African kingdom of Wakanda as godlike. They possess otherworldly sophistication by virtue of their blackness, in contrast to longstanding tendencies in mainstream film toward tokenism, stereotyping, and victimhood in depictions of people of African descent. The superhero the Black Panther, a.k.a. King T’Challa, learns to stand in solidarity with the oppressed, even those in whose oppression he has been unwittingly complicit, such as the children of the African diaspora. As a result, the film can function as catalyst for reflection on the part of viewers in terms of how they might perceive more clearly the complexity, variety, and ambiguity represented by blackness, whether others’ or their own, and how they, too, might identify with the Other.

In &quot;G.B.F.&quot;, directed by Darren Stein, the film tells the journey of two closeted gay teens, Tanner and Brent, on their quest to popularity in high school. The film explores the theme of tokenism through demonstrating the desire of a homosexual male best friend by typically heterosexual women. The three most popular girls in school: Fawcett Brooks, Caprice Winters, and &#x27;Shley Osgood believe that the key to winning the prom queen title is through acquiring a gay best friend. In media, gay best friends are displayed as sassy, effeminate, fashionable, and flamboyant, making them act as a stock character accessory to the main character. While Tanner and Brent plan to become popular through exposing their sexuality, the girls are disappointed to find out that Tanner contradicts the stereotypical gay men they have seen in television. The film shows how harmful it can be to associate gay stereotypes with gay characters.

Film critic Armond White cited the &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; Greatest Films of All Time poll in 2022 as an example of tokenism. He wrote that the poll had become &quot;a referendum on political correctness&quot; which &quot;prefers feminist, black, queer politics—not cinephilia.

<text>A bailer in hydrogeology is a hollow tube used to retrieve groundwater samples from monitoring wells. The wells are typically built out of PVC casing which is slotted to allow groundwater to flow freely through the well. Bailers are tied to a piece of rope (usually made from nylon or polypropylene) or a piece of wire (composed of Teflon or stainless steel) and lowered into the water column. Once lowered, the bailer uses a simple ball check valve to seal at the bottom in order to pull up a sample of the groundwater table. Bailers can be disposable or reusable, and they are made out of polyethylene, PVC, FEP or stainless steel.

There are advantages and disadvantages to using bailers for groundwater sampling. Bailers are simple devices to use and are relatively inexpensive. Disposable bailers are usually cleaned to United States Environmental Protection Agency specifications and individually packaged to protect sample integrity. In addition, bailers can be lowered to any depth while pumps have sharp limitations on the depth of the well. The main drawback of using bailers is aeration of the water as the sample is obtained, which could release volatile organic compounds that need to be tested. Also, if there is a high amount of sediment or turbidity, this may interfere with the ball check valve seating correctly.

A basic disposable bailer can also be used as the slug in a Slug test to remove water from the well. This is sometimes referred to more specifically as the bail-down test. A disposable bailer is light and easy to carry in field conditions in comparison to a heavy solid slug. On the other hand, bailers cannot be used to do falling head tests (i.e. where the slug is quickly dropped below the water table). Bailers&#x27; check valve not seating properly and water potentially splashing off from the top of the bailer are other issues which might compromise test results.

<doc id="898959" wikidata="Q1478661" url="?curid=898959" title="Ray system">
<text>In planetary geology, a ray system comprises radial streaks of fine &quot;ejecta&quot; thrown out during the formation of an impact crater, looking somewhat like many thin spokes coming from the hub of a wheel. The rays may extend for lengths up to several times the diameter of their originating crater, and are often accompanied by small secondary craters formed by larger chunks of ejecta. Ray systems have been identified on the Moon, Earth (Kamil Crater), Mercury, and some moons of the outer planets. Originally it was thought that they existed only on planets or moons lacking an atmosphere, but more recently they have been identified on Mars in infrared images taken from orbit by &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot;″s thermal imager.
Rays appear at visible, and in some cases infrared wavelengths, when ejecta are made of material with different reflectivity (i.e., albedo) or thermal properties from the surface on which they are deposited. Typically, visible rays have a higher albedo than the surrounding surface. More rarely an impact will excavate low albedo material, for example basaltic-lava deposits on the lunar maria. Thermal rays, as seen on Mars, are especially apparent at night when slopes and shadows do not influence the infrared energy emitted by the Martian surface.

The layering of rays across other surface features can be useful as an indicator of the relative age of the impact crater, because over time various processes obliterate the rays. On non-atmosphered bodies such as the Moon, space weathering from exposure to cosmic rays and micrometeorites causes a steady reduction of the differential between the ejecta&#x27;s albedo and that of the underlying material. Micrometeorites in particular produce a glassy melt in the regolith that lowers the albedo. Rays can also become covered by lava flows (such as those of Lichtenberg on the moon), or by other impact craters or ejecta.
== Lunar rays ==
The physical nature of lunar rays has historically been a subject of speculation. Early hypotheses suggested that they were deposits of salt from evaporated water. Later they were thought to be deposits of volcanic ash or streaks of dust. After the impact origin of craters became accepted, Eugene Shoemaker suggested during the 1960s that the rays were the result of fragmented ejecta material.

Recent studies suggest that the relative brightness of a lunar ray system is not always a reliable indicator of the age of a ray system. Instead the albedo also depends on the portion of iron oxide (FeO). Low portions of FeO result in brighter materials, so such a ray system can retain its lighter appearance for longer periods. Thus the material composition needs to be factored into the albedo analysis to determine age. 

Among the lunar craters on the near side with pronounced ray systems are Aristarchus, Copernicus, Kepler, Proclus, Dionysius, Glushko, and Tycho. Smaller examples include Censorinus, Stella, and Linné. Similar ray systems also occur on the far side of the Moon, such as the rays radiating from the craters Giordano Bruno, Necho, Ohm, Jackson, King, and the small but prominent Pierazzo.

Most lateral transport of primary ejecta from impact craters is limited to a distance of a few crater radii, but some larger impacts, such as the impacts that made the Copernicus and Tycho craters, launched primary ejecta halfway around the moon. 

North Ray and South Ray craters, each with a clear ray system, were observed from the ground by the astronauts of Apollo 16 in 1972.

<doc id="898981" wikidata="Q35108" url="?curid=898981" title="Bench language">
<text>Bench (&quot;Bencnon&quot;, Shenon or Mernon, formerly called Gimira) is a Northern Omotic language of the &quot;Gimojan&quot; subgroup, spoken by about 174,000 people (in 1998) in the Bench Maji Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region, in southern Ethiopia, around the towns of Mizan Teferi and Shewa Gimira. In a 2006 dissertation, Christian Rapold described three varieties of Bench (Benchnon, Shenon, and Mernon) as &quot;...mutually intelligible...varieties of one and the same language&quot;. Bench is the ancestral language of the Bench people.

In unusual variance from most of the other languages in Africa, Bench has retroflex consonant phonemes. The language is also noteworthy in that it has six phonemic tones, one of only a handful of languages in the world that have this many. Bench has a whistled form used primarily by male speakers, which permits communication over greater distances than spoken Bench. The whistle can be created using the lips or made from a hollow created with both hands. Additionally, this form of the language may be communicated via the 5-stringed krar.

==Phonology==
The phonemic vowels of Bench are .

There are six phonemic tones: five level tones (numbered 1 to 5 in the literature, with 1 being the lowest) and one rising tone 23 . The top tone is sometimes realized as a high rising 45 . On the vowel &quot;o,&quot; they are 

The consonants are:
All of these can occur palatalized, but only before , suggesting an alternate analysis of a sixth phonemic vowel . Labialized consonants are reported for and , but their phonemic status is unclear; they only occur after .

For the phoneme the realizations of and [f] are in free variation; has the allophone before back vowels.

The syllable structure is (C)V(C)(C)(C) + tone or (C) N (C), where C represents any consonant, V any vowel, N any nasal, and brackets an optional element. CC clusters consist of a continuant followed by a plosive, fricative, or affricate; in CCC clusters, the first consonant must be one of or , the second either or a voiceless fricative, and the third or .

==Grammar==

===Nouns===

Plurals may optionally be formed by adding the suffix ; however, these are rarely used except with definite nouns. E.g.: &quot;her relatives&quot;; &quot;all the people&quot;.

===Pronouns===

====Personal pronouns====
The word goes slightly beyond being a reflexive pronoun; it can mark any third person that refers to the subject of the sentence, e.g.:

The oblique form is basic, and serves as object, possessive, and adverbial. The subject form has three variants: normal (given above), emphatic - used when the subject is particularly prominent in the sentence, especially sentence-initially - and reduced, used as part of a verb phrase. The &quot;locative&quot; term means &quot;to, at, or for one&#x27;s own place or house&quot;, e.g.:

====Determiners====
The main determiners are &quot;that, the&quot; (masc. , fem. , pl. ) and &quot;this&quot; (masc. , fem. , pl. ). As suffixes on a verb or an ablative or locative phrase, they indicate a relative clause. E.g.:

===Demonstratives===
The demonstratives include &quot;here&quot;, &quot;there (nearby)&quot;, &quot;there (far away)&quot;, &quot;down there&quot;, &quot;up there&quot;. Alone, or with the determiner suffixes or added, these function as demonstrative pronouns &quot;this person&quot;, &quot;that person&quot;, etc. With the noun phrase marker , they become demonstrative adjectives. E.g.:

===Numbers===
The numbers are:
20, 30, etc. are formed by adding &quot;ten&quot; (with tone change) to the unit. In compound numbers, is added to each &#x27;figure, thus:

:13 
:236 

When a cardinal number functions as an adjective, the suffix can be added &quot;(e.g.&quot; &quot;three children&quot;). Ordinal numbers are formed by suffixing to the cardinal, e.g.: &quot;fourth&quot;.

===Adjectives===
Adjectives are sometimes intensified by changing the tone to top; e.g. &quot;big&quot; → &quot;very big&quot;.

===Verbs===
Verbs with monosyllabic roots can have three different forms of their active stems: the singular imperative, which is just the root; the past stem, usually identical to the root but sometimes formed by adding &quot;-k&quot; (with changes to the preceding consonant); and the future stem, usually identical to the root but sometimes formed by changing the tone from mid 3 to high 4 or from bottom 1 to top 5. Some have causative (formed by adding or , and changing mid tone to high) and passive (formed by adding , , or to the causative) forms. Verbal nouns are formed from the stem, sometimes with tone change or addition or .

Verbs with polysyllabic roots have at least two forms, one with an intransitive or passive meaning and one with a transitive or causative meaning; the former ends in , the latter in . A passive may be formed by ending in . Verbal nouns are formed by taking the bare stem without or .

Compound verbs are formed with &quot;say&quot; or &quot;cause to say&quot;, a formation common among Ethiopian languages.

The primary tenses are simple past (formed from the past stem), future (future stem plus ), present perfect (from present participle stem); negative (future stem plus .) E.g.: → &quot;he went&quot;; &quot;he will go&quot;; &quot;he has gone&quot;.

There are four corresponding participles: past (formed from the past stem), present perfect (formed from the past stem with the suffix , , or ), imperfect (formed from the future stem with the stative suffix ), and negative (formed from the future stem with the negative suffix or or a person/number marker.)
The order of affixes is: root-(tense)-(negative)-(foc. pn.)-person/number-marker.

==Orthography and literature==

A Latin-based orthography was adopted in 2008. Previously, the New Testament had been published in the Bench language using an orthography based on the Ethiopian syllabary. Tones were not indicated. Retroflex consonants were indicated by such techniques as using extra symbols from the syllabary (the &quot;&quot;nigus&quot; s&quot;) and forming new symbols (the addition of an extra arm on the left side for &quot;t&quot;).

<doc id="898990" wikidata="Q1195789" url="?curid=898990" title="The Rebel (book)">
<text>The Rebel () is a 1951 book-length essay by Albert Camus, which treats both the metaphysical and the historical development of rebellion and revolution in societies, especially Western Europe.

Examining both rebellion and revolt, which may be seen as the same phenomenon in personal and social frames, Camus examines several &#x27;countercultural&#x27; figures and movements from the history of Western thought and art, noting the importance of each in the overall development of revolutionary thought and philosophy. He analyses the decreasing social importance of king, god and virtue and the development of nihilism. It can be seen as a sequel to &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, where he ponders the meaning of life, because it answers the same question, but offers an alternative solution.

==Themes==
One of Camus&#x27; primary arguments in &quot;The Rebel&quot; concerns the motivation for rebellion and revolution. While the two acts—which can be interpreted from Camus&#x27; writing as states of being—are radically different in most respects, they both stem from a basic human rejection of normative justice. If human beings become disenchanted with contemporary applications of justice, Camus suggests that they rebel. This rebellion, then, is the product of a basic contradiction between the human mind&#x27;s unceasing quest for clarification and the apparently meaningless nature of the world. Described by Camus as &quot;absurd,&quot; this latter perception must be examined with what Camus terms &quot;lucidity.&quot; Camus concludes that such an &#x27;absurdist&#x27; sensibility contradicts itself because when it claims to believe in nothing, it believes in its own protest and in the value of the protester&#x27;s life. Therefore, this sensibility is logically a &quot;point of departure&quot; that irresistibly &quot;exceeds itself.&quot; In the inborn impulse to rebel, on the other hand, we can deduce values that enable us to determine that murder and oppression are illegitimate and conclude with &quot;hope for a new creation.&quot; 

Another prominent theme in &quot;The Rebel&quot;, which is tied to the notion of incipient rebellion, is the inevitable failure of attempts at human perfection. Through an examination of various titular revolutions, and in particular the French Revolution, Camus argues that most revolutions involved a fundamental denial of both history and transcendental values. Such revolutionaries aimed to kill God. In the French Revolution, for instance, this was achieved through the execution of Louis XVI and subsequent eradication of the divine right of kings. The subsequent rise of materialist idealism sought &quot;the end of history.&quot; Because this end is unattainable, according to Camus, terror ensued as the revolutionaries attempted to coerce results. This culminated in the &quot;temporary&quot; enslaving of people in the name of their future liberation. Notably, Camus&#x27; reliance on non-secular sentiment does not involve a defense of religion; indeed, the replacement of divinely-justified morality with pragmatism simply represents Camus&#x27; apotheosis of transcendental, moral values.

Faced with the manifest injustices of human existence on one hand, and the poor substitute of revolution on the other, Camus&#x27; rebel seeks to fight for justice without abandoning transcendental values, including the principle of the intrinsic value of human life. Consequently, of all the modern revolutionaries, Camus describes how the &quot;fastidious assassins&quot;, namely the Russian terrorists led by Ivan Kalyayev, active in the early twentieth century were prepared to offer their own lives as payment for the lives they took, rather than licensing others to kill others.

A third is that of crime, as Camus discusses how rebels who get carried away lose touch with the original basis of their rebellion and offer various defenses of crime through various historical epochs.

At the end of the book, Camus espouses the possible moral superiority of the ethics and political plan of syndicalism. He grounds this politics in a wider &quot;midday thought&quot; which opposes love of this life, and an unrelativisable normative commitment to fellow human beings, against ideological promises of the other world, end of history, or triumph of an alleged master race.

The Encyclopædia Britannica Online summarised Camus views on rebellion:
::[...] &quot;The true rebel is not the person who conforms to the orthodoxy of some revolutionary ideology but a person who could say “no” to injustice. He suggested that the true rebel would prefer the politics of reform, such as that of modern trade-union socialism, to the totalitarian politics of Marxism or similar movements. The systematic violence of ideology—the crimes de logique that were committed in its name—appeared to Camus to be wholly unjustifiable. Hating cruelty, he believed that the rise of ideology in the modern world had added enormously to human suffering. Though he was willing to admit that the ultimate aim of most ideologies was to diminish human suffering, he argued that good ends did not authorize the use of evil means.&quot;
The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy explains that &quot;the notion of Revolt refers to both a path of resolved action and a state of mind. It can take extreme forms such as terrorism or a reckless and unrestrained egoism (both of which are rejected by Camus), but basically, and in simple terms, it consists of an attitude of heroic defiance or resistance to whatever oppresses human beings.&quot;

== Reception ==
This work has received ongoing interest, influencing modern philosophers and authors such as Paul Berman. It was disliked by Marxists and existentialists, such as Jean-Paul Sartre, who wrote a critical response to it in the review &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot; in 1952. Many European Communists considered his thoughts to be reactionary.

Henri Peyre, writing for the Encyclopædia Britannica Online, considers the text to &quot;consist of grave, but inconsistent and often unconvincing, essays loosely linked together.&quot; Aidan Curzon-Hobson considers it to be an important educational resource. He also considers it to be Camus&#x27;s &quot;most underexplored&quot; text.
According to David Simpson, writing for the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, it is &quot;a reflection on the nature of freedom and rebellion and a philosophical critique of revolutionary violence.&quot; It explicitly condemns Marxism-Leninism, emphatically denouncing unrestrained violence as a means of human liberation. With this book, Camus became an &quot;outspoken champion of individual freedom and [...] an impassioned critic of tyranny and terrorism, whether practiced by the Left or by the Right.&quot;

According to Meghan E. Von Hassel, Camus presented a new humanism in this book. He found &quot;hope in the beauty of solidarity which is rooted in the dignity of man, namely, that there is value in human life.&quot;

&quot;Philosophically, The Rebel is Camus&#x27;s most important book&quot;, according to John Foley, &quot;although it is much maligned and frequently ignored&quot;.

Fred Rosen has examined the influence of ideas of Simone Weil on Camus&#x27; thinking in &quot;The Rebel&quot;. According to him, Camus adopted her criticism of Marxism and her conception of the rebel as an artisan. George F Selfer has analysed parallels between Camus and Friedrich Nietzsche in philosophical aesthetics and found significant similarities and profound differences.

<doc id="898992" wikidata="Q1144039" url="?curid=898992" title="Inguinal hernia">
<text>An inguinal hernia or groin hernia is a hernia (protrusion) of abdominal cavity contents through the inguinal canal. Symptoms, which may include pain or discomfort especially with or following coughing, exercise, or bowel movements, are absent in about a third of patients. Symptoms often get worse throughout the day and improve when lying down. A bulging area may occur that becomes larger when bearing down. Inguinal hernias occur more often on the right than the left side. The main concern is strangulation, where the blood supply to part of the intestine is blocked. This usually produces severe pain and tenderness of the area.
Risk factors for the development of a hernia include: smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, pregnancy, peritoneal dialysis, collagen vascular disease, and previous open appendectomy, among others. Predisposition to hernias is genetic and they occur more often in certain families. Deleterious mutations causing predisposition to hernias seem to have dominant inheritance (especially for men). It is unclear if inguinal hernias are associated with heavy lifting. Hernias can often be diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. Occasionally medical imaging is used to confirm the diagnosis or rule out other possible causes.
Groin hernias that do not cause symptoms in males do not need to be repaired. Repair, however, is generally recommended in females due to the higher rate of femoral hernias (also a type of groin hernia) which have more complications. If strangulation occurs immediate surgery is required. Repair may be done by open surgery or by laparoscopic surgery. Open surgery has the benefit of possibly being done under local anesthesia rather than general anesthesia. Laparoscopic surgery generally has less pain following the procedure.
In 2015 inguinal, femoral and abdominal hernias affected about 18.5 million people. About 27% of males and 3% of females develop a groin hernia at some time in their life. Groin hernias occur most often before the age of one and after the age of fifty. Globally, inguinal, femoral and abdominal hernias resulted in 60,000 deaths in 2015 and 55,000 in 1990.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Hernias usually present as bulges in the groin area that can become more prominent when coughing, straining, or standing up. The bulge commonly disappears on lying down. Mild discomfort can develop over time. The inability to &quot;reduce&quot;, or place the bulge back into the abdomen usually means the hernia is &#x27;incarcerated&#x27; which requires emergency surgery.

As the hernia progresses, contents of the abdominal cavity, such as the intestines, can descend into the hernia and run the risk of being pinched within the hernia, causing an intestinal obstruction. Significant pain at the hernia site is suggestive of a more severe course, such as incarceration (the hernia cannot be reduced back into the abdomen) and subsequent ischemia and strangulation (when the hernia becomes deprived of blood supply). If the blood supply of the portion of the intestine caught in the hernia is compromised, the hernia is deemed &quot;strangulated&quot; and gut ischemia and gangrene can result, with potentially fatal consequences. The timing of complications is not predictable.

==Pathophysiology==
In males, indirect hernias follow the same route as the descending testes, which migrate from the abdomen into the scrotum during the development of the urinary and reproductive organs. The larger size of their inguinal canal, which transmitted the testicle and accommodates the structures of the spermatic cord, might be one reason why men are 25 times more likely to have an inguinal hernia than women. Although several mechanisms such as strength of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal and shutter mechanisms compensating for raised intra-abdominal pressure prevent hernia formation in normal individuals, the exact importance of each factor is still under debate. The physiological school of thought thinks that the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who develop a hernia and those who do not, namely the presence of aponeurotic extensions from the transversus abdominis aponeurotic arch.

Inguinal hernias mostly contain the omentum or a part of the small intestines, however, some unusual contents may be an appendicitis, diverticulitis, colon cancer, urinary bladder, ovaries, and rarely malignant lesions. 
== Diagnosis ==

There are two types of inguinal hernia, &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot;, which are defined by their relationship to the inferior epigastric vessels. Direct inguinal hernias occur medial to the inferior epigastric vessels when abdominal contents herniate through a weak spot in the fascia of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, which is formed by the transversalis fascia. Indirect inguinal hernias occur when abdominal contents protrude through the deep inguinal ring, lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels; this may be caused by failure of embryonic closure of the processus vaginalis.

In the case of the female, the opening of the superficial inguinal ring is smaller than that of the male. As a result, the possibility for hernias through the inguinal canal in males is much greater because they have a larger opening and therefore a much weaker wall through which the intestines may protrude.
Inguinal hernias, in turn, belong to groin hernias, which also includes femoral hernias. A femoral hernia is not via the inguinal canal, but via the femoral canal, which normally allows passage of the common femoral artery and vein from the pelvis to the leg.

In Amyand&#x27;s hernia, the content of the hernial sac is the appendix.

In Littre&#x27;s hernia, the content of the hernial sac contains a Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum.

Clinical classification of hernia is also important according to which hernia is classified into
# Reducible hernia: is one which can be pushed back into the abdomen by putting manual pressure to it.
# Irreducible/Incarcerated hernia: is one which cannot be pushed back into the abdomen by applying manual pressure.

Irreducible hernias are further classified into
# Obstructed hernia: is one in which the lumen of the herniated part of intestine is obstructed.
# Strangulated hernia: is one in which the blood supply of the hernia contents is cut off, thus, leading to ischemia. The lumen of the intestine may be patent or not.

===Direct inguinal hernia===
The direct inguinal hernia enters through a weak point in the fascia of the abdominal wall, and its sac is noted to be medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. Direct inguinal hernias may occur in males or females, but males are ten times more likely to get a direct inguinal hernia.

A direct inguinal hernia protrudes through a weakened area in the transversalis fascia near the medial inguinal fossa within an anatomic region known as the inguinal or Hesselbach&#x27;s triangle, an area defined by the edge of the rectus abdominis muscle, the inguinal ligament and the inferior epigastric artery. These hernias are capable of exiting via the superficial inguinal ring and are unable to extend into the scrotum.
When a patient develops a simultaneous direct and indirect hernia on the same side, it is called a pantaloon hernia or saddlebag hernia because it resembles a pair of pants with the epigastric vessels in the crotch, and the defects can be repaired separately or together. Another term for pantaloon hernia is Romberg&#x27;s hernia.

Since the abdominal walls weaken with age, direct hernias tend to occur in the middle-aged and elderly. This is in contrast to indirect hernias which can occur at any age including the young, since their etiology includes a congenital component where the inguinal canal is left more patent (compared to individuals less susceptible to indirect hernias). Additional risk factors include chronic constipation, being overweight or obese, chronic cough, family history and prior episodes of direct inguinal hernias.

===Indirect inguinal hernia===


An indirect inguinal hernia results from the failure of embryonic closure of the deep inguinal ring. In the male it can occur after the testicle has passed through the deep inguinal ring. It is the most common cause of groin hernia. A double indirect inguinal hernia has two sacs.

In the male fetus, the peritoneum gives a coat to the testicle as it passes through this ring, forming a temporary connection called the processus vaginalis. In normal development, the processus is obliterated once the testicle is completely descended. The permanent coat of peritoneum that remains around the testicle is called the tunica vaginalis. The testicle remains connected to its blood vessels and the vas deferens, which make up the spermatic cord and descend through the inguinal canal to the scrotum.

The deep inguinal ring, which is the beginning of the inguinal canal, remains as an opening in the fascia transversalis, which forms the fascial inner wall of the spermatic cord. When the opening is larger than necessary for passage of the spermatic cord, the stage is set for an indirect inguinal hernia. The protrusion of peritoneum through the internal inguinal ring can be considered an incomplete obliteration of the processus.

In an indirect inguinal hernia, the protrusion passes through the deep inguinal ring and is located lateral to the inferior epigastric artery. Hence, the conjoint tendon is not weakened.

There are three main types
*Bubonocele: in this case the hernia is limited in inguinal canal.
*Funicular: here the processus vaginalis is closed at its lower end just above the epididymis. The content of the hernial sac can be felt separately from the testis which lies below the hernia. 
*Complete (or scrotal): here the processus vaginalis is patent throughout. The hernial sac is continuous with the tunica vaginalis of the testis. The hernia descends down to the bottom of the scrotum and it is difficult to differentiate the testis from hernia.

In the female, groin hernias are only 4% as common as in males. &quot;Indirect inguinal hernia&quot; is still the most common groin hernia for females. If a woman has an indirect inguinal hernia, her internal inguinal ring is patent, which is abnormal for females. The protrusion of peritoneum is not called &quot;processus vaginalis&quot; in women, as this structure is related to the migration of the testicle to the scrotum. It is simply a hernia sac. The eventual destination of the hernia contents for a woman is the labium majus on the same side, and hernias can enlarge one labium dramatically if they are allowed to progress. 

===Medical imaging===
A physician may diagnose an inguinal hernia, as well as the type, from medical history and physical examination. For confirmation or in uncertain cases, medical ultrasonography is the first choice of imaging, because it can both detect the hernia and evaluate its changes with for example pressure, standing and Valsalva maneuver.

When assessed by ultrasound or cross sectional imaging with CT or MRI, the major differential in diagnosing indirect inguinal hernias is differentiation from spermatic cord lipomas, as both can contain only fat and extend along the inguinal canal into the scrotum.

On axial CT, lipomas originate inferior or lateral to the cord, and are located inside the cremaster muscle, while inguinal hernias lie anteromedial to the cord and are not intramuscular. Large lipomas may appear nearly indistinguishable as the fat engulfs anatomic boundaries, but they do not change position with coughing or straining.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Differential diagnosis of the symptoms of inguinal hernia mainly includes the following potential conditions:
* Femoral hernia
* Epididymitis
* Testicular torsion
* Lipomas
* Inguinal adenopathy (Lymph node Swelling)
* Groin abscess
* Saphenous vein dilation, called Saphena varix
* Vascular aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm
* Hydrocele
* Varicocele
* Cryptorchidism (Undescended testes)

== Management ==

=== Conservative ===
There is currently no medical recommendation about how to manage an inguinal hernia condition in adults, due to the fact that, until the early 2010s, elective surgery used to be recommended. The hernia truss (or hernia belt) is intended to contain a reducible inguinal hernia within the abdomen. It is not considered to provide a cure, and if the pads are hard and intrude into the hernia aperture they may cause scarring and enlargement of the aperture. In addition, most trusses with older designs are not able effectively to contain the hernia at all times, because their pads do not remain permanently in contact with the hernia. The more modern variety of truss is made with non-intrusive flat pads and comes with a guarantee to hold the hernia securely during all activities. They have been described by users as providing greater confidence and comfort when carrying out physically demanding tasks. However, their use is controversial, as data to determine whether they help prevent hernia complications are lacking. A truss also increases the probability of complications, which include strangulation of the hernia, atrophy of the spermatic cord, and atrophy of the fascial margins. This allows the defect to enlarge and makes subsequent repair more difficult. Their popularity is nonetheless likely to increase, as many individuals with small, painless hernias are now delaying hernia surgery due to the risk of post-herniorrhaphy pain syndrome. Elasticated pants used by athletes may also provide useful support for the smaller hernia.

=== Surgical ===

Surgical correction of inguinal hernias is called a hernia repair. It is not recommended in minimally symptomatic hernias, for which watchful waiting is advised, due to the risk of post herniorraphy pain syndrome. Surgery is commonly performed as outpatient surgery. There are various surgical strategies which may be considered in the planning of inguinal hernia repair. These include the consideration of mesh use (e.g. synthetic or biologic), open repair, use of laparoscopy, type of anesthesia (general or local), appropriateness of bilateral repair, etc. Mesh or non mesh repairs have both benefits in different areas, but mesh repairs may reduce the rate of hernia reappearance, visceral or neurovascular injuries, length of hospital stay and time to return to activities of daily living. Laparoscopy is most commonly used for non-emergency cases; however, a minimally invasive open repair may have a lower incidence of post-operative nausea and mesh associated pain. During surgery conducted under local anaesthesia, the patient will be asked to cough and strain during the procedure to help in demonstrating that the repair is without tension and sound.

Constipation after hernia repair results in strain to evacuate the bowel causing pain, and fear that the sutures may rupture. Opioid analgesia makes constipation worse. Promoting an easy bowel motion is important post-operatively.

Surgical correction is always recommended for inguinal hernias in children.

Emergency surgery for incarceration and strangulation carry much higher risk than planned, &quot;elective&quot; procedures. However, the risk of incarceration is low, evaluated at 0.2% per year. On the other hand, surgery has a risk of inguinodynia (10-12%), and this is why males with minimal symptoms are advised to watchful waiting. However, if they experience discomfort while doing physical activities or they routinely avoid them for fear of pain, they should seek surgical evaluation. For female patients, surgery is recommended even for asymptomatic patients.

== Epidemiology ==
A direct inguinal hernia is less common (~25–30% of inguinal hernias) and usually occurs in men over 40 years of age.

Men have an 8 times higher incidence of inguinal hernia than women.

<text>Unified messaging (or UM) is a business term for the integration of different electronic messaging and communications media (e-mail, SMS, fax, voicemail, video messaging, etc.) technologies into a single interface, accessible from a variety of different devices. 
While traditional communications systems delivered messages into several different types of stores such as voicemail systems, e-mail servers, and stand-alone fax machines, with Unified Messaging all types of messages are stored in one system. Voicemail messages, for example, can be delivered directly into the user&#x27;s inbox and played either through a headset or the computer&#x27;s speaker. This simplifies the user&#x27;s experience (only one place to check for messages) and can offer new options for workflow such as appending notes or documents to forwarded voicemails.

Unified messaging is increasingly accepted in the corporate environment, where it&#x27;s generally seen as an improvement to business productivity. Unified messaging for professional settings integrates communications processes into the existing IT infrastructure, i. e. into CRM, ERP and mail systems.

== Hype ==
Definitions of unified messaging vary from the typical definition of simple inclusion of incoming faxes and voice-mail in one&#x27;s email inbox, all the way to dictating a message into a cell phone and the intelligent delivery of that message to the intended recipient in a variety of possible formats like text email, fax, or voice recording. Because of the nebulous definition of UM, it was number one on the 1998 Wired Magazine &quot;Hype List&quot;.

== Difference from unified communications ==
Unified messaging is not to be mistaken for unified communications (UC), although the two share some similarities. UM is a component of UC which involves the integration of various communication channels, such as email, voicemail, and fax, into a single platform. This streamlines the management of messages, providing users with a centralized interface for handling diverse communication types.

In contrast, UC encompasses a broader spectrum of services, extending beyond messaging to include real-time communication tools, collaboration platforms, and other integrated applications. However, it&#x27;s essential to note that not all unified communication services incorporate unified messaging. The distinction arises from the specific needs and preferences of hosted SMB customers. So while unified messaging can be included in unified communications, not all unified communication services are related to unified messaging.

<doc id="899001" wikidata="Q462487" url="?curid=899001" title="Clyde Walcott">
<text>Sir Clyde Leopold Walcott KA, GCM, OBE (17 January 1926 – 26 August 2006) was a West Indian cricketer. Walcott was a member of the &quot;three W&#x27;s&quot;, the other two being Everton Weekes and Frank Worrell: all were very successful batsmen from Barbados, born within a short distance of each other in Bridgetown, Barbados in a period of 18 months from August 1924 to January 1926; all made their Test cricket debut against England in 1948. 
In the mid-1950s, Walcott was arguably the best batsman in the world. He was the manager of the West Indian squads which won the 1975 Cricket World Cup and the 1979 Cricket World Cup. In later life, he had an active career as a cricket administrator, and was the first non-English and non-white chairman of the International Cricket Council.

==Early and private life==

Walcott was born in New Orleans (Bridgetown), St. Michael, Barbados. His father was a printing engineer with the &quot;Barbados Advocate&quot; newspaper. He was educated at Combermere School and, from the age of 14, at Harrison College in Barbados. He took up wicket-keeping at Harrison College and also learned to bowl inswingers.

He married Muriel Ashby in 1951. They had two sons together. His brother, Keith Walcott, and a son, Michael Walcott, both played first-class cricket for Barbados.

==Cricketing career==

Walcott first played first-class cricket for Barbados in 1942, as a 16-year-old schoolboy. He made his first impression in February 1946, when, on a matting wicket, he scored 314 not out for Barbados against Trinidad as part of an unbroken stand of 574 for the fourth wicket with schoolfriend Frank Worrell (255 not out), setting a world record for any partnership in first-class cricket that remains a record in the West Indies.

He played his first Test in January 1948, the drawn 1st Test against England at Bridgetown. Powerfully built, weighing 15 stone and 6&quot;2&#x27; tall, he was an accomplished strokeplayer. From a crouched stance, he was particularly strong off the back foot, and quick to cut, drive or pull. Despite his height, Walcott also kept wicket for his country in his first 15 Tests, his versatility enabling to retain his position in the side despite some poor batting performances in his first few matches. By the time a back injury forced him to relinquish the gloves, his batting had improved sufficiently to enable him to keep his place. He became a good slip fielder, and was an occasional fast-medium bowler.

In 1950, his unbeaten 168 in the second innings of the 2nd Test at Lord&#x27;s helped the team to its first Test victory, and ultimately first series win in England, assisted by the spin bowling of Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine. He scored a century in both innings of two Tests in the series against Australia in 1955, when he became the first batsman to score five centuries in a single Test series, totalling 827 runs from 10 innings. He was dismissed for a duck only once in Tests, lbw to Ray Lindwall in the 1st Test against Australia at Brisbane in 1951.

He played for Enfield in the Lancashire League from 1951 to 1954, and moved to Georgetown in Guyana (then British Guiana) in 1954, to work for the British Guiana Sugar Producers&#x27; Association. He also played first-class cricket for British Guiana, and by 1956 he was captaining the side. In retirement, he returned to Barbados in 1970.

He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1958.

==Cricket and Social Welfare Organiser==

Between 1954 and 1970, and largely in parallel with his cricketing career, Walcott had an influential role with the Sugar Producers&#x27; Association in Guyana as a cricket and social welfare organiser on the country&#x27;s vast sugar estates. In those roles he engineered huge strides in the development of cricket among poor, mainly Indo-Guyanese plantation workers, widening access to the game, upgrading facilities, organising clubs and competitions and improving coaching techniques.

This led directly to the emergence of a number of world-class Indo-Guyanese cricketers – including Rohan Kanhai and Joe Solomon – from an area of the Caribbean that had hitherto been unknown and overlooked as a source of talent.

Walcott&#x27;s biographer, Peter Mason, argues in &quot;Clyde Walcott: Statesman of West Indies Cricket&quot; that his work in British Guiana &quot;revitalised the colony’s fortunes in the regional game, while helping to develop an array of brilliant new Guyanese players who became the backbone of West Indies success for years to come&quot;.

Simultaneously, says Mason, &quot;he stimulated new self-worth and a more tangible Caribbean identity among the Indian population of the sugar estates on which he worked&quot;, while also doing much to enhance living and working conditions as part of the Sugar Producers&#x27; Association’s long-running programme of improvements.

==Retirement==

Walcott retired from playing Test cricket in 1960. His early retirement from international cricket was attributed by many to his dissatisfaction with West Indian cricket politics relating to the captaincy, but he himself attributed it to disputes over pay. He retired from first-class cricket in 1964. He was awarded the OBE in 1966 for services to cricket in Barbados, Guyana and the West Indies.

In retirement, he had an active career as a cricket administrator. He managed and coached various cricket teams, and was later a cricket commentator in Barbados. He was President of the Guyana Cricket Board of Control from 1968 to 1970, and then a vice-president of the Barbados Cricket Association. He was chairman of the West Indies selectors from 1973 to 1988, and managed the West Indies teams that won the Cricket World Cup in 1975 and 1979, and also in 1987. He was president of the West Indies Cricket Board from 1988 to 1993. He was awarded the Barbados Gold Crown of Merit in 1991, and became a Knight of St Andrew in the Order of Barbados in 1993.

He ended his career at the ICC. He was an International Cricket Council match referee in three matches in 1992, and became chairman of the International Cricket Council from 1993, the first non-English person and the first black man to hold the position. He was knighted for services to cricket in 1994. Both of the other two &quot;Ws&quot; were also knighted, Weekes in 1995 and Worrell in 1964, only three years before his early death. He became the ICC Cricket Chairman in 1997, in charge of the ICC Code of Conduct, and oversaw investigations into allegations of match fixing. He retired in 2000.

When Arsenal footballer Theo Walcott was first selected for the England football team in 2006, there were rumors that Sir Clyde was his great uncle. In an article in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, Sir Clyde said &quot;he&#x27;s definitely not a relative&quot;.

He published two autobiographies, &quot;Island Cricketers&quot; in 1958 and &quot;Sixty Years on the Back Foot&quot; in 1999. After Walcott&#x27;s death, Michael Holding, the former West Indian fast bowler who made his debut when Walcott was manager, said: &quot;Another good man gone – he is not only a West Indies legend but a legend of the world.&quot;

==Legacy==

Peter Mason has described Walcott as &quot;one of the dominant personalities of international cricket across five decades&quot; and suggests that &quot;no other single individual, both as a player and an administrator, has done more to help West Indies cricket&quot;, while &quot;few have made a bigger impact on cricket in general&quot;.

<doc id="899002" wikidata="Q16842313" url="?curid=899002" title="Hello Sailor (band)">
<text>Hello Sailor was a New Zealand pop/rock band originally formed in 1975. Although the band formally disbanded in 1980 after just two albums, they have continued to sporadically reunite during the years since; recording a further four albums and performing numerous live tours and appearances.

== History ==
The band&#x27;s guitarist/vocalists Dave McArtney and Harry Lyon first played together in the mid 1960s.

Their first gig as Hello Sailor was at the Trees Tavern in Tokoroa.

After several lineup changes, the band released its first album, &quot;Hello Sailor&quot;, in 1977, which went on to become the first New Zealand made record to be certified gold. 
The line-up at that time was Graham Brazier on vocals and some guitar and saxophone, McArtney and Lyon on guitars and vocals, Lisle Kinney on bass, and Ricky Ball on drums.

Their second album, &quot;Pacifica Amour&quot;, was released in 1978, after the band had made their first visit to America to try to crack the American market. In 1979 the band left for Australia, but this trip was also not a success. Hello Sailor formally disbanded in 1980. 

In 1982, a compilation EP was released, titled &quot;Last Chance to Dance&quot;. It contained five tracks taken from the band&#x27;s two earlier albums, plus an additional track &quot;Here Comes Johnny&quot;.

The classic line-up came together again within Graham Brazier&#x27;s early-1980s band The Legionnaires, and in 1985 decided to reform as Hello Sailor (with former Coup D&#x27;État bass player Neil Hannan replacing Lisle Kinney). The band released a new single &quot;Fugitive For Love&quot;, and a follow-up album &quot;Shipshape &amp; Bristol Fashion&quot;, which included a re-recorded version of the single. In addition to new songs, the album also contained some reworked material which had originally been recorded during their various solo projects since 1980. Following on from the release of the album, the band toured extensively throughout New Zealand during late 1985 and into 1986.

After another hiatus, the band returned in 1994, recording a new album titled &quot;The Album&quot;, and again commenced a nationwide promotional tour. Three singles were released from &quot;The Album&quot;; &quot;New Tattoo&quot;, &quot;Never Fade Away, and &quot;Raging with the Storm&quot;.

In 1996, a two-disc Compilation album &quot;The Sailor Story&quot; was released. In addition to Hello Sailor tracks, the album also contained material which had been recorded by the band&#x27;s members during their various solo projects.

In 2005, Hello Sailor&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;Gutter Black&quot; was chosen as the title music for New Zealand television series &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot;. This not only sparked renewed interest for the band, but also resulted in a favourable renegotiation of the publishing rights for Hello Sailor&#x27;s earlier material.

In 2007, the band released the album, &quot;When Your Lights Are Out&quot;, which featured all-acoustic versions of their best-known material.

In 2011 the band entered the APRA NZ Music Hall of Fame .
In 2012, the band again reunited to record an album of new material &quot;Surrey Crescent Moon&quot;.

Founding member Dave McArtney died in 2013. 

In 2015, the band were planning their 40th-anniversary tour when Brazier suffered a heart attack. The tour was postponed while he recovered, but he died shortly after, marking the end of the band&#x27;s career.At the request of Glenn Smith, the band got back together once again in February 2023 and performed a special memorial concert in their small hometown of Waitara, New Zealand.

<doc id="899007" wikidata="Q3348179" url="?curid=899007" title="Abdur Razzak (cricketer)">
<text>Khan Abdur Razzak (; born 15 June 1982) is a Bangladeshi former cricketer who played in all formats of the game. Abdur Razzak is the first Bangladeshi to take 200 wickets in ODIs. He is also the first left arm spinner and second spinner after Saqlain Mushtaq to take a hat-trick.

He made his first-class debut at Bangladeshi domestic level for Khulna Division in the 2001/02 season. Best known for being a tall left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he helped guide his division to the National Cricket title in his maiden season. From there he was selected for Bangladesh A (training team for the full national squad) performing well against Zimbabwe A, including figures of 7 for 17 in one game in Dhaka.

Though he played just nine Tests, was more successful in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and was Bangladesh&#x27;s leading wicket-taker in the format in 2013, when he reached the 200 wickets milestone.

In January 2018, he became the first Bangladesh player to take 500 wickets in first-class cricket. After an absence of four years, he made a comeback to the Test squad on 8 February 2018 against Sri Lanka, taking 4-63 opening the bowling, but Bangladesh lost the match by 215 runs. In November 2019, he took his 600th first-class wicket, becoming the first Bangladeshi bowler to reach the milestone.

In February 2021, Abdur Razzak announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.

==Domestic career==
===Indian Premier League===
Abdur Razzak was the only Bangladeshi to play in the 2008 Indian Premier League making him the first Bangladeshi to play the league. He was bought for $50,000 by the Royal Challengers Bangalore and played in only one match. Despite not playing often for the team, Abdur Razzak believed that the experience he gained from the tournament was important. He stated that Anil Kumble &quot;was very helpful when I asked him about bowling in Test matches. He told me that given my bowling approach, it is very important to use variations within my line and length. Actually, captains would want a breakthrough from me so without using variations, wickets are hard to come by. Coach Venkatesh Prasad was also a great help&quot;.

===Bangladesh domestic career===
Abdur Razzak responded by taking his best bowling figures in first-class cricket (8/123). His match haul of 15/193 against Barisal Division were the best in the history of the National Cricket League, breaking the record set three years previously by Elias Sunny, the bowler who had replaced Abdur Razzak in the Test team.

In April 2018, he was the leading wicket-taker in the 2017–18 Bangladesh Cricket League, with 43 dismissals in six matches, a record for the tournament. He was also the leading wicket-taker in the 2018–19 Bangladesh Cricket League, with 34 dismissals in six matches.

He was the leading wicket-taker for Prime Bank Cricket Club in the 2018–19 Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League tournament, with 19 dismissals in 16 matches. He was the leading wicket-taker in the 2019–20 National Cricket League, with 31 dismissals in five matches.

==International career==
===Debut years===
Abdur Razzak was called into the Bangladesh national team for the 2004 Asia Cup One Day International tournament, making his debut against Hong Kong in July. He established himself as a regular fixture in the squad although he was not a regular in the starting eleven. He made his Test debut in the second Test of the Australian tour of Bangladesh in April 2006.

After impressing in one-day cricket, he was called up for his Test debut at home to Australia at the Chittagong Divisional Stadium. Bangladesh batted first and he recorded 15 in his first Test match innings. A decent start but he failed to take a wicket in Australia&#x27;s only innings and he registered a golden duck in an innings defeat. His next test appearance took place a year afterwards against Sri Lanka where he got first test wicket having Chamara Silva caught. He got Graeme Smith in a Test against South Africa and he got his highest Test match score of 33 in both innings, once finishing unbeaten. In a Test match against New Zealand, he registered his highest Test match bowling figures of 3–93. This and the next Test in the series (subsequently his last so far) brought his bowling action into question.

===Suspension===
Following New Zealand&#x27;s tour of Bangladesh in October 2008, Abdur Razzak was reported by umpires Daryl Harper and Asoka de Silva for having a &quot;suspect bowling action&quot;. This was the second time in his career that he had been reported for his bowling action. A bowler is deemed to have thrown the ball if his arm bends by more than 15 degrees when delivering the ball. It had been expected that only Abdur Razzak&#x27;s quicker ball was suspect and he would be disallowed from bowling it, however tests showed that Abdur Razzak bends his arm by 22–28 degrees, usually averaging 25 degrees although his quicker ball was delivered at an average of 24 degrees. As a result, Abdur Razzak was suspended from international cricket, although he is allowed to bowl under supervision in domestic cricket, until he remodels his action. In March 2009, the ICC lifted Abdur Razzak&#x27;s suspension after he changed his bowling action; now both his stock delivery and faster ball are legal.

===Return after suspension===
In July 2009, on Bangladesh&#x27;s tour of the West Indies, Abdur Razzak represented Bangladesh in international cricket for the first time since his suspension. Omitted from the Test squad, he was called up for the one-day series. Abdur Razzak&#x27;s performance in the first One Day International, for which he was awarded the man-of-the-match award, helped Bangladesh defeat the West Indies by 52 runs. He opened the bowling and took 4 wickets for 39 runs (4/39) against a West Indies side weakened by disputes between the players and the West Indies Cricket Board. He finished as Bangladesh&#x27;s leading wicket-taker in the three match series, with 7 wickets at 22.85, however he was injured in the final match. The hamstring strain he sustained while batting ruled him out of Bangladesh&#x27;s tour of Zimbabwe in August 2009. By the time Zimbabwe toured Bangladesh for a five-match ODI series in October and November 2009, Abdur Razzak had recovered from his injury and was included in the Bangladesh squad. He took 15 wickets in the series which Bangladesh won 4–1 and was named Man of the Series.

===Late career===
At the start of November 2010, the BCB announced 16 central contracts. Abdur Razzak was one of six players in the top level. He was included in Bangladesh&#x27;s 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup. Zimbabwe returned to Test cricket in August 2011 with a one-off match against Bangladesh. Bangladesh lost the match, their first Test since touring England in June the previous year, with Abdur Razzak taking two wickets for 106 runs. In the subsequent five-match ODI series, Abdur Razzak was the least successful of the bowlers to deliver 20 overs or more taking two wickets in four matches as Bangladesh lost the series 3–2. When the West Indies toured in October he went wicketless in the ODI series and was subsequently dropped from the Test squad, which led him to consider the international retirement in 2014.

On 28 March 2013 he took 5 wickets against Sri Lanka in the 3rd ODI and became the 1st Bangladeshi bowler who took 200 wickets in ODI. On 5 May 2013, at the 2nd ODI between Zimbabwe in Bulawayo, he scored his maiden half-century with 53* runs. At the same time, he achieved &quot;quickest half-century&quot; in cricket history of Bangladesh. But his team was defeated by 6 wickets. He is the first left arm spinner and 2nd spinner after Saqlain Mushtaq took a Hat-trick.

However, his milestone in first-class cricket to become the first Bangladeshi to take 500 wickets, he was added to the Bangladeshi Test squad as a cover for injured Shakib Al Hasan. He made his comeback match against Sri Lanka on 8 February 2018 and took 4 wickets to bowl out Sri Lanka for 222 in their first innings.

==Post retirement==
In March 2020 Razzak was offered a position in the Bangladesh national selection panel however the COVID-19 pandemic delayed his appointment to the role until January 2021. He stated he would make a decision on whether to continue playing domestic cricket after his appointment was announced. On 13 February 2021, Abdur Razzak along with Shahriar Nafees announced their retirement from all forms of cricket.

<doc id="899009" wikidata="Q3202740" url="?curid=899009" title="Abdul Razzaq (cricketer)">
<text>Abdul Razzaq (Punjabi, ; born 2 December 1979) is a Pakistani cricket coach and former cricketer, who played all formats of the game. Known as a gifted all-rounder, he was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and a right-handed batsman. He emerged in international cricket in 1996 with his One Day International debut against Zimbabwe at his home ground in Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore; just one month before his seventeenth birthday. He was part of the Pakistan Cricket squad that won the ICC World Twenty20 2009. He was a part of the Pakistan squad which finished as runners-up at the 1999 Cricket World Cup. He played 265 ODIs and 46 Tests.

At the age of 38, Abdul Razzaq announced that he would make a comeback at the domestic circuit level to play first-class cricket again after having short stints as a coach for few domestic teams in Pakistan since his international retirement in 2013.

==Early and personal life==
Abdul Razzaq was born in Shahdara Bagh, a suburb on the outskirts of Lahore, Punjab, known for its Mughal architecture.

His son Ali Razzaq is also a cricketer.

==International career==
===Early career===
Abdul Razzaq made his One Day International debut in November 1996, against Zimbabwe, but had to wait just over three years to make his Test cricket debut for Pakistan, eventually doing so against Australia in Brisbane in November 1999. In the 1999–2000 Carlton and United Series, he rose to fame and was named man of the series for his all round performance. During a match in Hobart against India, Abdul Razzaq scored a half century and took five wickets. In the same tournament, he hit former Australian fast bowler, Glenn McGrath for 5 fours, which totalled to 20 runs in one over.
Abdul Razzaq also performed well with the ball, his most noticeable stint was in the Coca-Cola Champions Trophy 1999 against Sri Lanka in Sharjah, October 1999. Pakistan were bowled out for 196, with Abdul Razzaq remaining not out on 7. However, Abdul Razzaq proved to be more than capable with his all round skills as he took his first five-wicket haul, dismissing Romesh Kaluwitharana, Mahela Jayawardene, Suresh Perera, Chaminda Vaas and Chamara Silva to finish with match figures of 5/31, meaning that Sri Lanka were also bowled out for 196 resulting in a tied match, having once been at 157/2. Former captain Wasim Akram praised Abdul Razzaq&#x27;s ability with the ball, citing that he was emerging to be one of the best all rounders in the world. Abdul Razzaq&#x27;s astonishing nine-ball spell, which he took four for nought helped snatch a tie from what seemed a certain Sri Lankan victory, finishing as the man of the match for his performance.

===1999 Cricket World Cup===
Abdul Razzaq became a regular member of his national side during the 1999 world cup held in England. During the event, he got the attention of selectors as he performed well both with the ball and bat. His brilliant performance with the bat came in the group match against Australia, where he went on to score his first half century making 60 runs in a long and stable partnership with Inzamam-ul-Haq, which helped Pakistan reach a defendable target of 275. Pakistan went on to win the match by ten runs and as a result qualified for the Super Six stage. With the ball, he made a brilliant performance against the tough West Indies national cricket team by taking three wickets for 32 runs having three maiden overs, which proved decisive for Pakistan at Bristol.

===2000 Carlton and United Series===
Abdul Razzaq&#x27;s other impressive performances came during the Carlton &amp; United Series at Australia in a tri-nation tournament involving Pakistan, Australia and India in 2000. Abdul Razzaq achieved the man of the series award for his best all round performances, especially in a pre-finals match against India, where he scored 70 not out with the bat and took 5 wickets for 48 runs, thus becoming the fifth all-rounder to have scored a half century and take five wickets in an ODI; the other four players being Vivian Richards, Kris Srikkanth, Mark Waugh, and Lance Klusener. Shahid Afridi subsequently achieved the feat thrice for Pakistan.

In the first match of the series against Australia, he took 4 wickets and played an important role for Pakistan helping them to successfully defend a very low target of 184 runs at Brisbane. In the third match of the series, Abdul Razzaq came into prominence after hitting five consecutive boundaries in the fifth over of Australian pacer Glenn McGrath. Eventually Pakistan was defeated in the finals by Australia but Abdul Razzaq was named player of the series for his all-round performance.

===Prominence===
In 2000, Abdul Razzaq became the youngest cricketer in the world to take a Test cricket hat-trick in a match against Sri Lanka. He has scored three centuries and twenty two fifties in One Day International matches. His highest score was 112 runs, against South Africa in 2002, where he shared a partnership of 257 runs with Pakistani batsman Saleem Elahi. His second century was scoring 107 runs not out in a match against Zimbabwe in 2004. During this match, he saved Pakistan from a disastrous start and eventually won them the match. His first fifty came in 90 deliveries, before accelerating in the second fifty runs, which was scored in just 21 balls. Also in 2003–2004, he scored 89 runs from 40 balls against New Zealand, whose captain Stephen Fleming called him the &quot;best hitter&quot; in the world. In January 2005, he was involved in the ACC Asian XI that took on the ICC World XI in the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal charity match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia.

As a fast bowler, Abdul Razzaq experienced a steady decline in speed and performance during the 2003 cricket World Cup and 2004. Abdul Razzaq dropped Tendulkar who later on scored a match-winning 98 (75). During this period, he remained as a supporting bowler. However, from 2005 to the end of 2006, he regained his speed and he won many matches for Pakistan with his bowling. His best bowling figures in a One Day International match is 6 wickets for 35 runs. His another notable performance was against Sri Lanka at Sharjah in 1999, where Pakistan was all out for 196 runs and he took 5 wickets for 31 runs to draw the match. During the 2005–2006 Test match series against India, Abdul Razzaq took 9 wickets and scored 205 runs in two Test matches he played, which resulted in an improvement of his performance. His batting remained generally consistent from 2000 to 2006, although his place on the Test team was never secure.

Abdul Razzaq&#x27;s place in the Pakistan national team has been marred by injuries and absences. In 2005 it was revealed that he was suffering from eating too much spinach, which was causing him to suffer from nausea and sickness while playing. This led to him being known as &#x27;Popeye&#x27; by his teammates. In 2007, a poor performance in a series with both the bat and ball, in a match against South Africa, accompanied with an injury that forced him out of the 2007 cricket World Cup, had him dropped from the 2007 World Twenty20, a decision that received widespread criticism from cricket individuals.

===Temporary retirement in 2007===
On 20 August 2007, Abdul Razzaq announced his retirement against his omission from the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 squad. However, on 27 October 2007, Abdul Razzaq revoked his decision following discussions with his local cricket club and coach, saying, &quot;Maybe I made that (decision to retire) in the heat of the moment.&quot;

 He signed up for the Indian Cricket League and played for the Hyderabad Heroes as one of their star players. He eventually severed ties with the league in September 2008 and returned to international cricket in June 2009, helping Pakistan win the 2009 ICC T20 World Cup.

===Return in team: 2009 World Twenty20 Championship===
In 2009, he was selected into Pakistan&#x27;s squad for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England as a replacement for injured fast bowler Yasir Arafat, marking his return to International cricket and becoming the first Indian Cricket League player, whose ban was lifted by the Pakistan Cricket Board. He played an important role in Pakistan&#x27;s victory in the tournament, taking 5 wickets at an average of 14.80 and an economy rate of 5.92. His figures of 3 wickets for 20 runs, played a significant role in Pakistan&#x27;s victory against Sri Lanka in the final. As a result, he along with another former Indian Cricket League player Mohammad Yousuf were awarded &#x27;A&#x27; category mid-term central contracts by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

In the 2009–2010 season, Abdul Razzaq missed out on the tours of New Zealand and Australia, due to injury. However he was selected in the two match Twenty20 International series against England in February 2010. His innings of 46 runs not out from 18 deliveries in the second match of the series, cemented Pakistan a victory, their first in eleven international outings.

On 30 December when playing in a game for the Melbourne Renegades, former Australian cricketer Mark Waugh described Abdul Razzaq as a &quot;cardboard cut out&quot; based on his appeared disinterest when playing.

===ODI return: against New Zealand===
Upon his ODI return, he played a fine little cameo for Pakistan with the bat scoring 23 runs of 20 deliveries and pushed the score to 287. New Zealand needed 288 to win and Abdul Razzaq took the key wickets of Scott Styris and Jacob Oram to ensure that Pakistan thrash New Zealand by 141 runs. In the second ODI, he took the wickets of Martin Guptill (62) and Daniel Vettori on (30). Despite this, New Zealand ended the innings at 303/8. Pakistan collapsed to 239 all out, with Abdul Razzaq scoring 35 runs. With the series levelled 1–1 Pakistan went into the third ODI and bowled New Zealand out for 211. Despite this Pakistan suffered a top order collapse at 79/7 with Younis Khan, Salman Butt, Khalid Latif, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal, Umar Akmal and Shahid Afridi falling cheaply. Then Abdul Razzaq came in and registered a duck as he was run out by Vettori. Gul fell cheaply as well but Pakistan still got agonizingly close to victory, when Mohammad Amir and Saeed Ajmal were engaged in a 103 run partnership before Ajmal top edged a pull on the first ball of the last over as Pakistan were seven runs short of victory.

===Hand injury: No participation against Australia===
Abdul Razzaq picked up a hand injury just before the first ODI against Australia and missed the whole five match series and the only Twenty20 match. He was hit on the hand while batting during the practice sessions The series turned out to be a forgettable one of Pakistan as Mohammad Yousuf and Younis Khan received life bans (overturned 2 months later) for inflicting fighting in the team. Also Rana Naved-ul-Hasan was given a one-year ban along with Shoaib Malik being banned for a year all were overturned on appeal. Amid the fighting Pakistan lost the five match series 5–0 and the only Twenty20 match as well.

===Top all-round form (2010)===
With players like Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf and Shoaib Malik suffering from selection issues, it was Abdul Razzaq who took up the role of a senior player in the Pakistan cricket team. He was selected in the squad for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 and performed admirably with the bat scoring five sixes during the tournament. Pakistan crashed out of the tournament after losing to Australia in the semi-final. Abdul Razzaq then took part in the 2010 Asia Cup.

In July 2010, Abdul Razzaq played in the two T20Is against Australia as Pakistan won both matches comfortably. He wasn&#x27;t selected for the Test series against Australia and England and next played in the September 2010 Twenty20 and ODI series against England. The Pakistan team had been surrounded by Spot-fixing allegations as the team lost both Twenty20 matches due to low morale. Abdul Razzaq missed the first two ODI&#x27;s against England because of a back-strain as Pakistan lost both matches. He returned to the third ODI and scored 31 runs in a fruitful partnership with Shahid Afridi before Afridi was run out and Abdul Razzaq was subsequently caught in the deep square leg as Pakistan were bowled out for 241. England opened the innings strongly before Umar Gul removed six batsmen and Abdul Razzaq took two wickets to seal a 23-run victory for Pakistan.

Abdul Razzaq&#x27;s lower order destruction also became helpful for his domestic team the Lahore Lions as he scored 138 runs from his four innings including a superb 73* in the final to help guide his team to victory in the 2010–11 Faysal Bank Twenty-20 Cup.

On 31 October 2010, in the second One Day International against South Africa, Abdul Razzaq played a match-winning innings of 109* off 72 balls at a strike rate of 151.38, his third One Day International century. The innings which contained seven fours and ten sixes saw Pakistan to a one-wicket win with one ball remaining and level the 5-match series 1–1.

===Series against New Zealand, World Cup Preparation (2011)===
Abdul Razzaq struggled with the bat in the first two Twenty20&#x27;s against New Zealand but he did perform admirably with the ball taking out Jesse Ryder for a golden duck in the second Twenty20. During the third match Abdul Razzaq blasted 34 off just 11 balls in an innings that included 3 fours and 3 sixes. This innings helped Pakistan push their total onto 184. Abdul Razzaq then did the damage with the ball taking the leading run scorer of the series Martin Guptill out for a duck and then took two more top order wickets of Ross Taylor (Leg-before) and clean bowled James Franklin. For this superb all round perform coupled with a 103 run victory for Pakistan, Abdul Razzaq won the award for the player of the match. However two early losses in the series meant New Zealand won the series 2–1.

===2011 Cricket World Cup===
Abdul Razzaq was included in Pakistan&#x27;s 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup hosted by Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka between February and April. His role was to open the bowling and bat down the order. In his first two matches, he had faced just 10 balls, however he scored 20 not out from 24 balls against Australia to guide Pakistan to victory, ending Australia&#x27;s string of 34 matches in World Cups without defeat.

==Domestic career==
===Indian Cricket League===
In 2007–2008, he played in the Indian Cricket League, playing for Hyderabad Heroes. His excellent performance in the last over during the Indian Cricket League final, allowed his team to take a 1–0 lead in the best of three finals. The finals were eventually won by Hyderabad Heroes, 2–0. During this time, his international career remained in doubt, as the Pakistan Cricket Board had banned players who participated in the unofficial league.

After playing for two seasons, he departed from the Indian Cricket League to be selected and play for the Pakistan national team, saying that he hoped the Pakistan Cricket Board&#x27;s ban on Indian Cricket League players would soon be revoked and that he has a desire to play for Pakistan national team once again, affirming that his retirement was not necessarily a permanent decision.

===England County Cricket===
He has also played at the English county level for Middlesex, Worcestershire and Surrey. He joined Surrey in June 2008 on a short-term contract to play in the Twenty20 Cup. He helped Surrey win against Sussex by scoring 39 runs from 19 balls. Despite his short period at The Oval, Abdul Razzaq became a favourite player amongst Surrey supporters.

In March 2010 Abdul Razzaq signed for Hampshire County Cricket Club as one of their four overseas players for the English domestic Twenty20 competition. He played a starring role in their victory against Somerset on finals day at Hampshire&#x27;s home ground, the Rose Bowl.

Abdul Razzaq signed for Leicestershire County Cricket Club as their second overseas players for the English domestic Friends Life t20. At the 2011 Friends Life t20 he again played for the winning team, this time as a Leicestershire player, against Somerset on the finals day. He also played in both Leicestershire&#x27;s games in the Champions League T20s, but was unable to help Leicestershire through the qualification stage. He has signed for Staffordshire club Hem Heath for the 2014 Season.

==Coaching career==
At domestic level, Abdul Razzaq was appointed head coach to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and under him the team won the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, National T20 Cup and Pakistan Cup in the 2020–21 season, later he became the head coach of Central Punjab for the 2021-22 domestic season.

Abdul Razzaq was appointed as the interim head coach of the Pakistan national team alongside Saqlain Mushtaq on 6 September 2021 by PCB for New Zealand tour of Pakistan 2021, after Misbah-ul-Haq and Waqar Younis stepped down as coaches, but the series later got called off.

In September 2022, he was appointed head coach to the Hyderabad Hunters squad for the inaugural season of the Pakistan Junior League.

<text>Alan James Ball (12 May 1945 – 25 April 2007) was an English professional football player and manager. Often regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time, he won the 1966 World Cup with England and played for various clubs, scoring more than 180 league goals in a career spanning 22 years. After retiring as a player, he had a 15-year career as a manager which included spells in the top flight of English football with Portsmouth, Southampton and Manchester City. He was inducted in the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003.

Ball started his professional career at Blackpool at the age of 17 in 1962, following a brief non–league spell at Ashton United, becoming the club&#x27;s star player and ensuring Blackpool&#x27;s First Division status. He signed for Everton in 1966 for a record fee of £220,000. He became a fan favourite at Goodison Park, winning the First Division in 1970 and the Charity Shield the same year. After five and a half years and over 250 appearances for the club, he signed with Double winners Arsenal in December 1971, becoming a central player in the club&#x27;s transitional period following the 1971 Double before being sold to Second Division side Southampton in December 1976. Whilst with Southampton, he captained the side to promotion in 1978 and the 1979 League Cup final. He spent time on loan managing Philadelphia Fury in the NASL and was transferred to the Vancouver Whitecaps for two seasons, before returning to Blackpool as player–manager and then Southampton for two years as a First Division outfit. Brief spells at Floreat Athena, Eastern and Bristol Rovers concluded his career in 1983.

Ball played 72 games and scored 8 goals for England between 1965 and 1975. First called up at age 20 by manager Alf Ramsey, he established himself in the national team, becoming a starter at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. England won the competition, with Ball playing in the final and being the team&#x27;s youngest member at 21 years of age. He also was starter for England at UEFA Euro 1968 and the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Ball briefly captained England in 1975 under Don Revie before retiring from international football the same year.

After retiring as a player, Ball became manager of Second Division side Portsmouth in 1984. Following narrowly missing out on promotion in his first two seasons, he led Portsmouth to promotion in 1987 after a 28–year absence, but was relegated in the club&#x27;s maiden year in the top flight before resigning in January 1989. Ten months later, he joined Stoke City. After failing to avert the club&#x27;s relegation to the Third Division for the first time in its history, he was sacked in February 1991. In August of the same year, he joined Exeter City. He managed to retain the club&#x27;s third tier status in 1992 and 1993, while also becoming Graham Taylor&#x27;s assistant manager for UEFA Euro 1992, before leaving in January 1994 to join former club Southampton in the Premier League.

After having managed to avoid relegation in 1994 and having finished 10th in 1995, he left the club to controversially join Manchester City. He narrowly failed to save them from relegation and left the club in August 1996. In February 1998, he returned to Division One side Portsmouth, saving the club from relegation in 1998 and 1999 as they entered administration, before being sacked by new owner Milan Mandaric in December 1999. It was his final employment in football before his death in April 2007, aged 61.
== Club career ==
=== Birth and early career at Blackpool ===
Ball was born in Farnworth, Lancashire, the son of (James) Alan Ball, a former professional football player and manager and later a publican, and his wife, Violet, née Duckworth. Ball started his footballing career whilst still a schoolboy, playing for Ashton United, the team his father managed, amongst the hurly burly of the Lancashire Combination. He fell out with his headmaster over missing games for his Farnworth Grammar School team due to him signing and playing for Wolverhampton Wanderers. He left Farnworth Grammar with no qualifications.

After he left school, Wolves decided not to take Ball on. The midfielder then started training with Bolton Wanderers but they too decided not to give him a professional deal, as manager Bill Ridding said he was too small.

Blackpool signed him after Ball&#x27;s father called in a favour with the coach, an old friend with whom he used to play. Ball was given a trial in September 1961 and was immediately signed up as an apprentice. He turned professional in May 1962, making his Football League debut on 18 August 1962 against Liverpool at Anfield in a 2–1 victory. At age 17 years and 98 days, he became Blackpool&#x27;s youngest League debutant. On 21 November 1964, Ball scored his first hat-trick as a professional, in a 3–3 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage.

=== Everton ===
Ball&#x27;s performances in the 1966 World Cup winning England team attracted the attention of a number of clubs bigger than Blackpool. He was eventually sold to Everton for a fee of £112,000 in August 1966, at the time a record transfer fee paid to an English club. At Everton, Ball settled into what became regarded as his generation&#x27;s best Everton midfield trio, alongside Colin Harvey and Howard Kendall (they are still affectionately referred to as &quot;The Holy Trinity&quot;). Everton reached the 1968 FA Cup Final, but lost to West Bromwich Albion and were knocked out by Manchester City in the semi-finals the following year. Ball was as instrumental a player in the team as ever, as Everton took the 1970 Football League Championship title, seeing off a late challenge from Leeds United.

Back at club level, Everton again capitulated in the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1971, with Ball&#x27;s opening goal overhauled by two strikes from Merseyside rivals Liverpool, who went on to lose the final to &quot;double&quot;-chasing Arsenal. Ball played 259 times for the Toffees, in all scoring 79 goals.

=== Arsenal ===
On 22 December 1971, Arsenal paid a record fee of £220,000 to take Ball to Highbury. He was 26 years of age and at his peak for both form and fitness when he joined Arsenal; he made his debut against Nottingham Forest on 27 December 1971.
However, Arsenal could not defend their League title in 1971–72 and also lost their grasp on the FA Cup when Leeds United beat them 1–0 in the centenary final at Wembley.

Ball had continued to play for Arsenal through all this time, as a near-constant member of the first team at first, including 50 appearances in 1972–73. However, Arsenal&#x27;s Double-winning side was soon dismantled and their replacements proved inadequate; Ball remained one of the few quality players in the Arsenal side, and he was made club captain in 1974. In April 1974 Ball broke his leg, resulting in his missing the start of the 1974–75 season, in which Arsenal finished 16th. Ball also missed the start of the 1975–76 season after an injury in the pre-season friendly at Crewe Alexandra, Arsenal subsequently finished in 17th place that season. Bertie Mee resigned as Arsenal manager in the summer of 1976 and it was clear new manager Terry Neill wanted to take the club in a new direction. Now aged 31, Ball continued to play for Arsenal until December 1976, when he was sold to Southampton for a fee of £60,000. In total he made 217 appearances for the Gunners, scoring 52 goals.

=== Southampton ===
Ball&#x27;s move to Southampton was symmetrical in that he had arrived at clubs, namely Everton, Arsenal and Southampton in 1966, 1971 and 1976, when each were holders of the FA Cup. He helped Southampton earn promotion back to the First Division in 1978 and picked up a League Cup runners-up medal in 1979 after they were beaten 3–2 by Nottingham Forest.

=== Move to North America ===
Ball then went to play in the decade-old North American Soccer League, joining the Philadelphia Fury as a player in May 1978. He was named player-coach after former Newcastle United coach Richard Dinnis was fired in June. One season later, after he was no longer coaching, he was sold to the Vancouver Whitecaps in June 1979. Almost instantly he made a huge impact with the Whitecaps and helped lead them to the NASL Soccer Bowl title that September. He also walked away with the 1979 Playoff MVP award, scoring seven goals in nine games.

=== Return to Blackpool ===
He returned to Britain in February 1980 as player-manager of his first professional club, Blackpool, after honouring the remainder of his contract with Vancouver. Blackpool&#x27;s general manager Freddie Scott substituted in the meantime. Ball&#x27;s appointment was well received by the Blackpool supporters, and he returned with enthusiasm, a desire to bring back the good times to the club, and still had enough energy to take the field occasionally.

The year that followed saw Blackpool&#x27;s recent ill-fortune slump even further. The club slid towards relegation, and only some determined performances (including four wins out of their final six games) ensured an 18th-placed finish and survival. During the close season, Ball brought in several new faces and was also prepared to gamble on youngsters. One of his most unpopular moves amongst the fans was the sale of Tony Kellow, a huge favourite at Bloomfield Road. The 1980–81 season began in similar fashion, with Blackpool struggling near the foot of the table. The optimism that had been in place during pre-season turned to anger as the team&#x27;s performances failed to match up to Ball&#x27;s promises.

After an FA Cup first-round win over Fylde Coast neighbours Fleetwood Town on 22 November, Ball publicly criticised the fans for allegedly not wanting the team to succeed as much as he did. Eventually it all became too much for manager and club, and shortly after a defeat at Brentford on 28 February 1981, Ball&#x27;s contract was terminated with immediate effect and the mutual love affair had ended in ruins. Blackpool were relegated at the end of the season. In March 2005, Ball finally commented on his time as Blackpool manager. He said, &quot;Jack Charlton, a good friend, had offered me a coaching role at Sheffield Wednesday, and with hindsight I should have done that instead: got a bit of experience under my belt. Another thing I should have done was kept Stan Ternent on. I replaced him as manager, but he was very good. I think I was a bit big-headed, a little headstrong, and I thought being a player-manager would be no problem for me. It was a lot more difficult than I thought, and not helped by dealing with the boardroom.&quot;

=== Back at Southampton and end of playing career ===
In March 1981, Ball was tempted back to Southampton to play alongside fellow veterans and former England teammates Mick Channon and Kevin Keegan. He left Southampton in October 1982 to play for Hong Kong side Eastern, before joining Bristol Rovers in January 1983, where he remained until his retirement the following season. When Ball finally retired from playing, he had played 975 competitive games in 21 years.

== International career ==
=== 1966 World Cup ===
Despite being in a struggling Blackpool team, Ball&#x27;s industry, stamina and distribution were noticed by England manager Alf Ramsey, who gave him his international debut on 9 May 1965 in a 1–1 draw with Yugoslavia in Belgrade, three days before his twentieth birthday. Ramsey was preparing for the World Cup a year later, which England was to host, and was developing a system whereby England could deploy midfielders with a defensive and industrious bent, something which was not wholly guaranteed from conventional wide men. As a result, Ball became a useful tool for Ramsey to use – able to play conventionally wide or in the centre but still in possession of the energy to help out his defence when required.

Ball was the youngest member of the squad of 22 selected by Ramsey for the tournament, aged only 21. Though England as a team emerged collectively heroic from the tournament, Ball was one of many players regarded as an individual success, especially as he was one of the more inexperienced charges with no proven record at the very highest level. Indeed, he, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters emerged with enormous credit and eternal acclaim from the competition – and all of them were still only in single figures for caps won by the time they were named in the team for the final against West Germany.

The 98,000 crowd at Wembley witnessed a magnificent personal performance from Ball. Full of running, he continued to work and sprint and track back while teammates and opponents alike were out on their feet. With fewer than 15 minutes to go, he won a corner on the right which he promptly took. Hurst hit a shot from the edge of the area which deflected into the air and down on to the instep of Peters, who rifled England 2–1 ahead. The Germans equalised with seconds to go, meaning that the game went into extra time. Somehow, this instilled extra bounce into Ball&#x27;s play and the image of his continuous running round the Wembley pitch, socks round his ankles, is one of the most enduring of the occasion. It was his chase and low cross which set up Hurst&#x27;s massively controversial second goal, and England&#x27;s third; he was also sprinting upfield, unmarked and screaming for a pass, as Hurst took the ball forward to smash his historic hat-trick goal with the last kick of the game. Ball returned to a civic reception in Walkden, Lancashire following the World Cup success, where he lived with his parents and sister. Ball&#x27;s appearance in the final marked the last occasion on which a Blackpool player received a full England cap.

=== 1970 World Cup ===

By now, Ball was one of the first names on Ramsey&#x27;s England teamsheet and he was in the squad which travelled as defending champions to the altitude of Mexico for the 1970 World Cup. Ball famously hit the crossbar with a shot as England lost one of their group games 1–0 to Brazil. England won their other group games and progressed to another showdown with West Germany in the quarter finals, but the heat sapped Ball&#x27;s natural industry. England lost a 2–0 lead and their reign as world champions ended with a 3–2 loss.

=== 1974 World Cup ===
In a qualifier for the 1974 World Cup against Poland in Chorzów on 6 June 1973, Ball became the second England player to be sent off in a full international, after grabbing Lesław Ćmikiewicz by the throat and kneeing him in the groin during a player scuffle. As a result, he missed the return game at Wembley Stadium, which became one of the most notorious in English football history, ending in a 1–1 draw. England failed to qualify for the World Cup as a result of not winning.

=== Captaincy and retirement ===
Ramsey was sacked and Joe Mercer took over at a caretaker level, for whom Ball never appeared due to injury. However, Ball&#x27;s relationship with his national side was enhanced and then soured beyond repair when Don Revie was appointed as Ramsey&#x27;s permanent replacement. Ball was given the captaincy after the dropping of Emlyn Hughes and held it for six consecutive games, none of which England lost. They included a 2–0 victory over reigning World champions, West Germany in March 1975 and a 5–1 defeat of Scotland in May 1975.

After sustaining an injury in a pre-season friendly for Arsenal at Crewe Alexandra, Ball was not called up at all for England, let alone retained as captain, when Revie announced his squad for a game against Switzerland. Ball only found out when his wife took a call from a journalist asking for her reaction. Aged 30, Ball&#x27;s international career had ended suddenly and acrimoniously after 72 appearances and eight goals. He was, however, the last of the 1966 World Cup winning team to leave the international stage (although not the last in the squad, as Ian Callaghan was unexpectedly called up by Ron Greenwood in 1977).

== Style of play ==

Considered one of the greatest players to have played for Everton, Ball was a complete and combative midfielder with good technique who possessed high levels of stamina, accurate passing abilities, and was capable of providing scoring chances for his teammates as well as scoring some spectacular goals himself. Primarily an attacking box-to-box midfielder who drove forward towards the opponents&#x27; goal, Ball would also help out the defenders of his team when they were in a pinch. Ken Rogers noted that Ball&#x27;s fiery mentality was the key to his success as a footballer. Ball also stood out for being a motivator, with John Morrissey noting that whenever Ball played one-twos with any of his teammates, they would be motivated to play.

== Coaching and managerial career ==
=== Portsmouth ===
Ball resumed his managerial career in May 1984 with Portsmouth and was a huge success. They just missed out on promotion to the First Division in his first two seasons as manager, and he finally guided them to the top flight in 1987. However, they were relegated after just one season back among the elite, and Ball was sacked in January 1989 for failing to mount a serious promotion challenge and because of a serious personality clash with Portsmouth&#x27;s then chairman Jim Gregory.

=== Stoke City ===
The following month he joined Colchester United as assistant to Jock Wallace and in October 1989 took up a similar post under Mick Mills at Stoke City. However, Mills was sacked two weeks later and Ball was promoted to the manager&#x27;s seat. He came to the conclusion that the squad he had inherited was simply not good enough and out went Chris Kamara, Dave Bamber, Leigh Palin, Carl Saunders, Gary Hackett and Nicky Morgan. Into the side came Tony Ellis, Lee Sandford, Tony Kelly, Dave Kevan, Paul Barnes and Noel Blake. It was a big gamble by Ball to change so much of the squad so quickly, and it did not pay off. Stoke stayed rooted to the bottom of the table and was relegated to the Third Division for the first time in 63 years.

Ball&#x27;s next objective was to gain an instant return to the Second Division, which looked an achievable goal as after 12 matches in 1990–91 they were one of the favourites for promotion. But Stoke&#x27;s form fell off and with some embarrassing results the side dropped down the table, until after a 4–0 defeat away at Wigan Athletic Ball was sacked. Stoke went on to finish 14th, their lowest league position.

=== Exeter City and England ===
In July 1991 he was appointed as manager of Third Division Exeter City. Although Exeter struggled (their form hardly helped by a tight budget), Ball managed to keep them in the Third Division (the new Division Two from the creation of the Premier League in 1992) in 1993, though by the time he moved on they were on their way to relegation to the bottom tier. Between February and August 1992 he also worked as a coach for the England team under Graham Taylor, including the 1992 European Championships, which were not a success for England, as they failed to progress beyond the group stages of the tournament in Sweden.

=== Southampton ===
In January 1994, Ball left Exeter to take over the reins at Southampton, replacing the unpopular Ian Branfoot. At the time of his appointment, Southampton seemed doomed to relegation, having spent virtually the whole season to that point in the drop zone. Ball&#x27;s first task as manager was to re-establish Matthew Le Tissier&#x27;s role in the team and to ensure that the other players recognised that he was the club&#x27;s greatest asset. Le Tissier responded by scoring six goals in Ball&#x27;s first four games in charge, including a hat-trick on 14 February 1994 in a 4–2 victory over Liverpool. In the second half of the 1993–94 season, Le Tissier played 16 games under Ball&#x27;s management, scoring 15 times.

After three defeats over the Easter period, the Saints remained in the relegation zone. In the final six games Saints scored 15 goals (eight from Le Tissier) and gained 10 points which were sufficient to confirm safety on the final day of the season.

At the start of the following season, 1994–95, Ball signed goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar but more significantly signed Le Tissier on a new three-year deal. Despite not winning any of their first four games (including a 5–1 defeat at Newcastle), the Saints, assisted by three goals from loanee signing Ronnie Ekelund, then won four out of five games in September lifting them to seventh in the table. After this, they drifted away and only won two more games until mid-March, dropping into the relegation zone. On 22 March 1995, the Saints were at home to Newcastle and were trailing 1–0 with four minutes left; however, the team scored three goals, including two in injury time, to snatch an amazing and priceless victory.

This result inspired the Saints, who won five of their remaining 10 games and finished the season in 10th place.

=== Manchester City ===
Despite this success, Ball was tempted away in July 1995 to become Manchester City&#x27;s manager under the ownership of former England teammate Francis Lee. His departure from The Dell was rather acrimonious and for some years afterwards, Ball&#x27;s return visits to the Dell were greeted by abuse from some sections of the Saints&#x27; fans.

Ball&#x27;s tenure at Maine Road was controversial, in that many observers and supporters felt he was appointed for his name and friendship with the chairman rather than for any credentials as a coach (and they argued that previous manager Brian Horton, appointed by Lee&#x27;s predecessor Peter Swales, had done no wrong). This is debatable, as City had finished 16th and 17th under Horton, after finishing fifth, fifth and then ninth under Horton&#x27;s predecessor Peter Reid.

Ball gave Paul Walsh, who had scored 15 league and cup goals for City in 1994–95, and cash, to Portsmouth in exchange for Gerry Creaney, who scored four goals for City in 1995–96. But a terrible start to the 1995–96 season saw City endure eight defeats and not win one of their opening 11 games. November saw a turnaround in fortunes when City finally managed to win a league game at the 12th attempt and follow this up with a draw and two wins which saw them end the month outside the relegation zone and Ball chosen Premier League Manager of the Month for November 1995.

City&#x27;s form declined after that, and the team drew 2–2 with Liverpool on the final day of the season. The other relegation-threatened teams fared better, and City were relegated on goal difference, after seven successive seasons of top-flight football. The board kept faith with Ball, but he resigned three games into the next season&#x27;s Division One campaign. He felt that he had been forced to sell their best players due to City&#x27;s financial plight.

=== Back to Portsmouth ===
In January 1998, Ball was contacted by Brian Howe, who informed him he was to make a takeover bid for the club and that he would like Ball to manage the club. This led to Ball returning to Portsmouth as manager in February 1998, however the take-over never came about. When he was appointed Pompey were several points adrift at the bottom of the table and enduring a near-fatal financial crisis, going into administration for over a year. In 1998, he masterminded a miraculous escape that saw two of his former sides (Stoke City and Manchester City) relegated after Pompey won 3–1 at Bradford City on the final day of the season. He also kept them up in the 1998–99 season, but his contract was terminated on 9 December 1999 with the club in the lower half of Division One, having amassed 20 points in 21 games. His departure came six months after the club was rescued from financial oblivion by new owner Milan Mandaric. On his retirement, 54-year-old Ball was the last remaining England World Cup winner in management.

== Personal life ==
Ball was educated at Farnworth Grammar School. Ball&#x27;s father Alan Sr., also a professional footballer and manager, died in a car crash in Cyprus in January 1982. In April 2021, Ball&#x27;s son, Jimmy, became the third generation of the family to manage in the Football League after being appointed interim manager at Forest Green Rovers.

Ball was always a distinctive figure thanks to his diminutive stature, red hair, and his high-pitched voice. He wrote an autobiography, &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; in 1967, updated as &quot;It&#x27;s All About a Ball&quot;, in 1978. His third autobiography, &quot;Playing Extra Time&quot; (2004) received critical acclaim giving insight into his highs and lows in the footballing world.

In April 2004, Ball appeared for Testwood Baptist Church in the Roger Frapwell Testimonial Match at the BAT ground, Totton, near Southampton, wearing the number 7 shirt as he did in the 1966 World Cup triumph. Also in that team were former Saints manager Dave Merrington and ex-Saints defender Francis Benali. The proceeds from the game were donated to local charity SCRATCH.

As a family man, Ball struggled privately after his wife and later his youngest daughter were both diagnosed with major illnesses. Lesley, whom he married on 21 May 1967 at the parish church of St Stephen, Kearsley, Lancashire, died on 16 May 2004, aged 57, after a three-year battle against ovarian cancer. Alan and Lesley, who had been together for five years prior to their marriage, had three children together; Mandy, Keely and Jimmy. They also had three grandchildren.

He had remained in the family home in Warsash, and from mid-2005, Ball had an ongoing relationship with childhood friend Valerie Beech, ex-wife of former Bolton player Harry Beech. In May 2005, Ball put his World Cup winner&#x27;s medal and commemorative tournament cap up for auction to raise money for his family, saying &quot;They are just trinkets that take up space, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even looked at them for years. My memories of the World Cup are more important than those things to me, and my family are even more important.&quot; The items were sold for £140,000.

Ball is the great uncle of professional footballers John McAtee and James McAtee.

== Death ==
Ball, aged 61, died in the early hours of 25 April 2007 at his home in Hook, Fareham, Hampshire, after suffering a heart attack while attempting to put out a blaze in his garden that had started when a bonfire – on which he had been burning garden waste – re-ignited and spread to a nearby fence. His funeral was held in Winchester Cathedral on 3 May 2007. Many of Ball&#x27;s former football colleagues were in attendance, and the flat cap that he had become well known for wearing was placed on top of his coffin.

The Alan Ball Memorial Cup, a charity match between two squads of former international players, in the shape of &quot;England vs the World&quot;, was played on 29 July 2007, with proceeds going towards the Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research and the Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance Service.

<text>HMS &quot;Raglan&quot; was a First World War Royal Navy monitor, which was sunk during the Battle of Imbros in January 1918.

==Design==
On 3 November 1914, Charles M. Schwab of Bethlehem Steel offered Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, the use of eight /45 cal BL MK II guns in twin gun turrets, originally destined for the Greek battleship . These turrets could not be delivered to the German builders, due to the British blockade. The Royal Navy immediately designed a class of monitors, designed for shore bombardment, to use the turrets.

==Construction==
&quot;Raglan&quot; was laid down at the Harland &amp; Wolff Ltd shipyard at Govan on 1 December 1914. The ship was named &quot;Robert E Lee&quot; in honour of the CSA General Robert E Lee, however as the United States was still neutral, the ship was hurriedly renamed HMS &quot;M3&quot; on 31 May 1915. She was then named HMS &quot;Lord Raglan&quot; on 20 June 1915 and again renamed HMS &quot;Raglan&quot; on 23 June 1915.

==Career==
