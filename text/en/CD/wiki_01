<text>William Donald Doran (born May 28, 1958) is a former second baseman in Major League Baseball who played from 1982 to 1993 with the Houston Astros, Cincinnati Reds and Milwaukee Brewers. He was the bench coach for the Kansas City Royals from 2005 to 2007 and posted a 4-6 record as the Royals&#x27; interim manager to close the 2006 season. Doran rejoined the Reds on November 2, 2007, as the minor league infielding/baserunning coordinator. After previously serving as the minor league field coordinator, Doran moved into the role of special assistant to the general manager, player performance role for the Reds for the 2019 season.

==Early life==
Doran attended Mount Healthy High School and played baseball at the Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. At Mt. Healthy, he starred in baseball, basketball, and football, leading the Owls to several league championships as an All-League quarterback. In 1977, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

==Baseball career==
Selected by the Houston Astros in the sixth round of the 1979 amateur draft, Doran broke into the majors as a September call-up in the 1982 season. That year, he would play in 26 games while batting .278 on 27 hits. For the 1983 season, he would be the starting second baseman for the Astros, which started with Opening Day. He would play in 154 games and having a batting line of a .271 batting average to go with a .371 on-base percentage (OBP). In the fourth game of the year, he recorded his first career home run off John Candelaria of the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 10. Doran led the team in walks with 86 (with eleven being intentional, also a team high), which worked in contrast to his 67 strikeouts; dubiously, he would steal twelve bases but also be caught stealing twelve times. It was the first of eight times that he would have more walks than strikeouts in a season; he finished fifth in the Rookie of the Year Award, which went to Darryl Strawberry. He would decrease in productivity slightly in 1984, playing in 147 games while batting .271. He walked 66 times and struck out 69 times while having 143 hits and 41 runs batted in (RBI). Dubiously, while he was second in a general amount of offensive categories to José Cruz, he led the Astros in times caught stealing (12). For the following season, he batted .287 while playing 148 games, for which he would have 71 walks to go with 69 strikeouts. He led the Astros in runs, hits, walks, stolen bases and also times caught stealing. He received votes for the Most Valuable Player award.

The Astros, having experienced a downturn since the back-to-back playoff berths in 1980 and 1981, bounced back in 1986, and Doran was there to contribute. He played in 145 games while batting .276, stealing 42 bases alongside 81 walks to 57 strikeouts. He would lead the team in runs, stolen bases, and perhaps most dubiously in times caught stealing (19, which led the league). Doran finished eleventh in the voting for NL Most Valuable Player that year In the 1986 National League Championship Series, he would have a cold bat for most of the series, having six hits on 29 plate appearances. Doran hit a home run off Ron Darling in the second inning to give the Astros a 4-0 lead. However, the team could not hold it together for the last four innings and lost 6-5. In Game 5, with the series tied at two, he would hit a groundout with two runners on and one out in the fifth inning that scored the first run of the game, although the Mets would win it in the ninth on a walk-off hit in the 12th inning. In the pivotal Game 6, often thought of as one of the best postseason games played of the season, Doran would have a small part in the overall result. Doran had a single and was then forced out at second base in the first inning that would later see four straight Astros get on base and result in a 3-0 initial lead. The Mets would tie the game and the teams dueled it out until the 16th inning. Doran, with a runner on first and one out while trailing 7-4, hit a single to try and continue a potential rally. He would score the 6th run of the game for the Astros on a Glenn Davis single, but the next batter in Kevin Bass was struck out by Jesse Orosco to end the game and series.

Before the 1987 season, Doran lost an arbitration case with the Astros, as he had sought a raise of $275,000 from his previous salary (which was $550,000), with the result being that he was paid only $625,000. He had his best year that season, as he led the NL in games played (162), batted .283, hit a career high 16 home runs, had a career high .992 fielding percentage, and scored a career high 79 runs. Doran however would recoil in the following year. He batted .248 while playing in 132 games while having 65 walks to 60 strikeouts. After the season, Doran underwent rotator cuff surgery.

He had much of the same success with the following year, as he batted .219 but managed to play in 142 games while having 22 stolen bases and 59 walks to 63 strikeouts. He recorded his 1,000th hit on June 16, doing so on a home run off Ed Whitson against the San Diego Padres. For the 1990 season, it was to be his last with the Astros. On August 30, he was traded for Terry McGriff, Keith Kaiser, and Butch Henry to the Cincinnati Reds, his hometown team. He had turned down a trade to the New York Mets the day before. Although the Reds won the World Series that year, Doran had back surgery the day the team clinched the division pennant and he missed the rest of the season. &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel like I belonged. I was just a rented player&quot;, Doran said. In a combined season of 126 games, he batted .300 while having 23 stolen bases with 79 walks to 58 strikeouts. He would sign with the Reds for the next two seasons. He played 111 games the following year, batting .280 while having 46 walks to 39 strikeouts. His 1992 season was his last as a mostly-every week player, since he appeared in 132 games while batting .235, while Bip Roberts emerged as a standout player to use on second base more so than Doran. He had 64 walks to 40 strikeouts. A purchase from Milwaukee in January 1993 did not lend itself to increased time, as he would play just 28 games for the Brewers while dealing with injuries. He batted .217 while having just one stolen base.

Doran had a career .266 batting average, but had four seasons when he placed in the top 10 in the National League in bases on balls. Doran never made an All-Star team, but was extraordinarily popular at The Astrodome and admired for his hustle and ferocity, reminiscent of Cincinnati native Pete Rose. He was widely considered the best Astros second baseman in team history until the emergence of Craig Biggio, who eclipsed Doran in offensive statistics but never approached Doran&#x27;s defensive capacity. He is among the career leaders in many offensive categories for the Astros. He is top 10 in at bats (8th), runs (8th), hits (8th), singles (8th), triples (10th), total bases (9th), and bases on balls (6th). He is one of thirteen Astros to have collected 1,000 hits.

Doran became a minor league instructor for the Reds in 1995. In 1999 and 2000, Doran served as the organization&#x27;s minor league field coordinator, director of player development and assistant to the general manager. He became a major league coach for the Reds in November 2000. After a 96-loss season in 2001, the Reds did not renew the contracts of Doran or third base coach Ron Oester. Doran joined the Kansas City Royals coaching staff in 2005 and became their bench coach the following year. He is currently a special assistant to the Reds.

On January 21, 2023, the Astros announced that Doran was to be inducted into the Houston Astros Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2023 with former broadcaster Bill Brown. An induction ceremony was held at Minute Maid Park prior to the start a contest versus the Los Angeles Angels on August 12, 2023.

<doc id="873436" wikidata="Q1431305" url="?curid=873436" title="Vaporizer (inhalation device)">
<text>A vaporizer or vaporiser, colloquially known as a vape, is a device used to vaporize substances for inhalation. Plant substances can be used, commonly cannabis, tobacco, or other herbs or blends of essential oil. However, they are most commonly filled with a combination propylene glycol, glycerin, and drugs such as nicotine (e.g. extract from tobacco) or tetrahydrocannabinol as a liquid solution.

Vaporizers contain various forms of extraction chambers including straight bore, venturi, or sequential venturi, and are made of materials such as metal or glass. The extracted vapor may be collected in an inflatable bag, or inhaled directly through a hose or pipe. When used properly, cooler temperatures due to lack of combustion result in significantly more efficient extraction of the ingredients. Hence, the irritating and harmful effects of smoking are heavily reduced, as is its secondhand smoke.

==Cannabis vaporizers==
Cannabis flower is commonly consumed using a dry herb vaporizer. The cannabis may be heated in a chamber via indirect flame exposure or an electrical heating element, allowing users to inhale the resulting vapor. The temperatures reached are cooler than the combustion temperature of cannabis, which is around 230–315 °C (445–600 °F).

Vaporizing is more efficient than smoking, because approximately 30% of THC in cannabis or hashish cigarettes is destroyed by pyrolysis during smoking.

Cannabis is also consumed via the vaporization of cannabis concentrates or oils that have been extracted from the plant, commonly referred to as &quot;dabbing&quot;. Users typically employ a torch to heat a small cup shaped quartz or titanium attachment on a bong before dabbing the oil onto the heated surface and inhaling the vapors through the bong. This route of consumption is generally much more potent than smoking or vaporizing marijuana flower due to the increased concentration of cannabinoids. Users typically report that the effects of dabbing are much more intense than regular cannabis, while also being shorter lived. 

Cannabis concentrate is also commonly used in e-cigarette style vaporizer pens in the form of liquid containers known as cartridges. A battery connected to the atomizer is used to heat the cannabis oil, creating a vapor that is inhaled by the user. Cartridges typically contain different preparations of cannabis oil mixed with cannabinoids, terpenes, solvents (primarily Propylene glycol and Glycerol) used for thinning, fatty acids, and flavonoids. Natural or artificial terpenes are frequently added by manufacturers to enhance flavor, often using blends that mimic popular cannabis strains or sugary foods such as candy or pastries.

Of the studies that have investigated cannabis vaporization, few have addressed the quality of the vapor extracted and delivered; instead, studies usually focus on the mode of usage of the vaporizers. However, those that have addressed vapor quality have demonstrated promising results. Such studies suggest that the absence of combustion results in an aerosol that contains significantly lower amounts of harmful substances found in smoke, such as tar, carbon monoxide, and carcinogenic compounds known as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). One study found that cannabis smoke contains 111 compounds (including several carcinogenic PAHs) in addition to the cannabinoids, whereas only 3 additional compounds were identified in cannabis vapor, other than the cannabinoids. This suggests that the vaporization of cannabis may be a safer alternative to combusted cannabis. On the other hand, a study in the UK (where cannabis is illegal) found that some illicitly distributed cannabis vaporizers contained harmful levels of xylazine, an animal sedative which can lead to overdose.

==E-cigarette vaporizers==

An electronic cigarette is a handheld battery-powered vaporizer that simulates smoking by providing some of the behavioral aspects of smoking, including the hand-to-mouth action of smoking, but without combusting tobacco. Using an e-cigarette is known as &quot;vaping&quot; and the user is referred to as a &quot;vaper.&quot; Instead of cigarette smoke, the user inhales an aerosol, commonly called vapor. E-cigarettes typically have a heating element that atomizes a liquid solution called e-liquid. E-cigarettes may be automatically activated by taking a puff; others turn on manually by pressing a button. Some e-cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes, but they come in many variations. Most versions are reusable, though some are disposable. There are first-generation, second-generation, third-generation, and fourth-generation devices. E-liquids usually contain propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine, flavorings, additives, and differing amounts of contaminants. E-liquids are also sold without propylene glycol, nicotine, or flavors. 
The benefits and the health risks of e-cigarettes are uncertain. There is tentative evidence they may help people quit smoking, although they have not been proven to be more effective than smoking cessation medicine. There is concern with the possibility that non-smokers and children may start nicotine use with e-cigarettes at a rate higher than anticipated than if they were never created. Following the possibility of nicotine addiction from e-cigarette use, there is concern children may start smoking cigarettes. Youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to go on to smoke cigarettes. Their part in tobacco harm reduction is unclear, while another review found they appear to have the potential to lower tobacco-related death and disease. Regulated US Food and Drug Administration nicotine replacement products may be safer than e-cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are generally seen as safer than combusted tobacco products. It is estimated their safety risk to users is similar to that of smokeless tobacco. The long-term effects of e-cigarette use are unknown. The risk from serious adverse events was reported in 2016 to be low. Less serious adverse effects include abdominal pain, headache, blurry vision, throat and mouth irritation, vomiting, nausea, and coughing. Nicotine itself is associated with some health harms.
In 2019 and 2020, an outbreak of severe lung illness throughout the US has been linked to the use of contaminated black market THC vape cartridges.

==Other drug ==
Vaporizers can be used to inhale other recreational drugs as well. A wide variety can be consumed this way, either dissolved in e-liquid or vaporized directly. The use of e-cigarettes to inhale the psychedelic drug DMT has been reported.

==Medical vaporizers==
Studies have shown that vaporizing cannabis exposes the user to lower levels of harmful substances than smoking cannabis. These findings are important for it is estimated that 10–20% of patients with chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and HIV/AIDS have admitted to smoking cannabis for therapeutic purposes. For patients, a study found that smoking cannabis sativa reduced daily pain by 34%, a statistically significant amount.

In a study published in the &quot;Journal of Psychopharmacology&quot; in May 2008, it was stated that vaporizers were a &quot;suitable method for the administration of THC&quot;. A 2007 study by the University of California, San Francisco, published in the &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Neurology&quot;, found that &quot;there was virtually no exposure to harmful combustion products using the vaporizing device&quot;. A 2006 study performed by researchers at Leiden University found that vaporizers were &quot;safe and effective cannabinoid delivery system(s)&quot;. The study stated that the amount of THC delivered by vaporizers were equivalent to the amount delivered by smoking. Because of those studies and other studies, vaporizers are considered medically sound devices for delivering THC.

===Efficiency===
The proposed factors affecting output include:
* Temperature
* Specimen density
* Weight, content of water and essential oils
* Consistency of material in the filling chamber
* Storage time of the vapor
* Inhalation method (breathing technique)

Not all those have been scientifically tested. Research using vaporizers found the delivery efficiency highest at around , falling to about half efficiency at depending on material. The purest preparations produced the highest efficiencies, about 56% for pure THC versus 29% for plant material (female flower tops) with 12% THCA content. Besides THC, several other cannabinoids as well as a range of other plant components including terpenoids were detected in the plant material. Using pure THC in the vaporizer, no degradation products (delta-8-THC (D8-THC), cannabinol (CBN), or unknown compounds) were detected by HPLC analysis. The longer vapor is stored, the more THC is lost as it condenses on the surface of the vaporizer or the balloon. This loss may be negligible over a few minutes but may exceed 50% after 90 minutes. The Leiden University study found that as much as 30–40% of inhaled THC was not absorbed by the lungs but simply exhaled. However, they did not find large individual differences in the amounts exhaled.

==Culinary application==
Vaporizers are sometimes used by chefs as a method of applying controlled heat to herbs and spices to release flavors that are otherwise difficult to titrate or apply, or that might be spoiled by overheating during cooking. Grant Achatz, chef-proprietor of Alinea in Chicago, &quot;uses the aroma-filled bags as place-mats, punctured when plates are placed in front of the customer&quot;.

<text>Mount Warning (Bundjalung: Wollumbin), a mountain in the Tweed Range in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia, was formed from a volcanic plug of the now-gone Tweed Volcano. The mountain is located west-south-west of Murwillumbah, near the border between New South Wales and Queensland.
Lieutenant James Cook saw the mountain from the sea and named it Mount Warning.

==Shield volcano==

Wollumbin is the central volcanic remnant of an ancient shield volcano, the Tweed Volcano, which would have been about above sea level or just under twice the height of the current mountain. This volcano last erupted around 23 million years ago. As the mountain&#x27;s central vent cooled it shrank, forming a depression at the top that has greatly eroded.


Today the vast areas that were part of the volcano include many mountains and ranges at some distance from Mount Warning, and include the Border Ranges, Tamborine Mountain, the McPherson Range and both the Lamington Plateau and Springbrook Plateaus. The erosion caldera formed since this eruption is easily visible around the summit and forms the rim of the Tweed Valley.

During the last stages of eruption, different and more resistant forms of lava that were cooler than those flows that created the shield volcano remained to form the current peak. The whole central Mount Warning massif was also pushed up by forces that remained active after lava eruptions had stopped.

== Ecology ==
A species of frog, the Mount Wollumbin hip-pocket frog (&quot;Assa wollumbin&quot;) is endemic to the slopes of the mountain.

==Aboriginal significance==
Wollumbin is a place of cultural and traditional significance to the Bundjalung people and contains sacred sites, where particular ceremonies and initiation rites are performed. The summit area of the Mountain is a declared &quot;Aboriginal Place&quot; under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act&quot;.  

While now spelt Wollumbin, the Aboriginal word had numerous alternative spellings which are recorded in the historic record including; Walumban, Walumbin, and Wooloombin, all referring to the same place. In 1873 reference can be found to the Mountain being referred to by Aboriginal people as &quot;Wollumbin&quot;, signifying &quot;big fellow mountain&quot;. The Aboriginal significance of the area is contextual and dependant on direction of observance, gender, and status of whoever is telling the story. Several different stories exist about Wollumbin including reference to the Mountain as the Warrior Chief, a special place of significance for brush turkey, and the cloud catcher. Many more stories exist that are not in the public record.

The name Wollumbin refers to the whole of the central vent and its surrounding ring dykes.

The Bundjalung people observe cultural and traditional restrictions forbidding the uninitiated from climbing the mountain, and, as such, ask that others also do not attempt to climb the mountain. The government National Parks and Wildlife Service advertise this request and do not encourage climbers to hike the Mt. Warning/Wollumbin Trail up the mountain, but it is not forbidden by park regulations.

== Name confusion ==
In 2005 the name &quot;Mount Wollumbin&quot; was removed from a peak nearby to Mount Warning by the Geographical Names Board. This mountain is also referred to as Mount Ivy and Mount Dum Dum and was believed to be named Mount Wollumbin in error. In 2006 the Geographical Names Board assigned dual naming to Mount Warning, to also be known by its indigenous name of Wollumbin. The name Wollumbin refers the whole of the central vent and its surrounding ring dykes.

==Etymology==
On 16 May 1770, Captain James Cook was the first European to record seeing &quot;… a remarkable sharp peaked Mountain lying inland…&quot; from a point of land he named Cape Byron. Just five hours later while sailing North, Cook was forced to change course to the East after encountering the dangerous reefs that run 3 miles to the East from Fingal Head, now named Danger Reefs (Inner, South, and Outer reefs).

The next morning, Cook recorded:

==Protected area==

The mountain is now protected by the surrounding Wollumbin National Park, and access is regulated by the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. Mount Warning is part of the United Nations World Heritage-listed Gondwana Rainforests of Australia.

==Walking track==
Over 100,000 people a year make the , five-hour round-trip trek to the top from .

An ascent of the mountain takes approximately 1½ to 3½ hours (one way) and requires a good level of fitness. There are also viewing platforms at the summit. The total journey is 8.8 km (5.5 mi).

In March 2020 the summit track was closed by National Parks NSW citing safety concerns, to be reviewed in May 2021. However, in February 2021 documents obtained through Freedom Of Information revealed that the track and surrounding area has actually been secretly scheduled to be permanently closed. As of August 2022 park authorities had placed a barrier on the access road several kilometres from the trailhead. This would add a forty minute uphill walk to the ascent for anyone attempting to climb the mountain; and the path on the mountain itself had deteriorated badly in places.

In late October 2022 NSW authorities did go ahead and ban public access to Wollumbin National Park, to be enforced with heavy fines. This was soon followed by a video posting showing a hiker flouting the ban. There has been significant backlash in the community surrounding the closure. Many have argued that the track was closed primarily due to complaints from some in the Aboriginal community, not due to safety concerns and the track was in fact still usable. 

In 2024, Libertarian politician John Ruddick led a petition to reopen the track which garnered over the required 10,000 signatures to trigger a debate in the New South Wales Legislative Council on 9 May 2024.
On 31 October 2024, the neo-Nazi group National Socialist Network posted to X boasting of their recent hike to the summit where while wearing balaclavas they unfurled a banner advocating for white supremacy. NSW Environment Minister Penny Sharpe described the actions as &quot;vile&quot; and &quot;utterly disgusting&quot;. The matter has been referred to the police by the National Parks. No one has been charged over the incident.

<text>The national holidays in the Netherlands are:

While there are other holidays that are widely celebrated, these are not officially recognised national holidays. They are as follows:

* While Saint Nicholas&#x27;s Eve (the eve of Sinterklaas, also called &quot;Sinterklaasavond&quot; or &quot;Pakjesavond&quot;) on 5 December is not a national holiday, it is widely celebrated. Saint Nicholas&#x27;s traditional name day is on 6 December; it is however Saint Nicholas&#x27;s Eve, the day before, which is the focus of celebrations in the Netherlands.
* In the south and east of the Netherlands, Carnival is celebrated on the three days before Ash Wednesday. The earliest possible date is on 1 February, the latest possible date is 9 March. Though not an official holiday, many people, particularly in the south, take the week off to celebrate. Schools in both regions schedule their spring holiday at the same time.
* There has been some debate over whether the Islamic holiday of &quot;Eid ul-Fitr&quot; (&quot;Suikerfeest&quot; in Dutch, lit. &#x27;Sugar festival&#x27;) should be a national holiday. This was met by opposition from right-wing political parties such as the PVV and SGP. For now, &quot;Eid ul-Fitr&quot; is not an official national holiday, but it usually justifies a day off for Islamic employees. Those opposed to this proposition say that there are enough national holidays as it is. Schools are still able to give additional days off for this purpose.

<text>Radiata or Radiates is a historical taxonomic rank that was used to classify animals with radially symmetric body plans. The term Radiata is no longer accepted, as it united several different groupings of animals that do not form a monophyletic group under current views of animal phylogeny. The similarities once offered in justification of the taxon, such as radial symmetry, are now taken to be the result of either incorrect evaluations by early researchers or convergent evolution, rather than an indication of a common ancestor. Because of this, the term is used mostly in a historical context.

In the early 19th century, Georges Cuvier united Ctenophora and Cnidaria in the Radiata (&quot;Zoophytes&quot;). Thomas Cavalier-Smith, in 1983, redefined Radiata as a subkingdom consisting of Myxozoa, Placozoa, Cnidaria and Ctenophora. Lynn Margulis and K. V. Schwartz later redefined Radiata in their &quot;Five Kingdom&quot; classification, this time including only Cnidaria and Ctenophora. This definition is similar to the historical descriptor Coelenterata, which has also been proposed as a group encompassing Cnidaria and Ctenophora.

Although radial symmetry is usually given as a defining characteristic in animals that have been classified in this group, there are clear exceptions and qualifications. Echinoderms, for example, exhibit unmistakable bilateral symmetry as larvae, and are now in the Bilateria. Ctenophores exhibit biradial or rotational symmetry, defined by tentacular and pharyngeal axes, on which two anal canals are located in two diametrically opposed quadrants. Some species within the cnidarian class Anthozoa are bilaterally symmetric (For example, &quot;Nematostella vectensis&quot;). It has been suggested that bilateral symmetry may have evolved before the split between Cnidaria and Bilateria, and that the radially symmetrical cnidarians have secondarily evolved radial symmetry, meaning the bilaterality in cnidarian species like &quot;N. vectensis&quot; has a primary origin.

The differing definitions assigned by zoologists are listed in the table.

<text>Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle (released in some international markets as Harold &amp; Kumar Get the Munchies) is a 2004 American buddy stoner comedy film directed by Danny Leiner, written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, and starring John Cho, Kal Penn, Neil Patrick Harris, Anthony Anderson and Fred Willard. The first installment in the &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar&quot; franchise, the film follows Harold Lee (Cho) and Kumar Patel (Penn) on their adventure to a White Castle restaurant after smoking marijuana.

Hurwitz and Schlossberg developed &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle&quot; based on experiences and people from when they attended Randolph High School. The filmmakers received license permission from White Castle in 2002. White Castle also contributed to the film&#x27;s marketing campaign, releasing tie-in products at their restaurants. Cho and Harris (who portrays a fictionalized version of himself) were cast early, whereas Penn attended seven auditions. Principal photography began in 2003, with filming primarily done in Toronto.

&quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle&quot; was theatrically released in the U.S. on July 30, 2004, by New Line Cinema. The film received positive critical reception, with praise for the performances of its leads (particularly Harris) and subversion of racial and comedic stereotypes. The film has gone on to gather a cult following. The sequel, &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay&quot;, was released internationally in April 2008.

==Plot==
Investment banker Harold Lee is persuaded by his colleagues to do their work while they leave for the weekend. Kumar Patel attends a medical school interview, but intentionally botches it to prevent getting accepted. Harold is attracted to his neighbor, Maria, but is unable to express his feelings. After smoking marijuana with Kumar, and seeing an advertisement for White Castle, the pair decide to get hamburgers. After traveling to the nearest White Castle in New Brunswick, they find it replaced by &quot;Burger Shack&quot; but learn of another White Castle in Cherry Hill.

Kumar suggests stopping at Princeton University to buy more marijuana. Kumar buys marijuana from a student and they are discovered by campus security and forced to flee, losing their marijuana. Harold and Kumar resume their drive, and Kumar pulls over to urinate. A raccoon gets in the car and bites Harold. Kumar takes Harold to a hospital where Kumar&#x27;s father and older brother work. Kumar steals ID badges to obtain medical marijuana, but after being mistaken for his brother, Kumar performs surgery on a gunshot victim and, after the surgery, the patient tells them how to reach White Castle.

Kumar spots Maria at a movie theater. He decides to get her attention so Harold can talk to her, but Harold panics and crashes the car. They are rescued by Freakshow, a tow-truck driver, who takes them to his house to repair their car. Harold and Kumar are propositioned by Freakshow&#x27;s wife, but after Freakshow suggests a foursome, Harold and Kumar flee in disgust. Kumar picks up a hitchhiker, Neil Patrick Harris, who is high on ecstasy. Harold and Kumar go into a convenience store to get directions and Harris drives away. The duo are then harassed by a racist police officer for jaywalking. Harold attempts to punch Kumar for escalating the encounter with the officer, but ends up punching the officer instead, resulting in his arrest.

Kumar fakes a 911 call to draw the police away and breaks into the station to free Harold. Harold and Kumar flee. The pair encounters an escaped cheetah, and after smoking marijuana with it, they ride it. After encountering a group of extreme sports punks who have been harassing the pair, Harold and Kumar steal their truck. A police officer spots the speeding truck and chases them. They are trapped when they reach the edge of a cliff. Spotting the White Castle below, Harold and Kumar use a hang glider from the truck to reach their destination. The pair place their orders but are disheartened to find they have no money. Harris suddenly appears, and pays for their meal as an apology for stealing their car.

Kumar realizes he wants to be a doctor, but is afraid of conforming to the stereotype of Indians becoming doctors. Harold notices his co-workers pull up with two women and gets angry at them because they said they had to work with clients but were actually out partying. He tells them off and threatens to get them fired and humiliated if it happens again. After returning to their apartment they encounter Maria. Harold professes his feelings for her and they kiss. She informs Harold that she is leaving for Amsterdam but will return in ten days. Kumar convinces Harold to go with him to Amsterdam to pursue Maria, reminding him that marijuana is legal in the Netherlands.

==Cast==

==Production==
While living in Los Angeles, screenwriters Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg decided to write a low-budget stoner film and base the main characters on their high school friends from Randolph High School. They based the character of Harold on their real-life friend Harold Lee. Hurwitz got the idea to base the film around White Castle from his own experience craving White Castle burgers when he lived in Pennsylvania for several years. At the time, Pennsylvania did not have any White Castle locations and Hurwitz had to have family members bring him frozen White Castle burgers from New Jersey.

The filmmakers received permission from White Castle in 2002 to use the chain&#x27;s name in the film. One scene that depicted a White Castle being closed was changed at the request of the company&#x27;s director of marketing.

Despite receiving top billing, Kal Penn revealed that he and John Cho did not get a big paycheck from the movie, with each only receiving a gross salary of $75,000 before numerous deductions to which Penn explained, &quot;You deduct your taxes, 10% to your agent, 15% your manager, 5% to your lawyer, your publicity fees, and then your rent...And it averages out to probably about five-and-a-half months of living expenses once you&#x27;ve paid everybody and paid your taxes.&quot; Penn said that a working actor was likely to keep &quot;maybe 30% of your paycheck&quot; after paying taxes and service fees; his work from the movie left him with about $22,500 from his earnings.
===Casting===
Hurwitz and Schlossberg included a role for Neil Patrick Harris as himself in the script without asking him first. Harris liked the script and agreed to appear in the film. Ralph Macchio was the backup choice if Harris declined. Hundreds of actors auditioned for the title roles. They also approached John Cho and Kal Penn to try out the parts who were initially skeptical about the project. During casting, both Penn and actor Sendhil Ramamurthy were being considered for the role of Kumar. After auditioning seven times, Penn eventually won the part. The role of Harold was between either Cho and Bobby Lee. Ryan Reynolds agreed to do a cameo in the film after working with Penn on &quot;Van Wilder&quot;.
=== Pre-production ===
The writers, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, said that they were really sick of seeing teen movies that were one-dimensional and had characters who didn&#x27;t look like any of their friends, who were a fairly diverse group. This prompted them to write a film that was both smart and funny and cast two guys who looked like their best friends. They had been putting Harold and Kumar, who were Asian American, into all of their screenplays as the main characters, but had difficulty pitching to studios. &quot;Our logic at the time was like nobody else is writing a stoner comedy about an [East] Asian dude and an Indian dude going to get White Castle,&quot; said Hurwitz, though director Danny Leiner remembered, &quot;Before the casting and trying to get the money before Luke [Ryan, the executive producer] came on, we were going to a couple of the studios and one was like, &quot;Look, we really love this movie. Why don&#x27;t we do it with a white guy and a black dude?&quot; John Cho mentioned the writers wanted to avoid whitewashing the main leads, so they wrote ethnic-specific scenes in the script. Cho recalled, “It had to be rooted in that as a defense mechanism so that they wouldn’t get turned white.&quot; Schlossberg commented, &quot;There had never been an Asian character without an accent except for [Cho] as the MILF guy. A lot of people read the script and just assumed they might be foreign exchange students, so you really had to emphasize that these guys were born in America. It was a totally different world.&quot;

Kal Penn stated that the reason the movie was greenlit was because there were two junior execs at New Line Cinema who were given this new project and decided to take a chance on it. Penn explained, &quot;The older people around Hollywood, the older people in town were like, &#x27;We don&#x27;t know if America is ready for two Asian American men as leads in a comedy.&#x27;&quot;

A few days before shooting the movie, Cho knocked on Penn&#x27;s door and told him, &quot;If we&#x27;re supposed to be best friends, we&#x27;d better start hanging out together.&quot; They went to get a beer together and under artificial conditions, began a real friendship.

===Filming===
&quot;Harold &amp; Kumar&quot; began filming on May 12, 2003. The film is set in New Jersey, but was mainly filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Scenes set at Princeton University were actually filmed at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Victoria College and Knox College. The production design team had to build a White Castle franchise especially for the shoot since Canada does not have White Castle restaurants. During filming, Penn ate veggie burgers as he is a vegetarian.

==Release==

===Marketing===
In the 11 days before the film&#x27;s release, New Line Cinema turned a parking lot on Sunset Strip into a temporary White Castle. The restaurant served 40,000 burgers to patrons, including Quentin Tarantino, Farrah Fawcett and Jay Leno.

White Castle launched several promotions in tandem with the film&#x27;s release. The restaurant chain featured beverage cups with pictures of Harold and Kumar. They also provided free hamburgers to moviegoers attending the film&#x27;s premiere. Cho and Penn were inducted into the company&#x27;s White Castle Cravers Hall of Fame in 2004.

===Box office===
In its opening weekend, the film grossed $5,480,378 in 2,135 theatres in the United States and Canada. In total, it had a worldwide gross of $23,936,908 on a $9 million budget.

===Critical reception===
The film was positively received by critics, with a 74% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 148 reviews; the consensus states, &quot;The likable leads and subversion of racial stereotypes elevate Harold and Kumar above the typical stoner comedy.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 64 out of 100 based on 29 reviews from critics, indicating &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote &quot;One secret of fiction is the creation of unique characters who are precisely defined. The secret of comedy is the same, with the difference being that the characters must be obsessed with unwholesome but understandable human desires.&quot;

==Home media==
The &quot;Extreme Unrated&quot; edition of the DVD was released on January 4, 2005. It includes special features like a mockumentary, &quot;The Art of the Fart&quot;, &quot;The Backseat Interview&quot;, an interview with Cho and Penn, and a making-of featurette about the Land of Burgers animated segment. The DVD also features two commentaries: one by writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg and one by actor Dan Bochart in character as Extreme Sports Punk #1.

Although the movie was not successful in theaters, New Line told the producers that they were doing &quot;three or four times the business on DVD that one would expect based on the box office.&quot;

The film was re-released on DVD in 2007 and a remastered edition was released in 2008. The film was released on Blu-ray on November 13, 2012.

As of August 17, 2008, the film had 2,878,770 DVD sales in the United States, grossing $30,609,751.

==Sequels==
&quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay&quot; is the 2008 sequel to &quot;White Castle&quot;. The movie revolves around Harold and Kumar trying to get to Amsterdam to find Maria, but when the two are mistaken for terrorists on the plane, they are sent to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

Both Hurwitz and Schlossberg announced plans to write a third &quot;Harold and Kumar&quot; film, with Greg Shapiro returning as producer, and Kal Penn and John Cho returning in their title roles, while Todd Strauss-Schulson directed the film. &quot;A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas&quot; was released on November 4, 2011, in 2D and 3D.

<text>Herman Kristoffersen (born 24 August 1947) is a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party. He is known as a former mayor of Tromsø.

Kristoffersen was elected mayor in 1999, and again in 2003. In 2003 however, he had to form a coalition with the Socialist Left Party in order to take office. Kristoffersen did not stand for re-election in 2007. He was succeeded by Arild Hausberg of the same party.

Kristoffersen is popularly known as &quot;Red Herman&quot; reflecting his former involvement in the Workers&#x27; Communist Party and the Red Electoral Alliance.

<doc id="873475" wikidata="Q3347061" url="?curid=873475" title="Neo-Victorian">
<text>Neo-Victorianism is an aesthetic movement that features an overt nostalgia for the Victorian period.

==In arts and crafts==
Examples of crafts made in this style would include push-button cordless telephones made to look like antique wall-mounted phones, CD players resembling old time radios, Victorianesque furniture, and Victorian era-style clothing.

In neo-romantic and fantasy art, one can often see the elements of Victorian aesthetic values. There is also a strongly emerging genre of steampunk art. McDermott &amp; McGough are a couple of contemporary artists whose work is all about a recreation of life in the nineteenth century: they only use the ultimate technology available, and since they are supposed to live anachronistically, this means the use of earlier photographic processes, and maintaining the illusion of a life stuck in the ways of a forgotten era.

===Works of fiction===
Neo-Victorian works of fiction are creative narrative works set in the Victorian period, but written, interpreted or reproduced by more contemporary artists.

Many neo-Victorian novels have reinterpreted, reproduced and rewritten Victorian culture. Significant texts include &quot;The French Lieutenant’s Woman&quot; (John Fowles, 1969), &quot;Possession&quot; (A. S. Byatt, 1990), &quot;Arthur and George&quot; (Julian Barnes, 2005), &quot;Dorian, An Imitation&quot; (Will Self, 2002) &quot;Jack Maggs&quot; (Peter Carey, 1997), &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; (Jean Rhys, 1966).
Recent neo-Victorian novels have often been adapted to the screen, from &quot;The French Lieutenant’s Woman&quot; (Karel Reisz, 1981) to the television adaptations of Sarah Waters (&quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;, BBC2, 2002, &quot;Fingersmith&quot;, BBC1, 2005, &quot;Affinity &quot; ITV, 2008) and Michel Faber (&quot;The Crimson Petal and the White&quot;, BBC 1, 2011). These narratives may indicate a of neo-Victorianism, and have been called &quot;in-yer-face&quot; neo-Victorianism (Voigts-Virchow).

Recent productions of neo-Victorianism on screen include Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes films and TV series such as &quot;Sherlock&quot;, &quot;Ripper Street&quot;, &quot;Whitechapel&quot;, &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; and &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot;. The neo-Victorian formula can be expanded to include Edwardian consumer culture (&quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, &quot;The Paradise and Mr Selfridge&quot;).

==In dress and behaviour==

Many who have adopted Neo-Victorian style have also adopted Victorian behavioural affectations, seeking to imitate standards of Victorian conduct, pronunciation, interpersonal interaction. Some even go so far as to embrace certain Victorian habits such as shaving with straight razors, riding penny farthings, exchanging calling cards, and using fountain pens to write letters in florid prose sealed by wax. Gothic fashion sometimes incorporates Neo-Victorian style.

Neo-Victorianism is embraced in, but also quite distinguished from, the Lolita, Aristocrat and Madam fashions popular in Japan, and which are becoming more noticeable in Europe.

==Social conservatives==
Neo-Victorian aesthetics are also popular in the United States and United Kingdom among cultural conservatives and social conservatives. Books such as &quot;The Benevolence of Manners: Recapturing the Lost Art of Gracious Victorian Living&quot; call for a return to Victorian morality. The term Neo-Victorian is also commonly used in a derogatory way towards social conservatives.

Many of the things that seem commonplace in modern life began in the Victorian era, such as sponsorship, sensational journalism and popular merchandise.

==Research==
In September 2007, The University of Exeter explored the phenomenon in a major international conference titled &quot;Neo-Victorianism: The Politics and Aesthetics of Appropriation&quot;. Academic studies include &quot;Neo-Victorianism: The Victorians in the Twenty-First Century, 1999–2009&quot;.

Other foundational texts of neo-Victorian criticism are Kucich and Sadoff (2000), Kaplan (2007), Kohlke (2008-), Munford and Young (2009), Mitchell (2010), Davies (2012), Whelehan (2012), Kleinecke-Bates (2014), Böhm-Schnitker and Gruss (2014), Tomaiuolo (2018), and others.

==In popular culture and literature==
Neo-Victorianism can also be seen in the growing steampunk genre of speculative fiction and in music performers such as Emilie Autumn. Neo-Victorianism is also popular with, and in many ways prefigured by, those who are interested in Victoriana and historical reenactment.

Neo-Victorian details appear in &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; by Neal Stephenson, in which Neo-Victorians are one of the main groups of protagonists.

Carnival Diablo is a Neo-Victorian circus sideshow that has been touring North America for 20 years.

Unhallowed Metropolis is a roleplaying game based in a Neo-Victorian setting.

<doc id="873477" wikidata="Q7068333" url="?curid=873477" title="Nude (VAST album)">
<text>Nude is the third studio album by the band VAST, released on Carson Daly&#x27;s independent label 456 Entertainment. It was released on February 24, 2004. The album is made up of remastered and remixed demos from the online &quot;Turquoise &amp; Crimson&quot; releases.

A &quot;European version&quot; of the album was also released, which includes two bonus tracks and a sixteen-page booklet housed in a cardboard slipcase. The bonus tracks included are &quot;Falling from the Sky&quot; (as track 13) and &quot;I Woke Up L.A.&quot; (as track 14).

With the release of &quot;Turquoise &amp; Crimson (Retail Version)&quot;, the album was made obsolete, because the double album featured all of the songs on &quot;Nude&quot;, remastered from their unfinished versions released online, and mixed with many new songs. Crosby marketed the album through his own independent label after his unhappiness with 456 Entertainment. He later claimed that releasing &quot;Nude&quot; on 456 Entertainment was a &quot;disaster, and not a very good idea&quot;.

During the promotional phase of the album&#x27;s release, the band played on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; and performed their single &quot;Thrown Away&quot;.

==Reception==

Critical reception was mostly mixed, Allmusic noted that &quot;his faraway vocal choirs and manipulated sound effects have the ability to evoke the unsettled tension that once tinged Lacuna Coil&#x27;s dark electronic experiments...unfortunately these atmospheres deflate in the face of guitar-heavy modern rock appliques,&quot; and giving the album a 2.5 out of 5. The album has recently become a fan favorite and rarity after it was dropped out of print in recent years.

<doc id="873479" wikidata="Q3519335" url="?curid=873479" title="Texas (TV series)">
<text>Texas is an American daytime soap opera that aired on NBC from August 4, 1980 until December 31, 1982, sponsored and produced by Procter and Gamble Productions at NBC Studios in Brooklyn, New York City. It is a spin-off of &quot;Another World&quot;, co-created by head writers John William Corrington and Joyce Hooper Corrington, and executive producer of &quot;Another World&quot; at the time, Paul Rauch. Rauch held the title of executive producer for the parent series and its spin-off until 1981.

==Overview==

===Initial development and debut ===
The Corringtons&#x27; initial concept was for a show set in the antebellum South entitled &quot;Reunion&quot;, but NBC wanted something more in line with the hugely successful CBS primetime soap &quot;Dallas&quot;, which was dominating the ratings. Rauch then chose to have the show revolve around the popular &quot;Another World&quot; character Iris Cory Carrington, played by Beverlee McKinsey. Iris initially set out to visit her grown son Dennis (Jim Poyner), who had relocated from Bay City to Houston. Within a matter of weeks, Iris reconnected and became romantically involved with her first love, Alex Wheeler (Bert Kramer).

A slew of characters debuted on &quot;Another World&quot; in the months prior to August 1980, in the hope that when they eventually moved over to &quot;Texas&quot;, they would have made enough impact with viewers so they would watch &quot;Texas&quot;, too.

The debut episode featured Iris on a plane, leaving Houston after visiting her son Dennis, who had relocated to Texas with his new love to open an art gallery. During her visit, she reconnected with her first love, self-made millionaire Alex Wheeler. Alex is determined not to let the past repeat itself and lose her again. He arranges for the Bay City-bound jet airliner, which Iris is on, to return to Houston.

During the first season of the series, the stories centered around the daily lives of the wealthy Wheelers and Bellmans and the middle-class Marshalls, and their ranching and oil interests.

===The 1981 revamp===
In November 1981, McKinsey left the show, and the secondary characters seen in the first year were given more story. &quot;Texas&quot; lost one million viewers upon McKinsey&#x27;s departure. While &quot;Another World&quot;, which also lost a million viewers upon her 1980 departure, could afford the drop in ratings, &quot;Texas&quot; could not, and its days were numbered. To try to appeal to the younger audience, the show rechristened itself &quot;Texas: The New Generation&quot;.

In the daytime ratings for 1980-1981 season, &quot;Texas&quot; achieved a 3.8, tied with &quot;The Doctors&quot; at the 12th position. Its time slot contenders &quot;Guiding Light&quot; had an 8.2 rating, fourth position in the ratings, as opposed to an 11.4 rating for &quot;General Hospital&quot;, which was the top-rated serial for the 1980-1981 season. In its second season, the series fell to a 3.6 rating. At the end of its broadcast season, it ended with a 2.7 rating, in the 12th position out of 14 daytime serials. According to A.C. Neilsen, the total viewers for the first two seasons was at 2.8 million, followed by a drop to 2.2 million in the final season.

Simultaneously, &quot;Texas&quot; aired on CTV in Canada at the 3:00 pm ET slot following &quot;Another World&quot;, which had also aired on CTV since the early 1970s. The series was immensely popular in Canada, topping the BBM daytime ratings charts for many weeks. Beverlee McKinsey vacationed often in Nova Scotia during her tenure on both shows, according to numerous soap-opera sources. After NBC moved &quot;Texas&quot; to 11:00 am in April 1982, CTV opted not to follow suit, and continued airing &quot;Texas&quot; at its original timeslot of 3:00 pm (ET). In addition, Canadian viewers who either lived near the border and had access to NBC terrestrial affiliates or a cable TV subscription had the option of viewing the series mornings or afternoons, respectively.

A popular storyline at the end of 1981 called Hitopah involved numerous characters in adventurous settings and intriguing circumstances to locate Sutars Rock, which nonetheless offered comic relief provided by good friends Ruby and Lurleen. Hitopah was about an ancient Indian artifact called the Fire Compass that was covered with runes and which Ruby&#x27;s boyfriend Beau Baker opened. The opening of the Fire Compass released a toxic gas that turned Beau instantly into a mummy. Then, following some comedic hijinks with Lurleen and Ruby attempting to get rid of the body and make sense of the situation, Gretchen tried to get part of the Fire Compass back from them, leading to a chase to find the secret underground chambers in Hitopah (which contain a huge quantity of petroleum), towards which the Fire Compass is supposed to guide the owner.

===Special guests===
Musical artists were featured on &quot;Texas&quot; to focus and contribute to some of the characters&#x27; storyline, such as siblings Elena and Rikki Dekker both venturing into the musical careers, although short-lived. Almost all serials in the 1980s had notable musical artists appearing on their respective shows, with some of the characters playing rising musical artists, and &quot;Texas&quot; was no exception, The character of Rikki Dekker (played by Randy Hamilton) gave his rendition of Luther Ingram&#x27;s R&amp;B hit, &quot;(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don&#x27;t Want to Be Right&quot;, and notable country music singers of the 1970s and 1980s such as Johnny Paycheck, Tom T. Hall, and Ray Stevens all made appearances as themselves at venues, mostly at the Coop, on the series.

In addition, politicians also made appearances, such as Oklahoma Governor George Nigh and his wife Donna. They appeared in walk-on roles (playing themselves as governor and first lady of Oklahoma) during the show&#x27;s first month on the air; cast member Lisby Larson (Paige Marshall) serenaded the couple with a rendition of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. Also, while he never appeared on the actual series, Texas Lieutenant Governor William P. Hobby, Jr., took a tour of the program&#x27;s Brooklyn studio, and praised the show&#x27;s realistic visual feel.

===Final episodes===
The last episodes featured a Christmas miracle (snow fell in Houston as Long&#x27;s character Ashley and her unborn baby, who had been presumed dead after a flash flood, returned home to loving husband Justin) and a New Year&#x27;s series finale where the local TV station was bought out and all the major characters were fired. The final scene was a bittersweet, final toast, &quot;To Texas!&quot;. (They weren&#x27;t the only ones out of work: &quot;The Doctors&quot; also aired its last episode on this day, ending a nearly-twenty year run.)

NBC replaced &quot;Texas&quot; with the game shows &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Hit Man&quot; (the latter of which was cancelled after 13 weeks despite an increase in the network&#x27;s ratings in the 11:30 am timeslot), as well as reruns of 1970s primetime shows.

==Cast and characters==
===Entire run===
===Partial run===
==Broadcast history==

In the run-up to the premiere of &quot;Texas&quot; in the summer of 1980, a handful of characters was introduced on &quot;Another World&quot;, in the hope that once &quot;Texas&quot; began airing on August 4, 1980, the viewers who had become invested would continue watching as Iris Bancroft and these newer characters moved to &quot;Texas&quot;. The premiere of &quot;Texas&quot; came at a time when NBC&#x27;s daytime lineup (consisting of &quot;Another World&quot;, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and &quot;The Doctors&quot;) had fallen into ratings trouble, after a highly successful period in the early and mid-1970s. Given that the show aired from 3:00-4:00 pm (ET), it caused a small domino effect on the NBC daytime schedule: &quot;Another World&quot;, which had become daytime&#x27;s first 90-minute drama 17 months earlier (airing from 2:30-4:00 pm), was scaled back to 60 minutes and aired from 2:00-3:00 pm, and &quot;The Doctors&quot;, which previously aired from 2:00-2:30 pm, now moved to 12:30-1:00.

Due in no small part to the then-peak success of ABC&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot; remained in the bottom echelon of the daytime serial chart with a 3.8 rating, tying with &quot;The Doctors&quot; for last place, 12th, in 1980. However, the show&#x27;s numbers fell gradually after its first year. The struggles of &quot;Texas&quot; also affected the ratings of its mother show, &quot;Another World&quot;, in such a way that the latter show was no longer NBC&#x27;s highest-rated soap. The 1980-1981 season had &quot;Another World&quot; finish with a 5.1 ratings by comparison to a 7.1 during the previous season (1979-1980). In that same season, &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; became the highest-rated serial on NBC.

The show had a very difficult task from the beginning in the ratings for NBC; its 3:00 pm timeslot competitors were ABC&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot;, then the highest-rated daytime soap opera due in large part to the popularity of the Luke and Laura storyline, and CBS&#x27; &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, which had undergone a ratings resurgence due to popular, more youth-oriented stories and characters created by headwriter Douglas Marland. At that time, NBC was third in the ratings. The serial finished with a 3.8 in the ratings for its first year.

Critics complained that Iris Bancroft (who was known on &quot;Another World&quot; as being a villainess) had become too tame in her new environment in Houston, and that other roles were poorly cast or suffered from paper-thin writing. In early 1981, the Corringtons were replaced as head writers. Other casting moves were made with little gain, such as hiring away well established and popular &quot;General Hospital&quot; star Kin Shriner (Scotty Baldwin) in October 1980, at great expense, to be cast as Jeb Hampton, only to give him almost nothing to do except as a supporting role until he finally departed the series in August 1981.

In addition to popular Shriner, veteran actor Jay Hammer, who had a notable credit role as Allan Willis during the 1978–1979 season on the primetime CBS sitcom &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, replaced Chandler Hill Harben in February 1981 as Max Dekker. The character was paired off with Carla Borelli&#x27;s character, Reena Bellman Cook. They both brought charisma to the roles, but their storyline was short-lived, as Hammer&#x27;s contract ended, and Max was killed off in a fatal explosion.

===Gail Kobe and Pam Long===
In late 1981, Gail Kobe became executive producer and Pam Long (who appeared on the show as Ashley Linden Marshall) became head writer. The show began to improve in quality, but the ratings remained in the basement due to numerous factors such as losing affiliates due to timeslot rescheduling, contributing to the show&#x27;s cancellation.

After the show ended, Kobe and Long were hired at &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in the same roles. Several Texas actors appeared shortly after Long began writing the show; Jay Hammer, James Rebhorn, Harley Jane Kozak, and Michael Woods were all cast in new roles on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. Long and Kobe also wooed Beverlee McKinsey back to daytime to portray Baroness Alexandra Spaulding Von Halkein, a role she played until 1992.

Other &quot;Texas&quot; actors who appeared on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; after &quot;Texas&quot; ended included Alexandra Neil, Lisby Larson, and Jerry Lanning. Long had originally wanted Lanning for the role of Billy Lewis; Lanning eventually took on the role of Cain Harris, who befriended and then stalked the character of Reva Shayne.

===1982===
On April 26, 1982, &quot;Texas&quot; moved to the 11:00 am timeslot. The serial had been at a critical low point in the ratings, and NBC, as part of a reshuffling of its morning lineup and a last-ditch effort to save the show, opted for this late-morning move, which also resulted in a change of timeslot for the hit game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. As part of this shuffle, NBC moved &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; from 11:00 to 10:30, which subsequently resulted in the termination of &quot;Blockbusters&quot; and &quot;Battlestars&quot;.

This move, though, may have exacerbated the ratings problems for &quot;Texas&quot;; although it no longer had to face &quot;General Hospital&quot;, it was now directly against CBS&#x27; hit game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. While &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; had given &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; some competition in the slot, &quot;Texas&quot; was unable to make even the slightest dent against the long-running CBS game. Therefore, NBC cancelled &quot;Texas&quot; and the still-struggling &quot;The Doctors&quot; (which had been bumped up to noon to make room for NBC acquiring CBS&#x27; &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; at 12:30) on December 31, 1982. (Many cancelled serials broadcast their final episode on the last day of the year; &quot;Somerset&quot;, the first spin-off of &quot;Another World&quot;, had aired its finale on the same date in 1976.)

After initially filling the slot with reruns of &quot;CHiPs&quot; for a few months, NBC experimented with other programming in the 3:00 timeslot; two 60-minute game shows occupied the slot over a period of nearly two years. The first of these, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, ran for thirteen months and was replaced by &quot;The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot;. When the latter ended its run in July 1984, &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; premiered in the 3:00 timeslot; aside from running for nine years, it achieved better ratings and critical acclaim than &quot;Texas&quot; ever did. &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; was also the last network program NBC aired in that slot, as NBC returned the hour to its affiliates after the show ended in 1993.

Shortly after the cancellation of &quot;Texas&quot; and &quot;The Doctors&quot;, NBC turned its focus back to game shows and improving the struggling but still higher-rated soaps &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot; in early 1983. The daytime block led off with the Jim Perry-helmed revival of &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; at 10:30 am in January 1983. The 11:00 slot went back to &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, which &quot;Texas&quot; had displaced with its move to the mornings, and the 11:30 slot was filled by &quot;Hit Man&quot;, which introduced audiences to Peter Tomarken. The noon slot, which &quot;The Doctors&quot; previously occupied, was taken by &quot;Just Men!&quot;, hosted by Betty White. Of the shows that premiered that day, &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; lasted until March 1989, but &quot;Hit Man&quot; and &quot;Just Men!&quot; each lasted only 13 weeks.

===Beverlee McKinsey===
&quot;Texas&quot; was used as a starring vehicle for Daytime Emmy-nominated Beverlee McKinsey, whose &quot;Another World&quot; character of Iris Carrington, penned in 1972 by Harding Lemay on the mother show as the rich, spoiled daughter of publishing magnate Mackenzie Cory, was made the focal point of the series. The series was retooled from its initial conception to focus on McKinsey&#x27;s character as its leading lady.

McKinsey was given the distinction of having a starring credit on the opening of the show. Narrator Ken Roberts announced at the end of the theme song, &quot;&quot;Texas&quot;, starring Beverlee McKinsey,&quot; and a still image of McKinsey was shown. However, she left &quot;Texas&quot; 16 months after its debut.

&quot;Texas&quot; was also the first daytime soap opera to air hour-long episodes from its inception, as all the other hour-long soaps airing at the time had expanded from 30 minutes. Noteworthy, the multiple Emmy Award-winning &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, which took over the former &quot;Texas&quot; time slot in 1984, also premiered with hour-long episodes. &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; managed to achieve more critical acclaim and slightly higher ratings during its -year run.

==Repeats==
Soon after &quot;Texas&quot; was cancelled, TBS began airing the show in a weekday morning timeslot in a 30-minute format. These airings were paired with a new half-hour soap, &quot;The Catlins&quot;, which was one of the few made-for-cable soaps.

In 2006, Procter and Gamble began making several of its soaps available, a few episodes at a time, through America Online&#x27;s AOL Video service, downloadable free of charge. Reruns of &quot;Texas&quot; episodes began with the show&#x27;s first episode from August 4, 1980.

As of January 1, 2009, Procter and Gamble announced that &quot;Texas&quot; and three other of its cancelled soap operas would no longer be streamed on AOL Video. The notice referred to exploring other options to make the shows available for viewing. The last &quot;Texas&quot; episode made available through AOL Video was #339, which originally aired on December 4, 1981. Additionally, numerous clips of the show are available on the video-sharing site YouTube.

Five episodes are known to be missing so far:
* Episode #47 dated October 7, 1980, posted at AOL is the same as episode #24 and it seems to be either missing or was somehow mislabeled.
* Episode #203 dated May 21, 1981
* Episode #245 dated July 21, 1981
* Episode #247 dated July 23, 1981
* Episode #288 dated September 18, 1981

Episodes 78–163 were once available at AOL, but removed sometime in spring 2008. Although episodes 1–77 are still available through the WMV stream URLs, AOL has completely removed the embedded player pages at the website.

<doc id="873488" wikidata="Q5549444" url="?curid=873488" title="OOPic">
<text>The OOPic is an Object Oriented Programmable Integrated Circuit. Created by Savage Innovations, this PIC microcontroller comes with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that supports programming in syntaxes based on the BASIC, Java and C programming languages.

The last three versions released to market were the OOPic-R, the OOPic-S and the OOPic-C, which is a miniature version of the former. The oldest model is the OOPic I, which uses the A.2 version of the firmware.

==Architecture==

The OOPic firmware defines numerous built-in &quot;objects,&quot; which can provide custom methods and properties. The objects may be wrappers for hardware, such as an external infrared sensor or a built-in LED, or logic helpers, such as dividers or logic gates.

The OOPic also makes use of &quot;virtual circuits,&quot; where the programmer can create links between object properties.

==Example program==
The following is an example piece of code written in the BASIC syntax, which links a built-in clock that cycles every 1 Hz to an LED.
&#x27; The LED is defined as a single I/O line
Dim Red As New oDio1

&#x27; Here we create a virtual wire. Wires are
&#x27; used to link output or flag values to
&#x27; input values.
Dim W As New oWire

&#x27; All OOPic programs need to define a &quot;main&quot; sub-routine.
&#x27; This is what will be run when the OOPic is turned on.
Sub Main()
 &#x27; Here we specify the pin number for the I/O line.
 &#x27; The onboard red LED is on pin 7.
 Red.IOLine = 7

 &#x27; The LED can also be used for a button, so we need
 &#x27; to specify whether we wish to read from or write to
 &#x27; the pin.
 &#x27; (cvOutput is a constant value)
 Red.Direction = cvOutput

 &#x27; Now we can set up the wire link!
 &#x27; For the wire&#x27;s input, we wish to use the built-in
 &#x27; 1Hz timer.
 W.Input.Link(OOPic.Hz1)

 &#x27; Now we send the output of the wire to the LED.
 &#x27; Note that we actually send it to the &quot;Value&quot;
 &#x27; property of the LED, as this is what determines
 &#x27; whether the LED is lit.
 W.Output.Link(Red.Value)

 &#x27; All that&#x27;s left to do is to tell the wire to
 &#x27; operate, and the OOPic will do the rest!
 &#x27; (cvTrue is a constant value)
 W.Operate = cvTrue

End Sub
This virtual circuit behaviour gives the programmer considerable control and flexibility, and allows for better reaction to real-time behaviours thanks to &quot;Events&quot;. The OOPic actually spends the majority of its time updating the virtual circuits, compared to looping through a user&#x27;s code, so it&#x27;s in the programmers best interest to use virtual circuits over traditional programming techniques as often as possible.

==Other meanings==

OOPIC also refers to Object Oriented Particle In Cell which is an object-oriented implementation, written at Berkeley, of a specific method of plasma physics simulation known as particle in cell.

<text>George Clair Tooker, Jr. (August 5, 1920 – March 27, 2011) was an American figurative painter. His works are associated with Magic realism, Social realism, Photorealism, and Surrealism. His subjects are depicted naturally as in a photograph, but the images use flat tones, an ambiguous perspective, and alarming juxtapositions to suggest an imagined or dreamed reality. He did not agree with the association of his work with Magic realism or Surrealism, as he said, &quot;I am after painting reality impressed on the mind so hard that it returns as a dream, but I am not after painting dreams as such, or fantasy.&quot; In 1968, he was elected to the National Academy of Design and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Tooker was one of nine recipients of the National Medal of Arts in 2007.

== Early life==
George Tooker was born on August 5, 1920, in Brooklyn, New York where he spent the first six years of his life. He was raised by his mother, Angela Montejo Roura, who was of English, German and Spanish-Cuban descent and his father George Clair Tooker who was of English and French descent. His religious upbringing was in the Episcopal Church. During the Great Depression, the family resided in Bellport, New York. He had one sister, Mary Tooker Graham.

He took art lessons as a child and spent much of his young adult life at the Fogg Art Museum. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard University with an English degree in 1942, after which he enlisted in the Officer Candidates School (United States Marine Corps), but was discharged for medical reasons.

==Career==
=== Influences ===
Tooker spent the late 1940s and early 1950s in Brooklyn. He studied at the Art Students League of New York under Reginald Marsh from 1943 to 1945. Kenneth Hayes Miller influenced Tooker&#x27;s work by encouraging the emphasis on form rather than expressive emotion to convey a painting&#x27;s meaning. Tooker regarded Harry Sternberg a good teacher at the League due to his pointed, challenging questions. Upon reading Daniel V. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Practice of Tempera Painting&quot;, Tooker began to paint in the traditional Renaissance painting method. Tooker appreciated its slow manner of application in particular.

Tooker acknowledged the need for other art to support his development process. He spent much of his free time reading painting and sculpture books, studying the works of antiquity up to 20th-century art in an effort to augment his artistic vision. He was particularly interested in Classical sculpture, Flemish painting and sculpture, Italian Renaissance painting and sculpture, Dutch Golden Age painting, 17th-century French art, Neue Sachlichkeit art, and Mexican art of the 1920s and 1930s. Some individuals that influenced Tooker include Italian artists Paolo Uccello and Piero della Francesca; American artists Jared French, Edward Hopper, Paul Cadmus, Honoré Desmond Sharrer, and Henry Koerner.

Early in his career, Tooker&#x27;s work was often compared with painters such as Andrew Wyeth, Edward Hopper, and his close friends Jared French and Paul Cadmus.

=== Artistic career ===
His most well-known paintings carry strong social commentary, and are often characterized as his &quot;public&quot; or &quot;political&quot; pieces. Some of these include: &quot;The Subway&quot; (1950), &quot;Government Bureau&quot; (1955-1956), &quot;The Waiting Room&quot; (1956-1957), &quot;Lunch&quot; (1964), &quot;Teller&quot; (1967), &quot;Waiting Room II&quot; (1982), &quot;Corporate Decision&quot; (1983), and &quot;Terminal&quot; (1986). These works are particularly influential, because they draw from universal experiences of modern, urban life. Many portray visually literal depictions of social withdrawal and isolation. Modernity&#x27;s anonymity, mass-production, and fast pace are cast under an unforgiving, bleak, shadow-less light that conveys a sense of foreboding and isolation. The use of many strong straight lines culminates in oppressively ordered, rectilinear architecture. This precise geometric architecture, constructed to serve the subjects, physically dominates them. Tooker saw modern society as behaving in this same way. Modern life becomes a prison of soulless ritual devoid of individuality in &quot;Landscape with Figures&quot; (1966). Space is often compressed, as in &quot;Ward&quot; (1970-1971), with patients&#x27; beds lined head-to-foot with very little walking space, such that humanity is confined to strictly organized grids. These images convey a sense of overwhelming silence in the lack of control each individual portrayed has over their depicted situation. The people Tooker depicts are rarely overcome by emotion, never strut, and seldom convey individuality. Rather, they shuffle along in heavy, uniform clothing and seem to act not based on individual will, but based on social conditioning. In &quot;Supermarket&quot; (1973), nondescript shoppers are surrounded by brightly packaged consumables as easily replicated as the people themselves.

While Tooker&#x27;s &quot;public&quot; imagery is hostile and solemn, his &quot;private&quot; images are often more intimate and positive. Some of these include the ten images of the &quot;Windows&quot; series (1955-1987), &quot;Doors&quot; (1953), &quot;Guitar&quot; (1957), &quot;Toilette&quot; (1962), and the &quot;Mirror&quot; series (1962-1971). Many of these images juxtapose beauty and ugliness, youth and age, in the analysis of the female body. The space is often compressed by a curtain or close-up wall, so that the viewer is confronted by the symbolic identity of the protagonist. Paper lanterns are also a common motif in Tooker&#x27;s &quot;private&quot; works, often being shared amongst individuals, beacons of soft, warm light that present a pleasant mood to the entire scene. See &quot;Garden Party&quot; (1952), &quot;In the Summer House&quot; (1958), and &quot;Lanterns&quot; (1986). Tooker&#x27;s style of person is notably recognizable. Often they resemble skeletons and seem frozen in time and space, though certainly not flat. See &quot;Divers&quot; (1952) or &quot;Acrobats&quot; (1950-1952). Even as the people depicted in these images are more individualized than those of the &quot;public&quot; pieces, people in a single image are often depicted as variations of the same face, with similar hair colors and physical features that unify and highlight commonalities.

Even these &quot;private&quot; images held social commentary. &quot;Voices I&quot; (1963) depicts two men, physically identical, separated by a thin door yet unable to communicate. He was deeply concerned with the apparent failure to understand and communicate within American society. While Tooker&#x27;s figures&#x27; facial expressions are rarely particularly emotional, these images carry heavy emotional tones, through the gestures, symbolism, and lighting. See &quot;Door&quot; (1969–70), &quot;Man in the Box&quot; (1967), and &quot;Night I&quot; (1963).

He also created religious works. His elaborately painted seven-panel piece &quot;The Seven Sacraments&quot; is located in his local church in Windsor, Vermont. &quot;Supper&quot; (1963) depicts a black man praying over a loaf of bread in front of two white men, easily recognizable as a modern update on the Last Supper. &quot;Girl Praying&quot; (1977), Orant (1977), &quot;Lovers&quot; (1982), and &quot;Embrace II&quot; (1984) are uplifting in their portrayal of genuine spiritual connection. The juxtaposition of emotions in these four images suggest the gravity of spirituality and love for Tooker.

Tooker&#x27;s first exhibition was &quot;Fourteen Americans&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in 1946. In 1974, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco organized a retrospective called &quot;George Tooker: Paintings, 1947-1973.&quot; In 1989, the Marsh Gallery at the University of Richmond held an exhibition dedicated to Tooker. The Addison Gallery of American Art, the National Academy Museum, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Columbus Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art all held exhibitions dedicated to George Tooker. The DC Moore Gallery represents his estate.

Thomas H. Garver, who wrote a monograph on the works of George Tooker wrote, &quot;These are powerful pictures that will stay in the public consciousness. Everyone can say, &#x27;Yes, I&#x27;ve been in that faceless situation,&#x27; even if it&#x27;s just standing in line waiting to apply for a driver&#x27;s license.&quot; His works are particularly impactful because they are so simple and relate to everyday experiences in such a way that the viewer is forced to become more critically aware of their existence.

=== Artistic style ===
In the late 1940s and 1950s, Tooker&#x27;s work was widely appreciated, but fell out of the spotlight when Abstract expressionism gained popularity. For several decades, Tooker painted with little recognition, completing one to three paintings each year. In the 1980s, he was rediscovered and celebrated as one of the most unique and mysterious American painters of the 20th century.

His artistic theory is evident in the quote: &quot;I don&#x27;t really think I&#x27;m a creator. I feel that I&#x27;m a passive vessel, a receptor or translator...The fascinating thing about painting is the discovery.&quot; He methodically mixed his colors by hand, using water, egg yolk, and powdered pigment. Each painting was not only painstakingly executed, but deeply intellectually considered. Tempera is a quick-drying, tedious method of painting that is hard to change after being applied, and this deliberate method suited Tooker&#x27;s disposition and artistic theory. Tooker spent four to six intensely focused hours each day, six days a week, for roughly four months fine-tuning each piece, slowly and deliberately building up color and dimension.

While the themes of his works are simple, the overall impact of each is ambiguous and enigmatic. His works often reveal eerie situations in a mechanical, distancing, and hostile society. These scenes are overlaid with mythical undertones, poetically capturing sensations of dread and unease. The individuals represented are generalized and stripped of detail, with mask-like faces. They often blend sexual and racial features, so they appear more symbols of human beings than actual, unique human individuals. They appear overwhelmed by their environment and clothing, unable to take control of their existence.

Themes his works focus on include love, death, sex, grief, aging, alienation, and religious faith. He devoted numerous paintings to a single theme, investigating many possible variations to fully express the complex ideas conveyed. Tooker grew up in an affluent family, and his work reflects both his privilege and his empathy for those with less.

==Personal life==
Tooker was in a relationship with the artist Paul Cadmus from 1944-1949 and was a part of the PaJaMa artists collective during that time. He is featured, often nude, in many of their images from that period. In the mid-1950s Tooker met his long time partner, painter William R. Christopher, and they lived together in New York City. They moved into a house they had built in Hartland, Vermont in 1960. The couple were involved in the Civil Rights Movement and participated in one of the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965. He taught at the Art Students League of New York from 1965 to 1968. He spent his winters in Málaga, Spain. A few years after Christopher&#x27;s 1973 death, Tooker converted to Catholicism. His faith was very important to him, as he was very much involved with his local church. Tooker died at the age of 90 in his Hartland, Vermont, home due to kidney failure.

<doc id="873505" wikidata="Q131486" url="?curid=873505" title="Acoelomorpha">
<text>Acoelomorpha is a subphylum of very simple and small soft-bodied animals with planula-like features which live in marine or brackish waters. They usually live between grains of sediment, swimming as plankton, or crawling on other organisms, such as algae and corals. With the exception of two acoel freshwater species, all known acoelomorphs are marine.

== Systematics ==
=== Etymology ===
The term &quot;acoelomorph&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek words (), the &quot;alpha privative&quot;, expressing negation or absence, (), meaning &quot;cavity&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;form&quot;. This refers to the fact that acoelomorphs have a structure lacking a fluid-filled body cavity.

=== Classification ===
The subphylum Acoelomorpha is divided into two classes. There are at least 408 described species, with a majority of these falling within the Crucimusculata infraorder in Acoela.
* Acoela comprise small flattened worms, classified into a dozen families.
* Nemertodermatida comprise millimetre-sized, mostly interstitial worms, distributed into two families.

=== Phylogeny ===
The soft bodies of acoelomorphs and the lack of some of the key bilaterian traits make them difficult to classify. Traditionally, based on phenotypic features, acoelomorphs were considered to belong to the phylum Platyhelminthes, which was long seen as the sister group to all other bilaterian phyla. However, a series of molecular phylogenetics studies at the hinge between the 20th and 21st centuries demonstrated that they are fast-evolving organisms not closely related to platyhelminthes, therefore involving the polyphyly of flatworms.

Actually, Acoelomorpha appeared to constitute a separate, deep-branching phylum, kingpin of bilaterian evolution. Yet their evolutionary affinities remain enigmatic as they might be the sister-group either to all other bilateral animals or to all deuterostomes. Resolving this debate would indicate whether acoelomorphs are simple or simplified. If they are the sister group to Bilateria, it would point to a simple body plan for the first bilaterian. Alternatively, if acoelomorphs are related to deuterostomes, this would imply that their organisation is the result of secondary simplification.

In addition, comparative analyses of morphological, developmental, and molecular characters raised two points.
* Xenoturbellida is the sister group to acoelomorphs, constituting the so-called Xenacoelomorpha clade. The close evolutionary relationship between Acoelomorpha and &quot;Xenoturbella&quot; is supported by the morphology (structure of epidermal cilia), the embryology (direct development without a feeding larval stage), and the concatenation of hundreds of proteins.
* The phylogenetic placement of Xenacoelomorpha among bilaterian animals is not yet well defined, despite increased taxon and gene sampling, (re)-analyses of published data sets, and use of more sophisticated models of sequence evolution in phylogenomic studies. There is a conflict between two evolutionary hypotheses, with Xenacoelomorpha being the sister group to Ambulacraria within deuterostomes (i.e., the Xenambulacraria hypothesis) on the one hand, and Xenacoelomorpha as sister group to all other bilaterians (i.e., the Nephrozoa hypothesis) on the other. However, the Nephrozoa hypothesis might reflect methodological errors resulting from model violations in the phylogenomic inference.

== Anatomy ==
Acoelomorphs resemble flatworms in many respects, but have a simpler anatomy, not even having a gut. Like flatworms, they have no circulatory or respiratory systems, but they also lack an excretory system. They lack body cavities (acoelomate structure), a hindgut or an anus.

The epidermal cells of acoelomorphs are unable to proliferate, a feature that is only shared with rhabditophoran flatworms and was for some time considered a strong evidence for the position of Acoelomorpha within Platyhelminthes. In both groups, the epidermis is renewed from mesodermal stem cells.

The nervous system of acoelomorphs is formed by a set of longitudinal nerve bundles beneath the ciliated epidermis. Close to the anterior end, these bundles are united by a ring commissure, but do not form a true brain, although it is hypothesized that such organization was the precursor of the cephalization of the nerve system in more derived bilaterians. After decapitation, such a &quot;brain&quot; (rather, a &quot;cerebroid ganglion&quot;) regenerates in a few weeks.

The sensory organs include a statocyst – which presumably helps them orient to gravity –, and, in some cases, ancestral pigment-spot ocelli capable of detecting light.

Acoelomorphs are simultaneous hermaphrodites, but have no gonads and no ducts associated with the female reproductive system. Instead, gametes are produced from the mesenchymal cells that fill the body between the epidermis and the digestive vacuole.

<text>The Pomeranian Evangelical Church (; PEK) was a Protestant regional church in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, serving the citizens living in Hither Pomerania. The Pomeranian Evangelical Church was based on the teachings brought forward by Martin Luther and other Reformators during the Reformation. It combined Lutheran and Reformed traditions (Prussian Union). The seat of the church was Greifswald, the bishop&#x27;s preaching venue was the former Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas in Greifswald.

In May 2012, the &quot;Pomeranian Evangelical Church&quot; merged with the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg into the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany. The Pomeranian Evangelical Church was a full member of the Protestant Church in Germany (Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland, EKD) between 1950 and 1969 and again from 1991 to 2012, and of the Evangelical Church of the Union between 1950 and 2003, and thereafter of the Union of Evangelical Churches. The church was also a member of the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe. Last bishop was Dr. Hans-Jürgen Abromeit since 2006.

==History==
At the time of the Reformation Pomerania within the Holy Roman Empire (Duchy of Pomerania) consisted of three separate states, the two branch duchies of Pomerania-Stettin (capital: Stettin, renamed as Szczecin as of 1945) and Pomerania-Wolgast (capital: Wolgast) as well as of the secular principality (capital: Kolberg, renamed as Kołobrzeg as of 1945) ruled by the Prince-Bishops of Cammin, who – in Roman Catholic respect – presided over the exempt Roman Catholic Cammin diocese (seat: Cammin, renamed as Kamień Pomorski as of 1945) comprising all the prince-episcopal state, Pomerania-Stettin, parts of eastern Mecklenburg, the New March and much of Pomerania-Wolgast. The latter&#x27;s island Rügen formed part of the Roman Catholic diocese of Roskilde, converted to Lutheranism by the Danish king in 1537, the northern mainland area of Pomerania-Wolgast formed part of the Diocese of Schwerin.

===Reformation and formation of Lutheran state churches===
 On 13 December 1534 the Pomeranian Common Diet in Treptow an der Rega voted in favour of the introduction of Lutheranism in the branch duchies, so in the subsequent years most congregations and parishioners in Cammin diocese converted to Lutheranism. Only in Cammin&#x27;s prince-episcopal state Bishop could defend the Catholic faith. In 1535 the first Lutheran church order (Kirchenordnung; church constitution) for Pomerania was designed by the famous Pomeranian Reformator Johannes Bugenhagen, also called &quot;Doctor Pomeranus&quot;, but was only implemented in 1563. In 1535 the two Pomeranian branch duchies, Pomerania-Wolgast and Pomerania-Stettin, each appointed its own spiritual leader (called general superintendent as of 1563), seated in Greifswald for Pomerania-Wolgast and in Stettin for western Pomerania-Stettin, and, however, subordinate to Stettin, in Stolp (renamed as Słupsk) as of 1945) with subsidiary competence for the eastern part of Pomerania-Stettin.

In 1544 the Cammin diocesan cathedral chapter elected as successor of Manteuffel, becoming the first Lutheran on the Cammin see, however, not confirmed by the Holy See. Suawe then introduced Lutheranism in the prince-episcopal state. His competence as spiritual Lutheran leader, however, was restricted to the prince-episcopal state (Hochstift), everywhere else in the former Cammin diocesan ambit superintendents, appointed by the respective ducal rulers, had taken Lutheran leadership. Protestantism had since been the prevailing Christian denomination in all of ducal and episcopal Pomerania.

The Lutheran churches in the three states of ducal and prince-episcopal Pomerania ranked as state churches. Temporary partitions without share in the Pomeranian governments, such as Pomerania-Barth (1569–1605; ecclesiastically under the general superintendent in Greifswald) and Pomerania-Rügenwalde (1569–1620; ecclesiastically under the superintendent in Stolp till 1604, then Stettin), had no effect on the structure of the two ducal state churches. The Administrators of Cammin prince-bishopric, elected in 1557 and later, lacked theological skills and did not serve as spiritual leaders of the prince-episcopal Lutheran state church any more, but superintendents (Stiftssuperintendenten; i.e. superintendent of the Hochstift) were appointed since 1558. In the same year the Cammin prince-bishopric also established a Lutheran consistory of its own. In 1556 Pomerania-Wolgast had established its own consistory (). Its ambit comprised Pomerania north of the river Randow and west of the rivers Swine and Oder. Between 1575 and 1815 Stralsund, a city in Pomerania-Wolgast, maintained an own consistory for the Lutheran congregations within the city boundary.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) Pomerania fell under Swedish occupation. In 1625 the Wolgast ducal branch was extinct in the male line and bequeathed to Stettin. With the extinction of the Stettin line too in 1637 the electors of Brandenburg inherited Pomerania, however, inhibited by the Swedish occupants. In 1653, after quarrels and negotiations Sweden and Brandenburg partitioned ducal Pomerania into Swedish Pomerania (comprising former Pomerania-Wolgast and the west of former Pomerania-Stettin), and Brandenburgian Pomerania (comprising the former Cammin prince-bishopric and central and eastern parts of former Pomerania-Stettin).

 As to the Lutheran state church of Swedish (Hither) Pomerania it took over the Wolgast-Pomeranian ecclesiastical institutions in Greifswald (consistory and general superintendency), whereas consistory and general superintendency in Stettin were closed down. The Lutheran state church of Brandenburgian (Farther) Pomerania reorganised Cammin&#x27;s consistory as the (till 1668 aka ) and took over the superintendency in Kolberg, elevated to general superintendency. The Pomeranian and Cammin spiritual Consistory, established as Cammin Consistory in 1558 in Cammin&#x27;s capital Kolberg, was seated in that city (1558–1668, and again 1683–1686), in Stargard in Pomerania (1668–1683, and again 1686–1738) and afterwards in Stettin. With the Edict of Potsdam (1685) Huguenots founded Calvinist congregations in Stargard (1687), Stolp and Kolberg (1699). Swedish Pomerania did not allow the immigration of Calvinists.

After in 1713 Swedish Pomerania had ceded Stettin, in 1721 Calvinists founded a congregation there too. With the repeated cessions of Swedish Pomeranian territory to Brandenburgian Pomerania in the early 18th century also the ambit of the general superintendency in Greifswald shrank in favour of that for western Brandenburgian Pomerania. In 1738 the Pomeranian and Cammin spiritual Consistory moved to Stettin, however, due to the distance to remote eastern Farther Pomerania (the Hinterkreise; i.e. farther districts) it opened a subsidiary consistory for the east, the &quot;Farther Pomeranian Consistory of Köslin&quot; (aka ) in 1747. In 1750 the new Superior Consistory in Berlin (Lutherisches Oberconsistorium zu Berlin) became the superior authority for all Lutheran church bodies in Brandenburg-Prussia. The few Reformed (or Calvinist) congregations in Pomerania became subject to the Reformed Church Directorate in Berlin (Reformierte Kirchen-Direction).

===Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania within the Prussian Union of churches===
In 1815 Swedish Pomerania became a pawn in the hands of the powerful, Sweden ceded it to Denmark which passed it on to Prussia in exchange for Saxe-Lauenburg. Swedish Pomerania was renamed as New Hither Pomerania (Neuvorpommern). In 1817 the supreme governor of the Lutheran State Church and the Reformed State Church in Prussia, Frederick William III, initiated the merger of both churches to form the Evangelical Church in Prussia, avoiding in its name the terms Lutheran or Reformed. This new state church, an administratively united umbrella comprising Lutheran, Reformed (Calvinist) and United Protestant congregations, built up regional subdivisions, so-called ecclesiastical provinces (Kirchenprovinzen).

Its &quot;Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania&quot;, comprising congregations within the borders of the Province of Pomerania, consisted of the Lutheran congregations within the state church of former Swedish Pomerania, of the Lutheran congregations previously subject to the Stettin general superintendent under the Lutheran Superior Consistory in Berlin, and of the Reformed (Calvinist) congregations located in Pomerania and previously subject to the Reformed Church Directorate in Berlin.

The King originally intended the merger of locally established Lutheran and Calvinist congregations into congregations of a United Protestant confession, and the adoption of the Union confession by all local congregations without an existing local partner of the other confession to merge with. His intention, however, failed due to strong Lutheran resistance throughout his monarchy, especially among Lutherans in Pomerania and Silesia.

This fight even caused the schism of the Old Lutherans. A number of Lutheran congregations refrained to join the new umbrella or seceded from it in the 1820s and 1830s, forming the independent Evangelical Lutheran Church in Prussia recognised in 1845, which was why the Evangelical Church in Prussia renamed as &quot;Evangelical State Church in Prussia&quot; (Evangelische Landeskirche in Preußen), indicating its privileged status. So finally the merger, not including all congregations, materialised as a mere administrative Union, including in Pomerania mostly Lutheran congregations, the traditionally prevailing denomination, and some few Reformed and United Protestant congregations.

Reformed congregations were usually found in cities or newly established or resettled villages in formerly Brandenburgian Pomerania, where Calvinist immigrants ensconced after 1685. United Protestant congregations usually emerged in cities, where Calvinists and Lutherans lived side by side and disliked the denominational split.

The ecclesiastical province had its headquarters, the 1815-founded Royal [or Evangelical (as of 1918)] and general superintendent, domiciling in Stettin, taken over from the Brandenburgian Pomeranian Lutheran Church, the latter&#x27;s local Köslin Consistory had been dissolved in 1815. The Swedish Pomeranian former Greifswald Consistory and the local were stripped of their competences and dissolved in 1849 and 1815, respectively, the general superintendency in Greifswald was not restaffed after 1824. Since initially the office of general superintendent was not provided as a function in the new Evangelical Church in Prussia at all, the respective offices had not been restaffed when their previous incumbents retired, causing a vacancy. However, since the late 1820s the Evangelical Church in Prussia appointed general superintendents in all its ecclesiastical provinces.

Bismarck&#x27;s church reforms strengthened the autonomy and self-rule of the state church, which in 1875 renamed as &quot;Evangelical State Church of Prussia&#x27;s older Provinces&quot; (Evangelische Landeskirche der älteren Provinzen Preußens), since in Prussian provinces annexed since 1866 their regional Protestant church bodies had remained independent of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia. The reform laws strengthened the parishioners&#x27; participation through elected presbyteries and provincial synods in matters of the Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania. In 1892 the Consistory of Pomerania Province moved into its new building on Elisabethstraße (today&#x27;s ulica Kaszubska in Szczecin). With the end of the the church lost its status as state church and assumed independence. With its new church order and name, &quot;Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union&quot; (as of 1922, Evangelische Kirche der altpreußischen Union; APU), it accounted for these changes.

The parishioners in the congregations elected synodals for their respective provincial synod – the legislative body – which again elected its governing board the &quot;provincial church council&quot; (Provinzialkirchenrat), which also included members delegated by the Evangelical Consistory of Pomerania Province. The consistory was the provincial administrative body, whose members were appointed by the &quot;Evangelical Supreme Church Council&quot; in Berlin, the central administrative body of the old-Prussian Union church. The consistory was chaired by the Stettin general superintendent, being the ecclesiastical, and a consistorial president (German: Konsistorialpräsident), being the administrative leader. In 1921 the Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania was divided into two general superintendencies (Westsprengel and Ostsprengel), the western ambit seated again in Greifswald, the eastern ambit in Stettin. The provincial synods and the provincial church councils elected from their midst the Pomeranian synodals for the general synod, the legislative body of the overall Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union. In 1927 the general synod of the old-Prussian Union church legislated in favour of the ordination of women.

With the Nazi-imposed premature reelection of presbyteries and synods within the old-Prussian church in July 1933 the Nazi-submissive Protestant movement of &quot;German Christians&quot; gained majorities in most Pomeranian presbyteries and the Pomeranian provincial synod, like in most old-Prussian ecclesiastical provinces. In June 1933 the Nazi government of Prussia, ignoring religious autonomy, furloughed the then incumbent general superintendent (western district, seated in Greifswald), whereas his colleague (eastern district, seated in Stettin) retired in October the same year. This allowed the German Christians, dominating the provincial synod, to install their proponent as provincial bishop (Provinzialbischof), combining the ambits of Westsprengel and Ostsprengel, self-aggrandising as &quot;Bishop of Cammin&quot;, claiming Führerprinzip-like authority over all the provincial clergy.

Especially among the many Pomeranian rural Pietists the opposition, forming the Confessing Church movement, found considerable support. Due to the Nazi regime&#x27;s interference causing the violation and de facto abolition of the church order, new bodies emerged such as the provincial bishop (as of 1933) and the provincial ecclesiastical committee (Provinzialkirchenausschuss) since 1935 (dissolved in 1937, presided over by , a member of the Emergency Covenant of Pastors of the Confessing Church), depriving the extremist Thom of his power again in 1936. The provincial ecclesiastical committee provided for the ignoration of Thom, so that the constitutional two general superintendencies could be restaffed. In 1941, following the incorporation of Posen-West Prussia into Pomerania (1938), also the Ecclesiastical Province of Posen-West Prussia was dissolved and its ambit became a part of the Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania. In 1941 about two million of the Pomeranians, then amounting to 2.394 million inhabitants, were parishioners of the Pomeranian ecclesiastical province.

On 22 December 1941 the official new umbrella, the pan-German Evangelical Church, called for suited actions by all Protestant church bodies to withhold baptised non-Aryans from all spheres of Protestant church life. Many &quot;German Christian&quot;-dominated congregations followed suit, whereas confessing congregations in the Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania dared to hand in lists of signatures in protest against the exclusion of the stigmatised Protestants of Jewish descent.

By the East Pomeranian Offensive, February–April 1945, the Red Army advanced so speedily, that there was hardly a chance to rescue refugees, let alone archives of congregations in Farther Pomerania, as was recorded in a report about the situation in the ecclesiastical provinces (10 March 1945). By the end of the war hundred thousands of parishioners and hundreds of pastors were fleeing westwards. The Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania tried to relocate its Stettin-based institutions, the consistory, general superintendency, and pertaining offices, to Greifswald. Between April and July 1945 the Soviets handed over all of Pomerania on both banks along the Oder and east thereof to Poland. Thus the east district (Ostsprengel) dropped into dissolution. With the simultaneous atrocities against and expulsion of the remaining Pomeranians and the systematic suppression of any kind of their organisations and associations the church life in Polish-annexed Pomerania came to an end. Chattel, such as archives and files of the ecclesiastical province and the congregations, could only be partially rescued to places in the west ambit. In August 1945 the three Allies of Potsdam approved these facts and agreed to house and feed the destitute Pomeranians expelled to their zones of occupation.

On the occasion of the first meeting of representatives of Germany&#x27;s persisting Protestant church bodies in Treysa (a part of today&#x27;s Schwalmstadt) on 31 August 1945, the representatives of the six surviving old-Prussian ecclesiastical provinces (March of Brandenburg, Pomerania, Rhineland, Saxony, Silesia, and Westphalia) and the central &quot;Evangelical Supreme Church Council&quot; took fundamental decisions about the future of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union. They decided to assume the independent existence of each ecclesiastical province as Landeskirche (Protestant regional church body) and to reform the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union into a mere umbrella organisation (&quot;Neuordnung der Evangelischen Kirche der altpreußischen Union&quot;). In Treysa the representatives of all Protestant church bodies from Germany founded a new umbrella, the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD).

Most of the parishioners remaining in Polish-annexed Pomerania Province were expelled by Poland in the post-war period of expulsion of Germans between 1945 and 1948. With most of the territory, formerly comprised by the eastern ambit (Ostsprengel) of the Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania, transferred to Poland, it expropriated all church property there, parochial and provincial alike, without compensation, with the church buildings mostly taken over by the Roman Catholic Church, and most Protestant cemeteries desecrated and devastated. The provincial church institutions were built up anew in Greifswald, while the Soviets handed over Stettin, the former seat, to Poland in July 1945.

The majority of the 1.5 million fled and expelled Pomeranian parishioners found refuge outside of the remaining territory of the Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania and thus joined congregations within other Protestant regional church bodies, about 70,000 parishioners perished through war, flight and expulsion. But many stranded also in the west ambit (Westsprengel) with its original 500,000 inhabitants. The situation turned severe with a massive shortage of food and lodgement. However, since the Soviets had decided to keep most of Hither Pomerania, which included the Westsprengel, as part of their occupation zone refugees from Hither Pomerania, fled from there from March to May 1945, could return afterwards and congregational and provincial ecclesiastical structures were rebuilt. However, the position of general superintendent remained vacant after 1945. In October 1946 the 20th Pomeranian provincial synod elected Scheven general superintendent, and allowed him to adopt the new title of bishop.

===Pomeranian Evangelical Church===

The 20th Pomeranian provincial synod, 9–11 October 1946, had also decided to develop a new church order in order to reconstitute the Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania as an independent regional Protestant church body. On 2 June 1950 the Pomeranian provincial synod adopted the prepared new church order and thus established the Pomeranian Evangelical Church, territorially comprising those parts of the former ecclesiastical province located in then East Germany (German Democratic Republic, GDR). By its new constitution its spiritual leader, titled bishop since late 1946, would continue to use that title. The Pomeranian Evangelical Church became a full member of the Protestant Church in Germany and between 1950 and 2003 was a full member of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union, now a mere umbrella. Under communist pressure the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union had to skip the term Prussian from its name and renamed as Evangelical Church of the Union (Evangelische Kirche der Union; EKU) on its general synod in December 1953. In 1956 the Pomeranian church counted 720,000 parishioners, about one third of them with refugee background.

====Evangelical Church in Greifswald====
Following the second constitution of the GDR, enacted on April 9, 1968, and accounting for its de facto transformation into a communist dictatorship, the Council of Ministers of the GDR demoted all church bodies from statutory &quot;Public-law Corporations&quot; () to mere &quot;Civil Associations&quot;. Thus the council could force the Pomeranian Evangelical Church to remove the term &quot;Pomerania&quot; from its name, because East German propaganda silenced about all terms recalling former German territory annexed by Poland or the Soviet Union. The church body then chose the new name &quot;Evangelical Church in Greifswald&quot;.

Along with the status as &quot;Public-law Corporation&quot; the new GDR constitution did away with the church tax, automatically collecting parishioners&#x27; contributions as a surcharge on the income tax. Now parishioners had to fix the level of their contributions and to transfer them again and again on their own. This together with ongoing discrimination of church members, which let many secede from the church, effectively eroded the adherence of parishioners and the financial situation of the Evangelical Church in Greifswald. In 1969 the church body, like all its East German fellows, seceded from the umbrella Protestant Church in Germany and joined the .

====Pomeranian Evangelical Church from 1990 to 2012====
In 1990, after the end of the GDR dictatorship, the church body returned to its former name. With the dissolution of the GDR-Federation of Protestant Churches in 1991 the Pomeranian Evangelical Church reentered the EKD and remained its member until the merger in 2012. The blessing of same-sex unions was allowed. The number of parishioners continued to sink and reached 140,000 in 1997, somewhat more than 20% of the Hither Pomeranian population. On 28 March 2009 the synod voted in the merger with the two Lutheran church bodies of Mecklenburg and North Elbia, by 44 out of 58 synodals. The merger took effect on Pentecost, 27 May 2012.

==Number of parishioners==
==Governors, governing bodies and chairpersons of the church==
Historically the church was subdivided into districts (later called Sprengel in German), partially due to different secular rulers reigning different parts of Pomerania, or partially due to the mere extension of the territory. Thus originally these districts territorially resembled the political subdivisions of Pomerania at the time. Each ecclesiastical district had a consistory and a spiritual leader (usually called general superintendent). At times there were additional subordinate consistories and spiritual leaders with regional competence.

===Supreme governors (1534–1918)===
Between 1534 and 1918 the incumbents of the different Pomeranian thrones were simultaneously Supreme Governors (summus episcopus) of the State Church, like the English monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Since 1532 the ducal House of Griffins was divided into two lines, ruling in partitioned parts of the duchy (Pomerania-Stettin 1532–1637; Pomerania-Wolgast 1532–1620). Furthermore, the third political unit was the Prince-Bishopric of Cammin (1248–1650), a prince-bishopric in parts of Farther Pomerania, ruled by Catholic and later Lutheran bishops of Cammin or by administrators elected by its governing body, the collegial cathedral chapter of Cammin, since the Reformation mostly staffed with Lutheran capitular canons.

Two dependent branch duchies, Pomerania-Barth (1569–1605) and Pomerania-Rügenwalde (1569–1620) were without share in the government, thus also without competence as to the Lutheran state churches. After the extinction of the Griffins in 1637 Pomerania was divided into a Swedish and a Brandenburgian part, where the monarchs of Sweden and the Berlin-based Hohenzollern rulers, respectively, then wielded the summepiscopacy.

<text>The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg (; abbreviated ELLM) was a Lutheran church in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, serving the citizens living in Mecklenburg. The seat of the &quot;Landesbischof&quot; (state bishop) was the state capital Schwerin, with Schwerin Cathedral as the principal church. It is the most important Protestant denomination in this area.

In May 2012, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg merged with the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church and Pomeranian Evangelical Church into the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany.

==History==
The Lutheran church in Mecklenburg dates to the Reformation in the duchies of Mecklenburg, starting with single protagonists in 1523. In 1549, John Albert I, Duke of Mecklenburg gained a majority of deputies of the united Landtag of the separate duchies of Mecklenburg (Mecklenburg-Güstrow, -Schwerin and -Strelitz) to officially introduce the Lutheran confession as the state religion in the duchies. Afterwards the dukes of the branch duchies served as supreme governors of the separate Lutheran churches in the duchies, which later merged to two duchies, Schwerin and Strelitz. 
When the grand dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz abdicated in 1918, the Lutheran state churches became independent. They adopted new church orders providing for a office called state bishop. In 1934, the regional churches merged into the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Mecklenburg.

The ELLM was a full member of the Protestant Church in Germany, the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany (VELKD), the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe, and the Lutheran World Federation. The church was based on the teachings brought forward by Martin Luther and others during the Reformation.

The ELLM merged with the Pomeranian Evangelical Church and the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany in May 2012.

<text>Somerset (sometimes called Another World in Somerset or Another World: Somerset) is an American television soap opera that ran on NBC from March 30, 1970, until December 31, 1976. The show was a spin-off of another NBC serial, &quot;Another World&quot;. The show was created by Robert Cenedella and was produced by Lyle B Hill.

==Overview ==
Initially, the show revolved around Melissa &quot;Missy&quot; Palmer Matthews (Carol Roux), Lahoma Vane Lucas (Ann Wedgeworth) and Sam Lucas (Jordan Charney) and Missy&#x27;s young son Ricky Matthews. These were popular characters who were first seen on &quot;Another World&quot;. They moved to the fictional town of Somerset, not far from the fictional Bay City of &quot;Another World&quot;, which was supposed to be near Chicago, Illinois.

The first stories on the serial revolved around the trio&#x27;s progress in starting new friendships and romantic entanglements. In Somerset, the other families of importance were the Davis family, the Buchanans, the Grants and the Delaneys, who ran Somerset&#x27;s major employer, Delaney Brands. Within six months, Missy was gone and new characters had been added, including a new family, the Kurtzes, and several female characters to act as love interests for Dr. Stan Kurtz and Peter Delaney.

In early 1971, the show changed writers, with Robert Cenedella leaving the show in favor of famed mystery writer Henry Slesar.

Further, &quot;Somerset&quot; slowly moved away from the traditional soap opera format, and started telling stories that dealt heavily with the Mafia and other types of crime, not unlike CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; which Slesar also wrote. After the departure of Slesar, several other writers attempted to bring the show&#x27;s ratings up with varying mixtures of the two previous formats, each of them slowly removing nearly all of the original characters. One of them, Roy Winsor, was the creator of &quot;Search for Tomorrow,&quot; &quot;Love of Life,&quot; and &quot;The Secret Storm.&quot;

The premiere cast included Jason Bernard (as Ricky Matthews), Douglas Chapin (as Tony Cooper), Ralph Clanton (as Jasper Delaney), Nicolas Coster (as Robert Delaney), Len Gochman (as Peter Delaney), Alice Hirson (as Ellen Matthews), Georgann Johnson (as Ellen Bishop Grant),Ed Kemmer (as attorney Dick Grant), Susan MacDonnell (as Jill Grant Farmer), Ron Martin (as David Grant), Wynne Miller (as singer Sandy Buchanan Delaney), Gary Sandy (as Randy Buchanan), Fred J. Scollay (as Harry Wilson aka Ike Harding) Dorothy Stinnette (as Laura Delaney Cooper), Paul Sparer (as Rex Cooper), Philip Sterling (as Rafe Carter), Pamela Toll (as Pammy Davis) and Marie Wallace (as India Bishop Delaney).

The Somerset County Courthouse in Somerville, New Jersey, was used for exteriors.

==Broadcast history==
NBC and packager Procter &amp; Gamble Productions first launched &quot;Somerset&quot; as an extension of the mother show, adding the locales to each program&#x27;s title. They titled the parent program &quot;Another World in Bay City&quot; and the new spinoff &quot;Another World in Somerset&quot;, in the hope that the large loyal following of the mother show, which aired an hour earlier than &quot;Somerset&quot; at 3:00 p.m./2 Central, would stay tuned for several of their favorite characters to appear in a new storyline. By March 1971, NBC shortened the title to simply &quot;Somerset&quot; and reverted &quot;Another World&quot; to its original title, separating the two shows&#x27; identities and eventually phasing out the crossover characters by February 1972. Roux and Wedgeworth did not return to &quot;Another World&quot;; Charney returned to the mother program in July 1973.

Airing in a time slot prone to affiliate pre-exemption (4:00/3:00 Central) caused &quot;Somerset&quot; to struggle throughout the whole of its 6¾-year history to gain a foothold in the daytime pantheon. ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; held the ratings and clearances lead at the time &quot;Somerset&quot; went on the air, but the unpopular &quot;Leviathan&quot; and &quot;Parallel Time&quot; storylines coincided with the premiere of &quot;Somerset&quot;. This enabled NBC&#x27;s new show to push the ratings of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; down considerably, and &quot;Somerset&quot; achieved promising ratings during its first year. &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; had achieved a rating of 7.3 during the 1969-1970 season, but by the end of the 1970-1971 season, &quot;Somerset&quot; had a rating of 7.0 and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; a rating of 5.3. A successful revival of the game show &quot;Password&quot; entered ABC&#x27;s schedule at that slot during the 1970-71 season, and its ratings success cut into the &quot;Somerset&quot; audience. Ratings did improve somewhat during the Slesar period (CBS&#x27; &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; ended a long run against &quot;Somerset&quot;), but after the end of a successful murder storyline in late 1971, the show&#x27;s ratings began to stagnate or decline.

By 1974, the other networks had plugged in surprisingly strong game shows (CBS&#x27; &quot;Tattletales&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot;) at 4:00 p.m. As a result, numerous affiliates began preempting the program in favor of cartoons, syndicated programming (including game shows, sitcom reruns, variety shows or talk shows), old movies, and sometimes locally-produced content. Perhaps the nail in &quot;Somerset&#x27;s&quot; coffin came when ABC acquired &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; from CBS in December 1975 due to CBS&#x27; expansion of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; to an hour in length, itself a response of sorts to NBC eleven months earlier expanding &quot;Another World&quot; to a full hour and its NBC sister soap &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; likewise three months later, with both expansions being successful. ABC placed &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; against &quot;Somerset&quot; in the 4:00 p.m. time slot. Although &quot;Somerset&#x27;s&quot; ratings had improved during its final year, under the guidance of new head writer Robert J. Shaw, they were ultimately not enough to save the program from cancellation. NBC announced the cancellation of the program in the fall of 1976, and the show aired for the 1,710th and final time on New Year&#x27;s Eve. &quot;Somerset&quot;&#x27;s place on the NBC daytime schedule was given to &quot;The Gong Show,&quot; which became a popular-culture phenomenon eventually. The latter series&#x27; timeslot, 12:30 p.m. (11:30 a.m. Central), was given to a new Procter and Gamble-packaged soap, &quot;Lovers and Friends&quot; which would later be retooled into &quot;For Richer, For Poorer&quot;. Both shows fared worse in the ratings than &quot;Somerset&quot;.

&quot;Somerset&quot;, along with ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; and &quot;A World Apart&quot;, marked the last time that more than two American network daytime serials premiered on the same date. Neither of the ABC shows lasted past 1971.

After the final episode aired on December 31, 1976, announcer Bill Woolf read the following message:

<doc id="873514" wikidata="Q3086355" url="?curid=873514" title="The War Machines">
<text>The War Machines is the tenth and final serial of the third season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in 4 weekly parts from 25 June to 16 July 1966.

The serial is set in London in the 1960s, shortly after construction of the Post Office Tower was completed. In the serial, the time traveller the First Doctor (William Hartnell) and sailor Ben Jackson (Michael Craze) work together to stop the self-thinking computer WOTAN (voiced by Gerald Taylor) from invading London with the deadly War Machines controlled by WOTAN.

This serial marks the departure of Jackie Lane as Dodo Chaplet and also the first appearance of Michael Craze and Anneke Wills as new companions Ben and Polly. It is also the only known complete serial to feature Anneke Wills and Michael Craze, and the final complete serial from the William Hartnell era.

==Plot==
The TARDIS lands in London, near the Post Office Tower, where the First Doctor and Dodo meet Professor Brett, the creator of WOTAN (short for Will Operating Thought ANalogue). In four days&#x27; time, WOTAN will be linked to other major computers across the world to take them over, including those of the White House, Cape Kennedy and the Royal Navy.

Dodo goes with Polly, Brett&#x27;s secretary, to the Inferno nightclub, where they meet Ben Jackson, while the Doctor attends a Royal Scientific Club meeting about WOTAN, led by Sir Charles Summer. Before Brett can depart for the meeting, he is hypnotised by WOTAN. He then fetches Krimpton, an electronics colleague, and takes him to WOTAN, where he, too, is possessed by the computer. Major Green, the chief of security in the Tower, is also taken over, and sends WOTAN&#x27;s control signals to Dodo at the nightclub via telephone.

Using its hypnotic control, WOTAN enlists a workforce to construct twelve robotic War Machines around London. One of these machines is built in a warehouse in Covent Garden, close to the Inferno nightclub.

The next day, the Doctor telephones Brett at the Post Office Tower, and is nearly possessed by WOTAN. Thinking the Doctor is now controlled, Dodo reveals that the War Machines are being constructed in strategic points in London. The Doctor breaks WOTAN&#x27;s hypnotic control over her, and she is sent to stay with Sir Charles&#x27;s wife in the country to recover.

The Doctor sends Ben to investigate the area around the nightclub, where he discovers a War Machine, now fully assembled. Ben is detected by the Machine, and caught by the now hypnotised Polly. Ben learns that the War Machines are to attack at noon the next day. He escapes and alerts the Doctor and Sir Charles. Polly is sent back to the Tower to be punished by WOTAN.

Under Sir Charles&#x27;s instruction, an army taskforce investigates the warehouse. They are forced to retreat, but when the Doctor stands before the Machine, it stops—it had not been completely programmed. Soon after, there are reports of another War Machine—Machine 9—taking to the streets. The Doctor traps the Machine in an electromagnetic forcefield and reprogrammes it to destroy WOTAN. Ben goes to the Post Office Tower and drags Polly out of the WOTAN room as the Machine enters and attacks the immobile computer. Krimpton is killed, but WOTAN is destroyed before it can give the order for the other ten War Machines to commence their attack. Brett and all the others who have been hypnotised return to normal.

Ben and Polly meet the Doctor at the TARDIS, to explain that Dodo has decided to stay in London. The Doctor thanks them and heads into the police box—followed by Ben and Polly. They are then suddenly whisked off into time and space.

==Production==
Working titles for this story included &quot;The Computers&quot;. The idea for this story came about when Kit Pedler was being interviewed for a position as science adviser to the series. The producers asked all of the interviewees what would happen if the recently built Post Office Tower somehow took over. Pedler suggested that it would be the work of a rogue computer that communicated with the outside world by means of the telephone system. The producers liked this suggestion and not only offered Pedler the job but developed the idea into a script (one of the few to feature a &#x27;Story Idea by&#x27; credit). Pat Dunlop was then hired to write a full set of teleplays from Pedler&#x27;s idea, but quit after becoming busy with other work, and the teleplays were subsequently done by Ian Stuart Black, who had also written the previous serial, &quot;The Savages&quot;. Only one War Machine prop was actually constructed; the production team changed the numbers, to represent the different machines.

The titling style of each episode in this serial differs from the standard titles of other serials. Instead of a title overlay, after the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; logo has faded, the screen shifts to a solid background containing four inversely coloured rectangles aligned down the left-hand side (reminiscent to an old-style computer punched card). The title, one syllable at a time, scrolls upwards—&quot;THE&quot;, &quot;WAR&quot;, &quot;MACH&quot;, &quot;INES&quot;—with a final flash displaying the complete title on two lines. Another flash reveals the writer, the next flash reveals the word &quot;EPISODE&quot;, and the final flash shows the actual episode number. All of the lettering displayed in this titling sequence is shown in a typeface based on the numeric E-13B font that was then in common use for magnetic ink character recognition. Each of the four episodes&#x27; title sequences have slight variations to them.

The decision to set more episodes on present-day Earth was taken because the producers felt that the audience was becoming bored with the purely historical episodes that had been a major element of the show to date. As a result, this story marks the beginning of the turn away from historical stories. The next two historical stories, &quot;The Smugglers&quot; (which immediately follows &quot;The War Machines&quot;) and Season 4&#x27;s &quot;The Highlanders&quot;, were to be the last purely historical stories until Season 19&#x27;s &quot;Black Orchid&quot;.
This story is also one of the very rare instances where The Doctor is referred to as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; by a character in the story, aside from when intended to be comical.

===Filming===
Filming for &quot;The War Machines&quot; took place in May 1966 at the BBC&#x27;s Ealing Studios, and on location in London in Bedford Square, Bloomsbury, around Fitzrovia, and at Covent Garden market and Cornwall Gardens in South Kensington. Studio recording took place in June and July 1966 at Riverside Studios.

===Casting===
Jackie Lane&#x27;s contract expired midway through production of this story, and as a consequence, Dodo does not appear again after Episode Two. In the final episode, Dodo&#x27;s off-screen departure is relayed to the Doctor by Polly. In addition to playing the part of Ben, Michael Craze also provides the voice of a policeman heard in Episode 4. 

The first three episodes include the credit &quot;and WOTAN&quot;, marking the only time a fictional entity has been credited as itself in the series. Gerald Taylor is credited as the voice of WOTAN in episode 4 only.

&quot;The War Machines&quot; is an early example of the use of real-life news presenters in cameo roles for dramatic effect; the BBC newsreader Kenneth Kendall appears as himself on a television in a pub, and the voice of radio announcer Dwight Whylie is also heard.

Actors in &quot;The War Machines&quot; who subsequently have parts in later &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials are Sandra Bryant and John Harvey, who appear in &quot;The Macra Terror&quot; (1967); John Rolfe, who plays Sam in &quot;The Moonbase&quot; (1967) and Fell in &quot;The Green Death&quot; (1973); and Frank Jarvis, who plays Ankh in &quot;Underworld&quot; (1978) and Skart in &quot;The Power of Kroll&quot; (1978). Mike Reid, who is later known as a comedian and for his role as Frank Butcher in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, appears as an extra.

===Recovery of the missing episodes===

Aside from its soundtrack (recorded off-air by fans), this serial was lost in the junking of episodes in the 1970s. The master videotapes for the story were the last of those starring William Hartnell to be wiped, surviving until March 1974. The 16 mm film telerecording copies held by BBC Enterprises were also the last of their kind to be destroyed, surviving until early 1978, shortly before the junking of material was halted by the intervention of fan Ian Levine. In late 1978, a collector in Australia provided a copy of episode 2. Later in 1984 copies of all four episodes were returned from Nigeria. Episodes 2, 3 and 4 all had cuts to them, but most have been restored due to a combination of the other copy of episode 2, material used in a promotional item on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and censored clips from Australia. Some of the restored footage did not have its accompanying soundtrack, and so the missing sound was restored from the off-air recordings. &quot;The War Machines&quot; is currently the last surviving complete serial from the William Hartnell era; the following serial (&quot;The Smugglers&quot;) is entirely missing, while Hartnell&#x27;s final serial (&quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;) is missing episode 4. Currently, this is the only complete serial featuring Michael Craze and Anneke Wills as Ben and Polly that exists in the BBC archives.

To date, only episodes 3 and 4 do not exist in their entirety as was originally intended. Episode 3 is missing a visual brief bit of dialogue with Krimpton talking. This was replaced in the VHS release with a combination of a shot of WOTAN with the accompanied dialogue from the off-air recordings. Episode 3 is also missing around 59 seconds&#x27; worth of the battle in the warehouse. This scene, however, has not been re-instated for the VHS release as it was felt that there wouldn&#x27;t be enough visual material to drop into the gap. Episode 4 is missing only a small amount of material. The first instance occurs with the man in the telephone box. Part of the continuing close-up of the man talking on the telephone is missing, but this was compensated on the VHS release by continuing in audio-only over the top of the beginning of the high shot of the phone box. There are also two lines of dialogue missing when Polly reports back to WOTAN.

The DVD release has all of the episodes recreated and restored to their original length, as well as a 9-minute documentary showing how the episodes were reconstructed from all the disparate sources.

==Broadcast and reception==
===Critical reception===
In 2009, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; praised the contemporary edge taken with &quot;The War Machines&quot;, though he wrote that the plot was &quot;mechanical&quot; with several improbabilities. DVD Talk&#x27;s J. Doyle Wallis gave &quot;The War Machines&quot; three out of five stars, calling it &quot;serviceable&quot; with WOTAN and its henchmen lacking depth. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; also gave the story three stars, highlighting Hartnell&#x27;s performance and opining that the story &quot;holds up well&quot;, though there were some plot holes. 

Arnold T Blumburg of IGN rated the story 7 out of 10, noting that the concept had aged but it was entertaining. However, he criticised Dodo&#x27;s departure and, while the serial did showcase Hartnell well, he sometimes seemed lost in the setting. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Christopher Bahn, on the other hand, described the plot as &quot;pretty good if not a classic, with an appealing B-movie sensibility—this feels like a better, if equally cheaply made, version of the kind of movie featured on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.&quot; However, he criticised the abrupt departure of Dodo. Johnathan Wilkins of &quot;Dreamwatch&quot; gave the serial a score of 9 out of 10, calling it &quot;something of a forgotten masterpiece&quot;, mostly due to Hartnell&#x27;s performance. However, he noted that the War Machines themselves were &quot;too dull&quot; and &quot;boxy&quot;. In 2013, Ben Lawrence of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named &quot;The War Machines&quot; as one of the top ten &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories set in the contemporary time. 

Writer Brian J. Robb noted that previous &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials had been set either in historical periods on Earth, in the far future or on distant alien worlds, and that &quot;The War Machines&quot; was the first to be set in contemporary 1960s London. Robb regarded the story as significant for belatedly embracing the cultural impact of the Swinging Sixties. He praised the concept of WOTAN using telecommunications to threaten humanity at a time when domestic telephone lines were becoming commonplace, and considered the serial&#x27;s strength to lie in connecting directly with the TV audience by placing menace in a familiar setting. This formula of using a contemporary Earth setting would, he noted, later be repeated in future serials of the Second and Third Doctors. Robb also noted that the theme of sentient machines rising up to subjugate humanity would become a popular trope, comparing &quot;The War Machines&quot; to later films such as &quot;&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984).

Some critics have highlighted WOTAN&#x27;s use of 1960s telecoms technology to create a network of thinking machines as forward-thinking. Writer Robert Smith considered that &quot;The War Machines&quot; posited a network of computers at a time when the development of ARPANET was still only being discussed, and that the serial anticipated the dominance of the Internet by 35 years.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
A novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Stuart Black, was published by Target Books in February 1989.

===Home media===
The serial was released on VHS in 1997, with an item from &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and a BBC1 &quot;globe ident&quot; (from the first part of the story) as extras. A Region 2 DVD issue was released on 25 August 2008; the Region 1 DVD was released on 6 January 2009. With the advance in technology since the original VHS release, the sections, which were missing from it, have been reinstated using the audio and appropriate visual material. Also, in 2007, an audio CD of the serial&#x27;s soundtrack, with linking narration by and bonus interview with Anneke Wills, was released.

<text>The following is the list of official public holidays recognized by the [[Government of Russia]]. On these days, government offices, embassies and some shops, are closed. If the date of observance falls on a weekend, the following Monday will be a day off in lieu of the holiday.

==Major national holidays==

===New Year Holiday===
In addition to New Year&#x27;s Day (Новый год, &quot;Novy god&quot;) on 1 January, 2–5 January are public holidays as well, called New Year holiday (, &quot;novogodniye kanikuly&quot;). The holiday includes 6 and 8 January, with Christmas being 7 January, declared as non-working days by law. Until 2005, only 1 and 2 January were public holidays.

=== Orthodox Christmas===
Christmas in Russia (Рождество Христово, &quot;Rozhdestvo Khristovo&quot;) is celebrated on 25 December (Julian calendar) which falls on 7 January (Gregorian calendar) and commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ. The public holiday was re-established in 1991, following the decades of suppression of religion and state atheism of the Soviet Union.

===Defender of the Fatherland Day===
The Defender of the Fatherland Day (День защитника Отечествa, &quot;Den zashchitnika Otechestva&quot;) is celebrated on 23 February and is dedicated to veterans and service personnel of the Russian Armed Forces, though it is often colloquially known as Men&#x27;s Day (День Мужчин, &quot;Den&#x27; Muzhchin&quot;) and commonly treated as a celebration of all men. The holiday was established in 1918 as it is connected to the decree published that day by the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars that formalized the official mandatory conscription in the Red Army.

===International Women&#x27;s Day===
On the eve of World War I campaigning for peace, Russian women observed their first International Women&#x27;s Day on the last Sunday in February 1913. In 1913 following discussions, International Women&#x27;s Day was transferred to 8 March and has remained the global date for International Women&#x27;s Day ever since.

=== Spring and Labour Day ===
In the former Soviet Union, 1 May was International Workers&#x27; Day and was celebrated with huge parades in cities like Moscow. Though the celebrations are low-key nowadays, several groups march on that day to protest grievances the workers have. Since 1992, May Day is officially called &quot;The Day of Spring and Labour&quot;.

===Victory Day===
On 9 May, Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, while remembering those who died in order to achieve it. On 9 May 1945 (by Moscow time) the German military surrendered to the Soviet Union and the Allies of World War II in Berlin (Karlshorst). Victory Day (День Победы, &quot;Den Pobedy&quot;) is by far one of the biggest Russian holidays. It commemorates those who died in World War II and pays tribute to survivors and veterans. Flowers and wreaths are laid on wartime graves and special parties and concerts are organized for veterans. In the evening there is a firework display. A large ground and air military parade, hosted by the President of the Russian Federation, is annually organized in Moscow on Red Square. Similar ground, air and marine (if possible) parades are organized in several other Russian cities (which are Hero Cities or have military districts or fleet headquarters primarily).

===Russia Day===
Russia Day (День России, &quot;Den Rossii&quot;) is celebrated on June 12. On this day, in 1991, the Russian parliament formally declared Russian sovereignty from the Soviet Union. The holiday was officially established in 1992. 

Initially it was named Day of the Adoption of the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Russian Federation, then on 1 February 2002 it was officially renamed Russia Day (in 1998 Boris Yeltsin offered this name socially).

In Russian society there is a misconception that this holiday is also called &quot;Russia&#x27;s Independence Day&quot;, but it never has had such a name in official documents. According to a survey by Levada Center in May 2009, 44% of respondents named the holiday as &quot;Independence Day of Russia&quot;.

===Unity Day===
Unity Day (День народного единства, &quot;Den narodnogo edinstva&quot;) was first celebrated on 4 November 2005, commemorating the popular uprising led by Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky which ended the Polish occupation of Moscow in November 1612, and more generally the end of Polish intervention in Russia and the Time of Troubles. The event was marked by a public holiday which was held in Russia on 22 October (Old Style) from 1649 till 1917. Its name alludes to the idea that all the classes of Russian society willingly united to preserve Russian statehood when its demise seemed inevitable, even though there was neither a Tsar nor Patriarch to guide them. Most observers view this as a replacement for the October Revolution Day. National Unity Day is also known as Consolidation Day (as an alternative translation), which people in Russia celebrate between 3-4 November.

<text>The Land of Smiles (German: ) is a 1929 romantic operetta in three acts by Franz Lehár. The German language libretto was by Ludwig Herzer and Fritz Löhner-Beda. The performance duration is about 100 minutes.

This was one of Lehár&#x27;s later works, and has a bittersweet ending which the Viennese loved. The title refers to the supposed Chinese custom of smiling, whatever happens in life. (The leading character, Prince Sou-Chong has a song early in the show, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Always smiling&quot;) which describes this.)

==The &quot;Tauberlied&quot;==
Lavishly produced, the show was built largely around the performance of the tenor Richard Tauber, a close friend of Lehár, for whom he customarily wrote a &#x27; – a signature tune exploiting the exceptional qualities of his voice – in each of his later operettas. On this occasion it was &quot;Dein ist mein ganzes Herz&quot; (&quot;You are my heart&#x27;s delight&quot;), probably the most famous of all the &#x27;. Tauber also appeared in the show in London, singing many encores of his song.

==Performance history==
The work was originally produced under the title &#x27; (&quot;The Yellow Jacket&quot;). This was presented at the , Vienna, on 9 February 1923 with Hubert Marischka as Sou-Chong. It was not a great success, and Lehár later revised it, under the new title of &#x27;, which was first performed, at the , on 10 October 1929. Tauber reprised his role in London (1931 and 1932) South Africa (1939) and New York (1946), as well as in Vienna in 1930 (again at the ) and in 1938 (at the Vienna State Opera and also in Prague). Tauber also sang it in London and on tour throughout Britain between 1940 and 1942. The opera was first staged in the United States at the Boston Opera House in 1933 with soprano Nancy McCord as Lisa.

Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera produced it in London in the late 1950s, after the success of Lehár&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; starring June Bronhill had rescued the company from bankruptcy. Starring Charles Craig, Elizabeth Fretwell and Bronhill, the show did not attract the same audiences as &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;.

In 1991, Takarazuka Revue&#x27;s Snow Troupe performed a Japanese language version of &quot;Das Land des Lächelns.&quot; The production was adapted and directed by Nobuo Murakami, and starred Maki Ichiro as Prince Sou-Chong, Risa Junna as Lisa, and Yōka Wao as Gustav von Pottenstein.

In 2017 Opernhaus Zürich performed &quot;Das Land des Lächelns&quot; and recorded it on DVD and Blu-ray. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, they shared the recording for free to allow those in isolation to enjoy the opera.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==
The operetta is set in Vienna and China in 1912. In act 1 in Vienna, the heroine Countess Lisa marries a Chinese prince and returns with him to his homeland despite the warnings of her friends and family. In act 2, in Peking, she finds that she is unable to come to terms with his culture, and especially that he must take other wives. He assures her that it is just a formality, but unhappiness is inevitable, and she is locked in the palace. Her love changes to hate. In act 3, Prince Sou-Chong is left alone while his beloved Lisa returns to her homeland. His sister, Princess Mi had also become attached to the Viennese official Gustav, and so the ending is doubly sad. But the prince respects the rule of his custom: always smile.

==Film adaptations==
The operetta was adapted into film several times.
* &quot;The Land of Smiles&quot; (1930) directed by Max Reichmann and starring Richard Tauber. Hella Kürty and Willi Stettner reprised their original stage roles of Mi and Gustl, while Lisa was sung by Margit Suchy, replacing Vera Schwarz who had sung in the original Berlin stage production.

<text>A list of current public holidays in South Africa:


The Public Holidays Act (Act No 36 of 1994) states that whenever a public holiday falls on a Sunday, the Monday following it will be a public holiday.

==Once-off holidays==

Since 1994 election days have been declared ad hoc public holidays:
* National and provincial government elections – 2 June 1999
* National and provincial government elections – 14 April 2004
* Local government elections – 1 March 2006
* National and provincial government elections – 22 April 2009
* Local government elections – 18 May 2011
* National and provincial government elections – 7 May 2014
* Local government elections – 3 August 2016
* National and provincial government elections – 8 May 2019
* Local government elections – 1 November 2021

31 December 1999 and 2 January 2000 were declared public holidays to accommodate the Y2K changeover, and 3 January 2000 was automatically a public holiday because the previous holiday was a Sunday.

2 May 2008 was declared a public holiday when Human Rights Day and Good Friday coincided on 21 March 2008.

27 December 2011 was declared a holiday by deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe as Christmas Day fell on a Sunday which generally makes the following Monday a public holiday. However, the following Monday, 26 December 2011, was the Day of Goodwill and therefore decreased the number of paid public holidays for the year. Initially this day was not to be declared a public holiday but in mid-December the decision was changed.

27 December 2016 was declared a holiday by president Jacob Zuma following a request by the Federation of Unions of South Africa (FEDUSA). The request by FEDUSA was motivated by the fact this year, workers in the country will only have 11 public holidays instead of 12 due to fact that 25 December (Christmas Day) falls on a Sunday. The declaration of 27 December as a public holiday, the Presidency said, will ensure that workers are not unduly disadvantaged because of this unusual event and are still entitled to their 12 paid public holidays.

27 December 2022 was declared a holiday by president Cyril Ramaphosa
In view of the unique circumstances around the 2022 calendar, and to uphold relevant labour law principles and practices, President Ramaphosa has declared Tuesday, 27 December, as a public holiday in lieu of Christmas Day.
COSATU urged Cyril Ramaphosa to declare December 27 a public holiday, saying it would also show appreciation for the sacrifices workers had made in keeping the economy moving.
15 December 2023 was declared a holiday by president Cyril Ramaphosa due to South Africa winning the Rugby World Cup for the fourth time.

==Religious public holidays==
The Christian holidays of Christmas Day and Good Friday remained in secular post-apartheid South Africa&#x27;s calendar of public holidays. The Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL Rights Commission), a chapter nine institution established in 2004, held countrywide consultative public hearings in June and July 2012 to assess the need for a review of public holidays following the receipt of complaints from minority groups about unfair discrimination. The CRL Rights Commission stated that they would submit their recommendations to the Department of Home Affairs, the Department of Labour, various Portfolio Committees and the Office of the Presidency by October 2012. On 10 November 2012 the Minister of Home Affairs Naledi Pandor told Christian protesters objecting to the removal of Christian public holidays that she had not received any enquiries from the CRL Rights Commission yet. The CRL Rights Commission published its recommendations on 17 April 2013, including the scrapping of some existing public holidays to free up days for some non-Christian religious public holidays. On 18 January 2015 the South African Law Reform Commission published a discussion document on legislation administered by the Department of Home Affairs in which it suggested &quot;that either these holidays be reviewed or that equal weight be given to holidays of other faiths&quot;.

==Historical public holidays==
South Africa&#x27;s present calendar of public holidays was introduced in 1994. During the period between Union in 1910, and the establishment of the present republic in 1994, the following were the official public holidays:

<doc id="873527" wikidata="Q5114623" url="?curid=873527" title="Chrysler 3.3 &amp; 3.8 engines">
<text>The Chrysler 3.3 and 3.8 engines are V6 engines used by Chrysler from 1989 to 2011.
This engine family was Chrysler&#x27;s first 60° V6 engine designed and built in-house for front wheel drive vehicles, and their first V6 not based on a V8. It was designed as a larger, more powerful alternative to the Mitsubishi 3.0 V6 in the minivans and debuted in 1989 for the 1990 model year. They were later also used in some rear wheel drive cars like the Jeep Wrangler.

The engines were produced in two major variants differing by their piston displacement: a and a . The 3.3 was dropped after 2010 with the Chrysler minivans, and the 3.8 was dropped after 2011 with the Jeep Wrangler, ending 22 years in production.

==Specifications==
==History==
The original 3.3 engine, as well as the larger 3.8, are pushrod engine designs. The 3.3 was introduced in 1989 with the 1990 Chrysler Imperial, New Yorker, and related K-series models, and was joined in 1991 by the 3.8. Production on the 3.3 was stopped in 2010 after a run of 5,076,603 engines, while the 3.8 remained in production until May 2011 in Trenton, Michigan for the Jeep Wrangler. Both use a cast iron block and aluminum heads.

===3.3===
The first of the family, the 3.3 liter engine&#x27;s actual piston displacement is with a bore and stroke. In 1994, the 3.3 received a increase in power to due to a new air intake. In 2001, the engine was fitted with a variable intake control system which boosted output to at 5000 rpm and at 4000 rpm. The engine was especially suited for transverse applications in Chrysler&#x27;s minivans, but was also used in a longitudinal front-wheel-drive setup on 1993-1997 LH platform cars. It was last used in 2010 for Chrysler minivans before the introduction of the new 3.6 L Pentastar engine for the 2011 model year.

Designated EGA, the 3.3 was built at Trenton Engine in Trenton, Michigan. It uses Sequential fuel injection, has roller tappets and features forged steel connecting rods, a one-piece cast camshaft, and either a cast aluminum or reinforced plastic intake manifold. The 3.3 has a timing chain, and is an interference engine meaning that the valves will collide with the pistons in the event of a timing chain failure.

Vehicles using the 3.3 include:
*1990–1993 Dodge Dynasty, Chrysler New Yorker, Chrysler Imperial, (replaced the 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; engine)
*1990–2010 Chrysler minivans
*1993–1997 Chrysler Concorde/Dodge Intrepid/Eagle Vision

===3.8===

The 3.3 was bored and stroked to to create a version. This EGH version was also built at Trenton Engine in Trenton, MI.

The 3.8 received an increase in power of , for a total of in 1994 via a new intake system. In 1998 the compression ratio increased for a total of and . In 2001, like the 3.3 the 3.8 received the symmetrical reinforced plastic intake plenum and revised camshaft which boosted output to at 5000 rpm with at 4000 rpm.

Vehicles using the 3.8 include:
*1991–1993 Chrysler New Yorker and Chrysler Imperial , 
*1994–2010 Chrysler minivans
*2007–2011 Jeep Wrangler (JK) 
*2009–2010 Volkswagen Routan

==SOHC==

A single overhead camshaft was an addition to the lineup for 1993. Introduced with the 3.5 L engine, this design spawned the DOHC 2.7 L Chrysler LH engine, as well as the 3.2 L and 4.0 L variants.

<doc id="873532" wikidata="Q322922" url="?curid=873532" title="Jacques Ellul">
<text>Jacques Ellul (; ; January 6, 1912 – May 19, 1994) was a French philosopher, sociologist, lay theologian, and professor. Noted as a Christian anarchist, Ellul was a longtime professor of History and the Sociology of Institutions on the Faculty of Law and Economic Sciences at the University of Bordeaux. A prolific writer, he authored more than 60 books and more than 600 articles over his lifetime, many of which discussed propaganda, the impact of technology on society, and the interaction between religion and politics.

The dominant theme of Ellul&#x27;s work proved to be the threat to human freedom and religion created by modern technology. He did not seek to eliminate modern technology or technique but sought to change our perception of modern technology and technique to that of a tool rather than regulator of the &quot;status quo&quot;. Among his most influential books are &quot;The Technological Society&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Considered by many a philosopher, Ellul was trained as a sociologist, and approached the question of technology and human action from a dialectical viewpoint. His writings are frequently concerned with the emergence of a technological tyranny over humanity. As a philosopher and theologian, he further explored the religiosity of the technological society. In 2000, the International Jacques Ellul Society was founded by a group of former Ellul students. The society, which includes scholars from a variety of disciplines, is devoted to continuing Ellul&#x27;s legacy and discussing the contemporary relevance and implications of his work.

==Life and influences==

Jacques Ellul was born in Bordeaux, France, on January 6, 1912, to Marthe Mendes (Protestant; French-Portuguese) and Joseph Ellul (initially an Eastern Orthodox Christian, but then a Voltarian deist by conviction; born in Malta of an Italo-Maltese father and Serb mother). As a teenager he wanted to be a naval officer but his father made him study law. He married Yvette Lensvelt in 1937.

Ellul was educated at the universities of Bordeaux and Paris. In World War II, he was a leader in the French resistance. For his efforts to save Jews he was awarded the title &quot;Righteous among the Nations&quot; by Yad Vashem in 2001. He was a layman in the Reformed Church of France and attained a high position within it as part of the National Council.

Ellul was best friends with Bernard Charbonneau, who was also a writer from the Aquitaine region and a protagonist of the French personalism movement. They met through the Protestant Student Federation during the academic school year of 1929–1930. Both men acknowledged the great influence each had on the other.

By the early 1930s, Ellul&#x27;s three primary sources of inspiration were Karl Marx, Søren Kierkegaard, and Karl Barth. Ellul was first introduced to the ideas of Karl Marx during an economics lecture course taught by Joseph Benzacar in 1929–30; Ellul studied Marx and became a prolific of his theories. During this same period, he also came across the Christian existentialism of Kierkegaard. According to Ellul, Marx and Kierkegaard were his two greatest influences, and the only two authors whose work he read in its entirety. Also, he considered Karl Barth, who was a leader of the resistance against the German state church in World War II, the greatest theologian of the 20th century. In addition to these intellectual influences, Ellul also said that his father played a great role in his life and considered him his role model.

In large measure, and especially in those of his books concerned with theological matters, Ellul restates the viewpoints held by Barth, whose polar dialectic of the Word of God, in which the Gospel both judges and renews the world, shaped Ellul&#x27;s theological perspective. In &quot;Jacques Ellul: A Systemic Exposition&quot; Darrell J. Fasching claimed Ellul believed &quot;That which desacralizes a given reality, itself in turn becomes the new sacred reality&quot;.

In 1932, after what he describes as &quot;a very brutal and very sudden conversion&quot;, Ellul professed himself a Christian. Ellul believes he was about 17 (1929–30) and spending the summer with some friends in Blanquefort, France. While translating &quot;Faust&quot; alone in the house, Ellul knew (without seeing or hearing anything) he was in the presence of a something so astounding, so overwhelming, which entered the very center of his being. He jumped on a bike and fled, concluding eventually that he had been in the presence of God. This experience started the conversion process which Ellul said then continued over a period of years thereafter. Although Ellul identified as a Protestant, he was critical of church authority in general because he believed the church dogmas did not place enough emphasis on the teachings of Jesus or Christian scripture.

Ellul was also prominent in the worldwide ecumenical movement, although he later became sharply critical of the movement for what he felt were indiscriminate endorsements of political establishments. Ellul came to like Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who convinced him that the creation of new institutions from the grass roots level was the best way to create an anarchist society. He stated his view is close to that of anarcho-syndicalism, however the kind of change Ellul wanted was an evolutionary approach by means of a &quot;... Proudhonian socialism ... by transforming the press, the media, and the economic structures ... by means of a federative cooperative approach&quot; that would lead to an Anarchist society based on federation and the Mutualist economics of Proudhon. In regards to Jesus and Anarchism he believed Jesus was not merely a socialist but anarchist and that &quot;anarchism is the fullest and most serious form of socialism&quot;.

Ellul has been credited with coining the phrase, &quot;Think globally, act locally.&quot; He often said that he was born in Bordeaux by chance, but that it was by choice that he spent almost all his academic career there.

Ellul fell into a deep grief following the 16 April 1991 death of his wife, Yvette. He died three years later, on 19 May 1994 in Pessac.

==Theology==
While Ellul was primarily a sociologist who focused on discussions of technology, he saw his theological work as an essential aspect of his career. He began publishing theological discussions early, with such books as &quot;The Presence of the Kingdom&quot; (1948).

Although a son of the minority French Reformed tradition and thus a spiritual heir of thinkers like John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli, Ellul departed substantially from Reformed doctrinal traditions, but unlike other European Protestant thinkers, utterly rejected the influence of philosophical idealism or romanticism upon his beliefs about God and human faith. In articulating his theological ideas, he mainly drew upon the corpus of works by the Swiss-German theologian Karl Barth and the critiques of European state Christianity made by Dane Søren Kierkegaard. Thus, some have considered him one of the more ardent expositors of dialectical theology, which was in decline elsewhere in the Western theological scene during Ellul&#x27;s heyday. Much like Barth, Ellul had no use for either liberal theology (to him dominated by Enlightenment notions about the goodness of humanity and thus rendered puerile by its naïveté) or orthodox Protestantism (e.g., fundamentalism or scholastic Calvinism, both of which to him refuse to acknowledge the radical freedom of God and humanity) and maintained a roughly un-Catholic view of the Bible, theology, and the churches.

One particular theological movement that aroused his ire was death of God theology. Some within this movement held the conviction that the traditional Christian conceptions of God and humanity arise from a primitive consciousness, one that most civilized people have quite overcome. This line of thought affirmed the ethical teachings of Jesus but rejected the idea that he represented anything more than a highly accomplished human being. Ellul attacked this school, and practitioners of it such as Harvey Cox, as out of accord not with Christian doctrinal traditions, but reality itself, namely what he perceived as the irreducible religiosity of the human race, a devotion that has worshiped idols such as rulers, nations, and in more recent times materialism, scientism, technology and economics. To Ellul, people use such fallen images, or powers, as a substitute for God, and are, in turn, used by them, with no possible appeal to innocence or neutrality, which, although possible theoretically, does not in fact exist. Ellul thus renovates in a non-legalistic manner the traditional Christian understanding of original sin and espouses a thoroughgoing pessimism about human capabilities, a view most sharply evidenced in his &quot;The Meaning of the City&quot;. Ellul stated that one of the problems with these &quot;new theologies&quot; was:


Ellul espouses views on salvation, the sovereignty of God, and ethical action that appear to take a deliberately contrarian stance toward established, &quot;mainstream&quot; opinion. For instance, in the book &quot;What I Believe,&quot; he declared himself to be a Christian Universalist, writing &quot;that all people from the beginning of time are saved by God in Jesus Christ, that they have all been recipients of His grace no matter what they have done.&quot; Ellul formulated this stance not from any liberal or humanistic sympathies, but in the main from an extremely high view of God&#x27;s transcendence, that God is totally free to do what God pleases. Any attempts to modify that freedom from merely human standards of righteousness and justice amount to sin, to putting oneself in God&#x27;s place, which is precisely what Adam and Eve sought to do in the creation myths in Genesis. This highly unusual juxtaposition of original sin and universal salvation has repelled liberal and conservative critics and commentators alike, who charge that such views amount to antinomianism, denying that God&#x27;s laws are binding upon human beings. In most of his theologically oriented writings, Ellul effectively dismisses those charges as stemming from a radical confusion between religions as human phenomena and the unique claims of the Christian faith, which are not predicated upon human achievement or moral integrity whatsoever.

==On technique==
The Ellulian concept of technique is briefly defined within the &quot;Notes to Reader&quot; section of &quot;The Technological Society&quot; (1964). It is &quot;the totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity.&quot; He states here as well that the term technique is not solely machines, technology, or a procedure used to attain an end.
What many consider to be Ellul&#x27;s most important work, &quot;The Technological Society&quot; (1964), was originally published in French as &quot;La Technique: L&#x27;enjeu du siècle&quot; (literally, &quot;The Stake of the Century&quot;). In it, Ellul set forth seven characteristics of modern technology that make efficiency a necessity: rationality, artificiality, automatism of technical choice, self-augmentation, monism, universalism, and autonomy. The rationality of technique enforces logical and mechanical organization through division of labor, the setting of production standards, etc. And it creates an artificial system which &quot;eliminates or subordinates the natural world.&quot;

Regarding technology, instead of it being subservient to humanity, &quot;human beings have to adapt to it, and accept total change.&quot; As an example, Ellul offered the diminished value of the humanities to a technological society. As people begin to question the value of learning ancient languages and history, they question those things which, on the surface, do little to advance their financial and technical state. According to Ellul, this misplaced emphasis is one of the problems with modern education, as it produces a situation in which immense stress is placed on information in our schools. The focus in those schools is to prepare young people to enter the world of information, to be able to work with computers but knowing only their reasoning, their language, their combinations, and the connections between them. This movement is invading the whole intellectual domain and also that of conscience.

Ellul&#x27;s commitment to scrutinize technological development is expressed as such:
The sacred then, as classically defined, is the object of both hope and fear, both fascination and dread. Once, nature was the all-encompassing environment and power upon which human beings were dependent in life and death, and so was experienced as sacred. The Reformation desacralized the church in the name of the Bible, and the Bible became the sacred book. But since then, scientism (through Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution) and reason (higher criticism and liberal theology) have desacralized the scriptures, and the sciences, particularly those applied sciences that are amenable to the aims of collective economic production (be it capitalist, socialist, or communist), have been elevated to the position of sacred in Western culture. Today, he argues, the technological society is generally held sacred. Since he defines technique as &quot;the totality of methods rationally arrived at, and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity&quot;, it is clear that his sociological analysis focuses not on the society of machines as such, but on the society of &quot;efficient techniques&quot;:
It is useless, he argues, to think that a distinction can be made between technique and its use, for techniques have specific social and psychological consequences independent of human desires. There can be no room for moral considerations in their use:
What is the solution to technique according to Ellul? The solution is to simply view technique as objects that can be useful to us and recognize it for what it is, just another thing among many others, instead of believing in technique for its own sake or that of society. If we do this we &quot;...destroy the basis for the power technique has over humanity.&quot;

==On anarchy and violence==
Ellul identified himself as a Christian anarchist. Ellul explained his view in this way: &quot;By anarchy I mean first an absolute rejection of violence.&quot; And, &quot;... Jesus was not only a socialist but an anarchist – and I want to stress here that I regard anarchism as the fullest and most serious form of socialism.&quot; For him, this meant that nation-states, as the primary sources of violence in the modern era, should neither be praised nor feared, but continually questioned and challenged. For Ellul, human government is largely irrelevant in that the revelation of God contained in Scripture is sufficient and exclusive. That is, being a Christian means pledging absolute allegiance to Christ, which makes other laws redundant at best or counter to the revelation of God at worst. Despite the initial attraction of some evangelicals to his thinking because of his high view of Biblical texts (i.e., generally eschewing the historical-critical method), this position alienated some conservative Protestants. Later, he would attract a following among adherents of more ethically compatible traditions such as the Anabaptists and the house church movement. Similar political ideas to Ellul&#x27;s appear in the writings of a corresponding friend of his, the American William Stringfellow, and long-time admirer Vernard Eller, author of &quot;Christian Anarchy&quot;. Ellul identified the State and political power as the Beast in the Book of Revelation.

Jacques Ellul discusses anarchy on a few pages in &quot;The Ethics of Freedom&quot; and in more detail within his later work, &quot;Anarchy &amp; Christianity&quot;. Although he does admit that anarchy does not seem to be a direct expression of Christian freedom, he concludes that the absolute power he sees within the current (as of 1991) nation-state can only be responded to with an absolute negative position (i.e. anarchy). He states that his intention is not to establish an unrealistically pure anarchist society or the total destruction of the state. His initial point in &quot;Anarchy &amp; Christianity&quot; is that he is led toward a realistic form of anarchy by his commitment to an absolute rejection of violence through the creation of alternative grassroots institutions in the manner similar to Anarcho-Syndicalism. However, Ellul does not entertain the idea that all Christians in all places and all times will refrain from violence. Rather, he insisted that violence could not be reconciled with the God of Love, and thus, true freedom. A Christian that chooses the path of violence must admit that he or she is abandoning the path of freedom and committing to the way of necessity.

During the Spanish Civil War Spanish anarchist friends of Ellul&#x27;s soon-to-be wife came to France in search of weapons. He tried to get some for them through an old school friend of his and claimed that this was probably the one time in his life when he was sufficiently motivated to commit an act of violence. He did not go with the anarchists primarily because he had only recently met the woman that would become his wife and did not wish to leave her.

Ellul states in &quot;The Subversion of Christianity&quot; that he thinks &quot;that the biblical teaching is clear. It always contests political power. It incites to &#x27;counterpower,&#x27; to &#x27;positive&#x27; criticism, to an irreducible dialogue (like that between king and prophet in Israel), to antistatism, to a decentralizing of the relation, to an extreme relativizing of everything political, to an anti-ideology, to a questioning of all that claims either power or dominion (in other words, of all things political), and finally, if we may use a modern term, to a kind of &quot;anarchism&quot; (so long as we do not relate the term to the anarchist teaching of the nineteenth century).&quot; As Patrick Chastenet put it, Ellul is &quot;with god, without master&quot;.

Ellul states in &quot;Violence&quot; that idealism serves to justify the use of violence, including:
# revolutionary idealism (viewing violence as a means to an end and/or violence under the mask of legality)
# generous idealism (leading to violence toward reconciliation and/or a blindness of the violence of one&#x27;s enemy)

3. pacifist idealism (beliefs and lifestyles which are only possible within a larger violence-based society)

4. Christian idealism (which is always concerned with the moral goodness of the human world). This leads to concepts of progressiveness and unreserved participation with good conscience in political or scientific action. &quot;In their idyllic world, harshness, torture, and war seem abnormal and almost incomprehensible. But it is only gross, highly visible, undeniable violence that evokes this scandalized reaction. They deny the existence of masked, secret, covert violence—insofar as this can be concealed...&quot;

Ellul&#x27;s ultimate goal was to create by evolutionary means a &quot;...Proudhonian socialism...by transforming the press, the media, and the economic structures...by means of a federative cooperative approach...&quot; an anarchist society based on federation and the mutualist economics of Proudhon.

==On justice==
Ellul believed that social justice and true freedom were incompatible. He rejected any attempt to reconcile them. He believed that a Christian could choose to join a movement for justice, but in doing so, must admit that this fight for justice is necessarily, and at the same time, a fight against all forms of freedom. While social justice provides a guarantee against the risk of bondage, it simultaneously subjects a life to necessities. Ellul believed that when a Christian decides to act it must be in a way that is specifically Christian. &quot;Christians must never identify themselves with this or that political or economic movement. Rather, they must bring to social movements what they alone can provide. Only so can they signalize the kingdom. So far as they act like the others—even to forward social justice, equality, etc.—I say that there is no sense and nothing specifically Christian in acting like the others. In fact the political and revolutionary attitude proper to the Christian is radically different from the attitude of others; it is specifically Christian or else it is nothing.&quot;

In &quot;Violence&quot; Ellul states his belief that only God is able to establish justice and God alone who will institute the kingdom at the end of time. He acknowledges that some have used this as an excuse to do nothing, but also points out how some death-of-God advocates use this to claim that &quot;we ourselves must undertake to establish social justice&quot;. Ellul maintained that without a belief in the traditional Judeo-Christian conception of God, love and the pursuit for justice becomes selective, for the only relation left is the horizontal one. Ellul asks how we are to define justice and claims that followers of death-of-God theology and/or philosophy clung to Matthew 25 stating that justice requires them to feed the poor. Ellul says that many European Christians rushed into socialist circles (and with this began to accept the movement&#x27;s tactics of violence, propaganda, etc.) mistakenly thinking socialism would assure justice when in fact it only pursues justice for the chosen and/or interesting poor whose condition (as a victim of capitalism or some other socialist enemy) is consistent with the socialist ideology.

Ellul states in &quot;The Subversion of Christianity&quot; that &quot;to proclaim the class conflict and the &#x27;classical&#x27; revolutionary struggle is to stop at the same point as those who defend their goods and organizations. This may be useful socially but it is not at all Christian in spite of the disconcerting efforts of theologies of revolution. Revelation demands this renunciation—the renunciation of illusions, of historic hopes, of references to our own abilities or numbers or sense of justice. We are to tell people and thus to increase their awareness (the offense of the ruling classes is that of trying to blind and deaden the awareness of those whom they dominate). Renounce everything in order to be everything. Trust in no human means, for God will provide (we cannot say where, when, or how). Have confidence in his Word and not in a rational program. Enter on a way on which you will gradually find answers but with no guaranteed substance. All this is difficult, much more so than recruiting guerillas, instigating terrorism, or stirring up the masses. And this is why the gospel is so intolerable, intolerable to myself as I speak, as I say all this to myself and others, intolerable for readers, who can only shrug their shoulders.&quot;

==On media, propaganda, and information==
Ellul discusses these topics in detail in his landmark work, &quot;&quot;. He viewed the power of the media as another example of technology exerting control over human destiny. As a mechanism of change, the media are almost invariably manipulated by , whether of the market or the state.

Also within &quot;Propaganda&quot; Ellul claims that &quot;it is a fact that excessive data do not enlighten the reader or the listener; they drown him. He cannot remember them all, or coordinate them, or understand them; if he does not want to risk losing his mind, he will merely draw a general picture from them. And the more facts supplied, the more simplistic the image&quot;. Additionally, people become &quot;caught in a web of facts they have been given. They cannot even form a choice or a judgment in other areas or on other subjects. Thus the mechanisms of modern information induce a sort of hypnosis in the individual, who cannot get out of the field that has been laid out for him by the information&quot;. &quot;It is not true that he can choose freely with regard to what is presented to him as the truth. And because rational propaganda thus creates an irrational situation, it remains, above all, propaganda—that is, an inner control over the individual by a social force, which means that it deprives him of himself&quot;.

Ellul agreed with Jules Monnerot who stated that &quot;All individual passion leads to the suppression of all critical judgment with regard to the object of that passion&quot;.

In response to an invitation from Protestant associations, Ellul visited Germany twice (1934 and 1935). On the second visit he attended a Nazi meeting out of curiosity which influenced his later work on propaganda and its ability to unify a group.

&quot;To throw this wager or secular faith into the boldest possible relief, Ellul places it in dialectical contrast with Biblical faith. As a dialectical contrast to &quot;La Technique,&quot; for instance, Ellul writes &quot;Sans feu ni lieu&quot; (published in 1975, although written much earlier.)&quot;

==On humanism==
In explaining the significance of freedom and the purpose for resisting the enslavement of humans via acculturation (or sociological bondage), Ellul rejects the notion that this is due to some supposed supreme importance linked to humanity. He states that modern enslavement expresses how authority, signification, and value are attached to humanity and the beliefs and institutions it creates. This leads to an exaltation of the nation or state, money, technology, art, morality, the party, etc. The work of humanity is glorified and worshiped, while simultaneously enslaving humankind.

**&quot;The Technological Society&quot;. Trans. John Wilkinson. New York: Knopf, 1964. London: Jonathan Cape, 1965. Rev. ed.: New York: Knopf/Vintage, 1967. with introduction by Robert K. Merton (professor of sociology, Columbia University). This may be his best-known work; Aldous Huxley brought the French edition to the attention of an English publisher, and thus brought it to English readers. Theodore Kaczynski had a copy in his cabin and said he read it several times—his &quot;manifesto&quot; and other writings were influenced by it and addressed similar themes. A 2021 study uses Kaczynski&#x27;s annotated photocopy of The Technological Society to identify the specific ideas that Kaczynski borrowed from Ellul.

<text>Digital storage media command and control (DSM-CC) is a toolkit for developing control channels associated with MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 streams. It is defined in part 6 of the MPEG-2 standard (Extensions for DSM-CC) and uses a client/server model connected via an underlying network (carried via the MPEG-2 multiplex or independently if needed).

DSM-CC may be used for controlling the video reception, providing features normally found on Video Cassette Recorders (VCR) (fast-forward, rewind, pause, etc.). It may also be used for a wide variety of other purposes including packet data transport. It is defined by a series of weighty standards, principally MPEG-2 ISO/IEC 13818-6 (part 6 of the MPEG-2 standard).

DSM-CC may work in conjunction with next generation packet networks, working alongside such internet protocols as RSVP, RTSP, RTP and SCP. Although DSM-CC is usually associated with video delivery (via satellite or terrestrially) and with interactive content, it is also used among audio servers and clients. The architecture describes three main parts of the system: the client, the server, and the session resource manager (SRM). The server provides content and other services to the client, and both are &quot;clients&quot; of the SRM. The SRM allocates and manages network resources (such as channels, bandwidth, and network addresses.) By combining server and client components together onto the same platforms, peer-to-peer content access and delivery systems can be constructed.

These specifications include numerous implementation options. For example, MPEG-2 video can be encoded in different ways, and a DSM-CC system can be constructed to include or exclude certain features and interfaces. Normally, an outside specification will define a profile of specific options, allowing systems built using common profiles to interoperate.

DSM-CC defines or extends five distinct protocols:

;User-User: Allows remote access by the client to objects on the server. The User-User specification goes beyond the definition of specific server object classes to define classes local to the client, as well as some of the interaction with other parts of the system. The distributed object model is based on CORBA. Objects are accessed using the internet inter-ORB protocol (IIOP), with some optional extensions. Two subsets, &quot;core&quot; and &quot;extended&quot;, are defined. In the model, some clients may also load content onto the server.

;User-Network: There are two parts to this protocol: Session and Resource. This protocol is used between the client and SRM, and between the server and SRM. The U-N Session protocol is used to establish sessions with the network, associated with resources which are allocated and released using the U-N Resource protocol.

;MPEG transport profiles: The specification provides profiles to the standard MPEG transport protocol (defined by ISO/IEC 13818-1) to allow transmission of event, synchronization, download, and other information in the MPEG transport stream.

;Download: Several variations of this protocol allow transfer of content from server to client, either within the MPEG transport stream or on a separate (presumably high-speed) channel. Flow-controlled download allows the download operations to be negotiated and controlled by the client. A variation of download is an autonomous &quot;data carousel&quot; on the server which repeatedly downloads information; the download carousel client waits for the information without initiating the transfer. An extension to the data carousel is the &quot;object carousel&quot;, which presents downloaded information as objects compatible with the objects defined by the User-User API. (The choice of download or IIOP protocols is embedded in the object&#x27;s IOR, so the means of access is transparent to the client application.)

;Switched Digital Broadcast-Channel Change Protocol (SDB/CCP): Enables a client to remotely switch from channel to channel in a broadcast environment. Used to attach a client to a continuous-feed session (CFS) or other broadcast feed. Sometimes used in pay-per-view.

An implementation does not always need all of these protocols. Almost all implementations in the real world use a subset.

==Extension==
Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework (DMIF) expands upon the MPEG-2 DSM-CC standard (ISO/IEC 13818-6:1998) to enable the convergence of interactive, broadcast and conversational multimedia into one specification which will be applicable to set tops, desktops and mobile stations. The DSM-CC work was extended as part of the ISO/IEC 14496-6 (MPEG-4 Part 6), with the &quot;DSM-CC Multimedia Integration Framework (DMIF)&quot;.

<text>The Mendoza College of Business is the business school at the University of Notre Dame, a private research university in Notre Dame, Indiana. Founded in 1921, it offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Apart from its main campus, it also offers an executive MBA, master’s in finance, and master’s in business analytics in Chicago. It has a network of over 40,000 undergraduate and graduate alumni. The school was renamed in 2000 following a donation to the school by Tom Mendoza.

== History ==

Business and commerce classes had been taught at Notre Dame since its foundation, and already in 1853 there was a Mercantile Department. The teaching of business was yet fragmented for many years, with the Department disappearing from 1856 to 1860, and then being reformulated as a two-year commercial course in 1863. This course taught bookkeeping, penmanship, arithmetic, algebra, English grammar and composition, elocution, geography, history, German, business practice, and commercial law and was stable for several years. In 1905, it was renamed Commercial School and became a one-year program. In 1910, the program was inserted into the preparatory school curriculum and became a four-year course. Meanwhile, in 1913, a proper Department of Commerce was established within the College of Arts and Letters. This included several courses on secretarial and business work but also training for managerial and executive positions. The main program offered was a four-year Bachelor of Philosophy in Commerce with classes in accounting for four semesters and additional classes in money, credit and banking, public finance, economic development in the United States, railway transportation, industrial organization and combination, insurance, and business law. Additional coursework included several foreign languages, economics, philosophy, politics, labor problem, American government, and elocution. In 1917, Notre Dame became the first university to launch a four-year course in foreign commerce.

The real beginning of the school was on April 20, 1921, when the department was removed from the College of Arts and Letters and became the separate College of Commerce. The first dean of the college was John Francis O&#x27;Hara (who later became the president of the University and a Cardinal). O&#x27;Hara, who had spearheaded the new foreign commerce program, was inspired by his knowledge of business. He had studied at Wharton and of the history and culture Latin America (where he had lived following his ambassador father). He hoped to place Notre Dame and its graduates in the burgeoning trade and growing economic power between North and South America. In 1921, the college had about 400 students and 13 faculty. Under O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s leadership, the school soon offered 85 classes in 5 departments (accounting, marketing, transportation, finance, and foreign trade) and his efforts, together with a societal trend towards valuing business education to obtain a job, made the college tie the College of Arts and Letters as the highest enrollment in 1922 with over 500 students. Despite criticism that the college&#x27;s education was becoming too commercialized and vocational, O&#x27;Hara maintained a liberal arts theme in the business courses and retained language, philosophy, political science, and history classes. O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s ambitious goals (which included a graduate school and major program in foreign commerce) were cut short by lack of funding.

In 1924, James E. McCarthy succeeded O&#x27;Hara as dean, a post he would keep until 1955. McCarthy was an outspoken advocate of free trade and was well acquainted with many of the nation&#x27;s leading businessmen and CEOs. During his tenure, the college rose greatly in prominence and visibility, hugely increased the number and quality of courses, and became the university&#x27;s largest academic division, increasing from 500 to 1500 students. In 1933, Chicago businessman Edward N. Hurley donated $200,000 for a new building for the college, which was named Hurley Hall. O&#x27;Hara had been pursuing Hurley for such a donation since 1919 but the financial situation of the country had not permitted it. Hurley was a successful businessman, founder of the Hurley Machine Company, and chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Shipping Board. He had been the honorary dean of the college since its founding and had received the Laetare Medal in 1926.

In 1954, the school opened it first masters program, tailored to men and women from religious orders. The masters evolved to become the Masters in nonprofit administration. In 1962, the school&#x27;s name changed to become the College of Business Administration and was also accredited by the AACSB. In 1967, the school started its MBS program with a class of 50 men from 17 states and 3 foreign countries; 1970 saw the enrollment of the first women in the program. The Hayes-Healy building opened in 1968, thanks to a gift from Ramon Hayes-Healy, offering more space for the growing college.

In 1999, the new and current building was completed. Located just southwest of the Notre Dame Stadium, it was designed following a nautical motif and nicknamed &quot;the ship of commerce&quot;. In March 2000, the College of Business received a naming gift from NetApp, Inc. executives, Tom and Kathy Mendoza. In 2006, Notre Dame bought the Santa Fe building in Chicago and relocated the Executive MBA, MS in Finance, and MS in Business Analytics programs. In 2007, the college was one of the first signatories of the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME). In 2010, Mendoza was ranked as No. 1 for undergraduate business by Bloomberg Businessweek, the first of five consecutive years. In 2013, the Stayer Center for Executive Education was built with a gift from Ralph Stayer, a &#x27;65 graduate.

==Rankings and reputation==

In 2016, Mendoza&#x27;s undergraduate business program was ranked No. 2 by Bloomberg Businessweek. Mendoza&#x27;s undergraduate business program was ranked No. 9 in the U.S. by U.S. News in 2016. In the 2017 edition, Mendoza no longer appears among the top 10. However, in 2017, Poets and Quants ranked Mendoza&#x27;s undergraduate business program at No. 4 nationally.

Rankings for Mendoza&#x27;s MBA program among U.S. MBA programs include No. 22 by &quot;Forbes, &quot;#34 in 2023 by &quot;Bloomberg BusinessWeek&quot; and No. 31 by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In global rankings, the Mendoza MBA was ranked No. 40 by &quot;The Economist&quot; and No. 80 by &quot;Financial Times&quot;. Its Executive MBA program was ranked No. 15 by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;. College Atlas and The Economist rank the Mendoza MBA 2nd among business schools in Indiana.

Poets &amp; Quants reveals a placement rate of 93% after 3 months for the Undergraduate school, as well as an average starting salary of roughly $72,000.

==Facilities==
The Mendoza College of Business main building, located on DeBartolo Quad, was built in 1996 and designed by Ellerbe Becket. Its 196,986 square feet of space includes the 300-seat Jordan Auditorium, classrooms, offices, administration, and digital spaces. The Potenziani Family Atrium features an original and refurbished NYSE trading post from 1929 that was in use until 1981.

<doc id="873535" wikidata="Q2865008" url="?curid=873535" title="Arthur Blank">
<text>Arthur Morris Blank (born September 27, 1942) is an American businessman. He is best known for being a co-founder of the home improvement retailer The Home Depot.

Blank owns three professional sports teams based in Atlanta, Georgiathe Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL), the Atlanta Drive of the TGL, and Atlanta United FC of Major League Soccer (MLS), the latter of which won the 2018 MLS Cupand is chairman of their parent company, AMB Group LLC.

==Life==
Arthur Blank was born in Flushing, New York. He was born to Jewish parents, Max Blank, a pharmacist, and Molly Blank. He has an older brother named Michael. Blank graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York City.
After graduating from Babson Institute in 1963, Blank was hired by Arthur Young and Company, where he was a senior accountant. He later joined the Daylin corporation, where he rose to become president of Elliott&#x27;s Drug Stores/Stripe Discount Stores, a division of Daylin. When Daylin decided to sell off that division, Blank moved to another division, Handy Dan Home Improvement Centers. Bernard Marcus was CEO of Handy Dan and Blank was vice president of finance when both were fired in 1978 as part of an internal power struggle.

In 1978, Blank co-founded Home Depot with Marcus. New York investment banker Ken Langone assembled the initial group of investors and merchandising expert Patrick Farrah helped founders realize their vision of one-stop shopping for the do-it-yourselfer. The first two stores opened on June 22, 1979 in Atlanta. The stores revolutionized the home improvement business with its warehouse concept and Blank and Marcus became billionaires as a result. Blank spent 19 years as the company&#x27;s president before succeeding Marcus as CEO. Blank retired from the company in 2001 as co-chairman.

On May 22, 2024, Blank won the Sports Business Journal&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award for his work with the Falcons, United FC, and the surrounding community.

==Sports ownership==
In February 2002, Blank purchased the Atlanta Falcons franchise in the National Football League from owner Taylor Smith, the son of team founder Rankin M. Smith Sr. In September 2004, he bought the Arena Football League franchise, the Georgia Force; he moved the team to the city of Atlanta after it had spent several years in suburban Gwinnett County. In 2024, Blank purchased the Atlanta Drive of the TGL.

Blank has expressed serious interest in purchasing other franchises. In early 2006, he temporarily withdrew from contention as a potential buyer of the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball. Some months later, Blank re-entered serious talks with Time Warner and a report indicated that a sale was imminent. However, in February 2007, the Braves completed the sale of the team to Liberty Media. Blank has also founded an expansion Major League Soccer franchise named Atlanta United FC that began play in 2017. The club shares Mercedes-Benz Stadium with the Falcons. Blank also helped the United States Soccer Federation set up their new headquarters in Atlanta, and the new training center was named in his honor.

==Philanthropy==
Blank is chairman of The Arthur Blank Family Foundation, and serves on the Board of Trustees of Emory University.

In March 2020, Blank&#x27;s foundation announced it would donate nearly $5.4 million to aid the coronavirus pandemic response in Georgia and Montana.

In October 2020, it was announced that the new Children&#x27;s Healthcare of Atlanta hospital would be named after Arthur Blank after his foundation donated $200 million to the project. The Arthur M. Blank Hospital opened on September 29, 2024.

He is a signatory of The Giving Pledge committing himself to give away at least 50% of his wealth to charitable causes.

==Personal life==

Blank has been married and divorced three times. He has three children with his first wife, Diana Blank (born 1942): Kenny Blank, Dena Blank Kimball, and Danielle Blank Thomsen; they divorced in 1993. In 1995, he married Stephanie V. Blank (born 1968), a Blowing Rock, North Carolina native and Appalachian State University graduate. They met when she worked as a designer at a Home Depot store in Atlanta. They had three children - Joshua Blank, Max Blank, and Kylie Blank - before being divorced. In June 2016, Blank married Angela Macuga (born 1968), who had three children from a previous marriage. They announced their pending divorce on January 1, 2019.

Blank owns Mountain Sky Guest Ranch and West Creek Ranch outside Yellowstone National Park in Paradise Valley, Montana. He also owns several PGA TOUR Superstores.

On February 9, 2016, Blank disclosed that he had treatable prostate cancer. On March 17, 2016, Blank announced that he is cancer-free following treatment.

<doc id="873541" wikidata="Q5422431" url="?curid=873541" title="Extreme points of North America">
<text>This is a list of the extreme points of North America: the points that are highest and lowest, and farther north, south, east or west than any other location on the continent. Some of these points are debatable, given the varying definitions of North America.

==North America and surrounding islands==
*Northernmost point — Kaffeklubben Island, Greenland . Although politically part of the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland is geologically part of the North American Plate. If non-permanent islands are included, then the northernmost point is Qeqertaq Avannarleq. If Greenland is excluded from North America, the northernmost point is Cape Columbia, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada .
*Southernmost point — Cocos Island, Costa Rica 
*Westernmost point — The westernmost point depends on the definition of &quot;westernmost&quot;. If following the International Date Line, it would be Cape Wrangell on Attu Island, Alaska, United States , or the tiny (ca. 200m diameter) Peaked Island, just off the coast to the west. However, if the border between east and west is defined by the 180th meridian, the westernmost point is the West Point of Amatignak Island , as Attu Island is in the Eastern Hemisphere.
*Easternmost point — Nordostrundingen, Greenland . If Greenland is excluded, then the easternmost point is Cape Spear, Newfoundland, Canada . Again, if one uses the technical definition of longitude, it is Pochnoi Point on Semisopochnoi Island, Alaska, since the state stretches into the Eastern Hemisphere. However, other sources argue it would be Cape Wrangell on Attu Island, Alaska, United States at , as well as the tiny (ca. 200m diameter) Peaked Island, just off the coast to the west.

==Continental North America==
*Northernmost point — Murchison Promontory, Canada 71°58′N 94°57′W

<text>The Rainmakers are a Kansas City, Missouri-based original rock band, fronted by Bob Walkenhorst, which had a small string of hits in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the United States and Europe, especially Norway.

==Biography==
The Rainmakers were formed in 1983 as a three-piece bar band called Steve, Bob and Rich. They released one album, &quot;Balls&quot;, under this name. The addition of drummer Pat Tomek allowed Walkenhorst to switch to guitar and assume the role of frontman. The band changed their name to The Rainmakers when they were signed to PolyGram by A&amp;R man Peter Lubin.

The band&#x27;s self-titled 1986 debut album received good reviews in the U.S. entertainment media (&quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine dubbed it &quot;the most auspicious debut album of the year&quot;) and reached No. 87 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. The band made a fan of horror author Stephen King, who quoted the band&#x27;s lyrics in his novels &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; and &quot;Gerald&#x27;s Game&quot;. The album, however, achieved its greatest commercial success overseas. In the United Kingdom, the single &quot;Let My People Go–Go&quot; (a song based on the American Negro spiritual anthem &quot;Go Down Moses&quot;) broke into the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart.

Their follow-up album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Tornado&quot;, peaked at #116 on the U.S. chart. The Rainmakers released one more studio album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Good News and The Bad News&quot;, and one live album, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Oslo-Wichita Live&quot;, which were successful in Europe, but did not chart in the U.S.. The band broke up after the release of the live album, which was only issued in Europe.

Scandinavian interest in their music remained high, and they reformed and released a new album, &quot;Flirting with the Universe,&quot; in 1994. The album achieved the equivalent of gold record status in Norway in one month. Ruth left the band and was replaced by new bassist Michael Bliss, and one more album, &quot;Skin,&quot; followed in 1996. The band issued one further track in 1998, a collaboration with Brewer &amp; Shipley in a new version of &quot;One Toke Over the Line&quot;, before they broke up again.

In 2011, the Rainmakers reformed, with bassist Rich Ruth returning to the group in place of Bliss, while longtime guitarist Steve Phillips was replaced by Jeff Porter. On March 5, the band was inducted into the Kansas Music Hall of Fame, with a ceremony and concert at Liberty Hall in Lawrence, Kansas. The following week, the band&#x27;s album &quot;25 on&quot; was released on March 14. At the end of March, the band returned to Norway for a two-week tour. The band played two shows (May 14–15) at Knuckleheads Saloon in Kansas City.

In 2014, the Rainmakers released the album &quot;Monster Movie&quot;. In June the same year, they performed at the Sweden Rock Festival.

In 2015 they released the album &quot;Cover Band&quot;.

Steve Phillips died in 2020 after contracting COVID-19.

<doc id="873548" wikidata="Q5114659" url="?curid=873548" title="Chrysler Hemi-6 Engine">
<text>The Chrysler Hemi-6 engine is a family of inline six-cylinder petrol engines produced by Chrysler Australia in three piston displacements and multiple configurations. Hemi-6 engines were installed in Australian-market Chrysler Valiants from 1970 through 1981. It was also installed in the Valiants closely related variants, the Chrysler VIP, the Chrysler by Chrysler &amp; the Valiant Charger.

==Development and release==
Chrysler Corporation in the US had been working since 1966 on an inline 6-cylinder engine, called the D-engine, to replace the Slant 6 (G-engine) in Dodge trucks, but abandoned the effort after prototypes were built. This was Chrysler&#x27;s first thin wall (lightweight) cast iron engine design. Chrysler Australia wanted a new six-cylinder engine for use in the Australian Chrysler Valiant, and so Chrysler USA sent a prototype engine to Chrysler Australia&#x27;s engineers to continue developing the D-engine. The first variant was released for the 1970 model year in the VG-model Valiant.

In a major coup for the company, Chrysler Australia&#x27;s ad agency, the Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising Agency in Adelaide, South Australia, secured the services of British racing driver Stirling Moss to promote the new Hemi-6 in 1969. The agency managed to fly Moss to Adelaide in secret for the advertising campaign, surprising Chrysler Australia&#x27;s executives. Young &amp; Rubicam&#x27;s parent company were also the advertising agents for the Chrysler Corporation in the US.

==Engineering and design features==
The Hemi-6 is a pushrod O.H.V. (overhead valve engine), with combustion chambers comprising about 35% of the top of the globe. This creates what is known as a low hemispherical shaped chamber. In this way, the &quot;Hemi&quot; moniker was used for the same kind of marketing cachet as Chrysler&#x27;s 1950s-1970s Hemi V8 engines.

The Hemi-6 valves are angled apart (splayed) 18 degrees (included angle) along the crankshaft axis, and the intake valves are as large as . The 6 intake and 6 exhaust valves open slightly towards each other and away from the cylinder wall, which results in less &quot;shrouding&quot; of the valves and greater airflow potential. In addition, both valves are slightly inclined across the crankshaft axis, similar to a conventional &quot;wedge&quot; chamber. The cylinder head is not a crossflow design, meaning the 6 intake and 6 exhaust ports are on the same side of the engine (the left, Australian and British passenger, side).

Unlike Chrysler&#x27;s contemporaneous hemi V8 engines, the Hemi-6&#x27;s rocker arms are mounted on individual studs (similar to the Chevrolet &quot;big block&quot; V8), rather than on 2 separate rocker shafts as in all 1951-58 Hemis—Dodge, DeSoto, Imperial, and Chrysler &quot;Firepower&quot; and 1964-&#x27;71 Plymouth and Dodge 426 V8s.

All Hemi-6s share a robust crankshaft supported by seven main bearings, and this family of engines quickly developed a reputation for excellent performance, economy, and durability.

The Australian Hemi engines were designed by a five-man team which included the late Maurice Harcus.

==Versions and variants==

===245 cu in (4.0 L)===
The 245 was the initial version of the Hemi-6 engine. It was first used in the 1970 VG-model Valiant, and was available clear through to the final CM model of 1981. Initially, only a single barrel carburettor version was available for Australian built cars but a two barrel version was made especially for the VH and VJ Valiant Ranger XL variants assembled in New Zealand from 1971 to 1975. The two barrel consequently became available in Australia with the VK series update.

Specifications (for 1bbl carbureted variant):
*Bore x Stroke Size: 
*Compression ratio: 9.5:1
*Power: at 4600 rpm
*Torque: at 1800 rpm
*Intake valve head diameter: 
*Exhaust: 

245LC (Low Compression) released in 1977
*Bore x Stroke Size: 
*Compression ratio: 7.6:1
*Power: estimate
*Torque: estimate
*Intake valve head diameter 
*Exhaust valve head diameter 

===265 cu in (4.3 L)===
The was introduced in 1971 in the VH. It used a new cylinder block with a bigger bore diameter of —the same as many of the Chrysler small-block V8s—and a new cylinder head, having slightly more hemispherical shaped combustion chambers with larger valves.

The standard version of the 265 produced at 4600 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm.

The top-of-the-line performance engine in the E49 Chargers produced at 5600 rpm and of torque at 4400 rpm. The increased power is due mainly to a more aggressive camshaft, high-load valve springs, triple DCOE sidedraught Weber carburetors, tuned-length exhaust headers and a higher compression ratio of 10.0:1.

Specifications (for 2bbl carbureted variant):
*Bore x Stroke Size: 
*Compression ratio: 9.5:1
*Power: at 4600 rpm
*Torque: at 2800 rpm
*Intake valve head diameter: 
*Exhaust: 

===215 cu in (3.5 L)===
This economy-orientated version of the Hemi 6 was released as a running change in early 1971 as the base model engine in the VH Valiant. This engine shares the same stroke length as the other engines but has a smaller bore size of and lower compression ratio of 8.0:1. It ran on regular petrol and produced at 4400 rpm and of torque at a low 1800 rpm.

Specifications:
*Bore x Stroke Size: 
*Compression ratio: 8.0:1
*Power: at 4400 rpm
*Torque: at 1800 rpm
*Intake valve head diameter: 
*Exhaust valve head diameter:

<text>Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi (, ; ; ), historically known as Aq Kirmān () or by other names, is a port city in Odesa Oblast, southwestern Ukraine. It is situated on the right bank of the Dniester Estuary leading to the Black Sea, in the historical region of Budjak. It also serves as the administrative center of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi Raion and is coterminous with &quot;Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi urban hromada&quot;, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. It is the location of a large freight seaport. Population: 

== Name ==
The city of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi is also referred to by alternative transliterations from Ukrainian as Bilhorod-Dnistrovsky. &quot;Dnistrovskyi&quot; was added to differentiate it from Belgorod (in Ukrainian Bilhorod), a city in Russia, when both were a part of the Soviet Union.

* Turis, Antes name 
* Asprokastron (, &quot;White Castle&quot;), Greek name in Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Name attested from 944 to 1484 AD.
* Maurokastron (Μαυρόκαστρον, &quot;Black Castle&quot;), Greek name of a Roman/Byzantine fort in Late Antiquity on a site directly opposite Asprokastron, but usually taken together.

* Weißenburg, (&quot;White Castle&quot;), German name
During the reign of Burebista, the city was known as Tyras and was incorporated into the Dacian kingdom. The town became part of the Principality of Moldavia in 1359. The fortress was enlarged and rebuilt in 1407 under Alexander the Good and in 1440 under Stephen II of Moldavia. It fell to Ottoman conquest on August 5, 1487. 

The city became part of Romania from 1918 to 1940, and once again between 1941 and 1944 and is known in Romanian as Cetatea Albă with other languages using the Turkish name, Akkerman, or variations of the Turkish name. Since 1944 the city has been known as &quot;Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi&quot; (Білгород-Дністровський), while on the Soviet geography maps often translated into its Russian equivalent of &quot;Belgorod-Dnestrovskiy&quot; (Белгород-Днестровский), literally &quot;white city on the Dniester&quot;.

The city is known by translations of &quot;white city&quot; or &quot;castle&quot; in a number of languages including Белгород Днестровски (&quot;Belgorod-Dnestrovski&quot;) in Bulgarian, &quot;Akerman&quot; (Акерман) in Gagauz, &quot;Białogród nad Dniestrem&quot; in Polish, &quot;Walachisch Weißenburg&quot; in Transylvanian German, &quot;Dnyeszterfehérvár&quot; in Hungarian and (&quot;Ir Lavan&quot;) in Hebrew.

In Western European languages, including English, the city has typically been known by the official name of the time or a transliteration derived from it.

The city&#x27;s former name &quot;Akkerman&quot; is still extensively used as a nickname in informal speech and in local media.

== History ==

In the 6th century BC, Milesian colonists founded a settlement named Tyras on the future location of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, which later came under Roman and Byzantine rule. In Late Antiquity, the Byzantines built a fortress and named it &quot;Asprokastron&quot; (&quot;White Castle&quot; - a meaning kept in several languages), but it passed out of their control in the 7th-15th centuries under control of Bulgaria, the cities called Belgorod (white city), as it was the border of the Bulgarian empire. 

In the 13th century the site was controlled by the Cumans, and became a center of Genoese commercial activity from on. Briefly held by the Second Bulgarian Empire in the early 14th century, by the middle of the century it was a Genoese colony. Sfântul Ioan cel Nou (&quot;Saint John the New&quot;), the patron saint of Moldavia, was martyred in the city in 1330 during a Tatar incursion. In 1391, Cetatea Albă was the last city on the right bank of the Dnister to be incorporated into the newly established Principality of Moldova, and for the next century was its second major city, the major port and an important fortress.

In 1420, the citadel was attacked for the first time by the Ottomans, but defended successfully by Moldavian Prince Alexander the Kind.

In the 15th century, the port saw much commercial traffic as well as being frequently used for passenger traffic between central Europe and Constantinople. Among the travellers who passed through the town was John VIII Palaiologos. Following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, Sultan Mehmed II brought in colonists from Asprokastron to repopulate the city.

In 1484, along with Kiliia, it was the last of the Black Sea ports to be conquered by the Ottomans. The Moldavian prince Stephen the Great was unable to aid in its defence, being under threat of a Polish invasion. The citadel surrendered when the Ottomans claimed to have reached an agreement with Prince Stephen, and promised safe passage to the inhabitants and their belongings; however, most of the city-dwellers were slaughtered. Later, attempts by Stephen the Great to restore his rule over the area were unsuccessful. Cetatea Albă was subsequently a base from which the Ottomans were able to attack Moldavia proper. In 1485, Tatars setting out from this city founded Pazardzhik in Bulgaria. In 1570 (Hijri 977) the town of Akkerman was inhabited by Muslims, Christians and Jews. It had 55 Muslim households in 25 neighbourhoods and 113 Non-Muslim households in 9 neighbourhoods and it was a &quot;has&quot; of the Sultan, a land property that was directly owned by the Sultan. The castle of Akkerman also had a Jewish congregation and a Roma congregation.

It was established as the fortress of &quot;Akkerman&quot;, part of the Ottoman defensive system against Poland-Lithuania and, later, the Russian Empire. Major battles between the Ottomans and the Russians were fought near Akkerman in 1770 and 1789. Russia conquered the town in 1770, 1774, and 1806, but returned it after the conclusion of hostilities. It was not incorporated into Russia until 1812, when it was annexed, along with the rest of Bessarabia.

On 25 September 1826, Russia and the Ottomans signed here the &quot;Akkerman Convention&quot; which imposed that the hospodars of Moldavia and Wallachia be elected by their respective Divans for seven-year terms, with the approval of both Powers.

The city and the surrounding district became part of the Moldovan Democratic Republic after it proclaimed its independence following the Russian Revolution. The Romanian Army, entered the city on 9 March 1918, fighting with local troops led by the Bolsheviks. Formal integration followed later that month, when the &#x27;Sfatul Țării&#x27; of the Moldovan Democratic Republic proclaimed the whole of Bessarabia united with Romania. 

During the interwar period, the Romanian administration transformed Cetatea-Albă into an important administrative and cultural center of Greater Romania. The city was modernized through the restoration of historic buildings and the construction of new ones in modern styles, such as Neoromanian and Neoclassical. Infrastructure works were carried out, including street paving, the construction of bridges and roads, as well as the development of parks and recreational areas. 

Urban development plans included the creation of new neighborhoods and improvements to infrastructure, making the city more functional and pleasant for its inhabitants.

Romania ceded the city to the Soviet Union on 28 June 1940 following the 1940 Soviet occupation of Bessarabia, that year the name was officially changed to &#x27;Belgorod-Dniestrovski&#x27;. A part of the population (mostly Romanians) was deported into Kazakhstan, into Soviet Gulags. The Romanian state regained it on 28 July 1941 during the invasion of the USSR by the Axis forces in the course of the Second World War and had it within its boundaries until 22 August 1944 when the Red Army reoccupied the city. The Soviets partitioned Bessarabia, creating the Moldovian SSR, taking away its southern flanks and sea access, including Belgorod, which became part of the Ukrainian SSR, and after 1991, nowadays Ukraine.

Until 18 July 2020, Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and the center of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi Municipality. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Odesa Oblast to seven. The area of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi Municipality was merged into Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi Raion.

=== Jewish history ===
In Jewish sources, the city is referred as Weissenburg and Ir Lavan (meaning &quot;white castle&quot; in German and &quot;white city&quot; in Hebrew) as well as Akerman (אַקערמאַן). Karaite Jews lived there since the 16th century, some even claim the existence of Khazar Jews in the town as early as the 10th century. In 1897, 5,613 Jews lived in the city (19.9% of the total population). The town Jewish community was influenced mainly from the Jewish community of nearby Odesa. During a pogrom in 1905, eight Jews living in the city were killed. During World War II, most of the Jews living in the city fled to nearby Odesa, where they were later killed. The 800 Jews who were left in the city were shot to death in the nearby Leman River. The remaining Jews were deported to Transnistria by the Romanian authorities later in 1941, where most of them died. Around 500 of the prewar town Jews survived the war, and around half of them returned to the city.

== Demographics ==
As of 1920, the population was estimated at 35,000. 8,000 were Romanian, 8,000 were Jewish, and 5,000 were German. Additional populations included Turks, Greeks, Bulgarians and Russians.

According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, the majority of the city&#x27;s population are Ukrainians (62.88%). Other communities include Russians (28.25%), Bulgarians (3.72%), Moldovans (1.89%), Gagauz (0.41%) and Romanians (0.02%). The language situation is notably different, with self-identified Russian-speakers representing a majority (54.52%), followed by speakers of Ukrainian (42.08%), Bulgarian (1.66%), Moldovan (0.67%) and Gagauz (0.19%).

<text>William Carey (17 August 1761 – 9 June 1834) was an English Christian missionary, Particular Baptist minister, translator, social reformer and cultural anthropologist who founded the Serampore College and the Serampore University, the first degree-awarding university in India and cofounded the Serampore Mission Press.

He went to Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1793, but was forced to leave the British Indian territory by non-Baptist Christian missionaries. He joined the Baptist missionaries in the Danish colony of Frederiksnagore in Serampore. One of his first contributions was to start schools for impoverished children where they were taught reading, writing, accounting and Christianity. He opened the first theological university in Serampore offering divinity degrees, and campaigned to end the practice of sati.

Carey is known as the &quot;father of modern missions.&quot; His essay, &quot;An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens&quot;, led to the founding of the Baptist Missionary Society. The Asiatic Society commended Carey for &quot;his eminent services in opening the stores of Indian literature to the knowledge of Europe and for his extensive acquaintance with the science, the natural history and botany of this country and his useful contributions, in every branch.&quot;

He translated the Hindu classic, the Ramayana, into English, and the Bible into Bengali, Punjabi, Oriya, Assamese, Marathi, Hindi and Sanskrit. William Carey has been called a reformer and illustrious Christian missionary.

==Early life==

William Carey, the oldest of five children, was born to Edmund and Elizabeth Carey, who were weavers by trade, in the hamlet of Pury End in the parish of Paulerspury, Northamptonshire. William was raised in the Church of England; when he was six, his father was appointed the parish clerk and village schoolmaster. As a child he was inquisitive and keenly interested in the natural sciences, particularly botany. He possessed a natural gift for language, teaching himself Latin.

At the age of 14, Carey&#x27;s father apprenticed him to a cordwainer in the nearby village of Piddington, Northamptonshire. His master, Clarke Nichols, was a churchman like himself, but another apprentice, John Warr, was a Dissenter. Through his influence Carey would leave the Church of England and join with other Dissenters to form a small Congregational church in nearby Hackleton. While apprenticed to Nichols, he also taught himself Greek with the help of Thomas Jones, a local weaver who had received a classical education.

When Nichols died in 1779, Carey went to work for the local shoemaker, Thomas Old; he married Old&#x27;s sister-in-law Dorothy Plackett in 1781 in the Church of St John the Baptist, Piddington. Unlike William, Dorothy was illiterate; her signature in the marriage register is a crude cross. William and Dorothy Carey had seven children, five sons and two daughters; both girls died in infancy, as did son Peter, who died at the age of 5. Thomas Old himself died soon afterward, and Carey took over his business, during which time he taught himself Hebrew, Italian, Dutch, and French, often reading while working on the shoes.

Carey acknowledged his humble origins and referred to himself as a cobbler. John Brown Myers titled his biography of Carey &quot;William Carey the Shoemaker Who Became the Father and Founder of Modern Missions&quot;.

==Founding of the Baptist Missionary Society==

Carey became involved with a local association of Particular Baptists that had recently formed, where he became acquainted with men such as John Ryland, John Sutcliff, and Andrew Fuller, who would become his close friends in later years. They invited him to preach in their church in the nearby village of Earls Barton every other Sunday. On 5 October 1783, William Carey was baptised by Ryland and committed himself to the Baptist denomination.
In 1785, Carey was appointed the schoolmaster for the village of Moulton. He was also invited to serve as pastor to the local Baptist church. During this time he read Jonathan Edwards&#x27; &quot;Account of the Life of the Late Rev. David Brainerd&quot; and the journals of the explorer James Cook, and became concerned with propagating the Christian Gospel throughout the world. John Eliot (c. 1604 – 21 May 1690), Puritan missionary in New England, and David Brainerd (1718–47) became the &quot;canonized heroes&quot; and &quot;enkindlers&quot; of Carey.

In 1789 Carey, became the full-time pastor of Harvey Lane Baptist Church in Leicester. Three years later, in 1792, he published his groundbreaking missionary manifesto, &quot;An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens&quot;. This short book consists of five parts. The first part is a theological justification for missionary activity, arguing that the command of Jesus to make disciples of all the world (Matthew 28:18-20) remains binding on Christians.

The second part outlines a history of missionary activity, beginning with the early Church and ending with David Brainerd and John Wesley.

Part 3 comprises 26 pages of tables, listing area, population, and religion statistics for every country in the world. Carey had compiled these figures during his years as a schoolteacher. The fourth part answers objections to sending missionaries, such as difficulty learning the language or danger to life. Finally, the fifth part calls for the formation by the Baptist denomination of a missionary society and describes the practical means by which it could be supported. Carey&#x27;s seminal pamphlet outlines his basis for missions: Christian obligation, wise use of available resources, and accurate information.

Carey later preached a pro-missionary sermon (the Deathless Sermon), using Isaiah 54:2–3 as his text, in which he repeatedly used the epigram which has become his most famous quotation: 
Carey finally overcame the resistance to missionary effort, and the Particular Baptist Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Amongst the Heathen (subsequently the Baptist Missionary Society and since 2000 BMS World Mission) was founded in October 1792, including Carey, Andrew Fuller, John Ryland, and John Sutcliff as charter members. They then concerned themselves with practical matters such as raising funds, as well as deciding where they would direct their efforts. A medical missionary, Dr John Thomas, had been in Calcutta and was in England raising funds; they agreed to support him and that Carey would accompany him to India.

==Missionary life in India==

Carey, his eldest son Felix, Thomas and his wife and daughter sailed from London aboard a British ship in April 1793. Dorothy Carey had refused to leave England, being pregnant with their fourth son and having never been more than a few miles from home; but before they left they asked her again to come with them and she gave consent, with the knowledge that her sister Kitty would help her give birth. En route they were delayed at the Isle of Wight, at which time the captain of the ship received word that he endangered his command if he conveyed the missionaries to Calcutta, as their unauthorised journey violated the trade monopoly of the British East India Company. He decided to sail without them, and they were delayed until June when Thomas found a Danish captain willing to offer them passage. In the meantime, Carey&#x27;s wife, who had by now given birth, agreed to accompany him provided her sister came as well. They landed at Calcutta in November.

During the first year in Calcutta, the missionaries sought means to support themselves and a place to establish their mission. They also began to learn the Bengali language to communicate with others. A friend of Thomas owned two indigo factories and needed managers, so Carey moved with his family west to Midnapore. During the six years that Carey managed the indigo plant, he completed the first revision of his Bengali New Testament and began formulating the principles upon which his missionary community would be formed, including communal living, financial self-reliance, and the training of indigenous ministers. His son Peter died of dysentery, which, along with other causes of stress, resulted in Dorothy suffering a nervous breakdown from which she never recovered.

Meanwhile, the missionary society had begun sending more missionaries to India. The first to arrive was John Fountain, who arrived in Midnapore and began teaching. He was followed by William Ward, a printer; Joshua Marshman, a schoolteacher; David Brunsdon, one of Marshman&#x27;s students; and William Grant, who died three weeks after his arrival. Because the East India Company was still hostile to missionaries, they settled in the Danish colony in Serampore and were joined there by Carey on 10 January 1800.

===Late Indian period===

Once settled in Serampore, the mission bought a house large enough to accommodate all of their families and a school, which was to be their principal means of support. Ward set up a print shop with a secondhand press Carey had acquired and began the task of printing the Bible in Bengali. In August 1800 Fountain died of dysentery. By the end of that year, the mission had their first convert, a Hindu named Krishna Pal. They had also earned the goodwill of the local Danish government and Richard Wellesley, then Governor-General of India.

In May 1799 William Ward and Hannah and Joshua Marshman arrived from England and joined Carey in his work. The three men became known as the Serampore trio.

The conversion of Hindus to Christianity posed a new question for the missionaries concerning whether it was appropriate for converts to retain their caste. In 1802, the daughter of Krishna Pal, a Sudra, married a Brahmin. This wedding was a public demonstration that the church repudiated the caste distinctions.

Brunsdon and Thomas died in 1801. The same year, the Governor-General founded Fort William College, a college intended to educate civil servants. He offered Carey the position of professor of Bengali. Carey&#x27;s colleagues at the college included pundits, whom he could consult to correct his Bengali testament. One of his colleagues was Madan Mohan who taught him the Sanskrit language. He also wrote grammars of Bengali and Sanskrit, and began a translation of the Bible into Sanskrit. He also used his influence with the Governor-General to help put a stop to the practices of infant sacrifice and suttee, after consulting with the pundits and determining that they had no basis in the Hindu sacred writings (although the latter would not be abolished until 1829).

Dorothy Carey died in 1807. Due to her debilitating mental breakdown, she had long since ceased to be an able member of the mission, and her condition was an additional burden to it. John Marshman wrote how Carey worked away on his studies and translations, &quot;…while an insane wife, frequently wrought up to a state of most distressing excitement, was in the next room…&quot;.

Several friends and colleagues had urged William to commit Dorothy to an asylum. But he recoiled at the thought of the treatment she might receive in such a place and took the responsibility to keep her within the family home, even though the children were exposed to her rages.

In 1808 Carey remarried. His new wife Charlotte Rhumohr, a Danish member of his church was, unlike Dorothy, Carey&#x27;s intellectual equal. They were married for 13 years until her death.

From the printing press at the mission came translations of the Bible in Bengali, Sanskrit, and other major languages and dialects. Many of these languages had never been printed before; William Ward had to create punches for the type by hand. Carey had begun translating literature and sacred writings from the original Sanskrit into English to make them accessible to his own countryman. On 11 March 1812, a fire in the print shop caused £10,000 in damages and lost work. Among the losses were many irreplaceable manuscripts, including much of Carey&#x27;s translation of Sanskrit literature and a polyglot dictionary of Sanskrit and related languages, which would have been a seminal philological work had it been completed. However, the press itself and the punches were saved, and the mission was able to continue printing in six months. In Carey&#x27;s lifetime, the mission printed and distributed the Bible in whole or part in 44 languages and dialects.

Also, in 1812, Adoniram Judson, an American Congregational missionary en route to India, studied the scriptures on baptism in preparation for a meeting with Carey. His studies led him to become a Baptist. Carey&#x27;s urging of American Baptists to take over support for Judson&#x27;s mission, led to the foundation in 1814 of the first American Baptist Mission board, the &quot;General Missionary Convention of the Baptist Denomination in the United States of America for Foreign Missions&quot;, later commonly known as the Triennial Convention. Most American Baptist denominations of today are directly or indirectly descended from this convention.
In 1818, the mission founded Serampore College to train indigenous ministers for the growing church and to provide education in the arts and sciences to anyone regardless of caste or country. Frederick VI, King of Denmark, granted a royal charter in 1827 that made the college a degree-granting institution, the first in Asia.

In 1820 Carey founded the Agri Horticultural Society of India at Alipore, Calcutta, supporting his enthusiasm for botany. When William Roxburgh went on leave, Carey was entrusted to maintain the Botanical Garden at Calcutta. The genus &quot;Careya&quot; was named after him.

Carey&#x27;s second wife, Charlotte, died in 1821, followed by his eldest son Felix. In 1823 he married a third time, to a widow named Grace Hughes.

Internal dissent and resentment was growing within the Missionary Society as its numbers grew, the older missionaries died, and they were replaced by less experienced men. Some new missionaries arrived who were not willing to live in the communal fashion that had developed, one going so far as to demand &quot;a separate house, stable and servants.&quot; Unused to the rigorous work ethic of Carey, Ward, and Marshman, the new missionaries thought their seniors - particularly Marshman - to be dictatorial, assigning them work not to their liking.

Andrew Fuller, who had been secretary of the Society in England, had died in 1815, and his successor, John Dyer, was a bureaucrat who attempted to reorganise the Society along business lines and manage every detail of the Serampore mission from England. Their differences proved to be irreconcilable, and Carey formally severed ties with the missionary society he had founded, leaving the mission property and moving onto the college grounds. He lived a quiet life until his death in 1834, revising his Bengali Bible, preaching, and teaching students. The couch on which he died, on 9 June 1834, is now housed at Regent&#x27;s Park College, the Baptist hall of the University of Oxford.

===Life in India===
Much of what is known about Carey&#x27;s activities in India is from missionary reports sent back home. Historians such as Comaroffs, Thorne, Van der Veer and Brian Pennington note that the representation of India in these reports must be examined in their context and with care for its evangelical and colonial ideology. The reports by Carey were conditioned by his background, personal factors and his own religious beliefs. The polemic notes and observations of Carey, and his colleague William Ward, were in a community suffering from extreme poverty and epidemics, and they constructed a view of the culture of India and Hinduism in light of their missionary goals. These reports were by those who had declared their conviction in foreign missionary work, and the letters describe experiences of foreigners who were resented by both the Indian populace as well as European officials and competing Christian groups. Their accounts of culture and Hinduism were forged in Bengal that was physically, politically and spiritually difficult to preach in. Pennington summarises the accounts reported by Carey and his colleagues as follows,

Carey recommended that his fellow Anglo-Indians learn and interpret Sanskrit in a manner &quot;compatible with colonial aims&quot;, writing that &quot;to gain the ear of those who are thus deceived, it is necessary for them to believe that the speaker has a superior knowledge of the subject. In these circumstances, knowledge of Sanskrit is valuable.&quot; According to Indian historian V. Rao, Carey lacked tolerance, understanding and respect for Indian culture, with him describing Indian music as &quot;disgusting&quot; and bringing to mind practices &quot;dishonorable&quot; to God. Such attitudes affected the literature authored by Carey and his colleagues.

==Family history==
Biographies of Carey, such as those by F. D. Walker and J. B. Myers, only allude to Carey&#x27;s distress caused by the mental illness and subsequent breakdown suffered by his wife, Dorothy, in the early years of their ministry in India. More recently, Beck&#x27;s biography of Dorothy Carey paints a more detailed picture: William Carey uprooted his family from all that was familiar and sought to settle them in one of the most unlikely and difficult cultures in the world for an uneducated 18th-century British working-class woman. Faced with enormous difficulties in adjusting to all this change, she failed to make the adjustment emotionally and ultimately, mentally, and her husband seemed unable to help her. Carey even wrote to his sisters in England on 5 October 1795, &quot;I have been for some time past in danger of losing my life. Jealousy is the great evil that haunts her mind.&quot;

Dorothy&#x27;s mental breakdown (&quot;at the same time William Carey was baptizing his first Indian convert and his son Felix, his wife was forcefully confined to her room, raving with madness&quot;) led inevitably to other family problems. Joshua Marshman was appalled by Carey&#x27;s neglect of his four boys when he first met them in 1800. Aged 4, 7, 12 and 15, they were unmannered, undisciplined, and uneducated.

==Eschatology==
Besides Iain Murray&#x27;s study, &quot;The Puritan Hope&quot;, less attention has been paid in Carey&#x27;s numerous biographies to his postmillennial eschatology as expressed in his major missionary manifesto, notably not even in Bruce J. Nichols&#x27;s article &quot;The Theology of William Carey.&quot; Carey was a Calvinist.&quot; and a postmillennialist. Even the two dissertations that discuss his achievements (by Oussoren and Potts) ignore large areas of his theology. Neither mentions his eschatological views, which played a major role in his missionary zeal. One exception, in James Beck&#x27;s biography of his first wife, mentions his personal optimism in the chapter on &quot;Attitudes Towards the Future,&quot; but not his optimistic perspective on world missions, which derived from postmillennial theology.

==Translation, education, and schools==

Carey devoted great efforts and time to the study not only of the common language of Bengali, but to many other Indian vernaculars, and the ancient root language of Sanskrit. In collaboration with the College of Fort William, Carey undertook the translation of the Hindu classics into English, beginning with the Ramayana. He then translated the Bible into Bengali, Oriya, Marathi, Hindi, Assamese, and Sanskrit, and parts of it into other dialects and languages. For 30 years Carey served in the college as the professor of Bengali, Sanskrit and Marathi, publishing, in 1805, the first book on Marathi grammar.

The Serampore Mission Press that Carey founded is credited as the only press that &quot;consistently thought it important enough that costly fonts of type be cast for the irregular and neglected languages of the Indian people.&quot;. Carey and his team produced textbooks, dictionaries, classical literature, and other publications that served primary school children, college-level students, and the general public, including the first systematic Sanskrit grammar, which served a model for later publications.

In the latter 1700s and early 1800s in India, only children of certain social strata received education, and even that was limited to basic accounting and Hindu religion. Only the Brahmins and writer castes could read, and only men, women being completely unschooled. Carey started Sunday Schools in which children learned to read using the Bible as their textbook. In 1794, he opened, at his own cost, what is considered the first primary school in India. The public school system that Carey initiated expanded to include girls in an era when the education of the female was considered unthinkable. Carey&#x27;s work is considered to have started what became the Christian Vernacular Education Society, providing English medium education across India.

==Legacy==
Carey spent 41 years in India without a furlough. His mission included about 700 converts in a nation of millions, but he had laid an impressive foundation of Bible translations, education, and social reform. He has been called the &quot;father of modern missions&quot; and &quot;India&#x27;s first cultural anthropologist.&quot;

His teaching, translations, writings and publications, his educational establishments and influence in social reform are said to have &quot;marked the turning point of Indian culture from a downward to an upward trend&quot;. 
Carey was instrumental in launching Serampore College in Serampore.

Carey&#x27;s passionate insistence on change resulted in the founding of the Baptist Missionary Society.

Many schools are named after him: 

*William Carey Christian School (WCCS) in Sydney, NSW 
*William Carey International University, founded in 1876 in Pasadena, California 
*Carey Theological College in Vancouver, British Columbia

==Artefacts==
St James Church in Paulerspury, Northamptonshire, where Carey was christened and attended as a boy, has a William Carey display. Carey Baptist Church in Moulton, Northamptonshire, also has a display of artefacts related to William Carey, as well as the nearby cottage where he lived.

In Leicester, Harvey Lane Baptist Church, the last church in England where Carey served before he left for India, was destroyed by a fire in 1921. Carey&#x27;s nearby cottage had served as a Memories of Carey museum from 1915 until it was destroyed to make way for a new road system in 1968. Artefacts from the museum were given to Central Baptist Church in Charles Street, Leicester which houses the William Carey Museum.

Angus Library and Archive in Oxford holds the largest single collection of Carey letters as well as numerous artefacts such as his Bible and the sign from his cordwainer shop. There is a large collection of historical artefacts including letters, books, and other artefacts that belonged to Carey at the Center for Study of the Life and Work of William Carey at Donnell Hall on the William Carey University Hattiesburg campus.

<doc id="873557" wikidata="Q14328920" url="?curid=873557" title="National Special Security Event">
<text>A National Special Security Event (NSSE) is an event of national or international significance deemed by the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to be a potential target for terrorism or other criminal activity. These events have included summits of world leaders, meetings of international organizations, presidential nominating conventions and presidential inaugurations. NSSE designation requires federal agencies to provide full cooperation and support to ensure the safety and security of those participating in or otherwise attending the event, and the community within which the event takes place, and is typically limited to specific event sites for a specified time frame.

An NSSE places the United States Secret Service as the lead agency in charge of the planning, coordination, and implementation of security operations for the event, the Federal Bureau of Investigation in charge of intelligence, counterterrorism, and investigation of major criminal activities associated with the event, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency in charge of recovery management in the aftermath of terrorism, major criminal activities, natural disasters, or other catastrophic incidents following the event. Like the FBI and FEMA, the Secret Service brings in local law enforcement, public safety, and military experts to assist with developing the plan, and give them the special guidance and training to operate within the security plan. NSSE designation is not a funding mechanism, and currently there is no specific federal &quot;pot of money&quot; to be distributed to state and local governments within whose jurisdiction NSSEs take place.

==Authority==
NSSE procedures were established by President Bill Clinton in a portion of Presidential Decision Directive 62 in May 1998, which set out the security roles for federal agencies at major events. The Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000 (, signed into law on 2000-12-19) added special events explicitly to the powers of the United States Secret Service in .

==Procedure==
A number of factors are taken into consideration when designating an event as a National Special Security Event. Department of Homeland Security press releases usually cite the following factors:

*Anticipated attendance by dignitaries. Events attended by officials of the United States government or foreign dignitaries may create an independent federal interest to ensure that the event transpires without incident and that sufficient resources are brought to bear in the event of an incident.
*Size of the event. A large number of attendees and participants generally increases security requirements. In addition, larger events are more likely to draw the attention of terrorists or other criminals, particularly those interested in employing weapons of mass destruction.
*Significance of the event. Some events have historical, political, cultural, or other symbolic significance that may heighten concern about possible terrorist acts or other criminal activity.
*Duration of the event. State and local law enforcement and public safety agencies may possess the manpower and other resources to provide adequate security for a major event within their jurisdiction (e.g. World Series, NASCAR race, Super Bowl, televised awards show), but unable to do so for events over several days or weeks and at the same time continue to meet routine obligations in the greater community.
*Availability of state and local resources. When state and local jurisdictions lack the expertise, experience, manpower or other assets needed to ensure comprehensive protection of these major events of national or international significance.
*Multiplicity of Jurisdictions. Extensive coordination of law enforcement and public safety agencies from multiple jurisdictions.
*Threat assessments. Anticipation of terrorism, or extensive illegal civil disobedience or other criminal activity.

Typical NSSE security measures include:

* Interagency coordination and interoperability
* Heavy police (days off and leaves may be canceled) and often National Guard presence
* Police dogs for bomb detection
* Surveillance
* WMD detection, mitigation, and decontamination
* Sharpshooters and other tactical capabilities
* Flight restrictions around the area
* United States Coast Guard patrols
* Increased railroad security
* Extensive road closures
* When applicable members of Joint Task Force - Civil Support and the Chemical Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF) are deployed

The Secret Service notes that since the &quot;Presidential Protection Act of 2000 became public law...the Secret Service is authorized to participate in the planning, coordination and implementation of security operations at special events of national significance...[and that] when an event is designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security as a National Special Security Event (NSSE), the Secret Service assumes its mandated role as the lead agency for the design and implementation of the operational security plan...The goal of the cooperating agencies is to provide a safe and secure environment for Secret Service protectees, other dignitaries, the event participants and the general public. There is a tremendous amount of advance planning and coordination in preparation for these events.&quot;

==Events==
 paragraph (e)(2) requires that, at the end of each federal fiscal year, the executive branch report to Congress which events were designated NSSEs, and what criteria were used to make the designations.

Typical types of NSSEs are state funerals, major political conventions, and the State of the Union addresses. The table below lists some NSSEs since enactment of the relevant statute.

<text>Șimleu Silvaniei (; , ) is a town in Sălaj County, Crișana, Romania with a population of 13,948 people (2021 census). It is located near the ancient Dacian fortress Dacidava.

Three villages are administered by the town: Bic (&quot;Bükk&quot;), Cehei (&quot;Somlyócsehi&quot;), and Pusta (&quot;Csehipuszta&quot;).

== History ==
=== Ancient times ===

Before the Roman conquest of Dacia, Șimleu was a political, social and administrative Dacian centre, of high importance. Seven Dacian fortresses, some with associated settlements, were arranged in an arc shape around the hills of Șimleu. They had a strategic role in supervising the trade along the salt road coming from areas around Napoca, Potaissa, and modern Dej, and heading to Pannonia.

The centre of an early &quot;Gepidia&quot;, on the plains northwest of the Meseș Mountains, appears to have been located around Șimleu Silvaniei, where early 5th-century precious objects of Roman provenance have been unearthed.

===Middle Ages===
The town was mentioned in 1258 as &quot;Wathasomlyowa.&quot; The name means &quot;Wata&#x27;s mountain&quot;; the name Wata is of Old Turkish origin, while &quot;somlyowa&quot; is an archaic Hungarian word for mountain(side).

The town belonged to the Báthory family, whose ancestral castle stood here. The castle was built by Miklós, voivode of Transylvania in the early 13th century and was first mentioned in 1319. After the Báthory family built a mansion in the town in 1592, the castle became deserted and today lies in ruins.

The Catholic church was built in 1534 by Transylvania&#x27;s voivode Báthory István and his wife Telegdy Katalin with the occasion of their son&#x27;s birth. Holy Trinity Statue was built in 1772. The Reformed church was rebuilt between 1729 and 1736. The synagogue was built in 1876.

The mansion was occupied by Giorgio Basta from Zsigmond Báthory in 1600. It was occupied by the Ottomans in 1660 and was part of Varat Eyalet until 1692. In 1703 it was occupied by Kurucs.

From 1876 to 1920, Șimleu Silvaniei was part of the Szilágy County of the Kingdom of Hungary.

The Greek Catholic Vicariate of Șimleu Silvaniei was formed in 1910 and in 1817 the vicariate opened its own school. George Tatu (1810-1824), Georgiu Abraham (1824-1828), Isidor Alpini (1828-1835), Alexandru Sterca-Șuluțiu (1836-1850), Demetriu Coroianu (1850-1873), Alimpiu Barboloviciu (1873-1914), Alexandru Ghetie (1914-1922), Emil Bran (1926-1932), Petru Cupcea (1932-1940), Cornel Darabant (1940-1945), Gheorghe Țurcaș (2004-2009) served as vicars of Șimleu Silvaniei. The old Greek Catholic church was destroyed by a storm in 1866. Notre Dame Church was built between 1871 and 1873.

In 1919, the Simion Bărnuțiu National College, the first Romanian language high school in Sălaj County was founded here, and today the town is home to three high schools.

In 1940, Șimleu Silvaniei, along with the rest of Northern Transylvania, was given to Hungary through the Second Vienna Award imposed by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy; Romania regained the area in 1944.

Since 1997, inside Bic Monastery, there is the wooden church from Stâna; built in 1778 it has a rectangular plan with nave and pronave.

==Holocaust==

The Cehei ghetto operated within the town&#x27;s administrative area. The ghetto was one of the Nazi-era ghettos for European Jews during World War II. It was active in the spring of 1944, following Operation Margarethe. The deportations from Cehei took place in three transports: May 31 (3,106), June 3 (3,161) and June 6 (1,584), with a total of 7,851 Jews sent to Auschwitz. Some 1,200 Sălaj Jews survived the Holocaust but later emigrated from Romania, so that by the 2000s, under fifty Jews remained in the county.

After the dissolution of the principality of Transylvania in 1867 and its direct integration into the Austro-Hungarian Empire as part of Hungary (&quot;see the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867&quot;), the city is attached to Szilágy County in 1876. In 1918, during the disintegration of the empire at the end of World War I, the city became part of the Kingdom of Romania.

From 1940 to 1944 it was annexed by Hungary as a result of the Second Vienna Award. In May 1944, its Jewish community was exterminated by the Nazis during several deportations to Auschwitz.

At the end of World War II, the city was incorporated into Romania again.

The city has long been an agricultural center. In 1968, during the country&#x27;s administrative reorganization, it acquired city status and then industrialization take place (textiles, furniture).

==Historic sites and monuments==

=== Hungarian Reformed Church of Cehu-Silvaniei ===
Probably members of two families, Miklós Drágffy and his wife, and Eufémia Jakcs or their son, Bertalan, later voivod of Transylvania (1493–98) built the church somewhere in the middle of the second half of the 15th century. Governor Drágffy János (1525–26) was an important patron of the church: he made some changes on the church in 1519, and had a lombard-patterned renaissance sedile made for it in 1522.

In 1614, due to the generosity of Prépostváry Zsigmond and his wife Széchy Katalin, the rules of the market-town then, the tower at the western façade is built, as shown by the escutcheoned memorial tablet on its southern wall.
The medieval nave is enlarged in 1801, and then 1905, with square side-aisles and the interior gets a classicist proportions. This church is a national monument classified with number SJ-II-m-A-05034.

===Jewish cemetery===
The Jewish cemetery is located at Cehu Silvaniei, Cloșca Str. no. 8, Sălaj County, 249.1 miles NNW of Bucharest and from Zalău. 

The 1850 Jewish population by census was 63, in 1857 was 66, in 1880 was 206, in 1900 was 369, in 1910 was 517, and in 1930 was 551. In May 1944, the Jews were gathered in the ghetto that the Nazis and their collaborators set up near Cehu Silvaniei (the Cehei ghetto, outside Șimleu Silvaniei), and on May 31 and June 6, 8 they were deported to Auschwitz. The unlandmarked Orthodox cemetery was established in the 19th century. The last known burial was in the 20th century.

The isolated suburban flat land has no sign or marker. Reached via private road, access is open with permission. A fence with a gate that locks surrounds the site. Approximate 1-20 stones are visible, some not in original location with 25%-50% of the stones being toppled or broken. The location of the stones that have been removed from the cemetery is unknown. Vegetation overgrowth in the cemetery is a seasonal problem preventing access. Water drainage is good all year. There are no special sections.

The oldest known gravestone dates from the 19th century. The 19th and 20th century marble, granite, sandstone, and limestone boulders, flat and shaped, smoothed and inscribed, carved relief decorated gravestones have Hebrew inscriptions. Some have traces of painting on their surfaces. No known mass graves. The national Jewish community owns the property used for Jewish cemetery only. Adjacent properties are residential. The cemetery maintenance worked on the re-erection of stones, patching broken stones, cleaning stones, and clearing vegetation. Current care involves occasional clearing or cleaning of the cemetery by unpaid individuals. There are no structures.

==Natives==
* Alexandru Koller (born 1953), football player, businessman
* Agi Mishol (born 1947), Israeli poet
* Iosif Șilimon (1918–1981), aircraft designer

<text>Sergei Vasilyevich Avdeyev (Сергей Васильевич Авдеев; born 1 January 1956) is a former Russian engineer and cosmonaut.

Avdeyev was born in Chapayevsk, Samara Oblast (formerly Kuybyshev Oblast), Russian SFSR. He graduated from Moscow Engineering Physics Institute in 1979 as an engineer-physicist . From 1979 to 1987 he worked as an engineer for NPO Energiya. He was selected as a cosmonaut as part of the Energia Engineer Group 9 on 26 March 1987. His basic cosmonaut training was from December 1987 through to July 1989. He retired as a cosmonaut on 14 February 2003.

Avdeyev at one point held the record for cumulative time spent in space with 747.59 days in Earth orbit, accumulated through three tours of duty aboard the Mir Space Station. He has orbited the Earth 11,968 times traveling about 515,000,000 kilometers. In August 2005, this record was taken by another cosmonaut, Sergei K. Krikalev; it has since been surpassed by other cosmonauts, the current record holder being Oleg Kononenko since February 2024.

Avdeyev is married with two children. He is an amateur radio operator, and his call sign is RV3DW.

==Time dilation record==

For a long time, Avdeyev held the record for time dilation experienced by a human being. In his 747 days aboard Mir, cumulative across three missions, he went approximately 27,360 km/h and thus aged roughly 0.02 seconds (20 milliseconds) slower from an Earthbound person&#x27;s perspective, which is considerably more than any other human being, except Sergei Krikalev. This is due to the special relativistic effect of time dilation and is not properly thought of as time travelling as described by mainstream culture. A common misconception is that the Apollo program astronauts hold the record—they did go faster than Avdeyev, but they were only in space for a few days.

<text>The 11th [[IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics]] under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) was held in Moscow from March 10 to March 12, 2006 in the Olimpiyski Sport arena.

The announcement by the IAAF in November 2003 was a blow to Madrid, which was also in the running to hold the event but Spain had already held the competition twice. This was the first major senior athletics competition to be held in the country since the highly boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics.

The majority of athletes from Great Britain, Australia and Jamaica, amongst other countries, did not attend the Championships, due to the coinciding 2006 Commonwealth Games.

† Tatyana Kotova was the original winner with 7.00m, but was stripped of the title in 2013 after retested samples from the 2005 World Championships found her to have been doping. All her results from August 2005 to July 2007 were subsequently annulled.

<doc id="873580" wikidata="Q466075" url="?curid=873580" title="Pavel Vinogradov">
<text>Pavel Vladimirovich Vinogradov (; born 31 August 1953 in Magadan, USSR) is a former cosmonaut and commander of the International Space Station. He has flown into space three times, aboard Mir and the International Space Station, and was one of the top 10 astronauts in terms of total time in space after his third spaceflight. Vinogradov has also conducted seven spacewalks in his cosmonaut career, and holds the record for the oldest person to perform a spacewalk.

== Personal ==
Vinogradov is married to Irina Valentinovna Vinogradova (née Zakharova); they have one child. His hobbies include game sports, history of aviation and cosmonautics and astronomy.

== Education ==
Vinogradov graduated from Moscow Aviation Institute in 1977.

== Awards ==
Vinogradov was awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation medal.

== Experience ==
From 1977 to 1983 Vinogradov specialized in software development for automated interactive designing systems of recoverable vehicles, development of aerodynamics and aerodyne arrangement design models, computer graphics. In 1983 he started working for the Head Design Bureau of RSC Energia. He worked on flight procedure verification for Soyuz-TM and Buran spacecraft, development of automated crew training systems. He has also participated in launch preparation of the Soyuz-TM, Buran spacecraft and Energia rocket.

==Spaceflight experience==

He was selected for the cosmonaut program on 3 March 1992 and spent the next two years in training. From October 1992 to February 1994, he completed generic space training at GCTC. From May 1994 to February 1995, he completed advanced test-cosmonaut training. Vinogradov was the backup flight engineer for the Soyuz TM-22 flight, launched on 3 September 1995. He was assigned to the Soyuz TM-24 flight, but the entire crew was grounded when the flight commander, Gennadi Manakov, experienced heart problems.

=== Soyuz TM-26 ===
Vinogradov flew as the flight engineer on Soyuz TM-26 on 5 August 1997 with cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev to the Mir space station. After two days of autonomous flight the Soyuz spacecraft docked with Mir on 7 August. The crew repaired the power cable and harness/connectors in the severely damaged &quot;Spektr&quot; module and restored much of the lost power. They also repaired and replaced the oxygen generators in Mir. Vinogradov, Solovyev along and ESA astronaut Léopold Eyharts returned to Earth on 19 February 1998. The Soyuz capsule landed 30 km of Arkalyk at 09:10 UTC. During the mission, Vinogradov spent 197 days, 17 hours, and 34 minutes in space.

=== Expedition 13 ===

In January 2004, Vinogradov began training as the ISS Expedition 13 crew commander. The mission was launched aboard the Soyuz TMA-8 with Vinogradov and NASA astronaut Jeffrey Williams from the Baikonour Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 29 March 2006. Vinogradov served as the Soyuz commander. After two days of solo flight, Soyuz TMA-8 docked with the ISS on 31 March 2006. During their mission, Vinogradov and Williams hosted two NASA shuttle crews during their stay on board the ISS. visited the ISS between 6–15 July 2006. The main purposes of STS-121 were to test new safety and repair techniques introduced following the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster as well as to deliver supplies, equipment and ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter from Germany to the ISS. Space Shuttle brought the P3/P4 truss and its solar wings to the ISS during its STS-115 mission from September 9 to 21. The Soyuz capsule carrying Vinogradov undocked from the ISS at 5:53 p.m. EDT on 28 September 2006, and landed in the steppes of Kazakhstan near Arkalyk at 9:13 p.m. EDT. Vinogradov was joined by NASA astronaut Jeffrey Williams and Spaceflight Participant Anousheh Ansari. Vinogradov spent 182 days, 23 hours and 44 minutes in space on board the Soyuz spacecraft and the ISS.

=== Expeditions 35 and 36 ===
Pavel flew with ISS Expeditions 35 and 36, from March to September 2013.
On 12 May 2013 Pavel assumed command of the International Space Station.

=== Spacewalks ===
Vinogradov has conducted seven spacewalks during his cosmonaut career. Five of these spacewalks were in 1997 and 1998 during his stay on board the Mir space station. His EVA time through seven spacewalks is 38 hours and 25 minutes.

On 22 August 1997 Vinogradov completed his first career spacewalk. He and fellow cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyov began their spacewalk at 11:14 UTC. During the excursion the two spacewalkers, connect power cables, inspected damage on the &quot;Spektr&quot; module and retrieved equipment. The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 16 minutes.

On 20 October 1997 Vinogradov conducted his second career spacewalk inside the &quot;Spektr&quot; module, with Anatoly Solovyov. The duo began their spacewalk at 09:40 UTC. The spacewalk ended at 16:18 UTC. The duration of the spacewalk was 6 hours and 38 minutes.

On 3 November 1997 Vinogradov completed his third career spacewalk, again with Anatoly Solovyov. The two dismantled solar panels and deployed Sputnik 40. The spacewalk began at 03:32 UTC and ended at 09:36 UTC. The excursion lasted 6 hours and 4 minutes.

On 6 November 1997 Vinogradov completed his fourth career spacewalk, again with Anatoly Solovyov. The two spent the entire EVA installing solar panels. The spacewalk began at 00:12 UTC and ended at 06:24 UTC. The excursion lasted 6 hours and 12 minutes.

On 8 January 1998 Vinogradov completed his fifth career spacewalk, again with Anatoly Solovyov. The duo retrieved equipment and repaired leaking EVA hatch. The spacewalk began at 23:08 UTC and ended at 02:14 UTC. The excursion lasted 3 hours and 6 minutes.

On 2 June 2006 Vinogradov performed his sixth career spacewalk. Vinogradov and NASA astronaut Jeffrey Williams spent six hours and 31 minutes making repairs and collecting experiments along the space station&#x27;s exterior. Their excursion lasted almost an hour longer than planned after the astronauts fell behind in their work schedule. The two spacewalkers began their spacewalk at 22:48 GMT, when they stepped outside the &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment airlock. The spacewalking duo completed two key ISS repairs. Vinogradov replaced a clogged vent nozzle used to dump excess hydrogen overboard by the space station&#x27;s Elektron oxygen generator. Vinogradov and Williams also replaced a broken video camera that provides key views from the space station&#x27;s railcar-like Mobile Base System. During the spacewalk, Vinogradov watched a foot restraint adapter, which had previously linked him to the station&#x27;s Strela crane, drift off into space. The spacewalk ended at 1:19 a.m. EDT when the two spacewalkers re-entered the airlock of the &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment.

Vinogradov was slated to hit a golf ball into space during the spacewalk as part of an agreement between Russia&#x27;s Federal Space Agency and the Canadian golf equipment firm Element 21 Golf Co. However, it was canceled.

On 19 April 2013 Pavel Vinogradov and Roman Romanenko performed a 6:38 EVA (Russian EVA 32).

<text>The Queima das Fitas (Portuguese for &quot;Ribbon Burning&quot;) is a traditional festivity of the students of some Portuguese universities, organized originally by the students of the University of Coimbra.

==History==
Although student traditions and student lore in Portugal are much older and include features like the Praxe and the Latada, the first &quot;Queima das Fitas&quot;, or the ceremonial burning of the ribbons, was organized by the students of the University of Coimbra in the 1850s. The university is the oldest university of the country, and for many centuries it was the only one in Portugal.

==Coimbra==
Coimbra&#x27;s Queima das Fitas, the oldest and most famous, is organized by a students&#x27; commission formed by members of the students&#x27; union Associação Académica de Coimbra. Celebrating the end of graduation courses, symbolized by the ritual burning of the ribbons representing each faculty of the University of Coimbra (UC), it takes place at the second semester (starts on the first Friday of May at 00:00), being among the biggest student festivities in Europe. It lasts for eight days, one for each of UC&#x27;s faculties: Humanities, Law, Medicine, Sciences and Technology, Pharmacy, Economics, Psychology and Education Sciences and Sports Sciences and Physical Education. During this period, a series of concerts and performances are held, turning Coimbra in a lively and vibrant city. It also includes a parade of the university students, sport activities, gala ball, and many other public events and traditions, such as the historical nighttime student fado serenade (Serenata Monumental) which happens in the stairs of the Old Cathedral of Coimbra for a crowd of thousands of students, tourists and other spectators.

The Ribbon Burning festivities are the big yearly celebration for the students and townspeople as well. The festivities run for a full week in May, beginning with the traditional nighttime fado serenade in the square of the Old Cathedral of Coimbra. The square is packed with students in their black capes and according to the ritual, studies are forgotten for a week of joy and all-night revelry. The high point of the festivities is the &quot;Cortejo&quot;, a parade beginning in &quot;Alta&quot; (upper Coimbra, the university historic centre and home to the Rector&#x27;s Office and the famous University tower) with the graduating students burning their &quot;grelo&quot;. The parade progresses down the hills of the &quot;Alta&quot; towards the &quot;Baixa&quot; (downtown Coimbra, near the river) with dozens of elaborately decorated floats, each in the color of their respective faculties, carrying placards with ironic criticisms alluding to certain teachers, the educational system, national events and leaders. The parade is made up of thousands of &quot;newly liberated&quot; students set apart by their top hats and walking sticks.

After the outbreak in 1969 (April 17) of a crisis opposing the students to the dictatorial government of Marcelo Caetano, the festivities, as well as all other manifestations of the academic traditions, were suspended by the students as an act of protest (decided on May 8, 1969). This was known as the &quot;luto académico&quot; (Portuguese for academic mourning). However, between 1945 and 1974, there were three generations of militants of the radical right at the University of Coimbra and other universities, guided by a revolutionary nationalism partly influenced by the political sub-culture of European neofascism. The core of these radical students&#x27; struggle lay in an uncompromising defence of the Portuguese Empire in the days of the authoritarian regime.

The restarting of the celebrations took place in 1980, in the middle of an intense political controversy between left-wing students who opposed the celebration, and conservative students, who wanted to resume the practice. Such struggle took some time to heal, but the &quot;Queima das Fitas&quot; is now only contested by a small fringe of the more radical left-wing student movements.

Nowadays, the beer industry has become an important sponsor of Coimbra&#x27;s Queima das Fitas, which has given still a wider projection to the festival, quite popular among young people from all around the country and even from Spain. During the festival&#x27;s week groups of students from other universities, such as Lisbon or Porto, among thousands of other visitors, come to enjoy it. This growth in popularity has involved significant change to the festival, ever more professionalized, moving it a great distance away from its origins at the end of the 19th century. Students of more traditionalist or leftist sensibilities have occasionally decried this as an increased commercialization and commodification of their &quot;mystique&quot; and traditions.

==Lisbon==
In Lisbon, higher education students enrolled at colleges and universities of Greater Lisbon area have also organized an Academic Week (&quot;Semana Académica&quot;) following many traditional events and cultural manifestations of the burning of the ribbons including an open-air Catholic mass for the students, a nighttime student serenade, a student parade through the streets of Lisbon and a music festival which have been always scheduled every year.

==Porto==

Porto&#x27;s Queima das Fitas traces its origins to the beginning of the 1940s, and is a major event in the first week of May, before the beginning of the study period preceding the school year&#x27;s last exams. The week comprehends 12 events, starting with the Monumental Serenata on Sunday, reaching its peak with the Cortejo Académico on Tuesday, when students from the universities and other higher education institutions of the city march through the downtown streets till they reach the city hall, where they are greeted (and greet back) by the mayor. During every night of the week a series of concerts takes place on the Queimódromo, next to the city&#x27;s park; here it is also a tradition for the students in the second last year to erect small tents where alcoholic beverages are sold in order to finance the trip that takes place during the last year of their course.

During the parade through the city, different year students wear and play different parts: the graduates (the last year students) wear a top-hat and a walking-cane, both the colour of their faculty; the sophomores wear the traditional costume with their capes fully crossed; the freshmen (who after being greeted by the mayor become sophomores) wear funny/silly outfits (usually with carnival props related to baby-costumes) the same colour as their faculty, sing songs as loud as they can, do some sort of group dances, usually get hazed a little bit, and when they get to the Town Hall have to crawl on their hands and feet to walk by the mayor.

Porto&#x27;s Queima was the first to reborn after the 1974 revolution. In 1978 there was a first try with a Mini-Queima, with only a few faculties involved and having to stand fierce hostility. In 1979 a &quot;Traditional Queima&quot; was put up by an almost clandestine organising committee, gathering students from most of the public faculties: Engineering, Medicine, Economics, Pharmacy, Letters, Science.

This team managed to frustrate the boycott efforts of left-wing students that opposed the celebration, and offered to the academy and the city the full traditional range of activities, that started with a Saturday to Sunday late night Serenade (starting at 00:01h), with traditional Coimbra Fado songs, in the courtyard of Porto&#x27;s Cathedral. The programme included the blessing of the students&#x27; briefcases, decorated with ribbons (&quot;Fitas&quot;) of the colour of each faculty, a Charity Day where all revenue from the selling of small cardboard briefcases with poems (some original and cheerfully offered by poet Pedro Homem de Mello) was given to a charity institution, several balls, rallye-paper, Garraiada (mock-up bullfight with small calves) and, specially, a huge parade that attracted an assistance of more than 150,000 that blocked Porto&#x27;s downtown for several hours, cheering the students and showing that the Queima had its place in the city&#x27;s celebrations.

===Murder of Marlon Correia===
In early May 2013, Marlon Correia, who was 24 and a student of the Faculty of Sport of the University of Porto, was murdered in the Queimódromo. This happened as a gang who were heavily armed tried to rob the money from the ticket office and eventually killed Marlon with a firearm. This did not prevent the festival from happening that year and Marlon was honored in the so-called &quot;Bênção das Pastas&quot;. The crime expires in 2035, and according to the order of the Public Ministry and over eight years, the authorities investigated violent groups, including the &#x27;Grupo de Coimbrões&#x27; and the &#x27;Grupo da Cruz de Pau-Matosinhos&#x27; and even constituted six people as defendants. However, as of 2023, no suspects were sent to trial and the FAP, the student federation of Porto which organizes the Queima das Fitas in the city, was acquitted of paying indemnification to the parents of the victim because no wrongdoing or fault was found on the part of FAP as temporary employer and organizer of the event.

==History==

===Vee Corporation===
Vee Corporation was started on March 14, 1980 from an idea by founder Vincent Egan to produce a live character show just for Sesame Street. At the time, there were only three touring family shows, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and two ice shows, Ice Follies and Holiday on Ice. He based it off his time working for the Ice Follies which had a segment with those Sesame Street Muppets. Egan approached Jim Henson&#x27;s company and Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, who were interested. He then found an investor in Gordon Stofer, whose Norwest Growth Fund took half ownership in the company for $500,000. Egan refinanced his home mortgage for $25,000 in additional funding. With the funding, Vee was able to sign a licensing agreement with the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop for the characters.

The first Sesame Street Live show opened in September 1980 at the Metropolitan Sports Center in Bloomington, Minnesota for a five-day run. That show was successful. The following shows in five locations had lackluster attendance costing VEE the profits made in Bloomington. Egan figured that the marketing material was confusing people in those markets as what type of show was not specified. He overhauled the script and marketing while getting his creditors to wait for payments. That Christmas, the show went on to play for four weeks at Madison Square Garden&#x27;s 4,000-seat Felt Forum in New York City before an audience of 100,000 people.

Around 2000, Egan purchased Norwest Fund&#x27;s stake in the corporation. He also formed two divisions, Vee Costumes &amp; Creatures and Vee Production Services, to successfully diversify the company.

===Blue Star===
Sanjay Syal started Blue Star Productions before 1995 to produce trade shows. Where Syal produced over 100 events per year, Syal then formed Blue Star Media in 2011 for the traveling exhibition, Discover the Dinosaurs, which became one of the most successful traveling family events in the country with over 120 event per year. With the success of the exhibition, Syal then proceeded to wind down Blue Star Productions as contracts expired. Blue Star Media then started to look for a partner finding AUA Private Equity, who purchase a share of the company from Syal in early June 2014 via a leverage buyout. A tented version of the Discover exhibition was launched in 2014 at two state fairs, New York State Fair, and the California State Fair, and had 14% of total yearly attendance for the exhibition.

===VStar Entertainment Group===

On April 1, 2015, Blue Star Media, LLC under the direction of Sanjay Syal as CEO purchased VEE Corporation with Egan continuing as a consultant.
In 2015, VEE Corporation and Blue Star Media, a producer and promoter of consumer shows and events, became VStar Entertainment Group. In August 2015, the company agreed to partner with the Pro Football Hall of Fame for a mobile tour. In April 2016, Vstar hired Eric Grilly as CEO from Comcast Sports Group.

In November 2016, Sesame Workshop announced an agreement with Feld Entertainment for a new Sesame Street Live show thus ending VStar&#x27;s arena version in July 2017. The company continues to support and produce other Sesame Street shows at various locations and the United Service Organizations tour while still providing costumes.

In January 2017, Vstar acquired Cirque Productions, based in South Florida. Neil Goldberg, Cirque Productions founder and Broadway director, was retained as president of Cirque Dreams.

====Aftermath====
On July 5, 2018, Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group announced that it was acquiring VStar.

On June 29, 2020, Cirque du Soleil filed for bankruptcy in Canada. Three days later, on July 1, 2020, they filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy.

On August 17, 2018, Stay Here launched on Netflix. This eight-episode series featured Gorder and real-estate expert Peter Lorimer working together to help Airbnb and Vrbo hosts redecorate and market their rental properties. Gorder is also credited as an executive producer for the series.

<text>Aleksandr Ivanovich Lazutkin (; born October 30, 1957) is a former Russian cosmonaut.

== Life and career ==
Lazutkin attended the Moscow Aviation Institute and received a degree in mechanical engineering. He was selected as a cosmonaut on March 3, 1992. His first spaceflight was Soyuz TM-25, where he served as the flight engineer.

Lazutkin has stated that Russian cosmonauts were given cognac for extended missions in space.

=== 1997 Progress supply mission ===
Lazutkin was aboard the Mir Space Station when a collision occurred with the uncrewed Progress M34, its supply craft, which was piloted by Vasily Tsibliyev while on the Mir. The collision, considered the worst in the history of the space age, knocked out Spektr&#x27;s solar panels and caused the Mir to lose alignment with the sun, resulting in a loss of power. It also caused the cabin to decompress.

Quick action by the three crew members managed to avert immediate disaster. Lazutkin and fellow crew member Michael Foale quickly severed the connecting cables with the module and sealed off the hatches to the module, saving the rest of the station. Lazutkin successfully cut some of the wires connecting the Mir and the Spektr using a small dinner knife. A few days after the collision, Tsibliyev and Lazutkin were ordered to attempt to repair the Mir, while Foale was ordered to the Soyuz-TM escape pod. The station was eventually secured safely.

<text>In real estate, a landed property or landed estate is a property that generates income for the owner (typically a member of the gentry) without the owner having to do the actual work of the estate.

In medieval Western Europe, there were two competing systems of landed property; manorialism, inherited from the Roman villa system, where a large estate is owned by the Lord of the manor and leased to tenants; and the family farm or &quot;Hof&quot; owned by and heritable within a commoner family (c.f. yeoman), inherited from Germanic law.

A gentleman farmer is the largely historic term for a country gentleman who has a farm as part of his estate and farms mainly for pleasure rather than for profit. His acreage may vary from under ten to hundreds of acres. The gentleman farmer employed labourers and farm managers. However, according to the 1839 &quot;Encyclopedia of Agriculture&quot;, he &quot;did not associate with these minor working brethren&quot;. The chief source of income for the gentleman farmer was derived not from any income that his landed property may generate; he had either access to his own private income, he worked as a professional and/or he owned a large business elsewhere. Or all three.

Modern landed property often consists of housing or industrial land, generating income in the form of rents or fees for services provided by the facilities on the land, such as port facilities. Owners often commission an estate map to help manage their estate as well as serving as a status symbol.

Landed property was a key element of feudalism, and freed the owner for other tasks, such as government administration, military service, the practice of law, or religious practices.

In later times, the dominant role of landed estates as a basis of public service faded. Development of manufacturing and commerce created capitalist means of obtaining income, but ordinarily demanding the attention of the owner. At roughly the same time, governments began imposing taxes to fund government bureaus and the military, so that people of talent could perform government services for salaries without need for the proceeds of ownership of farmland.

Much of the United States, typically New England, Pennsylvania, and most states west of the original colonies, never had a landed aristocracy, so their armed forces and government agencies could never be organized on the basis of a landed aristocracy.

<text>The Kivalliq Region (; Inuktitut syllabics: ᑭᕙᓪᓕᖅ) is an administrative region of Nunavut, Canada. It consists of the portion of the mainland to the west of Hudson Bay together with Southampton Island and Coats Island. The regional centre is Rankin Inlet. The population was 11,045 in the 2021 Canadian census, an increase of 6.1% from the 2016 census.

Before 1999, the Kivalliq Region existed under slightly different boundaries as Keewatin Region, Northwest Territories. Although the Kivalliq name became official in 1999, Statistics Canada continued to refer to the area as the Keewatin Region in publications such as the Census until 2021. Most references to the area as &quot;Keewatin&quot; have generally been phased out by Nunavut-based bodies, as that name was originally rooted in a region of northwestern Ontario derived from a Cree dialect, and only saw application onto Inuit-inhabited lands because of the boundaries of the now-defunct District of Keewatin.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, the Kivalliq Region had a population of 11,045 living in 2,719 of its 3,193 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 10,413. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Geology==

The Kivalliq Region is experiencing the world&#x27;s highest rate of post-glacial rebound (as much as per year).

==Climate==
The Kivalliq Region has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;) and a tundra climate (&quot;ET&quot;). However, it is almost entirely above the tree line. Temperatures stay below freezing from late September to early June, and peak at around in July. Days are much longer in summer than in winter.

<text>Reinhold Ewald (born 18 December 1956) is a German physicist and ESA astronaut.

==Biography==
Born in Mönchengladbach, West Germany, he received a Diploma in experimental physics from the University of Cologne in 1983 and a Ph.D. in 1986, with a minor degree in human physiology.

In 1990, he was selected to the German astronaut team, training for the Mir &#x27;92 mission. He was the backup of Klaus-Dietrich Flade for the Soyuz TM-14 mission. In 1995 he began training for the second German Mir mission. In February 1997 he flew to the space station Mir with Soyuz TM-25, spending 20 days in space. He performed experiments in biomedical and material sciences, and carried out operational tests in preparation for the International Space Station.

In February 1999, he joined the European Astronaut Corps at the European Astronaut Centre (EAC) in Cologne, Germany.

From 2006 to 2011, Ewald headed the Flight Operations Division within ESA&#x27;s ISS Operations department at the Columbus Control Centre near Munich. In this role, he directed a team of ESA Mission Directors managing the Columbus laboratory delivery flight in February 2008 and the Columbus science activities thereafter.

He served as an Advisor to the Head of Director General&#x27;s Cabinet at ESA&#x27;s headquarters in Paris from 2011 to 2014, followed by a position at the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, promoting the scientific achievements of the ESA research programme on the International Space Station.

In September 2015 he was appointed as Professor for Astronautics and Space Stations at the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) at the University of Stuttgart as the successor to Ernst Messerschmid.

<text>MaliVai &quot;Mal&quot; Washington ( ) (born June 20, 1969) is an American former professional tennis player. He reached the men&#x27;s singles final at Wimbledon in 1996, won four ATP titles and achieved a career-high singles ranking of world No. 11 in October 1992.

==Family==
Washington began playing tennis aged five. Washington&#x27;s younger sister, Mashona, is also a former top-50 professional tennis player. His younger brother, Mashiska, received All-America honors at Michigan State University, before joining the men&#x27;s professional tour. MaliVai&#x27;s older sister Michaela also played professionally.

==Amateur tennis==
As a high school senior, Washington was coached by former ATP Tour participant Victor Amaya. For two seasons, Washington played tennis for the University of Michigan and was the top ranked college player in the United States at the end of his sophomore season. He left college two years into his studies to pursue a professional tennis career.

==Professional career==
Washington turned professional in 1989. In 1990, while ranked no. 103, he defeated world number 2 Ivan Lendl in New Haven (6–3, 6–2).

During his breakthrough year in 1992, Washington won the Memphis title (defeating seventh-seeded Wayne Ferreira in the final) and the U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Championships in Charlotte, North Carolina, winning the final against Claudio Mezzadri. He reached a career high ranking of 11 in October.

In 1993, Washington reached his first Masters final in Miami, losing to Pete Sampras in straight sets.

At the 1994 Australian Open, Washington reached his first Grand Slam quarterfinal, after a win over second-seeded Michael Stich in the first round and a five-set victory against Mats Wilander in the fourth round. He also had wins over Michael Chang and Stefan Edberg during the US Summer hard court season, and won his third ATP-title in Ostrava in October.

In 1995, he beat world no. 1 Andre Agassi in the third round of the Essen Masters on his way to the final (where he lost to Thomas Muster).

Washington&#x27;s biggest success at a Grand Slam event came in 1996 when he was a runner-up at the Wimbledon Championships. On his way to the final he defeated ninth-seeded Thomas Enqvist in the second round, and came back from a 1–5 deficit in the fifth set of the semifinal to beat Todd Martin, finally winning 10–8. Before the tournament had started, his odds of winning the title were 300–1. He eventually lost the final to Richard Krajicek. He gained revenge against Krajicek in the Grand Slam Cup in October later that year, beating him for the loss of just three games (6–1, 6–2).

Washington suffered from a recurring knee injury from the beginning of 1997, causing him to miss most of the 1997 and 1999 seasons, and precipitating his retirement in December 1999.

==Awards==
In 2009 Washington won the ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year award, for his positive work through the MaliVai Washington Youth Foundation.

In 2015 Washington won the NJTL Founders&#x27; Service Award (The USTA&#x27;s National Junior Tennis League), for his continued contribution since retirement to support education and tennis among children and young people (particularly those underprivileged).

<text>Thomas Arthur Reiter (born 23 May 1958 in Frankfurt, West Germany) is a retired European astronaut and is a Brigadier General in the German Air Force currently working as ESA Interagency Coordinator and Advisor to the Director General at the European Space Agency (ESA). He was one of the top 25 astronauts in terms of total time in space. With his wife and two sons he lives near Oldenburg in Lower Saxony.

==Education==
He graduated from Goethe-High School in Neu-Isenburg in 1977. In 1982, Reiter received his diploma in aerospace engineering from the Bundeswehr University Munich. In 2010 the university awarded him an honorary doctorate degree. He completed his training as a pilot in Germany and Texas.

==Astronaut career==
He served as an onboard engineer for the Euromir 95/Soyuz TM-22 mission to the Mir space station. During his 179 days aboard Mir, he carried out two EVAs and became the first German astronaut to perform a spacewalk.

Between 1996 and 1997, he underwent additional training on the Soyuz spacecraft and was awarded a &quot;Soyuz Return Commander&quot; certificate, qualifying him to command a three-person Soyuz crew during its return from space.

He trained for a six-month mission to the International Space Station (ISS) and was selected for the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; STS-121 mission to join Expedition 13. The launch was initially scheduled for 1 July 2006, but was due to weather delays eventually conducted on 4 July 2006. &quot;Discovery&quot; then departed on 15 July, leaving Reiter on the ISS continuing to work on Expedition 13. He later became part of Expedition 14 before returning to Earth, again aboard &quot;Discovery&quot; during the STS-116 mission. Reiter returned after 171 days in space, therefore having been in orbit twice, each time for almost half a year. 

His ISS mission was designated &quot;Astrolab&quot; by the European Space Agency.

On 8 August 2007 Thomas Reiter was named a member of DLR&#x27;s executive board.

From 1 April 2011 to December 2015 he was Director of Human Spaceflight and Operations at the European Space Agency (ESA), responsible for all crewed and uncrewed mission operations. This included the operation and exploitation of the European International Space Station elements, ESA&#x27;s Automated Transfer Vehicle, the responsibility for the European Astronaut Centre, EAC, and ESA&#x27;s uncrewed missions and ground-based mission infrastructure. Today he is working as ESA Interagency Coordinator and Advisor to the Director General.

==Honours and awards==
* Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2007)
* Bavarian Medal Europe (2008)
* Honorary doctorate of the Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Bundeswehr University Munich (28 June 2010)

<doc id="873618" wikidata="Q131778" url="?curid=873618" title="Protarchaeopteryx">
<text>Protarchaeopteryx (meaning &quot;before &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;&quot; although it is from the Cretaceous and &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; is from the Jurassic) is a genus of turkey-sized feathered theropod dinosaur from China. Known from the Jianshangou bed of the Yixian Formation, it lived during the early Aptian age of the Early Cretaceous, approximately 124.6 million years ago. It was probably a herbivore or omnivore, although its hands were very similar to those of small carnivorous dinosaurs. It appears to be one of the most basal members of the Oviraptorosauria, closely related to &quot;Incisivosaurus&quot;, or a taxon slightly less closely related to birds than oviraptorosaurs were.

==Description==

The holotype and only known specimen of &quot;Protarchaeopteryx&quot; is NGMC 2125, a partial skeleton.

&quot;Protarchaeopteryx&quot; had long legs, and could have been a quick runner. It had well-developed, vaned feathers extended from a relatively short tail; the hands were long and slender, and had three fingers with sharp, curved claws. Its bones were hollow and bird-like, and it possessed a wishbone. At around in length, it would have been larger than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. In 2016, Gregory S. Paul gave a lower estimate of in length and in body mass. &quot;Protarchaeopteryx&quot; also had symmetrical feathers on its tail. Since modern birds that have symmetrical feathers are flightless, and the skeletal structure of &quot;Protarchaeopteryx&quot; would not support flapping flight, it is assumed that it was flightless as well. It has been suggested that it could have had an arboreal lifestyle, jumping from tree limbs and using its forelimbs for a form of parachuting.

<text>Melissa Ann Hart (born April 4, 1962) is an American lawyer and politician. She was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2007, representing western Pennsylvania&#x27;s 4th congressional district. In the 2006 midterm elections, Hart lost her bid for re-election to Democrat Jason Altmire. She challenged Altmire again in the 2008 election, but was defeated again.

She was a candidate for Republican nomination in the 2022 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, but dropped out on May 13, four days before the primary election and endorsed Lou Barletta.

==Early life and education==
Hart is an Italian-American, born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She graduated from North Allegheny High School. While at Washington and Jefferson College, she earned a degree in business and German, intending to pursue a career in international business. While there, she and some friends founded the college&#x27;s College Republicans club. After an internship with a local judge, she decided to attend law school.

She entered the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

== Career ==

After graduating from law school and being admitted to the bar, Hart joined a major Pittsburgh law firm, where she specialized in real estate law.

Hart has served on the Washington &amp; Jefferson College Board of Trustees.

Hart was an active grassroots volunteer in her party in Western Pennsylvania from her days as a student at Washington &amp; Jefferson College. She worked with other students to establish a College Republican Club on campus. The group was a reliable source for volunteers in Washington County where the party was in the minority in the early 1980s. It was there where Hart first learned the importance of grassroots politics, by door-knocking for candidates from District Attorney to Governor.

=== State senate ===
She was the first Republican woman to represent Pennsylvania at the federal level. Prior to her service in Congress, Hart served in the Pennsylvania Senate, where she chaired the finance committee. She was the first Republican woman elected to serve a full term in the Pennsylvania Senate in 1990 when she was 28 years old. In her first run for office, Hart defeated an incumbent in a senate district that included parts of Allegheny, Westmoreland and Armstrong counties.

=== Congress ===
In November 2000, Hart was elected to the House of Representatives from the Fourth District of the State of Pennsylvania, winning an open seat previously held by a Democrat. She had served as a senator in the Pennsylvania Senate from 1991 to 2001. She was later appointed co-chair of the Platform Committee for the 2004 Republican National Convention.

She convened a task force to rename the Pittsburgh region’s highway system of I-279S/US-22/30W/PA-60N to extend and become a part of federal highway I-376. This initiative was researched and supported by local governments and the commonwealth as a tool to attract outside development to the region. This was supported by site selection professional who participated as well as the Southwest PA Regional Planning Commission.

Hart co-chaired the Republican Party platform of 2004. In 2005 she was appointed to the House Ways and Means Committee.

Hart played an active role in the race for majority leader in early 2006. As a top whip for the successful candidacy of Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), she worked to secure votes for him in the race. She was one of a handful of GOP members who called for a full set of new leadership elections for whip, conference chair, and other offices below the majority leader position, but that motion narrowly failed the day before the majority leader race. Had this motion passed, Hart may have challenged Rep. Deborah Pryce (R-OH) for House Republican Conference Chairman, the No. 4 leadership spot.

In December 2002, Hart was a candidate for Conference Vice-Chair, the No. 5 leadership spot, but lost to Jack Kingston (R-GA). In a 2002 PoliticsPA feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, Hart was named amongst those &quot;Most Likely to Succeed.&quot;

Hart is Roman Catholic and was a legislative leader on anti-abortion issues, such as opposition to federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. In January 2006, she addressed an anti-abortion rally in Washington, D.C., urging young people who oppose abortion to enter public service. She opposed abortions for rape and incest cases, and sponsored laws to promote assistance to women and children such as safe haven laws which prevent mothers from being charged with abandonment when they bring their child to a safe place such as a hospital or police station to allow the child to be adopted.

===2006 election===
As the 2006 campaign season approached, Hart&#x27;s congressional seat was not considered vulnerable, and Hart was described in media accounts as a &quot;rising star&quot; in Republican politics, who had never lost an election and who had demonstrated a unique ability to appeal to non-conservative voters even while maintaining a generally conservative voting record. In late 2005, her predecessor in the House of Representatives, Democrat Ron Klink, publicly mulled over the possibility of challenging Hart for his old seat. However, in late December, Klink announced that he would not run. Jason Altmire, a 38-year-old health care executive and political unknown (and, by coincidence, a neighbor of Hart&#x27;s brother), ultimately won the Democratic nomination for the seat.

For most of 2006, the Altmire campaign was viewed as a long shot, but as the campaign wound down his poll numbers surged and Hart&#x27;s dropped. An October, a Susquehanna poll showed Hart with what was then a surprisingly narrow 46%–42% lead over Altmire. Altmire&#x27;s continued to climb as Hart&#x27;s stalled, and five days before the November 7, 2006, election, the Cook Political Report altered its rating of the race from &quot;Likely Republican&quot; to &quot;Toss up.&quot;

On Election Day, Hart was defeated by a margin of 52%–48%.

Hart&#x27;s loss was one component of a broad Republican meltdown in Pennsylvania. Senator Rick Santorum, who was at the top of the Republican ticket, lost his re-election bid by a very large margin. Pennsylvania also saw the defeat of three other incumbent Republican members of Congress. Democratic victories for the governor, and Democratic gains in the state House of Representatives also occurred that year.

Following the election, she returned to the law firm Keevican Weiss Bauerle &amp; Hirsch, where she had worked before being elected to Congress. She returned to her specialization of &quot;general practice and business development.&quot;

===2008 election===
Hart announced in July 2007 that she would run against Altmire in 2008. Despite speculation that retired athlete and former gubernatorial candidate Lynn Swann would run for the seat, Hart was unopposed for the Republican nomination. In the general election, she was again defeated by Altmire, this time by a much larger margin.

===Later career===
Following Hart’s departure from the House in 2007, she rejoined her law firm, Keevican Weiss Bauerle &amp; Hirsch (now Keevican Weiss &amp; Bauerle), where she worked to build and chair the government relations section. She later returned to her original law firm, Hergenroeder Rega Ewing &amp; Kennedy in 2017 to work with a group of attorneys with whom she had begun her legal career. In 2018, Hart was elected to the Board of Directors of Enterprise Bank. Also in 2018, Hart co-founded, with Tim Watkins and her former House colleague, Thaddeus McCotter, a political strategy, creative, and media firm, RPC Strategies, LLC.

Hart sought to retake her state senate seat in a 2012 special election triggered when her successor, Jane Orie, was forced to resign after being convicted of corruption and forgery. However, she lost the Republican primary to state Representative Randy Vulakovich.

In December 2021, Hart announced her intent to run for governor of Pennsylvania in the 2022 Republican primary. She dropped out on May 13, 2022, and endorsed former Congressman Lou Barletta. Her name remained on the ballot and she garnered 54,000 votes.

<doc id="873629" wikidata="Q1939469" url="?curid=873629" title="Mitch Leigh">
<text>Mitch Leigh (born Irwin Stanley Michnick; January 30, 1928March 16, 2014) was an American musical theatre composer and theatrical producer best known for the musical &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;.

==Early years==
Leigh was born Irwin Stanley Michnick in Brooklyn on January 30, 1928, where he grew up in the Brownsville neighborhood. His father was from Ukraine. After service in the U.S. Army, he graduated from Yale in 1951 with a Bachelor of Music, and in 1952 received his Master of Music degree under Paul Hindemith.

==Career==
He began his career as a jazz musician, and writing commercials for radio and television. On the 1955 LP recording of &quot;Jean Shepherd Into the Unknown with Jazz Music&quot;, Leigh wrote the jazz interludes between radio broadcaster Jean Shepherd&#x27;s improvisations.

===Broadway===
In 1965, Leigh collaborated with lyricist Joe Darion and writer Dale Wasserman to write a musical based on Wasserman&#x27;s 1959 television play, &quot;I, Don Quixote&quot;. The resulting show, the musical &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; opened on Broadway in 1965 and in its original engagement ran for 2,328 performances. It has been revived multiple times.

Leigh followed with the show &quot;Chu Chem&quot;, which he also produced, exactly a year after &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, but closed on the road. It finally opened on Broadway in 1989 but ran for only 68 performances.

&quot;Cry for Us All&quot;, based on the play, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Goat&quot;, opened on Broadway in 1970; it ran for only nine performances. Leigh was the producer as well as composer. His musical &quot;Home Sweet Homer&quot;, starring Yul Brynner, officially opened on Broadway in January 1976 but closed after one performance. He produced and wrote the music for &quot;Saravá&quot; which ran for 101 performances in 1979. Leigh both produced and directed the 1985 revival of &quot;The King and I&quot; starring Brynner featuring in his final performances as the King of Siam.

Lee Adams asked Leigh to collaborate on a musical titled &quot;Mike&quot;, about producer Mike Todd, but it closed during its pre-Broadway tryout in 1988. After renaming it &quot;Ain&#x27;t Broadway Grand!&quot;, the show made it to Broadway in 1993, but lasted only 25 performances. He wrote the musical &quot;Halloween&quot; with Sidney Michaels, and although Barbara Cook and José Ferrer were in the cast, it did not reach Broadway.

===Television===
Leigh established Music Makers, Inc., in 1957 as a radio and television commercial production house and was its creative director. His television music included the instrumental music for the ABC Color Logo (1962–65); the TV commercial jingle &quot;Nobody Doesn&#x27;t Like Sara Lee&quot;; the &quot;Meet the Swinger&quot; Polaroid Swinger commercial sung by Barry Manilow; and the Benson &amp; Hedges theme &quot;The Dis-Advantages of You,&quot; which reached the Top 40 for The Brass Ring in 1967 and was heard in a series of Benson &amp; Hedges cigarette commercials at that time.

===Academic legacy===
In 1977, Leigh and others at the Yale School of Music established the Keith Wilson scholarship, to be awarded &quot;to an outstanding major in wind instrument playing.&quot; A building in The School of Music at Yale University was named &quot;Abby and Mitch Leigh Hall&quot; in 2001.

==Personal life==
After a marriage to Renee Goldman ended in divorce, Leigh married Abby Kimmelman. He had one child from his first marriage and two from his second, one of whom is playwright Eve Leigh. Leigh died from complications of a stroke and pneumonia at a Manhattan hospital on March 16, 2014, at the age of 86.

===Jackson 21===
To avoid taxation for his earnings from &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, Leigh purchased 1,000 acres of land in Jackson Township, New Jersey over many years. He planned to turn it into a mixed-use development called &quot;Jackson 21&quot;. Towards the end of his life, he began advertising it on television, saying that its prospective residents would have to be &quot;really nice&quot; people. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the commercials confused viewers, many of whom thought Leigh was running a scam or a starting a cult. No major construction had taken place by the time of his death, and the project was essentially abandoned afterward.

==Awards==
Leigh won a Tony Award for composing the music for &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;. He was also nominated for a Tony Award as the director of the 1985 revival of &quot;The King and I&quot;. He received the Contemporary Classics Award from the Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame for &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;.

<text>Eco-warrior is defined by The Oxford English Dictionary as &quot;a person who protects the environment &quot;. In academic discourse, this term is contextualized as a response to systemic environmental harm where activists challenge industrial or governmental entities. There is a distinct difference between an eco-warrior and an eco-terrorist. The former refers to activists using non-violent direct action while the latter is a term used to label individuals who engage in illegal or violent activities.

Etymology

The term &quot;eco-warrior&quot; combines &quot;eco&quot; — short for &quot;ecology&quot;, which originates from the Greek word &quot;oikos&quot;, meaning &quot;house&quot; or &quot;environment&quot;— and &quot;warrior&quot;, a term historically associated with individuals engaged in a battle or conflict. In this context, &quot;warrior&quot; metaphorically represents someone fighting to protect and preserve the natural world.

== History ==
The term &quot;eco-warrior&quot; gained prominence in the United Kingdom during the 1970s and 1990s through media coverage of environmental action campaigns that showed individuals engaging in bold, non-violent actions to protect the environment. Movements, such as Earth First! UK, initiated in 1980, played a pivotal role in this rise. These activists engaged in direct actions against environmental degradation, including protests against road construction and deforestation. The media&#x27;s portrayal of these events and individuals contributed to the widespread use of the term eco-warrior in public discourse. Notably, the Oxford Dictionary mentions the earliest recorded use of the term in 1987, in The Sunday Times.

The modern environmental movement gained momentum in the mid-20th century. For instance, Rachel Carson&#x27;s 1962 book, &quot;Silent Spring&quot; is recognized as raising public awareness about environmental issues such as the dangers of pesticides. Following the 60s, the 1970s marked a significant turning point, with the establishment of Earth Day as a global call to action. This period also saw the creation of key environmental legislation in many countries such as the United States’ Clean Air Act and Endangered Species Act. In the 1980s, environmentalism matured into a global movement that involved policy advocacy and direct action aimed at confronting environmental threats. This evolution set the stage for the emergence of eco-warriors — individuals and groups who sought to protect the environment — through bold acts of resistance.

== Campaigns and Success Stories ==
Twyford Down Protests

In the early 1990s, the proposed extension of the M3 motorway through Twyford Down, near Winchester, Hampshire, ignited environmental protests. The area, known for its deep, ancient tracks referred to locally as &quot;dongas&quot;, was valued for its natural beauty and archaeological importance. Activists, including a group that became known as the Dongas Tribe established camps on the down to physically obstruct construction efforts.

Despite their persistent non-violent resistance, the motorway extension was completed. However, the Twyford Down protests become an example of grassroots opposition to environmentally harmful infrastructure projects. This campaign marked the first large-scale direct action against road construction in the UK, setting a precedent for future environmental activism.

Newbury Bypass Protests

In the mid-1990s, the construction of the Newbury Bypass — a nine-mile stretch intended to alleviate traffic congestion on A34 — faced significant resistance from environmental activists. Protesters opposed the destruction of approximately 10,000 trees and the disruption of local ecosystems. They used tactics such as occupying trees, making elaborate camps, and chaining themselves to machinery to delay construction and gain media attention. These efforts led to over 800 arrests and increased the project&#x27;s costs and duration.

== The Role of Media and Pop Culture ==
Media coverage has shaped public perceptions of eco-warriors, amplifying their actions and influencing the public&#x27;s view on environmental activism. In the 1980s and 1990s, images of protesters chaining themselves to machinery, occupying treetops, or forming human blockades against bulldozers captured headlines and created a widespread debate. Additionally, documentaries and news reports brought attention to eco-warrior campaigns. Media coverage of protests like those against the Newbury Bypass and Twyford Down in the UK made local environmental disputes into national concerns.

In popular culture, the eco-warrior archetype has appeared in films, television shows, and literature. Characters inspired by real-life activists, or fictionalized versions of their struggles, have contributed to the romanticized image of the eco-warrior as a heroic defender of nature. While these portrayals helped popularize the term and broaden its appeal, they also reinforced stereotypes of environmentalists as fringe or militant figures.

In the 21st century, social media has extended the reach of eco-warrior movements. Platforms like X and Instagram have allowed activists to share real-time updates, viral videos, and calls to action to bridge the gap between grassroots movements and global audiences.

== International Influence ==
While the term eco-warrior originated in the United Kingdom, the philosophy and tactics associated with eco-warrior activism quickly spread across the globe. In many cases, these movements adopted the strategies of non-violent direct action to address region-specific environmental challenges.

In North America, eco-warrior tactics were seen in the Pacific Northwest during the 1990s. In the campaigns of the Headwaters Forest in California and Clayoquot Sound in Canada, activists organized large-scale protests against logging in ancient forests. Tree-sitting became a defining method of resistance with activists physically occupying trees marked for logging to prevent their destruction. These efforts delayed deforestation and pressured governments to implement stricter conservation policies.

In the Amazon rainforest, Indigenous communities have used eco-warrior-style activism to combat illegal logging, mining, and deforestation. Groups like the Kayapo people in Brazil have staged public protests, blockaded infrastructure projects, and even confronted illegal loggers directly.

In India, the Chipko Movement of the 1970s — where villagers embraced trees to prevent their felling — is highlighted as a precursor to modern eco-warrior activism. In Australia, campaigns to protect the Great Barrier Reef and halt coal mining projects mobilized activists who use civil disobedience to spotlight environmental threats.

Eco-warrior movements have also influenced climate justice activism globally. In Europe, groups like Extinction Rebellion have adopted and expanded eco-warrior tactics using high-profile acts of civil disobedience to bring attention to climate change. In Africa, activists have resisted oil exploration in fragile ecosystems like the Niger Delta.

== Criticism and Controversy ==
A common criticism of eco-warriors is that they are sometimes perceived as extremists who disrupt societal progress. Media and political narratives have occasionally portrayed their actions as unnecessarily militant even when they remain non-violent. For example, critics argue that tactics like blockades and tree-sits can inconvenience the public, alienate potential allies, and damage their cause&#x27;s credibility.

==Types of Eco-warriors==

Direct-action activists are individuals who engage in immediate and confrontational efforts to address environmental issues through non-violent means. Their goal is to directly intervene in activities that harm the environment to stop of draw the public&#x27;s attention to ecological degradation.

Legal Advocates or environmental lawyers use the legal system to protect the environment and promote sustainability. They engage in litigation, policy advocacy, and legal counseling to address environmental issues, holding corporations and governments accountable for ecological harm.

Organizational Participants refer to groups and entities that coordinate collective efforts to address ecological challenges.

Indigenous Activists are individuals from native communities who advocate for the protection of their ancestral lands, natural resources, and cultural heritage. Their activism is rooted in traditional ecological knowledge and emphasizes the connection between Indigenous identity and environmental stewardship.

Entrepreneurial Eco-Warriors or ecopreneurs, are Individuals who establish and operate businesses with the dual objectives of generating profit and addressing environmental challenges. They integrate ecological sustainability into their business models, offering products or services that contribute positively to the environment.

== Symbols and Identity ==
The Eco-Warriors Flag

Originating in Australia during the late 1990s, this flag features four colors — red, yellow, black, and green. The first three colors are from the Australian Aboriginal flag, symbolizing Indigenous cultures and humanity&#x27;s origins. The green represents the environment and ecological preservation.

Extinction Symbol 

The Extinction Symbol is a stylized hourglass within a circle that represents the urgency of addressing mass extinction and biodiversity loss. This symbol has been adopted by groups like Extinction Rebellion.

Ecology Flag

Inspired by the American flag, the Ecology Flag features green and white stripes with a theta symbol in the canton. The theta signifies the balance between organism and their environments.

<text>Midwestern University (MWU) is a private medical and professional school with campuses in Downers Grove, Illinois and Glendale, Arizona. As of the 2022–23 academic year, a total of 2,758 students were enrolled at the Downers Grove campus and 3,782 were enrolled at the Glendale campus.

Founded in 1900 as the American College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery, the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine is the fourth-oldest medical school currently active in Illinois. Over the years, the university expanded, adding additional degrees and programs; in 1993, the school united these programs under the name Midwestern University. In 1995, the school opened a campus in Glendale, Arizona, becoming the second and largest medical school to teach students in the state. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and the medical schools are also accredited by the American Osteopathic Association&#x27;s Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation.

==History==

The university was founded in 1900 as the American College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery. The school was the fourth medical school in the world to grant the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree. Originally located on Washington Boulevard in Chicago, the school moved to Hyde Park in 1918. In 1913, the school changed its name to the Chicago College of Osteopathy, eventually becoming the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine.

In 1986, the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine moved from its prior location in Hyde Park to a new campus in the western suburb of Downers Grove, Illinois. In 1991, the Chicago College of Pharmacy opened. The College of Health Sciences began in 1992. In 1993, the board of trustees unanimously approved a single educational mission for the institution, uniting the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine, the Chicago College of Pharmacy, and the Chicago College of Health Sciences into Midwestern University. In 2009, the College of Dental Medicine-Illinois opened, followed by the Chicago College of Optometry in 2014 and the College of Graduate Studies in 2018.

In 1996, the university opened a new campus in Glendale, Arizona. The first college at the Glendale campus was the Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine, which began its first courses in 1996. The college joined the University of Arizona College of Medicine as one of only two medical schools in Arizona at the time, and it remained the only osteopathic medical school in the state until AT Still University opened in Mesa in 2007. In 1997, a physician assistant program was established at the Glendale campus, followed by the College of Pharmacy the next year. In 2006, the College of Dental Medicine-Arizona opened, then the Arizona College of Optometry opened in 2008, and the College of Veterinary Medicine opened in 2012. The College of Health Sciences&#x27; podiatric medicine program became the Arizona College of Podiatric Medicine in 2020.
In 2010, the university received a Conservation and Native Landscaping Awards from the Environmental Protection Agency for restoring 9 acres of wetland and oak-hickory woods on the Downers Grove campus. In 2012, the Downers Grove Multispecialty Clinic opened in a five-story, 193,000 square foot building. Also that year, the College of Veterinary Medicine opened at the Glendale campus, with a 109,000-square-foot veterinary teaching hospital, a 36,000-square-foot large animal teaching facility, and a 76,000-square-foot classroom building. The school was the first veterinary medical school in the state of Arizona, and was the 29th veterinary medical school in the United States.

<doc id="873641" wikidata="Q317792" url="?curid=873641" title="Valeri Polyakov">
<text>Valeri Vladimirovich Polyakov (, born Valeri Ivanovich Korshunov, , 27 April 1942 – 7 September 2022) was a Soviet and Russian cosmonaut. He is the record holder for the longest single stay in space, staying aboard the Mir space station for more than 14 months (437 days 18 hours) during one trip. His combined space experience was more than 22 months.

Selected as a cosmonaut in 1972, Polyakov made his first flight into space aboard Soyuz TM-6 in 1988. He returned to Earth 240 days later aboard TM-7. Polyakov completed his second flight into space in 1994–1995, spending 437 days in space between launching on Soyuz TM-18 and landing with TM-20, setting the record for the longest time continuously spent in space by an individual.

== Early life ==
Polyakov was born in Tula in the USSR on 27 April 1942. Born Valeri Ivanovich Korshunov, Polyakov legally changed his name after being adopted by his stepfather in 1957. He was educated at the Tula Secondary School No. 4, from which he graduated in 1959.

He enrolled in the I. M. Sechenov 1st Moscow Medical Institute, where he graduated with a doctoral degree. Afterwards, he enrolled in the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems, Ministry of Public Health, Moscow, where he specialized in astronautics medicine. Polyakov dedicated himself to the field of space medicine in 1964 after the flight of the first physician in space, Boris Yegorov, aboard Voskhod 1.

== Cosmonaut career ==
Polyakov was selected as a cosmonaut in Medical Group 3 on 22 March 1972. His first flight into space occurred on Soyuz TM-6 in 1988. After staying aboard the Mir space station and conducting research for 240 days, Polyakov returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM-7. His first words upon return were &quot;We can fly to Mars.” 

Polyakov&#x27;s second spaceflight, the longest human spaceflight in history, began on 8 January 1994 with the launch of the Soyuz TM-18 mission. He spent approximately 437 days aboard Mir, conducting experiments and performing scientific research. During this flight, he completed just over 7,000 orbits of the Earth. On 9 January 1995, after 366 days in space, Polyakov formally broke the spaceflight duration record previously set by Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov six years earlier. He returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM-20 on 22 March 1995. Upon landing, Polyakov opted not to be carried the few feet between the Soyuz capsule and a nearby lawn chair, instead walking the short distance. In doing so, he wished to prove that humans could be physically capable of working on the surface of Mars after a long-duration transit phase.

Polyakov volunteered for his 437-day flight to learn how the human body would respond to the micro-gravity environment on long-duration missions to Mars. Upon returning from his second spaceflight, Polyakov held the record for the most total time in space. Data from Polyakov&#x27;s flight has been used by researchers to determine that humans are able to maintain a healthy mental state during long-duration spaceflight just as they would on Earth.

Polyakov underwent medical assessments before, during, and after the flight. He also underwent two follow-up examinations six months after returning to Earth. When researchers compared the results of these medical exams, it was revealed that although there were no impairments of cognitive functions, Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of increased workload during the first few weeks of spaceflight and return to Earth. Polyakov&#x27;s mood stabilized to pre-flight levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission. It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning to Earth. In light of these findings, researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights, such as crewed missions to Mars.

=== Spaceflights ===
* Soyuz TM-6 / Soyuz TM-7 – 28 August 1988, 04:23:11 UTC to 27 April 1989, 02:57:58 UTC – 241 days, 22 hours, 34 minutes and 47 seconds
* Soyuz TM-18 / Soyuz TM-20 – 8 January 1994, 10:05:34 UTC to 22 March 1995, 04:04:05 UTC – 437 days, 17 hours, 58 minutes and 31 seconds

== Later life ==
Polyakov retired from his position as a cosmonaut in June 1995, with a total of just over 678 days in space. He participated in experiment SFINCSS-99 (Simulation of Flight of International Crew on Space Station) in 1999. Polyakov was the Deputy Director of the Ministry of Public Health in Moscow, where he oversaw the medical aspects of long-duration space missions. He was a member of the Russian Chief Medical Commission, participating in the qualification and selection of cosmonauts. He also held membership in the International Space Researchers&#x27; Association and the International Academy of Astronautics. Polyakov was married and had one child.

After returning from space, Polyakov remained active in the discipline of international spaceflight, becoming a &quot;cosmonaut-investigator&quot; for the United States, Austria, Germany, and France during their respective space science missions to the Mir space station. He died on 7 September 2022 at the age of 80.

== Legacy ==
Polyakov won several awards for his spaceflight and academic achievements, including the Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of the Russian Federation, Order of Lenin, Order of the Legion of Honour, and the Order of Parasat. He was a member of organizations related to astronautics, including the Russian Chief Medical Commission on cosmonauts&#x27; certification.

Polyakov held the title of &quot;Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR&quot; and published several works pertaining to life sciences, medical aspects of space missions, and the results of research conducted on long-duration spaceflights.

Polyakov&#x27;s record for longest cumulative time in space of 678 days over two missions stood until surpassed in 1999 by cosmonaut Sergei Avdeyev with a total of 747 days in space during three different missions.

<doc id="873642" wikidata="Q903519" url="?curid=873642" title="Bread and Puppet Theater">
<text>The Bread and Puppet Theater (often known simply as Bread &amp; Puppet) is a politically radical puppet theater, active since the 1960s, based in Glover, Vermont. The theater was co-founded by Elka and Peter Schumann. Schumann is the artistic director.

The name Bread &amp; Puppet is derived from the theater&#x27;s practice of sharing its own fresh bread, served for free with aïoli, with the audience of each performance to create community, and from its central principle art should be as basic as bread to life. Some have heard echoes of the Roman phrase &quot;bread and circuses&quot; or the labor slogan &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; in the theater&#x27;s name as well, though these are not often mentioned in Bread &amp; Puppet&#x27;s own explanations of its name.

The Bread and Puppet Theater participates in parades including Independence Day celebrations, notably in Cabot, Vermont, with many effigies including a satirical Uncle Sam on stilts.

==History==
Peter and Elka Schumann founded the Bread &amp; Puppet Theater in 1963 in New York City. It was active during the Vietnam War in anti-war protests, primarily in New York City, prompting &quot;Time&quot; reviewer T.E. Kalem to remark in 1971, &quot;This virtual dumb show is as contemporary as tomorrow&#x27;s bombing raid.&quot; Many people remember it as central to the political spectacle of the time, as its enormous puppets (often ten to fifteen feet tall) were a fixture of many demonstrations. A Sicilian puppet show had inspired Schumann, and Bread &amp; Puppet inspired other groups across the continent, including Gary Botting&#x27;s Edmonton-based People &amp; Puppets Incorporated, which in the early 1970s also used effigies yards-high to depict political themes and social commentary in radical street theater. In 1970 the theater moved to Vermont, first to Goddard College in Plainfield, and then to a farm in Glover where it remains. The farm is home to a cow, several pigs, chickens, and puppeteers, as well as indoor and outdoor performance spaces, a printshop, a store, and a large museum showcasing over four decades of the company&#x27;s work. Bread &amp; Puppet has received National Endowment for the Arts grants, awards from the Puppeteers of America, and other organizations.

In 1984 and 1985 they toured colleges with an indoor play, &quot;The Door&quot;, which told the story of &quot;the massacre of Guatemalan and El Salvadorian Indians and the plight of refugees trying to escape through a diabolically opening and closing door to the North.&quot; With &quot;only minimal use of the spoken word&quot;, the play made its points &quot;with great simplicity and beauty&quot;.
Until 1998, Bread &amp; Puppet hosted its annual pageant and circus (in full, &quot;Our Domestic Resurrection Circus&quot;), in and around a natural amphitheater on its Glover grounds. In the 1990s, the festival began drawing crowds of tens of thousands, who camped on nearby farmers&#x27; land during the annual summer weekend of the pageant. The event became unmanageable, and concerned itself less with the theater&#x27;s performance. In 1998, a man was killed by accident in a fight while camping overnight for the festival, forcing director Peter Schumann to cancel the festival. Since then, the theater offers smaller weekend performances all summer, and traveled around New York and New England, with occasional tours around the U.S. and abroad. The theater runs a program where apprentices help produce and act in performances. In New York City, Bread &amp; Puppet performs at Theater for the New City during the holiday season each year.

=== &quot;Cheap Art&quot; and theater funding ===
The Bread &amp; Puppet Theater operates under what they call the &quot;Why Cheap Art&quot; manifesto. This principle states that art should be accessible to the public, not &quot;a privilege of museums &amp; the rich&quot;. The theater is quoted as claiming: &quot;art is not a business&quot;. Bread &amp; Puppet productions are free or paid for by donation, and related art is for sale &quot;for very little money&quot;.

The theater operates on a &quot;shoestring&quot; budget. This means that staff are historically paid as low as $35 a week (in 1977) and that many items used in the production of the theater, including clothing and raw puppet materials, are obtained second hand or by donation. The theater typically has been known to generate the funds necessary for production by going on tour. Although government grants are available to the theater, Schumann rejects the &quot;absurdity&quot; of grants for protest, insisting the lack of aid &quot;leaves him freer to experiment&quot;. This attitude towards business led Schumann to disband the communal company of the theater in 1973 out of concern that the theater was coming too close to a &quot;pattern of the professional theater&quot;. Disbanding the company gave Schumann &quot;uncompromising control&quot; over production.

&quot;Cheap art&quot; is said to be a core principle of the theater, and is reflected both in its ethics and in its aesthetics. Ethically, the theater is described as anticapitalist and generally is regarded as having a &quot;hippie&quot; viewpoint, Aesthetically, the theater is often described as &quot;slapdash&quot; or &quot;unsightly&quot;, as well as modest and &quot;distinctively homemade&quot;.

==Causes==
Specific causes supported by the theater include:
*Opposition to warfare
*Opposition to registering for the draft
*Opposition to the World Trade Organization
*Support of the shut down of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant
*Support for the Sandinista National Liberation Front revolution in Nicaragua (1979–1990)
*The Zapatista uprising of 1994
*The MOVE organization

== Works ==
=== Performances ===

==== &quot;Fire&quot; (1965) ====
An hour long play that critiqued the ongoing war in Vietnam. It was dedicated to American protesters who died after setting fire to themselves and depicted life for Vietnamese villagers during the war.

==== &quot;Birdcatcher in Hell&quot; (1971) ====
A kyōgen that critiqued President Nixon&#x27;s pardoning of soldiers involved in the My Lai massacre.

==== &quot;Stations of the Cross&quot; (1972) ====
Described by Larry Gordon, at the time the general manager of the company, as a &quot;partially metaphoric [and] partially literal&quot; rendering, &quot;Stations of the Cross&quot; was a contemporary interpretation of the New Testament story of Jesus&#x27; suffering on the way to his eventual crucifixion. Gordon provided the music direction for the production, the first time Sacred Harp music was performed at Bread and Puppet. Elka Schumann stated that the production was also a metaphor for the Cuban Missile Crisis.

==== &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1979) ====
A show that incorporated musical instruments and puppetry into a retelling of the story of St. Joan. This work also had a revival in 1999.
Taiwan is the first Asian country to show the new version of &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; in 2009.

==== &quot;Mending the Sky&quot;/&quot;Bu Tian&quot; (1994) ====
A collaboration between Bread and Puppet Theater and the 425 Environmental Theatre in Taipei, Taiwan. The play focused on current pollution issues in Taiwan through references to traditional Chinese mythology. In particular, the show depicted the goddess Nüwa and called attention to the pollution of the Tamsui River in its first performances. Later performances focused on different geographical features affected by pollution depending on where the show took place. For example, the work focused on the Love River when it was shown in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Overall, the effectiveness of this collaboration was called into question because many of the members of the 425 Environmental Theatre engaged in environmentally harmful practices (such as smoking) and a part of the show involved burning a puppet which created a considerable amount of black smoke. Still, the work received praise from critics for its relevant social messages.

==== &quot;Bread Baker&#x27;s Cantata&quot; (1999) ====
Performed alongside the revival of &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;. It was a slow paced play that depicted an old woman&#x27;s last day on Earth using singers and actors.

In addition to the theater, some of the Bread &amp; Puppet puppeteers operate the Bread &amp; Puppet Press, directed by Elka Schumann, who is Peter Schumann&#x27;s wife (and granddaughter of Scott Nearing). The press produces posters, cards and books on the theater&#x27;s themes as well as other forms of &quot;cheap art&quot;.

==Conflicts==
===2000 Republican National Convention===
Bread &amp; Puppet volunteers were among the 79 people arrested at a warehouse in Philadelphia during the 2000 Republican National Convention. The Associated Press reported the scene of the &quot;SWAT-style&quot; raid was broadcast live by news helicopters. Years later, the AP explained there &quot;was tense talk (later proved unfounded) of terrorist plots being hatched in the &#x27;puppetista&#x27; headquarters, of bomb building and anarchist-fueled mayhem&quot;. Its report did not include the police&#x27;s side of the story.

&quot;A couple of our folks were down there, helping to build puppets&quot;, said Linda Elbow, company manager for Bread &amp; Puppet. &quot;The cops went into the studio ... arrested people, and took the puppets. So, now, puppets are criminals.&quot;

===2001 Halloween Parade===
The Bread &amp; Puppet Theater is a regular participant in New York&#x27;s Village Halloween Parade, noted for its use of giant puppets. In 2001, Bread &amp; Puppet did not march in the parade. The theater&#x27;s plans that year included a presentation protesting the War in Afghanistan. The Halloween parade was to occur fifty days after and 1.5 miles away from the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. It was this attack which was the pretext for starting the war which Bread &amp; Puppet Theater was protesting, and the company&#x27;s &quot;anti-war stance&quot; reportedly &quot;already placed it at odds with some New Yorkers&quot;, according to Dan Bacalzo of TheaterMania.com. Many of the parade&#x27;s macabre elements were suspended that year by its director Jeanne Fleming. It was not known until October 25 whether it would even take place.

Linda Elbow commented, &quot;We certainly weren&#x27;t saying &#x27;Hooray for the terrorists.&#x27; We were saying, &#x27;Look what you&#x27;re doing to the people of Afghanistan. An unattributed quote in Bacalzo&#x27;s report — &quot;What you&#x27;re bringing, we don&#x27;t want&quot; — suggests it was the group&#x27;s selection of material that was unwelcome, not the group itself. The report did not make it clear how the decision was made, or who made it; the incident was included as secondary background material in a piece publicizing an upcoming Bread &amp; Puppet show. Fleming, who was not interviewed by Bacalzo (but is quoted as if she was), says that Bread &amp; Puppet was not &quot;disinvited&quot;, adding that it was she who first invited the company to march in the parade when she took over as organizer.

In December 2001 the theater returned to New York with &quot;The Insurrection Mass with Funeral March for a Rotten Idea: A Special Mass for the Aftermath of the Events of September 11th&quot;. It was presented at Theater for the New City, and billed as &quot;a nonreligious service in the presence of several papier-mâché gods&quot;. &quot;Insurrection masses&quot; are a common format for the Bread &amp; Puppet Theater, as are such &quot;funerals&quot;, though the &quot;rotten&quot; ideas change.

==Critics&#x27; comments==

Writers who praised Bread &amp; Puppet include historian Howard Zinn, who cited its &quot;magic, beauty, and power&quot;, and poet and NPR commentator Andrei Codrescu, who wrote: &quot;The Bread &amp; Puppet Theater has been so long a part of America&#x27;s conscious struggle for our better selves, that it has become, paradoxically, a fixture of our subconscious.&quot;

The theater&#x27;s protestations of the Vietnam war and message of peace generally received positive television coverage, as noted in peace focused magazine &quot;WIN&quot;. Keith Lampe, in &quot;WIN&quot;, also positively comments on the theater&#x27;s 1966 anti-war demonstration by commending Peter Schumann&#x27;s &quot;concern for movement&quot;, &quot;sound&quot;, and &quot;appearance&quot;.

In a 2015 criticism of the theater&#x27;s production &quot;The Seditious Conspiracy Theater Presents: A Monument to the Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Oscar Lopez Rivera&quot;, Gia Kourlas describes the show as &quot;patchy&quot;, at times &quot;more cute than pointed&quot;, and seemingly &quot;preaching to the converted&quot;.

==Reference in popular media==
The Bread &amp; Puppet Theater has a visual reference in the 2007 Julie Taymor film &quot;Across the Universe&quot;. The movie replicated characters such as Uncle Fatso, Washer Women, White Ladies, and the many armed Mother head. The Bread &amp; Puppet Circus Band also has a reference in the costumes of the circus band during &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;. The difference between the real life costumes and the ones made for the movie is the real life ones are red and black, whereas in the movie they are white and black. The Bread &amp; Puppet Theater is in the film&#x27;s credits.

In her 2008 memoir &quot;A Freewheelin&#x27; Time: A Memoir of Greenwich Village In The Sixties&quot;, New York painter and illustrator, Suze Rotolo, notes she worked a fabrication job with Bread &amp; Puppet early in 1963 near Delancey Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Rotolo, at the time, was the girlfriend and muse of Bob Dylan and was the inspiration for the songs &quot;Suze (The Cough Song)&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s Alright&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Is a Long Time&quot;, &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot;, and &quot;Boots of Spanish Leather&quot;.

<text>The 28th Canadian Parliament was in session from September 12, 1968, until September 1, 1972. The membership was set by the 1968 federal election on June 25, 1968, and it changed only slightly due to resignations and by-elections until it was dissolved prior to the 1972 election.

It was controlled by a Liberal Party majority under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the 20th Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was the Progressive Conservative Party led by Robert Stanfield.

The Speaker was Lucien Lamoureux. See also List of Canadian electoral districts 1966-1976 for a list of the ridings in this parliament.

<text>Kitikmeot Region (; Inuktitut: &quot;Qitirmiut&quot; ) is an administrative region of Nunavut, Canada. It consists of the southern and eastern parts of Victoria Island with the adjacent part of the mainland as far as the Boothia Peninsula, together with King William Island and the southern portion of Prince of Wales Island. The regional centre is Cambridge Bay (population 1,766;).

Before 1999, Kitikmeot Region existed under slightly different boundaries as Kitikmeot Region, Northwest Territories.

==Transportation==

Access to the territorial capital of Iqaluit is difficult and expensive as there were no direct flights from Kitikmeot Region communities to Iqaluit. For example, Iqaluit is approximately from Kugaaruk, the closest Kitikmeot community. A one-way flight to the capital costs between $2,691 and $2,911 (as of November 2016) and involves flying to, along with an overnight stay in, Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, approximately southwest of Kugaaruk—in total, a trip of about .

As is the case for the rest of Nunavut, there is no road access to the region and all places are fly-in. All five hamlets have certified airports: Cambridge Bay Airport, Gjoa Haven Airport, Kugaaruk Airport, Kugluktuk Airport and Taloyoak Airport, with scheduled flights by Canadian North.
There are also four registered aerodromes in the region. Cambridge Bay Water Aerodrome is a floatplane base open in the summer only. George Lake Aerodrome, an ice runway is only open from January to April, and serves the Back River Gold Project. Goose Lake Aerodrome also serves the Back River Gold Project and has both ice and gravel runways. Hope Bay Aerodrome serves the Hope Bay mine site and is a gravel runway. The former Doris Lake Aerodrome, was a ice runway, and was the longest in the region, it served the Doris Lake mine.

==Climate==
The Kitikmeot Region has a harsh subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;) and a tundra climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. 

==Politics==
The region is home to the only two communities in Nunavut that voted &quot;no&quot; in the 1982 division plebiscite: Cambridge Bay and Kugluktuk.

The region has four electoral districts;
*Cambridge Bay, which covers Bathurst Inlet, Cambridge Bay and Umingmaktok. The seat is held by Pamela Gross.
*Gjoa Haven, which covers the community of Gjoa Haven and is held by Tony Akoak.
*Kugluktuk, which covers Kugluktuk. The seat is currently held by Bobby Anavilok.
*Netsilik, which covers Taloyoak and Kugaaruk. The seat is held by Inagayuk Quqqiaq.

Former districts include Akulliq, which covered Kugaaruk and Naujaat in the Kivalliq Region. It was the only electoral district in Nunavut to cross two regions. Nattilik, which covered Gjoa Haven and Taloyoak. The previous incumbent was the former federal Minister of Health, Leona Aglukkaq.

In 2007 at their AGM, Bob Lyall, a board member of the Kitikmeot Inuit Association, suggested the formation of a political party called the &quot;Bloc Kitikmeot&quot; to run in the next general election and to advocate for a separate Kitikmeot Territory. Bobby Lyall, along with his brother Kitikmeot Corporation president, Charlie Lyall and delegates Martina and Connie Kapolak, argued that the Government of Nunavut had spent most of the infrastructure money available from the federal government in the Baffin Region (Qikiqtaaluk Region). However, the party was not formed and consequently no members ran for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut which continues to run as a consensus government.

The Kitikmeot Region also doubles as one of three census divisions in Nunavut, the others being the Kivalliq (also known as the Keewatin) and the Qikiqtaaluk (also known as the Baffin) regions. Of the three the Kitikmeot is the smallest in size being smaller than the Kivalliq. It has the smallest population and is the least densely populated of the three. The population is predominantly Inuit (90.0%) with 0.7% other aboriginal peoples, 0.3% North American Indian and 0.4% Métis, and 9.3% non-Aboriginals.

<text>George Eric Newby (6 December 1919 – 20 October 2006) was an English travel writer. His works include &quot;A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush&quot;, &quot;The Last Grain Race&quot; and &quot;A Small Place in Italy&quot;.

==Early life==
Newby was born in Barnes, London, and grew up near Hammersmith Bridge, London. His father, George, was a partner in a firm of wholesale dressmakers, and his mother, (Minnie) Hilda (née Pomeroy) had been a dress model at Harrods. Newby was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School; after leaving school he worked for two years at the Dorland advertising agency until 1938 when, at the age of 18, he apprenticed aboard the Finnish windjammer &quot;Moshulu&quot; and took part in the &quot;grain race&quot; from Australia to Europe by way of Cape Horn. This voyage was subsequently described in &quot;The Last Grain Race&quot; and pictorially documented in &quot;Learning the Ropes&quot;.

==Military career==
During the Second World War, Newby was commissioned in the Black Watch in 1940. As a junior officer in the Rajput Regiment of the British Indian Army, he studied for six months of 1941 in Fatehgarh, India, for the Lower Standard Urdu Examination that was required to command Indian troops abroad. After passing the examination he was posted to North Africa.

He served in the Black Watch and the Special Boat Section, and was captured during an operation against the coast of Sicily in August 1942. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1946 for his part in the raid.

Newby was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp, PG21, at Chieti, a few miles inland from Pescara on the Adriatic coast, and later to PG49 at Fontanellato, near Parma. Escaping with Michael Gilbert and other British prisoners after the Italian Armistice, he was helped to hide in the Apennine countryside by a Slovene anti-fascist woman, Vanda Škof (later Wanda Skof), who married him after the war and became a companion on his travels. These experiences were described in his memoir &quot;Love and War in the Apennines&quot;, which focuses on how he was helped by ordinary Italians. A film, &quot;In Love and War&quot;, was made in 2001 based on the book, starring Callum Blue as Newby and Barbora Bobuľová as Wanda. He was free until January 1944, when he was recaptured.

==Postwar career==
After the war, he spent 17 years working on and off in the women&#x27;s fashion business, described in the book &quot;Something Wholesale&quot; (1962). In 1956, he set out to climb Mir Samir in the Hindu Kush of Afghanistan with his friend Hugh Carless, an expedition later chronicled in &quot;A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush&quot;. The voyage included a chance meeting with the English explorer Wilfred Thesiger. From 1964 to 1973, Newby was Travel Editor for &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper.

==Later life and recognition==

In 1967, Newby and his wife began restoring a dilapidated farmhouse in the foothills of the Apuan Alps in Italy. &quot;A Small Place in Italy&quot;, a memoir of the couple&#x27;s experiences in renovating the house, was published in 1995.

Newby was awarded a CBE in 1994 and the Lifetime Achievement Award of the British Guild of Travel Writers in 2001. His life and work were profiled in ITV&#x27;s &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, directed by Tony Knox, in 1994. In the same decade, he made travelogues for the BBC, returning to Parma with his wife Wanda in The Travel Show (TV programme) (1994) and visiting one of his favourite cities, Istanbul (1996), both films directed by Paul Coueslant. 

Newby&#x27;s last published book was &quot;A Book of Lands and Peoples&quot;, which appeared in 2003. He died aged 86 in Guildford, Surrey.

<text>The Fairchild T-46 is an American light jet trainer aircraft of the 1980s. It was cancelled in 1986 with only three aircraft being produced.

==Design and development==
The United States Air Force (USAF) launched its Next Generation Trainer (NGT) program to replace the Cessna T-37 Tweet primary trainer in 1981. Fairchild-Republic submitted a shoulder-winged monoplane with a twin tail, powered by two Garrett F109 turbofans and with pilot and instructor sitting side by side. Part of the rationale was an expectation of increasing levels of general aviation traffic. A pressurized trainer would permit training at higher altitude, leading to fewer restrictions on the new pilots.

In order to validate the proposed aircraft&#x27;s design, and to explore its flight handling characteristics, Fairchild Republic contracted with Ames Industries of Bohemia, New York to build a flyable 62% scale version. Burt Rutan&#x27;s Rutan Aircraft Factory in Mojave, California was contracted to perform the flight test evaluations, with test pilot Dick Rutan doing the flying. The scale version was known at Rutan as the Model 73 NGT, this flying on 10 September 1981. One requirement was for the aircraft to be able to go into a spin, but to also have easy recovery from the spin. This was demonstrated using the Model 73 NGT.

Fairchild&#x27;s design, to be designated T-46, was announced winner of the competition on 2 July 1982, with the USAF placing an order for two prototypes and options for 54 production aircraft. It was planned to build 650 T-46s for the USAF by 1991.

The aircraft first flew on 15 October 1985, six months later than originally programmed date of 15 April. Costs had increased significantly during the development process, with the predicted unit cost rising from $1.5 million in 1982 to $3 million in February 1985. The 1985 Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act mandated spending cuts for the US government in an attempt to limit the national debt, and while testing did not reveal any major problems, Secretary of the Air Force Russell A. Rourke cancelled procurement of the T-46, while allowing limited development to continue. While attempts were made in Congress to reinstate the program, which resulted in the FY 1987 budget being delayed, an amendment was passed to the 1987 Appropriations Bill to forbid any spending on the T-46 until further evaluation of the T-46 against the T-37 and other trainers took place.

The project was cancelled a little more than a year later, . The T-46 was the last project of the Fairchild Republic Corporation, and after the program termination Fairchild had no more income. Without any new contracts and the NGT program cancelled, the company closed the Republic factory in Farmingdale, New York, bringing 60 years of Fairchild aircraft manufacturing to an end.

The aircraft itself featured a side-by-side configuration, a twin (or &quot;H&quot;) tail (similar to the company&#x27;s A-10), ejection seats, pressurization, and two turbofan engines. Had it gone into full production the NGT program called for 650 aircraft being built up to 1992. There was potential for some overseas sales as well, such as in the light ground attack role in addition to its role as a trainer.

<text>THERMCON was the code name of an FBI operation which was launched in response to the sabotage of the Arizona Snowbowl ski lift near Flagstaff, Arizona, in October 1987 by three people from Prescott, Arizona, Mark Davis, Margaret Millet and Marc Baker. In a November 1987 letter claiming responsibility, the group called themselves the &quot;Evan Mecham Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy&quot; (EMETIC). The group named themselves after Evan Mecham, the then-Governor of Arizona. The Arizona Snowbowl spent $50,000 repairing the damage.

==EMETIC==
EMETIC&#x27;s first act was to damage a chairlift at the Fairfield Snow Bowl near Flagstaff, Arizona. During the incident an acetylene torch was used to cut bolts from several of the lift&#x27;s support towers. A warning letter claiming responsibility for the damage also contained a threat to &quot;chain the Fairfield CEO to a tree at the 10,000 foot level and feed him shrubs and roots until he understands the suicidal folly of treating the planet primarily as a tool for making money.&quot; Upon receipt of the letter the resort shut down the lift in order to repair the over US$50,000 in damages caused by the EMETIC.

The EMETIC made two other attacks against targets the group considered to be causing ecological damage before the FBI began arresting group members. In May 1989, three people from Prescott, Arizona, Marc Leslie Davis, Margaret Katherine Millet and Marc Andre Baker, were arrested on charges related to the sabotage against the Fairfield Sun Bowl and on conspiracy charges to damage powerlines leading from nuclear power plants in Arizona, California and Colorado. A fourth EMETIC member, Ilse Washington Asplund, was later arrested on related charges. All four individuals pleaded guilty and were sentenced in September 1991.

Short for &quot;Thermite Conspiracy&quot; – thermite being an incendiary mixture of powdered aluminium and iron oxide – Operation THERMCON employed more than 50 FBI agents and involved the infiltration of the group between 1987 and 1989 by undercover FBI agent Michael Fain, and the recruitment of Ron Fraizer, a friend of the three, as an informant. Despite the name &quot;Thermite Conspiracy,&quot; cutting torches were the tool of choice for the group.

The operation culminated in the arrest of the three following an attempt to down a transmission tower in the Arizona desert which led from the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. Two additional persons were also indicted as a result. The fourth was Ilse Apslund, a friend of the three from Prescott. The fifth, Dave Foreman, at the time the leader of Earth First! based in Tucson, Arizona, was not involved in the group but was nonetheless charged with conspiracy, on the grounds that he had given a copy of the book &quot;Ecodefense&quot; inscribed &quot;happy monkeywrenching&quot; and a $100 donation to undercover agent Michael Fain.

==Trial==
The FBI claimed the group was planning similar attacks on other powerlines in Arizona, Colorado and California. FBI testimony during and after the trial characterized the group&#x27;s future plans as targeting powerlines to or from the Central Arizona Project Aqueduct, the Rocky Flats Plant, and the Diablo Canyon Power Plant.

Earth First! claimed the operation was intended to discredit Earth First! by linking its leaders to the conspiracy, particularly Dave Foreman. During the course of the operation, undercover agent Michael Fain (who used the name Mike Tait) was recorded saying &quot;I don&#x27;t really look for them to be doing a lot of hurting people... (Foreman) isn&#x27;t really the guy we need to pop – I mean in terms of an actual perpetrator. This is the guy we need to pop to send a message. And that&#x27;s all we&#x27;re really doing... Uh-oh! We don&#x27;t need that on tape! Hoo boy!&quot; According to an FBI field office file released to Earth First! activists Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney in 1996, FBI &quot;agents provocateurs&quot; associated with THERMCON spent two years winning the trust of the Prescott group, actively encouraging them to sabotage powerlines and attempting – unsuccessfully – to convince the group that they should use, and even offering to buy, explosives for this purpose. FBI agents also selected the site and purchased and transported cutting equipment prior to the sabotage attempt on May 30, 1989, leading to accusations of entrapment.

==Sentences==
Attorney Gerry Spence represented the defendants.
The four from Prescott entered into a plea bargain. Davis was sentenced to 6 years in prison and restitution of $19,821 to the Arizona Snowbowl. Millet was sentenced to 3 years and restitution of $19,821. Baker was sentenced to 6 months and a $5000 fine, and Asplund to 30 days and a $2000 fine. The four were sentenced in September 1991.

Dave Foreman&#x27;s case was separated from the other four and sentencing was deferred until 1996, when the charges were reduced to a single misdemeanor and he was fined $250.

<text>Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Serebrov (, 15 February 1944 – 12 November 2013) was a Soviet cosmonaut. He graduated from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (1967), and was selected as a cosmonaut on 1 December 1978. He retired on 10 May 1995. He was married and had one child.

Serebrov flew on Soyuz T-7, Soyuz T-8, Soyuz TM-8, and Soyuz TM-17. He was one of very few cosmonauts to fly for both the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation that followed it. He held the record for most spacewalks, 10, until Anatoly Solovyev surpassed it. In all, he spent 371.95 days in space. Serebrov contributed to the design of Salyut 6, Salyut 7, and the Mir space stations. He helped design, and, according to a New York Times obituary, &quot;was the first to test a one-person vehicle - popularly called a space motorcycle - to rescue space crews in distress and repair satellites.&quot; This vehicle, known as &quot;Icarus&quot;, was tested in February 1990, and remained onboard &quot;Mir&quot; for several years but was never used after that.

Serebrov died suddenly in Moscow on 12 November 2013, aged 69, and was buried on November 15 at Ostankinsky cemetery.

He is also known for playing &quot;Tetris&quot; on a Game Boy in the spacecraft, making it the first time a video game has ever been played in space.

<doc id="873663" wikidata="Q1561325" url="?curid=873663" title="HMS Otranto">
<text>HMS &quot;Otranto&quot; was an armed merchant cruiser requisitioned by the British Admiralty when World War I began in 1914. Built before the war for the UK–Australia run as SS &quot;Otranto&quot;, she was primarily used in the war to search for German commerce raiders. She played small roles in the Battle of Coronel in November 1914 when the German East Asia Squadron destroyed the British squadron searching for it and in the Battle of the Falkland Islands the following month when a British squadron annihilated the Germans in turn.

Apart from brief refits in the UK, Canada and Australia, she remained on this duty until early 1918 when she became a troop ship. During a severe storm off the Isle of Islay in late 1918, she accidentally collided with another troop ship, HMS &quot;Kashmir&quot; (1915) and was forced ashore by the storm, killing 470 passengers, mainly American soldiers, and crewmen.

==Description==
&quot;Otranto&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a moulded depth of . She had tonnages of and . The ship was powered with a pair of four-cylinder quadruple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller. The engines had a total power of and gave &quot;Otranto&quot; a top speed of . The ship had a capacity of 235 first-class, 186 second-class and 696 third-class passengers.

By 1913 &quot;Otranto&quot; was equipped for wireless telegraphy, operating on the 300 and 600 metre wavelengths. Her call sign was MOD.

==Construction==
&quot;Otranto&quot;, named after the Strait of Otranto between Italy and Albania, was built by Workman, Clark and Company at its Belfast shipyard as yard number 278. She was built for the Orient Steam Navigation Company&#x27;s England to Australia run. The first attempt to launch the ship failed on 23 March 1909 as the tallow used to lubricate the slipway had frozen and &quot;Otranto&quot; ground to a halt after sliding only . Attempts to persuade her to resume her progress with hydraulic jacks failed and the slipway had to be partially rebuilt before she was successfully launched four days later. She was completed on 20 July and departed London on her maiden voyage to Brisbane, Australia, on 1 October.

==Passenger service==
&quot;Otranto&quot; had made two round-trips to Australia by January 1910, and then made a 17-day cruise in the Mediterranean.

The arrival of the British mails was always important to Australia, and the installation of wireless telegraphy equipment, even more so. It was reported on 13 July 1910 as follows: ARRIVAL OF THE OTRANTO. Well up to cabled time, the R.M.S. Otranto arrived from London, via ports, early yesterday morning, and, after being granted pratique, made fast to the quay a little before 9 o&#x27;clock Captain Coad reported an uneventful voyage. Fine weather was experienced to Cape Guardafui, but from that point to Minikoi Island a strong south-west monsoon was met with. After leaving Colombo moderate south-east trades were encountered accompanied by a heavy southerly swell. The Otranto is the first of the new Orient liners to be fitted with wireless, and during her present trip she was able to maintain communication with 23 shore stations and 45 steamers. A full account of the Johnson-Jeffries fight was received from the Macedonia&#x27;s operator on Monday. The Otranto, after discharging cargo, resumed her voyage to the Eastern States at 3.30 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon. MAILS BY THE OTRANTO. One hundred and forty-two packages of parcel posts and 1,690 bags of mails comprise the total shipment of mails brought to hand by the R.M.S. Otranto. Western Australia&#x27;s proportion consists of 164 bags, whilst the balance is distributed as follows:— Adelaide, 125; Melbourne, 272; Geelong, 8; Ballarat, 18; Bendigo, 10; New South Wales, 346; Queensland, 169; Tasmania, 45; New Zealand, 495; H.M. fleet, 18; Noumea, 30. THE OTRANTO&#x27;S OFFICERS. Captain A. J. Coad. of the R.M.S. Otranto, has associated with him this voyage the following officers:— L. S. Brooke-Smith, first officer; H. G. C. Adams, second officer; J. J. Hayes, third officer; E. E. Smith, fourth officer; C. J. Hill, fifth officer; H. Newman, purser; H. E. Bloxsome, surgeon; G. T. Greig, chief engineer; E. F. Jeffrey, assistant purser.

She resumed her London–Australia runs into early 1910. That year, the company was awarded a contract to carry mail and she was redesignated as RMS &quot;Otranto&quot;, the RMS standing for Royal Mail Ship. She was present at King George V&#x27;s Coronation Naval Review on 26 June and made several voyages to the Norwegian fjords before mid-September when she returned to the Australia run, on which she remained until war was declared on Germany on 4 August 1914.

==Auxiliary cruiser==
===Conversion===
The Admiralty requisitioned &quot;Otranto&quot; on that same day for conversion to an armed merchant cruiser, having eight quick-firing (QF) guns fitted. A rangefinder was installed on the bridge and her fore and aft holds were refitted as magazines. Half-inch (12.7 mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering gear and her interior cabin bulkheads and glass ventilators were removed to reduce damage from splinters. Her furniture was removed to make room for the mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops and sailors and an operating room and sickbay were installed amidships.

===Naval duties commence===
The work was completed on 13 August and she was commissioned as HMS &quot;Otranto&quot; the next day. The ship departed the UK on 17 August, the second armed merchant cruiser to leave England, with sealed orders that assigned her to Rear Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock&#x27;s West Indies Squadron in the South Atlantic. &quot;Otranto&quot; rendezvoused with the squadron on 27 August off the coast of Brazil where she patrolled the coast of South America between Chile and Montevideo, Uruguay, fruitlessly searching for German commerce raiders, together with the armoured cruisers , and the light cruiser .

&quot;Otranto&quot; accompanied Cradock and three cruisers to patrol the Strait of Magellan and the Chilean coast for German ships in mid-September. They failed to locate any of the German ships, but &quot;Otranto&quot; intercepted messages that indicated that German warships were operating in the area. Cradock concentrated his ships on the southwestern coast of South America in mid-October to prevent the East Asia Squadron under Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee from breaking through into the South Atlantic. In mid-October &quot;Otranto&quot; struck a rock while departing Port Legunas, Chile, but a diver from &quot;Monmouth&quot; reported that it had done very little damage.

===Battle of Coronel===
On 27 October Cradock ordered &quot;Otranto&quot; to investigate Puerto Montt for signs of German ships and sent &quot;Glasgow&quot; to Coronel, Chile, to pick up any information from the Admiralty. The latter ship heard very strong radio transmission from the light cruiser four days later and Cradock brought his other ships north to rendezvous off Coronel. He ordered &quot;Glasgow&quot; to return to Coronel to transmit his appreciation of the situation to the Admiralty and collect any orders from them. The latter ship rejoined the squadron on the afternoon of 1 November and Cradock formed his ships into a line at intervals to search for any Germans. At this time, both sides thought that they were in pursuit of a single light cruiser as a German merchantman had reported &quot;Glasgow&quot;″s presence in Coronel to von Spee earlier in the day.
&quot;Glasgow&quot; was the first British ship to sight the East Asia Squadron at 16:20 and &quot;Otranto&quot; confirmed the spotting five minutes later. Cradock reformed the squadron into a line-ahead formation with &quot;Otranto&quot; in the rear and steered south to intercept the Germans. Due to the heavy weather and head sea, &quot;Otranto&quot; could make no more than . After taking fire from the light cruiser and the armoured cruiser , her commander, Captain Edwards, ordered &quot;Otranto&quot; out of line, away from the Germans, and headed west at her best speed as she had no value against the German cruisers. &quot;Glasgow&quot; was the only other British ship to survive the battle.

&quot;Otranto&quot; was ordered to Montevideo to rendezvous with Rear Admiral Archibald Stoddart&#x27;s squadron and arrived there on 10 November. She patrolled the Brazilian coast and east to Sierra Leone for the next month before arriving at Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands on 16 December to serve as the islands&#x27; guard ship. There she remained until 4 February 1915 when she returned to the UK where she arrived at Birkenhead on 10 March to begin a refit where her 4.7-inch guns were replaced an equal number of weapons.

On 18 June, &quot;Otranto&quot; arrived at Punta Arenas, Chile to patrol the Pacific coast of South America. She remained on that duty for the next six months before departing on 18 December, via Easter Island, for Sydney, Australia for a refit at the Garden Island Dockyard. She arrived there on 14 January 1916 and departed on 5 March to return to her previous duty station. She arrived at Valparaiso, Chile, on 30 March and resumed her patrols. The ship received another refit at Esquimault, British Columbia, Canada, from October to December before leaving for the western coast of South America on 29 December. She arrived at Santa Elena, Ecuador, on 12 January 1917 and resumed her patrols. The ship arrived at Esquimalt for another refit on 2 October and arrived back at Santa Elena on 8 January 1918.

&quot;Otranto&quot; arrived at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 30 April and helped to salvage the cargo liner that had run aground on Ilhas das Maricás in the harbour on 6 May. On 16 May she escorted a convoy of 10 freighters to the UK where she arrived on 16 June. She then began a brief refit at HM Dockyard, Devonport. The ship arrived in New York City on 20 July where contractors fitted her with troop accommodations. &quot;Otranto&quot; departed on 8 August for her first trooping voyage and arrived at Liverpool on 20 August where she remained for several days before arriving back at New York City on 8 September.

===Last voyage and sinking===

Serving as the convoy flagship for Convoy HX 50, &quot;Otranto&quot; departed New York on 25 September. Six days later, on the evening of 1 October, the ship accidentally rammed the French fishing schooner &quot;Croisine&quot; off Newfoundland while the latter was returning home to St. Malo with a full load of cod. The fishing boat passed down the liner&#x27;s port side and its masts destroyed some of the liner&#x27;s lifeboats on that side. Captain Ernest Davidson, who was also commodore of the convoy, ordered the convoy to continue while &quot;Otranto&quot; stopped to rescue the 37 survivors. The derelict &quot;Croisine&quot; was now a menace to navigation and Davidson ordered his gun crews to sink her later that evening. The liner caught back up with the convoy by daybreak. The following day, the first death from the influenza pandemic occurred and the soldier was buried at sea. Only one other flu death aboard &quot;Otranto&quot; is recorded, but others may have occurred before she met her end.

The convoy encountered a strong storm on 4 October that got even stronger over the next several days; by the morning of 6 October it was assessed as a Force 11 storm on the Beaufort scale with mountainous seas. The storm forced the British destroyers that were to rendezvous with them back into port on 5 October and the last American escort departed at 06:00. The weather prevented accurate navigation and the convoy was forced to proceed by dead reckoning. The ship&#x27;s officers were uncertain if they were off the northern coast of Ireland or the western coast of Scotland. When dawn broke it revealed a rocky coastline to their east, just ahead of the convoy. Most of the ships correctly thought this was the Scottish coast and turned south, but &quot;Otranto&quot;″s Officer of the Watch thought that it was the Irish coast and turned north. , another liner turned troopship, was only about a half-mile (0.80 km) to &quot;Otranto&quot;″s north and the turns placed them on a collision course. Both ships attempted to avoid the collision, but their efforts cancelled out and &quot;Kashmir&quot; rammed &quot;Otranto&quot; on the port side amidships, a few miles off the rocky coast of Islay.

The impact punched a hole some deep and wide in &quot;Otranto&quot;, from below the waterline up to the boat deck. The hole was right at the bulkhead between the fore and aft stokeholds (boiler rooms) and both instantly flooded, killing most of the crewmen in those spaces. When the engine room flooded shortly afterwards, &quot;Otranto&quot; lost all electrical power and began to drift towards the cliffs of Islay. The water pressure caused other bulkheads to collapse, quickly flooding other spaces below the waterline and giving the ship a massive list to starboard. The impact also damaged many of the remaining lifeboats on that side. The crew attempted to use collision mats to cover the hole in the ship&#x27;s side, but it proved to be too large. &quot;Kashmir&quot;″s bow was crushed by the impact, although she was able to steam off when a wave forced the two ships apart soon after the collision.

The high winds and heavy seas prevented the launching of any lifeboats and Davidson had decided not to abandon ship just yet in the faint hope that some passengers and crewmen might be able to swim ashore once the ship got closer. About a half-hour after the collision, the destroyer appeared after searching for the convoy during the night. Despite Davidson&#x27;s order to stand clear, &quot;Mounsey&quot;″s captain, Lieutenant Francis Craven, positioned his ship on &quot;Otranto&quot;″s lee side to allow the men aboard the liner to jump aboard. Several times the two ships struck and the destroyer&#x27;s hull was holed, her bridge smashed, two of three boiler rooms flooded, and many hull frames were broken by the force of the impacts. Nonetheless, Craven kept his small ship close and was able to rescue 300 American troops, 266 officers and crewmen from &quot;Otranto&quot;, one YMCA morale officer and 30 French fishermen, although many more men had been washed from the decks or crushed between the two ships. Despite the weight of the rescued men and the damage sustained in the rescue, &quot;Mounsey&quot; was able to reach Belfast safely although she was too badly damaged to return to her own home port against the storm.

About three hours after the collision, a large wave dropped &quot;Otranto&quot; onto &quot;Old Women&#x27;s Reef&quot;, about three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) offshore, near the entrance to Machir Bay, missing a sandy beach just north of the reef. The action of the enormous waves quickly broke the ship in half and then ripped her bottom out. Of the roughly 489 men aboard after &quot;Mounsey&quot; departed, only 21 (17 of these were American) were able to successfully swim ashore, although two of these, including one American, later died of their injuries. The islanders were able to rescue some of these men by pulling them up the coastal cliffs or from rocks just offshore. By the following morning, the liner had been completely demolished by the heavy seas and the coastline was strewn with wreckage and hundreds of bodies in piles up to deep. A total of 316 Americans were found and buried on Islay and the nearby island of Muck.

The police sergeant at Bowmore, Malcolm McNeill, the maternal grandfather of a later (1999-2004) NATO general secretary, George Robertson, commended local people in his report: &#x27;though they had so little, they gave so much to help&#x27; and also responded to enquiries from the American families of those lost from the &quot;Otranto&quot; (and in the 1918 &quot;SS Tuscania&quot; sinking).

====Aftermath====
Craven was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Navy Cross for gallantry displayed in &quot;Mounsey&quot;″s rescue operation. The best estimate of the casualty toll from the disaster is a total of 470 men: 12 officers and 84 crewmen from &quot;Otranto&quot;, 1 officer and 357 American enlisted men, and 6 French fishermen. After the war, most of the American bodies were reinterred at Brookwood American Cemetery and Memorial in Surrey, England, or repatriated to the United States. And an stone tower was built on the Mull of Oa by the American Red Cross to commemorate the men lost aboard &quot;Otranto&quot; and which was sunk by a German U-boat nearby. The remains of the wreck were later salvaged by Keith Jessop.

<text>Peter Schumann (born 11 June 1934) is the co-founder and director of the Bread &amp; Puppet Theater. Born in Silesia, he was a sculptor and dancer in Germany before moving to the United States in 1961. In 1963 he founded Bread &amp; Puppet in New York City, and in 1970 moved to the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont, eventually settling in Glover, Vermont, where the company still performs. Schumann&#x27;s best known work is the Domestic Resurrection Circus, performed annually by the Bread and Puppet Theater until 1998. He was married to theater co-founder Elka Schumann until her death in August 2021.

==The Bread and Puppet Theater==
Peter Schumann and his wife Elka co-founded the Bread and Puppet Theater in 1963 in New York City. The theater is named for its combination of puppetry shows with free freshly baked bread, generally served with a dipping sauce. The company is known, according to &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; for &quot;anarchic, noncommercial, participatory and politically charged approach to art.&quot; Among the notable Bread and Puppet Theater shows directed by Schumann are &quot;Nativity 1992&quot;, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;an exemplar of performance folk art&quot;, and &quot;The Divine Reality Comedy&quot;. He also participated in the Angry Arts week in January 1967.

==The Domestic Resurrection Circus==
After Bread &amp; Puppet&#x27;s first decade in New York City, Schumann decided to take an offer from Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont, to become the college&#x27;s first theater-in-residence. After a few years, Schumann composed his first Domestic Resurrection Circus. Blending vaudeville comedy with political commentary, as well as the company&#x27;s trademark giant puppets, the Circus became a tradition each summer. After Schumann moved to Glover, Vermont, in 1973, the Circuses continued. The Domestic Resurrection Circus&#x27;s last year was 1998, when over 30,000 people attended. Since then, a smaller circus is performed every weekend during the summer.

==Palestine exhibits==
In 2007 Schumann premiered &quot;Independence Paintings: Inspired by Four Stories&quot; in Boston and Burlington, Vermont. The series was inspired by ten days Schumann spent in the Occupied Territories of Palestine, as well as John Hersey&#x27;s &#x27;The Wall&#x27;, a graphic account of the birth, development, and destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto, the largest of the Jewish ghettos established by Nazi Germany during the Jewish Holocaust. The series proved controversial, with critics labeling Schumann&#x27;s works as &quot;anti-Zionist&quot;, &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; and &quot;soft-core Holocaust denial&quot;, accusations Schumann denied, stating that &quot;I&#x27;m not saying that what&#x27;s happening in Palestine is the same as what happened in Warsaw ... but it&#x27;s certainly a reminder.&quot; While Schumann later acknowledged that he &quot;may have unnecessarily hurt some people&#x27;s feelings&quot; with the series, he returned in 2008 to the theme of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in his subsequent art series, &quot;The University of Majd: The Story of a Palestinian Youth&quot;, which addresses a case of false imprisonment in Israel.

<text>James McMillan (May 12, 1838 – August 10, 1902) was an American politician and businessman who was a Republican U.S. Senator from Michigan, as well as the chair of the McMillan Commission.

==Biography==
McMillan was born in Hamilton, Upper Canada, to William and Grace McMillan, both Scottish natives. He attended Hamilton public schools before moving to Detroit, Michigan, in 1855 to embark on a career in business. McMillan&#x27;s first position was as a clerk for Buhl, Ducharme &amp; Co., a wholesale hardware firm. At the age of 20, he left to become the purchasing agent for the Detroit &amp; Milwaukee Railway. In 1863, he helped, along with John Stoughton Newberry, to organize the Michigan Car Company for the manufacture of freight cars. This business grew very rapidly, and in ten years it was one of the largest in the United States. Its success led to the formation of the Detroit Car Wheel Co., the Baugh Steam Forge Co., the Detroit Iron Furnace Co., and the Vulcan Furnace Co. He was also a major shareholder in the Detroit City Railway.

McMillan later built and became president of the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway. He was largely interested in shipbuilding and lake transportation companies. He was one of the largest owners of the Detroit and Cleveland Steam Navigation Co., and the Detroit Transportation Co., and was a director of several banks in Detroit. For three years he was president of the Detroit Board of Park Commissioners and for four years a member of the Detroit Board of Estimates. In 1886, he joined with John S. Newberry in contributing $100,000 each for the maintenance of a hospital in Detroit.

McMillan was the only person to be elected Chairman of the Michigan Republican Party three non-consecutive times (1879, 1886 and 1890). He was a presidential elector on the Republican ticket in 1884. He was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1889 and was reelected in 1895 and 1901, serving from March 4, 1889, until his death. He was a dominant figure in the party, leading the business interests especially in opposition to Progressive reformer Governor Hazen S. Pingree in 1897–1900.

He was chairman of the Committee on Manufactures in the 51st and 52nd congresses, and of the Committee on the District of Columbia in the 54th through 57th congresses. He is also remembered for his chairmanship of the Senate Park Improvement Commission of the District of Columbia (better known as the McMillan Commission), which recommended the redesign of the National Mall to better reflect Pierre (Peter) Charles L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan for Washington, D.C. The McMillan Reservoir and the McMillan Sand Filtration Site in DC also bear his name.

==Death==
McMillan died in Manchester, Massachusetts, and is interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. He was survived by his wife Mary and their six children: William Charles, Grace Fisher, James Howard, Amy (wife of Sir John Lane Harrington, British ambassador to Ethiopia), Philip Hamilton and Francis Wetmore. Through his son James Howard McMillan, James is the great-great-grandfather of Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, the mother of Princess Delphine of Belgium (&quot;Delphine Michèle Anne Marie Ghislaine de Saxe-Cobourg&quot;; born February 22, 1968), known previously as &quot;Jonkvrouw&quot; Delphine Boël, is a Belgian artist and member of the Belgian royal family. She is the daughter of King Albert II of Belgium with Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and the half-sister of King Philippe of Belgium. Before October 1, 2020, she belonged to the Belgian titled nobility and was legally Jonkvrouw Boël. On that date, she was lawfully recognised as Princess of Belgium with the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;.

<text>Viktoriya Anatoliïvna Pavlysh (; born 15 January 1969 in Kharkov, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union) is a former Ukrainian track and field athlete who specialized in the shot put.

Pavlysh was stripped of her 1999 IAAF World Indoor Championships gold medal after she had tested positive for anabolic steroid stanozolol at the event in Maebashi, Japan. She claimed that she may have taken the drug to aid her recovery from injury. For this offence she received a two-year ban.

Five years later at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Budapest, Hungary she won the title again only to fail the drug test for the same reason. She was again stripped of her title and banned from athletics for life.

Whether because of her drug-use or not, Pavlysh was famed for her very muscular lower body. During a state television show her middle-thigh was measured at 98 cm and her calf at 65 cm.

The city was passed to Yadavas after Chalukya&#x27;s demise. In 1347, the area was conquered by the Bahmani Sultanate. After the split of the Bahmani Sultanate, the Bijapur Sultanate ruled from the city.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The Bijapur district is historically, traditionally and legendarily, one of the richest districts in the state. Evidence found here reveals that it was an inhabited place since the Stone Age. The history of this district is divided into four periods, from the Chalukya acquisition of Badami till the Muslim invasion.

The early Western Chalukya period lasted from about 535 to about 757; the Rastrakuta period from 757 to 973; the Kalachuri and Hoysala period from 973 to about 1200; the Devagiri Yadava period from 1185 to the Muslim conquest of Devagiri in 1312.

=== Bahmani and Bijapur Sultanates ===
Bijapur first came under the influence of Alauddin Khalji, the Sultan of Delhi, towards the end of the 13th century, and then under the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347. In 1347, when the Bahamani Sultanate was established, it included the southern and eastern parts of Bijapur district. The Sultanate was divided into several provinces, (tarafs) including Bijapur. The capital of the province was Bijapur, with boundaries extending to present parts of North Karnataka south and west of Maharashtra including the Konkan, and was a centre for trading overseas. The supremacy of the Bahmanis and authority over its provinces ceased by 1490. At that time five dynasties were born, and one of them was the Adil Shahi dynasty. In 1518, the Bahmani Sultanate formally split into five splinter states known as the Deccan sultanates, ruled by the aforementioned five dynasties. The sultans of the Bijapur Sultanate ruled from 1490 to 1686. The city of Bijapur owes much of its greatness to Yusuf Adil Shah, the founder of the independent state of Bijapur, sultan Ali Adil Shah I, who fortified the city and grew its working class population, and Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur. At its peak under the Bijapur Sultanate in the early 17th century, half a million to a million people were estimated to have inhabited the city.

The Mughal emperor Aurangazeb conquered Bijapur from the Adil Shahis in 1686 and had two years prior turned Bijapur into a subah. Disease and other natural events resulting in large-scale death following the Mughal conquest significantly reduced the city&#x27;s population. Bijapur was under Mughal rule up to 1723. In 1724 the Nizam of Hyderabad State established his independence in the Deccan and included Bijapur within his dominion. However, his acquisition on this portion was of brief duration, and in 1760 it went into the hands of the Maratha Confederacy.
=== British Colonial period ===
After the 1818 defeat of the Peshwa by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Bijapur passed into the hands of the British East India Company, and was assigned to the Maratha princely state Satara.

In 1817, war broke out between the British and the Marathas. By 1818, the whole of Bijapur was occupied by the British and was included in the territory assigned to the Raja of Satara. In 1848 the territory of Satara was obtained through the failure of heir and the British rule started. Till 1884, the Bijapur district had headquarters at Kaladagi. Bijapur was made headquarters in 1885.

=== Post-Independence ===
After Independence, the movement for re-organisation of States gained further momentum and on 1 November 1956 a separate &quot;Mysore State&quot; was formed. By the wish of the people it was renamed as &quot;Karnataka&quot;. Thus, the district Bijapur along with other Kannada speaking areas became a part of &quot;Karnataka State&quot; on 1 November 1956.

Central government had approved the request to rename the city in October 2014 from Bijapur to &quot;Vijayapura&quot; on 1 November 2014.

Bijapur is well connected by rail with Bangalore and other major cities of India (Mumbai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Hubli and Solapur). It has its own railhead that is located just from the main town.

Bijapur railway station is connected by a broad-gauge railway (Gadag–Hotgi railway line) to Hotgi Junction near Solapur railway station and Kurduvadi railway station on Central Railway towards the north and to Bagalkote and Gadag junction on South Western Railway towards the south. Bijapur is connected with direct trains to Solapur, Bagalkote, Gadag, Dharwad, Ballari, Yeswanthpur (Bangalore), Hubli, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. Bijapur comes under Hubli division of South Western Railway (SWR)

&quot;Direct railway line to Gulbarga and Belgaum&quot;

Bijapur–Shahabad is a proposed new railway line (via Devar Hippargi, Sindgi, Jewargi) and was sanctioned in the state budget of 2010–11.

Bijapur–Shedbal is a proposed new railway line (via Tikota, Athani, Shedbal) survey has been completed and submitted to South Western Railway Hubli.

GoK&#x27;s intention is to develop Bijapur - Gulbarga belt as a cement &amp; steel hub, which has created a need for a direct railway line between Bijapur and Shahabad. This would also be able to carry coal from the Jharkhand and Singareni collieries for NTPC&#x27;s 4000 MW Power Project in Kudagi (Basavana Bagewadi Taluk). The Bijapur–Shahabad line would run and be under the South Western Railway. Partial private sector financing is required; however, state government will contribute two-thirds of the project cost of the railway line, which is estimated at Rs. 12 billion over the first five years, in a role as an investor in return for a share in the profits.

A similar proposal has been made for sugar belt on the Bijapur Athani Belgaum new line, which will also provide shorter connectivity from Goa to Solapur, Gulbarga, Bidar, Nagpur, Kolkata. The line would run and be under South Western Railway, if project is taken into consideration it will be on 50:50 cost sharing basis on both state and railways.

<doc id="873707" wikidata="Q14703190" url="?curid=873707" title="Fleet admiral (United States)">
<text>Fleet admiral (abbreviated FADM) is a five-star flag officer rank in the United States Navy whose rewards uniquely include active duty pay for life. Fleet admiral ranks immediately above admiral and is equivalent to General of the Army and General of the Air Force. It is the same as the discontinued Admiral of the Navy.

Although it is a current and authorized rank, no U.S. Navy officer holds it presently. Only four World War II era officers have ever held the rank: William D. Leahy, Ernest J. King, Chester W. Nimitz, and William Halsey Jr. Leahy, King, and Nimitz were promoted to the rank in December 1944, followed by Halsey in December 1945. While all four men effectively retired in the late 1940s, the rank of fleet admiral is for life. The last active fleet admiral was Nimitz, who died in 1966.

==History==
===Post Spanish–American War===
The Navy originally had an established precursor 5-star rank of Admiral of the Navy, that was superior to Admiral. 
The rank used the 1867 regulation Admiral insignia. This rank was established and given only to Admiral George Dewey, in recognition of his victory at Manila Bay in 1898. On March 2, 1899, Congress passed approving the creation of the rank. The Senate confirmed Dewey&#x27;s promotion to that rank on March 14, 1903, and he was officially promoted to Admiral of the Navy on March 24, 1903, with a retroactive date-of-rank of March 2, 1899. The congressional act also stipulated that upon Dewey&#x27;s death, the rank would cease to exist. Dewey died on January 16, 1917, ending the Navy&#x27;s use of the rank.

===World War II===
A proper five-star rank of fleet admiral was created in 1944 in order to give United States military officers comparable rank to five-star officers of allied nations. The rank of fleet admiral was created by an Act of Congress for four officers to hold on a temporary basis under Pub.L. on December 14, 1944. The rank was made permanent for the four individual holders by on March 23, 1946. Although Congress authorized the promotion of Omar Bradley to the five-star rank of General of the Army in 1950 while serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff so that he would be of the same rank as General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the theater commander in Korea, there has been no new legislation authorizing the use of the rank of fleet admiral since 1946.

It was held during and after World War II by the following officers:

The timing of the first three appointments was carefully planned, such that a clear order of seniority and a near-equivalence between the services was established for the Generals of the Army promoted at the same time. 

Admiral Leahy acted as an executive Chief of Staff over Admiral King and General Marshall and briefed President Franklin D. Roosevelt. King coordinated all naval operations. Nimitz commanded all naval operations in the Pacific Ocean area. Halsey received his promotion based on his successes. 

George C. Marshall was promoted to General of the Army on December 16, 1944; General MacArthur was promoted on December 18, 1944; General Eisenhower was promoted on December 20, 1944, and General Arnold was promoted on December 21, 1944. Arnold would later be laterally promoted to General of the Air Force on May 7, 1949, after the Air Force was created as a separate service as part of the National Defense Act of 1947.

The insignia for a fleet admiral is composed of five silver stars in a pentagonal design. Worn on the service dress blue uniform sleeve was a gold stripe two inches wide surrounding the sleeve two inches from the cuff with four half-inch stripes placed at inch intervals. The single gold five-pointed star, one ray down, worn above the top stripe was not part of the rank, but indicated the wearer to be a line officer.

===Post–World War II===
Another contender to receive the rank of fleet admiral was Admiral Raymond A. Spruance; the choice between him and Halsey was an issue that occupied several months of deliberation, before Admiral King finally chose Halsey. Purportedly U.S. Representative Carl Vinson, chairman of the House Armed Services committee and a strong supporter of Halsey, was responsible for blocking subsequent efforts to promote Spruance to fleet admiral (although his promotion continued to be blocked after Vinson retired). Instead, Spruance&#x27;s achievements were recognized by the unique honor of a Special Act of Congress awarding him full four-star admiral&#x27;s salary during the remainder of his life. Spruance expressed the following feelings over the issue:

The first fleet admiral to leave active duty was Ernest King who retired immediately after the conclusion of World War II. Chester Nimitz and William Halsey both retired two years later while William Leahy was the last fleet admiral to leave active duty in 1949. According to Public Law 78-482, fleet admirals on active duty receive the same pay as a Rear Admiral, Upper Half (two star) plus a $5,000 personal allowance, and upon retirement were to receive 75% of their active duty pay. When Public Law 79-333 made the rank permanent for Leahy, King, Nimitz, and Halsey, it also provided for full pay and allowances once those officers retired. As with a general of the army, a fleet admiral was entitled to an office maintained by the Navy along with an aide (of the Naval rank of Captain), a secretary, and an orderly.

Three of the four fleet admirals died in the late 1950s and, by 1960, Chester Nimitz was the sole surviving U.S. Navy fleet admiral. He held a ceremonial post as Navy adviser to the Western Sea Frontier with his quarters based in San Francisco. Nimitz died in 1966 with no further fleet admirals appointed since.

===Modern usage===
The President, with consent from the Senate, may award a fifth star to Admirals. In the 1990s, there were proposals in Department of Defense academic circles to bestow a five-star rank on the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Military leaders in the Global War on Terrorism can be promoted to a five-star rank.

==Ranks senior to fleet admiral==
The Navy does not have an established rank senior to fleet admiral. The only officially recognized United States military rank senior to fleet admiral is General of the Armies when Congress passed in 1976, promoting George Washington to that rank and making him senior to all other grades of the Army, past or present.

<text>Helen Patricia Sharman (born 30 May 1963) is a British chemist and cosmonaut who became the first British person, first Western European woman and first privately funded woman in space, as well as the first woman to visit the &quot;Mir&quot; space station, in May 1991.

== Early life and education ==
Sharman was born in Grenoside, Sheffield, where she attended Grenoside Junior and Infant School, later moving to Greenhill. After studying at Jordanthorpe Comprehensive, she obtained a BSc degree in chemistry at the University of Sheffield in 1984 and a PhD degree from Birkbeck, the University of London in 1987. She worked as a research and development technologist for GEC in London and later as a chemist for Mars dealing with the flavouring properties of chocolate. This later led the UK press to label her &quot;The Girl from Mars&quot;.

== Project Juno ==

After responding to a radio advertisement asking for applicants to be the first British space explorer, Sharman was selected for the mission live on ITV, on 25 November 1989, ahead of nearly 13,000 other applicants. She was commuting home from work when she heard the radio advertisement. “Astronaut wanted. No experience necessary.”
The programme was known as Project Juno and was a cooperative Soviet–British mission co-sponsored by a group of British companies. Its aim was to enhance the relationship between the UK and the Soviet Union in the twilight years of the Cold War by sending a British astronaut to the Mir space station.

Sharman was selected in a process that gave weight to scientific, educational and aerospace backgrounds, as well as the ability to learn a foreign language.

Sharman would later recall that she was more excited about the training than the flying itself, stating “It wasn’t so much going to space as the training that appealed, living in Russia, learning the language, doing advanced mechanics. It was a way out of the rat race.”
Before flying, Sharman spent 18 months in intensive flight training in Star City, Moscow. She trained alongside her British back-up Major Tim Mace.
The Project Juno consortium failed to raise the money expected, and the programme was almost cancelled. With a view toward the flight&#x27;s impact on international relations, the project proceeded at Soviet expense although as a cost-saving measure, less expensive experiments were substituted for those in the original plans.

The Soyuz TM-12 mission, which included Soviet cosmonauts Anatoly Artsebarsky and Sergei Krikalev, launched on 18 May 1991 and lasted eight days, most of that time spent at the &quot;Mir&quot; space station. Sharman&#x27;s tasks included medical and agricultural tests, photographing the British Isles, and participating in a licensed amateur radio hookup with British schoolchildren. She landed aboard Soyuz TM-11 on 26 May 1991, along with Viktor Afanasyev and Musa Manarov. On the launch day, Sharman had a &quot;space passport&quot; with her in case they had to land outside Russia. She had also carried with her a butterfly brooch her father had given her and a photo of Queen Elizabeth II.

Sharman was 27 years and 11 months old when she went into space, making her () the sixth youngest of the 556 individuals who have flown in space. Sharman has not returned to space, although she was one of three British candidates in the 1992 European Space Agency astronaut selection process and was on the shortlist of 25 applicants in 1998.

Since Juno was not an ESA mission, Tim Peake became the first ESA British astronaut more than 20 years later.

For her Project Juno accomplishments, Sharman received a star on the Sheffield Walk of Fame.

Sharman broke several records including;
== Later career ==

Sharman spent the eight years following her mission to &quot;Mir&quot; self-employed, communicating science to the public. Her autobiography, &quot;Seize the Moment&quot;, was published in 1993. In 1997 she published a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Space Place&quot;. She has presented radio and television programmes including for BBC Schools.

By 2011, she was working at the National Physical Laboratory as Group Leader of the Surface and Nanoanalysis Group. Sharman became Operations Manager for the Department of Chemistry at Imperial College London  in 2015. She continues outreach activities related to chemistry and her spaceflight, and in 2015 was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the British Science Association.

In August 2016, Sharman appeared as herself in an episode of the Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;.

In January 2020, Sharman said in an interview that &quot;aliens exist, there are no two ways about it&quot; but that &quot;it&#x27;s possible ... we simply can&#x27;t see them&quot;, a reference to the idea of a shadow biosphere.

== Awards and honours ==

Sharman was awarded the bronze and silver and gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club, in 1990. Then, in 1991, she was chosen to light the flame at the 1991 Summer Universiade, held in Sheffield. On live international television, she tripped while running through the infield of Don Valley Stadium, sending the burning embers onto the track. Encouraged to continue her run, without any flame from the torch, she proceeded round the track and climbed to the ceremonial flame. Despite the lack of any fire from the torch the ceremonial flame still ignited.

For her determined pioneering efforts, Sharman was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1992 Birthday Honours, and the following year an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (HonFRSC). Sharman was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to Science and Technology Outreach.

On 26 May 1991, by Decree of the President of the USSR No. UP-2010, Helen was awarded the &quot;Order of Friendship of Peoples&quot;.

In 1992, she was awarded the Presidents&#x27; Medal, by SCI – an award which recognises exemplary leadership aligned with SCI’s purpose.

On 12 April 2011, by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 437, she was awarded the Medal &quot;For Merit in Space Exploration&quot;.

The British School in Assen, Netherlands is named the Helen Sharman School after her.

Additionally, Sharman has been recognised by multiple schools by having houses named in her honour. There is a house named after her at Wallington High School for Girls, a grammar school in the London Borough of Sutton, where each house is named after a high achieving and influential woman. The science block of Bullers Wood School, Chislehurst, Kent was opened by Sharman in 1994 and is called Sharman House. There is a house named after her at Great Western Academy, in Swindon, where she opened the Sixth Form. She has also been honoured at Rugby High School for Girls a girls&#x27; grammar school where houses are named after four influential women, and a Sharman house at Moorlands School, Leeds, where houses are named after inspiring people from Yorkshire. In the 2021/22 academic year, the independent girls&#x27; school Notting Hill and Ealing High School is introducing a new fourth house, which will bear Sharman&#x27;s name in recognition of her as a pioneer for women in STEM.

In addition to this, residential development in Stafford in the West Midlands of England has a street named Helen Sharman Drive after her, and a block of student flats in Sheffield bears her name. The true identity of the fictional comic-book character Steel Bolt was also named partly in homage to her.

She has received several honorary degrees from UK universities, including:

<text>The Search is a novel written and published by Nobel Prize-winning author Naguib Mahfouz in 1964. It was translated from Arabic into English in 1987 by Mohamed Islam, edited by Magdi Wahba, and published by Doubleday in 1991.

==Symbolism and comparison with other works==
The original Arabic title is الطريق which means &quot;the way&quot; or &quot;the quest&quot; and is very close to the word used by Muslim sufists [called Sufist Ways الطرق الصوفية] for the different &quot;ways&quot; or &quot;schools&quot; by which to approach God.
The name of the hero&#x27;s father in the novel &quot;Sayed Sayed Al-Rehaimi&quot; is reminiscent of an omnipotent supreme being, the name in Arabic means literally &quot;Master Master the Compassionate&quot;, his last name being very close to al-Rahim, one of the 99 names of God in the Quran. Saber&#x27;s search for him seems to be a thinly disguised search for God or Meaning. 
This theme of search for meaning or way of existence is comparable to other novels by Mahfouz, notably &quot;Children of Gebelawi&quot; (1959), &quot;The Beggar&quot; (1965), &quot;Heart of the Night&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Harafish&quot; (1977).

<doc id="873714" wikidata="Q421753" url="?curid=873714" title="2002 South Korean presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in South Korea on 19 December 2002. The result was a victory for Roh Moo-Hyun of the ruling Millennium Democratic Party, who defeated Lee Hoi-chang of the Grand National Party by just over half a million votes.

== Background ==
President Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) re-branded itself to Millennium Democratic Party (MDP) in 2000, but was struggling as it had defeated by the Grand National Party (GNP) both the 2000 parliamentary election and 2002 gubernatorial elections. GNP&#x27;s then leader and probable presidential nominee Lee Hoi-chang was polling higher than any MDP candidates.

== Primaries ==
=== Millennium Democratic Party ===
For the first time in South Korean history, the Democratic Party nominated its presidential candidate through open primaries.

At the beginning of the primaries, Rhee In-je, the 3-term congressman who ran against President Kim Dae-jung in 1997 but afterwards joined the ruling party, led the other candidates by a considerable margin in every poll. However, fringe candidate Roh Moo-hyun rose to prominence after winning the Gwangju contest, eventually winning his party&#x27;s nomination and then the presidential election.

==== Candidates ====

* Roh Moo-hyun, former Member of National Assembly from Busan
* Lee In-je, former Governor of Gyeonggi
* Chung Dong-young, Member of National Assembly from North Jeolla
* Kim Joong-kwon, former Member of National Assembly from North Gyeongsang
* Han Hwa-gap, former Member of National Assembly from South Jeolla
* Yu Jong-geun, Governor of North Jeolla
* Kim Geun-tae, Member of National Assembly from Seoul

==== Results ====
=== Grand National Party ===

==== Candidates ====

* Lee Hoi-chang, former Prime Minister
* Choi Byung-ryul, Member of the National Assembly from Seoul
* Lee Bu-young, Member of the National Assembly from Seoul
* Lee Sang-hee, former Minister of Science and Technology

==== Results ====
=== Democratic Labor Party ===
Labor activist Kwon Young-ghil of the Democratic Labor Party was nominated for president.

==Campaign==
Although corruption scandals marred the incumbent government, Lee Hoi-chang&#x27;s campaign suffered from the wave of Anti-American sentiment in Korea generated by the Yangju highway incident. Public opinion of Lee, who was widely seen as being both pro-U.S. and the preferred candidate of the George W. Bush administration in Washington, D.C., suffered. After losing to Roh by 2% in the December 2002 elections, Lee subsequently announced his retirement from politics.

=== Roh-Chung coalition ===
Chung Mong-joon, the 3-term independent congressman from Ulsan and son of Hyundai founder Chung Ju-yung, became so popular that he began appearing on polls for presidential election after he, as the president of the Korean Football Association, was credited for winning the right to host 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea.

Chung officially launched his presidential campaign in September, and in many polls beat Roh and came close to beating Lee. Many Democratic politicians that weren&#x27;t happy with Roh&#x27;s nomination joined Chung&#x27;s campaign. However, when it seemed clear that if both Roh and Chung ran, Lee would win easily. The two sides decided to combine forces, instead of competing against each other.

The two sides agreed on conducting two polls, each by different polling companies, where the winner would run as the unified candidate. The winner had to win both polls, or a second round had to occur.

So the two poll was conducted on 24 November, but only one validated. The other one was invalidated, as the two sides had agreed that any poll with Lee Hoi-chang polling less than 30.4% must be invalidated, since there could be a chance that Lee&#x27;s supporters were attempting to manipulate the results by responding with an untrue answer.

The only poll that was validated was the one conducted by the Research and Research, and it was won by Roh.

Consequently, Chung withdrew his candidacy and endorsed Roh.

However, Chung later broke his pledge on the night before the election, when he felt that Roh broke the promise to include Chung in for policy decisions and surrounded himself only with Democrats. Chung announced less than eight hours before the election that he was withdrawing his support for Roh and urged people to vote their conscience, but Roh won anyway.

==Results==

===By region===

==== Major candidates ====
Breakdown of votes by region for candidates with at least 1% of the total votes.
==== Minor candidates ====
Breakdown of votes by region for candidates with less than 1% of the total votes.

<doc id="873719" wikidata="Q207666" url="?curid=873719" title="Axel Heiberg Island">
<text>Axel Heiberg Island (, ) is an uninhabited island in the Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada. Located in the Arctic Ocean, it is the 32nd largest island in the world and Canada&#x27;s seventh largest island. According to Statistics Canada, it has an area of . It is named after Axel Heiberg.

One of the larger members of the Arctic Archipelago, it is also a member of the Sverdrup Islands and Queen Elizabeth Islands. It is known for its unusual fossil forests, which date from the Eocene period. Owing to the lack of mineralization in many of the forest specimens, the traditional characterization of &quot;fossilisation&quot; fails for these forests and &quot;mummification&quot; may be a more precise description. The fossil records provide strong evidence that the Axel Heiberg forest was a high-latitude wetland forest. A holotype of the ammonite &quot;Otoceras gracile&quot; was found in the Griesbachian (Early Triassic) deposits of this island.

==History==
Axel Heiberg Island has been inhabited in the past by the Inuit, but was uninhabited by the time it was named by Otto Sverdrup, who explored it in 1900–01. He named it after Axel Heiberg, financial director of the Norwegian Ringnes brewery which sponsored the expedition. Other explorers visited the island during the early 20th century, during which time it was claimed by Norway until 1930. It is now part of Nunavut Territory, Canada. It was not until the late 1940s that the island was aerially photographed by the United States Army Air Forces&#x27; Operation Polaris. In 1955, two geologists of the Geological Survey of Canada, N.J. McMillan and Souther, traversed the interior as part of Operation Franklin. McMillan&#x27;s observations of Bunde Glacier in northwest Axel Heiberg Island are the earliest glaciological observations on the ground to have found their way into a scientific publication.

In 1959, scientists from McGill University explored Expedition Fiord (previously Sør Fjord or South Fiord) in central Axel Heiberg Island. This resulted in the establishment of the McGill Arctic Research Station (), constructed inland from Expedition Fjord in 1960. It comprises a small research hut, a cookhouse, and two temporary structures comfortably accommodating 8–12 persons. The station was initially heavily utilized during the early 1960s, with a population of 20. The McGill Arctic Research Station is active from March to August, and research is currently focused on polar geomorphology, geology, glaciology, permafrost, climate change, and polar microbiology. Over the last 10–15 years, it has served as a significant Mars analogue for astrobiology investigations studying life and habitability of polar cryoenvironments and field-testing planetary exploration instrumentation platforms.

In the summer of 1972, a British Army Mountaineering Association expedition resulted in the naming of Scaife Glacier following the accidental death of Sergeant Kenneth Scaife.

During the summer of 1986, a Canadian expedition headed by Dr. James Basinger set out to investigate a very unusual fossil forest on Axel Heiberg. The findings of these and subsequent expeditions have since been popularly reported in Canada. Over 40 million years ago, during the Eocene epoch, a forest of tall trees flourished on Axel Heiberg Island. The trees reached up to in height; some may have grown for 500 to 1,000 years. The polar climate was warm at the time, but the winters were still continuously dark for three months. As the trees fell, the fine sediment in which the forest grew protected the plants. Instead of turning into petrified &quot;stone&quot; fossils, they were ultimately mummified by the cold, dry Arctic climate and only recently exposed to erosion. Scientists from the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg provided a few grams of Metasequoia conifer wood from the site to genetics researchers at the National University of Altai, who compared the DNA sequences of the ancient wood with DNA of modern woody plants and found them to be almost identical. Komarov Institute scientists also discovered double-strand DNA molecules in Metasequoia fossil leaves from Axel Heiberg Island.

As late as 1999, preserving this unique site was a concern, as the fossil wood was easily damaged and eroded once exposed. There were concerns that Arctic cruise ship tourists were taking wood and that the site was being disturbed by Canadian military helicopters from nearby bases and even by scientists in their studies. There were calls for more protection for the area. It has no official status, partly because land claims had to be settled. But now Nunavut is looking at how best to protect the fossil forest, possibly by setting up a territorial park to be called Napaaqtulik, &quot;where there are trees&quot;.

Interesting animal fossils have been discovered on the island, including a remarkably preserved specimen of an ancient &quot;Aurorachelys&quot; turtle and, identified in 2016, the humerus of a &quot;Tingmiatornis&quot; bird.

==Glaciation==
White Glacier is a valley glacier occupying in the Expedition Fiord area of Axel Heiberg Island (). It extends in elevation from above sea level, a range which, as noted by Dyurgerov (2002), is exceeded only by Devon Ice Cap in the world list of glaciers with measured mass balance. Ice thickness reaches or exceeds . Its maximum extension in recent history, marking the glacier&#x27;s advance in response to the cooling of the Little Ice Age, was reached not earlier than the late 18th century and probably at the beginning of the 20th century. There is evidence that the retreat of the terminus, previously at about per year, is decelerating (Cogley et al. 1996a; Cogley and Adams 2000). White Glacier has been the subject of many papers in the glaciological literature since 1960, e.g. Müller (1962) was the source of a now-classical diagram elaborating and illustrating the concept of &quot;glacier facies&quot;.

==Population==
The island is uninhabited except for the seasonal McGill Arctic Research Station operated by McGill University.

==Lost Hammer Spring==
The Lost Hammer Spring, located in the central west region of the island () is the coldest and saltiest of all Arctic springs described to date. It is characterized by a perennial hypersaline (24%) discharge at subzero temperatures (~) flowing to the surface through a hollow, high cone-shaped salt tufa structure. Continuous gas emissions from the spring indicate an underlying thermogenic methane source. Based on these properties, this spring is considered a significant astrobiology analogue site for possible habitats currently present on Mars and the cold moons Europa and Enceladus.

Microbes have been found at this site that do not depend on organic material or oxygen but only on simple inorganic compounds. These inorganic compounds are present on Mars.

<text>The Presidio of Monterey (POM), located in Monterey, California, is an active US Army installation with historic ties to the Spanish colonial era. Currently, it is the home of the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLI-FLC). It is the last and only presidio in California to have an active military installation.

==History==

The Spanish explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno visited, named and charted Monterey Bay (especially the southern end) in 1602. In his official report, Vizcaíno recommended the natural harbor he found as an appropriate site for a seaport, military fortification and colonization. It would be over 150 years, until news of Pacific Coast moves by Spain&#x27;s European rivals brought the remote area back to the attention of the leaders of New Spain.

===José de Gálvez&#x27;s grand plan===
In 1768, José de Gálvez, special deputy (&quot;visitador&quot;) of King Carlos III in New Spain (Mexico), received this order: &quot;Occupy and fortify San Diego and Monterey for God and the King of Spain.&quot; Gálvez organized a series of land and sea expeditions from the port of San Blas, today in the state of Nayarit, México, to establish a military post and Catholic mission in Monterey. Spain&#x27;s rulers had long feared that other European powers would encroach from the north on American territories Spain claimed along the Pacific coast. Gálvez himself spread rumors of schemes by the British and Dutch rulers to add California to their own empires. Then, when a report arrived from the Spanish ambassador in Russia that Catherine the Great planned to establish settlements down the California coast towards Monterey, Gálvez—already planning a northward expansion of New Spain&#x27;s dominion—trumpeted the threat from Russia. King Carlos gave Gálvez the go-ahead. Spain moved to occupy regions along the Pacific coast of North America that its sailors and soldiers had only seen and claimed from previous maritime explorations.

===Portolá expeditions to Monterey===
From March through June 1769, Gaspar de Portolá, appointed &quot;governor of the Californias&quot; (Baja and Alta California), led an overland party—joined by Franciscan friar Junípero Serra—from Loreto to San Diego. Then in July, Portolá mustered a new party—including lieutenant Pedro Fages, cartographer Miguel Costansó, and friars Juan Crespí and Francisco Gómez—to trek north from San Diego to rediscover the port of Monterey by land. They reached Monterey Bay on 1 October, but failed to recognize it as the port described by Vizcaíno 167 years earlier—and continued north, eventually reaching San Francisco Bay. On their return trek to San Diego, they planted two large crosses on the coast of Monterey, whose geographical identity they could not yet confirm. (see Timeline of the Portolá expedition).

In April 1770, Portolá gathered a new and smaller party for another overland journey from San Diego to Monterey. This party included Pedro Fages with twelve Catalan volunteers, seven leather-jacket soldiers, two muleteers, five Christian Indians from Baja California, and friar Juan Crespí. They arrived at Monterey Bay on 24 May. That afternoon, Portolá and Crespí revisited the large wooden cross their party had planted five months earlier on a hill just south of Point Pinos near the northern tip of the Monterey peninsula. &quot;This is the port of Monterey without the slightest doubt,&quot; wrote Crespí in his diary.

===Strict discipline to build Spanish presidio===
Miguel Costansó selected the site of the presidio and drew the first plans and maps. Pedro Fages, left in command of the Monterey soldiers after Portolá sailed back to Mexico, imposed strict discipline on his soldiers to construct the presidio. He set the work they had to do in a certain time, harshly punishing soldiers caught resting or rolling a cigarette. Heavy rains punctuated the spring and winter of 1770–1771, but Fages permitted no let-up in the work. His soldiers had to trudge through mud to the forest to chop wood, then drag their mules out of the mud and head home. They had no chance to wash or mend their clothes during the six-day work week; Fages told them to do that on Sundays. This work regime lasted a year and a half, until complaints by the soldiers persuaded padre president Junípero Serra to intervene: Serra told Fages that, as a Christian, he had to observe the sabbath and let men rest on Sundays. In late June 1771, Fages wrote to viceroy Carlos de Croix in Mexico to inform him that the Monterey presidio had been built, sending along a simplified map.

===Spanish Fort===
While Fages established El Presidio Real de San Carlos de Monterrey (the Royal Presidio of Saint Charles of Monterey), Junípero Serra founded Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo, with the original location occupying the present day (remaining) chapel Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo.

Monterey became one of a series of &quot;presidios&quot;, or &quot;royal forts,&quot; built by Spain in what is now the western United States. In 1792, the El Castillo de Monterey was established to protect the port and persido of Monterey. Other California-based installations were founded in San Diego (El Presidio Real de San Diego) in 1769, in San Francisco (El Presidio Real de San Francisco ) in 1776, and in Santa Barbara (El Presidio Real de Santa Bárbara) in 1782.

On 20 November 1818, Argentine privateer Hipólito Bouchard, known thereafter as &quot;California&#x27;s only pirate&quot;, raided the El Castillo de Monterey defended by José Bandini. Its population took refuge in the Presidio&#x27;s Rancho del Rey San Pedro (King&#x27;s Farm), in the vicinity of Salinas. The fortunes of the Presidio at Monterey rose and fell with the times: it has been moved, abandoned and reactivated time and time again. The only surviving building from the original compound is the Royal Presidio Chapel. At least three times, it has been submerged by the tide of history, only to appear years later with a new face, a new master, and a new mission – first under the Spanish, then the Mexicans, and ultimately the Americans.

===United States fort===

United States control of the area began in 1846 during the Mexican–American War when Commodore John D. Sloat, commander of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Pacific Squadron, landed unopposed a small force in Monterey and claimed the territory and the Presidio for the United States. He left a small garrison of Marines who moved the fort up to its current location on the hill overlooking the harbor, combining in one location the previously separated functions of military headquarters and fortress. The Presidio was renamed Fort Mervine in honor of Captain William Mervine, who commanded one of the ships in Sloat&#x27;s squadron.

The original Presidio comprised a square of adobe buildings located in the vicinity of what is now downtown Monterey. The fort&#x27;s original mission, the Royal Presidio Chapel, has remained in constant use since its founding in 1770 by Junípero Serra, who arrived with Portola&#x27;s party. On a hill overlooking the Monterey harbor is an earthwork—the only lingering connection between the original and present sites of the Presidio. That earthwork was part of the Spanish-built artillery battery defending the harbor.

The 1846 US occupation of Monterey put an end to any Mexican military presence at the Presidio. In 1865, in the closing months of the American Civil War, the fort was returned to temporary life by the arrival of six officers and 156 enlisted men, but was abandoned again in 1866.

In 1902, an infantry regiment arrived at Monterey with the mission to construct a post to house an infantry regiment and a squadron of cavalry. Troops moved into the new wooden barracks, officially named Ord Barracks, in June 1903. It was named for former American Civil War general, Edward Ord. However, in order to perpetuate the name of the old Spanish military installation that Portolà had established 134 years earlier, the War Department redesignated the post as the Presidio of Monterey. The barracks and training facilities for enlisted men, along with General Ord&#x27;s name, were moved a short way up the coast to Fort Ord in 1940.

===Presidio of Monterey===

A school of musketry was located at the Presidio from 1907 to 1913, and a school for cooks and bakers from 1914 to 1917. In 1917, the Army purchased an additional 15,809 acres (64 km2) across the bay as a maneuver area. This new acquisition eventually was designated as Camp Ord in 1939 and became Fort Ord in 1940.

Between 1919 and 1940, the Presidio housed principally cavalry and field artillery units. However, the outbreak of World War II ended the days of horse cavalry, and those troops left Monterey. The Presidio, subsequently, served as reception center and temporary headquarters of the III Corps until it was deactivated in late 1944.

===Civil Affairs Staging Area===

The Presidio of Monterey was reactivated, under considerable difficulty, in January 1945 to accommodate the Civil Affairs Staging Area (CASA). The Civil Affairs Staging Area was a brigade sized Army / Navy formation created by a joint chiefs of staff directive for military government theater planning, training and provision of military government personnel to liberated areas of the Far East. CASA provided comprehensive training and planning in civil affairs administration to officers coming from six schools of military government established at various universities throughout the country.

===Defense Language Institute===
In 1946, the Military Intelligence Service Language School (MISLS) was moved to the Presidio of Monterey and was renamed the Army Language School (ALS). In June 1963, the Army Language School was renamed the Defense Language Institute (DLI). In 1976, the Defense Language Institute became the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLI-FLC), the Defense Department&#x27;s primary center for foreign language instruction. The center constitutes the principal activity at the Presidio. The Presidio serves all branches of the Department of Defense as well as other select government agencies.

===Closure of Fort Ord===
From 1946 onward, the Presidio itself was a sub-installation of the nearby Fort Ord. On 1 October 1994, this situation changed when Fort Ord closed and the Presidio of Monterey became a separate installation again, with the continued military areas of Fort Ord becoming known as the Presidio Annex.

<doc id="873731" wikidata="Q285944" url="?curid=873731" title="Toyohiro Akiyama">
<text>is a retired Japanese TV journalist and professor at Kyoto University of Art and Design. In December 1990, he spent seven days aboard the Mir space station. He became the first person of Japanese nationality to fly in space, and his space mission was the second spaceflight to be commercially sponsored and funded. Akiyama was also the first civilian to fly aboard a commercial space flight and the first journalist to report from outer space.

==Education and career==

Akiyama attended and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree at the International Christian University located in Mitaka, Tokyo. He then joined the Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) as a journalist in 1966. He worked for the BBC World Service from 1967–1971 before becoming a correspondent for the TBS Division of Foreign News. From 1984 to 1988, he served as TBS chief correspondent in Washington D.C.

==Space training==
On 17 August 1989, Akiyama was selected for a commercial Soviet-Japanese flight. The flight was sponsored by the TBS Corporation to celebrate its fortieth anniversary. The amount that the corporation paid for the flight of its employee differs significantly from one source to another (US$28 million, US$25 million, 5 billion yen or US$37 million). Akiyama started training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in October 1989.

==Spaceflight==
TBS wanted to send the first Japanese person to space in order to boost their TV ratings. 163 TBS employees applied for the opportunity to fly to space. Eventually, Akiyama and camerawoman Ryoko Kikuchi were selected as the two final candidates. When Kikuchi developed a case of appendicitis a week before launch, Akiyama was selected for cosmonaut training and he was the primary crew member, with no backup in place. Akiyama began cosmonaut training in August 1989 in a deal between TBS and the Soviet Union. The commercialization of space flight was evident by the Soyuz TM-11 covered with advertising of TBS and other Japanese companies.

Akiyama&#x27;s mission marked the first flight of a person of Japanese nationality in space as well as the first commercially sponsored and funded spaceflight of an individual in history. Akiyama also became the first journalist to give live reports from space. After successfully completing a &quot;Research Cosmonaut&quot; training course at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in present-day Russia, Akiyama launched aboard the Soyuz TM-11 mission to the Mir space station on 2 December 1990 along with mission commander Viktor Afanasyev and flight engineer Musa Manarov. 

Akiyama was not a trained astronaut, scientist nor engineer. During his time aboard Mir, Akiyama gave live reports each day documenting life aboard the station, but his apparent discomfort led to him being described as the first &quot;antihero in space&quot;. He described his struggles such as space sickness and craving for cigarettes: During training, he quit smoking cigarettes, having previously smoked four packs a day. Before liftoff, when asked what he looked forward to most upon his return to Earth, he said &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to have a smoke&quot;. His fellow cosmonauts later reported, in regards to his nausea, that they &quot;hadn&#x27;t ever seen a man vomit that much.&quot;

Initially, the TBS TV viewership was high, but by midweek, it declined to slightly above normal. Various reports have cited a flight cost paid by TBS as between and . The company reportedly lost on the deal. Akiyama eventually returned to Earth just over a week later aboard Soyuz TM-10 along with Gennadi Manakov and Gennadi Strekalov on 10 December. While onboard the space station, Akiyama made nightly live broadcasts.

== Later career ==
Akiyama returned to TBS after completing his spaceflight and became deputy director of the TBS News Division. He retired from TBS in 1995, because he disagreed with the active commercialization of television.

In April 1991, he shot a film, with a group of Japanese journalists, about the state of the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan.

From January 1996, he engaged in organic farming with rice and mushrooms in the Abukuma mountains in the town Takine, near Tamura, Fukushima, Fukushima Prefecture. He also wrote books and gave lectures focusing on environmental issues. In March 2011, he was personally affected by the Fukushima disaster and was forced to abandon his farm.

On 1 November 2011, he became a professor of agriculture at the Faculty of Arts, Kyoto University of Art and Design.

==Personal life==
Akiyama was married to Kyoko Akiyama, and the couple had a son and a daughter. He left his family in Tokyo to go farm. They divorced in 1995.

== Awards and decorations ==
Akiyama received multiple awards and decorations, including:

* 1990 – Order of Friendship of Peoples (10 December 1990, Soviet Union), &quot;for the successful implementation of space flight on the orbital research complex Mir&quot;
* 1991 – Tokyo Metropolitan Cultural Honor award
* 2000 – Japanese Society for Biological Sciences in Space Achievement Award
* 2011 – Medal &quot;For Merit in Space Exploration&quot; (12 April 2011, Russia), &quot;for a great contribution to the development of international cooperation in the field of manned space exploration&quot;

==Publications==
He made reports in Japanese, which were published later, dedicated to his space flight. He also co-authored articles on the development of space tourism and farming.

<text>Hermann Friedrich Albert von Ihering (9 October 1850 – 24 February 1930) was a German-Brazilian zoologist. He was the oldest son of Rudolf von Jhering.

==Biography==

Hermann Friedrich Albert von Ihering was born in 1850 in Kiel, Germany, the oldest son of Rudolf von Jhering.

Under the advice of Rudolf Leuckart, Ihering studied medicine at the Giessen, Leipzig, Berlin, and Göttingen universities, working as an assistant at the zoological institute in Göttingen. He concluded his doctoral thesis in Göttingen, with the title &quot;Ueber das Wesen der Prognathie und ihr Verlhaeltniss zur Schaedelbasis&quot; (On the essence of prognathism and its effect on the base of the skull). He later worked as a Privatdozent for zoology at the Erlangen and Leipzig.

On 26 April 1880, Ihering married a widow, Anna Maria Clara Wolff (born von Bezel), who had a 10-year-old boy, Sebastian Wolff, from her first marriage. The marriage was not approved by Ihering&#x27;s family and, as a result, he travelled to Brazil soon after. He got his first work at the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, in Rio de Janeiro. However, as he found the climate of Rio de Janeiro too hot, he eventually moved to the city of Taquara, Rio Grande do Sul, where he started to collect specimens to send to museums in Germany and to the British Museum. At this time he had two children, Clara and Rodolpho. Later, he had two more, Wilhelm and Ida, but the latter died as a child.

In 1883, Ihering was nominated travelling naturalist of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro and lived in several cities by the Lagoa dos Patos. He eventually bought an island at the delta of the Camaquã River, which started to be called &quot;Ilha do Doutor&quot; (Doctor&#x27;s Island) and lived there for some years. He was naturalized Brazilian in 1885.

Between 1893 and 1894, Ihering helped to found the Museu Paulista, in São Paulo, and became its first director.

In 1901, his son Rodolpho was sent to Europe to study in Heidelberg. However, his other son, Wilhelm, died soon after, being only 16 years old, and his wife Anna became too shaken by the event and died later in the same year. Rodolpho then abandoned his studies and returned to Brazil to help his father.

During a trip to Europe to visit some colleagues in 1907, Ihering met again his first love, Meta Buff, from Gießen, and married her that same year. Later, during World War I, he was accused of nepotism and of selling to the state a stone that was donated to the Museu Paulista. This forced him to leave his job as director of the museum in 1916. He returned to southern Brazil and continued his studies in Santa Catarina, and in 1918 he was invited to occupy the chair of zoology at the University of Córdoba, Argentina. However, he refused the offer and remained in Brazil in order to organize a small museum in Florianópolis. One year after the museum opened, the government reduced his wage to one third, and three months later it was announced that he would not be paid anymore for his job.

In 1920, Ihering returned to Europe, living first in Naples and later returning to Germany. In 1921, he settled with Meta in Büdingen. Meta died in 1928 and Ihering died in 1930, at Gießen, Germany.

==Homage ==
Several species were named in honor of Ihering, including the following. 
*&quot;Anisolepis iheringii&quot; (lizard), type species of the genus &quot;Anisolepis&quot; , but a junior synonym of &quot;Anisolepis undulatus&quot; 
*&quot;Brucepattersonius iheringi&quot; (rodent)
*&quot;Bryconamericus iheringii&quot; (fish)
*&quot;Choeradoplana iheringi&quot; (land planarian)
*&quot;Enyalius iheringii&quot; (lizard)
*&quot;Gastrocopta iheringi&quot; (gastropod)
*&quot;Grammostola iheringi&quot; (tarantula)
*&quot;Hypostomus hermanni&quot; (catfish, named by his son)
*&quot;Myrmotherula iheringi&quot; (antbird)
*&quot;Phyllomedusa iheringii&quot; (frog)
*&quot;Phalloptychus iheringii&quot; (fish), junior synonym for &quot;Phalloptychus januarius&quot; 
*&quot;Trinomys iheringi&quot; (Ihering&#x27;s Atlantic spiny rat)
*&quot;Unio iheringi&quot; (freshwater mussel)
*&quot;Unionicola iheringi&quot; (water mite)

The peer-reviewed scientific journal &quot;Iheringia&quot; was also named after him.

==Bibliography==
His bibliography include 310 works; 20 of these works are about birds.

He was the author of &quot;Catálogos da Fauna Brasileira&quot; (1907) with his son Rodolpho von Ihering.

<text>Fluxys is a Belgium-based company, mainly acting as a natural gas transmission system operator. In 2004, it employed around 850 people and its infrastructure comprised about of pipelines and a terminal in Zeebrugge, Belgium. The company is listed on Euronext Brussels market.

== History ==
The company was created in 2001 from the breakup of Distrigas into two entities (the other entity has kept the name Distrigas). Suez held as much as 57.25% of Fluxys shares prior to its 2008 merger with Gaz de France to form GDF Suez (now Engie), but was obligated to reduce its stake to satisfy the concerns of the European Commissioner for Competition. Engie still retains 44.75% of Fluxys as of July 2008.

As of 7 April 2014, when ice precludes the LNG shipments from Yamal LNG at Sabetta along the Northern Sea Route, the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge will serve Russia as its LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region.

Ukrainian National Agency on Corruption Prevention included Fluxys in the list of International Sponsors of War in November 2023 because the company was promoting the export of Russian LNG using the Fluxys terminal facilities.
