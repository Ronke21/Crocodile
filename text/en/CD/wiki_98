<text>Hurricane Iniki ( ; Hawaiian: &quot;iniki&quot; meaning &quot;strong and piercing wind&quot;) was a hurricane that struck the island of Kauai on September 11, 1992. It was the most powerful hurricane to strike Hawaii in recorded history, and the only hurricane to directly affect the state during the 1992 Pacific hurricane season. Forming on September 5, 1992, it was the first hurricane to hit the state since Hurricane Iwa in the 1982 season, and the only known major hurricane to hit the state. Iniki dissipated on September 13, about halfway between Hawaii and Alaska.

Iniki caused around $3.1 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in damage and seven deaths. This made Iniki, at the time, the costliest natural disaster on record in the state, as well as the third-costliest to hit the U.S. It struck just 18 days after Hurricane Andrew, the costliest tropical cyclone ever at the time, struck Florida.

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches 24 hours in advance. The hurricane destroyed more than 1,400 houses on Kauai and severely damaged more than 5,000. Though not directly in the path of the eye, Oahu experienced moderate damage from wind and storm surge.

== Meteorological history ==

The origin of Iniki is unclear, but it may have begun as a tropical wave that exited the west African coast on August 18. It moved westward across northern South America and Central America, entering the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 28. On September 5, Tropical Depression Eighteen-E developed from the wave, about southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, or east-southeast of Hilo. Upon its formation, the depression had a ragged area of convection, and the National Hurricane Center anticipated minimal strengthening over the subsequent few days. This was due to the convective structure having poorly-defined outflow, or ventilation. Warm sea surface temperatures, 2–5° F (1–3° C) above normal, were considered a positive factor. On September 6, the depression crossed 140° W, entering the area of warning responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). On that day, the CPHC anticipated that the depression would dissipate within 24 hours, and ceased issuing advisories, but the depression reorganized on the next day, and warnings were reissued. Steered by a subtropical ridge to the north, the depression continued westward, or slightly south of due west. On September 8, the CPHC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, giving it the name &quot;Iniki&quot;, which is Hawaiian for a sharp and piercing wind.

Iniki gradually intensified as its track shifted to the north. It moved around the western edge of the subtropical ridge, which was weakening due to an upper-level trough moving eastward from the International Date Line. Typically, the subtropical ridge keeps storms away from the Hawaiian islands. On September 9, Iniki strengthened into a hurricane, and the next day it passed about south of Ka Lae, the southernmost point of the Big Island of Hawaii. The hurricane slowed and curved toward the north while continuing to intensify. On September 10, a reconnaissance aircraft flew into Iniki, observing sustained winds of , which is a major hurricane, or a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The approaching trough caused Iniki to accelerate to the north-northeast toward the western Hawaiian islands.

On September 11, a reconnaissance aircraft observed maximum sustained winds of , with gusts to , making it a Category 4 hurricane. The flight also observed a minimum barometric pressure of , the lowest ever observed in the Central Pacific at the time. At that time, the hurricane was about southwest of Lihue. Iniki weakened slightly after its peak, and its eye made landfall on the southern coast of Kauai near Waimea with winds of , making it the strongest hurricane on record to strike Hawaii. Iniki moved rapidly across the island, and about 40 minutes after landfall, it reemerged into the Pacific Ocean as it accelerated away from the state. The hurricane thereafter weakened, dropping to tropical storm status by September 13. That day, Iniki transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it integrated with an approaching cold front about halfway between Hawaii and Alaska.

==Preparations==
While Iniki was in its development stages, various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a range of possibilities for the hurricane&#x27;s future trajectory, ranging from a landfall on the Big Island to a path to the west, away from the state. The hurricane initially followed a trajectory similar to other storms in the region, passing south of the state. The CPHC relied on the Miami-based National Hurricane Center for the models, and lacked a detailed analysis on each model run, which caused errors in forecasting. The agency also had limited satellite imagery and direct observations to track the hurricane. As such, the CPHC failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance, although the agency warned for the potential of high surf. For several days before the disaster, the CPHC and the news media forecast Iniki to remain well south of the island chain.

Two days before the storm struck, the Naval Western Oceanography Center on Oahu recommended that the United States Navy fleet at the Pearl Harbor Shipyard to start storm preparations. A few Naval facilities were evacuated, some ahead of official hurricane warnings from the CPHC. Early on September 11, less than 24 hours before Iniki made landfall, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for Kauai, Niihau, and the northwestern Hawaiian islands to the French Frigate Shoals. A few hours later, the agency upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for Kauai and Niihau. A hurricane warning was later issued for Oahu, while a tropical storm watch was issued for the islands of Maui County. Warning sirens blared on Kauai and Oʻahu to warn the public of the approaching storm. The hurricane warning for Kauai was downgraded to a tropical storm warning after Iniki departed the island, causing some confusion whether there was another storm approaching the area. Reports about the storm were disseminated by radio, newspapers, and news stations. After the hurricane warnings were issued, TV stations began 24-hour coverage of the storm. Residents responded well to the hurricane, in part due to the scenes of destruction from Hurricane Andrew in south Florida three weeks earlier. Iniki nearly struck the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. Had it hit there, Iniki, along with Hurricane Andrew and Typhoon Omar, would have struck each of the three National Weather Service offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two-month period.

In response to the approaching hurricane, about 38,000 people evacuated to public shelters, including 8,000 on Kauai and 30,000 people in Oahu. On Kauai, school was canceled, and the traffic was light during the evacuation, with streets clear by mid-morning. Rather than send tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during Iniki&#x27;s passage of Kauai. Some residents rode out the hurricane in their homes. According to a post-storm survey, no one on the island did not hear about the impending storm. On Oʻahu, all schools, and most businesses, closed during the storm&#x27;s passage. Only critical government employees worked during the storm. Officials opened 110 public shelters on Oʻahu, including some schools meant for refuge only; this meant they provided no food, cots, blankets, medications, or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu&#x27;s population participated in the evacuation, though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter. Officials assessed that the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police occupied certain overused intersections. The two main problems during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines. On the Big Island, officials ordered residents within of the coastline to evacuate to higher ground.

==Impact==

Hurricane Iniki was the costliest hurricane ever to strike Hawaii, causing $3.1 billion in damage. That made it the third-costliest U.S. hurricane at the time, behind Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, one month earlier. It was the first significant hurricane to threaten the state since Hurricane Iwa ten years earlier. Iniki affected all of Hawaii with high waves and strong winds, with the worst impacts on Kauai. Seven people died during the hurricane – three on Kauai, two offshore, and two on Oahu. The low death toll was likely due to well-executed warnings and preparation. Of the offshore deaths, two were Japanese nationals who died when their boat capsized south of Kauai. There were also around 100 storm-related injuries throughout the state, some of which occurred during the hurricane&#x27;s aftermath.

=== Kauai ===
Hurricane Iniki made landfall on south-central Kauai and moved across the island in 40 minutes. Much of the island experienced sustained winds of . Wind gusts were estimated at at landfall. There was an uncalibrated wind gust of at Makaha Ridge, at the top of a cliff. A station at Makahuena Point recorded a gust of . Based on the island&#x27;s damage patterns, meteorologist Ted Fujita estimated there were as many as 26 microbursts, sudden downdrafts of wind capable of reaching . There were also two mini-swirls, small localized swirls within the eyewall. In general, the winds descending the island&#x27;s mountains were more damaging than the upslope winds. In addition to its strong winds, Iniki lashed the southern Kauai coastline with a storm surge, or rise in water. On top of the surge, the hurricane produced wave heights of , with a high water mark of at Waikomo Stream near Koloa. The high waves left a debris line more than inland. Because it moved quickly through the island, there were no reports of significant rainfall.

Iniki&#x27;s passage left extensive damage throughout Kauai, with 14,350 homes damaged to some degree. Only the western part of the island was not severely damaged. Three people died on the island – one due to flying debris, one to a collapsed house, and one of a heart attack. Across Kauai, Iniki destroyed 1,421 houses, including 63 that were lost from the high waves and water. It also severely damaged 5,152 homes, while 7,178 received minor damage, which left more than 7,000 people homeless. High waters damaged several hotels and condominiums along the island&#x27;s southern shore. A few were restored quickly, but some took several years to be rebuilt. One hotel—the Coco Palms Resort famous for Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;—never reopened. Hurricane Iniki&#x27;s making landfall during daylight hours, combined with the popularity of camcorders, led many Kauai residents to record much of the damage as it occurred. The footage was later used to create an hour-long video documentary. Commercial air service was suspended.

Iniki&#x27;s high winds also downed 26.5% of the island&#x27;s transmission poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service for an extended period. Electric companies restored only 20% of the island&#x27;s power service within four weeks of Iniki, while other areas had no power for three to four months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Much of the sugar cane was already harvested, but what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees. The high winds stripped much of Kauai of its vegetation, wrecking sugar cane fields as well as fruit and nut trees.

Among those on Kauai was filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who was preparing for the final day of on-location shooting of the film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. He and the 130 of his cast and crew remained safely in a hotel during Iniki&#x27;s passage. According to Spielberg, &quot;every single structure was in shambles; roofs and walls were torn away; telephone poles and trees were down as far as the eye could see.&quot; Spielberg included footage of Iniki battering the Kaua&#x27;i coastal walls as part of the completed film, where a tropical storm is a pivotal part of the plot. Members of the film&#x27;s crew helped to clear some of the debris off of nearby roads.

=== Elsewhere ===
East of the hurricane&#x27;s landfall, Oahu received tropical storm-force winds during Iniki&#x27;s passage along its southwestern coast, with an island-wide peak gust of in Waianae. The outer rainbands of the hurricane spawned an F1 tornado in Nānākuli, also on Oahu. Along western Oahu, Iniki produced a surge, with waves recorded near Mākaha. Prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of Oahu, with the areas most affected being Barbers Point through Kaena. The Waianae coastline experienced the most damage, with waves and storm surge flooding the second floor of beachside apartments. In all, Hurricane Iniki caused several million dollars in property damage, and two deaths on Oahu.

High swells affected the southwestern coasts of Maui and the Big Island, which damaged boats, harbors, and coastal structures. On the Big Island, seas of were reported, along with winds. The high waves damaged 12 homes on the Big Island. In Honokōhau Harbor, three or four sailboats were tossed onto the rocks and one trimaran at another harbor was sunk. A beach near Napoʻopoʻo on Kealakekua Bay lost some sand and to this day has never been the same.

==Aftermath==
Immediately after the storm, many were relieved to have survived the worst of the hurricane; their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information, as every radio station was out and no news was available for several days. Because Iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island, communities held parties to consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers, and many hotels prepared and hosted free meals to use up their perishables. Though some food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed, many Kauai citizens insisted on paying. In addition, entertainers from all of Hawaii, including Graham Nash (who owns a home on the north shore of Kauaʻi) and the Honolulu Symphony, gave free concerts for the victims.

Three days after Iniki struck Hawaii, the NOAA Assistant Administrator for Weather Services directed that a disaster survey team investigate the warnings and responsiveness to the hurricane. The passages of Iwa and Iniki within a ten-year period increased public awareness of hurricanes in Hawaii.

Looting occurred in Iniki&#x27;s aftermath, but it was very minor. A group from the Army Corps of Engineers, who experienced the looting during Hurricane Andrew just weeks before, were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island. Electrical power was restored to most of the island about six weeks after the hurricane, but students returned to Kauai public schools two weeks after the disaster. Kauai citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies, but after six months they felt annoyed by the lack of help. But the military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs, including MREs (meals ready to eat), and help arrived before local officials requested aid.

By four weeks after the hurricane, only 20% of power was restored on Kauai, following the island-wide blackout. Amateur radio proved extremely helpful during the three weeks after the storm, with volunteers coming from neighboring islands as well as from around the Pacific to assist in the recovery. There was support of local government communications in Lihue in the first week of recovery as well as a hastily organized effort by local operators to assist with the American Red Cross and their efforts to provide shelters and disaster relief centers across Kauaʻi.

In the months after the storm, many insurance companies left Hawaii. To combat this, Governor John D. Waihee III enacted the Hurricane Relief Fund in 1993 to help unprotected Hawaii residents. The fund was never needed for another Hawaii hurricane, and it was eliminated in 2000, when insurance companies returned to the island.

Iniki ravaged multiple islands&#x27; native forest bird population. It is also thought that the storm blew apart many chicken coops, some possibly used to house fighting chickens; this caused a dramatic increase in feral chickens roaming Kauai.

Due to the storm&#x27;s impact, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Iniki&quot; after the 1992 season; it will never again be used for a Central Pacific tropical cyclone. It was replaced in the basin&#x27;s naming rotation with &quot;Iolana&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The events and survivor accounts of the hurricane were featured in an episode of The Weather Channel docuseries &quot;Storm Stories&quot;, &quot;Iniki Jurassic&quot;, the sixth episode of the GRB Entertainment docuseries &quot;Earth&#x27;s Fury&quot; (also known as &quot;Anatomy of Disaster&quot; outside the U.S.), &quot;Hurricane Force&quot;, the fourth episode of the 2008 Discovery Channel reality television series &quot;Destroyed in Seconds&quot;, the 1996 Fox television special &quot;When Disasters Strike&quot;, and the 11th episode of the 1999 reality television series &quot;World&#x27;s Most Amazing Videos&quot;.

<doc id="903008" wikidata="Q1145537" url="?curid=903008" title="Curtis Brown (ice hockey)">
<text>Curtis Dean Brown (born February 12, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in the second round (43rd overall) of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. Over his National Hockey League (NHL) career, he played for the Sabres, San Jose Sharks, and Chicago Blackhawks.

Brown served as a Sharks pregame and postgame analyst on NBC Sports California until 2023 when he moved to Nebraska to accept a position with the Lincoln Stars. As of 2024, Brown is the head coach and general manager of the Lincoln Stars AAA team.

==Playing career==
Brown was drafted in the second round of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres. After finishing the 1994–95 WHL season with the Moose Jaw Warriors, he debuted with the Sabres on May 3, 1995 against the New Jersey Devils and scored a goal and an assist.

Brown returned to the WHL for 1995–96 and was traded from Moose Jaw to the Prince Albert Raiders before finishing out the season with Buffalo.

By 1997–98, Brown became a full-time player for the Sabres, usually on the third line.

In March 2004, Brown was traded to the San Jose Sharks in a three-way trade that saw Buffalo acquire Jeff Jillson from Boston while they received Brad Boyes and Andy Delmore. Brown played only 12 games for San Jose, however, and spent the 2004 NHL lockout season in the ECHL with the San Diego Gulls.

On July 2, 2004, Brown signed a four-year deal with the Chicago Blackhawks, only to be bought out after only one NHL season. Brown was the first player ever to have his contract bought out. 

Brown signed with San Jose as an unrestricted free agent in July 2006. The two-year deal was worth just $1.4 million, with Brown stating that he signed for such a relatively low salary because he had already received money from Chicago&#x27;s buy-out.

On July 17, 2008, Brown completed his NHL career and signed with the Kloten Flyers of the Swiss Nationalliga A where he played for one season. He then switched to defense and played the final two seasons of his career with EHC Biel before retiring.

==Personal life==
Brown, of Christian faith, has a wife, Ami. The couple had a daughter, Aubri who died in late 2005 of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The death of their daughter inspired them to create The Aubri Brown Foundation, a foundation that helps parents going through the loss of their children. They have three sons, Gage, Garrett, and Griffin.

<doc id="903012" wikidata="Q1307642" url="?curid=903012" title="Wall and crown knot">
<text>A wall and crown knot is a decorative kind of rope button. The original use of the knot was to put at the end of the ropes on either side of a gangway leading onto a ship as stoppers.

A wall and crown knot consists of a wall knot and a crown knot with doubled strands. The strands of the wall knot go over, under twice, and over, while the strands of the crown knot go under, over twice, and under. In the wall and crown knot they are tied in opposite directions.

This knot is often confused with a Turk&#x27;s head knot, as both knots have a basket weave pattern.

A Manrope knot(Double wall and crown, #847) is same knot as wall and crown knot but with little changes - crown strands doubled or tripled. in Verrill&#x27;s book it is made from three-strand and crown strands doubled, in Ashley&#x27;s book it is made from four-strand and crown strands tripled.


A crown knot is the simplest of the fancy knots. It is created from three strands.
A crown is recommended for finishing off an eye seizing

A wall knot is essentially a crown knot but reversed

<doc id="903026" wikidata="Q4716232" url="?curid=903026" title="Alert dialog box">
<text>An alert dialog box is a special dialog box that is displayed in a graphical user interface when something unexpected occurred that requires immediate user action.

The typical alert dialog provides information in a separate box to the user, after which the user can only respond in one way: by closing it. Closing an alert dialog will provide access to the original window, which is not available while the alert dialog is presented.

Alert dialogs that block the application are regarded as a bad design solution by usability practitioners, since they are prone to produce mode errors. Also when used as error dialogs, they have been shown to be ineffective in their goals to inform users about an error condition or protect from a destructive operation.

== Usage ==

Alerts have several typical uses:

* Error: informs the user than an operation could not continue or complete due to some insurmountable error.
* Warning: alerts that the current course of action could be in some way dangerous or detrimental, often offering the option of not proceeding.
* Info: presents a general notification about a recent event.
* Question: elicits some kind of response from the user, required to complete the current process.
&quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;question&quot; alerts typically offer two opposite options to close the dialog (&quot;Allow/Deny&quot;, &quot;OK/Cancel&quot;, &quot;Yes/No&quot;) with the implicit assumption that one will proceed with the paused process that triggered the dialog, and the other one will interrupt the process without action. A good practice in interface design, often included in human interface guidelines, is to label each option with the precise effect that it will have on the process (for example, &quot;Save/Don&#x27;t save&quot; in a dialog triggered while editing a document with unsaved changes).

The primary reason for using an alert dialogue instead of communicating via the main program window is modality. A typical online form is non-modal. They present to a user many actions that can be performed in any sequence. By contrast an alert dialogue creates a modal state that isolates a particular element of the form and requires a user to address it before proceeding to the next step.

The utility of the alert dialogue is increasing with mobile device penetration, because:
* modal alerts are part of the native functionality of a mobile device, so can be deployed consistently across the device ecosystem as opposed to visual styling techniques that are prone to cross-platform inconsistency
* smaller viewports (screens) make it more difficult to review the main program window looking for errors/information
* smaller viewports have acclimatized users to interacting with a sequence of small screens each with a define action, rather than viewing all contextual info at once on a big screen

==Example==

codice_1 is the name of the method used in JavaScript to spawn an alert dialog. The argument to the method is the text to be displayed in the window.

A dialog created this way will contain a yellow triangle warning symbol (similar to those found on electrical devices), the text of the warning message, and a single button saying &quot;OK&quot; which will close the window.

Such a dialog also assumes control over the user interface, preventing the user from proceeding with any other task in the application until the dialog window is closed.

== Criticism ==

Modal alert dialogs are prone to produce mode errors due to their unrequested nature. A study to appear at the &quot;Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society&quot; showed that when a user dialog appears, the primary goal of users is typically to get rid of them as soon as possible even without any analysis of the causes for the dialog appearance. When asked, users dismissed any dialog box as a distraction from their assigned task.

This is explained by a common complaint about the wording of the message in the alert box, which is often incomprehensible to the user. In applications without proper user-centered design, the developers decide the text of the message, including terms and concepts from the mental model of the programmer, not of the user&#x27;s view of the world. Since the dialog doesn&#x27;t work to accomplish the user needs, the common reaction will be to dismiss the alert without further consideration.

Dangerous actions should be undoable wherever possible; a modal dialog that appears unexpectedly or which is dismissed by habituation will not protect from the dangerous action. This problem can be avoided by providing an undo action instead of a warning, or showing the warning in an infobar instead of a dialog.

Another recognized problem is that, as a modal window, the dialog blocks all workflow in the program until it is closed. Users may not recognize that the dialog requires their attention, leading to confusion about the main window being non-responsive, or causing loss of the user&#x27;s data input. This often happens in data entry forms after an error alert produced by invalid data. The preferred design include changing a visual aspect of the input element to reflect an invalid entry (such as applying a red border), or adding a character such as an asterisk next to the input element that needs to be corrected.

<doc id="903029" wikidata="Q1637631" url="?curid=903029" title="Planning fallacy">
<text>The planning fallacy is a phenomenon in which predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task display an optimism bias and underestimate the time needed. This phenomenon sometimes occurs regardless of the individual&#x27;s knowledge that past tasks of a similar nature have taken longer to complete than generally planned. The bias affects predictions only about one&#x27;s own tasks. On the other hand, when outside observers predict task completion times, they tend to exhibit a pessimistic bias, overestimating the time needed. The planning fallacy involves estimates of task completion times more optimistic than those encountered in similar projects in the past.
The planning fallacy was first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. In 2003, Lovallo and Kahneman proposed an expanded definition as the tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions and at the same time overestimate the benefits of the same actions. According to this definition, the planning fallacy results in not only time overruns, but also cost overruns and benefit shortfalls.

== Empirical evidence ==

=== For individual tasks ===
In a 1994 study, 37 psychology students were asked to estimate how long it would take to finish their senior theses. The average estimate was 33.9 days. They also estimated how long it would take &quot;if everything went as well as it possibly could&quot; (averaging 27.4 days) and &quot;if everything went as poorly as it possibly could&quot; (averaging 48.6 days). The average actual completion time was 55.5 days, with about 30% of the students completing their thesis in the amount of time they predicted.

Another study asked students to estimate when they would complete their personal academic projects. Specifically, the researchers asked for estimated times by which the students thought it was 50%, 75%, and 99% probable their personal projects would be done.
* 13% of subjects finished their project by the time they had assigned a 50% probability level;
* 19% finished by the time assigned a 75% probability level;
* 45% finished by the time of their 99% probability level.

A survey of Canadian tax payers, published in 1997, found that they mailed in their tax forms about a week later than they predicted. They had no misconceptions about their past record of getting forms mailed in, but expected that they would get it done more quickly next time. This illustrates a defining feature of the planning fallacy: that people recognize that their past predictions have been over-optimistic, while insisting that their current predictions are realistic.

=== For group tasks ===
Carter and colleagues conducted three studies in 2005 that demonstrate empirical support that the planning fallacy also affects predictions concerning group tasks. This research emphasizes the importance of how temporal frames and thoughts of successful completion contribute to the planning fallacy.

== Proposed explanations ==
* Kahneman and Tversky originally explained the fallacy by envisaging that planners focus on the most optimistic scenario for the task, rather than using their full experience of how much time similar tasks require. 
* Roger Buehler and colleagues account for the fallacy by examining wishful thinking; in other words, people think tasks will be finished quickly and easily because that is what they want to be the case.
* In a different paper, Buehler and colleagues suggest an explanation in terms of the self-serving bias in how people interpret their past performance. By taking credit for tasks that went well but blaming delays on outside influences, people can discount past evidence of how long a task should take. One experiment found that when people made their predictions anonymously, they do not show the optimistic bias. This suggests that the people make optimistic estimates so as to create a favorable impression with others, which is similar to the concepts outlined in impression management theory.
* Another explanation proposed by Roy and colleagues is that people do not correctly recall the amount of time that similar tasks in the past had taken to complete; instead people systematically underestimate the duration of those past events. Thus, a prediction about future event duration is biased because memory of past event duration is also biased. Roy and colleagues note that this memory bias does not rule out other mechanisms of the planning fallacy.
* Sanna and colleagues examined temporal framing and thinking about success as a contributor to the planning fallacy. They found that when people were induced to think about a deadline as distant (i.e., much time remaining) vs. rapidly approaching (i.e., little time remaining), they made more optimistic predictions and had more thoughts of success. In their final study, they found that the ease of generating thoughts also caused more optimistic predictions.
* One explanation, focalism, proposes that people fall victim to the planning fallacy because they only focus on the future task and do not consider similar tasks of the past that took longer to complete than expected.
* As described by Fred Brooks in &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;, adding new personnel to an already-late project incurs a variety of risks and overhead costs that tend to make it even later; this is known as Brooks&#x27;s law.
* The &quot;authorization imperative&quot; offers another possible explanation: much of project planning takes place in a context which requires financial approval to proceed with the project, and the planner often has a stake in getting the project approved. This dynamic may lead to a tendency on the part of the planner to deliberately underestimate the project effort required. It is easier to get forgiveness (for overruns) than permission (to commence the project if a realistic effort estimate were provided). Such deliberate underestimation has been named by Jones and Euske &quot;strategic misrepresentation&quot;.
* Apart from psychological explanations, the phenomenon of the planning fallacy has also been explained by Taleb as resulting from natural asymmetry and from scaling issues. The asymmetry results from random events giving negative results of delay or cost, not evenly balanced between positive and negative results. The scaling difficulties relate to the observation that consequences of disruptions are not linear, that as size of effort increases the error increases much more as a natural effect of inefficiencies of larger efforts&#x27; ability to react, particularly efforts that are not divisible in increments. Additionally this is contrasted with earlier efforts being more commonly on-time (e.g. the Empire State Building, The Crystal Palace, the Golden Gate Bridge) to conclude it indicates inherent flaws in more modern planning systems and modern efforts having hidden fragility. (For example, that modern efforts – being computerized and less localized invisibly – have less insight and control, and more dependencies on transportation.)
* Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner write that planning on government-funded projects is often rushed so that construction can begin as soon as possible to avoid later administrations undoing or cancelling the project. They say a longer planning period tends to result in faster and cheaper construction.

== Methods for counteracting ==

=== Segmentation effect ===
The segmentation effect is defined as the time allocated for a task being significantly smaller than the sum of the time allocated to individual smaller sub-tasks of that task. In a study performed by Forsyth in 2008, this effect was tested to determine if it could be used to reduce the planning fallacy. In three experiments, the segmentation effect was shown to be influential. However, the segmentation effect demands a great deal of cognitive resources and is not very feasible to use in everyday situations.

=== Implementation intentions ===
Implementation intentions are concrete plans that accurately show how, when, and where one will act. It has been shown through various experiments that implementation intentions help people become more aware of the overall task and see all possible outcomes. Initially, this actually causes predictions to become even more optimistic. However, it is believed that forming implementation intentions &quot;explicitly recruits willpower&quot; by having the person commit themselves to the completion of the task. Those that had formed implementation intentions during the experiments began work on the task sooner, experienced fewer interruptions, and later predictions had reduced optimistic bias than those who had not. It was also found that the reduction in optimistic bias was mediated by the reduction in interruptions.

=== Reference class forecasting ===
Reference class forecasting predicts the outcome of a planned action based on actual outcomes in a reference class of similar actions to that being forecast.

== Real-world examples ==

The Sydney Opera House was expected to be completed in 1963. A scaled-down version opened in 1973, a decade later. The original cost was estimated at $7 million, but its delayed completion led to a cost of $102 million.

The Eurofighter Typhoon defense project took six years longer than expected, with an overrun cost of 8 billion euros.

The Big Dig which undergrounded the Boston Central Artery was completed seven years later than planned,
for $8.08 billion on a budget of $2.8 billion (in 1988 dollars). 

The Denver International Airport opened sixteen months later than scheduled, with a total cost of $4.8 billion, over $2 billion more than expected.

The Berlin Brandenburg Airport is another case. After 15 years of planning, construction began in 2006, with the opening planned for October 2011. There were numerous delays. It was finally opened on October 31, 2020. The original budget was €2.83 billion; current projections are close to €10.0 billion.

Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant Unit 3 faced severe delay and a cost overrun. The construction started in 2005 and was expected to be completed by 2009, but completed only in 2023. Initially, the estimated cost of the project was around 3 billion euros, but the cost has escalated to approximately 10 billion euros.

California High-Speed Rail is still under construction, with tens of billions of dollars in overruns expected, and connections to major cities postponed until after completion of the rural segment.

The James Webb Space Telescope went over budget by approximately 9 billion dollars, and was sent into orbit 14 years later than its originally planned launch date.

<doc id="903032" wikidata="Q1228841" url="?curid=903032" title="Modular exponentiation">
<text>Modular exponentiation is exponentiation performed over a modulus. It is useful in computer science, especially in the field of public-key cryptography, where it is used in both Diffie–Hellman key exchange and RSA public/private keys.

Modular exponentiation is the remainder when an integer (the base) is raised to the power (the exponent), and divided by a positive integer (the modulus); that is, . From the definition of division, it follows that .

For example, given , and , dividing by leaves a remainder of .

Modular exponentiation can be performed with a &quot;negative&quot; exponent by finding the modular multiplicative inverse of modulo using the extended Euclidean algorithm. That is:
:, where and .

Modular exponentiation is efficient to compute, even for very large integers. On the other hand, computing the modular discrete logarithm – that is, finding the exponent when given , , and – is believed to be difficult. This one-way function behavior makes modular exponentiation a candidate for use in cryptographic algorithms.

== Direct method ==
The most direct method of calculating a modular exponent is to calculate directly, then to take this number modulo . Consider trying to compute , given , , and :

One could use a calculator to compute 413; this comes out to 67,108,864. Taking this value modulo 497, the answer is determined to be 445.

Note that is only one digit in length and that is only two digits in length, but the value is 8 digits in length.

In strong cryptography, is often at least 1024 bits. Consider and , both of which are perfectly reasonable values. In this example, is 77 digits in length and is 2 digits in length, but the value is 1,304 decimal digits in length. Such calculations are possible on modern computers, but the sheer magnitude of such numbers causes the speed of calculations to slow considerably. As and increase even further to provide better security, the value becomes unwieldy.

The time required to perform the exponentiation depends on the operating environment and the processor. The method described above requires multiplications to complete.

== Memory-efficient method ==
Keeping the numbers smaller requires additional modular reduction operations, but the reduced size makes each operation faster, saving time (as well as memory) overall.

This algorithm makes use of the identity

The modified algorithm is:
:Inputs &quot;An integer (base), integer (exponent), and a positive integer (modulus)&quot;
:Outputs &quot;The modular exponent where&quot; 
:# Initialise and loop variable 
:# While do
:## Increment by 1
:## Calculate 
:# Output 

Note that at the end of every iteration through the loop, the equation holds true. The algorithm ends when the loop has been executed times. At that point contains the result of .

In summary, this algorithm increases by one until it is equal to . At every step multiplying the result from the previous iteration, , by and performing a modulo operation on the resulting product, thereby keeping the resulting a small integer.

The example , , and is presented again. The algorithm performs the iteration thirteen times:
: 
: 
: 
: 
: 
: 

The final answer for is therefore 445, as in the direct method.

Like the first method, this requires multiplications to complete. However, since the numbers used in these calculations are much smaller than the numbers used in the first algorithm&#x27;s calculations, the computation time decreases by a factor of at least in this method.

In pseudocode, this method can be performed the following way:
 function modular_pow(base, exponent, modulus) is
 if modulus = 1 then
 return 0
 c := 1
 for e_prime = 0 to exponent-1 do
 c := (c * base) mod modulus
 return c

== Right-to-left binary method ==
A third method drastically reduces the number of operations to perform modular exponentiation, while keeping the same memory footprint as in the previous method. It is a combination of the previous method and a more general principle called exponentiation by squaring (also known as &quot;binary exponentiation&quot;).

First, it is required that the exponent be converted to binary notation. That is, can be written as:
: formula_1

In such notation, the &quot;length&quot; of is bits. can take the value 0 or 1 for any such that . By definition, .

The value can then be written as:
: formula_2

The solution is therefore:
: formula_3

=== Pseudocode ===

The following is an example in pseudocode based on Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier. The inputs base, exponent, and modulus correspond to , , and in the equations given above.

 function modular_pow(base, exponent, modulus) is
 if modulus = 1 then
 return 0
 Assert :: (modulus - 1) * (modulus - 1) does not overflow base
 result := 1
 base := base mod modulus
 while exponent &gt; 0 do
 if (exponent mod 2 == 1) then
 result := (result * base) mod modulus
 exponent := exponent » 1
 base := (base * base) mod modulus
 return result

Note that upon entering the loop for the first time, the code variable base is equivalent to . However, the repeated squaring in the third line of code ensures that at the completion of every loop, the variable base is equivalent to , where is the number of times the loop has been iterated. (This makes the next working bit of the binary exponent exponent, where the least-significant bit is exponent0).

The first line of code simply carries out the multiplication in formula_4. If is zero, no code executes since this effectively multiplies the running total by one. If instead is one, the variable base (containing the value of the original base) is simply multiplied in.

In this example, the base is raised to the exponent .
The exponent is 1101 in binary. There are four binary digits, so the loop executes four times, with values , and .

First, initialize the result formula_5 to 1 and preserve the value of in the variable :
: formula_6.
: Step 1) bit 1 is 1, so set formula_7;
:: set formula_8.
: Step 2) bit 2 is 0, so do not reset ;
:: set formula_9.
: Step 3) bit 3 is 1, so set formula_10;
:: set formula_11.
: Step 4) bit 4 is 1, so set formula_12;
:: This is the last step so we don&#x27;t need to square .
We are done: is now formula_13.

Here is the above calculation, where we compute to the power , performed modulo 497.

Initialize:
: formula_14 and formula_15.
: Step 1) bit 1 is 1, so set formula_16;
:: set formula_17.
: Step 2) bit 2 is 0, so do not reset ;
:: set formula_18.
: Step 3) bit 3 is 1, so set formula_19;
:: set formula_20.
: Step 4) bit 4 is 1, so set formula_21;

We are done: is now formula_22, the same result obtained in the previous algorithms.

The running time of this algorithm is exponent. When working with large values of exponent, this offers a substantial speed benefit over the previous two algorithms, whose time is exponent. For example, if the exponent was 220 = 1048576, this algorithm would have 20 steps instead of 1048576 steps.

=== Implementation in Lua ===

 function modPow(b, e, m)
 if m == 1 then
 return 0
 end
 local r = 1
 b = b % m
 while e &gt; 0 do
 if e % 2 == 1 then
 r = (r*b) % m
 end
 b = (b*b) % m
 e = e » 1 --use &#x27;e = math.floor(e / 2)&#x27; on Lua 5.2 or older
 end
 return r
 end

== Left-to-right binary method ==
We can also use the bits of the exponent in left to right order. In practice, we would usually want the result modulo some modulus . In that case, we would reduce each multiplication result before proceeding. For simplicity, the modulus calculation is omitted here. This example shows how to compute formula_13 using left to right binary exponentiation. The exponent is 1101 in binary; there are 4 bits, so there are 4 iterations.

Initialize the result to 1: formula_24.
: Step 1) formula_25; bit 1 = 1, so compute formula_26;
: Step 2) formula_27; bit 2 = 1, so compute formula_28;
: Step 3) formula_29; bit 3 = 0, so we are done with this step;
: Step 4) formula_30; bit 4 = 1, so compute formula_31.

=== Minimum multiplications ===
In &quot;The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 2, Seminumerical Algorithms&quot;, page 463, Donald Knuth notes that contrary to some assertions, this method does always give the minimum possible number of multiplications. The smallest counterexample is for a power of 15, when the binary method needs six multiplications. Instead, form &quot;x&quot;3 in two multiplications, then &quot;x&quot;6 by squaring &quot;x&quot;3, then &quot;x&quot;12 by squaring &quot;x&quot;6, and finally &quot;x&quot;15 by multiplying &quot;x&quot;12 and &quot;x&quot;3, thereby achieving the desired result with only five multiplications. However, many pages follow describing how such sequences might be contrived in general.

== Generalizations ==
=== Matrices ===
The -th term of any constant-recursive sequence (such as Fibonacci numbers or Perrin numbers) where each term is a linear function of previous terms can be computed efficiently modulo by computing , where is the corresponding companion matrix. The above methods adapt easily to this application. This can be used for primality testing of large numbers , for example.

; Pseudocode
A recursive algorithm for codice_1 = , where is a square matrix.
 function Matrix_ModExp(Matrix A, int b, int c) is
 if b == 0 then
 return I // The identity matrix
 if (b mod 2 == 1) then
 return (A * Matrix_ModExp(A, b - 1, c)) mod c
 Matrix D := Matrix_ModExp(A, b / 2, c)
 return (D * D) mod c

=== Finite cyclic groups ===
Diffie–Hellman key exchange uses exponentiation in finite cyclic groups. The above methods for modular matrix exponentiation clearly extend to this context. The modular matrix multiplication is simply replaced everywhere by the group multiplication .

=== Reversible and quantum modular exponentiation ===

In quantum computing, modular exponentiation appears as the bottleneck of Shor&#x27;s algorithm, where it must be computed by a circuit consisting of reversible gates, which can be further broken down into quantum gates appropriate for a specific physical device. Furthermore, in Shor&#x27;s algorithm it is possible to know the base and the modulus of exponentiation at every call, which enables various circuit optimizations.

== Software implementations ==
Because modular exponentiation is an important operation in computer science, and there are efficient algorithms (see above) that are much faster than simply exponentiating and then taking the remainder, many programming languages and arbitrary-precision integer libraries have a dedicated function to perform modular exponentiation:
* Python&#x27;s built-in codice_2 (exponentiation) function takes an optional third argument, the modulus
* .NET Framework&#x27;s codice_3 class has a codice_4 method to perform modular exponentiation
* Java&#x27;s codice_5 class has a method to perform modular exponentiation
* MATLAB&#x27;s codice_6 function from Symbolic Math Toolbox
*Wolfram Language has the PowerMod function
* Perl&#x27;s codice_7 module has a codice_8 method to perform modular exponentiation
* Raku has a built-in routine codice_9.
* Go&#x27;s codice_10 type contains an codice_11 (exponentiation) method whose third parameter, if non-nil, is the modulus
* PHP&#x27;s BC Math library has a codice_12 function to perform modular exponentiation
* The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) library contains a codice_13 function to perform modular exponentiation
* Custom Function codice_14 for FileMaker Pro (with 1024-bit RSA encryption example)
* Ruby&#x27;s codice_15 package has the codice_16 method to perform modular exponentiation.
* The HP Prime Calculator has the CAS.powmod() function to perform modular exponentiation. For a^b mod c, a can be no larger than 1 EE 12. This is the maximum precision of most HP calculators including the Prime.

<text>Desmond Tremaine Mason (born October 11, 1977) is an American painter and former professional basketball player. He played as a shooting guard and small forward. Mason has also found success as an artist, working in a variety of media. Currently, he is an NBA analyst and sports radio co-host for The Franchise, a sports talk station in Oklahoma City.

==Professional career==

=== Seattle SuperSonics (2000–2003) ===
Desmond Mason was drafted out of Oklahoma State University by the Seattle SuperSonics with the 17th pick of the 2000 NBA draft. In 2001, he became the first SuperSonics&#x27; player in franchise history to win the NBA Slam Dunk Contest. He also finished in second place in the 2003 contest behind Jason Richardson.

=== Milwaukee Bucks (2003–2005) ===
In 2003, Mason and Gary Payton were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Ray Allen and Ronald Murray. The trade would be remembered as one of the worst trades in Milwaukee sports history, Payton left as a free agent the following offseason and while Mason showed improvement from his Seattle days, he was no replacement for all-star-level Allen. At least one life-long Milwaukee fan, the noteworthy JPC, has been quoted on Mason&#x27;s tenure with the Bucks, &quot;Yeah, but man could he fly!&quot;
On November 30, 2004, Mason led all scorers with 32 points in a 95–90 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers.

=== New Orleans Hornets (2005–2007) ===
On October 26, 2005, Mason was traded, along with a first-round draft pick in the 2006 NBA draft, to the New Orleans Hornets in exchange for Jamaal Magloire. On January 6, 2007, Mason scored 28 points in a Hornets loss against the Indiana Pacers.

=== Second stint with Milwaukee (2007–2008) ===
On July 23, 2007, Mason signed a contract with the Bucks after a two-season absence. Initially angry with Bucks general manager Larry Harris for trading him in 2005, Mason said he was happy to be back in Milwaukee.

=== Oklahoma City Thunder (2008–2009) ===
On August 13, 2008, Mason was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder (the relocated Seattle SuperSonics franchise) in a three-team, six-player deal involving the Thunder, the Milwaukee Bucks and the Cleveland Cavaliers, that sent Milwaukee&#x27;s Mo Williams to Cleveland, Mason and Cleveland&#x27;s Joe Smith to Oklahoma City, and Cleveland&#x27;s Damon Jones and Oklahoma City&#x27;s Luke Ridnour and Adrian Griffin to Milwaukee.

=== Sacramento Kings (2009) ===
On September 17, 2009, Mason signed a contract with the Sacramento Kings at league minimum. After playing in just five games (starting four), he was waived by the Kings. Mason&#x27;s final NBA game was played on November 4, 2009, in a 105–113 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. In that game, Mason played three-and-a-half minutes and recorded no stats other than a foul.

==Media appearances==
In February 2007, Mason recorded a hip-hop video called &quot;We Dem Hornets&quot; in which he gave an inspirational roll-call of the entire 2006–07 Hornets team. He said: &quot;Brandon (Bass) and I write a lot on the bus... I wrote a song about the team and let them listen to it. I rapped it to them on the bus and on the plane and a lot of the guys really liked it. I tweaked it, cleaned it up, and went over to (videographer intern and son of head coach Byron Scott) Thomas Scott&#x27;s house and we put it down and then they wanted to put a video to it. It was just for fun.&quot; Commenting on the fact that the Hornets started to win after the video was shown, Mason commented: &quot;I think it went over well. They showed it in the locker room and everybody liked it, all of the players liked it. It was done well and (the highlights) fit together really well.&quot;

In July 2018, Mason also appeared as a guest on a chartered yacht on season 3 of the show &quot;Below Deck Mediterranean&quot;, initially in an episode entitled &quot;Panic at the Deck-O&quot; on the Bravo network in the United States.

==Artwork==
Mason majored in studio art in college, and at one point considered becoming an art teacher. He works with a variety of media, such as oil paint, acrylic paint, watercolors, and ceramics. In 2004, he founded the Desmond Mason Art Show, which supports a variety of charitable organizations. His works have been on display at museums and galleries, such as the Gaylord-Pickens Oklahoma Heritage Museum.

Mason has been described as an abstract expressionist. &quot;I paint by emotion so everything I create is a piece of me to some extent&quot;, he said in 2013.

Mason helped make a series of art murals in Milwaukee following the Bucks NBA championship win in 2021.

<text>Alfred Pellan (born Alfred Pelland; 16 May 1906 – 31 October 1988) was an important figure in twentieth-century Canadian painting.

==Biography==
Alfred Pellan was born on 16 May 1906 in the Saint-Roch quarter of Quebec City. His mother, Régina Damphousse, died when he was young, and his father, Alfred Pelland, a locomotive engineer, raised their three children. In school, Pellan filled the margins of his notebooks with drawings and excelled at his art classes, with little interest in other subjects. He later changed his surname to &quot;Pellan&quot;.

In 1920 Pellan enrolled at the School of Fine Arts of Quebec. He won first prizes in advanced courses and earned medals in painting, drawing, sculpture, sketching, anatomy and advertising. He sold his first painting at the age of 17 to the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa.

In 1926 Pellan received the first fine arts scholarship in Quebec, which allowed him to spend several years in Paris and visit Venice. From 1926 until 1930, he studied at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Besides his mandatory classes, Pellan also sat in on sessions at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and the Académie Colarossi, where he met painter Lucien Simon (1861-1945). When his scholarship ended, he prolonged his stay in Paris, taking on odd jobs as a graphic designer and poster publisher as well as receiving financial support from his father. He won first prize at the exhibition of mural art in 1935 in Paris and rubbed elbows with the most famous artists of the time. Traveling Europe, he became &quot;permeated by the mainstream art of the era&quot;. His early canvases, from his first visit to Paris, show a marked fauvist tendency.

In 1936, at the urging of his father, Pellan applied for a professorship at the École des Beaux-Arts in Quebec City. However, he was rejected by the jury, who found him too &quot;modern&quot;. With the outbreak of the Second World War, he returned to Canada and settled in Montreal in 1940. In June 1940, Pellan exhibited more than 161 works at the Musée de la Province in Quebec City (now the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec) and at the Art Association of Montreal. Reflecting a wide range of stylistic techniques and encompassing much of his Parisian oeuvre, critics lauded the artist, suggesting that his work reflected a turning point in Canadian art history. However, these works were not commercially successful and Pellan struggled to find consistent buyers in the Canadian market. From 1943 to 1952 he taught at the École des Beaux-Arts in Montreal. His active opposition to the theories of Charles Maillard, the school&#x27;s director, succeeded in pressuring Maillard to resign in 1944. The school then became more liberal in its approach. Pellan committed himself to an independent art, more open to universality and evolution.

During the 1940s, Pellan illustrated poetry books and designed costumes and sets for the theatre. His style matured and developed during this period. Surrealism began to attract him more strongly: his imagery became more erotic and his paintings, always vivid and striking, became larger, more complex and more textured. Pellan remained actively engaged with the Surrealist movement, continuing to explore its stylistic techniques and visual motifs throughout his career. Art historian Maria Rosa Lehmann suggests that Surrealism&#x27;s influence in Quebec is strongly tied to Pellan. 

Though Pellan had no desire to be formally associated with any particular art movement, in early 1948 he founded the group &quot;Prisme d’yeux&quot;. Its manifesto was written by Jacques de Tonnancour and advocated freedom of expression in art, speaking for a group that called for art free of any ideology. Later that year, an even more radical group was formed, which produced the manifesto Refus global first set out by Borduas, which completely overshadowed the manifesto penned by &quot;Prisme d&#x27;yeux&quot;. Although Pellan and Borduas shared the same impetus to challenge conservatism within the Quebec art world, they were often at odds over their differing views concerning modern art&#x27;s social role. Whereas Borduas advocated for moving beyond public opinion, Pellan aimed to make modern art accessible to collectors and general audiences. 

In 1952, Pellan received a scholarship from the Royal Society of Canada, which enabled a return to Paris. He remained in Paris with his wife Madeleine, whom he had married in 1949, until 1955. During this brief stay, the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de Paris organized an exhibition of 181 of his works, sponsored by the governments of France and Canada. Pellan was the first Canadian to be given a solo exhibition in Paris in the museum.

Works by Pellan along with those of David Milne, Goodridge Roberts and Emily Carr represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1952.

Back in Quebec for two years, he resumed his painting classes in 1957 as a professor at the Art Centre of Sainte-Adèle while living in his house in Auteuil, Laval. His reputation continued to grow among Canadian art experts, he became more widely known through solo and group exhibitions, and he received commissions for murals, which helped establish his fame throughout the country.

In 1971, he received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University.

==Death==
In 1978, Pellan was diagnosed with leukemia and produced only five works during his last ten years with the aid of his assistant Michel Vermeulen. He died in Montreal on 31 October 1988, aged 82 and was interred in the Parc du Souvenir in Auteuil. His wife died in 2010.

==Recognition and legacy==
Several monographs and documentaries were devoted to him during his lifetime. He received a number of awards and honours, notably Companion of the Order of Canada. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

On 21 April 1995 Canada Post issued &#x27;Blossoming, c. 1950, Alfred Pellan&#x27; in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on a painting &quot;Blossoming&quot;, circa 1950 by Alfred Pellan in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario. The 88¢ stamps are perforated 13 X 13.5 and were printed by Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited.

Two of Pellan&#x27;s paintings, Canada West and Canada East, were commissioned for the Canadian mission in Brazil in the 1940s and relocated to the Lester B. Pearson Building in Ottawa in 1973. From 2011 to 2015 they were removed by the federal government and replaced by a large portrait of the Queen. In November 2015 the two paintings were restored to their original location.

<doc id="903044" wikidata="Q2852458" url="?curid=903044" title="U.S. Route 340">
<text>U.S. Route 340 (US 340) is a spur route of US 40, and runs from Greenville, Virginia, to Frederick, Maryland. In Virginia, it runs north–south, parallel and east of US 11, from US 11 north of Greenville via Waynesboro, Grottoes, Elkton, Luray, Front Royal, and Berryville to the West Virginia state line. A short separate piece crosses northern Loudoun County on its way from West Virginia to Maryland.

In West Virginia, it runs north–south in Jefferson County, between Clarke County, Virginia and Loudoun County, Virginia. It is the main route between Charles Town and Harpers Ferry, and it is known as the [[William Lyne Wilson|William L. Wilson]] Freeway through that stretch. The southern portion of the highway, between the Virginia state line and Charles Town, is known as Berryville Pike.

In Maryland, the U.S. highway runs east-west, for from the Virginia state line at the Potomac River at Sandy Hook east to its northern (eastern) terminus at US 15 and US 40 (the Frederick Freeway) in Frederick. US 340, which is known for most of its length as Jefferson National Pike, connects Frederick with the communities of Jefferson, Brunswick, and Knoxville in the southern part of the Middletown Valley of western Frederick County and Weverton in far southern Washington County. The U.S. highway also links Frederick with Harpers Ferry and Charles Town in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. US 340 is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length in Maryland.

US 340 was one of the original state roads designated by the Maryland State Roads Commission. The state road was constructed from Frederick to Knoxville in the early 1910s and completed to Harpers Ferry in 1919. The highway was designated Maryland&#x27;s portion of US 340 in 1926. US 340 originally crossed the Potomac River at Harpers Ferry; however, the U.S. highway&#x27;s bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1936. The modern US 340 Bridge was constructed at Sandy Hook between 1940 and 1947, with a long interruption due to World War II. The U.S. highway&#x27;s freeway between Weverton and Frederick was constructed in the 1960s. Old sections of US 340 became part of Maryland Route 180 (MD 180).

US 340 has a length of in Virginia. This number includes the second Virginia segment between the stretch through West Virginia and the route in Maryland.

US 340 contains several segments that are part of the National Highway System. The U.S. highway is part of the main system from Virginia State Route 7 (SR 7) near Berryville to its northern terminus in Frederick. US 340 is a National Highway System principal arterial from I-64 to its eastern junction with US 250 in Waynesboro, along its US 211 concurrency near Luray, and from US 522 to I-66 in Front Royal. The U.S. Highway&#x27;s other junctions with highways part of the National Highway System include US 33 in Elkton, West Virginia Route 9 (WV 9) in Charles Town, and Maryland Route 180 (MD 180) in Knoxville as part of an intermodal connection to Brunswick station.

===Greenville to Elkton===

US 340 begins at an intersection with US 11 (Lee Highway) on the northern edge of Greenville and just east of US 11&#x27;s interchange with I-64 and I-81 in southern Augusta County. The U.S. Highway heads northeast as two-lane Stuarts Draft Highway, which crosses several branches of Christians Creek and then Christians Creek itself. US 340 expands to a five-lane road with center turn lane west of the village of Stuarts Draft. The highway passes the historic Harper House then expands to divided highway. US 340 passes through the hamlet of Ladd before leaving Augusta County and entering the independent city of Waynesboro at its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-64. The highway follows Rosser Avenue northeast, crosses Pratts Run, and reduces to two lanes as the route approaches the west end of downtown, where the route meets US 250. Both highways must turn off to stay on the route: US 250 heads west on Main Street and, via the north leg of the four-legged intersection, east on four-lane Broad Street, and US 340 turns east onto two-lane Main Street.

US 340 meets the eastern end of SR 254 (Poplar Avenue) and passes by Waynesboro High School, the Fishburne Military School, and the historic Plumb House and Coiner-Quesenbery House in the Waynesboro Downtown Historic District. The U.S. Highway crosses the South River and intersects US 250 at the east end of Broad Street. The two highways run concurrently east along four-lane Main Street and under Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Roanoke District rail line to Delphine Avenue, onto which US 340 turns north. The five-lane street with center turn lane passes through the Basic City portion of Waynesboro, where the highway passes under the Buckingham Branch Railroad, crosses Steel Run, and passes by Fairfax Hall. US 340 passes the General Electric Specialty Control Plant and parallels the Norfolk Southern rail line north out of the city and back into Augusta County.
US 340 continues north as East Side Highway, which parallels the South River and the rail line along the flank of the Blue Ridge Mountains along the eastern edge of the Shenandoah Valley. The highway crosses Sawmill Run and reduces to two lanes in the community of Dooms and crosses Mine Branch in the village of Crimora. US 340 crosses Meadows Run, Pains Run, and Still Run and enters Rockingham County at the south end of the town of Grottoes. The highway follows Augusta Avenue through the east side of the town and meets the eastern end of SR 256 (Third Street). US 340 curves northeast and meets the eastern end of SR 253 (Port Republic Road) south of Port Republic, where the South River and North River merge to form the South Fork Shenandoah River. The highway passes to the south of the historic estate Bogota and by a monument to the Battle of Port Republic at Lynnwood. US 340 closely parallels the railroad through Berrytown to the town of Elkton, where the route follows Stuart Avenue. The highway expands to a four-lane divided highway for its partial cloverleaf interchange with US 33 (Spotswood Trail) and briefly runs concurrently with US 33 Bus. from the interchange to Old Spotswood Trail, onto which the business route continues west.

===Elkton to Front Royal===
US 340 leaves Elkton along a continuation of Stuart Avenue and continues north through the Page Valley, the valley of the South Fork Shenandoah River between the Blue Ridge Mountains to the east and Massanutten Mountain to the west. The highway crosses Dry Run, passes by the historic home Bon Air, and at Verbena crosses Naked Creek into Page County. US 340 curves northwest and enters the town of Shenandoah along Fourth Street. In the center of the Shenandoah Historic District, the highway curves north onto Fifth Street. Shortly after leaving the town, US 340 crosses over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Hagerstown District rail line. The highway passes through Grove Hill and crosses over the South Fork Shenandoah River. US 340 crosses Cub Run and passes through the hamlet of Newport before meeting the southern end of US 340 Bus. (Stonewall Jackson Memorial Highway), which heads east and then north through Alma and Stanley. The U.S. Highway heads through Battle Creek and meets US 211 at Intersections at the base of that highway&#x27;s ascent of Massanutten Mountain to New Market Gap. US 340 and US 211 run concurrently along four-lane divided Lee Highway northeast toward Luray. The routes pass by the historic estate Massanutton Heights, pass through Salem, and cross the South Fork Shenandoah River at Whitehouse Landing, the site of The White House. The two U.S. highways head northeast to bypass Luray where US 211 Business (Main Street) heads east into the town just south of Luray Caverns. After crossing Hawksbill Creek, US 340 leaves US 211 at a diamond interchange that serves as the northern terminus of US 340 Bus. (Broad Street).

US 340 continues northeast as two-lane Stonewall Jackson Memorial Highway through the communities of Springfield, Big Spring, and Oak Hill. The highway crosses Jeremys Run at Rileyville and crosses over the rail line between there and Compton, north of which the route passes under the railroad. US 340 enters Warren County at the hamlet of Overall by crossing Overall Run on the Overall Bridge, a Pratt deck arch truss bridge next to the rail line&#x27;s bridge; these crossings are near the Milford Battlefield. The highway continues through Bentonville, the site of Shenandoah River Raymond R. &quot;Andy&quot; Guest Jr. State Park. US 340 crosses over the rail line and Flint Run north of Limeton and through Karo between its bridges across Gooney Run and Dry Run. The U.S. Highway temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway and meets the northern terminus of Skyline Drive as the route enters the town of Front Royal at the north end of the Page Valley.

US 340 enters Front Royal along four-lane Royal Avenue; the highway drops to two lanes at SR 55 (South Street), from which the state highway joins U.S. Highway. The two highways pass the Warren County Courthouse at the west end of the Front Royal Historic District. US 340 and SR 55 meet US 522 next to Rose Hill at Commercial Avenue, from which the other U.S. Highway joins the concurrency. The three highways follow four-lane Royal Avenue north to a right-angle curve where the three routes curve onto 14th Street and then turn north onto four-lane divided Shenandoah Street. US 340, US 522, and SR 55 cross Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Hagerstown District rail line and the South Fork Shenandoah River into the Riverton area of Front Royal, where SR 55 splits to the west onto Strasburg Road. The two U.S. Highways then cross the North Fork Shenandoah River and Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s B-Line just west of the confluence of the two Shenandoah River forks. US 340 and US 522 cross Crooked Run and have a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-66 as they leave the town of Front Royal.

===Front Royal to Harpers Ferry===

US 340 and US 522 head north along four-lane divided Winchester Road. The highways pass through Cedarville, the site of the Virginia Inland Port, and through Nineveh, the site of the historic estate Erin. North of Nineveh, the routes follow the Warren–Frederick county line and enter Clarke County, where the road is named Stonewall Jackson Highway. US 340 and US 522 diverge at a four-legged intersection at Double Tollgate, from which US 522 continues north toward Winchester; the west leg of the junction is SR 277 (Fairfax Pike), which heads toward Stephens City. US 340 heads east along two-lane Lord Fairfax Highway. The highway passes north of Greenway Court and veers north at White Post, the site of the Greenway Historic District and the White Post Historic District. US 340 intersects US 17 and US 50 (Millwood Pike) at Waterloo and passes through the town of Boyce and its eponymous historic district, surrounding which are three historic plantations: Huntingdon, Saratoga, and Scaleby. The highway crosses Page Brook and parallels the Hagerstown District rail line through the Chapel Rural Historic District, which is centered around the namesake old chapel at the route&#x27;s junction with SR 255 (Bishop Meade Road) at Briggs. US 340 continues to the town of Berryville, through which the route follows Buckmarsh Street. The U.S. Highway intersects SR 7 Bus. (Main Street) within the Berryville Historic District, which contains the Old Clarke County Courthouse.
At the north town limit of Berryville, US 340 expands to a four-lane divided highway at its diamond interchange with SR 7 (Harry Byrd Highway). The U.S. Highway passes to the north of the historic estate Fairfield at Gaylord, where the highway crosses over the Hagerstown District rail line for the last time. North of Gaylord, US 340 drops to two lanes and enters Jefferson County, West Virginia. The highway, named Berryville Pike, passes by Ripon Lodge in Rippon and near the William Grubb Farm near Wheatland. North of Wheatland, US 340 expands to a four-lane divided highway, passes the historic farm Beverley and Washington High School, and enters the city of Charles Town at the North Fork of Bullskin Run. The U.S. Highway passes along the southern and eastern fringes of the city and has a partial interchange with WV 115, which heads toward downtown along George Street and east on Charles Town Road. US 340 next has a pair of interchanges with and runs concurrently with WV 9. The first interchange is a trumpet interchange with the portion of WV 9 that heads east toward Leesburg, Virginia. The second is a partial cloverleaf interchange that serves as the eastern terminus of WV 51 (Washington Street). WV 9 continues north on the bypass toward Martinsburg while US 340 exits to the east.

US 340 continues east along the William L. Wilson Freeway, a four-lane divided highway with traffic signals named for the William Lyne Wilson, a late 19th century Congressman from Charles Town. The U.S. Highway passes to the north of Rion Hall, crosses over CSX&#x27;s Shenandoah Subdivision rail line, and meets the southern end of WV 230 (Shepherdstown Pike) at Halltown. Along the southern edge of the town of Bolivar, US 340 meets the western end of US 340 Alt. (Washington Street), which is the main street of Bolivar and Harpers Ferry, and the entrance to the visitors center of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, which is next to the Allstadt House and Ordinary.

===Harpers Ferry to Frederick===

US 340 reduces to two lanes and begins its traversal of the Potomac Water Gap, where that river passes through two ridges. The highway descends to and crosses over the Shenandoah Subdivision and the Shenandoah River, then it follows the east bank of the river to the river&#x27;s confluence with the Potomac River. US 340 follows the south bank of the Potomac River as the river passes between Blue Ridge Mountain to the south and Elk Ridge, also known as Maryland Heights. At Blue Ridge Mountain, the U.S. Highway enters Loudoun County. US 340 has its sole intersection in its second run through Virginia with SR 671 (Harpers Ferry Road) in Loudoun Heights. The route then crosses the Potomac River into Washington County, Maryland, on a southwest–northeast angle on a two-lane steel continuous deck truss bridge that passes above Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, CSX&#x27;s Cumberland Subdivision rail line, and Sandy Hook Road. US 340 expands to a four-lane freeway at the community of Sandy Hook, curves east through a trumpet interchange with MD 67 (Rohrersville Road), and crosses Israel Creek at Weverton. The highway, the canal, and the railroad parallel the Potomac River through the second ridge, which comprises South Mountain in Maryland and Short Hill Mountain in Virginia.

US 340&#x27;s name changes to Jefferson National Pike as it enters Frederick County. The highway leaves the Potomac Water Gap and enters the Middletown Valley at its partial interchange with MD 180 (Jefferson Pike) at Knoxville; there is no access from westbound US 340 to eastbound MD 180 or from westbound MD 180 to eastbound US 340. The U.S. highway meets MD 17 (Burkittsville Road) at a diamond interchange near Rosemont and crosses Little Catoctin Creek. East of Petersville, US 340 has a diamond interchange with MD 180 and crosses Catoctin Creek. On the western edge of Jefferson, westbound US 340 receives a ramp from MD 180. Full access to Jefferson is provided by a diamond interchange with Lander Road. The U.S. highway passes through a wide gap in Catoctin Mountain and has a partial interchange with US 15 (Catoctin Mountain Highway), which heads south toward Point of Rocks. Access from northbound US 15 to westbound US 340 and from eastbound US 340 to southbound US 15 is provided through performing a U-turn at the concurrent highways&#x27; next interchange, a diamond interchange with Mt. Zion Road.
US 340 and US 15 cross over Ballenger Creek before reaching a diamond interchange with Jefferson Technology Parkway, which is unsigned MD 872G. The highway&#x27;s partial interchange with I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) features ramps from eastbound I-70 to both directions of US 340, a ramp from westbound I-70 to westbound US 340, and a ramp from eastbound US 340 to eastbound I-70 and access to southbound I-270 just to the east. Immediately to the northeast, US 340 and US 15 have a four-loop-ramp interchange with MD 180, which heads west as Jefferson Pike and south briefly as Ballenger Creek Pike. US 340 reaches its eastern terminus at the third interchange, which is a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Frederick Freeway. The first ramp from eastbound US 340 provides access to westbound I-70; the second ramp leads to the northbound Frederick Freeway (US 40), onto which US 15 exits. The ramps from westbound US 340 provide full access to I-70, I-270, US 15, and US 40. The roadway continues northeast as Jefferson Street, which reduces to a two-lane undivided street that heads toward an intersection with MD 144 (South Street eastbound and Patrick Street westbound) just west of downtown Frederick. The portion of Jefferson Street between the overpass of US 40 and just west of Jefferson Street&#x27;s intersection with Pearl Street is unsigned US 15B.

==History==
In Maryland, US 340 follows the corridor of the old road from Frederick to Harpers Ferry, part of which was organized as the Frederick and Jefferson Turnpike between the two towns. This highway became one of the original state roads marked for improvement by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The commission purchased the right-of-way of the turnpike in 1911 and resurfaced the Frederick–Jefferson highway with a wide macadam surface in 1915. The segments from Jefferson to Petersville and from Petersville to Knoxville were placed under construction in 1911 and completed as a macadam road in 1912. The highway from Knoxville to the Potomac River opposite Harpers Ferry was completed as a concrete road in 1919. The Frederick–Knoxville highway was widened to in width around 1926 and became part of US 340 in 1927. US 340 was widened again, this time to between Frederick and Knoxville, by 1934.
US 340 was widened and resurfaced with bituminous concrete from Knoxville to the approach to new bridge at Sandy Hook in 1948. In conjunction with the construction of the Frederick Freeway, US 340&#x27;s cloverleaf interchange with US 40 was built in 1954 and 1955. Jefferson Street in Frederick was widened in 1956. When US 40 was moved from Patrick Street to the Frederick Freeway in 1959, US 340&#x27;s eastern terminus was moved from Patrick Street west to the new interchange. Construction on the US 340 freeway began when the highway&#x27;s bridge across Catoctin Creek was built in 1961. This bridge came into use in 1964 when the freeway segment between the MD 180 interchange east of Petersville and the ramp from MD 180 west of Jefferson was opened, replacing the curvaceous old alignment at Catoctin Creek. The present alignment of US 340 opened as a four-lane divided highway from the Valley Road / Keep Tryst Road intersection in Sandy Hook east to Weverton also opened that year. The portion of the freeway between Weverton and MD 180 east of Petersville was under construction in 1964 and completed in 1965. MD 180 was assigned to old US 340 from Sandy Hook to west of Jefferson in 1965.

Construction on the US 340 freeway east toward Frederick began in 1966. The freeway east to the current Point of Rocks – Jefferson segment of US 15 was completed in 1967; however, the US 15 interchange would not become operational until the new US 15 was completed and the two U.S. highways became concurrent in 1970. US 340&#x27;s interchanges with I-70 and MD 180 were completed in 1968 and the portion of the freeway from the US 15 interchange east to MD 180 opened in 1969. At that time, MD 180 was extended east over the old Jefferson–Frederick section of US 340. US 340&#x27;s interchanges with MD 67 in Weverton and Mt. Zion Road near Frederick opened in 1971 and 1972, respectively. Several ramps were added to improve access between US 340 and I-70 in 1997, including a pair of ramps from eastbound I-70 to US 340 and the connection from northbound US 340 to westbound I-70 at US 340&#x27;s northern terminus. The interchange at US 340&#x27;s northern terminus was converted from a cloverleaf interchange to a partial cloverleaf interchange with traffic signals in 2004.

===Sandy Hook Bridge===
US 340 originally followed Sandy Hook Road south and west from what is now Keep Tryst Road in Sandy Hook and paralleled the Potomac River west to Maryland Heights directly across the river from downtown Harpers Ferry. There, the U.S. highway crossed the river on a converted railroad bridge immediately upstream from the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers and downstream from the two railroad bridges—one for CSX&#x27;s Cumberland Subdivision on the north and the other for the Shenandoah Subdivision—that presently cross the river at the site. After the highway bridge was destroyed in the March 1936 flood, a wooden floor was placed on the Shenandoah Subdivision bridge for that bridge to temporarily serve both rail and automobile traffic. Later in 1936, Maryland and West Virginia acquired the right-of-way of the destroyed toll bridge owned by the Harpers Ferry and Potomac Bridge Company by eminent domain with an aim to build a new bridge at the site.

In August 1939, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia decided to instead embark on a tri-state road and bridge program to replace the destroyed bridge. Plans for bridges across the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers and connecting highways were completed in August 1940. The new bridge across the Potomac river was to be placed at Sandy Hook to exploit the scenic views of the Potomac Water Gap. However, in December 1940, construction was delayed and plans needed to be modified to eliminate a sharp turn at the Virginia landing of the bridge. Despite a late request from the Virginia State Highway Department to move the Potomac River crossing upstream in June 1941, the concrete substructure of the Sandy Hook bridge was started in autumn 1941. The substructure was completed in March 1943. A request for bids for the Sandy Hook bridge&#x27;s steel superstructure was advertised in November 1941. However, with the U.S. entering into World War II the following month, the construction of the superstructure of the bridge would be delayed until after the war due to the unavailability of steel.

The Maryland State Roads Commission advertised for bids for the Sandy Hook bridge&#x27;s superstructure in December 1945. Construction started shortly thereafter and the superstructure was completed in January 1947. The Maryland and Virginia approach roads were completed later in 1947 and the bridge officially opened October 19, 1947. Although the residents of Harpers Ferry lobbied for an on-site replacement of the bridge over the Shenandoah River at Harpers Ferry so US 340 would continue to pass directly through the historic town, the West Virginia State Road Commission completed a new roadway and a new Shenandoah River crossing along US 340&#x27;s present alignment in 1949. US 340 was rerouted onto its present course over the two new bridges by 1950.

==Future==
A plan is currently being devised to expand the West Virginia portion of the road between the Virginia state line and Wheatland to a four-lane highway.

The two-lane portion of the highway between Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and the Virginia state line is often burdened by heavy traffic, and the West Virginia Department of Transportation is examining ways to mitigate backups.

An interchange has been planned for the future section of Monocacy Boulevard within the planned Jefferson Tech Park in Frederick, Maryland.

<text>El Clon () is a Spanish-language telenovela released in 2010, produced by the U.S.-based television network Telemundo, the Colombian TV production house RTI Televisión and the Brazilian network Globo. It is a remake of &quot;O Clone&quot;, a Brazilian telenovela that originally aired on Globo in 2001 and on Telemundo in 2002. This limited run melodrama, which starred Mauricio Ochmann and Sandra Echeverría, deals with topics such as drug trafficking, cloning and Islam.

Telemundo executive Mark Santana called &quot;El Clon&quot; &quot;the most ambitious telenovela in the history of television&quot;. This melodrama features a love triangle featuring Lucas, a handsome hero, challenging his clone for the love of an enticing, exotic woman. Lucas is young when he falls for a young Arab girl named Jade. She is caught between modern values and her Islamic upbringing. They separate and two decades pass. Then a strange turn of luck brings the pair together. Then Jade meets the clone, who is just like Lucas, but twenty years younger. She must choose between the man she loved and the memory she cherishes.

== History ==
The remake debuted on February 15, 2010. It was filmed in Fez, Morocco, with some scenes shot on location in the Middle East, and in Bogotá, where Girardot&#x27;s city represents Fez and Miami, although the main setting is Miami. It includes several members of the original production team, including screenwriter Glória Perez and director Jayme Monjardim.

As part of the 2010 season, Telemundo aired the serial weeknights at 8pm/7c central, replacing &quot;Más Sabe el Diablo&quot;. The series ended with a two-hour finale on October 29, 2010 with &quot;Aurora&quot; replacing it. As with most of its other soap operas, the network broadcasts English subtitles as closed captions on CC3. As part of the production deal, Globo agreed to embargo distribution of the original Portuguese version for five years.

<text>O Clone (English: The Clone) is a Brazilian telenovela created by Glória Perez and directed by Jayme Monjardim. Produced and aired by Rede Globo, it was aired from 1 October 2001 to 13 June 2002, with 221 episodes. It also was an international success, selling in 93 countries.

==Plot==
In the early 1980s, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Jade (Giovanna Antonelli), a young Muslim girl, is orphaned when her mother dies and has to go to Morocco where her uncle Alí lives. The problem is that Jade was living in a country with a culture very different from that of an Islamic country. Thus, once she arrives in Morocco, she must learn all concomitant new traditions and customs, adjust to her new way of living, and face all the punishments she will be exposed to because of her conflicting personality and actions that go against her religion.

Back in Rio, a well-off family, the Ferraz, go to vacation in Morocco. Twin brothers Lucas and Diogo Ferraz (Murilo Benício), along with Leônidas (Reginaldo Faria), their father, and doctor Augusto Albieri (Juca de Oliveira), friend of the family and the twins Godfather who is a genetic scientist, visit Alí, a friend of Albieri&#x27;s. There, Lucas and Jade meet for the first time, and they fall in love at first sight. Jade, knowing it&#x27;s haraam (a sin) to love Lucas, decides to forgo her religious mandates for the sake of love, which prohibit her from marrying a non-Muslim person. 
Meanwhile, in Rio, Diogo tragically dies in a helicopter crash. Both Lucas and Leônidas are devastated by the news and Lucas&#x27; plans of running away with Jade are subsequently ruined. Albieri, his godparent, is shattered and becomes deeply despondent. He never recovered fully from the death of his fiancée, and Diogo&#x27;s death reinvigorates his distress.

In an effort to change the natural course of events, Albieri in his despair resolves to utilize Lucas&#x27; cell in order to make the first human clone. Deusa (Adriana Lessa), a low-middle class woman who has not been able to get pregnant, is subsequently inseminated with Lucas&#x27; cell, and as a result gives birth to a baby, not knowing that it is a clone. Léo is born without complications, but Albieri wants to stay close to Léo and watch him grow up. Léo gradually becomes attached to Albieri, thus making Deusa uneasy.

Several years have passed since Léo was born. Now, Jade is married to Saíd (Dalton Vigh) and she&#x27;s a mother of a little child, Khadija (Carla Diaz). She lives happily with her new family and is even starting to love Saíd. However, due to Said&#x27;s insecurities a new encounter with Lucas is forced upon her to test Jade&#x27;s love for him, with this encounter the old passion revives, but they&#x27;re not the young lovers they once were and now they have new lives and new responsibilities. Lucas, who also is married, to Maysa (Daniela Escobar) and with a daughter, Mel (Débora Falabella) doesn&#x27;t know he had been cloned 20 years before. Albieri had kept this a secret from everybody&#x27;s knowledge and is trying to make it so that Léo and Lucas never meet and thus find out the truth. The last thing Albieri knew from Léo is that he and Deusa went to the north of Brazil, but with the return of both, Léo has become a young, handsome man, and the living image of the young Lucas whom Jade met in Morocco. The appearance of Leo in Brazil and his later travels to Morocco will change the life of all the characters forever.

==Syndication==
&quot;O Clone&quot; aired in Brazil comprising 221 episodes, of variable duration. However, when syndicated and sold to other countries the telenovela got the number of episodes enlarged to 250 and the duration fixed at 45 minutes. O Clone was a big hit, being aired in several countries all around the world. It was dubbed in several languages, with the Spanish version airing in the United States by Telemundo. There are also a few differences between the Brazilian soundtrack version and the syndicated one; some music was changed in order to make the people feel more identified, many Portuguese songs were changed to Hispanic American music when it aired to the Hispanics in the United States. See &quot;Soundtrack&quot; to see the list of music featured in the telenovela. Also, the Brazilian opening features the song &quot;Sob o Sol&quot; by Sagrado Coração da Terra, and the syndicated opening features the same video, but the music is replaced by &quot;Maktub&quot; by Marcus Viana.

==Cast==


==Portrayal of Muslims==
While the telenovela&#x27;s attention to issues of drug addiction won its creator an award, the portrayal of Arab-Muslim cultures has brought a critical response from different Arab-Muslim sources, according to a 2005 doctoral dissertation written about the program by Elizabeth Barbosa.

The part of the telenovela dealing with Islamic customs and attitudes mixes traditions from diverse countries, rather than those of Morocco alone, and has been criticised for its inaccurate representation of these traditions, according to Barbosa. These criticisms include the portrayal of polygamy as commonly accepted in Morocco, women as rarely working outside the home or pursuing an advanced education, and women having only unimportant roles within the family. Critics making these judgments included sheik Abdelmalek Cherkaoui Ghazouani, the Moroccan ambassador to Brazil, who considered the high profile of these representations to merit his posting his criticisms directly on his embassy&#x27;s website as part of a bulletin board.

== Reception ==
=== Ratings ===
In its premiere, &quot;O Clone&quot; registered a viewership rating of 47 points, peaking at 53 points.

Its ever lowest recorded data in terms of viewership was on the New Year&#x27;s Eve of 31 December 2001.

On the episode of the first between Lucas and his clone registered 56 points and 63 points peak, with 73% audience share.

In its finale, &quot;O Clone&quot; registered a viewership rating of 62 points peaking at 68 and 77% audience share.

&quot;O Clone&quot; registered a mean viewership rating of 47 points.

==Remake==
In January 2010, a remake in Spanish started to be recorded in Colombia. This remake is a production of TV Globo and Telemundo and it was titled &quot;El Clon&quot;.

<text>Isabell Masters (January 9, 1913 – September 11, 2011) of Topeka, Kansas, was a five-time perennial third-party candidate (Looking Back Party) for President of the United States.

Masters&#x27; five presidential campaigns are the most for any woman in U.S. history. She was a candidate in the 1984, 1992 (339 votes), 1996, 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. In 1996, she was only on the ballot in Arkansas (but also received a few votes in California and Maryland) (752 votes total, 2000). Her 1992 running mate was her son, Walter Ray Masters, and her 1996 running mate was her daughter, Shirley Jean Masters.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Isabell Masters was born Isabell Arch on January 9, 1913, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the daughter of Cora McDaniels (Lewis) and Walter Arch. Her father, a businessman, was of African American and German descent. Masters graduated from Douglas High School in Oklahoma City and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education from Langston University. She later earned a doctorate from the University of Oklahoma. An educator by profession, Masters taught in California, New York, Nevada and Kansas during her career. She specifically worked in schools in the American cities of Pasadena, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Kansas City and Syracuse, New York.

Masters married Alfred Masters, who became the first African American to enlist in the United States Marines when he was sworn in on June 1, 1942. They had six children together, but their marriage disintegrated during the late 1940s. She raised six children as a single mother. Masters obtained her master&#x27;s degree in higher education from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). She later earned a doctorate from the University of Oklahoma during her late 60s.

===Presidential campaigns===
In 2000 she was a write-in candidate in Kansas alongside George W. Bush and Al Gore. Her vice-presidential running mate was her daughter, Alfreda Dean Masters.

She made several unsuccessful attempts at winning the Republican primary elections for President. In 1996 she was on the ballot in Oklahoma and won 1,052 votes (Bob Dole won by a large margin).

In addition to her presidential campaigns, Masters ran for the city council in Topeka, Kansas, and was once a candidate for Mayor of West Palm Beach, Florida.

Masters&#x27; six children include Rev. Thomas A. Masters Sr. of the New Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church in Riviera Beach, Florida, the current mayor of Riviera Beach who was a community leader protesting efforts by the George W. Bush legal team to stop the Florida election recount following the controversial 2000 United States presidential election, and political scientist Cora Masters, who became the fourth wife of former Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry in 1994, but they later divorced.

Isabell Masters died in her sleep on September 11, 2011, at a nursing facility in Lake Worth, Florida, at the age of 98. She had lived with her son, Riviera Beach Mayor Thomas Masters, for the last four years of her life.

<text>U.S. Route 341 (US 341) is a U.S. highway entirely in the U.S. state of Georgia. It travels diagonally across southern Georgia (but is signed as north–south) from Brunswick at US 17/SR 25 to Barnesville at US 41/SR 7/SR 18. It is a spur route of US 41 and has two intersections with it: in Perry and at its northern terminus in Barnesville.

==Route description==
The following portions of US 341 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation&#x27;s economy, mobility, and defense:
*From its southern terminus in Brunswick to the US 41 intersection in Perry
*From just south-southeast of Fort Valley to just north-northwest of Fort Valley.

===Brunswick to Jesup===
US 341 begins at an intersection with US 17 and SR 25 (Glynn Avenue) in the southeast corner of the city of Brunswick, a short distance north of the Sidney Lanier Bridge. US 341 and its state route companion, SR 27, head west along 4th Street, a four-lane undivided street. The highway turns north onto Newcastle Street and passes along the edge of the Port of Brunswick. Newcastle Street becomes two lanes at 1st Avenue; US 341/SR 27 turns west onto Prince Street then north onto Bay Street, which becomes a four-lane divided highway immediately to the south of the intersection. The highway parallels Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Brunswick District north between downtown Brunswick to the east and an industrial area along the East River. At the north end of downtown, US 341 has an oblique intersection with US 25 (Newcastle Street), whose companion route is SR 25 Connector (SR 25 Conn.) and which serves as the main street of downtown Brunswick.

US 25/US 341/SR 27 continues north along Newcastle Street as a four-lane highway with center turn lane out of the city of Brunswick. The highway has a partial interchange with Norwich Street and its name changes to Norwich Street Extended. The highways cross over the paralleling rail line and have a partial interchange with Ross Road and another road that parallels the railroad. In the unincorporated community of Dock Junction, the highways intersect SR 303, which heads east as Community Road and west as Blythe Island Highway. Immediately to the south of the intersection is an acute intersection with SR 303 Conn., which serves as a cutoff between US 25/US 341/SR 27 and SR 303. The highways continue as New Jesup Highway across Yellow Bluff Creek and expand to a six-lane divided highway ahead of their partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95. US 25/US 341/SR 27 become a four-lane highway with center turn lane again, intersect CSX&#x27;s Brunswick Subdivision at grade, and intersect SR 32 and SR 99 in the hamlet of Sterling. SR 99 heads east as Grants Ferry Road; SR 32 and SR 99 head west as Harrell Highway.

US 25/US 341/SR 27 closely parallels the Norfolk Southern rail line northwest from Glynn County into Wayne County and to the city of Jesup. The three highways enter the city as Cherry Street between their crossing of Penholoway Creek and their intersection with US 301/SR 23; US 25 splits north to join US 301/SR 23 toward Ludowici. Just north of the US 301/SR 23 intersection, US 341/SR 27 turns north onto Pine Street, a four-lane street with center turn lane that curves northwest and parallels Cherry Street through the city. The highways cross over CSX&#x27;s Nahunta Subdivision between the Jesup Amtrak station and the orthogonal intersection of the CSX and Norfolk Southern lines. North of the CSX line, US 341/SR 27 intersects US 84/SR 38 (1st Street). The highways have an oblique intersection with SR 169 (Lanes Bridge Road) and collects the western end of Cherry Street as it leaves Jesup as Odum Highway. US 341/SR 27 travels through the town of Odum as its Main Street and crosses to the north side of the Norfolk Southern rail line in an S curve at the Wayne–Appling county line.

===Jesup to Hawkinsville===
US 341/SR 27 continues west as Golden Isles Parkway. The highway intersects SR 121 (Still Street) in the town of Surrency and crosses Satilla Creek. US 341/SR 27 meets US 1/SR 4/SR 15 (Main Street) in the city of Baxley, through which US 341/SR 27 follows Parker Street. US 341/SR 27 continues northwest into Jeff Davis County and the city of Hazlehurst. The two highways enter along Jarman Street and intersects and travels concurrently with US 23/US 221 Truck/SR 19/SR 135 Truck. Near the center of town, the six highways meet the northbound lanes of US 221/SR 135 (Cromartie Street). Northbound US 221/SR 135 travels concurrently with US 23/US 341/SR 19/SR 27 as they curve onto Coffee Street and have an oblique intersection with Tallahassee Street, which heads south as the southbound lanes of US 221/SR 135 and north with both directions of those highways. US 23/US 341/SR 19/SR 27 leaves town as Lumber City Highway.

The four highways cross the Ocmulgee River just west of its confluence with the Little Ocmulgee River and enter Telfair County and Lumber City as Golden Isles Highway. Within the city, SR 19 splits northeast toward Glenwood and the other three highways meet the eastern terminus of SR 117 (Main Street), then intersect at grade the Norfolk Southern rail line. US 23/US 341/SR 27 enters the city of McRae as Oak Street; east of downtown, the highways split into a one-way pair, Railroad Street northbound and Oak Street southbound. The streets intersect 3rd Avenue, which carries US 280/US 441/SR 30/SR 31, before rejoining and entering the neighboring city of Helena, where US 23/US 341/SR 27 intersects a CSX rail line.

The three highways follow McRae Highway when they enter Dodge County. The highway has a pair of intersections with SR 165, Chauncey–Dublin Highway and Chauncey–Rhine Highway, as it travels through the town of Chauncey. On the southern edge of Eastman, US 23/US 341 Bus./SR 27 Bus. (College Street) continue straight parallel to the Norfolk Southern rail line toward the center of town while US 341/SR 27 splits west to bypass the town. US 341/SR 27 intersects SR 87 and SR 117 (Rhine Highway) south of town and meets the northern terminus of US 341 Bus./SR 27 Bus. (Hawkinsville Highway) on the west side of town. US 341/SR 27 becomes Eastman Highway and crosses Mosquito Creek as it enters Pulaski County and approaches the city of Hawkinsville.

===Hawkinsville to Barnesville===
Just east of Hawkinsville, in Hartford, US 341 and SR 27 have a four-legged intersection with several highways. The south leg of the intersection is Lower River Road, which carries SR 230. The north leg of the intersection is Cochran Highway, which carries US 129 Alt./SR 26/SR 112/SR 257. The seven highways head west along Eastman Highway, whose carriageways split as they approach the Ocmulgee River. The westbound and eastbound roadways enter the city of Hawkinsville along Commerce Street and Broad Street, respectively. Immediately to the west of the river, all of the routes except SR 27 turn south from the westbound roadway onto a one-way street, which joins Broad Street as its westbound lanes. US 341 Bus. and SR 27 continue west from the turn along Commerce Street. The six-route concurrency continues to Jackson Street, where US 129 Alt. reaches its southern terminus. Jackson Street carries US 129/SR 11/SR 112 to the south and US 129 Bus./SR 11 Bus. to the north. US 129/US 341/SR 11/SR 27/SR 230/SR 257 continues west along Broad Street; SR 27 and SR 257 split southwest onto McCormick Avenue at the west end of downtown.

SR 230 continues west along Broad Street while US 129/US 341/SR 11 turns north onto an unnamed street. The three highways intersect SR 26 (Commerce Street) and intersect the northern terminus of US 129 Bus./US 341 Bus./SR 11 Bus. on the northwestern edge of the city. As the highways leave the Hawkinsville area, US 129 and its companion SR 247 split northwest onto Warner Robins Highway; US 341 and SR 11 follow Perry Highway toward Houston County. At Hayneville, the highway meets the eastern terminus of SR 224 (Larry Walker Parkway), a four-lane divided highway which leads directly to I-75, while US 341/SR 11 continues northwest toward Perry as a two-lane road. The highway crosses over a Norfolk Southern rail line at Clinchfield, then crosses Big Indian Creek and meets the southern terminus of SR 247 Spur. The two highways enter the city of Perry as Main Street. US 341/SR 11 has an acute intersection with SR 127 (Houston Lake Road), with which the highways travel concurrently for five blocks. SR 11 diverges from US 341 onto Meeting Street to join US 41 to the north; two blocks to the west, US 341/SR 127 turns north onto Ball Street and intersects US 41/SR 7 (Commerce Street); the latter route becomes US 341&#x27;s companion state highway. US 341/SR 7 becomes a four-lane divided highway, Sam Nunn Boulevard, at the convergence of Ball Street and Washington Street and meets I-75 at a diamond interchange.

Northwest of Perry, US 341/SR 7 reduces to two lanes and closely parallels a Norfolk Southern rail line into Peach County. The highways enter the city of Fort Valley as Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Just east of downtown, US 341/SR 7 turns onto Oakland Heights Parkway, which crosses over a second Norfolk Southern rail line before meeting and becoming concurrent with SR 96 at an acute intersection. The two highways diverge from SR 96 (Vineville Street) at its intersection with SR 49 (Camellia Boulevard), then intersects a third Norfolk Southern rail line. US 341/SR 7 intersects SR 49 Conn./SR 540 (Fall Line Freeway) as it leaves Fort Valley shortly before entering Crawford County. The highways enter the town of Roberta along Dugger Avenue, which meets the eastern terminus of SR 128 (Agency Street). US 341 also intersects US 80/SR 22 (Crusselle Street). At the same intersection, US 341/SR 7 becomes concurrent with SR 42, which follows US 80/SR 22 east to the adjacent community of Knoxville. US 341/SR 7 and SR 42 diverge at the hamlet of Musella. The two highways travel through the southwestern corner of Monroe County, where they meet SR 74 at a roundabout just north of the town of Culloden and SR 83 near the hamlet of Strouds. US 341/SR 7 continues northwest into Lamar County and reaches its northern terminus at a three-legged intersection with US 41 and SR 18 on the southeastern edge of Barnesville. SR 7 continues north from the intersection with US 41 and SR 18 toward the center of the city.

<doc id="903052" wikidata="Q3817767" url="?curid=903052" title="Matthew Walker knot">
<text>A Matthew Walker knot is a decorative knot that is used to keep the end of a rope from fraying. It is tied by unraveling the strands of a twisted rope, knotting the strands together, then laying up the strands together again. It may also be tied using several separate cords, in which case it keeps the cords together in a bundle. The traditional use of the knot is to form a knob or &quot;stopper&quot; to prevent the end of the rope from passing through a hole, for instance in rigging the lanyards which tension the shrouds on older sailing ships with standing rigging of fibre cordage.

It is not specifically known who Matthew Walker was, nor why this knot was named after him. However, early references from the 19th century suggest he may have been a ship&#x27;s rigger in the Royal Navy.

The following quote from &quot;The Ashley Book of Knots&quot; gives possible origins of the knot:
The FULL or DOUBLE MATTHEW WALKER KNOT.

Lever in 1808 speaks of &quot;MATTHEW WALKER&#x27;S KNOT&quot; and describes the knot which Alston in 1860 calls the &quot;DOUBLE MATTHEW WALKER KNOT.&quot; A refinement of the original knot had in the meantime taken over the original name , which is now generally modified to &quot;a MATTHEW WALKER..

Lever&#x27;s familiar expression, &quot;MATTHEW WALKER&#x27;S KNOT,&quot; suggests that he may have known the inventor, who was possibly a master rigger in one of the British naval dockyards. Many myths have grown up around Matthew Walker, &quot;the only man ever to have a knot named for him.&quot; Dr. Frederic Lucas, of the American Museum of Natural History, once told me the following story of the Origin of the knot, which he had heard off the Chincha Islands while loading guano in 1869.

A sailor, having been sentenced to death by a judge who in earlier life had been a sailor himself, was reprieved by the judge because of their common fellowship of the sea. The judge offered the sailor a full pardon if he could show him a knot that he, the judge, could neither tie nor untie.

The sailor called for ten fathoms of rope and, having retired to the privacy of his cell, unlaid the rope halfway, put in a MATTHEW WALKER KNOT, and then laid up the rope again to the end.

So Matthew Walker secured his pardon, and the world gained an excellent knot.
This knot is highly decorative, and was historically one of the most common and important knots. On a modern yacht, it is almost unused and unknown.

It has been used in making stopper knots where lariats are used.

==How to tie==

A Matthew Walker knot is tied in a circular bundle of any number of strands. To tie the knot, the tier takes each strand and forms a loop around the rest of the bundle, then passes the end through the newly formed loop to form an overhand knot. They then move to the next strand over, moving around the bundle in the direction they pass the loops. Tying the first strand around the bundle is straightforward, but each subsequent end must be passed through the previously-formed loops in order to contain all of the other strands in its loop. When tightening, it may help to roll the knot along the bundle, especially when using only two strands. The final effect is a spiral knot vaguely resembling a section of a barber&#x27;s pole.

<doc id="903053" wikidata="Q2911471" url="?curid=903053" title="Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid">
<text>Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid is a 1929 live-action/animated short film produced to sell a series of Bosko cartoons. The film was never released to theaters, and therefore not seen by a wide audience until 2000 (71 years later) on Cartoon Network&#x27;s television special &quot;Toonheads: The Lost Cartoons&quot;. The film was produced on May 29, 1929 and directed by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising.

== Plot ==
Rudolf Ising is thinking of ideas for a new character, until he draws a blackfaced person with an ink pen, who comes to life. Ising then talks to the character, and then asks his name. The new character introduces himself as Bosko. Ising tells Bosko to show what he can do. Bosko starts to tap dance, whistle, and sing. After dancing, Bosko looks directly to the screen. Bosko asks, &quot;Who&#x27;s all them folks out there in the dark?&quot; Ising tells Bosko that they are the audience, and asks him if he can make them laugh; Bosko agrees to try. Bosko asks Ising if he can draw a piano; Ising does so. Bosko starts to press some piano keys. When one of the keys near the upper end of the keyboard produces a low note, Bosko removes the key and puts it in its proper place near the left end of the keyboard. Bosko hits more random notes, then plays a glissando. Bosko laughs, and then sings &quot;Sonny Boy&quot;, accidentally sliding his tongue out. Bosko opens his hat and pulls his hair, letting his tongue out of his mouth again. He plays another song, singing, which causes his head to pop out like a slinky. After that, Bosko sings again. Ising says this is enough. He sucks Bosko, who also pulls the piano, back into his fountain pen, and then him back into the ink bottle. Bosko then pops out of the ink bottle and promises to return.

== Production ==
In 1928, when Walt Disney lost control of his &quot;Oswald The Lucky Rabbit&quot; cartoon series, producer Charles Mintz hired away several of Disney&#x27;s animators to continue producing the Oswald cartoons for Universal Studios. These animators included Hugh Harman, Rudolf Ising, Isadore &quot;Friz&quot; Freleng, Carman &quot;Max&quot; Maxwell, Norm Blackburn, Paul Smith, and Rollin &quot;Ham&quot; Hamilton. The Mintz &quot;Oswald&quot; shorts were not as successful and in 1929, Universal chose to directly produce the series, establishing its own in-house cartoon studio headed by Walter Lantz, leaving Mintz&#x27;s animators out of work.

The unemployed animators, led by Harman and Ising, decided to produce their own cartoons and made &quot;Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid&quot; as a demonstration to show to distributors, using a character the two cartoonists had created and copyrighted in 1927–28, while still working with Disney.

Rudolf Ising appeared on-screen as himself in the short and Carman Maxwell performed the voice of Bosko. Harman and Ising shopped for a distributor, but were turned down by both Paramount Pictures and Universal. Leon Schlesinger, head of Pacific Title &amp; Art Studio took an interest in Bosko and used his connections with Warner Bros. Pictures to get a distribution deal for a cartoon series that Harman and Ising later named &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, a play on the name of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; series.

The cartoon pioneered the pre-synch technique, now standard in American animation, as Harman and Ising understood the shortcomings of recording the sound after the animation in relation to dialogue. Apparently, the entire soundtrack was filmed on the spot, with Maxwell being off-camera. According to cartoon historian Mark Kausler, a camera pointed at Maxwell&#x27;s mouth to provide reference for the animation, but it was finally determined that it wasn&#x27;t necessary and that it looked &quot;too forced&quot;.

== Availability ==
&quot;Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid&quot; is available on disc 4 of the DVD set &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1&quot;, Disc 3 of the Blu-ray set &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2&quot;, and the Thunderbean Blu-Ray &quot;Technicolor Dreams and Black and White Nightmares&quot;.

== Preservation ==
The short was considered lost for many decades, with only the film&#x27;s Vitaphone soundtrack still in existence. Turner Entertainment Co. had a 35mm copy, but did not acknowledge its existence until 1999. The short was later released on the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1&quot; DVD.

<doc id="903062" wikidata="Q4816739" url="?curid=903062" title="U.S. Route 441">
<text>U.S. Route 441 (US 441) is a auxiliary route of U.S. Route 41. It extends from US 41 in Miami, Florida to US 25W in Rocky Top, Tennessee. Between its termini, US 441 travels through the states of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. The highway acts as a connector between several major urban areas, including Miami, Orlando, Ocala, Gainesville, Athens, and Knoxville. It also crosses the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where it meets the southwestern end of the Blue Ridge Parkway, and where no trucks or other commercial traffic are allowed.

==Route description==
===Florida===

US 441 begins northbound at Southwest 7th Street, which is westbound U.S. Route 41, and ends southbound on Southwest 8th Street, which is eastbound U.S. Route 41 in the eastern &quot;Little Havana&quot; neighborhood of downtown Miami (both are one-way streets). 441 runs along SW/NW 8th Ave until it crosses the Miami River; then it runs along NW 7th Ave. till the Golden Glades interchange; then it runs along NW 2nd Ave. till the Miami-Dade/Broward county line. The route parallels Interstate 95 north out of Miami to western Aventura, where I-95 heads northeast to access Fort Lauderdale and the remainder of the eastern Florida coast. However, the route soon approaches the tolled Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, which parallels US 441 north to West Palm Beach. In between, the route interchanges with the Turnpike at exit 62 via State Road 870 (Commercial Boulevard) in Tamarac. Additionally, US 441 meets Interstate 595 (Exits 8 and 8B) west of Fort Lauderdale and the tolled State Road 869 (the Sawgrass Expressway) in Coconut Creek.

At West Palm Beach, US 441 intersects U.S. Route 98 and overlaps the highway to central Palm Beach County, where the two routes split. US 441 continues west to the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee, where it turns north to follow the shoreline to Pahokee. Just north of Pahokee, US 98 rejoins US 441 and remains concurrent with US 441 along the eastern edge of the lake. North of Lake Okeechobee in Okeechobee, US 98 and US 441 split for the final time. US 441 continues north, meeting the Turnpike at Yeehaw Junction (via State Road 60) prior to intersecting U.S. Route 192 at Holopaw. US 441 turns west onto US 192, forming an overlap into Kissimmee. At the concurrent routes of U.S. Route 17/92, US 441 separates from US 192 and follows US 17 / US 92 north into downtown Orlando. In downtown, US 17 / US 92 turns east onto State Road 50 while US 441 continues north on the Orange Blossom Trail. North of downtown, US 441 crosses the tolled State Road 429 and western terminus of State Road 414 in Apopka before leaving the Orlando area.

In Leesburg, midway between Orlando and Ocala, US 441 intersects U.S. Route 27. Here, the routes come together, creating a concurrency north to the Ocala suburb of Belleview, where US 27 and US 441 intersect U.S. Route 301. US 301 turns north onto US 27 / US 441, overlapping the routes into Ocala. Immediately north of downtown, US 27 separates from US 441; US 301 then departs the route north of the city. US 441 continues to the northwest, passing across Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park, through Gainesville and interchanging with Interstate 75 (Exit 399) ahead of an intersection with US 41 in High Springs. US 441 joins US 41 north to Lake City, where the routes split south of the city. The routes remain parallel, however, past U.S. Route 90 to the northern extents of Lake City.

Past Lake City, US 441 interchanges with Interstate 10 (Exit 303), then skirts the western edge of the Okefenokee Swamp as it enters Georgia.

The section from Miami to West Palm Beach is paired with mostly-unsigned State Road 7; many locals in this area generally call US 441 as &quot;State Road 7&quot; instead of US 441. The section from Holopaw to Ocala is paired with unsigned State Road 500. From SR 121 in Gainesville to US 90 in Lake City, it is part of the &quot;DeSoto Trail&quot;.

===Georgia===
In Georgia, US 441 continues to bypass the Okefenokee Swamp to Edith, where it turns to the northwest toward the interior of the state. In Homerville, US 441 intersects U.S. Route 84, then meets and merges with U.S. Route 221 south of Pearson. The routes remain concurrent to Douglas, where US 221 and US 441 split. Farther north, US 441 intersects U.S. Route 319 south of Jacksonville. US 319 turns north onto US 441, creating an overlap north to McRae. US 319 and US 441 intersect U.S. Route 280, which joins the routes for a concurrent run through McRae. In the center of McRae, US 280, US 319 and US 441 meet the concurrent routes of U.S. Route 23 and U.S. Route 341. North of the city, US 280 splits off while US 319 and US 441 then pass Little Ocmulgee State Park before continuing concurrently to Dublin. Just south of Dublin, US 319 and US 441 interchange with Interstate 16. In Dublin, US 441 splits from US 319 onto a new bypass. On the bypass, US 441 intersects with U.S. Route 80.

North of Dublin, US 441 passes through Milledgeville prior to meeting U.S. Route 129 near Eatonton. US 129 and US 441 continue concurrently through Madison (where US 129 and US 441 interchange with Interstate 20) and U.S. Route 278 to Athens, where US 129 and US 441 turn eastward onto a limited-access beltway encircling the city. On the beltway, US 129 and US 441 run concurrent with U.S. Route 29 and, for a stretch, U.S. Route 78 to an interchange northeast of the city. Here, US 29 exits the highway while US 441 remains on the beltway for two more exits before departing.

The route proceeds north to Commerce, where it interchanges with Interstate 85 north of the city. Past Commerce, US 441 continues to Cornelia, where it intersects U.S. Route 23. US 441 merges with US 23, remaining concurrent with the route through Clayton (where US 23 and US 441 are concurrent with U.S. Route 76 for a short distance) into North Carolina. The portion of US 23 / US 441 from U.S. Route 123 west of Toccoa to the North Carolina state line is located within the Chattahoochee National Forest.

From the Florida state line to Pearson (in Echols, Clinch and Atkinson counties), Georgia State Route 89 is concurrent with US 441.

===North Carolina===
Upon crossing the state line, US 23 and US 441 enter the Nantahala National Forest. The concurrent routes head north through a pair of small communities before intersecting U.S. Route 64 in Franklin. US 23 and US 441 turn east, briefly overlapping US 64 around Franklin before separating from the route and continuing to the northeast through the forest. At Dillsboro, US 23 and US 441 intersect U.S. Route 74, here a limited-access highway. US 23 and US 441 both merge onto the freeway, becoming concurrent with US 74; however, US 23 follows US 74 east toward Asheville while US 441 utilizes US 74 west. Near Qualla, the overlap with US 74 comes to an end as US 441 departs the freeway as well as the forest.

US 441 heads north to Cherokee, a town located within the Eastern Cherokee Indian Reservation, where it briefly overlaps U.S. Route 19 through the town center. Past Cherokee, US 441 progresses north through the reservation to the southern extent of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, a dual-state park situated on the North Carolina-Tennessee border. From the park entrance to the Tennessee state line, the route follows a northwesterly alignment as it traverses the Great Smoky Mountains.

===Tennessee===

US 441 enters Tennessee at Newfound Gap. The route heads north through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to Gatlinburg, along the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway, where the route meets U.S. Route 321. US 321 joins US 441 northward through Pigeon Forge before separating north of the city. US 441 continues north to Sevierville, where it intersects with U.S. Route 411. US 441 turns west onto US 411, following the route west to Seymour. Here, US 411 heads to the southwest towards Georgia while US 441 continues northwest to Knoxville.

Immediately south of the city, US 441 junctions with State Route 33. SR 33 merges with US 441, following the U.S. route as it enters downtown Knoxville. Within downtown, US 441 interchanges with Interstate 40 and Interstate 640 before exiting the city limits. North of the city at Halls Crossroads, SR 33 breaks from US 441 and heads northeast toward New Tazewell. US 441, meanwhile, turns northwest, paralleling Interstate 75 for a distance before crossing the top of Norris Dam and finally interchanging with the freeway at exit 128 near Rocky Top. The route then terminates at an intersection with U.S. Route 25W just west of I-75 in Rocky Top.

The route is paired with unsigned State Route 71 for most of its length in Tennessee.

==History==

US 441 was one of the original 1926 US routes. Initially it ran between Orlando and Ocala, Florida. In 1935 it was extended north to High Springs, Florida, and in 1948 to Baldwin, Georgia. The following year the southern end was moved to downtown Miami. In 1952 US 441 reached its final configuration when it was extended north from Baldwin to Rocky Top, Tennessee (then known as Lake City).

In Florida, where signs for U.S. Highways formerly had different colors for each highway (until the state was forced by the federal government to conform to standards that required consistent black-and-white signs), the shield for US 441 was brown.

In 1970 signs denoting US 441 were removed from that portion of the route which runs through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, to discourage commercial vehicles (which are not allowed in the park).

==Popular culture references==
US 441 is mentioned in the song &quot;American Girl&quot;, by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. (&quot;She could hear the cars roll by/Out on 441/Like waves crashin&#x27; on the beach&quot;) Petty is from Gainesville, Florida and US 441 travels through Gainesville and is the eastern bound of the University of Florida campus. This prompted an urban legend that stated that song was based on a suicide committed on the university campus.

US 441 is also mentioned in the song &quot;Best of Me&quot; by country singer Brantley Gilbert. He sings, &quot;I remember it all too well/ Riding 441 down to Milledgeville&quot;.

US 441 is mentioned in the song titled &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot; by the country artist Corey Smith. He sings, &quot;Its time to show myself the door/ There&#x27;s no pretending anymore/ No, it&#x27;s over/ Where I&#x27;m going I don&#x27;t know/ Somewhere down this dusty road/ North on 441/ Pass the rolling cattle fields, the trailer parks, and rusted cotton mills/ Lord get me out of here.&quot; He also released a song in 2020 called &quot;Old 441&quot; about the highway.

<text>Gerd Gigerenzer (born 3 September 1947) is a German psychologist who has studied the use of bounded rationality and heuristics in decision making. Gigerenzer is director emeritus of the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, director of the Harding Center for Risk Literacy, University of Potsdam, and vice president of the European Research Council (ERC).

Gigerenzer investigates how humans make inferences about their world with limited time and knowledge. He proposes that, in an uncertain world, probability theory is not sufficient; people also use smart heuristics, that is, rules of thumb. He conceptualizes rational decisions in terms of the &quot;adaptive toolbox&quot; (the repertoire of heuristics an individual or institution has) and the ability to choose a good heuristics for the task at hand. A heuristic is called ecologically rational to the degree that it is adapted to the structure of an environment.

Gigerenzer argues that heuristics are not irrational or always second-best to optimization, as the accuracy-effort trade-off view assumes, in which heuristics are seen as short-cuts that trade less effort for less accuracy. In contrast, his and associated researchers&#x27; studies have identified situations in which &quot;less is more&quot;, that is, where heuristics make more accurate decisions with less effort. This contradicts the traditional view that more information is always better or at least can never hurt if it is free. Less-is-more effects have been shown experimentally, analytically, and by computer simulations.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Gerd Gigerenzer was born on 3 September 1947 in Wallersdorf, Germany.

=== Education ===
Gigerenzer received a Master of Arts and a Doctor of Philosophy in psychology from the University of Munich in 1974 and 1977, respectively. He received the postdoctoral degree of habilitation (full professor qualification) at the university&#x27;s department of psychology in 1982.

===Academic career===
Previously working at the University of Munich, Gigerenzer moved to the University of Konstanz in 1984 and to the University of Salzburg in 1990. From 1992 to 1995 he was Professor of Psychology at the University of Chicago and has been the John M. Olin Distinguished Visiting Professor, School of Law at the University of Virginia. In 1995 he became director of the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich, and in 1997 director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. Since 2009 he has been director of the Harding Center for Risk Literacy in Berlin, which moved in 2020 to the University of Potsdam.

===Heuristics===
Gigerenzer argues that heuristic reasoning should not lead us to conceive of human thinking as riddled with irrational cognitive biases, but rather to conceive rationality as an adaptive tool that is not identical to the rules of formal logic or of probability calculus. This is in contrast to other leading experts on cognitive heuristics such as Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. He and his collaborators have theoretically and experimentally shown that many behavioral patterns claimed to demonstrate cognitive fallacies are better understood as adaptive responses to a world of uncertainty, including the conjunction fallacy, the base rate fallacy, and overconfidence.

With Daniel Goldstein he first theorized the recognition heuristic and the take-the-best heuristic. They proved analytically conditions under which semi-ignorance (lack of recognition) can lead to better inferences than with more knowledge. These results were experimentally confirmed in many experiments, e.g., by showing that semi-ignorant people who rely on recognition are as good as or better than the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Rankings and experts at predicting the outcomes of the Wimbledon tennis tournaments. Similarly, decisions by experienced experts (e.g., police, professional burglars, airport security) were found to follow the take-the-best heuristic rather than weight and add all information, while inexperienced students tend to do the latter. 

A third class of heuristics, fast-and-frugal trees, are designed for categorization and are used for instance in emergency units to predict heart attacks or to model bail decisions made by magistrates in London courts. In such applications, the risks are not knowable and professionals hence face uncertainty. To better understand the logic of fast-and-frugal trees and other heuristics, Gigerenzer and his colleagues use the strategy of mapping their patterns into well-understood optimization theories, such as signal-detection theory. The short book &quot;Classification in the Wild&quot; (2020, MIT Press), uses examples such as how American citizens decide to vote for their president or how paramedics prioritise treatments at a medical emergency to show how to build heuristics such as fast-and-frugal trees and tallying models. The book also shows how to test and compare these simple heuristics&#x27; accuracy and transparency with state-of-the art algorithms from other fields, including machine learning.

===The adaptive toolbox===
The basic idea of the adaptive toolbox is that different domains of thought require different specialized cognitive mechanisms instead of one universal strategy. The analysis of the adaptive toolbox and its evolution is descriptive research with the goal of specifying the core cognitive capacities (such as recognition memory) and the heuristics that exploit these (such as the recognition heuristic).

===Risk communication===
Alongside his research on heuristics, Gigerenzer investigates risk communication in situations where risks can actually be calculated or precisely estimated. He has developed an ecological approach to risk communication where the key is the match between cognition and the presentation of the information in the environment. For instance, lay people as well as professionals often have problems making Bayesian inferences, typically committing what has been called the base-rate fallacy in the cognitive illusions literature. Gigerenzer and Ulrich Hoffrage were the first to develop and test a representation called &quot;natural frequencies&quot;, which helps people make Bayesian inferences correctly without any outside help. Later it was shown that with this method, even 4th graders were able to make correct inferences. Once again, the problem is not simply in the human mind, but in the representation of the information. Gigerenzer has taught risk literacy to some 1,000 doctors in their CMU and some 50 US federal judges, and &quot;natural frequencies&quot; has now entered the vocabulary of evidence-based medicine. In recent years, medical schools around the world have begun to teach tools such as natural frequencies to help young doctors understand test results.

==Intellectual background==
Intellectually, Gigerenzer&#x27;s work is rooted in Herbert Simon&#x27;s work on satisficing (as opposed to maximizing) and on ecological and evolutionary views of cognition, where adaptive function and success is central, as opposed to logical structure and consistency, although the latter can be means towards function.

Gigerenzer and colleagues write of the mid-17th century &quot;probabilistic revolution&quot;, &quot;the demise of the dream of certainty and the rise of a calculus of uncertainty – probability theory&quot;. Gigerenzer calls for a second revolution, &quot;replacing the image of an omniscient mind computing intricate probabilities and utilities with that of a bounded mind reaching into an adaptive toolbox filled with fast and frugal heuristics&quot;. These heuristics would equip humans to deal more specifically with the many situations they face in which not all alternatives and probabilities are known, and surprises can happen.

==Personal==
Gigerenzer is a jazz and Dixieland musician. He was part of The Munich Beefeaters Dixieland Band which performed in a TV ad for the VW Golf around the time it came out in 1974. The ad can be viewed on YouTube, with Gigerenzer at the steering wheel and on the banjo.

He is married to Lorraine Daston, director at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science and has one daughter, Thalia Gigerenzer.

==Awards==
Gigerenzer is recipient of the AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research for the best article in the behavioral sciences, the Association of American Publishers Prize for the best book in the social and behavioral sciences, the German Psychology Prize, and the Communicator Award of the German Research Association (DFG), among others. (See the German Wikipedia entry, , for an extensive list of honors and awards.) He is a member of the Science Council of the ERC, the 22 scientists who oversee the European Research Council, and Vice President of the ERC. The Swiss Duttweiler Institute has distinguished Gigerenzer as one of the top-100 Global Thought Leaders worldwide.

Gigerenzer was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Basel, the Open University of the Netherlands, and the University of Southampton. He is also Batten Fellow at the Darden Business School, University of Virginia, Fellow of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, International Fellow of the British Academy, and International Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

<text>Felix Borowski (March 10, 1872 – September 6, 1956) was a British/American composer and teacher. He taught composers Silvestre Revueltas and Louise Cooper Spindle at Chicago Musical College.

==Life and career==
Felix Borowski was of Polish descent but was born in the English village of Burton-in-Kendal, Westmorland. His father, who was quite a musician, was of distinguished Polish stock. His mother was English and very accomplished in music. His father gave him his first instruction on the piano as well as on the violin . He was educated in London and at the Cologne Conservatory. He then taught the piano and the violin for a while in Aberdeen, Scotland. At this time Borowski had begun to publish smaller compositions for piano and violin. Somewhat later his compositions won strong commendation from composers such as Edvard Grieg, Theodor Leschetizky, Sauer and other renowned masters.

In 1896, Borowski moved to the USA to become Director of the Chicago Musical College. One of his pupils at the school was Gena Branscombe. His connection with this musical college continued until 1925 when he resigned to devote himself to private teaching and to composition. During his working life in the U.S.A. he was a composer, teacher, and newspaper critic in Chicago. He was the programme annotator for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1908-1956, and the CSO holds a collection of his original compositions as well as arrangements by him of the works of others. In 1917, he was elected as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity.

==Compositions==
One of his compositions for piano and violin (&#x27;Adoration&#x27;) was recorded on Edison Blue Amberol in 1914 (#2475) by Richard Czerwonky (1886-1949), also an American musician of Polish descent, being an outstanding violin-player and orchestra conductor at his time. Borowski wrote three large-scale and romantic Sonatas for the organ (published 1904, 1906 and 1924), and his compositions for orchestra include a poem &quot;Semiramis&quot; and 3 symphonies (c.1932, c.1933, c.1938). Borowski&#x27;s late-romantic Piano Concerto in D minor was composed in 1913.

<text>U.S. Route 641 (US 641) is a U.S. Route in Tennessee and Kentucky. It runs for from US 64 south of Clifton, Tennessee to an intersection with US 60 in Marion, Kentucky. While it is considered a spur route of U.S. Route 41, the two routes no longer connect.

==Route description==

===Tennessee===
US 641 begins at an intersection with US 64 south of Clifton. North of that city, it runs concurrently with SR 69. US 641 intersects US 412 in Parsons, I-40 near Holladay, and US 70 in Camden. In Paris, US 641 intersects US 79; it also separates from SR 69 and begins a concurrency with SR 54 that it maintains until the Kentucky state line.

===Kentucky===

US 641 enters Kentucky at Hazel and continues north to Murray, intersecting KY 80 just north of the city limit. Near Benton, a spur route (Spur US 641) provides access to I-69 (the Purchase Parkway) while the main route travels through the city. US 641 has a concurrency with US 62 beginning near Calvert City; the routes cross I-24 / I-69 before separating in Eddyville. The route intersects KY 70 in Fredonia. The US 641 designation ends at US 60 in Marion.

==History==
U.S. Route 641 was designated by AASHO in 1951 out of a desire on the part of Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee highway officials to create a single numbered route to connect Memphis, Tennessee to Evansville, Indiana via the popular tourist attraction Kentucky Dam. In 1968, the 4.9-mile Indiana portion of its route was relinquished. Indiana highway officials, in their request to decommission the route, advised that 641 &quot;serves no useful purpose&quot; and had, indeed, not been marked in Evansville for &quot;a number of years.&quot;

Its northern section from Marion to Henderson, Kentucky, which was concurrent with U.S. Route 60, was eliminated and its northern terminus has since remained Marion. In 1977, US 641 was extended southward along the path of Tennessee State Route 69 to its interchange with I-40 (Exit 126) near Holladay, Tennessee with SR 69 continuing south beyond the interchange.

In November 2014, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved a southern extension of the US 641 designation along SR 69 and SR 114, from the former southern terminus at I-40 to the current end at US 64 in Wayne County.
==Major intersections==
The mileposts listed in the following table is only an estimated calculation. Actual mile markers may vary.



























==Special routes==
Two special routes of U.S. Route 641 currently exist, and a third has existed in the past, all of which have been in Kentucky.

===Murray business loop===

US Route 641 Business is a business route of US Route 641 located mainly along the east side of Murray, Kentucky, in Calloway County. It follows Kentucky Route 121 east from US 641 along Glendale Road until KY 121 turns south along South Fourth Street, where US BUS 641 turns north. The route makes a sharp left turn at Chestnut Street and heads west before finally terminating at US 641.


===Benton spur route===
US Route 641 Spur is a spur route of US Route 641 located on the south side of Benton, Kentucky, in Marshall County in western Kentucky&#x27;s Jackson Purchase region. It begins at a junction with US 641 south of Benton, and ends at the Exit 41 interchange with Interstate 69 (formerly the Julian M. Carroll Purchase Parkway).

<doc id="903072" wikidata="Q1330205" url="?curid=903072" title="Paperboy (video game)">
<text>Paperboy is an action game developed and published by Atari Games and released as an arcade video game in 1985. The player takes the role of a paperboy who delivers a fictional newspaper called &quot;The Daily Sun&quot; along a street on his bicycle. The arcade version of the game featured bike handlebars as the controller.

The game was ported to many home systems beginning in 1986. A sequel for home computers and consoles, &quot;Paperboy 2&quot;, was released in 1991.

==Gameplay==

The player assumes the role of a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street, which is displayed in an oblique projection view. Controls consist of a set of handlebars that can be turned/tilted to steer and control speed, with mounted buttons that can be pressed to throw papers. 

At the start of the game, the player is offered a choice of three difficulty settings: Easy Street, Middle Road, and Hard Way. The latter two options double or triple all point values, respectively. The street consists of 20 houses, 10 of which are initially decorated in bright colors to mark them as subscribers.

The primary goal is to deliver papers to subscribers by throwing them either onto the front porch or into the mailbox, while avoiding obstacles such as cars, skateboarders, and rolling tires. Bonus points are awarded for damaging non-subscribers&#x27; houses (breaking windows, knocking over tombstones, etc.) and hitting certain obstacles with papers. The player has a limited supply of papers and must pick up bundles lying on the ground in order to restock. After completing the route, the player moves onto a training course and can earn points for hitting targets and using ramps to jump over walls/ditches/holes, with an unlimited supply of papers. Crashing into any obstacle on the route costs the player one life, while doing so on the training course ends it immediately without penalty.

After the training course, the player earns bonus points for each successful delivery and advances to the next level. Any subscribers who did not receive a paper or who suffered damage to their houses will cancel their subscriptions, while making all deliveries will add one subscriber to the route, to a maximum of 10. 

The game consists of seven levels, each corresponding to a different day from Monday through Sunday. Papers on the Sunday level are heavier than on earlier days and thus travel more slowly when thrown. The game ends once all lives are exhausted, all subscriptions are canceled, or the player completes the Sunday training course, whichever comes first. In the last case, the player earns a bonus for any remaining lives.

==Development==
The cabinet is a standard upright but with custom controls. The controls consist of a bicycle handlebar (a modified &quot;Star Wars&quot; yoke) with one button on each side, used to throw papers. The handlebars can be pushed forward to accelerate and pulled back to brake.

The game runs on the Atari System 2 hardware. The CPU is a 10 MHz Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) T-11. For sound and coin inputs, it uses a 2.2 MHz MOS Technology 6502. The sound chips are two POKEYs for digital sound, a Yamaha YM2151 for music and a Texas Instruments TMS5220 for speech. The protection chip is a Slapstic model 137412-105.

The game program code for the arcade version was written in BLISS.

==Ports==
Elite Systems produced a version for the ZX Spectrum which was released in the United Kingdom in September 1986, and went on to release versions for the Commodore 64, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 16 and Commodore Plus/4 over the following months.

In the United States, a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version was developed by Eastridge Technology and published by Mindscape in December 1988. Coverage of the NES version abruptly began at the Summer CES 1988 as a last-minute replacement for a port of the computer title &quot;Bad Street Brawler&quot;, which was about to be ported to the NES. In October 1989, Elite released versions for the Atari ST and MS-DOS in the United Kingdom, followed by an Amiga version later that month.

In the United Kingdom, a Game Boy version by Mindscape was released in October or November 1990. A Master System version, by Sega and U.S. Gold, was released in the United Kingdom in November 1990. Atari released a version of &quot;Paperboy&quot; for the Atari Lynx in 1990. By March 1991, an NES version by Mindscape had been released in the United Kingdom.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Paperboy&quot; on their November 1, 1985 issue as being the fifth most-successful upright arcade unit of the month. In the United States, it was the top-grossing arcade software conversion kit in December 1985.

Upon its debut at London&#x27;s Amusement Trades Exhibition International (ATEI) show in early 1985, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine gave the arcade game a mixed review, praising the controls but criticizing the difficulty. The arcade game was runner-up for &quot;Computer Gamer&quot; magazine&#x27;s best coin-op game award, which was won by Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Commando&quot;. In 2007, Spanner Spencer of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; rated the arcade version 9 out of 10 and praised its gameplay, graphics, and music.

The ZX Spectrum port topped the UK monthly sales chart in September 1986, and the release of the Commodore 64 version took the game to the number one position again in November. It went on to become the seventh best-selling video game of 1986 in the UK.

&quot;Advanced Computer Entertainment&quot; (&quot;ACE&quot;) offered praise for the Atari ST version, awarding it a score of 850 out of 1,000, while &quot;Zero&quot; gave it a score of 86 out of 100. &quot;ACE&quot; and &quot;Zero&quot; noted that the Atari ST version looked and played like the arcade version. &quot;Computer Gamer&quot; gave the ZX Spectrum version a rating of 16 out of 20, considering it to be a faithful conversion of the arcade game, while noting that some people may find the gameplay to be repetitive. For the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC versions, &quot;ACE&quot; gave the game a rating of 5 out of 5, noting the &quot;extremely well executed&quot; graphics and referring to the game as a &quot;budget classic.&quot; UK magazine &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; (&quot;CVG&quot;) gave the Commodore 64 version a 52 percent rating, criticizing its music and &quot;blocky and ill-proportioned&quot; sprites; the magazine gave the ZX Spectrum version an 83 percent rating. Ken McMahon of &quot;Commodore User&quot; reviewed the Commodore 16 and Commodore Plus/4 version and rated it 6 out of 10, noting that it was too easy.

&quot;Crash&quot; gave the ZX Spectrum version an 88% rating with the general rating &quot;Another slick, playable conversion from Elite&quot;, while Zzap!64 was less enthusiastic for the Commodore 64 version giving it 44%. In 1993, &quot;Zzap!64&quot; rated the Commodore 64 version a 60 percent score, calling it repetitive. Richard Leadbetter of &quot;CVG&quot; reviewed the Lynx version and stated, &quot;Looks good, but simply isn&#x27;t enough fun to play.&quot; &quot;STart&quot;″s Clayton Walnum similarly praised the Lynx version&#x27;s graphics and sound effects but deemed the game &quot;just another shoot-em-up without the shooting.&quot; &quot;Raze&quot; offered praise for the clear and colorful graphics of the Lynx version, but stated that the game &quot;is too old and tired for the exciting and new Lynx.&quot; AllGame&#x27;s Kyle Knight criticized the Lynx version for its simple sound effects and music, as well as its repetitive gameplay.

Leadbetter praised the Master System version, calling it &quot;one of the best arcade conversions&quot; available for the system, while noting that the game&#x27;s only &quot;slight downer&quot; was the music. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; praised the Master System version for its graphics and similarities to the arcade game, while &quot;Raze&quot; wrote a mixed review for the Master System version. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; was critical of the NES version for its graphics, sound, and controls, and concluded that it was, &quot;A highly offensive product which weighs in as a sadly derisive conversion of a classic coin-op.&quot; Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame stated that Mindscape did a good job of porting the game to the NES. Weiss praised the controls and sound effects of the NES version, but criticized the music. &quot;Raze&quot; considered the Game Boy version to be &quot;Excellent&quot;, while &quot;Mean Machines&quot; criticized its controls, blurry scrolling, and the lack of colorful graphics, which could not be produced by the system. &quot;ACE&quot; noted slightly difficult controls and poor sound effects for the Game Boy version. Polish magazine &quot;Top Secret&quot; gave the Genesis version 5 out of 5 checks, praising the graphics, animation, and music, thus favoring the port over the other contemporary versions.

&quot;The One&quot; gave the Amiga version 80% stating that &quot;it&#x27;s an almost flawless conversion&quot; of the arcade game. &quot;ACE&quot; gave the Amiga version a rating of 878, calling it a perfect conversion of the arcade game. Tony Dillon of &quot;Commodore User&quot; gave the Amiga version an 83 percent rating and considered it to be nearly identical to the arcade version. Gordon Houghton of &quot;CVG&quot; gave the Amiga version a 69 percent rating, stating that the sound was &quot;arguably better&quot; than the arcade version, but noting that the graphics were &quot;jerky&quot; and that the gameplay had been altered from the arcade version. Houghton concluded that it was &quot;not a bad game, but it&#x27;s too old and too expensive to deserve greater praise.&quot; &quot;Compute!&quot; praised the music and graphics of the Amiga version, but considered the gameplay to be outdated and repetitive. Robert A. Jung of IGN reviewed the Lynx version in 1999, and considered it to be a &quot;decent&quot; adaptation of the arcade game. Jung noted the game&#x27;s &quot;average-quality&quot; graphics and sound, and concluded, &quot;Not a bad game, though not one of the Lynx&#x27;s best.&quot;

IGN&#x27;s Craig Harris reviewed a Game Boy Color version and stated that it &quot;is definitely the worst rendition of the game, even beating out the Atari Lynx&#x27;s waterdown port of the arcade game.&quot; Harris criticized the game&#x27;s music, the lack of speech audio from the original game, poor collision detection, and a lack of fun. Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame praised the Game Boy Color version for its colorful graphics, but noted that the game did not introduce any new changes from the original arcade version, writing, &quot;Those expecting a lot of changes or additions will be disappointed.&quot;

===Later releases===

Versions of &quot;Paperboy&quot; were released for the Nintendo 64, Xbox 360 and iPhone and iPod Touch. Dean Austin of IGN criticized the retro 3D look of the Nintendo 64 version, but praised the gameplay and considered it to be a &quot;great game.&quot; Daniel Erickson of &quot;Daily Radar&quot; criticized the &quot;bland&quot; and &quot;repetitive&quot; gameplay of the Nintendo 64 version. Robert Amsbury of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; praised the sound effects in the Nintendo 64 version, but considered the music to be repetitive, while noting that the game &quot;isn&#x27;t really all that fun.&quot; Weiss criticized the Nintendo 64 version for its music and sound effects, as well as poor controls, and wrote that the game had &quot;some of the ugliest graphics you&#x27;ll find in a Nintendo 64 cartridge.&quot; Ben Stahl of GameSpot noted the outdated sound effects used in the Nintendo 64 version, and stated, &quot;While a decent game on its own, Paper Boy 64 doesn&#x27;t capture the magic of the original arcade game.&quot; IGN&#x27;s Levi Buchanan, reviewing a cell phone version, praised the controls and stated that the game looked and played like the original arcade game.

According to Metacritic, the Xbox 360 version received &quot;Mixed or average reviews.&quot; &quot;TeamXbox&quot; gave the Xbox 360 version an overall score of 8.2, stating that &quot;Paperboy &quot;delivers&quot; as advertised in the classifieds.&quot; Greg Sewart of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; considered the Xbox 360 version to be an &quot;authentic recreation&quot; of the arcade version, but noted that the game, like previous versions, suffers from imprecise controls due to the absence of the arcade game&#x27;s handlebar controller. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot reviewed the Xbox 360 release and was disappointed by the lack of new sound effects and music, as well as the lack of graphical updates. Gerstmann stated that the game would most likely appeal to people who &quot;have fond memories&quot; of the original arcade game. IGN&#x27;s Erik Brudvig, reviewing the Xbox 360 version, considered the game to be a limited amount of fun. Brudvig noted the lack of a handlebar controller and stated that, &quot;Thanks to the isometric view, this version of Paperboy suffers from the same wonky controls that every home version of the game has.&quot; Kristan Reed of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; praised the Xbox 360 release for its controls and noted that the game &quot;stands up pretty well&quot; despite its age, although he stated that the game quickly becomes repetitive. Corey Cohen of &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; praised the Xbox 360 version for its music and controls, and noted that it was as appealing as the arcade version.

Tarryn van der Byl of &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; criticized the iPhone version for its poor controls, and stated that the game&#x27;s optional 3D graphics mode was &quot;ugly and feels clumsy and inaccurate.&quot; Slide to Play considered the iPhone/iPod version a &quot;mixed bag&quot;, but praised the gameplay. Mark Langshaw of Digital Spy reviewed the iPhone version and stated that it would likely appeal most to fans of the original game. Langshaw concluded, &quot;As far as nostalgic remakes go, Paperboy delivers but doesn&#x27;t quite do enough to make the front page.&quot;

According to Metacritic, &quot;Paperboy: Special Delivery&quot; has a score of 55 out of 100, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews.&quot; Blake Patterson of &quot;TouchArcade&quot; considered &quot;Paperboy: Special Delivery&quot; to be an improvement over Elite&#x27;s iPhone version, praising the improved controls and graphics. Jon Mundy of &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; rated the game 5 out of 10, criticizing the gameplay and controls, and writing that the biggest flaw &quot;is the game&#x27;s technical shortcomings. The graphics are extremely basic and yet the game paused and stuttered repeatedly on my second-generation iPod touch.&quot; Andrew Nesvadba of AppSpy rated the game 3 out of 5, praising the updated graphics while criticizing the controls. Nesvadba also praised the addition of a story mode, but criticized its short length. Jeremiah Leif Johnson of Gamezebo gave the game three stars out of five, praising the story mode and the 1980s-style graphics, but criticizing the poor controls.

==Legacy==
A sequel, &quot;Paperboy 2&quot;, was released in 1991 for several home systems.

&quot;Paperboy&quot;, in its original arcade form, is included in the 1998 PlayStation video game &quot;Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2&quot;. The Game Boy Color version, developed by Digital Eclipse Software and published by Midway, was released in the United States on May 30, 1999. By July 1997, developer High Voltage Software had begun conceptual development of the Nintendo 64 version and was searching for a game publisher, with a possible release in 1998. In August 1998, Midway announced that it would be publishing the Nintendo 64 game, which was still in conceptual stages and was expected for release in late 1999. The game was developed using a 3D polygonal game engine, and was released in North America on November 4, 1999.

In May 2000, Midway announced plans to release &quot;Paperboy&quot; for the PlayStation later that year, although the game was never released. &quot;Paperboy&quot; was later included in the 2003 video game &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;, a compilation of arcade games for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows. In 2005, &quot;Paperboy&quot; was included in the compilation &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. In May 2005, Sega Mobile announced that it would release &quot;Paperboy&quot; for mobile phones. The game was released in May 2006. The Xbox 360 version of &quot;Paperboy&quot; was released on February 14, 2007, on Xbox Live Arcade; however, the game was removed by 2010.

The iPhone/iPod Touch version was released through the App Store on December 18, 2009. The game was developed by Vivid Games and published by Elite Systems. Elite removed the game from the App Store in March 2010, because of a licensing conflict. Glu Mobile developed and published a new iPhone/iPod Touch version, titled &quot;Paperboy: Special Delivery&quot;, on November 4, 2010. The game included a 20-level story mode in which the paperboy is saving money from his job to buy a new game console, but he later falls in love and throws roses instead of newspapers. The game also featured an optional tilt-based control mode in which the iPhone is tilted to control the paperboy.

A port of &quot;Paperboy&quot; can be accessed in the 2015 video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; by using the Arcade Dock in the level &quot;Painting the Town Black&quot;. It is also an included title on the Midway Legacy Edition Arcade1Up cabinet.

===In other media===
*In the early development stages of &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;, the game&#x27;s titular protagonist was intended to be that series&#x27; protagonist and would initially be titled &quot;Buddy Boy&quot;. While the idea was dropped, elements from &quot;Paperboy&quot; were used in the Season 2 episode, &quot;The Invasion of the Paper Pedalers&quot;, where the character lived on &quot;News World&quot; and was named Julio. 
*The game&#x27;s titular protagonist made cameo appearances in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; and 2015&#x27;s &quot;Pixels&quot;.

<text>The Great Serpent Mound is a 1,348-feet-long (411 m), three-feet-high prehistoric effigy mound located in Peebles, Ohio. It was built on what is known as the Serpent Mound crater plateau, running along the Ohio Brush Creek in Adams County, Ohio. The mound is the largest serpent effigy known in the world.

The first published surveys of the mound were by Ephraim G. Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis, featured in their historic volume, &quot;Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley&quot; (1848), that was commissioned by the Smithsonian Institution.

The United States Department of Interior designated the mound as a National Historic Landmark in 1966. The mound is maintained through the Ohio History Connection, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving historical sites throughout Ohio.

== Description ==

Effigy mounds have been constructed independently by several cultures. The significance of Serpent Mound is based on its size and historical relevance. Made up of three parts, Serpent Mound extends over 1,376 feet (419 m) in length, varying from 9&quot; to more than 3&#x27; (30–100 cm) in height. The mound stands with a width varying between 20 and 25 feet based on the section. Serpent Mound conforms to the surrounding land, as it was built on a bluff above the Ohio Brush Creek. The mound winds back and forth for more than eight hundred feet, with its tail coiling in seven areas throughout the mound. The mound features a triple-coiled tail at the end of the structure, often viewed as a benchmark of the mound. Yellowish clay and ash make up the main constituents of the mound, with a layer of rocks and soil reinforcing the outer layer. 

The generally accepted interpretation of the structure is that of an open-mouth head of a serpent nearly engulfs a hollow oval feature that faces the east and is 120-feet (37 m)-long. This oval feature may represent an egg, with an apparent depiction of the snake consuming it, however, many anthropologists believe that the oval is a representation of the Sun, or the body of a frog. Other scholars think it is the remnant of a platform mound. The western side of the effigy features a triangular mound approximately 31.6 feet (9.6 m) at its base and long axis, reminiscent of other existing serpent effigies in Canada and Scotland.

== Origin and chronology ==
Throughout the twentieth century, anthropologists and archaeologists had disputed which culture and people had created the Serpent Mound, as may be seen in a overview published by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2002.
The Ancient Earthworks Project published &quot;New Radiocarbon Dates Suggest Serpent Mound is More Than 2,000 Years Old&quot; (July 2014). The article provided evidence supporting attribution of the mound to the Adena peoples around 300 BCE (2300 years ago) and refers to radiocarbon data that was published later in an October 2014 article in &quot;The Journal of Archaeological Science&quot;. These scholars also conclude that the mound was renovated around 1400 CE by Fort Ancient peoples.

In 2019, Monaghan and Hermann published additional research in an article in &quot;The Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology&quot; that supports their earlier conclusions. They corroborated the 2014 research and refined the radiocarbon dates. Monaghan and Hermann determined that the mound was built around 2,100–2,300 years ago (300-100 BCE) during the Adena period and that it was subsequently rebuilt (or repaired) about 900 years ago (1100 CE) during the Fort Ancient period. They provided a reconciliation of the radiocarbon dating differences among samples. 

In 2018, archaeologist Brad Lepper published a response questioning the attribution of construction to the Adena culture.
Lepper et al. pointed out that the dates obtained by Herrmann and Romain are of poor quality. The material the team dated is not charcoal, but “organic sediment” (Herrman et al 2014:119). Moreover, the samples were obtained from soil cores and not an exposed stratigraphic profile, so the resulting dates are known to be problematic. Henriksen et al (2019) have demonstrated that such dates can be as much as 3,000 years older than the actual age of a mound. Moreover, the Adena culture is not known to have built effigy mounds or to have used serpent symbolism in their art, whereas the Fort Ancient culture built the Ohio Alligator Mound and frequently depicted serpents in their art. These assessments conclude that the best available data indicate that Serpent Mound was built by the Fort Ancient culture.

The Serpent Mound at Rice Lake in Peterborough County, Ontario, Canada, has been dated to more than 2,000 years old. It has also been linked to the Adena culture. It is a Middle Woodland Hopewell burial mound in a zigzag shape that may or may not have been intended to depict a serpent (Oberholtzer 2013:163).

== Prehistory of Ohio ==

Several groups of Paleo-Indians (13000 BCE–7000 BCE) occupied the subject land in Ohio prior to the development of the Adena and Hopewell cultures. Evidence shows that numerous groups of Paleo-Indians occupied the land in Ohio and ranged throughout the territory. They were hunter-gatherers who traveled seasonally for game. The Paleo-Indians hunted large game such as mastodon. Archaeologists have found remains of more than 150 mastodons in Ohio, as well as the remains of other large game. The most complete mastodon skeleton was excavated at the Burning Tree Mastodon site.

Clovis point spear heads have been found that indicate interaction with other groups of Paleo-Indians who also hunted large game.

The Paleo Crossing site and Nobles Pond site tools, such as spear-throwers, were more sophisticated. Base camps were established for winter lodging. The Glacial Kame culture, a late Archaic group, traded for sea shell and copper with other groups. These materials were used for objects that were a sign of prestige within the group and were carried by respected healers and hunters. The objects were buried with their owners.

Following the ancient Paleo-Indians, the Woodland Period (800 BCE–1200 CE) of the Post-Archaic Period is known for its rich ritual and artistic life and well-developed villages. The Woodland Period is well known as a period in which cultures built earthworks and mounds. They are believed to have been related to religious practices, as some mounds were used for burials. Along with hunting and gathering, cultures of this period began to cultivate crops such as maize, squash, and beans. The Adena and Hopewell cultures flourished during the Early and Middle Woodland periods, and the addition of crops enabled the population of the Woodland people to expand dramatically. Several groups of the Woodland people lived in larger villages, surrounded by defensive walls or ditches. Ceremonial and artistic endeavors waned during the Late Woodland period, as did trading with other groups. Many of the earthworks and effigy mounds were built early in this period. Later, the cultures did not build new mounds.

During the late prehistoric period (900 CE–1650 CE), the villages of such cultures as the Adena and the Fort Ancient peoples were much larger. These villages were often built on higher ground near a river, commonly surrounded by a wooden stockade. After a long hiatus, some cultures had begun to build earthworks and effigy mounds, but not so frequently as during the Woodland period.

== Cultures of the Midwest ==

=== Adena culture ===

The Adena culture consisted of the pre-contact Native Americans who lived throughout the midwest in the areas that would become the states of Kentucky, Indiana, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and most predominantly, Ohio. The majority of these peoples inhabited the Scioto River and Hocking valleys in southern Ohio, as well as the Kanawha Valley near present-day Charleston, West Virginia. This period is often referred to as The Early Woodland Period, ranging between 800 BCE and 1 CE. The name “Adena” refers to the shared culture of the peoples rather than to a singular group or tribe.

Researchers adopted the name &quot;Adena&quot; from the Ross County estate of Ohio Governor Thomas Worthington, about one and a half miles northwest of Chillicothe, Ohio. Worthington referred to the community as “Adena”, which Worthington’s diary claims comes from a Hebrew name that “was given to places for the delightfulness of their situations”. An ancient burial mound, standing 26 feet tall, had been located at his estate and was known as &quot;The Adena Mound&quot;. It was destroyed for agricultural development.

Archaeologists attribute the mounds to the Adena culture as a whole, although are unsure of the specific tribes who inhabited the land. The term &quot;culture&quot; encompasses similarities in artifact style, architecture, and other cultural practices, allowing archaeologists to distinguish the Adena culture from other cultures in the region at different time periods. The Adena Mound site became the &quot;type site&quot; of the regional culture that is used by anthropologists.

Like other peoples of the Woodland period, the Adena culture were hunter-gatherers. The women also domesticated and cultivated various crops such as squash, sunflower, sumpweed, goosefoot, knotweed, maygrass, and tobacco. They often lived in small villages with surrounding gardens, but moved frequently to follow various animal herds while planting and feeding on various types of nuts, fruits, and roots along the way. The Adena people are also known for their production of clay pottery, having been one of the first of cultures to bring it to Ohio. Observed through remains found at the type site, archaeologists characterize the Adena&#x27;s clay pottery through its large, thick-walled vessels, resembling a modern-day bowl. Archaeologists believe that this clay pottery was used to cook ground seeds into an oatmeal-like substance.

The Adena were known for their burial practices. They buried their dead in prominent mounds throughout the midwest. Many archaeologists believe that these structures served as territorial markers for the Adena people. Often the mounds were accompanied by small circular earthen enclosures that many archaeologists believe were once used for rituals. The Miamisburg Mound in Montgomery County, Ohio, is home to the largest Adena burial mound in the state. Mounds such as this hosted multiple burials, characterized by the rituals performed and the funerary objects worn such as bracelets, ear spools, gorgets, and other ornaments. Larger ornaments such as bones and stone tools were often worn around the neck. The deceased individual was either cremated or placed on their back in timber-lined tombs.

By 1 CE, the Adena culture began to decline and their civilizations began to evolve into what is known as The Hopewell culture. Numerous Adena groups began to build larger earthworks and effigy mounds and expanded their efforts to acquire exotic raw materials such as copper and mica through trade. Many people of The Hopewell culture continued to follow the old ways of the Adena people. In some regions, including Southwestern Ohio, the Adena way of life persisted well into the first century CE through the efforts of these people.

=== Fort Ancient Culture ===
The Fort Ancient Culture refers to the Native American Cultures who predominantly inhabited land near the Ohio River valley in a culture that flourished from 1000 CE to 1750 CE. These civilizations flourished in the modern-day regions of southern Ohio, northern Kentucky, southeastern Indiana, and western West Virginia. The Fort Ancient tribes are often referred to as a &quot;sister culture&quot; of the Mississippian culture, although they can be distinguished from that culture through the time period in which they thrived and their many cultural differences. Along with their relation to the Mississippian culture, evidence suggests that the Fort Ancient Culture were not the direct descendants of the Hopewellian Culture. Despite what many believe, the tribes of the Fort Ancient Culture were not responsible for the creation of The Great Serpent Mound, although they contributed to its physical appearance through maintenance of it around 200 CE.

The name of the culture originates from the Fort Ancient archeological site. However, the Fort Ancient Site is now thought to have been built by Ohio Hopewellian people, but having been occupied later by the succeeding Fort Ancient culture. The site is located on a hill above the Little Miami River, close to Lebanon, Ohio. Despite its name, most archaeologists do not believe that Fort Ancient was used primarily as a fortress by either the Ohio Hopewell culture or the Fort Ancient Culture. Archaeologists believe that it was more likely used as a ceremonial location.
In 1996, the team of Robert V. Fletcher and Terry L. Cameron (under the supervision of the Ohio Historical Society&#x27;s Bradley T. Lepper) reopened a trench created by Frederic Ward Putnam of Harvard more than 100 years before. They found a few pieces of charcoal in what they believed to be an undisturbed portion of the Serpent Mound. Natural changes called bioturbation, including burrows, frost cracks, etc., can reverse the structural timeline of an earthen mound such as Serpent Mound, however, and bioturbation can shift carbon left by a later culture on the surface to areas deep within the structure, making the earthwork appear younger. This factor may be significant to the dating of the original construction of the mound. 

When the team conducted carbon dating studies on the charcoal pieces, two yielded a date of ca. 1070 CE, with the third piece dating to the Late Archaic period some two thousand years earlier, specifically 2920+/-65 years BP (before the present). The third date, ca. 2900 BP, was recovered from a core sample below the cultural modification level. The first two dates place the Serpent Mound within the realm of the Fort Ancient culture. The third dates the mound back to very early Adena culture or before.

Another effigy mound found in Ohio, the Alligator Effigy Mound in Granville, was carbon dated to the Fort Ancient period.

== Interpretations ==

Having been built around 1070 CE, many archaeologists believe that the mound&#x27;s creation could have been influenced by two different astronomical events. The primary theory is that the light from a supernova may have prompted its construction. Although numerous supernovas may have occurred over the centuries that span the possible construction dates of the effigy, the one that created the Crab Nebula occurred in the year 1054 CE. The light of the supernova would have been visible for two weeks after it first reached earth and it was visible in broad daylight. As a secondary theory, some archaeologists suggest and the appearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet in 1066 CE could have been the influence and that the tail of Halley&#x27;s Comet could have influenced the shape of the mound; however, the tail of the comet has always appeared as a long, straight line that does not resemble the curves of the Serpent Mound. 

The mound is located on the site of a classic astrobleme, an ancient meteorite impact structure. When attempting to understand the impact origin of this structure, the pattern of disruption of sedimentary strata has provided archaeologists with a lot of information. In the center of the structure, strata have been uplifted several hundred feet, resembling the central uplifts of the Copernicus lunar crater. In 2003, geologists from Ohio State University and the University of Glasgow (Scotland) corroborated the meteorite impact origin of the structure at The Serpent Mound. They had previously studied core samples collected at the site in the 1970s, providing them with a background of information pertaining to the site. Further analyses of the rock core samples indicated that the impact occurred during the Permian Period, about 248 to 286 million years ago. This has led archaeologists to believe that the topographic expression of this impact or the impact crater, has been completely erased by erosion.

In 1987, Clark and Marjorie Hardman published their finding that the oval-to-head area of the serpent is aligned to the summer solstice sunset. A depiction of the serpent mound appeared in &quot;The Century&quot; periodical in April 1890, drawn by William Jacob Baer.

According to archaeologist Brad Lepper, Serpent Mound may be a depiction of a Dhegihan Siouan origin story of the Great Serpent &quot;Toothy Mouth”, lord of the Beneath World, who impregnated the First Woman.

According to Woodward and McDonald&#x27;s interpretation:
== Preservation ==

&quot;Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley&quot; fascinated many across the country, including Frederic Ward Putnam of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. Putnam spent much of his career lecturing and publishing on the Ohio mounds, specifically the Serpent Mound. When he visited the Midwest in 1885, he found that plowing and development were destroying many of the mounds, removing significant history of these cultures and their burial sites. In 1886, with help from a group of wealthy women in Boston, such as the patroness of The Glass Flowers, Mary Lee Ware, Putnam raised funds to purchase 60 acres (240,000 m2) at the site of The Serpent Mound in hopes to ensure its preservation. Along with The Serpent Mound, the purchase also contained three conical mounds, a village site, and a burial place. The Serpent Mound is now listed as a &quot;Great Wonder of the Ancient World&quot; by &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot;.

The mound was originally purchased on behalf of the Trustees of the Peabody Museum. In 1900, the land and its ownership were granted to the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society (a predecessor of the present Ohio Historical Society). The Ohio Historical Society designated the Arc of Appalachia Preserves system, a project of Highlands Sanctuary, Inc., as the managing agency of Serpent Mound from 2010 until March 2021. In March 2021, The Ohio History Connection took back active management of the site. Following an instance of vandalism in 2015, more security cameras and protective gates were added to ensure the protection of the site and surrounding area.

=== Excavation ===
During excavation of The Serpent Mound archaeologists uncovered pipes, points, and earspools from the Hopewell culture as well as Gorgets and points from the Adena culture.

After raising sufficient funds, Putnam returned to the same site in 1886. He worked for four years to excavate the burial sequence contents of both The Serpent Mound and two nearby conical mounds. After completing his excavation and publishing his work, Putnam worked on restoring the mounds to their original state.

One of the conical mounds that was excavated by Putnam in 1890 yielded several artifacts of a principal burial during the period of the Adena people. Along with these findings, Putnam found and excavated nine intrusive burials in the mound through his discovery of an ash bed containing many prehistoric artifacts, north of the conical mound. After the excavation, the conical mound was reconstructed and currently stands just north of the parking lot at The Serpent Mound State Memorial.

In 2011, archaeologists took the opportunity to excavate the property prior to installation of utility lines at The Serpent Mound State Memorial. The excavations focused on three sides of the conical mound that had been excavated previously by Putnam in 1890. In addition to these concentrations of artifacts, an ashy soil horizon was excavated north of the conical mound, where archaeologists were able to uncover many prehistoric artifacts. It is believed that the ashy deposit of charcoal is the remainder of a Fort Ancient Culture ash bed. The wood charcoal from within the remnant bed was carbon dated back to the time of the Fort Ancient Culture, between the years of 1041 CE and 1211 CE. Given the results found through carbon dating, burials in the conical mound dated to the Early Woodland and Fort Ancient periods, suggestive of ritual reuse of the circum mound area and ash bed.

=== Serpent Mound Museum ===
In 1901, the Ohio Historical Society hired engineer, Clinton Cowan, to survey newly acquired lands. Cowan created a 56-inch by 72-inch (1,800 mm) map that depicted the outline of The Serpent Mound in relation to nearby landmarks, such as hills and rivers. Along with this, Cowan made specific geographical surveys of the area, discovering a unique astrobleme on which the mound is based. He found that the mound is at the convergence of three distinctly different soil types. Cowan&#x27;s information, in conjunction with Putnam&#x27;s archaeological discoveries, has been the basis for all modern investigations of The Serpent Mound. 

In 1967, The Ohio Historical Society opened The Serpent Mound Museum that was built very close to the site of the mound. A pathway was constructed around the base of the mound, guiding visitors through and around the site. The museum features exhibits that include explanations of the effigy&#x27;s form, description of the construction of the mound, and the geographical history of the area. The museum also features an exhibit on the Adena culture that historically, they credited as the creators of the mound. 

In March 2002, A digital GIS map of Ohio&#x27;s Great Serpent Mound was created by Timothy A. Price and Nichole I. Stump.

<text>The shroud knot is a multi-strand bend knot used to join two ends of laid (or twisted) rope together. 

Shroud knots, in general, are a class of knots in which the individual strands of laid rope are knotted, but not woven, to the individual strands of another laid rope. This makes them more secure than a simple bend but less secure than a full splice; however, they use less rope than a full splice would. The most common form of shroud knot involves two interlocking wall knots.

The name &quot;shroud knot&quot; refers to the shrouds connected to a ship&#x27;s mast. If a shroud was shot through, the shroud knot provided a way to quickly repair it using minimal rope. As modern ships now use steel cable for the most part, the knots are now more often used decoratively than functionally.

<text>U.S. Route 150 (US 150) is a 571-mile (919 km) long northwest–southeast United States highway, signed as east–west. It runs from U.S. Route 6 outside of Moline, Illinois, to U.S. Route 25 in Mount Vernon, Kentucky.

==Route description==

===Illinois===
In the state of Illinois, U.S. 150 runs from the Quad City International Airport at U.S. Route 6 southeast to near Vermilion. U.S. 150 in Illinois is long.

Between Moline and Danville, Route 150 closely parallels Interstate 74.

===Indiana===

In the state of Indiana, U.S. 150 runs south with U.S. Route 41 from Terre Haute. It is then concurrent with its parent, U.S. Route 50 from Vincennes to Shoals. It then runs east to New Albany before overlapping Interstate 64 into Kentucky. Between Vincennes and New Albany the road follows the original route of the Buffalo Trace.

===Kentucky===

U.S. 150 runs concurrently with I-64 as it enters Kentucky from Indiana, crossing the Ohio River into Louisville on the Sherman Minton Bridge and exiting the I-64 freeway at North 22nd Street in the Portland neighborhood. From there, U.S. 150 runs south to West Broadway (westbound U.S. 150 follows Dr. W. J. Hodges Street from West Broadway to West Main Street, then runs along the 22nd Street Connector to its merge with North 22nd near Garfield Avenue); U.S. 150 follows Broadway across downtown to Baxter Avenue; after a brief run along Baxter, It then follows Bardstown Road, a major radial artery running southeasterly from downtown, with interchanges at Interstates 264 and 265.

Between West Main and West Broadway in Louisville, U.S. 150 is concurrent with U.S. Route 31W; from East Broadway and Baxter to Bardstown, Kentucky, it is concurrent with U.S. Route 31E. The route along Baxter Avenue and Bardstown Road follows the former Louisville and Bardstown Turnpike through the Highlands district of Louisville and past the historic Farmington plantation at the interchange with the Watterson Expressway (I-264).

U.S. routes 150 and 31E separate at Bardstown near the Martha Layne Collins Blue Grass Parkway. U.S. 150 then continues southeast, around the city of Danville before terminating at Mount Vernon.

==History==
===Illinois===
Before 1936, Illinois Route 39 ran from Bloomington to Champaign on the current routing of U.S. 150. In 1936, US 150 extended due northwest from Shoals, Indiana, to the Quad Cities. As a result, IL 39 and IL 91 were decommissioned. Not only that, IL 16, IL 80, and IL 121 were truncated. In 1954, a portion of US 150 in Peoria moved from the Franklin Street Bridge to the McClugage Bridge. As a result, US 150 City, later US 150 Bus., appeared in Peoria from 1954 to 1964. In 1971, the decision to remove a portion of US 150 from US 67 in Rock Island to I-74 in Danville failed. However, in 1976, the decision to truncate US 150 from US 67 in Rock Island to US 6 near the Quad City Airport was approved.

===Indiana===
Initially, US 150 ran from Shoals, Indiana, to Louisville, Kentucky. In 1936, US 150 extended due northwest from Shoals to the Quad Cities in Illinois. This caused IN 46 to cut back from the Illinois state line to Terre Haute.

===Kentucky===

U.S. Route 168 was created in 1926 from Louisville to Mount Vernon, Kentucky, overlapping US 68 between Bardstown and Perryville. In 1934, US 150 absorbed US 168.
==Major intersections==
















































==Special routes==

===Springfield business loop===
U.S. Route 150 Business (US 150 Bus.) is a special U.S. Route in Springfield, Kentucky. The route runs through downtown Springfield while US 150 bypasses the town to the northeast. It intersects Kentucky state highways 152, 555, 528, 1584, and 1404.
===Danville bypass===
U.S. Route 150 Bypass (US 150 Byp.) is a special U.S. Route in Danville, Kentucky. The route bypasses Danville to the southwest while US 150 runs through downtown. The route is overlapped by US 127 Byp. for approximately the first half of its length. It intersects US 127, along with Kentucky state routes 34 and 37.

<text>The Kentucky Fried Movie is a 1977 American independent anthology sketch black comedy film, produced by Kim Jorgensen, Larry Kostroff, and Robert K. Weiss, and directed by John Landis. Among the numerous star cameos are George Lazenby, Bill Bixby, Henry Gibson, Barry Dennen, Donald Sutherland, Tony Dow, Stephen Bishop, and the voice of Shadoe Stevens. According to writer David Zucker on the DVD commentary track, David Letterman auditioned for the role of the newscaster, but was not selected. The film also features many former members of The Groundlings and The Second City. The &quot;feature presentation&quot; portion of the film stars Evan C. Kim and &quot;hapkido&quot; grand master Bong Soo Han. &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; marked the first film appearances of a number of actors who later became famous, and launched the careers of the Zucker brothers, Abrahams and Landis.

Landis was recommended to direct &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; in 1978 based on his work with &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;.

The film&#x27;s writers were the team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, who subsequently wrote and directed &quot;Airplane!&quot;, &quot;Top Secret!&quot; and the &quot;Police Squad!&quot; television series and its film spin-offs, &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; films.

==Content==
&quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; contains largely unconnected sketches that parody various film genres, including exploitation films. The film&#x27;s longest segment spoofs early kung fu films, specifically &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;; its title, &quot;A Fistful of Yen&quot;, refers to &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;. Parodies of disaster films (&quot;That&#x27;s Armageddon&quot;), blaxploitation films (&quot;Cleopatra Schwartz&quot;), and softcore porn/women-in-prison films (&quot;Catholic High School Girls in Trouble&quot;) are presented as &quot;Coming Attraction&quot; trailers. The fictional films are produced by &quot;Samuel L. Bronkowitz&quot; (a conflation of Samuel Bronston and Joseph L. Mankiewicz, but also a spoof of B-movie producer and American International Pictures co-founder Samuel Z. Arkoff).

The sketch &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; mocks theater-based gimmicks like Sensurround by depicting a dramatic film presented in &quot;Feel-a-Round&quot;, which involves an usher physically groping a theater patron. Other sketches spoof TV commercials and programs, news broadcasts, and classroom educational films. The city of Detroit and its high crime rate are a running gag portraying the city as a hell on Earth; in &quot;A Fistful of Yen&quot;, Dr. Klahn orders a captured CIA agent to be sent to Detroit after which the agent screams and begs to be killed instead.

===Sketches===

===Notes===
==Production==
===Background===
David Zucker, Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams made the rounds of the Hollywood studios with the concept and were rejected by all of them, being told, &quot;audiences didn&#x27;t like movies composed of sketches&quot;. Since the three believed in their material, which they had honed in front of the audiences with their improvisational troupe &quot;Kentucky Fried Theater,&quot; they decided to make the movie on their own.

A wealthy real estate investor offered to finance the film if they would write a script. After completion of the screenplay, the investor had second thoughts and decided he did not want to finance the film alone. He said he would try to attract other investors if the three filmmakers would produce a 10-minute excerpt of the film, which he would finance. When the trio presented a budget of the short film to the investor, he backed out.

===Filming===
The prospect of shooting the short film so excited the trio that they decided to pay for it themselves. The 10-minute film cost $35,000, and with it they again approached the Hollywood studios. This time, they attached a young director named John Landis to the project, who came to their attention after an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; promoting his first film &quot;Schlock&quot;. However, once again, the studios turned them down.

==Distribution and release==
Curious as to how audiences would react to their film, they persuaded exhibitor Kim Jorgensen to show it before one of his regularly scheduled films. When Jorgenson saw the short, he &quot;fell out of his seat laughing.&quot; He was so impressed that he offered to raise the money needed to make the full-length version. By having his fellow exhibitors screen the film before audiences in their theaters, he convinced them to put up the $650,000 budget. When released, &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; was a box-office success, returning domestic American rentals of $7.1 million.

===Home media===
Anchor Bay Entertainment released a region 1 DVD in 2000. This release is presented in widescreen (1.85:1) aspect ratio and full-frame (1.33:1). It includes commentary by Landis; writers ZAZ; and producer Robert K. Weiss.

On July 4, 2011, Arrow Video in region 2 released a two-disc special edition DVD with the following special features:
* Feature presented in widescreen 1.85:1 and full-frame 1.33:1
* Original mono audio
* The audio recollections of director Landis; writers ZAZ; and producer Robert K. Weiss
* A conversation with David and Jerry Zucker: A feature length interview with the co-creators of &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;, &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; about their lives and career, from growing up and starting out in show business to their comedy influences and spoofing &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;
* Jerry Zucker&#x27;s on-set home video shot during the making of the movie
* Behind-the-scenes photo gallery
* Original trailer
* Four-panel reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork
* Double-sided fold-out artwork poster
* Collector&#x27;s booklet featuring brand new writing on director Landis by critic and author Calum Waddell

On July 2, 2013, Shout! Factory released the film on Blu-ray in a 1.85:1 aspect widescreen transfer. This version includes the original theatrical trailer, Arrow DVD release filmmaker commentary, and Zucker Bros. interview.

==Critical response==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 83%, based on reviews from 35 critics. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;The now obscure pop culture references and spoofed commercials add to &quot;Kentucky Fried Movies&quot; anarchic, anything-goes spirit and wit.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 61% based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

At the time, &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as having &quot;excellent production values and some genuine wit&quot; but also noted that film was juvenile and tasteless. Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Lots of people will probably like &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;, just as they like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald&#x27;s hamburgers. But popularity is still no reason for deifying mediocrity.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that the best moments were &quot;one-joke gags; its writers can&#x27;t sustain their humor for longer pieces. So, what you&#x27;re left with is a half-dozen decent gags, one overlong karate flick, and a few shots of bare breasts thrown in to titillate teenage boys.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a diverting hit-and-miss satirical anthology.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;As is inevitable in such undertakings there are some sophomoric moments, but on the whole &#x27;Kentucky Fried Movie&#x27; is, amazingly enough, almost continually funny in its ribald way.&quot;

Writing three decades later in 2008, Ian Nathan of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine calls the film &quot;occasionally funny&quot;... &quot;in a scattershot and puerile way&quot;, and he concludes the film is &quot;smart and satirical, but very dated&quot;. J. C. Maçek III of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie &quot;is, however, profane, experimental, violent, silly, hilarious, and occasionally quite sexually explicit (all of which surely helped its success over the years).&quot;

The film ranks number 87 on Bravo&#x27;s 100 Funniest Movies list.

<text>Milnthorpe is a village, civil parish, and former market town in Westmorland and Furness, Cumbria, England. It is south of Kendal. Historically in the county of Westmorland and on the A6, the village contains several old hostelries and hosts a market every Friday. The parish, which includes the village of Ackenthwaite, had a population of 2,199 according to the 2011 Census.

==History==

Milnthorpe was granted a market charter in 1334, although this lapsed in the 1920s.

Milnthorpe was part of the township of Heversham-with Milnthorpe, and was in Heversham parish until 1896. The 19th-century Church of St Thomas, which overlooks The Green and The Square, was designed by Kendal architect George Webster.

Milnthorpe became a centre of business and activity because it was originally a port, using the River Bela and estuary (now only navigable to Arnside) and it remains a significant commercial centre for the area.

==Economy==
Tourism is a major contributor to the local economy. Milnthorpe had coaching inns on the main road north, the modern A6. The village used to be a major traffic bottleneck before the opening of the M6 motorway in 1970, and the A590/A591 Kendal link road a few years later. The congestion at Milnthorpe&#x27; cross roads was notoriously amongst the worst in the North West. The village is just outside the Arnside and Silverdale National Landscape (formerly AONB), with the River Bela forming its northern boundary.

The popular children&#x27;s drink &quot;Um Bongo&quot; was made in Milnthorpe by Libby&#x27;s in the 1980s. Milnthorpe is the home of Duralon Combs, a comb manufacturing business over 300 years old. Big Fish Internet Ltd (formerly BF Internet, now trading as BFI) was founded in Milnthorpe in 1996 and is now located away in Sandside; it is the longest-established web design company in the UK. The village has a branch of the family-owned supermarket Booths.

Milnthorpe market was revived in the 1980s and for some years contributed substantially to the parish council&#x27;s income through stall rentals. In the 21st century the market has reduced in size, reducing the council&#x27;s income, but it is still held weekly, with a monthly farmers&#x27; market.

==Governance==
Milnthorpe is in the unitary authority area of Westmorland and Furness, in the ceremonial county of Cumbria. It is in the parliamentary constituency of Westmorland and Lonsdale, held since 2005 by Liberal Democrat Tim Farron.

Milnthorpe has a parish council.

From 1 April 1974 to 1 April 2023, Milnthorpe was in South Lakeland non-metropolitan district.

==Community==
Milnthorpe has one secondary school, Dallam School, which was graded &quot;Needs improvement&quot; by Ofsted in 2023 and one primary school, Milnthorpe Primary School, rated by Ofsted as &quot;Good&quot; in 2019. 
There are three public houses in the village.

==Landmarks==
The Grade I listed house Dallam Tower, with an estate known for its deer, stands near to the River Bela just south-west of Milnthorpe, although in the parish of Beetham. The grade II listed St Anthony&#x27;s Tower may be seen on the top of St Anthony&#x27;s Hill to the north-east of the village centre. There are a total of nine grade II listed buildings or structures in the parish, including a footbridge over the River Bela, built in 1730 as a road bridge.

Just to the north is Levens Hall, famed for its topiary.

==People==
The former Leader of the Liberal Democrats (2015–2017), Tim Farron (MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale) lives in Milnthorpe.

John Taylor, third president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1880 to 1887, was born in Milnthorpe and lived there until he emigrated to Canada.

<doc id="903086" wikidata="Q1129888" url="?curid=903086" title="U.S. Route 250">
<text>U.S. Route 250 (US 250) is a route of the United States Numbered Highway System, and is a spur of U.S. Route 50. It currently runs for from Richmond, Virginia, to Sandusky, Ohio. It passes through the states of Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio. It goes through the cities of Richmond, Charlottesville, Staunton, and Waynesboro, Virginia; and Wheeling, West Virginia. West of Pruntytown, West Virginia, US 250 intersects and forms a short overlap with its parent US 50.

In Virginia and Ohio, the route is signed east–west. In West Virginia, the route is signed north–south.

==Route description==

===Ohio===
In Ohio, U.S. 250 is an important cross-state corridor linking Sandusky (on Lake Erie) to Bridgeport (on the Ohio River). From a regional/traffic perspective, the route can roughly be divided into five sections linking major regions and routes of the state:
* US 6 in Sandusky to US 20 at Norwalk
* US 20 at Norwalk to US 30 at Wooster
* US 30 at Wooster to I-77 at Strasburg
* I-77 at New Philadelphia to US 22 at Cadiz
* US 22 at Cadiz to I-70 at Bridgeport

===West Virginia===

 U.S. 250&#x27;s northern entrance into West Virginia is via the Military Order of the Purple Heart Bridge from Bridgeport, Ohio onto Wheeling Island. It is briefly co-signed with U.S. Route 40. The route additionally co-signs with Interstate 70 and crosses the Ohio River on the Fort Henry Bridge in Wheeling, West Virginia. U.S. Route 250 then exits I-70 east of the Wheeling Tunnel and joins West Virginia Route 2 one mile (1.6 km) later. In Moundsville, West Virginia, the route leaves WV 2 and departs toward Cameron, Mannington, and Fairmont. It intersects with its parent route, U.S. Route 50, two miles west of Grafton in Pruntytown and continues southward, co-signed with U.S. Route 119 for 12 miles. The route moves through Philippi, and finally through Elkins. U.S. Route 250 intersects with U.S. Route 33 and U.S. Route 219 briefly in Elkins, which is the last major hub before U.S. Route 250 winds its way through the Appalachian Mountains to the Virginia border.

U.S. 250 in West Virginia includes the Philippi Covered Bridge at Philippi, the only covered bridge on the United States Numbered Highway System.

====Philippi truck route====

U.S. Route 250 Truck follows Blue and Gray Expressway around the south and west sides of downtown Philippi, avoiding the covered bridge.

===Virginia===

US 250 runs from the West Virginia state line near Hightown east to its eastern terminus at US 360 in Richmond. US 250 is the main east–west highway of Highland County, which is known as Virginia&#x27;s Little Switzerland; the highway follows the path of the 19th century Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike. From Staunton east to Richmond, the U.S. Highway serves as the local complement to Interstate 64 (I-64), roughly following the 18th century Three Notch&#x27;d Road through Waynesboro and Charlottesville on its way through the Shenandoah Valley, its crossing of the Blue Ridge Mountains at Rockfish Gap, and the Piedmont. In the Richmond metropolitan area, US 250 is known as Broad Street, a major thoroughfare through the city&#x27;s West End and downtown areas.

==History==

===Earlier roads, funding conflicts===
Between Short Pump and Staunton, U.S. 250 largely follows the routing of the Three Notch&#x27;d Road (or the Three Chopt Road), which had been established in the Colony of Virginia between Richmond and the Shenandoah Valley by the 1740s. Most likely, the road followed an ancient Monacan trail from Orapax (east of Richmond) to the western Shenandoah Valley. This well-planned route required only one major river crossing, the Rivanna at Charlottesville, with inns or taverns spaced about apart.

The route west of Staunton was built about 100 years later as a toll road, the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike. In the second quarter of the 19th century, it became a major gateway into Virginia&#x27;s &quot;Trans-Allegheny&quot; region, which presented much greater challenges to transportation than did less rugged portions of the state. In that region, navigable waterways were unavailable and canals impractical. Wheeled vehicles in the form of wagons, and later, motor vehicles needed to pass through with passengers and freight. It became part of the main trade route for salt and other commodities in the early 19th century. As the American Civil War broke out, the route became very important and was defended by Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s troops at the Battle of McDowell in 1862.

The portion of the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike west of Allegheny Mountain (almost all of it) became part of West Virginia in 1863. Virginia&#x27;s pre-War debt became a major issue after the American Civil War, as millions of dollars of debt remained for infrastructure improvements, some of which were now located in the new state of West Virginia, including most of the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike. Political divisions in Virginia on this issue resulted in creation of a new major political group in the late 1870s, the Readjuster Party, a coalition of Democrats, Republicans, and African-Americans seeking a reduction in Virginia&#x27;s prewar debt by allocating an appropriate portion to the new State of West Virginia.

For several decades, Virginia and West Virginia disputed the new state&#x27;s share of the Virginia government&#x27;s debt. The issue was finally settled in 1915, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50. The final installment of this sum was paid off in 1939.

===U.S. Highway system, numbering===
U.S. Route 250 was created in 1928 and was originally routed from U.S. Route 50 in Grafton, West Virginia, north/west to U.S. Route 20 in Norwalk, Ohio. In 1932, the route was expanded north/west to Sandusky, Ohio. In 1934, the route was expanded southward and eastward to Richmond, Virginia.

<text>Joseph Francis Falls (May 2, 1928 – August 11, 2004) was an American journalist. He began his career in his native New York City. At the age of 17 in 1945, he took a job as a copyboy for the Associated Press. After an apprenticeship of eight years, Falls moved to the Detroit bureau of the AP.

In Detroit, Falls flourished. He was hired by the &quot;Detroit Times&quot; in 1956 to cover the Detroit Tigers. He continued on the Tigers&#x27; beat with the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; from 1960 to 1978. His final move was to the &quot;Detroit News&quot; where he was a columnist and eventually sports editor.

During his career, Falls also had weekly columns in both &quot;The Sporting News&quot; and &quot;The Hockey News&quot;. It is said many young writers were so taken by his writing they wanted to become sportswriters. He also kept a statistic on Rocky Colavito during his years as a member of the Detroit Tigers. When Colavito stranded a runner, Falls would give him an RNBI (Run Not Batted In). This infuriated Colavito and created a tense relationship between the two for several years.

Falls won several awards during his career. In 2001, he won the J. G. Taylor Spink Award from the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. After his retirement in 2003, he was named to the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.

Falls died of complications from diabetes and heart failure at age 76 in Detroit.

<text>The Vietnamese people (, ) or the Kinh people (), also recognized as the Viet people or the Viets, are a Southeast Asian ethnic group native to modern-day northern Vietnam and southern China who speak Vietnamese, the most widely spoken Austroasiatic language.

Vietnamese Kinh people account for 85.32% of the population of Vietnam in the 2019 census, and are officially designated and recognized as the &quot;Kinh&quot; people () to distinguish them from the other minority groups residing in the country such as the Hmong, Cham, or Mường. The Vietnamese are one of the four main groups of Vietic speakers in Vietnam, the others being the Mường, Thổ, and Chứt people. They are related to the Gin people, a minority ethnic group in China.

==Terminology==
According to Churchman (2010), all endonyms and exonyms referring to the Vietnamese such as &quot;Viet&quot; (related to ancient Chinese geographical imagination), &quot;Kinh&quot; (related to medieval administrative designation), or &quot;Keeu&quot; and &quot;Kæw&quot; (derived from Jiāo 交, ancient Chinese toponym for Northern Vietnam, Old Chinese &quot;*kraw&quot;) by Kra-Dai speaking peoples, are related to political structures or have common origins in ancient Chinese geographical imagination. Most of the time, the Austroasiatic-speaking ancestors of the modern Kinh under one single ruler might have assumed for themselves a similar or identical social self-designation inherent in the modern Vietnamese first-person pronoun &quot;ta&quot; (us, we, I) to differentiate themselves with other groups. In the older colloquial usage, &quot;ta&quot; corresponded to &quot;ours&quot; as opposed to &quot;theirs&quot;, and during colonial time they were &quot;&quot;nước ta&quot; (our country) and &quot;tiếng ta&quot; (our language) in contrast to &quot;nước tây&quot; (western countries) and &quot;tiếng tây&quot; (western languages).

===Việt===
The term &quot; (Yue) () in Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph &quot;戉&quot; for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty ( BC), and later as &quot;越&quot;. At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south. Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC Yue/Việt referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people. From the 3rd century BC the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of south and southwest China and northern Vietnam, with particular ethnic groups called Minyue, Ouyue (Vietnamese: Âu Việt), Luoyue (Vietnamese: Lạc Việt), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (Bách Việt, ; ). The term Baiyue/Bách Việt first appeared in the book &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot; compiled around 239 BC. By the 17th and 18th centuries AD, educated Vietnamese referred to themselves as &quot;người Việt&quot; 𠊛越 (Viet people) or &quot;người Nam&quot; 𠊛南 (southern people).
===Kinh===
Beginning in the 10th and 11th centuries, a strand of Viet-Muong (northern Vietic language) with influence from a hypothetic Chinese dialect in northern Vietnam, dubbed as Annamese Middle Chinese, started to become what is now the Vietnamese language. Its speakers called themselves the &quot;Kinh&quot; people, meaning people of the &quot;metropolitan&quot; centered around the Red River Delta with Hanoi as its capital. Historic and modern chữ Nôm scripture classically uses the Han character &#x27;京&#x27;, pronounced &quot;Jīng&quot; in Mandarin, and &quot;Kinh&quot; with Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation. Other variants of Proto-Viet-Muong were driven from the lowlands by the Kinh and were called &quot;Trại&quot; (寨 Mandarin: &quot;Zhài&quot;), or &quot;outpost&quot; people&quot;, by the 13th century. These became the modern Mường people. According to Victor Lieberman, &quot;người Kinh&quot; (Chữ Nôm: 𠊛京) may be a colonial-era term for Vietnamese speakers inserted anachronistically into translations of pre-colonial documents, but literature on 18th century ethnic formation is lacking.

==History==
===Origins and pre-history===
There is considerable debate regarding the ethnic origin of the Kinh people. The Vietic languages are traditionally assumed to originate from northern Vietnam, around the Red River Delta. Archaeogenetics demonstrate that the Hoabinbians, who share common ancestry with Aboriginal Australians and Melanesians, were the earliest human settlers of northern Vietnam. They later mixed with East Asian immigrants, as demonstrated by the human remains from the Mán Bạc and Đông Sơn cultures. Studies show that Kinh Vietnamese have more affinities with Đông Sơn culture whilst also having ancestry from southern China. They also show affinities with Núi Nấp populations from Bronze Age Vietnam, which can be modeled as a mixture of Dushan-related (~65%) and northern East Asian-related (~35%) ancestry.

One hypothesis suggests that the forerunners of the ethnic Kinh descend from a subset of proto-Austroasiatic people in southern China, either around Yunnan, Lingnan, or the Yangtze River, as well as mainland Southeast Asia. These proto-Austroasiatics also diverged into Monic speakers, who settled further to the west, and the Khmeric speakers, who migrated further south. The Munda of northeastern India were another subset of proto-Austroasiatics who likely diverged earlier than the aforementioned groups, given the linguistic distance in basic vocabulary of the languages. Most archaeologists, linguists, and other specialists, such as Sinologists and crop experts, believe that they arrived no later than 2000 BC, bringing with them the practice of riverine agriculture and in particular, the cultivation of wet rice. Some linguists (James Chamberlain, Joachim Schliesinger) have suggested that Vietic-speaking people migrated from the North Central Region of Vietnam to the Red River Delta, which had originally been inhabited by Tai speakers. However, Michael Churchman found no records of population shifts in Jiaozhi (centered around the Red River Delta) in Chinese sources, indicating that a fairly stable population of Austroasiatic speakers, ancestral to modern Vietnamese, inhabited the delta during the Han-Tang periods. Others have proposed that tribes in northern Vietnam and southern China did not have any kind of defined ethnic boundary and could not be described as &quot;Vietnamese&quot; (Kinh) in any satisfactory sense. Thus, attempts to identify ethnic groups in ancient Vietnam are problematic and often inaccurate.

Another theory, based upon linguistic diversity, locates the most probable homeland of the Vietic languages in modern-day Bolikhamsai Province and Khammouane Province in Laos as well as in parts of Nghệ An Province and Quảng Bình Province in Vietnam. In the 1930s, clusters of Vietic-speaking communities discovered in the hills of eastern Laos were believed to be the earliest inhabitants of that region. 

According to the Vietnamese legend &quot;The Tale of the Hồng Bàng Clan&quot; (&quot;Hồng Bàng&quot; thị truyện), written in the 15th century, the first Vietnamese were descended from the dragon lord Lạc Long Quân and the fairy Âu Cơ. They married and had one hundred eggs, from which hatched one hundred children. Their eldest son ruled as the Hùng king. The Hùng kings were claimed to be descended from the mythical figure Shen Nong.

===Early history and Chinese rule===
The earliest reference of the proto-Vietnamese in Chinese annals was the &quot;Lạc&quot; (Chinese: Luo), &quot;Lạc Việt&quot;, or the Dongsonian, an ancient tribal confederacy of perhaps polyglot Austroasiatic and Kra-Dai speakers who occupied the Red River Delta. The Lạc developed the metallurgical Đông Sơn culture and the Văn Lang chiefdom, ruled by the semi-mythical Hùng kings. To the south of the Dongsonians was the Sa Huỳnh culture of the Austronesian Chamic people. Around 400–200 BC, the Lạc came to contact with the Âu Việt (a splinter group of Tai people) and the Sinitic people from the north. According to a late-third- or early-fourth-century AD Chinese chronicle, Thục Phán, the leader of the Âu Việt, conquered Văn Lang and deposed the last Hùng king. Having submissions of Lạc lords, Thục Phán proclaimed himself King An Dương of Âu Lạc kingdom.

In 179 BC, Zhao Tuo, a Chinese general who has established the Nanyue state in modern-day southern China, annexed Âu Lạc, which initiated Sino-Vietic interaction that lasted for a millennium. In 111 BC, the Han Empire conquered Nanyue and brought northern Vietnam under Han rule.

By the 7th century to 9th century AD, as the Tang Empire ruled over the region, historians such as Henri Maspero proposed that Vietnamese-speaking people became separated from other Vietic groups such as the Mường and Chứt due to heavier Chinese influences on the Vietnamese.In the mid-9th century, local rebels aided by Nanzhao almost ended Tang rule. The Tang reconquered the region in 866, causing half of the local rebels to flee into the mountains, marking the separation between the Mường and the Vietnamese. In 938, the Vietnamese leader Ngô Quyền who was a native of Thanh Hóa, led Viet forces to defeat the Chinese armada at Bạch Đằng River. He proclaimed himself king over a polity that could be perceived as &quot;Vietnamese&quot;.

===Medieval and early modern period===
Ngô Quyền died in 944 and his kingdom collapsed into chaos and disturbances between twelve warlords and chiefs. In 968, a leader named Đinh Bộ Lĩnh united them and established the Đại Việt (Great Việt) kingdom. With assistance of powerful Buddhist monks, Đinh Bộ Lĩnh chose Hoa Lư in the southern edge of the Red River Delta as the capital instead of Tang-era Đại La, adopted Chinese-style imperial titles, coinage, and ceremonies and tried to preserve the Chinese administrative framework. The independence of Đại Việt, according to Andrew Chittick, allows it &quot;to develop its own distinctive political culture and ethnic consciousness&quot;. In 979, Emperor Đinh Tiên Hoàng was assassinated, and Queen Dương Vân Nga married Dinh&#x27;s general Lê Hoàn and appointed him as Emperor. Disturbances in Đại Việt attracted attention from the neighbouring Chinese Song dynasty and Champa Kingdom, but they were defeated by Lê Hoàn. A Khmer inscription dated 987 records the arrival of Vietnamese merchants (Yuon) in Angkor. Chinese writers Song Hao, Fan Chengda and Zhou Qufei all reported that the inhabitants of Đại Việt &quot;tattooed their foreheads, crossed feet, black teeth, bare feet and blacken clothing&quot;. The early 11th-century Cham inscription of Chiên Đàn, My Son, erected by king of Champa Harivarman IV (r. 1074–1080), mentions that he had offered Khmer (Kmīra/Kmir) and Viet (Yvan) prisoners as slaves to various local gods and temples of the citadel of Tralauṅ Svon.

Successive Vietnamese royal families from the Đinh, Early Lê, Lý dynasties and Trần and Hồ dynasties, which had (Hoa)/Chinese ancestry, ruled the kingdom peacefully from 968 to 1407. Emperor Lý Thái Tổ (r. 1009–1028) relocated the Vietnamese capital from Hoa Lư to Đại La, the center of the Red River Delta in 1010. They practiced elitist marriage alliances between clans and nobles in the country. Mahayana Buddhism became state religion, Vietnamese music instruments, dancing and religious worshipping were influenced by both Cham, Indian and Chinese styles, while Confucianism slowly gained attention and influence. The earliest surviving corpus and text in the Vietnamese language were dated to the early 12th century whilst surviving chữ Nôm script inscriptions were dated to the early 13th century, showcasing enormous influences of Chinese culture among the early Vietnamese elites.

The Mongol Yuan dynasty unsuccessfully invaded Đại Việt in the 1250s and 1280s, though they sacked Hanoi. The Ming dynasty of China conquered Đại Việt in 1406, brought the Vietnamese under Chinese rule for 20 years, before they were driven out by Vietnamese leader Lê Lợi. The fourth grandson of Lê Lợi, Emperor Lê Thánh Tông (r. 1460–1497), is considered one of the greatest monarchs in Vietnamese history. His reign is recognized for the extensive administrative, military, education, and fiscal reforms he instituted, and a cultural revolution that replaced the old traditional aristocracy with a generation of literati scholars, adopted Confucianism, and transformed a Đại Việt from a Southeast Asian style polity to a bureaucratic state that flourished. Thánh Tông&#x27;s forces, armed with gunpowder weapons, overwhelmed the long-term rival Champa in 1471, then launched an unsuccessful invasion against the Laotian and Lan Na kingdoms in the 1480s.

===16th century – Modern period===


With the death of Thánh Tông in 1497, the Đại Việt kingdom swiftly declined. Extreme climate, failing crops, regionalism and factionism tore the Vietnamese apart. From 1533 to 1790s, four powerful Vietnamese families – Mạc, Lê, Trịnh and Nguyễn – each ruled their own domains. In the northern Vietnamese polity of Đàng Ngoài (outer realm), the Lê emperors barely sat on the throne while the Trịnh lords held power of the court. The Mạc controlled northeast Vietnam. The Nguyễn lords ruled the southern polity of Đàng Trong (inner realm). Thousands of ethnic Vietnamese migrated south and settled on the old Cham lands, with Cham inhabitants assimilating into the new Vietnamese state. Vietnamese also settled in the highlands of Vietnam and intermixed with the natives over centuries. European missionaries and traders from the sixteenth century brought new religion, ideas and crops to the Vietnamese (Annamese). By 1639, there were 82,500 Catholic converts throughout Vietnam. In 1651, Alexandre de Rhodes published a 300-pages catechism in Latin and romanized-Vietnamese (&quot;chữ Quốc Ngữ&quot;) or the Vietnamese alphabet.

Conflict among Vietnamese ended in 1802 as Emperor Gia Long, who was aided by French mercenaries, defeated the Tay Son kingdoms and reunited Vietnam. By 1847, the Vietnamese state under Emperor Thiệu Trị, a people that were identified as &quot;người Việt Nam&quot; accounted for nearly 80 percent of the country&#x27;s population. This demographic model continues to persist through the French Indochina, Japanese occupation and modern day.

Between 1862 and 1867, the southern third of the country became the French colony of Cochinchina. By 1884, the entire country had come under French rule, with the central and northern parts of Vietnam separated into the two protectorates of Annam and Tonkin. The three Vietnamese entities were formally integrated into the union of French Indochina in 1887. The French administration imposed significant political and cultural changes on Vietnamese society. A Western-style system of modern education introduced new humanist values into Vietnam.

Despite having a long recorded ethnic history, the formation of the ethnic Vietnamese or Kinh identity, only begun by the late 19th and early 20th century, with the help of the colonial administration. Following the colonial government&#x27;s efforts of ethnic classification, nationalism, especially ethnonationalism and eugenic social Darwinism, were encouraged among the new Vietnamese intelligentsia&#x27;s discourse. Ethnic tensions sparked by Vietnamese ethnonationalism peaked during the late 1940s at the beginning phase of the First Indochina War (1946–1954), which resulted in violence between Khmer and Vietnamese in the Mekong Delta.

The mid-20th century marked a pivotal turning point with the Vietnam War, a conflict that not only left an indelible impact on the nation but also had far-reaching consequences for the Vietnamese people. The war, which lasted from 1955 to 1975, resulted in significant social, economic, and political upheavals, shaping the modern history of Vietnam and its people. Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the post-war era brought economic hardships and strained social dynamics, prompting resilient efforts at reconstruction, reconciliation, and the implementation of economic reforms such as the Đổi Mới policies in the late 20th century. Later, North Vietnam&#x27;s Soviet-style social policies tried to build an image of diversity under the harmony of socialism, promoting the idea of the Vietnamese nation as a &#x27;great single family&#x27; comprised by many different ethnic groups, and Vietnamese ethnic chauvinism was officially discouraged.

== Genetics ==
Several studies show close genetic affinities between Kinh Vietnamese and Thais although other studies show closer affinities with Tai-Kadai peoples. A 2017 study stated that the Kinh received significant genetic input from southern Han Chinese and to a lesser extent, Malays and Thais. There is also extensive gene flow between Kinh and Laotians. A 2022 study stated that the Kinh possessed genetic characteristics of the Baiyue lineage, similar to other Tai-Kadai-speaking Baiyue populations in mainland China. A 2024 study states that Kinh share mtDNA haplotypes with Chams, including those who immigrated to Cambodia after the fall of Vijaya in 1471 CE.

==Religions==

According to the 2019 census, the religious demographics of Vietnam are as follows:
*86.32% Vietnamese folk religion or unaffiliated 
*6.1% Catholicism
*4.79% Buddhism (mainly Mahayana)
*1.02% Hoahaoism
*1% Protestantism
*&lt;1% Caodaism
*0.77 Others
It is worth noting here that the data is highly skewed, as a large majority of Vietnamese may be unaffiliated with any religion, yet practice forms of traditional folk religion or Mahayana Buddhism. Vietnamese folk religion is not an organized religious system, but a set of local worship traditions devoted to the &quot;thần&quot;, a term which can be translated as &quot;spirits&quot;, &quot;Gods&quot; or with the more exhaustive locution &quot;generative powers&quot;. These Gods can be nature deities or national, community or kinship tutelary deities or ancestral Gods and the ancestral Gods of a specific family. Ancestral Gods are often deified heroic persons. Vietnamese mythology preserves narratives telling of the actions of many of the cosmic Gods and cultural heroes.

Estimates for the year 2010 published by the Pew–Templeton Global Religious Futures Project:

*Vietnamese folk religion, 45.3%
*Unaffiliated, 29.6%
*Buddhism, 16.4%
*Christianity, 8.2%
*Other, 0.5%

==Diaspora==

Originally from northern Vietnam and southern China, the Vietnamese have expanded south and conquered much of the land belonging to the former Champa Kingdom and Khmer Empire over the centuries. They are the dominant ethnic group in most provinces of Vietnam, and constitute a small percentage of the population in neighbouring Cambodia. According to a 2020 study, Kinh Vietnamese mostly reside in the lowlands of Vietnam.

Beginning around the sixteenth century, groups of Vietnamese migrated to Cambodia and China for commerce and political purposes. Descendants of Vietnamese migrants in China form the Gin ethnic group in the country and primarily reside in and around Guangxi Province. Vietnamese form the largest ethnic minority group in Cambodia, at 5% of the population. Under the Khmer Rouge, they were heavily persecuted and survivors of the regime largely fled to Vietnam.

During French colonialism, Vietnam was regarded as the most important colony in Asia by the French colonial powers, and the Vietnamese had a higher social standing than other ethnic groups in French Indochina. As a result, educated Vietnamese were often trained to be placed in colonial government positions in the other Asian French colonies of Laos and Cambodia rather than locals of the respective colonies. There was also a significant representation of Vietnamese students in France during this period, primarily consisting of members of the elite class. A large number of Vietnamese also migrated to France as workers, especially during World War I and World War II, when France recruited soldiers and locals of its colonies to help with war efforts in metropolitan France. The wave of migrants to France during World War I formed the first major presence of the Vietnamese in France and the Western world.

When Vietnam gained its independence from France in 1954, a number of Vietnamese loyal to the colonial government also migrated to France. During the partition of Vietnam into North and South, a number of South Vietnamese students also arrived to study in France, along with individuals involved in commerce for trade with France, which was a principal economic partner with South Vietnam.

Forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the Khmer Rouge era reduced the Vietnamese population in Cambodia from between 250,000 and 300,000 in 1969 to a reported 56,000 in 1984.

The fall of Saigon and end of the Vietnam War prompted the start of the Vietnamese diaspora, which saw millions of Vietnamese fleeing the country from the new communist regime. Recognizing an international humanitarian crisis, many countries accepted Vietnamese refugees, primarily the United States, France, Australia and Canada. Meanwhile, under the new communist regime, tens of thousands of Vietnamese were sent to work or study in Eastern Bloc countries of Central and Eastern Europe as development aid to the Vietnamese government and for migrants to acquire skills that were to be brought home to help with development.

<text>U.S. Route 550 (US 550) is a spur of U.S. Highway 50 that runs from Bernalillo, New Mexico to Montrose, Colorado in the western United States. The section from Silverton to Ouray is frequently called the Million Dollar Highway.
It is one of the roads on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways.

== Route description ==

=== New Mexico ===

U.S. 550 begins just north of Albuquerque at Bernalillo and passes through the towns of San Ysidro, Cuba, Bloomfield, and Aztec. Except for sections passing through the above listed towns, U.S. 550 in New Mexico has been widened to four lanes, offering a faster (70 mph) connection for Farmington, New Mexico, and Durango, Colorado, to Albuquerque and Santa Fe.

=== Colorado ===
Most of U.S. 550 in Colorado is two-lane mountainous highway. It is one of only two north–south U.S. Highways in Colorado which runs west of the Continental Divide. (The other route is US 491.) The route travels north through the San Juan Mountains.

The Million Dollar Highway stretches for about in western Colorado and follows the route of U.S. 550 between Silverton and Ouray, Colorado. It is part of the San Juan Skyway Scenic Byway. Between Durango and Silverton the Skyway loosely parallels the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad.

Although the entire stretch has been called the Million Dollar Highway, it is actually just the twelve miles (19 km) south of Ouray through the Uncompahgre Gorge to the summit of Red Mountain Pass which gives the highway its name. This stretch through the gorge is challenging and potentially hazardous to drive; it is characterized by steep cliffs, narrow lanes, and a lack of guardrails; the ascent of Red Mountain Pass is marked with a number of hairpin curves used to gain elevation, narrow lanes for traffic—many cut directly into the sides of mountains. During this ascent, the remains of the Idarado Mine are visible. Travel north from Silverton to Ouray allows drivers to hug the inside of curves; travel south from Ouray to Silverton perches drivers on the vertiginous outside edge of the highway. Large RVs travel in both directions, which adds a degree of challenge to people in cars. The road is kept open year-round. Summer temperatures can range from highs between at the ends of the highway to in the mountain passes. The snow season starts in October, and snow will often close the road in winter. Chains may be required to drive.

North of Durango, the highway passes by Trimble Springs, hot springs that have been open for visitors since the late 19th century. The highway runs north along the Animas River, under the Hermosa Cliffs. It enters the San Juan National Forest and goes past Haviland Lake and Electra Lake. Drivers pass by Engineer Mountain and Twilight Peak before crossing Coal Bank Pass. Next is Molas Pass, which offers a panoramic view of Molas Lake, the Animas River Gorge, and Snowdon Peak. Northbound travelers then pass through the town of Silverton, elevation 9,320 feet (2841 m), surrounded by 13,000 foot (4000 m) peaks Sultan Mountain, Kendall Mountain, and Storm Peak.

The highway leaves Silverton and proceeds up Mineral Creek Valley before ascending to Red Mountain Pass. The ruins of the Longfellow Mine are visible along the way. The highway then goes through a series of steep grades and hairpin turns before reaching Lookout Point, which offers a view of the town of Ouray.
This section of the route passes over three mountain passes:
* Coal Bank Pass, elevation .
* Molas Pass, elevation .
* Red Mountain Pass, elevation .
The origin of the name Million Dollar Highway is disputed. There are several legends, though, including that it cost a million dollars a mile to build in the 1920s, and that its fill dirt contains a million dollars in gold ore.

There are seventy named avalanche paths that intersect Highway 550 in the between Ouray and Silverton, Colorado.

U.S. 550 ends at the corner of Townsend Avenue and San Juan Avenue in Montrose, Colorado at the junction of its parent route U.S. Highway 50.

== History ==

The original portion of the Million Dollar Highway was a toll road built by Otto Mears in 1883 to connect
Ouray and Ironton.
Another toll road was built over Red Mountain Pass from Ironton to Silverton.
In the late 1880s Otto Mears turned to building railroads and built the Silverton Railroad north from
Silverton over Red Mountain Pass to reach the lucrative mining districts around
Red Mountain, terminating at Albany just eight miles (13 km) south of Ouray.
The remaining eight miles (13 km) were considered too difficult and steep for a railroad.
At one point a cog railroad was proposed, but it never made it beyond the planning stage.

In the early 1920s, the original toll road was rebuilt at considerable cost and became the present day US 550. The Million Dollar Highway was completed in 1924.
Today the entire route is part of the San Juan Skyway Scenic Byway.

US 550 was part of the original 1926 federal highway system. The original highway extended 110 miles (177 km) from Montrose, Colorado at U.S. Highway 50 to U.S. Highway 450 (now U.S. Highway 160) at Durango, Colorado. In 1934, Highway 550 was extended through Farmington to Shiprock, New Mexico. In 1989, the western end of US 550 was replaced with US 64 between Farmington and Shiprock. In 2000, US 550 was extended further south from Aztec to Bernalillo to replace the newly widened NM 44 and NM 544, at which time all of US 550 in New Mexico was four lanes.

In 2009 US 50 was re-routed onto the San Juan Avenue bypass to avoid downtown Montrose. As a result, U.S. 550 was extended approximately one mile northwest to intersect with the new U.S. 50 alignment.

On July 17, 2024, the segment of US 550 leading into Durango from the south was realigned onto a four-lane divided highway tying into the Grandview Interchange. This realignment bypasses a former steep, curvy alignment up Farmington Hill and includes a new roundabout.

<text>U.S. Route 158 (US 158) is an east–west United States highway that runs for from Mocksville to Whalebone Junction in Nags Head, entirely in the state of North Carolina. It is also a critical route that connects the cities of Winston-Salem, Summerfield, and Reidsville with one another.

==Route description==

US 158 is a parallel of U.S. Route 58 (which runs generally through southern Virginia). The route does not intersect its parent, instead intersecting its sibling, US 258. It currently runs for from Mocksville, at US 64/US 601 to Whalebone Junction in the town of Nags Head. A stretch skirts the Great Dismal Swamp.

In Mocksville, it begins and heads north of the US 64/US 601 junction, through the downtown area. Out of town, it turns northeasterly, following in parallel to Interstate 40 (I-40) to Winston-Salem. In the city, the route uses the name Stratford Road which is an arterial thoroughfare which enters into a busy commercial district passing by Hanes Mall and it passes two folded diamond junctions 
with Interstate 40 and the expressway Silas Creek Parkway (NC 67). US 158 leaves the road to merge with the freeway Salem Parkway (US 421) for a short concurrency through the downtown area. Just east of town, it leaves US 421 and turns roughly north, closely paralleling nearby US 311, heading into Walkertown where both routes intersect with the future Interstate 74, which is currently designated as NC 74, and NC 66. Here, Motorists can use both NC 66 and NC 74 to connect between US 158 and US 311 within town. It then passes through Belews Creek, taking on a northeasterly path and effectively bypassing the Kernersville area, and passes thru Stokesdale where it meets two more NC Highways, NC 65, and NC 68. Shortly after, it passes through the north part of Summerfield, intersecting Interstate 73 (which carries U.S. Route 220 along it). It then leads further east to Reidsville, where it links to US 29 Business. From Reidsville, US 158 connects the northern counties of North Carolina, going through the cities and towns of Yanceyville, Roxboro, Oxford, Henderson, Roanoke Rapids, Murfreesboro, and Elizabeth City.

From North Carolina Highway 168 (NC 168) eastward, it carries traffic from the Norfolk region to the Outer Banks. Normally, the route is a four-lane undivided highway with a speed limit of in Dare County, from its eastern terminus to the Wright Memorial Bridge. Most of the route is otherwise a four-lane divided highway with a speed limit until NC 168 (which carries traffic to Chesapeake, Virginia), where it turns left at an at-grade intersection. It then returns to being undivided.

In Dare County, the highway runs in a north–south direction, although it is signed west–east. It acts as a bypass route for the Virginia Dare Trail (NC 12), which runs parallel to US 158 to the east. For the entire length of the Outer Banks, US 158 is known as Croatan Highway.

==History==
US 158 was established in 1932, as a concurrency with NC 48 from Mocksville to Murfreesboro and NC 12, from Murfreesboro to Virginia state line. US 158 also replaced US 117 routing between Murfreesboro to Franklin, Virginia. In 1934, NC 48 and NC 12 were removed from its routing. In 1937 or 1938, US 158&#x27;s western terminus moved from Depot Street to Main Street in Mocksville. In 1941, US 158 swapped routes with NC 65 between Stokesdale and Reidsville. Also in the same year, US 158 was rerouted east at Murfreesboro, replacing NC 30 to Camden and NC 34 crossing the Croatan Sound and ending at NC 345, near Manteo; its old alignment north of Murfreesboro became part of US 258. Between 1945-1949, US 158&#x27;s western terminus moved to its current location at Main and Lexington Streets, in Mocksville; also in same time period, US 158 was moved onto new routing through Roxboro; its old alignment along Main Street became US 501A. In 1946, US 158 bypassed north of Gatesville, with its old alignment became US 158A.

Around 1951, US 158 was removed from Roanoke Island and was truncated at its current eastern terminus at Whalebone Junction, on Bodie Island; its former routing was replaced by US 64/US 264. In 1951, US 158 was placed on new bypass north of Henderson, leaving behind US 158A along its old alignment. Around 1954, US 158 was placed on one-way streets in downtown Winston-Salem: westbound via Clover Dale Street, Glade Street and fifth street; eastbound via first and fourth streets. In 1955, US 158 was bypassed north of Warrenton, leaving behind US 158A along its former alignment.

In 1959, US 158 was moved onto new expressway between Stratford to Marshall and Cherry Streets, in Winston-Salem. In 1960, US 158 was moved onto its current routing in Bodie Island, leaving behind US 158 Business.

By 1962, US 158 had completed its transition onto the freeway in Winston-Salem, leaving behind US 158 Business. Between 1963-1967, US 158 was routed onto one-way streets in Weldon. In 1968, US 158 was rerouted in Elizabeth City.

In 1971, US 158 was placed onto the Yanceyville bypass; its old routing through the downtown area was partly replaced by NC 62, with Main Street downgraded to secondary road. In 1973, US 13/US 158 was placed on new western bypass of Winton, its old alignment became part of NC 45. In 1979, US 158 was placed on bypass north of Reidsville, via US 29 Bus. and NC 14; its old alignment became mostly secondary roads, with just part remaining as NC 87. In 1984, US 17/US 158 was rerouted again in Elizabeth City. In 1995, US 158 was rerouted onto new bypass south of Murfreesboro, leaving behind US 158 Business.

In May 2016, NCDOT&#x27;s applied to AASHTO to change US 158&#x27;s route in the Reidsville area. Instead of following Bus. US 29 and NC 87 north to NC 14 and then South-east on NC 14 to US 29, the route would bypass the City by taking US 158 south along Bus. US 29/NC 87 to where they split and then following NC 87 South to US 29. US 158 would then run concurrent with US 29 to the NC 14 exit where it would resume its old alignment. AASHTO approved the change on May 24 at the meeting of the Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering in Waterloo, Iowa. NCDOT passed its ordinance approving the change on March 5, 2018.

===U.S. Route 117===
U.S. Route 117 (US 117) was established in 1926 to run for from Norlina, through the towns of Warrenton, Roanoke Rapids, and Murfreesboro; from there it went north into Virginia through Franklin, Suffolk, Portsmouth, and Norfolk to Virginia Beach. It was cut back to Franklin in 1931 or 1932, being replaced by US 58 east of there, and soon afterwards the remainder was renumbered US 158.

==Special routes==

===Winston-Salem business loop===

U.S. Route 158 Business, was established in 1962 as a renumbering of mainline US 158 in downtown Winston-Salem. The business loop traversed on one-way streets: eastbound used Cherry Street, 4th Street, and Dunleith Street; westbound used Marshall Street and 5th Street. In 1970, it was decommissioned.
===Oxford alternate route===

U.S. Route 158 Alternate (US 158A), was established in 1954 as a partial bypass of Oxford. As an alternate spur route, it did not reconnect with US 158, instead going southwest to US 15. In 1971, US 158A was eliminated when Interstate 85 was built over it.
===Oxford business loop===

U.S. Route 158 Business, established in 1994, is a business loop that followed the original US 158 route through downtown Oxford, via Roxboro Road, College Street, and Williamsboro Street.




===Henderson alternate route===

U.S. Route 158 Alternate (US 158A), was established in 1951, when mainline US 158 bypassed north of Henderson. US 158A followed the original route through downtown Henderson until 1960, when it was renumbered to US 158 Business.
===Henderson business loop===

U.S. Route 158 Business, established in 1960, is a business loop through downtown Henderson, via Oxford Road, Dabney Drive, and Garnett Street.


===Warrenton alternate route===

<text>Valeri Vladimirovich &quot;Val&quot; Bure ( ; ; born June 13, 1974) is a Russian–American former professional ice hockey right winger. He played 10 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens, Calgary Flames, Florida Panthers, St. Louis Blues, and Dallas Stars from 1995 to 2004. A second round selection of the Canadiens, 33rd overall, at the 1992 NHL entry draft, Bure appeared in one NHL All-Star Game, in 2000. He led the Flames in scoring with 35 goals and 75 points in 1999–2000, a season in which he and brother Pavel combined to set an NHL record for goals by a pair of siblings with 93.

Bure left his home in the Soviet Union in 1991 to play junior ice hockey in the Western Hockey League (WHL) for the Spokane Chiefs. A two-time WHL all-star, he was the first Russian player in the league&#x27;s history. Internationally, he represented Russia on numerous occasions. He was a member of the bronze medal-winning squad at the 1994 World Junior Championship and was a two-time medalist at the Winter Olympics. Bure and the Russians won the silver medal in 1998 and bronze in 2002.

Back and hip injuries led to Bure&#x27;s retirement from hockey in 2005. He now operates Bure Family Wines in St. Helena, California with his wife, actress Candace Cameron Bure, to whom he has been married since 1996.

==Early life==
Valeri Bure was born June 13, 1974, in Moscow, Soviet Union. He is the younger son of Vladimir and Tatiana Bure. Vladimir, whose family originated from Furna, Switzerland, was an Olympic swimmer who won four medals for the Soviet Union at three Olympic Games between 1968 and 1976. Bure&#x27;s family had a noble history: his ancestors made precious watches for Russian tsars from 1815 to 1917 and as craftsmen of the imperial family, were granted noble status.

Bure was around nine years old when his parents separated. In 1991, he joined his father and brother, Pavel, in moving to North America as his elder sibling embarked on a National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Vancouver Canucks. His mother arrived two months later. They settled initially in Los Angeles where Vladimir continued to train and coach both Valeri and Pavel in hockey and physical conditioning. However, by 1998 both became estranged from their father, along with his second wife and their half-sister, Katya. Neither brother has given a reason for the split.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
Bure played three games during the 1990–91 season with HC CSKA Moscow of the Soviet Championship League prior to leaving the Soviet Union. As a 17-year-old, Bure was eligible to play junior hockey upon his arrival in North America, and joined the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League (WHL). In doing so, he became the first Russian player in the league&#x27;s history. He joined the team one year before the Canadian Hockey League, of which the WHL is a member, instituted an import draft.

Bure recorded 49 points in 53 games in 1991–92 for the Chiefs, his first season in the WHL. The Montreal Canadiens selected him with their second round pick, 33rd overall, at the 1992 NHL entry draft. The NHL Central Scouting Bureau praised Bure as being a good skater. In its assessment, the Bureau added: &quot;very smart around the net; good passer, playmaker. Good shot, quick release. Will take a hit to make the play. Good competitor.&quot; He returned to Spokane for the 1992–93 season where Bure led his team and finished second overall in WHL scoring with 147 points. His 68 goals that season remains a Chiefs&#x27; franchise record. He was named to the WHL&#x27;s West Division First All-Star Team. Bure attended Montreal&#x27;s training camp prior to the 1993–94 season, but was again returned to his junior team. He recorded 102 points in his final season in the WHL and was named to the Second All-Star Team. In three seasons with Spokane, Bure recorded 298 points and stands fourth on the Chiefs&#x27; all-time scoring list.

===Montreal Canadiens===
Upon turning professional in 1994–95, Bure spent the majority of the season with Montreal&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Fredericton Canadiens. He had 23 goals and 48 points in 45 games for the club. Bure earned a recall to Montreal late in the season and made his NHL debut on February 28, 1995, against the New York Islanders. His first goal came two weeks later, on March 15, against goaltender Wendell Young of the Pittsburgh Penguins. In 24 games with Montreal, Bure scored 3 goals and added an assist. Playing in his brother&#x27;s shadow – Pavel had become a superstar in Vancouver – Valeri struggled to live up to the expectations placed on him. He scored 22 goals and 42 points in his first full season in Montreal, 1995–96, but scored only 14 goals the following season. He battled injuries that season; two concussions and a kidney injury limited him to 64 games, 13 fewer than the previous season.

At five feet, ten inches (178 cm) tall, Bure was a smaller player in the NHL. His linemates Saku Koivu (five foot ten) and Oleg Petrov (five foot nine) were similarly diminutive, and the trio were known in Montreal as the &quot;Smurf line&quot;. After playing 50 games for the Canadiens in 1997–98, Bure was traded. He was sent to the Calgary Flames in a February 1, 1998, deal in exchange for Jonas Höglund and Zarley Zalapski. The deal was welcomed by Bure, who appreciated both the ability to play closer to his family on the west coast as well as increased opportunity by joining a young Flames team. He recorded his first career hat trick in one of his first games in Calgary, against the Edmonton Oilers. Bure appeared in 16 games with the Flames that season and scored 38 points in 66 games combined between Montreal and Calgary.

===Calgary Flames===
Bure&#x27;s offensive ability emerged in Calgary as he became one of the team&#x27;s leading scorers. His totals of 26 goals and 53 points in 1998–99 were both third best on the team; at one point of the season, Bure scored the game-winning goal in four consecutive victories for Calgary. The departure of Flames&#x27; star Theoren Fleury added pressure on Bure to be an offensive leader in 1999–2000, and he responded to become one of the NHL&#x27;s early scoring leaders. He used his speed and skating ability to good effect and was eighth in league scoring by mid-December. Bure was named to the World team at the 2000 All-Star Game where he played on a line with his brother. Pavel was named most valuable player of the game by scoring three goals, two of them assisted by Valeri, in a 9–4 victory over North America. Bure completed the season as the Flames leader in goals (35) and points (75, 14th overall in the NHL) and was the only player on the team to appear in all 82 games. Pavel Bure scored 58 goals for the Florida Panthers, and the brothers&#x27; combined total of 93 goals set an NHL record for a set of siblings.

Though his offensive production declined in 2000–01, Bure&#x27;s 27 goals was second on the team to Jarome Iginla&#x27;s 31 and he finished third with 55 points. He became embroiled in a power struggle with his coaches, first Don Hay who was dismissed mid-season, and then Greg Gilbert, as both wanted him play a more defensive-minded game. Bure struggled to adapt and at one point was held out of the Flames lineup by Gilbert in response. Bure was rumoured to have asked for a trade out of Calgary, and the Florida Panthers (who had acquired Pavel), Buffalo Sabres and New York Rangers were among the teams who showed interest in his services. On June 24, 2001, the Flames traded Bure, along with Jason Wiemer to the Panthers for Rob Niedermayer and a second round draft pick.

===Florida, St. Louis and Dallas===
As his contract had expired, Bure was a restricted free agent. Initially unable to come to an agreement with the Panthers on salary, Bure did not sign until late September. The delay resulted in his being a brief hold-out from Florida&#x27;s training camp in advance of the 2001–02 season. Injury interrupted the start of Bure&#x27;s Panthers career as a knee ailment that began bothering him before the season worsened as he played the first games of the campaign. Tests revealed damage to his right knee that required arthroscopic surgery to repair; Bure missed 37 games while recovering. A second knee injury ended Bure&#x27;s season in mid-March as the Panthers had fallen out of playoff contention. His brother had already been traded by that point, and the Panthers were also making Valeri available in potential deals. He appeared in only 31 games and recorded 18 points.

Bure remained with the Panthers as the 2002–03 season began, but his year was marked by an offensive slump. He was also hampered by a hairline fracture to his wrist after Keith Primeau slashed him during an early December game against the Philadelphia Flyers. With only 5 goals and 26 points in 46 games for Florida, Bure was traded on March 11, 2003, to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for defenceman Mike Van Ryn. Another knee injury, this time a sprained ligament, kept Bure out of the Blues lineup for much of the remainder of the season. He recorded two assists each in five regular season and six post-season games for St. Louis. After the season, the Blues placed Bure on waivers, and he returned to Florida upon being claimed by the Panthers.

Free of injury for the first time in two seasons, Bure was one of the Panthers&#x27; offensive leaders in 2003–04. He reached 20 goals for the fifth time in his NHL career, and as the season&#x27;s trade deadline approached, was Florida&#x27;s leading scorer with 45 points. However, as the Panthers were out of playoff contention, they traded Bure to the Dallas Stars on March 9, 2004, in exchange for Drew Bagnall and a draft pick. Bure was placed on the Stars&#x27; top line with Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen, and he recorded 7 points in 13 games to conclude the regular season. Bure added three assists in five playoff games.

An unrestricted free agent following the 2004 playoffs, Bure did not play anywhere in 2004–05 as the entire NHL season was canceled due to a labour dispute. He signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Kings for the 2005–06 season when the league resumed operations. He never played a regular season game for the Kings. A back injury suffered during the pre-season, initially just described as &quot;soreness&quot;, kept him out of the regular lineup. The injury ultimately required surgery, and a second surgery on his hip caused Bure to miss the entire season. At the age of 31, he opted to retire following the surgeries.

===International===
Bure made his debut internationally with the Russian national junior team at the 1994 World Junior Championship. He was the leading scorer of the bronze medal-winning Russians with eight points in six games and was named to the tournament&#x27;s All-Star Team. That same year, Bure first played with the senior team as he scored three goals in six contests at the 1994 World Championship in a fifth-place effort.

After appearing in one game at the inaugural World Cup of Hockey in 1996, Bure played in his first of two Olympic Games in 1998. The tournament marked the first time he played with his brother Pavel since they were briefly teammates with CSKA Moscow in 1991. Valeri scored one goal in the tournament, and Russia advanced to the gold medal game. They settled for the silver medal after being shut out by Dominik Hašek and the Czech Republic. Bure returned for the 2002 Salt Lake Games. He scored a goal in the tournament as Russia won the bronze medal. Russia invited him to play at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, but as he was without an NHL contract at the time, Bure declined to play due to a lack of proper insurance in the event of injury.

==Personal life==
Bure married actress Candace Cameron on June 22, 1996. They were introduced by Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Full House&quot; castmate Dave Coulier at a charity hockey game in 1994. The couple has three children: daughter Natasha (b. 1998) and sons Lev (b. 2000) and Maksim (b. 2002). Bure became an American citizen in December 2001. Bure cited his family as the reason he retired from hockey in 2005. He felt he could return from his surgeries, but wanted to spend time with his children and allow his wife to return to acting. Bure and his family are Christians.

Both Valeri and his older brother Pavel became estranged from their father Vladimir Bure, along with his second wife, Julia, and their half-sister Katya, by 1998. Neither brother has explained a reason for the split.

In 2007, Bure and his wife opened a Florida restaurant called The Milk and Honey Café, but closed the business when the family moved to California. They operate a Napa Valley winery, Bure Family Wines. Bure developed an interest in wine early in his NHL career that he described as growing into a passion: &quot;I fell in love with the behind-the-scenes work and being able to start from the vineyard and put it into a bottle. It&#x27;s an amazing process.&quot; Bure modified the Russian imperial seal his great-grandfather stamped on his watches to use as his company&#x27;s label.

Bure returned to the ice in 2010 as a contestant on the second season of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s figure skating reality show &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;. The series was a competition that paired a former professional hockey player with a figure skater. Bure&#x27;s partner was Ekaterina Gordeeva. The pair won the competition and shared a $100,000 prize donated to charities of their choice. Bure&#x27;s donation was made to Compassion Canada.

<doc id="903115" wikidata="Q2298614" url="?curid=903115" title="Turk's head knot">
<text>A Turk&#x27;s head knot, sometimes known as a sailor&#x27;s knot, is a decorative knot with a variable number of interwoven strands forming a closed loop. The name refers to a general family of knots, not an individual knot. While this knot is typically made around a cylinder, it can also be formed into a flat, mat-like shape. Some variants can be arranged into a roughly spherical shape, akin to a monkey&#x27;s fist knot.

This knot is primarily used for tightening up underlying material to overlay as a tubular covering knot, prevent slipping, and add a decorative element. A notable practical use for the &quot;Turk&#x27;s head&quot; is to mark the &quot;king spoke&quot; of a ship&#x27;s wheel (the spoke that is upright when the rudder is in a central position). The knot takes its name from its resemblance to a turban (), though a turban is wound rather than interwoven.

== Leads and bights ==
Different types of Turk&#x27;s head knots are classified according to the number of leads and bights, as well as the method of construction. The number of bights is the number of crossings around the circumference of the cylinder. The number of leads refers to the number of strands around the circumference of the cylinder, before doubling, tripling, etc. Depending on the number of leads and bights, a Turk&#x27;s head may be tied using a single strand or multiple strands. Mathematically, the number of strands is the greatest common divisor of the number of leads and the number of bights. The knot may be tied with a single strand if and only if the two numbers are co-prime. For example, 3 lead × 5 bights (3×5), or 5 lead × 7 bights (5×7).

There are three general groupings of Turk&#x27;s head knots:
# Narrow, where the number of leads is two or more less than the number of bights (3×5, or 3×7).
# Long or Wide, where the number of leads is two or more greater than the number of bights (5×3, or 16×7).
# Square, where there is a difference of one between leads and bights (7×8 or 8×7).

The number of bights determines the shape found at the center. Three bights create a triangular shape, while four create a square. A two lead, 3 bight Turk&#x27;s head is a double overhand knot.

A two lead, three bight Turk&#x27;s head is also a trefoil knot if the ends are joined together. (2,n) alternating torus knots are (2,n) Turk&#x27;s head knots. ((&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) = &quot;q&quot; times around a circle in the interior of the torus, and &quot;p&quot; times around its axis of rotational symmetry.) Turk&#x27;s head knots are easy to edit though hard to tie.

== Uses in culture ==
In the World Organization of the Scout Movement, the scarf rings called woggles to affix their neckerchiefs or scarfs are often variations of the Turk&#x27;s head knot. The Gilwell Woggle is worn by Scout Leaders who complete training courses to be awarded the Wood Badge insignia. It is an official part of the uniform.

<doc id="903117" wikidata="Q1510531" url="?curid=903117" title="Karyorrhexis">
<text>Karyorrhexis (from Greek κάρυον &quot;karyon&quot; &#x27;kernel, seed, nucleus&#x27; and ῥῆξις &quot;rhexis&quot; &#x27;bursting&#x27;) is the destructive fragmentation of the nucleus of a dying cell whereby its chromatin is distributed irregularly throughout the cytoplasm. It is usually preceded by pyknosis and can occur as a result of either programmed cell death (apoptosis), cellular senescence, or necrosis. 

In apoptosis, the cleavage of DNA is done by Ca2+ and Mg2+ -dependent endonucleases. 
== Overview ==
During apoptosis, a cell goes through a series of steps as it eventually breaks down into apoptotic bodies, which undergo phagocytosis. In the context of karyorrhexis, these steps are, in chronological order, pyknosis (the irreversible condensation of chromatin), karyorrhexis (fragmentation of the nucleus and condensed DNA) and karyolysis (dissolution of the chromatin due to endonucleases).

Karyorrhexis involves the breakdown of the nuclear envelope and the fragmentation of condensed chromatin due to endonucleases. In cases of apoptosis, karyorrhexis ensures that nuclear fragments are quickly removed by phagocytes. In necrosis, however, this step fails to progress in an orderly manner, leaving behind fragmented cellular debris, further contributing to tissue damage and inflammation.

== Process of Nuclear Envelope Dissolution During Karyorrhexis ==
In the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, environmental factors such as oxidative stress signal pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family to eventually break the outer membrane of the mitochondria. This causes cytochrome c to leak into the cytoplasm, which causes a cascade of events that eventually leads to the activation of several caspases. One of these caspases, caspase-6, is known to cleave nuclear lamina proteins such as lamin A/C, which hold the nuclear envelope together, thereby aiding in the dissolution of the nuclear envelope.

== Process of Condensed Chromatin Fragmentation During Karyorrhexis ==
In the process of karyorrhexis through apoptosis, DNA is fragmented in an orderly manner by endonucleases such as caspase-activated DNase and discrete nucleosomal units are formed. This is because the DNA has already been condensed during pyknosis, meaning it has been wrapped around histones in an organized manner, with around 180 base pairs per histone. The fragmented chromatin observed during karyorrhexis is made when activated endonucleases cleave the DNA in between the histones, resulting in orderly, discrete nucleosomal units. These short DNA fragments left by the endonucleases can be identified on an agar gel during electrophoresis due to their unique “laddered” appearance, allowing researchers to better identify cell death through apoptosis. 

== Nucleus Degradation in Other Forms of Cell Death ==
Karyorrhexis is associated with a controlled breakdown of the nuclear envelope, typically by caspases that destroy lamins during apoptosis. However, for other forms of cell death that are less controlled than apoptosis, such as necrosis (unprogrammed cell death), the degradation of the nucleus is caused by other factors. Unlike apoptosis, necrosis cells are characterized by having a ruptured plasma membrane, no association with the activation of caspases, and typically invoking an inflammatory response. Because necrosis is a caspase-independent process, the nucleus may stay intact during early stages of cell death before being ripped open due to osmotic stress and other factors associated with having a hole in the plasma membrane. A specialized form of necrosis, called necroptosis, has a slightly more controlled degradation of the nucleus. This process is dependent on calpain, which is a protease that also degrades lamins, destabilizing the structure of the nucleus. However, similar to necrosis, this process also involves a ruptured plasma membrane, which contributes to the uncontrolled degradation of the nuclear envelope. 

Unlike karyorrhexis in apoptosis which produces apoptotic bodies to be digested through phagocytosis, karyorrhexis in necroptosis leads to the expulsion of cell contents into extracellular space to be digested through pinocytosis.

== Triggers and Mechanisms ==
The process of apoptosis, and thereby nucleus degradation through karyorrhexis, is invoked by various physiological and pathological stimuli. DNA damage, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and infections can initiate signaling cascades leading to nuclear degradation through the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway can also be induced through ethanol, which activates apoptosis-related proteins such as BAX and caspases. Additionally, if the death receptors on a cell’s surface are activated, such as CD95, the activation of caspases and nuclear envelope degradation can be triggered as well. In all of these processes, caspases such as caspase-3 play a key role by cleaving nuclear lamins and promoting chromatin fragmentation. In necrosis, uncontrolled calcium influx and activation of proteases such as calpains accelerate the process, highlighting the contrasting regulatory mechanisms between necrotic and apoptotic karyorrhexis.

The level of DNA damage determines whether a cell undergoes apoptosis or cell senescence. Cellular senescence refers to the cessation of the cell cycle and thus cell division, which can be observed after a fixed amount (approximately 50) of doublings in primary cells. One cause of cellular senescence is DNA damage through the shortening of telomeres. This causes a DNA damage response (DDR), which, if prolonged over a long period of time, activates ATR and ATM damage kinases. These kinases activate two more kinases, Chk1 and Chk2 kinases, which can alter the cell in a few different ways. One of these ways is by activating a transcription factor known as p53. If the level of DNA damage is mild, the p53 will opt to activate CIP, which inhibits CDKs, arresting the cell cycle. However, if the level of DNA damage is severe enough, p53 can trigger apoptotic pathways which lead to the dissolution of the nuclear envelope through karyorrhexis.

== Pathological Implications ==
Karyorrhexis is a prominent feature in conditions related to cell death, such as ischemia and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been observed during myocardial infarction and brain stroke, indicating its contribution to cell death in acute stress responses. Moreover, disorders such as placental vascular malperfusion have highlighted the role of karyorrhexis in fetal demise, particularly when it disrupts normal tissue homeostasis.

In cancer, apoptotic karyorrhexis plays a dual role. While it facilitates controlled cell death, aiding in tumor suppression, resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells results in evasion of this pathway, promoting malignancy. Therapeutic interventions targeting apoptotic pathways attempt to restore this phase of nuclear degradation to induce tumor regression.

<text>Bicuculline is a phthalide-isoquinoline compound that is a light-sensitive competitive antagonist of GABAA receptors. It was originally identified in 1932 in plant alkaloid extracts and has been isolated from &quot;Dicentra cucullaria&quot;, &quot;Adlumia fungosa&quot;, and several &quot;Corydalis&quot; species (all in subfamily Fumarioideae, previously known as family Fumariaceae). Since it blocks the inhibitory action of GABA receptors, the action of bicuculline mimics epilepsy; it also causes convulsions. This property is utilized in laboratories around the world in the &quot;in vitro&quot; study of epilepsy, generally in hippocampal or cortical neurons in prepared brain slices from rodents. This compound is also routinely used to isolate glutamatergic (excitatory amino acid) receptor function.

The action of bicuculline is primarily on the ionotropic GABAA receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels concerned chiefly with the passing of chloride ions across the cell membrane, thus promoting an inhibitory influence on the target neuron. These receptors are the major targets for benzodiazepines, z-drugs, and related anxiolytic drugs.

The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of bicuculline on GABAA receptors is 3 μM.

In addition to being a potent GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline can be used to block Ca2+-activated potassium channels.

Sensitivity to bicuculline is defined by IUPHAR as a major criterion in the definition of GABAA receptors

<doc id="903140" wikidata="Q262778" url="?curid=903140" title="Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.">
<text>Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. (translation: &quot;Munna Bro M.B.B.S.&quot;) is a 2003 Indian Hindi-language comedy drama film written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani in his directorial debut and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra under the banner Vinod Chopra Films. It features Sunil Dutt in his final film role as the father to his real-life son, Sanjay Dutt, who stars as the titular character. Gracy Singh, Jimmy Sheirgill, Arshad Warsi, Rohini Hattangadi and Boman Irani play other roles. It is a copy of 1998 hollywood film Patch Adams featuring Robin Williams.

The first installment of the &quot;Munna Bhai&quot; film series, the film follows Munna Bhai, a don in the Mumbai underworld, trying to please his father by pretending to be a doctor, but when a doctor, Asthana (Irani), exposes his lies and tarnishes his father&#x27;s honor, Munna enrolls in a medical college. Chaos ensues when Munna, upon finding that Asthana is the dean of the college, vows revenge, while also sparking a romance with a house doctor, Suman (Singh), unaware that she is his childhood friend and Asthana&#x27;s daughter. The film was followed by its sequel, &quot;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&quot; (2006).

Released on 19 December 2003, the film was a major critical and commercial success, and went on to win the 2004 National Film Award for Best Popular Film, and several Filmfare Awards, including the Best Film (Critics) and Best Screenplay. At the box office, it achieved a silver jubilee status (25-week run) being one of only eight Hindi films to have achieved this status since the year 2000. In its 26th week of release, the film could still be found playing on 300 screens throughout India. The film&#x27;s release was also accompanied by a mobile video game based on the film by Indiagames.

== Plot ==

Murliprasad Sharma is a gangster in Mumbai, known by the title &#x27;Munna Bhai&#x27; (&quot;bhai&quot; means brother or don in the local dialect), who runs an extortion racket. Every year, with the help of his aide Sarkeshwar &quot;Circuit&quot; Sharma and his gang, he converts his hide-out into a fully-functioning hospital to fool Munna&#x27;s visiting parents Hariprasad &quot;Hari&quot; Sharma and Parvati Sharma, who believe Munna is a real doctor.

Meanwhile, one of Hari&#x27;s annual visits with Parvati culminates in Hari bumping into childhood acquaintance Dr. Jagdish Asthana, who is the dean of a local medical college and had founded their village&#x27;s first medical centre. Hari proposes to Asthana that they get his daughter and Munna&#x27;s childhood friend &quot;Chinki&quot; married to him. Asthana agrees, even though Munna asks her to reject him, lest his parents discover the truth. However, when his maid reacts shockingly to Munna&#x27;s photo, Asthana realizes the truth and exposes Munna to Hari and Parvati. Humiliated at their son&#x27;s lack of a real vocation, they leave the city and return home. Munna vows to become a doctor to get back at Asthana but unknowingly ends up enrolling into his college with the help of home surgeon Dr. Rustom Pavri. Certain that Munna has cheated his way through the entrance exam, but lacking real evidence, he is forced to allow Munna to study there.

Upon becoming a student, Munna falls back into his ways by enforcing his regime of &quot;common-sense treatment&quot;, directly challenging Asthana&#x27;s conventional opinions to get under his skin. Despite the school&#x27;s emphasis on mechanical, cartesian, impersonal, and often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Munna, who constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic and almost holistic regimen around himself, clashes with professors over their lack of empathy towards patients, especially those who are deemed incurable by conventional medicine. His behavior is well-received by the hospital staff and patients, who are able to see the good-natured intent behind his anti-establishment actions. Asthana, perceiving this as chaos, is unable to stop it and resorts to laughter therapy to deal with his stress. 

Munna simultaneously develops a friendly relationship with Dr. Suman, who works at the hospital, unaware that she is &quot;Chinki&quot;, an ignorance she hilariously exploits to a point where he gives up on marriage plans with &quot;Chinki&quot; to exact revenge on Asthana after Suman sends her doctor friend to masquerade, and uses old-fashioned kindness and love to &#x27;cure&#x27; many patients at the hospital, including Karan, a suicidal youngster he met on his first day of college, and Dr. Pavri&#x27;s father, who at one point fell ill and short of a desire to live. He even thanks an underappreciated janitor and arranges to bring a stripper inside the patient ward to cheer up Zaheer, a man dying from stomach cancer who he befriends in the process.

When Asthana learns about the stripper episode, he sees this as a potential reason to expel Munna on disciplinary grounds but fails to do so after Munna injures himself to stay back. However, after he recovers, the hospital staff, patients and students stand in Asthana&#x27;s way and refuse to let Munna leave. Munna is then made to take a test before the entire college the next day to keep his enrolment. Later that night, Zaheer dies; still in shock, Munna gives up at a point during the test and leaves; in the process, Anand Banerjee, a paraplegic patient who has been brain-dead for the last 12 years, comes back to life. Suman realizes Munna as the miracle behind Anand&#x27;s recovery and gives a heartfelt speech, defending his actions. Asthana, finally moved, is forced to change his opinion of Munna.

Munna does not become a doctor, but news of his &#x27;miraculous&#x27; treatments reaches his parents. They return to the city and forgive him. Munna ends up marrying Suman after learning of her true identity as &quot;Chinki&quot;, and together, they open a real hospital in Munna&#x27;s family village. Circuit also gets married a year later and has a son nicknamed &quot;Short Circuit&quot;. Asthana resigns as the dean and becomes the head doctor, employing Munna&#x27;s methods, while Rustom succeeds him. As the film concludes, Anand, restored to normal mental health, narrates the story to a few children at the hospital as he is about to leave for Kolkata.

== Production ==

=== Early developments ===
In an interview, Hirani discussed how the idea for the film emerged from his interaction with some friends who were medical students. Later, he also had the opportunity to interact with a lot of medical professionals when some members of his family became sick. These experiences gave birth to the idea for the film.

Hirani initially conceptualised the tale of &quot;Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.&quot; as a series, and approached R. Madhavan to play the lead role. The actor turned down the offer citing that he was busy with other commitments. After Hirani chose to make into a film, during the scripting stage, he wanted Anil Kapoor to play the lead role. However, Shah Rukh Khan was later cast as Munna along with Sanjay Dutt as Zaheer but due to his back problems Khan was forced to turn down the film. Nevertheless, the end credits of the film thank Khan for his inputs into the script. Hirani also narrated the script to Aishwarya Rai during the time he was in talks with Shahrukh Khan. Khan and Rai were working together on &quot;Devdas&quot; at the time. Vivek Oberoi was considered for the role, but in the end Sanjay Dutt took the role as Munna, which ultimately gave him an image make over and helped change the public perception of the controversial superstar; his real-life father Sunil Dutt returned to the silver screen after 10 years to play Munna&#x27;s father. This is the first and only film in which real-life father and son Sunil and Sanjay appear together, although they both appeared in &quot;Reshma Aur Shera&quot; (1971), &quot;Rocky&quot; (1981) and &quot;Kshatriya&quot; (1993) but not in any scenes together.

The original choice for Circuit&#x27;s role was Makarand Deshpande. Arshad Warsi took over the role which proved to be a turning point for his career. The scenes of the Medical College were shot at the Agriculture College of Pune and Grant Medical College Mumbai.

=== Accusations of plagiarism ===
The film has a similar premise to the 1998 American film &quot;Patch Adams&quot;, starring Robin Williams. The producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra, however, denies there being a resemblance, and says that he had not watched the film before the release of &quot;Munna Bhai&quot;. Years later, accusations of plagiarism resurfaced on social media when some netizens highlighted scene-to-scene copies.

=== Lack of budget ===
Hirani did not have a big budget to shoot the film. As a result, he had to change the way certain scenes were shot. For example, the film ends with stills of Munna Bhai&#x27;s wedding. Hirani was told that setting up a wedding stage and making a wedding outfit for Gracie Singh would cost him several thousand rupees. To save on some of that money, Hirani arranged to have the stills shot on an actual wedding stage set up for a real wedding near the sets. The production team reached an agreement with the wedding hall management and used their stage after a wedding ended.

== Music ==
The music is composed by Anu Malik. Lyrics for the songs are penned by Abbas Tyrewala and Rahat Indori. Vocals for Dutt were supplied by Vinod Rathod.

According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around units sold, this film&#x27;s soundtrack album was the year&#x27;s one of the highest-selling.

== Accolades ==
&quot;Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.&quot; was the recipient of a number of awards. At the 50th Filmfare Awards, it received the Best Film (Critics), Best Screenplay, the Best Dialogue, and Best Comedian (for Warsi) in addition to four other nominations. It won a number of awards at the 2004 Zee Cine Awards including Best Debuting Director, Best Actor in a Comic Role (for Warsi), Best Cinematography, and Best Dialogue.

Other ceremonies include the 2004 National Film Awards where it won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film and the 2004 International Indian Film Academy Awards where it won the IIFA Best Comedian Award.
== Sequel ==
In February 2004, after the success of &quot;Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.&quot;, Rajkumar Hirani decided to work on his next project. He, along with his co-writer Abhijat Joshi, started to write the script of their new film. They didn&#x27;t want the script to include Munna Bhai, but after they wrote it, the script eventually turned out to be of &quot;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&quot;. Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Dutt, Arshad Warsi and Boman Irani were to reprise their roles but after the death of Sunil in May 2005, Hirani decided that the film will only have Sanjay &amp; Warsi to reprise their characters from &quot;Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.&quot; and other actors like Boman Irani and Jimmy Shergill were cast in new roles. &quot;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&quot; was released on 1 September 2006 and turned out to be a huge success.

== Remakes ==
The film was remade in Telugu as &quot;Shankar Dada M.B.B.S.&quot; (2004), in Tamil as &quot;Vasool Raja M.B.B.S.&quot; (2004), in Kannada as &quot;Uppi Dada M.B.B.S.&quot; (2007) and in Sinhala as &quot;Dr. Nawariyan&quot; (2017).

<text>Endocrine disruptors, sometimes also referred to as hormonally active agents, endocrine disrupting chemicals, or endocrine disrupting compounds are chemicals that can interfere with endocrine (or hormonal) systems. These disruptions can cause numerous adverse human health outcomes, including alterations in sperm quality and fertility; abnormalities in sex organs‚ endometriosis‚ early puberty‚ altered nervous system or immune function; certain cancers; respiratory problems; metabolic issues; diabetes, obesity, or cardiovascular problems; growth, neurological and learning disabilities, and more. Found in many household and industrial products, endocrine disruptors &quot;interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body that are responsible for development, behavior, fertility, and maintenance of homeostasis (normal cell metabolism).&quot;

Any system in the body controlled by hormones can be derailed by hormone disruptors. Specifically, endocrine disruptors may be associated with the development of learning disabilities, severe attention deficit disorder, and cognitive and brain development problems.

There has been controversy over endocrine disruptors, with some groups calling for swift action by regulators to remove them from the market, and regulators and other scientists calling for further study. Some endocrine disruptors have been identified and removed from the market (for example, a drug called diethylstilbestrol), but it is uncertain whether some endocrine disruptors on the market actually harm humans and wildlife at the doses to which wildlife and humans are exposed. The World Health Organization published a 2012 report stating that low-level exposures may cause adverse effects in humans.

==History==
The term &quot;endocrine disruptor&quot; was coined in 1991 at the Wingspread Conference Center in Wisconsin. One of the early papers on the phenomenon was by Theo Colborn in 1993. In this paper, she stated that environmental chemicals disrupt the development of the endocrine system, and that effects of exposure during development are often permanent.
Although the endocrine disruption has been disputed by some, work sessions from 1992 to 1999 have generated consensus statements from scientists regarding the hazard from endocrine disruptors, particularly in wildlife and also in humans.

The Endocrine Society released a scientific statement outlining mechanisms and effects of endocrine disruptors on &quot;male and female reproduction, breast development and cancer, prostate cancer, neuroendocrinology, thyroid, metabolism and obesity, and cardiovascular endocrinology,&quot; and showing how experimental and epidemiological studies converge with human clinical observations &quot;to implicate endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs) as a significant concern to public health.&quot; The statement noted that it is difficult to show that endocrine disruptors cause human diseases, and it recommended that the precautionary principle should be followed. A concurrent statement expresses policy concerns.

Endocrine disrupting compounds encompass a variety of chemical classes, including drugs, pesticides, compounds used in the plastics industry and in consumer products, industrial by-products and pollutants, heavy metals and even some naturally produced botanical chemicals. Industrial chemicals such as parabens, phenols and phthalates are also considered potent endocrine disruptors. Some are pervasive and widely dispersed in the environment and may bioaccumulate. Some are persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and can be transported long distances across national boundaries and have been found in virtually all regions of the world, and may even concentrate near the North Pole, due to weather patterns and cold conditions. Others are rapidly degraded in the environment or human body or may be present for only short periods of time. Health effects attributed to endocrine disrupting compounds include a range of reproductive problems (reduced fertility, male and female reproductive tract abnormalities, and skewed male/female sex ratios, loss of fetus, menstrual problems); changes in hormone levels; early puberty; brain and behavior problems; impaired immune functions; and various cancers.

One example of the consequences of the exposure of developing animals, including humans, to hormonally active agents is the case of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), a nonsteroidal estrogen and not an environmental pollutant. Prior to its ban in the early 1970s, doctors prescribed DES to as many as five million pregnant women to block spontaneous abortion, an off-label use of this medication prior to 1947. It was discovered after the children went through puberty that DES affected the development of the reproductive system and caused vaginal cancer. The relevance of the DES saga to the risks of exposure to endocrine disruptors is questionable, as the doses involved are much higher in these individuals than in those due to environmental exposures.

Aquatic life subjected to endocrine disruptors in an urban effluent have experienced decreased levels of serotonin and increased feminization.

In 2013 the WHO and the United Nations Environment Programme released a study, the most comprehensive report on EDCs to date, calling for more research to fully understand the associations between EDCs and the risks to health of human and animal life. The team pointed to wide gaps in knowledge and called for more research to obtain a fuller picture of the health and environmental impacts of endocrine disruptors. To improve global knowledge the team has recommended:
* Testing: known EDCs are only the &#x27;tip of the iceberg&#x27; and more comprehensive testing methods are required to identify other possible endocrine disruptors, their sources, and routes of exposure.
* Research: more scientific evidence is needed to identify the effects of mixtures of EDCs on humans and wildlife (mainly from industrial by-products) to which humans and wildlife are increasingly exposed.
* Reporting: many sources of EDCs are not known because of insufficient reporting and information on chemicals in products, materials and goods.
* Collaboration: more data sharing between scientists and between countries can fill gaps in data, primarily in developing countries and emerging economies.

== Endocrine system ==

Endocrine systems are found in most varieties of animals. The endocrine system consists of glands that secrete hormones, and receptors that detect and react to the hormones.

Hormones travel throughout the body via the bloodstream and act as chemical messengers. Hormones interface with cells that contain matching receptors in or on their surfaces. The hormone binds with the receptor, much like a key would fit into a lock. The endocrine system regulates adjustments through slower internal processes, using hormones as messengers. The endocrine system secretes hormones in response to environmental stimuli and to orchestrate developmental and reproductive changes. The adjustments brought on by the endocrine system are biochemical, changing the cell&#x27;s internal and external chemistry to bring about a long term change in the body. These systems work together to maintain the proper functioning of the body through its entire life cycle. Sex steroids such as estrogens and androgens, as well as thyroid hormones, are subject to feedback regulation, which tends to limit the sensitivity of these glands.

Hormones work at very small doses (part per billion ranges). Endocrine disruption can thereby also occur from low-dose exposure to exogenous hormones or hormonally active chemicals such as bisphenol A. These chemicals can bind to receptors for other hormonally mediated processes. Furthermore, since endogenous hormones are already present in the body in biologically active concentrations, additional exposure to relatively small amounts of exogenous hormonally active substances can disrupt the proper functioning of the body&#x27;s endocrine system. Thus, an endocrine disruptor can elicit adverse effects at much lower doses than a toxicity, acting through a different mechanism.

The timing of exposure is also critical. Most critical stages of development occur in utero, where the fertilized egg divides, rapidly developing every structure of a fully formed baby, including much of the wiring in the brain. Interfering with the hormonal communication in utero can have profound effects both structurally and toward brain development. Depending on the stage of reproductive development, interference with hormonal signaling can result in irreversible effects not seen in adults exposed to the same dose for the same length of time. Experiments with animals have identified critical developmental time points in utero and days after birth when exposure to chemicals that interfere with or mimic hormones have adverse effects that persist into adulthood. Disruption of thyroid function early in development may be the cause of abnormal sexual development in both males and females early motor development impairment, and learning disabilities.

There are studies of cell cultures, laboratory animals, wildlife, and accidentally exposed humans that show that environmental chemicals cause a wide range of reproductive, developmental, growth, and behavior effects, and so while &quot;endocrine disruption in humans by pollutant chemicals remains largely undemonstrated, the underlying science is sound and the potential for such effects is real.&quot; While compounds that produce estrogenic, androgenic, antiandrogenic, and antithyroid actions have been studied, less is known about interactions with other hormones.

The interrelationships between exposures to chemicals and health effects are rather complex. It is hard to definitively link a particular chemical with a specific health effect, and exposed adults may not show any ill effects. But, fetuses and embryos, whose growth and development are highly controlled by the endocrine system, are more vulnerable to exposure and may develop overt or subtle lifelong health or reproductive abnormalities. Prebirth exposure, in some cases, can lead to permanent alterations and adult diseases.

Some in the scientific community are concerned that exposure to endocrine disruptors in the womb or early in life may be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including reduced IQ, ADHD, and autism. Certain cancers and uterine abnormalities in women are associated with exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in the womb due to DES used as a medical treatment.

In a 2005 publication, phthalates in pregnant women&#x27;s urine was linked to subtle, but specific, genital changes in their male infants—a shorter, more female-like anogenital distance and associated incomplete descent of testes and a smaller scrotum and penis. The science behind this study was questioned by phthalate industry consultants, and back in 2008, there were only five studies of anogenital distance in humans, with one researcher stating, &quot;Whether AGD measures in humans relate to clinically important outcomes, however, remains to be determined, as does its utility as a measure of androgen action in epidemiological studies.&quot; Today, it is well-established that AGD is an indicator of fetal androgen exposure, and several studies have found a correlation between AGD and the incidence of prostate cancer.

==Effects on intrinsic hormones==
Toxicology research shows that some endocrine disruptors target the specific hormone trait that allows one hormone to regulate the production or degradation of intrinsic hormones. As endocrine disruptors have the potential to mimic or antagonize natural hormones, these chemicals can exert their effects by acting through interaction with nuclear receptors, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor or membrane bound receptors.

==U-shaped dose-response curve==

Most toxicants, including endocrine disruptors, have been claimed to follow a U-shaped dose-response curve. This means that very low and very high levels have more effects than mid-level exposure to a toxicant.

Endocrine-disrupting effects have been noted in animals exposed to environmentally relevant levels of some chemicals. For example, a common flame retardant, BDE-47, affects the reproductive system and thyroid gland of female rats in doses similar to which humans are exposed.

Low concentrations of endocrine disruptors can also have synergistic effects in amphibians, but it is not clear that this is an effect mediated through the endocrine system.

A consensus statement by the Learning and Developmental Disabilities Initiative argued that &quot;The very low-dose effects of endocrine disruptors cannot be predicted from high-dose studies, which contradicts the standard &#x27;dose makes the poison&#x27; rule of toxicology. Nontraditional dose-response curves are referred to as non-monotonic dose response curves.&quot;

It has been claimed that tamoxifen and some phthalates have fundamentally different (and harmful) effects on the body at low doses than at high doses.

==Routes of exposure==

=== Food ===
Food is a major mechanism by which people are exposed to pollutants. Diet is thought to account for up to 90% of a person&#x27;s PCB and DDT body burden. In a study of 32 different common food products from three grocery stores in Dallas, Texas, fish and other animal products were found to be contaminated with PBDE. Since these compounds are fat-soluble, it is likely they are accumulating from the environment in the fatty tissue of animals eaten by humans. Some suspect fish consumption is a major source of many environmental contaminants. Indeed, both wild and farmed salmon from all over the world have been shown to contain a variety of man-made organic compounds. While pesticides are found in many food products, phthalates can also leech into crops, vegetables and fruits from contaminated soil and greenhouse plastic covers.

=== Indoor air and household dust ===
With the increase in household products containing pollutants and the decrease in the quality of building ventilation, indoor air has become a significant source of pollutant exposure. Residents living in houses with wood floors treated in the 1960s with PCB-based wood finish have a much higher body burden than the general population. A study of indoor house dust and dryer lint of 16 homes found high levels of all 22 different PBDE congeners tested for in all samples. Recent studies suggest that contaminated house dust, not food, may be the major source of PBDE in the body. One study estimated that ingestion of house dust accounts for up to 82% of humans&#x27; PBDE body burden.

It has been shown that contaminated house dust is a primary source of lead in young children&#x27;s bodies. It may be that babies and toddlers ingest more contaminated house dust than the adults they live with, and therefore have much higher levels of pollutants in their systems.

=== Cosmetics and personal care products ===
Consumer goods are another potential source of exposure to endocrine disruptors. An analysis of the composition of 42 household cleaning and personal care products versus 43 &quot;chemical-free&quot; products has been performed. The products contained 55 different chemical compounds: 50 were found in the 42 conventional samples representing 170 product types, while 41 were detected in 43 &quot;chemical-free&quot; samples representing 39 product types. Parabens, a class of chemicals that has been associated with reproductive-tract issues, were detected in seven of the &quot;chemical-free&quot; products, including three sunscreens that did not list parabens on the label. Vinyl products such as shower curtains were found to contain more than 10% by weight of the compound DEHP, which when present in dust has been associated with asthma and wheezing in children. The risk of exposure to EDCs increases as products, both conventional and &quot;chemical-free&quot;, are used in combination. &quot;If a consumer used the alternative surface cleaner, tub and tile cleaner, laundry detergent, bar soap, shampoo and conditioner, facial cleanser and lotion, and toothpaste [he or she] would potentially be exposed to at least 19 compounds: 2 parabens, 3 phthalates, MEA, DEA, 5 alkylphenols, and 7 fragrances.&quot;

An analysis of the endocrine-disrupting chemicals in Old Order Mennonite women in mid-pregnancy determined that they have much lower levels in their systems than the general population. Mennonites eat mostly fresh, unprocessed foods, farm without pesticides, and use few or no cosmetics or personal care products. One woman who had reported using hairspray and perfume had high levels of monoethyl phthalate, while the other women all had levels below detection. Three women who reported being in a car or truck within 48 hours of providing a urine sample had higher levels of diethylhexyl phthalate, which is found in polyvinyl chloride and is used in car interiors.

=== Clothing ===
A more recent discussion around exposure to EDCs has been around clothing.

Greenpeace has reported on endocrine-disrupting chemicals in clothing since 2011. In 2013, Greenpeace found detectable levels of phthalates in 33 out of 35 printed articles of clothing from a global sample. A particularly high level of DEHP was found in a t-shirt from Primark Germany, and a high level of DINP was found in a baby one-piece from American Apparel. PFCs were commonly found in swimwear and waterproof clothing. NPEs were found in most clothing articles as well.

A study by Greenpeace Germany published in 2014 again found high levels of phthalates in athletic gear. The print of a t-shirt produced in Argentine contained phthalate levels as high as 15%, while a pair of gloves contained 6% phthalates. The study also found high levels of PFAS, nonoxynols and dimethylformamide in shoes and boots.

In research published in 2019, Li et al. stated that dermal absorption was the main route for phthalate exposure in infants, including through clothing. It was found that laundering could not remove phthalates completely. Out of the six different types of phthalates that were measured, DEHP and DBP were found to be particularly present in infant clothing.

Tang et al. published research in 2019 that found all 15 different phthalates that were measured in preschoolers&#x27; clothing. Levels were largely independent of country of manufacture though they differed by garment type, fabric composition, and garment color. It was found that &quot;when children wore trousers, long-sleeved shirts, briefs and socks at the same time, the reproductive risks exceeded acceptable level&quot;.

In a review of 120 articles from 2014 to 2023 about phthalates in clothing, it was found that while screen printing ink, vinyl patches and synthetic leather may contain 30–60% phthalates, waterproof items such as infant mattress covers also contained very high levels of these chemicals. It was also noted that manufacturers work to replace more regulated substances, such as DEHP, with newer ones, that may not yet be as tightly regulated.

=== Environment ===
Additives added to plastics during manufacturing may leach into the environment after the plastic item is discarded; additives in microplastics in the ocean leach into ocean water and in plastics in landfills may escape and leach into the soil and then into groundwater.

==Types==
All people are exposed to chemicals with estrogenic effects in their everyday life, because endocrine disrupting chemicals are found in low doses in thousands of products. Chemicals commonly detected in people include DDT, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), bisphenol A (BPA), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and a variety of phthalates. In fact, almost all plastic products, including those advertised as BPA-free, have been found to leach endocrine-disrupting chemicals. In a 2011, study it was found that some BPA-free products released more endocrine-active chemicals than the BPA-containing products. Other forms of endocrine disruptors are phytoestrogens (plant hormones).

=== Xenoestrogens ===
Xenoestrogens are a type of xenohormone that imitates estrogen. Synthetic xenoestrogens include widely used industrial compounds, such as PCBs, BPA and phthalates, which have estrogenic effects on a living organism.

==== Alkylphenols ====
Alkylphenols are xenoestrogens. The European Union has implemented sales and use restrictions on certain applications in which nonylphenols are used because of their alleged &quot;toxicity, persistence, and the liability to bioaccumulate&quot; but the United States Environmental Protections Agency (EPA) has taken a slower approach to make sure that action is based on &quot;sound science&quot;.

The long-chain alkylphenols are used extensively as precursors to the detergents, as additives for fuels and lubricants, polymers, and as components in phenolic resins. These compounds are also used as building block chemicals that are also used in making fragrances, thermoplastic elastomers, antioxidants, oil field chemicals and fire retardant materials. Through the downstream use in making alkylphenolic resins, alkylphenols are also found in tires, adhesives, coatings, carbonless copy paper and high performance rubber products. They have been used in industry for over 40 years.

Certain alkylphenols are degradation products from nonionic detergents. Nonylphenol is considered to be a low-level endocrine disruptor owing to its tendency to mimic estrogen.

==== Bisphenol A (BPA) ====

Bisphenol A is commonly found in plastic bottles, plastic food containers, dental materials, and the linings of metal food and infant formula cans. Another exposure comes from receipt paper commonly used at grocery stores and restaurants, because today the paper is commonly coated with a BPA containing clay for printing purposes.

BPA is a known endocrine disruptor, and numerous studies have found that laboratory animals exposed to low levels of it have elevated rates of diabetes, mammary and prostate cancers, decreased sperm count, reproductive problems, early puberty, obesity, and neurological problems. To expand on the reproductive problems faced by women exposed to BPA. Studies in the US have shown that healthy women without any fertility problems found that urinary BPA was unrelated to time of pregnancy despite a shorter luteal phase (second part of the menstrual cycle) being reported. Additional studies have been conducted in fertility centers say that BPA exposure is correlation with lower ovarian reserves. To combat this, most women will undergo IVF to help with the poor ovarian stimulation response; seemingly all of them have elevated levels of BPA in the urinary tract. Median conjugation of BPA concentrations were higher in those who did have a miscarriage compared to those who had a live birth. All of these studies show that BPA can have an effect on ovarian functions and the pivotal early part of conception. One study did show racial or ethnic differences as Asian women were found to have an increased oocyte maturity rate, but all of the women had significantly lower concentration of BPA in the study. Early developmental stages appear to be the period of greatest sensitivity to its effects, and some studies have linked prenatal exposure to later physical and neurological difficulties. Regulatory bodies have determined safety levels for humans, but those safety levels are currently being questioned or are under review as a result of new scientific studies. A 2011 cross-sectional study that investigated the number of chemicals pregnant women are exposed to in the U.S. found BPA in 96% of women.
In 2010 the World Health Organization expert panel recommended no new regulations limiting or banning the use of bisphenol A, stating that &quot;initiation of public health measures would be premature.&quot;

In August 2008, the U.S. FDA issued a draft reassessment, reconfirming their initial opinion that, based on scientific evidence, BPA is safe. However, in October 2008, FDA&#x27;s advisory Science Board concluded that the Agency&#x27;s assessment was &quot;flawed&quot; and had not proven the chemical to be safe for formula-fed infants. In January 2010, the FDA issued a report indicating that, due to findings of recent studies that used novel approaches in testing for subtle effects, both the National Toxicology Program at the National Institutes of Health as well as the FDA have some level of concern regarding the possible effects of BPA on the brain and behavior of fetuses, infants and younger children. In 2012 the FDA did ban the use of BPA in baby bottles; however, the Environmental Working Group called the ban &quot;purely cosmetic&quot;. In a statement they said, &quot;If the agency truly wants to prevent people from being exposed to this toxic chemical associated with a variety of serious and chronic conditions it should ban its use in cans of infant formula, food and beverages.&quot; The Natural Resources Defense Council called the move inadequate saying, the FDA needs to ban BPA from all food packaging. In a statement a FDA spokesman said the agency&#x27;s action was not based on safety concerns and that &quot;the agency continues to support the safety of BPA for use in products that hold food.&quot;

A program initiated by NIEHS, NTP, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (named CLARITY-BPA) found no effect of chronic exposure to BPA on rats and the FDA considers currently authorized uses of BPA to be safe for consumers.

The Environmental Protection Agency set a reference dose for BPA at 50 μg/kg/day for mammals, although exposure to doses lower than the reference dose has been shown to affect both male and female reproductive systems.

===Bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF)===

Bisphenol S and Bisphenol F are analogs of bisphenol A. They are commonly found in thermal receipts, plastics, and household dust.

Traces of BPS have also been found in personal care products. It is more presently being used because of the ban of BPA. BPS is used in place of BPA in BPA-free items. However, BPS and BPF have been shown to be endocrine disruptors as much as BPA.

=== DDT ===


Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was first used as a pesticide against Colorado potato beetles on crops beginning in 1936. An increase in the incidence of malaria, epidemic typhus, dysentery, and typhoid fever led to its use against the mosquitoes, lice, and houseflies that carried these diseases. Before World War II, pyrethrum, an extract of a flower from Japan, had been used to control these insects and the diseases they can spread. During World War II, Japan stopped exporting pyrethrum, forcing the search for an alternative. Fearing an epidemic outbreak of typhus, every British and American soldier was issued DDT, who used it to routinely dust beds, tents, and barracks all over the world.

DDT was approved for general, non-military use after the war ended. It became used worldwide to increase monoculture crop yields that were threatened by pest infestation, and to reduce the spread of malaria which had a high mortality rate in many parts of the world. Its use for agricultural purposes has since been prohibited by national legislation of most countries, while its use as a control against malaria vectors is permitted, as specifically stated by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.

As early as 1946, the harmful effects of DDT on birds, beneficial insects, fish, and marine invertebrates were seen in the environment. The most infamous example of these effects were seen in the eggshells of large predatory birds, which did not develop to be thick enough to support the adult bird sitting on them. Further studies found DDT in high concentrations in carnivores all over the world, the result of biomagnification through the food chain. Twenty years after its widespread use, DDT was found trapped in ice samples taken from Antarctic snow, suggesting wind and water are another means of environmental transport. Recent studies show the historical record of DDT deposition on remote glaciers in the Himalayas.

More than sixty years ago when biologists began to study the effects of DDT on laboratory animals, it was discovered that DDT interfered with reproductive development. Recent studies suggest DDT may inhibit the proper development of female reproductive organs that adversely affects reproduction into maturity. Additional studies suggest that a marked decrease in fertility in adult males may be due to DDT exposure. Most recently, it has been suggested that exposure to DDT in utero can increase a child&#x27;s risk of childhood obesity. DDT is still used as anti-malarial insecticide in Africa and parts of Southeast Asia in limited quantities.

=== Polychlorinated biphenyls ===
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of chlorinated compounds used as industrial coolants and lubricants. PCBs are created by heating benzene, a byproduct of gasoline refining, with chlorine.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlMarch/April 2001 Sierra Magazine - Sierra Club&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They were first manufactured commercially by the Swann Chemical Company in 1927. In 1933, the health effects of direct PCB exposure was seen in those who worked with the chemicals at the manufacturing facility in Alabama. In 1935, Monsanto acquired the company, taking over US production and licensing PCB manufacturing technology internationally.

General Electric was one of the largest US companies to incorporate PCBs into manufactured equipment. Between 1952 and 1977, the New York GE plant had dumped more than 500,000 pounds of PCB waste into the Hudson River. PCBs were first discovered in the environment far from its industrial use by scientists in Sweden studying DDT.

The effects of acute exposure to PCBs were well known within the companies who used Monsanto&#x27;s PCB formulation who saw the effects on their workers who came into contact with it regularly. Direct skin contact results in a severe acne-like condition called chloracne. Exposure increases the risk of skin cancer, liver cancer, and brain cancer. Monsanto tried for years to downplay the health problems related to PCB exposure in order to continue sales.

The detrimental health effects of PCB exposure to humans became undeniable when two separate incidents of contaminated cooking oil poisoned thousands of residents in Japan (Yushō disease, 1968) and Taiwan (Yu-cheng disease, 1979), leading to a worldwide ban on PCB use in 1977. Recent studies show the endocrine interference of certain PCB congeners is toxic to the liver and thyroid, increases childhood obesity in children exposed prenatally, and may increase the risk of developing diabetes.

PCBs in the environment may also be related to reproductive and infertility problems in wildlife. In Alaska, it is thought that they may contribute to reproductive defects, infertility and antler malformation in some deer populations. Declines in the populations of otters and sea lions may also be partially due to their exposure to PCBs, the insecticide DDT, other persistent organic pollutants. Bans and restrictions on the use of EDCs have been associated with a reduction in health problems and the recovery of some wildlife populations.

=== Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ===
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of compounds found in flame retardants used in plastic cases of televisions and computers, electronics, carpets, lighting, bedding, clothing, car components, foam cushions and other textiles. Potential health concern: PBDEs are structurally very similar to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and have similar neurotoxic effects. Research has correlated halogenated hydrocarbons, such as PCBs, with neurotoxicity. PBDEs are similar in chemical structure to PCBs, and it has been suggested that PBDEs act by the same mechanism as PCBs.

In the 1930s and 1940s, the plastics industry developed technologies to create a variety of plastics with broad applications. Once World War II began, the US military used these new plastic materials to improve weapons, protect equipment, and to replace heavy components in aircraft and vehicles. After WWII, manufacturers saw the potential plastics could have in many industries, and plastics were incorporated into new consumer product designs. Plastics began to replace wood and metal in existing products as well, and today plastics are the most widely used manufacturing materials.

By the 1960s, all homes were wired with electricity and had numerous electrical appliances. Cotton had been the dominant textile used to produce home furnishings, but now home furnishings were composed of mostly synthetic materials. More than 500 billion cigarettes were consumed each year in the 1960s, as compared to less than 3 billion per year in the beginning of the twentieth century. When combined with high-density living, the potential for home fires was higher in the 1960s than it had ever been in the US. By the late 1970s, approximately 6000 people in the US died each year in home fires.

In 1972, in response to this situation, the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control was created to study the fire problem in the US. In 1973 they published their findings in &quot;America Burning&quot;, a 192-page report that made recommendations to increase fire prevention. Most of the recommendations dealt with fire prevention education and improved building engineering, such as the installation of fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. The Commission expected that with the recommendations, a 5% reduction in fire losses could be expected each year, halving the annual losses within 14 years.

Historically, treatments with alum and borax were used to reduce the flammability of fabric and wood, as far back as Roman times. Since it is a non-absorbent material once created, flame retardant chemicals are added to plastic during the polymerization reaction when it is formed. Organic compounds based on halogens like bromine and chlorine are used as the flame retardant additive in plastics, and in fabric based textiles as well. The widespread use of brominated flame retardants may be due to the push from Great Lakes Chemical Corporation (GLCC) to profit from its huge investment in bromine. In 1992, the world market consumed approximately 150,000 tonnes of bromine-based flame retardants, and GLCC produced 30% of the world supply.

PBDEs have the potential to disrupt thyroid hormone balance and contribute to a variety of neurological and developmental deficits, including low intelligence and learning disabilities. Many of the most common PBDE&#x27;s were banned in the European Union in 2006. Studies with rodents have suggested that even brief exposure to PBDEs can cause developmental and behavior problems in juvenile rodents and exposure interferes with proper thyroid hormone regulation.

=== Phthalates ===

Phthalates are found in some soft toys, flooring, medical equipment, cosmetics and air fresheners. They are of potential health concern because they are known to disrupt the endocrine system of animals, and some research has implicated them in the rise of birth defects of the male reproductive system.

Although an expert panel has concluded that there is &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; that they can harm the reproductive system of infants, California, Washington state, and Europe have banned them from toys. One phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), used in medical tubing, catheters and blood bags, may harm sexual development in male infants. In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration released a public report which cautioned against exposing male babies to DEHP. Although there are no direct human studies the FDA report states: &quot;Exposure to DEHP has produced a range of adverse effects in laboratory animals, but of greatest concern are effects on the development of the male reproductive system and production of normal sperm in young animals. In view of the available animal data, precautions should be taken to limit the exposure of the developing male to DEHP&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlUS FDA/CDRH: FDA Public Health Notification: PVC Devices Containing the Plasticizer DEHP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, phthalates may play a causal role in disrupting masculine neurological development when exposed prenatally.

Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) has also disrupted insulin and glucagon signaling in animal models.

=== Perfluorooctanoic acid ===

PFOA is a stable chemical that has been used for its grease-, fire-, and water-resistant properties in products such as non-stick pan coatings, furniture, firefighter equipment, industrial, and other common household items. There is evidence to suggest that PFOA is an endocrine disruptor affecting male and female reproductive systems. PFOA delivered to pregnant rats produced male offspring with decreased levels of 3-β and 17-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, a gene that transcribes for proteins involved in the production of sperm. Adult women have exhibited low progesterone and androstenedione production when exposed to PFOA, leading to menstrual and reproductive health issues.
PFOA exerts hormonal effects including alteration of thyroid hormone levels. Blood serum levels of PFOA were associated with an increased time to pregnancy—or &quot;infertility&quot;—in a 2009 study. PFOA exposure is associated with decreased semen quality. PFOA appeared to act as an endocrine disruptor by a potential mechanism on breast maturation in young girls. A C8 Science Panel status report noted an association between exposure in girls and a later onset of puberty.

=== Other suspected endocrine disruptors ===

Some other examples of putative EDCs are polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDDs) and -furans (PCDFs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenol derivatives and a number of pesticides (most prominent being organochlorine insecticides like endosulfan, kepone (chlordecone) and DDT and its derivatives, the herbicide atrazine, and the fungicide vinclozolin), the contraceptive 17-alpha ethinylestradiol, as well as naturally occurring phytoestrogens such as genistein and mycoestrogens such as zearalenone.

The molting in crustaceans is an endocrine-controlled process. In the marine penaeid shrimp &quot;Litopenaeus vannamei&quot;, exposure to endosulfan resulted increased susceptibility to acute toxicity and increased mortalities in the postmolt stage of the shrimp.

Many sunscreens contain oxybenzone, a chemical blocker that provides broad-spectrum UV coverage, yet is subject to a lot of controversy due its potential estrogenic effect in humans.

Tributyltin (TBT) are organotin compounds. For 40 years TBT was used as a biocide in anti-fouling paint, commonly known as bottom paint. TBT has been shown to impact invertebrate and vertebrate development, disrupting the endocrine system, resulting in masculinization, lower survival rates, as well as many health problems in mammals.

==Temporal trends of body burden==
Since being banned, the average human body burdens of DDT and PCB have been declining. Since their ban in 1972, the PCB body burden in 2009 is one-hundredth of what it was in the early 1980s. On the other hand, monitoring programs of European breast milk samples have shown that PBDE levels are increasing. An analysis of PBDE content in breast milk samples from Europe, Canada, and the US shows that levels are 40 times higher for North American women than for Swedish women, and that levels in North America are doubling every two to six years.

It has been discussed that the long-term slow decline in average body temperature observed since the beginning of the industrial revolution may result from disrupted thyroid hormone signalling.

== Animal models ==

Endocrine disruptors affect complex metabolic, reproductive, and neuroendocrine systems, they cannot be modeled in in vitro cell based assay and therefore are important to study in order to understand their risk on humans and wildlife. Consequently, animal models are important for access the risk of endocrine disrupting chemicals. Some common animal models used for assessing these risks are mice, fish egg yolks, and frogs.

===Mice===
There are multiple lines of genetically engineered mice used for lab studies, in this case the lines can be used as population-based genetic foundations. For instance, one population is named Multi-parent and can be a Collaborative Cross (CC) or Diversity Outbred (DO). These mice, while both from the same eight founder strains, have distinct differences.

The eight founder strains combine strains that are wild-derived (with high genetic diversity) and historically significant biomedical research bred strains. Each genetically differential line is important in EDCs response and also almost all biological processes and traits.

The CC population consists of 83 inbred mouse strains that over many generations in labs came from the eight founder strains. These inbred mice have recombinant genomes that are developed to ensure every strain is equally related, this eradicates population structure and can result in false positives with qualitative trait locus (QTL) mapping.

While DO mice have the identical alleles to the CC mice population, there are two major differences: every individual is unique, allowing for hundreds of individuals to be applied in one mapping study, making DO mice an extremely useful tool for determining genetic relationships; however, DO individuals cannot be reproduced.

===Transgenic===

These rodents, mainly mice, have been bred by inserting other genes from another organism to make transgenic lines (thousands of lines) of rodents. The most recent tool used to do this is CRISPR/Cas9, which allows this process to be done more efficiently.

Genes may be manipulated in a particular cell populations if done under the correct conditions. For endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) research, these rodents have become an important tool to the point where they can produce humanized mouse models. Additionally, scientists use gene knockout lines of mice in order to study how certain mechanisms work when impacted by EDCs. Transgenic rodents are an important tool for studies involving the mechanisms that are impacted by EDC but take a long time to produce and are expensive. Additionally, the genes aimed at for knockout are not always successfully targeted resulting in incomplete knockout of a gene or off-target expression.

===Social models===

Experiments (gene by environment) with these relatively new rodent models may be able to discover if there are mechanisms that EDCs could impact in the social decline in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other behavioral disorders. This is because prairie and pine voles are socially monogamous, making them a better model for human social behaviors and development in relation to EDCs. Additionally the prairie vole genome has been sequenced making it feasible to do the experiments mentioned above. These voles can be compared to montane and meadow voles who are socially promiscuous and solitary, when looking at how different species have various forms of development and social brain structure. Both monogamous and promiscuous mice species have been used in these types of experiments, for more information studies can expand on this topic. More complex models that have systems that are as close as possible to humans are being looked at. Looking back at more common rodent models, for instance the common ASD mouse, is helpful but does not fully encompass the entirety of a model of human social behaviors.

===Zebrafish===

The endocrine systems between mammals and fish are similar; because of this, zebrafish (&quot;Danio rerio&quot;) are a popular lab choice. Zebrafish work well as a model organism, part of which can be attributed to the fact that researchers are able to study them starting from the embryo, as the embryo is nearly transparent. Additionally, zebrafish have DNA sex markers, which allows biologists to individually assign sex to fish; this is particularly important when studying endocrine disruptors as the disruptors can affect how, among other things, the sex organs work. If there is sperm in the ovaries later on through testing, it can then be pinned to the chemical without the chance of it being a genetic abnormality since the sex was determined by the researcher. Besides zebrafish being readily available, and easy to study through different life stages, their genes are similar to humans&#x27;—70% of human genes have a zebrafish counterpart and 84% of disease genes in humans have a zebrafish counterpart. Also important is the fact that the vast majority of endocrine disruptors end up in waterways; it is important to know how the disruptors affect fish, which are model organisms as well.

The zebrafish embryos are transparent, relatively small fish (larvae are less than a few millimeters in size). This allows scientists to view the larvae (in vivo) without killing them to study how their organs develop, in particular neurodevelopment and transport of presumed endocrine-disrupting chemicals, thus how their development is impacted by certain chemicals. As a model, they have simple modes of endocrine disruption, along with homologous physiological, sensory, anatomical and signal-transduction mechanisms similar to mammals. Another helpful tool available to scientists is their recorded genome along with multiple transgenic lines accessible for breeding. Zebrafish and mammalian genomes when compared have prominent similarities with about 80% of human genes expressed in the fish. Additionally, zebrafish are also fairly inexpensive to breed and house in a lab partly due to their shorter lifespan and being able to house more of them compared to mammalian models.

==Directions of research==
Research on endocrine disruptors is challenged by five complexities requiring special trial designs and sophisticated study protocols:
# The &quot;dissociation of space&quot; means that, although disruptors may act by a common pathway via hormone receptors, their impact may also be mediated by effects at the levels of transport proteins, deiodinases, degradation of hormones or modified setpoints of feedback loops (i.e. allostatic load).
# The &quot;dissociation of time&quot; may ensue from the fact that unwanted effects may be triggered in a small time window in the embryonal or fetal period, but consequences may ensue decades later or even in the generation of grandchildren.
# The &quot;dissociation of substance&quot; results from additive, multiplicative or more complex interactions of disruptors in combination that yield fundamentally different effects from that of the respective substances alone.
# The &quot;dissociation of dose&quot; implies that dose-effect relationships use to be nonlinear and sometimes even U-shaped, so that low or medium doses may have stronger effects than high doses.
# The &quot;dissociation of sex&quot; reflects the fact that effects may be different depending on whether embryos or fetuses are female or male.

==Legal approach==

===United States===
The multitude of possible endocrine disruptors are technically regulated in the United States by many laws, including the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Food Quality Protection Act, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean Air Act.

The Congress of the United States has improved the evaluation and regulation process of drugs and other chemicals. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996 simultaneously provided the first legislative direction requiring the EPA to address endocrine disruption through establishment of a program for screening and testing of chemical substances.

In 1998, the EPA announced the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program by establishment of a framework for priority setting, screening and testing more than 85,000 chemicals in commerce. While the Food Quality Protection Act only required the EPA to screen pesticides for potential to produce effects similar to estrogens in humans, it also gave the EPA the authority to screen other types of chemicals and endocrine effects. Based on recommendations from an advisory panel, the agency expanded the screening program to include male hormones, the thyroid system, and effects on fish and other wildlife. The basic concept behind the program is that prioritization will be based on existing information about chemical uses, production volume, structure-activity and toxicity. Screening is done by use of &quot;in vitro&quot; test systems (by examining, for instance, if an agent interacts with the estrogen receptor or the androgen receptor) and via the use of in animal models, such as development of tadpoles and uterine growth in prepubertal rodents. Full-scale testing will examine effects not only in mammals (rats) but also in a number of other species (frogs, fish, birds and invertebrates). Since the theory involves the effects of these substances on a functioning system, animal testing is essential for scientific validity, but has been opposed by animal rights groups. Similarly, proof that these effects occur in humans would require human testing, and such testing also has opposition.

After failing to meet several deadlines to begin testing, the EPA finally announced that they were ready to begin the process of testing dozens of chemical entities that are suspected endocrine disruptors early in 2007, eleven years after the program was announced. When the final structure of the tests was announced there was objection to their design. Critics have charged that the entire process has been compromised by chemical company interference. In 2005, the EPA appointed a panel of experts to conduct an open peer-review of the program and its orientation. Their results found that &quot;the long-term goals and science questions in the EDC program are appropriate&quot;, however this study was conducted over a year before the EPA announced the final structure of the screening program. The EPA is still finding it difficult to execute a credible and efficient endocrine testing program.

As of 2016, the EPA had estrogen screening results for 1,800 chemicals.

===Europe===
In 2013, a number of pesticides containing endocrine disrupting chemicals were in draft EU criteria to be banned. On 2 May, US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiators insisted the EU drop the criteria. They stated that a risk-based approach should be taken on regulation. Later the same day Catherine Day wrote to Karl Falkenberg asking for the criteria to be removed.

The European Commission had been to set criteria by December 2013 identifying endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in thousands of products—including disinfectants, pesticides and toiletries—that have been linked to cancers, birth defects and development disorders in children. However, the body delayed the process, prompting Sweden to state that it would sue the commission in May 2014—blaming chemical industry lobbying for the disruption.

&quot;This delay is due to the European chemical lobby, which put pressure again on different commissioners. Hormone disrupters are becoming a huge problem. In some places in Sweden we see double-sexed fish. We have scientific reports on how this affects fertility of young boys and girls, and other serious effects,&quot; Swedish Environment Minister Lena Ek told the AFP, noting that Denmark had also demanded action.

In November 2014, the Copenhagen-based Nordic Council of Ministers released its own independent report that estimated the impact of environmental EDCs on male reproductive health, and the resulting cost to public health systems. It concluded that EDCs likely cost health systems across the EU anywhere from 59 million to 1.18 billion Euros a year, noting that even this represented only &quot;a fraction of the endocrine related diseases&quot;.

In 2020, the EU published their Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability which is concerned with a green transition of the chemical industry away from xenohormones and other hazardous chemicals.

== Environmental and human body cleanup ==
There is evidence that once a pollutant is no longer in use, or once its use is heavily restricted, the human body burden of that pollutant declines. Through the efforts of several large-scale monitoring programs, the most prevalent pollutants in the human population are fairly well known. The first step in reducing the body burden of these pollutants is eliminating or phasing out their production.

The second step toward lowering human body burden is awareness of and potentially labeling foods that are likely to contain high amounts of pollutants. This strategy has worked in the past—pregnant and nursing women are cautioned against eating seafood that is known to accumulate high levels of mercury.

The most challenging aspect of this problem is discovering how to eliminate these compounds from the environment and where to focus remediation efforts. Even pollutants no longer in production persist in the environment and bio-accumulate in the food chain. An understanding of how these chemicals, once in the environment, move through ecosystems, is essential to designing ways to isolate and remove them. Global efforts have been made to label the most common POPs routinely found in the environment through usage of chemicals like insecticides. The twelve main POPs have been evaluated and placed in a demographic so as to streamline the information around the general population. Such facilitation has allowed nations around the world to effectively work on the testing and reduction of the usage of these chemicals. With an effort to reduce the presence of such chemicals in the environment, they can reduce the leaching of POPs into food sources which contaminate the animals commercially fed to the U.S. population.

Many persistent organic compounds, PCB, DDT and PBDE included, accumulate in river and marine sediments. Several processes are currently being used by the EPA to clean up heavily polluted areas, as outlined in their Green Remediation program.

Naturally occurring microbes that degrade PCB congeners to remediate contaminated areas are utilized.

There are many success stories of cleanup efforts of large heavily contaminated Superfund sites. A landfill in Austin, Texas, contaminated with illegally dumped VOCs was restored in a year to a wetland and educational park.

A US uranium enrichment site that was contaminated with uranium and PCBs was cleaned up with high tech equipment used to find the pollutants within the soil. The soil and water at a polluted wetlands site were cleaned of VOCs, PCBs and lead, native plants were installed as biological filters, and a community program was implemented to ensure ongoing monitoring of pollutant concentrations in the area. These case studies are encouraging due to the short amount of time needed to remediate the site and the high level of success achieved.

Studies suggest that bisphenol A, certain PCBs, and phthalate compounds are preferentially eliminated from the human body through sweat. Although some pollutants like bisphenol A (BPA) are preferentially eliminated from the human body through sweat, recent scientific advances have been made to increase the rate of elimination of pollutants from the human body. For example, BPA removal techniques have been proposed that use enzymes such as laccase and peroxidase to degrade BPA into less harmful compounds. Another technique for BPA removal is the use of highly reactive radicals for degradation.

Human exposure may cause some health effects, such as lower IQ and adult obesity. These effects may lead to lost productivity, disability, or premature death in some people. One source estimated that, within the European Union, this economic effect might have about twice the economic impact as the effects caused by mercury and lead contamination.

The socio-economic burden of EDC-associated health effects for the European Union was estimated based on currently available literature in 2016 and considering the uncertainties with respect to causality with EDCs and corresponding health-related costs to be in the range of €46 billion to €288 billion per year.

<text>U.S. Route 258 (US 258) is a spur of US 58 in the U.S. states of North Carolina and Virginia. The U.S. Highway runs from US 17 Business and NC 24 Business in Jacksonville, North Carolina north to Virginia State Route 143 (SR 143) at Fort Monroe in Hampton, Virginia. In North Carolina, US 258 connects Jacksonville with the Inner Banks communities of Kinston, Snow Hill, Farmville, Tarboro, and Murfreesboro. The U.S. Highway continues through the Virginia city of Franklin, where the highway intersects US 58, and the town of Smithfield on its way to the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. US 258 crosses the James River on the James River Bridge and follows Mercury Boulevard through Newport News and Hampton.

==Route description==

===Jacksonville to Kinston===
US 258 begins at a directional intersection with US 17 Business and NC 24 Business in Jacksonville. The business routes head east together as Marine Boulevard toward downtown Jacksonville; US 17 Business heads southwest along Wilmington Highway to meet up with US 17 along the freeway bypass of Jacksonville that also carries NC 24 and leads to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune. US 258 and NC 24 Business run concurrently along Richlands Highway, a five-lane road with center turn lane, west to the western terminus of the freeway, a four-way intersection at which NC 24 begins to run concurrently with US 258; the west leg of the intersection is NC 53 (Burgaw Highway). The U.S. Highway and state highway parallel the New River through a junction with the southern end of NC 111 (Lake Catherine Road) to just south of Richlands, where the highways cross the river and pass through that town. The highways head west out of the town as Kinston Highway. West of Richlands NC 24 continues west as five-lane Beulaville Highway toward Beulaville while US 258 curves north along Kinston Highway, which reduces to two lanes.

US 258 briefly passes through Jones County, where the highway intersects NC 41 at Hargetts Crossroads before entering Lenoir County. The U.S. Highway crosses the Trent River and passes through Woodington prior to its junction with US 70 and NC 58 (New Bern Road) just south of the Neuse River in Kinston. The roadway continues straight as Queen Street, which carries NC 58, US 70 Business, and US 258 Business across the river into downtown Kinston. US 258 runs concurrently northwest along the US 70 four-lane divided highway; the two U.S. Highways have an intersection with NC 11 and NC 55 (Old Pink Hill Road) before crossing the river and meeting the other end of the highways&#x27; business routes, which follow Vernon Avenue. US 258 and US 70 follow Vernon Avenue a short distance west to where US 258 turns north. The U.S. Highway has an at-grade crossing with the North Carolina Railroad and meets the western end of NC 148 (C.F. Harvey Parkway), which serves Kinston Regional Jetport and the North Carolina Global TransPark.

===Kinston to Tarboro===
US 258 crosses Wheat Swamp into Greene County. The U.S. Highway intersects NC 58 (Kingold Boulevard) again south of Snow Hill, which the highway enters along 2nd Street. In the center of town, US 258 turns onto Greene Street and crosses Contentnea Creek, then has a four-way intersection with US 13, NC 91, and NC 903. The roadway continues north as NC 91; US 258 begins to run northeast concurrently with US 13 and NC 903. NC 903 diverges from the two U.S. Highways west of Maury; the U.S. Highways intersect NC 123 in the hamlet of Lizzie. US 258 and US 13 diverge north of Sandy Run. US 258 crosses Middle Swamp into Pitt County and intersects US 264 Alternate south of Farmville. US 258 and US 264 Alternate briefly run together east for before US 258 heads north again. US 258 comes to a diamond interchange with I-587 and US 264 (John P. East Memorial Highway) and Wesley Chapel Road northeast of the center of Farmville. US 258 joins the I-587 and US 264 freeway west for about before exiting at another diamond interchange northwest of town. The former routing of the highway through Farmville is now U.S. Route 258 Business.

US 258 intersects NC 222 (Wilson Street) in Fountain before entering Edgecombe County. The U.S. Highway intersects NC 124 in Crisp and NC 42 and NC 43 east of Pinetops, then parallels the Tar River to Tarboro. South of downtown Tarboro, the U.S. Highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with the US 64 freeway and Western Boulevard, which features US 64 Alternate, NC 111, and NC 122. US 258 and the two state highways cross the Tar River on the freeway, then exit US 64 onto Mutual Boulevard at a partial interchange on the east side of the river in Princeville. There is no access from southbound US 258 to eastbound US 64 or from westbound US 64 to northbound US 258. The missing movements are provided via NC 33, which the three highways intersect in the center of town. A short distance to the east, NC 111 diverges on Greenwood Boulevard. US 258 and NC 122 parallel the river north before the two routes diverge northeast of Tarboro.

===Tarboro to Franklin===

US 258 intersects NC 97 in the hamlet of Lawrence before the highway enters Halifax County. The U.S. Highway crosses Deep Creek before becoming the Main Street of Scotland Neck. US 258 becomes concurrent with NC 125 at the south edge of the town and with NC 903, which enters from the east on 9th Street, in the center of town. NC 125 and NC 903 exit town to the west on 12th Street. US 258 has a junction with NC 561 north of Scotland Neck; the two highways cross the Roanoke River into Northampton County. The two highways meet the northern end of NC 308 just before entering Rich Square as Main Street. In the center of Rich Square, US 258 intersects NC 305 (Jackson Street), which exits town to the east with NC 561. The U.S. Highway has an at-grade crossing of the North Carolina and Virginia Railroad southwest of Woodland, where the highway, marked as Main Street, has a concurrency with NC 35 between Spruce Street and Linden Street.

North of Woodland, US 258 crosses Potecasi Creek and parallels the Northampton–Hertford county line north to Murfreesboro. The U.S. Highway joins US 158 east into Hertford County on its four-lane divided southern bypass of the town while the roadway continues straight as US 158 Business (Main Street). Southeast of the town, US 258 leaves US 158 and joins NC 11 on Beechwood Boulevard, which the two highways follow to NC 11&#x27;s northern terminus at US 158 Business. US 258 leaves Murfreesboro on Virginia Boulevard, which crosses the Meherrin River and heads northeast through Como to the state line, where the highway enters Southampton County, Virginia. The U.S. Highway, now named Smiths Ferry Road, uses the General Vaughan Bridge to cross the Nottoway River a short distance north of its confluence with the Blackwater River to form the Chowan River.

US 258 meets the western end of SR 189 (Quay Road) before reaching its diamond interchange with US 58 (Southampton Parkway) south of the independent city of Franklin. US 258 joins US 58 on a four-lane freeway heading east while the roadway continues north into the city as US 258 Business (South Street). US 258 and US 58 head southeast through a widely spaced partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 714 (Pretlow Street) before crossing the Blackwater River into the city of Suffolk. East of the river, the U.S. Highways have a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 189, which joins US 58 heading east toward Norfolk while US 258 exits the freeway and heads north, becoming Great Mill Highway on entering Isle of Wight County southeast of Franklin. When Great Mill Highway continues north toward an industrial area on the east side of Franklin, US 258 veers northeast on Camp Family Highway, crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Franklin District, and meets the northern end of US 258 Business at its intersection with US 58 Business (Carrsville Highway) just north of its grade crossing of CSX&#x27;s Portsmouth Subdivision rail line and just south of Franklin Municipal-John Beverly Rose Airport.

===Franklin to Hampton===
US 258 continues northeast as Walters Highway through the hamlet of Walters to the town of Windsor, where the highway is named Prince Boulevard, has a grade crossing of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Norfolk District rail line, and intersects US 460 (Windsor Boulevard). The U.S. Highway continues north as Courthouse Highway through the county seat of Isle of Wight to the town of Smithfield. US 258 enters the town as Main Street before joining SR 10 on the town&#x27;s bypass; Main Street continues as US 258 Business. The two-lane bypass has a diamond interchange with Fairway Drive, then crosses Cypress Creek and collects the northern end of US 258 Business, which runs concurrently with SR 10 Business on Church Street. US 258 and SR 10 continue southeast on four-lane divided Benns Church Boulevard to Benns Church, where US 258 leaves SR 10 and joins SR 32 on Brewers Neck Boulevard. The U.S. Highway and state highway follow that boulevard to Carrollton, where the highways join US 17 on Carrollton Boulevard. The three highways curve northeast and cross the James River on the James River Bridge.

US 258, US 17, and SR 32 enter the city of Newport News on Mercury Boulevard. The six-lane highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 60 (Warwick Boulevard) and crosses CSX&#x27;s Peninsula Subdivision rail line before reaching SR 143 (Jefferson Avenue), where SR 32 has its northern terminus. US 17 turns north onto Jefferson Avenue while US 258 continues east on Mercury Boulevard into the city of Hampton. At Newmarket Drive south of the former Newmarket North Mall, the U.S. Highway expands to eight lanes and passes through a heavily commercialized area. East of SR 415 (Power Plant Parkway), US 258 meets Interstate 64 at an interchange featuring a pair of flyover ramps. The U.S. Highway heads east from the Interstate concurrent with SR 134 as the highway passes between Peninsula Town Center to the north and the Hampton Coliseum to the south. At the eastern end of the heavily commercialized area, US 258 has intersections with the eastern end of SR 152 (Cunningham Drive) and Armistead Avenue, which heads south as SR 134.

US 258 crosses Newmarket Creek just west of the highway&#x27;s partial cloverleaf interchange with La Salle Avenue. The U.S. Highway reduces to six lanes at its diamond interchange with SR 278 (King Street), which serves Langley Air Force Base. US 258 becomes four lanes at its northern intersection with SR 169, which heads north as Fox Hill Road. The U.S. Highway crosses the Hampton River and curves south toward its terminus. US 258 intersects SR 351 (Pembroke Avenue) and Woodland Avenue, which leads to I-64 and downtown Hampton and where the highway reduces to a four-lane undivided street. The U.S. Highway has another junction with SR 169 (Mallory Street) in the Phoebus neighborhood of Hampton. At the east edge of Phoebus, US 258 crosses the Mill Creek estuary on a causeway and reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with the southern terminus of SR 143 (Ingalls Road) at the entrance to Fort Monroe. Ingalls Road continues south onto the former military base at Old Point Comfort that was decommissioned in September 2011.

<text>U.S. Highway 159 (US 159) is a auxiliary route of US 59. It travels from Nortonville, Kansas at US 59 to New Point, Missouri, also at US 59. The highway permits through traffic on US 59 to bypass the cities of Atchison, Kansas and Saint Joseph, Missouri, traveling instead through Falls City, Nebraska and Hiawatha, Kansas (assuming the bridge over the Missouri River is open).

===Kansas===
The southwestern end of U.S. Route 159 is in Nortonville, Kansas. It joins with U.S. Route 73 in Horton, Kansas. The two highways overlap and passing through Hiawatha, Kansas and Reserve, Kansas, stretching to the Nebraska border. The highway provides an important connection between Falls City, Nebraska and Hiawatha, Kansas, providing Nebraska residents with an alternative connection to St. Joseph, Missouri when there is a problem with the Rulo bridge.
=== Nebraska ===
U.S. Route 159 enters Nebraska through its southern border in Richardson County. It enters south of Falls City, Nebraska concurrently with U.S. Route 73. After coming up through the south end of Falls City, the U.S. Route 159 turns east (with Route 73 continuing north). After the eastbound turn, U.S. Route leaves the state at the Missouri River bridge in Rulo, Nebraska.

===Missouri===
U.S. Route 159 enters the state of Missouri crossing the Missouri River near the Rulo bridge south of Big Lake, Missouri. It crosses Interstate 29 near Fortescue, Missouri before ending at US-59 near New Point. Its total length in Missouri is approximately .

==History==
When the route was commissioned in 1934, U.S. Route 159 only went between Nortonville, Kansas and Horton, Kansas. In 1945, it was extended north to Craig, Missouri via Falls City, Nebraska. After 1975, the route in Missouri was altered to go east from the Fortescue area to what is now its current terminus near New Point, Missouri. The old route which went to Craig is now Route 111.

In 2013, a new bridge over the Missouri River, located about 650 feet south of the old Rulo Bridge, opened to traffic. In April 2019, a large portion of this route was closed for several months because of flooding of the Missouri River. The bridge and the road between Rulo, Nebraska and Missouri Route 111 was reopened in September 2019, and the remainder of the route to Interstate 29 was reopened in late October.

<text>Spellbound is a 2002 American documentary that was directed by Jeffrey Blitz. The film follows eight competitors in the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee. The film received positive reviews and won several awards, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

== Spellers ==
The spellers were Neil Kadakia, Emily Stagg, Ashley White, April DeGideo, Harry Altman, Angela Arenivar, Nupur Lala and Ted Brigham. As they appear from left to right on the DVD&#x27;s cover:

=== Neil Kadakia ===
Neil (as speller # 139) missed &quot;&quot; as &quot;helebore&quot; in the bee to get ninth place. Other words Neil spelled include: , , , , and . He was sponsored by the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;. Neil is a graduate of UC Berkeley. He is currently the COO of Greens Global, a real estate company based out of San Clemente, CA. On July 3, 2011, he married Archana Sheth, also a UC Berkeley graduate. He is also an avid chess player, and has earned over 15 chess trophies in his life. His grandfather paid 1000 people in India to pray for him.

=== Emily Stagg ===
Emily Stagg (speller # 148) was sponsored by the &quot;New Haven Register&quot; in New Haven, Connecticut and spelled: , , , , , , (spelled incorrectly as &quot;clavison&quot;). She came in 6th place. In 2006, as a junior in Carleton College, she wrote an op-ed article for the New York Times questioning the usefulness of the National Spelling Bee.

=== Ashley White ===
Ashley White (speller 149) represented &quot;The Washington Informer&quot; in Washington, DC in the spelling bee, spelling &quot;&quot; before misspelling &quot;&quot; in the third round. Following Ashley&#x27;s teenage pregnancy (she was 18), a marketing consultant who had seen the movie managed to rally support from other viewers of the documentary to help Ashley into Howard University. The proctor of the Washington Informer regional spelling bee featured in the film is Mac McGarry.

=== April DeGideo ===
April DeGideo, who lives in Ambler, Pennsylvania, participated in the 1998 and 1999 bees, in the latter of which she placed third, representing the &quot;Times Herald&quot; of Norristown, Pennsylvania. April graduated in 2007 from New York University with a degree in Journalism. She then went on to get a second degree in creative writing and later went on to publish two books. &quot;The study guide&quot;, and &quot;Where to start&quot;.

=== Harry Altman ===
Many critics who reviewed &quot;Spellbound&quot; singled out Altman (speller # 8) as its most interesting &quot;character&quot;. Roger Ebert wrote that he &quot;has so many eccentricities that he&#x27;d be comic relief in a teenage comedy... He screws his face up into so many shapes while trying to spell a word that it&#x27;s a wonder the letters can find their way to the surface.&quot; He spelled &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; over the course of the bee. In a prolonged clip, Altman was eliminated in the fourth round, on the word &quot;&quot;, which he spelled &quot;bands&quot;. He later appeared in the 2001 Bee, but was again eliminated in the fourth round. Altman went to the Academy for Engineering and Design Technology (now Bergen County Academies) in Hackensack, New Jersey. In autumn 2005, he enrolled in the University of Chicago. In 2014 Harry completed a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Michigan, focusing on integer complexity.

=== Angela Arenivar ===
Angela Arenivar represented the &quot;Amarillo Globe-News&quot; in the 1998 and 1999 bees, being eliminated in the latter during the third round. Angela graduated from Texas A&amp;M University in 2007 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Spanish and earned a master&#x27;s in Spanish from the University of New Mexico in 2009. She has taught Spanish in Texas public high schools. Angela now attends Texas A&amp;M University pursuing her Ph.D. in Hispanic Studies.

=== Nupur Lala ===
Nupur Lala was the champion of the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee (as speller # 155), spelling &quot;&quot; to win. Nupur won the bee against David Lewandowski, a speller from Indiana who misspelled &quot;opsimath.&quot; She turned down an MTV reality show that would have followed her college years. In 2003, she entered University of Michigan at Ann Arbor to study brain and cognitive sciences and pre-medical studies and graduated in 2007 with a degree in Brain, Behavior and Cognitive Science. In the fall of 2014 she entered the College of Medicine at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. She also appeared in the 2020 documentary &quot;Spelling the Dream&quot;.

=== Ted Brigham ===
Ted Brigham was speller # 1. He represented the &quot;Rolla Daily Record&quot; of Rolla, Missouri. One of the more notable stories from his experience is the congratulations posted by students on the marquee in front of his high school in which &quot;champ&quot; was misspelled (presumably as an ironic joke) as &quot;chapm&quot;. Ted misspelled &quot;&quot; in the second round, becoming the first of the eight spellers eliminated. Ted attended medical school in Kansas City, Missouri until his death in December 2007. His family chose not to disclose the circumstances of his death.

=== Other notable spellers ===
* George Thampy was speller # 245 in the bee and was mentioned several times within the film. He misspelled &quot;kirtle&quot; as &quot;curtle&quot; for third place, tying with April DeGideo. Thampy eventually won the 2000 national bee.
* David Lewandowski finished second place in the spelling bee, spelling &quot;opsimath&quot; as &quot;opsomath&quot;. After David&#x27;s mistake, Nupur spelled &quot;logorrhea&quot; to win the competition.
* Allyson Lieberman was originally slated to be featured as one of the spellers in the documentary, but her clips were ultimately left out of the film; the scene involving her can be found in the special features of the DVD. The youngest contestant in the entire 1998 bee, she misspelled &quot;purblind&quot;.
* Frances Taschuk and Ann Foley are shown in the final set of scenes prior to the last round of the spelling bee. Frances misspells &quot;acoelous&quot; and Ann &quot;quinquevir&quot;.
* Vinay Krupadev is in a scene involving Harry&#x27;s mother feeling &quot;sorry for the boy from Texas who got &#x27;yenta&#x27;&quot;. She was referring to Vinay, who is actually from Marietta, Ohio, and his pronunciation of &quot;yenta,&quot; shown in the film. He eventually spelled it &quot;yente&quot;.
* Jess Altman was mentioned in a scene by Harry Altman for being a terrific speller and that he was disappointed she didn&#x27;t make the Nationals.
* Frank Neuhauser, winner of the first National Spelling Bee, held in 1925, also appears in the film.

<doc id="903162" wikidata="Q1364147" url="?curid=903162" title="Sean Burke">
<text>Sean Burke (born January 29, 1967) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender and the current director of goaltending for the Vegas Golden Knights, with whom he won the Stanley Cup with in 2023. He played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New Jersey Devils, Hartford Whalers, Carolina Hurricanes, Vancouver Canucks, Philadelphia Flyers, Florida Panthers, Phoenix Coyotes, Tampa Bay Lightning and Los Angeles Kings between 1988 and 2007. He was born in Windsor, Ontario, but grew up in Toronto, Ontario.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Burke played in the 1980 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the St. Michael&#x27;s minor ice hockey team from Toronto.

Burke attended St. Michael&#x27;s college high school and played junior B hockey for the St.Michael&#x27;s Buzzers in the 1983-84 season. He was taken in the 3rd round of the OHL draft by the Toronto Marlboros where he would play for the next two seasons. 

Burke was drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the second round of the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. He earned national attention from his international play, backstopping the Canada men&#x27;s national junior ice hockey team to a silver medal in the 1986 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and a fourth-place finish for the men&#x27;s national team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.

Burke transitioned directly from Canada&#x27;s Olympics national team to the Devils. He started 11 games for the Devils in the 1987–88 season, including an overtime victory against the Chicago Blackhawks on the final night of the season that qualified the Devils for their first Stanley Cup playoff series.

Dubbed a &quot;rookie sensation&quot;, Burke helped the Devils go on a strong playoff run, defeating the division-leader New York Islanders in the first round in six games and then the Washington Capitals in seven games. The Devils were one game away from the Stanley Cup Finals but lost in Game 7 of the Wales Conference Finals to the Boston Bruins. Burke&#x27;s play was widely heralded, with &quot;The Hockey Digest&quot; stating, &quot;Burke is now the franchise for the Devils, and to whatever heights he rises, the Devils will rise with him,&quot; and in December 1988, Burke became the first Devil to appear on its cover.

Because he played just 11 games in the 1987–88 regular season, Burke maintained his rookie status for the 1988–89 season. That season, he was named to the 1989 All-Star Game.

Burke played for the Devils through the 1990–91 season, then sat out the 1991–92 season requesting a trade. Instead, he joined coach Dave King and played for the Canadian national team in the Winter Olympics for a second time, backstopping Canada to a silver medal. Teammates on the 1992 Olympic team included future NHL players Eric Lindros and Joe Juneau. 

On August 28, 1992, Burke was traded to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for Bobby Holík, a second-round pick in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft (used to select Jay Pandolfo) and future considerations. He played there (and with the relocated Whalers team, the Carolina Hurricanes) for six seasons. He was voted Whalers&#x27; team MVP from 1993 to 1997. Burke then played with several teams, including the Philadelphia Flyers, Vancouver Canucks and Florida Panthers. He subsequently signed with the Phoenix Coyotes and played there for five seasons, where he was a finalist for the Vezina Trophy and third finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy in the 2001–02 season.

Burke was selected to represent the Arizona Coyotes in the 2000-01 and 2001-02 NHL All Star games. 

After that, Burke played for the Philadelphia Flyers (for the second time) recording his 300th career NHL win (the 20th goaltender to reach this milestone), and the Tampa Bay Lightning. Burke was placed on waivers by Tampa Bay before the 2006–07 season but was not picked up. He then played for Tampa Bay&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. Burke was placed on waivers by the Lightning and picked up off re-entry waivers by the Los Angeles Kings.

Burke announced his retirement from professional hockey on September 18, 2007.
Burke currently sits #15 on the list of all time games played for NHL goaltenders (820) #30 all time wins (324) #50 all time shutouts (38) and #5 all time penalty minutes for goaltenders (310)

==International play==





Burke played in 11 games for the Canadian national team in the 1988 and 1992 Winter Olympics. He served as the back-up goaltender in the 1991 Canada Cup and has also played in 130 games for other Canadian national teams from 1985 through 2003.

The 130 games that Burke has played for Team Canada represent the most games any goaltender has played Internationally for Canada 

In 2020, Burke was named into the IIHF All-Time Canada Team along with Scott Niedermayer, Chris Pronger, Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and Sidney Crosby.

==Post-NHL career==
On March 4, 2008, the Phoenix Coyotes hired Burke to become its director of prospect development. He was also the assistant to the general manager and Coyotes&#x27; goaltending coach.

In 2015 Burke was part of the management group along with General Manager Jim Nill, George McPhee and Pat Verbeek that led Canada to a gold medal at the IIHF World Championships. Canada went undefeated in the tournament held in Prague, Czech Republic beating Russia 6 t0 1 in the gold medal game. 

In 2016 Burke joined General Managers Brad Treliving and George McPhee as part of the management group for the IIHF World Championships in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Russia. Canada won the gold medal defeating Finland 2 to 0 in the final game. 

In 2017 Burke co managed Team Canada at the IIHF World Championships along with Ron Hextall in Cologne, Germany and Paris, France. Canada took home the silver medal after being defeated 2 to 1 in a shootout by Sweden. 

Burke was the General Manager for Team Canada at the Spengler Cup in 2016, 2017 and 2019 taking home gold medals. In 2018 he managed the team along with Ron Francis taking home the silver medal. 

In September 2016, Burke joined the Montreal Canadiens as a professional scout. He also spent the 2020-21 season as the full time goaltending coach with the Canadiens as the team made it to the Stanley Cup finals losing to the Tampa Bay Lightning in 5 games. On July 25, 2017, he was announced as the general manager of Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s team for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
where Team Canada went on to win the bronze medal. That same season he co managed the IIHF World Championships with Martin Brodeur and Scott Salmond held in Copenhagen and Herning, Denmark. 

In March 2021, Burke was appointed as the director of goaltending for the Montreal Canadiens.

On June 25, 2022, Burke was appointed as director of goaltending for the Vegas Golden Knights. Even with the Golden Knights losing their previous season&#x27;s starting goaltender Robin Lehner for the entire season due to injury and off-season surgery, and rotating through a total of five other goaltenders due to various injuries (by numbers of regular season games started, Logan Thompson, Adin Hill, Laurent Brossoit, Jonathan Quick, and Jiří Patera), Burke was able to help coach the Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup in 2023 (Burke&#x27;s first Stanley Cup win).

Burke is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federations Players Committee where he has served on the committee since 2016.

==Personal life==
Burke and his wife Christy have one son together. Burke has two children from a previous marriage.

On November 2, 1997, Burke and his then-wife were both charged with assault following an alleged altercation at their home. Despite the incident, the Carolina Hurricanes chose not to suspend Burke. In January 1998, Burke was fined $200, sentenced to 18 months probation, and required to complete an educational program on domestic violence after pleading guilty to the assault charge.

<text>Richard Veitch (; born May 7, 1951) is an American comics artist and writer who has worked in mainstream, underground, and alternative comics.

==Biography==
Rick Veitch is a native of the small town of Bellows Falls, Vermont. One of six children, he was raised Catholic. One of his elder brothers was the writer Tom Veitch, his first collaborator in comics. In an interview, Veitch recalled visiting the [WPA] muralist Stephan J.Belaski to ask his advice on becoming an artist. &quot;He just said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t do it, kid.&#x27;&quot; Winning honorable mention in a &quot;draw a monster&quot; contest hosted by Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth, for &quot;Drag Cartoons&quot; when he was in seventh grade reassured him that he was on the right path.

Today, Veitch lives in West Townshend, Vermont with his wife Cindy. His sons Ezra Veitch and Kirby Veitch are also artists, contributing to Eureka Comics.

==Career==
===Early career===
While still in high school, Veitch and his brother Tom created the comic strip &quot;Crazymouse&quot;, which ran regularly in &quot;The Vermont Cynic&quot;. He made his professional debut in 1972, illustrating the underground comix horror parody &quot;Two-Fisted Zombies&quot; published by Last Gasp and written by Tom. This one-shot was excerpted in Mark James Estren&#x27;s 1974 study, &quot;A History of Underground Comix&quot;. According to Veitch, it also proved to be his ticket to admission to The Kubert School.

Veitch enrolled in the Kubert School in 1976. Studying under veteran cartoonists Joe Kubert, Ric Estrada and Dick Giordano, he was part of the school&#x27;s first graduating class in 1978, along with his future long-time collaborators Stephen R. Bissette and John Totleben. While still at school Veitch began his professional career in mainstream comics, contributing over a dozen short stories to DC’s combat title, &quot;Our Army at War&quot;.

Out of school, Veitch contributed to &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;. His next major project was an adaptation of the Steven Spielberg film &quot;1941&quot; with Bissette.

During the 1980s, Veitch became known as a distinctive fantasy artist and writer for Marvel&#x27;s Epic Comics line, for which he created three graphic novels, &quot;Abraxas and the Earthman&quot; serialized in &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot;; &quot;Heartburst&quot; published as a standalone graphic novel; and &quot;The One.&quot;

During this period Veitch contributed numerous short comics to &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot;. He also worked with Alan Moore on &quot;Miracleman&quot;, published by Eclipse Comics. He illustrated the story that graphically depicted the birth of the superhero&#x27;s child in &quot;Miracleman&quot; #9 (July 1986). With Moore and Bissette, Veitch collaborated on the original version of The Mirror of Love, published in a 1988 anthology by AARGH (Artists Against Rampant Government Homophobia). Moore later revised the text and published it with new illustrations by José Villarrubia.

===&quot;The One&quot;===

Originally published as a six-issue comic book limited series, &quot;The One&quot; was an ambitious and bizarre fantasy-adventure involving monstrous superheroes, the Cold War, and spiritual evolution. Published between 1985 and 1986, &quot;The One&quot; presaged both Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Watchmen&quot; (1986–1987) and Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; (1986) in its revisionist approach to superheroics. As Moore would later write: 

===&quot;Swamp Thing&quot;===
Veitch&#x27;s highest-profile title in the 1980s was DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;. His friends Totleben and Bissette had both illustrated the series since Alan Moore took over as writer. Veitch joined the team for issue #37 (cover dated June 1985), in which Moore&#x27;s popular character John Constantine was introduced, and appeared regularly after issue #50.

When Moore left the &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; series after issue #64, Veitch took over as writer, dividing art duties with Alfredo Alcala. His &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; stories took a similar approach to Moore&#x27;s, combining horror-fantasy, ecological concerns, and an encyclopedic knowledge of DC Comics fantasy characters; he gradually turned his attention from the DC Universe to history and mythology. Veitch concocted a plot device—a mystical piece of amber called The Claw of Aelkhund that gives him the power of time travel. This allowed Veitch to introduce his hero to a variety of legendary figures, from Jonah Hex, Bat Lash, and Tomahawk, to Sgt. Rock and Etrigan the Demon. While thrilling to many readers, this approach ultimately hit a bump that derailed the series.

Personally inclined towards metaphysics, Veitch submitted a script for issue #88 titled &quot;Morning of the Magician&quot; that moved DC to censorship. Set in Jerusalem, the principal characters include three evil Magi, several demons, the Holy Grail, Mother Mary, Joseph of Arimathea, and Mary Magdalene, here imagined as an active prostitute whose clients include the DC Silver Age hero Golden Gladiator. At the climax of the story, Swamp Thing meets Jesus Christ.

Although DC initially had approved Veitch&#x27;s initial script for &quot;Morning of the Magician,&quot; the story was scrapped by DC President, Jenette Kahn, who deemed it too inflammatory. &quot;The subject was handled with integrity and respect,&quot; she wrote. &quot;but we believe that the story concept itself would be offensive to many of our readers.&quot; When the story was cancelled at the last minute, Veitch quit and vowed never to work for DC until the story saw print. The story arc has never been published.

===&quot;The King Hell Heroica&quot;===
After leaving DC, Veitch turned to the alternative comics field, where the success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) had provided the impetus for a black-and-white independent comics boom. After doing a &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; storyline for Mirage Studios, &quot;The River&quot;, he began creating his own titles again, published by the Mirage spin-off Tundra Publishing. Tundra was edited by TMNT creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. Another friend Dave Sim, had found success publishing his own comics featuring &quot;Cerebus the Aardvark&quot;. Veitch decided to follow suit, creating his own publishing imprint, King Hell Press.

Operating without the editorial restraint he encountered at mainstream publishers, Veitch used his new imprint to published a series of graphic novels. The first of these was &quot;Brat Pack&quot; (1990–91), a dark satire on superhero sidekicks. A precursor to &quot;The Boys&quot;, &quot;Brat Pack&quot; was the subject of a 400-page work of cultural analysis.

Veitch followed &quot;Brat Pack&quot; with &quot;The Maximortal&quot; (1992), a phantasmagoric riff on Superman. He returned to the latter character with a new series inaugurated in 2017, &quot;Boy Maximortal&quot;. The series has been called his masterpiece. In a 2020 interview, Veitch calls Maximortal &quot;kind of the illegitimate love child of S. Clay Wilson and Curt Swan.&quot;. Veitch has since reprinted these graphic novels along with other revisionist works under the collective title, &quot;The King Hell Heroica&quot;.

===&quot;Rare Bit Fiends&quot;===
Also for King Hell Press, Veitch created a series of strips centered on dreams titled &quot;Roarin&#x27; Rick&#x27;s Rare Bit Fiends&quot;, a reference to Winsor McCay&#x27;s classic newspaper comic, &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;. The series first appeared as backup features in other comics. In 1994 King Hell inaugurated a &quot;Rare Bit Fiends&quot; comic series, with contributions by Neil Gaiman, Dave Sim, Don Simpson, Moebius, Paul Pope, and others. The original series also reproduced dream comics submitted by readers. King Hell published 21 issues of &quot;Rare Bit Fiends&quot;. The trade paperback reprint editions, collected in volumes, also include essays by Veitch speculating on the nature of dreaming. In 2016, Veitch launched Sun Comics to publish new issues of &quot;Maximortal&quot; and &quot;Rare Bit Fiends&quot;.

Dave Sim paid homage to Veitch&#x27;s fascination with dreams in his &quot;Cerebus&quot; comic. In the story arc &quot;Guys&quot;, Veitch (here named &quot;Roaring Rick&quot;) appears to Cerebus in a dream to deliver a surreal monologue on the nature of dreams, lucid dreaming, and kindred matters.

===The New Millennium===
During the 1990s, Veitch became interested in the Internet as an alternative to traditional comics distribution. In 1998, with Steve Conley, he created the &quot;online convention&quot; site Comicon.com, a combination message board, news portal, and web host for comics creators. Sold to Dynamic Forces in 2012, Comicon.com remains a vital site, which its editors liken to a perpetual comic book convention.

In the early 2000s, Veitch became a regular artist on Moore&#x27;s America&#x27;s Best Comics line published by Wildstorm, co-creating and then illustrating the graphically innovative &quot;Greyshirt&quot; serial. Debuting in &quot;Tomorrow Stories&quot;, and later spun off as an independent series, &quot;Greyshirt&quot; was an homage to Spirit, created by Will Eisner.

When Wildstorm was sold, both Veitch and Moore found themselves working indirectly for DC again, despite both having long-standing conflicts with the publisher. Reconciling with the company, Veitch scripted story arc for DC&#x27;s relaunch of &quot;Aquaman&quot; (2003), and a mini-series reimagining DC-owned Charlton Comics character &quot;The Question&quot; as a self-trained urban shaman.

In 2006, Vertigo published his 352-page graphic novel, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get No&quot;, a psychedelic road narrative about a failed businessman finding himself after the World Trade Center attacks. Eschewing dialogue, the novel juxtaposes Veitch&#x27;s art with stream-of-consciousness free verse poetry loosely relating to plot developments. On the tenth anniversary of the destruction of the World Trade Center, he wrote and penciled on &quot;The Big Lie&quot;, a comic book in which the protagonist – a physicist widowed on September 11, 2001 – travels back in time to attempt to save her husband. The book takes the position that the towers&#x27; destruction was a controlled demolition. Inking on &quot;The Big Lie&quot; was by Gary Erskine, who had collaborated earlier with Veitch on the satirical comic &quot;Army@Love&quot; (Vertigo, 2007–2009).

===Recent Work===

In 2013, Veitch teamed up with Steve Conley, the creator of &quot;Astounding Space Thrills&quot;, &quot;The Middle Age&quot;, and other webcomics to found Eureka Comics, specializing in creating comics for learning and literacy. Clients include PBS, &quot;Wired&quot;, Vermont Folklife Center, University of Quebec, the University of Vermont, and the International Monetary Fund. For McGraw Hill Education, Eureka Comics produced &quot;The Outliers&quot;, a three book series, pioneering the use of modern graphic novel storytelling techniques to teach math to middle schoolers.

In 2016, Veitch launched Sun Comics, utilizing print-on-demand publishing to release new issues of &quot;Maximortal&quot; and &quot;Rare Bit Fiends&quot;. He also began a new series, &quot;Panel Vision&quot;. Titles so far include &quot;Spotted Stone&quot; (nominated for an Eisner Award), &quot;Otzi&quot;, &quot;Redemption&quot;, &quot;Super Catchy&quot; and &quot;Tombstone Hand&quot;.

In 2020 Veitch was named Vermont’s official Cartoonist Laureate for his &quot;singular career that includes groundbreaking genre work for the big superhero companies, his own creator-owned graphic novels, educational comics, and explorations into the subconscious.&quot; He is the fourth artists to hold that honor, following James Kochalka, Ed Koren, and Alison Bechdel.

<doc id="903165" wikidata="Q377693" url="?curid=903165" title="Richard Jefferson">
<text>Richard Allen Jefferson Jr. (born June 21, 1980) is an American former professional basketball player who played small forward. He played for eight teams in his 17-season career in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Jefferson played college basketball for the Arizona Wildcats, and was selected with the 13th overall pick in the first round by the New Jersey Nets in the 2001 NBA draft. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team following his first season. Jefferson played seven seasons for the Nets, reaching the NBA Finals in each of his first two seasons. He later played for the Milwaukee Bucks, San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Denver Nuggets. He won an NBA championship with the Cavaliers in 2016 and a bronze medal as a member of the United States national team in the 2004 Summer Olympics. Jefferson retired from the NBA in 2018, becoming a basketball analyst for ESPN in 2019.

==Early life==
Jefferson was born in Los Angeles and was raised in Phoenix. His mother and step-father were both Christian missionaries, and he moved around frequently growing up. He attended Moon Valley High School in West Phoenix, where he was an integral part of the varsity basketball team that won the 4A State Championship in 1998.

==College career==
Jefferson played college basketball at the University of Arizona, under Hall of Fame coach Lute Olson from 1998 to 2001. During his 84-game career (77 starts), Jefferson averaged 11.2 points, 5.0 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game. He capped his career by being part of the Arizona team that advanced to the 2001 national championship game where the Wildcats fell to Duke. Along the way, Jefferson was an all-Midwest Regional and all-Final Four selection. He was inducted into the Pac-12 Basketball Hall of Honor during the 2012 Pac-12 Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament, March 10, 2012.

==Professional career==

===New Jersey Nets (2001–2008)===
Jefferson played seven seasons with the New Jersey Nets and was a key element of their back-to-back Eastern Conference Championship teams of 2002 and 2003. He played in the NBA Finals with the Nets in each of his first two seasons. In addition, Jefferson was a member of the USA Men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team in the 2004 Summer Olympics. Jefferson competed in the NBA Slam Dunk Contest in 2003.

Jefferson began his career as a substitute small forward for Keith Van Horn and showed great defensive skills and all-around ability. Because of his potential, and Van Horn&#x27;s conflict with power forward Kenyon Martin, the Nets traded Van Horn to the Philadelphia 76ers and trusted Jefferson as a starter. Jefferson blossomed in the role, becoming a good mid- and long-range shooter in addition to his slashing ability. On August 13, 2004, Jefferson signed a six-year, $78,000,000 contract extension with the Nets.

Jefferson missed the majority of the 2004–05 regular season after rupturing a ligament in his left wrist, an injury he claimed occurred when Detroit Pistons guard Chauncey Billups purposely undercut him on a layup attempt during a game on December 27, 2004. Jefferson ended up missing 49 games, but returned to action for the first round of the playoffs against the Miami Heat. Prior to suffering the injury, he had missed only five games in his three NBA seasons. Jefferson had been enjoying his best professional season, averaging 22.2 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game. Through the 2005–06 season, Jefferson continued to perform at a high level and established himself as one of the NBA&#x27;s most versatile players. On January 21, 2007, Jefferson decided to have ankle surgery. After missing around six weeks, he was back in the lineup. His absence proved to be a major setback for the struggling Nets, who surged back into playoff contention once Jefferson returned.

In August 2007, Jefferson pledged $3.5 million toward the University of Arizona&#x27;s then-planned basketball and volleyball practice facility, which was eventually named in his honor.

Jefferson started the 2007–08 season in the best form of his NBA career. In the first 7 games, he averaged 26.9 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists, while also notching up 1.3 steals, 97.1% in free-throws and 49.1% in field-goals. On October 31, in a game against the Chicago Bulls, Jefferson injured his right wrist slightly, thumping his chest following a clutch three-pointer. The Nets went on to win the game in overtime. On December 4 he passed Kerry Kittles to become the Nets&#x27; second all-time leading scorer.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2008–2009)===
On June 26, 2008, Jefferson was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Yi Jianlian and future teammate Bobby Simmons. He was not happy with the trade at first because he planned on being a Net until retirement. However, he later expressed enthusiasm about playing alongside Michael Redd.

===San Antonio Spurs (2009–2011)===

On August 5, 2015, Jefferson signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers. On October 27, he made his debut for the team, posting ten points, one assist, and one steal in a 95–97 loss to the Chicago Bulls. The Cavaliers finished the regular season with a 57–25 record and reached the 2016 NBA Finals with a 12–2 playoff record. In the third Finals of his career, Jefferson played in every game of the series, including two starts in place of the injured Kevin Love. In Game 3, Jefferson gave the Cavaliers a boost in 33 minutes, scoring nine points with eight rebounds as the Cavaliers cut the Golden State Warriors&#x27; advantage in the series to 2–1 with a 120–90 win. Despite falling into a 3–1 deficit, the Cavaliers completed the historic comeback to take the series in seven games, winning Jefferson his first and only championship.

After initially considering retirement following the championship win, Jefferson re-signed with the Cavaliers on July 28, 2016, reportedly on a two-year, $5 million contract. The Cavaliers returned to the NBA Finals in 2017, but fell short in their quest for back-to-back titles, losing in five games to the Warriors.

<doc id="903166" wikidata="Q1233734" url="?curid=903166" title="Dock Boggs">
<text>Moran Lee &quot;Dock&quot; Boggs (February 7, 1898 – February 7, 1971) was an American old-time singer, songwriter, and banjo player. His style of banjo playing, as well as his singing, is considered a unique combination of Appalachian folk music and African-American blues. Contemporary folk musicians and performers consider him a seminal figure, at least in part because of the appearance of two of his recordings from the 1920s, &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; and &quot;Country Blues&quot;, on Harry Smith&#x27;s 1952 collection &quot;Anthology of American Folk Music&quot;. Boggs was first recorded in 1927 and again in 1929, although he worked primarily as a coal miner for most of his life.

He was rediscovered during the folk music revival of the 1960s and spent much of his later life playing at folk music festivals and recording for Folkways Records.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Boggs was born in West Norton, Virginia, in 1898, the youngest of ten children. In the late 1890s, the arrival of railroads in central Appalachia brought large-scale coal mining to the region, and by the time Dock was born, the Boggs family had made the transition from subsistence farming to working for wages and living in mining towns. Dock&#x27;s father, who worked as a carpenter and blacksmith, loved singing and could read sheet music. He taught his children to sing, and several of Dock&#x27;s siblings learned to play the banjo.

In an interview with Mike Seeger in the 1960s, Boggs recalled how, as a young child, he would follow an African-American guitarist named &quot;Go Lightning&quot; up and down the railroad tracks between Norton and Dorchester, hoping the guitarist would stop at street corners to play for change.

Boggs&#x27;s version of the ballad &quot;John Henry&quot; was based in part on the version he learned from Go Lightning during this period. He also recalled sneaking over to the African-American camps in Dorchester at night, where he first observed string bands playing at dances and parties. He was enamoured of the bands&#x27; banjo players&#x27; preference for picking, having previously been exposed only to the &quot;frailing&quot; style of his siblings.

Around the time he began working in coal mines, Boggs began playing music more often and more seriously. He learned much of his technique during this period from his brother Roscoe and an itinerant musician named Homer Crawford, both of whom shared Dock&#x27;s preference for picking. Crawford taught him &quot;Hustlin&#x27; Gambler,&quot; which was the basis for Boggs&#x27;s &quot;Country Blues.&quot; He also picked up several songs (such as &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;) from a local African-American musician named Jim White. Boggs probably began playing at parties around 1918.

===Early career, 1927–1931===

In the mid-1920s, various record companies sent representatives to southern Appalachia to hold auditions in hopes of finding new talents. Around late 1926 or early 1927, Boggs tried out at one such audition, held by Brunswick Records at the Norton Hotel. Although he played on a banjo borrowed from a local music store and needed whiskey to calm his nerves, he played well enough to gain a contract to record several sides in New York later that year. He recorded only eight sides for Brunswick, however, as he deemed their payment sufficient for only that number.

Boggs&#x27;s records sold moderately well, and he returned to the mining areas of southwestern Virginia and eastern Kentucky, where he began to play at parties, gatherings, and mining camps. Around this time, his brother-in-law Lee Hansucker, who was a Holiness preacher and singer, began teaching him religious songs from the Holiness and Baptist traditions. Boggs also learned a large number of songs from listening to Hansucker&#x27;s vast record collection. By 1928, he was making enough money to quit working in coal mines and focus exclusively on music. He bought a new banjo and formed a band known as &quot;Dock Boggs and His Cumberland Mountain Entertainers&quot;. At one point, he was earning three to four hundred dollars a week.

While Dock was experiencing a moderate amount of success, the life of a travelling musician often left him at odds with his religious neighbors, who considered such a life sinful. His wife, Sarah, whom he had married in 1918, despised secular music and was opposed to his earning a living by playing music. The constantly moving mining camps were fraught with excess and violence, and Boggs was consistently engaging in drunken brawls that often left him or an opponent badly injured. The stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression hit southern Appalachia particularly hard, and few people had the means to pay musicians to play at gatherings or buy records.

In 1929, Boggs travelled to Chicago to record four sides for Lonesome Ace Records. However, with the onset of the Great Depression, he was unable to profit from these recordings. In 1930, he travelled to Atlanta, where OKeh Records had set up a live audition on radio station WSB. Because of stage fright, however, he performed poorly. He was offered several other recording auditions over the next three years, but he could not raise enough money to cover his travel expenses. He eventually pawned his banjo and gave up hopes of making a living playing music.

===Rediscovery===

In June 1963, at the height of the folk music revival in the United States, the folk music scholar Mike Seeger sought out and found Boggs at his home near Needmore, Virginia. Seeger was delighted to learn that Boggs had recently repurchased a banjo and had been practicing the instrument for several months before his arrival. He persuaded Boggs to play at the American Folk Festival in Asheville, North Carolina, later that year. With Seeger&#x27;s help, Boggs began recording again, eventually recording three albums for Folkways Records. Throughout the 1960s, he toured the United States, playing in clubs and at folk music festivals, including a performance before an audience of 10,000 at the Newport Folk Festival.

In the early 1970s, Boggs&#x27;s health began to deteriorate, and he died on his 73rd birthday. In 1968, his protégé Jack Wright started the Dock Boggs Festival, which is still held annually in Boggs&#x27;s hometown of Norton, although it is now known as the Dock Boggs &amp; Kate Peters Sturgill Festival.

He was buried in Norton, Virginia.

==Technique==
While Boggs was familiar with the clawhammer style, or &quot;frailing&quot;, he typically played in a style known as up-picking, which involves picking upwards on the first two strings and playing one of the other three strings with the thumb. He played several songs in a lower D-modal tuning. His technique, which Seeger considered &quot;a style possessed by no other recorded player,&quot; was adapted to fit previously unaccompanied mountain ballads.

Boggs learned traditional mountain songs from his siblings, including, &quot;Sugar Baby,&quot; from his brother John; &quot;Danville Girl,&quot; which he learned from his brother Roscoe; and &quot;Little Omie Wise,&quot; which he learned from his sisters. Lee Hansucker, his brother-in-law, taught him various religious songs, including &quot;O Death&quot;, &quot;Little Black Train&quot;, &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, and &quot;Calvary&quot;. Along with &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; and &quot;John Henry&quot;, he learned songs such as &quot;Banjo Clog&quot; and &quot;Down South Blues&quot; from African-American blues musicians. The song &quot;Wise County Jail&quot;, written by Boggs in 1928, was inspired by an incident in which he had to flee to Kentucky, after attacking a lawman who tried to break up a party at which he was playing.

== History ==
David Wolcott Kendall was a nationally known furniture designer, during Grand Rapids&#x27; heyday as &quot;Furniture City&quot;. The David Wolcott Memorial School was established in 1928 by the will of Helen M. Kendall, his widow. The school opened in 1931, offering a two-year program in design, with 35 students. The school was located at 145 Fountain Street, at the western edge of what is now Heritage Hill.

In 1947, growing from an influx of students following World War 2, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Kendall School of Design. In 1961, having outgrown the Heritage Hill site, it relocated to 1110 College Avenue NE in the Highland Park neighborhood. In 1977, Kendall began offering baccalaureate degrees, and in 1981 was accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. It moved again, to the seven-story Manufacturer&#x27;s Building at 111 Division Avenue North (on the corner of Fountain Street, a short distance from the original site) in 1984.

The name of the school was changed in 1987 to Kendall College of Art and Design. As part of a merger with Ferris State University, the college bought the adjacent Interstate Building in the 1990s, constructing an atrium which became the combined structures&#x27; main entrance at 17 Fountain Street NW. In 2000 the school became formally Kendall College of Art and Design of Ferris State University, and it continued renovating the new space for studio and classroom use. After the Grand Rapids Art Museum moved out of the Federal Building to the north, the university took ownership of it and reopened it as the Woodbridge N. Ferris Building in 2012 as part of the Kendall campus. In 2013, the college merged with the Urban Institute for Contemporary Arts, which had recently relocated to a new facility a few blocks to the south, which operated as an arts organization until its closure on March 3, 2023.

==Facilities==

The college occupies two historic structures in downtown Grand Rapids, between Division and Ionia Avenues and Fountain and Lyon Streets. The seven-story main building contains most of the college&#x27;s classroom, studio, and office space. The Woodbridge N. Ferris Building contains exhibition space, additional classrooms, and office space.

Facilities include black-and-white darkrooms, photo studios, a library, galleries, an historic furniture collection, sculptural wood- and metalworking shops, a metalsmithing/jewelry design studio, digital fabrication contemporary technology such as wide format inkjet printers, laser engraving/cutting systems, 3D scanners, rapid prototyping/3D printers, CNC milling machines, printmaking equipment, life drawing studios, audio recording booth, and student studios.

<text>Pyknosis, or karyopyknosis, is the irreversible condensation of chromatin in the nucleus of a cell undergoing necrosis or apoptosis. It is followed by karyorrhexis, or fragmentation of the nucleus.
Pyknosis (from Ancient Greek meaning &quot;thick, closed or condensed&quot;) is also observed in the maturation of erythrocytes (a red blood cell) and the neutrophil (a type of white blood cell). The maturing metarubricyte (a stage in RBC maturation) will condense its nucleus before expelling it to become a reticulocyte. The maturing neutrophil will condense its nucleus into several connected lobes that stay in the cell until the end of its cell life.

Pyknotic nuclei are often found in the zona reticularis of the adrenal gland. They are also found in the keratinocytes of the outermost layer in parakeratinised epithelium.

== Overview of Pyknosis ==
Pyknosis, or the irreversible nuclear condensation (a nuclear morphology) in a cell (generally old vertebrate leukocyte cells) is the result of a cell undergoing either apoptosis or necrosis. There are two types of pyknosis: nucleolytic pyknosis and anucleolytic pyknosis. Nucleolytic pyknosis occurs during apoptosis (a form of controlled/programmed cell death), while anucleolytic pyknosis occurs during necrosis. Necrosis is a form of regulated cell death due to toxins, infections, and other acute stressors. These stressors cause swelling/shape modification of cellular organelles leading to the eventual loss of stability and integrity of the cell membrane.
In simpler terms, pyknosis is the process of nuclear shrinkage that may occur during both necrosis and apoptosis. Pyknosis is also characterized by eventual fragmentation (karyorrhexis) of the dense nuclear chromatin, resulting in dark, round, and dense nuclear fragments. Karyorrhexis is the fragmentation of a pyknotic cell’s nucleus and the cleavage and condensing of chromatin.

== Pyknosis provides a distinction between apoptosis and necrosis ==

Apoptosis is characterized by nuclear condensation, shrinking of the cell, and blebbing of the nuclear and cell membrane, while necrosis is characterized by nuclear condensation, swelling of the cell, and breaks in the cell membrane. Both necrosis and apoptosis are regulated by a few of the same proteins: caspase-activated DNase (CAD), endonuclease G and DNase I. Pyknosis occurs in both an apoptotic and a necrotic cell. Pyknosis in an apoptotic cell is identified by nuclear condensation, chromatin fragmentation, and the formation of a few large clumps which are enveloped by apoptotic extracellular vesicles, which are to be released when the cell dies. Pyknosis in a necrotic cell is identified by nuclear condensation and fragmentation into small clumps that will be dissolved later in the process of the necrotic cell’s death. Consequently, pyknosis can be distinguished into two types, nucleolytic pyknosis (apoptotic cells) and anucleolytic pyknosis (necrotic cells).

== The types of pyknosis ==

=== Nucleolytic pyknosis ===
Nucleolytic pyknosis, which can also be referred to as apoptotic pyknosis, involves three main events. These are disrupting the nuclear membrane, the condensing of the chromatin, and lastly, nuclear cleavage/fragmentation. Throughout these events the cell shrinks in size and the cell membrane undergoes blebbing, which is the forming of membrane bulges across the exterior-facing surface of the cell membrane. During the first event (the disruption of the nuclear membrane), several enzymes are used to cleave the proteins found in the nuclear membrane. These enzymes, caspase-3 and caspase-6, both target and cleave nuclear membrane proteins, including NUP153, LAP2, and B1 (proteins that are used for membrane structure and molecular transport). This cleavage, in turn, results in a disruption of the interior of the membrane, which is an initiating factor for chromatin condensation (the second event of nucleolytic pyknosis). This is due to the fact that caspase-3 cleaves Acinus, which has DNA/RNA binding domains and ATPase activity to initiate the condensation of chromatin.

=== Anucleolytic pyknosis ===
Anucleolytic pyknosis, which can also be referred to as necrotic pyknosis, involves the swelling of the cell, followed by the separation of the nuclear membrane from chromatin, the eventual collapse of both the nuclear membrane and chromatin, and finally the cell membrane ruptures (the cell dies). One protein that plays a significant role in necrotic pyknosis is the barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF). The function of BAF is to facilitate the tethering of chromatin to the membrane of the nucleus, however in the case of necrosis, when BAF is phosphorylated, it will initiate the dissociation between the nuclear membrane and the condensed chromatin. As a result, the nuclear membrane will collapse onto the condensed chromatin. Thus, the phosphorylation of BAF is a critical marker of necrotic pyknosis.

== Significance of pyknosis ==

Pyknosis is a stage in the apoptotic or necrotic cell death pathways. It is an important stage that involves fragmentation and condensation of damaged DNA/chromatin. Without it, the apoptotic or necrotic cell death pathways would be interrupted. This disruption, in turn, may prompt the improper destruction or removal of a cell with damaged elements as well as other related issues. These issues include cell accumulation and uncontrolled cell growth, which results in the formation of cancerous and abnormal tissue masses known as tumors. Therefore, being able to observe or identify when a cell is pyknotic (which may indicate that the cell is undergoing apoptosis or necrosis) and if it then successfully undergoes apoptosis or necrosis, may be crucial in determining if the cell will undergo uncontrolled cell growth and contribute to the formation of a tumor.

== Techniques for detecting or observing pyknosis in cells ==
Various techniques are used to detect/observe pyknosis. These techniques also help to differentiate between apoptotic or necrotic cells. The techniques are identified and described as follows:

=== Cellular staining ===
When stains and dyes are applied to locate pyknotic cells in a tissue sample, the cell becomes easily identifiable. The stains/dyes target the nuclear and blebbed fragments of a pyknotic cell, making them dark (light contrast) and more readily seen when the sample is placed under a light microscope. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry also use staining (fluorescent stains) to target the DNA/nuclear fragments of cells. The fluorescent staining creates a contrast between normal cell DNA and pyknotic cell DNA, because pyknotic cell nuclear material is condensed. 
=== Gel electrophoresis ===
Gel electrophoresis is a standard technique that is frequently used to visualize DNA fragmentation (forming a ladder-like image on the gel), which is a characteristic of apoptosis and is associated with nuclear condensation (which characterizes pyknosis). Therefore, when referring to apoptosis, this technique is known as DNA laddering. Gel electrophoresis is also used to visualize the random DNA fragmentation of necrosis, which forms a smear on the gel.

=== Assays to detect DNA fragmentation or condensation ===
Various assays of DNA fragmentation or condensation include the APO single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) assay which detects damaged DNA of cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis, TUNEL assay which is used to locally find DNA strand breaks (DSBs), and ISEL.

ISEL (in-situ labeling technique) is a labeling/tagging technique of apoptotic or necrotic cells. ISEL specifically targets unfragmented DNA that has condensed into a nucleosome structure.

The APO ssDNA assay detects apoptotic cells by using an antibody that specifically binds to the ssDNA, which is accumulated during apoptosis as a result of DNA fragmentation. Therefore, the presence of ssDNA is an indicator of DNA damage in the apoptotic cell. For the assay process, cells are fixed (with e.g., formamide), and these cells then undergo incubation (at a predetermined temperature), which subjects the DNA to thermal denaturation and exposes the ssDNA. Next, the cells are incubated with an ssDNA-specific antibody along with a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. The fluorescence amounts as a measure of apoptosis which can then be quantified using flow cytometry.

The TUNEL assay, otherwise known as the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay, is a technique that measures DNA damage and breakage during apoptosis. During apoptosis, DNA fragmentation exposes numerous 3’OH ends, that are labeled with modified deoxy-uridine triphosphate (dUTP) by the TUNEL reaction. Then, this modified dUTP can be identified with specific fluorescent antibodies which can identify modified nucleotides or by using tagged nucleotides themselves. Flow cytometry can then be used to quantify fluorescence intensity, and thus provide a measure of apoptosis.

=== Detection methods of caspase activity ===
As mentioned above, caspase proteins, which are protease enzymes, promote DNA condensation and fragmentation via the caspase (or proteolytic) cascade. These caspase proteins include, for example, caspase 9, caspase 6, caspase 7, and caspase 3. The caspase cascade directly activates caspase-activated DNase (CAD) which initiates DNA fragmentation into smaller pieces resulting in chromatin condensation. The biochemical techniques used to detect caspase activity include ELISA and fluorometric and colorimetric assays.

<text>U.S. Route 259 (US 259) is a north–south spur of U.S. Route 59 that runs for through rural areas of northeastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma. The highway&#x27;s southern terminus is near Nacogdoches, Texas, at an interchange with its parent route, US 59. Its northern terminus is in the Ouachita Mountains, approximately south of Heavener, Oklahoma, where it reunites with US 59. For most of its length, US 259 lies to the west of its parent route.

==Route description==
===Texas===

US 259 begins at an intersection with its parent, US 59 (future Interstate 69), on the north side of Nacogdoches, Texas. The highway continues due north, passing through Mount Enterprise, and around the eastern side of Henderson and Kilgore. In Kilgore, Texas, US 259 is known as the Charles K. Devall Memorial Highway, as named by the Texas Legislature. It then has a concurrency with Interstate 20 of about , then continues north around the eastern edge of Longview along Eastman Rd. The highway continues due north, crossing Interstate 30 in northern Morris County, and crossing into Oklahoma in northwest Bowie County.

===Oklahoma===

After crossing into McCurtain County, Oklahoma, US-259 immediately meets State Highway 87, and continues north through Harris. Maps indicate that US-259 and SH-87 overlap to Idabel, but officially, this is not the case, and ODOT signage does not reflect a concurrency.

US-259 bypasses Idabel to the south and east, concurring with U.S. Highway 70 Bypass. East of Idabel, the bypass route ends, and US-259 begins a concurrency with mainline US-70 and SH-3. The three highways continue north to Broken Bow, where US-70 splits to the east toward DeQueen, Arkansas, and SH-3 splits to the west, bound for Antlers. US-259 continues north alone, taking a winding path through the Ouachita Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma. The route passes Broken Bow Lake on its west side, with State Highway 259A serving as an access loop to the lake and Beavers Bend State Resort. Near the lake, US-259 crosses through the Ouachita National Forest for the first time. Near Smithville, the highway serves as the western terminus of State Highway 4.

North of the SH-4 junction, US-259 crosses into Le Flore County. The U.S. route then serves as the eastern terminus of SH-144 near Octavia. US-259 reenters the national forest north of this junction, and intersects SH-63 at Big Cedar. It then has a junction with SH-1, the Talimena Drive. The highway reunites with US-59 about south of Heavener, reaching its northern terminus.

==History==
In Texas, the highway was designated in 1962 and assumed the entire route of a previous iteration and alignment of State Highway 26, which was then cancelled. (The SH 26 designation has since returned, on another roadway elsewhere in the state.)

Prior to 1985, US 259 between Kilgore and Longview followed the current route of Texas State Highway 31. It entered Longview from the southwest at the intersection of South Street and Spur 63. It then followed Spur 63 to US 80. US 259 then ran concurrently with US 80 to Eastman Road. At the US 80/Eastman Rd. intersection, the previous alignment of US 259 turned left to go north on Eastman. In 1985, US 259 was rerouted to its current route along Interstate 20 to Eastman Road, then left to go north, along the eastern edge of Longview, bypassing the central business district.

==Major intersections==




























==Special routes==

===Kilgore business route===

US-259 has one Business route in Texas. In 2006, a new bypass was completed around the eastern side of Kilgore. The bypass had been proposed as early as 1965, but funding did not become available until the late 1990s. The new bypass was designated as US-259, while the previous route through the Kilgore business district was designated as a business route. The new business route was approved by the AASHO in September 2006.
===Idabel bypass===
Formerly, US-259 continued into downtown Idabel, and the southeast portion of the Idabel bypass was double-designated as US-70 Bypass and US-259 Bypass. On 6 March 2000, the bypass route was decommissioned, and mainline US-259 was moved onto the bypass. However, , some bypass signage is still in place, including signage indicating the former terminus of Bypass US-259 at US-70/SH-3.
===SH-259A===
SH-259A, an Oklahoma state highway, is a loop to Broken Bow Lake and Beavers Bend Resort Park north of Broken Bow, Oklahoma. It lies partially in the Ouachita National Forest and is occasionally signed as a U.S. highway.

<text>U.S. Route 360 (US 360) is a spur route of US 60. The U.S. Highway runs , entirely within the state of Virginia, from US 58 Business, Virginia State Route 293 (SR 293), and SR 360 in Danville east to SR 644 in Reedville. US 360 connects Danville, South Boston, Keysville and Burkeville in Southside Virginia with the state capital of Richmond. The highway connects Richmond with Tappahannock on the Middle Peninsula and the eastern Northern Neck, where it serves as the primary route through Northumberland County. US 360 is a four-lane divided highway for almost all of its length.

==Route description==
===Danville to Keysville===
US 360 begins at a four-way intersection on the north side of the Dan River, across from downtown Danville. Main Street heads south across the river into downtown Danville as SR 293, and north as SR 293 and SR 360 (SR 360 is a two-lane highway, the old alignment of US 360 from Danville to northeast of South Boston). The west leg of the intersection is Riverside Drive, which is followed by US 58 Business. US 360 heads east along four-lane divided River Street with US 58 Business, and passes under Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Danville District rail line. The highway&#x27;s name changes to South Boston Highway on crossing Fall Creek and veering away from the Dan River. US 360 reaches the eastern end of its concurrency with US 58 Business and joins with US 58 at the highway&#x27;s cloverleaf interchange with US 29 (Danville Expressway). US 360 and US 58 leave the city of Danville after passing along the north side of Danville Regional Airport.

US 360 and US 58 meet at the northern end of SR 62 (Milton Highway) in eastern Pittsylvania County before entering Halifax County. The highway&#x27;s name changes to Philpott Road and it crosses the Dan River. US 360 and US 58 pass through the hamlets of Delila (where the U.S. highways meet the northern end of SR 119 (Calvary Road)) and Turbeville before reaching the crossroads community of Riverdale on the south side of the Dan River opposite downtown South Boston. The U.S. Highways have a grade crossing at Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Durham District rail line and then intersect US 501 (Huell Matthews Highway), where the highways begin to follow Bill Tuck Highway. A short distance east of US 501, US 360 and US 58 diverge, with US 360 turning north onto the James D. Hagood Highway. The highway crosses the Dan River, its floodplain, and Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Danville–Richmond rail line via a 2,000-foot-long bridge. On entering the town limits of South Boston, the highway follows John Randolph Boulevard and has intersections with the eastern ends of SR 304 (Seymour Drive) and SR 34 (Hodges Street).

After leaving South Boston, US 360 becomes James D. Hagood Highway again, and heads northeast past South Boston Speedway and William M. Tuck Airport. The U.S. Highway crosses the Banister River at Terrys Bridge and meets the coincident termini of SR 360 (Bethel Road) and SR 344 (Scottsburg Road) near Scottsburg. US 360 crosses over the Danville–Richmond rail line and meets the western end of SR 92 (Clover Road) south of the town of Clover. It crosses the Roanoke River into Charlotte County and follows Kings Highway, which intersects SR 92 (Jeb Stuart Highway) again and US 15 (Barnesville Highway) at Wylliesburg. US 360 and US 15 run concurrently north through Crafton Gate, where the highways intersect SR 47 (Craftons Gate Highway). South of Keysville, at the southern end of US 15 Business and US 360 Business (Old Kings Highway), the highway becomes a freeway that bypasses Keysville. US 15 and US 360 cross over the Virginia Southern Railroad and have a partial interchange with the business routes. Just east of the town of Keysville, the U.S. Highways have a diamond interchange with SR 40 (Lunenburg County Highway). US 15 and US 360 pass under the Virginia Southern rail line before diverging at a partial-cloverleaf interchange that also marks the northern end of their respective business routes and the end of the freeway section of US 360.

===Keysville to Richmond===
US 360 briefly runs atop the Prince Edward – Lunenburg county line before fully entering Prince Edward County, where the highway parallels the Virginia Southern Railroad to the south and Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Blue Ridge District to the north. It passes around the community of Bruceville and through the town of Meherrin, where the highway crosses to the north side of the Blue Ridge rail line. As US 360 passes through Meherrin, the highway briefly enters into Lunenburg County before reentering Prince Edward County, although no signs mark the county line there. US 360 begins to parallel the two rail lines at Green Bay, where the road temporarily becomes undivided. It parallels both rail lines to Burkeville, in the southwestern corner of Nottoway County, where the road&#x27;s name changes to Patrick Henry Highway. US 360 crosses over the Farmville Belt Line, a part of the Blue Ridge District that serves Farmville and joins the main Blue Ridge line in Burkeville. Just north of the rail crossing, the highway has a partial-cloverleaf interchange with US 460 (Colonial Trail Highway) and US 360 Business and US 460 Business, which parallel the rail line into town as 2nd Street. US 360 and US 460 bypass the town to the north and receive the eastern end of their respective business routes before diverging at a partial interchange. There is no direct access from westbound US 360 to eastbound US 460 or from westbound US 460 to eastbound US 360; those movements are made via SR 723 (Lewiston Plank Road) or SR 49 (Watsons Wood Rd).

US 360 parallels Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Richmond District rail line northeast from Burkeville. The highway meets the northern end of SR 49 (Watsons Wood Road) before entering Amelia County. West of Jetersville, the highway intersects the eastern end of SR 307 (Holly Farms Road), which connects to US 460 northwest of Burkeville. US 360 continues to Amelia Court House, which is directly served by US 360 Business (Goodes Bridge Road). North of the county seat, the highway crosses the rail line and has a partial-cloverleaf interchange with its business route before receiving the northern end of the business route west of Winterham, where the highway and railroad diverge. US 360 has a junction with SR 153 (Military Road) between Winterham and the Appomattox River, where the highway enters Chesterfield County. US 360 becomes Hull Street Road and passes through the village of Skinquarter before entering the suburban area surrounding Richmond. The U.S. Highway expands to eight lanes through Woodlake and crosses Swift Creek just downstream from the dam that holds back Swift Creek Reservoir west of the highway&#x27;s cloverleaf interchange with SR 288.

US 360 continues northeast as a six-lane highway through additional suburban areas before its partial-cloverleaf interchange with SR 150 (Chippenham Parkway), where the it enters the city of Richmond and reduces to four lanes. The U.S. Highway crosses CSX&#x27;s North End Subdivision and becomes Hull Street at its intersection with SR 161 (Belt Boulevard). US 360 heads into the Manchester section of Richmond as a four-lane undivided highway that has intersections with SR 10 (Broad Rock Road), Midlothian Turnpike, and US 1 and US 301, which head south toward Petersburg as Jefferson Davis Highway and north toward their James River crossing as Cowardin Street. US 360 passes the Art Works artist colony before passing over Norfolk Southern and the James River on the Mayo Bridge, which crosses Mayo Island in the middle of the river. US 360 reaches the north side of the river just west of the Triple Crossing; it passes under the east–west viaduct of CSX&#x27;s Rivanna Subdivision and has a grade crossing of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Richmond District. US 360 passes under SR 195 (Downtown Expressway) and follows 14th Street into the Shockoe Bottom neighborhood, where US 360 turns east onto Main Street, which carries US 60 and the GRTC Pulse rapid-transit bus line. The two highways pass under I-95 (Richmond–Petersburg Turnpike) and CSX&#x27;s Bellwood Subdivision and by the Main Street Station serving Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains during their four-block concurrency.

===Richmond to Reedville===

US 360 turns northeast onto 18th Street at Mason&#x27;s Hall to pass along the west edge of the Church Hill neighborhood. At Grace Street, the highway splits into a one-way pair; westbound US 360 follows 17th Street. US 360 meets the eastern end of US 250 (Broad Street), then curves north and passes under the Leigh Street Viaduct, which carries SR 33. The two directions of US 360 come together one block before the highway turns east onto Fairfield Way. US 360 turns north onto four-lane undivided Mechanicsville Turnpike and has a partial-cloverleaf interchange with I-64 before exiting the city of Richmond as a six-lane divided highway. US 360 passes through the Henrico County community of East Highland Park, where it intersects Laburnum Avenue, which leads to Richmond Raceway. The highway crosses the Chickahominy River into Hanover County, where it reduces to four lanes at the southern end of Mechanicsville&#x27;s US 360 Business. While on the Mechanicsville Bypass, US 360 has a diamond interchange with SR 156 (Cold Harbor Road). The movement from westbound US 360 to SR 156 is provided at the northern end of the bypass, which occurs a short distance south of US 360&#x27;s cloverleaf interchange with I295.

Northeast of I-295, US 360 gradually transitions from suburban to rural surroundings. The transition is complete by the time it crosses the Pamunkey River into King William County, where the highway&#x27;s name changes to Richmond–Tappahannock Highway. US 360 passes through Manquin and Central Garage, where it intersects SR 30 (King William Road). At Aylett, the site of Zoar State Forest, US 360 crosses the Mattaponi River into King and Queen County, where it meets the western end of SR 14 at the community of St. Stephens Church. US 360 enters Essex County at Miller&#x27;s Tavern, where the highway crosses the watershed divide between the York River tributaries and the Rappahannock River. US 360 is named Richmond Highway northeast past Tappahannock-Essex County Airport to Brays Fork, where the highway meets US 17 (Tidewater Trail) at a directional intersection. The U.S. highways run concurrently into the town of Tappahannock. Within the town, US 17 and US 360 cross Hoskins Creek and become a four-lane undivided highway. On the north side of the downtown area, US 360 turns east onto two-lane Queen Street and crosses the Rappahannock River on a high-level two-lane bridge.

US 360 expands to a four-lane divided highway on arriving in Richmond County. It heads east as Richmond Road past the historic plantation Mount Airy to the town of Warsaw. In the center of town, through which US 360 is an undivided highway, the highway runs concurrently with SR 3 Business from Main Street to SR 3 (Historyland Highway). US 360 expands to a divided highway at the hamlet of Indian Field and passes through Haynesville before entering Northumberland County at Village. The highway veers northeast at Luttrellville and meets the eastern end of SR 202 (Hampton Hall Road) in Callao. At SR 202, US 360 turns east onto Northumberland Highway, which is two lanes within the unincorporated village. US 360 briefly expands to a four-lane divided highway but is two lanes through Lottsburg. US 360 has another divided-highway section before reducing to two lanes through Heathsville, where it passes St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal Church and intersects SR 201 (Courthouse Road). The highway passes through Claraville, Horse Head, and Downings Corner before reaching its junction with SR 200 (Jesse DuPont Memorial Highway) at Burgess. US 360 has its final four-lane divided section between Folly and Lilian. At Beverlyville, it curves south toward Reedville. At SR 657 (Fleeton Road), US 360 follows Main Street south to its eastern terminus at the intersection of Main Street and Reed Avenue, which are both part of SR 644.

==Major intersections==























==Special routes==
===Keysville business route===

U.S. Route 360 Business in Charlotte County is the westernmost of several business routes of US 360. The highway, which runs between junctions with US 360 and US 15 south and north of Keysville, is entirely concurrent with US 15 Business.
===Burkeville business route===

U.S. Route 360/460 Business (US 360/460 Bus.) is the shared business route of US 360 and US 460 in Nottoway County. The highway runs between junctions with US 360 and US 460 west and east of Burkeville. US 360/460 Business begins at the partial-cloverleaf interchange where the two highways begin to run concurrently west of Burkeville. There is no direct access from the westbound bypass to the eastbound business routes. The business routes pass through the town as 2nd Street before rejoining US 360 and US 460 a short distance west of their eastern divergence point.
===Amelia Court House business route===

U.S. Route 360 Business (US 360 Business) is the business route of US 360 in Amelia County. The highway runs between junctions with US 360 west and northeast of Amelia Court House. US 360 Business is called Goodes Bridge Road and runs parallel to Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Richmond District along the northwest side of the village center, where the highway meets the western end of SR 38 (Virginia Street). Northeast of the village, the business route has a partial-cloverleaf interchange with US 360 before reaching its northern terminus at the mainline U.S. Highway.
===Mechanicsville business route===

U.S. Route 360 Business (US 360 Business) is the business route of US 360 in Hanover County. The highway runs between junctions with US 360 west and east of Mechanicsville. The business route begins as a one-way westbound ramp to westbound US 360. US 360 Business gains an eastbound lane and heads east as Mechanicsville Turnpike to an intersection with SR 156 (Cold Harbor Road) and SR 638 (Atlee Road). The business route continues a few more blocks before again becoming a one-way westbound ramp from westbound US 360. This westbound ramp is used to access SR 156 from westbound US 360 because there is no direct ramp in US 360&#x27;s diamond interchange with SR 156.

<text>A wrestling mask is a fabric-based mask that some professional wrestlers wear as part of their in-ring persona or gimmick. Professional wrestlers have been using masks as far back as 1915 and they are still widely used today, especially in Lucha Libre in Mexico.

==History==
At the 1865 World&#x27;s Fair, Theobaud Bauer debuted the mask, wrestling as &quot;The Masked Wrestler&quot; in Paris, France. He continued wrestling using the mask throughout France as part of a circus troupe in the 1860s before moving on to the United States in the early 1870s.

December 14, 1874, The Charlotte Democrat reported on an interesting story from Bucharest Romania about an open challenge made by local wrestler, Jules Rigal being accepted by a gentleman wishing to remain anonymous. The gentleman was a masked wrestler named &quot;The Great Unknown,&quot; and rumored to have been Prince Stourja, a Moldavian nobleman with a reputation of Herculean strength. The success of this match lead to the several successful nightly rematches between the two opponents. Until one night a talkative member of the troupe let it slide that &quot;The Great Unknown&quot; was another clown from this circus. The Bucharest crowd became aware of this and lead to a disturbance that cause &quot;The Great Unknown,&quot; the manager, and their troupe to narrowly escape being torn apart by the crowd. The police succeeded in suppressing, what seemed, to be a serious riot brewing that night. This event being the earliest documented masked wrestler in Romania and the earliest pro wrestling riot. 

In 1915, Mort Henderson started wrestling as the &quot;Masked Marvel&quot; in the New York area making him the earliest North American wrestler to perform with such a gimmick. In the subsequent years many wrestlers would put on a mask after they had been used in an area, or territory, that their popularity and drawing ability diminished, it would be an easy way for a wrestler to begin working in a new area as a &quot;fresh face&quot;. Sometimes workers wore masks in one territory and unmasked in another territory in order to keep their two identities separate.
===The mask in the US and Canada===
Many wrestlers have had very successful careers while masked such as The Destroyer/Dr. X, Mr. Wrestling, Masked Superstar and the Spoiler. In the days where professional wrestling was more regional, with less national television coverage, it was not uncommon for more than one person or team to use the same gimmick and mask, and there have at times been several masked &quot;Interns&quot;, &quot;Assassins&quot; and &quot;Executioners&quot; working simultaneously. Tag team wrestling has seen more masked teams, using identical masks to create unity between wrestlers. Successful masked teams include the Masked Assassins, Blue Infernos and the Grapplers.
One of the best-known North American masked wrestlers was Big Van Vader, who was also known for his in-ring agility despite his large frame during the 1980s and 90s. Other notable examples are Rey Mysterio, Mankind, Kane, Doom, Edge &amp; Christian as &#x27;Los Conquistadores&#x27; &amp; Owen Hart as &#x27;Blue Blazer&#x27;.

Today, masked wrestlers are not a common sight in the United States and Canada, but masked wrestlers have a long history in that region, dating back to 1915. A mask sometimes will be used by a well known wrestler in a storyline where they must get around various &quot;stipulations&quot; or betray a trust without revealing their true identity. For instance wrestlers who are suspended in a storyline return under a mask under another name, usually with it being very obvious who is under the mask. Examples of this include: Hulk Hogan as &quot;Mr. America&quot;, Dusty Rhodes as &quot;The Midnight Rider&quot;, André the Giant as &quot;Giant Machine&quot;, Brian Pillman as &quot;The Yellow Dog&quot;, The Miz as &quot;The Calgary Kid&quot;, Dan Marsh as &quot;Mr. X&quot; and Bo Dallas as &quot;Mr. NXT&quot;. Jimmy Valiant once returned under a mask as &quot;Charlie Brown from Outta Town&quot; after losing to Paul Jones in a &quot;Loser Leaves Town&quot; match (a stipulation where the loser of the match must resign from the organization for which he worked). Mickie James also revealed to be under the mask when she returned to WWE as Alexa Bliss&#x27;s partner.

===The mask in Lucha Libre===
The Luchador mask, known as a mascara in Spanish, “draws from Mexican history in which Mayans and Aztecs warriors would complete for superiority”. The style of the masks represent “animals, gods, mythological figures and other elements of Mexican folklore”. 

&quot;The mask is the luchador&#x27;s identity, both in and out of the ring. Luchadores will keep their faces and real names a secret throughout their entire lives; some of the more iconic luchadores have even been buried in their mask.&quot; 

WWE hall of famer El Santo is one of the most iconic luchadores. He “helped fuel the growth and reputation of lucha libre throughout the world”. “WWE Hall of Famer Eddie Guerrero once wrote that ‘Calling him a legend doesn’t even do justice to how big he was. In his heyday, Santo was bigger than Hulk Hogan and ‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin combined’”.

The Mexican fanbase quickly took to the mystery of the masked man and soon after, Mexican wrestlers themselves started wearing masks, becoming &quot;enmascarados&quot;. Early masks were simple with strong, basic colors designs that could be recognized even in the back row of the arena. Over the years, the masks evolved to become very intricate and colorful, drawing on Mexico&#x27;s rich history. 

Lucha Libre is still an incredibly popular sport in Mexico, with souvenir masks being sold at events and online. Masks are colorfully designed to evoke the images of animals, gods, ancient heroes, and other archetypes, whose identity the luchador takes on during a performance. Most wrestlers in Mexico start their career wearing a mask, but over the span of their careers, a substantial number of them will be unmasked. Sometimes, a wrestler slated for retirement will be unmasked in one of his final bouts or at the beginning of a final tour, signifying loss of identity as that character. Sometimes, losing the mask signifies the end of a gimmick, with the wrestler moving on to a new gimmick and mask, often without public acknowledgement of the wrestler&#x27;s previous persona.

The wrestling mask is considered &quot;sacred&quot;, so much so that the intentional removal of a mask is grounds for disqualification. If a wrestler is unmasked during the match, his top priority is to cover up his face and they usually get help from people at ringside to do so. Most masked wrestlers wear their masks for any and all public appearances, using the mask to keep their personal life separate from their professional life; because of the mask, most Mexican wrestlers enjoy a higher degree of anonymity about their personal lives. Some wrestlers become larger-than-life characters, such as El Santo, one of the most popular cultural icons who always wore his mask in public, revealing his face only briefly in old age, and was even buried in his trademark silver mask.

====Luchas de Apuestas====
In lucha libre, the highest achievement is not winning a championship but winning the mask of an opponent in a &quot;luchas de apuestas&quot;, a &quot;bet fight&quot; where each wrestler bets their mask. The &quot;luchas de apuestas&quot; is usually seen as the culmination of a long and heated storyline between two or more wrestlers, with the winner getting the &quot;ultimate victory&quot;. It is customary for the loser of such a match to reveal his real name, where he&#x27;s from and how long he has been a wrestler before taking the mask off to show his face. Unmasked wrestlers will wager their hair instead, risking having his or her head shaved bald in case of defeat. There can be several reasons to book a &quot;luchas de apuestas&quot; beyond the obvious purpose of elevating the winner. If the loser is a younger wrestler, then the loss of the mask can sometimes lead to a promotional push after unmasking, or the wrestler being given a new ring persona. Older wrestlers often lose their masks during the last couple of years of their career, often for a big payday depending on how long and successful a career they&#x27;ve had; the more successful the wrestler that&#x27;s unmasked, the bigger the honor for the winner.

The first &quot;luchas de apuestas&quot; match was presented on July 14, 1940 at Arena México. The defending champion Murciélago was so much lighter than his challenger Octavio that he requested a further condition before he would sign the contract: Octavio would have to put his hair on the line. Octavio won the match and Murciélago unmasked, giving birth to a tradition in lucha libre.

High-profile &quot;luchas de apuestas&quot; include El Santo winning the mask of Black Shadow, Los Villanos winning the masks of all three Los Brazos (El Brazo, Brazo de Oro and Brazo de Plata), Atlantis winning the mask of Villano III, La Parka unmasking both Cibernético and El Mesias, Villano V taking Blue Panther&#x27;s mask and Último Guerrero winning the mask of Villano V. Some wrestlers have made a career by the volume of masks they have won rather than the general quality of their opponents—wrestler Super Muñeco claims to have won over 100 masks, with at least 80 verifiable &quot;luchas de apuestas&quot; wins, while Estrella Blanca is said to have the most &quot;luchas de apuestas&quot;, with over 200 masks won.

===The mask in Japanese wrestling===
The Destroyer, an American, was the first masked wrestler to work in Japan during the 1960s but remained a novelty with very few Japanese wrestlers choosing to wear a mask. The first Japanese masked wrestler is considered to be Shozo Kobayashi, who briefly competed under a mask as &quot;Fukumen Taro&quot; (&quot;Masked Taro&quot;). In the 1970s Mil Máscaras became the first Mexican Luchador to work on a regular basis and became very popular with the fans. The original Tiger Mask, Satoru Sayama was inspired by Mil Máscaras to create the masked &quot;Tiger Mask&quot; persona. After the success of Tiger Mask several wrestlers have adopted the mask, mainly lighter wrestlers who like Sayama had a more high flying and flashy style. The wrestling mask is held in more regard by the Japanese fans than the North American fans but isn&#x27;t as &quot;sacred&quot; as the Mexican mask, meaning that the wrestler can perform both masked one day and unmasked another if he so wishes. Famous Japanese masked wrestlers include Jyushin Thunder Liger, Último Dragón, El Samurai, The Great Sasuke, Dragon Kid and Bushi.

===The mask in British wrestling===
Although at live shows, masked wrestlers were as prolific in British wrestling as its American counterpart, they were largely kept off ITV&#x27;s television coverage until the late 1960s. Successful masked wrestlers up until this point included Count Bartelli (Geoff Condliffe), the White Angel (Judo Al Hayes) and Doctor Death (promoter Paul Lincoln as the top villain of his own major independent promotion). Masked wrestlers were frequently disparaged by top promoters during this period as a symptom of the allegedly &quot;anarchic&quot; conditions in American wrestling - indeed the first masked wrestler on ITV, The Outlaw (Gordon Nelson) was announced as being an American.

The most famous masked wrestler in British history, Peter Thornley, the original British version of Kendo Nagasaki, made his professional debut - complete with masked Samurai gimmick - in 1964 but did not appear on television until 1971. Nagasaki&#x27;s first big victory was a win over mentor (and real life trainer) Bartelli in a 1966 mask vs mask match. His own mask was pulled off by opponent Big Daddy during a televised match in December 1975, an important turning point in Daddy&#x27;s rise in popularity. Nagasaki later voluntarily unmasked in a ceremony in the ring on TV in December 1977. By 1986 he was back under the mask and was the top villain of All Star Wrestling from this point until his second retirement in 1993.

Another successful masked wrestler from the 1970s was blue-eye martial artist Kung Fu, played by Eddie Hamill, who lost his mask after a 1976 televised defeat by Mick McManus but continued to wrestle unmasked still as Kung Fu, winning the British Heavy Middleweight Championship in 1986.

At Christmas 1979, Big Daddy defeated and unmasked Mr. X on television. Subsequently, during the 1980s in Joint Promotions, masked wrestlers were generally built towards being fodder for Big Daddy to defeat, unmask and humiliate in headline tag matches on ITV, such as the Spoiler (Drew McDonald) King Kendo (aka Red Devil), Battle Star, El Diablo, the Black Baron, the Masked Marauders tag team and The Emperor. Meanwhile in All Star Wrestling - apart from Nagasaki - they were mostly treated as short lived reflections of recent fads in popular culture. In 1995, All Star shows were frequently headlined by a masked tag team based on the Power Rangers franchise, until the copyright owners intervened. In the 21st century, El Ligero wrestled successfully for both the traditional and American-style promotions.

===The mask in French wrestling===
Bauer as the Masked Wrestler of Paris in the 1860s, would be followed by more masked wrestlers in his home country. A wrestling mask was known in France as a &quot;cagoule&quot; (hood) and fans would often chant &quot;he he la cagoule&quot; to encourage the babyface to unmask a masked heel. Doing so, however, was banned under French wrestling rules - if unmasked, a wrestler would crouch on the mat face-down until the referee restored his mask.

One of the earliest successes of televised wrestling in France was the feud between babyface masked wrestler L&#x27;Ange Blanc, and black clad heel masked wrestler Le Bourreau de Bethune Another successful masked heel of the 1960s was L&#x27;Homme Masqué (The Masked Man). Spanish wrestler Angelito initially wore a silver mask in France before taking it off midway through a 1971 televised match with Jacky Richard. Another Spaniard, Oscar &quot;Crusher&quot; Verdu, who wrestled under a mask as Der Henker, would win the French Heavyweight Championship in 1983. British wrestler Dave Larsen wrestled in France under a mask as Zarak. In the 1980s, masks were primarily worn as a component of more outlandish characters such as the tag teams Les Piranhas and Les Maniaks (a team of evil masked clowns) and Mambo Le Primitiv, based on the film character of King Kong. This tradition continued in the early 21st century with Cybernic Machine, a masked wrestler playing a &quot;computer virus&quot; character, who was a successful heel in France.

The original wrestling masks were often masks attached to a top that snapped in the groin making it very uncomfortable for the people wearing it. If the masks were not attached to the top, then they were made from uncomfortable material such as brushed pig skin, leather or suede. In the 1930s, a Mexican shoe maker called Antonio Martinez created a mask on request from Charro Aguayo that became the standard for wrestling masks created since then. The basic design consists of four pieces of fabric sewn together to create the basic shape that covers the entire head. The mask has openings for the eyes, nose and mouth with colorful trim around the open features, known as &quot;Antifaz&quot; in Spanish. The back of the mask is open with a &quot;tongue&quot; of fabric under laces to keep it tight enough to not come off accidentally during a match. The first variation in style came when the jaw and mouth area was removed from the mask to expose the skin. Other masks have solid material over the mouth, nose, eyes or all three, in the case of fabric covering the eyes a stretched fabric that is see through up-close is used.

Originally being made from fabric, masks have evolved and are now made from a variety of materials from cotton to nylon to various vinyl polymers in many different colours and patterns. Several additions have been made to the mask decorations over the years with the most prevalent and visually striking being foam horns and artificial hair attached to the mask. Mock ears are also commonly used, especially if the mask has an animal motif such as a tiger and other animals.

<text>The Fort Ancient culture is a Native American archaeological culture that dates back to . Members of the culture lived along the Ohio River valley, in an area running from modern-day Ohio and western West Virginia through to northern Kentucky and parts of southeastern Indiana. A contemporary of the neighboring Mississippian culture, Fort Ancient is considered to be a separate &quot;sister culture&quot;. Mitochondrial DNA evidence collected from the area suggests that the Fort Ancient culture did not directly descend from the older Hopewell Culture.

Material evidence also suggests that the Fort Ancient peoples introduced maize agriculture to Ohio, and other evidence connects this culture to the Great Serpent Mound. In 1999, an archaeological study by Brad Lepper and Tod A. Frolking used radiocarbon testing to show that the Alligator Effigy Mound in Granville also dates to the Fort Ancient era, rather than the assumed Hopewell era. Both the Serpent and Alligator Mounds, first understood as burial locations, have been shown to be Fort Ancient ceremonial effigy sites.

==Name==
Although the name of the culture originates from the earthworks site at Fort Ancient, Ohio, this site is believed to have been built by the Ohio Hopewellian people and only occupied later by the Fort Ancient culture. The site is on a hill above the Little Miami River, close to Lebanon, Ohio. Despite the name of the site, most archaeologists do not believe that Fort Ancient was used as a fortress by either the Ohio Hopewell culture or the Fort Ancient culture. It is believed to have been a ceremonial location.

==Archaeological record==
===Chronology===

In about 1000 CE, terminal Late Woodland groups in the Middle Ohio Valley adopted maize agriculture. They settled in small, year-round, nuclear family households and settlements of up to 40-50 individuals. These scattered settlements, located along terraces that overlooked rivers and occasionally on flood plains, would be occupied only briefly before the groups would migrate elsewhere.

By 1200 CE, the small villages had grown into settlements of up to 300 people. These settlements were occupied for up to 25 years. The houses were designed as single-family dwellings during the Early and Middle Fort Ancient periods. Later, Fort Ancient buildings became more extensive and could house multiple families. Settlements were rarely more permanent than one or two generations, as inhabitants generally migrated once natural resources surrounding the village had been exhausted. Villages were arranged around an open oval central plaza, surrounded by circular and rectangular domestic structures facing this plaza.

The arrangement of buildings in Fort Ancient settlements is believed to have served as a solar calendar, marking the positions of the solstices and other significant dates. The occupants also built low platform mounds for ceremonial purposes, and many villages added defensive palisades to their boundaries. The plaza served as the focal point of village life, hosting communal activities such as ceremonies, games (such as the hoop and stick game Chunkey), and other significant social events.

The Late Fort Ancient period from 1400 to 1750 CE was the protohistoric era of the Middle Ohio Valley. During this era, the formerly dispersed populations began to coalesce. The Gist-phase villages (1400 to 1550 CE) became more significant than during the preceding period, with populations as high as 500. Archaeologists have speculated that the larger villages and palisades are evidence that after 1450, warfare and inter-group strife increased, leading the people to consolidate their villages for better protection.

Increased contact with Mississippian people also likely occurred in this era, some of them may even have migrated to and been integrated into Fort Ancient villages. The Madisonville horizon of artifacts after 1400 CE include relatively high proportions of bowls, salt pans, triangular strap handles, colanders, negative painted pottery, notched and beaded rims, and some effigies. These items and styles are usually associated with the Mississippian cultures of the Lower Ohio Valley, at sites such as Angel Mounds and Kincaid Mounds. These sites were abandoned during this time.

During the Montour phase (1550 to 1700), villages were occupied year-round, although less densely in the winter than in the summer months. This may indicate that during the winter, family groups and hunting parties may have returned to the regions previously occupied by their ancestors. Such a pattern was observed during historic times, for example, among the Miami and Potawatomi. Through trading activities, the Fort Ancient people gained access to European trade items such as glass, iron, brass, and copper. These materials have all been found as grave goods at sites such as Lower Shawneetown and Hardin Village. Such artifacts appeared and were used in the area before the arrival of European explorers or settlers.

Although the inhabitants of Fort Ancient did not encounter European settlers at this time, they, like other groups in the interior of the continent, may have suffered high fatalities from their diseases, transmitted among Native Americans by trade contacts. The next-known inhabitants of the area, who were encountered by French and English explorers, were the historic Shawnee tribe. Scholars believe that the Fort Ancient society, like the Mississippian cultures to the south and west, may have been severely disrupted by waves of infectious disease epidemics from the first Spanish explorers in the mid-16th century.

After 1525, at the Madisonville site, the type site for the Madisonville phase, dwellings were built on a smaller scale and in fewer numbers. This change indicated the culture was less attached to agriculture and a sedentary life. Scholars generally believe that similarities in material culture, art, mythology, and Shawnee oral history link the historic tribe to the Fort Ancient people. However, there is also evidence that the Algonquian Shawnee culture may have been more of an admixture or intrusion to the site, which may have previously been Siouan occupied.

==Evolution of society==
===Early phase &quot;( 1000–1250 CE)&quot;===
During this period, the Fort Ancients were several poor, sedentary societies. They lived in non-palisaded villages and had slight regional variances. The locals farmed primarily corn, beans, and sunflower—the latter being a plant first domesticated as a food source in Ohio. Most homes were what is known as a pit house, created by digging several feet into the ground and covering over the top of the resulting hole with a wooden frame roof covered in bark. Carbon dating has shown that Fort Ancient lands in West Virginia did not begin to be conquered until the middle phase.

===Middle phase &quot;(approx. 1250–1450 CE)&quot;===

At this time, the cultures became far richer, began to expand, and began to merge into a single, continuous culture. Villages grew larger, became palisaded and pit houses began to be phased out in favor of the style of native dwelling colonial peoples would refer to as a Cabin style. This was a rectangular, peak-roofed home of either an adobe-like or wooden make and covered over by the same style of roof as the pit house.

Elsewhere, the far richer and larger Mississippian culture began shifting its centers away from the Mississippi River and into the American Southeast. Iroquoian expansions to the northeast of the Fort Ancients brought new Algonquian and Iroquoian neighbors into their region. The result of these migrations was Fort Ancients adopting aspects of these cultures. Eastern Fort Ancients began amalgamating a mound burial with Iroquoian techniques of removing the flesh and organs of the dead and urn burials. In western Ohio, there is strong evidence that they took on the Algonquian Green Corn Ceremony, in which part of the immature corn crop was &quot;sacrificed&quot; by burning and its ashes were used to fertilize the fields. Around 1300, however, it appears that mound burials were replaced entirely by the Eastern Siouan tradition of under-the-home burials.

===Late phase &quot;(approx. 1450–1750 CE)&quot;===
The late phase of Fort Ancient culture was its zenith. Only one known Fort Ancient tribe has been verified by name in the historical record—the Mosopelea, presumably of southeast Ohio. There is also a chance that a Siouan people called the Keyauwee, who appear alongside the Tutelo (an Eastern Siouan tribe from West Virginia) in North Carolina around 1700 could also have been of Fort Ancient stock. During the time of the French explorers, a Ho-chunk native named Tonti told them that these people had been known as the &quot;Chonque&quot;. Mosopelea language is marked as being the only known Siouan tongue to use the &quot;f&quot; sound, which is far more common among the Muskogean languages of the Mississippians.

Despite no historical accounts of contact existing, there has been a remarkable amount of European-made goods excavated from Fort Ancient sites—including brass and steel items, as well as glassware. Fort Ancients even melted down old or broken goods and re-forged them into new items. No single gun part has yet been discovered in conjunction with a Fort Ancient site. The Fort Ancients were heavily affected by European disease, as well as the Beaver Wars period. Carbon dating seems to indicate that disease affected the Fort Ancients in waves. The most recent of all surviving sites date from Northern Kentucky alone—those from 1680 onwards. Although French explorers are known to have arrived during that time, they appear to have left no authentic accounts of contact. However, the French did note that most of both sides of the Ohio River Valley were covered in similarly styled villages in various states of destruction or abandonment.

===Four foci===
The Fort Ancient culture is divided into four distinct local variations known as foci. These are the Madisonville focus, the Baum focus, the Fort focus, and the Anderson focus. Additionally, Fort Ancient culture can be subdivided into at least 8 phases that span different time periods and regions of southern Ohio and adjacent states. There was an increasing similarity between Fort Ancient phases leading up to 1650 CE, characterized by the presence of native artifacts and European trade goods found at the Madisonville site.

===Social hierarchy===

The rise in socio-political complexity evidenced by the building of substructure mounds and new village layouts may indicate influences from Middle Mississippian cultures down the Ohio River (the north-eastern-most extent of Middle Mississippian was the Prather Complex in the Falls of the Ohio region away). The differences in ceramics show that Fort Ancient culture was distinct from that of the Middle Mississippian peoples, lacking Mississippian traits such as political centralization and elite social structures.

Although there seem to have been positions of leadership, the Fort Ancient culture appears to have been egalitarian. Grave goods rarely vary between individuals, which shows that social levels were weakly defined. Scholars believe that their societies were organized into groups based on kinship. If social organization was based on kinship, people likely achieved some status by virtue of personal qualities, such as generosity, charisma, and being a good hunter, as well as their deeds. People of higher status were probably leaders of communities and were potentially responsible for organizing trade, settling disputes among other members of the village, and presiding over ceremonies. Evidence indicates that Fort Ancient leadership was more like that of the historic Iroquois, whose egalitarian obligations left leaders to be buried with no more than others of their age.

===Ceramics===
Pottery making was primarily the responsibility of women using a technique known as coiling. Potters rolled clay into long, rounded strips, which they used to model the vessel, layering strips on top of each other. The items were then smoothed out internally with a potter anvil (a smooth round stone), and externally with a wooden paddle. Cord-marking and engraving were used to decorate pots in styles according to particular periods and peoples.

At the time, Fort Ancient pottery was known for having thinner walls than preceding Woodland pottery. Common items include large plain cooking jars with strap or loop handles. A hallmark of Fort Ancient pottery is engraved decorations on the rim and neck of the vessels, consisting of a series of interlocking lines, called &quot;Guilloché&quot;. As this design emerged with the beginning of the Fort Ancient culture in the region, scholars used it as a characteristic to identify the culture.
====Mississippian influences====
During the Early Fort Ancient period, grit (crushed stone) and grog (crushed pottery) were often used as tempering agents, with ground mussel shells occasionally being used. Over time, women increasingly chose mussel shells or a mixture of mussel shells with other agents as the tempering agent. The use of ground shells as a temper is a feature often associated with Mississippian cultures, and its acceptance spread in Fort Ancient culture, moving north and east from the Ohio River and the direction of the closest Mississippian groups in the southwest.

With the change of temper, different vessel forms and decorations became more prevalent; several of them are also strongly associated with Mississippian cultures. Early Fort Ancient vessels were often jug forms with lug handles. By the Middle Fort Ancient period, bowls and plates were being produced more frequently, and artisans added strap handles. Negative painting (a decoration often associated with the Angel phase sites in the Lower Ohio Valley) and Ramey Incised designs (elite motifs associated with the Cahokia polity in Illinois) have been found on some pots. Others show a blending of different styles, for instance, with the engraved guilloché decoration overlaid with negative painting. Archaeological excavations have found examples of non-local pottery from this period as well. The pieces were made from non-local clay sources, and have designs or vessel forms atypical for local wares. A head pot was discovered at the Madisonville site similar to those produced in the Central Mississippi Valley by the peoples of the Middle Mississippian Parkin and Nodena phases. Archaeologists suggest that the change in pottery styles was a result of increased contact with the Mississippian cultures to the south and west of the Fort Ancient peoples.

===Tools===
The Fort Ancient peoples made tools from a variety of materials, including stone, bone, horn, shells and antlers. Stone tools have been found more frequently than those of other materials. The culture is known for its distinctive small triangular flint arrowheads and large triangular flint knives. Fort Ancients made hoes for farming from mussel shells. Fort Ancients had also grounded and polished stones into axes to use in felling trees. Most of the flint tools were made from varieties of locally available materials, showing the Fort Ancient peoples either felt no need for it or did not have access to exotic stone varieties through trade routes.

===Diet===
The Fort Ancient were primarily a farming and hunting people. Their diet was mainly composed of the New World staples that are known as the three sisters (maize, squash, and beans). This diet was supplemented by hunting and fishing in nearby forests and rivers. Important game species included the black bear, turkey, white tail deer and elk. Archaeologists have found evidence at some sites which suggests that turkeys were kept in pens. The average lifespan during this time period decreased from that of their ancestors. The people were smaller in stature and less able to fend off infectious diseases than previous generations. Archaeological investigations of their cemeteries have shown that almost all of Fort Ancient&#x27;s people showed pathology of some kind, with a high incidence of dental disease and arthritis.

==Contemporaries and neighbors==
To the northeast in present-day Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio and West Virginia were the peoples of the Monongahela culture, who inhabited the Monongahela River Valley from 1050 to 1635. They had a similar lifestyle to the Fort Ancients; as they were also maize agriculturalists and lived in well laid out palisaded villages with central oval plazas, some of which consisted of as many as 50-100 structures. To the northwest of the Fort Ancients were the people of the Oliver phase who lived along the east and west forks of the White River in central and southern Indiana from 1200 and 1450. Their villages were also circular with palisades. Although their sites began in central Indiana, over the years they spread to the southeast toward the Fort Ancients. The Oliver phase people were part of the Western Basin Tradition which also includes the Springwell&#x27;s phase, the Younge phase, and the Riviere au Vase phases of Northern Ohio and Indiana. The colder weather of the Little Ice Age may have caused inter-group battles over food and other resources, according to some scholars. The crops did not prosper as well during this colder period, causing food shortages for populations that had grown after their introduction. Some studies show that the culture began failing due to poor health conditions.

These groups, along with others such as the Oneota, were once classified as Upper Mississippian cultures under the assumption that they were either Mississippian peoples intruding into these areas, or they were heavily influenced by the Mississippian peoples to their south and east. Today it is thought that these groups were local in situ developments of Late Woodland peoples.

Located down the Ohio River to the southwest of the westernmost Fort Ancient settlements were the Middle Mississippian culture peoples of the Prather Complex. This stretch of river was an empty buffer zone, possibly for social or political reasons, although it might possibly have been because the narrowing of the alluvial valley between the Falls of the Ohio region near Louisville, Kentucky and the mouth of the Miami River at Cincinnati, Ohio made it less suitable for the intensive maize agriculture practiced by both societies.

==Possible symbolism==
Many artifacts have been found associated with the Fort Ancients, the most common being four-handled funerary urns, salamanders and snakes. Possible symbolism of the urn may be a connection to common Siouan religious beliefs. At least one artifact containing the Siouan religious symbol known as the medicine wheel (a cross inside of a circle) has been found. This stands, primarily, for the fact that all life sprung from the same place and returns to that source in the end. The four-handled urns may be to evoke that symbol, more so than having any real, practical use.

Two possibilities of the salamander motif can also be explored. One possibility is that, like in Plains Indian culture, salamanders represented boys and turtles represented girls. Mothers would have a special medicine pouch made for one or the other to represent their children and containing the umbilical cord, which they would wear so long as both still lived. The other possibility comes from the Eastern Siouan&#x27;s, who express a belief that &quot;when a Salamander barks, someone will soon die.&quot; As such, the salamander may have been a sort of death omen to the Fort Ancients or had something to do with the door between the living and dead worlds.

The Serpent Burial Mound was made specifically to mirror a constellation known to many Siouan peoples, known as the Snake. It is depicted as swallowing an egg whole, representing the struggle against overwhelming odds for the sake of the people. Furthermore, some Siouan peoples seem to have believed that the stars seen at night were a mirror of the spirit world itself, each one representing an ancestor at peace. Therefore, this mound may have been a special place to bury those with special honors, in order to anchor such people and their descendants to the earth. This symbolic connection to the Snake constellation suggests that this mound may have been especially significant to the Fort Ancients.

<doc id="903196" wikidata="Q778644" url="?curid=903196" title="Multi Emulator Super System">
<text>Multi Emulator Super System (MESS) was an emulator for various consoles and computer systems, based on the MAME core. It used to be a standalone program (which has since been discontinued), but is now integrated into MAME (which is actively developed).
MESS emulated portable and console gaming systems, computer platforms, and calculators. The project strived for accuracy and portability and therefore was not always the fastest emulator for any one particular system. Its accuracy made it also useful for homebrew game development.

As of April 2015 MESS supported 994 unique systems with 2,106 total system variations. MESS was first released in 1998 and was under development up until 2015.

MAME and MESS were once separate applications, but were later developed and released together from a single source repository. MAMEDEV member David Haywood maintained and distributed UME (Universal Machine Emulator) which combined much of the functionality of MAME and MESS in a single application. On May 27, 2015, MESS was formally integrated with MAME and became a part of MAME.

== License ==
MESS was distributed under the MAME Licence, which allowed for the redistribution of binary files and source code, either modified or unmodified, but disallowed selling MESS or using it commercially. The license is similar to other copyleft licenses in requiring that rights and obligations provided in the license must be remain intact when MESS or derivative works are distributed.

In addition to the MESS Licence, The MESS Team required that: &quot;MESS must be distributed only in the original archives. You are not allowed to distribute a modified version, nor to remove and/or add files to the archive. Adding one text file to advertise your web site is tolerated only if your site contributes original material to the emulation scene.&quot; The MAME license required source code be included with versions of MESS that are modified from the original source, while the MESS legal page states that when distributing binary files &quot;you should also distribute the source code. If you can&#x27;t do that, you must provide a pointer to a place where the source can be obtained.&quot;

While MESS was available in both binary and source code forms, the restrictions on commercial exploitation cause it to fall outside of the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s definition of free software. Similarly MESS was not considered to be open source software if appraised according to the criteria of the Open Source Definition.

== Challenges ==
Generally the emulation only includes raw hardware logic, such as for the CPU and RAM, and specialized DSPs such as tone generators or video sprites. The MESS emulator does not include any programming code stored in ROM chips from the emulated computer, since this may be copyrighted software.

Obtaining the ROM data by oneself directly from the hardware being emulated can be extremely difficult, technical, expensive, and even destructive since it may require decapping or desoldering of integrated circuit chips from the circuit board of the device they own. A desoldered IC is placed into a chip reader device connected to a USB or serial port of another computer, with pin sockets on the reader specifically designed to match the chip package shape in question, to perform a memory dump of the ROM to a data file.

Removal of a soldered chip is often far easier than reinstalling it, especially for extremely small surface mount technology chips, and the emulated device in question will be destroyed beyond recovery after the ROM has been removed for reading.

However, if one has a working system, it may be far easier to dump the ROM data to tape, disk, etc. and transfer the data file to one&#x27;s target machine.

== Uses ==
In 2013 the Internet Archive began to provide select games browser-playable via &quot;JSMESS&quot; (a JavaScript port of the MESS emulator), for instance, the Atari 2600 game &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;.

<text>U.S. Route 460 (US 460) is an auxiliary route of U.S. Route 60. It currently runs for 655 miles (1,054 km) from Norfolk, Virginia, at its parent route U.S. Route 60 at Ocean View to Frankfort, Kentucky, intersecting its parent route once again. It passes through the states of Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. It goes through the cities and towns of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Petersburg, Farmville, Lynchburg, Roanoke, Christiansburg, Blacksburg, Tazewell, and Grundy, in Virginia; Princeton and Bluefield in West Virginia; and Pikeville, Georgetown, and Frankfort in Kentucky.

The section from Interstate 81 at Christiansburg, Virginia, to U.S. Route 23 in Pikeville, Kentucky, is Corridor Q in the Appalachian Development Highway System. The portion improved under this system is unfinished between Grundy, Virginia, and Pikeville.

US 460 is a major east–west highway in Virginia. It is a major thoroughfare through southern Hampton Roads and connects the area to Petersburg. US 460 connects Lynchburg to Roanoke. US 460 is paired with US 221 between Bedford and Roanoke and with US 11 between Salem and Christiansburg. It is also the primary east–west roadway in the northern part of Southwest Virginia between Christiansburg and the Kentucky border; several miles near Bluefield pass through West Virginia.

==Route description==
===Kentucky===
US 460 now begins when it splits from US 60 a few miles east of downtown Frankfort. It is a winding two-lane highway with no shoulders and intersects US 62 and I-75 at Georgetown. It proceeds to Paris, where it serves as the town&#x27;s &quot;Main Street&quot; and intersects US 27 and US 68. The next major intersection is with I-64 in Mount Sterling. It proceeds through Frenchburg and West Liberty. In Salyersville, the Mountain Parkway ends by merging onto it. It is a 3-lane highway for 14 miles and then it merges with US 23 in Paintsville. US 460 East follows US-23 South through Prestonsburg and Pikeville. The route enters the southwestern part of Virginia.

===Virginia and West Virginia===

U.S. Route 460 runs east–west through the southern part of Virginia. It has two separate pieces in Virginia, joined by a relatively short section in West Virginia. Most of US 460 is a four-lane divided highway.

US 460 from Interstate 81 at Christiansburg west to Pikeville, Kentucky, including the piece in West Virginia, is Corridor Q of the Appalachian Development Highway System. From West Virginia east to I-81, US 460 is also part of the proposed Interstate 73.

==History==
The earliest origins of this road were as part of the track once known as the Trader&#x27;s Path, a Virginia colonial trail dating from the 17th century that led from Augusta County to present-day Roanoke.
Before it was commissioned as a federally designated route in the late 1940s, US 460 was designated as Kentucky Route 4 from the western Virginia state line near Grundy to Millard, Kentucky. It was Kentucky Route 40 from Paintsville to Lexington.

In the pre-Interstate era, US 460 was a major highway, passing from Frankfort through Louisville, Kentucky and Evansville, Indiana, and ending in St. Louis, Missouri, after crossing the MacArthur Bridge.

Interstate 64 has supplanted most of old US 460 as a more direct route. The stretch through Indiana and Illinois was eliminated in November 1976. Old US 460 has been redesignated in these areas as parts of State Road 66 and State Road 62 in Indiana; and part of Illinois Route 15, Illinois Route 142, and Illinois Route 14 in that state. However, its parent route, US 60 has not been supplanted by I-64 and converted to a state highway in the greater Louisville area.

Many years after the road&#x27;s elimination in Indiana in 1977, some older residents and even businesses along what is now Indiana State Road 62 still refer to the road as &quot;Highway 460.&quot; Older billboards retain that designation in the St. Meinrad area. Some current telephone books also contain listings for those living on &quot;Hwy 460.&quot;

When Fishtrap Lake was created in Pike County, Kentucky, US 460 was realigned to its current route from Salyersville to Paintsville. The former US 460 leading to the lake is now Kentucky Routes 1499 and 1789. The part between Paintsville and Millard remained U.S. Highway 23 and Kentucky Route 80.

== Future ==
Future Corridor Q (currently signed as Kentucky Route 3174) is being constructed south of the current alignment of US 460 as a four-lane divided highway from Pikeville to Grundy. The current alignment is a rural two-lane road winding along the rivers and mountains of Virginia and Kentucky. After the segment is completed, US 460 is to be realigned onto that segment and be concurrent with future US 121 (Coalfield Expressway) in Virginia.
