<text>Frank Daryl Tanana (born July 3, 1953) is an American former professional baseball left-handed pitcher. In a Major League Baseball career that stretched from 1973 to 1993, he pitched for the California Angels, Boston Red Sox, Texas Rangers, Detroit Tigers, New York Mets, and New York Yankees. He struck out 2,773 batters in his career. He won playoff-clinching games for the teams he was on twice: once for the Angels in 1979, and once for the Tigers in 1987.

Raised in northwest Detroit, Tanana was a first-round draft pick by the Angels in 1971. He made his debut with the team in 1973 and won 14 games his rookie year. Tanana and fellow starter Nolan Ryan formed one of the toughest pairs of starting pitchers to hit against in baseball. Tanana led the American League (AL) in strikeouts in 1975, then made the AL All-Star team three years in a row. He won 19 games in 1976 and led the AL with a 2.54 earned run average (ERA) in 1977. In 1979, he won the game that clinched the Angels&#x27; first-ever playoff appearance. Injuries began to take their toll on him by the end of his tenure with the Angels, and he changed his style from relying on a hard fastball to throwing a repertoire of slower pitches, using deception to get hitters out instead.

Tanana was traded to Boston for the 1981 season; he went 4–10 with the Red Sox before becoming a free agent and signing with the Rangers. He tied for the AL lead in losses his first year with Texas, then failed to make their starting rotation at the beginning of the 1983 season, though he returned to it in June. In 1984, he had a 15–15 record for the team, his most wins since 1978. After getting off to a poor start with Texas in 1985, he was traded to Detroit, the team he rooted for growing up. Tanana would stay with the Tigers through 1992, pitching eight seasons with the club. He threw a shutout in the final game of the 1987 season to clinch a playoff spot for the team, winning 15 games that year. In 1988, he won 14 games; in 1989, he posted a 3.58 ERA. He was removed from the rotation for a time in 1990, only winning nine games that year, but the next season, he became the Tigers&#x27; first pitcher besides Jack Morris to start on Opening Day since 1979. This was the fifth Opening Day start of Tanana&#x27;s career, as he had made four for the Angels in the 1970s. He won 13 games apiece in 1991 and 1992 before pitching one more season with the Mets and the Yankees in 1993.

After becoming a born-again Christian in November 1983, Tanana became a leader among baseball&#x27;s Christian community. He has continued to serve in the ministry following his retirement, serving as an elder in his church, assisting the Tigers&#x27; chaplain, and performing Bible studies and marriage counselling. He lives in Farmington Hills, Michigan.

==Early life==
Tanana grew up in the northwest part of Detroit, Michigan. His father, also named Frank, had played professional baseball in the 1950s and was on the 1955 Eastern League championship team, the Reading Indians, before he left baseball and joined the Detroit Police Department to support his family. After young Frank got done with homework, he and his friends would spend the rest of the afternoon playing various sports. He rooted for the hometown Detroit Tigers growing up, listing Al Kaline, Mickey Lolich, Willie Horton, and Mickey Stanley among his favorite players.

Tanana attended Detroit Catholic Central High School, an all-boys school; though it was seven miles from his home, he was attracted to it after seeing their basketball team featured on the front page of a newspaper sports section. He made all-state twice in basketball, but it was in baseball he excelled, as he had a 32–1 record in his high school career. In a cocky moment his senior year, he threw sidearm to a hitter and injured his shoulder. He pitched through the injury for the rest of the year until leaving the mound after the fourth inning of the championship game, when the pain got to be too much for him. Thinking the injury would hurt his baseball chances, he had just about decided to attend Duke University on a basketball scholarship when the California Angels made him their first-round draft pick in 1971.

==Minor league career==
Tanana was assigned to the Idaho Falls Angels of the rookie-level Pioneer League in 1971, but tendinitis in his shoulder prevented him from pitching. Instead, he received cortisone treatments. &quot;I tell you, I didn&#x27;t have many friends on that team,&quot; Tanana said. &quot;Here were guys being cut off the team, and I, who couldn&#x27;t throw, was staying because I had this bonus.&quot; Arm feeling better in 1972, he pitched for the Single-A Quad Cities Angels, posting a 7–2 record. In 1973, he spent most of the season with the Double-A El Paso Sun Kings. &quot;He struck out 14 in his first game for us,&quot; El Paso (and later Angel) manager Norm Sherry said. &quot;Right then, I knew he could pitch.&quot; Tanana also pitched a couple games for the Triple-A Salt Lake City Angels before getting called up in September and added to the Angels starting rotation.

==Major league career==
===California Angels===
Along with Nolan Ryan, Tanana anchored the pitching staff of the California Angels from 1973 to 1979. This led to the saying, &quot;Tanana and Ryan and two days of cryin&#x27;&quot;, an indication of just how much the two meant to the rotation. (This was a variation on &quot;Spahn and Sain, then pray for rain,&quot; referring to the pitchers of the Boston Braves of the late 1940s.) The duo were considered two of the toughest pitching teammates in history, drawing comparisons to Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Tanana described pitching with Ryan as &quot;exciting,&quot; saying, &quot;He was just an amazing athlete, and you know we both wanted to be the best pitcher on the team, so it was good for both of us—that good, healthy competition. We had a wonderful staff.&quot;

Tanana made four starts with the Angels in September 1973. His major league debut was September 9, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Kansas City Royals. Tanana only lasted four innings, giving up four runs and taking the loss. His next start, on September 14, also was against Kansas City—Tanana threw a complete game this time, only allowing two runs (one earned) to earn his first major league victory. He threw a complete game shutout in the Angels&#x27; last game of the year on September 30, allowing just two hits in a 3–0 win over the Minnesota Twins.

In his first full season, Tanana was named the Angels&#x27; number two starter, behind Ryan. An elbow injury during the season caused Tanana to lose seven games in a row at one point; Tanana could not remember losing more than two games in a row before in his career. &quot;My confidence was taking a beating, but I knew it wouldn&#x27;t last forever,&quot; he said. After losing his 19th game September 22, Tanana was in danger of losing 20 games his rookie season, as there were still seven games to go. In his next start, September 27, he gave up two runs and was losing until pinch-hitter Doug Howard drove in two runs in the seventh inning to give him and the Angels a 3–2 victory over the Minnesota Twins. Then, in the last game of the year against the Oakland Athletics, he threw a shutout in a 2–0 victory. In 39 games (35 starts) his rookie year, Tanana had a 14–19 record, a 3.12 earned run average (ERA), 12 complete games (four shutouts), and 180 strikeouts in innings pitched. The 180 strikeouts were seventh in the American League (AL) (teammate Ryan led the league with 367), the four shutouts were tied for sixth (with five other pitchers), and Tanana did not lead the league in losses, as four other pitchers tied him for third behind Lolich (21) and Clyde Wright (20).
In the first game of a doubleheader on June 21, 1975, Tanana struck out 17 batters in a 4–2 victory over the Texas Rangers, becoming the first left-hander in AL history to have that many strikeouts in a game. &quot;Everybody stood up and applauded for me in the ninth inning,&quot; he remembered. &quot;I felt invincible.&quot; He threw 13 shutout innings on September 22 against the Chicago White Sox, yet left with a no decision because neither Jim Kaat nor Rich Gossage had allowed a run thus far—the game would go to 16 innings before the Angels eventually won 3–0. Tanana struck out 13. At season&#x27;s end, Tanana&#x27;s 269 strikeouts led the American League; it would be the only time from 1972 to 1979 that anyone other than teammate Ryan, injured, led the AL in strikeouts. Tanana placed fourth in ERA (2.62), tied for third with three others with five shutouts, and had a 16–9 record on the season. He and Kaat tied for fourth in AL Cy Young Award voting after the season.

With Ryan coming off a year in which he had missed time with injury, Tanana was named the Angels&#x27; Opening Day starter for 1976. As it turned out, 1976 would be the first of four straight Opening Day starts for Tanana. He was named an All-Star for the first time in 1976. The Angels&#x27; offense did not always score a lot for him; on August 27, 1976, he and Catfish Hunter of the New York Yankees each pitched 13 scoreless innings in a game where both men received a no-decision. It was the second year in a row Tanana had thrown 13 scoreless innings without getting a decision, but the Angels would lose this one in 15, 5–0. At season&#x27;s end, he was among the league leaders once again in wins (19, tied with Mark Fidrych and Ed Figueroa for fourth), ERA (2.43, behind Fidrych&#x27;s 2.34 and Vida Blue&#x27;s 2.35), strikeouts (261, second to a healthy Ryan&#x27;s 327), and complete games (23, tied with Jim Palmer for second behind Fidrych&#x27;s 24). With a 19–10 record, he came close to winning twenty games, missing the mark because of a midseason injury and also an August 22 outing against the Yankees where, having allowed only two hits going into the ninth, he started taking it easy, gave up six runs and was removed, and received a no decision, though the Angels eventually won 11–8 in eleven. As it turned out, 19 wins would be his career high. He came in third in Cy Young voting behind Palmer and Fidrych and also got votes for the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.

For the second year in a row, Tanana made the All-Star Game in 1977. In July, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; forecasted that he might reach 25 wins on the season. From April 29 through July 3, he threw 14 straight complete games. Shortly after the streak, though, he got an inflamed tendon in his left arm and had to be shut down for almost two weeks. After he returned, his arm was still tired, and the Angels had to shut him down for the rest of the year after September 5. Still, United Press International called the 1977 season his best year. He led the AL in earned run average (ERA) (2.54) and shutouts (7) while posting a 15–9 record. His 205 strikeouts were good for third in the league, behind Ryan&#x27;s 341 and Dennis Leonard&#x27;s 244. He finished ninth in Cy Young voting after the season.

Tanana started the 1978 season strong, with a 1–0 shutout of Oakland on Opening Day. He was named to the All-Star Game for the third year in a row. Through the end of July, he had a 14–6 record and a 2.99 ERA. However, his numbers were not as good in his final 11 starts; though his record was 4–6, his ERA hopped up to 5.22. Still, Tanana finished the year with an 18–12 record, tying with Lary Sorensen and Fergie Jenkins for ninth in the AL in wins. He threw ten complete games and tied with four others for fifth in the league in shutouts, with four. His 3.65 ERA was the highest of his career at the time, though, and his strikeout total dropped to 137, even though he threw 239 innings.

By the end of 1978, Tanana had stopped throwing as hard, relying on changing speeds of his pitches to get hitters out instead of a devastating fastball. Though he had recovered from the tendinitis that had plagued him in 1977, fear of the pain coming back caused him to alter his delivery and go with a slower approach. After giving up six runs in two innings on June 10, 1979, against the Detroit Tigers, Tanana was shut down for a couple months with shoulder tendinitis. The injury kept him out two months of the 1979 season with a shoulder injury, but through intensive therapy, he was able to pitch in September. Limited to 18 games (17 starts), he had a 7–5 record, a 3.89 ERA, and 46 strikeouts in innings.

For the first time in Tanana&#x27;s career, as well as in California&#x27;s history, the Angels made the playoffs, winning the AL West, with Tanana allowing one run in a complete game against the Royals on September 25 to clinch the division for the team. Tanana started Game 3 of the AL Championship Series (ALCS) against the Baltimore Orioles, limiting them to one run through five innings. He was taken out in the sixth, though, after giving up two straight singles and a walk to open the frame. Don Aase came in and got three straight outs, but the first was a sacrifice fly off the bat of Doug DeCinces that scored a run, tying the game for the Orioles and making Tanana ineligible for the win. The Angels ultimately prevailed 4–3, but that would be their only win of the series, as Baltimore beat them in four games.

Tanana slipped to fifth in the Angels&#x27; starting rotation in 1980. After going 2–6 through the month of May, he had his turn in the rotation skipped at the beginning of June. Through June 4, he had a 7.93 ERA. After that, he pitched better for the rest of the year, with his ERA going down to 3.33 in his last 23 starts. In 32 games (31 starts), Tanana had an 11–12 record, a 4.15 ERA, and 113 strikeouts in 204 innings pitched.

===Boston Red Sox===
On January 23, 1981, the Angels traded Tanana to the Boston Red Sox along with Jim Dorsey and Joe Rudi for Steve Renko and Fred Lynn (who the Red Sox worried they would lose to free agency because of paperwork errors). &quot;I stunk,&quot; Tanana summarized his performance for Boston. He pitched for the Red Sox for a single season, earning only 4 victories against 10 losses (the 10 losses tied with five others for 8th in the AL in a strike-shortened season). While his 4.01 ERA was better than the previous season, he struggled to pitch at Fenway Park, where he had a 5.36 ERA. &quot;Anything can happen in this ballpark, like in a pinball game,&quot; he later described Fenway. He would have finished 3–10, but he threw a shutout against the Cleveland Indians on October 3 in his last start of the year (at Cleveland Stadium, not Fenway). Despite the finish, he was granted free agency by the Red Sox on November 13, 1981.

===Texas Rangers===
Tanana signed as a free agent with Texas Rangers on January 6, 1982. His contract was for $375,000 a year for two years, plus a $75,000 signing bonus. His first season with the Rangers, his ERA went up to 4.21, only 0.20 higher than his previous season with the Red Sox. However, the Rangers lost 98 games, and Tanana was responsible for 18 of those, tying with Matt Keough for the AL lead in losses while only earning seven wins.

For the first time in his career in 1983, Tanana was not a part of his team&#x27;s starting rotation, opening the season as a long reliever for the Rangers. He had a 1.57 ERA in eight games, though, and returned to the rotation June 10, allowing one run and three hits in six innings in a 4–2 victory over the Twins. Through August 22, he had a 7–4 record, but he went on a five-game losing streak to end the year, finishing up 7–9. He appeared in 29 games (22 starts), had a 3.16 ERA, and struck out 108 in innings.

Back in the rotation for good in 1984, Tanana had his best season since 1978 for a Rangers team that finished in last place in its division. He threw eight shutout innings April 21 in a 1–0 victory over the Yankees, then threw his first shutout since 1981 on June 13 in a 3–0 victory over the Twins. He finished the season with a 15–15 record, a 3.25 ERA, and 141 strikeouts in innings pitched.

1985 did not start well for Tanana, as he posted a 2–7 record with a 5.91 ERA through his first 13 starts. Teammates were sympathetic—&quot;He hasn&#x27;t pitched the way he&#x27;s capable of pitching, and we haven&#x27;t played as well as we&#x27;re capable of playing behind him,&quot; assessed fellow starter Charlie Hough. Tanana himself was more critical of his performance: &quot;Awful. Absolutely awful.&quot; He was traded by the Rangers to the Detroit Tigers for minor-league pitcher Duane James on June 20, 1985.

While with the Rangers, Tanana served as the team&#x27;s player representative.

===Detroit Tigers===

&quot;It was a wonderful gift from the Lord,&quot; Tanana said of getting to come play with the Tigers. &quot;I was raised here and to have the opportunity to play for the Tigers was a dream come true.&quot;

Tanana threw seven shutout innings in his debut with the Tigers June 23, 1985, helping Detroit beat the Yankees 3–1. His ERA went down with Detroit, and he won each of his last five starts. In 20 starts for Detroit, Tanana had a 10–7 record, a 3.34 ERA, and 107 strikeouts in innings pitched. In a combined 33 starts between Texas and Detroit, he had a 12–14 record, a 4.27 ERA, and 159 strikeouts in 215 innings.

On May 29, 1986, Tanana allowed one run against the Twins, coming within one out of a complete game before getting pulled in favor of Willie Hernández after allowing a double and a walk with two outs in the ninth. Twice that year, he had ten-strikeout games—the first in a 14–0 shutout of the Seattle Mariners on August 23, and the second in only seven innings on September 25, though Tanana allowed four runs and took the loss to the Toronto Blue Jays that day. In 32 games (31 starts), he had a 12–9 record, a 4.16 ERA, and 119 strikeouts in innings.

In the last year of his contract in 1987, Tanana made $662,500. He picked up his 2,000th strikeout July 12 against the Angels, though the milestone came in a 5–4 loss. Through August 6, he had a 3.40 ERA, but he struggled after that, posting a 9.00 ERA in his next eight starts and prompting manager Sparky Anderson to take him out of the rotation in September. However, Tanana only missed one start before rejoining the rotation with the Tigers in the middle of a pennant race. On the final day of the 1987 season, Tanana pitched a 1–0 complete-game shutout over second-place Toronto to clinch the American League East title for the Tigers. As the final out was recorded, a jubilant Anderson rushed to the mound, embracing and kissing his pitcher. &quot;That game was probably the highlight of my career,” Tanana said. He went 15–7 in 34 starts as he helped the Tigers win the division, posting a 3.91 ERA and striking out 146 in innings pitched.

The Tigers faced the Twins in the ALCS; in Game 4, Tanana was matched up against Frank Viola. He allowed six hits over innings, walking four batters and giving up four runs (three earned) in a 4–3 defeat. The Twins won the series in five games.

After the 1987 season, Tanana went to arbitration with the Tigers. Seeking a two-year contract initially, Tanana ultimately received a one-year, $1.1 million deal, $300,000 more than the Tigers had wanted to pay him. Tanana won eight of his first ten decisions in 1988, matching the best start of his career (he also won eight of his first ten decisions in 1977 and 1978). His only two complete games of the year came in back-to-back starts, a win against Texas on July 29 and a loss to Kansas City August 3 when he only went eight innings due to it being a road game. In 32 starts, Tanana had a 14–11 record, a 4.21 ERA, and 127 strikeouts in 203 innings.

On June 9, 1989, Tanana struck out 10 in his first complete game of the year, but the two runs he allowed were the only runs of the game in a loss to Toronto. After Tanana beat the White Sox on August 6, 1989, Anderson praised his pitcher: &quot;Tanana should have at least 15 wins this year. He is pitching the best for me this year since he came over here. He&#x27;s a real pitcher. He knows what he&#x27;s doing even when he makes a mistake.&quot; He struck out 10 in a two-hit shutout of the Orioles on August 16. Tanana&#x27;s 3.58 ERA would be his lowest ever for the Tigers, save for the 20 starts he made for them in 1985. He had a 10–14 record, striking out 147 batters in innings. He became a free agent after the season but re-signed with the club a week later.

Entering his 18th major league season in 1990, Tanana had won 198 games. He gave up five runs in seven innings on April 28, against the Milwaukee Brewers, but still picked up the win, the 200th of his career. The season saw him struggle, though—he had a 6.47 ERA through July 28, prompting the Tigers to re-sign Walt Terrell to replace him in the rotation. It was during this time that Tanana got the only save of his career, inducing Oscar Azócar to hit a foul pop-up and stranding a runner on second in the 14th inning of a 6–5 triumph over the Yankees August 2. He rejoined the rotation August 25 and posted a 2.44 ERA for the remainder of the year. In 34 games (29 starts), he had a 9–8 record, a 5.31 ERA, and 114 strikeouts in innings pitched.

Following Jack Morris&#x27;s departure via free agency in 1991, Tanana became the first pitcher besides him to make an Opening Day start for the Tigers since 1979, also the last year Tanana had made an Opening Day start. He gave up four runs in five innings against the Yankees, leaving with the game tied, but the Tigers beat New York 6–4. He threw a shutout against the White Sox April 18, then threw another shutout against the Angels June 7. Also, June 18, he came within one out of throwing another shutout but left after giving up two straight singles in the ninth; Mike Henneman finished a 2–0 victory over Oakland. On September 27, he became the last player to throw a pitch in the history of Memorial Stadium, allowing one run in a complete game, 7–1 victory over the Orioles. He made 33 starts for the Tigers in 1991, posting a 13–12 record, a 3.77 ERA, and 107 strikeouts in innings pitched.

Tanana posted a 7.07 ERA in his first six starts of the 1992 season, then had a start skipped after May 7. Used in relief May 12, he picked up the win against California, pitching two scoreless innings. He rejoined the rotation after that and posted a 3.96 ERA the rest of the way. There were no shutouts for Tanana in 1992, but he did throw eight scoreless innings for the win in a 6–0 victory over Texas on August 16. In 31 starts, he had a 13–11 record, a 4.39 ERA, and 91 strikeouts in innings pitched. After the 1992 season, he became a free agent.

===New York Mets and New York Yankees===
Tanana signed as a free agent with the New York Mets for the 1993 season. The Mets were interested in him partly as a mentor for left-handed prospect Pete Schourek. Tanana&#x27;s manager with the team, Jeff Torborg, was his catcher in his MLB debut in 1973. He won seven games for the last-place team but lost 15 (tied for 6th in the National League (NL)) before being traded to the New York Yankees for Kenny Greer on September 17, as the Yankees sought pitching help in an attempt to capture the AL East pennant. Tanana lost two of his three starts for the Yankees, and they did not reach the post-season. In his last start of the season (and ultimately, his final major league appearance) on October 1, he held the Tigers to four runs (three earned) over innings and left with the Yankees leading 5–4. Bobby Muñoz blew the lead, costing Tanana the chance for the win, but the Yankees prevailed 9–6. Tanana&#x27;s combined totals for the season were a 7–17 record, a 4.35 ERA, and 116 strikeouts in innings pitched. Following the year, he again became a free agent.

On February 15, 1994, Tanana signed a minor league contract with the Angels, hoping to pitch another year. He competed for a starting spot in their rotation but was released in favor of Mark Leiter after going 0–3 with a 13.50 ERA in spring training, marking the end of his professional career. In 21 seasons in the major leagues, Tanana had a 3.66 lifetime ERA.

==Pitching style==
In his prime, Tanana was known for a hard fastball in the mid-to-upper nineties, to go along with a devastating curveball. Arm injuries in 1977 and 1979 made him realize that he would not be able to stick around the big leagues very long if he kept throwing so hard. As a result, he altered his style, throwing less hard and developing a mixture of off-speed pitches, such as the forkball and the screwball. He mixed his repertoire of off-speed pitches very effectively, using deception rather than speed to get hitters out. &quot;I have to change speeds and try to get ahead of the hitters in any ballpark,&quot; he summarized his style. He and others quipped that he was &quot;the guy who threw 90 in the 70s and 70 in the 90s.&quot; The new style extended his career, and he accumulated 34 shutouts, innings pitched, and 2,773 strikeouts. He is one of only 26 major league pitchers to have struck out at least 2,700 batters in his career.

In a 21-year career, Tanana never had any sort of surgery on his arm. &quot;I had sore arms, of course, that just goes right along with pitching. You&#x27;re going to have sore arms on occasion.&quot; When his arm did get sore, Tanana treated it with physical therapy and strengthening exercises. In a 2019 interview, he speculated that young pitchers were having arm surgery more often because they threw too much when they were young, and they focused too much on baseball when they were young, instead of playing other sports as well during the year.

==Legacy==
As a result of his 21-year career, Tanana is among the career leaders in baseball history in a number of categories. His 240 wins are 58th all-time, and the second-most by a pitcher who never won 20 games in a season (Dennis Martínez won 245). His 236 losses rank 17th all-time, and he holds the AL record for most home runs allowed (422). Tanana&#x27;s innings pitched are the 35th most in baseball history, his 1,704 earned runs allowed are 21st, and his 17,641 batters faced rank 37th.

In 1999, Tanana appeared on the Hall of Fame ballot for the first time but received no votes and thus, he was removed from future Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) consideration for election (though he could still be elected by the Veterans Committee). He has the most career WAR (57.1 according to Baseball Reference) of any player to appear on the BBWAA ballot and not receive any votes. As of 2024, Tanana&#x27;s 2,773 strikeouts rank him at number 26 all-time. Also not in the Hall of Fame are Roger Clemens (#3 with 4,672 strikeouts), Curt Schilling (#17 with 3,116), Lolich (#23 with 2,832), and David Cone (#27 with 2,668).

Tanana is in the top 10 among Angels in several categories. His 102 wins with the team are tied for fifth with John Lackey, his 3.08 ERA ranks fifth, and his 1,233 strikeouts rank fifth in franchise history. His 269 strikeouts in 1975 are still the most by a left-handed pitcher for the Angels. Tanana is one of only two pitchers in MLB history (along with Rick Reuschel) to give up a home run to both Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds, the top two players on MLB&#x27;s all-time home run leaderboard.

==Personal life==
When Tanana first reached the major leagues, he quickly earned a reputation as a partier and drinker. He told reporters his idol was himself, that he was already one of the greatest pitchers of all-time, and that &quot;Nothing I do awes me.&quot; After his injury in 1979, though, Tanana realized his career could be over any day. He also found himself struggling for answers following the 1978 murder of his Angel teammate Lyman Bostock. On November 6, 1983, while at an Arizona hotel room, Tanana became a born again Christian. &quot;I understood that I was dead in my sins,&quot; Tanana said. &quot;I realized I had no chance of having a relationship with my Holy God. But His Son, Jesus, had lived a perfect life and paid the penalty for my sin. If I trusted my life in Him and asked Him for forgiveness and asked Him to come into my life, that I would be a brand new creature. I would be a brand new person. My sins would all be forgiven. On November 6, 1983, I made that commitment of trusting in Jesus. I have walked with Him ever since.&quot;

Since then, Tanana has been a leader in the Christian community within professional baseball. He credits God for the success of his marriage and the longevity of his career. While he was still playing, he joined the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Since retiring, he has ministered to professional athletes in a number of ways. He and his wife, Cathy, serve on the Pro Athletes Outreach Board of Directors. As of 2002, Tanana was assisting Detroit Tiger chaplain Jeff Totten, and he would also participate in Home Plate events, where Tiger players would speak about their faith in Christ at Tiger Stadium before games. Tanana has spoken about his faith at different churches. He has participated in Bible studies and performed marriage counselling since retiring. Says Tanana, &quot;I&#x27;ve been fortunate and blessed the way my life has turned out.&quot;

Tanana met his wife, Cathy Mull, at a Newport Beach disco in 1977, while she was a dance major at Long Beach State University. Five hundred guests showed up at their wedding in 1978. They have four daughters—Lauren, Jill and Kari (twins), and Erin—and several grandchildren. The couple now reside in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and he is an Elder at Highland Park Baptist Church in Southfield. Frank has coached young athletes at Southfield Christian School. In 1996, Tanana was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame, and in 2006, Tanana was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>J. Gordon Edwards (August 24, 1919 – July 19, 2004) was an American entomologist and proponent of the use and safety of the pesticide DDT. He was professor of entomology at San Jose State University for 40 years, and namesake to the university&#x27;s entomology museum. He was an outspoken critic of Rachel Carson and efforts to ban DDT, famously eating the substance to demonstrate its safety to humans. He was also a noted mountain climber, spending nine seasons as a ranger-naturalist in Glacier National Park during the 1940s and &#x27;50s, and returning often to collect insects and map routes. His 1961 book &quot;A Climber&#x27;s Guide to Glacier National Park&quot;, republished several times since, made him known as the &quot;patron saint of climbing&quot; in the park, where he died while hiking, aged 84.

==Early life and education==
J. Gordon Edwards was born on August 24, 1919, in Wilmington, Ohio, to parents Gus and Evadne Edwards (née Spears). He was named after the silent film director J. Gordon Edwards. He grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana, and joined the Boy Scouts at age 12. He studied botany at Butler University, Indiana, graduating in 1942, then enlisted in the United States Army during World War II, serving as a combat medic with the 95th Infantry Division in Europe. He wrote about eradicating bed bugs in the barracks, and dusting personnel with DDT to control body lice and prevent typhus. He was discharged from the military after the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, having spent nearly four years with the army.

His graduate education was at Ohio State University, where he earned his MS degree in 1946 and his PhD in Entomology in 1949. He also worked as an ornithological assistant to Donald J. Borror. At Ohio State he met Alice Althaus and they were married on October 13, 1946.

== Entomology ==
In 1949 Edwards joined the faculty of San Jose State University (then San Jose State College), where he was professor of entomology until his retirement in 1990, after which he continued research and teaching as professor emeritus. He specialized in beetles, and published several articles on the insects of Glacier National Park. He was elected a life fellow of the California Academy of Sciences in 1977, and served as president of the Pacific Coast Entomological Society in 1948 and 1953, elected as honorary member in 1993. During his career he supervised 90 master&#x27;s students in entomology, including scientists such as Terry L. Erwin, who credits Edwards with inspiring his interest in entomology. To students and friends he was widely called &quot;Doc&quot;. In 1991 the university&#x27;s entomology museum was dedicated to him and renamed the J. Gordon Edwards Entomology Museum. He is commemorated in the scientific names of the beetles &quot;Bembidion edwardsi&quot; and &quot;Nebria arkansana edwardsi&quot;. Dr. Michael Ivie, past president of the Entomological Society of America, calls Edwards an &quot;unsung mentor&quot;, writing that despite his influence he is little-known among entomologists beyond his students, a trait Ivie attributes to his teaching at a non-PhD granting university. In 2007 The Coleopterists Society established the annual J. Gordon Edwards Prize for the best published paper based on a Master&#x27;s Thesis dealing with beetles. 

==DDT and environmental issues==
Edwards was a prominent supporter of the use of DDT and critic of Rachel Carson. He claimed that bans of DDT were not based on good science, and accused environmentalists of politicizing issues regarding pesticides. 

He was active as a member of, or consultant for, a wide range of lobby groups opposed to environmental regulation, including the American Council on Science and Health. According to Edwards, he was also active as a member of several environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club (which published one of his books), and the Audubon Society. Edwards was a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences. He published his ideas in &quot;21st Century Science and Technology&quot;, a publication of the Lyndon LaRouche Movement. Edwards last work, titled &quot;DDT: A Case Study in Scientific Fraud&quot; was published in 2004 after his death in the fringe partizan &quot;Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons&quot;, in which he makes the impassioned plea &quot;The ban on DDT, founded on erroneous or fraudulent reports and imposed by one powerful bureaucrat, has caused millions of deaths, while sapping the strength and productivity of countless human beings in underdeveloped countries. It is time for an honest appraisal and for immediate deployment of the best currently available means to control insect-borne diseases. This means DDT.&quot;

In 1971 he gave testimony before the Congressional House Committee on Agriculture which was widely cited and circulated, despite having published no scientific papers on DDT or birds at the time.

In the 1970s Edwards was involved in a libel suit against the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the National Audubon Society. In April 1972, Robert Arbib Jr., the editor of the Society&#x27;s &quot;American Birds&quot; journal, wrote in an editorial that representatives of pesticide industries and &quot;paid &#x27;scientist-spokesmen were misleadingly using data from Christmas Bird Count to claim that bird populations were increasing despite the usage of DDT, and that apparent increases in songbirds were the result of more birdwatchers rather than more birds. Arbib did not name any individuals in his article, but when contacted by the &quot;Times&quot;, said they included Edwards, Thomas H. Jukes, and Robert H. White-Stevens, among others. Edwards, Jukes, and White-Stevens sued the &quot;Times&quot; for libel, and in 1976 were awarded $61,000, a ruling that was overturned the following year by a Federal appeals court citing freedom of the press to report on public figures.

==Mountaineering==
Edwards was a seasonal park ranger-naturalist in Glacier National Park for nine years beginning in 1947, and returned almost every summer in the years afterward for research. He spent much of his free time exploring the rugged terrain of the park, and pioneered many different routes up a variety of its spectacular mountains. In 1961 he produced &quot;A Climber&#x27;s Guide to Glacier National Park&quot;, published by the Sierra Club, which quickly became a classic work, the definitive mountain guide to the park. I The book was revised and reprinted in the 1970s, 1990s, and as recently as 2017. In the foreword to its 1995 edition, Rolf Larson gave him the unofficial title of &quot;patron saint of climbing&quot; in the park. Ansel Adams personally gave Edwards permission to use his iconic photographs in the book. Edwards was also a founding member of the Glacier Mountaineering Society, a group that publishes an annual climbing journal and continues to be active in organizing hikes and climbs throughout the park.

On July 19, 2004, Edwards died of a heart attack at the age of 84 while hiking up Divide Mountain on the eastern edge of Glacier National Park with his wife, Alice. A memorial issue of the Glacier Park Foundation&#x27;s newsletter called him &quot;a legendary mountaineer and one of the most distinguished and famous figures in Glacier&#x27;s history&quot;. He had a daughter, Jane who died in 2005, followed by his wife in 2015.

<text>Adalberto Luis Brandoni (born 18 April 1940) is an Argentine actor and politician.

==Biography==

Brandoni was born in Dock Sud, a port community east of Avellaneda. He debuted on the stage in 1962, television in 1963, and on film in 1966. He joined the National Comedy Theater in 1964 under the direction of Luisa Vehil.

Politically active in the centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR) party, he also served as cultural policy adviser for President Raúl Alfonsín (1983–89), and was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 1993, where he served until 2001. He was an unsuccessful Argentine Senate candidate for the UCR in 2005, and for Vice Governor of Buenos Aires Province, with nominee Ricardo Alfonsín, in 2007.

An actor with extensive film, television and theatre credits, he portrayed leading roles in acclaimed pictures such as &quot;La tregua&quot; (1974), &quot;Juan que reía&quot; (1976), &quot;Darse cuenta&quot; (1984), &quot;Esperando la carroza&quot; (1985), &quot;Made in Argentina&quot; (1986), &quot;Cien veces no debo&quot; (1990), &quot;Convivencia&quot; (1993), &quot;Una sombra ya pronto serás&quot; (1994), &quot;De mi barrio con amor&quot; (1995), and &quot;Los pasos perdidos&quot; (2001).

His career remained strong during 2011: among his notable theatre credits was his portrayal of former President Arturo Illia; and his notable television credits included a costarring role in Telefé&#x27;s sitcom &quot;El hombre de tu vida&quot;, together with Guillermo Francella and directed by Juan José Campanella. He also starred in Gastón Duprat &amp; Mariano Cohn&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Mi obra maestra&quot; (2018), together again with Guillermo Francella. He is currently set to star in the Star+ TV series &quot;Nada&quot;, which will be released in 2023. Cohn &amp; Duprat wrote and directed the series, which features a supporting cast that includes Robert De Niro.

Brandoni also served in numerous actors&#x27; guilds, including the International Federation of Actors (IFA) as its Vice President, between 1974 and 2004.

== Awards ==
Brandoni has won several awards, including four Martín Fierro Awards (1970, 1993, 1995 and 2017); and two Argentine Film Critics Association Silver Condor awards for Best Actor for his roles in &quot;Seré cualquier cosa pero te quiero&quot; and &quot;Convivencia&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Brandoni was married to actress Marta Bianchi, and in 2007 married Mónica López.

== Controversies ==
In July 2017, the Argentine Association of Actors issued a harsh statement criticizing Brandoni for some statements made at the time on the television program Intratables, where he described as &quot;verse&quot; (meaning &quot;false&quot;) the current denomination of &quot;civil-military&quot; regarding Argentina&#x27;s last dictatorship, while denying there was any important civilian participation or decision-making in the military government of the dictatorship.

<doc id="882034" wikidata="Q6122874" url="?curid=882034" title="Jaguar AJ6 engine">
<text>The AJ6 (&quot;Advanced Jaguar 6-cylinder&quot;), and the similar AJ16, are inline-6 piston engines used by Jaguar cars in the 1980s and 1990s. The AJ6 was designed to replace the successful and long-used Jaguar XK6 engine, and was introduced in 1984. It was only the third all-new engine ever designed by the company. The AJ16 evolution was replaced in 1996 with the Jaguar developed AJ-V8 engine.

Jaguar had considered cutting their existing V12 in half to build a V6, or possibly a V8, but chose instead to develop a new inline six. The cylinders are inclined, as in a slant-6, by 22 degrees. It uses an aluminium block to reduce weight, and has an optional DOHC head for higher efficiency and power.

==AJ6==
The original engines were the DOHC 3.6 and the SOHC 2.9. The DOHC 3.6 was revised and enlarged to 4.0 in 1990. It is still essentially an &quot;AJ6&quot;, however. This was, as per usual, offered for the XJ-S before it was built into the XJ40 saloon.

===3.6===
The was the first AJ6 engine, debuting in 1983 on the XJ-S. It had DOHC 4-valve heads with a bore and stroke. Power was with of torque. Power was reduced to for versions having catalytic exhaust system. Early versions of the AJ6 as used in the 1984 - 1987 XJ-S cars had a conventional distributor type of ignition system with electronics within the distributor body. This early AJ6 ignition system is nearly identical to the system used on the XK engine in the Series III XJ6 cars. The Lucas fuel injection system on the AJ6 engines in these early XJ-S cars sensed engine load using a Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor just like the V12 cars from the same era. Later AJ6 engines as used in the 1986–1989 XJ40 cars had a crank-sensor type of ignition system with a bare distributor that only carried the spinning ignition rotor inside the distributor cap. The fuel-injection system used on the later AJ6 engines used a hot-wire Mass Air Flow sensor to determine engine load. 

Vehicles using the 3.6 were:
* 1984–1989 Jaguar XJ-S
* 1986–1989 Jaguar XJ6
* 1986–1989 Jaguar XJ6 Sovereign
* 1986–1989 Daimler

===2.9===

The used a SOHC head from the Jaguar V12 engine, and was prone to failure. The block is the same as the 3.6, with the crankshaft and pistons lowering the stroke to . Only the 1986–1989 Jaguar XJ6 used the 2.9. It was used for the entry-level XJ6 in Britain and Europe but rarely, if ever, seen in models exported to the US. The SOHC 2.9, which was generally considered somewhat underpowered for such a large car, was discontinued in late 1990 and replaced with a DOHC 3.2 (essentially identical to the DOHC 4.0).

The 2.9 Engine was, as in earlier years the 2.8 XK-engine, sized to match road-tax regulations in some European Countries like Italy or France. In France cars with more than 3 litres of engine size had to pay a luxury tax.

Unlike all other AJ6&#x27;s, the 2.9l used Bosch LH Jetronic fuel injection and EZ-K ignition (rather than Lucas 9 or 15CU EMS)

===4.0 (1989–1994)===

The 24-valve DOHC version replaced the AJ6 in 1989. It featured a longer stroke, and generated power at 4,750 rpm and of torque at 3,650 rpm. The engines as used in the 1990–1994 XJ40 cars continued with the crank sensor and empty distributor type of ignition system and the hot-wire Mass Air Flow sensor type of fuel injection control system as the 1988–1989 XJ40 cars.

TWR modified XJ40s resulting in the XJR. Jaguarsport was also formed as a partnership between TWR and Jaguar. The first XJR, the XJR , had extensive appearance changes coupled with stiffer suspension, anti-roll bar/links, power steering valve that reduced efficiency by 40% and an LSD but no performance enhancements. Interior-wise it included special stitching, &quot;sport&quot; or &quot;XJR&quot; embossed front headrests, and Jaguarsport speedometer labels and tread-plates.

1990 XJRs had the upgraded 3L engine with the old style body-kits, and appearance changers.

XJR 1.0Ls from 1990 on had all of the XJR 3.6 handling upgrades and benefits from engine enhancements such as high lift cams, improved double plenum inlet manifold, and a compression ratio of 9.75:1. They were sent to TWR in Coventry to be modified directly after being produced.

The exterior changed again for the last generation of the XJ40 XJR (from H-registration year onwards). Bodykit was re-sculptured and the boot spoiler was deleted. Side mouldings were added, with the smaller &quot;XJR&quot; badge embedded in them. Engine had a plaque saying &quot;Jaguarsport XJR 4L&quot; on the rocker cover. XJR badge size was decreased on the boot (had previously ranged from XJR-3.6, XJR-4L, 4-litre and &quot;XJR&quot;. The later one (&quot;XJR&quot;) is most common and the only badge that could be chosen on the boot infill panel models. A &quot;sport&quot; one on the front within its own unique XJR grill. In this unique grill a &quot;sport&quot; badge was installed. Interior even had XJR specific wood (SPB part number).

Total XJ40 cars built was 208,733 and supposedly 500 JaguarSport cars built, 200 of the round headlight versions and then about 300 with the square headlights like the Sovereigns and Daimler&#x27;s. 1990+ XJR power output is around / .

The prototype Jaguar XJ41/42 sports car used a twin-turbo version of the AJ6 4.0, developing 330bhp.

===3.2 (1990–1994)===

A 24-valve DOHC , essentially a shorter-stroke of , replaced the 12-valve SOHC 2.9 in 1990. It produced of power at 5,250 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm, and proved a popular engine in Europe (sales outnumbered saloons roughly 4:1) but was not exported to America.

Following the launch of the Aston Martin DB7, the Jaguar AJ6 was used by Aston Martin as well (both companies being owned by Ford at the time). This version featured an Eaton supercharger.

Cars using the 4.0 and 3.2 included:
* Jaguar XJS (4.0 only)
* Aston Martin DB7 (modified, supercharged 3.2)
* Jaguar XJ6
* Jaguar Sovereign
* Jaguar XJR (4.0 only)
* Daimler Six

==AJ16==
Both the 3.2 and 4.0 were substantially revised for the 1995 launch of the renewed Jaguar XJ (X300) saloon. These are the &quot;AJ16&quot; engines, both featuring coil-on-plug distributorless ignition, new engine management systems, magnesium alloy valve covers, revised pistons and other detail changes. The AJ16 was discontinued with the launch of the AJ-V8 (XK8 and XJ8 in 1996/7).

===4.0 / 3.2 (1994–1997)===

For the launch of the new X300 saloon for 1995, substantial revisions were made to the and AJ6 engines. The new design was called the AJ16 to reflect the major differences between it and the original AJ6.

Cars using the 4.0 and 3.2 included:
* Jaguar XJS (4.0 only)
* Jaguar XJ6
* Jaguar XJ6 Sovereign
* Jaguar XJ6 Sport
* Daimler

===AJ16S===

A supercharged version of the AJ16 was released in 1994 in the Jaguar XJR which used an Eaton M90 blower to boost output to and

<text>Patricio Contreras (born December 15, 1947) is a Chilean-Argentine television, film and stage actor.

==Biography==
Contreras was born in Santiago, Chile in 1947 and emigrated to neighboring Argentina following the 1973 coup d&#x27;état against left-wing President Salvador Allende, of whom Contreras was a vocal supporter. He was shortly afterwards cast in a number of minor Argentine cinema roles, notable among them a part in Adolfo Aristarain&#x27;s 1978 crime thriller, &quot;La parte del león&quot; (&quot;The Lion&#x27;s Share&quot;).

He married an up-and-coming Argentine actress, Leonor Manso, in 1981, and in 1983, he was given his first significant film role as the treacherous Sergeant Comini in Aristarain&#x27;s &quot;Funny Dirty Little War&quot;. Contreras then gave what became perhaps his best-known performance as the targeted Professor Benítez in the Oscar-winning &quot;The Official Story&quot; (1985), for which he was awarded a Silver Condor. This was followed a leading role in Juan José Jusid&#x27;s emotional look at exile, &quot;Made in Argentina&quot; (1986), which earned Contreras a Havana Film Festival Best Actor Award.

He appeared next to Gregory Peck and Jane Fonda in the 1989 movie &quot;Old Gringo&quot;.
He starred in fellow Chilean exile Miguel Littín&#x27;s &quot;Sandino&quot; (1990), and the end of General Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s dictatorship in 1990 allowed Contreras to return to Chile itself, where he starred as the lead in Ricardo Larraín&#x27;s &quot;La Frontera&quot; (1991). Continuing to live and work in Argentina, he starred in Betty Kaplan&#x27;s adaptation of Chilean writer Isabel Allende&#x27;s &quot;Of Love and Shadows&quot; (1995), and to his film credits were added those in the local theatre, notably his work in a local, 1996-98 production of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (directed by his wife). His marriage suffered, however, and the couple were divorced in 2001. Among Contreras&#x27; later film roles some of the best-known are as writer Rodolfo Walsh&#x27;s version of Hercule Poirot in Santiago Carlos Oves&#x27; &quot;Asesinato a Distancia&quot; (&quot;Murder at a Distance&quot;, 1998), and as the merciless detective in Eduardo Mignogna&#x27;s fact-based &quot;La fuga&quot; (&quot;The Escape&quot;, 2001). He was reunited with his ex-wife for the stage in 2007 in her production of Sarah Kane&#x27;s &quot;Blasted&quot;.

Contreras continues to live in Buenos Aires and remains a prolific film and stage actor.

<doc id="882045" wikidata="Q5072040" url="?curid=882045" title="Transgender rights in Canada">
<text>Transgender rights in Canada, including procedures for changing legal gender and protections from discrimination, vary among provinces and territories, due to Canada&#x27;s nature as a federal state. According to the 2021 Canadian census, 59,460 Canadians identify as transgender. Canada was ranked third in Asher &amp; Lyric&#x27;s Global Trans Rights Index in 2023.

==Government identity documents==

There are two main routes to changing one&#x27;s legal gender in Canada: the Immigration (or &#x27;federal&#x27;) route, and the Vital Statistics (or &#x27;provincial/territorial&#x27; route). Of note is the distinction between &#x27;legal gender&#x27; and &#x27;gender marker&#x27;; a legal gender (also commonly referred to as a sex designation; sex indicator in Nova Scotia) is what appears on foundational identity documents such as immigration status documents and birth certificates, whilst a gender marker can appear on a non-foundational identity document, such as a driver&#x27;s licence or photo card. A gender marker usually follows legal gender, but can differ - and a change in gender marker on a non-foundational identity document alone does not provide a trans individual with foundational identity documentation that establishes such a change.

Three provinces (British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan) and all three territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon) do not offer anyone not born within the respective province/territory the ability to change their legal gender. However, this is currently pending an amendment in the NWT Vital Statistics Act.

=== Table overview ===

=== Federal ===
Canadian Permanent Residents, Citizens (born inside or outside Canada), Protected Persons, Refugee Claimants and Temporary Residents may apply to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada using form CIT 0404: Request for a Change of Sex or Gender Identifier. Amendment of documents issued by the person&#x27;s country of birth, former habitual residence, or nationality is not required. Once the person&#x27;s gender is changed with IRCC, the agency will issue a Verification of Status annotated with the person&#x27;s change of name (if any) and gender, as a linking document between their Canadian identity and their foreign birth certificate. Since June 2019, the Canadian passport, citizenship certificate, permanent resident documentation and protected person documentation have offered an &quot;X&quot; option for legal gender.

In July 2020, Global News reported that the policy of not allowing refugee claimants and temporary residents to change their legal gender was causing harm, especially to asylum seekers. The article cites the case of Naomi Chen (a pseudonym), a trans woman who was born in Hong Kong and holds Chinese nationality and Hong Kong permanent resident status. Chen&#x27;s HKSAR passport still states her gender as &#x27;male&#x27;, and consequently she was issued a Refugee Protection Claimant Document by IRCC bearing that gender.

Chen was not able to change her legal gender in Hong Kong, fearing that her marriage, which was solemnized in Hong Kong, would be terminated (Hong Kong does not allow same-sex marriage). She says she is now afraid of interacting with the community, given the incorrect gender designation on her documents. In response, Kevin Lemkay, spokesperson for federal immigration minister Marco Mendicino, said that &#x27;reviewing gender identity requirements for government-issued documents [was] a priority&#x27;. Will Tao, a Vancouver immigration lawyer, noted that the restriction was a matter of policy and not law. He contended that the Canadian federal government was potentially committing a violation of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in Tao&#x27;s own words an issue &quot;ripe for future litigation&quot;.

As of November 2020, refugee claimants are now able to amend the sex indicator printed on their Refugee Protection Claimant Document. As of March 2021, the same is also now available to temporary residents without the amendment of gender on their country of nationality&#x27;s passport. Applicants may also elect to amend their legal gender through a provincial process instead, if this is available to them in their province or territory of residence.

===Alberta===
Following a 2014 court ruling that struck down the existing legislation and its surgery requirements as unconstitutional, the government of Alberta modified the &quot;Vital Statistics Information Regulation&quot; in 2015. The current regulations eliminate the surgical requirement. Instead, the applicant must submit a &quot;statement confirming that the person identifies with and is maintaining the gender identity that corresponds with the requested amendment to the sex on the record of birth,&quot; as well as a letter from a physician or psychologist attesting that the amendment is appropriate. Legal change of gender is accessible to minors; this requires the parents&#x27; or guardians&#x27; consent, although this can be waived by court order or if the minor is emancipated, married, or a parent.

A legal change of gender through the province is not currently accessible to residents who were not born in Alberta.

===British Columbia===
In British Columbia, the requirement for surgery to change the birth certificate gender marker was removed in 2014. A legal change of gender is not accessible to residents who were not born in British Columbia. Non-binary B.C. resident Kori Doty, along with seven other trans and intersex persons, filed a human rights complaint against the province, alleging that publishing a sex indicator on birth certificates was discriminatory. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal agreed in 2015 to hear their complaint. In April 2017, Doty&#x27;s child, Searyl Atli Doty, became the first in the world to be issued a health card with a &quot;U&quot; gender marker (for &#x27;unspecified&#x27;), but the province has refused to issue a birth certificate without specifying a gender. Doty has filed a legal challenge. In 2022, British Columbia allowed people to change their gender designation on the province&#x27;s main government-issued ID (BC Services Card, B.C. driver’s licence, BCID card and B.C. birth certificate) without the confirmation of a medical professional.

===Manitoba===
A change of legal gender in Manitoba is available to persons born there. As of the 1st February 2015, there exists no requirement for trans individuals to have undergone gender confirmation surgery. Section 25(3) of the Vital Statistics Act of Manitoba further provides that &quot;a person may apply to the director for a change of sex designation certificate if the person is a Canadian citizen who has been a resident of Manitoba for at least one year before the date the application is submitted.&quot; This follows the model formerly adopted by Québec (now invalidated by the Superior Court in that province), but is discrepant with Manitoba&#x27;s own policy for legal changes of name (three months&#x27; ordinary residence). As of July 2020, this provision has been implemented by the Manitoba Vital Statistics Agency.

As of October 13, 2020, the gender marker on Manitoba driver licenses and photo cards can either be unspecified or marked with an &#x27;X&#x27;. This is in response to a complaint lodged at the Manitoba Human Rights Commission by non-binary individuals.

A legal change of gender through the province is not current accessible to residents who were not in Manitoba nor a Canadian citizen.

===New Brunswick===

In April 2017, a bill passed the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick to add gender identity or expression to the human rights laws and to allow gender changes without the required surgery. A person born in New Brunswick or ordinarily resident there for at least three months may make application to Service New Brunswick for a change of their legal gender.

===Newfoundland and Labrador===
Persons born in Newfoundland and Labrador have been able to have the sex indicator on their birth registration changed since the adoption of a new Vital Statistics Act in 2009. Initially, that provision was available only to those who had undergone gender confirmation surgery, but such requirement was removed following the December 2015 decision of a Newfoundland and Labrador Human Rights Board of Inquiry on complaints filed with the Human Rights Commission from two trans women. The amendment received Royal Assent on April 13, 2016.

The first gender-neutral birth certificate in Newfoundland and Labrador, and possibly the first in Canada, was issued December 14, 2017, to Gemma Hickey, a non-binary resident of St. John&#x27;s, the province&#x27;s capital. Hickey, an award-winning activist, had launched court action seeking to compel the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador to issue the gender-neutral certificate after their application for such a document was rejected because the application form was limited to male or female designation only. Hickey withdrew the court action after the government agreed to amend the Vital Statistics Act to authorize the issuing of gender-neutral birth certificates. That amendment received Royal Assent on December 7, 2017.

On June 1, 2021, a bill to amend the Vital Statistics Act to provide for the issuance of certificates of change of sex designation to people born outside Newfoundland and Labrador who have been living in the province for three months was tabled. On June 17, the bill passed Second Reading and the Committee of the Whole stage, and Third Reading on June 22. On June 23, Royal Assent was given. Therefore, Newfoundland and Labrador now permits a provincial change of legal gender for all residents, regardless of citizenship or immigration status, or birthplace.

===Northwest Territories===
The Northwest Territories government removed the surgery requirement for a legal gender change from the Vital Statistics Act in June 2016.

A territorial legal change of gender is not accessible to residents who were not born in NWT. As of May 2023, however, the territorial government has indicated that it would like to provide for the issuance of change of gender certificates to such residents. This was one of the proposed amendments outlined in the GNWT report &quot;What We Heard: Vital Statistics Act and Change of Name Act - Proposed Key Elements - Amendments.&quot; The intent is to bring a bill of amendments forth, sometime during the 2023-2027 sitting of the Legislative Assembly.

=== Nova Scotia ===

On May 11, 2015, Bill 82, &quot;An Act to Amend Chapter 66 of the Revised Statutes, 1989, the Change of Name Act, and Chapter 494 of the Revised Statutes, 1989, the Vital Statistics Act&quot; received Royal Assent. This act abolishes the surgical requirement, instead requiring a statement &quot;that the applicant has assumed, identifies with and intends to maintain the gender identity that corresponds with the change requested,&quot; and an attestation from a professional that the applicant&#x27;s gender identity does not correspond to that listed on the birth certificate. The Act came into force the week of September 24, 2015.

Therefore, a change of sex indicator is now available in Nova Scotia for persons born there or those who have been ordinarily resident at least three months in the province. Nova Scotia also offers the option of no gender being displayed on one&#x27;s driver&#x27;s licence and/or identification card.

===Nunavut===
Nunavut removed the surgery requirement for a legal gender change from the Vital Statistics Act in March 2015.

A territorial legal change of gender is not accessible to residents who were not born in Nunavut.

===Ontario===
On 11 April 2012, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario ruled that gender confirmation surgery is no longer required for a change in registered gender on Ontario documents. In its decision, the Tribunal ordered that the Ontario government &quot;shall cease requiring transgender persons to have &#x27;transsexual surgery&#x27; in order to obtain a change in sex designation on their registration of birth&quot; and has 180 days to &quot;revise the criteria for changing sex designation on a birth registration&quot;. However, some medical certification is still required. It is also not accessible to residents who were not born in Ontario.

In July 2021, an Ontario resident who was born abroad tried to obtain photo identification from ServiceOntario, only to be rejected as she could not obtain an amended birth certificate from her country of birth, nor an Ontario birth certificate. The alternative mentioned in the article was medical certification with prohibitive requirements. (However, the federal government does offer another alternative without medical gatekeeping requirements, as described in the Federal section of this article).

=== Prince Edward Island ===
In April 2016, the Prince Edward Island government amended the Vital Statistics Act to allow individuals to change their legal gender on ID without surgery. Individuals must present a letter from a doctor attesting to the applicant&#x27;s gender identity. Islanders can also now choose to display no gender on their PEI-issued driver&#x27;s licence/voluntary identification card.

A provincial change of legal gender remains inaccessible for PEI residents born off-Island.

=== Quebec ===

Since October 2015, adults have been able to change their legal gender on birth certificates in Quebec. The process was simplified for minors in June 2016.

To qualify to change legal gender, the person concerned by the application must be domiciled in Quebec for at least one year. If the person concerned by the application was born in Quebec but lives elsewhere, the person may also qualify to change the sex designation if the person shows that such an amendment is not possible in the province or country in which the person is domiciled. They may make application to the Directeur de l&#x27;etat civil for a Certificate of Change of Mention of Sex (&quot;certificat de changement de la mention du sexe&quot;), regardless of their place of birth; however, this is solely limited to a male or female &quot;sex designation&quot;, forbidding the use of a non-binary gender designator. They may also apply for a combination Certificate of Change of Mention of Sex and Name (&quot;certificat de changement de la mention du sexe et de nom&quot;). After such a certificate is issued, one&#x27;s gender may be amended on a Quebec birth certificate. If one was born outside Quebec, the birth certificate will be designated a semi-authentic act pursuant to Article 137 of the Civil Code.

Previously, Quebec required applicants to be Canadian citizens. A 2021 court ruling, &quot;Centre for Gender Advocacy et al. v. Attorney General of Quebec&quot;, has struck down six legal provisions considered discriminatory towards trans and non-binary Quebecois, including one forbidding the use of non-binary gender designations, and another one prohibiting non-citizens to obtain a change of name and sex designation. The Quebec government has until the end of 2021 to amend these aforementioned legal provisions, except for the discriminatory citizenship requirement, which the Court declared invalid with immediate effect. The citizenship requirement has been removed in practice by the Directeur on application forms.

In October 2021, Quebec Minister of Justice Simon Jolin-Barrette introduced Bill 2, which among other things would partially reverse Quebec&#x27;s policy on birth certificate changes, creating a second category called &quot;gender identity&quot; on the certificate and allowing trans people to only change that while keeping the &quot;sex&quot; category fixed unless said trans people underwent a sex change. Bill 2 was quickly denounced by various civil society groups, and in November 2021, the Office of the Minister of Justice stated in an e-mail to &quot;MTLBlog&quot; that &quot;[they were confirming] that the requirement for an operation to change the sex designation [would] be removed from the bill.&quot;

===Saskatchewan===
In February 2016, the provincial government changed the Saskatchewan Vital Statistics Act to eliminate gender confirmation surgery as a prerequisite for changing government documents. In May 2018, a judge ruled that the gender marker can be removed from a birth certificate.

Saskatchewan permits the change of sex designation on a Saskatchewan driver’s licence or photo identification card to all residents. However, a provincial change of legal gender remains inaccessible for Saskatchewan residents born outside the province.

===Yukon===
On April 25, 2017, a bill called Act to Amend the Human Rights Act and the Vital Statistics Act (2017) was introduced to the Second Session of the 34th Legislative Assembly as Bill 5. Its intended purpose was to add &quot;gender identity or expression&quot; to the Human Rights Act, and to allow the recognition of gender without surgery being required under the Vital Statistics Act. On July 1, 2017, it went into effect.

A person may amend the gender designation on their driver’s licence and/or general identification card by presentation of a Change of Gender Designation form.

A territorial change of legal gender remains inaccessible for Yukon residents born outside the territory.

==Discrimination protections==

=== Bill C-16 ===
Bill C-16, which passed in June 2017, added the words &quot;gender identity and expression&quot; in three instances. These words were added to the Canadian Human Rights Act as prohibited grounds for discrimination, and to the Criminal Code in two sections, the first dealing with hate speech and hate incitement and the second regarding sentencing for hate crimes.

In 2005, NDP MP Bill Siksay introduced a bill in the House of Commons to explicitly add &quot;gender identity and expression&quot; as prohibited grounds of discrimination in the &quot;Canadian Human Rights Act&quot;. He reintroduced the bill in 2006. In May 2009, he introduced it again, with additional provisions to add gender identity and expression to the hate crimes provisions of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. In February 2011, it passed third reading in the House of Commons with support from all parties, but was not considered in the Senate before Parliament was dissolved for the 41st Canadian federal election. Two bills—C-276 and C-279—on the subject have been introduced in the 41st Canadian Parliament, by the Liberals and the NDP respectively. The NDP&#x27;s Bill C-279 passed second reading on June 6, 2012. However, the bill again died on the Senate order paper when the 2015 federal election was called. In May 2016, An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (C-16) was introduced to the House of Commons of Canada, to add and include &quot;gender identity or expression&quot; in the &quot;Canadian Human Rights Act.&quot; In June 2017, the Parliament of Canada passed bill C-16 and received royal assent a week later. The law went into effect immediately as Bill C-16.

===Enforcement mechanism===
The federal government and every province and territory in Canada has enacted human rights acts that prohibit discrimination and harassment on several grounds (e.g. race, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, sex, religion) in private and public sector employment, housing, public services and publicity. Some acts also apply to additional activities. These acts are quasi-constitutional laws that override ordinary laws as well as regulations, contracts and collective agreements. They are typically enforced by human rights commissions and tribunals through a complaint investigation, conciliation and arbitration process that is slow, but free, and includes protection against retaliation. A lawyer is not required.

===Grounds for prohibiting discrimination===
In 1977, the Québec Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is both a charter of rights and a human rights act, was amended to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Thus, the province of Québec became the first jurisdiction in the world larger than a city or county to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in the private and public sectors. Today, sexual orientation is explicitly mentioned as a ground of prohibited discrimination in the human rights acts of all jurisdictions in Canada. In 2016, gender identity or expression was added to the Québec Charter.

Sexual orientation is not defined in any human rights act, but is widely interpreted as meaning heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality. It does not include transsexuality or transgender people. The Federal Court of Canada has stated that sexual orientation &quot;is a precise legal concept that deals specifically with an individual&#x27;s preference in terms of gender&quot; in sexual relationships, and is not vague or overly broad. The Ontario Human Rights Commission has adopted the following definition:
Sexual orientation is more than simply a &#x27;status&#x27; that an individual possesses; it is an immutable personal characteristic that forms part of an individual&#x27;s core identity. Sexual orientation encompasses the range of human sexuality from gay and lesbian to bisexual and heterosexual orientations.

All human rights laws in Canada also explicitly prohibit discrimination based on disability, which has been interpreted to include AIDS, ARC and being HIV positive, and membership in a high-risk group for HIV infection.

Since June 2017, all places within Canada explicitly within the Canadian Human Rights Act, equal opportunity and/or anti-discrimination legislation prohibit discrimination against gender identity or gender identity or expression.

In addition, human rights commissions consider that sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity at the federal level and in New Brunswick.

The Ontario Human Rights Commission defines gender identity as follows:
Gender identity is linked to an individual&#x27;s intrinsic sense of self and, particularly the sense of being male or female. Gender identity may or may not conform to a person&#x27;s birth assigned sex. The personal characteristics that are associated with gender identity include self-image, physical and biological appearance, expression, behaviour and conduct, as they relate to gender. … Individuals whose birth-assigned sex does not conform to their gender identity include transsexuals [sic], transgenderists [sic], intersexed [sic] persons and cross-dressers. A person&#x27;s gender identity is fundamentally different from and not determinative of their sexual orientation.

===LGBT discrimination protections table===
===Activities where equality is guaranteed===
Discrimination, including harassment, based on real or perceived sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS and gender identity is prohibited throughout Canada in private and public sector employment, housing and services provided to the public. All aspects of employment are covered, including benefits for spouses and long-term partners. Examples of services include credit, insurance, government programs and schools open to the public. Schools open to the public are liable for anti-gay name-calling and bullying by students or staff.

Prohibited discrimination occurs not only when someone is treated less favourably or is harassed based on a prohibited ground, but also when a policy or practice has an unintended disproportionately adverse effect based on that ground. This is called &quot;adverse effect discrimination&quot;. For example, it might in theory be discriminatory for schools to implement a uniform policy that has specifically gendered uniforms.

=== Trans inclusion in the Canadian Forces ===
LGBT Canadians have been allowed to serve in the military since the &quot;Douglas&quot; case was settled in 1992. However, in March 2019 The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) issued revised policies with a mandate of inclusion of gender diverse Canadians. The new directive stresses ones right to freely express their gender identity and outlines uniform and naming protocols, medical and surgical support opportunities and accommodations to privacy.

=== Trans considerations in federal prison ===
In 2018 new operations were implemented to accommodate offenders based on gender identity instead of sex assigned at birth. These policy amendments are a result of The Canadian Human Rights Commission, The Correctional Service of Canada and Prisoners Legal Services combined efforts. They include changes such as using an offenders preferred name and pronouns, placing offenders in a men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s institutions based on gender identity regardless of anatomy and ensuring the privacy, dignity and safety of trans or gender-diverse offenders.

==Coverage for transition-related surgeries==
Canada&#x27;s system of universal healthcare is delivered through provincial healthcare systems, which vary in terms of their benefits and features, including in the area of transgender health care. As of 2020, all provinces provided coverage for sex reassignment surgery such as vaginoplasty, orchiectomy, or phalloplasty. New Brunswick was the last province to begin insuring such procedures in 2016. Insurance coverage is not generally provided for the transition-related procedures of facial feminization surgery, tracheal shave, or laser hair removal.
Reproductive services are also not covered for trans people, with the costs being quite high. For example Rainbow Health Ontario, an LGBTQ+ healthcare organization, estimates that freezing sperm typically costs $125 to $300, with an additional $200 for each year of storage. They also estimate that preserving embryos costs between $480 to $650, with $150 to $300 in storage fees.

The first transgender healthcare clinic in Canada opened at the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto in 1969. In 1970, Canadian transgender women Dianna Boileau underwent surgery at Toronto General Hospital to have her remaining male genitals removed and female genitals constructed. It was the first time such a surgery had been covered by the Ontario Health Insurance Plan. It was also the first widely publicized sex reassignment surgery in Canada. The first transgender healthcare clinic to offer genital surgery was the Centre Métropolitain de Chirurgie Plastique in Montreal, which opened in 1973. It was also the only Canadian clinic that performed vaginoplasties, the surgical construction of a vagina, on transgender women for 45 years. Transgender surgical clinics opened at Women&#x27;s College Hospital in Toronto in 2017, and at Vancouver General Hospital in 2019.

===Ontario===
The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) began covering sex reassignment surgery in 1970. The first person to have such a surgery under OHIP was Dianna Boileau. It was removed from the list of covered procedures in October 1998 under Mike Harris&#x27; Progressive Conservative government, apparently as a cost-saving measure, sparking an outcry from the transgender community. Some surgeries began to be covered again in 2008.

Until 2016, only a single clinic, the Gender Identity Clinic at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, was able to provide referrals for OHIP-reimbursed surgeries. Ontario saw a large rise in patients seeking SRS after 2008, and by 2015, the CAMH gender clinic had a waitlist of 1,150. That year, Ontario health minister Eric Hoskins announced plans to allow referrals from any qualified healthcare provider. The changes went into effect in 2016.

=== Newfoundland and Labrador ===
Similar to Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s Medical Care Plan (MCP) formerly required surgical assessments from CAMH as a prerequisite for covering SRS procedures. This was subject to outcry from the province&#x27;s trans community, including in one case a complaint filed with the Newfoundland Human Rights Commission. It was the last province to require such an assessment.

In 2019, a new policy on Transition-Related Surgeries went into effect, removing the CAMH assessment requirement. However, other barriers still exist for Newfoundlanders and Labradoreans accessing SRS procedures; some procedures are not covered at all, and since all surgeries are performed outside the province, costs relating to travel and accommodations must be paid upfront. MTAP (the Medical Transportation Assistance Program) does provide some subsidies for these non-surgical costs, but only partially.

=== Yukon ===
On March 12, 2021, the Yukon government made changes to Transition-Related Surgeries policy that would by April provide a nationally unmatched coverage - e.g. for facial feminization surgery and voice training, which are not usually covered by provincial/territorial medical care plans. The government also stated its intent to align with best practices identified by World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) guidelines.

==Blood donation==
On August 15, 2016, Canadian Blood Services established new eligibility criteria for transgender people. These criteria stated that transgender donors who had not had lower gender affirming surgery would be asked questions based on their sex assigned at birth. They would be eligible to donate or be deferred based on these criteria. For example, trans women would be asked if they have had sex with a man in the last 12 months. If the response is yes, they would be deferred for one year after their last sexual contact with a man. Donors who have had lower gender affirming surgery would be deferred from donating blood for one year after their surgery. After that year, these donors will be screened in their affirmed gender. This means that trans women who have not had gender affirming surgery and have sex with men would be deferred for three months following last sexual contact before being eligible, similarly to men who have sex with men. This distinction between operative and non-operative trans women was deemed transphobic by some trans rights activists in different provinces.

On September 11, 2022, new sexual behaviour-based screening was implemented for all donors, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. The new screening procedure requires a deferral for anyone who has had new or multiple sexual partners in the last three months, and has had anal sex in that period.

== Healthcare access ==
According to the Canadian Pediatric Society, &quot;Current evidence shows puberty blockers to be safe when used appropriately, and they remain an option to be considered within a wider view of the patient&#x27;s mental and psychosocial health.&quot;

A study of transgender Ontario residents aged 16 and over, published in 2016, found that half of them were reluctant to discuss transgender issues with their family doctor. A 2013–2014 nationwide study of young transgender and genderqueer Canadians found that a third of younger (ages 14–18) and half of the older (ages 19–25) respondents missed needed physical health care. Only 15 percent of respondents with a family doctor felt very comfortable discussing transgender issues with them.

All Canadian provinces fund some sex reassignment surgeries Waiting times for surgeries can be lengthy, as few surgeons in the country provide them; a clinic in Montreal is the only one providing a full range of procedures. Insurance coverage is not generally provided for the transition-related procedures of facial feminization surgery, tracheal shave, or laser hair removal. And in January 2024, The Alberta government of Danielle Smith announced plans to ban gender affirming surgeries for minors under the age of 18 and hormones and puberty blockers for minors under the age of 16.

== Conversion therapy ==

Since 2022, conversion therapy (including attempting to &#x27;convert&#x27; transgender individuals to cisgender) has been illegal in all provinces and territories. The provinces of Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island had bans in place prior to the enactment of federal legislation. In 2018, the City of Vancouver became the only city in British Columbia to outlaw the practice, and in 2019 St. Albert became the first City in Alberta to ban the practice followed by Edmonton also in 2019, and Calgary in 2020. And on 9 March 2020, the Minister of Justice introduced Bill C-8, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (conversion therapy). Due to a prorogue of parliament by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the bill died and was later revived in 2020 as Bill C-6, and was passed in the House of Commons with some opposition from Conservative MPs.

=== Ontario ===
In 2015, Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne directed her Health Minister, Eric Hoskins, to petition the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario for a ban on conversion therapy under their standards of practice. As well, Wynne spoke in favour of a bill tabled by Cheri DiNovo, a member of the provincial New Democratic Party, that would outlaw any attempt to change the gender or sexuality of a person under 18 via therapy. The bill passed unanimously in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Wynne, as the first openly gay Premier in Canada, stated that youths expressing their sexuality and gender identity should be protected, and that young LGBTQ people are especially vulnerable to these conversion therapy practices.

=== Manitoba ===
Also in 2015, Manitoban Health Minister Sharon Blady announced plans for the province to ban the practice of conversion therapy, and stated that conversion therapy had &quot;no place&quot; in Manitoba&#x27;s healthcare system. This ban targeted the conversion of homosexual people to heterosexual, and had no specific provisions for transgender individuals being &quot;converted&quot; to cisgender.

=== Nova Scotia ===
A bill banning conversion therapy for sexual orientation and gender identity was passed unanimously in the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia in 2018. The bill, lauded by Nova Scotian Justice Minister Mark Furey as the &quot;most progressive piece of legislation around sexual orientation and gender identity in the country&quot;, bans the promotion of such practices to persons under 19, but contains a very controversial clause allowing &quot;mature minors&quot; between the ages of 16 and 18 to consent to being subject to the practice.

=== British Columbia ===
Members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia tabled legislation to ban the practice of conversion therapy in 2019 and again in 2020, although neither private member&#x27;s bill progressed passed first reading. In August 2019, the B.C. government called on the federal government to add conversion therapy into the Criminal Code of Canada and take action banning the practice nationwide.

==== Vancouver ====
Vancouver became the first jurisdiction in British Columbia to ban the practice for gender identity and sexual orientation in 2018. This ban, added to Vancouver&#x27;s business prohibition bylaw, prohibits the offering of these services to people of any age and was passed unanimously by the Vancouver City Council.

=== Alberta ===

==== Edmonton ====
The city of Edmonton unanimously passed bylaw 19061, prohibiting conversion therapy within the city.

==== St. Albert ====
Though conversion therapy has not been known to happen in St. Albert, the city council unanimously passed a motion to ban it as a statement against the practice.

== Restrictions on Rights ==

=== Pronouns in schools ===

2 Canadian provinces Saskatchewan (Parents&#x27; Bill of Rights), and Alberta (Education Amendment Act, 2024) have laws that require parental consent when students under 16 years old wish to change their gender pronouns. As of December 19, 2024, The Education Amendment Act, 2024 is not in force. In New Brunswick (Policy 713), was ammended in December 2024 to reverse changes that required parental consent for students to use their chosen name and pronouns.

=== Sports ===
In Alberta, the Fairness and Safety in Sport Act restricts both female competitive and amateur teams to those who were born female. As of December 19, 2024 the Act is not yet in force.

=== Health care ===
In Alberta, the Health Statutes Amendment Act would prohibit children under 16 from accessing puberty blockers for the purpose of treating gender dysphoria and all minors from receiving transgender surgery.

<doc id="882047" wikidata="Q6412460" url="?curid=882047" title="Kingdom Professional Wrestling">
<text>Kingdom, or Kingdom Professional Wrestling, was a Japanese shoot style professional wrestling promotion that held events in 1997 and 1998. It was considered a continuation of UWF International, having most of its former roster: Nobuhiko Takada, Yoji Anjo, Kazushi Sakuraba, Daijiro Matsui, Naoki Sano, Masahito Kakihara, Yoshihiro Takayama, Kenichi Yamamoto and Hiromitsu Kanehara.

Several wrestlers began pursuing mixed martial arts during their time at the promotion, most notably Kazushi Sakuraba who won the UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan heavyweight tournament representing Kingdom. The promotion is also a predecessor to the Pride Fighting Championships, which held their first event towards the demise of Kingdom. With the rise of mixed martial arts, Kingdom held legitimate shoot fights in their events.

==History==

Kingdom&#x27;s popularity did not reach or surpass that of the UWF International. Attempts to rectify this by using talent from other shoot-style promotions including Battlarts did little to help, and it seemed that in the eyes of the Japanese fans the era of shoot style wrestling had ended. As a result, Kingdom would go out of business in March 1998.

In the aftermath, Matsui, Sakuraba, Sano and Takada focused on competing for mixed martial arts promotion Pride as part of the Takada Dojo camp. Yamamoto and Kanehara jumped to Rings, which had been a splinter promotion formed from the UWF much like UWF International had been. Meanwhile, Kakihara and Takayama joined All Japan Pro Wrestling as free agents, while Anjo dabbled in K-1 before later reappearing in All Japan Pro Wrestling and Dream Stage Entertainment&#x27;s Hustle as &quot;Commander Anjoe&quot;.

A former trainee of the Kingdom dojo, Hidetada Irie, who debuted at Kingdom&#x27;s final event, formed a successor promotion called &quot;Kingdom Ehrgeiz&quot;, with himself as the top star. The promotion, however, is very obscure and only promotes cards periodically.

<doc id="882048" wikidata="Q3020852" url="?curid=882048" title="Debendranath Tagore">
<text>Debendranath Tagore (15 May 1817 – 19 January 1905; birth name: Debendronath Thakur) was an Indian philosopher and religious reformer, active in the Brahmo Samaj (earlier called Bhramho Sabha) (&quot;Society of Brahma&quot;, also translated as &quot;Society of God&quot;). He joined Brahmo samaj in 1842. He was the founder in 1848 of the Brahmo religion, which today is synonymous with Brahmoism. Born in Shilaidaha, his father was the industrialist Dwarakanath Tagore; he himself had 14 children, many of whom, including Nobel-prize winning poet Rabindranath Tagore, made significant artistic or literary contributions to society.

==Thakur Bari (House of Tagores)==
Debendranath Tagore was born to the famous industrialist Dwarakanath Tagore, who was called &#x27;Prince&#x27; because of his extravagant lifestyle, and Digambari Devi, a very pious lady, in the Tagore family in Jorasanko, popularly known as Jorasanko Thakur Bari in North-western Kolkata, which was later converted into a campus of the Rabindra Bharati University. The Tagore family, with over three hundred years of history, has been one of the leading families of Calcutta, and is regarded as a key influence during the Bengal Renaissance. The family has produced several persons who have contributed substantially in the fields of business, social and religious reformation, literature, art and music. His siblings were Girindranath Tagore (b.1820) and Nagendranath Tagore (b.1829).

== Education and work ==
Debendranath studied at home from 1820 to 1827. In 1829, he was admitted to the Anglo Hindu College established by Raja Rammohan Roy. After studying there for some time, he started looking after his father&#x27;s property and business, as well as philosophy and religion. When his grandfather died in 1838, he had a mental change. He became interested in religion and started studying various subjects including Mahabharata, Upanishads and Eastern-Western philosophy. As a result, he developed a desire for spirituality. He established the &quot;Tattwara Jani Sabha&quot; (1839), which was later renamed as the Tattwabodhini Sabha. At this time he published a Bengali translation of the Katha Upanishad (1840).

In 1842, Debendranath took charge of the Tattwabodhini Sabha and the Brahmo Samaj. The following year, the Tattwabodhini Magazine was published in his own money under the editorship of Akshay Kumar Datta. In this newspaper, the Upanishads were published with Debendranath&#x27;s scholarship and Bengali translation. With the efforts of Debendranath, the public meetings were started on the Vedas. In 1844, Debendranath introduced the first method of Brahmopasana and from the following year it was used in the Brahmo Samaj. As a result of his long study of scriptures, he realized that it was not possible to lay the foundation of Brahmanism on the Upanishads alone. So from 1848 onwards, he gradually started publishing a translation of the Rig Veda in the Tattwabodhini magazine, which was published in a library called Brahmo Dharma (1869). In 1850, another of his books, Atmattvavidya, was published. In 1853, he was appointed secretary of the Tattwabodhini Sabha and in 1859 established the Brahma Vidyalaya.

Debendranath stopped the pooja-parvanadi and introduced festivals like &#x27;Magh Utsav&#x27;, &#x27;New Year&#x27;, &#x27;Diksha Din&#x27; etc. In 1867, he bought a large piece of land called Bhubandaga in Birbhum and established an ashram. This ashram is today&#x27;s famous Santiniketan. He was also one of the founders of the Bethune Society of the Hindu Charitable Institution.

Debendranath was actively involved in politics for some time. When the British Indian Association was established on 31 October 1851, he was appointed its secretary. He tried his best to waive the chowkidari tax of the poor villagers and sent a letter to the British Parliament demanding India&#x27;s autonomy. Debendranath was enthusiastic about the practice of widow marriage, but was opposed to child marriage and polygamy. He also made a special contribution to the spread of education. In 1867, Radhakanta Dev conferred on him the title of &#x27;Protector of National Religion&#x27; and &#x27;Maharshi&#x27; by the Brahmo Samaj to protect the Indian youth from the influence of Christianity.

<doc id="882049" wikidata="Q27722" url="?curid=882049" title="Jealous Guy">
<text>&quot;Jealous Guy&quot; is a song written and originally recorded by the English rock musician John Lennon from his second studio album &quot;Imagine&quot; (1971). Not released as a single during Lennon&#x27;s lifetime, it became an international hit in a version by Roxy Music issued in early 1981; this version reached #1 in the UK and Australia, and was a top 10 hit in several European countries. Lennon&#x27;s own version was subsequently issued as a single, and charted in the US and UK.

Lennon began writing the song in 1968, when, as &quot;Child of Nature&quot;, it was among the many songs demoed by the Beatles before they recorded their self-titled double album (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;). The lyrics were originally inspired by a lecture given by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in early 1968, when the Beatles attended his spiritual retreat in Rishikesh, India. In January 1969, The Beatles (primarily John) jammed the song during their &quot;Get Back&quot; / &quot;Let It Be&quot; recording sessions, where it was referred to as &quot;On the Road to Marrakesh&quot;.

== Origins ==
The song&#x27;s inspiration came in India, after the Beatles attended a lecture by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi about a &quot;son of the mother nature&quot;. This inspired both Paul McCartney and John Lennon to write songs about the same subject. McCartney&#x27;s composition, &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot;, was selected for &quot;The Beatles&quot;, but Lennon did not attempt to record &quot;Child of Nature&quot; during the sessions for the album. Both were demoed at George Harrison&#x27;s Esher home in May 1968. The demo of &quot;Child of Nature&quot; featured Lennon&#x27;s double-tracked vocal and playing an acoustic guitar. Early the following year, Lennon revisited the song as &quot;On the Road to Marrakesh&quot; during the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions. Eventually, the lyrics were scrapped and replaced by the now well-known &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; lyrics for &quot;Imagine&quot;.

Listening to the original Esher Demo, the song begins &quot;On the road to Rishikesh&quot; and mentions mountains. It is not referring to Marrakesh in Morocco, and there is no evidence Lennon ever visited there. In its rewritten form, the song serves as a confessional in which Lennon addresses the feelings of inadequacy that resulted in pain for those he loved.

Three recordings of &quot;Child of Nature&quot; are currently known. The first is a demo of the song recorded at the home of George Harrison in May 1968. The second, on which Harrison sings backing vocals, was recorded at Twickenham Film Studios on 2 January 1969. A third recording was made at the Beatles&#x27; Apple Studio on 24 January. A snatch of the chorus from the second recording appears on the &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; bonus disc packaged with &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; (2003). The first recording appears on the fiftieth anniversary release of &quot;The Beatles&quot;, which contains all of the demos recorded at Esher.

==Recording==
Lennon recorded &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; on 24 May 1971 at Ascot Sound Studios, where his vocals were overdubbed on 29 May 1971. String overdubs took place on 4 July 1971 at the Record Plant, in New York City. Musicians included Mike Pinder of the Moody Blues and Joey Molland and Tom Evans of Badfinger.

Nicky Hopkins plays the distinctive piano part that runs through the song. His performance drew praise from those attending the sessions, including Yoko Ono.

==Release==
Lennon&#x27;s recording of &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; was released on the &quot;Imagine&quot; album in 1971. It was not released as a single until November 1985, five years after Lennon&#x27;s murder, and four-and-a-half years after Roxy Music had taken their cover of the song to number one. Accompanied on the B-side by &quot;Going Down on Love&quot;, a track from &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; (1974), the single reached number 65 in the UK charts.

In the United States, the single reached number 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in November 1988, in conjunction with the release of the documentary film &quot;&quot;. &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; also peaked at number 22 on the Hot Adult Contemporary chart.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Stereogum&quot; contributors Timothy and Elizabeth Bracy rated it as Lennon&#x27;s second best solo song behind &quot;Instant Karma!&quot;, saying that &quot;we have Lennon at his most wounded and vulnerable, confessing to every manner of emotional extortion, and somehow still on the defensive&quot; in a song with &quot;a melody worthy of anything the Beatles ever produced.&quot;

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Stephen Lewis rated it as Lennon&#x27;s third greatest solo love song, calling it &quot;one of his most mature piano melodies.&quot;

== Personnel ==
The following musicians performed on the final track on &quot;Imagine&quot;:

* John Lennon – vocals, acoustic guitar, whistling
* Nicky Hopkins – piano
* John Barham – harmonium
* Alan White – vibraphone
* Klaus Voormann – bass
* Jim Keltner – drums
* Mike Pinder – tambourine
* Joey Molland and Tom Evans – acoustic guitars
* The Flux Fiddlers – strings

== Promotional video ==

A promotional video was made for the song in 1971. It showed, mostly in a continuous overhead shot by helicopter, John and Yoko travelling in a hearse from their Tittenhurst Park mansion to a nearby lake, where they were then shown getting into a row boat.

==Other versions==
&quot;Jealous Guy&quot; has been recorded by many musicians including Aslan, Joe Cocker, Roberto Bellarosa, Donny Hathaway, Claudine Longet, the Faces, Frankie Miller, Roxy Music, Belinda Carlisle, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Peter Criss, Elliott Smith, Deftones, Spector, and the Weeknd. Lou Reed covered the song for a 2001 Lennon tribute concert. Jazz musician Jimmy Scott covered &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; on his 1998 album &quot;Holding Back the Years&quot;. The rock band the Black Crowes released a live cover of &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; on the 30th anniversary release of their debut studio album &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot; (1990).

===Roxy Music version===
Following Lennon&#x27;s murder in 1980, Roxy Music added a version of the song to their set while touring in Germany, which they recorded and released in February 1981. The single was released by Polydor with &quot;To Turn You On&quot; as the B-side, with catalogue number &quot;ROXY 2&quot;. The song was the only UK No. 1 hit for Roxy Music, topping the charts for two weeks in March 1981.
&quot;To Turn You On&quot; later appeared on their eighth studio album &quot;Avalon&quot; (1982), although it was slightly remixed. Roxy Music&#x27;s cover of &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; features on many Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music collections and 1980s music compilations, though not always in its full-length version. As of 1982, the single had sold 91,000 copies in Australia.

===== Year-end charts =====
===== Music video =====
A music video was filmed for the song, which mainly consisted of Bryan Ferry singing to camera before whistling and playing on a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 synthesizer during the coda. Guitarist Phil Manzanera and saxophonist Andy Mackay also appear in the video during their respective solos.

=== Roberto Bellarosa version ===

In 2012, Belgian singer of Italian origin Roberto Bellarosa recorded &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; after winning the first season of &quot;The Voice Belgique&quot;. It was released as a single on 4 April 2012 and included on his debut studio album &quot;Ma voie&quot;. The single reached number 4 in Belgium.

<doc id="882050" wikidata="Q1244791" url="?curid=882050" title="Mannequin (1987 film)">
<text>Mannequin is a 1987 American romantic comedy film directed by Michael Gottlieb in his directorial debut, and written by Edward Rugoff and Gottlieb. It stars Andrew McCarthy, Kim Cattrall, Estelle Getty, James Spader, Meshach Taylor, and G. W. Bailey. The original music score was composed by Sylvester Levay. The film revolves around a chronically underemployed passionate artist named Jonathan Switcher who lands a job as a department-store window dresser and the mannequin he created which becomes inhabited by the spirit of a woman from Ancient Egypt, but only comes alive for Jonathan.

&quot;Mannequin&quot; received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for its main title song, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot; by Starship, which reached number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart. Both early and later critical reception has been generally negative with common criticisms being made towards the ludicrous premise and the overly farcical and sentimental tone; however, audience responses have been comparatively more positive and in the years since its release, the film has developed a cult following. In 1991, a sequel called &quot;Mannequin Two: On the Move&quot; was released with none of the original cast (except Taylor) returning.

==Plot==

In Ancient Egypt, Ema &quot;Emmy&quot; Hesire takes refuge in a pyramid, pleading to the gods that she find true love rather than enter an arranged marriage. Emmy suddenly vanishes before her mother&#x27;s eyes. In 1987 Philadelphia, Jonathan Switcher is a sculptor working at a mannequin warehouse and finishes a single female mannequin he considers a masterpiece. His boss fires him for spending time trying to make his mannequins works of art rather than assembling several each day.

Jonathan takes a number of odd jobs and is fired each time for working too slowly because he tries to make each project artistic. His girlfriend Roxie Shield, an employee of the Illustra department store, dumps him, criticizing him as a flake. After his motorcycle breaks down in the rain, Jonathan passes the Prince &amp; Company department store. Seeing his mannequin in the display window, he remarks she is the first work that made him feel like a true artist. The next morning, he saves store owner Claire Timkin from being injured by her own shop sign. Grateful, Claire orders store manager Mr. Richards (who is secretly paid by Illustra to sabotage Prince &amp; Company so it can be bought) to give Jonathan a job. Viewed with suspicion by security guard Captain Felix Maxwell, Jonathan works with and befriends flamboyant window dresser Hollywood Montrose. When Jonathan is putting together a window display, the mannequin he made comes to life with Emmy&#x27;s spirit. She says she has existed for centuries as a muse, sometimes inhabiting the works of an artist she admires and inspires. She has encountered amazing people but has never found true love. Emmy explains the gods allow her life when she and Jonathan are unobserved, otherwise she is a mannequin.

With Emmy&#x27;s help, Jonathan&#x27;s window display is a massive success. Now placed in charge of visual merchandising, Jonathan asks Emmy to continue helping with the displays. Over several weeks, they create several popular displays, attracting new business while also deepening their relationship. Montrose realizes Jonathan loves a mannequin he created but does not judge him. Illustra&#x27;s chief executive B.J. Wert sends Roxie to poach Jonathan but he refuses, saying he now works for people who value him. Annoyed by Felix&#x27;s ineptitude and Richards&#x27; attitude towards Jonathan, Claire fires them. Deeply impressed with his work, Claire makes Jonathan vice president of the department store. One night, Jonathan takes Emmy through the city on his motorcycle, despite how unusual this seems to bystanders. He is witnessed by Richards and Felix, who conclude he is deeply fixated on a female mannequin.

Richards and Felix (who now works for Illustra) steal the female mannequins from Prince &amp; Company. The next morning, Jonathan confronts Wert about the theft, who makes another job offer. Furious over Jonathan caring so much about the mannequin he calls Emmy, Roxie storms off. Jonathan follows Roxie while being pursued by security guards including Felix. Wert and Richards demand the police be called. Roxie loads the stolen mannequins into the store&#x27;s large trash compactor, then is knocked out by debris. As Hollywood holds the pursuers at bay with a fire hose, a janitor watches Jonathan jump onto the compactor&#x27;s conveyor belt to save the mannequin that is Emmy. As Jonathan risks his life for her, Emmy comes to life. Once safe, she realizes she is truly and permanently alive again. Emmy thanks the gods for uniting her with her true love and Jonathan promises to love her forever.

While the janitor wonders if other mannequins will come to life, Hollywood arrives and realizes Emmy was alive the entire time. Felix and his fellow guards rush in, followed by Wert and Richards who demand the police arrest Jonathan. Claire arrives, revealing she has security video of Richards and Felix breaking and entering, and committing theft. She accuses Wert of conspiracy, and Jonathan adds the man also kidnapped Emmy. Wert fires Roxie as he is arrested and hauled away alongside Richards and Felix. Jonathan realizes the security footage may have shown him being romantic with a mannequin, but Claire coyly suggests he should not worry about that. Some time later, Jonathan and Emmy are married in the store window of Prince &amp; Company, with Claire as maid of honor and Hollywood as best man. Numerous pedestrians outside the store window applaud the wedding.

==Production==
===Development===
The idea for the film came when director Michael Gottlieb was walking down Fifth Avenue and thought he saw a mannequin move in the window of Bergdorf Goodman. Others observe the similarities to the plot of the film &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; (1948). The film was made based on the marketing principles of noted Hollywood market researcher Joseph Farrell, who served as an executive producer. The film was specifically designed to appeal to target demographics. Though not a star, McCarthy was cast after tests of his films showed that he strongly appealed to girls, the target audience.

===Filming===
The producers contacted various state film commissions across America looking for an elegant center city department store in which to shoot the movie. They visited stores across the country before settling on John Wanamaker&#x27;s in Philadelphia (now Macy&#x27;s Center City). The store was given the name Prince and Company for the film. Interior filming at Wanamaker&#x27;s took about three weeks, with shooting usually beginning around 9 pm and going until 6 am the next day.

Additional scenes were filmed in the formal gardens behind The Hotel Hershey. Scenes taking place at the fictitious department store Illustra were filmed at the Boscov&#x27;s department store in the former Camp Hill Mall (now Camp Hill Shopping Center) near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode estimated the film injected $3 million into the city.

Prior to the start of filming Cattrall spent six weeks posing for Santa Monica sculptor, Tanya Wolf Ragir, who captured her likeness. Six mannequins, each with a different expression, were made. Cattrall recalled, &quot;There&#x27;s no way to play a mannequin except if you want to sit there as a dummy [...] I did a lot of body-building because I wanted to be as streamlined as possible. I wanted to match the mannequins as closely as I could.&quot; The actress also said that doing the film made her feel &quot;grown up&quot;:

I&#x27;ve become more of a leading lady instead of, like, the girl... All the other movies that I&#x27;ve done I played the girl, and the plot was around the guy. I&#x27;ve never had anybody to do special lighting for me, or find out what clothes look good on me, or what camera angles are best for me... In this movie, I learned a lot from it. It&#x27;s almost like learning old Hollywood techniques... I&#x27;ve always been sort of a tomboy. I feel great being a girl, wearing a dress.

===Music===
Featured in the film, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot; was co-written by Albert Hammond and Diane Warren and recorded by the American rock band Starship in 1986. It is a duet featuring Starship vocalists Grace Slick and Mickey Thomas. It reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on April 4, 1987, and topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks the following month, becoming the UK&#x27;s second-biggest-selling single of 1987.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film debuted at number three at the US box office behind &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot;, grossing $6 million over the four-day President&#x27;s Day weekend, surpassing the other opener, &quot;Over the Top&quot; starring Sylvester Stallone. To date, the film has grossed a total of $42.7 million in the United States and Canada.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 20% based on 40 reviews and an average rating of 3.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Mannequin&quot; is a real dummy, outfitted with a ludicrous concept and a painfully earnest script that never springs to life, despite the best efforts of an impossibly charming Kim Cattrall.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 21 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F. It was savaged by Leonard Maltin, who called it &quot;absolute rock-bottom fare, dispiriting for anyone who remembers what movie comedy should be&quot;. In his print review, Roger Ebert awarded it a half star and wrote, &quot;A lot of bad movies are fairly throbbing with life. &quot;Mannequin&quot; is dead. The wake lasts 1 1/2 hours, and then we can leave the theater.&quot;

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;made by, for, and about dummies&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; puts the blame on the writer-director: &quot;as co-written and directed by Michael Gottlieb, &quot;Mannequin&quot; is a state-of-the-art showcase of perfunctory technique&quot;. Dan McQuade, writing in &quot;Philadelphia Magazine&quot;, referencing the film&#x27;s use of Philadelphia as a setting, panned the film and wrote, &quot;The message of &quot;Mannequin&quot;, clumsy as it is, is that the greatest place and time in recorded history is 1980s Philadelphia... Truly, this is the most uplifting film ever made about the city.&quot;

David Cornelius of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Mannequin&quot; is one of the stupidest movies ever conceived, and one of the worst. Which makes it, in its own lousy way, mesmerizing. To watch it is to get sucked in by its hypnotic ways; its very off-the-wall shoddiness is astounding. Spader alone is worth the price of admission – surely aware of the movie&#x27;s badness, the actor hams it up with a deliriously over-the-top performance.&quot; He called it &quot;a Bad Movie Essential&quot; but warned viewers with a lower pain threshold for bad films to &quot;obviously skip it as it is a dreadful film&quot;.

Though initially poorly received, &quot;Mannequin&quot; has been cited as a romantic comedy cult classic and has managed to garner an ardent and strong cult following; its fans have praised the film&#x27;s sets, costumes, supporting cast, script, and the romantic chemistry between lead actors McCarthy and Cattrall. The film is considered one of the many popular comedy films from the golden age of 1980s Brat Pack films because it features actors Spader, Cattrall, and McCarthy who all starred in other movies of that era. Retrospective reviews have also commended the provocative and progressive portrayal of Hollywood for being an unashamedly positive homosexual character who befriends the main character and manages to be heroic in the finale.

===Accolades===
==Home media==
&quot;Mannequin&quot; was released on VHS, Betamax, and digital stereo LaserDisc format in September 1987 by Cannon Films through Media Home Entertainment. The film was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on October 7, 2004, in a widescreen Region 1 DVD, and was later re-released to DVD on January 16, 2008, in a new double feature edition with &quot;Mannequin Two: On the Move&quot; as the second disc. &quot;Mannequin&quot; was released on Blu-ray for the first time by Olive Films (under license from MGM) on November 3, 2015.

==Sequels and legacy==
In 1991, a sequel called &quot;Mannequin Two: On the Move&quot; was released and was directed by Stewart Raffill. It was nowhere near as profitable, grossing under $4 million, and was dubbed as &quot;one of the worst follow-ups ever made&quot;. In 2010, Gladden Entertainment executives were said to be in the &quot;early development&quot; stage of the remake, envisioning a plot of the man crushing on a &quot;laser display hologram&quot; as opposed to a mannequin. However, no further details were made public about its development. An original mannequin prop was located by Philadelphia brand South Fellini in 2019 and has been placed on display in the company&#x27;s boutique. The film was also parodied by James Corden and Victoria Beckham in 2017 on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; as a precursor to the Carpool Karaoke segment.

==History==

=== Early history ===

The regiment dates as far back as 1822 in York, Upper Canada (now Toronto). For the remainder of the 19th century this troop was recognized as the cavalry of the city of Toronto. It has links to the 1st York Light Dragoons formed in 1810 by Captain (later Major) John Button or Button&#x27;s Troop (commanded until 1831). Also known as &#x27;Denison&#x27;s Troop&#x27;, it began as the York Dragoons under the command of Captain George Taylor Denison I. Under the Militia Act of 1793, service in the militia was mandatory for all healthy male citizens aged 16 to 60 years. Like most militia in Canada during this period, the Dragoons were raised and financed by wealthy gentry, in this case the Denison family, as volunteers were not part of a regular army. The Dragoons began as a local mounted infantry company linked to the parent West York Regiment of Militia. This peculiar organization was a practice that started during the American Revolution with the Loyalist militia regiment the &quot;Queen&#x27;s York Rangers&quot;. Light cavalry was needed to provide dispatch duty, scouting, flank protection and picketing for the infantry battalion. Full militia cavalry regiments were too expensive to operate and large scale cavalry operations were of little use in the dense forests of eastern North America. The cavalry troop was sufficient to serve the purpose and militia infantry were allowed to raise cavalry troops under the Militia Act of 1808. This unit, like many local military units, was made up of volunteers and formed to supplement the presence of British Army units in Upper Canada. The company or troop broke from the parent infantry battalion and became an independent troop of cavalry in 1839.The troop was one of only two fully uniformed militia units to rally to the flag with the threat of unrest and rebellion within the colony, in 1837. The troop was given new uniforms, fully armed and redesignated the &quot;Queens Light Dragoons&quot; (QLD). Operating alongside the local Markham Troop, forming a squadron, the QLD participated in a number of actions during the rebellion to include Gallows Hill, Navy Island and Town of Scotland. The Toronto troop was on active service for several months during this crisis.

In 1866, the troop was the only cavalry in Upper Canada to be placed on active duty, engaged and employed against the Fenian Irish Republican Army invasion from the United States. The troop lead Col Peacock&#x27;s Column to meet the Fenian force along the Niagara Peninsula as scouts. The troop was the first unit to enter and relieve the town of Fort Erie - capturing several Fenians before they escaped across the Niagara River. The Fenian force was defeated and many of its members arrested by Canadian and American authorities.

By the mid-19th Century, Britain began to pull its army out of Canada for the Crimea War and the need to establish a Canadian army became clear. With the enactment of the Militia Act of 1855, the Canadian Militia Department was established. Under the act, the Canadian Militia unit establishment was drafted by the new department. Local militia units for the first time were recognized as standing units to become a more critical part of the defence of Canada. In 1847 the unit was gazetted and became known as the 1st Toronto Independent Troop of Cavalry. It was renamed again in 1855 as the 1st Troop of Volunteer Militia Cavalry of the County of York and placed on the Militia list 27 Sept 1855. In 1866 it was renamed 1st York Troop The Governor General&#x27;s Body Guard for Upper Canada and in 1867 became The Governor General&#x27;s Body Guard for Ontario. After British forces completely left Canada in 1870 the Canadian Government raised a small regular force and began to look at reorganizing the Militia cavalry into full regiments. Most of the independent troops across the country were amalgamated into numbered regiments of dragoons or hussars during the 1870s. The GGBG was the only non-numbered corps and was expanded to squadron strength in 1876. With a final rationalization of the Canadian Cavalry Corps in 1889, the GGBG was brought to full regimental strength with the amalgamation of the local Markham and Oak Ridges Troops of the 2nd Regiment of Cavalry (later the 2nd Dragoons). The name was changed a final time in 1895 to The Governor General&#x27;s Body Guard of Canada.

=== The North-West Rebellion ===
The GGBG was mobilized as a full squadron and participated in the North-West Rebellion in 1885 as rear area security for General Middleton&#x27;s force. The squadron&#x27;s task was to protect the main supply route for the force in place with routine patrols from the rail line to Batoche and to secure the only supply depot and telegraph station at Humboldt. A fort was built, consisting of an earthen berm, around the telegraph station and named &quot;Fort Denison&quot;. Middelton&#x27;s force defeated the Metis at Batoche.

=== The South African War ===
The GGBG, as a regiment, supplied some 50 men to augment the small Canadian Regular Army for service in South Africa in 1900. Lieutenant Hampton Cockburn earned the Victoria Cross while serving as a volunteer with the Royal Canadian Dragoons during the war.

=== The Great War ===
The GGBG, like all of the militia during the First World War, was not activated for duty, but rather assisted in raising numbered battalions for the Canadian Expeditionary Force and recruiting to fill the CEF ranks. Thousands of Toronto&#x27;s citizens were recruited through the GGBG for service in the trenches. The GGBG supplied soldiers for the 3rd Bn, 2nd Bn, 4th CMR, 216th Bn, 124th Bn to name a few.

=== 1920s-1930s ===
In 1936 the regiment was amalgamated with The Mississauga Horse to become The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards.

<text>The Industrial Age is a period of history that encompasses the changes in economic and social organization that began around 1760 in Great Britain and later in other countries, characterized chiefly by the replacement of hand tools with power-driven machines such as the power loom and the steam engine, and by the concentration of industry in large establishments.

While it is commonly believed that the Industrial Age was supplanted by the Information Age in the late 20th century, a view that has become common since the Revolutions of 1989, much of the Third World economy is still based on manufacturing, although mobile phones are now commonplace even in the poorest of countries, enabling access to global information networks. Even though many developing countries remain largely industrial, the Information Age is increasingly on the ground.

==Origins==
Huge changes in agricultural methods made the Industrial Revolution possible. This agricultural revolution started with changes in farming in the Netherlands, later developed by the British.

The Industrial Age began in Great Britain in the mid-18th century and was fueled by coal mining from places such as Wales and County Durham.

The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain because it had the factors of production, land (all natural resources), capital, and labour. Britain had plenty of harbors that enabled trade, Britain had access to capital, such as goods and money, for example, tools, machinery, equipment, and inventory. Britain, lastly, had an abundance of labor, or industrial workers in this case. There are many other conditions that help show why the Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain. The British Isles and colonies overseas represented huge markets that created a large demand for British goods. Britain also had one of the largest spheres of influence due to its massive navy and merchant marine. The British government&#x27;s concern for commercial interests was also important. 
The steam engine allowed for steamboats and the locomotives, which made transportation much faster. By the mid-19th century the Industrial Revolution had spread to Continental Europe and North America, and since then it has spread to most of the world.

==The textile industry==
The cotton industry was the first industry to go through mechanization, the use of automatic machinery to increase production. The domestic system sprouted as a result of when businesses began importing raw cotton, employing spinners and weavers to make it into cloth from their home. James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, which could produce eight times as much thread as a single spinning wheel, and Richard Arkwright made it driven by water. Later Arkwright opened a spinning mill which marked the beginning of the factory system. In 1785, Edmund Cartwright invented a loom which was powered by water.

==Steam engines==

In 1712, Thomas Newcomen produced the first successful steam engine, and in 1769, James Watt patented the modern steam engine. As a result, steam replaced water as industry&#x27;s major power source.

The steam engine allowed for steamboats and the locomotives, which made transportation much faster. By the mid-19th century the Industrial Revolution had spread to Continental Europe and North America, and since then it has spread to most of the world.

The Industrial Age is defined by mass production, broadcasting, the rise of the nation state, power, modern medicine and running water. The quality of human life has increased dramatically during the Industrial Age. Life expectancy today worldwide is more than twice as high as it was when the Industrial Revolution began.

<doc id="882058" wikidata="Q2366119" url="?curid=882058" title="Dazzling Killmen">
<text>Dazzling Killmen was an American math rock band from the St. Louis, Missouri area. Formed in 1990, the group issued four singles and two full-lengths before officially ending in 1995, with a majority of it released through the independent label Skin Graft Records. Taking influence from hardcore punk and jazz music, the band has been noted by critics to have helped influence genres such as math rock and post-metal.

==Biography==
The group, named after a character from Lucas Samaras&#x27; &quot;Crude Delights&quot;, formed in 1990, and was composed of jazz students—drummer Blake Fleming, bassist Darin Gray, vocalist/guitarist Nick Sakes, and later on guitarist Tim Garrigan, who joined the group initially as a guest musician for the &quot;Medicine Man&quot; 7-inch single. Gray, Fleming, and Garrigan all previously performed in their high school band. The group has named bands such as Ultraman, Black Flag, Minutemen, Captain Beefheart, Big Black, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane influences for their personal sound.

With their early singles and 1992 debut LP &quot;Dig Out the Switch&quot;, Dazzling Killmen caught the attention of the Chicago-based noise rock label Skin Graft Records, who proceeded to release the band&#x27;s next few singles as well as their second and final full-length &quot;Face of Collapse&quot;. The group would later break up in the fall of 1995, immediately prior to a planned tour of Japan with Jim O&#x27;Rourke.

Today, its members are better-known for their later projects - Nick Sakes has been in bands Colossamite, Sicbay, and xaddax. Darin Gray was in You Fantastic!, Grand Ulena, Brise-Glace, and has performed and recorded with Jim O&#x27;Rourke and with Glenn Kotche in On Fillmore. Blake Fleming was in Laddio Bolocko, The Mars Volta and Electric Turn to Me. Tim Garrigan, now based in Brooklyn, is in Skryptor and a solo artist.

== Legacy ==
Dazzling Killmen has been cited as an influence by musicians such as Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan, Jes Steineger of Coalesce, Mike Taylor of Pg. 99, KEN mode, Knut, and The Nation Blue.

The group&#x27;s music has been stated to of helped influence the development of multiple genres of music, with Brad Cohen writing for Clryvnt stating that the band &quot;helped usher in myriad movements, including math rock, math metal and progcore, all the while defying classification.&quot; Robin Jahdi named &quot;Face of Collapse&quot; as one of the best post-metal albums ever released, also stating that Dazzling Killmen &quot;were ostensibly noise rock&quot; and that they had left behind a &quot;fantastic – if largely unknown – legacy in the form of [&quot;Face of Collapse&quot;].&quot; In 2013, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine named Blake Fleming as among the 100 best drummers in alternative music.

<text>Bunge Land or Zemlya Bunge is a huge empty and almost barren intermediate zone in the Anzhu Islands north of Siberia. It is located between Kotelny and Faddeyevsky, which, unlike Bunge Land, could be described as proper islands. Sandy and flat, its area is 6,200 km2.

Since most of its surface rises only to a maximum height of 8 m above sea level, Bunge Land is flooded during storm surges, except for a very small area in the southeast that rises to an elevation of 11 to 21 m above sea level. The area that is periodically submerged accounts for over 80% of the total surface and is practically devoid of vegetation.

Bunge Land is named after Russian zoologist and explorer Alexander Alexandrovich Bunge.

<doc id="882070" wikidata="Q726805" url="?curid=882070" title="Jahiliyyah">
<text>Al-Jāhiliyyah (The Age of Ignorance) is a historical era in Islamic salvation history that can describe the pre-Islamic Arabian past or just the Hejaz leading up to the life of Muhammad.

The Arabic expression (meaning literally “the age or condition of ignorance”), indicates an evaluation of selected parts of earlier Arabian history from a strongly Islamic perspective The Jahiliyyah, often criticised by historians asreligious propaganda because the term served as a grand narrative to paint pre-Islamic Arabic&#x27;s as barbarians in a morally corrupt social order. Its people (the &quot;jahl&quot;, sing. &quot;jāhil&quot;) lacked religious knowledge (&quot;ʿilm&quot;) and civilized qualities (&quot;ḥilm&quot;). As a result, they committed polytheism and idol worship, female infanticide, had societies rife with tyranny, injustice, despotism, and anarchy, and prejudice resulted in vainglorious tribal antagonisms. The pre-Islamic age was essentialized into a group of attributes and societal functions that could be condensed into a barbaric way of life that stood in contrast with the mission of Muhammad and the way of life he introduced. Today, this narrative is not considered historical. As a grand narrative or master narrative, and as a discourse, it served the role of validating and even necessitating the venture of Islam. Analogous grand narratives that have existed across societies include the Age of Enlightenment succeeding a Dark Ages in European history, and the idea that the coming of Jesus Christ served to redeem a world contaminated by Original Sin.

In modern Islamist writings, the concept is used to refer to a decadent moral state accused of imitating the Jahiliyyah. Islamists have used this concept of &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; to criticize un-Islamic conduct in the Muslim world. Prominent Muslim theologians like Muhammad Rashid Rida and Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, among others, have used the term as a reference to secular modernity and, by extension, to modern Western culture. In his works, Maududi asserts that modernity is the &quot;new &quot;jahiliyyah&quot;.&quot; Sayyid Qutb viewed &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; as a state of domination of humans over humans, as opposed to their submission to God. Likewise, radical Muslim groups have often justified the use of violence against secular regimes by framing their armed struggle as a &quot;jihad&quot; to strike down modern forms of &quot;jahiliyyah&quot;. Ibn Taymiyyah and Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab have both viewed their fellow Muslims as living in a state of &quot;jahiliyyah&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; is derived from the Arabic verbal root &quot;jahala&quot; &quot;to be ignorant or stupid, to act stupidly&quot;. It has been suggested that the word &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; in the Quran means &quot;ignorant people&quot;, in contrast to traditionalist or contemporary notions of an &quot;age&quot; or &quot;state of ignorance&quot;.

== Jahili society ==
According to Islamic religious scholars, a regular practice during the Jahiliyyah was for Arabians to commit female infanticide by burying their daughters alive (which they called &quot;waʾd al-banāt&quot;). According to Al-Tha&#x27;labi (d. 1035) in his commentary on Quran 81:8:When a man had a daughter and he wanted to spare her life, he would dress her in a garment of wool or hair, and [when she had grown up] she would watch over his camels and sheep in the steppe. If he wanted to kill her, he would let her live until she was six spans in length (sudāsiyyah) and then say to her mother, “Perfume and adorn her, for I will take her to meet her relatives.” [Instead,] he had dug a pit for her in the desert where he would take her. He would say to her, “Look there.” Then he would push her into it from her back and pour earth over her until the ground was even …

And Ibn ʿAbbās has said that when a pregnant woman was about to give birth during the jāhiliyyah, she would dig a grave and give birth next to it. If it was a daughter, she would cast her in the grave, and if it was a son, she would keep him.According to another source, &quot;[e]very day a pit was dug in the corner of the desert for an innocent girl to be buried&quot;. Ilkka Lindstedt argues that notions of this practice in the &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; derived as an inference of two verses in the Quran (16:57–59, 81:8–9). Lindstedt, however, argues that there is little evidence to support such a practice in pre-Islamic Arabia and that the Quranic verses themselves are unlikely to have originally carried this meaning.

During the early Umayyad era, intense intertribal competition took place in order to acquire appointments of generalships and governorships over newly conquered territories. It is thought that it was around this time that widespread Islamic critiques began taking place of partisan tribalism (&quot;ʿaṣabiyyah&quot;). These critiques were then attributed to Muhammad in order to describe and discredit &quot;ʿaṣabiyyah&quot; as a defining characteristic of the Jahiliyyah.

Other extreme and violent practices attributed to the Jahiliyyah included cannibalism, corpse mutilation, abuse and torture of captives, and random murder. In one tradition, Muhammad&#x27;s uncle, Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib, is killed in the Battle of Uhud: subsequently, the &quot;jahl&quot; mutilated his corpse. Muhammad, by contrast, forbade the mutilation of corpses. They were also said to have tortured some Muslim prisoners they captured.

A practice regularly attributed to the Jahiliyyah was overly emotional wailing over the death of loved ones (&quot;niyāḥa&quot;), contrasted in tradition with the more civilized and rational Islamic practice of accepting the inevitability of death without excessive displays of emotion. G.H.A. Juynboll demonstrated that Islamic attitudes towards &quot;niyāḥa&quot; were far from uniform and that the absolute prohibition against it emerged in Iraq in the second half of the eighth century before being retrojected into Prophetic hadith. In a later study, Leor Halevi diverged from Juynboll in arguing that &quot;niyāḥa&quot; was a genuine pre-Islamic practice as opposed to an Islamic-era creation, although Halevi agreed with Juynboll that it was not prohibited by Muhammad. Peter Webb&#x27;s most recent study agrees that it was a practice that occurred in pre-Islamic times due to its mention in pre-Islamic poetry, but he also argued that Islamic-era authors exaggerated the features of the custom and reshaped it into a quintessential trait of the &quot;Jahili&quot; past.

According to the Ibadi author Hūd ibn al-Muªakkam, the Jahiliyyah was characterized as a time that people forced their female slaves into prostitution so that she could have more children. Al-Qummī, a Shia, says that slaves were forced into prostitution for the profit of their master.

== Jahili poetry ==
Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry is called &quot;al-shiʿr al-Jāhilī&quot; (&quot;poetry from the Jahiliyyah&quot; or &quot;Jahili poetry&quot;). A large amount of this poetry was codified in Islamic times, and the Jahiliyyah was commonly characterized or received through this poetry. While historians doubt that the values of this poetry were representative of pre-Islamic values more broadly, the themes of Jahili poetry emphasize a heroic value system where the enjoyment of wine, amorous adventures, and fighting came together, as can be seen in the &quot;muʿallaqa&quot; of Ṭarafa:If you can’t avert from me the fate that surely awaits me / then pray leave me to hasten it on with what money I’ve got. / But for three things, that are the joy of a young fellow / I assure you I wouldn’t care when my deathbed visitors arrive— / first, to forestall my charming critics with a good swig of crimson wine / that foams when the water is mingled in; / second, to wheel at the call of the beleaguered a curved-shanked steed / streaking like the wolf of the thicket you’ve startled lapping the water; / and third, to curtail the day of showers, such an admirable season / dallying with a ripe wench under the pole-propped tent, / her anklets and her bracelets seemingly hung on the boughs / of a pliant, unriven gum-tree or a castor-shrub.According to Pamela Klasova, the values expressed should not be seen as &quot;values in themselves&quot;. That is, they are values invoked by the poet as a vehicle for the expression of the heroic refusal of the poet to surrender themselves to the power of unpredictable fate. When wine, fighting, and so forth are celebrated, these are acts of defiance against death. For the poet, death can come at any moment, and so the poet hastens death by behaving in a manner that is unrestrained. This perception of the world extends to other areas of the life of the poet, and so he acts with extreme generosity to others, even at the risk of the endangerment of one&#x27;s own life. After all, the poet sees death as inevitable and the only form of immortality achievable is through the memory of oneself after their death. This memory is perpetuated by the performance of heroic and honorable deeds. Wars were opportunities for one to set themselves apart from others by demonstrating their courage and achieving glory. Thus, poetry portrays war as something that occurs not merely out of necessity and material gain but also &quot;for the noble strife itself&quot;. Poetry centred the present, but in a manner that was motivated by a deeper existential framework as opposed to barbarism. Tradition depicted the poets as pagan, but the poetry itself lacks concern for religion.

Pre-Islamic poetry is not representative of the values of pre-Islamic Arabia (and likely was an expression of one cultural model among nomads and/or seminomads), but it came to be depicted in this way likely for two reasons: the scarcity of other pre-Islamic sources to have survived into the Islamic era, and deliberate reconstructions of the &quot;Jahiliyyah&quot;.

==Evolution of the Jahiliyyah narrative==

=== Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry ===
The term with the root &quot;j-h-l&quot; is cited several times in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, especially in the poetry of Imru&#x27; al-Qais and Al-Nabighah al-Dhubyani (where it is used eight and six times respectively). The meaning of the word in these poems is disputed. According to Ignaz Goldziher and Toshihiko Izutsu, the word meant &quot;barbarism&quot; and was used as an antonym (opposite) of &quot;ḥilm&quot; (forbearance, equanimity). Franz Rosenthal argued that it meant ignorance and was used as an opposite of &quot;ʿilm&quot; (religious knowledge). Peter Webb has accepted both of these definitions, finding different contexts in which each is the more appropriate definition.

=== Quran ===
The term &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; appears four times in the Quran (3:154, 5:50, 33:33, 48:26). In the Quran, the word is not used to refer to a historical epoch, but instead characterizes a way of life ascribed to the disbelievers who, in their ignorance, failed to acknowledge the message of Muhammad. For example, Muhammad emphasized the reward of the afterlife whereas those who rejected his message lacked a belief in an afterlife entirely. The use of the word &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; in Islamic literature from later centuries therefore diverged from the way that the word was used in the Quran in three key ways: (1) It came to refer to a historical epoch instead of a way of life or a moral state of being (2) It came to be used to refer to Arabs generally instead of Muhammad&#x27;s opponents (3) It came to be associated with a recurring set of particular negative stereotypes. The transformation of this term into a historical era may have been driven by Quran 33:33, which talks about former times in which &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; prevailed.

=== Classical Arabic dictionaries ===
Early Arabic dictionaries stressed two features of &quot;jahiliyyah&quot;: a specific period of time between two prophets (&quot;Al-Fatra&quot;, sometimes more narrow as the time between Jesus and Muhammad) and the opposition between &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; and &quot;ʿilm&quot;. These approaches are found in the earliest surviving Arabic dictionary, the &quot;Kitab al-&#x27;Ayn&quot; of Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi, as well as the dictionaries of Ibn Qutayba (d. 889) and Al-Azharī (d. 980). These sources do not confine the &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; to Arabia or attach particular disordered characteristics to it. For some, the word could also be used to refer to a future time of religious ignorance (especially the time leading up to the apocalypse) or it could be used to refer to a set of quantified time periods: for Al-Tabari in the tenth century, it denoted both Arabia before Muhammad and Israel before Jesus. In the twelfth century and on, a new style of definition is adopted for the &quot;jahiliyyah&quot;, as is seen by the works of al-Zamakhshari and al-Ḥimyarī. &quot;Jahiliyyah&quot; began to be used to describe the non-Islamic past in general instead of the time between prophets, especially one lacking in or in opposition to moral virtue. With the &quot;Lisān al-ʿArab&quot; of Ibn Manzur (d. 1312), the word is constricted to pre-Islamic Arabs in particular in addition to their negative moral characteristics. Ibn Manzur&#x27;s definition is the one found in dictionaries today.

=== Quran commentaries ===
The meaning of &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; experiences a similar evolution in exegeses of the Quran as they do in Arabic dictionaries. In the eighth-century commentary by Muqatil ibn Sulayman, the &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; describes the recent pre-Islamic past instead of pre-Islamic times in its entirety. In the commentaries of Al-Tabari, the word describes a period between prophets and the moral code of the non-Muslim community. The commentaries of Al-Zamakhshari and Al-Qurtubi in the twelfth and fourteenth centuries introduce the phrase &quot;al-Jahiliyyah&quot; understood as a period of time whose inhabitants were morally tarred by virtue of the era they lived in. Related phrases in this context included &quot;millat al-Jāhiliyya&quot; (the religious community of al-Jāhiliyya) and &quot;ahl al-Jāhiliyya&quot; (the people of al-Jāhiliyya). Both exegetes characterize &quot;Al-Jahiliyyah&quot; as the pre-Islamic past as a whole, and not the time between any two prophets. Al-Qurtubi expands on the qualities of this era such as fanaticism, idol worship, and rule by the strong over the weak.

=== Positive portrayals ===
A more optimistic version of the &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; narrative can be found among many authors in the second and third centuries of Islam during the early Abbasid period. In this period where Arab tribal identity continued to be important, many sought to extol their genealogical ancestors as opposed to denigrating them, as can be found with the Ma&#x27;add or South Arabian ancestries. For many, especially poets and philologists, the &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; was a heroic era that gave rise to both pure Arabic and pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, crafted by renowned poets such as Imru&#x27; al-Qais and others. Continuity is emphasized instead of discontinuity between Jahiliyyah and Islam, including in areas of religion. As such, pre-Islamic ethics are seen as praiseworthy, laudatory, and the basis of Arabness. Individuals (hanifs) or entire tribes maintained the monotheism introduced by Abraham or Ishmael, and rites such as the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) were maintained throughout this time period. Lists of the merits of the Arabs from this time period were written. The Musannaf of Ibn Abi Shaybah contains a mix of positive and negative hadith about the Jahiliyyah. Positive hadith condone various unique Jahili rituals and legal practices. Pre-Islamic or &quot;Jahili&quot; poets were described as being superior to contemporary poets (conversely, present-day poets were described as being inferior), and they were erected as the standards by which poets of the present day were compared to.

== Jahiliyyah concept in contemporary theology ==
During the 1930s, militant Islamist movements began to increasingly assert that Islamic civilisation was threatened by the encroachment of Western values. At this juncture, the concept of &quot;Jahiliyya&quot; was revived by leading Islamic scholars Sayyid Rashid Rida (d.1935 C.E/ 1354 A.H) and Abul A&#x27;la Maududi (d. 1979 C.E/ 1399 A.H); both of whom equated the modern Western culture and its values with &quot;Jahiliyya&quot;. The notion was revived by prominent scholars of the twentieth century Egypt and South Asia; regions that were being impacted by increasing Westernization. These scholars saw in the doctrines of classical theologians like Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328 C.E/ 728 A.H), Ibn Qayyim (d. 1350 C.E/ 751 A.H), Ibn Kathir (d. 1373 C.E/ 774 A.H), etc. various remedies to the influx of foreign cultural influences.

Syrian-Egyptian Salafi theologian Rashid Rida was the first major 20th-century Islamist scholar to revive Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s ideas. He described those &quot;geographical Muslims&quot; who nominally adhere to Islam without disavowing the man-made laws as being upon the conditioning of &quot;Jahiliyyah&quot;. Rida asserts in &quot;Tafsir al-Manar&quot; that the Qur’ānic verse 5:44 condemning those who don&#x27;t judge by Sharia (Islamic Law) refers to:&quot;.. those Muslim [rulers] who introduce novel laws today and forsake the Shari&#x27;a enjoined upon them by God. . . . They thus abolish supposedly &#x27;distasteful’ penalties such as cutting off the hands of thieves or stoning adulterers and prostitutes. They replace them by man-made laws and penalties. He who does that has undeniably become an infidel.&quot;

Abul Ala Maududi, characterized modernity with its values, lifestyles, and political norms as the &quot;new Jahiliyyah&quot; which was incompatible with Islam. Such criticisms of modernity were taken up in the emerging anti-colonialist rhetoric, and the term gained currency in the Arab world through translations of Maududi&#x27;s work. The concept of modern Jahiliyyah attained wide popularity through a 1950 work by Maududi&#x27;s student Abul Hasan Nadvi, titled &quot;What Did the World Lose Due to the Decline of Islam?&quot; Expounding Maududi&#x27;s views, Nadvi wrote that Muslims were to be held accountable for their predicament, because they came to rely on alien, un-Islamic institutions borrowed from the West.

In Egypt, Sayyid Qutb popularized the term in his influential work &quot;Ma&#x27;alim fi al-Tariq&quot; &quot;Milestones&quot;, which included the assertion that &quot;the Muslim community has been extinct for a few centuries.&quot;When a person embraced Islam during the time of the Prophet, he would immediately cut himself off from Jahiliyyah. When he stepped into the circle of Islam, he would start a new life, separating himself completely from his past life under ignorance of the Divine Law. He would look upon the deeds during his life of ignorance with mistrust and fear, with a feeling that these were impure and could not be tolerated in Islam! With this feeling, he would turn toward Islam for new guidance; and if at any time temptations overpowered him, or the old habits attracted him, or if he became lax in carrying out the injunctions of Islam, he would become restless with a sense of guilt and would feel the need to purify himself of what had happened, and would turn to the Quran to mold himself according to its guidance. — Sayyid Qutb

In his commentary on verse 5:50 of the Quran, Qutb wrote:

Qutb further wrote: &quot;The foremost duty of Islam in this world is to depose Jahiliyyah from the leadership of man, and to take the leadership into its own hands and enforce the particular way of life which is its permanent feature.

Use of the term for modern Muslim society is usually associated with Qutb&#x27;s other radical ideas (or Qutbism) -- namely that reappearance of &quot;Jahiliyya&quot; is a result of the lack of Sharia law, without which Islam cannot exist; that true Islam is a complete system with no room for any element of &quot;Jahiliyya&quot;; that all aspects of &quot;Jahiliyya&quot; (&quot;manners, ideas and concepts, rules and regulations, values and criteria&quot;) are &quot;evil and corrupt&quot;; that Western and Jewish conspiracies are constantly at work to destroy Islam, etc.

The Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir adds the concept of the caliphate to that of shariah law to insist that the Muslim world has been living in jahiliyya since the last caliphate was abolished in 1924 and will not be free of it until the caliphate is restored.

<text>The BMW M10 is a SOHC inline-4 petrol engine which was produced by BMW from 1962-1988. It was the company&#x27;s first four-cylinder engine since the BMW 309 ended production in 1936 and was introduced in the New Class sedans.

The M10 was used in many BMW models, with over 3.5 million being produced during its 26 year production run.

The turbocharged BMW M12 engine— used in the Formula One racing— was based on the M10 engine block and produced up to in qualifying trim.

Following the introduction of the BMW M40 engine in 1987, the M10 began to be phased out.

== Development ==
Baron Alex von Falkenhausen — an engineer and racing driver — designed the M10 in the late 1950s. He was asked by BMW to design an engine with a displacement of , but felt that this would be insufficient for the company&#x27;s future needs. He convinced management that the minimum capacity should be , and offered an engine that could be expanded to a maximum of .

== Design ==
The M10 has a cast iron block and an aluminum alloy head with hemispherical combustion chambers and two valves per cylinder. It features a forged crankshaft, counterbalance weights, five main bearings and a chain-driven camshaft.

The initial version of the M10 had a bore of and a stroke of , resulting in a displacement of . The peak power rating was .

== Naming conventions ==
The engine was initially known as the &quot;M115&quot; (the last two digits representing the 1.5–litre capacity). Over the years, variants of the engine were given various codes (most of them starting with &quot;M1&quot; and the remaining digits relating to the capacity). In 1975, the engine became known as then &quot;M10&quot;, then in 1980 it was given the standardised BMW engine code of M10B18 (where &quot;M10&quot; represents the series, B represents petrol (&quot;Benzin&quot; in German) and the &quot;18&quot; represented its then 1.8–litre capacity).

The M115 and all related engines have become retroactively known as the &quot;M10&quot; family.

<text>USS &quot;Nassau&quot; (LHA-4) was a . When active, she was capable of transporting more than 3,000 United States Navy and United States Marine Corps personnel. Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, laid the ship&#x27;s keel on 13 August 1973; she was commissioned on 28 July 1979. She was decommissioned on 31 March 2011.

==Description==

&quot;Nassau&quot; had 1,400 compartments, nine elevators and two horizontal conveyors. She also had two boilers – the largest ever manufactured for the United States Navy. They could generate 400 tons of steam per hour and develop . &quot;Nassau&quot;″s electrical power subsystem provided 14 MW electrical power. She had air conditioning equipment rated at a total of 1,500 tons (5.3 MW) and could ballast 12,000 tons of seawater for trimming the ship to receive and discharge landing craft from the well deck.

She was constructed with more than 20,000 tons of steel, 3,000 tons of aluminum, of cable and of pipe. She had a bow thruster for lateral movement at low speeds that could move the bow with 20,000 pounds of force (90 kN)—equivalent to half the pulling power of a diesel railroad locomotive. She had been fitted with a 300-bed hospital, four medical and three dental operating rooms. Her cargo areas were capable of holding tanks, trucks, artillery and large warfare supply needs.

==Operational history==

USS &quot;Nassau&quot; was commissioned at Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 28 July 1979. In October she deployed to reinforce Guantanamo base and earned the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation just 70 days after commissioning.

In April 1981 the ship was deployed to Mediterranean to meet US commitment to have two carriers there. She operated for ten consecutive weeks as an aircraft carrier, reinforcing Sixth Fleet carrier . Marine Attack Squadrons 231 and 542 formed Marine Air Group 32, equipped with AV-8A planes. It was the first time US Navy operated an amphibious ship as Harrier carrier.

&quot;Nassau&quot; was deployed to Beirut with the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit in February 1984, less than four months after the Beirut barracks bombing.

In support of Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm, &quot;Nassau&quot; deployed to the Middle East for over eight months on only eight days&#x27; notice. On leaving the United States, &quot;Nassau&quot; became the flagship for Commander, Amphibious Task Force and the 4th MEB&#x27;s Commanding General. In the last week of the war, she was employed as a &quot;Harrier Carrier&quot;, tasked with operating primarily as a STOVL attack carrier for Marine AV-8B Harrier II fighters.

&quot;Nassau&quot; participated in several more operations throughout the 1990s, including Operations Uphold Democracy, Deny Flight, Allied Force and Noble Anvil. These operations were in support of US foreign policy objectives; she also participated in numerous Navy and joint exercises that took her to numerous locations in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Adriatic regions, including Haiti, Spain, Morocco, Italy, France, Greece, Israel, Albania, Zaire and Kosovo.
&quot;Nassau&quot; received her first &quot;Battle Effectiveness &quot;E&quot; award&quot; in November 1983, with a second in 2007 – these awards are presented annually to ships that demonstrate the highest state of combat readiness in their group and their ability to execute their wartime tasks.

She deployed in February 2008 as the flagship of the &quot;Nassau&quot; Expeditionary Strike Group in support of Maritime Security Operations and Theater Security Cooperation efforts in the Navy&#x27;s 5th and 6th Fleet areas of responsibility.

In addition to her primary role as a Marine transport, &quot;Nassau&quot; has served as a flagship; a logistics hub for incoming and outgoing mail, cargo and other supplies; combat search and rescue and the tactical recovery and rescue of downed aircraft and personnel.

In July 2008, she had returned from deployment and was undergoing maintenance. At 4:30 pm Central Time on Thursday, 18 September 2008, KHOU News 11 in Houston, Texas announced that &quot;Nassau&quot; was coming to the aid of Galveston Island, following the landfall of Hurricane Ike. &quot;Nassau&quot; anchored offshore and troops deployed to the island with heavy machinery to aid with the clean-up of the devastation caused by the hurricane.

In January 2010, &quot;Nassau&quot; left her Virginia port carrying the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) on a routine deployment of approximately seven months. The 24th MEU, based at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, consists of a ground combat element, a battalion landing team, an aviation combat element, a logistics combat element and a command element.

&quot;Nassau&quot;, accompanied by and , comprised the &quot;Nassau&quot; Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), which supported maritime security operations and more in the 5th and 6th Fleet areas. The 5th Fleet covers the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Oman and parts of the Indian Ocean; the 6th Fleet encompasses the Mediterranean Sea.

&quot;Nassau&quot; was diverted to Haiti on 21 January 2010, to assist with the international humanitarian aid effort following the earthquake.

After completing its humanitarian efforts in Haiti, &quot;Nassau&quot; continued on its mission to the Middle East, eventually tying the all time Navy record of 159 consecutive days out to sea without a port call.

===Decommissioning===
&quot;Nassau&quot; was decommissioned in Norfolk, Virginia on 31 March 2011. She was moored in Beaumont, Texas, with the MARAD National Defense Reserve Fleet ships. Listed as &quot;Disposal&quot; status as of 31 March 2021.

In 2013 the non-profit organization Coalition of Hope announced plans to have the ship donated and operate her as a humanitarian vessel.

On 22 January 2019, H.R. 70, known as the &quot;FriendSHIP Act&quot;, was referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The Bill would authorize the president to transfer the decommissioned &quot;Nassau&quot; to Japan on a sale or grant basis.

On 30 April 2021 &quot;Nassau&quot; arrived at Brownsville, Texas for disposal via recycling. The process was expected to take 12 months.

<text>New Siberia or Novaya Sibir (; , , ; ) is the easternmost of the Anzhu Islands, the northern subgroup of the New Siberian Islands lying between the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea. Its area of approximately places it the 102nd largest islands in the world. New Siberia Island is low lying, rising to only and covered with tundra vegetation. The island is a part of the territory of Russia&#x27;s Sakha Republic.

==Geology==
New Siberia Island consists of clastic sediments ranging from Late Cretaceous to Pleistocene in age. The Late Cretaceous sediments consist of extensively folded layers of gray and greenish gray tuffaceous sand, tuffaceous silt, pebbly sand, and layers of brown coal exposed in sea cliffs along it southwest coast. The sand and silt often contain either volcanic glass, fossil plants, rhyolite pebbles, or some combination of them. Eocene sand, silt, clay, and brown coal overlies an erosional unconformity cut into the Late Cretaceous sediments. Within the northwest part of New Siberia Island, these sediments grade into clays that contain fragments of marine bivalves. Directly overlying the Eocene sediments and another erosional unconformity are sands of Oligocene and Early Miocene age. They contain thin beds of silt, mud, clay, and pebbles. These sands contain fossil plants and lagoonal, swamp, and lacustrine diatoms. These sands are overlain by Pliocene sediments consisting of layers of sand, silt, mud, peat, and pebbles.

Except for the Derevyannye Hills, Pleistocene sediments blanket almost the entire surface of New Siberia Island. These deposits consist of layers of marine sediments overlain by terrestrial sediments. The lower marine sediments are composed of three superimposed beds of marine to brackish water clay containing fossil mollusks and capped with peat. The overlying terrestrial sediments consist of an ice complex composed of ice-rich wind-blown silt in which ice wedges have developed. This ice complex accumulated over tens of thousands of years during the Late Pleistocene, through the Last Glacial Maximum, until it stopped at about 10,000 BP. During this period of tens of thousands of years, the formation of ice complex buried and preserved in permafrost an enormous number of mammoth tusks and bones and the bones of other “megafauna”.

New Siberia Island is noted for abundant upright tree trunks, logs, leaf prints, and other plant debris that occur within sediments that are exposed along sea cliffs and within the uplands of the Derevyannye Hills along its southern coast. 

Due to the abundance of exposed coalified logs and upright trunks, early explorers and paleobotanists referred to the Derevyannye Hills as either the &quot;Wood Mountains&quot;, &quot;Wood Hills&quot;, or &quot;Tree Mountain&quot;. At one time, the highly folded layers of sand, silt, mud, clay, and brown coal containing these coalified tree fossils were once thought to have accumulated during either the Miocene or Eocene Epoch. 

These sediments and the fossil trunks and logs, which they contain, are now known to date to the Late Cretaceous Period (Turonian Stage). Baron Von Toll, Dr. Klubov and others, Dr. Dorofeev and others, as well as other publications all demonstrate that the claims by some authors, i.e. Mr. Southall, that the &quot;Wood Hills&quot; of New Siberia Island are either partially or completely &quot;formed of driftwood&quot; are completely erroneous.

==Vegetation==
Rush/grass, forb, cryptogam tundra covers the New Siberia Island. It is tundra consisting mostly of very low-growing grasses, rushes, forbs, mosses, lichens, and liverworts. These plants either mostly or completely cover the surface of the ground. The soils are typically moist, fine-grained, and often hummocky.

==History==
Russian explorer Yakov Sannikov was the first recorded European to set foot on New Siberia Island, in 1806. He discovered it during one of several hunting expeditions financed by the father and son merchants, Semyon and Lev Syrovatsky ( and , and ).

<text>The BMW M20 is a SOHC straight-six petrol engine which was produced from 1977 to 1993. It was introduced eight years after the larger BMW M30 straight-six engine, which remained in production alongside the M20.

The first cars to use the M20 were the E12 5 Series and the E21 3 Series. The initial M20 model had a displacement of , with later versions having displacements of up to .

The M20 began to be phased out following the introduction of the M50 engine in 1990. The final M20 engines were fitted to the E30 3 Series wagon (estate) and convertible model built in April 1993.

The M20 was the basis for the BMW M21 diesel engine. It is also loosely related to the BMW M70 V12 petrol engine.

== History ==
By the 1970s, BMW felt the need for a six-cylinder engine smaller than the BMW M30, to use in the 3 Series and 5 Series. The resulting M20 had a displacement of , BMW&#x27;s smallest straight-six engine of its day. BMW presented the M20 engine at the 1977 IAA as a 90 kW 2.0-litre Solex 4A1 carburetted version, and as a 105 kW 2.3-litre K-Jetronic multi-point injected version. Later versions had displacements up to . The M20 was used in the E12 5 Series, E21 3 Series, E28 5 Series, E30 3 Series and E34 5 Series.

Early versions of the M20 were sometimes referred to as the &quot;M60&quot;, although the &quot;M60&quot; designation has since been re-used for a V8 engine produced from 1992 to 1996.

== Design ==
As per the M30, the M20 has an iron block, aluminium head and a SOHC valvetrain with 2 valves per cylinder. It has a traditional rocker arm design and no hydraulic tappets. The major differences to the M30 are:
* A timing belt rather than a timing chain
* Bore spacing of , rather than 
* Slant angle of 20 degrees, compared with 30 degrees for the M30.

==Models==

=== M20B20 ===

The first models to use the M20 were the E12 520/6 and the E21 320/6, which used a version known as the &quot;M20B20VE&quot; or &quot;M60/2&quot;. This engine uses a bore of and a stroke of . A Solex 4A1 four-barrel carburetor was used in the M20B20VE (&quot;VE&quot; is for &quot;vergaser&quot;- &quot;carburettor&quot; in German), and it has a compression ratio of 9.2:1 and a redline of 6,400 rpm.

The M20 first became fuel-injected in 1981, with Bosch K-Jetronic used in a version called the &quot;M20B20KE&quot;. The compression ratio was raised to 9.9:1.

In September 1982 (coinciding with the release of the E30 3 Series), the fuel injection was updated to LE-Jetronic with a redline of 6,200 rpm. Other upgrades included a larger port (known as &quot;731&quot;) cylinder head, a lighter block and new manifolds. The &quot;M60&quot; designation was dropped and this version was known as the &quot;M20B20LE&quot;.

In 1987, the M20B20 was again revised with the addition of Bosch Motronic engine management, a catalytic converter and a compression ratio of 8.8:1.

The M20B20 was not sold in the United States, but was available in the E30 (320i) in Canada.

Applications:
* 1977–1981 E12 5 Series 520/6 (carburettor)
* 1977–1982 E21 3 Series 320/6 (carburettor)
* 1981–1982 E28 5 Series 520i (K-Jetronic)
* 1982–1984 E28 5 Series 520i (L-Jetronic)
* 1982–1984 E30 3 Series 320i (L-Jetronic)
* 1984–1987 E28 5 Series 520i (LE-Jetronic)
* 1984–1987 E30 3 Series 320i (LE-Jetronic)
* 1986–1987 E28 5 Series 520i (Motronic)
* 1987–1992 E30 3 Series 320i (Motronic)
* 1988–1990 E34 5 Series 520i (Motronic)
* 1989–1992 Bertone Freeclimber (Freeclimber I)

=== M20B23 ===
In March 1978 (six months after the M20 was launched), a fuel-injected and larger displacement version known as the &quot;M20B23KE&quot; (or &quot;M60/5&quot;) was introduced. This version uses the same head (known as &quot;200&quot;) and block as the 2.0 litre version but a longer stroke crank. The bore is and it has a capacity of . Fuel injection was K-Jetronic, the compression ratio is 9.5:1, the power output is and the redline is 6,400 rpm.

The 1982 version used LE-Jetronic, the 731 cylinder head, a compression ratio of 9.8:1 and the other upgrades as the per the 2.0 litre version. This version is called the &quot;M20B23LE&quot; and has a power output of .

In September 1983, the M20B23LE&#x27;s fuel-injection, exhaust and camshaft were upgraded and power increased to with a redline of 6,500 rpm. The version continued to be available in certain markets with strict emissions regulations (such as Switzerland) until replaced by the 325i.

The M20B23 versions were not sold in North America.

Applications:
* 1977–1982 E21 3 Series 323i (K-Jetronic)
* 1982–1984 E30 3 Series 323i (L-Jetronic)
* 1984–1987 E30 3 Series 323i (LE-Jetronic)

=== M20B25 ===
In 1985, the M20B25 replaced the M20B23. The M20B25 has a capacity of and initially produced (without a catalytic converter). It has an upgraded cylinder head (known as &quot;885&quot;), a bore of , a stroke of , a compression ratio of 9.4:1, a redline of 6,500 rpm and uses Bosch Motronic 1.1 engine management.

In 1987, a catalyzed model with Motronic 1.3 engine management was introduced. The compression ratio was reduced to 8.8:1 but thanks to the more sophisticated electronics power remained nearly as before, at . The uncatalyzed engine was kept in production for Southern Europe and other markets where unleaded petrol was not regularly available.

Applications:
* 1985–1993 E30 3 Series 325i
* 1989–1990 E34 5 Series 525i
* 1988–1991 Z1

=== M20B27 ===
The M20B27 was designed for efficiency (thus the &quot;e&quot; for the Greek letter &quot;eta&quot; in &quot;325e&quot;) and low-rev torque. This is an unusual design strategy for a BMW straight-six engine, which are usually designed for power at high RPM. Compared with the M20B25, the stroke is increased from , resulting in a capacity of . Since many markets tax cars based on engine displacement, the eta&#x27;s larger displacement meant that it was not suitable for all markets. It was expressly developed with the American market in mind. As per the M20B25, the bore is . To reduce friction and improve efficiency, the M20B27 changes include using the &#x27;200&#x27; version of the head (which has smaller ports), a different camshaft, four camshaft journals and softer valve springs. Due to these changes the rev limit on the M20B27 was reduced to 4,800 rpm. The initial version, called the &quot;M20B27ME&quot;, produces and at 3,250 rpm for models without a catalytic converter. Models with a catalytic converter produce and .

In the United States, BMW&#x27;s corporate average fuel economy was at risk of not meeting requirements by 1984, primarily due to higher sales of their bigger, more expensive cars in the early 1980s. The first car to use the M20B27 was the US market 528e in 1982. The compression ratio of the U.S. M20B27ME version was 9.0:1, compared with for cars sold elsewhere 11.0:1.

In 1985, the &quot;M20B27ME.E&quot; version was introduced, increasing power output to despite a lower compression ratio of 10.3:1.

In late 1987, the fuel injection was upgraded to Motronic 1.3 on the US market plastic bumper 325e and 528e &#x27;Super Eta&#x27;, the cylinder head changed to the &quot;885&quot; version, the compression ratio was reduced to 8.5:1 and the redline increased to 5,200 rpm. Power output increased to at 4,800 rpm.

In the early 1990s BMW South Africa used components from the Alpina C3 2.7 to produce an E30 specifically for Stannic Group N production car racing. The first iteration of this engine used in the E30 325iS produced and the second revision, often referred to as &quot;Evo2&quot; or on the VIN plate as &quot;HP2&quot; produced .

Applications:
* 1982–1987 E30 3 Series 325e, 325e
* 1982–1988 E28 5 Series 525e (called 528e in North America)
* 1989–1992 E30 3 Series 325iS (only available in South Africa)
* 1989–1992 Bertone Freeclimber (Freeclimber I)

<text>The BMW M40 is an SOHC straight-four petrol engine which was produced from 1987–1994. It served as BMW&#x27;s base model four-cylinder engine and was produced alongside the higher performance BMW M42 DOHC four-cylinder engine from 1989 onwards.

Compared with its M10 predecessor, the M40 uses a belt-driven camshaft, and hydraulic tappets. Like the M10, the M40 uses an iron block and an aluminium head. Fuel injection for the E30 versions is Bosch Motronic 1.3, and the E36 versions use Bosch Motronic 1.7.

Following the introduction of the BMW M43 engine in 1991, the M40 began to be phased out.

<text>The BMW M42 is a DOHC straight-four petrol engine which was produced from 1989-1996. It is BMW&#x27;s first mass-production DOHC engine and was produced alongside the BMW M40 SOHC four-cylinder engine as the higher performance engine.

The M42 was replaced by the BMW M44, which was introduced in 1996.

Compared with the M40, the M42 features a DOHC valvetrain, a timing chain, hydraulic valve lifters and an increased 10.0:1 compression ratio. Later versions of the M42 also feature a dual length intake manifold (&quot;DISA&quot;).

The M42 was used as the basis for the S42 racing engine, which powered the BMW 320i in the German Super Tourenwagen Cup.

== Design ==
Following BMW&#x27;s typical construction techniques at the time, the motor incorporates a cast-iron block and aluminium head. Weight-saving measures include aluminium chain cases, oil sump, motor mount arms, accessory mounts and a cartridge-style oil filter housing. Other features included a forged steel crankshaft and tubular stainless steel exhaust manifold instead of the more typical cast-iron items. BMW also fitted hydraulic motor mounts to decrease the inline four&#x27;s inherent noise, vibration, and harshness compared to the smoother straight-six engines in production at that time.

When installed in the BMW E30, a two-piece oil pan with a removable front sump was fitted to the M42. In this two-piece arrangement, the upper oil pan casting incorporates the oil pump&#x27;s supply passage, and is sealed to the crankcase oil filter housing with a paper gasket. This can cause problems, because thermal cycles and engine vibration tend to loosen the upper pan mounting bolts inside the motor.

All versions featured a low-maintenance timing chain with a self-adjusting hydraulic chain tensioner and hydraulic valve tappets. From September 1993, the chain idler gear was replaced by a more reliable curved plastic guide, requiring a new design of front engine/chain casing. The M42 uses the Bosch Motronic M1.7 engine management system, eliminating a distributor in favor of fully electronic ignition timing. The ignition system also uses a coil-on-plug system. In markets that required emissions controls, the DME also incorporates an oxygen sensor and three-way catalytic converter.

From January 1995, the M42 (and all other BMW engines) received the EWS-II engine immobiliser with a revised ECU, a transponder chip in the ignition key, a plastic ring around the ignition lock (introduced with a new steering lock December 1994 in preparation) and an EWS transponder unit behind the glovebox. 

In the final versions of the M42, BMW engineered a dual length intake manifold (called &quot;DISA&quot; by BMW)

== Versions ==
=== M42B18 ===
The M42B18 has a displacement of , which is achieved through a bore of and a stroke of . Versions equipped with a catalytic converter produce and . and meet the Euro 2 emissions standard.

Applications:
* 1989–1991 E30 318is
* 1990–1992 E30 318i (only North American models)
* 1992–1995 E36 318i (only North American and South African models)
* 1991–1995 E36 318is
* 1994–1995 E36 318ti

===S42B20===
The racing version of the M42 engine is called the S42 and was used in BMW&#x27;s 320 4-door touring car, participating in the German Super Tourenwagen Cup. Compared with the M42, the S42 has individual throttle bodies, the displacement increased to , two fuel injectors per cylinder, an increased compression ratio and a different cylinder head. The valve cover and airbox were made from carbon fiber and the lubrication system used a dry sump.

In 1994, the initial version of the S42B20 engine produced . Outputs gradually increased to for the final version in 1997.

== Timing system revisions ==
The earliest versions of the M42 developed problems with the timing chain. The hydraulic tensioner, chain guides, idler wheel and rear lower chain case were updated to resolve wear problems experienced in the early versions of the M42. The updated cam chain tensioner is shared with that of the later M44 engine.

In September 1993, BMW redesigned the M42&#x27;s timing chain guide rails, replacing the occasionally troublesome lower idler gear with a curved nylon guide rail. The idler gear&#x27;s retaining bolt could break away from the timing case, often taking a chunk of alloy timing case with it.

== Recalls ==
Early models of the M42 experienced failures of a profile gasket sealing the lower cam chain case to the underside of the cylinder head. This gasket seals the primary coolant passage within the timing chain case. A significant failure would thus discharge pressurized steam and hot coolant into the timing chain case. In many cases this coolant rapidly contaminates the motor oil in the sump, causing main bearing failure. BMW updated the profile gasket material and instituted a program to repair motors under warranty. In extreme cases, the aluminum mating surfaces in the head and chain case would corrode.

<doc id="882087" wikidata="Q1061850" url="?curid=882087" title="Chang'an Avenue">
<text>Chang&#x27;an Avenue (), literally &quot;Eternal Peace Street&quot;, is a major thoroughfare in Beijing, China.

Chang&#x27;an () is also the old name for Xi&#x27;an which was the capital of China during the Western Han dynasty, the Tang dynasty and other periods. The Avenue has also been referred to as the Shili Changjie (), meaning the Ten Li Long Street, China&#x27;s No. 1 Avenue and No. 1 Avenue of the Divine Land. &quot;Chang&#x27;an Avenue&quot; is often used as a synecdoche for the government in Beijing, akin to using &quot;the Beltway&quot; to refer to the American federal government.

Chang&#x27;an Avenue starts from Dongdan in the east and ends at Xidan in the west. Tiananmen and Tiananmen Square are located at the north and south of the center of the Avenue, respectively. The Avenue consists of two parts, West Chang&#x27;an Avenue and East Chang&#x27;an Avenue. The extension line extends east–west with Tiananmen Square as the center, extends westward to Shougang area, Yongding River and Western Hills, and extends eastward to Beijing City Sub-center, Grand Canal and Chaobai River. The core area of Chang&#x27;an Avenue and its extension is between Guomao Bridge of East Third Ring Road and Xinxing Bridge of West Third Ring Road (including Tiananmen area).

==History==
The East and West Chang&#x27;an Streets were built as part of the Imperial City of Beijing. East Chang&#x27;an Street originally ran from the Left Chang&#x27;an Gate (on the east side of the square before Tian&#x27;anmen gate) to the Dongdan gate, and West Chang&#x27;an Street originally ran from the Right Chang&#x27;an Gate (on the west side of the same square) to the Xidan gate. The north side of the square, between the two Chang&#x27;an Gates, became a road after 1912 and was named &quot;Zhongshan Road&quot;, after Sun Yat-sen. In 1940, the Inner City wall was breached at Jianguomen and Fuxingmen respectively, due east and west of the ends of the East and West Chang&#x27;an Street. Streets extending from the ends of the two Chang&#x27;an Streets were widened to become Jianguomen Inner and Outer Streets and Fuxingmen Inner and Outer Streets. The two Chang&#x27;an Streets thus became part of a major thoroughfare into and out of the Inner City, now considered the &quot;extended&quot; Chang&#x27;an Avenue. The two Chang&#x27;an Gates were demolished in 1952 to expand Tiananmen Square, after which the two Chang&#x27;an Streets and Zhongshan Road were merged, becoming a singular &quot;Chang&#x27;an Avenue&quot;.

In 2009 the road was widened to 10 lanes, as part of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Significance==
Chang&#x27;an Avenue is the road directly before Tian&#x27;anmen gate and to the north of Tian&#x27;anmen Square. Because of its location, Chang&#x27;an Avenue has been associated with a number of important events in Chinese history, such as the Tian&#x27;anmen Square protests of 1989 (including the famous confrontation of the Tank Man), the May 4th Movement and the funeral procession of Zhou Enlai. During important celebrations in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, military parades are conducted on Chang&#x27;an Avenue, with the procession travelling from East to West along the avenue, passing before Tiananmen gate. For this reason, the avenue is surfaced with reinforced concrete, to prevent tanks and other heavy vehicles from damaging the surface.

Located along Chang&#x27;an Avenue and near Tian&#x27;anmen Square are the Great Hall of the People, Zhongnanhai, and central government buildings. The National Museum of China, National Centre for the Performing Arts, Wangfujing, Beijing Concert Hall and the headquarters of the central bank of China, the People&#x27;s Bank of China, and the Cultural Palace of Nationalities are also on Chang&#x27;an Avenue. Both the Beijing railway station and Beijing west railway station are located near Chang&#x27;an Avenue. Line 1 of the Beijing Subway runs under Chang&#x27;an Avenue.

Because of its sensitive location, special regulations apply to Chang&#x27;an Avenue. For example, trucks and freight vehicles are banned day and night, and no commercial advertising is allowed on the street.

<text>The BMW M44 is a DOHC four-cylinder petrol engine which replaced the BMW M42 and was produced from 1996 to 2000 at the Steyr factory. It was produced alongside the BMW M43 SOHC four-cylinder engine, with the M44 being the higher performance engine. In 2000, the M44 was replaced by the BMW N42 engine.

== Design ==
Compared with the M42, the M44 has roller rocker arms, a hot-wire MAF, displacement increased from and other detail changes such as a grey cast iron crankshaft replacing the forged steel item from the previous M42. As per the final versions of the M42, the M44 has a dual length intake manifold (&quot;DISA&quot;). Peak power is the same as the M42, however mid-range power is increased significantly and peak torque is increased by at 200 rpm lower. There was also a 70% reduction in valve train friction which contributed to the engine being more quiet and fuel efficient than its predecessor.

The M44 has a cast iron block and aluminium cylinder head, as per its predecessor.

== Versions ==
=== M44B19 ===

The M44B19 has a displacement of , which is achieved through a bore of and a stroke of . A compression ratio of 10.0:1 is used, along with the Bosch Motronic 5.2 engine management system.

The crankshaft has an increased stroke from the M42&#x27;s and is cast instead of forged. Also revised were the valve actuators which are of a roller pivoting arm type.

<text>The BMW M50 is a straight-6 DOHC petrol engine which was produced from 1990 to 1996. It was released in the E34 520i and 525i, to replace the M20 engine.

In September 1992, the M50 was upgraded to the M50TÜ (&quot;Technische Überarbeitung&quot;, &quot;technical revision&quot;). This was BMW&#x27;s first engine to use variable valve timing. Called single VANOS by BMW, the system adjusted the phasing of the intake camshaft.

The M50 began to be phased out following the introduction of the M52 engine in 1994.

The E36 M3 is powered by the S50 engine series, which is a high output version of the M50.

== Design ==

A significant advance over its M20 predecessor, the M50 features dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) with four valves per cylinder (the M20 has a single overhead camshaft with 2 valves per cylinder), coil-on-plug ignition, a knock sensor and a lightweight plastic intake manifold. Both engines use an iron block with an aluminum alloy head. The redline is 6,500 rpm for the M50B25 and 6,750 rpm for the M50B20 (7,000 rpm for S50 models), the same as the final version of the M20.

The location of the oil pan (sump) varies according to the model the M50 is installed in. It is in the front on the E34 5 Series (like the M20), whereas it is in the rear on the E36 3 Series.

== Models ==

The S50 is the high performance version of the M50 which was used in the E36 M3, replacing the four-cylinder BMW S14 engine used in the E30 M3. Like the M50, the S50 has an iron block and aluminum head with four valves per cylinder.

In the United States, a less powerful engine called the &quot;S50B30US&quot; was used, which shares more in common with the regular M50 engine than the other S50 versions.

=== S50B30 ===
The S50B30 was used in most countries, except for the United States. The S50B30 produces , has a bore of , a stroke of and a compression ratio of 10.8:1. The redline is 7,200 rpm. The S50 has an individual throttle body for each cylinder, single-VANOS (variable valve timing on the intake camshaft), Bosch Motronic M3.3 engine management and redesigned intake and exhaust systems.

The limited edition &quot;M3 GT&quot; model from 1995 produced . It had different camshafts and a redesigned sump and oil pump.

Applications:
* 1992-1995 E36 M3 (except for U.S.)

=== S50B30US ===
In the United States, the 1994-1995 model years of the E36 M3 are powered by the S50B30US, a engine which produces . This engine is more closely related to the standard M50 engine and has the same compression ratio as the M50B25TÜ, but uses a different camshafts, crankshaft, connecting rods, and pistons. The bore is , the stroke is and the redline is 7,000 rpm.

In 1996, the S50B30US was replaced by the BMW S52 engine (in the United States and Canada only).

Applications:
* 1994-1995 E36 M3 (U.S. only)

=== S50B32 ===
In 1995, the S50B32 replaced the S50B30 in world markets. Power output increased to and the displacement increased to , due to an increased stroke of and a slight increase in bore to .

The S50B32 has double-VANOS (variable valve timing on both camshafts) and a secondary oil pick-up was added. The compression ratio is 11.3:1 and the redline is 7,600 rpm. Engine management is the Siemens MSS50, with 3 knock sensors.

Applications:
* 1995-1999 BMW M3 (E36) (except Canada and the United States)
* 1996-2000 BMW M Coupé and M Roadster (except Canada and the United States)

<text>The BMW M52 is a straight-6 DOHC petrol engine which was produced from 1994 to 2000. It was released in the E36 320i, to replace the M50. The BMW S52 engine is a high performance variant of the M52 which powered the American and Canadian market E36 M3 from 1996 to 1999.

In 1998, the &quot;technical update&quot; (M52TU) upgrades included adding variable valve timing to the exhaust camshaft.

The M52 was replaced by the M54 in the year 2000. The M52 and S52 engines were on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list from 1997 to 2000.

== Design ==
In most markets, the M52 switched from the M50&#x27;s cast iron engine block to a lightweight aluminium engine block. Prior to 1999, M52 engines produced for the United States and Canadian markets (except for those used by the BMW Z3 roadster) retained the M50&#x27;s cast iron engine block. Beginning with the E46 in 1999, US cars used the new aluminum M52 block with iron sleeves.

The largest version of the M52 is 2.8 litres, compared with 2.5 litres for the M50. As per the later versions of the M50, the M52 uses variable valve timing on the intake camshaft (called &quot;single-VANOS&quot;). The redline remained at 6,500 rpm.

=== Technical Update versions ===
In 1998, the &quot;M52TÜ&quot; (&quot;Technical Update&quot;) was released, adding variable valve timing to the exhaust camshaft (called &quot;double VANOS&quot;). Other upgrades included a new design throttle body with the ASC (traction control) motor built in and throttle cable override, revised coolant passages with an additional drain back passage and a new cooling system with push fit hoses and a separate expansion tank plus a dual length intake manifold (called &quot;DISA&quot;) and steel cylinder liners (in the aluminum block) carried over from the previous M52, these replacing Nikasil in March 1998.

==Nikasil problems with high sulfur fuels==
The aluminum M52 engine received criticism in some markets with high levels of sulfur in the petrol during the late 1990s. Sulfur has a corrosive effect on Nikasil and led to many early M52 and M60 engines having premature bore-liner wear. Countries with high sulfur fuel (such as the United States) received an iron block version of the M52 (except for the M52B28 in the Z3 which was an aluminium block), so the Nikasil problem does not apply to most M52 engines in these countries.

Once the Nikasil coating was determined to be the cause of the problem, steel cylinder liners were used instead of the Nikasil coating. Therefore, the M52TU engine was not affected by the Nikasil problem.

== S52 ==
The S52 is a higher performance version of the M52, which replaced the S50B30US in the post-facelift (1996-1999) North American E36 M3.

Compared to the European-spec S50, the S52 is less powerful. The S52 also shares more in common with the regular M52 engine than the S50 did with the M50, for example sharing the engine block (cast iron, as per North American M52 engines) and cylinder head. Unique to the S52 is a bore of and stroke of for a total displacement of 3,152 cc. Compression ratio is 10.5:1. Other upgrades over the M52 include lighter camshafts (with increased lift and duration), valve springs and the exhaust system.

The S52 produces at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 3,800 rpm. The S52 has a redline of 7,000 rpm while the M52 has a 6,500 rpm redline.

Applications: 
* 1996–1999 E36 M3 (Canada and United States only) 
* 1998–2000 E36/7/8 Z3M (Canada and United States only)

<text>The BMW M88 is a straight-6 DOHC petrol engine which was produced from 1978 to 1989. It is based on the DOHC version of the BMW M49 engine, which was used in the BMW 3.0CSi racing cars.

The M88 was produced alongside the BMW M30 engine, as the higher performance engine. In North America up until 1989, the BMW S38 engine was used instead of the M88. In 1989, an updated version of the S38 became the worldwide replacement for the M88. The M30B35LE is a SOHC engine which is based on the M88/1; this is sometimes referred to as the M90.

==Design==
BMW engineers used a DOHC valvetrain on a production engine for the first time on the M88, with the camshafts driven by a single-row timing chain. Kugelfischer fuel injection was used with individual throttle valves and the distinctive six individual throttle bodies.

The construction is an aluminium cylinder head and a cast iron block. The bore is and the stroke is , resulting in a displacement of .

==Versions==
===M88===

The M88 was the original iteration of the engine and was fitted to the BMW M1. It produces at 6,500 rpm and at 5,500 rpm. A dry sump is used.

Applications:
* 1978-1981 M1

===M88/1===
For the BMW M1 Procar single-make series, the M88 engine was bored out marginally to reach . This racing version, called the M88/1, met the Group 4 regulations. This race engine produced in Procar specifications. This version had forged pistons, sharper camshafts, bigger valves, as well as oil cooling for the transmission and rear differential.

Applications:
* 1979-1980 Procar BMW M1

===M88/2===
For Group 5 racing, the M88 engine was turbocharged and became known as the M88/2. It was downsleeved and had a shorter stroke to displace , which with the 1.4 turbo factor placed it in the 4.5-liter class. This race engine produced up to .

Applications:
* Group 5 racing cars (BMW M1 Group 5 page)

===M88/3===

The M88/1 engine was modified for use in the E24 M635CSi and E28 M5 and was known as the M88/3. The Kugelfischer fuel injection was replaced with Bosch Motronic producing at 6,500 rpm and at 4,500 rpm. It has a compression ratio of 10.5:1.

The M88/3 was also fitted to the South African BMW 745i, due to packaging problems with the turbocharged M102 engine which was used in other markets.

Applications:
* 1983-1989 E24 M635CSi
* 1984-1987 E28 M5
* 1984-1987 E23 745i (South Africa only)

== M30B35LE==
The M30B35LE is a lower performance, two-valve, SOHC version of the M88/1 engine, also known as the M90. It utilizes the same block as the M88 and maintains the same bore and stroke, but borrows its head from the BMW M30 engine family. Depending on year, this engine uses either Bosch Motronic or Bosch L-Jetronic as its engine management system.
Typically identified by a white L painted on the block behind the oil filter housing and coolant water passages on the side of the block.

As sold in Europe and most other markets (except North America), this engine used a compression ratio of 9.3:1, did not have a catalytic converter, and produced .

Applications:
* 1979-1981 E12 M535i
* 1978-1982 E24 635CSi
* 1978-1982 E23 735i

<text>The BMW M70 is a naturally-aspirated, SOHC, V12 petrol engine, which was BMW&#x27;s first production V12 and was produced from 1987 to 1996. It was also the first German 12-cylinder post-war automobile engine, predating Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s M120 by four years and VAG&#x27;s W12 by fourteen.

The BMW S70/2 engine, largely unrelated to the M70 and S70B56 engines, is a naturally-aspirated, DOHC, V12 petrol engine, which powered the 1993 to 1998 McLaren F1.

==Design==
The M70&#x27;s design is similar to that of two 2.5 L M20 straight-six engines joined at a 60-degree angle, due to the following features: single overhead camshaft valvetrain, bore spacing of , bore of , stroke of , and a compression ratio of 8.8:1.

The M70 has the following differences with the M20 engine:
* Aluminium alloy engine block (AluSil) instead of cast-iron (both engines have an aluminium cylinder head), to reduce weight.
* Airflow measurement using Mass air flow sensors (MAFs) instead of Air flow meters (AFMs) to improve fuel economy.
* Electronic Throttle Control instead of a mechanical throttle cable.
* A timing chain was used instead of a timing belt, to reduce servicing requirements.
* Hydraulic valve lifters instead of mechanically adjusted tappets, to reduce servicing requirements.

The M70 has two Motronic 1.3 ECUs (one for each cylinder bank). To provide redundancy, the M70 also has two fuel pumps, fuel rails, distributors, mass air flow sensors, crankshaft position sensors, coolant temperature sensors and throttle bodies.

Some M70 engines (such as fitted to the E32 750iL Highline) are fitted with two alternators. The second alternator is smaller and is used to charge an auxiliary battery and power equipment in the rear passenger compartment, such as a telephone, fax machine, wine cooler, independent climate control and power sun shields.

== Versions ==

===M70B50===
Applications:
*1987–1994 E32 750i/750iL – this was mated primarily to an automatic ZF 4HP24 transmission
*1989–1994 E31 850i/850Ci – this was mated to either the automatic ZF 4HP24 transmission or the optional Getrag 560G
* 1988 Alpina B12
*1991 BMW Nazca M12
*1992 BMW Nazca C2

== S70 engine ==
===S70B56===
The first engine to use the S70 name is a variant of the M70 engine fitted only to the E31 850CSi. With 1,510 units produced, this is the lowest production BMW engine to date.

Three prototype dual overhead camshaft S70 engines were constructed, prior to the decision to not produce an E31 M8 model.

Applications:
* 1992–1996 E31 850CSi
* 1993 BMW Nazca C2 Spider
* 2011 Simbol Design Lavazza GTX-R (twin-turbo version)

===S70/2===
The S70/2, while sharing the same 12 cylinder layout, bore spacing and design principle as the S70B56, is essentially a new design with the heads based on the European market S50B30, and thus featuring 4 valves per cylinder and variable valve timing (called VANOS by BMW) and individual throttle bodies. A dry sump oiling system is used. The weight of the S70/2, plus ancillaries and full exhaust, is .

Applications:
* 1993–1998 McLaren F1

===S70/3===
The S70/3 is a racing engine based on the S70/2.

Applications
* 1998–1999 BMW V12 LM racing car
* 1999–2000 BMW V12 LMR racing car
* 2000 BMW X5 LM concept car

<text>The BMW M73 is a naturally-aspirated, single overhead camshaft (SOHC), V12 petrol engine which replaced the BMW M70 and was produced from 1993 to 2002. It was used in the BMW E38 7 Series, E31 8 Series and Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph.

==Design==
Compared with its M70 predecessor, the M73 features an updated roller-rocker valve-train and an increased displacement, due to a bore increase of ending with a cylinder bore of 85mm and a stroke increase of to have a final piston stroke of 79mm. While most other engines in the BMW range had switched to dual overhead camshafts with four valves per cylinder, the M73 used a single overhead camshaft and with two valves per cylinder. However, BMW engineers did create a prototype four-valve per cylinder V12, called the M72, which developed and of torque. However, this 48-valve engine did not fulfill the comfort demands of the large sedan class in all respects and, as a result, did not go into production.

These engines have two separate Bosch Motronic engine control units, which are connected to a third single Siemens control unit, called EML.
The engine utilizes four knock sensors mounted on the heads, a cam position sensor mounted on the right head and two crank sensors, one for each ECU. Throttle by wire is used. Similar to its predecessor, the M70, spark distributors are still present for each cylinder bank.

The hydrogen versions of the engine feature a formula_1 lean burn concept, which allows quality torque control similar to a Diesel engine (i. e. no engine throttling). Due to the lower LHV of a hydrogen-air mixture, and the fact that the engine was designed as a Bi-Fuel (petrol and hydrogen) engine, the power output is reduced by 38 per cent compared to the petrol only version of the engine.

== Models ==
===M73B54===
Applications:
* 1994-1998 E38 750i/750iL/L7
* 1994-1999 E31 850Ci

===M73TUB54===
Due to more stringent emissions standards, the 1999 model year marked the addition of an electronically heated catalyst, variable MAP thermostat, and water cooled alternator.

Applications:
* 1998-2001 E38 750i/750iL/L7/hL
* 1998 Cardi Curara
* 1999-2002 Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph
* 2009–2010 Simbol Design Lavazza GTX
* 2013 Monte Carlo Automobile Rascasse

=== M72B54 prototype===
In 1989, as part of a feasibility study, BMW&#x27;s engine development department produced a four-valve version of its V12 engine. Only one engine was produced, having an up-sized variant of the M70B50 engine called the M72B54. Bore and stroke was increased to 85mm and 79mm and the total displacement of 5.4L was achieved, matching the values of the standard M73 engine. The power and torque both increased to and respectively.

<text>BMW M62 is a naturally aspirated V8 petrol engine which was produced from 1995 to 2005. A successor to the BMW M60, the M62 features an aluminium engine block and a single row timing chain.

In 1998, a Technical Update included VANOS (variable valve timing) for the intake camshafts.

The S62 engine is the BMW M high performance version of the M62, which was released in the E39 M5, BMW Z8, Ascari KZ1, and the Ascari A10.

== Design ==
Like the BMW M60 engine it replaced, the M62 is a DOHC engine with four valves per cylinder, an aluminum block and aluminum heads. The M62 has fracture-split forged connecting rods, hypereutectic pistons with ferrous coated side skirts. Most of the M62 engines used Alusil for the block material, however some early M62 engines used Nikasil cylinder coating instead.

Alusil technology integrates silicon throughout the aluminum cast so that liners or treated bores within this block family are not needed.

The M62 uses a Bosch Motronic 5.2 engine control unit (also called &quot;DME&quot;) and a hot wire MAF.

=== Technical Update ===
In 1998, a &quot;Technical Update&quot; was applied to the M62, resulting in the M62TU variants. New features include single-VANOS (variable valve timing for the intake camshaft) and electronic throttle control. The engine management was updated to Motronic ME7.2.

==S62==
The BMW S62 engine (full model code &quot;S62B50&quot;) is the high-performance variant of the M62, which is fitted to the E39 M5 and the E52 Z8. The S62 was BMW&#x27;s first V8 engine to have double-VANOS (variable valve timing on the intake and exhaust camshafts).

The S62 engine produces at 6600 rpm and at 3800 rpm. The redline is 7000 rpm. The bore and stroke are and respectively. This results in a displacement of , compared with the of the largest M62 engine at the time.

Other differences compared to the M62 include:
* Individual throttle bodies for each of the eight cylinders, which are electronically actuated and have driver-selectable &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;sport&quot; mode throttle response.
* Compression ratio is 11.0:1, compared with 10.0:1 for the M62
* A double-row timing chain, compared with the single-row chain used by the M62
* Hollow camshafts. 
* Engine control unit is a Siemens MSS 52
* Dual air intakes and mass flow sensors
* A semi-dry sump oil system, consisting of two additional scavenging pumps which activates during hard cornering

Like the M62, the S62 has an aluminium block and head. The S62 was assembled at BMW&#x27;s Dingolfing plant.

<text>Dharavi is a residential area in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. It has often been considered to be one of the world&#x27;s largest slums. Dharavi has an area of just over and a population of about 1,000,000. With a population density of over , Dharavi is one of the most densely populated areas in the world.

The Dharavi slum was founded in 1884 during the British colonial era, and grew because the expulsion of factories and residents from the peninsular city centre by the colonial government and from the migration of rural Indians into urban Mumbai. For this reason, Dharavi is currently a highly diverse settlement religiously and ethnically.

Dharavi has an active informal economy in which numerous household enterprises employ many of the slum residents—leather, textiles and pottery products are among the goods made inside Dharavi. The total annual turnover has been estimated at over 1 billion.

Dharavi has suffered from many epidemics and other disasters, including a widespread plague in 1896 which killed over half of the population of Bombay. Sanitation in the slums remains poor.

==History==
In the 18th century, Dharavi was an island with a predominantly mangrove swamp. It was a sparsely populated village before the late 19th century, inhabited by Koli fishermen. Dharavi was then referred to as the village of Koliwada.

===Colonial era===
In the 1850s, after decades of urban growth under East India Company and British Raj, the city&#x27;s population reached half a million. The urban area then covered mostly the southern extension of Bombay peninsula, the population density was over 10 times higher than London at that time.
The most polluting industries were tanneries, and the first tannery moved from peninsular Bombay into Dharavi in 1887. People who worked with leather, typically a profession of lowest Hindu castes and of Muslim Indians, moved into Dharavi. Other early settlers included the Kumbhars, a large Gujarati community of potters. The colonial government granted them a 99-year land-lease in 1895. Rural migrants looking for jobs poured into Bombay, and its population soared past 1 million. Other artisans, like the embroidery workers from Uttar Pradesh, started the ready-made garments trade. These industries created jobs, labor moved in, but there was no government effort to plan or investment in any infrastructure in or near Dharavi. The living quarters and small scale factories grew haphazardly, without provision for sanitation, drains, safe drinking water, roads or other basic services. But some ethnic, caste and religious communities that settled in Dharavi at that time helped build the settlement of Dharavi by forming organizations and political parties, building school and temples, constructing homes and factories. Dharavi&#x27;s first mosque, Badi Masjid, started in 1887 and the oldest Hindu temple, Ganesh Mandir, was built in 1883 and organizing Ganesh Chaturthi of 112th year since 1913 folloing the Southern Tirunelveli Culture.

===Post-independence===
At India&#x27;s independence from colonial rule in 1947, Dharavi had grown to be the largest slum in Bombay and all of India. It still had a few empty spaces, which continued to serve as waste-dumping grounds for operators across the city. Bombay, meanwhile, continued to grow as a city. Soon Dharavi was surrounded by the city, and became a key hub for informal economy. Starting from the 1950s, proposals for Dharavi redevelopment plans periodically came out, but most of these plans failed because of lack of financial banking and/or political support. Dharavi&#x27;s Co-operative Housing Society was formed in the 1960s to uplift the lives of thousands of slum dwellers by the initiative of Shri. M.V. Duraiswamy, a well-known social worker and Congress leader of that region. The society promoted 338 flats and 97 shops and was named as Dr. Baliga Nagar. By the late 20th century, Dharavi occupied about , with an astounding population density of more than 2,900 people per hectare (1,200/acre).

=== Redevelopment plan ===

There have been many plans since 1997 to redevelop Dharavi like the former slums of Hong Kong such as Tai Hang. In 2004, the cost of redevelopment was estimated to be . Companies from around the world have bid to redevelop Dharavi, including Lehman Brothers, Dubai&#x27;s Limitless and Singapore&#x27;s Capitaland Ltd. In 2010, it was estimated to cost to redevelop.

The latest urban redevelopment plan proposed for the Dharavi area is managed by American-trained architect Mukesh Mehta. The plan involves the construction of of housing, schools, parks and roads to serve the 57,000 families residing in the area, along with of residential and commercial space for sale. There is still a significant local opposition to the plans, largely because existing residents still feel of revised permanent alternate accommodation per tenant is not adequate each. Furthermore, only those families who lived in the area before 2000 are slated for resettlement. Concerns have also been raised by residents who fear that some of their small businesses in the &quot;informal&quot; sector may not be relocated under the redevelopment plan. Due to this opposition, a trust has been proposed called the Dharavi Community Land Trust that will be made up of community members, landowners and neighborhood associations.

In 2008 German students Jens Kaercher and Lucas Schwind won a Next Generation prize for their innovative redevelopment strategy designed to protect the current residents from needing to relocate.

Other redevelopment schemes include the &quot;Dharavi Masterplan&quot; devised by British architectural and engineering firm Foster + Partners, that proposes &quot;double-height spaces that create an intricate vertical landscape and reflect the community&#x27;s way of life&quot; built-in phases that the firm says would &quot;eliminate the need for transit camps,&quot; instead catalyzing the rehabilitation of Dharavi &quot;from within.&quot;

A Dubai-based firm, SecLink Group, has planned to redevelop the slum into a completely new area. On setting up of the SPV, the private firm will have to bring in the equity of Rs 400 crore, while the state government will invest another Rs 100 crore. The company planning to do it is also building infrastructure and affordable housing projects in Singapore and Dubai. Following the empowered committee&#x27;s nod, the senior state officials said that an MoU will soon be executed between the state government, and the Dharavi Redevelopment Project Authority (DRPA) and the company. With an almost estimated cost of over Rs 26,000 crore, the Dharavi makeover project is the biggest brownfield redevelopment project in India. To make the redevelopment more economically viable, the state government&#x27;s plan is involving transforming the region into a hub for commercial and business activity. Dharavi is close to the Bandra Kurla Complex, which is India&#x27;s richest business district and one of the richest in Asia.

In the spring of 2023, it became known that the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani intends to do the reconstruction of Dharavi. Adani Properties Pvt. offers the largest amount of construction investments - 615 million dollars. Mumbai authorities estimate the total cost of the work at $2.4 billion.

As of April 2024, a survey is being conducted by Adani Group to rehabilitate Dharavi residents for redevelopment. On December 20, 2024, the High Count of Bombay awarded the Adani Group after the SecLink Group tried to sue.

==Demographics==
The total current population of the Dharavi slum is unknown because of fast changes in the population of migrant workers coming from neighbouring Gujarat state, though voter turnout for the 2019 Maharashtra state legislative assembly election was 119,092 (yielding a 60% rate). Some sources suggest it is 300,000 to about a million. With Dharavi spread over , it is also estimated to have a population density of 869,565 people per square mile. Among the people, about 20% work on animal skin production, tanneries and leather goods. Other artisans specialise in pottery work, textile goods manufacturing, retail and trade, distilleries and other caste professions – all of these as small-scale household operations. With a literacy rate of 69%, Dharavi is the most literate slum in India.

The western edge of Dharavi is where its original inhabitants, the Kolis, reside. Dharavi consists of various language speakers such as Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and many more. The slum residents are from all over India, people who migrated from rural regions of many different states.

About 29% of the population of Dharavi is Muslim. The Christian population is estimated to be about 6%, while the rest are predominantly Hindus with some Buddhists and other minority religions. The slum has numerous mosques, temples and churches to serve people of Hindu, Islam and Christian faiths, with Badi Masjid, a mosque, as the oldest religious structure in Dharavi.

==Location and characteristics==
Dharavi is a large area situated between Mumbai&#x27;s two main suburban railway lines, the Western and Central Railways. It is also adjacent to Mumbai Airport. To the west of Dharavi are Mahim and Bandra, and to the north lies the Mithi River. The Mithi River empties into the Arabian Sea through the Mahim Creek. The area of Antop Hill lies to the east while the locality called Matunga is located in the South. Due to its location and poor sewage and drainage systems, Dharavi particularly becomes vulnerable to floods during the wet season.

Dharavi is considered one of the largest slums in the world. The low-rise building style and narrow street structure of the area make Dharavi very cramped and confined. Like most slums, it is overpopulated.

==Economy==

In addition to the traditional pottery and textile industries in Dharavi, there is an increasingly large recycling industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of Mumbai. Recycling in Dharavi is reported to employ approximately 250,000 people. While recycling is a major industry in the neighborhood, it is also reported to be a source of heavy pollution in the area. The district has an estimated 5,000 businesses and 15,000 single-room factories. Two major suburban railways feed into Dharavi, making it an important commuting station for people in the area going to and from work.

Dharavi exports goods around the world. Often these consist of various leather products, jewellery, various accessories, and textiles. Markets for Dharavi&#x27;s goods include stores in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. The total (and largely informal economy) turnover is estimated to be between 500 million, and 650 million per year, to over 1 billion per year. The per capita income of the residents, depending on estimated population range of 300,000 to about 1 million, ranges between US$500 and US$2,000 per year.

A few travel operators offer guided tours through Dharavi, showing the industrial and the residential part of Dharavi and explaining about the problems and challenges Dharavi is facing. These tours give a deeper insight into a slum in general and Dharavi in particular.

== Utility services ==
Potable water is supplied by the MCGM to Dharavi and the whole of Mumbai. However, a large amount of water is lost due to water thefts, illegal connection and leakage. The community also has a number of water wells that are sources of non-potable water.

Cooking gas is supplied in the form of liquefied petroleum gas cylinders sold by state-owned oil companies, as well as through piped natural gas supplied by Mahanagar Gas Limited.

There are settlement houses that still do not have legal connections to the utility service and thus rely on illegal connection to the water and power supply which means a water and power shortage for the residents in Dharavi.

===Sanitation issues===
Dharavi has severe problems with public health. Water access derives from public standpipes stationed throughout the slum. Additionally, with the limited lavatories they have, they are extremely filthy and broken down to the point of being unsafe. Mahim Creek is a local river that is widely used by local residents for urination and defecation causing the spread of contagious diseases. The open sewers in the city drain to the creek causing a spike in water pollutants, septic conditions, and foul odours. Due to the air pollutants, diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and asthma are common among residents. There are government proposals in regards to improving Dharavi&#x27;s sanitation issues. The residents have a section where they wash their clothes in water that people defecate in. This spreads the amount of disease as doctors have to deal with over 4,000 cases of typhoid a day. In a 2006 Human Development Report by the UN, they estimated there was an average of 1 toilet for every 1,440 people.

==Epidemics and other disasters==
Dharavi has experienced a long history of epidemics and natural disasters, sometimes with significant loss of lives. The first plague to devastate Dharavi, along with other settlements of Mumbai, happened in 1896, when nearly half of the population died. A series of plagues and other epidemics continued to affect Dharavi, and Mumbai in general, for the next 25 years, with high rates of mortality. Dysentery epidemics have been common throughout the years and explained by the high population density of Dharavi. Other reported epidemics include typhoid, cholera, leprosy, amoebiasis and polio. For example, in 1986, a cholera epidemic was reported, where most patients were children of Dharavi. Typical patients to arrive in hospitals were in late and critical care condition, and the mortality rates were abnormally high. In recent years, cases of drug resistant tuberculosis have been reported in Dharavi.

Fires and other disasters are common. For example, in January 2013, a fire destroyed many slum properties and caused injuries. In 2005, massive floods caused deaths and extensive property damage.

The COVID-19 pandemic also affected the slum. The first case was reported in April 2020.

==In the media==

In the West, Dharavi was most notably used as the backdrop in the British film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008). It has also been depicted in a number of Indian films, including &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975), &quot;Nayakan&quot; (1987), &quot;Salaam Bombay!&quot; (1988), &quot;Parinda&quot; (1989), &quot;Dharavi&quot; (1991), &quot;Bombay&quot; (1995), Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s &quot;Indian Gangster Trilogy&quot; (1998–2005), the &quot;Sarkar&quot; series (2005–2017), &quot;Footpath&quot; (2003), &quot;Black Friday&quot; (2004), &quot;Mumbai Xpress&quot; (2005), &quot;No Smoking&quot; (2007), &quot;Traffic Signal&quot; (2007), &quot;Aamir&quot; (2008), &quot;Mankatha&quot; (2011), &quot;Thalaivaa&quot; (2013), &quot;Bhoothnath Returns&quot; (2014), &quot;Kaala&quot; (2018) and &quot;Gully Boy&quot; (2019).

&quot;Dharavi, Slum for Sale&quot; (2009) by Lutz Konermann and Rob Appleby is a German documentary. In a programme aired in the United Kingdom in January 2010, Kevin McCloud and Channel 4 aired a two-part series titled &quot;Slumming It&quot; which centered around Dharavi and its inhabitants. The poem &quot;Blessing&quot; by Imtiaz Dharker is about Dharavi not having enough water. &quot;For The Win&quot;, by Cory Doctorow, is partially set in Dharavi. In 2014, Belgian researcher Katrien Vankrunkelsven made a 22-minute film on Dharavi which is entitled &quot;The Way of Dharavi&quot;.

Hitman 2, a video game released in 2018, featured the slums of Mumbai in one of its missions.
The Mumbai based video game Mumbai Gullies is expected to feature the slums of Dharavi in the fictional map.

<doc id="882119" wikidata="Q1133772" url="?curid=882119" title="Napoleon Dynamite">
<text>Napoleon Dynamite is a 2004 American independent coming-of-age comedy film produced by Jeremy Coon, Chris Wyatt, and Sean Covel, written by Jared and Jerusha Hess, and directed by Jared Hess. The film stars Jon Heder in the role of the titular character, a nerdy high-school student who deals with several dilemmas: befriending an immigrant who wants to be class president, awkwardly pursuing a romance with a fellow student, and living with his quirky family.

The film was Hess&#x27;s first full-length movie and is partially adapted from his earlier short film, &quot;Peluca&quot; (2002). &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; was acquired at the Sundance Film Festival by Fox Searchlight Pictures, which partnered with Paramount Pictures and MTV Films for the release. It was filmed at Preston High School (Idaho) and different areas in Franklin County, Idaho, in the summer of 2003. It debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. Most of the situations in the movie are loosely based on the life of Jared Hess. The film&#x27;s total worldwide gross revenue was $46.1 million. The film has since developed a cult following and was voted number 14 on Bravo&#x27;s 100 funniest movies.

==Plot==
Socially awkward 16-year-old Napoleon Dynamite lives in Preston, Idaho, with his grandmother, Carlinda, and his technology-addicted older brother, Kip. Napoleon&#x27;s school days are spent doodling mythical creatures, dealing with bullies, and playing tetherball by himself.

Carlinda is injured in a quad bike accident and asks Napoleon and Kip&#x27;s Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Flirtatious, middle-aged Rico arrives in the camper van he lives in, and teams up with Kip to sell items door-to-door in a get-rich-quick scheme. Kip wants to pay for his internet girlfriend, LaFawnduh, to visit from Detroit. Former high-school athlete Rico dwells on his past and dreams of going back in time. He believes wealth will help him get over his breakup with his girlfriend and failed dreams of NFL stardom.

Napoleon becomes friends with Deb, a shy girl who sells headshots and knick-knacks to raise money for college, and Pedro, a bold transfer student from Juárez, Mexico. Pedro is rebuffed when he asks the popular and snobby Summer Wheatly to accompany him to the high school dance. Deb gladly accepts. Pedro encourages Napoleon to find a date and he picks popular classmate Trisha. As a gift, he draws an (unintentionally bad) picture of her and delivers it to Trisha&#x27;s mother, one of Rico&#x27;s customers. Rico tells Trisha&#x27;s mother embarrassing stories about Napoleon to evoke sympathy. She buys his wares and forces Trisha to accept Napoleon&#x27;s invitation. Trisha goes to the dance with Napoleon but abandons him to hang out with Summer. Pedro allows Napoleon to dance with Deb.

Pedro runs against Summer for class president. The two factions put up flyers and hand out trinkets to attract voters. To demonstrate their &quot;skills&quot; and increase their respect around the school, Napoleon and Pedro enter a Future Farmers of America competition, grading milk and cow udders. They win medals, but it does little for their popularity.

Napoleon buys an instructional dance videotape. Kip&#x27;s girlfriend, LaFawnduh, arrives and gives him an urban makeover, outfitting him in hip-hop regalia. Seeing that Napoleon is learning to dance, LaFawnduh gives him a mixtape.

Rico continues to spread embarrassing rumors about Napoleon to prospective customers. He tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon&#x27;s suggestion, causing her to break off their friendship. Napoleon confronts Rico and tells him to leave, but Rico refuses. His sales scheme ends when martial arts instructor Rex walks in on Rico demonstrating the breast-enhancement product on his wife, and assaults him.

On Election Day, Summer gives a speech before the student body, and presents a dance skit to &quot;Larger than Life&quot; by the Backstreet Boys. Pedro gives a despondent speech after discovering he is also required to perform a skit. Napoleon gives the sound engineer LaFawnduh&#x27;s mixtape and spontaneously performs a dance routine to &quot;Canned Heat&quot; by Jamiroquai as Pedro&#x27;s skit. Napoleon&#x27;s routine receives a standing ovation, stunning Summer and her boyfriend, Don.

Pedro becomes class president, Grandma returns from the hospital, Rico reunites with his girlfriend, Kip and LaFawnduh leave on a bus for Michigan, and Napoleon and Deb reconcile and play tetherball together.

Two months later, Kip and LaFawnduh get married, and Napoleon arrives late at the wedding on a stallion which he tamed for Kip and LaFawnduh to ride out on.

==Production==
===Origin===
In 2002, Brigham Young University film students Jon Heder and Jared Hess collaborated on a class project; the result was a 9-minute short movie shot on black-and-white 16mm film entitled &quot;Peluca&quot; about a nerdy high school student named Seth.

&quot;Peluca&quot; was shown at the 2003 Slamdance Film Festival and was well received. Jeremy Coon convinced Hess to drop out of school and adapt it into a feature-length film, and he helped him to find investors for the project. Hess sent the short film and the script to a variety of different casting directors, many of whom thought that the idea was &quot;too weird or they just didn&#x27;t like the character,&quot; Hess explained. One casting director suggested Jake Gyllenhaal over unknown actor Jon Heder for the lead role but Hess believed Heder was the only actor to play the part. Jason Lee was offered the role of Uncle Rico while Brad Garrett auditioned for Rex and enjoyed the script, but decided not to commit. Actor Vincent Gallo was also considered and almost cast as Uncle Rico. Heder was paid $1,000 for starring in the film, but successfully negotiated to receive more after the film became a runaway success.

=== Filming and setting ===

Hess shot the film on location in Preston, in southeastern Idaho, located near the Utah border, in July 2003. Operating on a tight budget of $400,000, Hess cast many of his friends from school, including Heder and Aaron Ruell, and he relied on the generosity of Preston locals, who provided housing and food to crew members. Among the established actors in the cast was comedy veteran Diedrich Bader, who filmed his scenes as virile martial art instructor Rex in one day. He recalled in 2011 that &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; &quot;still to this day [is] one of the two top scripts I&#x27;ve ever read&quot;, alongside &quot;Office Space&quot; (1999), one of his most-recognized roles. &quot;It was very, very hot,&quot; Hess recalled in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview. &quot;But it was so much fun being in this rural farm town making a movie. We shot it in 23 days, so we were moving very, very fast; I just didn&#x27;t have a lot of film to be able to do a lot of takes. It was a bunch of friends getting together to make a movie. It was like, &#x27;Are people going to get this? Is it working?&#x27;&quot;
Hess describes the film as being &quot;so autobiographical&quot;. &quot;I grew up in a family of six boys in Preston, Idaho, and the character of Napoleon was a hybrid of all the most nerdy and awkward parts of me and my brothers growing up. Jerusha really was like Deb growing up. Her mom made her a dress when she was going to a middle school dance and she said, &#x27;I hadn&#x27;t really developed yet, so my mom overcompensated and made some very large, fluffy shoulders.&#x27; Some guy dancing with her patted the sleeves and actually said, &#x27;I like your sleeves ... they&#x27;re real big,&quot;&#x27; Hess said in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

The film is set during the 2004–2005 school year, as shown on Napoleon&#x27;s student ID card in the title sequence. The film contains several culturally retroactive elements harkening back between the 1970s to 1990s. For example, Deb wears a side ponytail and Napoleon wears Moon Boots, both popular fashion trends of the 1980s. One scene is set at a school dance that plays only 1980s music such as Alphaville&#x27;s &quot;Forever Young,&quot; whereas an earlier scene features students performing a sign language rendition of &quot;The Rose&quot; (1980), originally made popular by Bette Midler (it was actually sung in the film by L.A.-based studio session vocalist Darci Monet, who was never credited or paid any residuals for her work). Much of the technology in the film is also archaic; Napoleon uses a top-loader VCR and Walkman cassette player, Kip connects to the Internet via a pay-per-minute dial-up connection and Uncle Rico drives a 1975 Dodge Tradesman. The song Napoleon Dynamite dances to at the end of the film—&quot;Canned Heat&quot; by Jamiroquai—came out in 1999.

===Opening sequence===
The film was originally made without opening titles. Audiences at test screenings were confused about when the film was set. Eight months after the film was completed, the title sequence was filmed in cinematographer Munn Powell&#x27;s basement. Ruell, who played Kip, suggested the idea of the title sequence. The sequence shows a pair of hands placing and removing several objects on a table. Objects like plates of food had the credits written in condiments, while other objects like a Lemonheads box or a tube of ChapStick had the credits printed on them. Hess explains:

On the studio&#x27;s reaction to the sequence, Hess adds:
===Dance scene===
The Hesses wrote the climactic dance scene because they knew Heder liked to dance. &quot;Jared&#x27;s wife was like, &#x27;Jon, I hear you&#x27;re pretty good dancer. I&#x27;ve seen you boogie; it&#x27;s pretty sweet,&#x27;&quot; recalled Heder. &quot;And I was like, &#x27;Well, I like to dabble.&#x27; I liked to mess around sometimes in front of friends and dance. But I did take pride in it. I won&#x27;t be modest. I wasn&#x27;t great but I did like to mess around ... Cut to two years later: after we had shot the short, they were like, &#x27;Okay we&#x27;re going to have you dancing in the movie as the climax. This is going to make or break the film.&#x27;&quot;

When it came to shooting the dance scene for the final film, the producers scheduled to film it towards the end of the film. When they finally got to the scene, they were running out of money and film. They only had one roll of film (approximately 10.5 minutes) left to shoot.

&quot;It was a lot of pressure,&quot; Heder observed. &quot;I was like, &#x27;Oh, crap!&#x27; This isn&#x27;t just a silly little scene. This is the moment where everything comes, and he&#x27;s making the sacrifice for his friend. That&#x27;s the whole theme of the movie. Everything leads up to this. Napoleon&#x27;s been this loser. This has to be the moment where he lands a victory. He gets up there, and it&#x27;s quiet: no reaction from the audience.&quot;

The dance was spontaneously improvised by Heder, with some choreography help from Tina Majorino, and additional moves taken from &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, Michael Jackson, and &quot;Soul Train&quot;. &quot;They were like, &#x27;No, Jon, just figure it out.&#x27; So I just winged it. I danced three times and they took the best pieces from each of those.&quot;

&quot;When you&#x27;re shooting in independent film, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re going to get the rights to,&quot; Heder explained. &quot;We thought Jamiroquai might be expensive. So we danced to three different songs. To that song and another Jamiroquai song, &quot;Little L.&quot; We danced to Michael Jackson, something off of &quot;Off the Wall&quot;. Just those three. And then we got the rights to Jamiroquai. And I think that was half our budget.&quot;

===Origin of the name &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;===
Upon the film&#x27;s release, it was noted that the name &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; had originally been used by musician Elvis Costello, most visibly on his 1986 album &quot;Blood &amp; Chocolate&quot;, although he had used the pseudonym on a single B-side as early as 1982. Filmmaker Jared Hess remarks that he was unaware of Costello&#x27;s use of the name until two days before the end of shooting, when he was informed by a teenage extra. He later said, &quot;Had I known that name was used by anybody else prior to shooting the whole film, it definitely would have been changed ... I listen to hip-hop, dude. It&#x27;s a pretty embarrassing coincidence.&quot; Hess claims that &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; was the name of a man he met around 2000 on the streets of Cicero, Illinois, while doing missionary work for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Costello believes that Hess got the name from him, whether directly or indirectly. Costello said, &quot;The guy just denies completely that I made the name up ... but I invented it. Maybe somebody told him the name and he truly feels that he came to it by chance. But it&#x27;s two words that you&#x27;re never going to hear together.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 17, 2004, where it was picked up by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Shortly after, Fox collaborated with Paramount Pictures and MTV Films to release the film, with Fox handling North American distribution, and Paramount and MTV distributing internationally. The film was theatrically released in the United States on June 11, 2004.

===Anniversary screenings and 4K restoration===
On June 9, 2014, the film was screened at Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles to celebrate its 10th anniversary. In addition, a bronze statue of Napoleon Dynamite, complete with tetherball, was placed at the 20th Century Fox studio lot.

A 20th anniversary screening of the film took place at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2024, to commemorate the festival&#x27;s 20th anniversary, in the form of a new 4K restoration from the original 35mm negative produced by Searchlight Pictures and its parent company Walt Disney Studios, under the supervision of Hess. On the announcement, he remarked &quot;Returning to Sundance with &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; feels like a homecoming. When it premiered at the festival 20 years ago, we never anticipated the incredible reaction it would receive ... It&#x27;s always been a very personal film for Jerusha and me, so the love affair it&#x27;s had with audiences all these years continues to delight us. To commemorate its 20th anniversary, we are thrilled to screen this newly restored version ... The restoration team did an amazing job bringing to life new details from the original film&#x27;s negative that we&#x27;d never seen before. We can&#x27;t wait to share it!&quot;

The director and several cast members attended the Sundance screening in Park City, Utah. Efren Ramirez reprised part of Pedro&#x27;s speech at the student assembly by saying, &quot;I really don&#x27;t have much to say. Have a happy Sundance.&quot;

===Home media===
&quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on December 21, 2004, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in North America and by Paramount Home Entertainment in all other territories. The DVD is a double-sided disc containing full screen and letterbox versions of the film, plus &quot;Peluca&quot; and deleted scenes—all with audio commentary. A 2-disc edition (dubbed &quot;Like, the Best Special Edition, Ever!&quot;) was released in 2006 with additional deleted scenes, promotional material and a second commentary track, but fell out of print in favor of the first edition DVD and the Blu-Ray.

The &quot;10th Anniversary Edition&quot; Blu-ray was released on June 2, 2014. A digital release of the 4K screening of the film is also currently available to purchase and stream.

===Lawsuit against Fox Searchlight Pictures===
On August 30, 2011, the film&#x27;s production company Napoleon Pictures filed a lawsuit against Fox Searchlight Pictures for $10 million for underreporting royalties and taking improper revenue deductions. In its term sheet, Fox agreed to pay 31.66% of net profits on home video. The lawsuit said that a 2008 audit revealed that Fox was only paying net royalties on home videos at a 9.66% rate, and there were underreported royalties and improper deductions.

Napoleon Pictures also alleged that Fox had breached the agreement in multiple other respects, including underreporting pay television license fees, failing to report electronic sell-through revenue, charging residuals on home video sales, as well as overcharging residuals on home video sales, deducting a number of costs and charges Fox had no right to deduct and/or for which there is no supporting documentation.

In May 2012, Fox went to trial after failing to win a summary judgment on the case. The trial began on June 19, 2012. On November 28, 2012, a 74-page decision sided with Fox on 9 of the 11 issues. Napoleon Pictures was awarded $150,000 based on Fox accounting irregularities.

==Reception==

===Box office===
Despite a very limited initial release, &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; was a commercial success. It was filmed on an estimated budget of a mere $400,000, and less than a year after its release, it had grossed $44,940,956.
It also spawned a slew of merchandise, from refrigerator magnets to T-shirts and Halloween costumes.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 72% of 175 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.40/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;A charming, quirky, and often funny comedy.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine complimented the film, saying, &quot;Hess and his terrific cast – Heder is geek perfection – make their own kind of deadpan hilarity. You&#x27;ll laugh till it hurts. Sweet.&quot; The &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; called the film &quot;a refreshing new take on the overused teen-comedy genre&quot; and said that the film &quot;may not make you laugh out loud – it&#x27;s too sly and subtle for that – but it will have you smiling every minute, and often grinning widely at its weirded-out charm.&quot;

Michael Atkinson of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; praised the film as &quot;an epic, magisterially observed pastiche on all-American geekhood, flooring the competition with a petulant shove.&quot; In a mixed review, &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Heder&#x27;s performance and the &quot;film&#x27;s most interesting quality, which is its stubborn, confident, altogether weird individuality&quot;, while criticizing the film&#x27;s resolution that comes &quot;too easily.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one-and-a-half stars, writing that he felt that &quot;the movie makes no attempt to make [Napoleon] likable&quot; and that it contained &quot;a kind of studied stupidity that sometimes passes as humor&quot;. At the time, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critics gave it a grade C and C− respectively. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; later ranked Napoleon #88 on its 2010 list of The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years, saying, &quot;A high school misfit found a sweet spot, tapping into our inner dork.&quot; The film was on several year-end lists. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 22 of the 25 Top DVDs of 2004.

===Awards===
* Best Feature Film at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival the same year. The film&#x27;s budget was only $400,000. When the film rights were sold to a major distributor, Fox Searchlight Pictures, Fox supplied additional funds for the post-credits scene.
* In 2005, the film – itself an MTV Films production – won three MTV Movie Awards, for Breakthrough Male Performance, Best Musical Performance, and Best Movie. The film is #14 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;.
* It won the 2005 Golden Trailer Awards for Best Comedy.
* It won the 2005 Golden Satellite Award for Best Original Score (John Swihart).
* Four awards at the Teen Choice Awards. Choice Movie: Female Breakout Star for Haylie Duff, Choice Movie: Dance Scene, Choice Movie: Hissy Fit for Jon Heder, and Choice Movie: Comedy.
* The 2004 Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Feature
* April 2005, the Idaho Legislature approved a resolution commending the filmmakers for producing &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;, specifically enumerating the benefits the movie has brought to Idaho, as well as for showcasing various aspects of Idaho&#x27;s culture and economy.

==Future==
===Possible sequel===
After nearly two decades of rumors, it was reported in September 2020, that a sequel to &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; was in discussion. Heder stated that he is interested in a darker take on the film&#x27;s characters instead of rehashing the original film&#x27;s plot:
Ramirez improvised a script for a sequel in which Pedro is married to Summer Wheatly, has five kids and owns a bakery. In the same hypothetical script, Kip has fulfilled his dream to become a cage fighter, while Rico has ventured into a new business that he believes will make him rich.

In January 2023, Heder stated that he believed a sequel was &quot;inevitable&quot; and reiterated his interest in displaying a darker tone for the sequel. In October 2024, he stated once again that a sequel was possible, saying &quot;that the door&#x27;s not closed yet.&quot;

===Animated series===

In April 2010, Fox announced that an animated series was in development, with the original cast reprising their roles. The series debuted on Sunday, January 15, 2012. Director Jared Hess, his co-screenwriter wife Jerusha, and Mike Scully produced the show in association with 20th Century Fox Television. On May 14, 2012, it was announced that Fox had canceled the series after 6 episodes. The complete series was released on DVD on November 4, 2014, by Olive Films.

===Related appearances===
The 2010 film &quot;When in Rome&quot; features Jon Heder portraying Lance, a street magician who attempts to impress the film&#x27;s protagonist Beth, played by Kristen Bell. In one scene, Lance introduces her to his assistant Juan, played by Efren Ramirez, reuniting the actors.

In 2016, Burger King brought back the cheesy tots menu item. This was followed by an ad featuring Heder and Ramirez as patrons with Ramirez having bought the item and Heder listlessly asking if he can have one, only to grab the whole lot and shove them into his pants.

For the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Ore-Ida produced a new commercial with Heder fully reprising the role of Napoleon Dynamite, now promoting &quot;tot-protecting&quot; pants.

==Legacy==

The term &quot;The Napoleon Dynamite Problem&quot; has been used to describe the phenomenon where &quot;quirky&quot; films such as &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; (2003) and &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004) prove difficult for researchers to create algorithms that are able to predict whether or not a particular viewer will like the film based on their ratings of previously viewed films.

For several years the city of Preston held a &quot;Napoleon Dynamite Festival&quot; in the summer. Many of the featured festival themes related to events occurring during the film. For example: Tetherball Tournament, Tater Tot Eating Contest, Moon Boot Dance, Impersonation, Look-A-Like Contest, Football Throwing Contest and more. Fifteen years after the film came out fans continue to visit Preston, primarily as a side trip as they make their way to Yellowstone National Park.

The success of &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; led to other films set in small towns, such as &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; (2006) and &quot;Juno&quot; (2007), which would have similar critical, popular, and financial success.

<doc id="882120" wikidata="Q123011" url="?curid=882120" title="BMW S38">
<text>The BMW S38 is a straight-6 DOHC petrol engine which replaced the M88 and was produced from 1984–1995. The S38 was originally produced for North America as an equivalent to the M88 with slightly lower power output. In 1989, power output of the S38 was increased and it became the worldwide replacement for the M88.

In 1998, the BMW M5 switched to the S62 V8 engine. There is therefore no direct successor to the S38, however the BMW S50 engine took over as BMW&#x27;s high performance straight-6 engine.

== Design ==
The S38 is based on the M88/3 engine. Compared to the M88/3, the S38 has a lower compression ratio (9.8:1), simplified exhaust manifold, catalytic converter, dual-row timing chain and a shorter camshaft duration. As per the M88/3, the S38 uses a DOHC valvetrain with shim-and-bucket valve actuation. Air intake is via six individual throttle bodies with intake trumpets, fed by a cast aluminum intake plenum.
== Versions ==
===S38B35===
The initial version of the S38 has a bore of and a stroke of .

Applications:
* 1986–1987 E28 M5 - Canada, Japan and US
* 1986–1988 E24 M6 - Canada, Japan and US
* 1987–1989 E24 M635CSi - models with catalytic converter

===S38B36===
For the S38B36, the displacement was increased to . This was achieved by increasing the stroke by to , by using a new forged steel crankshaft. Other changes included revised camshafts, compression ratio increasing to 10:1, a variable-length inlet manifold (to improve low-rev torque), equal length stainless steel exhaust headers a hotwire mass airflow sensor (MAF) and Bosch Motronic engine management.

Applications:
* 1988–1992 E34 M5 (worldwide)
* 1989–1993 E34 M5 - Canada and US

===S38B38===
In late 1991, BMW further enlarged the S38 engine to , by increasing the bore to and the stroke to . Power increased to at 6,900 rpm and torque increased to at 4,750 rpm.

The engine management was upgraded to Motronic 3.3 and the ignition system was upgraded to coil-on-plug ignition. Other changes included the compression ratio increasing to 10.5:1, a dual-mass flywheel, an exhaust manifold made of Inconel, larger intake and exhaust valves, lighter pistons, and the throttle bodies increasing by to .

Applications:

<text>The Cadet Instructors Cadre (CIC; ) consists of approximately 7,500 Canadian Forces (CF) training officers. The branch is the largest single group within the Canadian Forces reserve force subcomponent Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service (COATS) and is the largest officer branch in the Canadian Forces. The COATS subcomponent of the Reserve Force employs members from all branches and occupations of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force of the Canadian Forces.

Cadets are youth 12 to 18 years of age, and participate in 1,150 Sea and Army Cadet Corps and Air Cadet Squadrons located across Canada.

According to Canadian Forces Chief of Review Services, about 45% of all CIC branch personnel have former Regular Force or Primary Reserve service. Some are former cadets who wish to continue their involvement in the Canadian Cadet Organizations: the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets, Royal Canadian Army Cadets, and Royal Canadian Air Cadets. Others are recruited from the general population.

<text>Independent Operational Group [[Polesie]] (&quot;Samodzielna Grupa Operacyjna Polesie&quot;, SGO Polesie) was one of the Polish Army Corps (Operational Groups) that defended Poland during the Invasion of Poland in 1939. It was created on 11 September 1939 and was commanded by general Franciszek Kleeberg. The SGO is most notable for fighting in the battle of Kock, the last battle of the Invasion of Poland.

==Tasks==

The SGO was created on the orders of the Polish Commander in Chief on 9 and 11 September due to German breakthroughs and was tasked with defending the region of Polesie (see also Polesie Voivodeship), defined by the lines of Muchawiec and Prypeć rivers, with the towns of Brześć (Brest) and Pińsk (where the SGO HQ was located). The SGO was to prevent Polish forces in central Poland from being encircled from the east.

==Operational history==
From 14 September the units of the SGO faced the German XIX Panzer Corps under Heinz Guderian. The forces under general Konstanty Plisowski defended the town of Brześć (Brest) from 16 to 19 September while the forces under colonel Adam Epler defended Kobryń from 16 to 18 September.

After the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, Kleeberg at first followed orders from Polish High Command and retreated towards the Romanian border (see Romanian Bridgehead). On 22 September, cut off from his superiors, he decided to aid besieged Warsaw. As they were running low on supplies, Kleeberg decided to recapture the town of Dęblin, where the Polish Army had large stores of supplies.
On 28 September Warsaw capitulated; Kleeberg - at that time having crossed the Bug river near Włodawa - decided that the units would advance west and organize large scale partisan warfare from local forest complexes near Świętokrzyskie Mountains. In the days of 29–30 September the units were engaged by the Soviet Red Army but were able to defeat them. From 2 October the SGO, at that point the last organized regular unit of the Polish Army, fought against the German forces of XIV Mechanized Corps in the battle of Kock. Despite immense German numerical superiority, the Polish forces were able to score several tactical victories; however they were increasingly running low on supplies, including ammunition. Hence on 5 October Kleeberg decided to capitulate; the fighting ended in the early hours of October 6. He was the last Polish general to capitulate in the Polish Defensive War; he is also considered one of the few Polish generals of the September 1939 campaign to have not been defeated in battle (along with Gen. Maczek).

Not all of the Polesie Group soldiers capitulated; many dispersed and continued guerrilla warfare, most notably major Henryk Dobrzański and his Detached Unit of the Polish Army, which is credited with being the first Polish partisan unit and was active until the spring of 1940.

==Organization==

The SGO was commanded by general Franciszek Kleeberg, his chief of staff was colonel M. Łapicki. Kleeberg was tasked with organizing his group from various small units in the Polesie region; most of them were either reserve and mobilizing or second line such as the National Defense units; the notable exception were the elite Border Protection Corps (KOP) units and the Riverine Flotilla of the Polish Navy.

On 14 September, when the group was engaged by German forces, it was composed of:
* &quot;Kobryń Group&quot; (seven infantry battalions) - under col. Adam Epler
* &quot;Brześć Group&quot; (five infantry battalions, two light tank companies, two armored trains under gen. Konstanty Plisowski
* &quot;Drohiczyn Poleski Group&quot; (three infantry battalions) - under col. Kazimierz Gorzkowski
* &quot;Jasiołda Group&quot; (one infantry battalion) - under mjr Ludwik Rau
*Riverine Flotilla of the Polish Navy

Over the next two weeks the group sustained casualties but it was also reinforced by various units from the disintegrating Polish army, including defenders of the Sarny Fortified Area. The total strength of the SGO was 18,000 soldiers.

On 29 September, after reorganization, the group was composed of:
*Polish 50th Infantry Division (reserve, later nicknamed &quot;Brzoza&quot; after its commander) under col. Ottokar Brzoza-Brzezina
*Polish 60th Infantry Division (reserve, later nicknamed &quot;Kobryń&quot;) under col. Adam Epler
*Improvised Cavalry Division &quot;Zaza&quot; (pl) (improvised, nicknamed &quot;Zaza&quot;) under gen. Zygmunt Podhorski (mostly based on Podlaska Cavalry Brigade and Suwalska Cavalry Brigade from Independent Operational Group Narew)

==Notes==
a Stanisław Maczek, another Polish commander with the reputation of being undefeated, was promoted from colonel to general in November 1939 after his 10. Cavalry Brigade AKA &quot;Die Schwarze Brigade&quot; – &quot;The Black Brigade&quot;, a fully motorized and mechanized unit, outperformed any other such unit (including tank brigades) in the Polish military. The unit was recreated in France in 1940 and fought in 1944 and 1945 alongside the British (Polish Armed Forces in the West).

<doc id="882134" wikidata="Q2932681" url="?curid=882134" title="Royal Canadian Sea Cadets">
<text>The Royal Canadian Sea Cadets (RCSC; ) is a Canadian national youth program sponsored by the Canadian Armed Forces and the civilian Navy League of Canada. Administered by the Canadian Forces, the program is funded through the Department of National Defence, with the civilian partner providing support in the local community. Cadets are not members of the Canadian Armed Forces.

==Overview==

Along with the Royal Canadian Army Cadets and Royal Canadian Air Cadets, the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets form part of the Canadian Cadet Organizations. Although the RCSCC and the other cadet programs are sponsored by the Canadian Forces and the civilian Leagues, cadets are not members of the Forces and are not expected to join. In keeping with Commonwealth custom, the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets stand first in the order of precedence, before the Army Cadets and Air Cadets. This is in keeping with the Royal Navy&#x27;s status as the Senior Service, a tradition common to most Commonwealth navies.

An inclusive program, youth aged 12 to 18 may join the RCSCC. There is no enrollment fee, and uniforms are loaned at no charge. The organization and rank system is similar to that of the Royal Canadian Navy. Adult leadership is provided by members of the Canadian Forces Reserve Subcomponent Cadet Organization Administration and Training Service, composed mostly of officers of the Cadet Instructor Cadre (CIC) Branch, supplemented, if necessary, by contracted Civilian Instructors, authorized adult volunteers, and, on occasion, officers and non-commissioned members of other CF branches. The CIC Branch is specifically trained to serve the Royal Canadian Sea, Army, and Air Cadet training programs, and like all reservists, they come from all walks of life and all parts of the community. Some are former cadets, and many have former regular or reserve force service.

===Aim===
The aim of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets is to develop in youth the attributes of good citizenship and leadership; promote physical fitness, and stimulate the interest of youth in the sea, land and air activities of the Canadian Forces. The RCSC shares this aim with the Army and Air Cadets; however, each discipline focuses on its own parent element.

==History==

===Early days===
In 1895, due to concern over the Royal Navy&#x27;s ability to provide adequate naval defence, concerned citizens formed the Navy League, to promote interest in the problems of maritime trade and defence.

The League formed local branches throughout the United Kingdom and in other countries of the British Empire. The earliest Canadian branch was formed in Toronto. Its warrant (Warrant No. 5) is dated December 10, 1895, and currently hangs in the Navy League of Canada&#x27;s National Office.

At that time, Canadian branches supported a cadet program called the Boys’ Naval Brigades, aimed at encouraging young men to consider a seafaring career and provide basic training in citizenship and seamanship.

===Evolution===
With the formation of the Canadian Naval Service in May 1910, the organisation was renamed from &quot;Boys’ Naval Brigade&quot; to &quot;Navy League Sea Cadets,&quot; to permit closer liaison with the Navy. In 1942, King George VI graciously consented to be Admiral of the Navy League&#x27;s Sea Cadets, and granted the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix, causing another name change, to the current &quot;Royal Canadian Sea Cadets.&quot; Queen Elizabeth continued this Royal patronage and named His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh as the Admiral of the RCSC. Finally, in 1941, the RCN became a joint partner with the Navy League in support of the RCSC.

===Girls===
In 1950, the Navy League of Canada established the Wrenette program for girls aged 13 to 18 years, though at least one corps (in Victoria, British Columbia) unofficially existed before that date. Starting in 1975, girls were permitted to become sea cadets (as well as army and air cadets), making the Wrenette Corps largely redundant. As a result, the Wrenette program steadily declined until it was disbanded in 1997.

===Memorial===
At the Royal Military College of Canada, outside Currie Hall in Kingston, Ontario, stained glass windows relate to the history of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets. 
* Donated as a tribute to all national presidents of the Navy League of Canada for the proven love of country in promoting patriotism... seapower ... youth training, the window bestows &#x27;Honour and Glory to patriotic citizens who have and will serve Canada.&#x27; The window features images of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets, Navy League Cadets and Navy League Wrenettes.
* In memory of David H. Gibson, C.B.E. national president, Navy League of Canada, 1938–1952 a stained glass window features images of a young sailor and God behind the ships&#x27; wheel. The window is dedicated to Canadians who in defence of the country went down to the sea in ships. The window includes a poem by H.R. Gillarm: &quot;Proudly in ships they sailed to sea. Ahead their goal, perhaps eternity. But with God as their pilot they had no fear facing all danger as their course was clear. Their cargo? The record of their life. Some good, some bad, some peace, some strife.&quot;

===Navy League today===
In 1995, the Navy League of Canada celebrated its 100th anniversary. The League promotes the same subjects today, as at its founding: knowledge of, and support for, maritime interests. On a national level, the League supports the International Exchange Program, certain scholarships, and the National Sea Cadet Regatta, while local branches provide vital logistical support to individual RCSC Corps.

==Corps==

Individual cadets belong to units called Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps (RCSCC), or Corps de cadet de la Marine royale canadienne (CCMRC), which are the basic operating units of the program. Each corps consists of officers from the Cadet Instructors Cadre (CIC) Branch of the Canadian Armed Forces, Civilian Instructors (CI), Civilian Volunteers (CV), volunteer Regular/ Primary Reserve Force members, and cadets.

The entirety of a given corps organizes itself as a ship&#x27;s company, employing the naval divisional system. Under this system, cadets become members of a division under a cadet petty officer (Divisional Petty Officer or DPO) and a CIC officer (Divisional Officer or DivO), although the officer position is sometimes filled by a Civilian instructor or Volunteer. Cadets parade by divisions, and are expected to route grievances and requests through the chain of command, running either directly from the DPO to DivO to the executive officer (XO) to the commanding officer (CO) or from the DPO to the cadet Regulating Petty Officer (RPO, the second senior cadet in the unit), to the cadet coxswain (cox&#x27;n, the senior cadet in a unit). The chain stops at the level able to deal with a concern – for example, a cadet&#x27;s request for a new item of uniform might result in the DivO giving approval, and directing the cadet to visit Stores.

Sea Cadet Units also house key departments such as Training, Administration, and Supply. These departments are normally operated under the direction of a CIC officer but can also be operated by a Civilian Instructor, possibly with an assistant adult staff member, and a senior cadet. Units may also house teams such as Range (Marksmanship/Biathlon), Band, and Drill.Larger units may have dedicated staff for each of the teams.

Units generally adhere to the school schedule, meeting weekly for mandatory training, and carrying out additional training on weekends and other weeknights. The primary meeting is referred to as a parade/training night while training/activities conducted on weekends or on other weeknights are referred to by the activity/training occurring.

===Key Departments===

* The Training Department comprises the Training Officer (TrgO), Training Chief or Petty Officer (Trg CPO/PO), and a staff of senior cadets and adult staff, often with other duties within the unit, serving as instructors. The Trg CPO/PO is often responsible for maintaining each cadets&#x27; training record, as well as handling resources and rating instructors.
* The Administration Department comprises the Administration Officer (AdmO) and Administration Chief or Petty Officer (Adm CPO/PO), who wears the quill-pen and scroll badge of a Ship&#x27;s Writer, and may be referred to as such. Administration handles all incoming and outgoing mail, as well as maintaining corps records other than those specifically handled by Training or Supply.
* The Supply (or Stores) Department is composed of a Supply (or Stores) Officer, sometimes assisted by a senior cadet, who is entitled to wear the crossed-keys badge of a Storekeeper. The Supply Department is responsible for all equipment belonging to the corps; however, Supply tends to be primarily concerned with issuing cadets uniforms and related gear – bands often deal with their own gear, as do competitive teams.

===Sponsoring group===
* Along with the Army Cadets and Air Cadets, the Sea Cadets make up a program sponsored by the Canadian Forces funded primarily through the Department of National Defence. The Canadian Forces provides training, pay and allowances for reserve force cadet instructors; uniforms for instructors and cadets; transportation, facilities and staff for summer training; the training program and training aids; and policy and regulation regarding the operation of the cadet organization.
* The primary local community sponsor for Sea Cadets is a local branch of the Navy League of Canada that is often a committee of parents supported by groups such as Royal Canadian Legion branch, or some similar service club; i.e. Lions, Rotary, etc. The civilian Navy League provides local support by way of accommodation, utilities, liability insurance, transportation and training aids not provided by the CF. Navy League branches rely on community support, in the form of direct donations of money and goods, trusts, and various forms of fund-raising efforts. These last include sale of various items, much like bake and chocolate bar sales, street-corner pin and tag sales by cadets, and funds raised through the attached cadet unit&#x27;s own canteen.
** Canteen: Operated by the local sponsoring group with proceeds for corps activities, the canteen typically sells pop, chips, and the like at breaks in training. Some also offer cadets various necessities such as thread, boot polish, and starch. More ambitious corps canteens offer unit clothing, typically sweatshirts, T-shirts, belt buckles, etc., suitably emblazoned with unit insignia, mottos, and the like.

==Training and ranks==

=== Ranks ===
In accordance with QR and O Cadets 4.11 the following are the rank badges of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets:
In addition to the rank-specific criteria given below, all appointments are subject to the approval of the cadet&#x27;s commanding officer, who generally promotes based on the advice of Divisional Officers and unit training staff.

As a note, the official phrasing for the Petty Officer and Chief Petty Officer ranks is &quot;Petty Officer Cadet First (or Second) Class,&quot; and &quot;Chief Petty Officer Cadet First (or Second) Class.&quot; However, outside of Cadet Administrative and Training Orders (CATO), and Queen&#x27;s Regulations and Orders (Cadets) (QR&amp;O(Cdt)), custom omits &quot;Cadet&quot; in casual reference. Thus, Petty Officer First Class is the customary rendering. Generally, where there is a need to distinguish between cadets and Canadian Forces members, the NCO ranks will be written or spoken as Cadet Petty Officer First Class, abbreviated as C/PO1. 
Additionally, while it is customary within the organisation to refer to a cadet receiving a rank as being &quot;promoted,&quot; the official documentation refers to such an act as an &quot;appointment.&quot;


==== Forms of address ====
* Junior cadets are typically addressed by their last name by all ranks; however, a superior might address them as simply &quot;cadet,&quot; especially in situations where names are not known, such as at multi-unit events.
* Petty officers are typically addressed by their juniors as &quot;Petty Officer So-and-So,&quot; or, conversationally, as &quot;P.O.&quot; Superiors and equals will often use last name only, sometimes prefacing it with &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Miss.&quot;
* Chief petty officers are typically addressed by all personnel as &quot;Chief So-and-So,&quot; or, conversationally, as &quot;chief.&quot; Superiors and equals will rarely use last name only, though superiors might replace &quot;chief&quot; with &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Miss.&quot;
* Additionally, cadets often hold an appointment in addition to their rank, and many of these are used as an alternate form of address, especially the following: coxswain (cox&#x27;n); corps gunner, chief gunner, or gunner&#x27;s mate (&quot;gunner&quot;), drum major (&quot;drum major&quot; or &quot;drummie&quot;); bugler; messenger; and boatswain, boatswain&#x27;s mate, chief boatswain&#x27;s mate, and chief boatswain (&quot;bosun&quot; or &quot;buffer&quot;).
* In formal situations (for example, being called up for an award or promotion), a cadet&#x27;s full rank and last name is used &quot;Cadet (rank) name.&quot;

=== Training ===

==== Additional Training ====
Along with their mandatory weekly training, sea cadets may also participate in one or more of the teams below:

*Range Team: Most units will have at least one trained Range Safety Officer (RSO) and conduct, as part of the mandatory training programme, training in safe and effective marksmanship using the Daisy Air Rifle. A number of corps field range teams, competing in cadet tri-service matches at the area, regional, and national level, while others simply offer a well-supervised recreational shooting program.
**Firearm safety is given the highest priority throughout this training.
* Biathlon: An increasing number of RCSC Corps have formed biathlon teams, adding a new aspect to the long-standing marksmanship programs, and encouraging a high degree of athleticism and physical fitness. Ideally, cadets train and compete with Anschutz .22 target rifles; however, some corps train with air rifles in accordance with Olympic marksmanship standards.
** Firearm safety is given the highest priority throughout this training as well.
* Sail: The RCSC sailing program uses Canadian Yachting Association levels and material for all training. The Sailing program uses small dinghies, typically Echo- or 420-class vessels, although other comparable designs are used, including Lasers, the Olympic-class 470, Flying Juniors, as well as the older Albacores. At the corps level, the sailing program is often conducted in two parts: on-ground classes during a training night/sail weekend as well as on the water experience with Sail instructors during a sailing weekend. Sail Instructors are typically CIC officers / Civilian Instructors who are members of the Area Sail Center. The Area Sail Center consists of a Coordinating Officer, several Canadian Yachting Association (CYA) certified Head Instructors and volunteer staff cadet instructors. Advanced training focus on competitive sailing and race organization and is normally done at a CTC during the summer.
* Band: Most units will try to support some sort of musical ensemble, whether drum and bugle, drum and bell (glockenspiel), a military band, or just a drum line. A few corps have a piper or two, while an even smaller group maintain pipe bands.
* Guard/ Honour Guard: Many units have a division called &quot;Guard&quot;. The Guard is a division where anyone from the rank of AB and up can join. Most units carry the Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk. 1 Long-Branch Rifle and wear webbing. The Guard Commander usually carries a cutlass in lieu of a rifle. The Guard normally parades after the Flag Party in ceremonies.

==== Summer training ====
Cadet Training Centres (CTC), provide additional training intended to support or complement that offered at the home unit from September to June. Across the board, cadets applying for summer training must have 75% attendance over the training year, as well as meeting certain course prerequisites.

Cadet Training Centers are staffed by members of the Canadian Forces, primarily members of the CIC, but also including other branches of the CF, as well as Civilian Instructors and senior cadets selected for employment as staff cadets. Sea Cadet STCs are commanded by a CIC officer of the rank of commander. Staff cadets are employed at the ranks of Petty Officer Second Class through Chief Petty Officer First Class, with a CPO1 being appointed as Cadet Cox&#x27;n. Staff cadets are paid at a daily fixed rate for the duration of their time as a Staff Cadet.

Sea Cadet CTCs are commissioned as &quot;stone frigates,&quot; which is to say, naval shore establishments granted much the same standing as a seagoing unit.

===== Current Sea Cadet Training Centres (CTC) =====
* CTC , located in Comox, British Columbia, has operated as a Sea Cadet training facility since 1953. It was commissioned in 1956 and is the second largest summer training facility. It employs over 100 officers and 150 staff cadets each year. The centre occupies Goose Spit opposite Comox, and makes use of Highland Secondary School as an auxiliary training facility for classroom work, first aid, and music training. &quot;Quadra&quot; is the only Sea Cadet Training Centre in Canada to include all four trades plus two of the three specialty trades (Marine Engineering, and Shipwright). Cadets undergoing training as boatswains and marine engineers also undergo training in damage control at CFB Esquimalt. &quot;Quadra&quot; plays host to a number of international exchange cadets. In recent years, these have included contingents from South Korea, Japan, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Bermuda, and the Netherlands. Since 2022, this has been the only training centre still with the HMCS prefix.
* CTC Trenton (HMCS &quot;Ontario&quot;) is a detachment located in Kingston, Ontario HMCS &quot;Ontario&quot; Sea Cadet Summer Training Centre began life as Cadets Camp Frontenac (sailing camp) on 4 July 1977, and was officially redesignated as HMCS &quot;Ontario&quot; Cadet summer Training Establishment on 13 July 1981 thus allowing &quot;Ontario&quot; to expand and to offer a wider range of training opportunities to sea cadets from across Ontario and Canada previously disciplines such as music, drill and ceremonial and the two-week general training course, and now only sail and seamanship. In the summer months &quot;Ontario&quot;″s small cadre of full-time staff are supplemented by 110 officers, non-commissioned members and civilian instructors of the COATS and sea cadets who are offered summer employment as staff cadets. HMCS &quot;Ontario&quot; is also a year-round operation, responsible for sail training and the operational standards of nine sail centres and a staff of 80 part-time officers and civilian instructors who staff the sail centres located across the province of Ontario in the spring and autumn months. From 1982 to 2019 HMCS &quot;Ontario&quot;″s main headquarters has been located at CFB Kingston with the main summer training centre located on the grounds of the Royal Military College. From 2022 onwards, its headquarters has been combined under CTC Trenton, and is now a detachment used for the Sail course.

Additionally, cadets may apply for a number of tri-service courses hosted by other training centres.

===== Former SCSTC =====
* , the historic destroyer that fought in World War II and now a National Historic site, was home to a unique six-week-long boatswain trade training course during the summer months in the 1970s. At that time &quot;Haida&quot; was a museum ship located in Toronto, Ontario. Approximately 30 Sea Cadets would live aboard, sleep in hammocks like the original crew, and follow a realistic ship&#x27;s routine for six weeks while training. They would also double as museum guides for periods during the day. On at least one occasion, select cadets were offered the opportunity to use their new skills after graduating from the course. In 1975 four cadets were selected to serve a three week stint aboard Canadian Coast Guard vessels at sea, sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia.
*SCSTC HMCS &quot;Avalon&quot;, located in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, was, at its closing, the smallest SCSTC in Canada. It offered training in either basic sail or beginner band.
* SCSTC was located at the Echo Valley Conference Centre, formerly the Fort San sanatorium, near Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle, Saskatchewan, an hour north east of Regina, Saskatchewan. HMCS &quot;Qu&#x27;Appelle&quot; offered the introductory Two-Week General Training course, and Trade Groups One through Three of the Music and Sail courses. HMCS &quot;Qu&#x27;Appelle&quot; last offered courses in 2004.
* SCSTC HMCS &quot;Gimli&quot;, HMCS &quot;Qu&#x27;Appelle&quot;″s predecessor, was located in Hnausa, Manitoba.
* SCSTC HMCS &quot;Québec&quot;, located in Sainte-Angèle-de-Laval, Quebec, was the only SCSTC that was entirely delivered in French. It trained cadets in all four trades as well as the Shipwright specialty course. &quot;Québec&quot; occupied a school during the summer season. The training centre opened its doors in 1975, and offered its last summer courses in 2012.
* Camp Tillicum, located outside of North Bay, Ontario on Callander Bay was a detachment of HMCS &quot;Ontario&quot; offering Two-Week General Training and Basic Leadership courses. The camp closed in 1986.
* SCSTC HMCS &quot;Micmac&quot; located in the Windsor Park region of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It trained cadets in Boatswain and Submariner. The camp closed in late 1988. Boatswain cadets were then transferred to HMCS &quot;Acadia&quot;.
* CTC HMCS &quot;Acadia&quot;, located in Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, was the largest summer training facility. During the course of the summer, &quot;Acadia&quot; was home to roughly 1,200 cadets who were undergoing training. &quot;Acadia&quot; provided training in Music, Sail, Drill and Ceremonial, and Seamanship training. In 2006, &quot;Acadia&quot; celebrated 50 years as a Sea Cadet Summer Training Centre. &quot;Acadia&quot; closed to cadets in 2020, and was not reopened once summer training resumed in 2022.

== Honours and awards ==
The Canadian Cadet Movement maintains its own Honours and Awards system. Cadets may be awarded these based on many criteria including bravery, citizenship, service, outstanding performance on a summer training course, and are worn on the right side of the cadet uniform, under their name tag. In addition, cadets may also wear any orders, decorations, and medals of Canada they have been awarded on the left side of their uniform.

Within the system, there are several honours and awards common to all three cadet elements and some that are unique to each. A cadet who transfers from one element to another may continue to wear any medals awarded from their previous service, but in general, sea cadets may be eligible for the following nine honours and awards, and are in the order of precedence:

==Vessels==


, built by Captain (N) Thomas G. Fuller, does fall and spring youth sail training group trips on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway for organizations such as the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets, Girl Guides of Canada, corporate groups and for people who are working towards The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Awards.

==Symbols==

===Flags===
The Sea Cadets have used a variety of flags during their history: some corps flew the White Ensign until 1929; they then used the Canadian Blue Ensign and the flag of the Navy League of Canada until 1953. In that year, the Chief of Naval Service approved a design for the Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Flag: a white flag with the Union Flag in the canton, and, on the fly, the badge of the Cadets, a gold anchor on a blue roundel surrounded by red maple leaves and surmounted by a Naval Crown. In 1976, the Sovereign approved a new design, which replaced the Union Flag in the canton with the Maple Leaf Flag.

<text>Mira Road (Marathi pronunciation: ) is a suburb north of Mumbai in Thane District and is also a part of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. It falls within the Police Jurisdiction of Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar Police Commissionerate. Mira Road is situated in the north-western portion of Salsette Island, Maharashtra state, India. Mira Road has a large Marathi population followed by other ethnic groups. 

==History ==
The rise of Mumbai&#x27;s real estate prices has been instrumental in the development of the Mira-Bhayandar region. From 1947 onwards, primarily developed by Bharat Shah the rise in real estate prices prompted several largely lower and middle-income families to migrate to the satellite cities of Mumbai like Virar, Vasai and Nalasopara. At that time, the Mira-Bhayandar area was part of a Gram Panchayat and was consisted primarily of agricultural land, majorly rice. This delayed and deterred builders from starting development projects. By 1980, builders began to buy agricultural land and start developing townships. 

The Mira Bhayandar Municipal Council was set up on June 12, 1985, by integrating five Gram Panchayats which included the Mira Gram Panchayat, which is from where Mira Road got its name.

By 1990, the council was extended and it held the first election. Gilbert Mendonca was elected as the first president of the Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Council. 

As it is located very close to the city, with easy accessibility by road as well as railway, and facilities for the city also extending to this town, have resulted in an increase in population and Mira Bhayandar as a whole, developed further. 

The Municipal Council later on 28 February 2002, was changed to a Municipal Corporation due to its large population and had its first elected mayor Smt. Maira Mendonca on 11 August. Mira Road and its neighbouring suburb Bhayandar began emerging as a fast developing suburb and experienced economic development mainly due to its manufacturing sector. Most of the development has occurred only on the east side whereas the west side of the railway line is covered with salt pans and mangroves.

== Demographics ==
Mira Road has a large Marathi population. Mira Road is in the Northern part of Mumbai City and lies in the North west ward within the jurisdiction of Municipal Corporation Mira Road has three dominant languages with large Gujarati community residing in most of the suburbs of Northern Mumbai that stretches from Bhayander to Bandra, it is also shown in the linguistic demography of the suburb, while the official language Marathi is spoken by the natives of the land and migrants from other parts of Maharashtra, Hindi is the main language of communication and in trade and commerce in the suburban region of Mumbai and Mumbai Metropolitan region, is spoken by most of the North Indian Community as their native language. Marathi, the official language, is the mother tongue of 35.13% mostly in Uttan and Gorai area, while the dominant language, Gujarati is mother tongue by 30.62% of the population and Hindi by 24.90% as their mother tongue. Hindi is by far the major language spoken as the language of communication by all the people living in the suburbs and metropolitan area of Mumbai as their language of communication.

==Geography==
Mira Road is located on the northern portion of Salsette Island and at the northern part of the Konkan region. Mira Road along with Bhayandar comes which is under the jurisdiction of Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation. The entire Mira-Bhayandar region lies just outside Mumbai Suburban district and officially belongs to Thane district, despite being closer to the island of Mumbai. The Mira-Bhayandar region comprises an area of 79 km2. A marshy creek divides Mumbai and Mira Road. The western part of the city is completely made up of barren lands, where salt pans were situated in the past. In the north lies Vasai Creek, to the east Sanjay Gandhi National Park and the Uttan coast, to the west. It mainly is of Deccan lava terrain and consists of waterlogged and marshy areas. The climate experienced here is tropical, wet and dry climate.

<doc id="882139" wikidata="Q3630420" url="?curid=882139" title="Tulsi Lake">
<text>Tulsi Lake is a fresh water lake in northern Mumbai. It is stated to be the second largest lake in Mumbai and supplies part of the city&#x27;s potable water. This is one of the three lakes located in the Salsette Island; the other two being Powai Lake and Vihar Lake.
Both Tulsi lake and Vihar lake are located within the densely forested Sanjay Gandhi National Park or also known popularly as the Borivali National Park (BNP).
==Hydrology==

Tulsi Lake was built by damming the River Tasso, and redirecting the flow to the nearby Vihar Lake. Rain water from the catchment area of 676 hectares of Powai-Kanheri hill ranges drains into the lake. During the rainy season the flood flows out flows into the Powai Lake and further down into the Mithi River. The maximum height of hill in the catchment is about 400 m. The southwest monsoon sets in by mid June and lasts till September. The maximum rainfall is normally recorded in the months of July and August. The mean annual rainfall is reported to be 3000 mm. Rainfall have reportedly crossed 4000 mm several times. Highest ever recorded rainfall to the figure of 5316 mm have been recorded in the year 2019 (1 June - 30 September).

The plan to create the lake was conceived in 1872 and construction completed 1897. It was designed as a backup for the Vihar Lake to supply portable drinking water to the city of Bombay (now Mumbai). The lake has surface area of 1.35 km2 (135 hectares). The average water depth is reported to be 12 m with a gross storage at Full Supply Level (FSL) of , out of which per day are supplied to Greater Mumbai.

The highest overflow level, recorded at the dam is 139.17 m (456.6 ft).This fresh water lake primarily fulfills the water requirement of the southern part of Mumbai.

==Access==
The lake is located 32 km to the north of Mumbai by road. The nearest suburban electric train station is Borivli East on the Western Railways and is close to western express highway, with a further travel of 6 km from the station by road to the lake. The nearest Sahar International Airport is at a distance of about 20 km.
As the lake is located inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, entry permits are to be obtained from the park authorities for visit to the lake.

==Flora and fauna==

The vegetation on the hill slopes draining into the lake is thick and lush, undisturbed and of mixed moist deciduous type. The lake and its catchment are protected by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and Sanjay Gandhi National Park Authority.
As the lake is situated inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the flora and fauna reported for the park would be relevant to the lake. However, fresh water crocodiles Mugger or Marsh crocodiles (&quot;Crocodilus palustris&quot;) are known to inhabit the lake in sustainable numbers. As it is difficult to sight them in the lake, the park has set up a Crocodile Park’ to view the reptiles of different sizes.

<text>Paao is a figure from Hawaii. He is most likely a Hawaiian historical character retold through Hawaiian legend. According to Hawaiian tradition and folklore, he is said to have been a high priest from Kahiki, specifically &quot;Wewaʻu&quot; and &quot;ʻUpolu.&quot; In Hawaiian prose and chant, the term &quot;Kahiki&quot; is applied in reference to any land outside of Hawaii: the linguistic root is conclusively derived from Tahiti. &quot;Upolu&quot; point to actual places in Samoa; and, Hawaiian scholars and royal commentators consistently claim Paao came from Samoa.

Scholars of Hawaiian lore including David Malo, Samuel M. Kamakau, John Papa ʻĪʻī, Solomon Peleioholani, Teuira Henry, and Stephen L. Desha support the notion that Pili and Pa&#x27;ao immigrated from the Society Islands of Samoa.

King Kalākaua, in his &quot;Legends and Myths of Hawai&#x27;i&quot;, theorized that the lineage of &quot;Tahitian&quot; chiefs and their aristocrats and priests descended from Samoa (i.e. Paao and Pilikaaiea). His theory comes from the Big Island in the village of Upolu named after Samoa (or Western Samoa called Upolu). Most historians have concluded that Pili and Pa&#x27;ao both came from the islands known today as Samoa. ʻUpolu is the capital city of Western Samoa; and is linguistically and politically closer to Hawaii in the past.

Legends suggest that Paao introduced certain customs (such as human sacrifice, primary worship of the god Kū, red feathered girdles &quot;Kāʻei&quot;, Kāʻeke drums and veneration of the bonito fish) to Hawaii. He is also said to have brought a &quot;pure&quot; chief to rule over Hawai&#x27;i Island, deposing the tyrant and highest ranking chief, Kapawā. 

At this time in Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s history, the four island kingdoms were Kauaʻi (Kauaʻi and Niʻihau), Oʻahu, Maui (Maui, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, and Kaho&#x27;olawe), and Hawai&#x27;i. After the overthrow by Pāʻao and Pili, Kapawā fled to the Island Kingdom of Maui where his royal relatives, through the ancient ʻUlu bloodlines, provided him with shelter and protection. The two bloodlines between Hawai&#x27;i (Pili) and Maui (ʻUlu) would often go to war, with Maui usually remaining victorious. It wasn&#x27;t until the time of King Kamehameha the Great, who was a direct descendant of Pili, that Hawai&#x27;i fully conquered the kingdom of Maui. Having done so, Kamehameha was able to complete his conquests, bringing about the unification of the Hawaiian islands under one rule.

==Documented history of the story of Paao==

The Paao story makes its first documented historical appearance in 1835–1836, in a collection of Hawaiian traditions called &quot;Moolelo Hawaii&quot; assembled by Hawaiian students of Lahainaluna High School, on the Hawaiian island of Maui. This collection was the basis of Sheldon Dibble&#x27;s 1838 history of Hawaii. David Malo was one of the Lahainaluna students active in collecting oral traditions. He continued collecting legends and when he died in 1854, he had completed an unpublished manuscript that was finally translated to English and published in 1898.

Martha Beckwith, in her &quot;Hawaiian Mythology&quot; (1940, as republished in 1970), notes these historical sources:

* Stokes, John – &quot;Whence Paao?&quot; &quot;Hawaiian Historical Society Papers Vol. 15&quot;, Honolulu 1928, pp. 40–45

The Paao story also survives in various oral traditions passed down through Native Hawaiian families. Some Hawaiians insist on the purity and reliability of these traditions, but academic scholars believe that much from these traditions have been shaped by easily available published versions of the narrative.

However, there is no reason to doubt that the Paao story was widespread in pre-contact times. A lineage of Hawaiian high priests claimed descent from Paao, and Hawaiian high chiefs from the Big Island of Hawaiʻi traced their genealogies to Pili-kaaiea (Pili), the &quot;pure&quot; chief brought by Paao. Paao is said to have introduced human sacrifice, the walled heiau, the red feather girdle, the puloulou kapu sign, the prostrating kapu, the veneration of aku fish, and the feather god Tairi. The Paao narrative justified and sanctioned the social order as it then existed.

==Narrative as found in Malo==
:We are informed (by historical tradition) that two men named Paʻao and Makua-kaumana, with a company of others, voyaged hither, observing the stars as a compass; and that Paʻao remained in Kohala, while Makua-Kaumana returned to Tahiti. Paʻao arrived at Hawaiʻi during the reign of Lono-ka-wai, the king of Hawaiʻi. He (Lono-ka-wai) was the sixteenth in that line of kings, succeeding Kapawa. Paʻao continued to live in Kohala until the kings of Hawaiʻi became degraded and corrupted (&quot;hewa&quot;); then he sailed away to Tahiti to fetch a king from thence. Pili (Kaʻaiea) was that king and he became one in Hawaiʻi&#x27;s line of kings (&quot;papa aliʻi&quot;).
:–David Malo, &quot;Hawaiian Antiquities&quot;, 1951 edition, p. 6.

==Narrative in greater detail==
The main outlines of the story follow. Many details vary from version to version. In one version told by British missionary William Ellis in 1826 Paao was a Caucasian chief.

Paao is said to have been a priest and a master navigator. He lived on a distant island called Kahiki in the oldest versions, and identified as either Tahiti or Samoa by believers in the historicity of the narrative.

His older brother, Lonopele, was the chief priest in some versions of the story, or the ruler of the island in others. Lonopele accused Paao&#x27;s son of removing some kapu fish from the royal fishpond, or with stealing fruit. Paao was angry at his brother&#x27;s persecution and in his anger, he killed his own son and ripped open the corpse&#x27;s stomach, showing that there were no remnants of kapu fish or of fruit, in another version these partially digested foods were found.

Paao brooded over his misfortunes and decided to migrate to a distant land, far from his brother. He readied three large canoes for the voyage. He placed a kapu over the boats; no one was to touch the canoes without his permission. One evening, Paao discovered his nephew, the son of Lonopele, touching one of the sacred canoes. Paao killed his nephew and buried him in the sand under one of the canoes, which was elevated on blocks. Flies buzzed around the decomposing corpse, so the canoe was named Ka-nalo-a-muia, &quot;the buzzing of flies.&quot;

Paao hurriedly assembled his retainers, launched the voyaging canoes, and departed. He left in such a hurry that one of his followers, an aged priest or prophet named Makuakaumana, was left behind. Makuakaumana climbed a cliff and called out to Paao; Paao refused to stop, saying that the canoes were full, all save the projection of the stern. Makuakaumana leapt from the cliff and gained his position in the canoe.

Paao sailed by the stars until they reached the Big Island of Hawaii. They landed in Puna, where Paao built the stone temple platform, or heiau, of Aha-ula, or Red Mouth. This was the first luakini heiau in Hawaii, the first heiau where human sacrifices were offered. He is also said to have landed in Kohala, on the opposite side of the island, and built the famous heiau of Mo&#x27;okini.

Paao believed that the chiefs of Hawaii had become &quot;hewa&quot;, or degraded, by indiscriminate intermarriage with lesser chiefs and commoners. He is said to have returned to his home island to fetch a chief of impeccable ancestry. He asked Lono-ka-eho, or Lono, who refused, and then recruited Pili-kaaiea, or Pili. Paao and Pili, along with Piliʻs sister Hina-au-kekele, chiefs and warriors, and their families, returned to Hawaii, where Pili became the new high chief.

==Lineages of Paao and Pili==
All the succeeding chiefs of the island claimed descent from the legendary Pili. Paao&#x27;s descendants became priests, and their line or order, called Holae, continued into historical times. The last high priest, Hewahewa, who acquiesced to Christianity and the breaking of the kapus or &quot;ʻAi Noa&quot; in 1819, claimed descent from Paao.

==Historicity==
Until fairly recently, Hawaiian historians relied primarily on recorded oral history and comparative linguistics and ethnology. The &quot;two migrations&quot; theory was widely accepted. That is, in a first migration, Polynesians (specifically, Marquesans) settled the Hawaiian islands. In the second migration, Tahitians came north, conquered the original settlers, and established stratified chiefdoms.

Hawaiian archaeology then came into its own and sought material evidence for two migrations. Evidence is found of migrations that originated from the S. China Sea - Lapita (Kirsch, 1999). Then later, followed by migrations that originated from the E. Pacific i.e. Galapagos and Easter Island, which traversed a mostly submerged archipelago pathway leading directly into Tahiti. Thor Heyerdahl theorized that Polynesians originated from S. America and drifted to Hawai&#x27;i by luck, but his ethnocentric thought processes was debunked chiefly by Polynesian Voyaging Society, who showed that non-instrumental navigation was practical. However, there is some evidence that supported Heyerdahl&#x27;s incorrect theory: Sweet potato and coconut originated from the E. Pacific. These along with sugar cane, that originated in India, are among several Hawaiian crops that are now termed &quot;canoe plants&quot;; they were extremely important to voyaging way-finders i.e. Paao, who migrated to Hawaii. Furthermore, war implements of S. America, which were not typical in the W. Pacific, strongly resembled the Hawaiian ihe (spear), mahiole (war helmet) and ahaula (cape of royalty). 

Many Native Hawaiians and scholars who have studied the narratives believe the Paao narrative contains elements of actual history, and reflects a literal wave of migration from the south. The Polynesian Voyaging Society&#x27;s undertakings, such as &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot; canoe&#x27;s voyages, indicate the feasibility of long voyages in ancient Polynesian canoes and the reliability of celestial navigation; these demonstrations show that the types of voyaging mentioned in the Pa&#x27;ao stories were indeed feasible, but the recreated voyages do little to prove the authenticity of the Pa&#x27;ao legends.

Hawaiian attitudes towards the high chiefs have changed; the ancient high chiefs are often seen today as oppressors, invaders who descended upon a peaceful and egalitarian Hawaiian population. Activists praise these pre-Paao days as the real Hawaiian past, to be revived and reenacted in the present, and vilify Paao as a source of Hawaiian problems. In this version, &quot;all&quot; the problems faced by Native Hawaiians can be traced to foreign interference.

<doc id="882141" wikidata="Q356932" url="?curid=882141" title="Adiaphora">
<text>Adiaphoron (; plural: adiaphora; from the Greek (pl. ), meaning &#x27;not different or differentiable&#x27;) is the negation of &quot;diaphora&quot;, &#x27;difference&#x27;.

==In Ancient Greek philosophy==

In Cynicism, adiaphora represents indifference to the s of life through ascetic practices which help one become free from influences – such as wealth, fame, and power – that have no value in nature. Examples include Diogenes&#x27; practice of living in a tub and walking barefoot in winter.

Similarly, the Stoics distinguish all the objects of human pursuit into three classes: good, bad, and adiaphora (indifferent). Virtue, wisdom, justice, temperance, and the like, are denominated good; their opposites were bad. Besides these there are many other objects of pursuit such as wealth, fame, etc., of themselves neither good nor bad. These are thought therefore in ethics to occupy neutral territory, and are denominated &quot;adiaphora&quot;. This distinction amounts practically to an exclusion of the adiaphora from the field of morals. In the context of Stoicism adiaphora is usually translated as &quot;indifference&quot;.

Unlike in Stoicism and Cynicism, In Pyrrhonism &quot;adiaphora&quot; has no specific connection to morality, but indicates things that cannot be logically differentiated, while Aristotle uses &quot;adiaphora&quot; to mean &quot;undifferentiated by a logical /differentia.&quot;

==Christianity==
In Christianity, adiaphora are matters not regarded as essential to faith, but nevertheless as permissible for Christians or allowed by the church. What is specifically considered adiaphora depends on the specific theology in view.

===Lutheranism===

The issue of what constituted &quot;adiaphora&quot; became a major dispute during the Protestant Reformation. In 1548, two years after the death of Martin Luther, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V tried to unite Catholics and Protestants in his realm with a law called the Augsburg Interim. This was rejected by Philipp Melanchthon, because it did not ensure justification by faith as a fundamental doctrine. Later he was persuaded to accept a compromise known as the Leipzig Interim, deciding that doctrinal differences not related to justification by faith were &quot;adiaphora&quot; or matters not essential for salvation. Melanchthon&#x27;s compromise was vehemently opposed by Matthias Flacius and his followers in Magdeburg, who went to the opposite extreme by claiming that &quot;adiaphora&quot; cease to be such in a case of scandal and confession. By 1576, both extremes were rejected by the majority of Lutherans led by Martin Chemnitz and the formulators of the Formula of Concord.

In 1577, the Formula of Concord was crafted to settle the question of the nature of genuine &quot;adiaphora&quot;, which it defined as church rites that are “neither commanded nor forbidden in the Word of God.” However, the Formula added believers should not yield even in matters of &quot;adiaphora&quot; when these are being forced upon them by the “enemies of God&#x27;s Word.”

The Lutheran Augsburg Confession states that true unity of the Church is enough to allow for agreement, concerning the doctrine of the Gospel and administration of the Sacraments. It also posits that merely human traditions, namely extrabiblical rites or ceremonies, need not be the same across all congregations.

===Puritanism===
The Westminster Confession of Faith distinguishes between elements or acts of worship (worship proper) and the circumstances of worship. The elements of worship must be limited to what has positive warrant in Scripture, a doctrine known as the regulative principle of worship. In this framework, the elements of worship have included praise (the words and manner of music), prayer, preaching and teaching from the Bible, the taking of vows, and the two sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, while the circumstances of worship have included the building and its necessary furniture and the time of day for worship.

The circumstances of worship are considered adiaphora, although they must be done for edification and to promote peace and order (compare ; ). According to the Westminster Confession 20.2, the conscience is left free in general belief and behavior within the realm of whatever is not “contrary to the Word. However, specifically concerning worship and religious faith, the conscience is free from whatever is “besides” Scripture; that is, one is free to worship and believe only according to whatever has positive warrant in Scripture.

Presbyterians who have subscribed to the Westminster Confession, for instance, sometimes considered the questions of musical instruments and of the singing of hymns (as opposed to exclusive psalmody) not drawn directly from the Bible as related to the elements of worship, as not optional circumstances. Thus, they rejected musical instruments and hymns because they believed these were neither commanded by Scripture, nor deduced by good and necessary consequence from it. However, adherence to such a position is rare among modern Presbyterians.

The Puritan position on worship is thus in line with the common saying regarding adiaphora: “In necessary things, unity; in doubtful things, liberty; in all things, charity.”

===Latitudinarianism in Anglicanism===
Latitudinarianism was initially a pejorative term applied to a group of 17th-century English theologians who believed in conforming to official Church of England practices, but who felt that matters of doctrine, liturgical practice, and ecclesiastical organization were of relatively little importance. Good examples of the latitudinarian philosophy were found among the Cambridge Platonists. The latitudinarian Anglicans of that period built on Richard Hooker&#x27;s position in &quot;Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity&quot;, which states God cares about the moral state of the individual soul and that matters such as church leadership are “things indifferent”. However, they took the position far beyond Hooker&#x27;s own and extended it to doctrinal matters.

<text>Interstate 185 (I-185) is a auxiliary Interstate Highway located entirely in Greenville County, South Carolina. I-185 serves as a spur route of I-85 into the city of Greenville as well as a shortcut route for drivers accessing I-385 from northbound I-85. A portion of this road is tolled and is known as the &quot;Southern Connector&quot;. Together with a portion of I-385, it forms a partial beltway through Greenville&#x27;s southern suburbs.

== Route description ==
I-185&#x27;s northern portion starts at an at-grade intersection at Henrydale Avenue. North of this intersection, US Highway 29 (US 29) continues as Mills Avenue into downtown Greenville. I-185 travels south with two lanes in each direction to its junction with I-85. At this junction, I-185 has only one lane of thru traffic each way; south of the junction, I-185 returns to two lanes in each direction. In addition, US 29 leaves I-185 and travels concurrently with I-85 for . 

South of exit 12, I-185 has a toll in each direction, with one lane in each direction dedicated for travelers with the Palmetto Pass. At exit 10 (South Carolina Highway 20 [SC 20]), travelers exiting northbound I-185 and entering southbound I-185 also are tolled. At this point, I-185 leaves the Greenville city limits and enters Golden Grove. Just north of exit 7 (US 25), I-185 reenters Greenville. 

At exit 4 (Fork Shoals Road), travelers exiting southbound I-185 and entering northbound I-185 are tolled. South of this interchange is another toll plaza for both directions, again with one lane in each direction for drivers with the Palmetto Pass. 

Near the end of I-185&#x27;s southern terminus at I-385, I-185 enters Mauldin. Exit 1A on I-185 northbound, Neely Ferry Road, allows access to Discovery Island. I-185 then splits; one lane exits rights and merges with I-385 southbound while other traffic continues straight to merge with I-385 northbound. Traffic toward I-385 northbound also can exit on SC 417, an exit with no number. At the merge with I-385 northbound, I-185 shrinks to one lane. I-185 ends here.

==History==
The northern portion, which runs from I-85 to the Greenville city limits, was opened in the 1960s and is cosigned with US 29. The southern portion, which connects the I-85/I-185 interchange (exit 42) with the I-385/US 276 interchange (exit 30), was opened as a toll road in 2001. This extension was dubbed the &quot;Southern Connector&quot; and increased I-185 from three to in length. 

===Southern Connector===
The Southern Connector was constructed as a public–private partnership between the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) and Interwest Carolina Transportation Group, LLC, a development team that included a not-for-profit corporation called Connector 2000 Association, Inc. (C2A). Under this agreement, C2A operates the toll road under a 50-year license. They were responsible for financing, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the road during this period and the toll revenue would be used to pay them for these efforts. To finance the project, C2A sold bonds that were tax-exempt under Internal Revenue Service Rule 63-20, which provides that the bonds sold will be exempt if they finance an activity which is &quot;public in nature&quot;.

The highway opened in February 2001, nine months ahead of schedule. By 2007, the Connector 2000 Association was having financial difficulties because ridership on the toll road was not meeting original estimates. In late 2007, the association began looking for a concessionaire to take over the operation and financial liability of the toll road. By early 2008, C2A had received a default notice from their bond trustee In January 2010, the bond trustee missed an interest payment, and the C2A was more than $8 million (equivalent to $ in ) behind in its payments to SCDOT for the maintenance and license fees under their agreement. On June 24, 2010, the Southern Connector filed for bankruptcy.

The corporation emerged from bankruptcy on March 28, 2011, by restructuring bond debt and their concession and maintenance agreement with SCDOT. Tolls were raised on January 2, 2012, as part of the settlement. 

In 2016, the Southern Connector surpassed 75 million toll transactions since its inception. Between the two main toll plazas, the speed limit has been raised to . 

==Tolls==
There are two toll plazas located along the Southern Connector, known as the east and west plazas. Toll booths are located on entrance/exit ramps on Fork Shoals Road (exit 4) and Piedmont Highway (exit 10). The toll plazas have both electronic toll collection (ETC) and cash lanes; toll booths located on ramps accept only ETC or exact change only. Those that do not have exact change or do not pay the toll can fill out a &quot;Pledge Payment Form&quot;; violators have 30 days to remit payment before administrative fees are added to the toll due.

Palmetto Pass is the only form of electronic toll collection accepted on the Southern Connector.

<doc id="882145" wikidata="Q5382857" url="?curid=882145" title="Vihar Lake">
<text>Vihar Lake (Pronunciation: ) is located near Vihar village on the Mithi River within the precincts of the Borivali National Park, also called the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, in North Mumbai. When built in 1860 (construction started in 1856), it was considered as the largest lake in Mumbai in the Salsette group of islands. It is hemmed between the Tulsi Lake and the Powai Lake (shown in map). It partly meets the drinking water needs of the Mumbai region. It supplies only 3% of the Mumbai city&#x27;s water requirement, after filtration at Bhandup where the large water filtration plant is located.

==History==

With the few thousand wells feeding the population of Mumbai tending to go dry during summer, the acute shortage of water resulted in protests by the local residents in June 1845. A two-man committee, appointed by the British rulers of the time, to examine the grievances of the agitators concurred with water shortage problem and stressed the urgent need to solve the water supply problem of Mumbai.

The Committee appointed by the government located suitable sites to construct dams and create reservoirs to store the monsoon flows of the Mithi river catchment, which resulted in presently existing Vihar Lake, Tulsi Lake, and the Powai Lake. Vihar reservoir was the first piped water supply scheme of Mumbai.

In 1850, Captain Crawford submitted a report favouring the Vihar Scheme for the Mumbai city&#x27;s water supply needs.

Work on the &quot;Vihar Water Works&quot; commenced in January 1856 and was completed in 1860, during the governorship of John Lord Elphinstone.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), a Govt. body which controls the lake&#x27;s affairs has also acquired agricultural land in the catchment area of the Vihar lake as a sanitary precaution.

==Access==
By road, it is from Mumbai. Access by suburban electric train is to Kurla or Andheri and then by road.

Access to the lake for the general public has been curtailed since 13 March 1993 (Source: Official BMC Board installed at the gate) following the Bombay Blasts on 12 March 1993 due to perceived threats to the Mumbai public, as the lake is located in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. It can still be viewed in many Bollywood movies in a long shot taken from Mumbai Film City, as seen in the Infobox.

==Hydrology and dam features==

Impoundment of Mithi River, north of Mumbai, was effected to store the rainwater from a catchment area of 18.96 km2 to create the Vihar Lake. The Powai-Kanheri hill ranges form the catchment area, which drains the rain water into the lake. For this purpose, three earthen embankment dams with a masonry spillway section were constructed to create a reservoir of 9200 million gallons capacity at the full reservoir level of 80.42 metres. The lake has a maximum water depth of 34 m and a minimum of 12 m. The lakes water spread area is 7 km2. The dam height was raised in 1872 resulting in increase of water supply from 32 million gallons (catering to a population of 0.7 million) to 36 million gallons.

==Flora and fauna==

The lake and its catchment are protected by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and Sanjay Gandhi National Park Authority.
The catchment areas of Vihar lake has high hills rising on all sides. The seclusion, protection, and security provided under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park has ensured well wooded hill slopes and abundant natural regeneration. Higher percentage of khair species has been noted in the catchment area of the lake.

As the lake is situated inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the flora and fauna reported for the park would be relevant to the lake. However, fresh water crocodiles Mugger or Marsh crocodiles (&quot;Crocodilus palustris&quot;) are known to inhabit the lake in sustainable numbers. As it is difficult to sight them in the lake, the park has set up a Crocodile Park’ to view the reptiles of different sizes.

==Limnology==
Limnological studies carried out by the Central Public Health Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur, India, in 1964, indicated an unstable thermal stratification in the lake waters. The dissolved oxygen (DO) values were found to increase in some months and carbon dioxide was found to be less at the surface than at the bottom. In cooler season, the surface water was found to be less alkaline, which could be attributed to the photosynthesis activity of the algae. The pH stratification was found to be unstable. Interrelation was attributed to fluctuations in the chlorophyll, pH and DO values and nitrates were generally absent on the surface and no sulphates were detected.

==An odd event==

In the year 2006, finding sweet water at the Mahim Creek (a semi enclosed area), where fresh water and sea water meet, created a lot of excitement among the public. The health department of BMC who analysed the water sample from the site found that salt level in the sea water was as low as 600 particle per million (ppm), compared to the normal level 10000000 particle per million (ppm). The National Institute of Oceanography, Goa who were also consulted stated that this phenomenon was not unusual and could have been caused by heavy rainfall and low tide. This necessitated the Maharashtra Government to intervene and examine the issue rationally to convince the excited public. BMC Commissioner gave a press statement stating:

<text>The Scott Monument is a Victorian Gothic monument to Scottish author Sir Walter Scott. It is the second-largest monument to a writer in the world after the José Martí monument in Havana. It stands in Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, opposite the former Jenners building on Princes Street and near Edinburgh Waverley Railway Station, which is named after Scott&#x27;s Waverley novels.

== Design and concept ==
The tower is high and has viewing platforms reached by a series of spiral staircases giving panoramic views of central Edinburgh and its surroundings. The highest platform is reached by a total of 287 steps. It is built from Binny sandstone quarried near Ecclesmachan in West Lothian.

It is placed on axis with South St. David Street, one of the two streets leading off St. Andrew Square to Princes Street, and is a focal point within that vista, its scale being large enough to screen the Old Town behind. Its size and elevated position cause it to dominate the eastern section of the Princes Street Gardens.

== History ==

Following Scott&#x27;s death in 1832, a competition was held to design a monument to him. An unlikely entrant went under the pseudonym &quot;John Morvo&quot;, the medieval architect of Melrose Abbey. Morvo was in fact George Meikle Kemp, 45 year-old joiner, draftsman, and self-taught architect. He had feared that his lack of architectural qualifications and reputation would disqualify him, but his design was popular with the competition&#x27;s judges, and they awarded him the contract to construct the monument in 1838.

John Steell was commissioned to design a monumental statue of Scott to rest in the centre space within the tower&#x27;s four columns. It is made from white Carrara marble and shows Scott seated, resting from writing one of his works with a quill pen, his dog Maida by his side. The monument carries 64 figures of characters from Scott&#x27;s novels, sculpted by Scots sculptors including Alexander Handyside Ritchie, John Rhind, William Birnie Rhind, William Brodie, William Grant Stevenson, David Watson Stevenson, John Hutchison, George Anderson Lawson, Thomas Stuart Burnett, William Shirreffs, Andrew Currie, George Clark Stanton, Peter Slater, Amelia Robertson Hill (who also made the statue of David Livingstone immediately east of the monument), and the otherwise unknown Katherine Anne Fraser Tytler.

==The stone masons and the Scott monument==

The erection of the Scott monument came at a high cost to the stone masons involved, especially to the &#x27;hewing masons&#x27; who were responsible for preparing the blocks, with their carvings and statues. This work was done in closed sheds, where they were exposed to large quantities of dangerous fine dust. Things were not so bad for the &#x27;building masons&#x27; who worked in the open, placing the already prepared blocks of stone. Because of the hardness of the stone (from the Binnie quarry, near Uphall to the west of Edinburgh) used for the monument and other local buildings, Edinburgh masons were especially vulnerable to phthisis, the term used at the time for silicosis. One contemporary observer says that the monument &quot;killed twenty three of the finest hewers in Edinburgh.&quot; Another mentions &quot;one half of the whole number of masons employed&quot; died of the lung disease.

==Foundation stone==
The foundation stone was laid on 15 August 1840 by Sir James Forrest of Comiston in his capacity as Lord Provost and as Grand Master Mason of Scotland. Construction began in 1841 following permission by Parliament&#x27;s &quot;Monument to Sir Walter Scott Act&quot; and ran for nearly four years. It was completed in the autumn of 1844, with Kemp&#x27;s son placing the finial in August of the year. The total cost was just over £16,154. The monument was inaugurated on 15 August 1846, but George Meikle Kemp was absent. He had fallen into the Union Canal while walking home from the site and drowned on the foggy evening of 6 March 1844.

== Statues and locations ==
There are 68 statues on the monument, not counting Scott and his dog Maida, and 64 are visible from the ground. Four figures are placed above the final viewing gallery and are only visible by telephoto or from the viewing gallery (at a distorted angle). In addition, eight kneeling Druid figures support the final viewing gallery. There are 32 unfilled niches at higher level.

Sixteen heads of Scottish poets and writers appear on the lower faces, at the top of the lower pilasters. The heads represent, counter-clockwise from the northwest: James Hogg, Robert Burns, Robert Fergusson, Allan Ramsay, George Buchanan, Sir David Lindsay, Robert Tannahill, Lord Byron, Tobias Smollett, James Beattie, James Thomson, John Home, Mary, Queen of Scots, King James I of Scotland, King James V of Scotland, and William Drummond of Hawthornden.

== Modern administration ==
In the early 1990s it was proposed that the stonework should be cleaned. There were views for and against cleaning and a scientific/geological investigation, including cleaning trials on samples of stone, was carried out. It was decided not to clean the stone due to the damage it would sustain. A restoration programme was undertaken involving replacing old repairs and damaged areas with Binny stone for which purpose the original quarry was re-opened. The fresh stonework contrasts with the smoke-darkened original.

The overall cost of the restoration was £2.36 million and was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic Scotland and the City of Edinburgh Council.

The monument is now administered by the Culture and Sport division of the City of Edinburgh Council (See External Links for visitor information) who in 2016 installed a new LED lighting system. The design of the lights was &quot;intended to highlight the monument’s architectural features with a soft warm glow&quot; and were first illuminated on 21 September 2016.

== In popular culture ==
The monument is featured prominently in the 2012 film &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;, as a location which the character Robert Frobisher frequents An imagined copy of the monument is featured in the 1899 painting by James Ford, &quot;Holiday Time in Cape Town,&quot; depicting a Victorian era imagined utopian future Cape Town.

<text>Chengde, formerly known as Jehol and Rehe, is a prefecture-level city in Hebei province, situated about northeast of Beijing. It is best known as the site of the Mountain Resort, a vast imperial garden and palace formerly used by the Qing emperors as summer residence. The permanent resident population is approximately 3,473,200 in 2017.

==History==

In 1703, the Kangxi Emperor made Chengde his summer residence. Constructed throughout the eighteenth century, the Mountain Resort was used by both the Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors. The site is currently an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the seat of government followed the emperor, Chengde was a political center of the Chinese empire during these times.

The city of Jeholan early romanization of Rehe via the French transcription of the northern suffix &quot;ér&quot; as &quot;eul&quot;reached its height under the Qianlong Emperor 1735-1796 (died 1799). The great Putuo Zongcheng Temple, loosely based on the Potala in Lhasa, was completed after just four years of work in 1771. It was heavily decorated with gold and the emperor worshipped in the Golden Pavilion. In the temple itself was a bronze-gilt statue of Tsongkhapa, the Reformer of the Gelugpa sect.

Under the Republic of China, Chengde was the capital of Rehe province. From 1933 to 1945 the city was under Japanese control as a part of the Manchurian puppet state known as Manchukuo. After World War II the Kuomintang government regained jurisdiction. In 1948, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army took control of Chengde. It would remain a part of Rehe until 1955, when the province was abolished, and the city was incorporated into Hebei.

The city is home to large populations of ethnic minorities, Mongol and Manchu in particular.

==Geography==

Chengde is located in the northeastern portion of Hebei, with latitude 40° 12&#x27;－42° 37&#x27; N, and longitude 115° 54&#x27;－119° 15&#x27; E, and contains the northernmost point in the province. It borders Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Beijing, and Tianjin. Neighbouring prefecture-level provincial cities are Qinhuangdao and Tangshan on the Bohai Gulf, and land-locked Zhangjiakou. Due to its Liaoning border, it is often considered a part of both the North and Northeast China regions. From north to south the prefecture stretches , and from west to east , for a total area of , thus occupying 21.2% of the total provincial area. It is by area the largest prefecture in the province, though as most of its terrain is mountainous, its population density is low.

The Jehol or Rehe (&quot;Hot River&quot;), which gave Chengde its former name, was so named because it did not freeze in winter. Most sections of the river&#x27;s former course are now dry because of modern dams.

===Climate===
Chengde has a four-season, monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;), with widely varying conditions through the prefecture due to its size: winters are moderately long, cold and windy, but dry, and summers are hot and humid. Near the city, however, temperatures are much cooler than they are in Beijing, due to the higher elevation: the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . Spring warming is rapid, but dust storms can blow in from the Mongolian steppe; autumn cooling is similarly quick. Precipitation averages at about for the year, with more than two-thirds of it falling during the three summer months. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 50% in July to 69% in October, the city receives 2,746 hours of sunshine annually.

===Administrative divisions===

Chengde comprises:

==Sport==
The first ever bandy match in China was organised in Chengde in January 2015 and was played between the Russian and Swedish top clubs Baykal-Energiya and Sandviken. Chengde city was one of the initiators when the China Bandy Federation was founded in December 2014. The city hosted the 2018 Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship. While the record number of participants in previous Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championships was 7, the organisers had thought out measures with the goal to attract 12 participating countries. However, in the end 8 teams participated.

==Religion==
Chengde is the seat of the Catholic Diocese of Chengde.

==Transport==

With road and railroad links to Beijing, Chengde has developed into a distribution hub, and its economy is growing rapidly. The newly built Jingcheng Expressway connects Chengde directly to central Beijing, and more freeways are planned for the city. The city&#x27;s new airport was opened on 31 May 2017. It is located northeast of the city center in Tougou Town, Chengde County.

The Beijing–Harbin high-speed railway, completed in January 2021, has 5 stations within Chengde.

==Sights==

The project of building Chengde Mountain Resort started in 1703 and finished in 1790. The whole mountain resort covers an area 5,640,000 square meters. It is the largest royal garden in China. The wall of the mountain resort is over 10,000 meters in length. In summers, emperors of the Qing dynasty came to the mountain resort to relax themselves and escape from the high temperature in Beijing.

The whole Resort can be divided into three areas which are lakes area, plains area and hills area. The lakes area, which includes 8 lakes, covers an area of 496,000 square meters. The plains area covers an area of 607,000 square meters. The emperors held horse races and hunted in the area. The largest area of the three is the hills area. It covers an area of 4,435,000 square meters. Hundreds of palaces and temples were built on the hills in this area.

The elaborate Mountain Resort features large parks with lakes, pagodas, and palaces ringed by a wall. Outside the wall are the Eight Outer Temples (), built in varying architectural styles drawn from throughout China. One of the best-known of these is the Putuo Zongcheng Temple, built to resemble the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet. The resort and outlying temples were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. The nearby Puning Temple, built in 1755, houses the world&#x27;s tallest wooden statue of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara.

Another popular attraction of the Chengde area is Sledgehammer Peak (), a large rock formation in the shape of an inverted sledgehammer. A variety of other mountains, valleys, and grasslands lie within the borders of the city.

<text>P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay (from Ge&#x27;ez: ) is an originally Amharic–Tigrinya language term for Pentecostal Christians. Today, the term refers to all Evangelical Protestant denominations and organisations in Ethiopian and Eritrean societies. Alternative terms include Ethiopian–Eritrean Evangelicalism or the Ethiopian–Eritrean Evangelical Church. Sometimes the denominations and organizations are known as Wenigēlawī (from Ge&#x27;ez: &quot;evangelical&quot;).

Evangelical Christianity was originally introduced by American and European Protestant missionary work, which began in the 19th century among various peoples, including Christians schismed from the Orthodox Tewahedo church, other branches of Christianity, or converted from non-Christian religions or traditional faith practices. Since the creation of P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay churches and organisations, prominent movements among them have been Pentecostalism, the Baptist tradition, Lutheranism, Methodism, Presbyterianism, the Mennonites, and the Eastern-oriented Protestant Christians within Ethiopia and Eritrea and the Ethiopian and Eritrean diaspora.

==Etymology==
The term was coined in the late 1960s and was used as a pejorative for churches that believed in the Pentecostal experience and spiritual gifts of the Holy Spirit, used to describe local Protestant Christians who are not members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches (collectively known as the Orthodox Tewahedo).

The term &quot;P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay&quot; is derived from &quot;Pentecostal&quot;; however, it has since become a general shorthand referring to not only Evangelical Protestants but all Protestant denomination christians, whether they are self-identified as Pentecostal or not. Some Orthodox Ethiopians will even apply the term to the small Catholic population of Ethiopia and Eritrea (but this is rare).

The equivalent rendition in many other languages is &quot;Evangelical&quot;; the term &quot;Wenigēlawī&quot; means &quot;Evangelical&quot; and has been used alongside &quot;P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay&quot;. Many of these groups describe their religious practices as culturally Eastern Christian, but Protestant Evangelical by doctrine.

==Denominations==
The major Protestant denominations in Ethiopia and Eritrea are a group of indigenous, closely linked (part of the or community of churches) Baptist, Lutheran, Pentecostal, and Mennonite denominations.

=== Primary denominations ===

*The Ethiopian Kale Heywet (Word of Life) Church, a charismatic Evangelical Protestant denomination with Pentecostal and Baptist roots. It is associated with the Sudan Interior Mission, an interdenominational organization, and has an Eritrean branch.
*The Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), a Lutheran denomination which includes a Presbyterian-leaning synod. The Eritrean Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus is the Eritrean Lutheran branch of this Evangelical Protestant denomination. The Ethiopian Lutheran denomination is the largest non-united Lutheran Christian denomination in the world (see list of Christian denominations by number of members).
*The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea, a Lutheran denomination which joined the Lutheran World Federation in 1963.
*The Ethiopian Full Gospel Believers&#x27; Church, a Pentecostal denomination with Mennonite influence.
*The Meserete Kristos (Christ Foundation) Church, a Mennonite denomination with Pentecostal influence.
*Christian Brethren

Some P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay communities—especially the Mekane Yesus Lutheran Church for example—have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo churches, which represents the dominant traditional Ethiopian and Eritrean Christian demographic, but for the most part are very Pentecostal in their worship and theology.

==== Other denominations ====
* Ammanuel Baptist Church 
* Misgana Church of Ethiopia
*Assemblies of God – Pentecostal
* Hiwot Berhan Church (Light of Life Church)
* Emnet Kristos
* Berhane Wongel – Gospel Light 
* Ethiopian Addis Kidan Baptist Church
* Evangelical Church of Eritrea
* Lutheran Church of Eritrea
* Middle East General Mission
*Seventh-day Adventist Church
* Anglicanism is represented in Ethiopia and Eritrea by the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East and Episcopal Anglican Province of Alexandria; Ethiopia and Eritrea are both part of the Diocese of Egypt, which also includes other countries in the Horn of Africa as well as the North Africa region. There are two Episcopal churches in Ethiopia, one is in Addis Ababa and the other in Gambela, while in Eritrea there are no officially operated congregations at this time.

===Unity and the ECFE===
The ECFE, or Evangelical Church Fellowship of Ethiopia, is a consortium of born-again, Trinitarian Christians. The ECFE has 22 member churches, and based on 2004 statistics, 11.5 million members. All P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay churches, regardless of denomination, are domestically known as አብያተ ክርስቲያናት (Abiate kristianat&#x27; or ābiyate kirisitīyanati&#x27;) meaning &#x27;churches&#x27; in the senses of a &#x27;community of Christians&#x27; in Amharic, the official working federal language of Ethiopia. Most of these denominations also operate ministries, colleges and bible societies like the Ethiopian Graduate School of Theology, Golden Oil Ministries, Evangelical Theological College, the Ethiopian Bible Society and Meserete Kristos College. These churches often work together by exchanging preachers and organizing church conferences.

=== Statistics ===
According to the 2005 statistics from the World Christian Database, Ethiopian Pentecostal/Charismatic members cover a bit over 16 percent of the country as P&#x27;ent&#x27;ays of Ethiopia. The individual groups are the Word of Life Church (Kale Heywet) Church, Mekane Yesus, Churches of Christ, Misgana Church of Ethiopia, Assembly of God, Hiwot Berhan Church, Emnet Kristos, Meserete Kristos, Light of Life Church, Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel Believers Church) and other churches constituting slightly over 12 million P&#x27;ent&#x27;ays in Ethiopia. However, according to World Christian Encyclopedia, the Evangelical Protestant community is down to only 13.6% of Ethiopian population. According to the 1994 government census, Protestant Christians comprise 10% of the population (about 7–8 million today). According to membership and adherent records provided by the various churches and denominations, Ethiopian Protestants claim as high as 18.59% of the country&#x27;s population which is inline with the recent data from the US Department of State.

==Beliefs==
Evangelicals in Ethiopia and Eritrea believe that one is saved by believing in Jesus as Lord and Saviour for the forgiveness of sins. They believe in the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the one essence of the Trinity. Like all other Christian groups that accept the canonical gospels, P&#x27;ent&#x27;ays also believe in being &quot;born again&quot; (&quot;dagem meweled&quot;), as it is written numerous times in the Gospel of John, and demonstrated by one&#x27;s baptism in the Holy Spirit as well as water baptism. Speaking in tongues is seen as one of the signs, but not the only sign, of &quot;receiving Christ&quot;, which should include a new lifestyle and social behavior.

Although almost all Evangelical Protestant branches in Ethiopia and Eritrea have one or two theological differences or different approaches in the interpretation of the Bible, all of the four major branches follow the beliefs common to born-again Christians. The four major denominations also exchange pastors (&quot;megabi&quot;) and allow the preachers to serve in different churches when invited (full communion). All of the four main churches and others also share and listen to various gospel singers, &quot;mezmur&quot; (gospel music or hymn) producers and choirs.

==History==
Peter Heyling was the first Protestant missionary in Ethiopia, and is regarded as the founding father of the P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay or Wenigēlawī movement.

For the most part, Ethiopian and Eritrean Protestants state that their form of Christianity is both the reformation of the current Orthodox Tewahedo churches as well as the restoration of it to the original Ethiopian Christianity. They believe Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity was paganized after the 960s, during the reign of queen Gudit, who destroyed and burned most of the church&#x27;s possessions and scriptures. They claim those events have led to the gradual paganization of the Oriental Orthodox Churches which they say is now merely dominated by rituals, hearsay and fables. P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay Christians use the alleged &quot;secularized teaching&quot; of the current Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox churches, the alleged inability of most Orthodox followers to live according to the instructions of the Bible and the deuterocanonical books used by rural priests, as a proof to their belief in the Orthodox Tewahedo teaching is also mainly syncretized. P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay Christians use the history of the Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity prior to the 1960s as their own history, despite lacking historical continuity.

It was only during the early 20th century that American and European missionaries spread Protestantism with Mennonite and Pentecostal churches through the Sudan Interior Mission (SIM). When the SIM continued its movement after a brief ban during Ethiopia&#x27;s war with Italy, it is written that the missionaries were taken aback by the fruits of their initial mission. Protestant Christians still face persecution in rural regions and are assisted by the Voice of the Martyrs; however, there is a growing tolerance between the Ethiopian Orthodox, Muslims and the growing population of P&#x27;en&#x27;tay Christians in the urban areas of the country. With the dominance of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and the growing Muslim population, the population of P&#x27;en&#x27;tay Christians was estimated around 16.15 million (19 percent of total population), according to the information released by the U.S. Department of State.

== Obstacles ==
===Confusion with non-affiliates===
Recent misidentification of certain groups as &quot;P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay&quot; has caused confusion. One controversy involves Oneness Pentecostalism and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, which are strictly opposed by the other Protestant denominations.

The metropolitan &quot;sui iuris&quot; Eastern Catholic particular churches of the Eritrean Catholic Church and Ethiopian Catholic Church are not &quot;P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay (Evangelical Protestant)&quot; churches but some Orthodox Tewahedo adherents have used the term P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay as a pejorative by conflating and &#x27;othering&#x27; them with P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay (Evangelical Protestants)&quot;.&quot;

===Persecution===
According to Voice of the Martyrs there have been brutal killings of P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay Christians in rural areas that tend to be overlooked by the Ethiopian rural officials and stay undisclosed to international organizations. Some Oriental Orthodox families expel children out of their house if the children convert to Protestantism. Since the majority population is Orthodox, Voice of the Martyrs claims no criminal investigations are carried out against Oriental Orthodox mobs who burn Evangelical churches, destroy houses and even murder P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay Christians.

Voice of the Martyrs also states that Evangelical Christians have been murdered by Islamic militants because they wouldn&#x27;t renounce their faith in Christ. Islamic militants have stopped at least one bus (near Jijiga, a rural area) and demanded Christians recite the Islamic creed, killing those who refuse. The mostly rural churches like Kale Heywet have historically faced persecution with aggressors often doing so with impunity. During the previous 1970s and 1980s government, persecution was equally severe in the urban cities as well, with the likes of Mulu Wongel church (Full Gospel) and Mesereke Kristos Church facing widespread persecution and mass imprisonments and killings. Lacking western ties, the Mulu Wongel church was outlawed by the Derg Ethiopian government.

More persecution followed Ethiopian Protestants for more than a decade. However, after a change of government, religious equality including the right to worship, build churches and evangelize were restored. Minor and rural issues still exist. Despite these issues, compared to the past, the 1990s have brought the most freedom of religion in Ethiopia. Most of the Evangelical churches, especially Mulu Wongel, Assemblies of God, and Kale Heywet, faced persecution and detentions by previous governments. The state sponsored persecution of Protestants by the 1980s government created what some scholars call an &quot;invisible church&quot; and an underground evangelism where the membership of these churches drastically increased despite this era of persecution.

Since the early 1990s, persecution has mostly ceased, particularly in the cities and areas near the cities, and there is a growing level of tolerance between Evangelical Christians and other religious groups. The ruling party however established a Faith and Religious Affairs Directorate (similar to those in China) to issue licenses, to demand loyalty, and to infiltrate hierarchies of Christian and Islamic institutions. Even though it is not comparable to the state sponsored persecution of the past, P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay Christians in Ethiopia still face persecution from private citizens in Muslim dominated rural areas. Despite Ethiopia&#x27;s well-known religious tolerance, culture related acceptance issues and the growth of some Evangelical churches have also led to some violence, especially as non-Orthodox Christians and Muslims seek to gain equal economic and social status as the traditionally privileged Orthodox Christians.

New challenges Christians face in Ethiopia include the Islamic fundamentalism movement mostly coming from radical Islamist organizations or followers of an extreme form of Wahhabist Islam coming from Saudi Arabia-linked Muslim Non-governmental organizations and projects. In Eritrea, torture is used against Protestant Christians, more than 2000 Christians are subject to arrest (2006). The U. S. state department names it a Country of Particular Concern due to its violation of religious liberty. It has been reported that entire families are thrown into jail. According to the Barnabas Fund, in April 2010 a 28-year-old student died after she was held in a metal shipping container for 2 years, after being arrested for attending a Bible study.

== Hymns ==

Music, more technically speaking &quot;hymns&quot; or &quot;psalms&quot; (&quot;Mezmur&quot; — መዝሙር – in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia, and also in other Ethiopian-Eritrean languages as well) plays a big role in preaching and the daily life of P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay/Evangelical Christians. With the belief that music should be for God, and him alone, Ethiopian &quot;mezmur&quot; does not have ethnic or cultural boundaries, nor restriction on what style or instruments to use. However, there are apparent influences from American evangelicals that have led to commercialization and cross-overs. CD, cassette and DVD sales are now one of the rare Ethiopian industries on the rise.
===History of P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay music===
Even though some of the older generation of singers didn&#x27;t have the financial means to make cassettes, they have influenced Ethiopian music in various ways while singing in local churches. Some of the early singers are Addisu Worku, Leggesse Watro, the Araya Family who used to sing on Misrach Dimts Radio.

Mekane Yesus Church led the way in translating hymnals from the Swedish and adapting from Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. In the early 1970s the Meserete Kristos Church Choir was established. Some from Tsion Choir from Mulu Wongel joined the newly established choir and Meserete Kristos continued developing songs in Ethiopian languages. During these early years, other groups like Bethel singers also produced Ethiopian gospel songs.

===Early comers===
Some of the early comers were Mulu Wongel and Meserete Kristos choirs, which now have up to Choir E and F, with each having 8, 9 albums. Some of these churches in other branch cities have stopped using single letters for choir names, and applied names instead. Other early comers Mekane Yesus church choir, Mulu Wengel church choir, Meserete Kristos church (MKC) choir arrived around the 1970s. Solo vocalists developed fast in these and other churches. Addisu Worku, Dereje Kebede, Tamrat Walba, Tesfaye Gabisso, Eyerusalem Teshome, Tamerate Haile, Tadesse Eshete, Gizachew Worku, Atalay Alem and Shewaye Damte fill in some of this list that started early.

===Modern===
Some of the late 20th century singers include Kalkidan Tilahun (Lily) of Qale Hiywet Church, Ahavah Gospel Singers, Dagmawi Tilahun (Dagi) of Mulu Wongel Church and Elias Abebe of the Assemblies of God church. Others are Awtaru Kebede, Sophia Shibabaw, Mesfin Gutu, Mihiret Itefa, Lealem Tilahun (Lali), Gezahegn Muse, Azeb Hailu and many more. There are also singers who are pastors, some of them are Dawit Molalign, Kasshaun Lemma and Yohannes Girma. Oromo language singers like Kabaa Fidoo, Abbabaa Tamesgeen, Iyoob Yaadataa, Baacaa Bayyanaa, Magarsaa Baqqalaa, Dastaa Insarmuu, Bilisee Karrasaa, and others have also served Evangelical Churches in southwestern Ethiopia. In the Tigrinya language, there are singers like Yonas Haile, Mihret Gebretatios, Selam Hagos, Ruth Mekuria, Yemane Habte, and Adhanom Teklemariam and duos like Yonatan and Sosuna. Introducing new styles are young performers like Dawit &quot;Danny&quot; Wolde who studied at Berklee College of Music.

Classical and instrumental gospel songs have also flourished with Fikru Aligaz and Bethel Music Ministry. Also, Fikru Aligaz has been providing a three-day praise and worship service with the Bethel Praise &amp; Worship Choir to reach local Christian and Non-Christian members of the community twice a year since 1998. Duos like Aster &amp; Endalkachewu or Geta Yawkal &amp; Berektawit bring more variety. Also, formerly secular singers like Hirut Bekele, Solomon Disasa and Muluken have produced gospel songs after they convert and become born-again Christians. There are many music composers in P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay church like Christian Girma (currently living in Denver, Colorado), Ebenezer Girma, Enku Girma, Nathanael Befikadu, Biruk Bedru, Daniel Ewnetu, Bereket Tesfaye, Samson Tamrat, Yabets Tesema, Ameha Mekonen, Endalkachew Hawaz, Estifanos Mengistu, and there are countless church music players. Digital music composition is used and there are more than twenty Christian music studios in Ethiopia, including CMM, TDS, COMNS, Sami, Nati, Langanoo, Begena, Kinnei, Albastor, Shalom, Exodus, and Bethlehem.

There are also gospel singers who sing in Wolayta, Hadiya-Kambata, Sidama, and other areas of the South.

==== Modern musical controversy within the Church ====
Some of the most famous music players in Ethiopia like Elias Melka, played in Evangelical churches has subsequently converted to secular music. Some modern singers often mimic American Evangelical artists, allegedly including other lifestyles that are not genuine depictions of traditional Ethiopian Evangelicalism. The tradition of local church group choirs, has to an extent been supplanted by individual solo singers who have controversially gained celebrity status with their lifestyles often resembling secular celebrities.

<text>Laddio Bolocko was a noise rock band from New York City, formed in 1996 by members of Panicsville and the Dazzling Killmen. Their sound has drawn comparisons to experimental rock groups such as This Heat and Can and free jazz musicians like Albert Ayler. The band favored limited releases, offering only small pressings of their original albums. They toured internationally, recording and releasing the EP &quot;As if by Remote&quot; in Europe only.

After disbanding in 2000, Armstrong and St. Ivany formed a new noise rock band, The Psychic Paramount, while Fleming and DeGrazia formed Electric Turn to Me. No Quarter Records released the anthology of Laddio Bolocko in 2003, compiling all three original releases for the first time widely available to the listening public. They were featured in a David Cross DVD entitled &quot;&quot;Let America Laugh&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="882160" wikidata="Q4672732" url="?curid=882160" title="Accordion effect">
<text>In physics, the accordion effect (also known as the slinky effect, concertina effect, elastic band effect, and string instability) occurs when fluctuations in the motion of a traveling body cause disruptions in the flow of elements following it. This can happen in road traffic, foot marching, bicycle and motor racing, and, in general, to processes in a pipeline. These are examples of nonlinear processes. The accordion effect generally decreases the throughput of the system in which it occurs.

== In traffic ==

The accordion effect in road traffic refers to the typical decelerations and accelerations of a vehicle when the vehicle in front decelerates and accelerates. These fluctuations in speed propagate backwards and typically get bigger and bigger further down the line, resulting in reduced throughput of road traffic. For this reason, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration recommends that each driver should try to follow the accelerations of the vehicle in front closely, and keeping a steady gap that is neither too small or large. Too small gaps and sudden braking can lead to rear ending.

== In motorsports ==
In the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix, an accordion effect after the restart under the safety car caused five of the last cars in the field to crash. Data analysis of the crash showed that each consecutive driver accelerated faster and faster, and also that each consecutive driver braked later and later.

<doc id="882162" wikidata="Q1424609" url="?curid=882162" title="Kettle (landform)">
<text>A kettle (also known as a kettle hole, kettlehole, or pothole) is a depression or hole in an outwash plain formed by retreating glaciers or draining floodwaters. The kettles are formed as a result of blocks of dead ice left behind by retreating glaciers, which become surrounded by sediment deposited by meltwater streams as there is increased friction. The ice becomes buried in the sediment and when the ice melts, a depression is left called a kettle hole, creating a dimpled appearance on the outwash plain. Lakes often fill these kettles; these are called kettle hole lakes. Another source is the sudden drainage of an ice-dammed lake and when the block melts, the hole it leaves behind is a kettle. As the ice melts, ramparts can form around the edge of the kettle hole. The lakes that fill these holes are seldom more than deep and eventually fill with sediment. In acidic conditions, a kettle bog may form but in alkaline conditions, it will be kettle peatland.

==Overview==

Kettles are fluvioglacial landforms occurring as the result of blocks of ice calving from the front of a receding glacier and becoming partially to wholly buried by glacial outwash. Glacial outwash is generated when streams of meltwater flow away from the glacier and deposit sediment to form broad outwash plains called sandurs. When the ice blocks melt, kettle holes are left in the sandur. When the development of numerous kettle holes disrupt sandur surfaces, a jumbled array of ridges and mounds form, resembling kame and kettle topography. Kettle holes can also occur in ridge shaped deposits of loose rock fragments called till.

Kettle holes can form as the result of floods caused by the sudden drainage of an ice-dammed lake. These floods, called jökulhlaups, often rapidly deposit large quantities of sediment onto the sandur surface. The kettle holes are formed by the melting blocks of sediment-rich ice that were transported and consequently buried by the jökulhlaups. It was found in field observations and laboratory simulations done by Maizels in 1992 that ramparts form around the edge of kettle holes generated by jökulhlaups. The development of distinct types of ramparts depends on the concentration of rock fragments contained in the melted ice block and on how deeply the block was buried by sediment.

Most kettle holes are less than two kilometres in diameter, although some in the U.S. Midwest exceed ten kilometres. Puslinch Lake in Ontario, Canada, is the largest kettle lake in Canada spanning . Fish Lake in the north-central Cascade Mountains of the U.S. state of Washington is .

The depth of most kettles is less than ten meters. In most cases, kettle holes eventually fill with water, sediment, or vegetation. If the kettle is fed by surface or underground rivers or streams, it becomes a kettle lake. If the kettle receives its water from precipitation, the groundwater table, or a combination of the two, it is termed a kettle pond or kettle wetland, if vegetated. Kettle ponds that are not affected by the groundwater table will usually become dry during the warm summer months, in which case they are deemed ephemeral.

==Bogs==
If water in a kettle becomes acidic due to decomposing organic plant matter, it becomes a kettle bog; or, if underlying soils are lime-based and neutralize the acidic conditions somewhat, it becomes a kettle peatland. Kettle bogs are closed ecosystems because they have no water source other than precipitation. Acidic kettle bogs and fresh water kettles are important ecological niches for some symbiotic species of flora and fauna.

The Kettle Moraine, a region of Wisconsin covering an area from Green Bay to south-central Wisconsin, has numerous kettles, moraines and other glacial features. It has many kettle lakes, some of which are 100 to deep.

==Examples==
The Prairie Pothole Region extends from northern Alberta, Canada to Iowa, United States and includes thousands of small sloughs and lakes.

<doc id="882164" wikidata="Q796444" url="?curid=882164" title="BMW 5 Series (E12)">
<text>The BMW E12 is the first generation of 5 Series executive cars, which was produced from 1972 to 1981 and replaced the saloon models of the BMW New Class range.

Initial models were powered by inline-four engines, using either a carburettor or fuel-injection. A year after launch, the first model powered by a straight-six engine was introduced. By the final years of E12 production, most models used a straight-six engine.

There was no M5 model for the E12, however the E12 M535i is considered to be the predecessor to the M5. The E24 6 Series coupés were built on the E12 platform up until 1982. The E12 was replaced by the E28 5 Series in 1981, although the tools were sent to South Africa where E12 assembly continued (with E28 interiors) until 1984.

== Development ==

At the 1970 Geneva Motor Show, BMW unveiled the 2200ti Garmisch concept car, a 2-door saloon which was developed in conjunction with Bertone. The 2200ti Garmisch concept car was shown as a potential replacement for the New Class saloons and the eventual E12 production model utilized many design elements from the Garmisch.

Development of the E12-series had begun by the end of the 1960s, when wind tunnel tests were conducted. Eberhard von Kuenheim, then chairman of BMW&#x27;s supervisory board, hired French designer Paul Bracq in 1970 to work as the E12&#x27;s Chief of design, with Marcello Gandini of Bertone as co-designers of the exterior.

In 1971, a road-legal E12 prototype, which looked similar to a Fiat 132, was made. Also in 1971, Paul Bracq had finalised the E12&#x27;s design, however, compared with the later series production E12, Bracq&#x27;s design car had a more stretched, and dynamic appearance. Computers were used in BMW development for the first time to calculate front and rear crumple zones; the roof was designed with a rollover protection structure. The body has a drag coefficient of 0.44. BMW had previously located turn signal stalks on the right hand side of the steering wheels, and the E12 was their first model to have the stalk on the left side.

Before the E12 had been introduced, there were rumours that it would be available with both a 2.2 litre four-cylinder engine, and a small six-cylinder engine. Instead, BMW carried over the 2-litre four-cylinder M10 engines from the &quot;New Class&quot; saloons, but modified the cylinder heads in order to improve combustion. With the introduction of the E12-series in 1972, BMW offered two models, the carburetted 520, which had a Stromberg constant pressure carburettor, and the manifold injected 520i, which came with a Kugelfischer PL 04 injection pump. A small six-cylinder model called &quot;523&quot; had been developed, but was never put into series production. Eventually, the small six-cylinder model &quot;520&quot; was put into production in 1977, but in a 2-litre version rather than a 2.3 litre version.

Originally, four-cylinder cars have a bonnet with a sunken central portion whereas on six-cylinder cars this section is raised. The leading edge of the bonnet was flat. After the August 1976 facelift all models featured the same bonnet, with a narrow raised central section reaching all the way forward and wrapping around the &quot;kidneys&quot;. M30-engined cars can be identified by the grille having a chrome surround.

To meet Sweden&#x27;s unique and stringent emissions standards, a fuel injected version of the 528 was developed and entered production in June 1977. Called the 528i, this was successful enough that it replaced the 528 in most markets.


== Engines ==

The data above are manufacturer claims. Power and torque data is measured according to the German Standard DIN 70020.

The 518, 520 and 520i models were fitted with the 1.8 L and 2.0 L M10 inline-four engines, as per the previous New Class saloons. The 525, 528, 530, 530i and 533i models were fitted with M30 straight-six engines, as used in the New Six large saloons and E9 coupés. The 520, and 523 (the latter was developed, but never put into series production), use the M20 straight-six engine.

The 518 had its fuel supplied by a Solex 32/32 DIDTA carburetor, while the initial 520 model (powered by the M10 inline-four engine) used twin Stromberg 175CDET carburettors. The straight-six engine 525 and 528 models used dual Zenith INAT two-barrel carburettors up until the 1976 facelift. The straight-six 520 used a Solex 4A1 carburettor.

Fuel-injected models have the letter &quot;i&quot; at the end of their model designation. The 520i used the Kugelfischer mechanical fuel injection system from the 2000tii and 2002tii until 1975. From 1975, it was fitted with a mechanical continuous Bosch K-Jetronic port injection. The 518i (only sold in Sweden and Japan), 528i, and 530i (only sold in the US and Japan) have a Bosch L-Jetronic port injection.

== Suspension ==

The BMW E12 has a self-supporting body, a longitudinally mounted front engine, and rear-wheel drive. All four wheels are suspended independently. The front wheels have MacPherson struts with coil springs, hydraulic shock absorbers, and transverse control arms. The rear axle has semi-trailing arms with coil springs, and hydraulic shock absorbers. Models with a power output of or more have an additional sway bar on the rear axle. All models except the M535i have 14-inch steel alloy wheels with a wheel-width of either 5.5 or 6 inches. Therefore, the tyre size is either 175 mm or 195 mm. All models use worm and sector steering, which is power assisted from the 528 onwards. The braking system is a dual-circuit system with front disc brakes; on the rear wheels, 518/520/i models were fitted with drum brakes, all models from the 525 onwards have disc brakes.

== Drivetrain ==
The 4-speed manual transmission options consisted of:
* Getrag 242 4-speed (for M10/M20/M30 engine models)
* Getrag 262 4-speed (M30 engine)
* ZF S4-18/3 4-speed (M30 engine)

The 5-speed manual transmission options consisted of:
* Getrag 235 5-speed (M10 engine)
* Getrag 245 5-speed (M10/M20 engines)
* Getrag 265 5-speed (M30 engine)

The automatic transmission options—all 3-speed transmissions—consisted of:
* ZF 3HP12 (M10 engine)
* ZF 3HP20 (M30 engine)
* ZF 3HP22 (M20/M30 engines)
* BorgWarner BW65 (M30 engine)

== Special models ==
On the Belgian and Greek markets, there was a BMW 518 Deluxe version. One thousand of these cars were sold in 1979–1980. This was a BMW 518 equipped as the 528i top model with additional luxury items such as headrests on the back seats. It was rumored that this special version was produced for the Iranian government, as a car for top officials under the shah&#x27;s rule. Due to the Iranian revolution these cars were never delivered. Instead, they have been sold as a special version in Belgium and Greece.

The Portuguese market also received nearly 700 CKD units due to the local regulations that demanded a certain number of vehicles sold in Portugal to be locally assembled.

For the Swedish market the complete BMW 5 range was not offered, due to local emissions regulations. For the early E12 the models BMW 518, BMW 520, BMW 520i, and BMW 525 were offered - with the BMW 528 missing. The series 2 range of was reduced to three models: BMW 518i, BMW 520i and BMW 528i. The 528i became available as a result of Switzerland having adopted the same emissions rules, making it worthwhile to develop such a version. Unique to the Swedish market were a BMW 518i and a BMW 520i, fitted with the identical 2 litre engine, but the BMW 518i receiving poorer equipment. The BMW 520i was fitted with chromed wheel rings and a locking fuel cap. It was also fitted with head restraints in the rear, an armrest in the middle of the rear bench, steering wheel height adjustment, seat height adjustment for the drivers seat, a wooden shifter knob, and a rear heater.

=== Motorsport versions ===
Beginning in 1974, BMW M (then called &#x27;BMW Motorsport&#x27;) offered the &quot;Motorsport 530&quot;, &quot;Motorsport 530i&quot; and &quot;Motorsport 533i&quot; as special order upgrades for the 525, 528 and 528i models. The Motorsport 530 used the carburetted engine from the BMW 3.0S, the Motorsport 530i used the fuel-injected engine from the BMW 3.0Si and the Motorsport 533i used the injected 3.2-liter engine from the E24 633CSi. Other modifications were a shorter differential ratio of (3.45:1 for the 530 and 3.25:1 for the 530i), a 25% LSD, vented disc brakes, Bilstein shock absorbers, Scheel or Recaro sports seats, a sports steering wheel, alloy wheels on lower profile tyres, and optional front and rear spoilers.

Later, the similar &quot;Motorsport 535i&quot; package was available for the 525i/528i model, consisting of the 3.5L engine from the E24 635CSi.

=== M535i ===

The first M-badged 5 Series was the M535i, which began production in 1980. The M535i is powered by the M90 straight-six engine which produces . The sole gearbox choice is a 5-speed manual and 1,650 M535i cars were produced (including 240 CKD for South Africa). Features include optional front and rear spoilers, optional M-striping, sports suspension, Recaro sport seats, the steering wheel from the BMW M1, a dogleg close-ratio transmission, a limited-slip differential and larger brakes.

The M535i is considered to be the predecessor to the BMW M5 model, which has been produced since the E28 generation.

=== Alpina B7 ===

The Alpina &quot;B7 Turbo&quot; and &quot;B7 S Turbo&quot; were based on the E12.

=== 530 MLE ===
In South Africa, the 530 MLE was produced as a homologation special for racing, with 218 cars produced. The engine is a M30, producing . Significant weight reduction measures were undertaken, included body panels made from aluminium or thinner steel.
== Model year changes ==
1974
* 518 and 528 models introduced, producing and respectively.. Motorsport upgrades available as special order in 530, 530i or 533i guise.

1975
* On the 520i model, Kugelfischer injection was replaced by Bosch K Jetronic.

1976 facelift

With the introduction of the E23 7 Series, the E12 received a facelift in September 1976. The styling was overseen by Claus Luthe. The rear-mounted gasoline filler door was relocated to the side of the car and the taillights were widened. The hood was redesigned to a give a &#x27;power bulge&#x27; which accentuated the BMW kidney grille, and the dashboard ventilation was repositioned to improve air distribution.

As part of the facelift, the 520 model switched from the M10 inline-four engine to the BMW M20 straight-six engine, with the post-facelift 520 model often referred to as the 520/6. However, the M10 engine continued to be used in South Africa, due to local content laws. Even after the M20 entered local production in 1979, the 2.0-litre M10 continued to be available with &quot;518&quot; badges in South Africa. In other markets the only inline-four M10 post-facelift model available was the 1.8-litre 518 which carried on as the base model until the end of production.

For the 525 and 528 models, the dual Zenith carburettors were replaced with a single Solex 4A1 DVG four-barrel, which increased power to in the 528.

1978
* The 528i model, using Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection, begins production in July as a replacement for the carburetted 528 which was discontinued in September 1977.

1979
* 535i Motorsport available as special order only

1980
* M535i model introduced

== North American models ==
Initially, the only model sold in the United States was the 530i, which was powered by a fuel-injected straight-six engine. Changes for American-market E12s include lower compression pistons, exhaust gas recirculation, an air pump and modified exhaust manifolds called Thermal Reactors. The North American E12 models had larger bumpers (designed to withstand a collision without body damage), which increased the overall length by .

For the 1979 model year, the 528i replaced the 530i. To reduce emissions, the thermal reactor and air pump system were replaced with a 3-way catalytic converter and the car&#x27;s Bosch L-jetronic fuel injection system was now fitted with an exhaust gas oxygen sensor. Power was reduced by , and the presence of the catalytic converter meant that unleaded gasoline (petrol) was required.

==South African models==
In South Africa, the E12 was introduced in March 1974, imported fully knocked-down and assembled in Rosslyn by BMW South Africa with a separate VIN number (starting with ABM). The facelift model arrived a bit later than in Europe, in February 1977. Only a limited range of engines were available, to minimize costs and to help meet local parts requirements, with most engine options being the carburetted versions. In spite of widespread sanctions, locally built E12s also saw some export, the 520 being sent to Argentina and the 518 De Luxe to Belgium, Iran, and Italy.

To keep costs down, BMW chose to continue building the E12 in South Africa after the E28 had been introduced elsewhere, with the body now pressed and manufactured locally. Called the E12/8, this model received the new E28 interior and all fuel injected engines, tuned with fuel economy in mind. At the exterior, it received a chrome strip around the entire front grille. This model continued to be manufactured until September 1985, after which the next generation was finally introduced to South Africa. In total, 23,100 of the E12/8 were built; the models offered were the 518i, 520i, 528i, and M535i.

== Critical reception ==
While being commended for its acceleration and build-quality, &quot;Modern Motor&quot; criticised the 1978 528i for unpredictable handling and excessive body roll. Steering corrections during cornering meant the car&#x27;s body &quot;lurches back annoyingly and messily&quot;, in part due to the soft springing and hard damping combination. In comparison to the Jaguar XJ6 and Peugeot 604, the car was viewed as narrow and cramped in the rear and prone to wind noise.

== Production ==
Production of the E12 occurred from June 1972 to 1981, with a total of 699,094 cars produced. Initially, the cars were produced in Munich, West Germany. Following the opening of the new BMW Group Plant Dingolfing in September 1973, production was phased over to the Dingolfing plant.

Complete knock-down assembly of German-produced kits took place in Rosslyn, South Africa; Jakarta, Indonesia (by Gaya Motor); and Thailand.

<doc id="882166" wikidata="Q730915" url="?curid=882166" title="BMW 3 Series (E21)">
<text>The BMW E21 is the first generation of the BMW 3 Series, a range of compact executive cars. The E21 was produced from June 1975 to December 1983 and replaced the BMW 02 Series. The series was exclusively built in a two-door coupé body style (except for convertibles made by Baur). Contrary to its predecessor, a &#x27;Touring&#x27; body with a sloped rear hatch was no longer offered.

Initial models were produced with carburetted four-cylinder petrol engines of 1.6 L, 1.8 L, and 2.0 L. Fuel-injection was introduced in late 1975 on the 320i – but in 1977, a carburetted inline 6-cylinder engine replaced both the 320 and 320i models, while a detuned version of the four-cylinder injection went on sale in the United States. In 1978, the 3-series received its first fuel-injected six-cylinder in the 323i as a flagship performance model; and in 1981, a bottom end detuned 1.6 L was offered in the 315.

The cabriolet body style, manufactured by Baur, was produced from 1978 to 1981, with all available engines.

There was no BMW M3 model for the E21 generation, but several limited edition models were produced based on the model with the largest engine, the six-cylinder 323i.

The E21 was replaced by the E30 3 Series in 1982.

==Development==
Under the direction of its majority (51%) shareholder, Herbert Quandt, BMW decided upon a replacement for the ageing BMW 02 Series.

In July 1975, BMW&#x27;s Board of Management introduced the E21 to the public at the Munich Olympic Stadium.

== Styling ==
The frontal view of the new car was dominated by the BMW trademark kidney grille standing out clearly from the radiator cover. The styling of the new car bore a resemblance to the E12 5 Series which was in production as the E21 was introduced. Like many other BMW models, the C-pillar of the E21 has a Hofmeister kink.

Paul Bracq, Director of Design at BMW from 1970 to 1974, is credited with setting the design direction of the E21.

The BMW E21 is according to the Design Museum London one of &quot;fifty cars that changed the world&quot;.

== Interior ==
The cockpit design of the E21 marked the introduction of a new design concept, with the center console and central dashboard area angled towards the driver. This has become part of BMW&#x27;s interior design philosophy for many years. As a sign of passive safety, all edges and control elements within the interior were rounded off and padded.

== Engines ==

=== 315 ===

The 315 was the base model from March 1981 to 1983 and remained on sale up into 1984 for some markets, alongside the new E30. It has a version of the 316&#x27;s 1.6-litre engine, tuned for fuel economy. It accelerates to 100 km/h in 14.8 seconds and has a top speed of .&lt;ref name=&quot;TAM82/83.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to further lower the price, the 315 also had bumpers with exposed screws, a vinyl-covered parcel shelf (this was carpeted on all other E21 models), no map pockets on the doors, R2 double filament headlamps (rather than halogen units), and a single external mirror.

=== 316 ===
The 316 was the base model for years 1975 to 1981, fitted with a M10 engine producing . It accelerates to in 14 seconds and has a top speed of .

In 1980 the engine size increased to 1.8 litres (after the 318 carburetor version was discontinued), while the model badge remained &quot;316&quot;. Power remained but top speed increased to .

=== 318 ===
The 318 was a mid-range model that was powered by a carburetted four-cylinder engine, producing . It accelerates to 100 km/h in 12 seconds and has a top speed of .

=== 318i ===
In 1980, the carburetted 318 was dropped and replaced by the fuel injected 318i. It accelerates to 100 km/h in 11.5 seconds and has a top speed of .

In Sweden, the 318i was badged 320i and had twin headlights. This was the result of the 2-liter engine not passing Sweden&#x27;s particular emissions standards at the time, which also restricted the output of the engine to in Sweden as well as Switzerland.

=== 320 ===
The initial 320 model was powered by a four-cylinder engine using a Solex 2-barrel downdraft carburettor. It accelerates to in 11.5 seconds and has a top speed of .

=== 320i ===
The 320i was released in late 1975. It has a continuous port injection system (Bosch K-Jetronic) instead of a carburetor. It accelerates to in 10.5 seconds and has a top speed of .

=== 320/6 ===
In 1977, the 320 model switched from the BMW M10 four-cylinder engine to the BMW M20 straight-six petrol engine. Although they remained badged as &quot;320&quot;, the six-cylinder model is often referred to as &quot;320/6&quot;. The engine uses a Solex 4-barrel downdraft carburetor. The 320/6 accelerates to in 10.0 seconds and has a top speed of .

=== 323i ===
The 323i was the flagship E21 performance model following its introduction in 1977. It is powered by a 2.3-litre six-cylinder engine using Bosch K-Jetronic fuel-injection. It accelerates to in 8.7 seconds and has a top speed of . 

== Transmissions ==
* 3-speed &quot;ZF 3HP22&quot; automatic (318 and 320)
* 4-speed &quot;Getrag 242&quot; manual
* 5-speed &quot;Getrag 245&quot; manual, with either an overdrive fifth gear or close-ratio gearing (the latter available from 1976).

== Chassis and suspension==
With a wheelbase measuring , the lengths of the overhanging front and rear bodywork was minimal. The track measured at the front, and at the rear.

The suspension incorporated rack and pinion steering and MacPherson strut suspension at the front, and semi-trailing arm type independent suspension at the rear. The rear suspension design causes camber changes, which can introduce &quot;snap oversteer&quot; at the handling limits. The power assisted brakes were discs on the front wheels, while the rear wheels had drum brakes (except the 323i model which had discs all round).

== Model year changes ==
At the E21&#x27;s release, three models were available: with 316 (1.6-litre), 318 (1.8-litre) and 320 (2.0-litre) versions of the BMW M10 four-cylinder engine. To differentiate between models, the 320 model came with dual headlights, while the 316 and 318 had single headlights.

=== 1975 ===
The fuel-injected 320i was introduced at the end of 1975. It has the M10 four-cylinder engine with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection, and a limited slip differential was available as an option.

=== 1977 ===
At the 1977 International Auto Show in Frankfurt, BMW unveiled its new variants of the E21, featuring the new BMW M20 six-cylinder engines (which were initially called &quot;M60&quot;).

The four-cylinder 320 model was replaced with the 320/6, featuring a 2.0 litre version of the M20 engine. The new range-topping 323i model was introduced, featuring 2.3 L with , which gave the 323i a top speed of . The braking system was also upgraded, with the 323i featuring disc brakes on all wheels. Options include power steering, a 5-speed close-ratio &#x27;dogleg&#x27; sport gearbox, and 25% limited slip differential.

=== 1980 ===
For the 1980 model year, the four-cylinder models were upgraded: the 1.8 L carburetted M10 unit was revised to produce and entered the market in the updated 316, while a fuel-injected version of the 1.8 L M10 was introduced in the 318i model (which replaced the carburetted 318 as the mid-range model). This fuel-injected 1.8 L M10 was also sold in Sweden with 320i badging (with a higher level of standard equipment to distinguish it from the 318i), because the 320/6 was never certified for sale there.

=== 1981 ===
The economy model 315 was introduced as a reaction to the second &quot;oil crisis&quot; in late 1979. More spartan than the other E21 models, it was the last E21 to be built and produced alongside the early E30 models.

== Baur TopCabriolet ==

A cabriolet conversion was offered by Karosserie Baur, called the TopCabriolet. It consisted of a targa roof and an independent rear soft-top. The targa roof section was designed to fit in the trunk, while the boot cover doubled as a cover for the plastic rear window, protecting it from scratches and frost in winter. Production of the TopCabriolet began in 1978 and all engine options were available.

The cars were sold via the BMW dealership network and all Baur models included the BMW warranty. A total of 4,595 vehicles were manufactured before production ended in 1981.
== North American models ==
The E21 was sold as the 320i in the United States from model years 1977 to 1983, first as a four-cylinder with a 2.0-liter engine, and from 1980 with a 1.8 liter version of the same. Six-cylinder models were not sold in America, because the E21 versions of the M20 engine did not meet U.S. emissions regulations at the time. The 320i models sold in the United States have a thermal reactor as a pollution control device. U.S. models came standard with air conditioning.

From 1977 to 1979, the U.S. models were powered by a fuel-injected version of the M10 four-cylinder engine. In August 1979, from the 1980 model year, 320i was now powered by a downsized version of the M10 four-cylinder engine. This resulted in a acceleration time of 11.1 seconds and a top speed of .

Due to American regulations, the following changes were required:
* larger front and rear &quot;diving board&quot; bumper bars, which increased the car&#x27;s overall length by to .
* sealed beam headlights, larger indicator lights and side reflectors
* speedometer in miles-per-hour
* fuel gauge markings changed from litres to &quot;full, ½, reserve&quot;
* a detuned version of the M10 engine, initially using a thermal reactor to control exhaust emissions
* in 1980, the engine was downsized from 2.0 L to 1.8 L and the thermal reactor was replaced with a catalytic converter.

The optional &quot;S Package&quot; (320iS) was introduced in 1981 and sacrificed the factory air conditioning, but offered Recaro sport seats, upgraded suspension in the form of a rear anti-roll bar and a stiffer front anti-roll bar, a 5-speed transmission and limited-slip differential, cross-spoke alloy wheels, a larger and more extensive tool kit, a dual operation manual sunroof, an AM/FM Blaupunkt radio with cassette player, fog lights, a 3-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel and leather shift knob, a front air dam, a &quot;delete&quot; of the alphanumeric 320i markers on the rear trunk lid, a central-dash storage area where A/C controls were otherwise placed, and a limited color palette of white, silver or black. Just 2,500 320iS&#x27;s were produced.
== Production ==
Production of the E21 began in June 1975 and finished in December 1983. Total production was 1,364,039 cars, of which 4,595 were in “Baur Top cabriolet” trim.

== Motorsports ==

The Group 5 version of the BMW 320 introduced in 1977 as a replacement to the BMW 3.0 CSL, nicknamed the &quot;Flying Brick&quot; in reference to the blocky bodyshape, was powered by a Formula Two engine that was tuned to by BMW Motorsport. The car was developed in only just over 12 weeks, without technical drawings. BMW Motorsport engineers simply carried out the modifications directly, with the car progressively taking its final shape.

The Group 5 320 was also used by the McLaren team in the American International Motor Sports Association series. It was also used by the BMW Junior Team, whose drivers included Manfred Winkelhock, Eddie Cheever, and Marc Surer. The 320 won its first race, at Zolder in 1977 with Marc Surer at the wheel. It also won the 1981 and 1982 Guia Race of Macau.

<text>The BMW E23 is the first generation of the BMW 7 Series luxury cars and was produced from 1977 until 1986. It was built in a 4-door sedan body style with 6-cylinder engines, to replace the BMW &#x27;New Six&#x27; (E3) sedans. From 1983 until 1986, a turbocharged 6-cylinder engine was available.

In 1986, the E23 was replaced by the E32 7 Series, however, the E23 models (called L7) remained on sale in the United States until 1987.

The E23 introduced many electronic features for the first time in a BMW, including an on-board computer, service interval indicator, a &quot;check control panel&quot; (warning lights to indicate system faults to the driver), a dictaphone and complex climate control systems. It was also the first BMW to offer an anti-lock braking system (ABS), a driver&#x27;s airbag (optional, starting in April 1985) and a new design of front suspension.

== Development and production ==
The initial styling concepts were developed under BMW Design Director Paul Bracq, with Manfred Rennen contributing with the exterior styling.

Production occurred from 1977 until 1986, during which time 285,029 cars were built.

== Engines ==
All models were powered by a straight-six petrol engine, with the majority of cars using the BMW M30 engine. Most engines were fuel-injected, however the 728 and 730 models of 1978–1979 used a Solex four-barrel carburetor. The fuel-injected models initially used the Bosch L-Jetronic system, until the 1979 732i, which was the first BMW to use the Bosch Motronic fuel-injection system.

== Transmissions ==
The available transmissions consisted of:
* 4-speed manual
* 5-speed manual
* 3-speed automatic
* 4-speed automatic

== Equipment ==
Options included leather upholstery, wood trim, power seats, seat heaters, reclining rear seats, power windows, power mirrors, an in-car cellular telephone and rear-armrest radio controls (only with the executive and highline pack ).

== Yearly changes ==
=== 1983 facelift ===
The 1983 model year facelift (produced from September 1982) included styling changes to the front of the car: wider and more angular &#x27;kidney&#x27; grilles, valance/spoiler, bumper bars, etc. Inside the car, the dashboard and instrument panels were also updated. The rear suspension was updated and the 735i engine changed from the M90 to the M30B34. 

=== 1984 ===
In the US, 1984 saw the arrival of the optional 4-speed automatic transmission (replacing the 3-speed unit previously offered), wood trim replacing the plastic above the glove compartment and on the ashtray and electrically adjustable power seats. Michelin TRX tyres (requiring special metric wheels) became available as an option on the 5-speed manual models.

== Special models ==

=== 725i ===
The 725i model was not officially sold but produced for West German government agencies which, at the time, were not allowed to have engines larger than 2.5 liter in official cars. In the Netherlands, 2/3 of the government ministers had 725i&#x27;s as their car of choice, because it just stayed under the maximum budget where the 728i was definitely over it. In total, 921 units were produced.

===Turbocharged 745i===

The 745i was a high-performance model sold in left-hand-drive European markets from 1979 to 1986. It was initially powered by the M102 engine, which is a turbocharged 3.2 L version of the M30 straight-six engine, producing at of boost. In 1982, the engine was upgraded to the M106, which increased the capacity to 3.4 litres and the fuel injection system changed from Jetronic to Motronic. Boost pressure was reduced to , however power output was unchanged.

All M102 cars were built with a 3-speed ZF 3HP22 automatic transmission. All M106 cars were built with a 4-speed ZF 4HP22 automatic transmission. Options included heated front and rear power reclining seats, gasoline fired heater, leather covered cellular telephone, rear-armrest radio control, water buffalo hide upholstery, and burl wood trim. 

The name 745i comes from the theoretical assumption that turbocharged engines have approximately 1.4 times more power than naturally aspirated engines. By this assumption, a 3.2 litre (3205 cc) turbocharged engine would have similar power to a 4.5 litre (4487 cc) naturally aspirated engine.

===South African 745i===
The South African 745i model was powered by the naturally aspirated M88/3 engine, instead of the turbocharged M102/M106 engines of the European 745i. A right-hand-drive version of the turbocharged model was not possible due to the turbocharger being located in the right-hand side of the engine bay. Instead, the 745i was fitted with the BMW M88 engine, as used in the E24 M635i and E28 M5. The engine uses a 24-valve DOHC valvetrain and the fuel injection system is Bosch ML-Jetronic. 

A production run of 192 South African 745i was built from 1983 to 1987, 175 of which were with an automatic gearbox and 17 with a 5-speed manual gearbox.

BMW South Africa entered one of these 745i models in Class A of the South African Modified Saloon Car Championship The 745i won the championship in 1985, the only BMW-Sanctioned motorsport application in the history of BMW 7 Series cars.

== United States and Japanese market models ==
Only the 733i, 735i, and L7 models were sold in the United States and Japan. These markets also received only upscale versions, usually including leather upholstery, cruise control, wood trim, power windows, power sunroof, and other options as standard. 

North American versions were fitted with larger bumpers (to comply with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards), smaller sealed beam headlights, and various forms of emissions equipment that were not found on European-market cars. The engines used in these markets had lower-compression pistons and thus were less powerful than European-market versions. Some features such as ABS were available in markets outside North America before they were fitted on American models.

The L7 was a more luxurious version of the 735i for the American market only. It featured special leather upholstery with leather dashboard and door padding (rather than wood trim), a power glass Moonroof, and a variety of optional features as standard. All L7 models were built with automatic transmissions and a standard driver&#x27;s air bag.

<doc id="882169" wikidata="Q636732" url="?curid=882169" title="BMW 6 Series (E24)">
<text>The BMW E24 is the first generation of BMW 6 Series range of grand tourer cars, which was produced from January 1976 to 1989 and replaced the BMW E9 coupé.

The E24 was produced solely in a 2-door coupé body style. All models used petrol straight-six engines, with the majority (aside from the M635CSi/M6 model) using a version of the BMW M30 engine family. The E24 shared many parts with the E12 5 series, and in 1982 was updated with parts from the newly released E28 5 series.

The M635CSi is the first of the BMW M6 model line and is powered by the M88/3 straight-six engine. In North America, the vehicle is badged as &quot;M6&quot; and uses the less powerful BMW S38 engine.

The eventual successor to the nameplate, the E63 6 Series, was released in 2004 after a 16-year hiatus. Although the E31 8 Series was introduced as production of the E24 was ending, the 8 Series is considered a separate model line and therefore not a successor to the E24.

== Development and production ==
The E24 was designed by Paul Bracq. Unlike its E9 predecessor, the body of the E24 has a B pillar. The initial proposal for the E24 was based on a BMW E9 3.0 CS with an increased height, in order to make it easier for customers to enter and exit the vehicle. However, Bob Lutz rejected the proposal, eventually leading to the shape of the E24 in its production form.

Production of the 633CSi started in January 1976 with the carburetted 630CS following in February 1976. A total of 86,216 cars were built prior to production ending in April 1989.

Originally the bodies were manufactured by Karmann, but production was later taken in-house to the BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. Early series one E24s in original condition are now quite rare, particularly Karmann assembled cars (look for the Karmann build plate in the left door frame) produced before August 1977.

== Engines ==

Figures in the upper table are for European specification models. The second half of the table covers US (and Canadian, often also as sold in Japan) market specifications.

== Transmissions ==
Initially, the E24 was available with a 4-speed manual transmission (Getrag 262), a 5-speed manual transmission (Getrag 265), or a 3-speed automatic transmission (ZF 3HP22).

In 1983 the automatic transmission was upgraded to a 4-speed ZF 4HP22.

== Suspension and steering ==
Front suspension consists of MacPherson struts and the rear suspension is independent semi-trailing arms. In 1982, the front suspension was upgraded to include twin-pivot lower control arms and the geometry of the rear suspension was revised.

The steering uses a recirculating ball system with power assistance.

== M635CSi / M6 model ==

The M635CSi model, introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1983, is the first in the line of M6 models. In 1987, the equivalent model for the North American (U.S. and Canada) market was introduced and badged simply &#x27;M6&#x27;.

The M635CSi is powered by a version of the BMW M88/3 straight-six engine. The North American M6 vehicle is powered by the detuned version of the BMW S38 straight-six engine, which has a lower compression ratio and uses a catalytic converter.

Over its production run from 1983 through 1989, 5,855 /M6 cars were built, 1,767 of which were for the North American market, and 524 right hand drive cars for the United Kingdom.

== Yearly changes ==
=== 1976 ===
The new 6 Series coupé, using the model code E24, was introduced to the press in March 1976, suggesting production commenced in 1975.

Initially there were two models available: 630 CS and 633 CSI. Karmann constructed the 6 series coupé, as well as the earlier BMW coupés. There were a total of 1665 units of the 630 CS (plus 410 630 CSi, bound for the United States) and 2858 units of the 633 CSi (this number also includes right-hand drive cars) produced in the first year, amongst a total of 4,933 cars produced for the year.

=== 1977 ===
Production of E24 continued in 1977 at Karmann as a complete assembly until August, when only the steel body shell was made by Karmann and then shipped to BMW&#x27;s plant in Dingolfing for assembly.

Karmann-bodied cars are now rare and highly collectable, particularly in original condition in early factory colours such as orange (028 &quot;Phönix&quot;), green (079 &quot;Mitgrün&quot;), and yellow (070 &quot;Golf&quot;) - the latter very rare.

=== 1978 ===
In July 1978, the more powerful 635CSi variant was introduced. The 635CSi featured a close-ratio 5-speed gearbox and a single piece black rear spoiler. The M90 engine was a single overhead cam version of the M1&#x27;s M88 engine, its bigger bore and shorter stroke resulted in and increased torque. The aerodynamic changes reduced uplift at high speeds by almost 15 percent over the other E24 models.

=== 1979 ===
In 1979 the carburetted 630CS was replaced with the 628CSi; this car had a fuel-injected 2.8L engine taken from the E12 528i. An anti-lock braking system became available as an option.

=== 1980 ===
In 1980, the fuel-injection systems changed from Bosch L-jetronic to Bosch Motronic. The 635CSi central locking system could now be operated from the passenger door and trunk.

=== 1982 facelift ===
In 1982 (1983 model year in the US), the E24 was updated with parts from E28 5 Series, resulting changes to exterior styling, engines, chassis, suspension, electronics and the interior. The struts in the new front suspension were double-linked ones, making the car less likely to dip under hard braking. The new rear axle was nearly identical to the trailing arm layout of the E28 528i, with a new pitman arm to control camber changes. Meanwhile, the ventilated rear discs had proven a needless complication and were replaced with solid ones. The rust protection was improved considerably along with the facelift.

The 635CSi engine was updated to the M30B34, which used a smaller bore and longer stroke than the previous M90 engine. The 635CSi became available with a wide-ratio 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.


=== 1987 ===
E24s produced after June 1987 were fitted with ellipsoid headlamps, as per the recently introduced E32 7 Series. The front and rear bumpers and spoilers were redesigned to use a single design worldwide (prior to this, models sold in North America used a different design from the rest of the world).

The 635CSi engine was updated to the higher compression M30B35, which resulted in a power increase of for engines with catalytic converters.
== North American and Japanese models ==

The extended bumpers required by U.S. crash legislation resulted in U.S. models having an increase in length of approximately to . Although other markets offered multiple E24 models, in North America only one model was available at any given time (aside from the M6).

=== 630CSi ===
The 6 series was released in the US as the 630CSi in March 1977, with the 633CSi replacing it during the 1978 model year. The US market version received larger bumpers and side marker lights, as required by federal legislation. The 630CSi is powered by a fuel-injected version of the 630CS engine. This 3.0 litre engine produces and .

=== 633CSi ===
The 633CSi arrived in USA in September 1977 (for the 1978 model year), replacing the original 630. In United States/Japan specification, the 633CSi was powered by a version of the M30B32 engine. Output later dropped to .

In September 1980 (1981 model year), the manual transmission for US cars was upgraded from a 4-speed to a 5-speed. A 3-speed automatic transmission was optional.

In September 1982, North American and Japanese market models received a major facelift, as per the models sold in the rest of the world.

=== 635CSi ===
In November 1984, for the 1985 model year, the 633CSi was replaced by the 635CSi for the North American Market. This model uses the M30B34 engine, which produces and at 4,000 rpm. An L6 &quot;luxury edition&quot; version of the 635CSi was available in North America for the 1987 model year. The L6 featured leather headliner and trim and an automatic gearbox.

In 1988 the engine was upgraded to the M30B35. This engine has a capacity of 3.4 Litres (despite the model code and the &quot;3.5&quot; inscribed on the intake manifold) and produces and torque. This upgraded engine resulted in catalytic converter equipped United States models offering similar performance to European models. Self-leveling rear suspension was added to the 635CSi and M6 features list.

=== M6 ===
In 1987, North America and Japan received their equivalent of the M635CSi, called simply the M6. The main difference between the M6 and its European counterpart, is that the S38 engine is used instead of the M88. Compared with the M88, the S38 has a catalytic converter, the compression ratio reduced to 9.8:1, a double row timing chain, a shorter camshaft duration and a simplified exhaust manifold. The power output for the North American E24 M6 is , which is less than the European M635CSi.

Standard equipment on the United States market M6 cars included many features which were optional on the European cars, including heated power seats, self-leveling rear suspension, beverage chiller (cooled by an air-conditioning system) between the rear seats, air-conditioning vents for rear seat occupants, sunshade for rear occupants and an 8-speaker premium sound system.

== Motorsport ==

In 1982, the European Touring Car Championship transitioned to Group A regulations, prompting BMW to move from the 3.0 CSL to the 635 CSi. BMW Motorsport produced approximately 50 competition chassis between 1983 and 1985.

<doc id="882172" wikidata="Q796446" url="?curid=882172" title="BMW 5 Series (E28)">
<text>The BMW E28 is the second generation of BMW 5 Series executive cars, which was produced from 1981 to 1988 and replaced the E12 5 Series. Pre-series production began in April 1981 and the car was introduced in the autumn that year.

The E28 was initially produced with straight-four and straight-six petrol engines until 1983, when the 524td model became the first BMW car to be powered by a diesel engine. It was also the first 5 Series with the centre console angled towards the driver and to be available with anti-lock brakes (ABS).

The first BMW M5 was produced during the E28 generation. It was powered by the M88/3 and S38 straight-six engines. The E24 6 Series coupés were built on the E28 platform from 1982 to 1989. 

The E28 was replaced by the E34 5 Series in 1988.

== Body and interior ==
The E28 has a self-supporting body that is welded to the body platform. The passenger cell is a safety passenger cell with deformation elements both in the front and rear of the vehicle. Unlike its E12 predecessor and E34 successor, the E28 has a rear-hinged bonnet. The boot has a volume of . Most models have a fuel tank capacity of , with some models having a smaller tank of . The kerb weight is .

Cruise control, an on-board computer (to display trip information), and a &quot;check control&quot; panel (to alert the driver about fluid levels and lighting faults) were introduced to the 5 Series on the E28. The glazing is made of single-pane safety glass, the windscreen has laminated glass. As part of developing the air-conditioning system for the E28, several of the BMW engineers in charge of this program drove a previous generation E12 5 Series during the middle of summer in Texas. The E12 528i was painted black with a black interior, and driven in one day.

The styling was developed under BMW&#x27;s chief designer Claus Luthe, with development of the E28 beginning in 1975. At the time that BMW was designing the E28, the company had only one computer, which was used for payroll management and spare parts logistics. Wolfgang Matschinsky and his team borrowed that computer to perform the calculations necessary to develop the new drivetrain and chassis. This was due to the fact that the addition of an ABS system necessitated a redesign from the previous model due to excessive vibrations under heavy braking. 

== Engines ==
The E28 was the first 5 Series produced with diesel engines (the 524d and 524td models) and with a petrol engined model specifically aimed at increased fuel economy (525e/528e model).

The four models available at the launch of the E28 were the 518, 520i, 525i and 528i, with the 518 using a straight-four petrol engine and the other three models using a straight-six petrol engine. Over the course of the E28 model, the following models were added: the 524d and 524td using diesel engines, the 518i (a fuel-injected version of the 518), the 525e/528e as fuel-economy models, and the upper-specification 533i, 535i, M535i, and M5 models.

A liquid petroleum gas (LPG) option was introduced for some petrol engines in 1984.

=== Petrol ===


518: Sold only in some European markets where it suited local tax categories, the 518 was the lowest specification model which used a four-cylinder engine with a carburetor. Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 14.0 seconds.

518i: The base model in Japan and some European countries, the 518i used a fuel-injected four-cylinder engine. Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 12.6 seconds. This version was not sold in West Germany until the 1984 facelift, when it replaced the carburetted 518.

520i: A mid-range model with the smallest of the available six-cylinder engines. Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 11.4 seconds.

525e / 528e: The 525e (called 528e in North America and Japan) uses a longer stroke 2.7-litre version of the 6-cylinder M20 petrol engine, is optimised for fuel economy and torque at low engine speed rather than the traditional high revving characteristics of BMW straight-six engines. The &quot;e&quot; stands for the Greek letter &quot;eta&quot;, for economy. According to BMW, the 525e is more fuel efficient than the 520i, which has the same rated power of 92 kW. Since many markets tax cars based on engine displacement, the eta&#x27;s larger engine meant that it was not suitable everywhere. The model was expressly developed with the American market in mind. BMW&#x27;s corporate average fuel economy was at risk of not meeting requirements by 1984, primarily due to higher sales of their bigger, more expensive cars in the early 1980s. In Austria, the 525e was detuned to .

Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars without a catalytic converter are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 10.7 seconds. With a catalytic converter, the figures are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 11.3 seconds

525i: This mid-range model is powered by a 2.5-litre 6-cylinder engine. The 525i was only sold in Europe. Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 9.8 seconds.

528i: Initially the highest specification available, the 6-cylinder 528i became a mid-range model following the release of the 533i and 535i models. Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 8.4 seconds.

533i:
Only sold in Japan and North America, the 6-cylinder 533i was the highest specification model during its production years of 1983–1984. It was replaced by the 535i.

535i/is: Released in 1984, the 535i replaced the 533i and uses the same 6-cylinder drivetrain as the M535i. In the US there was also a 535is model, which included sport seats and spoilers at the front and rear. Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars without a catalytic converter are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 7.2 seconds. With a catalytic converter, the figures are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 7.9 seconds
M535i: The top of the regular production model range, the M535i uses the drivetrain from the 535i plus M-Technic suspension, and wheels and body panels not found on any other E28. The M535i was assembled on the standard E28 assembly lines in Dingolfing and Rosslyn. Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars without a catalytic converter are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 7.2 seconds. With a catalytic converter, the figures are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 7.9 seconds
=== Diesel ===

524d: At the 1986 Geneva Motor Show, four years after the introduction of the more powerful 524td model, the naturally-aspirated 524d model was introduced. It was only sold in some markets.

524td: This turbodiesel model was the first diesel car produced by BMW. It entered production in late 1982, when 100 pre-series cars were built. Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars are a top speed of and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 12.9 seconds.

== Drivetrain ==
BMW offered the E28 with both manual and automatic gearboxes. The torque is transmitted from the engine with a single-disc dry clutch with a torsional damper in the models with a manual gearbox, the automatic models have a torque converter with built in lockup-clutch.

;Manual transmissions
The 5-speed manual transmissions are:
* Getrag 242 (for M10 and M20 engine models)
* Getrag 262 (M30 engines)

The 5-speed manual transmissions are:
* Getrag 240 (M10 and M21 engines)
* Getrag 245 (M10 engines)

* Getrag 265 (M30 engines and 525e/528e)
* Getrag 280 (M88/3 and S38 engines)
* ZF S5-16 (M20 engines)

;Automatic transmissions
The 3-speed automatic transmissions are:
* ZF 3HP22 (M20 and M30 engines, US market only)

The 4-speed automatic transmissions are:
* ZF 4HP22 (M10, M20, M21)
* ZF 4HP22 EH (M20, M30)

== Suspension ==
Independent front and rear suspension is used, with Macpherson struts at the front and a semi-trailing arm design for the rear.

The front suspension was upgraded to use dual links at the bottom of the strut, as first seen on the E23 7 Series. This increases steering offset while cornering, to improve steering feel. Double-acting shock absorbers, coil springs and a front anti-roll bar are used.

The rear suspension is mounted on a delta beam that is connected to the body with three screws in rubber bearings, that have longitudinal play. Some models have a rear anti-roll bar.

The steering on most models is a speed-dependent recirculating ball power steering system made by ZF Friedrichshafen. The 518i has a Gemmer steering system with a double enveloping worm gear, also made by ZF.

Wheel sizes are 14-inch (16-inch for the M5 model) or 390 mm Michelin TRX. All rims have 22 mm positive rim offset.

== Brakes ==
The brakes use a hydraulic dual-circuit brake system with power assistance. The front wheels have disc brakes, that are – except for the 518i – internally ventilated. All models with 2.5 L or more displacement have rear disc brakes (non-vented), while the lesser powered models have rear drum brakes. To prevent the wheels from locking, BMW equipped the E28 after 1984 with an anti-lock braking system, although it was an option in some markets.

== M5 model ==
The E28 was the first M5 model produced, and is powered by the M88/3 and S38 straight-six engines.
== North American market models ==
The North American line-up consisted of the 528e (1982–1988, known as the 525e in Europe), 533i (1983–1984), 535i (1985–1988), 524td (1985–1986), M5 (1986–1987) and 535is (1987–1988).

The launch model was the 528e in 1982, followed by the 533i. The optional automatic transmission was initially a 3-speed (a 4-speed automatic was available in Europe at the time), with a 4-speed automatic transmission becoming optional in 1983. From 1985, all North American models had ABS Brakes as standard.

The North American E28 models had larger bumpers (designed to withstand a collision without body damage), which increased the overall length by .

The 528i, 533i and 535i were sold with a catalytic converter in the United States.

Instead of importing the M535i, BMW of North America created the 535is. This model is based on a 535i, plus front and rear spoilers, sport suspension and sport seats.

Production of North American market M5 models began in late 1986 (two years after M5 production began for European markets), and it was only produced for twelve months as 1988 model year car. North American M5 models use the S38 engine instead of the M88/3. All North American M5 cars were painted Jet Black and most interiors were tan (&quot;Natur&quot;) coloured leather.

== Production ==
E28 production started in July 1981 and ended in December 1987. A total of 722,328 cars were built.

The E28 was still sold in North America as a 1988 Model Year car after its E34 successor had been released in Europe in early 1988. A limited edition model was also sold in South Africa from mid-1987 to the end of 1988.

<text>The BMW E30 is the second generation of BMW 3 Series, which was produced from 1982 to 1994 and replaced the E21 3 Series. The model range included 2-door saloon (sometimes referred to as a coupé) and convertible body styles, as well as being the first 3 Series to be produced in 4-door saloon and wagon/estate body styles. It was powered by four-cylinder petrol, six-cylinder petrol and six-cylinder diesel engines, the latter a first for the 3 Series. The E30 325iX model was the first BMW to have all-wheel drive.

The first BMW M3 model was built on the E30 platform and was powered by the high-revving BMW S14 four-cylinder petrol engine. The BMW Z1 roadster was also based on the E30 platform. Following the launch of the E36 3 Series in 1990, the E30 began to be phased out.

== Development ==

Development of the E30 3 Series began in July 1976, with styling being developed under chief designer Claus Luthe with exterior styling led by Boyke Boyer. In 1978, the final design was approved, with design freeze (cubing process) being completed in 1979. BMW&#x27;s launch film for the E30 shows the design process including Computer-aided design (CAD), crash testing and wind-tunnel testing. The car was released at the end of November 1982.

Externally, the E30&#x27;s appearance is very similar to twin headlight versions of its E21 predecessor, however there are various detail changes in styling to the E30. Major differences to the E21 include the interior and a revised suspension, the latter to reduce the oversteer for which the E21 was criticised.

===Minor update (1985)===
In September 1985 the exterior and interior trim were updated. The 323i model was replaced with the 325i at this time and the diesel-engined 324d was introduced. A factory convertible entered the model range. However, the Baur remained on sale, alongside the factory convertible. The M3 convertible was only offered for the European market.

===Major update (1987)===
At the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1987, BMW introduced a major update to the E30 (often called Series 2). The changes to the lineup were the addition of the Touring (station wagon) variant and removal of the 325e model. The 1987 update models remained largely unchanged until the end of production, with the addition of the 318is model in 1989.

External styling changes included redesigned rear lights, front bumper and a reduction in the amount of chrome trim.
The back was completely redesigned with new redesigned larger rear fenders and front wings slightly inflated and wider in the end. The four-cylinder engine was upgraded from the BMW M10 to the BMW M40 and various other mechanical changes were made. Rust protection was improved with the update.

== Body styles ==
In addition to the two-door saloon and Baur convertible body styles of its E21 predecessors, the E30 later also became available as a four-door saloon and five-door station wagon (marketed as &quot;Touring&quot;).

The Touring body style began life as a prototype built by BMW engineer Max Reisböck in his friend&#x27;s garage in 1984 and began production in 1987. The factory convertible version began production in 1985, with the Baur convertible conversions remaining available alongside it.


== Engines ==
Initially, the E30 used carryover four-cylinder (M10) and six-cylinder (M20) petrol engines from its E21 predecessor. Over the production run, new families of four-cylinder petrol engines were introduced and the six-cylinder engine received various upgrades. A six-cylinder diesel engine was introduced, in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged forms.

Factory specifications are shown below.


=== Four-cylinder petrol ===

At the launch of the E30 range in 1982, the 316 used a 1766 cc version of the M10 fed by a carburetor and producing . The 318i had the same M10 engine, but with Bosch L-Jetronic fuel-injection, increasing power to while also improving fuel economy.

The 1987 Series 2 update introduced a new four-cylinder engine: the M40, which used Bosch Motronic fuel-injection. In the 318i, a version of the M40 was used. The 316i model replaced the 316, using a version of the M40. While smaller and less torquey than the 1.8-litre engine in the 316, it still had higher power thanks to the fuel injection.

The 318iS was released in 1989, using the new M42 engine and only being available with two doors. This is the most modern engine available in the E30 range, incorporating DOHC, the updated Bosch Motronic 1.7, hydraulic valve adjusters and coil-on-plug ignition. In some markets, the M42 engine was used in the 318i models, instead of the M40.

The M3 is powered by the S14 engine, a high-revving four-cylinder engine.

=== Six-cylinder petrol ===
At the launch of the E30 range, the six-cylinder models consisted of the 320i, which had a version of the M20 producing , and the 323i, with a M20 producing , both using Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection. These models were not sold in North America, presumably for emissions reasons. In 1985, the 2.3 L engine was replaced with a 2.5 L version of the M20, which produced and used Bosch Motronic fuel injection. This engine was available in the 325i variants, including the all-wheel drive 325iX.

An economy version called the 325e was released with a lower revving, more fuel efficient engine. The &quot;e&quot; is an abbreviation for eta, which is used to represent the thermal efficiency of a heat engine. To maximise low-rev torque, the 325e engine was the largest available in an E30 (aside from the 333i model, which was only sold in South Africa). The 325e engine had a longer stroke than the 325i version, with a more restrictive head, four cam bearings instead of seven, and single valve springs (instead of the dual valve springs used by the 325i version). In European specifications, with a catalytic converter, the 325e engine produced at 4250 rpm and at 3250 rpm. By comparison, peak torque for the 325i engine was at 4000 rpm.

The 1987 Series 2 update boosted the 320i to and the 325i to , and improved fuel economy.

=== Six-cylinder diesel ===

In 1983 the M21 engine was unveiled in the new 524td at the IAA in West Germany. The M21 engine used a Garrett turbocharger (without an intercooler). The engine has a capacity of and uses mechanical fuel injection.

In 1985 BMW introduced the 324d, a naturally aspirated version of the same M21 engine, which was popular in countries with a high motor vehicle tax.

In 1987 an electronically controlled fuel pump was used which increased the torque output by . The updated engine has a smaller turbocharger, decreasing turbo lag.

==Drivetrain==

In total, six transmissions were available for the various models of the E30: four manuals, and two automatics. The E30 was offered with rear-wheel drive, or permanent all-wheel drive (325iX saloons and estates only).

===Manual transmissions===
* 4-speed Getrag 242 — 316 and 318i models
* 5-speed Getrag 240 — 316, 318i and 320i models (with a different bellhousing for the 320i, to suit the BMW M20 engine, and another different bellhousing to suit the later M42-engined 318i/is).
* 5-speed Getrag 260 — 323i, 325e, 325es and 325i models.
* 5-speed Getrag 265 — M3 model (dog-leg shift pattern for European models and a standard H-pattern for North American models).

===Automatic transmissions===
* 3-speed ZF 3HP22 — 1981 to 1985.
* 4-speed ZF 4HP22 — 320i and 323i models until 1985, available on all models from 1985 onwards.

==Suspension==
One of the features that added to the roominess of the E30 was the suspension. The front MacPherson struts and rear semi-trailing arm suspension were a compact arrangement that left a lot of cabin and boot space for the car&#x27;s overall size. The semi-trailing arms have been criticized for the dynamic toe and camber changes inherent to the suspension geometry, causing bump steer in hard cornering situations (such as racing and autocross). Nonetheless, reviewers praised the handling of the E30.

A widened version of the E30 front suspension and the drivetrain from the E30 325i were used in the BMW Z1 roadster. The BMW Z3 and BMW Compact (E36/5) rear suspensions are also very similar to the E30, but utilizing five-lug hubs. The Z3-based BMW M Coupé uses a widened version of the same rear semi-trailing arm suspension along with stronger hubs.

== Brakes ==
For the front wheels, all models use disc brakes. Early 316/318 models have solid discs, while all subsequent models have vented discs. For the rear wheels, most models use solid disc brakes, except for some early models: 4cylinder &amp; 6cylinder models which use drum brakes. Anti-lock braking system (ABS) became available in 1986.

== Model range ==
=== United States &amp; Canada ===
The model range in the United States consisted of the following:
* 318i (1984-1985 using the M10 engine, then 1991 using the M42 engine)
* 318is (1991 only)
* 325, 325e and 325es (1984-1988)
* 325i, 325is (1987-1991 only)
* 325ix (1988-1991 only)

The primary distinctive feature of the BMW E30 models produced for the North American market in 1984–1987 is the protruding front and rear aluminum bumpers. These bumpers are commonly known as &quot;diving boards.&quot; In 1987, the anodized aluminum bumpers for the North American market were shortened by revising the cover/fillers and shortening the shock absorbers on which they were mounted. In 1988, the front and rear valances were updated along with the rear wheel arch. In 1989, shorter body-coloured plastic bumpers replaced the aluminium ones altogether.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, only the two-door and four-door saloons were built, four cylinder petrol models production continued there until 1992.

Despite the introduction of the M40 engine, the old M10-powered 316 continued to be sold in South Africa until 1991, gaining the new bumpers when the range was updated.

It also had the European E30 M3 &quot;4bolt&quot; bottom front struts, 16&quot; Alpina rims, Alpina Cluster. Initial Series 1 was 6 &quot;race cars &quot;for South African Group N racing, and 204 Series 2 production cars to satisfy Homologation rules.

== M3 model ==

The BMW M3 utilised a widened and heavily redesigned variation of the two-door body style, therefore the M3 shares few body parts with other E30 models. The M3 suspension is also significantly different from regular E30 models, including five-lug wheel bolts.
== Alpina models ==
The Alpina C1, C2, B3 and B6 models were based on the E30.
==Special models==
===320is===
For Portugal and Italy only, due to considerably higher taxes for cars with engines exceeding 2000 cc, a special model was created: the 320is. The four-door version appeared in the dealers&#x27; showrooms in September 1987 while the two-door followed in March 1988. Production of the 320is continued until 1991.

This model was equipped with a version of the S14 engine from the M3, with stroke reduced to . This engine produced at 6900 rpm and at 4,900 rpm. The 320is shared the same dogleg Getrag 265 gearbox of the non-US M3 while it had a limited slip differential with the same 25% lock up rate but with a shorter differential ratio of 3.46:1. All the 320is models were left hand drive and without a catalytic converter. Sports suspension was fitted to all two-door models, and to four-doors produced from September 1989.

The interior of the 320is was identical to that of other 3 Series models, except an M3 instrument cluster (which features an oil temperature gauge instead of a fuel economy gauge) was used. The 320is was sold for three years, with 1,206 four-doors and 2,542 two-doors produced.

===M325i===

In New Zealand, where the M3 was never sold by BMW, the local importer created a sporting version of the saloon called M325i. About 100 such cars were imported beginning in late 1986 until at least 1990. Fitted with the standard non-catalyzed 2.5 litre engine they benefited from a Motorsport tuned suspension, the M-Technic body package, 15-inch BBS cross-spoke wheels with wide, low profile (225/50) tyres, and a limited-slip differential. The M325i is quite similar to the British market 325i Sport, also developed as a response to the absence of a right-hand-drive M3.

===333i===
BMW South Africa&#x27;s Motorsport division created the 333i in 1985 by fitting the 3.2 L M30 &quot;big six&quot; engine to a two-door E30. The resulting 333i was a success in South African saloon car racing. These cars were built with help from Alpina in Buchloe, West Germany. Due to the space constraints caused by the large M30 engine, the buyer was forced to choose between air conditioning (highly desirable in South Africa) and power steering. Cars with power steering are distinguished by having foglights, cars with air-conditioning instead had ducts providing fresh air for the air-conditioning. The 333i was produced from 1985 to 1987 and only 204 cars were produced.

The 333i engine produces at 5500 rpm and at 4300 rpm. BMW&#x27;s official performance claims are in 7.4 seconds, and a top speed of .

=== South African 325iS ===
The 325iS was created by BMW South Africa to replace the 2.5 litre 126 kW 325i in Group N production car racing, as a response to the introduction of the Opel Kadett 2 litre 16V to the Class A category. Early 325iS cars had a 2.5 litre motor, and various weight lightening interventions including alloy doors and drilled out sections in boot hinges and other steel pressings. The 2.7 litre 325iS, commonly called Evo 2, replaced the &#x27;Evo 1&#x27; cars, Evo 2 cars had standard doors. It was launched in the first half of 1990 and was powered by an Alpina-fettled, 2.7 litre M20 engine which produced . Following the introduction of the upgraded Opel Kadett 16V SuperBoss, in 1991 BMW South Africa introduced the 325iS Evolution HP, commonly referred to as the Evo 2. The motor was upgraded to produce .

The Evolution HP won the Group N Class A title in 1993, winning 20 of the 24 races in the process. The Robbi Smith and Geoff Goddard Evolution HP won the season-ending 9hr race.

=== 323i JPS ===
The John Player Special Edition is an Australian-only limited edition special offered by BMW Australia as a tribute to the M3 race cars competing in local touring car racing. JPS refers to the BMW race team sponsor, John Player Special cigarettes. The cars were based on two-door 323i with manual transmission, painted in black with gold pinstripes and gold BBS wheels. They also had Recaro sports seats, JPS badging, a limited slip differential, sports suspension, a sunroof (optional) and a body kit. The cars were ordered from the factory as a base 323i in black with a fixed selection of options - all of which were otherwise available to order but priced at a substantial discount as an Edition package. The pinstripes were added in Australia and the wheels were also gold anodised in Australia. The production run was 70 cars.

== Production ==
The E30 was produced in Munich, West Germany; Regensburg, West Germany; and Rosslyn, South Africa. Series production began in October 1982.

Models sold in Indonesia and Thailand used complete knock-down kits produced in Germany, which were assembled in Jakarta and Bangkok respectively.

Production of the E30 began to wind down in 1990, due to the introduction of the E36 3 Series coupé models. Production of the regular two-door saloons concluded on April 30, 1991, at Regensburg. Sporting variants like 325is evolution 1 and 2 and some others continued to be produced until 1992. Four-door sedan production concluded in February 29, 1992, for all markets. Production of US-spec models was concluded in 1991.

Convertibles were built from late 1990 to 1993. Tourings (station wagons) were built from 1988 to 1994. Other variants were phased out gradually, until the final E30 model, a Touring, was produced in 1994, and sold as a 1995 model year.

== Motorsports ==

The E30 M3 had a very successful career in Touring car racing.

The E30 remains a popular car for racing and E30-specific racing series such as the National Auto Sport Association&#x27;s Spec E30 class are run in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.

<doc id="882177" wikidata="Q1298358" url="?curid=882177" title="1996 Russian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Russia on 16 June 1996, with a second round being held on 3 July 1996. It resulted in a victory for the incumbent Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who ran as an independent politician. Yeltsin defeated the Communist Party of the Russian Federation challenger Gennady Zyuganov in the second round, receiving 54.4% of the vote. Yeltsin&#x27;s second inauguration ceremony took place on 9 August 1996.

Yeltsin would not complete the second term for which he was elected, as he resigned on 31 December 1999, eight months before the scheduled end of his term on 9 August 2000; he was succeeded by his chosen successor, Vladimir Putin, whom he had appointed prime minister of Russia a few months earlier. This was the first presidential election to take place in post-Soviet Russia. As of 2024, this has also been the only Russian presidential election in which no candidate was able to win on the first round, and as such a runoff election was necessary.

Although most contemporaneous reports certified the 1996 election result, the election has been associated with various counts of pro-Yeltsin media bias and foreign influence, as well as allegations of electoral fraud or that it was an unfair election. Critics also argued that Yeltsin had engaged in vote buying by utilizing state finances to fund social programs, to which he responded he was merely doing his duties as president. Others argued that the allegations were exaggerated, and that the then United States government in fact refrained from covert operations and did not grant all of Yeltsin&#x27;s requests.

==Background==

In 1991, Boris Yeltsin was elected to a five-year term as president of Russia, which was still a part of the Soviet Union at the time. The next election was scheduled be held sometime in 1996. In late December 1991, Soviet Russia became a sovereign nation in wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This meant that the scheduled election would now be the first ever presidential election to be held in a fully sovereign Russia.

In a 1993 Russian government referendum question (III), Russian voters rejected holding an early presidential election, and the presidential election remained scheduled to be held in the year 1996. Later in 1993, the Constitution of Russia was adopted. In the constitution, future presidential terms were stipulated to last for four years, meaning that the 1996 election would elect a president to serve a four-year term. When incumbent president Yeltsin launched his re-election campaign in early 1996, he was widely predicted to lose. Public opinion of Yeltsin was at a historical low point. Due to this, there was talk about Yeltsin potentially postponing or canceling the election; he ultimately decided against this.

Shortly before the election campaign, Yeltsin had faced a number of significant political humiliations which harmed his political stature. In the 1995 Russian legislative election, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) had achieved dominance in the State Duma. On 9 January 1996, Chechen rebels seized thousands of hostages in Dagestan and Yeltsin&#x27;s response to this was viewed as a failure. Additionally, Yeltsin was overseeing a terrible economy. Russian economy was still contracting and many workers had continued to be unpaid for months.

By early 1996, Yeltsin&#x27;s public approval was so poor that he was polling at fifth place among presidential candidates, with only 8 percent support, while CPRF leader Gennady Zyuganov was in the lead with 21 percent support. When Zyuganov showed up at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in February 1996, many Western leaders and the international media were eager to see him, and treated him with regards to believing that he would likely be the next president of Russia.

==Candidates==
===Registered candidates===
===Withdrawn candidates===
==Campaigning==
===Vladimir Bryntsalov===

Pharmaceutical businessman Vladimir Bryntsalov ran as the candidate of the Russian Socialist Party. Brytsalov argued that his leadership would eliminate the country&#x27;s poverty, promising that if he were elected, there would be &quot;no poor pensioners, no poor workers, no poor entrepreneurs, no poor farmers.&quot; His plan, which he dubbed &quot;Russian socialism&quot;, was for large companies to begin paying wages comparable to companies in other industrialized nations. The plan anticipated that the employees of the companies would consequentially pay larger income taxes, spend more on consumer goods, and increase their productivity at their jobs. The feasibility of this plan was criticized, as Russian companies were considered to be unable to pay such wages.

Brytsalov promoted himself with the superlative claim of being &quot;the richest man in Russia&quot; and flaunted his wealth. Despite being at the time a recently elected deputy of the State Duma, Brytsalov did not have a voting-record. In his legislative career, he had very low attendance and extremely little participation. Brytsalov was seen as a marginal candidate, and was generally regarded as unlikely to win the election.

===Mikhail Gorbachev===

Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ran as an independent candidate. He ran as a self-proclaimed social democrat, and asserted that, of those running for president, his was the voice of responsibility and moderation. His campaign was hampered both by strong public disdain towards him and a strong lack of media coverage for his candidacy. At one point, Gorbachev complained that there was less press freedom than when he was leader of the Soviet Union.

Gorbachev subsequently questioned the validity of the election results. While he acknowledged that he had lost by a significant margin, Gorbachev suspected that his actual vote count still exceeded what was reported in the official tally. In 2017, Gorbachev wrote in his book &quot;The New Russia&quot; that &quot;there have been no fair and free elections in Russia since those of 1989, 1990 and the election of 1991 when Boris Yeltsin became the first president of Russia.&quot;

===Svyatoslav Fyodorov===

Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a politician and renown ophthalmologist, ran as the candidate of the Party of Workers&#x27; Self-Government. He was the founder and leader of the party, which at the time was arguably the most influential social-democratic movement in Russia. Fyodorov was considered to be on the center-left of the political spectrum. In 1994, Fyodorov had described his political objective by stating: &quot;I want peasants to own farms, workers to own factories, physicians to own clinics, and everyone to pay a 30% tax, and the rest is theirs.&quot;

Fyodorov advocated for the mass creation of joint stock companies to guarantee workers a share of profits and allow them to actively participate in management of their companies. He dubbed this concept &quot;democratic capitalism&quot; or &quot;popular socialism&quot;. He had advocated such a policy since as early as 1991. Fyodorov advocated for economic freedom, simple and moderate taxation, stimulation of production, and a ban on exports of most raw materials. Fyodorov promised that his policies would double the nation&#x27;s GDP within five years. Fyodorov proclaimed to draw inspiration in his politics from both Ross Perot and Deng Xiaoping. Up until early May 1996, Fyodorov unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate the creation of a third force coalition, with negotiations largely centering on a coalition between him and fellow candidates Yavlinsky and Lebed.

===Alexander Lebed===

General Alexander Lebed ran as the nominee of the Congress of Russian Communities, a centrist nationalist party. Lebed promoted himself as an authoritative leader that would introduce law and order, tackle corruption, and allow capitalism to blossom. While he presented an authoritarian personality, he held moderate positions. After reaching an informal agreement with Yeltsin in April (under which Lebed promised to endorse Yeltsin in the second round of the election), Lebed began to see positive news coverage, as well as a greater overall quantity of media coverage. This was done as part of an effort by Yeltsin&#x27;s camp to promote Lebed in the hopes that he would syphon off votes from other nationalist candidates in the first-round. Up until early May 1996, Lebed had entertained negotiations with Yavlinsky and Fyodorov to jointly form a third force coalition.
===Martin Shakkum===

Martin Shakkum ran as an independent candidate. An associate of radical economist Stanislav Shatalin, Shakkum was on the right wing of the Russian political spectrum. Like Lebed, although he presented himself with an authoritarian personality, he held moderate positions on many social issues.

===Aman Tuleyev===

Independent candidate Aman Tuleyev, a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), styled himself as a &quot;Muslim Communist&quot;. The head of the Kemerovo Oblast legislature, Tuleyev was considered to be charismatic, energetic, and well-liked by the CPRF&#x27;s political base. Despite the fact that Tuleyev dropped out of the race before the election, he had already been on the ballot during a portion of the early voting period, and he turned-in his signatures the day before the deadline. He was considered to be a fallback CPRF candidate in case Zyuganov&#x27;s candidacy faltered. Tuleyev&#x27;s rhetoric straddled between hardline communism and social democracy. Generally a hardliner, he had nonetheless occasionally taken moderate stances, such as seeking tax cuts. Tuleyev&#x27;s positions centered upon communism and creating a disciplined and uncorrupt government. Tuleyev dropped out of the race on 8 June 1996 and endorsed Zyuganov.

===Yury Vlasov===

Politician and former Olympic weightlifter Yury Vlasov ran as an independent candidate. His politics were characterized as nationalist. Vlasov openly espoused antisemitic rhetoric. Vlasov dubbed his politics as &quot;people&#x27;s patriotism&quot;. His campaign platform proclaimed: &quot;There is only one single force that is able to unite almost all and at the same time become the ideological basis of the Russian state – popular patriotism.&quot; While he had been a supporter of democratic reforms in the Soviet Union, Vlasov had embraced authoritarian political views following its collapse. Vlasov likened his politics to Gaullism. He argued that his politics were a more effective unifying force than communist or liberal-democratic ideals. Although he was nominally an independent candidate, Vlasov&#x27;s campaign was supported by the People&#x27;s National Party; by the end of the election, many in the party grew dissatisfied with Vlasov&#x27;s campaign style, believing he failed to campaign aggressively enough. Despite polling at under one percent, Vlasov had stated that he anticipated capturing between six and seven percent of the vote. He swore to refuse supporting either Yeltsin or support Zyuganov in the runoff.

===Grigory Yavlinsky===

Grigory Yavlinsky ran as the nominee of Yabloko. Yavlinsky officially accepted Yabloko&#x27;s nomination on 27 January 1996. In terms of social issues, Yavlinsky occupied the political left. In terms of economic issues, Yavlinsky occupied the far right of the Russian political spectrum. His ideology most strongly appealed to Russia&#x27;s population of young intellectuals. Yabloko had been a programmatic party, as opposed to a populist one. This proved to be a weakness for Yavlinsky&#x27;s campaign, as he and his party opted to maintain their long-established party positions on many issues rather than reshaping their agenda in order to better capitalize on the political tides. This had also been the case in the preceding 1995 electoral campaign, during which Yabloko similarly had opted to focus on complex economic issues, rather than focusing on bread and butter issues. Up until early May 1996, Yavlinsky unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate the creation of a third force coalition, with negotiations largely centering on a coalition between him and fellow candidates Lebed and Fyodorov.

===Boris Yeltsin===


Incumbent Boris Yeltsin ran for re-election as an independent candidate. While his prospects of winning were originally faltering, Yeltsin was able to resuscitate his image and pull off a successful campaign. Yeltsin&#x27;s original strategy, devised by Oleg Soskovets, involved him pivoting towards the nationalist wing of Russia&#x27;s politics in order to directly compete for votes with Zyuganov and Zhirinovsky; this strategy was ultimately abandoned in favor of one devised by reformists and British and American consultants. Yeltsin&#x27;s new campaign strategy was, essentially, to convince voters that they had to choose him as the lesser of two evils. This strategy sought to recast Yeltsin as an individual single-handedly fighting to stave off Communist control. The campaign framed a narrative that portrayed Yeltsin as Russia&#x27;s best hope for stability. The campaign worked to shift the narrative of the election into a referendum on whether voters wanted to return to their Communist past (with Zyuganov), or continue with reforms (with Yeltsin).

Yeltsin was able to leverage the power of his office. This included using government funds to finance campaign promises, utilizing state media organizations, and currying favoritism amongst financial and media oligarchs. Two days after the conclusion of the first round, Yeltsin appointed former general Alexander Lebed, who had finished third with 14.7% of vote, to the post of Secretary of Security Council of the Russian Federation and the President&#x27;s National Security Advisor. Lebed in turn endorsed Yeltsin in the runoff election. Meanwhile, Yeltsin suffered from a serious heart attack and disappeared from public view. His condition was kept secret through the second-round election on 3 July 1996. During this period of time, Yeltsin&#x27;s campaign team created a &quot;virtual Yeltsin&quot; shown in the media through staged interviews that never happened and pre-recorded radio addresses.

===Vladimir Zhirinovsky===

The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky campaigned on nationalist rhetoric. After his surprisingly strong third-place finish in the 1991 presidential election and the surprisingly strong first-place performance of the LDPR in the 1993 Russian legislative election, Zhirinivsky had once been seen as a rising force in Russian politics and a future contender for the presidency. Boorish and outlandish conduct by Zhirinovsky had diminished the public perception of his stature to such a degree that, by 1996, he was seen as a buffoonish figure and was no longer seen as a viable candidate.

===Gennady Zyuganov===

The Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) leader Gennady Zyuganov successfully advanced to the second-round of the election, where he was defeated by Yeltsin. Coming off of a very successful CPRF performance in the 1995 Russian legislative election, when he launched his campaign, Zyuganov had originally been seen as the frontrunner to win the election.

==Conduct==
===Contemporary analysis===
In their 1996 report, the International Republican Institute stated that their election observers &quot;witnessed no deliberate attempts to commit electoral fraud and, indeed, in the tracking of protocols through the various levels of Russia&#x27;s electoral system, observed transparency in the process.&quot; In their 1996 analysis, the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs declared that, while the election failed to be &quot;free and fair&quot; in regards to media coverage and campaign financing, it appeared to have largely succeeded in being &quot;free and fair&quot; in regards to the administration of voting and vote-counting.

Observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) reported in 1996 that the first round of the election &quot;appeared to be generally well run, and not seriously marred by some problems which occurred in the pre-election campaign. The delegation considered the first round of the Russian Presidential elections to have been conducted in a generally free and fair manner.&quot; The OSCE also reported: &quot;Delegation members considered voter participation in the political campaign to be quite active compared to previous Russian elections. A relatively open flow of information concerning candidates and their platforms was made available to voters during the pre-election campaign; opposition candidates charged that the state controlled electronic broadcast media did not provide fair and balanced coverage, and this was also observed to be the case by delegation members. The bias appeared to be primarily in favor of the President.&quot; The OSCE concluded: &quot;The delegation found that Polling Station Election Committees (PSECs) &quot;generally&quot; followed proper procedures and enforced the one-man-one-vote principle, although &quot;scattered&quot; instances of minor irregularities, such as family voting and voting outside of polling booths were observed.&quot;

In a 1996 post-election analysis published in the journal &quot;Presidential Studies Quarterly,&quot; Erik Depov asserted: &quot;The inaccuracy of many early predictions was primarily because Yeltsin&#x27;s successful re-election bid had as much to do with the dynamics of the electoral campaign as with the results of his first term in office. If the 1996 presidential campaign proved anything, it illustrated the danger of underestimating Yeltsin&#x27;s ability to meet a serious political challenge head on and prevail despite apparently insurmountable odds.&quot; During the campaign, Yeltsin&#x27;s opponents criticized his use of state coffers to fund programs that would bolster his approval with voters. Yeltsin had been utilizing state finances to fund programs (such as pensions) with the aim of convincing voters of his willingness to fulfill promises he was making on the campaign trail. Yeltsin&#x27;s opponents charged that, in doing this, he was essentially buying votes; in turn, Yeltsin&#x27;s team argued that he was simply doing his job as president. During the second round campaign, Zyuganov asserted in a letter to the parliament, the Central Election Commission, and the media that Yeltsin was buying votes with money that should be used to pay wage and pension arrears and that he had pressured local leaders into working for his campaign. He also alleged that Yeltsin was using &quot;tens of trillions of rubles&quot; from the state budget for campaign purposes. Zyuganov argued that such practices would call into question the results of the voting and urged immediate measures that would insure equal conditions for the candidates.

===Pro-Yeltsin media bias===
Yeltsin benefited from an immense media bias favoring his campaign. In 1991, at the time of the previous presidential election, Russia had only two major television channels. RTR had supported Yeltsin, while ORT had criticized him and provided broad coverage of the views of his opponents. In the 1996 presidential election, none of Russia&#x27;s major television networks were critical of Yeltsin. Yeltsin had successfully enlisted the national television channels (ORT, RTR, and NTV) and most of the written press to essentially act as agents of his campaign.

The European Institute for Media found that Yeltsin received 53% of all media coverage of the campaign, while Zyuganov received only 18%. In their evaluation of the biases of news stories, EIM awarded each candidate 1 point for every positive story they received and subtracted a point for every negative story they received. In the first round of the election, Yeltsin scored +492 and Zyuganov scored −313. In the second round of the election, Yeltsin scored +247 and Zyuganov scored −240. Television networks marginalized all of Yeltsin&#x27;s opponents aside from Zyuganov, helping to create the perception that there were only two viable candidates. This allowed Yeltsin to pose as the lesser-evil. Near the end of the election&#x27;s first-round, the networks began also providing coverage to the candidacy of Lebed, who had already agreed to support Yeltsin in the second round.

Supplementing the work of the numerous public relations and media firms that were hired by the Yeltsin campaign, a number of media outlets &quot;volunteered&quot; their services to Yeltsin&#x27;s re-election effort. For instance, &quot;Kommersant&quot; (one of the most prominent business newspapers in the country) published an anti-Communist paper called &quot;Ne Dai Bog&quot; (meaning &quot;God forbid&quot;). At ORT, a special committee was placed in charge of planning a marathon of anti-Communist films and documentaries to be broadcast on the channel ahead of the election. Led by the efforts of Mikhail Lesin, the media painted a picture of a fateful choice for Russia, between Yeltsin and a &quot;return to totalitarianism&quot;. They even played up the threat of civil war if a Communist was elected president.

One of the reasons for the media&#x27;s overwhelming favoritism of Yeltsin was their fear that a Communist government would dismantle Russia&#x27;s right to a free press. Another factor contributing to the media&#x27;s support of Yeltsin was that his government still owned two of the national television channels, and still provided the majority of funding to the majority of independent newspapers. In addition, Yeltsin&#x27;s government also was in charge of supplying licenses to media outlets. Yeltsin&#x27;s government and Yury Luzhkov, the then mayor of Moscow, flexed their power and reminded the owners, publishers, and editors that newspaper licenses and Moscow leases for facilities were &quot;under review&quot;. There were also instances of direct payments made for positive coverage (&quot;dollar journalism&quot;).

Yeltsin had managed to enlist Russia&#x27;s emerging business elite to work in his campaign, including those who ran media corporations. This included Vladimir Gusinsky, owner of Most Bank, Independent Television and NTV. NTV which had, prior to the campaign, been critical towards Yeltsin&#x27;s actions in Chechnya, changed the tone of their coverage. Igor Malashenko, Gusinsky&#x27;s appointed head of NTV, even joined the Yeltsin campaign and led its media relations in a rather visible conflict of interest. In early 1996, Gusinsky and his political rival Boris Berezovsky (chairman of the Board of ORT) decided that they would put aside their differences in order to work together to support the re-election of Yeltsin. By mid-1996, Yeltsin had recruited a team of a handful of financial and media oligarchs to bankroll the Yeltsin campaign and guarantee favorable media coverage the president on national television and in leading newspapers. In return, Yeltsin&#x27;s presidential administration allowed well-connected Russian business leaders to acquire majority stakes in some of Russia&#x27;s most valuable state-owned assets.

To further guarantee consistent media coverage, Yeltsin had fired the chairperson of the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company and replaced him with Eduard Sagalaev in February 1996. While the anti-Communist pro-Yeltsin media bias certainly contributed to Yeltsin&#x27;s victory, it was not the sole factor. A similar anti-Communist media bias in the run-up to the 1995 parliamentary elections had failed to prevent a Communist victory. Additionally, Yeltsin himself had been able to win the 1991 presidential election in spite of a strongly unfavorable media bias towards him.

===Violations of campaign laws===
Following the election, a financial fraud investigation (the Xerox affair) was launched against Yeltsin&#x27;s campaign. Yeltsin&#x27;s campaign disregarded numerous campaign regulations. Analysis has indicated that Yeltsin&#x27;s campaign spent well in excess of spending limits. Yeltsin also violated a law against broadcasting advertisements before 15 March. Yeltsin undertook many abuses of his power in order to assist his campaign effort.

===Fraud===
Some instances of fraud were indicated to have taken place; the various political actors, including the opposition, did not challenge the result. The Central Election Commission (CEC) found in 1996 that the original second-round results reported from Mordovia were falsified. A significant number of votes that had been cast for Zyuganov were recorded as &quot;Against All Candidates&quot;. The vote totals from Mordovia were subsequently adjusted by the CEC in order to remedy this. The CEC also discovered fraud in Dagestan, an ethnic republic which had experienced a very improbable change in voting patterns between rounds, and the vote totals were revised to remedy this. Another instance of fraud was discovered in Karachay-Cherkessia by the CEC. The vote totals were adjusted to remedy for this as well.

====Allegations of unfairness and fraud==== 
There have been a number of allegations claiming further and greater instances of fraud than the instances that had been discovered by the CEC. They include a number of allegations that assert that the election was unfair and favored Yeltsin, as well as some allegations that go as far as to assert that the entire election was fraudulent. In addition to federal subjects in which fraud was discovered by the CEC, some results, such as those from Russia&#x27;s ethnic republics of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, showed highly-unlikely changes in voting patterns between the two rounds of voting. That has aroused suspicions of election fraud, although any fraud that may have contributed to those discrepancies is unlikely to have had a material effect on the outcome of the election. One hypothesis that has been given for the dramatic increase in support that Yeltsin saw in some regions was that prior to the second round vote, administrative pressure was applied in those regions to coerce voters into supporting Yeltsin.

Allegations have been made by some that in the first round of the election, several regions of Russia committed electoral fraud in favor of Zyuganov. It has also been further alleged by some that several of the republics switched the direction of their fraud during the second round to favor Yeltsin instead. Mikhail Gorbachev voiced a belief that the results of the election were falsified. He stated that he believes that the results underreported his actual share of the vote. At a meeting with opposition leaders in 2012, the then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev was reported to have said: &quot;There is hardly any doubt who won [that race]. It was not Boris Nikolaevich Yeltsin.&quot;

===American influence===
After the election, a group of American consultants that worked for the Yeltsin campaign sought to take credit for Yeltsin&#x27;s successful re-election in a profile published in the July 1996 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine with the headline &quot;Yanks to the Rescue&quot;. Their account was later the basis of the 2003 comedy &quot;Spinning Boris&quot;; there was reporting that indicated that their work for Yeltsin&#x27;s campaign did not play a consequential role in shaping the campaign, with &quot;Time&quot; receiving accusations of poor journalism and sensationalism for publishing the consultants&#x27; claims about their importance to the campaign without practicing skepticism. Additionally, it had not at all been unusual for foreign consultants to work on campaigns in the nation&#x27;s fledgling electoral politics.

Knowing that his voter base was pro-Western, Yeltsin lobbied the then United States president Bill Clinton to speak in praising terms of Russia&#x27;s transition to democracy. Yeltsin believed that this would strengthen his support from voters. Yeltsin warned Clinton of the possible ramifications of a Zyuganov victory, saying: &quot;There is a U.S. press campaign suggesting that people should not be afraid of the communists; that they are good, honorable and kind people. I warn people not to believe this. More than half of them are fanatics; they would destroy everything. It would mean civil war. They would abolish the boundaries between the republics. They want to take back Crimea; they even make claims against Alaska. ... There are two paths for Russia&#x27;s development. I do not need power. But when I felt the threat of communism, I decided that I had to run. We will prevent it.&quot; In their conversations, Clinton assured Yeltsin that he would give him his publicly declared personal endorsement, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to say to the Russian people &#x27;this election will have consequences,&#x27; and we are clear about what it is we support.&quot; Yeltsin made other requests, such as admission into the G8 (not granted), a $2.5 billion direct cash loan to the government (not granted), and a delay in NATO expansion (granted). Clinton refrained from undertaking covert operations to support Yeltsin in order to prevent spurring backlash if such efforts were to be discovered.

In January 1997, observing the support Yeltsin had received in 1996 from the Clinton administration, former candidate Alexander Lebed visited the United States to rally support from American businesses for a potential run in the 2000 Russian presidential election. As one analyst wrote at the time, &quot;[Lebed] may perceive that Yeltsin benefited greatly from support from the Americans in the last campaign. Clinton made a trip to Moscow during the campaign. And the International Monetary Fund extended loans that enabled the Government to make credible promises to pay wages.&quot; Some argued that the role of the Clinton administration in securing an International Monetary Fund loan for Russia had an impact on the election, with some critics characterizing it as an act of foreign electoral intervention.

<text>The Church of Our Lady, Mary of Zion is an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church which is claimed to contain the Ark of the Covenant. 

The church is located in the town of Axum, Tigray Region in northern Ethiopia, near the grounds of Obelisks of Axum. The original church is believed to have been built during the reign of Ezana the first Christian ruler of the Kingdom of Axum (present-day Eritrea and Ethiopia), during the 4th century AD, and has been rebuilt several times since then. Women are not permitted entry into the “Old Church”; the Blessed Virgin Mary, representing the archetype of the Ark, is the only woman allowed within its premises.

== History ==
Since its founding during the episcopacy of Frumentius, the first Bishop of Axum, (known in Ethiopia as &quot;Abune Selama Kesatie Birhan&quot; or &quot;Our Father of Peace the Revealer of Light&quot;), the Church of Mary of Zion has been destroyed and rebuilt at least twice. Its first putative destruction occurred at the hands of Queen Gudit during the 10th century. Its second, confirmed, destruction occurred in the 16th century at the hands of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, after which it was rebuilt by the Emperor Gelawdewos, then further rebuilt and enlarged by Fasilides during the 17th century. Francisco Álvares, who was in Ethiopia before its destruction, describes it as follows:

The church of Saint Mary of Zion was the traditional place where Ethiopian Emperors came to be crowned. Which indeed meant if an Emperor was not crowned at Axum, or did not at least have his coronation ratified by a special service at St. Mary of Zion, he could not be referred to by the title of &quot;Atse&quot;.

The church is a significant center of pilgrimage for the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, especially during the “Festival of Zion Mariam” on 30 November (21 Hidar on the Ethiopian calendar).

=== Tigray War===
In mid-December 2020 during the Tigray War, according to Europe External Programme with Africa (EEPA), 750 people who were hiding in the church were brought out and killed by militants. Locals suspected an intention to steal the Ark of the Covenant, but no evidence of that allegations has been found to date.

A more recent report by Amnesty International points to war crimes committed by Eritrean troops in and around Aksum, and &quot;de facto&quot; desacralisation of the church, but these reports have not been confirmed by independent investigation or by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission.

The Ethiopian government has blocked forensic investigators from accessing the church grounds, and also blocked all external attempts at investigating human rights violations that occurred both at the church and in Axum. The International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia (ICHREE) has called for the Ethiopian government to &quot;provide unhindered access to the ICHREE and other independent investigative bodies, alongside independent media, to thoroughly examine these allegations of human rights violations&quot;, but as of August 2023 the government continues to block independent investigation.

== Ark of the Covenant ==

The Church of Saint Mary of Zion claims to contain the original Ark of the Covenant. 

Accordingly, the Ark was moved to the Chapel of the Tablet adjacent to the old church because a divine &#x27;heat&#x27; from the Tablets had cracked the stones of its previous inner sanctum. The Ethiopian Empress Menen funded the construction of the present chapel. 

According to pious tradition, the Ark came to Ethiopia with Crown prince Menelik I after he visited his father King Solomon in Jerusalem.

On 9 June 1992, a former professor of Ethiopian Studies at the University of London, Edward Ullendorff, declared that he personally examined the ark contained within the church in 1941 while serving as an officer of the British Army. He described the ark as empty, and a “Middle- to late-medieval construction [from] when these were fabricated ad hoc.&quot;

At present, only the guardian monk may view the Ark, in accordance with the Biblical accounts of the dangers of doing so for non-Kohanim. This lack of accessibility, and questions about the account as a whole, has led Ethiopians and foreign scholars alike to express doubt about the veracity of the claim. The guardian monk is appointed for life by his predecessor before the predecessor dies. If the incumbent guardian dies without naming a successor, then the monks of the monastery hold an election to select the new guardian. The guardian then is confined to the chapel of the Ark of the Covenant for the rest of his life, praying before it and offering incense.

<text>The Holland Harbor Light, known as Big Red, is located in Park Township, Michigan at the entrance of a channel connecting Lake Michigan with Lake Macatawa, and which gives access to the city of Holland, Michigan.

The lighthouse is on the south side of the channel. There are two modern lights marking the ends of the breakwaters that extend out into the Lake Michigan beyond the lighthouse.

==History==

After decades of local requests that went unanswered, in 1870 the United States Lighthouse Board finally recommended construction of the first light at Holland Harbor. It was thereupon approved by the U.S. Congress.

Text of the Michigan Historic Site marker:
:When seeking a location for himself and his Dutch emigrant followers in 1847, the Reverend A. C. Van Raalte was attracted by the potential of using Black Lake (Lake Macatawa) as a harbor. However, the lake&#x27;s outlet to Lake Michigan was blocked by sandbars and silt. Van Raalte appealed to Congress for help. The channel was surveyed in 1849, but was not successfully opened due to inadequate appropriations. Frustrated, the Dutch settlers dug the channel themselves. On July 1, 1859, the small steamboat Huron put into port. Here, in 1886, the government established the harbor&#x27;s first lifesaving station. By 1899 the channel had been relocated and harbor work completed. This spurred business and resort expansion. In 1900 over 1,095 schooners, steamers and barges used the harbor.
:The first lighthouse built at this location was a small, square wooden structure erected in 1872, after the U.S. Congress, appropriated $4,000 to the project. This was in large part due to Senator Thomas Ferry&#x27;s influence. In 1880 the lighthouse service installed a new light atop a metal pole in a protective cage. The oil lantern was lowered by pulleys for service. At the turn of the century, a steel tower was built for the light and in 1907 the present structure was erected. Named the Holland Harbor South Pierhead Lighthouse, it has a gabled roof that reflects the Dutch influence in the area. The lighthouse, popularly referred to as &quot;Big Red,&quot; was automated in 1932. When the U. S. Coast Guard recommended that it be abandoned in 1970, citizens circulated petitions to rescue it. The Holland Harbor Lighthouse Historical Commission was then organized to preserve and restore this landmark.

Except for its color, it is a virtual twin of the Kewaunee Pierhead Light on the Wisconsin side of Lake Michigan.

In 2007, the United States Department of the Interior announced that the Holland Harbor Light would be protected, making it the 12th Michigan lighthouse to have such status.

==Accessibility==
Public access to Big Red is restricted due to the fact one must cross private property to see the lighthouse up close. The best vantage points that are accessible to the general public are from across the channel at Holland State Park.

<doc id="882183" wikidata="Q608824" url="?curid=882183" title="BMW 3 Series (E36)">
<text>The third generation of the BMW 3 Series range of compact executive cars is designated under the model code E36, and was produced by the German automaker BMW from 1990 to 2000. The initial models were of the four-door saloon body style, followed by the coupé, convertible, wagon (&quot;Touring&quot;), and eventually hatchback (&quot;Compact&quot;).

The E36 was the first 3 Series to be offered in a hatchback body style. It was also the first 3 Series to be available with a six-speed manual transmission (in the 1996 M3), a five-speed automatic transmission, and a four-cylinder diesel engine. The multi-link rear suspension was also a significant upgrade as compared to the previous generations of the 3 Series. All-wheel drive was not available for the E36, unlike the previous (E30) and successive (E46) generations.

The E36 was named in &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s 10Best list for every year it was on sale.

Following the introduction of its successor, the E46 3 Series in 1998, the E36 began to be phased out and was eventually replaced in 1999.

== Development and launch ==
Development of the E36 began in 1981 and the exterior design was heavily influenced by aerodynamics, specifically the overall wedge shape, headlight covers and smaller wing mirrors. The lead designers were Pinky Lai and Boyke Boyer.

The production version of the E36 was launched in October 1990, with press release in November and market launch in early 1991. The Touring (E36/3) did not go on sale until March 1995, with the Touring version of the previous generation having remained on sale until April 1994 alongside the E36 saloons and coupés. At first, the Touring was only offered in 320i and 328i versions; in July 1995 the 318 tds Touring arrived, followed by the 318i in September.

== Body styles ==
The body styles of the range are:
* 4-door saloon, produced from 1990 to 1998.
* 2-door coupé, produced from 1990 to 1999.
* 2-door convertible, produced from 1993 to 1999. A 4-door Baur &quot;Top Cabriolet&quot; (TC4) conversion was also available.
* 5-door wagon (marketed as &quot;Touring&quot;), produced from November 1994 to 1999. 105,606 examples were built.
* 3-door hatchback (&quot;see BMW 3 Series Compact&quot;), produced from 1994 to 2000.

==Design==
All models are rear-wheel drive since the E36 was not produced with all-wheel drive (unlike its predecessor and successor). The E36 chassis was all new, using the &quot;Z-axle&quot; multilink suspension proven in the 1989 BMW Z1, and designed with rear toe-in to minimize the oversteering characteristics of the preceding generation. Unlike the other body styles, the hatchback (known as the &quot;E36/5&quot; or &quot;BMW Compact&quot;) used a rear semi-trailing arm suspension based on the older E30 instead, in order to save space due to its truncated rear end.

The E36 was produced with the following transmissions:
* 5-speed manual (1996-1999 M3 U.S) ZF S5D320Z
* 5-speed manual (1994-1995 M3) ZF S5D310Z
* 6-speed manual (1996-1999 M3- except for the United States) Getrag 420g
* 4-speed automatic
* 5-speed automatic

Available safety equipment included a driver&#x27;s airbag, passenger airbag (from 1993 production) and side impact airbags in later models, ABS braking and stability control (&quot;ASC +T&quot;). The dashboard was designed to accommodate the passenger side airbag from the beginning, which limited the size of the glove compartment. Available in the Saloon and Touring, a rear seat with two integrated children&#x27;s booster seats was a first for BMW.

Electronic climate control was also available on the E36. In North America, cars equipped with the &quot;Winter Package&quot; also have heated seats and side mirrors.

== Engines ==
=== Petrol ===
The four-cylinder petrol engines used in the E36 range were initially engines carried over from the previous generation 3 Series: the BMW M40 SOHC engine and the BMW M42 DOHC engine. In 1993, the M40 was replaced by the BMW M43 SOHC engine and the M42 was replaced in 1996 by the BMW M44 DOHC engine. To retain a 50/50 weight distribution (on petrol models), versions fitted with the heavier, six-cylinder engines had the battery relocated to the trunk.

For the six-cylinder models, the E36 was launched with the then-new BMW M50 DOHC petrol engine. In late 1992 the M50TU versions added single-VANOS (variable valve timing), which increased torque (peak power was unchanged). In 1995, the BMW M52 engine replaced the M50TU, resulting in the 328i model replacing the 325i and the addition of a new mid-range 323i model (powered by a 2.5 litre version of the M52).

In 1992, the 3.0 L BMW S50 engine debuted in the E36 M3. In 1995, its capacity was increased to 3.2 L.

===Diesel===
Initially, the turbocharged straight-six BMW M51 engine was used in the E36 325td model. In 1993, the 325tds model was released, which added an intercooler to the M51. In 1994, the 318tds model was introduced, powered by the four-cylinder BMW M41 turbocharged and intercooled engine. Diesel engines were only available in saloon, touring and compact body styles. The coupe and convertible only had petrol engines.

== M3 model ==

The E36 M3 was launched in 1992 and was powered by the BMW S50 and BMW S52 straight-six engines rather than the four-cylinder units used in the E30. Unlike the predecessor, it was no longer a homologation special and was not developed expressly with competition in mind. It was produced in coupé, saloon, and convertible body styles. 

== Alpina models ==
E36-based Alpina production began in 1991 with the release of the Alpina B6 2.8/2, with an upgraded M50-derived engine. A Japanese market exclusive B6 2.8/2 wagon was produced between 1996 and 1998.

In 1993, the 2.8/2 was replaced by the B6 3.0, following the introduction of the 3 litre S50 engine that was used in the new M3 models. Alpina models were now offered in convertible and touring form as well, rather than just in coupe and saloon models. Again in 1996, Alpina introduced the B3 3.2, following the S50 engine&#x27;s upgrade to 3.2 litres. With the new 3.2 models, Alpinas were now based on the 328i and its 2.8L engine, rather than 325i models.

In 1995, the B8 was released. The B8 4.6 was based on the 4 litre V8 from the E34 5-series, put into a 328i-based shell. BMW V8s had coated bores which meant new blocks had to be cast by BMW specifically for Alpina V8s. Fitting the V8 into the engine bay required numerous adjustments to both the body and engine parts; and even then, it was still a tight fit. The B8 4.6 produced a claimed 333 horsepower and 470 Nm of torque. Production of the B8 4.6 ended in late 1998.

For a short time, Alpina produced the B8 4.0, making 313 horsepower and 410 Nm of torque. Only an estimated 5 models are known to exist, and they were all sold in Japan.

All Alpina models featured Alpina&#x27;s distinctive 20 spoke rims, as well as optional striping. Alpina models also had special aerodynamic pieces, including an Alpina-branded front lip and rear spoiler. Changes to the interior were also present in Alpina models, including new blue instrument panels, wooden trim, new seats and steering wheel.

== E36/5 Compact ==

The &quot;3 Series Compact&quot; range of three-door hatchback models was introduced in 1993, based on a shortened version of the E36 platform. The model code for the hatchback body style is &quot;E36/5&quot; and the model range consisted of 316i, 316g, 318ti, 323ti, and 318tds.
== Z3 Roadster/Coupé ==
A modified version of the E36 platform was used for the 1996-2002 Z3 roadster (model code E36/7) and coupé (model code E36/8).
== North American model range ==
The North American model range consisted of the models listed below. The 318i models were powered by the BMW M42 engine until 1995, and later the BMW M44 engine which was used in the 318is model sold in other countries. In North America, the &quot;is&quot; suffix was applied to the coupés.


== European model range ==
The European model range had more variety than the North American and included diesel engines and the station wagon &quot;Touring&quot; body styles. The European market range had more low-range models than the North American, for example, the 316i and 318i had 8-valve SOHC engines. The M3 was also more expensive and had more horsepower than the North American version.

== Production ==
The E36 was produced in Munich, Germany; Regensburg, Germany; Rosslyn, South Africa; and Spartanburg County, South Carolina, United States.

Local assembly of complete knock-down (CKD) kits was used for cars sold in Uruguay (until 1991), Egypt, Mexico, and Thailand. The E36 was also built as CKD kits in the Philippines starting from 1994 up until 1997, where production halted due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

==Motorsports==

Joachim Winkelhock competed in the British Touring Car Championship with the 318i and 320i from 1993 to 1995, winning the title in 1993. In the same year, Johnny Cecotto won the German ADAC GT Cup driving an E36 M3. Cecotto won the Super Tourenwagen Cup for BMW in 1994 and 1998, while Winkelhock won in 1995. Steve Soper won the Japanese Touring Car Championship in 1995 with a works BMW 318i.

Geoff Brabham and his younger brother David Brabham won the 1997 AMP Bathurst 1000 at the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, Australia driving a Super Touring BMW 320i for BMW Motorsport Australia.

The 1998 24 Hours Nürburgring was won by a diesel-engined car for the first time – a BMW E36 320d, aided by its diesel engine requiring fewer fuel stops than rivals.

<doc id="882184" wikidata="Q756792" url="?curid=882184" title="BMW 3 Series (E46)">
<text>The BMW 3 Series (E46) is the fourth generation of the BMW 3 Series range of compact executive cars manufactured by German automaker BMW. Produced from 1997 to 2006, it was the successor to the E36 3 Series, which ceased production in 2000. It was introduced in November 1997, and available in sedan, coupé, convertible, station wagon and hatchback body styles. The latter has been marketed as the 3 Series Compact.

The M3 performance model was introduced in June 2000 with a 2-door coupé body style, followed by the convertible counterpart in April 2001. The M3 is powered by the BMW S54 straight-six engine with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed SMG-II automated manual transmission.

The E46 line-up was phased out starting from late 2004, following the introduction of the E90 3 Series sedans. However, the E46 coupé and convertible body styles remained in production until August 2006.

== Overview ==

=== Development ===
In 1993, the development programme for the E46 began under the lead of chief engineer Wolfgang Ziebart and head of R&amp;D Wolfgang Reitzle. In late 1993, design work began under the lead of chief designer Chris Bangle and continued into 1995. In May 1995, the general exterior design of the E46 by Erik Goplen of DesignworksUSA was approved and as a result DesignworksUSA was contracted by BMW to work alongside BMW Group&#x27;s in-house design team to create the exterior bodywork for the 3 Series range in February 1996. The design team put an emphasis on improving aerodynamics and increasing the car&#x27;s aggressive stance. Design patents were filed in Germany on 16 July 1997 and in the US on 16 January 1998.

Chris Bangle and Wolfgang Reitzle were responsible through 1995 for the production sedan&#x27;s exterior, as evident in the 1997 design patent. Production development of the sedan took 24 months following design freeze and was 31 months from executive board styling approval in 1995 to its start of series production in December 1997. Erik Goplen designed the production coupé, convertible and station wagon during between 1996 and 1997. The E46 sedan was unveiled via press release on 11 November 1997 and was launched on the market at the end of April 1998 with customer deliveries.

=== Chassis ===
The body shell of the E46 was claimed by BMW to be 70% more rigid than its E36 predecessor. Aluminium was used for an increased quantity of suspension components, in order to decrease unsprung mass. However, with a curb weight of , the E46 328ci is heavier than the E36 equivalent.

In tune with BMW&#x27;s core values regarding handling dynamics, the E46 was initially available with a rear-wheel drive layout and a 50/50 weight distribution. All-wheel drive, which was last available in the 3 Series in 1991, was reintroduced for the E46 on the 325xi, 330xi and 330xd models.

=== Electronics ===
The electronic components in the E46 are more integrated than previous generations of 3 Series, including the use of a CAN bus system. Drivetrain information (such as engine, transmission and stability control) is communicated using the CAN bus. Vehicle electronics (such as the radio, navigation, television and telecommunications) can communicate to each other via the K-bus.

The E46 was the first 3 Series to be available with an engine using Valvetronic (variable valve lift). Various electronic features were also introduced to the 3 Series in the E46 generation, including satellite navigation, electronic brake-force distribution, rain-sensing wipers and LED tail-lights.

=== Production and sales ===
The E46 was produced in Germany (Leipzig, Munich and Regensburg) and in South Africa (Rosslyn). Local assembly of complete knock-down (CKD) kits was used for cars sold in China, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand and Russia.

The highest selling year for the E46 chassis was 2002, when 561,249 vehicles were sold worldwide.

== Body styles ==
The body styles of the range are:

* 4-door sedan/saloon (E46/4), produced from December 1997 to May 2005 (CKD production continued until December 2005). 1,918,984 examples built (includes 54,528 CKD).
* 2-door coupé (E46/2), produced from December 1998 to May 2006. 443,264 examples built.
* Cabriolet – 2-door convertible (E46/2C), produced from December 1999 to November 2006. 277,146 examples built.
* Touring – 5-door wagon/estate (E46/3), produced from January 1999 to May 2005. 428,061 examples built.
* Compact – 3-door hatchback (E46/5), produced from April 2000 to December 2004. 199,430 examples built.
=== 3 Series Compact (E46/5) ===
The shorter three-door hatchback version of the E46 was marketed as the BMW 3 Series Compact. The exterior styling has several differences to the rest of the E46 3 Series range, notably the distinctive headlights and tail-lights. Mechanically, the Compact shares many elements with the rest of the E46 range, however the steering rack has a faster ratio.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.rac.co.uk E46/5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==M3==

The E46 M3 was introduced in October 2000, available with the 3.2-litre S54 M-tuned engine. It was offered in coupé and convertible body styles.

The M3&#x27;s S54 engine has a redline of 8,000 rpm. As with most M engines, the S54 has 6 individual throttle bodies, in this case electronically operated (drive-by-wire throttle). The transmission options for the M3 were a 6-speed manual or the 6-speed &quot;SMG-II&quot; automated manual transmission.

There was also a lighter and faster M3 CSL model; CSL stands for &quot;Coupé Sport Leichtbau&quot; (&quot;Coupé Sport Lightweight). Weight was reduced by removing equipment and replacing the roof, door panel, and centre console with carbon fibre pieces.

=== M3 GTR road car ===

In order for the M3 GTR race car to compete in the American Le Mans Series, BMW produced 10 examples of the &quot;M3 GTR Straßen Version&quot; (street version) in 2001. As per the race M3 GTR, the roadgoing Version was powered by the BMW P60B40 4.0 L V8 engine which was slightly detuned and generated a maximum power output of at 7,000 rpm. Power was delivered to the rear wheels via a race type 6-speed dual clutch sequential transmission with M locking differential. The engine featured dry sump lubrication as its racing counterpart and bigger radiators.

The stiffer chassis and suspension system were a carryover from the race version. The car was lowered further than a standard M3 and featured additional strut braces between the firewall and strut towers as well as between the right shock towers. The redesigned front and rear fascias and the rear wing optimised aerodynamics.

The roof, the hood, the rear wing and front and rear fascias were made from carbon-fibre in order to reduce weight. Notable changes made to the interior included leather Recaro bucket seats, removal of rear seats and special M3 GTR sill plates.

== Alpina models ==

The Alpina &quot;B3 3.3&quot; and &quot;B3 S&quot; were based on the E46 and were powered by inline-six petrol engines.

== Special models ==
=== Performance package (ZHP) ===
The Performance Package was an option sold in North America, which is commonly referred to by its order code in the United States, ZHP (the order code in Canada was ZAM). It was available for 330i sedans from model years 2003 to 2005, and available for 330ci coupés and convertibles from 2004 to 2006. It included various aesthetic changes over the regular 3 series, as well as functional and mechanical enhancements.

The ZHP was equipped with sportier camshafts and revised engine tuning to increase power output from as well as a shorter final drive gear ratio, and a corresponding increase in redline from 6,500 rpm to 6,800 rpm. Suspension was modified over the standard suspension with firmer springs and dampers, larger anti-roll bars, stronger front control arm ball joints, a lower ride height, heavy duty steering rack, and slightly more negative camber. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine track-tested the car, which recorded a 0– acceleration time of 5.6 seconds and a 1/4 mile time of 14.3 seconds.

=== 325i SULEV ===
In some parts of the United States, BMW sold a version of the 325i which met the super ultra low emission vehicle (SULEV) emissions standards. California, New York, and Massachusetts received the SULEV E46&#x27;s in 2003, and Vermont in 2004. They utilised a variant of the M54 engine named the BMW M56. The M56 meets SULEV standards, as well as partial zero emission vehicle (PZEV) and zero evaporative emissions requirements. The M56 is claimed to have identical power output as its M54 counterpart.
=== 320Ci/325Ci/330Ci Clubsport ===
The Clubsport package was available only for the 320Ci/325Ci/330Ci M-Sport models in 2002 and came in these colours: Estoril Blue, Velvet Blue, Titanium Silver and Carbon Black. The package removed 20 kg insulation materials, added an optional rear M spoiler and two spoiler lips on the front bumper, and chromed exhaust tailpipes. Style 71, M-Double Spoke Split rim wheels were standard while interior equipment included M short gear shift, aluminum or black &quot;Alu-Tech&quot; trims, silver rings on cluster, door sills with &quot;M Clubsport&quot; letters, and an interior finished in half-leather and half-fabric &quot;M Texture&quot; cloth. The Clubsport was offered with the 5/6-Speed manual, 6-Speed SMG, or 5-Speed Steptronic transmissions.

== Motorsport ==
Andy Priaulx won the 2004 European Touring Car Championship season and 2005 World Touring Car Championship season championships driving a 320i. Franz Engstler won the 2006 Asian Touring Car Championship season in a 320i.

The E46 has also competed in the British, European and Russian touring car championships.

In the United States, the National Auto Sport Association and BMW Car Club of America (BMW CCA) organized a &quot;Spec E46&quot; amateur racing series. The Spec E46 cars were built to a standard with limited modifications, to create a level playing field and increased competition between drivers. By mid-2020, Spec E46 had become one of BMW CCA&#x27;s three largest racing classes.

<text>The marginal nucleus of spinal cord, posteromarginal nucleus, or spinal lamina 1 (Rexed lamina 1) is located at the most dorsal aspect of the posterior grey column of the spinal cord. The neurons located here receive input primarily from Lissauer&#x27;s tract and relay information related to pain and temperature sensation. Pain sensation relayed here cannot be modulated, e.g. pain from burning the skin.
The axons of neurons contribute to the lateral spinothalamic tract.

<doc id="882187" wikidata="Q1146966" url="?curid=882187" title="BMW 3 Series (E90)">
<text>The fifth generation of the BMW 3 Series range of compact executive cars is designated under the model codes E90 (saloon), E91 (estate, marketed as &#x27;Touring&#x27;), E92 (coupé) and E93 (convertible). The model was introduced in December 2004, and produced by BMW until October 2013 and is often collectively referred to as the E90, E9x, or occasionally, the E92.

The E92 335i was the first 3 Series model produced with a turbocharged petrol engine. It was also the first 3 Series to include the iDrive operating system, which consists of navigation, infotainment and essential vehicle functions. The E9x saw the introduction of run-flat tyres to the 3 Series range. Models with run-flat tires are not equipped with a spare tyre. 

The E90/E92/E93 M3 is the only generation of M3 to be powered by a V8 engine. Introduced in 2007, it uses the BMW S65 naturally aspirated V8 engine and was produced in saloon, coupé and convertible body styles.

Following the introduction of the F30/F31 3 Series in February 2012, the E90/E91 saloons and estates were phased out. However due to their later introduction, the E92/E93 coupés and convertibles remained in production through the 2013 model year, after which they were replaced by the F32/F33 4 Series models.

== Development and launch ==

The design for the fifth generation 3 Series was frozen in mid-2002, approximately 30 months before the start of production. The saloon and estate were designed by Joji Nagashima. Marc Michael Markefka designed the coupé and convertible.

The range was introduced in March 2005 for MY2005 with the saloon and estate body styles. The coupé was introduced in 2006 and the convertible was introduced in 2007, both for MY2007. 

Significant cosmetic and mechanical changes were done to improve the design and performance compared to the previous generation. The E90 series is larger than its predecessor, with a longer wheelbase, wider tracks, and a roomier interior.
== Body styles ==
=== Sedan (E90) ===
The sedan model was the first model sold of the E90/E91/E92/E93 3 series, being launched on 5 March 2005 for the 2006 model year. Production continued until a facelift revision was made for the 2009 model year. Production of the E90 concluded after the 2011 model year, succeeded by the F30 for 2012.

=== Touring (E91) ===
The E91 wagon/estate models were marketed as &#x27;Touring&#x27; in Europe and &#x27;Sports Wagon&#x27; in North America. Optional equipment included a panoramic sunroof, which extends to the rear passenger area. Trim levels typically were similar to the E90 saloon, however the M3 was not produced in the estate body style.

Several markets outside Europe only offered a small subset of models in the estate body style. In the United States and Canada, the only estate model available prior to 2007 was the 325xi, and then the 328i and 328xi from 2007 onwards. The Australian market received only a handful of models which included the 320i, 320d and 323i until the end of its production. No X-Drive models were ever sold in Australia of the E9x series.

=== Coupé (E92) ===
In July 2006, one year after the saloon was introduced, the E92 coupé body style was unveiled.

Compared with previous generations of the 3 Series, the coupé has more external styling differences to the saloon models. These include the tail-light design (L-shaped on the coupe), more steeply angled headlights and smaller side windows. As per its E46 predecessor, the doors of the coupe are longer and have frameless door windows, the rear seat holds two passengers (compared with a three-person bench for the saloon) with a rear centre console tray and the front seatbelts are on motorised arms that extend from the B-pillar to hand the seatbelts to the driver and/or passenger.

The E92 was the last generation to include coupé (and convertible) body styles as a part of the 3 Series range. For later generations, these body styles are marketed as the 4 Series. Despite the E90/E91 being phased out for the F30/F31 after the 2011 model year, the E92/E93 continued through the 2013 model year. It was then succeeded by the F32/F33 for the 2014 model year.

=== Convertible (E93) ===
The E93 convertible was BMW&#x27;s first model to use a retractable hardtop (folding metal roof), instead of the cloth roof as previously used. The E93 was one of first retractable hardtops in its price range. The &quot;Comfort Access&quot; option allows the roof to be raised and lowered using the key fob. The E93&#x27;s side windows are 30 per cent larger than its E46 convertible predecessor, resulting in a 38 per cent increase in visibility.

The BMW 3 Series convertible was often priced higher than direct rivals, however reviewers have praised its passenger/boot space (even with the roof down), driving dynamics, weight and chassis rigidity.
== Engines ==
=== Petrol ===
Official specifications are as follows:

Since the following generation of 3 Series used turbocharged engines for the entire model range, the E90/E91/E92/E93 was the last 3 Series to be available with naturally aspirated engines.

In North American, Australian and Malaysian markets the N53 was not used, instead the entire model range continued to use its predecessor, the N52 engine.

In some areas of the United States, the 328i was powered by the BMW N51 straight-six engine and sold as a SULEV model.

In some parts of the world, 4-cylinder models continued to use the N46 engine as the local fuel quality is incompatible with the N43 engine.

=== Diesel ===
== Suspension ==
At the front, MacPherson struts with an aluminum hub carrier and aluminum dual lower links forming a virtual pivot point are used. This design was previously used on all 5, 7 and 8 series BMW models.

The rear suspension is a 5-link Multi-link suspension, with fabricated steel subframe, fabricated steel control arms, and cast iron carrier. This design is designated &quot;HA 5&quot; by BMW.

== Wheels ==
The BMW E90+ has a 5x120 bolt pattern with wheel sizes ranging from 16 inch to 20 inch in diameter. There have been 49 original wheel styles produced for this model.

== Equipment ==

Optional features (some of which are standard on higher models) include Xenon headlamps, automatic climate control, parking sensors, power-adjustable seats, satellite navigation, glass sunroof, heated front seats, Bluetooth and USB audio input.

Optional equipment could be ordered individually or combined into packages. Optional interior colours, known as BMW Individual, were also available at extra cost.

The contents of the &#x27;Premium Package&#x27; varied according to model year and market. It included items such as leather seats with power adjustments, memory seat function, lumbar support, auto-dimming mirrors, a digital compass, auto-folding exterior mirrors, BMW Assist w/Bluetooth, and universal garage opener.

The &#x27;Cold Weather Package&#x27; includes headlight washers, heated front seats and split/folding rear seats with a ski bag.

The &#x27;Sports Package&#x27; includes a leather 3-prong sports steering wheel, sports front seats, 18-inch wheels, sports suspension and an increase in the speed limiter to .

The &#x27;Technology Package&#x27; includes iDrive, navigation, keyless entry (&quot;Comfort Access&quot;), selectable driving modes (&quot;M Drive&quot;), HD radio and Electronic Damping Control.

The &#x27;Performance Power Kit&#x27; (PPK) was introduced for the 335i and was available for installation at BMW dealerships, it included a tune that boosted engine output for the 335i to &amp; for automatic transmission vehicles and for manual transmission vehicles, an overall gain of &amp; , BMW claim their engineers have tested and designed these Performance Power Kits in such a way that equipped vehicles would not sacrifice reliability or fuel consumption, the result was a claimed 0.2 second decrease in 0 to times, the kit was available for both N54 &amp; N55 335i vehicles, it was easily verified if a vehicle was equipped with the PPK as during installation stickers that read &quot;BMW Performance Power Kit&quot; were placed near the air intake on all equipped vehicles, the N55 equipped 335i vehicles also featured added exhaust burbles included as part of the PPK tune, also included in the PPK was the addition of an extra radiator, higher performance fans on the main radiator and better air flow ducts in attempt to deal with any extra heat caused by the tuning.

== M3 model ==


The M3 model was powered by the BMW S65 V8 engine and produced in saloon, coupe and convertible body styles.
== Alpina models ==
The Alpina B3 and D3 models were based on the E90/E91/E92/E93. The B3 was powered by turbocharged 6-cylinder petrol engine and the D3 was powered by a turbocharged 4-cylinder diesel engine.

== Special Editions ==
=== 320si ===
To satisfy homologation requirements for the FIA World Touring Car Championship (WTCC), BMW built 2600 units of the 320si. The car featured N45 (N45B20S) engine producing , 24bhp more than the regular 320i. It also featured revised suspension and 20% lower front bumper.

=== 335is ===

The 335is was produced in coupé and convertible models for the North American market, with approximately 4,500 units manufactured. The 335is uses a higher performance version of the N54 engine, which increases boost from . This results in and of torque, plus an overboost function raises torque to for up to 7 seconds. The 335is was positioned between the regular 335i (which had switched from the N54 to the N55 engine for the 2011 model year, both engines rated at ) and the M3 in the BMW 3 Series coupé/convertible lineup. 

For the 335is the transmission options were a 7-speed double clutch transmission (DCT) with launch control (compared to the 335i that has a 6-speed Steptronic automatic), or a 6-speed manual transmission that has an upgraded clutch compared to the regular 335i. Other changes compared to the 335i include stiffer engine mounts, a higher-flow exhaust system, an upgraded cooling system, a different steering wheel, sport seats and &quot;335is&quot; badging on dash and in the instrument cluster. Exterior differences are larger air openings in the front bumper, a rear bumper that incorporates a diffuser-style piece, black kidney grills, and 18-inch or 19-inch &quot;Style 313&quot; wheels. The 335is convertible has fog lights which are omitted in the coupé.

== Model year changes ==

=== 2008 Facelift (LCI) ===
In September 2008, the facelift (LCI) versions of the saloon and estate were released for the 2009 model year. Compared to typically subtle BMW LCI changes, these changes were relatively extensive.

Mechanical changes included an increase in rear track of for some models, a power increase for the 320d from and the N57 engine replacing the M57 for the 330d model.

Styling changes included front and rear bumpers, wing mirrors, headlights, taillights, boot lid, wider kidney grilles and revised crease lines for the bonnet. The new 2009 – 2011 facelift (LCI) AWD models became known as &quot;xDrive&quot; models, unlike the previous 2006–2008 (pre-lci) AWD models, which were labeled as &quot;xi&quot; or &quot;xd&quot; models. The new xDrive models received xDrive badges on the bumper and both the right and left sides right below the side marker lamps. 
For the interior, crash-activated head restraints were added to the front seats, the optional &quot;Professional&quot; navigation system was updated, iDrive was updated and the resolution of the display was increased.

=== 2010 ===
For the 2010 model year, the Sport, Lifestyle and Exclusive Edition were introduced for saloon and estate models. The 316d estate model was added, as was the 320d EfficientDynamics Edition saloon.

Mechanical changes included compliance with the EU5 emission standard, EU6 emission compliance (optional) for the 320d and 330d models, power increases for the 318d, 320d, 325d and 330d models, the N54 engine in the 335i being replaced by N55 engine, and additional features for BMW ConnectedDrive.
== Safety ==
The Euro NCAP noted the poor pedestrian protection awarding 4 points out of 36, reporting the 3 Series was &quot;very disappointing&quot; in this measure.

=== IIHS ===
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gives the 3 Series a &quot;Good&quot; overall rating in both the frontal and side impact crash tests. The 3 Series received &quot;Good&quot; marks in all six of the frontal crash test categories, and &quot;Good&quot; marks in six of the nine categories in the side impact test. The IIHS also gave the 3 Series the &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; award. The convertible is rated &quot;Marginal&quot; in side impacts, making the 3 Series convertible the lowest rated vehicle currently sold in its class in IIHS tests.

=== Recalls===
In November 2017, BMW recalled 672,000 3 Series cars from model years 2006–11 with climate control system electronic components at risk of overheating, due to faulty blower motor wiring.

== Production ==
In 2002, Norbert Reithofer and Development Chief Burkhard Goeschel started an initiative to halve the time it took to reach full production of the next generation 3 Series from six months to three.

The E90 was produced in Germany (Leipzig, Munich and Regensburg) and in South Africa (Rosslyn). Local assembly of complete knock-down (CKD) kits were used for cars sold in China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand and Russia.

<text>Eder Jofre (; 26 March 1936 – 2 October 2022) was a Brazilian professional boxer and architect who was both bantamweight and featherweight world champion. He is considered by many to be the greatest bantamweight boxer of all time.

In 2019, he was voted the 16th greatest boxer of all-time, which made him the third greatest living boxer (behind only Roberto Durán and Sugar Ray Leonard) by &quot;&quot;The International Boxing Research Organization&quot;. In 2002, he was named the 19th greatest fighter of the past 80 years by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine. In 1996, he was rated the 9th greatest boxer of the previous 50 years. He is ranked #85 on Ring Magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Punchers Of All Time list.

In 1992, Jofre was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York, and remains the only Brazilian thus honored.

== Amateur career ==
Jofre represented his native country at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia.

=== Olympic results ===
* First round bye
* Defeated Thein Myint (Burma) on points
* Lost to Claudio Barrientos (Chile) on points

== Professional career ==
Éder Jofre, a son of Aristides Jofre, whose nicknames (Eder&#x27;s) were &quot;Galinho de Ouro&quot; (=&quot;Golden Bantam&quot;) and &quot;Jofrinho&quot;&quot;, made his professional debut on 23 March 1957, beating Raul Lopez by knockout in five rounds. He had twelve fights in 1957, including two each against Lopez, Osvaldo Perez, and Ernesto Miranda, the last of whom against whom Jofre sustained his first two record stains: two ten-round draws (ties).

In 1958, Jofre won four more fights, and then, on 14 May of that year, he had his first fight abroad, drawing in ten rounds against Ruben Caceres in Montevideo, Uruguay. On 14 November, Jose Smecca became the only man to drop Jofre in his career; Jofre got up from a first-round knockdown to knock Smecca out in seven rounds.

Jofre won eight fights in 1959, including one against two-time world title challenger Leo Espinoza and a seventh-round knockout in a rematch with Caceres.

On 19 February 1960, he fought Ernesto Miranda for the third time, this time with the South American Bantamweight title on the line. Jofre outpointed Miranda over fifteen rounds to win his first title as a professional. Jofre retained the title with a knockout in three rounds in the fourth fight with Miranda, and, after one more win, he made his U.S. debut, defeating top-ranked challenger Jose Medel by knockout in ten rounds on 16 August in Los Angeles. Next, he defeated the power-punching Ricardo Moreno (later ranked among boxing&#x27;s all-time best punchers by &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;), by a knockout in the sixth round.

On 18 November of that year, Jofre became world champion, when he knocked out Eloy Sanchez in six rounds, in Los Angeles, to claim the vacant WBA World Bantamweight title.

Jofre proved to be a busy world champion, fighting top-notch fighters, both in title engagements and in non-title fights. From 1960 to 1965, he retained his title against Piero Rollo, Ramon Arias (in Caracas, Venezuela), Johnny Caldwell, Herman Marques, Jose Medel, Katsuyoshi Aoki (in Tokyo), Johnny Jamito (in Manila), and Bernardo Caraballo (in Bogotá, Colombia).

In addition, he defeated such fighters as Billy Peacock, Sadao Yaoita, and Fernando Soto in non-title bouts. After the fight with Aoki, Jofre was also recognized as World Bantamweight Champion by the WBC, therefore, becoming the Undisputed World Champion.

On 17 May 1965, his streak as an undefeated fighter was broken when he lost to &quot;Fighting Harada&quot; by a controversial fifteen-round split decision in Nagoya, Japan, to lose the world Bantamweight title.

After losing to Harada by unanimous decision at a rematch held in Tokyo on 1 June 1966, Jofre retired.

In 1969, he made a comeback, beating Rudy Corona by a knockout in six rounds on 26 August. After winning thirteen fights in a row, he challenged for a world title once again: on 5 May 1973, he fought Jose Legra for the Lineal and WBC featherweight titles, in Brasília. Jofre became a two-division world champion by defeating Legra with a fifteen-round majority decision.

Despite having won his second world title, Jofre realized he was nearing the end of the road as far as his boxing career was concerned. He defeated Frankie Crawford in a non-title affair and defended his world Featherweight title against fellow former world Bantamweight champion Vicente Saldivar of Mexico, in a &quot;super fight&quot; held at Salvador. He knocked Saldivar out in four rounds.After a string of fights against lesser opponents, he retired, having beaten the Mexican Octavio Gomez by a unanimous but controversial decision (120 – 110 by judge Antonio Di, 119 – 115 by judge Adriano Carollo and 117 – 116 by judge Américo Vieira) in São Paulo on 8 October 1976. In this last fight, Jofre was slow and uncertain, and himself put in doubt the correctness of the arbiter&#x27;s decision (&quot;Digam o que disserem, eu não venci Famoso Gomez&quot; he said ti the Rio de Janeiro newspaper &quot;O Globo&quot;).

Jofre had a record of 72–2–4 (50 KOs), making him a member of the exclusive group of boxers who have won 50 or more fights by knockout.

== After boxing ==
Jofre worked in politics, serving as an alderman for the city of São Paulo for 16 years. He then worked for DERSA, a state-owned company, working with the highways of São Paulo. In 2004, a DVD of Jofre&#x27;s life titled &quot;O Grande Campeão&quot; was released. On Jofre&#x27;s 85th birthday, in 2021, the first English language biography of his life was released. The book titled &quot;Eder Jofre: Brazil&#x27;s First Boxing World Champion&quot;, by family friend and author Christopher J. Smith won the &quot;&#x27;Book of the Year&#x27;&quot; at the &quot;West Coast Boxing Hall of Fame&quot; in October 2021 at the Loews Hotel in Hollywood, California. Present at the event was Jofre and his son, Marcel, and daughter, Andrea. Jofre was in Los Angeles to be inducted into the &quot;West Coast Boxing Hall of Fame&quot; and on this trip he re-visited the site of his bantamweight world title victory, The Olympic Auditorium - his first visit to the venue since that evening on 18 November 1960.

== Exhibitions and calisthenics ==
Jofre occasionally came out of retirement to fight exhibitions. Some of his more noteworthy exhibitions were against Servilio de Oliveira and Alexis Arguello. In 2010, at age 74, Jofre, a physical fitness fanatic who was still the reflection of great health, put out a calisthenics video.

== Vegetarianism ==
Jofre was a vegetarian. He has been described as one of the few vegetarians ever to win a boxing world championship. He became a vegetarian at the age of 20 after reading a book that stated meat consumption was unhealthy for the body. Jofre adhered to his strict vegetarian diet from the age of 20 and commented in 2019 &quot;I even feel disgust today when I see people eating meat... I eat pasta, rice and beans, boiled potatoes or fried and very sporadically egg. I drink milk, yogurt, curds, and honey&quot;.

==Illness and death==
Jofre suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy. He was hospitalized in March 2022 at a clinic in Embu das Artes because of pneumonia. He died on 2 October due to complications from the disease. He was 86.

<doc id="882192" wikidata="Q897356" url="?curid=882192" title="Brahmo Samaj">
<text>Brahmo Samaj ( ) is the societal component of Brahmoism, which began as a monotheistic reformist movement during the Bengal Renaissance.

It was one of the most influential religious movements in India and made a significant contribution to the making of modern India. It was started at Calcutta on 20 August 1828 by Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Dwarkanath Tagore as reformation of the prevailing customs of the time (specifically Kulin practices) and began the Bengal Renaissance of the 19th century pioneering all religious, social and educational advance of the Bengali community in the 19th century. Its Trust Deed was made in 1830 formalising its inception and it was duly and publicly inaugurated in January 1830 by the consecration of the first house of prayer, now known as the Adi Brahmo Samaj. From the &quot;Brahmo Samaj&quot; springs Brahmoism, the most recent of legally recognised religions in India and Bangladesh, reflecting its foundation on reformed spiritual Hinduism with vital elements of Judeo-Islamic faith and practice.

==Etymology==

The Brahmo Samaj literally denotes community () of men who have knowledge of Brahman, the ultimate reality. In reality Brahmo Samaj does not discriminate between caste, creed or religion and is an assembly of all sorts and descriptions of people without distinction, meeting publicly for the sober, orderly, religious and devout adoration of &quot;&quot;The Nameless, Eternal, Immutable Being who is the Author and Preserver of the Universe&quot;.&quot;

==Doctrine==

The following doctrines, as noted in Renaissance of Hinduism, are common to all varieties and offshoots of the &quot;Brahmo Samaj&quot;:
* Brahmo Samajists denied that any scripture could enjoy the status of ultimate authority transcending human reason and conscience.
* Brahmo Samajists have no faith in Avatars (incarnations)
* Brahmo Samajists denounce polytheism and idol-worship.
* Brahmo Samajists are against caste system.
* Brahmo Samajists took no definite stand on the doctrine of karma and transmigration of soul and left it to individual Brahmos to believe either way. 

==Divisions of Brahmo Samaj==
* Adi Brahmo Samaj
* Sadharan Brahmo Samaj

===Anusthanic versus Ananusthanic (Non-Anusthanic) Brahmos===
Anusthanic Brahmos comprise Adi Brahmos, Adi Dharmaites and many Sadharan Brahmos. Anusthanic Brahmos are exclusively adherents of the Brahmo religion and have no other faith.

The concept of the soul is anathema to Anusthanic Brahmos, which they consider to have been ruled out by the &quot;1861 Anusthan&quot; and they instead refer to the soul as &quot;being&quot;. Every &quot;being&quot;, which they consider immortal, is a part of God, who they see as the singularity, author and preserver of existence. &quot;Beings&quot; are sent out by God for a mission, &quot;Kriya&quot; on completion of which the &quot;being&quot; reintegrates (re-absorbs) into God.

For Anusthanic Brahmos the next step after death is this reintegration, re-absorption and renewal with God.

This corresponds to the 2nd &quot;Adi&quot; Prime Principle:
Being is created from Singularity. Being is renewed to Singularity. Being exists to be one again with Loving Singularity.

Ananusthanic (Non-Anusthanic Brahmos) believe in the concept of immortal souls eternally progressing towards God. This implies a karmic and fatalistic belief, which is different to Kriayic Brahmoism.

==History and timeline==
===Brahmo Sabha===
On 20 August 1828 the first assembly of the &quot;Brahmo Sabha&quot; was held at the North Calcutta house of Firingi Kamal Bose. This day was celebrated by Brahmos as &quot;Bhadrotsab&quot; (ভাদ্রোৎসব &quot;Bhadrotshôb&quot;; &quot;Bhadro celebration&quot;). These meetings were open to all people irrespective of religion, caste, creed, gender. The format of worship was defined by Raja Ram Mohan Roy - which included reading of the Vedas by two Telegu Brahmins, followed by an explanation of Vedanta and Upanishads in Bengali by Utsavananda Bidyabagish, followed by Brahmasangeet composed by Rammohun or his friends. The songs were performed by top classical musical exponents Krishnaprasad and Bishnu Chakraborty and percussion was played by the country&#x27;s top maestro Golam Abbas.

On 8 January 1830 influential progressive members of the closely related Kulin Brahmin clan scurrilously described as Pirali Brahmin (&quot;i.e.&quot; ostracised for service in the Mughal &quot;Nizaamat&quot; of Bengal) of Tagore (&quot;Thakur&quot;) and Roy &quot;Zameendar&quot; family, mutually executed the Trust Deed of Brahmo Sabha for the first Adi Brahmo Samaj (place of worship) on Chitpore Road (now Rabindra Sarani), Kolkata, India with Ram Chandra Vidyabagish as first resident superintendent.

On 23 January 1830 or 11th &quot;Magh&quot;, the &quot;Adi Brahmo&quot; premises were publicly inaugurated (with about 500 Brahmins and 1 Englishman present). This day is celebrated by Brahmos as &quot;Maghotsab&quot; (মাঘোৎসব &quot;Maghotshôb&quot; &quot;Magh celebration&quot;).

In November 1830 Rammohun Roy left for England. Akbar II had conferred the title of &#x27;Raja&#x27; to Rammohun Roy.

===Brief eclipse of Brahmo Sabha===
By the time of Rammohun&#x27;s death in 1833 near Bristol (UK), attendance at the &quot;Samaj&quot; dwindled. Dwarkanath Tagore provided the funds for the upkeep of the Samaj and Ram Chandra Vidyabagish kept up the flame burning, and arrived each week to perform the divine service as laid out by Rammohun.

===Tattwabodhini period===
On 6 October 1839, Debendranath Tagore, son of Dwarkanath Tagore, established &quot;Tattvaranjini Sabha&quot; which was shortly thereafter renamed the Tattwabodhini (&quot;Truth-seekers&quot;) Sabha. Initially confined to immediate members of the Tagore family, in two years it mustered over 500 members. In 1840, Debendranath published a Bangla translation of &quot;Katha Upanishad&quot;. A modern researcher describes the Sabha&#x27;s philosophy as &quot;modern middle-class (bourgeois) Vedanta.&quot;. Among its first members were the &quot;two giants of Hindu reformation and Bengal Renaissance&quot;, Akshay Kumar Datta, who in 1839 emerged from the life of an &quot;anonymous squalor-beset individual&quot;, and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, the &quot;indigenous modernizer&quot;.

===First Covenant and merger with the Tattwabodhini Sabha===
On 7th Pous 1765 Shaka (1843) Debendranath Tagore and twenty other Tattwabodhini stalwarts were formally invited by Pt. Vidyabagish into the Trust of Brahmo Sabha. The Pous Mela at Santiniketan starts on this day. From this day forth, the Tattwabodhini Sabha dedicated itself to promoting Ram Mohan Roy&#x27;s creed. The other Brahmins who swore the First Covenant of Brahmoism are:
* Shridhar Bhattacharya
* Shyamacharan Bhattacharya
* Brajendranath Tagore
* Girindranath Tagore, brother of Debendranath Tagore and father of Ganendranath Tagore
* Anandachandra Bhattacharya
* Taraknath Bhattacharya
* Haradev Chattopadhyaya, the future father-in-law to Mahacharya Hemendranath Tagore
* Shyamacharan Mukhopadhyaya
* Ramnarayan Chattopadhyaya
* Sashibhushan Mukhopadhyaya

===Foundation of the Brahmo Samaj===
In 1861 the Brahmo Samaj was founded at Lahore by Nobin Roy. It included many Bengalis from the Lahore Bar Association. Many branches were opened in the Punjab, at Quetta, Rawalpindi, Amritsar etc.

===First secession===
Disagreement with the Debendranath Tagore and Keshub Chandra Sen came to a head publicly between the period of 1 August 1865 till November 1866 and the followers of Keshub created the &quot;Brahmo Samaj of India&quot;. This period is also referred to in the histories of the secessionists as the &quot;First Schism&quot;.

===Brahmo Samaj and Swami Narendranath Vivekananda===

Swami Vivekananda was influenced by the Brahmo Samaj of India, and visited the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his youth.

===Current status and number of adherents===
While the various Calcutta sponsored movements declined after 1920 and faded into obscurity after the Partition of India, the Adi Dharm creed has expanded and is now the 9th largest of India&#x27;s enumerated religions with 7.83 million adherents, heavily concentrated between the states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. In the Indian census of 2001 only 177 persons declared themselves a &quot;Brahmo&quot;, but the number of subscriber members to Brahmo Samaj is somewhat larger at around 20,000 members.

== Social and religious reform ==
In matters of social reform the Brahmo Samaj attacked many dogmas and superstitions. It condemned the prevailing Hindu prejudice against sailing across sea and going abroad (Kala Pani). The Samaj condemned practice of Sati (burning of widows), discouraged child marriage and polygamy, and crusaded for widow remarriage. The Samaj attacked casteism and untouchability.

After the controversy of underage marriage of Keshub Chunder Sen&#x27;s daughter, the &quot;Special Marriages Act of 1872&quot; was enacted to set the minimum age of 14 years for marriage of girls. All Brahmo marriages were thereafter solemnised under this law. Many Indians resented the requirement of the affirmation &quot;I am not Hindu, nor a Mussalman, nor a Christian&quot; for solemnising a marriage under this Act. The requirement of this declaration was imposed by Henry James Sumner Maine, legal member of Governor General&#x27;s Council appointed by Britain. The 1872 Act was repealed by the Special Marriage Act, 1954 under which any person of any religion could marry. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 applies to all Hindus (including &quot;followers&quot; of the Brahmo Samaj) but not to the adherents of the Brahmo religion.

===Second secession===
Differences arose between Keshub Chandra Sen and the band of young people who called themselves &quot;Samadarshi&quot;. The difference arose due to the autocratic handling of the works of the Brahmo Samaj by Keshub Chandra Sen. The differences came to a head with the Coochbehar marriage. A meeting was called in Town Hall of Calutta on 15 May 1878 and the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj came into existence with Anandamohan Bose as president, Shib Chandra Deb, Sivanath Sastri, Umesh Chandra Dutta, Gurucharan Mahalanobish serving as office bearers.

<doc id="882193" wikidata="Q1229005" url="?curid=882193" title="BMW 5 Series (E39)">
<text>The BMW E39 is the fourth generation of the BMW 5 Series range of executive cars, which was manufactured from 1995 to 2004. It was launched in the saloon body style, with the station wagon body style (marketed as &quot;Touring&quot;) introduced in 1996. The E39 was replaced by the E60 5 Series in 2003, however E39 Touring models remained in production until May 2004.

The proportion of chassis components using aluminium significantly increased for the E39, and it was the first 5 Series to use aluminium for all major components in the front suspension or any in the rear. It was also the first 5 Series where a four-cylinder diesel engine was available. Rack and pinion steering was used for four- and six-cylinder models, the first time that a 5 Series has used this steering system in significant volumes. Unlike its E34 predecessor and E60 successor, the E39 was not available with all-wheel drive.

The high performance E39 M5 saloon was introduced in 1998, powered by a DOHC V8 engine. It was the first M5 model to be powered by a V8 engine.

== Development and launch ==

Development for the E34&#x27;s successor began in 1993, and ended in 1995. The final design by Joji Nagashima was selected in June 1992 and later frozen for production under new design chief Chris Bangle. With design selection in 1992, the series development phase began and took 39 months until start of production. The domestic German design patent was filed on 20 April 1994, with an E39 prototype.

Pre-production cars rolled off the pilot line from February 1995 starting with 523i and 528i models. This was followed by the 520i in March 1995, 525td/tds and 540i in April 1995 and 535i in October 1995. In May 1995 BMW published the first official photos of the E39. The E39 premiered in September 1995 at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Dealer demonstrator cars became available from September 1995 in continental Europe, commencing full scale production. In December 1995 sales of saloon models began on the European mainland. Production of wagon/estate models began in November 1996.
== Body styles ==

== Equipment ==
The E39 was one of the first vehicles (alongside the E38 7 Series) to have curtain airbags, which protect the occupants&#x27; heads in a side impact. Standard equipment on the launch models included dual front and side airbags, pretensioners and load limiters for the front seatbelts, anti-lock brakes, traction control, power steering, and air conditioning. Satellite navigation was also available, initially using maps on CD-ROMs, then moving to DVD maps in 2002. Several models were available in &quot;Sports&quot; or &quot;Executive&quot; trim levels.

Special options available options on wagon models were either a roller blind or extending boot cover with patrician net for the rear boot area, roller sun visors for rear and side windows.

A &quot;latent heat accumulator&quot; was available as an option up until September 1999. The accumulator stores engine heat by converting a salt from solid to liquid form (phase transition). The insulated tank can store heat for several days. The next time the vehicle is started, this heat is automatically used to reduce exhaust emissions (by heating the engine up to operating temperature quicker), for cabin heating and window defrosting.

Separate to the latent heat accumulator is the Residual Heat function (activated by a button labelled &quot;REST&quot;), which allows the demister and cabin heater to use the heat of an engine that has recently been turned off (using an electric pump to push hot coolant through the heater core).
== Engines ==
=== Petrol engines ===

At launch, the petrol engines consisted of the BMW M52 straight-6 engines and the BMW M62 V8 engines. In late 1998, the &quot;technical update&quot; (TÜ) versions of these engines were introduced, introducing double VANOS to the M52 and single VANOS to the M62, primarily to increase torque at low rpm.

For the facelift of the model range in the year 2000, the M52 was replaced by the BMW M54 straight-6 engine and the version used in the 530i model topped the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list in 2002 and 2003. The post-facelift V8 models (535i and 540i) continued to use the M62TÜ engine.

Specifications for European models are shown below.,

=== Diesel engines ===
The initial diesel models used the BMW M51 turbocharged straight-6 engine carried over from its predecessor. In 1998, its successor the BMW M57 was introduced in the 530d model, however the BMW M51 engine continued to be used for two more years in the 525td and 525tds models.

In 1999, the M47 four-cylinder turbo-diesel was introduced in the 520d model, which is the only E39 model to use a four-cylinder engine.

Specifications for European models are shown below.,

== Drivetrain ==
=== Manual transmissions ===
Six-cylinder petrol models and 535i were fitted with either the 5-speed &quot;Getrag 250G&quot; or ZF 320Z (S5-32) transmission, depending on the year and model. Diesel models with the M51 engine were fitted with the 5-speed &quot;ZF 260Z&quot; transmission, while the M57 diesel models were fitted with the 5-speed ZF 390 (S5-39DZ) transmission. 540i and M5 were fitted with the 6-speed Getrag 420G transmission.

=== Automatic transmissions ===
Some pre-facelift six-cylinder petrol models were fitted with the 4-speed GM 4L30-E (A4S270R) transmission. Six-cylinder pre-facelift cars built for the Japanese market were fitted with the Jatco 5R01 5 speed automatic transmission. All other six-cylinder models were fitted with 5-speed transmissions, either the GM 5L40-E (A5S360R), GM 5L40-E (A5S390R), or ZF 5HP19 (A5S325Z) transmission, depending on the year and model. V8 petrol models were fitted with either the 5-speed ZF 5HP24 (A5S440Z) or the 5-speed ZF 5HP30 (A5S560Z).

=== Differential ratios ===
The following differential ratios were used by the E39:
* 2.35: 530d manual
* 2.64: 525d manual
* 2.81: 540i manual, 530d automatic
* 2.93: 528i/530i manual
* 3.07: 528iT/530iT/525tds manual
* 3.15: 525i/525tds automatic, 540i automatic
* 3.15 (LSD): M5
* 3.23: 525iT manual
* 3.38/3.46: 525i Auto 
* 3.46: 528i/530i (5-speed) automatic
* 4.10: 528i (4-speed) automatic

== Steering ==
Unusually, two different steering systems were used for the E39, depending on the engine. Models with four-cylinder and six-cylinder models use rack and pinion steering, the first time this system has been used in a 5 Series (except for the E34 525iX model). This system steers from the front of the axle.

Models with V8 engines use recirculating ball steering, as per the previous generations of 5 Series.

== Chassis and body ==
Compared with its E34 predecessor, the E39&#x27;s wheelbase grew by and overall length by . Torsional rigidity was increased over the E34 by 40 percent, which reduces body flex and allows the suspension to operate more accurately, also improving ride quality. Structural dynamics were also an objective of the body design, so the body&#x27;s frequencies for torsional twisting and bending are in separate ranges and above the natural frequency of the body. These frequencies are out of the range of engine and driveline vibrations, to avoid vibrations being amplified.

Due to a stiffer body shell, the weight of the chassis increased by , which is offset by the reduced weight of some aluminium suspension components. The wagon version was longer than the previous generation (E34) and weighed approximately more.

== Suspension ==
The E39 was the first 5 Series to use aluminium for most components in the front suspension. The proportion of chassis components using aluminium significantly increased for the E39.

The front suspension consists of a double-jointed version of the MacPherson strut, with six-cylinder cars using an aluminium front subframe. Aluminium is used for the steering knuckles, outer strut tube and the spring pads, resulting in a weight saving of . V8 models also use aluminium in the steering box and several suspension links, to compensate for the heavier steel subframe.

The rear suspension consists of a four link design (called &quot;Z-link&quot;), which is similar to the system used by the E38 7 Series. The design minimises unintentional toe angle changes, which increases the stability of the handling.

=== Wagon self-levelling suspension ===
The Touring model was the first BMW model to use air suspension (self-levelling suspension was first used by BMW for the E23 7 Series with a closed-loop nitrogen system that operated in parallel with the steel springs). This &quot;self leveling&quot; system controls the ride height of the rear of the vehicle and is designed to keep the centre of the wheel a specified distance from the lip of the fender as the weight of the load in the boot area varies.

Instead of using a traditional coil springs, the system uses pneumatic springs paired with air reservoirs that are pressurised by an air compressor. The system is controlled by two Hall effect sensors at the rear of the vehicle. These sensors tell the EHC (electric height control) if the rear ride height needs to be adjusted and adjust headlight height for vehicles equipped with Xenon headlights. When a door or the rear hatch is opened and then closed the control module will constantly monitor the input signals from the HALL sensors and will activate a correction if the ride height has change greater than 10mm. During normal operation the system stays online but does not adjust to conditions such as potholes.

== M5 model ==


The M5 model of the E39 was introduced in 1998 at the Geneva Motor Show and was produced from 1998 to 2003. It was powered by the S62 V8 engine producing 394 horsepower. All E39 M5 cars that were made were sold in the saloon body style with a 6-speed manual transmission. A single M5 Touring model was made, but was never sold or put into production.
== Alpina E39 models ==


The Alpina B10 3.2, 3.3, V8 and V8S petrol-engined models were built in saloons and wagon body styles based on the E39 from January 1997 to May 2004.

The B10 V8 S was available to buy in a 5 speed automatic.

The Alpina D10 Biturbo was the first diesel car produced by Alpina and was based on an E39 530d. The D10 was in production from April 2000 to October 2003. It was first shown to the public in 1999 at the Geneva Motor show The engine was a 6 cylinder diesel producing 500 nm of torque to the rear driving wheels. 0–60 miles per hour in 7.2 seconds and a top speed of 157 miles per hour. The D10 Biturbo was available to buy in a Getrag 6 speed manual or a ZF 5 speed automatic and only 94 were ever made.

The Alpina D10 was the first diesel model produced by Alpina and was introduced in February 2000. The engine, a 3.0 litre twin-turbocharged unit rated at and of torque, was based on the engine of the 530d model.

== Special protection line model ==
The 540i Protection light-armored vehicle was launched in Europe in September 1997 and in North America from January 1998. These models included aramid fibre armor, bullet-resistant glass that is coated with polycarbonate to reduce spall. The 540i Protection is rated to withstand the impact of handgun fire up to and including .44 Magnum, the glass is also protected from attack with blunt objects such as baseball bats and bricks. The additional security measures brought an additional weight of compared to the normal 540i saloon. on request, an intercom system was available and from January 1998 run-flat wheels were available.

== Model year changes ==

In Indonesia, the initial model range in 1996 was the 523i and 528i, with only the 523i available with a manual transmission. Following the September 2000 facelift, the line-up consisted of 520i, 525i and 530i. Indonesian models were assembled in Jakarta from complete knock-down kits.

=== United States ===
From 1997 to 1998, the E39 model range in North America consisted of the 528i and 540i, In 1999 the M5 was introduced along with station wagon (marketed as &quot;sports wagon&quot;) versions of the 528i and 540i. For the 2001 model year, the 528i was discontinued and replaced by the 525i (525i Touring in estate/wagon format) and 530i (with no wagon variant in the US).

In 2001, the American market 540i&#x27;s power output was increased to , unlike other markets where the 540i&#x27;s power remained at . All North American models from factory arrived pre-wired for mobile phones; it was a dealer option to have a mobile phone installed into the centre console. The station wagon models were marketed as &quot;Sports Wagon&quot; and standard features included roof rails for mounting a roof rack.

In 2003 BMW sold the 540i M-Sport package as a limited production model in the United States, with 1,190 cars produced with a manual transmission. Upgrades included 18-inch wheels and various cosmetic features.

Sales in the United States for May 1999 to May 2000 were 19,294 vehicles. The following year, sales for May 2000 to May 2001 were 15,233 vehicles.

==Motorsport==
The M5 was used by several teams in the Italian Superstars Series.

== Awards ==
&quot;Car and Driver&quot; featured the E39 in its &quot;10Best list&quot; six consecutive times, from 1997 to 2002. In 2001, Consumer Reports gave the 530i its highest car rating ever, declaring it the best car they had ever reviewed to date.

Other reviewers have also praised the E39 models.

==Safety==
The series tested for IIHS&#x27;s &quot;moderate overlap front&quot; test and received &#x27;Good&#x27; rating results, the highest available.

== Production ==
The first pilot production models were built in February 1995, with full-scale production starting in September that year. Most cars were built at the Dingolfing factory, with complete knock-down assembly used in Mexico, Indonesia and Russia. CKD production amounted to 17,280, with total production numbering 1,488,038 of which 266,209 units were Touring models.

<text>The fifth generation of the BMW 5 Series executive cars consists of the BMW E60 (saloon version) and BMW E61 (wagon version, marketed as &#x27;Touring&#x27;). The E60/E61 generation was produced by BMW from 2003 to 2010 and is often collectively referred to as the E60.

The E60 generation introduced various new electronic features, including the iDrive infotainment system, head-up display, active cruise control, active steering, adaptive headlights, night vision, lane departure warning and voice control. The E60 was the first 5 Series to be available with a turbocharged petrol engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission and regenerative braking.

The M5 model was introduced in 2005 and is powered by the BMW S85 V10 engine. It was sold in the saloon and wagon body styles, with most cars using the 7-speed SMG III transmission. It was the first and only M5 model to be sold with a V10 engine.

In January 2010, the BMW 5 Series (F10) began production as the successor to the E60.

== Development and launch==

The development programme for the E60 began in 1997, concluding in 2002. The lead designer was Boyke Boyer. The final design, developed by Davide Arcangeli under BMW Design Director Chris Bangle, was approved in 2000 and German design patents filed on 16 April 2002.

The saloon was launched on 5 July 2003 in Europe and in October 2003 in North America. In late 2004, the Touring models were introduced.

== Body styles ==
The body of the E60 was made using aluminium for the front of the car, and steel for the passenger cabin and rear. Kerb weights are for the saloon and for the wagon. The weight distribution of the saloon models was 50:50.

== Interior / Equipment ==

The iDrive infotainment system— first introduced in the E65 7 Series— was fitted to all E60 models. The standard iDrive system included a 6.5-inch LCD screen, a single-disc CD/MP3 player, Bluetooth for phone calls (available only on later-build 2004 models, and standard on all 2005 and newer models), basic voice control, and vehicle settings. Optional features included an 8-inch LCD screen, GPS navigation, Sirius Satellite Radio (on North American-spec models), and DVD video playback. iPod and USB integration, HD Radio (on North American-spec models), an auxiliary audio input jack (standard on 2008 and newer models), full voice control, and a multi-disc CD/MP3/DVD changer (mounted in the glove compartment). On North American-spec models, a ten-speaker premium audio system with dual under-seat subwoofers and an amplifier was standard equipment, with a thirteen-speaker Harman Kardon &quot;Logic 7&quot; premium surround sound audio system available as an option on all models.

An emergency hotline feature (BMW Assist) was also available for the E60. The BMW Assist system could also use the phone network to notify the driver and their preferred BMW dealership when servicing was due. This feature was standard on all E60 models sold in the United States.

Other features available in the E60 initially included active cruise control, Bi-Xenon headlights, run-flat tyres, active anti-roll bars, head-up display and active steering. Safety-related items include Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), adaptive headlights and night vision.

In 2009, the iDrive system was upgraded from the first-generation &quot;CCC&quot; interface to the newer &quot;CIC&quot; interface. The audio system control panel added six multifunction preset buttons that could be programmed to store favorite radio stations and frequently-dialed telephone numbers for the Bluetooth hands-free system. The iDrive controller in the centre console was also redesigned, and now integrated shortcut keys for frequently-used functions.

Over the E60&#x27;s lifespan, the following features were added: Active Cruise Control with Stop &amp; Go, keyless entry (&quot;comfort access&quot;), LED taillights, Lane Departure Warning and Brake Force Display.

The E60 was the first 5 Series in 22 years where the centre console was not angled towards the driver, however the E60&#x27;s successor returned to angling the centre console towards the driver.

In 2003 a 6-speed SMG-II gearbox was offered as an option on the 525i, 530i, 545i and 550i in some markets.
== Engines ==
=== Petrol ===
At launch, the E60 used the previous generation E39 5 Series&#x27; M54 straight 6 engine in the 520i, 525i and 530i models. The only petrol model with a new engine at launch was the 545i with the N62 V8. The M54 was phased out after the 2005 model years and replaced with the straight-4 N43 (in the 520i) and the straight-6 N52 engine (in the 525i and 530i). The model range was also expanded the same year to include a wider range of models like the 523i, 540i and 550i. In 2007, the only turbocharged petrol E60 model was introduced, the 535i with the twin-turbo straight-6 N54 engine. This model was exclusive to the North American market and was not sold in Europe.


=== Diesel ===
The only diesel model available at launch was the 530d, which used an updated &quot;TÜ&quot; version of the M57 engine found in the previous generation E39 5 Series. In 2004 the 535d and 525d were added to the model range which also used different versions of the M57 straight-6 turbo engine. In 2005, the only 4-cylinder diesel model E60 was added to the model range, the 520d using the older M47 engine at first; from 2007 the new N47 engine replaced it. Most of the diesel model range was exclusive to the European market, except a few models which were sold in some Asian markets. No diesel models were offered in North America. 
== Transmissions ==
Available transmissions are:
* 6-speed ZF S6-37 manual (2004–2010)
* 6-speed Getrag 217—GS6-17BG / GS6-17DG manual (2004–2010)
* 6-speed ZF S6-53 manual (2004–2010)
* 6-speed ZF 6HP19 automatic (2003–2010) in 525d models
* 6-speed ZF 6HP26 automatic (2003–2007)
* 6-speed ZF 6HP26X automatic (2003–2007) - xdrive 4wd models
* 6-speed ZF 6HP28 automatic (2007–2010)
* 6-speed ZF 6HP28X automatic (2007–2010) - xdrive 4wd models
* 6-speed GS6S37BZ SMG-II (2003–2010)
* 6-speed GS6S53BZ SMG-II (2003–2010)
* 7-speed GS7S47BG SMG III (M5 model)

== M5 model ==
The M5 model of the E60 generation was introduced in 2005 and produced in saloon and wagon body styles. The E60 M5 is powered by the BMW S85 V10 engine, which produces at 7,750 rpm, at 6,100 rpm and has a redline of 8,250 rpm. The acceleration time is 4.7 seconds.

The majority of M5s were sold with a 7-speed automated manual transmission (&quot;SMG III&quot;), however a 6-speed manual was also available in some markets.

Total production of the M5 was 20,548 units, consisting of 19,523 saloons and 1,025 wagons.

== Special models ==
=== Alpina B5 ===

Introduced in February 2005, the &quot;Alpina B5&quot; and &quot;Alpina B5 S&quot; were built in saloon and wagon body styles and powered by the BMW N62 petrol V8 engine (as used by the 545i) with the addition of a centrifugal supercharger. The rated power outputs are for the B5 and for the B5 S. Both models used the ZF 6HP26 6-speed hydraulic automatic transmission shared with the regular E60 models.

=== BMW 5 Series Security ===
The E60 was available as &#x27;Security&#x27; models, a factory armoured version which was unveiled at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show. Built with ballistic steel, aramid, polyethylene and 21mm polycarbonate layered glass it was certified at VR4 level of VPAM&#x27;s Bullet Resistant Vehicle guidelines (1999). The armoured areas include the entire passenger cell, battery terminals and Engine Control Unit. As standard they included an intercom system and panic alarm.

The Security models were built using the mechanicals of the 530i or the 550i, with upgraded suspension and braking systems. Production of the Security models began alongside the series model at BMW&#x27;s Dingolfing plant, with armouring prepared before being shipped to a specialist facility in Toluca, Mexico, where the vehicles complete the final assembly stage.

=== Long-wheelbase saloon (China only) ===
A long-wheelbase (LWB) version of the E60 5 Series was offered in China. Models included the 520Li, 523Li, 525Li, and 530Li. The wheelbase was increased to from the original wheelbase of , a increase.

=== BMW 5 Series Authority Vehicle ===
The 5 Series Authority Vehicle is designed for police forces, fire services, and emergency rescue services. It has a firearm bracket in the rear centre armrest.

== Safety ==
Initially the 5 Series received a three-star rating for adult occupants. However changes were made to the steering column, footrest, door trims, door latch, airbags and electronic software and the car was retested achieving its four-star rating. BMW claims the modifications improved the car&#x27;s Euro NCAP score, not the vehicle&#x27;s safety; consequently BMW chose not to recall the earlier-built cars.

The American Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gives the 5 Series a &quot;Good&quot; overall rating in frontal collisions but a &quot;Marginal&quot; overall rating for side impact collisions. The IIHS reported their side impact test would likely cause driver related rib fractures and/or internal organ injuries. The IIHS tests were conducted on models built after May 2007; these models had modifications to improve side impact safety.

== 2007 facelift ==

The &#x27;Life Cycle impulse&#x27; (LCI) models were introduced in March 2007 (for the 2008 model year). Styling changes were relatively subtle, and included revised headlights, tail lights and front bumper. The interior was significantly revised. The iDrive system was upgraded with programmable &quot;favourite&quot; shortcut buttons (for 2009 models), a revised menu system, preset buttons for the audio system and the switch from DVD to hard disk based storage (for 2010 models).

Mechanically, the 5 Series gained the new engines and transmissions from the E70 X5. On automatic transmission models, a shift by wire shifter replaced the mechanical version and shift paddles were available for the first time on a 5 Series model besides the M5.

The active cruise control was upgraded to bring the vehicle to a complete stop and accelerate from stationary (called &quot;Stop &amp; Go&quot;). Other changes include adaptive headlights, LED rear lights, Lane Departure Warning, night vision and Brake Force Display. The E60 LCI was the first BMW to feature regenerative braking.


== Production ==
Production of the E60/E61 occurred at the BMW Group Plant Dingolfing in Germany and at the BMW Brilliance plant in China.

Complete knock-down assembly of German-produced kits took place in Thailand, Egypt, Russia and Malaysia.

<doc id="882196" wikidata="Q796462" url="?curid=882196" title="BMW 6 Series (E63)">
<text>The second generation of the [[BMW 6 Series]] consists of the BMW E63 (coupe version) and BMW E64 (convertible version) grand tourers. The E63/E64 generation was produced by BMW from 2003 to 2010 and is often collectively referred to as the E63.

The E63 uses a shortened version of the E60 5 Series chassis and subsequently shares many features. The car initially drew criticism, due to its controversial styling and complicated iDrive system.

The M6 model was introduced in 2005 in coupé and convertible body styles. It is powered by the S85 V10 engine shared with the E60 M5, and most M6s were produced with a 7-speed automated manual transmission (&quot;SMG III&quot;).

In March 2011, the BMW 6 Series (F06/F12/F13) began production as the successor to the E63.

== Development and launch ==
The exterior was designed by Adrian van Hooydonk, based on the 1999 BMW Z9 concept car designed by the then BMW Design Chief Chris Bangle.

The controversial rear styling, first seen on the E65 7 Series, was nicknamed &quot;Bangle Butt&quot; by critics. BMW described the styling philosophy as &quot;flame surfacing&quot;, where concave and convex shapes meet to create sharp edges.

To reduce weight, the doors and bonnet are made of aluminium, and the boot and front wings are made of carbon-reinforced plastic. The kerb weight is .

== Body styles ==
=== Coupé (E63) ===
Coupé models were unveiled at the 2003 Frankfurt Auto Show, and introduced on the market in middle of the 2003 model year.

=== Convertible (E64) ===
Convertible models were unveiled at the 2004 Detroit Auto Show, and released in mid 2004.

Convertible models featured a non-conventional convertible top design with side fins and an integrated wind deflector that can be raised or lowered at any time.
== Engines ==
Top speed for all models is electronically limited to .

=== Petrol ===
=== Diesel ===
== Drivetrain ==
The available transmissions are:
* 6-speed ZF S6-37 manual (630Ci / 630i)
* 6-speed ZF S6-53 manual (645Ci / 650i / M6 (U.S. only)
* 6-speed ZF 6HP19 automatic (630Ci / 630i)
* 6-speed ZF 6HP26 automatic (635d / 645Ci / 650i)
* 6-speed ZF 6HP28 automatic (635d LCI / 650i LCI)
* 6-speed SMG (630i / 645Ci / 650i)
* 7-speed SMG III (M6)
Unlike the related E60 5 Series, the E63/E64 was not available with all-wheel drive (xDrive).

== Equipment ==
Features available included adaptive headlights, parking sensors (Park Distance Control), voice control, variable rate steering (Active Steering), active anti-roll bars (Active Roll Stabilisation), radar cruise control (Active Cruise Control with Stop and Go), head-up display, lane departure warning, night vision, keyless entry and starting (Comfort Access), heated steering wheel, universal remote control, and soft-close doors.
== M6 model ==

The M6 version was initially introduced as a coupé at the 2005 Geneva International Motor Show, and later in convertible form at the British International Motor Show in 2006.

The M6 is powered by the 5.0-litre naturally aspirated S85 V10 shared with the E60 M5, generating at 7,750 rpm and at 6,100 rpm. The majority of the cars were produced with a 7-speed automated manual transmission (&quot;SMG III&quot;), however a 6-speed manual transmission was also available in the United States.

The M6 coupé has a carbon fibre roof in order to reduce weight and for a lower centre of gravity. Additional features included: sports seats, larger front and rear brakes, an M-performance instrument cluster, a carbon-fibre roof (coupé only), and an optional M head-up Display. The car also has quad exhaust-pipes and larger, more aerodynamic air intakes.

A total of 9,087 coupés and 5,065 convertibles were built; amounting to 14,152 cars.

== Yearly changes ==

=== 2006 ===
* 650i model replaces the 645Ci
* M6 model introduced

=== 2007 facelift ===
In September 2007, the facelift (LCI) was introduced for the 2008 model year. Major changes include:
* 635d model introduced, powered by the M57 diesel engine.
* 630i engine upgraded from the N52 to the N53 in countries with low sulphur fuel.
* Exterior design changes including headlights, tail-lights, bumpers, and the third brake light on coupé models was relocated to the trunk lid.
* Interior design changes including updated climate controls, and new electronic gear lever with the ability to change gears manually via steering wheel paddles.
* Edition Sport trim introduced featuring a stiffer anti-roll system and an updated exhaust system for 650i models.

=== 2009 ===
* iDrive upgraded to CIC version (previously CCC)

== Safety ==
Models feature BMW&#x27;s Advanced Safety System, enabling the car to decide the most effective deployment of the airbags in a crash. Safety equipment includes active anti-roll bars, dynamic stability control, front knee airbags (in accordance with US regulation), BMW roadside assistance, and an SOS emergency system. Convertible models also feature an automatic rollover protection system, where roll-bars behind the rear seats are automatically deployed in a rollover. From 2008, active head restraints became a standard feature on all seat options, reducing the risk of neck injuries in a rear-end collision.

== Production volumes ==
The E63/E64 was produced at the Dingolfing BMW plant.

The following are production figures for the E63/E64, excluding M6 models:

<doc id="882199" wikidata="Q796453" url="?curid=882199" title="BMW 7 Series (E32)">
<text>The BMW E32 is the second generation of the BMW 7 Series luxury cars and was produced from 1986 until 1994. It replaced the E23 and was initially available with straight-six or V12 powerplants. In 1992, V8 engines became available. From its inception, the E32 was among the most technologically advanced cars in its day.

The E32 introduced numerous features including adaptive suspension (EDC), traction control, two available wheelbases (i and iL), and dual-zone climate control. The E32 750i was the first car adhering to &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot; amongst the German manufacturers limiting maximum speed to .

Other automotive passenger vehicles features introduced with the E32 included: projector lens headlamps (1986); double glazing windows (1991); HID (Xenon) headlamps (1991).

E32 also introduced BMW&#x27;s first V8 engine since the BMW 501/502, last produced in 1962, and their first V12 engine, which was also the first German car to have a V12 engine since the 1939 Maybach Zeppelin DS8.

In 1994, the E32 was replaced by the E38, a clear evolution of the E32.

== Development and production ==
Styling was by chief stylist Ercole Spada and Hans Kerschbaum working under chief designer Claus Luthe. Design work began in late 1979. By 1983, 1:1 scale models were presented and frozen in October 1984 for production which was scheduled in June 1986. In a later interview with then BMW chief engineer Wolfgang Reitzle, it was revealed that a last minute decision was taken to widen the car by 40mm in order to improve its stance, and to develop a V12 engine, which would give the new 7-series a competitive advantage over the Mercedes S-Class. Reitzle persuaded BMW management, despite the fact that press tooling for the bodyshell had already been manufactured, and scrapping it would cost an estimated 300 million Deutsche Mark, and would push out the car&#x27;s release date by a year. 

Production of the E32 7 series started with the 735i in June 1986 and the 730i in December 1986, concluding in April 1994 with a total of 311,068 units built.

== Features ==

Some luxury options featured on the E32 include integrated telephone and fax machines, a wine cooler, electronically adjustable rear seats and radio controls for rear passengers (exclusive to the 750iL).

In 1991, first series-production low beam Xenon high-intensity discharge headlamps (Litronic, only low beam) were introduced on the 750iL. Other safety features include a system that automatically increased spring pressure on the windscreen wipers to keep them firmly pressed on the glass at Motorway speeds.

The E32 was the first BMW available with traction control (marketed as Automatic Stability Control, though not considered stability control by more modern standards). Initial versions of ASC reduced wheelspin by reducing engine power, while later versions (ASC+T) also applied the rear brakes.

The E32 was also available in a long-wheelbase version (indicated by an &#x27;L&#x27; from German &quot;Lang&quot;, after the model number) with an extra of rear leg room..

== Engines ==

Over its lifespan, the E32 7 Series was produced with straight-six, V8 and V12 gasoline engines.

The launch models consisted of the 730i/iL and 735i/iL, which were powered by the M30 straight-six engine. Also available at the E32 launch was the 750i/iL. The rated power output of the M70 V12 is .

In 1991, BMW began production of its first V8 engine since the end of BMW 501/502 production in 1962. This M60 V8 was introduced in the E32, along with the E34 5 Series. The 4.0 litre version powered the new 740i/iL models, and the 3.0 litre version was sold in parallel with the M30 straight-six in the 730i/iL models. The top speed of the 740i was electronically limited to . Both V8 engines were coupled to a new, 5-speed automatic transmission made by ZF. The Nikasil bore lining used in the M60 engine was prone to damage when used with high-sulfur fuels.

== Styling ==
The E32 was the first BMW to use L-shaped tail-lights, which were designed with safety of following traffic in mind. Other styling features include a Hofmeister kink in the rear window line and circular headlights.

A narrow &#x27;kidney&#x27; grille correlated with 6-cylinder models, and a wider grille was standard for V8 and V12 models. The narrow grille was not available as an option on the 8- and 12-cylinder E32 models.

== Models ==
The official specifications are as follows.
* uncatalyzed 
** Electronically limited top speed

== Alpina models ==

The &quot;Alpina B11 3.5&quot; is based on the E32 735i and introduced in 1987 with a inline-six engine. Between 1987 and 1993 a total of 332 cars were produced.

The &quot;Alpina B11 4.0&quot; is based on the E32 740i with a modified engine producing (compared with for the 740i) and of torque. Just 7 cars were made in 1993 and 1994.

The &quot;Alpina B12 5.0&quot; is based on the E32 750i/750iL and used a modified V12 engine producing (compared with for the 750i/750iL) and of torque. A total of 305 cars were made.

== Special models ==

===750iL Highline===

The BMW 750iL &quot;Highline&quot; was the top-of-the-line model of the E32, with lots of added luxury for the rear passengers like full leather seats, dual radio controls, dual climate control with coolbox mounted in the center console, electrically heated and adjustable rear seats, walnut veneer folding tables, two crystal glasses neatly placed in the coolbox, leg rests, and electronically operated sun shades all around the rear/side windows. Complete with independent heating and ventilation, it also added a second battery in the trunk and a second alternator to provide power for all these luxuries. The &#x27;Highline&#x27; option package cost more than 20,000 DM, and was only available on the 750iL, bringing the total price to well over twice that of a base model 730i.

===Goldfisch prototype===

The Goldfisch, also called the 767 or the &quot;Secret Seven&quot; internally, is a concept full size luxury car based on the E32 750i. Conceived by Dr. Karlheinz Lange in the late 1980s, it was meant to be the top-of-the line variant of the 7 Series also designed to compete with offerings from rival Mercedes-Benz. Dr. Lange also involved two other employees in the project, namely Adolf Fischer and Hanns-Peter Weisbarth both being senior employees. The concept car was completed in just six months. The main notable feature is the V16 engine designed by Adolf Fischer, which is essentially a modified M70 V12 enlarged to have four extra cylinders, capacity enlarged to 6.7-litres, etched iron pistons, nine-bearing crankshaft and having silicone-aluminium casting. The engine was fitted with Bosch DME 3.3 engine management system for better performance. Desired level of performance was achieved when the system treated the engine as two inline-8 engines bolted together. The resulting engine had a power output of and of torque. Power was sent to the rear wheels via a 6-speed manual transmission shared with the E31 8 Series. The car had the engine cooling system located in the boot along with fabricated fibre glass gills and air scoops at the rear to aid in cooling as there was no space to accommodate them at the front as the resulting engine was longer than the V12 engine. Air was expelled through a custom made valence panel at the rear of the car which led to the use of small tail lights with no fog and reverse lights. Despite the usage of a large V16 engine, the car was only heavier than the 750i. The Goldfisch could accelerate to in a claimed 6 seconds and could attain a top speed of . The car remained a technology demonstrator only and was never put into production due to the V16 engine being incompliant to the environmental regulations.

==Related cars==
The E34 5 Series, introduced in 1988, has exterior design almost identical to the E32. It also uses the same M30 straight-6 and M60 V8 engines, and several other parts.

The E31 8 Series, introduced in 1989, uses the same M60 V8 and M70 V12 engines as the E32.

<text>The BMW E38 is the third generation of the BMW 7 Series luxury cars and was produced from 1994 until 2001. The E38 replaced the E32 7 Series and was produced with petrol and turbo-diesel straight-six and V8 engines, along with a petrol V12 flagship model. Three wheelbase lengths were available — short (i), long (iL) and Limousine (L7). 

The E38 was the first car available with curtain airbags. It was also the first European car to offer satellite navigation and the first BMW to offer an in-built television. The E38 was the first 7 Series to be available with a diesel engine and the last to be available with a manual transmission.

In 2001, the E38 was succeeded by the E65 7 Series.

==Development==
In early 1988, development began on the third generation of the 7 Series. From 1988 to 1990 styling work was done initially under design director Claus Luthe (through April 1990, taken over by Dr. Wolfgang Reitzle), when Boyke Boyer&#x27;s concept design was chosen and further refined into production form.

In February 1991, the final production design for the new 7 Series was approved by the board 36 months ahead of the scheduled start of production for 17 February 1994. On 27 April 1993, German design patents were filed featuring a pre-production prototype as a design representation. Patents were later filed on 27 October 1993 in the United States.

==Production==
Production started on 23 July 1993 for pilot production models; US specification variants entered pre-series production on 13 January 1994. Series production of the 730i and 740i commenced in April 1994 for the June 1994 domestic German launch. US-specification cars entered production in September 1994, for their November 1994 launch. On 18 February 1994, the E38 BMW 7 Series was unveiled for the 1995 model year via a BMW press release. 750i production began in November 1994, in advance of its January 1995 launch.

The production totals by model are: 728i- 38,000; 728iL- 7,000; 730i- 21,000; 730iL- 2,000; 735i- 21,000; 735iL- 5,000; 740i- 88,000; 740iL- 81,000; 750i- 8,000; 750iL- 15,000; 725tds- 9,000; 730d- 12,000, 740d- 3,000 and less than 500 each for the 740iL P, 750iL P, 750iL S and L7 models.

A total of 340,242 cars were produced. The last E38 rolled off BMW&#x27;s assembly line on 27 July 2001 to make way for the replacement E65 7 Series.

==Engines==
===Petrol engines===

===Diesel engines===
==Transmissions==
A 5-speed ZF 5HP automatic transmission was available on all models. In many markets, a 5-speed manual transmission was available for the 725tds, 728i, 730i, and 735i, while a 6-speed manual was on offer for the 740i.

==Equipment==
Safety features include ASC+T traction control, Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), headlight washers and auto-leveling low beam xenon HID headlamps. Side tubular airbags (called &quot;Head Protection System&quot;) were fitted as standard equipment. &quot;Active Comfort Seats&quot; were introduced in 1998, to improve comfort and reduce fatigue for the driver and front passenger. This system uses two fluid-filled bladders which alternate in height.

Other equipment includes Electronic Damper Control (called EDC III), Park Distance Control (PDC), auto-dimming &amp; power folding mirrors, power moonroof, power rear sunblind, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone or tri-zone climate control, electric driver&#x27;s seat adjustment and electric steering wheel adjustment.

Double glazed windows were available (called &quot;dual pane glass&quot;). Break resistant laminated &quot;security glass&quot; was also available, which is known to delaminate. The delamination occurred with the Protection S357A option only, not with normal S352A dual pane windows. Bullet-resistant glass was used for the Protection model, with even thicker glass used for the Security model.

The Sport Package included a revised steering wheel, suspension, exterior trim, and interior wood trim. Some sports models also included a shorter differential ratio and higher stall speed for the torque converter. This allowed for a 0–97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration time of 5.9 seconds.

==In-car electronics==

The E38 was one of the first European cars to be available with satellite navigation, a system called CARIN jointly developed by BMW and Philips.

The in-car entertainment (radio, audio system, satellite navigation, television and communications systems) are part of an automotive communication system called I-bus.

A multi-function steering wheel included controls for the audio, phone, cruise control and air recirculation.

==Special models==
===L7===
From 1997 to 2001, BMW marketed an extended wheelbase limousine model called the L7. The wheelbase was extended by over the &quot;iL&quot; models, resulting in an overall length of . Features included electrically adjustable rear seats, rear footrests, fold down rear trays, a fridge, rear television screen, video player and a fax machine.

Based on the 12-cylinder 750iL , the L7 has an electronically limited top speed of . The L7 was only available in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Europe, and 899 examples were built. The 2000-2001 models had an optional &quot;privacy window&quot; glass partition to separate the driver from the rear passengers.

===Protection line===
The armoured &quot;Protection Line&quot; vehicles were built from 2000 to 2001 and were based on the 740iL and 750iL models. Security features include body armor, bullet-resistant glass, and run-flat tyres. An intercom system is provided to communicate with people outside the vehicle while the windows and doors are shut.

===Security line===
A High-Security version with protection up to B6/7 was also available in Europe, known internally as the 750iL S. The additional security measures brought an additional weight of compared to the normal 750iL.
Features include explosive cord around the windshield allowing removal of the windshield facilitating escape and hydraulically actuated windows. 
A gas sensor can detect irritants like CS gas and respond by turning the blower motor off, closing fresh air flaps and all windows. A fire suppression system is triggered by either a button or the detection of extreme temperatures in the engine bay or the vicinity of the fuel tank. 
A breathing air system is also available which delivers air from a cylinder in the trunk, 
up to three firearms cases designed to fit a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5K were also optionally available as well as spherical gunports in the doors.

===750hL===
On 11 May 2000, BMW presented a fleet of fifteen 750hL models in Berlin.
Its twelve-cylinder hydrogen combustion engine can be operated on both hydrogen and petrol. In operation on hydrogen, it delivers , accelerating from 0 to in 9.6 seconds and slowing the car to attain a top speed of .

The production of the hydrogen engine was integrated into the regular engine production at the Dingolfing plant. It differs from the conventional petrol engine essentially only in regards to the intake tract with additional injection valves for hydrogen. The hydrogen is stored cryogenically at a temperature of minus 253 degrees Celsius in a double-walled steel tank behind the rear seat back. The hydrogen tank holds 140 litres and allows an additional range of . In addition, the 750hL has a fuel cell rated at at 42 volts. This is not used as a drive unit, but as an auxiliary power unit (APU) for power supply to the electrical system.

During the Expo 2000 in Hanover, the vehicles were used as shuttles. From February to November 2001 the vehicles were part of the &quot;CleanEnergy WorldTour 2001&quot; in the cities of Dubai, Brussels, Milan, Tokyo, Los Angeles, and Berlin. By November 2001 the 750hL had achieved a mileage of over 150,000 km. On the Nürburgring the 750hL recorded a time of 9 minutes and 53 seconds while powered by hydrogen.

==Alpina B12==
The &quot;Alpina B12 5.7&quot; and &quot;Alpina B12 6.0&quot; models were based on the BMW 750i and 750iL respectively.

==Model year changes==
===1995===
* E38 Production begins in 1994, for the 1995 model year. Initial models were the 725tds, 730i/730iL, 740i/740iL and 750i/750iL.
* V8 models use a Nikasil bore coating, which experiences failures in countries with high sulfur petrol (&quot;see M60 article&quot;).
* DSC III (Dynamic Stability Control) becomes optional on the 740i/740iL and 750i/750iL.
* 740i/740iL models use differential ratio of 3.15, compared with 2.92 for following years.
* Standard equipment includes dual-zone climate control, electric front seats with a three-position memory for the driver&#x27;s seat, front-seat side tubular airbags, a six-disc CD changer, and satellite navigation.

===1996===
* 728i and 735i models introduced.
* M62 engine replaces M60 for V8 models. The capacity on 740i and 740iL engines increases from 4.0 L to 4.4 L.
* An S-EDC electronic sports suspension, onboard TV and satellite navigation system offered as options.

===1997===
* Front passenger head airbags introduced. In late 1997, E38 7 Series and E39 5 Series became the world&#x27;s first cars available with side impact head airbags. These are known as &quot;Inflatable Tubular Structure&quot; or &quot;Head Protection System&quot;, and were available as optional equipment. These airbags are designed to offer head protection in side impact collisions and also maintained inflation for up to seven seconds for rollover protection.
* The 750iL (actually a re-badged 740iL) is extensively featured in the 18th James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; starring Pierce Brosnan.

===1998 facelift===
The E38 facelift (also known as Life-Cycle Impulse) models were introduced in the 1999 model year (produced from September 1998). The major changes are:
* Revised styling for headlights and tail-lights.
* 740d model introduced, powered by the 3.9L M67 V8 twin-turbocharged diesel engine.
* 735i and 740i engines upgraded to the &quot;technical update&quot; (TU) version of the M62, featuring variable valve timing on the intake camshaft (single-VANOS).
* 728i engines upgraded to the &quot;technical update&quot; (TU) version of the M52, featuring variable valve timing on both camshafts (double-VANOS)
* Sport Package (ZSP option code) released, including M Sport suspension, Style 37 &quot;M Parallel&quot; alloy wheels, Contour seats and shadowline exterior trim.
* DSCIII electronic stability control becomes standard on all 7 Series models.
* Head airbags become standard on all 7 Series models.

===1999===
* The 750 now includes Electric Catalytic Converter, or &quot;E-CAT&quot;, assemblies. Heating coils inside the catalytic converter assemblies are electrified just after engine start, bringing the catalyst up to operating temperature very quickly to qualify the vehicle for Low emission vehicle (LEV) designation. This system required the use of a two-battery system. This electric catalytic converter had been fitted since 1995 by Alpina to their B12 5,7 E-KAT saloon based on the BMW 750i, as it had been developed jointly by Emitec, Alpina and BMW.
* From March, features such as Xenon headlamps, rain-sensitive windshield wipers, headlight washers, GPS navigation, and upgraded audio became standard for US models.

===2000===
* Display for satellite navigation upgraded in September to 6.5 inch 16:9 screen.
* Navigation upgraded to MKIII in September, therefore maps for satellite navigation switch to CD format.
* A radar-based adaptive cruise control (called Active Cruise Control) became available as an option.

===2001===

* Cosmetic changes including body-colored side skirts and bumper facias (previously black), clear turn signal lenses (previously amber).
* Sport package becomes available on 750iL.
* Additional standard equipment, including a Motorola StarTAC or TimePort mobile phone, with BMW Assist telemetry system.

==In popular culture==
In the 1997 &quot;James Bond&quot; film Tomorrow Never Dies, the sixteen E38 cars used during production were modified so they could be driven from the backseat, making it appear that Bond actor Pierce Brosnan was controlling the car using his mobile phone. The car type is actually a BMW 740iL but they were re-badged as the 750iL. One survives today and can be seen at the exhibition “TOP SECRET” at Museum Industriekultur, Nuremberg.

Besides the E38 saloons, BMW also supplied a $14,000 R1200C motorcycle. BMW received the rights to use movie clips from the film in its multimillion-dollar campaign, and during the 1997 holiday season they offered a special promotion that included the R1200C with the purchase of the 750iL.

2002’s The Transporter starred the 1995 E38 735i as co-star to Jason Statham. 

Rapper Tupac Shakur and Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight were gunned down in a black 1996 750iL. Shakur succumbed to his injuries but the car itself later was bid at auction in Las Vegas, Nevada for $1,750,000.

In the Russian and Eastern European cult classic &quot;Бумер&quot; (Bimmer) a 750i E38 BMW was used as the main vehicle in this road movie.
