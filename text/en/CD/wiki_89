<text>A bridge loan is a type of short-term loan, typically taken out for a period of 2 weeks to 3 years pending the arrangement of larger or longer-term financing. It is usually called a bridging loan in the United Kingdom, also known as a &quot;caveat loan,&quot; and also known in some applications as a swing loan. In South African usage, the term bridging finance is more common.

A bridge loan is interim financing for an individual or business until permanent financing or the next stage of financing is obtained. Money from the new financing is generally used to &quot;take out&quot; (i.e. to pay back) the bridge loan, as well as other capitalization needs.

Bridge loans are typically more expensive than conventional financing, to compensate for the additional risk. Bridge loans typically have a higher interest rate, points, costs that are amortized over a shorter period, and various other fees and &quot;sweeteners&quot; (such as equity participation by the lender in some loans). The lender also may require cross-collateralization and a lower loan-to-value ratio. On the other hand, they are typically arranged quickly with relatively little documentation.

==Real estate==

Bridge loans are often used for commercial real estate purchases to quickly close on a property, retrieve real estate from foreclosure, or take advantage of a short-term opportunity in order to secure long-term financing. Bridge loans on a property are typically paid back when the property is sold, refinanced with a traditional lender, the borrower&#x27;s creditworthiness improves, the property is improved or completed, or there is a specific improvement or change that allows a permanent or subsequent round of mortgage financing to occur. The timing issue may arise from project phases with different cash needs and risk profiles as much as ability to secure funding.

A bridge loan is similar to and overlaps with a hard money loan. Both are non-standard loans obtained due to short-term or unusual circumstances. The difference is that hard money refers to the lending source, usually an individual, investment pool, or private company that is not a bank in the business of making high-risk, high-interest loans, whereas a bridge loan is a short-term loan that &quot;bridges the gap&quot; between longer-term loans.

===Characteristics===

For typical terms of up to 12 months, 2–4 points may be charged. Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios generally do not exceed 65% for commercial properties, or 80% for residential properties, based on appraised value.

A bridge loan may be closed, meaning it is available for a predetermined time frame, or open in that there is no fixed payoff date (although there may be a required payoff after a certain time).

A first charge bridging loan is generally available at a higher LTV than a second charge bridging loan due to the lower level of risk involved, many UK lenders will steer clear of second charge lending altogether.

Lower LTVs may also attract lower rates, again representing the lower level of underwriting risk, although front-end fees, lenders legal fees, and valuation payments may remain fixed.

===Examples===

*A bridge loan is often obtained by developers to carry a project while permit approval is sought. Because there is no guarantee the project will happen, the loan might be at a high-interest rate and from a specialized lending source that will accept the risk. Once the project is fully entitled, it becomes eligible for loans from more conventional sources that are at a lower interest, for a longer term, and in a greater amount. A construction loan would then be obtained to take out the bridge loan and fund the completion of the project.
*A consumer is purchasing a new residence and plans to make a down payment with the proceeds from the sale of a currently owned home. The currently owned home will not close until after the close of the new residence. A bridge loan allows the buyer to take equity out of the current home and use it as a down payment on the new residence, with the expectation that the current home will close within a short time frame and the bridge loan will be repaid.
*A bridging loan can be used by a business to ensure continued smooth operation during a time when for example one senior partner wishes to leave whilst another wishes to continue the business. The bridging loan could be made based on the value of the company premises allowing funds to be raised via other sources for example a management buy in.
*A property may be offered at a discount if the purchaser can complete quickly with the discount offsetting the costs of the short term bridging loan used to complete. In auction property purchases where the purchaser has only 14–28 days to complete long term lending such as a buy to let mortgage may not be viable in that time frame whereas a bridging loan would be.

==Corporate finance==

Bridge loans are used in venture capital and other corporate finance for several purposes:
*To inject small amounts of cash to carry a company so that it does not run out of cash between successive major private equity financings
*To carry distressed companies while searching for an acquirer or larger investor (in which case the lender often obtains a substantial equity position in connection with the loan)
*As a final debt financing to carry the company through the immediate period before an initial public offering or an acquisition.

==South Africa==

In South African law immovable property is transferred via a system of registration in public registries known as Deeds Offices. Given the delays resulting from the transfer process, many participants in property transactions require access to funds which will otherwise only become available on the day that the transaction is registered in the relevant Deeds Office.

Bridging finance companies provide finance that creates a bridge between the participant&#x27;s immediate cash flow requirement and the eventual entitlement to funds on registration in the Deeds Office. Bridging finance is typically not provided by banks.

Various forms of bridging finance are available, depending on the participant in the property transaction that requires finance. Sellers of fixed property can bridge sales proceeds, estate agents bridge estate agents&#x27; commission, and mortgagors bridge the proceeds of further or switch bonds. Bridging finance is also available to settle outstanding property taxes or municipal accounts or to pay transfer duties.

==United Kingdom==

===History===

Short term finance similar to modern bridging loans was available in the UK as early as the 1960s, but usually only through high street banks and building societies to known customers. The bridging loan market remained small into the millennium, with a limited number of lenders.

Bridging loans became increasingly popular in the UK after the 2008–2009 global recession, with gross lending more than doubling from £0.8 billion in the year to March 2011 to £2.2 billion in the year to June 2014. This coincided with a marked decline in mainstream mortgage lending in the same period, as banks and building societies grew more reluctant to grant home loans.

The overall value of the residential loan amounts outstanding in Q1 2016 was £1,304.5billion, an increase of 1.0% compared with Q4 2015 and an increase of 3.4% over the past four quarters.

As the popularity of bridging loans increased, so too did the controversy around them. In 2011, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) warned homebuyers against using bridging loans as substitutes for ordinary mortgages, expressing fears that some mortgage brokers might be misrepresenting their suitability.

===Usage===

In the United Kingdom, bridging loans are used in both business and real estate. In the former, they are typically used to free equity in order to boost cash flow. In the latter, they are used by home-movers to ‘break’ property chains by providing a short-term source of finance when there is a delay between sale and completion dates, by buyers bidding on property at auction, and by landlords and property developers to secure renovation finance for quick sale or to refurbish a property that is considered uninhabitable prior to obtaining ordinary mortgage finance.

===Characteristics===

Bridging loans can be secured as a first or second charge against real property, including commercial real estate, buy-to-let property, dilapidated property and land or building plots. Loan terms typically run up to 18 months, with compound interest charged monthly; as such, they are often more expensive than other types of secured home loan.

Bridging loans are defined as either ‘opened’ or ‘closed’. A loan is closed if the borrower has a clear and credible repayment plan or exit strategy in place, such as the sale of the loan security or longer-term finance. Open bridging loans are riskier to both the borrower and creditor due to the greater likelihood of default.

===Regulation===
Bridging loans secured by first charge against a property in which the borrower or a close family member will reside are considered regulated mortgage contracts, and are therefore regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Bridging loans sold to landlords and property developers are generally not regulated; however, if the occupant of the rental property against which the loan is secured is or will be a close family member of the borrower, FCA regulation will still apply.

An exception currently exists in the case of mixed-use properties, where the borrower or a close relative will occupy less than 40% of the property. In March 2016, however, the UK will be forced to bring its existing legislation in line with that of Europe, under the pan-European Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD). As the MCD does not recognise usage thresholds when defining a regulated contract, it is currently unclear whether the ‘40% rule’ will continue to apply.

<doc id="900340" wikidata="Q57202" url="?curid=900340" title="Magda Goebbels">
<text>Johanna Maria Magdalena &quot;Magda&quot; Goebbels (née Ritschel; 11 November 1901 – 1 May 1945) was the wife of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. A prominent member of the Nazi Party, she was a close ally, companion, and political supporter of Adolf Hitler. Some historians refer to her as the unofficial &quot;first lady&quot; of Nazi Germany, while others give that title to Emmy Göring.

With defeat imminent during the Battle of Berlin at the end of World War II in Europe, she and her husband poisoned their six children with a cyanide compound before committing suicide in the Reich Chancellery gardens. Her eldest son, Harald Quandt, from a previous marriage to Günther Quandt, survived her.

==Early life==
Magda was born in 1901 in Berlin, Germany, to an unwed couple, Auguste Behrend and building contractor and engineer Oskar Ritschel. The couple were married later that year and divorced in either 1904 or 1905. Some sources claim their marriage took place before Magda&#x27;s birth, although there is no evidence to support the occurrence of a prior wedding. When Magda was five, her mother sent her to Cologne to stay with her ex-husband. In 1908, her mother married Richard Friedländer, a wealthy Jewish merchant who lived in Brussels, and adopted Magda to give her his surname. In Brussels, Magda was enrolled at the Ursuline Convent in Vilvoorde where she was remembered as &quot;an active and intelligent little girl&quot;.

In 2016, it was reported that Friedländer may have been Magda&#x27;s biological father, as stated in his residency card, found in the Berlin archives by writer and historian Oliver Hilmes. Magda&#x27;s adoption may have been required for her parents&#x27; delayed marriage, to update the girl&#x27;s &#x27;illegitimate child&#x27; status.

From 1908 until the outbreak of World War I, the family remained in Brussels. In 1914, all Germans were forced to leave Belgium as refugees to avoid repercussions from the Belgian people after the German invasion. The family moved to Berlin where Magda attended the high school Kolmorgen Lycée. Behrend divorced Friedländer in 1914, and in 1919, Magda was enrolled in the prestigious &#x27;Töchternheim Holzhausen&#x27; (Ladies&#x27; College Holzhausen) near Goslar. While in Berlin, Magda befriended Lisa Arlosoroff and later became intimate with her brother Haim, an ardent Zionist. During her relationship with Haim, she briefly wore a Star of David he had given her and accompanied him to Jewish youth club meetings. The relationship did not last but the two remained in contact during the 1920s until Haim&#x27;s migration to Mandatory Palestine, where he later headed the Jewish Agency department. Haim was assassinated in Tel Aviv in June 1933 in an unsolved murder case, possibly related to his public position in the Jewish Labor Party.

==Marriage and son with Günther Quandt==
In 1920, while returning to school on a train, she met Günther Quandt, a rich German industrialist twice her age. Thereafter, he courted her with courtesy and grand gestures. He demanded that she change her surname back to Ritschel (after having for many years borne the surname of Friedländer), when converting from Catholicism to Quandt&#x27;s Protestantism. They were married on 4 January 1921, and their first child, Harald, was born on 1 November 1921.

Magda soon grew frustrated in her marriage; Quandt spent little time with her, as his main interest was the expansion of his business empire. The couple had six children – Harald, Quandt&#x27;s two sons from a prior marriage, and three children of a deceased friend.

In October 1927, the couple went on a two-month visit to the United States, to conduct business with the Lloyd Electric Storage Battery Co. of Philadelphia. In 1929, Quandt discovered that Magda was having an affair, so they separated and divorced later in the year. The terms of the divorce were quite generous to Magda.

==Marriage and family with Joseph Goebbels==
In 1930, Magda attended a meeting of the Nazi Party where she was impressed by one of the speakers, Joseph Goebbels, then the Gauleiter of Berlin. She joined the party on 1 September 1930, and did some volunteer work, although she has not been characterized as politically active. From the local branch, Magda moved to the party headquarters in Berlin and for a brief period became secretary to Hans Meinshausen, Goebbels&#x27; deputy, before being invited to take charge of Goebbels&#x27; own private papers. She and Goebbels became romantically involved while on a short trip with friends to Weimar in February 1931. A relationship began and by April they began making plans for their future together. Goebbels wrote in his diary, &quot;We have made a solemn vow to each other: When we have conquered the Reich, we will become man and wife. I am very happy.&quot; Her flat on Theodor-Heuss-Platz (then named the &quot;Reichskanzlerplatz&quot;) soon became a favourite meeting place for Adolf Hitler and other NSDAP officials.

By September, the Goebbels relationship was experiencing problems. Goebbels was often jealous, and had some concern over the fact that Hitler had grown fond of Magda. Magda decided to advance their wedding date, and the couple were married on 19 December 1931, with Hitler as a witness. Otto Wagener claims that Magda&#x27;s marriage to Goebbels was somewhat arranged; since Hitler intended to remain unmarried, it was suggested that as the wife of a leading and highly visible Nazi official she might eventually act as &quot;first lady of the Third Reich&quot;. Magda was an ambitious woman with social connections and upper class bearing that may have influenced Goebbels&#x27; own enthusiasm. Goebbels biographer Peter Longerich concurred with this &quot;plausible&quot; conclusion as well. Meissner contends that Hitler (though undoubtedly impressed by Magda) was an exceptionally close friend of the couple in the early days. Hitler grew very fond of the Goebbels&#x27; six children and enjoyed staying at their Berlin apartment, where he could relax and would often arrive there late at night, sitting and talking with Goebbels, with their baby Helga (born 1932) on his lap.

Magda had thus a close relationship with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends. She acted as an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues. After 1933, the Goebbels family became accustomed to the luxurious lifestyle which went with their high social position. Their Berlin home on Göringstrasse was remodeled by Albert Speer and they spent the spring and summers in Kladow. In 1936, they bought a villa on Schwanenwerder island and later another at Bogensee near Wandlitz in Brandenburg.

Joseph and Magda Goebbels had six children: Helga (1932), Hilde (1934), Helmut (1935), Holde (1937), Hedda (1938), and Heide (1940). Joseph Goebbels had many affairs during the marriage. In 1936, Goebbels met the Czech actress Lída Baarová and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her. Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about the situation on 15 August 1938. Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship. Thereafter, Goebbels and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September. The couple had another falling out at that point, and once again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together. Hitler arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October 1938. Magda also had affairs, including relationships with Kurt Ludecke in 1933 and Karl Hanke in 1938.

==War years==
At the outbreak of war, Magda&#x27;s son by her first marriage, Harald Quandt, became a Luftwaffe pilot and fought at the front, while, at home, she lived up to the image of a patriotic mother by training as a Red Cross nurse and working with the electronics company Telefunken, and travelled to work on a bus, like her colleagues. She was also involved with entertaining the wives of foreign heads of state, supporting the troops and comforting war widows.

Both Goebbels and Magda derived personal benefits and social status from their close association with Hitler, and the couple remained loyal to Hitler and publicly supported him. Privately, however, Magda expressed doubts, especially after the war began to go badly on the Eastern Front. On 9 November 1942, during a gathering with friends listening to a speech by Hitler, she switched off the radio exclaiming, &quot;My God, what a lot of rubbish.&quot; In 1944, she reportedly said of Hitler, &quot;He no longer listens to voices of reason. Those who tell him what he wants to hear are the only ones he believes.&quot; There is no evidence that Magda attempted to intervene to save her Jewish stepfather from the Holocaust; he was deported to Buchenwald in 1938 and died soon after. Asked about her husband&#x27;s antisemitism, she answered: &quot;The Führer wants it thus, and Joseph must obey.&quot;

Felix Franks, a German Jew who later became a British soldier, claimed that his grandparents got an exit visa from Germany with the help of Magda Goebbels:

Afflicted with a weak heart and &quot;delicate health&quot;, Magda would have extended periods of illness. Towards the end of the war, she is known to have also suffered from severe depression and trigeminal neuralgia. This condition affects a nerve in the face, and although usually harmless is considered to cause intense pain and can be notoriously hard to treat. This often left her bedridden and led to bouts of hospitalization as late as August 1944.

==Death==
In late April 1945, the Soviet Red Army entered Berlin, and the Goebbels family moved into the &quot;Vorbunker&quot;, connected to the lower &quot;Führerbunker&quot; under the Reich Chancellery garden. Magda wrote a farewell letter to her son Harald, who was in a POW camp in North Africa:

Goebbels added a postscript to Hitler&#x27;s last will and testament of 29 April 1945 stating that he would disobey the order to leave Berlin, &quot;[f]or reasons of humanity and personal loyalty&quot;. Further, he stated that Magda and their children supported his refusal to leave Berlin and his resolution to die in the bunker. He later qualified this by stating that the children would support the decision [to commit suicide] if they were old enough to speak for themselves.

Magda was among the last to see both Hitler and Eva Braun before they committed suicide on the afternoon of 30 April 1945. On the following day, 1 May, Magda and Joseph arranged for SS dentist Helmut Kunz to inject their six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of cyanide could be then crushed in each of their mouths. Kunz later stated he gave the children morphine injections, but it was Magda and SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Ludwig Stumpfegger (Hitler&#x27;s personal doctor) who administered the cyanide. Author James P. O&#x27;Donnell concluded that although Stumpfegger was probably involved in drugging the children, Magda killed them herself.

Magda appears to have contemplated and talked about killing her children a month in advance. According to her friend and sister-in-law (from her first marriage) Ello Quandt, she told her that they were all going to take poison.
Magda appears to have refused several offers, such as one by Albert Speer, to have the children smuggled out of Berlin and insisted that the family must stay at her husband&#x27;s side. In the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; she confided to Hitler&#x27;s secretary Traudl Junge, that &quot;I would rather have my children die, than live in disgrace, jeered at. My children stand no chance in Germany after the war&quot;. The last survivor of Hitler&#x27;s bunker, Rochus Misch, gave this account of the events to the BBC:

Magda helped the girls change into long white nightgowns. She then softly combed their hair. Misch tried to concentrate on his work, but he knew what was going to happen. Magda then went back up to the &quot;Vorbunker&quot; with the children. Shortly thereafter, Werner Naumann came down to the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; and told Misch that he had seen Hitler&#x27;s personal physician, Dr Stumpfegger, give the children something &quot;sweetened&quot; to drink. About two hours later, Magda came back down to the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;, alone. She looked very pale, her eyes very red and her face was &quot;frozen&quot;. She sat down at a table and began playing patience. Goebbels then came over to her, but did not say a word at that time.

After their children were dead, Magda and Joseph Goebbels walked up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they committed suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. One account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where Hitler had been buried, and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels&#x27; SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels&#x27; prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels&#x27; body, which did not move. The bodies were then doused with petrol, but the remains were only partially burned and not buried.

The charred corpses were found on the afternoon of 2 May 1945 by Soviet troops. Magda&#x27;s face was unrecognizable compared to that of her husband. According to the purported Soviet autopsy of her body, her jawbones and dental remains were found &quot;detached in the oral cavity&quot;. The children were found in the &quot;Vorbunker&quot; dressed in their nightclothes, with ribbons tied in the girls&#x27; hair. The remains of the Goebbels&#x27; family, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler&#x27;s dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. The last burial was at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg facility. The remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.

<text>Bailly is a lunar impact crater that is located near the south-west limb of the Moon. It was named after French astronomer Jean S. Bailly. The oblique viewing angle gives the crater a foreshortened appearance, and the location near the limb can limit visibility due to libration. The most favorable time for viewing this feature is near the full moon when the terminator is crossing the crater wall.

==Description==
This is the largest crater on the near side of the Moon. In area it is comparable in size to a small mare. It lies north of the crater Le Gentil and east of Hausen. Further west of Bailly are the (unofficially named) Montes Dörfel mountains.

Bailly&#x27;s uneven crater floor has remained free of lava flooding, and it is covered with a multitude of ridges and craters. The entire crater has been battered and worn, and the outer s are eroded and in some places have even been worn away by myriad impacts. If the crater ever possessed a central peak, it is no longer discernible. Due to its current condition, observers have termed this feature a &#x27;field of ruins&#x27;.

Due to the size and the worn state of this crater, it is estimated to be more than 3 billion years old, and is part of the Nectarian system.

== Satellite craters ==
The south-eastern part of the crater is home to two notable craters, designated Bailly A and Bailly B. These craters overlap, and Bailly A lies across the rim of Bailly&#x27;s mountainous wall. Selenographer Giovanni Battista Riccioli named Bailly B, &quot;Bartolus&quot; for fellow Ferrarese Jesuit Daniello Bartoli (1608-1685) in his Almagestum novum (1651). The name was not recognized by the IAU.

<doc id="900346" wikidata="Q1004491" url="?curid=900346" title="Bullialdus (crater)">
<text>Bullialdus is a lunar impact crater located in the western part of the Mare Nubium. It was named after French astronomer Ismaël Boulliau. To the north by north-west is the broken-rimmed and lava-flooded crater Lubiniezky. South-west of Bullialdus lies the smaller crater König.
The relatively isolated location of this crater serves to highlight its well-formed shape. Bullialdus has a high outer rim that is circular but observers have noted a slightly polygonal appearance. The inner walls are d and contain many signs of landslips. The outer s are covered in a wide &quot;ejecta&quot; blanket that highlights a radial pattern of low ridges and valleys.
In the center of the crater is a formation of several peaks and rises that climb to over a kilometer in height. A raised ridge runs from the peaks to the south-east, until finally merging with the inner wall. The floor of the crater is generally rough with many low rises. Overall it has a somewhat convex shape, bulging upward toward the middle. When the Sun is at a high angle, the rim and central mountains appear brighter than the surroundings, and white patches can be viewed on the crater floor.

Infrared studies of the crater region have revealed at least three layers of strata. The impact may also have intersected a mafic pluton, which means a crystallized body of igneous rock that has high concentrations of heavier elements (such as magnesium, in this case).

Bullialdus is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bullialdus. Bullialdus A lies just to the south-west of Bullialdus, within its ramparts. To the south of Bullialdus A is the slightly smaller Bullialdus B.

<doc id="900356" wikidata="Q767765" url="?curid=900356" title="Radicchio">
<text>Radicchio ( , ), because of its common use in Italian cuisine, is a perennial cultivated form of leaf chicory (&quot;Cichorium intybus&quot;, Asteraceae). It is grown as a leaf vegetable and usually has colorful, white-veined red leaves that form a head. Radicchio has a bitter and spicy taste that mellows if it is grilled or roasted.

== History ==
Pliny the Elder wrote in &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; that radicchio was useful as a blood purifier and an aid for insomniacs. Radicchio contains intybin, a sedative/analgesic, as well as a type of flavonoid, called anthocyanin.

Modern cultivation of the plant began in the fifteenth century in the Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino regions of Italy, but the deep-red radicchio of today was engineered in 1860 by Belgian agronomist Francesco Van den Borre, who used a technique called &quot;imbianchimento&quot; (whitening), &quot;preforcing&quot;, or blanching to create the dark red, white-veined leaves. The plants are taken from the soil and placed in water in darkened sheds, where lack of light and ensuing inhibition of chlorophyll production cause the plants to lose their green pigmentation.

== Varieties ==
The varieties of radicchio are named after the Italian regions where they originate: the most widely available variety in the United States is radicchio di Chioggia, the most popular and widely used variety. It is a round head of the plant, which means it offers the consumer the most uninterrupted surface of the deep red coloring. It was created through genetic selection by local farmers in the early 1900s for this reason. The IGP area for Chioggia includes just ten towns from the boroughs of Venice (where one finds Chioggia itself), Padua, and Rovigo.

Radicchio rosso di Treviso precoce is a longer head than Chioggia, and the white veins are more pronounced. It has a distinctive bitter taste, and the heads are blanched as per the endive procedure to achieve the coloring and flavoring (heads are tied and left without light for two to three weeks post-harvest). The IGP area includes 24 towns in the boroughs of Treviso, Venice, and Padua.

Other varieties include &#x27;Tardivo&#x27;; Treviso tardivo is considered the king of radicchio in Italy. It involves weeks of painstaking manual labor using a traditional forced growing and blanching method to produce the white ribs with red tops. After harvest, the heads are left in tanks of running resurgence water for two weeks. They are then cut, washed, and packaged. There are strict regulations on the length and appearance of the root left on the head. Radicchio tardivo is crunchy and bitter and is usually eaten cooked.

The di Castelfranco both resemble flowers, and Castelfranco is very different in appearance to the other radicchio types with creamy, light green leaves and deep red speckles. It has a sweeter flavor than the other varieties and is thought to have first been cultivated in the 800s, originating from crossing original radicchio plants with escarole. The IGP area covers 25 towns in the boroughs of Treviare, available only in the winter months, as well as &#x27;Gorizia&#x27; (also known as &quot;Rosa di Gorizia&quot;), &#x27;Trieste&#x27; (Cicoria zuccherina or Biondissim). Radicchio farmers of the Veneto have sought to have Protected Geographical Status applied to the names of some radicchio varieties, including &#x27;Tardivo.&#x27;

== Culinary uses ==
In Italian cuisine, it is usually eaten grilled with olive oil or mixed into dishes such as risotto. It can also be served with pasta or be used in strudel, as a poultry stuffing, or as an ingredient for a tapenade.

As with all chicories, its roots, after roasting and grinding, can be used as a coffee substitute or coffee additive.

== Toxicity ==
According to folklore, long-term use of chicory as a coffee substitute may damage human retinal tissue, dimming vision over time and other long-term effects. Modern scientific literature contains little evidence to support or refute this claim. Root chicory contains volatile oils similar to those found in plants in the related genus &quot;Tanacetum&quot;, which includes tansy, and is likewise effective in eliminating intestinal worms. All parts of the plant contain these volatile oils, with most of the toxic components concentrated in the plant&#x27;s root.

Studies indicate that ingestion of chicory by farm animals results in a reduction of worm burdens, which has prompted its widespread use as a forage supplement.

== Cultivation ==
Radicchio is easy to grow but performs best in spring (USDA Zone 8 and above) and autumn gardens. It prefers more frequent but not deep watering, though the amount of water varies based on soil type. Infrequent watering will lead to a more bitter-tasting leaf. However, for autumn crops, the flavor is changed predominantly by the onset of cold weather (the colder, the mellower), which also initiates the heading and reddening process in traditional varieties. There are newer, self-heading varieties whose taste is not yet as good as a traditional variety which has matured through several frosts or freezes (e.g., Alouette). Radicchio matures in approximately three months. However, it can be made to stand through a British or West European winter, and the head will regenerate if cut off carefully above ground level, so long as the plant is protected against severe frost. A light-excluding cover (e.g., an inverted pot) may be used during the latter phases of growth to produce leaves with a more pronounced colour contrast, simultaneously protecting against frost and cold winds. Traditionally in the United Kingdom, the first cutting of chicory heads was thrown away, and the tender, forced, second head was for the table. However, improved varieties of radicchio (e.g., Rosso di Verona) and generally milder winters allow the West European cultivator to harvest two or more crops from a single planting.

<doc id="900357" wikidata="Q160474" url="?curid=900357" title="Usufruct">
<text>Usufruct () is a limited real right (or &quot;in rem&quot; right) found in civil law and mixed jurisdictions that unites the two property interests of &quot;usus&quot; and &quot;fructus&quot;:
* &quot;Usus&quot; (&quot;use&quot;, as in usage of or access to) is the right to use or enjoy a thing possessed, directly and without altering it.
* &quot;Fructus&quot; (&quot;fruit&quot;, as in the fruits of production) is the right to derive profit from a thing possessed: for instance, by selling crops, leasing immovables or annexed movables, taxing for entry, and so on.

A usufruct is either granted in severalty or held in common ownership, as long as the property is not damaged or destroyed. The third civilian property interest is &quot;abusus&quot; (literally &quot;abuse&quot;), the right to alienate the thing possessed, either by consuming or destroying it (e.g., for profit), or by transferring it to someone else (e.g., sale, exchange, gift). Someone enjoying all three rights has full ownership.

Generally, a usufruct is a system in which a person or group of persons uses the real property (often land) of another. The &quot;usufructuary&quot; does not own the property, but does have an interest in it, which is sanctioned or contractually allowed by the owner. Two different systems of usufruct exist: perfect and imperfect. In a perfect usufruct, the usufructuary is entitled to the use of the property but cannot substantially change it. For example, an owner of a small business may become ill and grant the right of usufruct to an individual to run their business. The usufructuary thus has the right to operate the business and gain income from it, but does not have the right to, for example, tear down the business and replace it, or to sell it. The imperfect usufruct system gives the usufructuary some ability to modify the property. For example, if a land owner grants a piece of land to a usufructuary for agricultural use, the usufructuary may have the right to not only grow crops on the land but also make improvements that would help in farming, say by building a barn. However this can be disadvantageous to the usufructuary: if a usufructuary makes material improvements such as a building, or fixtures attached to the building, or other fixed structures to their usufruct, they do not own the improvements, and any money spent on those improvements would belong to the original owner at the end of the usufruct.

In many usufructuary property systems, such as the traditional &quot;ejido&quot; system in Mexico, individuals or groups may only acquire the usufruct of the property, not legal ownership. A usufruct is directly equatable to a common-law life estate except that a usufruct can be granted for a term shorter than the holder&#x27;s lifetime.

== History ==
Usufruct comes from civil law, under which it is a subordinate real right (&quot;ius in re aliena&quot;) of limited duration, usually for a person&#x27;s lifetime. The holder of a usufruct, known as a usufructuary, has the right to use (&quot;usus&quot;) the property and enjoy its fruits (&quot;fructus&quot;). In modern terms, &quot;fructus&quot; more or less corresponds to the profit one may make, as when selling the &quot;fruits&quot; (in both literal and figurative senses) of the land or leasing a house.

&quot;Fruits&quot; refers to any renewable commodity on the property, including (among others) actual fruits, livestock and even rental payments derived from the property. These may be divided into civil (&quot;fructus civiles&quot;), industrial (&quot;fructus industriales&quot;), and natural fruits (&quot;fructus naturales&quot;), the latter of which, in Roman law, included slaves and livestock.

Under Roman law, usufruct was a type of personal servitude (&quot;servitutes personarum&quot;), a beneficial right in another&#x27;s property. The usufructuary never had possession of this property (on the basis that if he possessed at all, he did so through the owner), but he did have an interest in the property itself for a period, either a term of years, or a lifetime. Unlike the owner, the usufructuary did not have a right of alienation (&quot;abusus&quot;), but he could sell or lease his usufructuary interest. Even though a usufructuary did not have possessory title, he could sue for relief in the form of a modified possessory interdict (prohibiting order).

In some indigenous cultures, usufruct means the land is owned in common by the people, but families and individuals have the right to use certain plots of land. Land is considered village or communal land rather than owned by individual people. While people can take fruits of the land, they may not sell or abuse it in ways that stop future use of the land by the community.

Ancient examples of usufruct are found in the Code of Hammurabi and the Law of Moses. The Law of Moses directed property owners not to harvest the edges of their fields, and reserved the gleanings for the poor.

Thomas Jefferson famously wrote in 1789 that &quot;Earth belongs in usufruct to the living.&quot; Jefferson&#x27;s metaphor means that, like a usufructuary, human beings have the right to use the earth for their own benefit and derive profit from it, but only to the extent that their actions do not impoverish the earth&#x27;s bounty for future generations. It was, in other words, an expression both of rights (of the living) and obligations (of the living to those yet to be born). Jefferson&#x27;s use of the word &quot;living&quot; is critical here: he meant that the usufructuaries of the world are those who are alive, not deceased past generations. This idea would profoundly influence Jefferson over the course of his life, and would lead to his acknowledgement that the Constitution of the United States would be revised by future generations, and was part of the reason that the Constitution includes a provision for its own amendment.

== Local variations ==

=== France ===
In France usufruct applies in inheritances. Under French law an indefeasible portion known as the &quot;forced estate&quot; passes to the deceased&#x27;s surviving spouse and issue (with shares apportioned according to the number of children), with the rest of the estate – the &quot;free estate&quot; – free to dispose of by will. However, the surviving spouse may elect to distribute the forced estate as is, or convert it into a usufruct, or break up the estate into a distributable portion and a usufruct good for the children&#x27;s lifetime. If a usufruct is chosen, a value is set for the usufruct interest for inheritance tax purposes and payable by the surviving spouse, on a sliding scale according to his/her age.

The value of furniture and household items is calculated using a standard formula based on the appraised value of the estate&#x27;s liquid and non-liquid assets, then the usufruct&#x27;s value to the surviving spouse is subtracted, and finally the remaining balance is divided among the children on the death of the surviving spouse. This simplifies handling household items since the surviving spouse is free to maintain, replace or dispose of them as he/she wishes during his/her lifetime, with the monetary value of the items going to the children. Title to assets does not pass, and the usufruct disappears on death or at the end of a term of years. A usufruct is distinct from a trust or similar settlement. French law breaks with Roman law by construing a usufruct as &quot;not&quot; a servitude but rather a possessory interest.

=== United States ===

====Louisiana====
Although the United States is for the most part a common law jurisdiction recognizing life estate instead of usufruct, Louisiana is a civil-law jurisdiction, specifically following the French and Spanish models. In Louisiana, usufructs generally are created in a manner similar to other real rights, by gift (&quot;donation&quot;), will (&quot;testament&quot;), or operation of law. Nevertheless, they are typically granted &quot;cestui que vie&quot;. Unless otherwise provided in a will, a person&#x27;s share of community property accedes to descendants as bare title holders (&quot;naked owners&quot;); nevertheless, if that person has a living spouse, the latter will receive a usufruct in that portion of the estate until death or remarriage (La. Civil Code art. 890). Under certain other conditions, a usufruct may arise giving rights to that person&#x27;s parents.

====Georgia====
While Georgia does not share Louisiana&#x27;s civil law history, Georgia General Assembly statutorily created usufructs. In Georgia, a usufruct is &quot;rights or privileges usually arising out of landlord and tenant relationships, and with privileges granted to tenants holding less interest in real estate than estate for years&quot;. Under Georgia law, if a landowner grants a lease for fewer than five years, the lease agreement is a usufruct, and the landowner retains the estate. Additionally, Georgia courts consider as a usufruct any relationship between a landowner and a lessee where the restrictions are &quot;so pervasive as to be fundamentally inconsistent with the concept of an estate for years&quot;, or the landowner retains &quot;dominion and control&quot; over the business operating on the property.

=== Philippines ===
Philippine law relating to usufruct is set forth primarily in Title VI of the Philippine Civil Code.

===Scotland===
A liferent, by which a usufruct is known in Scots law, is the right to receive for life the benefits of a property or other asset, without the right to dispose of the property or asset. An individual who enjoys this right is called a liferenter. The owner of a property burdened by a usufruct is called the fiar and right of ownership is known as the fee.

===Cuba===
Usufruct has been revived as part of the agricultural change associated with Cuba&#x27;s Special Period. As a legacy of sanctions and a struggling economy, Cuba had accumulated many crumbling buildings that could not be repaired. These were torn down and the empty lots lay idle for years until the food shortages forced Cuban citizens to make use of every piece of land. Initially, this was an ad-hoc process where ordinary Cubans took the initiative to grow their own food in whatever piece of land was available. Tenure but not ownership was formalised with a legal framework using usufruct to give farmers rights on a profit-sharing basis to the products produced from the land, but not ownership rights to the land itself.

=== India === 
Usufructuary mortgage in the Indian market denotes a unique property financing arrangement where the mortgagor surrenders possession to the mortgagee, explicitly or implicitly. This distinctive mortgage type intertwines property ownership &amp; loan repayment, granting the mortgagee the right to utilize and derive income from the property. Commonly employed in agricultural sectors, this arrangement aids farmers who may lack liquidity but possess valuable land assets. Usufructuary mortgages align with India&#x27;s diverse economic landscape, facilitating financial access for those with immovable assets. The Indian legal system recognizes and regulates these transactions, emphasizing the nuanced role this mortgage type plays in fostering economic activities, especially in rural settings.

==In social ecology==
Usufruct is a central concept in social ecology. Murray Bookchin defines usufruct informally as

The freedom of individuals in a community to appropriate resources merely by virtue of the fact that they are using them 
Bookchin contrasts Usufruct with other property relations, saying:

Usufruct, in short, differs qualitatively from the quid pro quo of reciprocity, exchange, and mutual aid — all of which are trapped within history&#x27;s demeaning account books with their &quot;just&quot; ratios and their &quot;honest&quot; balance sheets.
He pairs the concept of usufruct with complementarity and the irreducible minimum as core to his ethical world view. 

What &quot;civilization&quot; has given us, in spite of itself, is the recognition that the ancient values of usufruct, complementarity, and the irreducible minimum must be extended from the kin group to humanity as a whole.

<text>Mark Fiore is an American political cartoonist specializing in Flash-animated editorial cartoons. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 2010, the first ever for cartoon that did not appear in print.

== Career ==
&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called Fiore &quot;the undisputed guru&quot; of his editorial cartoon niche. 

Fiore lives in San Francisco, California, and his cartoons have appeared in numerous American papers and a number of web sites. He studied political science at Colorado College and was a staff cartoonist for the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;. He left newspapers for animated online comics in 2001, and he currently makes animated editorial cartoons for his web site markfiore.com, from which he also sells DVDs of his cartoons. He is a member of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists.

Fiore&#x27;s comics were included in Ted Rall&#x27;s &quot;,&quot; along with other web-comics such as &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot;, &quot;Diesel Sweeties&quot;, &quot;Fetus-X&quot;, and &quot;The Perry Bible Fellowship&quot;. In their review of &quot;Attitude 3&quot;, the American Library Association&#x27;s &quot;Booklist&quot; called Fiore&#x27;s cartoons a standout for their &quot;unique and personal&quot; vision.

==Recurring characters==
In some of his Flash cartoons, Fiore makes use of several characters more than once. Some of those characters include:

* Suzie Newsykins
* Dogboy &amp; Mr. Dan—an anthropomorphic dog chats who with his friend Mr. Dan, who is rabidly conservative
* Buster Bunker The Friendly Nuke—a nuke
* Knuckles—a slow man in an executioner&#x27;s mask who loves torturing Guantanamo prisoners
* Flamey McGassy
* Ouchie—a talking bandaid
* Captain Killmore
* Snuggly the Security Bear—a rather sadistic teddy bear who puts a positive spin on domestic spying and wiretaps
* Right-wing Ralphie—a squat lawyer with pixie wings who fights for homosexuals to gain restitution for being &quot;forced&quot; into marriage; after the passage of California&#x27;s Proposition 8, Ralphie celebrates the &quot;protection of heterosexual marriage&quot;; he is a caricature of Ralph Reed, the former Religious Right leader
* Buzzie the Fly—a Cajun fly who updates the nation on the New Orleans reconstruction, especially the living conditions of Hurricane Katrina refugees

== Awards ==

Fiore was awarded an Online Journalism Award by the Online News Association and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. He was nominated for the National Cartoonist Society New Media Award in 2000 and he won it for 2001 and 2002. He also won the 2005 Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award in the category of cartoons.

===Pulitzer Prize===
Fiore won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. He is the first cartoonist to win an editorial cartooning Pulitzer for an entry of entirely online animations, and his winning work appears on SFGate.com, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; web site. The Pulitzer Prize committee, in a statement, said that &quot;his biting wit, extensive research and ability to distill complex issues [on the web site] set a high standard for an emerging form of commentary.&quot;

<text>Qaratays (Karatais, Karatays) are a Mordvinian ethnic group in Kamsko-Ustyinsky District, Tatarstan around the village of Mordovsky Karatay. They speak a variety of the Tatar language complemented by Moksha words, which is sometimes considered as a Qaratay dialect of the Kazan Tatar language. They number about 100.

Once they lived in three villages, but one of them was submerged by Kuybyshev Reservoir. Another one was re-settled as &quot;unprospective&quot; during the 1950s.
The village of Mordovsky Karatay became the last Qaratay village.

Their ancestors lived in the territory of today Tatarstan and were assimilated by Volga Bolgars and Tatars between the 8th and 15th centuries. Living around Tatars, they started speaking a Tatar language. Neighbouring Mordvins in Tetyushsky District, however, still speak a Uralic language.

<text>Eric Garcia (born January 3, 1964), professionally known by his stage name Evil E, is an American disc jockey. He&#x27;s best known as the DJ for Ice-T, who brought him in to his production company Rhyme Syndicate in the mid-1980s. He is the brother of fellow rapper Henry &quot;Hen-Gee&quot; Garcia, with whom he formed the duo Spinmasters.

== Career ==
Eric Garcia was born January 3, 1964, to Honduran parents and grew up in Brooklyn, New York with his brother Henry. They both appeared in the 1985 film Rappin&#x27; alongside Ice-T. They removed to the West Coast and joined Ice-T&#x27;s Rhyme Syndicate, wherein Eric provided scratches serving as a deejay. Evil E appeared on the front covers of Ice-T&#x27;s first two albums.

He appeared on the spoken word track &quot;Evil E-What About Sex?&quot; on the Ice-T&#x27;s &quot;O.G. Original Gangster&quot; album, and raps on Ice-T&#x27;s track &quot;Pimp Behind the Wheels&quot; on the &quot;Home Invasion&quot; album. Later on, in 1991, he released a full-length album with Hen-Gee, titled &quot;Brothers&quot; (Pendulum/Elektra), which spawned singles: &quot;Lil Trig&quot; (peaked at #15 on the Hot Rap Songs) and &quot;If U Were Mine&quot; (peaked at #85 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs).

Evil E and Hen-Gee were managed by Guy Oseary, an independent Artists and Repertoire (A&amp;R) representative in 1989.

Although Evil E&#x27;s contribution to Ice-T&#x27;s records became less prominent after 1993, he was still touring with Ice-T as late as 2018.

<doc id="900383" wikidata="Q104582" url="?curid=900383" title="Victor Grignard">
<text>Francois Auguste Victor Grignard (6 May 1871 – 13 December 1935) was a French chemist who won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the eponymously named Grignard reagent and Grignard reaction, both of which are important in the formation of carbon–carbon bonds. He also wrote some of his experiments in his laboratory notebooks.

== Biography ==

Grignard was the son of a sailmaker. He was a hard-working student and was described as having a humble and friendly attitude. He also had a talent for mathematics. After attempting to major in mathematics, Grignard failed his entrance exams before being drafted into the army in 1892. After one year of service, he returned to pursue his studies of mathematics at the University of Lyon and finally obtained his degree Licencié ès Sciences Mathématiques in 1894. In December of the same year, he transferred to chemistry and began working with Professors Philippe Barbier (1848–1922) and Louis Bouveault (1864–1909). After working with stereochemistry and énines, Grignard was not impressed with the subject matter and asked Barbier about a new direction for his doctoral research. Barbier advised that Grignard study how a failed Saytzeff reaction using zinc, was successful, in low yields, after substitution of magnesium. They sought to synthesize alcohols from alkyl halides, aldehydes, ketones, and alkenes. Grignard hypothesized that the aldehyde or ketone prevented the magnesium from reacting with the alkyl halide, accounting for the low yields. He tested his hypothesis by first adding an alkyl halide and magnesium filings to a solution of anhydrous ether and then adding the aldehyde or ketone. This resulted in a drastic increase in the yield of the reaction.

A couple of years later, Grignard was able to isolate the intermediate. He had heated a mixture of magnesium turnings and isobutyl iodide and added dry ethyl ether to the mixture, observing the reaction. The product is known as a Grignard reagent. Named after him, this organo-magnesium compound (R-MgX) (R = alkyl ; X = Halogen) readily reacts with ketones, aldehydes, and alkenes to produce their respective alcohols in impressive yields. Grignard had discovered the synthetic reaction that now bears his name (the Grignard reaction) in 1900. In 1901, he published his doctoral thesis titled &quot;Thèses sur les combinaisons organomagnesiennes mixtes et leur application à des synthèses d‘acides, d‘alcools et d‘hydrocarbures&quot;. He became a lecturer in organic chemistry at the University of Nancy in 1909, and was promoted to full professor in 1910. In 1912 he and Paul Sabatier (1854–1941) were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. During World War I he studied chemical warfare agents with Georges Urbain at Sorbonne University, particularly the manufacture of phosgene and the detection of mustard gas. In 1918, Grignard discovered that sodium iodide could be used as a battlefield test for mustard gas. Sodium iodide converts mustard gas to diiododiethyl sulfide, which crystallizes more easily than mustard gas. This test could detect as little as 0.01 gram of mustard gas in one cubic meter of air and was successfully used on the battlefield. His counterpart on the German side was another Nobel Prize–winning chemist, Fritz Haber.

Grignard died on 13 December 1935 in Lyon, at the age of 64. By that time, around 6,000 papers reporting applications of the Grignard reaction had been published.

==Grignard reaction==

Grignard is most noted for devising a new method for generating carbon-carbon bonds using magnesium to couple ketones and alkyl halides. This reaction is valuable in organic synthesis. It occurs in two steps:

#Formation of the &quot;Grignard reagent&quot;, which is an organomagnesium compound made by the reaction of an organohalide, R-X (R = alkyl or aryl; and X is a halide, usually bromide or iodide) with magnesium metal. The Grignard reagent is usually described with the general chemical formula R-Mg-X, although its structure is more complex. 
#Addition of the carbonyl, in which a ketone or an aldehyde is added to the solution containing the Grignard reagent. The carbon atom that is bonded to Mg transfers to the carbonyl carbon atom, and the oxygen of the carbonyl carbon becomes attached to the magnesium to give an alkoxide. The process is an example of a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl. After the addition, the reaction mixture is treated with aqueous acid to give an alcohol, and the magnesium salts are subsequently discarded.

== Military service ==
Grignard was drafted into the French military as part of obligatory military service in 1892. Within the two years of his first session of service he rose to the rank of corporal. He was demobilized in 1894 and returned to Lyon to pursue his education. He was awarded a medal of the Legion of Honour and made a Chevalier in 1912 after winning the Nobel Prize. When World War I broke out, Grignard was drafted back into the military, keeping his rank of corporal. He was placed on sentry duty, and served there for several months until he was brought to the attention of the General Staff. Grignard had been wearing his Medal of the Legion of Honour, despite being ordered to take it off by a superior. After looking more into Grignard, the General Staff decided that he would be better suited for research than sentry duty, so they assigned him to the explosives division. Grignard&#x27;s research shifted to antidotes to chemical weapons when production of TNT was no longer sustainable, and eventually Grignard was assigned to research new chemical weapons for the French army.

<text>Keith Payne, (born 30 August 1933) is a retired Australian soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the presence of the enemy&quot; awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Payne&#x27;s VC was awarded for his actions during the Vietnam War. Aged , he is the last living Australian recipient of the original Imperial Victoria Cross.

==Early life==
Keith Payne was born at Ingham, Queensland, on 30 August 1933, the son of Romilda (Millie) Hussey and Henry Thomas Payne. He attended Ingham State School and later became an apprentice cabinet-maker. Dissatisfied with working as a tradesman, Payne joined the Australian Regular Army in August 1951 and, after brief period in the Citizen Military Forces (CMF), was posted to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2RAR) and in the following year transferred to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR). 

==Military career==
Payne served with his unit in the Korean War from April 1952 to March 1953. He married Florence Plaw, a member of the Women&#x27;s Royal Australian Army Corps, in December 1954, and was promoted to corporal the following year. Payne served in Malaya with this unit and in 1965, as a sergeant, he joined the 5th Battalion. In June 1965, by now a warrant officer class II, Payne was a fieldcraft instructor on the staff of the Officer Training Unit, Scheyville, established to commission national servicemen. In February 1967 he was posted to Papua New Guinea, where he served with the 2nd Battalion, Pacific Islands Regiment. He remained there until March 1968 when he returned to Brisbane. On 24 February 1969 he was posted to the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV).

In May 1969 Payne was commanding the 212th Company of the 1st Mobile Strike Force Battalion, when it was attacked by a strong People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam force near Ben Het Camp. The company was isolated and, surrounded on three sides, its Vietnamese troops began to fall back. At this point shrapnel from a grenade burst struck Payne, lodging in his skull, arms and hands; under heavy fire, Payne covered the withdrawal before organising his troops into a defensive perimeter. Disregarding his own serious wounds, he then returned to the battlefield and spent a further three hours, frequently under fire, searching for any remaining members of his unit. Payne located about 40 of his men, most of them wounded; he assisted some of the wounded himself and organised assistance for others, before leading the party back to base through an area now dominated by enemy forces.

Payne&#x27;s actions that night earned him the Victoria Cross (VC), which was gazetted on 19 September 1969. He was evacuated to Brisbane in September suffering from an illness, receiving a warm reception at the airport before entering hospital. In January 1970 Payne was posted to the Royal Military College, Duntroon as an instructor.

Payne received his VC from Queen Elizabeth II aboard the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; in Brisbane on 13 April 1970. He was made a freeman of the city and of the shire in which his hometown was located. A park in Stafford, Brisbane, (where Payne lived) was also named after him. He also received the Distinguished Service Cross and the Silver Star from the United States of America and the Republic of Vietnam awarded Payne the Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Bronze Star.

Payne was later posted to the 42nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment. He retired from the Australian Army in 1975, but saw further action as a captain with the Sultan of Oman&#x27;s Royal Army against communist forces in the Dhofar War in 1975 and 1976.

==Later life==
Payne joined the Legion of Frontiersmen in 1975 and holds the rank of an Honorary Chief Commissioner. After returning to Australia, he became active in the veteran community, particularly in counselling sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Payne and his wife raised five sons and live in Mackay, Queensland. He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for his service to the veteran community in 2006, while Flo Payne was recognised with an OAM for her service to the community, particularly through surf lifesaving and veteran&#x27;s families, in 2011.

Payne was interviewed for the 2006 television docudrama &quot;Victoria Cross Heroes&quot;, which also included archive footage and dramatisations of his actions.

In September 2012 Payne became a Patron of the Victoria Cross Trust. The mental health ward at Greenslopes Private Hospital in Brisbane is named the Keith Payne Unit (KPU), in his honour.

Payne was advanced to a Member of the Order of Australia in June 2015. The award recognised his &quot;significant service to veterans and their families as an ambassador, patron and as an advocate for veterans&#x27; health and welfare&quot;.

Payne is a patron of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy. On 19 September 2022, he attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. He represented recipients of the Victoria Cross at the 2023 Coronation.

<doc id="900394" wikidata="Q266969" url="?curid=900394" title="Frank Fahy (politician)">
<text>Francis Patrick Fahy (23 May 1879 – 12 July 1953) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1932 to 1951. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1919 to his death in 1953.

He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for 35 years, first for Sinn Féin and later as a member of Fianna Fáil, before becoming Ceann Comhairle (chairperson) for over 19 years.

==Early life and revolutionary period==
Fahy was born on 23 May 1879 in the townland of Glanatallin, Kilchreest, County Galway, the eldest of 6 children born to John Fahy and Maria Jones. His father taught at the local National School. After an early education at his father&#x27;s school in Kilchreest, he attended Mungret College in County Limerick. He later studied at University College Galway. He earned a Bachelor of Arts and a H.Dip. in Education, and a Diploma in Science. From 1906 to 1921 he taught Latin, Irish and Science at Castleknock College (St Vincent&#x27;s College), Dublin. Fahy qualified as a barrister in 1927 at King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin and also taught at the Christian Brothers school in Tralee. He was at one time General Secretary of the Conradh na Gaeilge. He married Anna Barton of Tralee, a metal artist and member of the Cumann na mBan in 1908. They had no children.

As Company Captain of C Company, 1 Battalion, Dublin Brigade, Irish Volunteers, Fahy commanded the contingent that occupied the Four Courts during the 1916 rising. Arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison, he spent terms in several British jails. Released in the general amnesty of June 1917, he was active in the reorganisation of the Volunteer movement, addressing public meetings throughout the country. Fahy later applied to the Irish government for a service pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934 and was awarded 5 and 1/6 years service in 1937 at Grade D for his service with the Irish Volunteers from 23 April 1916 to June 1917.

==Political career==

Fahy was first elected at the 1918 general election as a Sinn Féin Member of Parliament (MP) for Galway South, but as the party was pledged to abstentionism he did not take his seat in the British House of Commons and joined the revolutionary First Dáil. He was re-elected as TD for Galway in 1921 general election and having sided with the anti-treaty forces following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, he did not take his seat in either the 3rd Dáil or the 4th Dáil. Referring to the treaty, in 1922 Fahy said: &quot;Can a Treaty based on fear, naked and unashamed, be a sound basis for friendship between the two peoples?&quot; 

He joined Fianna Fáil when the party was founded in 1926, and along with the 42 other Fianna Fáil TDs he took his seat in the 5th Dáil on 12 August 1927, three days before the Dáil tied 71 votes to 71 on a motion of no confidence in W. T. Cosgrave&#x27;s Cumann na nGaedheal government (a tie broken by the Ceann Comhairle). After the government won two by-elections later that month, it dissolved the Dáil, leading to a fresh election.

After the September 1927 election, Cosgrave was able to form a minority government with the support of the Farmers&#x27; Party and some independent TDs. However, in the 1932 general election, Fianna Fáil won just under half of the seats and formed a government with the support of the Labour Party. The first business was of the 7th Dáil was the election of the Ceann Comhairle, and on 9 March 1932 Fahy was nominated for the position by Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly, winning the vote by a margin of 78 to 71.

He held the post until Fianna Fáil lost the 1951 election, and at the start of the 14th Dáil he did not offer himself for re-election as Ceann Comhairle. He was succeeded by the Labour TD Patrick Hogan. His 19 years in the chair remains the longest of any Ceann Comhairle, with the only other person to exceed 10 years as Ceann Comhairle being his successor, Patrick Hogan.

The 1932 election was the last which Fahy contested; as Ceann Comhairle, he was automatically re-elected at the next seven elections. When his Galway constituency was divided for the 1937 general election, he was returned unopposed for the new Galway East, and similarly in 1948 for the new Galway South constituency.

Fahy died on 12 July 1953, and is buried at Deans Grange Cemetery, Dublin. The Galway South by-election held after his death was won by the Fianna Fáil candidate Robert Lahiffe.

<text>Mangotsfield is a village and former civil parish in the unitary authority area of South Gloucestershire, in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire, England, to the north-east of Bristol.

The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 as &quot;Manegodesfelle&quot;, and as &quot;Manegodesfeld&quot; in 1377.

Between 1845 and 1966 the village was served by Mangotsfield railway station.

== Parish ==
Until the 19th century Mangotsfield was the principal settlement in a large ancient parish, which also included the hamlets of Downend and Staple Hill to the west of the village, and Emersons Green, Vinny Green, Blackhorse and Moorend to the north. The parish became the civil parish of Mangotsfield in 1866.

In the early 20th century Downend and Staple Hill were developed into suburbs of Bristol and outgrew the village of Mangotsfield. In 1921 the parish had a population of 10,720. In 1927 the civil parish was abolished and divided into two. Downend, Staple Hill and Mangotsfield village became Mangotsfield Urban District (and the civil parish of Mangotsfield Urban), and the rural eastern parts of the parish became the new civil parish of Mangotsfield Rural. Mangotsfield Urban District was itself abolished in 1974 and became part of Kingswood Borough in the new county of Avon. When Avon was abolished in 1996 the whole of Kingswood Borough joined South Gloucestershire. The civil parish of Mangotsfield Rural continued until 2015, when it was renamed Emersons Green.

== Church ==
The parish church of St James dates from the 13th century, but was rebuilt and altered in the 19th century. It is a Grade II* listed building.

==Sport and leisure==
Mangotsfield is the home of Mangotsfield United F.C. and Cleve R.F.C.
Rodway Hill is a favourite spot for dog walkers and the starting point of many pigeon races.

==Education and schools==
There is one secondary school in Mangotsfield: Mangotsfield School (A Specialist College in Engineering and Science).

<text>Dame Elizabeth Posthuma Simcoe (22 September 1762 – 17 January 1850) was an English artist and diarist in colonial Canada. Her husband, John Graves Simcoe, was the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. Her diary gives an account of Canadian life.

==Biography==
She was born Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim to Lt Col. Thomas Gwillim and Elizabeth Spinckes in the village of Aldwincle, Northamptonshire, England. Her father died before her birth and her mother shortly afterwards. After her baptism, on the same day as her mother&#x27;s burial, she was taken into the care of her mother&#x27;s younger sister, Margaret. In commemoration of her posthumous birth, Elizabeth was given the middle name Posthuma. Her aunt and adoptive mother, Margaret, married Admiral Samuel Graves on 14 June 1769 and Elizabeth grew up at Graves&#x27;s estate, Hembury Fort near Honiton in Devon. Gwillim was one of a group of friends that included Mary Anne Burges in Honiton.
On 30 December 1782, Elizabeth married John Graves Simcoe, Admiral Graves&#x27;s godson. Between the years 1784 and 1804, they had eleven children, among them Francis Simcoe, after whom they named Castle Frank. Nine survived to adulthood; Katherine, their only child to be born in Upper Canada, and John Cornwall Simcoe died in infancy. Katherine is buried at Fort York Garrison. 

Elizabeth was a wealthy heiress, who acquired a 5,000-acre (2025 ha) estate near Honiton, Devon, and built Wolford Lodge, which remained the Simcoe family seat until 1923. She is buried at Wolford Chapel.

==Legacy==
Elizabeth Simcoe&#x27;s diary provides a valuable impression of life in colonial Ontario. First published in 1911, there was a subsequent transcription published in 1965 and a paperback version at the turn of the 21st century, over 200 years after she wrote it. She also left a series of 595 watercolours that depict the town of York, Upper Canada. She proposed the naming of Scarborough Township, an eastern Toronto district, after Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The townships of North, East and West Gwillimbury, just south of Lake Simcoe, Ontario, are also named after her family. The Township of Whitchurch, today the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville, Ontario, honours her ancestral home, Whitchurch, Herefordshire.

In December 2007, a statue of Elizabeth Gwillim Simcoe was raised in the town of Bradford West Gwillimbury, when it commemorated the 150th anniversary of its incorporation. The statue stands in a small park in front of the Bradford post office, at the corner of John Street West and Barrie Street.

<text>Super Sprint (known as Sprint Master on the Atari 2600) is a racing video game released by Atari Games and Midway Games in 1986. Up to three players drive Formula One-like cars on a circuit that is viewed from above. The game is a successor to &quot;Gran Trak 10&quot; and the &quot;Sprint&quot; series, which were black-and-white games from the 1970s. A sequel, Championship Sprint, was released later in the same year.

==Gameplay==

Up to three players drive simultaneously on a circuit against opponents controlled by the computer. The circuits are viewed from above and always fit on the screen, so the game never scrolls. After three laps the winner advances to the next circuit. There are eight circuits in total, but the game only ends if gamers can get to race 85 where the bonus Super Speedway circuit is played. As the player goes to higher levels, more and more obstacles appear on the track, like oil puddles and tiny moving tornadoes. If the car touches them, the player loses control over the car for a short time while it is sliding and spinning. Driving into a wall with high speed or falling from one of the bridges destroys the car, but a helicopter will appear to replace it.

The car can be customized by collecting wrenches that lie on the track. The player can exchange three of them for improved traction, better acceleration or higher top speed.

==Ports==

&quot;Super Sprint&quot; was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. An unlicensed port was released by Tengen, a subsidiary of Atari, for the Nintendo Entertainment System and it was adapted by the Japanese company Altron as a licensed title for the Japanese market.

The game was ported to the Atari 2600 under the name &quot;Sprint Master&quot;, the adaptation was released in 1988.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Super Sprint&quot; on their August 15, 1986, issue as being the second most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month. It became Japan&#x27;s eighth highest-grossing upright/cockpit arcade game during the latter half of 1986, and the ninth highest-grossing upright/cockpit arcade game of 1986. It was later Japan&#x27;s tenth highest-grossing upright/cockpit arcade game of 1987.

In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the arcade version as number 59 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. They explained that while the massive understeer in the game is highly unrealistic, it adds a sense of urgency to the gameplay.
==&quot;Championship Sprint&quot;==

Later in 1986 &quot;Championship Sprint&quot; was released; it is almost identical, but with different tracks, and with a standard-size two-player cabinet instead of Super Sprint&#x27;s wide 3P cabinet. It was ported to the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64.

==Legacy==
===Re-releases===
A Game Boy Advance version was released along with &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; in a dual-game pack in 2005.

&quot;Super Sprint&quot; is included in the compilation &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot; for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows. Its sequel, &quot;Championship Sprint&quot;, was released for the same systems in &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot;, and as a downloadable game for the PlayStation 3. Both games are also part of the 2012 compilation &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

In 2016, &quot;Super Sprint&quot; was re-released in the &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; Midway Arcade Level Pack.

<text>Croydon Road Recreation Ground is a public park in Beckenham in the London Borough of Bromley. It is near the High St and adjacent to Beckenham Beacon. The park features a café and bandstand, as well as a bowling green and other sports facilities. The park was laid out by the Sydenham firm Reid and Bornemann in 1890 and was formally opened on 23 September 1891.

The UK&#x27;s first manned airmail flight left from here in 1902, travelling to Calais by hot air balloon The event was held to celebrate the coronation of King Edward VII. The crew were A E Gaudron, a French balloonist and Dr. Barton, a local medical practitioner. Mail was dropped at three points in Kent before the balloon itself then crossed the Channel before landing near Calais.

On 16 August 1969 David Bowie helped organise and played at the Growth Summer Festival a one-day festival that played from the bandstand in the park. Now known as the Bowie Bandstand, it was built by the McCallum and Hope Iron Foundry of Glasgow and erected in 1905. It was listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England in 2019 as a &quot;rare and substantial example of cast-iron work&quot; by the McCallum and Hope Iron Foundry, and for its association with Bowie. On 15 September 2013, the park hosted a &quot;Memory of a Free Festival&quot; event, commemorating the 1969 festival.

<text>Wanderer was a German manufacturer of bicycles, motorcycles, automobiles, vans and other machinery. Established as &quot;Winklhofer &amp; Jaenicke&quot; in 1896 by Johann Baptist Winklhofer and Richard Adolf Jaenicke, the company used the &quot;Wanderer&quot; brand name from 1911, making civilian automobiles until 1941 and military vehicles until 1945.

Wanderer was last active as a financial holding company without its own business operations and went bankrupt in July 2010. The brand was then acquired by Cologne-based manufacturer Zweirad Einkaufs Genossenschaft (ZEG).

==History to 1945==


&quot;Winklhofer &amp; Jaenicke&quot; was established in 1896 in Chemnitz. It built motorcycles from 1902 and automobiles from 1903. The &quot;Wanderer&quot; brand was chosen in 1911 for overseas exports and was soon adopted for domestic sales.

The first two- or three-seater models used four-cylinder 1145 cc and 1220 cc engines. The 1220 cc model lasted until 1925. The first six-cylinder model appeared in 1928. By 1926, when Wanderer introduced a successful &quot;Typ&quot; 10, the company was making 25 vehicles a day; parts were made at the old plant in Chemnitz and assembled at the 1927 built new site in Siegmar, delivered by rail right to the assembly line. Motorcycle production continued in Chemnitz alone.

During the Great Depression, in 1929, the company owner, Dresdner Bank, sold the motorcycle business to František Janeček, and in 1932 divested the rest of Wanderer. The car division with its Siegmar factory became part of Auto Union together with Horch, Audi and DKW. In this quartet, Horch was positioned as the luxury brand, DKW and Slaby-Beringer built cheap two-stroke cars, and Audi and Wanderer competed in the Middle class and Upper Middle class segments the same way GM&#x27;s Buick and Oldsmobile divisions were used, technologically advanced small cars (the heaviest, 6-cylinder Wanderers reached 1.5 tons dry weight). Wanderers of the Nazi period acquired a trademark radiator design, shaped as a heraldic shield.

The next model W17 7/35 PS was propelled by a new 1692 cc OHV four-cylinder engine developed by Ferdinand Porsche. In 1933 the new Audi Front was equipped with the Wanderer W22 engine, a 1950 cc OHV six-cylinder, also a Porsche design. The top model from 1936 to 1939 was the W50, propelled by a 2257 cc six-cylinder engine. From 1937 on there were also sporting fours (W24 and W25) and another six-cylinder model of 2632 cc (W23), propelled by new Flathead engines constructed by Auto Union itself. Wanderer cars were always admired for their high quality and sporting character. 

During World War II, all civilian production was replaced in 1941 with licence-built military vehicles, such as Steyr 1500A light truck. A subcamp of Flossenbürg concentration camp, KZ Siegmar-Schonau, was operated during the war to provide slave labour for the Wanderer vehicle plants. From 1943 on the Auto Union Siegmar plant produced Maybach HL230 V12 engines, used in many heavy tanks of the German Wehrmacht.

The Wanderer Siegmar plant (now Chemnitz) of Auto Union was destroyed in early 1945, closing this chapter in the history of automobiles. Post-war efforts to restore East German auto industry concentrated on Auto Union facilities in Zwickau and Zschopau: Wanderer car production never recovered, with Auto Union relocating to Ingolstadt, West Germany, where the company was rebuilt based using the DKW and, ultimately, the Audi brand.

== History after 1945 ==
Following the end of World War II, a referendum on 30 June 1946 saw the expropriation of war and Nazi criminals by the occupying Soviet forces. This resulted in both the Wanderer works company and Auto Union enterprises being partially dismantled and their assets taken as reparations to the Soviet Union by 1948. This gave way to the rearrangement of state-owned enterprises (VEB): 

* the car factory in Siegmar was allocated as part of the Vehicle Construction Industry Association (IFA) and was later part of the VEB Barkas-Werke (which is now the VW engine factory in Chemnitz). 
* Meanwhile, the machine tool area initially continued as VEB Wanderer-Fräsmaschinenbau was changed to VEB Fritz-Heckert-Werk in 1951. It later became the parent company of the VEB machine tool combine ‘Fritz-Heckert’ (now the Starrag Group). 
* The office machine business in Schönau was reorganised as VEB Wanderer-Continental office machine works, under the umbrella of VVB Mechanik. It was then merged with the former Astrawerke AG and formed as VEB Büromaschinen Chemnitz in 1953, but two years later spun off again as VEB Industriewerke Karl-Marx-Stadt and commissioned with the production of aircraft engines. The production of typewriters passed to the Optima office machine factory in Erfurt, whilst calculators and booking machines were further developed and created in the VEB booking machine factory in Karl-Marx-Stadt (formerly known as the Astrawerke). Following the suspension of the GDR&#x27;s own aircraft construction in 1961, hydraulic pumps and vehicle engines were manufactured in the industrial plant. A small part of it managed to remain after the reunification as Sachsenhydraulik GmbH, before eventually being passed to the US company Parker-Hannifin.

<doc id="900439" wikidata="Q409150" url="?curid=900439" title="Psilocin">
<text>Psilocin, also known as 4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (4-OH-DMT), is a substituted tryptamine alkaloid and a serotonergic psychedelic. It is present in most psychedelic mushrooms together with its phosphorylated counterpart psilocybin. Psilocybin, as well as synthetic esters such as 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin; &quot;O&quot;-acetylpsilocin) and 4-PrO-DMT (&quot;O&quot;-propionylpsilocin), are prodrugs of psilocin.

Acting on the serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, psilocin&#x27;s psychedelic effects are directly correlated with the drug&#x27;s occupancy at these receptor sites. The subjective mind-altering effects of psilocin are highly variable and are said to resemble those of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

Psilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

==Effects==
The effects observed after ingestion of psilocin can include but are not limited to tachycardia, dilated pupils, restlessness or arousal, euphoria, open and closed eye visuals (common at medium to high doses), synesthesia (e.g. hearing colours and seeing sounds), increased body temperature, headache, sweating and chills, and nausea. Psilocin acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT1A receptor agonist or partial agonist. Such receptors are claimed to significantly regulate visual processing, decision making, mood, blood pressure, and heart rate.

There has been no direct lethality associated with psilocin. There has been no reported withdrawal syndrome when chronic use of this drug is ceased. There is cross tolerance among psilocin, mescaline, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and other psychedelics due to downregulation of these receptors.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Psilocin is the pharmacologically active agent in the body after ingestion of psilocybin or some species of psychedelic mushrooms. Psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated in the body to psilocin which acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptor agonist or partial agonist. Psilocin exhibits functional selectivity in that it activates phospholipase A2 instead of activating phospholipase C as the endogenous ligand serotonin does. Psilocin is structurally similar to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), differing only by the hydroxyl group being on the 4-position rather than the 5 and the dimethyl groups on the nitrogen. Its effects are thought to come from its agonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Psilocin has no significant effect on dopamine receptors (unlike lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)) and only affects the noradrenergic system at very high doses.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Psilocin&#x27;s elimination half-life ranges from 1 to 3hours depending on route of administration of psilocybin.

==Chemistry==
Psilocin and its phosphorylated cousin, psilocybin, were first isolated and named in 1958 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann. Hofmann obtained the chemicals from laboratory-grown specimens of the entheogenic mushroom &quot;Psilocybe mexicana&quot;. Hofmann also succeeded in finding synthetic routes to these chemicals.

Psilocin can be obtained by dephosphorylation of natural psilocybin under strongly acidic or under alkaline conditions (hydrolysis). A synthetic route uses the Speeter–Anthony tryptamine synthesis procedure. First, 4-hydroxyindole is Friedel-Crafts-acylated with oxalyl chloride in position 3. The compound is further reacted with dimethylamine, yielding the indole-3-yl-glyoxamide. Finally, this 4-hydroxyindole-3-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylglyoxamide is reduced by lithium aluminum hydride yielding psilocin. 

Psilocin is relatively unstable in solution due to its phenolic hydroxy (-OH) group. In the presence of oxygen, it readily forms bluish and dark black degradation products. Similar products are also formed in the presence of oxygen and Fe3+ ions.

===Analogues===
Sulfur analogs are known with a benzothienyl replacement as well as 4-SH-DMT. 1-Methylpsilocin is a functionally 5-HT2C receptor preferring agonist. 4-Fluoro-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine is known. 4-AcO-DMT is the ester of acetic acid with psilocin. Additionally, replacement of a methyl group at the dimethylated nitrogen with an isopropyl or ethyl group yields 4-HO-MiPT (4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-isopropyltryptamine; Miprocin) and 4-HO-MET (4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-ethyltryptamine; metocin), respectively. 4-Acetoxy-MET (4-acetoxy-&quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-ethyltryptamine), also known as 4-AcO-MET, is the acetate ester of 4-HO-MET, and a homologue of 4-AcO-DMT. Another analogue of psilocin is O-4310.

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) requires its members to prohibit psilocybin, and parties to the treaty are required to restrict the use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions.

====Australia====
Psilocin is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

====Russia====
Psilocin and psilocybin are banned in Russia, due to their status as narcotic drugs, with a criminal penalty for possession of more than 50mg.

==Research==
Psilocin is being evaluated under the developmental code name PLZ-1015 for the treatment of pervasive developmental disorders like autism in children. Its prodrug psilocybin is also being studied for treatment of depression and a variety of other conditions.

<doc id="900448" wikidata="Q320800" url="?curid=900448" title="Samuel Graves">
<text>Admiral Samuel Graves (17 April 1713 – 8 March 1787) was a British Royal Navy admiral who is probably best known for his role early in the American Revolutionary War.

== Ancestry ==
He is thought to have been born in Castledawson, Ireland. His grandfather Captain James Graves (1654–1689) was murdered in his bed and robbed of his regiment&#x27;s wages. Samuel Graves was born the youngest son and presumably second youngest child of Captain Graves&#x27; son Samuel Graves (1674–1727) and his wife Jane Moore. He had three older brothers and a sister.

By joining the Royal Navy, he followed in the footsteps of his uncle Thomas Graves, whose son Thomas Graves is most well known for having commanded the British fleet at the Battle of the Chesapeake during the American War of Independence. Another Thomas Graves, a nephew to Samuel Graves, was knighted following the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801, where he had served as Horatio Nelson&#x27;s second-in-command. A number of Graves&#x27; served in the Royal Navy during the 18th and early 19th centuries.

== Military career ==
Graves joined the Royal Navy in 1732. Made lieutenant in 1739, he participated in the 1741 expedition against Cartagena, serving on the frigate &quot;Norfolk&quot;, under his uncle and future admiral, Captain Thomas Graves. Samuel Graves&#x27;s cousin Thomas, Captain Graves&#x27;s son and also future admiral, served alongside him on the third-rate ship-of-the-line &quot;Norfolk&quot;. Promoted to command of the sloop &quot;Bonetta&quot; in 1743, Graves served in the West Indies until 1747, commanding &quot;Ripon&#x27;s Prize&quot;, and, later, &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

In 1756 Graves rose to command &quot;Duke&quot;. Two years later, Graves returned to the command of &quot;Duke&quot;, serving again under Hawke in the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. He continued in command of &quot;Duke&quot; until his promotion to rear admiral in October 1762.

That same year, Graves faced several lawsuits when the conduct of a press-gang sent out by him was deemed excessively brutal by the townspeople of Bristol. Seeing as a by-election was held at the same time, the local Tories suspected him to have purposefully and unlawfully impressed eligible voters in order to influence the election on behalf of the Whigs.

=== American Revolutionary War ===
In October 1770 Graves rose to vice admiral, and in July 1774 assumed command of the North American Station. Graves&#x27;s orders were vague, his resources overstretched, and his task, in the words of the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, &quot;perhaps the most ungracious duty that has ever fallen to the lot of a naval officer.&quot; According to his instructions, Graves was charged with supporting customs officials enforcing the various revenue and trade acts governing North American colonial trade within the empire, especially the Boston Port Act. With only 26 ships and over one-thousand miles of coastline from Nova Scotia to Florida to patrol, Graves&#x27;s task was Sisyphean.

Manning problems made the Royal Navy&#x27;s problems even more acute, thus forcing it to resort to press gangs in order to supplement the ships&#x27; slender crews. Compounding the problem was the attitude and behavior of navy officers who did not recognize local authority and were more often contemptuous of local officials and sensitivities.

Headquartered in Boston, Graves was at the center of the Revolutionary turmoil in New England. His sailors manned the boats that ferried British soldiers across the Charles River en route to Concord on the night of 18 April 1775. Two months later, on 17 June 1775, his sailors again helped ferry troops, this time to the Charlestown Peninsula, while several of his ships provided fire support for the pyrrhic victory at Bunker Hill. During the Siege of Boston, Admiral Graves, on 6 October 1775, ordered Lieutenant Henry Mowatt, commanding the armed vessel , to destroy seaports that were supporting the rebellion. Mowatt burned Falmouth (today&#x27;s Portland, Maine) on 18 October.

Graves&#x27; position in Boston was tenuous; his relationship with General Gage was characterised by a strong mutual dislike which at the time was rumoured to at least partially result from a dispute between their wives Margaret Graves and Margaret Kemble Gage, who reportedly had fallen out over the question whether dancing should be allowed at a card-party or not. The trifling nature of their dispute aside, both women were staunch partisans of their husbands to the point that contemporaries mused both were &quot;led&quot;, and thus presumably influenced in their capacities as military commanders, by their wives.

Shortly before the Burning of Falmouth, in August 1775, Graves was involved in a public fistfight with Commissioner of Customs Benjamin Hallowell, the climax of an ongoing dispute between the two concerning the hay to be harvested on a small island off Boston. There are at least two accounts of the affair, one written by Hallowell himself addressed to General Gage and one by an anonymous eyewitness, published in a British newspaper. According to the eyewitness&#x27; account, Hallowell confronted Graves on the street, demanding to know why the latter had not replied to his letters. From there, the situation escalated fairly quickly. Despite being a good deal older than Hallowell, Graves apparently beat Hallowell so badly, bystanders interceded to separate the two men in order to prevent any more serious harm from being done. This episode supported Graves&#x27; image as &quot;somewhat severe, of few words, and rough in his manner&quot;, inspired satirical poetry and brought him into further disrepute as some of his nephews took it upon themselves to punish Hallowell for having assailed their uncle by subjecting him to a beating and challenging him to a duel.

On 27 January 1776, Molyneux Shuldham succeeded Graves as commander-in-chief of the North American station. Graves returned to England without a command. In September 1777 he declined command of Plymouth, but indicated a desire to return to active duty. Graves advanced to admiral of the blue on 29 January 1778, admiral of the white on 8 April 1782, and died at his estate near Hembury Fort, Honiton, Devon on 8 March 1787. He is buried in Dunkeswell in Devon with a monument designed by &quot;Miss Burgess&quot; and sculpted by John Bacon.

== Family ==
Graves settled at Hembury Fort House in Devon. His first marriage was to Elizabeth Sedgwick (1729–1767), daughter of John Sedgwick of Staindrop in County Durham on 19 June 1750 in the parish of St. George, Hanover Square.

Two years after Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1767, he married Margaret Spinckes (1728-1808) in All Saints&#x27; Church in Aldwincle, Northamptonshire on 14 June 1769.

Both marriages remained childless. Through his second wife however, he became involved in raising the latter&#x27;s orphaned niece Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim, who became like his own daughter to him.
Graves showed particular interest in two of his nephews, Richard (his godson) and Thomas Graves. He also played an influential part in the life of another godson, John Graves Simcoe. When Simcoe, who had fought in the American War of Independence, was invalided back to England on account of his precarious health, Graves offered his godson to convalesce at Hembury Fort House for a while where he met Graves&#x27; ward Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim. The young couple married on 30 December 1782 in St. Mary and St. Giles Church, Buckerell with Samuel and Margaret Graves (godfather to the groom and godmother to the bride respectively) as witnesses.

A monument sculpted by John Bacon but designed by a &quot;Miss Burgess&quot; was erected in Buckerell in his memory. &quot;Miss Burgess&quot; was most likely Mary Anne Burges, best friend to Samuel Graves&#x27; ward Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim, who was close with her friends&#x27; aunt and uncle through being a frequent visitor to Hembury Fort House. The epitaph inscribed on the aforementioned monument also refers to Graves&#x27; charitable efforts, which awarded him the local epithet &quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s Friend&quot;.

<doc id="900453" wikidata="Q2742577" url="?curid=900453" title="General Order No. 11 (1862)">
<text>General Order No. 11 was a Union Army order issued by Major-General Ulysses S. Grant on December 17, 1862, during the Vicksburg campaign of the American Civil War. The order expelled all Jews from Grant&#x27;s military district, comprising areas of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky. Grant issued the order in an effort to reduce corruption among Union Army personnel and stop the illicit trade in Southern-produced cotton, which he perceived as being run &quot;mostly by Jews and other unprincipled traders&quot;. During the war, the Lincoln administration had authorized licensed traders to do business with the Union Army, which created a market for unlicensed ones. Union Army commanders in the South were responsible for administering the trade licenses and trying to control the black market in Southern cotton, in addition to their regular military duties.

At Holly Springs, Mississippi, the supply depot of Grant&#x27;s troops, Jews were rounded up and forced to leave the city on foot. On December 20, 1862, three days after Grant&#x27;s order, Confederate States Army troops led by Major-General Earl Van Dorn raided Holly Springs, preventing the potential expulsion of further Jews. Although delayed by Van Dorn&#x27;s raid, Grant&#x27;s order was fully implemented in Paducah, Kentucky, where thirty Jewish families were forcibly expelled from the city. Jewish community leaders protested, and there was an outcry from members of the United States Congress and media outlets to the order; President Abraham Lincoln responded by countermanding it on January 4, 1863. Grant claimed during his 1868 presidential campaign that he had not issued the order due to any antisemitism but as a way to address a problem that &quot;certain Jews had caused&quot;. Nevertheless, he expressed regret for his decision. Historians and Grant biographers have generally been critical of the order.

==Background==
===Military operations===

On November 2, 1862, Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant, launched an aggressive Civil War campaign to take the Confederate citadel of Vicksburg, Mississippi. On November 13, Grant&#x27;s cavalry had advanced on and captured Holly Springs, Mississippi, and set up an advanced supply station. On December 1, Grant&#x27;s cavalry continued to move South, crossed the Tallahatchie River, and captured Oxford, Mississippi. On December 8, Grant informed Henry Halleck, his commanding general, of his military convergence plan to advance on Vicksburg overland, while Union Major General William T. Sherman would advance on Vicksburg from the Mississippi River. The Confederate commander of Vicksburg was General John C. Pemberton, who was stationed at Jackson, Mississippi, that was a distance of 45 miles from Vicksburg. Grant&#x27;s own Union military advance was made vulnerable to Confederate attack by a 190 mile railroad supply line.

Grant&#x27;s plan to capture Vicksburg by a joint-venture with Sherman&#x27;s Army was thwarted by two Confederate raids. On December 10, 1862, breaking from Confederate General Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Army, Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest began a series of raids that disrupted Union positions. Forrest destroyed Grant&#x27;s rail and telegraphic communications, and inflicted 1,500 casualties on the Union Army. Grant&#x27;s northern communications were cut off from Jackson, Tennessee to Columbus, Kentucky. On December 20, Confederate General Earl Van Dorn raided Union supply station at Holly Springs destroying &quot;shops, depots, and warehouses.&quot; Grant was defeated, extended into enemy territory, and forced to withdraw to Tennessee, his army foraging the land. On December 29, Sherman&#x27;s assault on Vicksburg at Chickasaw Bayou was repulsed by Pemberton.

===Refugee cotton labor===
While Grant prepared to attack Pemberton&#x27;s Confederate army, his army was flooded by fugitive slaves, considered contrabands by the federal government. In early November, Grant initiated a labor camp system where former refugee slaves would pick cotton, shipped north, to aid the Union War effort. Grant ordered Chaplain John Eaton to take charge of the contrabands. In return the black refugees would be protected by the army and the profits from the sale of cotton would be given to the black workers to &quot;compensate for food, clothing, and shelter.&quot; Grant believed the labor camp system would &quot;make the Negro a consciously self-supporting unit...and start him on the way to self-respecting citizenship.&quot; In November 1862, the first labor camp was established at Grand Junction. The Lincoln administration authorized Grant&#x27;s program five days later. In December, Eaton was appointed by Grant to be superintendent of contrabands. African American common-law marriages were legalized. On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, that expanded the war, to end slavery in the rebelling states.

===Cotton, illegal trade, smuggling ===

While Grant&#x27;s Army marched deeper into the Confederate South, enemy territory, as far as Oxford, Mississippi, northern traders followed, to profiteer in the cotton trade, driven by the North&#x27;s &quot;consuming need&quot; for the highly sought after product, used to make Union tents. The Union naval blockade forced Southern cotton planters to find alternatives to exporting their product. Extensive cotton trade continued between the North and South. Northern textile mills in New York and New England were dependent on Southern cotton, while Southern plantation owners depended on the trade with the North for their economic survival. The U.S. Government permitted limited trade, licensed by the Treasury and the U.S. Army. Corruption flourished as unlicensed traders bribed Army officers to allow them to buy Southern cotton without a permit. Jewish traders were among those involved in the cotton trade; some merchants had been active in the cotton business for generations in the South; others were more recent immigrants to the North.

Grant received contradictory information from Washington. The Treasury Department wanted to restore trade with the South, while the War Department believed profiteering from the sale of cotton aided the Confederacy and prolonged the war. Traders were allowed permits as long as the traders did not cross into Confederate held territory. Grant found this difficult to enforce, while he tried to stop cotton traders, including Jewish traders, from moving south with his army.

The practice of cotton smuggling infuriated Grant. Criticism of Jewish traders spread throughout the Union Army, although non-Jewish traders&#x27; involvement with illicit trade was rampant. Jewish traders were singled out and called &quot;sharks&quot; who fed upon soldiers. As part of his command, Grant was responsible for issuing trade licenses in the Department of Tennessee, an administrative district of the Union Army that comprised the portions of Kentucky and Tennessee west of the Tennessee River, and Union-controlled areas of northern Mississippi. Grant resented having to deal with the distraction of the cotton trade. He perceived it as having endemic corruption: the highly lucrative trade resulted in a system where &quot;every colonel, captain or quartermaster ... [was] in a secret partnership with some operator in cotton.&quot; He issued a number of directives aimed at black marketeers.

=== Escalating hostility===

On November 9, 1862, Grant sent an order to Major-General Stephen A. Hurlbut: &quot;Refuse all permits to come south of Jackson for the present. The Israelites especially should be kept out.&quot; The following day he instructed Colonel Joseph Dana Webster: &quot;Give orders to all the conductors on the [rail]road that no Jews are to be permitted to travel on the railroad southward from any point. They may go north and be encouraged in it; but they are such an intolerable nuisance that the department must be purged of them.&quot; In a letter to General William Tecumseh Sherman, Grant wrote that his policy was occasioned &quot;in consequence of the total disregard and evasion of orders by Jews.&quot;

Grant explained his anti-Jewish policy to the War Department. Grant said that Treasury Department regulations were violated: &quot;mostly by Jews and other unprincipled traders&quot;. In reference to Jewish traders Grant said: &quot;they come in with their carpet sacks in spite of all that can be done to prevent it. The Jews seem to be a privileged class that can travel anywhere. They will land at any wood yard or landing on the river and make their way through the country. If not permitted to buy cotton themselves they will act as agents for someone else who will be at a military post with a Treasury permit to receive cotton and pay for it in Treasury notes, which the Jew will buy up at an agreed rate, paying gold.&quot; Grant proposed that the federal government &quot;to buy all the cotton at a fixed rate and send it to Cairo, St. Louis or some other point to be sold. Then all traders---they are a curse to the Army---might be expelled.&quot;

Grant and the cotton trade took on a more personal tone when his father Jesse Grant, and the Mack brothers, Jewish clothing contractors, visited Grant at his Southern base of Oxford. Jesse and Grant got along well with each other for a couple of days. Grant also treated his Jewish guests respectfully. The Mack brothers needed cotton to make Union army uniforms. Jesse Grant had been promised by the Mack brothers to receive a quarter of the profits, after Jesse had gotten his son Grant to bestow permits to buy cotton, and then be shipped to New York. When Grant found out about the business agreement between Jesse and the Mack brothers, Grant was livid. Grant abruptly sent Jesse and the Mack brothers packing north on the next train. Grant may have felt betrayed to find out his own father was involved in the cotton trade that he despised.

At the start of December 1862, Grant focused on Jewish traders as the primary cause of smuggling. On December 5, Grant told Sherman that &quot;in consequence of the total disregard and evasion of orders by the Jews my policy is to exclude them so far as practicable from the Dept.&quot; Grant tightened restrictions to try to reduce the illegal trade. On December 8, 1862, he issued General Order No. 2, mandating that &quot;cotton-speculators, Jews and other Vagrants having not honest means of support, except trading upon the miseries of their Country ... will leave in twenty-four hours or they will be sent to duty in the trenches.&quot; As the days went by, Grant&#x27;s anger mounted. Grant was not satisfied only with punishing Jewish traders, he desired to expel all Jewish people from his district.

==Issue of the order==
On December 17, 1862, Grant was angered when he had received complaints by mail concerning Jewish traders in his department. The same hour, Grant issued General Order No. 11, expelling &quot;Jews, as a class&quot; to strengthen his earlier prohibition. Jewish persons who did not obey the order were to be arrested and forcibly removed as prisoners. John Rawlins, Grant&#x27;s lawyer and Asst. Adjt. Gen., strongly warned Grant not to issue the order. Grant refused to take Rawlin&#x27;s advice concerning the order and told him: &quot;Well, they can countermand this from Washington if they like, but we will issue it anyhow.&quot;

===Text===
===Letter to Wolcott===
In a letter of the same date sent to Christopher Wolcott, the United States Assistant Secretary of War, Grant explained his reasoning:
==Enforcement==
Immediately after the order was issued, Jews at Holly Springs, Grant&#x27;s supply depot, were rounded up and forcibly removed. Some Jewish traders were forced to evacuate the area forty miles on foot. Seventy-two hours after Grant&#x27;s order was issued, Holly Springs was raided by Confederate Major General Earl Van Dorn and his army of 3,500 Confederate troops. Union communication lines were broken for weeks, that resulted in many other Jews being spared from potential removal, and delayed full enforcement of Grant&#x27;s order.

On December 28, Grant&#x27;s order was fully enforced at Paducah. Thirty Jewish families, shell-shocked and roughly treated, were ordered to leave Paducah within twenty-four hours. Jewish families in Paducah were forced to collect their personal belongings, shutter their homes and shops, and board a steamer on the Ohio River. One Jewish resident of Paducah, Cesar Kaskel, a Union loyalist and president of the Paducah Union League Club, was summoned to Paducah&#x27;s provost marshal, L.J. Waddell, and ordered by Waddell to leave the city. 

===Jewish resistance===
A group of Jewish merchants who were expelled from Paducah, Kentucky, led by Cesar Kaskel, sent a telegram to President Abraham Lincoln in which they condemned Grant&#x27;s General Order No. 11 as &quot;the grossest violation of the Constitution and our rights as good citizens under it&quot;. The telegram noted it would &quot;place us ... as outlaws before the world. We respectfully ask your immediate attention to this enormous outrage on all law and humanity ...&quot; Throughout the Union, Jewish groups protested and sent telegrams to the government in Washington, D.C.

Kaskel led a delegation to Washington, D.C., arriving on January 3, 1863. In Washington, he conferred with Jewish Republican Adolphus Solomons and a Cincinnati congressman, John A. Gurley. After meeting with Gurley, he went directly to the White House. Lincoln received the delegation and studied Kaskel&#x27;s copies of General Order No. 11 and the specific order expelling Kaskel from Paducah. The President told General-in-Chief Henry Wager Halleck to have Grant revoke General Order No. 11, which Halleck did in the following message:

One Jewish officer, Captain Philip Trounstine, of the Ohio cavalry, stationed in Moscow, Tennessee, resigned in protest, and Captain John C. Kelton, the assistant adjutant-general of the Department of Missouri, wrote to Grant to note his order included &quot;all&quot; Jews, rather than focusing on &quot;certain obnoxious individuals&quot;, and noted that many Jews served in the Union Army. Grant formally rescinded the order, January 17, 1863, within three weeks after Lincoln revoked the order.

===Political response===

The issue attracted significant attention in Congress and from the press. The Democrats condemned the order as part of what they saw as the US Government&#x27;s systematic violation of civil liberties. The Democrats moved to censure Grant in the Republican-dominated Senate; the motion failed by a vote of 30–7. Illinois congressman, and Grant supporter, Elihu Washburne, narrowly defeated a motion to censure Grant in the House by 56 votes to 53 votes. Some newspapers supported Grant&#x27;s action; the &quot;Washington Chronicle&quot; criticized Jews as &quot;scavengers ... of commerce&quot;. Most, however, were strongly opposed, with the &quot;New York Times&quot; denouncing the order as &quot;humiliating&quot; and a &quot;revival of the spirit of the medieval ages.&quot; Its editorial column called for the &quot;utter reprobation&quot; of Grant&#x27;s order.

One of Halleck&#x27;s staff officers privately explained to Grant that the problem lay with the excessive scope of the order: &quot;Had the word &#x27;pedlar&#x27; been inserted after Jew I do not suppose any exception would have been taken to the order.&quot; According to Halleck, Lincoln had &quot;no objection to [his] expelling traitors and Jew peddlers, which I suppose, was the object of your order; but as in terms proscribing an entire religious class, some of whom are fighting in our ranks, the President deemed it necessary to revoke it.&quot; The Republican politician Elihu B. Washburne defended Grant in similar terms. Grant&#x27;s subordinates expressed concern about the order.

On January 6, Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise of Cincinnati, leader of the Reform movement, led a delegation that met with Lincoln to express gratitude for his support. Lincoln said he was surprised that Grant had issued such a command and said, &quot;to condemn a class is, to say the least, to wrong the good with the bad.&quot; Lincoln said he drew no distinction between Jew and Gentile and would allow no American to be wronged because of his religious affiliation.

==Post-war repercussions==
===Repudiation of order===
After the Civil War, General Order No. 11 became an issue in the presidential election of 1868 in which Grant stood as the Republican candidate. The Democrats raised the order as an issue, with the prominent Democrat and rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise urging fellow Jews to vote against Grant because of his alleged anti-semitism. Grant sought to distance himself from the order, saying &quot;I have no prejudice against sect or race, but want each individual to be judged by his own merit.&quot; He repudiated the controversial order, asserting it had been drafted by a subordinate and that he had signed it without reading, in the press of warfare. In September 1868, Grant wrote in reply to Isaac N. Morris, a correspondent:

The episode did not cause much long-term damage to Grant&#x27;s relationship with the American Jewish community. He won the presidential election, taking the majority of the Jewish vote.

===Reconciliation===
In his book &quot;When General Grant Expelled the Jews&quot; (2012) historian Jonathan Sarna maintains that as president Grant became one of the greatest friends of Jews in American history. When he was president, he appointed more Jews to office than any previous president. He condemned atrocities against Jews in Europe, putting human rights on the American diplomatic agenda.

In 1874, President Grant attended a dedication of the Adas Israel Congregation in Washington with all the members of his Cabinet. This was the first time an American President attended a synagogue service. Many historians have taken his action as part of his continuing effort to reconcile with the Jewish community.

Grant has been estimated to have appointed more than fifty Jewish people to federal office including consuls, district attorneys, and deputy postmasters. Grant appointed Jewish citizen Simon Wolf Washington, D.C., recorder of deeds. Grant appointed Jewish citizen Edward S. Salomon territorial governor of Washington, the first time an American Jew occupied a governor&#x27;s seat. Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise said &quot;Grant has revoked Grant&#x27;s notorious order No. 11.&quot;

==Historical views and assessments==

Historians have generally been critical of Grant and his General Order No. 11. Scholars have offered unique perspectives of Grant&#x27;s controversial order, at a time when the Civil War had taken on a different nature.

In 1951, historian Bertram Korn said Grant&#x27;s General Order No. 11 order was part of a pattern by Grant. &quot;This was not the first discriminatory order [Grant] had signed ... he was firmly convinced of the Jews&#x27; guilt and was eager to use any means of ridding himself of them.&quot;

In 1981, historian William S. McFeely said: &quot;Grant was fed up with the cotton speculators and the greedy suppliers of goods to his armies, but rather than attack the entire voracious horde, which included an astonishing number of entrepreneurs---Among them Charles A. Dana and Roscoe Conkling, for example---Grant singled out the Jews. The ancient stereotype of the grasping trader was invoked; once again a frustrated man chose the age-old scapegoat.&quot; McFeely mentioned General James H. Wilson who served under Grant. Wilson said Grant&#x27;s General Order No. 11 was related to Grant&#x27;s difficulties with his own father, Jesse Root Grant. Wilson recounted, &quot;He [Jesse Grant] was close and greedy. He came down into Tennessee with a Jew trader that he wanted his son to help, and with whom he was going to share the profits. Grant refused to issue a permit and sent the Jew flying, prohibiting Jews from entering the line.&quot; Wilson felt that Grant could not deal with the &quot;lot of relatives who were always trying to use him&quot; and perhaps attacked those he saw as their counterpart: opportunistic traders who were Jewish.

In 2001, historian Jean Edward Smith said: &quot;December 1862 was the low point of Grant&#x27;s Civil War career. In addition to his own and Sherman&#x27;s aborted attempts to take Vicksburg, on December 17, Grant issued an order that would stain his reputation forever. In one of the most blatant examples of state-sponsored anti-Semitism in American history, Grant expelled all members of the Jewish faith from the Department of the Tennessee.&quot;

In 2012, historian H.W. Brands said: &quot;Grant shared the penchant for stereotyping Jews common to the age in America, and he may well have concluded that whatever loss they suffered by being treated as a group was a burden they would have to bear. If the inconvenience of this comparatively small class was the price of winning the war, he was willing to make them pay it. He demanded far more of his soldiers every day.&quot;

In 2016, historian Ronald C. White said: &quot;Although non-Jews participated widely in illegal trading, the military newspaper in Corinth called Jews &quot;sharks&quot; feeding upon soldiers.&quot; ¶ &quot;In the midst of this growing anti-Jewish feeling, Grant issued General Orders No. 11 on December 17, 1862.&quot;

In 2017, historian Ron Chernow said: &quot;Whatever the exact sequence of events, Grant must have felt wounded by the situation, for he had railed at traders only to discover his father in cahoots with them. Grant&#x27;s infamous order was a self-inflicted wound, issued at a moment of pique and over the objections of Rawlins. Besides pointing to the order&#x27;s offensive nature, Rawlins predicted it would be countermanded by Washington.&quot;

In 2017, historian Charles W. Calhoun said: &quot;The question dated from late 1862, when Grant had issued an order expelling &quot;Jews, as a class&quot;, from the area of his command in Mississippi for violating trade restrictions. The ill-advised order reflected his frustrations in trying to control illicit commerce behind the lines, and Lincoln countermanded it as soon as it came to his attention.&quot;

In 2018, historian Paul Kahan said: &quot;Offended by the swarm of speculators and traders who profited from the war, Grant issued his infamous General Order No. 11, which included three points, the first of which commanded: &quot;The Jews, as a class violating every regulation of trade established by the Treasury Department and also department orders, are hereby expelled from the Department [of the Tennessee] within twenty-four hours from the receipt of this order.&quot;

<doc id="900454" wikidata="Q13533230" url="?curid=900454" title="Fiscal imbalance in Canada">
<text>Fiscal imbalance (French, &quot;déséquilibre fiscal&quot;) is the term used in Canada to describe a monetary imbalance between the Canadian federal government and the provincial governments.

According to the fiscal imbalance theory, the federal government achieved an important surplus by cutting its contributions towards provinces, leaving provinces with responsibilities much too expensive for their resources. The theory was further developed in the &quot;Seguin Report&quot;, commissioned by former Parti Québécois (PQ) Premier of Quebec Bernard Landry, and completed under former Liberal Quebec Minister of Finance Yves Séguin. The federal government, run by the Liberal Party of Canada until January 2006, denied that this imbalance exists, arguing, in part, that both the federal and provincial governments have access to the same major sources of revenue and that both orders of government face significant spending pressures and limited resources. However, the Conservative Party of Canada recognizes the imbalance. Following their victory in the 2006 federal election in January, they intended a solution be found during their mandate.

A similar situation arose during the Great Depression in the 1920s when the new welfare state severely burdened the provinces, but the federal government continued to run surpluses. This resulted in the 1937-1941 Rowell-Sirois Commission, whose most important result was the removal of restrictions on how provinces could raise money, and the transfer of the expensive Unemployment Insurance program from the provinces to the federal government.

In the past few years, the major issue of fiscal imbalance has been identified by all parties of the National Assembly of Quebec. The Parti libéral du Québec (PLQ) proposes to work with the federal government to solve the problem by increasing federal transfers to Quebec. Yves Séguin, of the PLQ, proposes transferring control of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a value-added tax, from the federal government to the Quebec government. The PQ holds that independence for Quebec will solve the imbalance, with all powers to impose taxes being once again the jurisdiction of the Quebec government. The PQ proposes to uphold efforts to convince the federal government to give money back to Quebec until then.

All major federal parties but the Liberals recognize a monetary imbalance between the federal government and the provinces, and speak of plans to reduce such. The Bloc Québécois, a sovereigntist party at the federal level, is the strongest denouncer of the situation. Prime Minister Paul Martin and his federal Liberals prefer to speak of a fiscal &quot;pressure&quot; on provinces, not admitting directly to the responsibility of the Canadian government. In accepting an amendment to the Throne Speech after the 2004 federal election, the federal Liberals officially acknowledged the reality of the situation.

Federal Liberals assert that it is impossible for a true fiscal imbalance to exist, as the provincial governments have access to all the same sources of revenue as the federal government. The problem is not structural, as it was in earlier years, but political. The provincial governments are unwilling to risk their popularity by raising taxes, insisting instead the extra money come from the federal government. The federal Liberals partially blame the situation on the tax cuts introduced by many of the provincial governments.

The potential solution advocated by most of the provincial premiers is that the transfer payments from the federal government to the provinces be substantially increased. This has been occurring gradually as the federal government has regularly been increasing its transfer for health care spending. The Bloc Québécois supports Yves Séguin&#x27;s suggestion that the GST be given to the provinces. Gordon Campbell, the former premier of British Columbia, has proposed that the federal government take over from the provinces the responsibility for programs that provide pharmaceutical products to low-income people, the elderly and people with disabilities.

<text>Josh Joplin Group was an Atlanta, Georgia-based rock band led by singer-songwriter Josh Joplin. Initially a trio, Joplin hired Geoff Melkonian (bass/viola/vocals) and Jason Buecker (drums/percussion/vocals) to accompany him to play shows together. They simply called themselves Josh Joplin Band. In late 1995 they began pre-production on their first album together. Recorded at Furies Studios with producer Ed Burdell (Magnapop), Projector Head was released, January 6, 1996. Based on local critical success and some airplay on local radio Joplin, Buecker, and Melkonian, began touring vigorously, starting in the south, continuing through the northeast, and beyond.

&quot;Boxing Nostalgic&quot; was their self produced sophomore effort. It was released April 6, 1997 to a sold-out show at the Cotton Club The album introduced piano to their sound and Allen Broyles who played on the record would join the band that same year. The band continued touring and opening shows for Jump, Little Children, Five-eight, The Innocence Mission, Ben Harper, Nathan Sheppard, Kitty Snyder, among others.

In 1998, having played the Roxy Theatre (Atlanta) opening for Shawn Mullins, the Grammy-nominated songwriter of Lullaby, the band discussed making their third album with their friend and Mullins signed on as the producer hiring Anthony J. Resta to create the beats and programming for it. He would later release the album entitled, Useful Music, on his own SMG label. Shortly after its release, Jason Buecker was replaced on drums by Ani Cordero, then Eric Taylor who drummed for legendary dream pop founders, Seely (on Too Pure Records). Deeds Davis was added to play lead guitar and sing.

The band was managed briefly by Nettwerk Music Group before making a slight name change to Josh Joplin Group when Artemis Records headed by legendary industry moguls Danny Goldberg and Daniel Glass. signed them to their label. They were picked up by Indigo Girls and Matthew Sweet manager, Russell Carter.

The Artemis re-release would feature an alternative version of Joplin&#x27;s ballad, I&#x27;ve Changed. It was lavishly produced by Peter Collins at Ocean Way Nashville recording studio, with Kenny Aronoff playing drums. A slightly more successful collaboration came when ex-Modern Lover / Talking Head, Jerry Harrison was brought on produce the opening track, Matter and Joplin&#x27;s new song, Camera One, which hadn&#x27;t been previously released.

The album came out on January 30, 2001 to strong reviews and sold over 100,000 records in its first week. Its single, &quot;Camera One,&quot; was the first independent release to go number-one at Triple A radio and went to number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 chart in 2001. It won the &quot;Single Of The Year&quot; award by the American Association of Independent Music. Useful Music songs were featured in many of the top rated shows of the time, including Party of Five, Dawson&#x27;s Creek, Northern Exposure, and Camera One was a feature of an episode of the comedy series &quot;Scrubs&quot;.

Josh Joplin Group toured America, Mexico, Canada, Australia, and all of Europe. They played shows with countless bands, and artists including Travis, Old 97&#x27;s, Matthew Sweet, Uncle Green, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Lifehouse, Pink, Smoke, and had finished performing a German festival in Cologne, when Green Day burned their drums on stage. The band has also appeared on Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien, Late Show with David Letterman, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, The Panel (Australian TV series), The Mike Bullard Show, Viva TV (Germany), MTV, VH1.

In June 2002, Josh Joplin began working on demos for songwriter turned producer, Fountains of Wayne&#x27;s Adam Schlesinger. Schlesinger was tapped to produce the group&#x27;s sophomore Artemis release. He recorded 12 songs acoustically at Stratosphere Sound, (owned by Schlesinger and James Iha). And although the timing didn&#x27;t work out for the two to work together, Josh and the group, sans Davis, did end up recording &quot;The Future That Was.&quot; with Atlanta producer, Rob Gal and engineers, John Holbrook and Rudyard Lee Cullers at Stratosphere. On this record, the musical styles were similarly varied, ranging from slow piano- and acoustic guitar-driven pop to upbeat keyboard- and electric guitar-based rock.

&quot;The Future That Was&quot; received critical acclaim but it sold poorly and Artemis released dropped the band from their contract. Artemis released two singles from the album, &quot;I Am Not the Only Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Wonder Wheel,&quot; but neither one took off. In the fall of 2003, the band announced that it was breaking up and would play its final two shows in Atlanta in December of that year.

<text>Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz (; 12 December 1890 – 12 April 1963) was a Polish philosopher and logician, a prominent figure in the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic. 

He originated many novel ideas in semantics. Among these was categorial grammar, a highly flexible framework for the analysis of natural language syntax and (indirectly) semantics that remains a major influence on work in formal linguistics. 

Ajdukiewicz&#x27;s fields of research were model theory and the philosophy of science.

==Biography==
Ajdukiewicz was born in 1890 in Tarnopol in Galicia, which at that time, due to Partitions of Poland, was annexed by Austria-Hungary (The Austrian Partition). His father was a senior civil servant. Ajdukiewicz studied at the University of Lwów, and lectured there, as well as in Warsaw and in Poznań. He received his PhD degree with the thesis on Kant&#x27;s philosophy of space. He was Rector of the University of Poznań from 1948 to 1952. He was one of the founders of the journal &quot;Studia Logica&quot; in its current incarnation, editing it from 1953 to his death.

==Work==
In his early epistemological system, which he called Radical Conventionalism, Ajdukiewicz analyzed any language as a set of expressions or sentences, with inferential &quot;rules of meaning&quot; that specify the relation of one expression to another, or to external data. There are three kinds of rules: Axiomatic, Deductive, and Empirical. Following the rules, one can map all knowable sentences of a language. However, some languages&#x27; vocabularies can produce &quot;disconnected&quot; sentences, which are only partly mapped by the &quot;meaning rules&quot;. Therefore, when one uses a language, even scientific one, a &quot;conceptual apparatus&quot;, an untranslatable set of meanings, is needed too, and with it a choice of the problems to be settled. For this reason the theory is a form of conventionalism, and it is radical because even simple experiential reports are exposed to these language-wide considerations. Ajdukiewicz discarded this theory as the 1930s progressed.

<text>Thorgils Skarthi (hare-lip) (Old Norse: Þorgils Skarði) was a Viking leader and poet. He is associated with the founding of Scarborough, England.

Thorgils Skarthi is reputed to have founded Skarðaborg in North Yorkshire, England about 966. The new settlement was later burned to the ground by Tostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumbria and Lord of the Manor of Hougun. 

Thorgils Skarthi is described in the &quot;Kormáks saga&quot; which is principally about his brother, the Icelandic skald, Kormákr Ögmundarson who was the court poet of Norwegian nobleman Sigurd Haakonsson.
English chronicler Robert Mannyng of Brunne in his book &quot;Story of Inglande&quot; (1338) quoted from two lost romances about &quot;Þorgils Skarði&quot;, including that he had a brother called Fleyn. If so, Kormákr may have had the nickname Fleinn. In that case he may have founded Flamborough in Yorkshire (from Old Norse &quot;Fleinaborg&quot;). Thorgils and Kormákr came to England (ca. 965) not long after the expedition of King Harald Greycloak of Norway to Bjarmaland, today the area of Arkhangelsk in northern Russia.

<text>The blood circle, also known as a safety circle, is a term used in Scouting to describe the area within the radius of the arm and blade length combined, when using a knife, saw or axe. This area can be envisioned as a sphere with a person and a sharp instrument at its center. Presumably, anyone within this radius is at risk of injury. To prevent injury to others, it is considered desirable to keep other people outside of the circle at all times.

The practice of delimitating a blood circle is used for a number of activities involving sharp instruments, including whittling.

==Delimitation==
The circle is found by carefully holding the blade of the cutting instrument (never the handle) in the hand used for cutting, and slowly swinging the arm in a 360° arc. The far end of the handle marks the limits of the circle. Any person or thing within this circle is considered to be at risk of being wounded by a slip of the blade.

<text>In cricket, a team&#x27;s innings ends in one of the following ways. In cases 1 and 2, the team are said to be &quot;all out&quot;, because they do not have two players available to bat.

# All but one of the batsmen are out.
# The batting side only has one not-out batsman who is still able to bat (the others are incapacitated through injury, illness or absence; see retirement).
# The team batting last scores the required number of runs to win.
# The game runs out of time for either side to win, and so finishes as a draw.
# The set number of overs (sets of 6 deliveries) have been bowled (in limited overs cricket).
# The team&#x27;s captain declares the innings closed.
# The Match Referee decides that one team has forfeited the game.

Law 13 covers the end of the innings.

==Taking wickets==
When the bowling team has dismissed all but one of the batsmen the innings is said to be over. The batting team is said to be &#x27;all out&#x27; or &#x27;bowled out&#x27;.

For example, in most games, each side has 11 players, so 10 wickets need to be taken to bowl a side out.

There is an exception to this rule if one or more batsmen are injured and/or ill and cannot bat. In such cases, when only one batsman remains not out and capable of batting, the innings is over.

In the case of a Super Over innings, only two batsmen must be dismissed for the innings to be over.

==Overs bowled==
In some games, each team is allocated a set number of overs and its innings is closed once they have been bowled (subject to the innings not ending by another method beforehand).

A restriction can be imposed in a one-innings game, or in the first innings of a two innings game.

Where such a restriction is imposed in a one-innings game, it is said to be a limited overs match. An example of this is an ODI match, where each team can bat for only 50 consecutive overs. Once the 50 overs are up, and the team has not been bowled out, the innings is closed. If rain intervenes so that all the allocated overs cannot be bowled in the time available for the game, the overs restriction may be modified so that the game may be completed in the time that remains.

==Declaration==

If the captain of the batting team feels that his team has amassed a sufficiently large score, he, or the batsmen at the crease deputising for him, may end his team&#x27;s innings voluntarily by &quot;declaring&quot;. This option does not apply to limited overs matches. Declarations allow the declaring side to use all the remaining time to attempt to gain the wickets necessary for victory. The strategic consideration is to gamble a certain draw for a possible victory, while risking defeat if the target is achieved by the incoming batting side.

==Achieving the target==
If one team has completed all of their scheduled innings, while the other team has not, then the initial team is said to have set a &quot;target&quot;, which is the number of runs they have scored plus one, that the other team must &quot;chase&quot;. If the chasing team manages to achieve the target, their innings is ended and they win. In rain-affected matches in which the Duckworth-Lewis method applies, the target to be reached may be less than the actual target set by the first batting side. In a two-innings match where the follow-on has been enforced, the initial batting team may have to chase the target set by the other team.

==Forfeiture==
In the event of the match being disrupted by unruly fans of the host team, the Match Referee may cede the match to the visiting team, if they are in a vantage position.

<text>Épernay () is a commune in the Marne department of northern France, 130 km north-east of Paris on the mainline railway to Strasbourg. The town sits on the left bank of the Marne at the extremity of the Cubry valley which crosses it.

Épernay is a sub-prefecture of the department and seat of an arrondissement.

==History==
Épernay () belonged to the archbishops of Reims from the 5th until the 10th century, when it came into the possession of the counts of Champagne. It was badly damaged during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and was burned by Francis I in 1544. It resisted Henry of Navarre in 1592, and Marshal Biron fell in the attack which preceded its eventual capture. In 1642 it was, along with Château-Thierry, named as a duchy and assigned to the duc de Bouillon.

==Population==

==Main sights==
In the central and oldest quarter of the town, the streets are narrow and irregular; the surrounding suburbs, however, are modern and more spacious, with La Folie to the East, for example, containing many villas belonging to rich wine merchants. The town has also spread to the right bank of the Marne.

One of its churches retains a portal and stained-glass windows from the sixteenth century, but the other public buildings are of modern construction. The most famous street in Épernay is the Avenue de Champagne which features the leading Champagne manufacturers.

Other sights outside the town include:

*Château de Pierry
*Château de Montmort
*Château de Condé

==Economy==

Épernay is best known as the principal &quot;entrepôt&quot; for champagne wines, which are bottled and kept in large cellars built into the chalk rock on which the town is built. The major grape varieties used in champagne are the pinot noir, the pinot meunier and the chardonnay. The production of the equipment and raw materials used in the champagne industry is a major source of local employment. Champagne Pannier, among others, was established in Épernay before moving to Château-Thierry in 1937. Brewing and sugar refinery and the production of hats and caps, are also major industries.

Épernay station has rail connections to Paris, Strasbourg, Reims, Metz, Nancy and several regional destinations.

<doc id="900486" wikidata="Q3133951" url="?curid=900486" title="Hercules L. Dousman">
<text>Hercules Louis Dousman (August 4, 1800 – September 12, 1868) was a fur trader and real-estate speculator who played a large role in the economic development of frontier Wisconsin. He is often called Wisconsin&#x27;s first millionaire.

==Early life and trading activities==
Dousman was born in 1800 on Mackinac Island, Michigan, the son of Michael Dousman, a prominent local fur trader, and his wife. His father was highly successful and sent the son to the eastern United States to be educated in Elizabethtown, New Jersey. For a period he worked as a clerk in a New York City store. 

After Dousman returned to Mackinac Island, he was employed by the American Fur Company, which his father had served as an agent following the War of 1812. In 1826, the company sent Dousman to the frontier settlement of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, where he worked as an assistant to Joseph Rolette, the company&#x27;s local agent.

In Prairie du Chien, Dousman proved his abilities as a trader, quickly rising in the company&#x27;s ranks. By 1834 he had acquired an interest in the company&#x27;s Western Outfit, and in 1840 he became an equal partner in the business together with Joseph Rolette and Henry Hastings Sibley. 

In 1842 the American Fur Company declared bankruptcy, as the European market had declined, and furs were harder to find in the West. To continue in the trade, Dousman entered into a joint venture with Rolette, Sibley, and Pierre Chouteau (of St. Louis, Missouri) to organize a new company to replace it on upper Mississippi. A few months later, Rolette died in debt to the new company, and most of his estate was seized by the remaining partners, including Dousman. With this and other revenue, Dousman acquired more wealth. 

He began to invest in lumber mills in northern Wisconsin and real estate in some of the state&#x27;s growing population centers. Timber was in high demand in the developing settlements of the upper Midwest.

As Dousman began building his investments during the 1830s, he began a long affair with Margaret Campbell, a local Prairie du Chien woman, who may have been of mixed-race. Together they had three children: Emily, George, and a third unnamed child who died at birth in 1838. Campbell also died of complications at this birth.

In 1844, two years after Joseph Rolette&#x27;s death, Dousman married his widow, Jane. (She and Rolette had legally separated in 1836, and he built a house for her.) Together the couple moved into the large two-story brick house that Dousman had constructed a year earlier. Hercules and Jane Dousman had one son, Hercules Louis Dousman II, who was born on April 3, 1848, the year that Wisconsin became a state.
In the 1870s the Dousman house at this site was replaced with what is known as Villa Louis. This was also called the &quot;House on the Mound&quot;, because of its location on what is believed to be a prehistoric Indian earthwork mound.

==Community leader==
As Wisconsin and the region attracted more European Americans, the fur trade declined. The European demand had declined with changes of fashion and the Native Americans, who provided the pelts and were important customers for manufactured goods, were being pushed west by new settlers. Dousman withdrew from the fur trade in the late 1840s and focused on his investments. In addition to having numerous holdings in real estate, grain, and lumber, Dousman became involved in transportation companies. He invested in packet companies and steamboats that ran on the Mississippi River.

In 1852, Dousman became a principal investor in the Madison &amp; Prairie du Chien Railroad, a company formed to ensure that the larger Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi Railroad would meet its goal of connecting Lake Michigan with the Mississippi River. The two companies combined a few years later, and eventually developed as the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. 

Dousman was very influential in bringing the railroad to Prairie du Chien by 1857, and the Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi was the first railroad to lay track all the way across Wisconsin. Prairie du Chien&#x27;s new rail connection caused a small boom in the city&#x27;s population and business. Since Dousman owned much of the land in the city, he made a large profit from this . His net worth was estimated at one million dollars, when fewer than a thousand Americans could claim to possess such a figure.

==Death and legacy==
Dousman died of heart failure on September 12, 1868. By this time he was regarded as one of Wisconsin&#x27;s wealthiest and most influential men. His wife Jane and son Louis inherited his estate. Dousman is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Prairie du Chien.

*Although he died before Villa Louis was constructed, the mansion is preserved as a recognized historic site in part because of Dousman&#x27;s significance in the region. 

*Dousman is featured as the central character in two novels by August Derleth, &quot;Bright Journey&quot; and &quot;The House on the Mound&quot;.

<doc id="900488" wikidata="Q7196219" url="?curid=900488" title="Pinks (TV series)">
<text>Pinks is the primary television series in a franchise series of television programs on Speed based on street racing, held at legal closed drag strips with a theme around drag racing. The original aired from 2005 to 2008, with the spinoff Pinks: All Out following in 2006 until 2010. The name of the show, and the tagline &quot;Lose the race – lose your ride&quot;, refer to common slang of &quot;pink slips&quot; representing a vehicle&#x27;s title document recording ownership, and the derivative street-racing phrase, &quot;racing for pinks,&quot; meaning a race in which the winner earns the loser&#x27;s car. (In California, until recently, the vehicle title was on a pink slip of paper.)

The original was aired by Speed in the United States and Canada, and also airs on Fox Sports 3 in Australia. The series is produced by Pullin Television. The 2016 version aired on Outdoor Channel and Fox Sports Racing starting in March 2016 Produced by Brian Bossone&#x27;s production company Boss One Media llc.

Competitors compete in a drag race (although in the original Pinks, there was a stepladder shifter kart race in Series 1, and the original franchise was based more on illegal street racing) in the franchise. The formats differ between the franchise&#x27;s formats.

In the original series, the illegal street racing style drag race has provisions of the winner claiming ownership of the losing vehicle.

The race format changed slightly through each season:
* Early Series 1 (2005): 2 out of 3 races
* Later Series 1-Series 4 (2005–2007): 3 out of 5 races
* Series 5 (2008): 4 out of 7 races

As the show starts, the host, staff, and contestants sign a binding contract that will transfer the legal title of the two cars in question to Pullin Television, the production company of the show. Since the production company owns the vehicles it guarantees that the show will award the titles to both cars to the winner of the race and eliminates the chance that the loser will refuse to forfeit his/her car after the race.

==Negotiations==

Each team is allowed to inspect the opposing team&#x27;s car to attempt to assess its performance before negotiations for the first race, or in cases where the negotiations are not held for the first race, before the second. Each team chooses a negotiator to act as its spokesperson to discuss the terms of each round. In recent seasons, the first round of each match is often held without negotiation except for terms over the use of nitrous oxide, and features a heads-up start (each car side by side with no time or length handicap)

Negotiations generally deal with starting position, similar to bracket racing (except it is negotiated in car lengths, not seconds), nitrous use, and other such issues, the purpose being to handicap the perceived stronger car and create an even race. In Series 5, negotiating car setup for bracket racing times were permitted. After the negotiations (which can last considerably longer than what is shown), the cars are sent to the start line for the burnout.

==Race==

As is the case for a regular drag race, the cars are allowed to perform a burnout, after which they are staged according to the negotiated starting positions (if any). If a track official finds suspicious fluids leaking on the track, he may order the car shut down and the round automatically forfeited to the opponent. If there are mechanical or weather questions, the race may be delayed. In some cases, a show taping may be called off if the weather prevents a full race from being filmed.

&quot;Pinks&quot; uses a street-race-style arm-drop start rather than the &quot;Christmas Tree&quot; electronic starting system used in modern drag racing. The show&#x27;s signature start signal was devised by show creator and host Rich Christensen. Christensen points at the driver of the car on his right (left lane), waits for the driver to respond with a thumbs up, then drops that arm. Christensen then repeats this with the driver on his left (right lane). Next, Christensen raises both arms, waits for 2 – 5 seconds and then lowers his arms to start the race, which eliminates a popular tactic in drag racing, the delay box, from being used by the car.

Officials, both from the show (since Series 2) and track, observe conditions and tape them for replay in case of false starts (leaving before the hands drop), race infractions (standard drag racing rules apply), and photo finishes. In the case of a photo finish, the video tape of the finish is brought to the start line to allow the teams to agree on the result.

==Fouls==

As in drag racing, the following are declared fouls on &quot;Pinks&quot; and the offender loses the round:
* Leaving before Christensen drops his hands. It is a clean start if the car moves once the hands begin dropping. Officials may use replay to verify the legality of a start. If a driver leaves as soon as the hand begins to drop from its highest point, a driver is said to have &quot;tree&#x27;d&quot; their opponent.
** If both cars jump, the first to jump loses (red light).
** Rich will often point at the offending lane if he spots the infraction.
* Crossing either boundary line
* Leaking fluid during staging
** At that point, Christensen will point to the opponent and point him down the track for a bye run and an automatic win.
* Breaking down and not finishing the run 
** Although it has never happened, it is unknown what would happen if one car commits a foul start and the opponent crosses the boundary line. In normal drag racing, the foul start driver wins.
* In Series 5, if negotiations call for bracket race rules, and one car clearly breaks out while the opponent does not break out, that can be grounds for disqualification for sandbagging.
** Technical advisors will determine time through the timing traps as the scoreboard is turned off, officials still have the ability to observe track timing through the electronic timing system.
** Times will be taken from standard points at the track and compared to the times from the vehicle&#x27;s earlier races in order to see where the car &quot;breaks out&quot;, with the timing of the racer&#x27;s start taken into account.
** The standard timing points in drag racing, excluding the 60-feet time (which Pinks does not use because of the nature of head starts), used by officials are at:
*** 330 feet
*** 660 feet
*** 1,000 feet
*** 1,320 feet
** It is important that times be compared all along the track as opposed to merely the finish line as a driver, once he has reason to believe he&#x27;s going to win the race, can easily &quot;pedal&quot; or &quot;fender&quot; his opponent giving him smaller margin of victory, and a higher lap time.

==Winning==

The match ends when one driver has won the said number of rounds above (2, 3, or 4). After Christensen debriefs the two teams on the previous race, he announces the winner. He then hands the title of both cars to the race winner, and often the winner drives the loser&#x27;s car down the strip after claiming the car by winning the match. A team may also concede because of a catastrophic breakdown. In the spirit of sportsmanship, such a win will often not include the loser&#x27;s car and often calls for a rematch on a later episode, believing that they will not take the car unless it was a clear win on the track, and not by default.

==Notes==

A common occurrence is &quot;set matches&quot;, such as import vs. domestic, new vs. old models of a certain make, or races of popular former cars, such as current technical advisor Charles Hendrickson&#x27;s &quot;Woolly Mammoth&quot;, an altered 1976 Chevrolet Vega wagon that beat several more sporty cars. Other matches have featured motorcycles, trucks, and even snowmobiles.

Recent shows have been sponsored (with prizes going to the winner such as free Bridgestone tires or several cases of Shell Q Motor Oil), with Series Four featuring NAPA Auto Parts as the series presenting sponsor for both the regular and All Out series, owing to the show&#x27;s growing popularity. Current sponsors are NAPA and Valvoline.

The arm-drop start prevents bracket racers from using the delay box, a popular device that is typically used in this genre of drag racing. Typically, with the Christmas tree, the delay box is designed to allow a driver to press the throttle pedal on the second amber, allowing the box to launch the car one second, or in the case on the third amber, a half-second later. The arm drop&#x27;s unpredictability prevents this popular technique from being used, which forces drivers to watch the official to launch the car.

In 2008, the American Drag Racing League was forced to a Pinks-style arm drop start for the final two rounds of their 1/8 mile races when lightning damaged the Christmas tree at US 131 Motorsports Park in Martin, Michigan.

On the May 28, 2006 episode of &quot;WindTunnel with Dave Despain&quot;, the show&#x27;s producer and host Rich Christensen claimed that some losing racers tried to buy back the vehicle after the race, which Rich tried to eliminate in later seasons. However, one race resulted in a win by default when the engine block overheated, leading to a win by &quot;catastrophic failure&quot;. In the spirit of sportsmanship, the winner gave the car back to the loser, noting that a win by default caused by such severe mechanical failure is improper, and promised a future rematch. On multiple episodes Rich has allowed a car that has lost due to mechanical failure to be granted back or purchased back by its original owner so it may be raced again. In each of these cases the original episode was unusable due to the nature of the catastrophic failure, so had another race not been held, the episodes likely would have never aired. In 2008, a special episode, &quot;Quitters, No Shows, and Breakdowns&quot; featured many aborted races.

Because of the nature of the show&#x27;s premise of racing for titles, taping the show is illegal in 40 states. This problem led to the development of a spinoff that does not involve titles and is legal to be taped in all 50 states.

==Pinks: All Out==
The popularity of the original show led to a full drag meet devised by the staff, with this title in 2006. The goal is to take over 400 cars, run them in trial runs to see which 16 cars will provide the most competitive racing, then race those 16 cars against each other, all in the course of one day. The format later changed to 32 cars.

===Qualifying===
As the show opens, a scene shows Rich Christensen discussing how many cars have filed for entry, usually between 250–450, but some Season 3 races feature over 500 cars. The popularity of entries have resulted in the possibility of filing a Pinks entry to be nearly impossible (only 400 cars) that Christensen and the tracks have added &quot;runoffs&quot; weeks before the Pinks meet. Once entries have filled, most tracks will run a special qualifying race to fill out extra entries.

As cars prepare to compete, they are inspected by track officials and technical advisors, including former Pinks contestant turned technical advisor Brian Bossone, and cars are eliminated for problems that may lead to mechanical failure the most notable of which being fluids spilled onto the track, as that can take an hour or more to clean up so racing may resume. Starting in Season 3, automatic disqualification is called for any car that causes a leak of fluids that requires a long delay, especially in violation of track rules.

Unless situations require altering the schedule (inclement weather), the cars take part in one pass per car, using the Christmas tree. This pass uses the Pro Tree (all three ambers light at the same time, then the green four-tenths later) instead of the Standard Tree used by the sportsman drivers that participate in the show (each amber five-tenths after the other), and with the track clocks running and scoreboards displaying time.

At the end of the session, the show officials then determine the most competitive field (not necessarily the fastest) by finding a grouping of cars whose race time are very close together. Those cars are asked to return to the strip for an additional timed run to ensure there is no sandbagging. In the first few seasons, the clock displays were turned off so that only &quot;Pinks&quot; officials know the elapsed time of the cars. The Christmas tree is turned off, and either Rich or Kail Christensen start the run with the show&#x27;s signature arm-drop start.

Sixteen cars (but more often 32 in recent years although there was a 64-car field once), known as the &quot;All Out 16&quot;, are then chosen by the producers to compete in the main portion of the competition. The cars are not formally bracketed, so the producers and technical officials may determine the race by car types (often by the classic GM-Ford, Ford-FCA, or GM-FCA rivalries, or brand nationality), driver types (sometimes past Pinks grudges, family members, or region), or any manner which they may choose (closest in elapsed time). However the competition is generally limited to what the technical advisors (most of them racers) decide is the &quot;most competitive&quot; field. In many cases they will attempt to come up with something interesting to further qualify the field, for example a slower class being allowed to earn a spot in the final 16, but in every case the idea is to find a full class of at least 16 cars in which each car is running within a tenth to 2 tenths of a second of each other.

Starting in Season 3, the rules of the arm-drop qualifying pass were changed following evaluations. Cars are now paired by their elapsed time, with officials determining a &quot;floating minimum&quot; time that will be posted as the cars are staging. The cars must run faster than the posted time on the display near the starter to continue being considered. This again assists in weeding out sandbagging.

In all cases, the idea is to once again weed out teams that use the delay box, since the Pro Tree would throw off Sportsman racers whose reaction times are based on using a delay box (.500 or 1.000 seconds delay from throttle to launch), and the arm drop is based on a driver&#x27;s reflexes, and not anything artificial.

The faster official time that is registered in the track computers will form the basis of the &quot;dial-in&quot; time which will be referenced during the race.

Some sessions (Milan (MI) Dragway and Summit Motorsports Park) require the sixteen cars initially selected to &quot;hold&quot; their positions in 16 drag races where they would race against other formidable opponents. This led to a change to 32 cars for most of Season 3.

For the 2015 series, the rules will call for two different classes with each bracket (8–10, 10–11, 11–13 cars, and motorcycles TBD). Two groups of 16 will be selected in each bracket.

===Race===

====Pinks All Out 32 (Some Season 2 and Most Season 3 races)====
Starting with some Season 2 races, and in most Season 3 races unless inclement weather or curfew force a condensed schedule (the 2009 Texas Motorplex race was condensed because of curfew; two 90-minute delays were caused by cleanup as a result of ethylene glycol coolant spilling on the track, a violation of drag strip rules prohibiting such coolants on the track), a group of 16 cars, dubbed in Season 3 as &quot;Underdogs&quot;, will race another group of 16 cars, the &quot;Defenders&quot;. Each pair of cars will race a single set of eliminations, using the signature &quot;Pinks&quot; arm-drop start. The winners advance to the Pinks All Out 16.

Standard bracket racing rules apply, with drivers being eliminated for infractions, and a breakout rule applies. If officials discover the winner of the race was running considerably faster than the fastest official time of the 16 cars, that car will be disqualified and the loser advances. Pinks technical advisors will review elapsed times in the timing tower to ensure no violation of breakout rules apply.

For the 2009 race at zMax Dragway, the field was started with 64 cars instead of 32. The 32 races took place with half on the left pair and half on the right pair of lanes.

In the final season (2010) of the original series, winning this round was worth a gift certificate worth around $500 from a sponsor.

====Pinks All Out 16====
Season 1 and some races in Season 2 afterwards (starting in Season 3, only if weather becomes an issue) start with just the All Out 16, while some Season 2 and most Season 3 races begin with the first round, leading to the All Out 16. As in the first round, each pair of cars (there is no formal pairing) will race in single-elimination rounds using the arm drop start. In this round, the winner receives $1,000 that may be used as betting money in further rounds, and advances to the Pinks All Out 8.

At Charlotte Motor Speedway&#x27;s zMax Dragway, the 32 winners of the first round (expanded to 64 cars) raced in eight four-car drag races administered like the Pinks All Out 16 round format. The winners of the four-car drag races advanced to the Pinks All Out 8 with the $1,000.

In later seasons, betting on winnings were prohibited, and drivers won straight prize money—typically $500.

In the 2015 revival series, the cars must be driven back to the starting line on their own power between rounds. No use of any pit equipment is permitted or the competitor is disqualified.

====Pinks All Out 8 and 4 (all) and Championship round (revival series)====
For each round leading up to the final, the driver&#x27;s total cash winnings to that point ($1,000 to start Pinks All Out 8) may be used as betting money. Drivers may bet as much of their winnings in each round, but starting in Season 3, the limit is $500. Titles and money that was not awarded for a victory may not be bet. In addition to advancing to the next round, the winner gets whatever money their opponent bet, if any.

During the 2007 round taped at The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, all 16 All Out drivers agreed to bet all winnings for an &quot;all in&quot; tournament. No other taping has featured the all-in format.

The winners in the All Out 8 advance to the All Out 4, with the same format as the All Out 8 in regards to betting, and the winners of the All Out 4 advance to the All Out Final.

Again, in later seasons, the prize money format was changed to $750 in the All Out 8, and $1,000 in the All Out 4. No betting permitted.

In the 2015 revival series, the Championship round in each of the two brackets is determined the same way. The winner wins $2,500 for the bracket championship.

====Championship round – Original Series====
After the third round, the two remaining teams determine lane choice, and in earlier seasons, betting. In many circumstances at this point Rich Christensen will suggest the finalists duel for the prize money only. Then, the cars race in a best two-out-of-three match. Unless requested by a competitor because of a mechanical problem or in case of inclement weather, the cars must be driven back to the starting line on their own power between rounds and be staged for another race immediately. Once the cars are back at the staging area, the process for the next race begins immediately. This is referred to as &quot;hot lapping&quot;. 
The winner of the finals, in addition to any money bet by their opponent, also wins a $10,000 cash prize. In the original series, a tool chest with tools valued at over $7,000 from NAPA Auto Parts was also provided.

The only exception to this format came during the February 17, 2007 taping at Palm Beach International Raceway. An excessive number of track incidents (oil downs, crashes, debris) slowed the process, where the main elimination rounds started after midnight. With excessively low temperatures when the semifinal rounds were to start after 2:15 AM, the race was called after the second round by mutual consent of the four drivers remaining because of lane conditions. All four drivers split the $10,000 evenly, and one driver, as chosen by the others, won the tool chest.

====Classic Pinks Final (2015)====
The winners of the two brackets (12–13 seconds, for example) return to a Classic Final format similar to the original Pinks, except instead of car titles, the two teams can bet some of their winnings in the final, with the producers adding cash bonuses to the pot. Based on performance results from the bracket finals that will be given to both teams and the staff, the two teams can negotiate lengths, format (one round only or two out of three), and lane choice. The overall Pinks All Out champion under the 2015 format is the competitor who wins the match.

===Sandbagging===
The All Out format was created because of Rich Christensen’s displeasure with &#x27;sandbagging’ – feathering or decelerating to create a false elapsed time and hide actual performance – on the original &quot;Pinks&quot;. This format, where brothers and technical directors Adam and Nate Pritchett rigorously select a group of closely matched cars, was made to provide the drama associated with closer racing.

To prevent sandbagging, if a car runs considerably faster than what they ran in practice during any elimination round, they are automatically disqualified (&quot;Breakout&quot;). Officials will be standing at the 1,000 and 1,320 foot markers to observe if a driver is sandbagging.

The show was originally to be titled &quot;Ultimate Racer&quot; but was later changed to the current &quot;All Out&quot; subtitle, a reference that the car is running at its maximum during the race.

===Quick Eight===

During taping sessions in 2007 and 2008, officials grew suspicious excessive sandbagging was taking place among racers. Some racers, the officials thought, were running slower times than their cars could run in an attempt to run &quot;in the pack&quot; where they predicted the crew would choose for the All Out 16.

In response to that, some 2008 rounds added a Quick Eight format, where the eight fastest cars would make one championship pass down the strip. The driver with the fastest elapsed time wins $10,000 and a second NAPA toolchest. In other rounds, the Quick Eight became a knockout round, with the eight fastest cars racing against each other in eliminations before the Pinks All Out 16. A pilot was taped during one 2008 taping for this concept to be split into a separate series.

The format has continued for live events in 2009, with the Quick Eight race (now usually run as a straight-up eight-car knockout format) before the Pinks All Out 32. The Quick Eight has their own prizes.

==Motorcycles in the Future==

On October 4, 2008, Rich Christensen taped two pilots for future consideration, including a fourth concept of the &quot;Pinks&quot; franchise, at Maryland International Raceway in Budds Creek, MD.

This version, involving motorcycles, featured two classes (Street Bikes and Pro Elapsed Time) of motorcycles. A Pinks All Out 16 was formed from each class. Each class races, Pinks-style, in eliminations to determine their own winner. The winners of each class will participate in a classic Pinks best 4 out of 7 race, complete with classic rules (negotiations, et al.) where the winner wins a new custom motorcycle.

While the format was not picked up, the 2015 revival of Pinks : All Out will feature at least one motorcycle class to be taped as part of Pinks : All Out Week. An all-terrain vehicle 1/8 mile format was also taped and included into an episode.

==Staff==
The show is hosted by Rich Christensen, who also employs his cousin Kail as an official. Former contestants Charles Hendrickson and Nathan Pritchett (the only person to have run matches with both a car and a motorcycle) are assigned to each team as technical advisors. Gavin Jerome is the roving public address announcer. Former contestant Brian Bossone has also been utilized as a technical adviser. Steve Meade, known as radio personality &quot;Willie B&quot; in Denver, and Clay Millican, NHRA Mello Yello Top Fuel driver, join the Pinks staff in 2009 as technical advisers.

==Rich Christensen and Brian Bossone (Boss One Media) Reacquires the Franchise and Future==
At the end of the 2010–11 season, Fox Cable Networks did not renew Pinks : All Out due to the change from Speed to Fox Sports 1.

By 2012, as Fox wound down the Speed operations, the franchise was owned by 21st Century Fox. Meanwhile, another street-racing game show format from Lucas Oil owned MAVTV that Christensen developed, Won &amp; Done, was airing. On March 24, 2014, Christensen confirmed on Dragzine.com that Rich Christensen Entertainment had leased the Pinks franchise rights from Fox and was working on a plan with Boss One Media&#x27;s Brian Bossone for the future of the franchise.

On February 13, 2015, Christensen, Boss One Media and Rockingham Dragway owner Steve Earwood announced Pinks: All Out Week, an entire Independence Day weekend of taping of episodes. The show originally planned three classes (9.00–9.99, 10.00–10.99, 11.00–11.99), motorcycle classes (something that had not been part of the original Pinks: All Out), and a Quick Eight of under 8.99 seconds. Taping is scheduled between July 2–4, 2015 for multiple episodes, at least one each night. However, the immense popularity of registration has forced the show to change the car classes to 8.00–9.99 (8–10 seconds), 10.00–10.99 (10–11 seconds), and 11.00–12.99 (11–13 seconds). Two eighth-mile classes—an all-terrain vehicle class and Jr Dragsters—will also be added.

The new format began airing on Outdoor Channel on March 7, 2016.

==Attendance==
Normally attendance at live tapings is high, with amateur races and concerts (usually featuring The Nadas, who perform the original show&#x27;s ending theme &quot;Walk Away&quot;) bookending the televised races.

In the June 29–30, 2007 taping of &quot;Pinks: All Out&quot; at Milan (MI) Dragway, 33,000 spectators attended the taping with 350 cars attempting to compete for the 16 slots.

On December 3, 2007, the 400 entries for a June 7, 2008 taping of &quot;Pinks: All Out&quot; at Summit Racing Equipment Motorsports Park in Norwalk, Ohio, were filled in 12 minutes.
On January 6, 2008, the 400 entries for a July 25, 2008 taping of &quot;Pinks: All Out&quot; at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey, were filled in less than 1 minute.

Rockingham Dragway, which was the host for the taping of the &quot;NEW&quot; 2016 episodes aired on Outdoor Channel, reported a high number of registrations(500) forcing the producers to adjust the classes planned for each of three days of &quot;Pinks : All Out&quot; competition, effectively turning the fast class to 8–9:99 ET second class to 10–10:99 second ET class and the slowest 11–12:99 second class along with an added Motorcycle, ATV and Jr Dragster class as well.

<text>The Bandung Institute of Technology (; , abbreviated as ITB) is a public research university located in Bandung, Indonesia. It has produced many notable leaders in science, engineering, politics, business, academia, and culture. ITB is one of the most prestigious universities in Indonesia.

==History==

Bandung Institute of Technology traces its origin to the Technische Hoogeschool te Bandoeng (THB) which was founded during the centuries-old Dutch colonialism of Indonesia. The project was founded by Karel Albert Rudolf Bosscha, a German-Dutch entrepreneur and philanthropist. His proposal was later approved by the colonial government to meet increasing demand of technical know-how in the colony.

The school building was designed in 1918 by a Dutch architect named Henri Maclaine Pont by blending Indonesian vernacular architecture with modern elements. The school first opened its doors on 3 July 1920. By then, it only had one active department, the Faculty of Technical Science and one academic major, The Department of Road and Water Resources Engineering.

During the 1940s, the university rapidly changed hands and experienced various renamings.

During the Japanese occupation in the World War II and ensuing years, the school was renamed as the Industrial University by the Japanese administration. This name was short-lived as a few years later, the Japanese surrender paved the way for Indonesia&#x27;s declaration of independence and the campus was renamed as Technical High School by the newly-declared republic. 

A year later, the Dutch colonial government would return to re-occupy Indonesia and took re-directorship of the campus. It was renamed again as Emergency University of Dutch East Indies as the Indonesian National Revolution raged across the colony. It was during this time that the campus would begin operating the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Science under the University of Indonesia.

On 2 March 1959, the two faculties of University of Indonesia in Bandung was declared a separate academic entity. Bandung Institute of Technology was founded for higher learning in natural sciences, technologies, and fine arts. 

In 2020, Reini Djuhraeni Wirahadikusumah was appointed as rector of the university until 2025 replacing Kadarsah Suryadi. She became the first female rector since the inauguration of the institute by President Sukarno in 1959. Then, in 2025, Tatacipta Dirgantara succeed her.

==Campuses==
The ITB main campus, along with its other campuses, covers a total area of about .

=== Ganesha Campus ===
The original and main campus in Ganesha has a wide range of facilities. Apart from lecture classes and laboratories, the campus boasts an art gallery, a dedicated sports centre, central library, medical clinic and extracurricular areas.

=== Jatinangor Campus ===
Due to the increasing number of students, the decision was made to develop another campus elsewhere. The second campus in Jatinangor served as an integral part of the university and is on the same standing as the Ganesha campus. All Freshmen will have their Joint Preparatory Stage (&quot;Tahap Persiapan Bersama&quot; - TPB) in Jatinangor Campus starting from August 2023. 

=== Cirebon Campus ===
ITB plans to build a brand-new campus in Cirebon so as to anticipate future research and educational endeavors. This will be the university&#x27;s commitment in further developing human resources of Indonesia.

==Rankings and Reputation==
ITB was ranked 281st worldwide in the 2024 QS World University Rankings, and ranked 60th in QS Asian University Rankings 2024. ITB has also been ranked 120–150 worldwide by THE World University Ranking 2023 and 35-40th in the THE Asia University Rankings 2023. 

Domestically, the university is ranked 1st by QS World University Rankings and ranked 1st by Times Higher Education. ITB is universally and consistently placed among the top three elite universities in the country, having the highest score threshold in Indonesia&#x27;s national state university entrance test in 2009. Out of the 422,159 candidates who applied, only 2,000 are successfully admitted. To this day, engineering faculties in ITB is nationally accepted as the finest in the country and as such, they are among the toughest to be admitted into. 

Apart from STEM-based faculties, the campus also opened a business school called the School of Business and Management (SBM). SBM is considered as the most prestigious and elite business school in Indonesia and regarded as the best business school in Indonesia by eduniversal ranking, global brand magazine and SWA Magazine, the most popular business magazine in Indonesia.

== Research ==
According to the rector of ITB, ITB had built a mining research centre for both national and international research such as research on oil reservoirs, production optimisation, geological exploitation and coal exploitation development worth Rp110 billion ($12.1 million).

== Faculties and programs ==
Consisting of 12 faculties and schools, ITB is not only focused on the fields of STEM but also arts and business management which have been recognized at national and international levels.

=== Natural Sciences Cluster ===

=== Pharmacy Cluster ===
=== Engineering Cluster ===



=== Social Sciences, Arts, and Humanities Cluster ===

== Student loan ==
In January 2024, ITB was reported encouraging their students to pay tuition using loan. This was revealed after an account on Twitter uploaded a photo of a pamphlet containing information on monthly tuition installments managed by a third party. Head of Public Relations ITB, Naomi Haswanto, confirmed that ITB uses financial institutions to help student pay for their tuition and added that the collaboration was carried out using financial institutions that had permission from the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (literally &quot;Financial Services Authority&quot;; OJK). She also added that the collaboration for paying tuition fees via installments has been implemented with the Danacita platform since August 2023 and stated that several other universities have also provided the option of paying via installments. Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology released a statement and asked the rector of ITB, Reini Wirahadikusumah, to search for a good funding scheme solution after the payment of tuition using an online loan platform went viral and as a mission to provide high quality and inclusive education. OJK asked for an explanation from Danacita as a platform that offers payment of tuition fees in online loan installments. 

On 29 January, hundreds of students marched from the ITB Ganesha campus to the rectorate building as a form of protest against the policy of paying tuition fees using online loan installments. They protested by carrying a number of posters against campus policies which were considered burdensome with the offer of payment via online installments. A number of students then tried to negotiate to meet the ITB rector but it ended in a commotion because they were unable to get the rector to come out and meet the crowd to discuss the problem. Chairman of the KM ITB Cabinet, Muhammad Yogi Syahputra, asked the campus to remove the option of paying via installments which is said to reach Rp. 12,500,000 (USD 790) and demanded to provide a guarantee so that students who had payment arrears could fill out study plan forms which were limited until 30 January. Former Governor of West Java, Ridwan Kamil, said that ITB intentions were good in providing payments using the installment scheme because not all students have the ability to overcome the financial problems they experience. He added that as much as possible, the payment option should not be a burden on students.

<doc id="900496" wikidata="Q678012" url="?curid=900496" title="Armand de Gontaut, Baron of Biron">
<text>Armand de Gontaut, [[Baron]] of Biron (, 152426 July 1592) was a soldier, diplomat and Marshal of France. Beginning his service during the Italian Wars, Biron served in Italy under Marshal Brissac and Guise in 1557 before rising to command his own cavalry regiment. Returning to France with the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis he took up his duties in Guyenne, where he observed the deteriorating religious situation that was soon to devolve into the French Wars of Religion. He fought at the Battle of Dreux in the first civil war. In the peace that followed he attempted to enforce the terms on the rebellious governorship of Provence.

Having fought for the crown during the decisive victory at Battle of Moncontour in 1569, he was elevated to the post of grandmaster of artillery. In this role he was tasked with reducing the town of Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély which proved resistant to his efforts. As the war dragged on he found himself increasingly involved in diplomatic efforts, meeting with Jeanne d&#x27;Albret repeatedly to talk terms. With peace declared in August 1570 he continued his negotiations with Albret in the hopes of setting up a marriage between her son Navarre and Margaret of Valois. In the wake of the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew he was tasked with reducing the well defended city of La Rochelle, commanding the artillery batteries he made limited progress over the following months, before Anjou oversaw peace negotiations so that he might depart for the Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Upon Henri III&#x27;s ascent as French king Biron was appointed as a Marshal. His forces were involved in containing Condé as he tried to re-enter France during the fifth civil war. He was involved again as a diplomat in conducting negotiations in the late 1570s, fighting again in the sixth civil war. When in 1573 Alençon who had become sovereign of the Dutch requested reinforcements to secure his position in the country. Biron led troops to support his administration. He would not be involved in the French Fury that saw Alençon&#x27;s position collapse in the country. With the dominance of the &quot;Ligue&quot; in the following years Biron half heartedly pursued their objectives before supporting Henri when he broke with the &quot;Ligue&quot; in 1588. With the king&#x27;s death in 1589, he transferred his loyalties to Navarre, aiding him in his campaigns in Normandy against the &quot;Ligue&quot;. It was during a siege of a &quot;Ligue&quot; town that he was hit by a cannonball and killed.

==Early life and family==
His family, one of the numerous branches of the House of Gontaut, took its title from the territory of Biron, then in Périgord, where on a hill between the Dropt and the Lède the Château de Biron still stands, begun by the lords of Biron in the 11th century. 

Biron, born in 1524, served as a page of Queen Marguerite de Navarre. He was a man of considerable literary attainments, and used to carry a pocketbook, in which he noted everything that appeared remarkable. Some of his letters are preserved in the Bibliothèque nationale and in the British Museum; these include a treatise on the art of war. His son, Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron (1562–1602), also became Marshal of France in 1594. A grandson of his second son, Henry, was Charles-Armand de Gontaut, another Marshal of France.

==Reign of Henri II==
Biron attracted the notice of the Marshal Brissac, with whom he saw active service in Italy. A wound he received in his early years made him lame for life, and gave him the nickname &quot;Armand Le Boiteux&quot; (the limper). He did not however withdraw from his military career, and he held a command in Guise&#x27;s regiment of light horse in 1557. A short while later he became chief of a cavalry regiment.

==Reign of Francis II==
In 1560 Biron reported to the crown concerning the situation he faced in Guyenne with disaffected nobles turning to Protestantism.

==Reign of Charles IX==
===First civil war===
During the fighting of the first civil war, he fought for the crown at the Battle of Dreux in December 1562.

===Long peace===
The Edict of Amboise brought an end to the first war of religion in March 1563. To ensure that its terms would be followed across France, commissioners were sent out to oversee its implementation and resolve disputes. Biron was sent to Provence, where there were reports of problems in implementing the peace. Upon arriving he reduced the hold out town of Sisteron which had not relinquished its Protestant garrison. He further reinstalled the governor Tende who had been chased out of Provence by his own son during the civil war. He reported back to the crown in April 1564 that both the commissioners and those who desired to lodge complaints about the enforcement were being intimidated by the local nobility. Specifically among the nobility he singled out Sommerive and Carcès as particularly troublesome and recommended they be called to court to answer for their actions. He further opined that only the full weight of royal authority on the region would bring about the obedience of the king&#x27;s edict. In the same year, Biron wrote to Catherine asking to be relieved of his office in Guyenne.

===Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély===

With victory at the Battle of Moncontour several marshals advocated using the opportunity to secure a favourable settlement, among them Biron. The crown refused and pressed on to break the Huguenot strongholds in the south. The first stronghold in their way was that of Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély. Biron was raised to the post of grand master of artillery and starting on 26 October tasked with reducing the town. Progress was slow, several assaults were bloodily repulsed, disease and hunger ran rampant in the royal camp. By the time the city had surrendered on 2 December the royal army was a broken shell. Brantôme relates an anecdote where after the surrender, Biron attacked his men who dishonored the terms of surrender by pillaging from the captured garrison.

===Diplomat===
Alongside his military role in the war he also conducted diplomatic missions. When in February 1570 the Protestants sent demands to the court, Biron was sent along with de Mesmes to communicate the king&#x27;s rejection of their terms. Having urged the king to keep the negotiations going, at the very least to learn the rebels intentions, he had a meeting with Coligny in March. Beyond the formal peace declared in August 1570, Biron&#x27;s role as a negotiator would continue, now for the Navarre marriage instead of peace. He received Albret for an interview to negotiate the match in March 1571. His involvement in the negotiations continued over the following months until in December he prepared to escort her to Paris, to discuss directly with Catherine de&#x27;Medici, after some delays around Nérac they continued on to the capital in January. With the marriage contract concluded, Biron arranged for the young Navarre&#x27;s journey to Paris, and was with him when news of his mother&#x27;s death arrived.

===La Rochelle===
Shortly after the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew the town of La Rochelle filled with refugees from across France. The crown was conscious the town could be the nucleus of resistance and Biron was named governor of the city, with the aim of the town submitting peacefully to him. When he attempted to enter the city, his entry was rebuffed. Negotiations continued until November, Biron and the crown remembering the difficulties the far less well defended city of Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély had presented, and desiring to avoid a siege. However no agreement would be reached and a siege would be agreed upon when news of La Rochelle&#x27;s negotiations with the English were reported.

To this end men and munitions flooded south to Biron throughout December and into January 1573. Biron&#x27;s preparations continued slowly, as he had to prepare for both land and sea attacks. By the time Anjou arrived in February, he had completed the investment of the town from land, but the harbour remained only partially closed, and no approach trenches had been dug. Anjou now took over as overall commander, successfully completing the closure at sea. By April the approach trenches had reached the walls. Assaults began in the following months, as the artillery reduced the area into a smouldering ruin. Desertions ran rampant and by the time the outer wall was breached in June Anjou was increasingly tired of the siege. He excoriated Biron for what he felt were his failings in conducting the siege. Concurrently Anjou had been elected king of Poland, and he took the excuse to negotiate a peace. As a term of this settlement, Biron was at last allowed his brief entry into the town. Throughout the siege, Biron&#x27;s batteries had fired 25,000 rounds.

==Reign of Henri III==
===Fifth civil war===
With Henri&#x27;s return to France from Spain, he was keen to counteract the military influence that Retz had accrued as a favourite of Catherine in the proceeding years. To this end Biron was appointed as a marshal. In response, Retz resigned his role of Constable that he had held in Henri&#x27;s Polish administration.

With civil war resumed in between the crown and the &quot;politiques&quot; there was fear at court that Condé, who was in Germany, would enter the kingdom with his forces. To prevent this, and allow the crown to focus on subduing Damville in Languedoc, Biron and the young Guise were sent out to monitor the frontier. They arrived at Langres with 8000 men. The king continued to send forces to Langres to bolster the army, for the eventual crossing of Condé, which occurred in October, Guise leading the army that defeated them at Dormans.

===Informal war===
In January 1577 as France again found itself on the brink of civil war with the Huguenots at arms, Henri, little interested in a war that would leave him at the mercy of the &quot;Ligue&quot; sent out envoys to the key Protestant aristocrats, hoping to bring them into line such that formal conflict could be averted. Biron was sent with a message to Navarre, a mixture of reassurances about the crowns friendliness to him, and concerns about his actions. Navarre sent a contrite reply, but held several objections to the king&#x27;s position, and another debate on the &quot;conseil privé&quot; erupted over whether to go to war. With the peace faction winning, Biron was again sent to Navarre on 3 March to continue negotiations. While these were ongoing the military situation of his supporters deteriorated into war. Navarre maintained his desire for peace, and the two sides were able to come to terms in the Treaty of Bergerac in September 1577.

Navarre complained bitterly about Biron&#x27;s role as lieutenant-general of Guyenne, bemoaning that he was governor in name only given how much authority his subordinate had. In February 1579 he resigned as lieutenant-general of Saintonge and Aunis in favour of the sieur de Belleville. Biron, as lieutenant-general of Guyenne was responsible for overseeing some of the concessions granted to the Protestants in the Treaty of Nérac, however he would not implement them all. As a result the Protestants of the region began re-arming, and Navarre took the excuse to seize the town of Cahors in May 1580. He took a brief leave in 1580 after he fell off a horse whilst campaigning at Toulouse, and while recovering appointed his son Charles to lead his forces.

===Netherlands===
The king&#x27;s younger brother Alençon seeking advancement accepted the offer from William the Silent to become sovereign of the United Provinces of the Netherlands in 1579, entering the country in 1582. In 1581 with Spanish fears about what Alençon might be planning, Biron was sent to Picardy to guard the border in case Spain took the offensive. The following year Alençon now in the low countries was struggling to exert control his army depleted by the harsh winter. Biron and Montpensier were tasked with reinforcing him. Biron arrived with 3500 foot and several companies of cavalry on 1 December 1582.
He would grow restless and unsatisfied with the territories he ruled, and sought to surprise the city of Antwerp to add it to his dominion. The attempt was a disaster, and his force was trapped in the city and destroyed during the French Fury, Biron and Montpensier were uninvolved in his attempt on the city. Bellièvre was sent to the Netherlands to smooth things other with the States. He achieved great success and the States invited Biron to relieve the siege of Eindhoven which was under attack by the Spanish. In April however Eindhoven capitulated and Biron moved his forces to Roosendaal. Increasingly out of cash Biron begged for funds almost daily but without result, his army disintegrated from desertions before his eyes. Biron angrily blamed the estates for the failure of his expedition. Money was at last advanced from France to pay for the remnants of Biron&#x27;s army to withdraw from the Netherlands.

With the death of Alençon the following year, Biron accompanied his body back to Paris for the lavish funeral overseen by Henri.

===Ligue===
Compelled by the &quot;Ligue&quot; to make war on the &quot;politiques&quot; in 1585, Henri tasked Matignon and Biron with prosecuting the war against Navarre in Guyenne. The two Marshals prosecuted the campaign half heartedly, and only the forces directly loyal to the &quot;Ligue&quot; under Mercœur conducted the war with any vigour. Biron secretly negotiated with Navarre in July 1586 and in the following month a truce was established by the two.

In 1587, with a German army invading in support of the Protestants under Casimir a council was held by Henri to decide how to proceed. Henri announced to the assembled nobles his desire to lead the French army out to destroy the invader, explaining it would allow him to regain authority from the &quot;Ligue&quot;. Biron and all the other councillors except Nevers expressed their horror at this idea.

===Day of the Barricades===
By 1588 the situation in Paris was tense, the &quot;Ligue&quot;, increasingly dominant, orchestrated a coup in the city, with Guise at its head. Those out on the barricades threatened bloody violence on the loyalists, unless the royal and Swiss troops were removed from the city. Henri ordered the troops withdrawn to the Louvre, and tasked François d&#x27;O, Jean VI d&#x27;Aumont and Biron with leading them off the streets. Small fights would break out however, and the lives of the Swiss were at risk from the crowd. The king sent Biron to meet with the duke of Guise, and Guise agreed to provide them passage to safety from the violent crowd.

==Reign of Henri IV==
With the assassination of Henri III outside Paris, Biron was among the marshals that recognised the legitimacy of Navarre as king immediately, and went over to support him in his fights with the &quot;Ligue&quot;. He fought alongside the king at the Battle of Ivry in Normandy, where the leading &quot;Liguer&quot; Mayenne was defeated. He was killed by a cannonball at the siege of Épernay on 26 July 1592.

<text>An early adopter or lighthouse customer is an early customer of a given company, product, or technology. The term originates from Everett M. Rogers&#x27; &quot;Diffusion of Innovations&quot; (1962).

==History==
Typically, early adopters are customers who, in addition to using the vendor&#x27;s product or technology, also provide considerable and candid feedback to help the vendor refine its future product releases, as well as the associated means of distribution, service, and support. Early adoption could also be referred to as a form of testing in the early stages of a project. 

The relationship is synergistic. The customer receives early (and sometimes unique, or at least uniquely early) access to an advantageous new product or technology. In return, the customer may also serve as a kind of guinea pig.

In exchange for being an early adopter, and thus being exposed to the problems, risks, and annoyances common to early-stage product testing and deployment, the &quot;lighthouse customer&quot; is sometimes given especially attentive vendor assistance and support, even to the point of having personnel at the customer&#x27;s work site to assist with implementation. The customer is sometimes given preferential pricing, terms, and conditions, although new technology is often very expensive, so the early adopter still often pays quite a lot.

The vendor, on the other hand, benefits from receiving early revenues, and also from a lighthouse customer&#x27;s endorsement and assistance in further developing the product and its go-to-market mechanisms. Acquiring lighthouse customers is a common step in new product development and implementation. The real-world focus that this type of relationship can bring to a vendor can be extremely valuable.

Early adoption does come with pitfalls: early versions of products may be buggy and/or prone to malfunction. Furthermore, more efficient, and sometimes less expensive, versions of the product usually appear a few months after the initial release (Apple iPhone). The trend of new technology costing more at release is often referred to as the &quot;early adopter tax&quot;.

<doc id="900501" wikidata="Q7860947" url="?curid=900501" title="Types of bowlers in cricket">
<text>In the sport of cricket there are two broad categories of bowlers: pace and spin. Pace bowlers rely mostly on the speed of the ball to dismiss batsmen, whereas spin bowlers rely on the rotation and turn off the ball to deceive the batter.

==Pace bowlers==

Pace bowlers, or fast bowlers or pacemen, rely on speed to get a batter out. This type of bowler can be further classified according to the speed at which they bowl the ball on average.

Most pace bowlers are medium-fast to fast in top level cricket. In general, bowlers of this type are described as right arm or left arm &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;medium-fast&quot;. Another technique of fast bowling is the sling action. This action generates extra speed but sacrifices control. Exponents include Jeff Thomson, Waqar Younis, Lasith Malinga, Mitchell Johnson, Fidel Edwards, Shaun Tait and Jasprit Bumrah.

Though there may have been faster balls bowled, the highest electronically measured speed (after speed guns became popular) for a ball bowled by any bowler is 161.3 km/h (100.23 mph), bowled by Pakistan&#x27;s Shoaib Akhtar to England&#x27;s Nick Knight on 22 February 2003 in a World Cup match at Newlands, Cape Town, South Africa; this was also the first ball ever officially measured to break the 100 mph barrier.

===Swing bowlers===

Swing bowlers are pace bowlers who, apart from being fast, also use the seam of the ball to make it travel in a curved path through the air. This is further encouraged by systematically polishing one side of the ball while allowing the other side to become roughened and worn. The differing airflow around the two sides will cause the ball to swing in the air, towards the roughened side. By changing the orientation of the ball in his hand, a bowler may therefore cause the ball to swing into or away from the batter. In addition to a well-polished ball, other factors help the ball to swing, notably damp or humid weather conditions. However balls which have been in play for some time do not tend to swing so much due to the deterioration of the seam. In addition, bowlers of express pace do not tend to get as much swing as the fast-medium-to-medium pace bowlers.

Reverse swing as the name suggests, moves in the opposite direction to conventional swing. Instead of the ball drifting towards its rougher side, it veers towards the smooth. Typically, a ball needs to be older, and thoroughly knocked about, before it arrives in “the zone” to reverse; and it takes a faster bowler to inject enough velocity that the effect will take hold. Sarfraz Nawaz and Imran Khan are credited as two of the earliest exponents of reverse-swing in International cricket. Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram perfected the art of reverse-swing and inspired many to learn the art.

An outswinger is a type of delivery of the ball in the sport of cricket. In such a delivery the ball curves—or &quot;swings&quot;—out and away from the batter&#x27;s body and the wicket. By contrast, an inswinger swings in toward the batter and the wicket. Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dominic Cork, Dale Steyn and James Anderson are some of the bowlers who had the best outswingers of their time.
===Other tactics===
Pace bowlers frequently dismiss batsmen through variation and deception. A batter who has been &quot;softened up&quot; by a series of &quot;bouncers&quot;, which pitch nearer the bowler than normal and reach the batsman around head height, or even hit the batsman, may tend to play the next ball on the back foot, and thus be susceptible to a full-length &quot;yorker&quot; delivery that bounces at his toes. Many bowlers also develop a seam bowling and &quot;slower ball&quot;; these are bowled with the same arm action as their normal delivery, but come slower from the hand, usually due to the bowler gripping the ball differently or cocking his wrist at the last moment. With luck, the batsman will misread the pace, and will have finished his shot before the ball arrives. Other common variations include the &quot;leg cutter&quot; and &quot;off cutter&quot;, medium pace deliveries bowled with a spinner&#x27;s wrist action, which can sometimes &quot;turn&quot; just like deliveries from a spinner. Steve Waugh is often credited as the bowler who pioneered and popularized the back of the hand slower deliveries and change of pace in order to baffle the batsmen.

==Spin bowlers==

Spin bowlers or spinners impart rotation to the ball to get a batter out. The spin on the ball makes its movement hard to predict, particularly when it bounces, hence spin bowlers try to deceive batsmen into making a mistake. Speed is not crucial in spin bowling, and spinners tend to bowl in the slow-medium to medium-slow range, around 45-55 mph. There are two broad categories of spin bowling: wrist spin and finger spin.

===Wrist spin===

Wrist spinners are bowlers who use their wrists to spin the ball. A right-handed wrist spinner is known as a leg spinner and his or her mode of bowling is known as leg break. A leg break will move from right to left from the bowler&#x27;s point of view, or from the leg-side to the off-side for a right-handed batsman. Some of the most successful wrist spinners include Shane Warne from Australia, Anil Kumble from India and Rashid Khan from Afghanistan.

Left-handed wrist spinners, who are much rarer than right-handed wrist-spinners, are called Left-arm unorthodox spin bowlers. This form of delivery was often termed a chinaman after an early left-arm finger spinner of Chinese descent, Ellis Achong, who sometimes bowled wrist spinners as a variation while playing for the West Indies. This term has fallen out of fashion. A ball delivered in this way will spin from the off-side to the leg-side for a right-handed batsman. Paul Adams and Tabraiz Shamsi of South Africa, as well as Kuldeep Yadav from India, are the best-known recent left-arm unorthodox bowlers. Former Australian one-day all-rounder Brad Hogg is another exponent of left-arm wrist-spin, as were his teammates Simon Katich and Beau Casson.

===Finger spin===

Finger spinners make use of their fingers to rotate the ball. A right-arm finger spinner is known as an off-spinner and their mode of bowling is known as off break. The ball will appear to move just as the left-arm unorthodox ball does, from off to leg for a right-handed batsman. Muttiah Muralitharan (often called &quot;Murali&quot;) of Sri Lanka and Graeme Swann of England, two of the most successful bowlers in Test and ODI cricket history, are off-spinners. Murali&#x27;s bowling style is unique, while Swann&#x27;s is more conventional. Indian Ravichandran Ashwin and Pakistanis Saqlain Mushtaq and Saeed Ajmal are amongst contemporary bowlers of this type, who also employ this bowling style. Saqlain Mushtaq invented a new delivery with this style of bowling called &quot;Doosra&quot;, this delivery is bowled with almost same action as off break however it spins like a leg break or goes straight on with the angle of the delivery. This delivery has become one of the most effective deliveries in an off spin bowler&#x27;s variety of deliveries, but in recent times, many off-spinners have been reported for throwing as a result of bowling the doosra. This delivery has been employed by other famous bowlers after Saqlain Mushtaq, such as Murali and Saeed Ajmal. Another type of delivery, the carrom ball, was invented in the 1940s but largely vanished by the 1970s before being revived in the early 21st century by Sri Lanka&#x27;s Ajantha Mendis; Ashwin also uses this delivery as a second style.

Almost all left-handed bowlers are finger spinners. As a result, this style has no fixed name and the bowling mode is simply known as (slow) left-arm orthodox. The ball turns like a leg break, from leg to off. Shakib Al Hasan of Bangladesh, New Zealand&#x27;s Daniel Vettori, Sri Lanka&#x27;s Rangana Herath, and Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja from India employ this bowling style.

==&quot;Mixed&quot; bowlers==
A bowler equally skilled in both types of bowling is known as a mixed bag or an all round bowler. Such bowlers are rare. The great West Indian all rounder Sir Garfield Sobers bowled effectively in the left-arm fast-medium, left-arm orthodox, and left-arm unorthodox styles. Sachin Tendulkar, known primarily as a batsman, bowled right arm medium fast in his starting days and later changed his bowling style into both right arm leg break and off break.

==Abbreviations==
Bowling styles are often abbreviated in scorecards as follows :

<text>Salvador Novo López (July 30, 1904 – January 13, 1974) was a Mexican writer, poet, playwright, translator, television presenter, entrepreneur, and the official chronicler of Mexico City. As a noted intellectual, he influenced popular perceptions of politics, media, the arts, and Mexican society in general. He was a member of the Mexican modernist writers&#x27; group &quot;Los Contemporáneos&quot;, as well as of the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua.

==Life and career==
In spite of the machismo and conservative Catholicism prevalent in 20th-century Mexico, Novo was openly homosexual. As a result, he was referred to by the literary prodigy Luis Spota as &quot;Nalgador Sobo&quot;, a spoonerism that roughly translates to &quot;butt groper&quot;. This elicited a riposte from Novo, who published an epigram mocking Spota&#x27;s surname. The feud reportedly culminated in a fist fight between the two writers during a performance at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, after which they were both arrested.

Nevertheless, Novo was accepted by the Mexican government, for whom he worked in official posts related to culture. He was elected to the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua and had a television program on Mexico City&#x27;s history. Towards the end of his life, he dyed his hair a bright carrot color and wore many ostentatious rings and colored suits. He has been compared to Oscar Wilde, but unlike Wilde, Novo never suffered the setback of scandal or persecution and remained a respected member of high society and governmental circles until his death. In fact, some sectors resented the fact that a gay writer would align himself so closely with the government and media after the repression of social movements in the 1960s and 1970s.

The street on which he lived was renamed after him when he assumed the role of Mexico City&#x27;s official chronicler, a post held for life.

<text>Hurricane Alex was one of the northernmost major hurricanes on record, and whose formation marked the fifth-latest start to an Atlantic hurricane season since 1952. The first named storm, hurricane, and major hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Alex developed from the interaction between an upper-level low and a weak surface trough on July 31 to the east of Jacksonville, Florida. It moved northeastward, and strengthened to attain winds of before passing within of the Outer Banks coast. Alex strengthened further and reached a peak of winds while off the coast of New England, one of only six hurricanes to reach Category 3 status north of 38° N. Alex caused a scare of a hurricane-force direct hit in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which had been devastated by Hurricane Isabel less than a year earlier.

The hurricane produced light damage in the Outer Banks, primarily from flooding and high winds. Over 100 houses were damaged, while numerous cars were disabled from the flooding. Damage totaled about $7.5 million (2004 USD). Alex produced strong waves and rip tides along the East Coast of the United States, causing one death and several injuries.

==Meteorological history==

A weak surface trough, located to the west of an upper-level low, developed convection to the east of the Bahamas on July 26. A tropical wave entered the area two days later, resulting in an increase of convective organization and area. Although conditions were not favorable for tropical cyclone formation, it sped to the northwest and steadily organized, developing a surface area of low pressure on the 30th. On July 31, the system continued to organize, and developed into Tropical Depression One while located to the east of Jacksonville, Florida.

As the depression drifted erratically, the system remained weak due to its large circulation and lack of deep convection near the center. The center relocated to the south, closer to the center. An approaching upper-level trough lessened the shear over the system, allowing the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Alex on August 1. The trough also caused Alex to increase its forward motion to the northeast. Deep convection continued to build over the center due to low shear and warm waters from the Gulf Stream, and Alex intensified into a hurricane on August 3 while located southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The cyclone continued to strengthen, and attained Category 2 status just hours after becoming a hurricane. The hurricane approached the Outer Banks of North Carolina, coming within of Cape Hatteras later on the 3rd. The western portion of the eyewall passed over the Outer Banks, though the center remained offshore.

Alex turned to the east-northeast after passing the Outer Banks in response to becoming embedded within the west-southwesterly flow. The hurricane briefly weakened to a Category 1, but restrengthened due to warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Water temperatures remained above normal, resulting in Alex intensifying into a major hurricane on August 5 while located south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Due to low vertical shear and favorable conditions, Alex remained a Category 3 hurricane until passing over cooler waters late on the 5th while south of Newfoundland. Alex rapidly weakened, degrading into tropical storm status on August 6. Later on the 6th, Alex became extratropical while east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and lost its identity shortly thereafter.

==Preparations==
Initially, forecasters believed Alex would remain weak, and on the first advisory the storm was predicted to make landfall as a minimal tropical storm. However, when strengthening became evident, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning from Cape Lookout to Oregon Inlet about 20 hours before hurricane conditions were experienced. In addition, a tropical storm warning existed for much of the North Carolina coastline as Alex paralleled the state.

Despite Tropical Storm Warnings, 3,500 tourists remained on the Outer Banks, though many planned to leave if Alex were to track closer or become stronger. No evacuations were ordered. Officials recommended residents to take precautions for the approaching hurricane. The National Weather Service in Morehead City issued a flash flood watch a day before the hurricane moved past the Outer Banks. The service also issued flash flooding warnings for Craven and Carteret Counties on the day of the hurricane&#x27;s closest approach. In preparation for the hurricane, the Cape Lookout National Seashore was closed and evacuated. The National Park Service also closed Cape Point Campground.

==Impact==
While drifting off the coast of Florida, Alex produced rip currents and strong waves along the North Carolina coast resulting in nine lifeguard rescues from the surf. Upon moving by the Outer Banks, a storm surge of up to occurred on the Pamlico Sound side of Buxton and Ocracoke Village. The flooding on Ocracoke Island was the worst since Hurricane Gloria nineteen years earlier. Elsewhere on the Outer Banks, waters rose above normal. Rainfall directly along the coast amounted to over , while Ocracoke experienced . Maximum sustained winds peaked at , and gusts peaked at in Morehead City. Beach erosion was minor along much of North Carolina&#x27;s coastline, with the exception of Ocracoke Island where erosion was significant.

Cape Fear experienced minor beach erosion. The erosion, combined with high waves, washed out a portion of a roadway. The heavy rainfall in the Outer Banks disabled over 200 cars and flooded nearly 500. Strong wind gusts left around 10,000 buildings without power. Many places were not restored for two to three days after the storm. Wind and storm surge damaged over 100 houses and buildings. Damage amounted to about $7.5 million (2004 USD). Two days after the storm passed, a man drowned off of Nags Head from strong rip currents and waves. This was the only direct casualty from the storm.

Alex&#x27;s outer rainbands produced heavy rainfall across Virginia, peaking at over in the center of the state. The rainfall caused localized flooding, but there was no reported damage in the state. In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, rip currents produced by the storm injured three people. A few young children had to be rescued when they were trapped by a jetty. In New Jersey, the strong surf and rip currents hospitalized at least five swimmers.

Alex&#x27;s extratropical remnants sank the Pink Lady, a rowboat carrying four British rowers attempting to break the record for fastest crossing from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland to Falmouth, Cornwall. They were rescued by a Danish cargo ship, and injuries were limited to a mild concussion and a case of hypothermia. The rowers were roughly two weeks and from their destination. The group had been on track to break the 1896 record of 54 days by 10 days.

==Aftermath and records==

On Ocracoke Island, officials ordered for the evacuation of the thousands of tourists who stayed, believing that keeping tourists on the island would hinder cleanup efforts. The tourists were evacuated in school buses to Hatteras Island, where they could rent a car if needed. Tourists were also evacuated by ferry to Swan Quarter, in Hyde County, where they boarded school buses and were taken to nearby Washington NC to rent available cars or find accommodations. The island was re-opened to visitors on August 6, three days after the storm passed through. Evacuation was ordered again on Friday of the following week when another storm threatened to hit the Outer Banks, but did not do so. Dare County officials requested aid from the National Guard for the cleanup process. The North Carolina Department of Transportation was ready to clear the roads once the storm exited the area.

Alex marked the fifth-latest start to a hurricane season since 1952. The latest start to a hurricane season since 1952 was Hurricane Anita of the 1977 season, forming on August 29. Alex is only the second hurricane on record to have reached Category 3 strength north of 38°N latitude. The other storm was Hurricane Ellen in the 1973 Atlantic hurricane season; Alex was the stronger of the two. It is also one of only five hurricanes to be at major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) status within Canadian waters since 1950.

<doc id="900517" wikidata="Q2064366" url="?curid=900517" title="Cecilia Reyes">
<text>Cecilia Reyes is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Scott Lobdell and Carlos Pacheco, the character first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #65 (June 1997). She belongs to the subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities.

Raised in the Bronx by her Puerto Rican family, she is a medical doctor specializing in trauma surgery. She has the mutant ability to project a force field around her body. Unlike most X-Men, she has no interest in superheroics and desires only to live an ordinary life, having been forced into the team by circumstance. Cecilia Reyes was briefly a member of the X-Men and often works to assist them.

==Publication history==

Created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Carlos Pacheco, she first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #65 (June 1997).

==Fictional character biography==
Cecilia Reyes decided to become a doctor when her father was gunned down in front of her as a child, and she was unable to do anything to help him. The X-Men tried recruiting her when it was discovered that she was a mutant, but Reyes had no interest in being a superhero. She preferred to pursue her trauma surgeon career.

=== Operation Zero Tolerance ===
When she was targeted by &quot;&quot;, a government-backed anti-mutant task force, she was forced to join forces with the X-Man Iceman and other mutants to escape New York City and track down Bastion, leader of Operation Zero Tolerance.

After meeting with problems with racism and both encouragement from Daredevil and an encounter with the villain Pyro, Reyes reluctantly joined the X-Men. Her first adventure involved saving Cyclops from a nanotech deep inside his body, which threatened to kill him, Reyes, other X-Men and obliterate anything in a three-mile radius. Despite having absolutely no medical supplies, she improvised in her successful attempt. For example, she had Storm use lightning to boil buckets of water. Afterwards, a dazed Cyclops offers her honorary X-Men status. She has several adventures with the team, combating the Ru&#x27;tai and the Shadow King. She usually did not bother with a costume, wearing either the yellow and blue training uniform or, on one occasion as a joke by Beast, an old costume of Wasp&#x27;s. It was while wearing Wasp&#x27;s old uniform that Reyes became involved in a battle with the X-Men&#x27;s frequent enemy, the N&#x27;Garai, interdimensional demons. Reyes mostly ran away, but was saved (and mocked) by the X-Man rookie Marrow. She was eventually sucked into the N&#x27;Garai dimension, to be experimented upon, but her force field saved her from the cutting instruments. She escaped with the rest of the X-Men and the civilians they had saved.

Reyes was tempted by the Shadow King by offers of a new life, but managed to resist the villain&#x27;s offer. Reyes did not find costumed adventuring suitable for her, and left to set up her own medical practice.

Later, she was caught up in the X-Men&#x27;s battle with the Neo, a villainous group of mutants who claimed to have evolved beyond the level of other mutants. Reyes was trapped in the Neo&#x27;s fortress below New York City and used a street drug called Rave to make her mutant powers more destructive, ensuring her survival. The X-Men rescued her, and the telepathic Professor X helped her kick her addiction to Rave during a detox period back at the X-Mansion.

Reyes last appearance with the X-Men was at the time when Beast discovered the cure to the Legacy Virus. She was the one to discover Colossus dead after injecting himself with the cure. Reyes attempted to revive him, but was unsuccessful.

===Neverland===
Later, she was seen as a prisoner at a mutant concentration camp run by the Weapon X program, called Neverland. There she attempted to use her medical expertise to help out the other prisoners. She was apparently killed off panel when a brainwashed Agent Zero destroyed the camp, and her death was later confirmed in the letter column of &quot;New Excalibur&quot; #1. Mike Marts contradicted this in an interview on uncannyxmen.net, stating that if Cecilia would be dead they would show it on panel, and therefore Cecilia was not yet considered deceased at that time.

In &quot;X-Men: The 198 Files&quot;, it has been revealed that Cecilia&#x27;s older non-mutant brother, Colonel Miguel Reyes, had been assigned to head O*N*E security on the Xavier School grounds, with the purpose of finding out the fate of his sister.

===Return===
After M-Day and her escape from Neverland, Cecilia volunteers at local homeless shelters as well as working out of her apartment. According to Bobby Soul, she works off the record and under the table. The NYX teenagers bring an injured Tatiana to her for help. During their visit to her apartment she does not reveal to the teens that she used to be an X-Man. After treating Tatiana, she offers them a place to rest while she goes out for a few hours. Unaware Kiden Nixon is following her, she calls up Beast to ask a favor. Later when Cecilia returns with groceries, she finds the teens have left.

Sometime after these events, Cecilia moves to the X-Men&#x27;s new base of operations; Utopia. When Magneto decides to bring back Shadowcat as a good will gesture, Cyclops asks specifically for her to help treat him of any injuries he might have suffered.

===The Five Lights===
After the events of Second Coming, Cecilia is partnered with Psylocke and sent to Mexico to locate the second of the Five Lights; the first mutants to manifest powers since M-Day. After sedating Gabriel, she informs his parents of what is transpiring and offers him help from the X-Men. Psylocke comes to the room and explains that something has happened, Gabriel&#x27;s manifesting speed powers caused him to move so fast he is invisible to the naked eye. Psylocke taps into Cecilia&#x27;s powers to create a force field around his room so they would not lose him before Hope Summers could arrive to help.

===X-23===
Gambit and X-23 arrive in New York City following a lead from London. Gambit is injured, with his wounds reopening later on. They visit Cecilia at her apartment, and she agrees to give Gambit stitches, but is perturbed at being disturbed and admits she left Utopia to avoid such &quot;stupidity&quot;. X-23 picks up the scents of her friends from NYX in the apartment, and asks where they are. Cecilia states that she gave them permission to stay there before she went to Utopia, but they were gone by the time she returned. X-23 leaves to pursue a lead, and the city is soon rocked by a mysterious earthquake. Cecilia and Gambit help rescue and treat quake victims. Cecilia then accompanies Gambit as he searches for X-23, eventually finding her recovering in the care of the Future Foundation.

===Fear Itself===
During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Cecilia is added to a team of X-Men opposing the &quot;worthy&quot; empowered Juggernaut in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone. She is instructed by Cyclops to protect a mob of anti-mutant protesters following Kuurth&#x27;s attack.

===Astonishing X-Men===
Although she is still more comfortable healing humans than fighting superhumans, Cecilia Reyes is part of the new team composed by Wolverine. Alongside Northstar, Iceman, Beast, Gambit and Warbird, she assists to Northstar&#x27;s wedding and tries to help Karma, whose mind has been taken over Ms. Hatchi for yet unknown reasons. She is also carrying on a romantic relationship with Gambit.

===Dawn of X===
In the new status quo for mutants post &quot;House of X and Powers of X&quot;, Professor X and Magneto invite all mutants to live on Krakoa and welcome even former enemies into their fold. Cecilia Reyes becomes something of a medical expert on mutant biology, running medical operations, autopsies and the like. She is also approached by Prodigy of X-Factor with a suggestion to build a body farm to study the effects of decomposition on mutant bodies.

==Powers and abilities==
Cecilia can generate a force field described as a &quot;psioplasmic bio-field&quot; around her body. This force field provides superhuman durability, increasing her resistance to energy and physical attacks. She can shape or expand it to protect those nearby. Impacts on the force field cause Cecilia pain. She also has shown the ability to wield her forcefield as a blunt force, pushing others out of her way. She can create spikes which could punch through a human body. Under the effects of the mutant-enhancing drug Rave, Cecilia is able to use her force field offensively, as a blade to attack enemies. The field can be raised consciously and in her initial appearances, shown triggered by any external force used against it.

Additionally, Cecilia is a capable medical doctor and surgeon.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Marc Buxton of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; said, &quot;Dr. Cecilia Reyes has a really cool power, the ability to cast a force field that can protect herself or others, but the true specialness of the character is her desire to be a doctor instead of a superhero. Reyes is the X-Men’s most skilled healer, a woman who seeks true service as a medical professional rather than an adventuring crusader. Reyes is one of the most underutilized but humane of all the X-Men, a woman who has a clear sense of identity and purpose beyond throwing down with Unus, the Untouchable.&quot; Karen M. Walsh, in the book &quot;Geek Heroines&quot; (2019), also commented on Reyes offering a &quot;unique representation of a mutant and an empowering female Puerto Rican doctor&quot; who finds her place based on her medical and intellectual skills instead of her mutant abilities. Walsh opined that while the character is often &quot;peripheral&quot; in the X-Men line, &quot;she is meaningful as a superheroine in many ways&quot;. Walsh highlighted Marjorie Liu&#x27;s inclusion of Reyes in &quot;&quot; – the X-Men often act as stand-ins for the &quot;struggles marginalized groups face in society&quot; so Liu&#x27;s portrayal of Reyes as &quot;a mutant defined by something other than her mutant powers offers an important perspective&quot;. Walsh commented that token characters from marginalized groups often &quot;exist solely as representations of their cultures. By focusing on Reyes&#x27; full self, &quot;NYX&quot; offered a twice-marginalized character—Latinx and Mutant—whose sense of self arose out of her choices rather than how she was born. By giving her agency, Liu&#x27;s story expanded the way in which marginalized characters are written&quot;.

==Norway==

Owing to the speed and surprise achieved by the German forces, the Norwegian army was only able to partially mobilize. Unit strengths were only a fraction of their paper establishments.

Unlike the armies of most other nations, the Norwegian &quot;division&quot; was more of an administrative and mobilization unit, rather than a fighting formation. The most important tactical unit of the Norwegian army was the regiment. When mobilized, each regiment was supposed to muster two battalions of infantry of the line, and one battalion of &quot;landvern&quot;. Some of the Norwegian forces were &quot;ad hoc&quot; battalions.

The commander of the Norwegian Army at the time of the invasion was General Kristian Laake. He was replaced by Colonel Otto Ruge on 11 April.

Each Regiment had 3,750 soldiers, with 60,000 being the total number of soldiers by 1940. Every battalion had around 1,250 soldiers. However, only 55,000 soldiers were well prepared.

===Norwegian Army===
*The Royal Guards battalion – based in Oslo and Elverum, the only unit in Southern Norway that received proper training during the inter-war years.
*1st Division – This division had its headquarters in Halden, and was commanded by Major-General Carl Johan Erichsen.

**14th Infantry Regiment 
**15th Infantry Regiment 
**16th Infantry Regiment 
:During the campaign, the 6th Division formed two light infantry brigades. The 6th Brigade was initially commanded by Colonel Kristian Løken, and from 9 May by Lieutenant Colonel Ole Berg, and the 7th Brigade, commanded by Colonel Wilhelm Faye.

*The Oslo battalion of the Royal Guards
*4 regiments of the 1st and 2nd Divisions
*3 battalions of the 3rd Division
*5 battalion for the 4th Division
*Only about 2 battalions and a company of 5th Division

<text>Mark Scott Travis (born September 6, 1961) is an American musician, best known as the drummer for the British heavy metal band Judas Priest, the Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, and the supergroup Elegant Weapons. He was also a longtime member of the American heavy metal band Racer X during their initial run and then reformation up until their 2009 breakup.

As a member of Judas Priest, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022.

== Biography ==
Born in Norfolk, Virginia, Travis was a well-known drummer in the local music scene of a region known as Hampton Roads during the early 1980s. Playing with bands in clubs throughout Norfolk, Virginia Beach, and Newport News. Travis moved to California in the early to mid-1980s and performed in various local bands, such as Hawk, later moving on to perform for the critically acclaimed band Racer X, and very briefly performed in Saints Or Sinners, which later changed their name to The Scream, and also featured Travis&#x27;s Racer X bandmates Bruce Bouillet and Juan Alderete. His big career move came about late in the decade after Judas Priest&#x27;s longtime drummer Dave Holland left the band in 1989, citing personal reasons.

Travis had always wanted to be the drummer of Judas Priest. As a teenager, he had often thought about setting up his drum kit in the parking lot at the Hampton Coliseum in hopes that the band would notice him as they went past with their tour bus. He finally decided to wait at the back of the arena to hand the band a tape of his playing. Holland was still the band&#x27;s drummer at the time, so nothing ever came out of the encounter. When Holland did leave Judas Priest in 1989, vocalist Jeff Martin heard about it through his friendship with Rob Halford. Martin called up Travis one day and said, &quot;Guess who needs a drummer.&quot; Travis auditioned for the vacant position and became their new member, thus becoming the first non-Briton to perform for the band. He has been with the band ever since and also handles drum duties for Racer X as well. Travis also performed drums in Halford&#x27;s band Fight from 1992 to 1995, but to date, he is best known for his work with Judas Priest, for which he has been widely acclaimed ever since his debut on the 1990 album &quot;Painkiller&quot;.

Travis was largely responsible for hiring Tim &#x27;Ripper&#x27; Owens as Halford&#x27;s replacement in Judas Priest in 1996. Owens would remain in the band until the 2003 reunion with Halford.

Travis takes credit as the co-writer for the song &quot;Cyberface&quot;, which appears on Judas Priest&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Demolition&quot;, making it his first and only contribution in the band.

In April 2016, Travis joined the reformed line-up of Thin Lizzy for reunion shows and has remained in the band as their official member.

He is commonly mistaken to be left-handed. In reality, he is ambidextrous, and plays with an open style. He is 6&#x27;6&quot; tall.

== Equipment ==
Travis always used Tama Drums until 2008. On the first leg of the Judas Priest &quot;Nostradamus Tour&quot; he played a Pearl kit and then switched to a DW kit for the second leg. He was also seen using a DW kit at the NAMM Show with his band Racer X. His DW setup is: two 23&quot;x24&quot; bass drums, 14&quot;x6.5&quot; snare,8&quot;x8&quot; 10&quot;x9&quot; 12&quot;x9&quot; and 14&quot;x10&quot; rack toms and 16&quot;x14&quot; and 18&quot;x16&quot; floor toms. Travis has played Paiste cymbals since May 1987. He also plays Evans drum heads and uses Vater drumsticks.

<text>Ernst Friedrich Poppo (13 August 17946 November 1866), German classical scholar and schoolmaster, was born at Guben in Brandenburg. He studied at Leipzig.

In 1818 he was appointed director of the gymnasium at Frankfurt an der Oder, where he died on 6 November 1866, having resigned his post three years before.

Poppo was an extremely successful teacher and organizer, and in a few years doubled the number of pupils at the gymnasium. He is chiefly known, however, for his exhaustive and complete edition of Thucydides in four parts (11 vols., 1821-1840), containing:
#A &quot;prolegomenon&quot; on Thucydides as an historian and on his language and style (English translation by George Burges, 1837), accompanied by historical and geographical essays
#The text with scholia and critical notes
#A commentary on the text and scholia
#Indices and appendices.
For the ordinary student a smaller edition (1843–1851) was prepared; this edition was revised after the author&#x27;s death by Johann Matthias Stahl (1875–1889).

<text>Gone for Soldiers is a 2000 historical novel by Jeffrey Shaara about the Mexican–American War. It was written as a standalone novel, but could also be seen as a prequel to the Civil War trilogy written by Shaara and his father, Michael Shaara, introducing some of the key protagonists in the campaigns that first won them fame. The action begins with the Battle of Vera Cruz and follows Winfield Scott and his army as they march toward Mexico City, including the Battle of Cerro Gordo and culminating in the Battle of Chapultepec and the fall of Mexico City.

==Style==
Most of the story is told from the perspective of two men, Winfield Scott, commander of the American forces, and Robert E. Lee, who rose to prominence in the war, though some chapters also introduce the perspectives of other characters as well, notably Mexican leader Antonio López de Santa Anna, James Longstreet, Thomas Jackson, and Ulysses S. Grant. It is critical of certain American commanders, including William J. Worth, Gideon Pillow, and David E. Twiggs, portraying them as mostly incompetent soldiers, who were little more than political appointees, while the true heroes were the lower-ranking graduates of the United States Military Academy. This idealistic portrayal of the younger officers as they rose to prominence gives little indication that within just a few years they would meet again on the battlefield in the American Civil War.

<text>George Burges (; 1786 – 11 January 1864) was an English classical scholar who published translations of the works of Euripides, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Plato.

==Biography==
Burges was born in Bengal, India, and was probably the son of Thomas Burges (d.1799) of Calcutta. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his B.A. degree in 1807 and obtaining one of the members&#x27; prizes both in 1808 and 1809 before becoming an M.A. in 1810. He stayed up at Cambridge and became a most successful coach and tutor. He had a great reputation as a Greek scholar, and was a somewhat acrimonious critic of rival scholars, especially Bishop Blomfield.

Subsequently, he fell into embarrassed circumstances through injudicious speculation, and in 1841 a civil list pension of £100 per annum was bestowed upon him. He died at Ramsgate, on 11 January 1864. Burges was a man of great learning and industry, but too fond of introducing arbitrary emendations into the text of classical authors.

==Works==
His chief works are:
*Euripides&#x27; &quot;Troades&quot; (1807) and &quot;Phoenissae&quot; (1809).
*Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Supplices&quot; (1821), &quot;Eumenides&quot; (1822), and &quot;Prometheus&quot; (1831).
*Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Philoctetes&quot; (1833).
*EF Poppo&#x27;s &quot;Prolegomena to Thucydides&quot; (1837), an abridged translation with critical remarks.
*&quot;Hermesianactis Fragmenta&quot; (1839).
He also edited some of the dialogues of Plato with English notes including Meno, Parmenides, Statesman, and The Laws, and translated nearly the whole of that author and the Greek anthology for Bohn&#x27;s Classical library.

He was a frequent contributor to the &quot;Classical Journal&quot; and other periodicals, and also dedicated to Byron a play called &quot;The Son of Erin, or, The Cause of the Greeks&quot; (1823).

==Personal==
Burges married Jane (1801–83) with whom he had six children (3 sons and 3 daughters).

<doc id="900545" wikidata="Q27706" url="?curid=900545" title="Hamburg Airport">
<text>Hamburg Airport () , is a major international airport in Hamburg, the second-largest city in Germany. Since November 2016 the airport has been named after the former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt. It is located north of the city centre in the Fuhlsbüttel quarter and serves as a hub for Eurowings and focus city for Condor. It was formerly named Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel Airport, a name still frequently used.

Hamburg Airport is the fifth-busiest of Germany&#x27;s commercial airports measured by the number of passengers and counted 13.559.732 passengers and 120.315 aircraft movements in 2023. As of July 2017, it featured flights to more than 130 mostly European metropolitan and leisure destinations as well as two long-haul routes to Dubai and Doha. The airport is equipped to handle wide-bodied aircraft including the Airbus A380.

Hamburg&#x27;s other airport, Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport where the Airbus factory is located, is not open to commercial traffic.

==History==
===Early years===


The airport was opened in January 1911 from private funding by the &quot;Hamburger Luftschiffhallen GmbH (HLG)&quot;, making it the oldest international airport in the world to still be in operation and the second oldest airport in the country after Tempelhof Airport. The original site comprised 45 hectares, and during its early days was primarily used for airship flights. In 1913 the site was expanded to 60 hectares, the northern part being used for airship operations while the southeast area was used for fixed-wing aircraft.

During the First World War, the airship hangar was used extensively by the German military, until it was destroyed by fire in 1916.

During the British occupation, beginning in 1945, the airport was given its current name, Hamburg Airport. It was used extensively during the Berlin Airlift in 1948 as a staging area, as the northern air corridor went between Hamburg and West Berlin.

When Lufthansa launched passenger operations in 1955, Hamburg was used as a hub until Frankfurt Airport took over due to growth constraints posed by its location in the city. Lufthansa Technik still maintains a large presence at the airport due to the early activities of the airline at the airport. In October 1959 Pan American World Airways was the first airline to start scheduled service with jet aircraft to Hamburg, the routing was New York – London – Hamburg – Copenhagen flown with Boeing 707.

In the 1960s discussions began with the aim of moving the airport to Heidmoor near Kaltenkirchen. Among the reasons cited were limited expansion possibilities, capacity constraints due to crossing runways, and noise. Lufthansa had introduced the Boeing 707 in 1960, which made more noise than previous piston-engined aircraft. The plans were dropped, owing both to bad experiences in other cities where airports had been moved far from city centres, and to Lufthansa&#x27;s move to Frankfurt.

In 1980 Northwest Orient started flights to Hamburg, originating from Minneapolis with a stop in London Gatwick. In 1981 they introduced a second flight from New York JFK via Copenhagen to Hamburg. All flights were operated with Boeing 747 aircraft. After Northwest Orient received traffic rights to serve Frankfurt they discontinued all flights to Hamburg from early 1985.

In April 1985 Pan American World Airways started a daily non-stop flight from New York JFK to Hamburg, operated with Boeing 747. This was Pan Am&#x27;s first non-stop service from the US to Hamburg. Starting February 1986 Pan Am also used their new long-range Airbus A310-200 on the route, which made it one of the first ETOPS routes across the Atlantic. In 1988 Japan Air Lines suspended their flights from Tokyo to Hamburg after serving the route for 24 years. One year later in 1989 Lufthansa suspended all flights between Hamburg and Tokyo after almost 30 years of service, which was the last route from Hamburg to the far east.

In May 1989 American Airlines started a daily service from New York JFK via Brussels to Hamburg, and Delta Air Lines started a daily service from Atlanta via London Gatwick to Hamburg. American Airlines suspended their service after a year due to shortage of aircraft after the purchase of Eastern Air Lines&#x27; South America routes, Delta upgraded the Atlanta flight to a daily non-stop service with an extension to Berlin-Tegel from May 1991, and also served New York JFK – Hamburg from November 1991 after taking over Pan Am&#x27;s North Atlantic route network.

===Development since the 1990s===
In March 1990 Lufthansa launched a daily flight from Hamburg to Newark and added another non-stop flight to Miami in 1992. This lasted for only one summer season and was then suspended together with the Newark flight in late 1992, which left Delta Air Lines alone in this market with their Atlanta and New York flights. From early 1993 to late 1994 South African Airways operated flights from Cape Town via Johannesburg and Munich to Hamburg. In the mid 90s Delta Air Lines experienced financial troubles and had to consolidate their fleet and route network. Hamburg was among the cities in Europe that were cut completely in late 1995. From 1996 Canada 3000 started summer seasonal flights to Hamburg, and until their bankruptcy in late 2001 they served Toronto to Hamburg via Halifax and Vancouver to Hamburg via Calgary. In May 1998 Delta Air Lines relaunched daily non-stop flights between Atlanta and Hamburg. However this route only operated until early 2000. A combination of a then too large business class in their Boeing 767-300ER aircraft and the foundation of the SkyTeam alliance made Delta cancel this service again.

In the early 1990s, the airport had begun extensive modernisation. The plan, called &quot;HAM21&quot;, included a new pier extension, a new terminal (Terminal 1), and the Airport Plaza between Terminals 1 and 2, which includes a consolidated security area. The airport&#x27;s shareholders are the City of Hamburg and AviAlliance.

In May 2005 airTransat started a seasonal flight between Toronto and Hamburg. In June that year Continental Airlines started a daily non-stop flight between Newark and Hamburg, Emirates started its then daily Dubai to Hamburg service in March 2006. In 2011 China Eastern Airlines added Hamburg to their route network. However, due to the lack of traffic rights they could only add an extension to their existing Shanghai to Frankfurt flights. The flight initially operated once a week only, and was later increased to twice a week. The stop in Frankfurt and the low frequency did not appeal enough to business travellers so China Eastern suspended the route in 2013.

The Radisson Blu Hotel Hamburg Airport was added in 2009, combined with new roadside access and a station with connection to the city&#x27;s rapid transit system (Hamburg S-Bahn).

In January 2016, TUIfly announced it was leaving Hamburg Airport entirely due to increasing competition from low-cost carriers. While the summer seasonal routes would not resume, all remaining destinations were cancelled by March 2016. A few weeks later, it was officially announced that the airport was to be named after Helmut Schmidt, a former senator of Hamburg and chancellor of West Germany. On 10 November 2016, the airport was renamed &quot;Hamburg Airport Helmut Schmidt&quot;.

In October 2016, Air Berlin announced the closure of its maintenance facilities at the airport, due to cost-cutting and restructuring measures.

In June 2017, easyJet announced it would close its base at Hamburg by March 2018 as part of a refocus on other base airports. While over half of the former services were cut, several routes remained in place as they are served from other easyJet bases. In October 2018, United Airlines announced the end of its seasonal service to Newark, leaving the airport with only three long-haul routes, all to the Middle East, and no direct services to North America. The route was inaugurated by Continental Airlines back in 2005 and switched from year-round to seasonal in 2017 Also in October 2018 Emirates switched one of the two daily flights from Dubai to A380-service. This was the first ever commercial A380 service to Hamburg. The second daily flight remains operated by Boeing 777-300ER aircraft.

In January 2020, Ryanair also closed its Hamburg base due to airport operating costs, late delivery of the Boeing 737-Max aircraft, and its general downsizing of its German operations.

==Facilities==

===Overview===
Hamburg Airport originally covered . Since then, the site has grown more than tenfold to . The main apron covers and features 54 parking positions; the passenger terminals provide 17 jet bridges. As of July 2016, the airport had only three routes served with wide-body aircraft; however, during that year three gates were upgraded with double-jet bridges to provide faster boarding and de-boarding for large planes like the Airbus A380. The runways, taxiways and aprons can accommodate large aircraft, including the Airbus A380. Emirates replaced one Boeing 777 with A380 aircraft on the route. On 28 May 2018, Emirates announced it would commence services from Dubai International Airport to Hamburg with the A380.

===Terminals===
Hamburg has two interconnected terminals, Terminal 1 (used by most airlines including those of Oneworld and SkyTeam) and Terminal 2 (Star Alliance), connected by the Airport Plaza and the baggage claim area that extends through the lower levels of all three buildings. In all buildings level 1 is the departure level with overall 44 departure gates, while level 0 is arrivals and also features ten additional bus gates. Hamburg Airport offers 12 baggage claim belts on the arrivals level. The Airport Plaza hosts the central security check as well as shops, restaurants, lounges and other service facilities. It also houses the suburban railway station.

Terminal 2 (despite its name, the older facility) was completed in 1993, Terminal 1 was completed in 2005 and is highly similar to Terminal 2 in terms of design and size. The main buildings were designed by Gerkan, Marg and Partners. Both terminals have a high, curved ceiling designed to emulate the shape of a wing.

==Incidents and accidents==
*On 4–5 November 2023, a hostage incident caused by a custody dispute, wherein an armed man drove onto the tarmac with his 4-year-old daughter in the car, temporarily halted flights at the airport. He parked under a Turkish Airlines aircraft demanding to be allowed on board to fly to Turkey with his daughter. He fired a weapon twice in the air and threw two incendiary devices from his car. Authorities said the commercial flight was preparing to take off, forcing the evacuation of everyone on board through a gangway. The authorities believe the cause was a &quot;custody dispute&quot;. The incident came three weeks after German federal police received an emailed threat of an attack on an Iran Air flight arriving at the airport. The perpetrator was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment by a Hamburg court.

<text>Rizokarpaso ( []; ) is a town on the Karpas Peninsula in the Northeastern part of Cyprus. While nominally part of the Famagusta District of the Republic of Cyprus, it has been under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of Northern Cyprus since the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974, being administered as part of the İskele District.

Rizokarpaso is one of the largest towns on the peninsula. Soil near the town consists of terra fusca, which is very fertile. Local crops include carob, cotton, tobacco, and grain. The town&#x27;s surroundings are renowned for being the wildest and one of the most unspoilt parts of the island. The municipality&#x27;s territory features the Karpaz National Park, home to the Karpass donkey and some of the finest beaches of the island.

The economy is primarily based on agriculture, husbandry, and fisheries. Since 2000, the town has embraced the concept of eco-tourism, and converted old traditional village houses into guesthouses in traditional styles. The area lacks any industrial plants.

==Geography==
Two kilometres north of the town of Rizokarpaso lies the Ayfilon Beach, administered by the municipality as a public beach. The beach takes its name from the Ayios Philon Church in the ancient town of Karpasia, which is located 500 metres away. The beach is a breeding ground for loggerhead sea turtles, and is as such a center of attention for conservationists. It is also billed in tourist guides as a &quot;spot to watch sunsets&quot;. It hosts an annual festival dedicated to sea turtles in August featuring concerts, release of turtle hatchlings, beach clean-ups, and other environmental awareness activities on the beach.

===Climate===
==History==

The Rizokarpaso area contains some of the earliest inhabited places in the island. These include the ancient cities of Karpasia and Aphendrika. It was the seat of one of the largest Lusignan baronies.

In 1222, the Lusignan dynasty ruling the Kingdom of Cyprus, together with the Latin nobility, decided that the traditional Greek Cypriot bishoprics in the urban centres would be abolished. Karpasia was one of the only four Greek bishoprics in the island that were allowed to continue to function (together with Solea, Arsinoe and Lefkara), and in practice subsumed the Bishopric of Famagusta, as the Bishop of Famagusta was sent to Rizokarpaso and continued his work in St. Synesios, the main Orthodox church in the region. This arrangement was formalised by the &quot;Bulla Cypria&quot;, a papal bull issued by Pope Alexander IV in 1260. Despite the official assignment of the bishopric to Karpasia, by then the town had lost the importance it held in the Late Antique period, and it is thought to be &quot;probable&quot; that by 1260 the bishops did not really reside in Karpasia but kept on operating from Famagusta. According to Stefano Lusignan, the town of Rizokarpaso became a part of the feudal estate of the de Nores family, until James II of Cyprus revoked Gauthier de Nores&#x27; rights due to his support of Queen Charlotte, James&#x27; opponent.

The town has two churches: St. Synesios and the church of the Holy Trinity. They are examples of the typical Cypriot mixed style, combining features of the late Gothic introduced by the Lusignans with the late Byzantine style of the Orthodox tradition. These are two of the few Christian churches to operate in the northern part of Cyprus, and has allegedly had services stopped by the Turkish Cypriot police.

Rizokarpaso is partly located in the ancient city of Karpasia on the West coast, according to legend founded by king Pygmalion.

== Demographics ==
Before 1974, the town was predominantly inhabited by Greek-Cypriots. During the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on 20 July 1974, the peninsula was cut off by Turkish troops, and this prevented the town&#x27;s Greek-Cypriot inhabitants from fleeing to the south. As a result, with 250 Greek Cypriot inhabitants, Rizokarpaso is the home of the biggest Greek population in the North. Between 1974 and 1985, however, around 2500 Greek Cypriots left the village. Although the Greek-Cypriot population is now mainly elderly and shrinking in size, they are still supplied by the UN, and Greek-Cypriot products are consequently available in some places. The town was captured by the Turkish Army during the early days of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.

In 1977, Turkish settlers were brought from different areas of Turkey, including Kars, Muş, Diyarbakır and Ağrı in the Eastern Anatolia Region, Mersin and Adana in the Mediterranean Region and Akkuş, Çarşamba, Akçaabat, Sürmene, Araklı and Trabzon in the Black Sea Region. In the 21st century, some Turkish Cypriots and Europeans also bought properties in the village and are now its residents.

== Politics ==
The town has a Turkish Cypriot municipality, whose current mayor is Suphi Coşkun from the Republican Turkish Party. Coşkun won the post in 2014, by winning over 50% of the votes and beating his predecessor, Mehmet Demirci of the National Unity Party.

==Culture and tourism==

Turkish Cypriot &quot;Dipkarpaz Sports Club&quot; was founded in 1978; its football team in 2015 played in Cyprus Turkish Football Association (CTFA) K-PET 2nd League. Education in the town includes a primary school and the &quot;Recep Tayyip Erdogan&quot; Secondary School. The town hosts some small touristic facilities. Twenty kilometres east lies the Golden Beach, a pristine 4 km long beach, and the Apostolos Andreas Monastery.

<text>Edward Valentine Blomfield (14 February 1788 – 9 October 1816) was an English classical scholar and brother of Bishop Charles James Blomfield.

==Life==
Blomfield was born at Bury St Edmunds, the second son of the six children of Charles Blomfield (1763–1831), a schoolmaster (as was E. V. Blomfield&#x27;s grandfather, James Blomfield), JP and chief alderman of Bury St Edmunds, and his wife, Hester (1765–1844), daughter of Edward Pawsey, a Bury grocer.

Edward acquired a high reputation for learning and general accomplishments, being a good modern linguist and draughtsman, as well as a brilliant scholar He was educated under Dr. Becher at the grammar school at Bury St Edmunds, and thence proceeded to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1807.

In 1811, he took his B.A. degree, being placed thirteenth wrangler. 
He had, however, obtained such classical distinctions as were then open to competition ; he was Browne medallist in 1809 and 1810 (in the former year being beaten by one candidate, but receiving a prize of books from the vice-chancellor, Dr. Barnes), members&#x27; prizeman in 1812, and finally first chancellor&#x27;s classical medallist

The fellowships in his own college being full, he was elected to a classical lectureship and fellowship at Emmanuel College, which he retained till his death in 1816. He died from a fever contracted in a long vacation tour in Switzerland in that year. He managed, after being taken ill at Dover, to reach Cambridge, where he died on 3 Oct., and was buried in Emmanuel College Chapel ; in the cloisters of which is a tablet to his memory, with an inscription by his brother, Charles James.

In 1813, he travelled to Germany and made the acquaintance of some of the great scholars of that country. On his return, he published in the &quot;Museum Criticum&quot; (No. ii), an interesting paper on &quot;The Present State of Classical Literature in Germany.&quot;
He died in 1816, his early death depriving Cambridge of one who seemed destined to take a high place amongst her most brilliant classical scholars.

==Work==
His chief work was a translation of Matthiae&#x27;s &quot;Greek Grammar,&quot; a book still unrivalled in its way. He had completed it in the spring of 1816, intending to furnish it with indexes, &amp;c., in the autumn. It was left for his brother Charles James to edit, who prefixed to it a short essay on the virtues and learning of the translator. Edward had met with this book in the course of a tour in Germany, undertaken in 1813, as soon as the events of that year had opened the continent to English travellers. Another fruit of this tour was a paper in the &quot;Museum Criticum&quot; on &quot;The State of Classical Literature in Germany,&quot; a subject which had then become almost unknown in England. Besides a few other papers contributed to the &#x27; Museum &#x27; Blomfield had projected a Greek-English lexicon to take the place of the old Greek-Latin Lexicons of Scapula and Hedericus, which gave needless difficulty to students and were neither full nor accurate. He published a specimen of his &quot;Lexicon&quot;, which was well received, and his plans seem to have been rational and promising.

<doc id="900554" wikidata="Q3517876" url="?curid=900554" title="Tropical Storm Bonnie (2004)">
<text>Tropical Storm Bonnie was a tropical storm that made landfall on Florida in August 2004. The second storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave on August 3 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. After moving through the islands, its fast forward motion caused it to dissipate. However, Bonnie later regenerated into a tropical storm near the Yucatán Peninsula. Bonnie attained its peak intensity with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of 1001 mbar (29.56 inHg) on August 11 while located over the Gulf of Mexico. Afterwards, the storm turned to the northeast and hit Florida with winds of . The storm accelerated to the northeast and became an extratropical cyclone to the east of New Jersey. Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems in the 2004 season to make landfall in Florida, coming ashore the day before Hurricane Charley struck. Bonnie was also the second of a record eight storms to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August.

Bonnie&#x27;s impact was minimal. Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the storm&#x27;s effects consisted primarily of light rainfall, and in Florida, heavy rainfall caused flooding and minor damage. The tropical storm caused a tornado outbreak across the Southeastern United States which killed three people and inflicted over $1 million (2004 USD) in damage.

== Meteorological history ==

The origins of Bonnie were in a tropical wave that emerged from the coast of Africa on July 29 and entered the Atlantic Ocean. It moved westward, attaining convection and a mid-level circulation. Convection steadily increased, and, upon the development of a low-level circulation center, the system organized into Tropical Depression Two on August 3 while east of Barbados. It moved rapidly westward at speeds of up to ; after crossing through the Lesser Antilles on August 4, it degenerated back into a tropical wave.
The tropical wave continued to move rapidly to the west-northwest, until it reached the western Caribbean Sea. While south of Cuba and through the Cayman Islands, the system slowed down to regenerate convection, and it re-developed into a tropical depression on August 8. Operationally, the system was classified a tropical wave until a day later. The depression moved through the Yucatán Channel, and intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie on August 9 while north of the Yucatán Peninsula.

Bonnie continued to the west-northwest; late on August 9, the storm presented a 9-mile (15-km) wide eyewall, a very unusual occurrence in a small and weak tropical storm. Bonnie quickly strengthened while turning to the north, a directional shift caused by a break in the mid-level ridge. The storm briefly weakened late on August 10; it re-strengthened again the following day to attain a peak intensity of . Soon after, strong southwesterly wind shear disrupted the storm, causing Bonnie to weaken again. On August 12, Bonnie made landfall just south of Apalachicola as a tropical storm. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and accelerated northeastward through the southeastern United States. After paralleling the Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina coastlines, Bonnie lost its tropical characteristics on August 14 to the east of New Jersey. Its remnant low continued northeastward, making landfall in Massachusetts and Maine and continuing into Atlantic Canada.

== Preparations ==
About 16 hours before the storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, the government of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning. Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands issued tropical storm watches. Combined with the threat of Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154 oil platforms and 32 oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2 million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico.

Early forecasts suggested that Bonnie would attain winds or Category 1 status. In response to the threat, 15 shelters in 7 northwestern Florida counties were put on standby. In the hours prior to landfall,2 shelters were opened, 4 were put on standby, and health and cleanup teams were deployed to the area. Parts of Gadsden, Wakulla, and Levy Counties issued voluntary evacuations, and numerous schools were closed. In anticipation of the storm, Florida Governor Jeb Bush issued a state of emergency.

== Impact ==

=== Caribbean Sea ===
As a tropical depression, the storm moved rapidly through the Lesser Antilles; consequently, most islands only experienced minor effects. For example, Saint Lucia received light and sporadic rain showers, accompanied by sustained winds of and gusts to . In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, however, the depression dropped up to of rain in 24 hours. The rainfall blocked storm drains, including those near the airport, which was forced to shut down. The rainfall caused debris to collect on roads throughout the island. Although the storm passed just north of the Yucatán Peninsula, the storm dropped only of rain due to its small size.

=== North America ===

In Florida, Bonnie produced up to of rainfall in Pace, with peak wind gusts of . Bonnie was accompanied by a storm surge; moderate wave action caused slight beach erosion. Rainfall and storm surge flooded roads, forcing the evacuation of 2,000 residents in Taylor County. The winds downed trees and caused scattered power outages. A tornado in Jacksonville damaged several businesses and houses.

Bonnie triggered a tornado outbreak throughout portions of the Mid-Atlantic states. One tornado in Pender County, North Carolina destroyed 17 homes and damaged 59 houses, causing three deaths and $1.27 million in damage (2004 USD). In Stella, Bonnie generated a waterspout that struck a campground, damaged nine trailers, and wrecked small boats. A tornado in Richlands damaged several houses as well. A suspected tornado in Danville, Virginia destroyed the roofs of several businesses. In South Carolina, tornadoes across the state damaged nine homes. Also, rainfall peaking at in Loris caused flooding across the state. The flooding, including a one-foot depth along U.S. Route 501, washed away a road and a bridge in Greenville County. In addition, 600 people across the state were left without electricity.

In Pennsylvania, the remnants of the storm dropped up to of rain in Tannersville. The rainfall caused the Schuylkill River to reach a crest peak of at Berne. The flooding blocked several roads across eastern Pennsylvania. In addition, Bonnie produced gusty winds, leaving thousands without power. In Delaware, the storm dropped up to of rain, forcing 100 to evacuate from the floodwaters. The flooding closed part of U.S. Route 13, and an overflown creek in New Castle County caused moderate flooding damage to stores. In Maine, moisture from the remnants of Bonnie produced heavy rainfall, with localized totals of up to . The rainfall flooded or washed out roads across the eastern portion of the state. In Aroostook County, near the town of St. Francis, the rainfall caused a mudslide which narrowed a county road to one lane.

As an extratropical low combined with a frontal system, Bonnie continued to produce moderate rainfall in Canada, peaking at in Edmundston, New Brunswick. The rainfall caused basement flooding and road washouts; slick roads caused a traffic fatality in Edmundston.

== Aftermath and records ==
Twenty-two hours after Bonnie struck Florida, Hurricane Charley passed over the Dry Tortugas. This was the first time in recorded history that two tropical storms struck Florida within 1 day. Previously, Hurricane Gordon and Tropical Storm Helene struck the state within five days of each other in September 2000. Originally, it was thought that two storms in the 1906 season hit the state within 12 hours; however, the suspected tropical storm was determined to be a tropical depression in a more recent analysis. Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall in Florida during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August.

Because Bonnie hit Florida immediately before Charley, damage between the two storms was often difficult to differentiate. President George W. Bush responded to the storm by declaring much of Florida a Federal Disaster Area on August 13, 2004.

<text>August Heinrich Matthiae (25 December 1769 – 6 January 1835) was a German classical scholar.

==Biography==
He was born at Göttingen, and educated at the university. He then spent some years as a tutor in Amsterdam. In 1798 he returned to the Holy Roman Empire, and in 1802 was appointed director of the Friedrichsgymnasium at Altenburg, which post he held till his death. His biography was written by his son Constantin, with the title &quot;A. Matthiä in seinem Leben und Wirken&quot;, etc. (1845).

==Works==
Of his numerous important works the best-known are:
* &quot;A copious Greek grammar&quot;, translated into English by V Blomfield, edited by John Kenrick (1832).

<text>Dionysius Periegetes (, literally Dionysius the Voyager or Traveller, often Latinized to &quot;Dionysius Periegeta&quot;), also known as Dionysius of Alexandria or Dionysius the African, was the author of a description of the then-known world in Greek hexameter verse. He is believed to have been from Alexandria and to have lived around the time of Hadrian (r. 117–138), though some date his lifetime as late as the end of the 3rd century.

The work enjoyed popularity in ancient times as a schoolbook. It was translated into Latin by Rufius Festus Avienius, and by the grammarian Priscian. Archbishop Eustathius of Thessalonica wrote a commentary on his work for John Doukas.

<text>Jared Tristan Padalecki (born July 19, 1982) is an American actor. He is best known for playing the role of Sam Winchester in the TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot;. He rose to fame in the early 2000s after appearing on the television series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000–2005) as well as the films &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (2003), &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot; (2004), &quot;Cry Wolf&quot; (2005) and &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (2009).

==Early life and education==
Padalecki was born in San Antonio, Texas to Gerald and Sherri Padalecki. His father is of Polish descent, while his mother has German, Scottish, French, and English ancestry.

He was a 2000 candidate for the Presidential Scholars Program. In 1998, Padalecki and his partner Chris Cardenas won the National Forensic League national championship in Duo Interpretation. Although he had originally planned to attend the University of Texas after graduating from high school in 2000, Padalecki decided to move to Los Angeles County, California instead to pursue an acting career.

==Career==

Padalecki won Fox Broadcasting&#x27;s 1999 &quot;Claim to Fame Contest&quot;; he subsequently appeared at the Teen Choice Awards, where he met an agent. His first role was a minor role in the 1999 film &quot;A Little Inside&quot;. In 2000, he was cast as Dean Forester on the television series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, a role he played until 2005. Throughout the early 2000s, he appeared in several made-for-television films, including &quot;Silent Witness&quot;, &quot;Close to Home&quot; and the Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot;.

Padalecki had an uncredited role as a high school bully in 2003&#x27;s comedy &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, which he played after being asked by fellow actor and friend Tom Welling, who played Charlie Baker, and the director of the movie, who wanted someone larger than Charlie to pick on him. Padalecki originally auditioned for Welling&#x27;s role, but gave it up in order to film a pilot titled &quot;Young MacGyver&quot; which was never picked up.

In 2004, he appeared in the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen comedy &quot;New York Minute&quot; as Trey Lipton, a cute boy to whom the Olsens&#x27; characters are attracted. He also landed a short role in the thriller &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot; alongside Dennis Quaid and Hugh Laurie. In 2005, Padalecki starred opposite Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray and Paris Hilton in &quot;House of Wax&quot; as Wade. In 2005, he appeared in &quot;Cry Wolf&quot;, another horror film, as Tom.
Also in 2005, Padalecki was cast as Sam Winchester on the WB series, &quot;Supernatural&quot;. The show ended in 2020, after fifteen seasons, making it the longest-running North American sci-fi series in history.

In 2007, Jared served as the host of MTV&#x27;s horror reality series, &quot;Room 401&quot;, which was discontinued after only eight episodes due to poor ratings.

He had the lead role in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Cottage&quot; as Thomas Kinkade, alongside acclaimed actor Peter O&#x27;Toole.

He also had the lead role in the 2009 version of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; as Clay Miller, a character who heads out to Camp Crystal Lake in search of his sister who has gone missing.

In September 2019, Padalecki was announced as the title role in &quot;Walker&quot;, a reboot series of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; in development at The CW. The reboot was ordered to series in January 2020 and premiered in January 2021. The series was cancelled in 2024 after four seasons. A month later, Padalecki agreed to guest star on &quot;The Boys&quot;, the Amazon Prime Video superhero drama helmed by &quot;Supernatural&quot; creator, Eric Kripke. In August 2024, it was announced that Padalecki would join the cast of &quot;Fire Country&quot; for a three episode guest stint with the possibility of headlining a spinoff.

==Personal life==
Padalecki&#x27;s engagement to his &quot;Supernatural&quot; co-star Genevieve Cortese was announced in January 2010. They met when Cortese guest-starred as Ruby on the show&#x27;s fourth season. Padalecki proposed to her in front of their favorite painting, &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, by French realist Jules Bastien-Lepage at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art in October 2009. The pair married on February 27, 2010, in Cortese&#x27;s hometown of Sun Valley, Idaho. They have three children.

Padalecki supported Beto O&#x27;Rourke for the 2018 Senate election in Texas alongside &quot;Supernatural&quot; co-stars Jensen Ackles and Misha Collins

===Always Keep Fighting===
In March 2015, Padalecki launched his Always Keep Fighting campaign through Represent.com. His first campaign raised funds for To Write Love on Her Arms, which supports people struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury and suicide. The cause is particularly close to Padalecki, who has been candid about his own struggles with depression. For the second campaign in the Always Keep Fighting series in April 2015, Padalecki partnered with co-star Jensen Ackles to release a shirt featuring both of their faces, to benefit their newly formed joint charitable fund. Over 70,000 shirts were sold. Later, Padalecki launched a third campaign selling a further 40,000 shirts.

During San Diego Comic-Con 2015, more than 6,000 fans surprised Padalecki at the &quot;Supernatural&quot; panel by holding up candles for him, after having revealed his battle with depression earlier in the year.

<text>Claude-Louis Navier (born Claude Louis Marie Henri Navier; ; 10 February 1785 – 21 August 1836) was a French Civil engineer, affiliated with the French government, and a physicist who specialized in continuum mechanics.

The Navier–Stokes equations refer eponymously to him, with George Gabriel Stokes.

==Biography==

After the death of his father in 1793, Navier&#x27;s mother left his education in the hands of his uncle Émiland Gauthey, an engineer with the Corps of Bridges and Roads &quot;(Corps des Ponts et Chaussées)&quot;. In 1802, Navier enrolled at the École polytechnique, and in 1804 continued his studies at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, from which he graduated in 1806. He eventually succeeded his uncle as &quot;Inspecteur general&quot; at the Corps des Ponts et Chaussées.

He directed the construction of bridges at Choisy, Asnières and Argenteuil in the Department of the Seine, and built a footbridge to the Île de la Cité in Paris. His 1824 design for the Pont des Invalides failed to leave a safety margin on top of his calculations, and after cracking the bridge had to be dismantled, destroying Navier&#x27;s bridge-building reputation. He was chastised by a government committee for relying too much on mathematics.

In 1824, Navier was admitted into the French Academy of Science. In 1830, he took up a professorship at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, and in the following year succeeded the exiled Augustin Louis Cauchy as professor of calculus and mechanics at the École polytechnique.

==Contributions==

Navier formulated the general theory of elasticity in a mathematically usable form (1821), making it available to the field of construction with sufficient accuracy for the first time. In 1819 he succeeded in determining the &quot;zero line&quot; of mechanical stress, finally correcting Galileo Galilei&#x27;s incorrect results, and in 1826 he established the elastic modulus as a property of materials independent of the second moment of area. Navier is therefore often considered to be the founder of modern structural analysis.
His major contribution, however, remains the Navier–Stokes equations (1822), central to fluid mechanics.

His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<text>Edgar Daniel Nixon (July 12, 1899 – February 25, 1987), known as E. D. Nixon, was an American civil rights leader and union organizer in Alabama who played a crucial role in organizing the landmark Montgomery bus boycott there in 1955. The boycott highlighted the issues of segregation in the South, was upheld for more than a year by black residents, and nearly brought the city-owned bus system to bankruptcy. It ended in December 1956, after the United States Supreme Court ruled in the related case, &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot; (1956), that the local and state laws were unconstitutional, and ordered the state to end bus segregation.

A longtime organizer and activist, Nixon was president of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Montgomery Welfare League, and the Montgomery Voters League. At the time, Nixon already led the Montgomery branch of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters union, known as the Pullman Porters Union, which he had helped organize.

Martin Luther King Jr. described Nixon as &quot;one of the chief voices of the Negro community in the area of civil rights,&quot; and &quot;a symbol of the hopes and aspirations of the long oppressed people of the State of Alabama.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Edgar D. Nixon was born on July 12, 1899, in rural, majority-black Lowndes County, Alabama to Wesley M. Nixon and Sue Ann Chappell Nixon. As a child, Nixon received 16 months of formal education, as black students were ill-served in the segregated public school system. His mother died when he was young, and he and his seven siblings were reared among extended family in Montgomery. His father was a Baptist minister.

After working in a train station baggage room, Nixon rose to become a Pullman car porter, which was a well-respected position with good pay. He was able to travel around the country and worked steadily. He worked with them until 1964. In 1928, he joined the new union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, helping organize its branch in Montgomery. He also served as its president for many years.

==Marriage and family==
Nixon married Alease Curry on August 21, 1927 in Montgomery, Alabama. She died in 1934. They had a son, Edgar Daniel Nixon Jr. (1928–2011), who became an actor known by the stage name of Nick LaTour. Nixon later remarried, to Arlet Campbell, in Florida. She was with him during many of the civil rights events.

==Civil rights activism==

Years before the Montgomery bus boycott, Nixon had worked for voting rights and civil rights for African Americans in Montgomery. Like other blacks in the state, they had been essentially disenfranchised since the start of the 20th century by changes in the Alabama state constitution and electoral laws. He also served as an unelected advocate for the African-American community, helping individuals negotiate with white officeholders, policemen, and civil servants.

In 1943, Nixon and lawyer Arthur Madison founded the Alabama Voters League to encourage African Americans to apply for voter registration, at a time when African Americans were generally excluded from voting in the South using highly subjective rules. Nixon organized an event on June 12, 1944, in which up to 750 African Americans marched to the Montgomery County courthouse and attempted to register to vote, to protest Madison&#x27;s disbarment over the voter registration campaign he conducted as part of this organization. Nixon himself gained voter registration in 1945.

Nixon was a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), becoming president of the Montgomery chapter in 1945 and, in 1947, president of the state organization.

In 1954, he was the first black to run for a seat on the county Democratic Executive Committee. The next year, he questioned the Democratic candidates for the Montgomery City Commission on their positions on civil rights issues.

==Challenging bus segregation==

In the early 1950s, Nixon and Jo Ann Robinson, president of the Women&#x27;s Political Council, decided to mount a court challenge to the discriminatory seating practices on Montgomery&#x27;s municipal buses, along with a boycott of the bus company. A Montgomery ordinance reserved the front seats on these buses for white passengers only, forcing African-American riders to sit in the back. The middle section was available to blacks unless the bus became so crowded that white passengers were standing; in that case, blacks were supposed to give up their seats and stand if necessary. Blacks constituted the majority of riders on the city-owned bus system.

Before the activists could mount the court challenge, they needed someone to voluntarily violate the bus seating law and be arrested for it. Nixon carefully searched for a suitable plaintiff. At the same time, some women mounted their own individual challenges. For instance, 15-year-old student Claudette Colvin was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger in March 1955, nine months before Parks&#x27; action.

Nixon rejected Colvin because she became an unwed mother, another woman who was arrested because he did not believe she had the fortitude to see the case through, and a third woman, Mary Louise Smith, because her father was allegedly an alcoholic. (In 1956, Colvin and Smith were among five originally included in the successful case, &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot;, filed on behalf of them specifically and representing black riders who had been treated unjustly on the city buses. See below.)

The final choice was Rosa Parks, the elected secretary of the Montgomery NAACP. Nixon had been her boss, although he said, &quot;Women don&#x27;t need to be nowhere but in the kitchen.&quot; When she asked, &quot;Well, what about me?&quot;, he replied, &quot;I need a secretary and you are a good one.&quot;

On December 1, 1955, Parks entered a Montgomery bus, refused to give up her seat for a white passenger, and was arrested. After being called about Parks&#x27; arrest, Nixon went to bail her out of jail. He arranged for Parks&#x27; friend, Clifford Durr, a sympathetic white lawyer, to represent her. After years of working with Parks, Nixon was certain that she was the ideal candidate to challenge the discriminatory seating policy. Even so, Nixon had to persuade Parks to lead the fight. After consulting with her mother and husband, Parks accepted the challenge.

==Organizing the boycott==
After Parks&#x27; arrest, Nixon called a number of local ministers to organize support for the boycott; the third man he called was Martin Luther King Jr., a young minister who was newly arrived from Atlanta, Georgia. King said he would think about it and call back. When King responded, he said that he would participate in the boycott and had already arranged a meeting of his church congregation on the issue. Nixon could not attend because of an out-of-town business trip; he took precautions to see that no one was elected to lead the boycott campaign until he returned.

When Nixon returned to Montgomery, he met with Rev. Ralph Abernathy and Rev. E.N. French to plan the program for the next boycott meeting. They came up with a list of demands for the bus company, named the new organization the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), and discussed candidates for president of the association. Nixon recommended King to Abernathy and French because Nixon believed that King had not been compromised by dealing with the local white power structure.

After a successful one-day bus boycott on December 5, 1955, Nixon met with a group of ministers to plan the larger boycott. But, the meeting did not proceed as he had envisioned. The ministers wanted to organize a low-key boycott that would not upset the white power structure in Montgomery. This was completely opposite of what Nixon and the other activists hoped to achieve. An exasperated Nixon threatened to publicly denounce the ministers as cowards. King stood and said that he was no coward. By the end of the meeting, he had accepted the MIA presidency and Nixon had become the treasurer. That evening, King delivered a keynote address to the full meeting at Holt Street Baptist Church.

Nixon shared his labor and civil rights contacts with the MIA, organizing financial and other resources to help manage and support the boycott. These were critical to its success.

==Successful boycott==
What was expected to be a short boycott lasted 381 days, more than one year. Despite fierce political opposition, police coercion, personal threats, and their own sacrifices, the blacks of Montgomery held the boycott. They walked to work; the people with cars gave others rides. They gave up some trips. Bus ridership plummeted, as blacks were the majority riders in the system, and the bus company was on the verge of financial ruin. In late January a bomb was set off near the home of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and on February 1, 1956, a bomb exploded in front of Nixon&#x27;s home.
Attorneys Fred Gray and Charles Langford filed the petition in federal district court for it to review the state and city laws on bus segregation in the case that became known as &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot; (1956). They filed on behalf of the five Montgomery women who originally refused to give up their seats on city buses: Claudette Colvin, Aurelia S. Browder, Susie McDonald, Mary Louise Smith, and Jeanatte Reese. (Reese withdrew from the case in February.)

On June 5, 1956, a three-judge panel of the US District Court ruled on &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot; and determined that Montgomery&#x27;s segregation law was unconstitutional, violating the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. On November 13, 1956, the US Supreme Court upheld the lower court&#x27;s ruling. On December 17, 1956, the Supreme Court rejected appeals by the city and state to reconsider its decision.

Three days later, the Supreme Court issued its order for Montgomery to desegregate its buses. With that legal victory, the MIA organizers ended the boycott. At a later rally at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, Nixon talked about the symbolism of the boycott to an audience of supporters:I&#x27;m from Montgomery, Alabama, a city that&#x27;s known as the Cradle of the Confederacy, that had stood still for more than ninety-three years until Rosa L. Parks was arrested and thrown in jail like a common criminal... Fifty thousand people rose up and caught hold to the Cradle of the Confederacy and began to rock it till the Jim Crow rockers began to reel and the segregated slats began to fall out.

==After the boycott==
Nixon&#x27;s relationship with the MIA was contentious. He frequently had sharp disagreements with others in the group and competed for leadership. He expressed resentment that King and Abernathy had received most of the credit for the boycott, as opposed to the local activists who had already spent years organizing against racism. However, King admired Nixon, describing him as &quot;one of the chief voices of the Negro community in the area of civil rights,&quot; and &quot;a symbol of the hopes and aspirations of the long oppressed people of the State of Alabama.&quot;

Nixon resigned his post as MIA treasurer in 1957, writing a bitter letter to King complaining that he had been treated as a child and a &quot;newcomer.&quot; Nixon continued to feud with Montgomery&#x27;s Black middle class community for the next decade.

By the late 1960s, through a series of political defeats, his leadership role in the MIA was eliminated. After retiring from the railroad, Nixon worked as the recreation director of a public housing project. He continued to work for civil rights, especially to improve housing and education for blacks in Montgomery.

Nixon died at the age of 87 in Montgomery on February 25, 1987.

==Awards and honors==
*In 1985, Nixon received the Walter White Award from the NAACP.
*In 1986, a year before his death, Nixon&#x27;s house in Montgomery was placed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage, in recognition of his leadership in the state.
*Edgar D. Nixon Elementary School, on Edgar D. Nixon Avenue in Montgomery, is named after him.

<text>Gottfried Bernhardy (20 March 1800 – 14 May 1875), German philologist and literary historian, was born at Landsberg an der Warthe (now Poland) in the Neumark.

==Life==
He was the son of Jewish parents in reduced circumstances. Two well-to-do uncles provided the means for his education, and in 1811 he entered the Joachimsthal gymnasium at Berlin. In 1817 he went to Berlin University to study philology, where he had the advantage of hearing F.A. Wolf (then advanced in years), August Böckh and Philipp Karl Buttmann. 
In 1822, he took the degree of doctor of philosophy at Berlin, and in 1825 became an associate professor. 
In 1829, he succeeded Christian Carl Reisig as professor and director of the philological seminary at Halle, and in 1844 was appointed chief librarian of the university.

== Works ==
The most important of Bernhardy&#x27;s works were his histories (or sketches) of Greek and Roman literature:
* &quot;Grundriss der römischen Litteratur&quot; (5th ed., 1872)
* &quot;Grundriss der griechischen Litteratur&quot;:
**Pt. i, Introduction and general view, 1836.
**Pt. ii, Greek poetry, 1845.
**pt. iii, Greek prose literature, was never published.
A fifth edition of pts. i. and ii., by R. Volkmann, began in 1892. Other works by Bernhardy are:
* &quot;Eratosthenica&quot; (1822); a book involving Eratosthenes.
* &quot;Dionysius Periegetes Graece et Latine&quot; (1828); a book involving Dionysius Periegetes.
* &quot;Wissenschaftliche Syntax der griechischen Sprache&quot; (1829, suppts. 1854, 1862) – Scientific syntax of the Greek language.
* &quot;Grundlinien zur Encyclopädie der Philologie&quot; (1832) – Basic orientation for an encyclopedia of philology.
* a monumental edition of the &quot;&quot;Lexicon&quot; of Suidas; project completed in 1853.
* an edition of F. A. Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Kleine Schriften&quot;&quot;, two volumes (1869).

<text>The Seventh Sign is a 1988 American apocalyptic drama horror film written by Clifford and Ellen Green and directed by Carl Schultz. The title and plot reference the seven seals described in the Book of Revelation, the final book of the New Testament of the Bible. The film was released on April 1, 1988, by Columbia Pictures Entertainment under the TriStar Pictures label, received mixed reviews and grossed $18.8 million at the box office domestically.

==Plot==
Around the world, unusual phenomena are occurring that bear resemblance to signs of the Biblical apocalypse; these include a mass death of sea life in Haiti and a devastating freeze in the Middle East, and at each of these locations, a mysterious traveler opens a sealed envelope just prior to the event taking place. The Vatican tasks Father Lucci with investigating these events, though Lucci advises that they are all either hoaxes or have scientific explanations.

Concurrently to this, Abby Quinn, a pregnant woman living in California, prepares for the birth of her child. Her husband, Russell, is a defense lawyer representing Jimmy Szaragosa, a man with Down syndrome, who is on trial for murdering his incestuous parents and claiming that he did so after having been ordered to by God. Jimmy is convicted of the crime and sentenced to death.

For additional income, Abby and Russell rent a room to the mysterious traveler, who identifies himself as David Bannon. He first charms them with stories of the Hebrew myth of the Guf (or Guph), from whence all souls come to earth, and how, when a sparrow sings its song, it is the only living animal that can see the soul coming from the Guf. Soon after, Abby begins to have terrible nightmares of a man closely resembling David being struck down by a Roman soldier, who then asks &quot;will you die for him?&quot; of her. In addition, Abby physically reacts inexplicably. Abby also learns of the apocalyptic signs that have occurred, and combined with her nightmares and David&#x27;s suspicious behavior, she begins to worry that something terrible is taking place. She snoops through David&#x27;s papers and discovers an ancient note that leads her to believe that he intends to harm her child. When Abby confronts David about this, he tells her that God&#x27;s grace is empty and soon, no souls will remain to be given to newborn babies. Abby panics and stabs David, only for him to shrug off the injury and claim that he &quot;cannot die again.&quot; To add to Abby&#x27;s shock and horror the stab wound David sustains bursts with light rather than blood.

It becomes apparent that He is actually the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Abby&#x27;s nightmares are visions of his original crucifixion, and she is the reincarnation of Seraphia, the woman who offered Jesus water only to be turned away by Cartaphilus, who was Pilate&#x27;s porter who struck Jesus.

The signs of the apocalypse continue to unfold and eventually cause a giant storm. Abby connects with Avi, a rabbinical student who helps her understand the events. Father Lucci, who has come to California as part of his investigation, finds her and hears her concerns. However, while meeting with Lucci, Abby spots a ring on his finger identical to the one that Cartaphilus wore and learns that Lucci is Cartaphilus himself who was cursed to wander the Earth until Christ&#x27;s return to judge humanity. He intends to allow the apocalypse to take place so that his curse will finally be broken.

Abby flees from Lucci with Avi&#x27;s aid, and together the two of them find a Bible to learn what will happen next. They discover that the sixth sign will be a solar eclipse that will take place the next day, meaning that the fifth sign — the tortured death of a martyr for God&#x27;s cause — must take place very soon. Abby realizes that clemency has been denied to Jimmy and his execution will be the fifth sign. In a panic, she drives to the prison to stop the execution; however, Lucci has already infiltrated the prison. As Abby approaches, Lucci kills Jimmy and wounds Abby and is taken away by the guards.

The eclipse begins along with a catastrophic earthquake. Despondent over her failure to save Jimmy and the rest of humanity, Abby goes into labor and is rushed through the disaster to a nearby hospital. Despite the best efforts of Russell and the doctors to help her, the child&#x27;s heart stops beating as Abby gives birth, thus fulfilling the seventh and final sign, the birth of the soulless child. However, Abby has another vision of her past as Seraphia and remembers Cartaphilus&#x27; question. Finally finding true hope, Abby answers the question in the affirmative—&quot;I will die for him&quot;—and reaches out to her child, who revives and holds her finger. Her soul is thus transferred to the child, saving him at the cost of her own life. This act of faith ends the apocalypse. Jesus appears in the hospital and tells Russell that Abby&#x27;s sacrifice has refilled the Hall of Souls, ensuring that humanity will continue to survive. He tells Avi to record this for future humanity.

==Release and reception==
The film was released theatrically in the United States by TriStar Pictures on April 1, 1988. It grossed $18,875,011 at the US box office. It received mixed reviews from critics, and holds a 15% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews. In his two-star review, Roger Ebert stated: &quot;After the sheer anarchy unleashed upon Hollywood by the slice-and-dice movies, it’s actually comforting to know that these characters play by the rules. They believe in good and evil, and they act as if individual human beings can have an influence on the outcome of events.&quot; Michael Wilmington in a review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the visuals used in the film, calling them &quot;extraordinary&quot;; however, he felt that the material was lacking and categorized the story as a &quot;New Age variation on &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD in the United States by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in 1998. Scream Factory released the film on Blu-ray on September 11, 2018, featuring new interviews with actors Michael Biehn, Peter Friedman and John Taylor, screenwriters Clifford and Ellen Green and director Carl Schultz, as well as two television spots.

<text>China National Highway 102 is a major trunk route connecting Beijing to Fuyuan, Heilongjiang. In Beijing it is known as Jingfu Road (), after the two cities&#x27; names, for connecting Beijing to Fuyuan.

It leaves Beijing as the Jingtong Expressway and Tongzhou–Yanjiao Expressway into Hebei Province (they are rare occurrences that sections of National Highways are built to National Expressway standards). It then runs alongside the Beijing–Shenyang Expressway along the coast until Shenyang, Liaoning, and then along the Shenyang–Harbin Expressway until Harbin.

China National Highway 102 was in length. It runs through the provinces of Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang. It connects major cities of Qinhuangdao, Shenyang, Changchun and Harbin. In 2013, under a new 2013-2030 plan by NDRC&amp;MoT, the G102 has been extended to Fuyuan.

<text>Philipp Karl Buttmann (5 December 1764 – 21 June 1829) was a German philologist of French Huguenot ancestry (original family name &quot;Boudemont&quot;), born in Frankfurt am Main.

He was educated in his native town and at the University of Göttingen, where he was a student of Christian Gottlob Heyne. In 1789 he obtained an appointment in the Royal Library of Berlin, and for a period of time, edited Spener&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot;. In 1800 he became a professor at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin, a post he held for eight years. In 1806 he was admitted to the Academy of Sciences as a member of its historical-philological section. In 1811 he became first librarian at the Royal Library.

== Published works ==
Buttmann&#x27;s writings gave a great impetus to the scientific study of the Greek language. His &quot;Griechische Grammatik&quot; (1792) went through many editions, and was translated into English. His &quot;Lexilogus&quot;, a valuable study on some words of difficulty occurring principally in the poems of Homer and Hesiod, was published in 1818–1825, and was later translated into English and published as &quot;Lexilogus: or, a critical examination of the meaning and etymology of numerous Greek works and passages intended principally for Homer and Hesiod&quot; (1861).

Buttmann&#x27;s other works were:
* &quot;Ausfuhrliche griechische Sprachlehre&quot; (2 vols, 1819–1827).

<text>Liza Weil (born June 5, 1977) is an American actress. She is best known for her starring role as Paris Geller in the WB/CW comedy-drama series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000–2007) and its Netflix revival series &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot; (2016). She is also known for her roles as White House aide Amanda Tanner in the ABC political drama series &quot;Scandal&quot; (2012) and as attorney Bonnie Winterbottom in the ABC legal drama series &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot; (2014–2020).

==Early life and education==
Weil was born in Passaic, New Jersey, into an acting family. She was raised in, and continues to practice, Reform Judaism.

Her parents, Lisa and Marc Weil, toured Europe with their comedy troupe, The Madhouse Company of London, with her in tow. Weil had aspirations of becoming an archaeologist in her younger years, because of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film trilogy and a childhood crush on Harrison Ford. In 1984, at the age of seven, her family settled down in suburban Lansdale, Pennsylvania northwest of Philadelphia, where her parents still reside. Weil has described herself as an average student who focused more on her budding acting career than her studies.

Weil traveled frequently to New York City for professional auditions and acted in productions both off-Broadway and in Philadelphia&#x27;s theatrical community before pursuing her film and television career. A 1995 graduate of North Penn High School, she graduated in the summer rather than the regular term due to her acting commitments. 

Her first appearance on network television was in a 1995 episode of the New York-based CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, where she played an unnamed student in a science class.

==Career==
Weil continues to be active in the Los Angeles theatrical community during hiatuses, is a regular performer at the Ojai Playwrights Conference in early August and radio dramas with L.A. Theatre Works, and still occasionally performs in live theater in Philadelphia and New York City. She has acted with every member of her family; in 2004, she headlined with her father in a well-received regional theater production of &quot;Proof&quot; at the Montgomery Theater in Souderton, Pennsylvania, just north of her adopted hometown of Lansdale. Her first ever television role in 1994, which was an episode of &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; called &quot;Yellow Fever&quot;, found her playing a bully alongside her mother Lisa, who played a teacher (she would also play a second role later in the series as a love interest to Big Pete in the episode &quot;35 Hours&quot;). Her younger sister Samantha shared the screen with Liza in &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;&#x27; third-season finale, &quot;Those Are Strings, Pinocchio&quot;. Samantha Weil played a student named Bernadette (who was unrelated to Paris) making a video yearbook entry in front of an impatient Paris, who is standing off to the side waiting to make her own entry.

An alumna of Columbia University, Weil received her first major feature film role co-starring with Kevin Bacon in &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot;. Before that role, she starred in the 1998 independent film, &quot;Whatever&quot;. Her first film was the 1996 short film, &quot;A Cure For Serpents&quot;, where she played a daughter of a mysophobic woman bringing home a boyfriend who was not as obsessive with cleanliness. She also appeared in several other short and feature-length independent films, such as &quot;Motel Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;Scar&quot;, and &quot;Lullaby&quot;. After her work in &quot;Whatever&quot; and &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot;, Warner Bros. signed Weil to a talent holding deal and she moved to Los Angeles, where she guest-starred on series produced by that studio, including &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;The West Wing&quot;, before being cast on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.

Weil was originally considered for the role of Rory Gilmore by &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; creator Amy Sherman-Palladino before Alexis Bledel won the role; the character of Paris Geller was created especially for Weil.

In 2006, Weil was featured in the horror themed short film, &quot;Grace&quot;, in which her character suffers a miscarriage, yet decides to carry the baby to term with terrifying results. The film, which also featured Brian Austin Green, premiered at the Fangoria Weekend of Horrors convention on June 2, 2006, and is the basis for the 2009 feature film of the same name. She also had a minor role as a humane society worker in the Molly Shannon film &quot;Year of the Dog&quot;, and appeared as Doris Delay in the 2008 biographical film &quot;Neal Cassady&quot;, and as a reporter in the 2010 live-action rotoscoping film &quot;Mars&quot;.

Weil also voiced a public service announcement in support of the American Diabetes Association&#x27;s &quot;Step Up to Fight Diabetes&quot; staircase climb event, which took place in Center City Philadelphia on October 20, 2007.

In 2009, Weil returned to her roots as a regular guest star in various television series, including appearances in &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;In Plain Sight&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; and &quot;Private Practice&quot; and in February 2010 began a run as Dr. Glass on the popular Internet series &quot;Anyone But Me&quot;; series creator Susan Miller officiated at Weil&#x27;s wedding to Paul Adelstein in 2006.

In March 2011, Weil was cast as Amanda Tanner, a White House aide, in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Scandal&quot;, a series written and produced by Shonda Rhimes. Weil had a recurring role in the series&#x27; first season.

Weil played a supporting role in the horror film &quot;Smiley&quot;, and started 2013 as a recurring guest star in the last half of the only season of Amy Sherman-Palladino&#x27;s ABC Family series &quot;Bunheads&quot; as Milly, the sister of Truly Stone. 

She is also a frequent collaborator of independent film director Noah Buschel, having appeared in most of his work. She co-produced and starred in his 2014 low-budget project &quot;The Situation is Liquid&quot;.

In February 2014, Weil was cast as Bonnie Winterbottom, an assistant to Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) in the ABC series &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot;, which premiered during the 2014–15 television season. She also reprised her role as Paris Geller in the &quot;Winter&quot; and &quot;Spring&quot; episodes of the Netflix revival series &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot;. 

In 2019, it was revealed that Weil would appear in the third season of the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; as Carole Keen (a character created in tribute to bass guitarist Carol Kaye, though Kaye voiced objections to the overall character and portrayal), making that series Weil&#x27;s third collaboration with the Palladinos.

In early 2022, she began a recurring role as FBI agent Katherine Russo in the Fox series &quot;The Cleaning Lady&quot;.

==Personal life==
Weil married actor Paul Adelstein in a Reform Jewish ceremony in November 2006. They had previously known each other through theatrical projects. The two went on to appear together in three film projects: the short film &quot;Order Up&quot; (2007), the Gregory Dark-helmed &quot;Little Fish, Strange Pond&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Missing Person&quot; (2008). She also appeared in a 2011 episode of &quot;Private Practice&quot;, although she and Adelstein had no scenes together. In April 2010, the couple had a daughter, Josephine Elizabeth Weil-Adelstein. Weil filed for divorce from Adelstein in March 2016, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized in November 2017. 

Weil dated her &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot; co-star Charlie Weber from mid-2016 to February 2019.

Weil is left-handed and a natural brunette. Her niece is child actress Scarlett Estevez.

<text>This is a list of European colonial administrators responsible for the territory of Ruanda-Urundi, an area equivalent to modern-day Rwanda and Burundi. Ruanda-Urundi formed part of German East Africa until it was captured by Belgian forces during World War I. After that, the territory became a Class B League of Nations mandate, and later a United Nations trust territory, under the administration of Belgium, until 1962 when the constituent parts of the territory became independent.

==German rule==

===Military District of Ujiji===
===Military District of Usumbura===
===Military Residency of Urundi and Ruanda===
On 15 November 1907, the Military Residency of Urundi and Ruanda was divided into two civil residencies: Ruanda and Urundi.

==Belgian rule==
===Territories south of Lake Victoria (including Northern Ruanda)===
===Territories east of Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika (including Southern Ruanda and Urundi)===
===Occupied East African territories===
===Ruanda-Urundi mandate / trust territory===


On 1 July 1962, the constituent parts of Ruanda-Urundi became independent as the Republic of Rwanda (&quot;République du Rwanda&quot;) and the Kingdom of Burundi (&quot;Royaume du Burundi&quot;), respectively.

<text>Karl Friedrich Elze (22 May 1821, Dessau21 January 1889, Halle) was a German scholar and Shakespearean critic.

==Life==
He was the son of Pastor Karl August Wilhelm Elze. He studied (1839–1843) classical philology, and modern, but especially English, literature at the University of Leipzig where he obtained his PhD. He was a master for a time in the gymnasium (preparatory school) at Dessau, and in 1875 was appointed extraordinary, and in 1876 ordinary, professor of English philology at the University of Halle. The course catalogue for the winter 1875/76 has a four-hour lecture on the history of English literature one hour each day on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. On Wednesdays and Saturdays he publicly lectured on Shakespeare&#x27;s The Merchant of Venice.

Elze began his literary career with the &quot;Englischer Liederschatz&quot; (1851), an anthology of English lyrics, edited for a while a critical periodical &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and in 1857 published an edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; with critical notes. He also edited George Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Alphonsus&quot; (1867) and wrote biographies of Walter Scott, Byron and Shakespeare; &quot;Abhandlungen zu Shakespeare&quot; (English translation by D Schmitz, as &quot;Essays on Shakespeare&quot;, London, 1874), and the treatise, &quot;Notes on Elizabethan Dramatists&quot; with conjectural emendations of the text (3 volumes, Halle, 1880–1886, new ed. 1889).

He was politically active as a member of the Dessau-ischen for many years and presented a programmatic script to the Constitution of the Duchy of 1848 and promoted the idea that &quot;Freedom of religion should be granted without Government controls&quot;.

<text>Charles Anthon (November 19, 1797 – July 29, 1867) was an American classical scholar. Anthon was a professor at Columbia College and became headmaster of its grammar and preparatory school. He produced classical works for schools, which contained assistance and translations in the notes. He had a disagreement with Martin Harris over an account where they discussed the authenticity of the &quot;Anthon Transcript&quot; of the Book of Mormon. Anthon was also an acquaintance of writer Edgar Allan Poe. He died in New York City at the age of 69.

==Life==
His father George Christian Anthon was a German-American medical doctor who served in the British Army during the American Revolution until the surrender of Detroit in 1796. George attained the rank of surgeon general, resigned, married the daughter of a French officer, and settled in New York City. Charles was born there on November 19, 1797, graduated with honors from Columbia College in 1815, and, after studying law at his elder brother&#x27;s firm, was called to the bar in 1819. He never practiced. Instead, the next year, he was appointed assistant professor of Greek and Latin at his old college. In 1830, he was made a full professor and become the headmaster of the Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School. In 1835, he was appointed Jay Professor of the Greek Language and Literature in Columbia College upon the resignation of Nathaniel Fish Moore. He retired from the grammar school in 1864 and died in New York on July 29, 1867, at the age of 69.

==Works==
He produced a large number of classical works for use in colleges and schools, which enjoyed great popularity, although schoolmasters sometimes disliked their use by students, owing to the large amount of assistance and translations contained in the notes. Anthon&#x27;s books on classical literature commonly included a &quot;classical dictionary&quot;. He also wrote &quot;A Manual of Greek Literature from the Earliest Authentic Periods to the Close of Byzantine Era&quot;, providing a list of all Greek writers in that period, with a summary of their life and works and a bibliography of editions then in use. The overview is still useful today, but outdated. His intention to provide a similar volume for Latin literature was never fulfilled.

Dr. Anthon&#x27;s work was carried on by his successor, Henry Drisler.

==Anthon Transcript==

Charles Anthon is famous in connection with the history of the Latter Day Saint movement because of his interactions with Martin Harris in February 1828 concerning a fragment of Joseph Smith&#x27;s translation of the Book of Mormon. The fragment later came to be known as the &quot;Anthon Transcript&quot;. According to Harris, Anthon wrote Harris a letter of authenticity declaring the fragment to contain true Egyptian characters. Anthon also confirmed the translation of these characters as correct. When informed that an angel of God had revealed the characters to Joseph Smith, Anthon tore up the authentication, stating that there was no such thing as angels, and asked Harris to bring the plates to him for translation. Martin Harris went to Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill afterwards and received a letter of authenticity from him. Anthon, however, disagreed with Harris&#x27; version of their encounter and stated in a letter to Eber D. Howe on February 17, 1834, that the story of Anthon&#x27;s authentication was false, that Anthon had identified the writings as a hoax, and that Anthon had told Harris that the writings were part of &quot;a scheme to cheat the farmer [Martin Harris] of his money...&quot; Anthon gave a second account in 1841 as to whether he gave Harris a written opinion about the document: &quot;[Harris] requested me to give him my opinion in writing about the paper which he had shown to me. I did so without hesitation, partly for the man&#x27;s sake, and partly to let the individual &#x27;behind the curtain&#x27; see that his trick was discovered. The import of what I wrote was, as far as I can now recollect, simply this, that the marks in the paper appeared to be merely an imitation of various alphabetical characters, and had, in my opinion, no meaning at all connected with them.&quot;

==Acquaintance with Poe==
Dr. Anthon was a friend and correspondent of Edgar Allan Poe, who attempted to use their acquaintance to gain a national reputation in literature and journalism as well as publication in 1845 of his collected stories through Harper and Brothers. This was, at the time, unsuccessful due to a doubtful accusation of plagiarism against Poe; however, Poe went on to establish himself in the first rank of American letters.

<text>Viplavakari Lanka Sama Samaja Party (Revolutionary Lanka Equal Society Party, Sinhala; විප්ලවකාරි ලංකා සමසමජ පක්ෂය) was a political group in Ceylon, that broke away from the Trotskyist Lanka Sama Samaja Party, since Philip Gunawardena (one of the principal LSSP leaders) refused to reconcile with the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party. When the BSP and LSSP fused in 1950, Gunawardena split to form VLSSP.

In 1952 VLSSP entered into an electoral alliance with the Communist Party. In the parliamentary elections that year, VLSSP won one seat (represented by Gunawardena&#x27;s wife, Kusumasiri Gunawardena).

Philip Gunawardena lead the Viplavakari Lanka Sama Samaja Party (VLSSP) since 1951 and as constituent party formed the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP, Peoples’ United Front) in 1956 under the leadership of Mr.SWRD Bandaranaike to form the first people’s government in 1956 General Election. At that election, VLSSP won five seats in the parliament as part of MEP. Philip Gunawardena became the Minister of Agriculture, Food, &amp; Co-operatives and his party colleague P. J. William de Silva became the Minister of Fisheries &amp; Industries. They served as a key members of the Cabinet of SWRD Bandaranaike.

But the presence of the leftist VLSSP in the government irritated the rightist sections of SLFP, who maneuvered VLSSP out through a series of intrigues. MEP fell apart and the government was defeated. In 1959 VLSSP was disbanded and Gunawardena reorganized his party with the name Mahajana Eksath Peramuna. His new party was however not a Trotskyist formation.

VLSSP should not be confused with Lanka Sama Samaja Party (Revolutionary), which was a later splinter group of LSSP.

<doc id="900622" wikidata="Q4011103" url="?curid=900622" title="Vice Versa (novel)">
<text>Vice Versa: A Lesson to Fathers is a comic novel by Thomas Anstey Guthrie, writing under the pseudonym &quot;F. Anstey&quot;, first published in 1882. The title originates from the Latin phrase &quot;vice versa&quot;, meaning &quot;the other way around&quot;.

In Victorian London, a father and son switch places by means of a magic stone from India, thus live each other&#x27;s lives, and gain a better understanding for each other before they switch back.

==Plot summary==
Set in contemporary Victorian times, the novel concerns stuffy businessman Paul Bultitude and his son Dick. Dick is about to leave home to return to a boarding school run by the cane-wielding headmaster, Dr. Grimstone. Bultitude, seeing Dick&#x27;s fear of returning to school, dismisses his son&#x27;s concerns by asserting that schooldays are the best years of a boy&#x27;s life, and how he wishes he were the one going.

At this point, thanks to a magic stone brought by Dick&#x27;s uncle from India which grants the possessor one wish, the father and son find themselves magically transformed into identical versions of the other. Dick, holding the stone, is ordered by his father to return him to his own body, but Dick refuses. Paul has to begin the new term at his son&#x27;s boarding school, while Dick gets a chance to run his father&#x27;s business in the City. In the end, both are restored to their own bodies, with a better understanding of each other.

==Adaptations==
===Theatre===
In 1883, playwright Edward Rose adapted the story as a West End play, also titled &quot;Vice Versa&quot;.

===Radio===
The BBC made a six-part radio series in 1947, adapted and produced by Felix Felton. Paul Bultitude was played by Ronald Simpson, and his mischievous son Dick by John Clark. Dr. Grimstone was played by veteran radio actor Ralph Truman. An early example of creative sound effects before the days of tape meant that when the father succeeds in his wish to be just like his son going off to school, juvenile actor John Clark had to talk to himself. He had to pre-record the father&#x27;s dialogue on the 15 inch disks used at that time, and leave gaps for the son&#x27;s character to speak. After much careful rehearsal, the broadcast went out live, with naturalistic speech overlaps.

===Film and television===
The story has also been adapted for film at least four times, and for television at least once. The first film adaptation was a British silent film released in 1916: it was directed by Maurice Elvey, and starred Charles Rock, Douglas Munro and Guy Newall. The second, also British, was released in 1937. 

The third film, again British, was released in 1948. It was written and directed by Peter Ustinov, and starred Roger Livesey as Paul Bultitude and Anthony Newley (fresh from the Italia Conti Academy) as Dick. John Clark, who had played Dick in the radio adaptation, was initially auditioned and cast by Ustinov, with a seven-year Rank contract. However, his agent had overlooked a clause in his &quot;Just William&quot; theatre contract, which gave an option for the tour to be repeated across England for another year. Newley was therefore cast in his place.

The 1981 ITV television adaptation featured Peter Bowles as Paul Bultitude.

The 1988 American film version, adapted into a modern setting, stars Judge Reinhold and Fred Savage as the father and son. It did not credit F. Anstey&#x27;s novel as its source in its initial release, but retained the title.

==Allusions/references from other works==
The novels &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; and &quot;Summer Switch&quot; by Mary Rodgers are modern re-tellings of the same story.

Mr. Bultitude (but not the name of the novel) is mentioned in &quot;The Gold Bat&quot; by P. G. Wodehouse, in the first paragraph of Chapter XII. The book had previously been referred to as one of those vandalised in Chapter VII.

Mr. Bultitude is also the name of the tame bear (the last of the Seven Bears of Logres) in the third book of C. S. Lewis&#x27; science fiction trilogy, &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;.

&quot;Vice Versa&quot; is also mentioned in Episode 15, &quot;Circe&quot;, of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922); in Chapter 6 of Malcolm Lowry&#x27;s &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; (1947); in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Officers and Gentlemen&quot; (1955) (the second in his &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; trilogy) as the novel Guy was reading in the summer-garden; in &quot;Surprised by Joy&quot; by C. S. Lewis (1955); in Chapter V of &quot;A Prisoner in Fairyland&quot; by Algernon Blackwood (1913); in Chapter 3, section 3 of &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; by Agatha Christie (1941); and in &quot;In Search of Treasure&quot; by Horatio Alger (1907).

<text>Thomas Løvendahl Sørensen (; born 12 June 1976) is a Danish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

Sørensen started his career with his local side Odense BK. After impressing on loan at Vejle Boldklub and Svendborg he was signed by English side Sunderland in 1998. After five years as first-choice goalkeeper on Wearside, he joined Aston Villa for £2 million. He remained a regular for his time at Villa Park until a fall-out with manager Martin O&#x27;Neill saw him dropped and then released in May 2008. He then went to Stoke City, where he was first-choice goalkeeper for three seasons, helping the club consolidate in the Premier League. He then finished his playing career with a two-year spell at Australian club Melbourne City. He remains to date the Danish player with the most Premier League appearances (364 in total).

Between 2000 and 2012, Sørensen was the starting goalkeeper for the Denmark national football team, the successor to the legendary Peter Schmeichel, and he played 101 matches for his country, making him their eighth-most capped player of all time. He was part of Denmark&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2000, 2002 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2004, and 2010 FIFA World Cup squads.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Fredericia, Sørensen started playing youth football with local clubs in Erritsø and Assens. He then moved to the youth team of local top-flight club Odense Boldklub. He played in training matches against FC St. Pauli and Werder Bremen in February 1993, and signed a trainee contract with the club. He was soon a professional with Odense BK&#x27;s first team squad in the Danish Superliga championship. Sørensen served as an understudy to club legend goalkeeper Lars Høgh, and did not play any league games for the club.

During the 1995–96 season, he was loaned out to league rivals Vejle BK in December 1995. Initially an understudy to Erik Boye, he made his Superliga debut in March 1996. Sørensen played three thoroughly impressive games in a row, and the press dubbed him the new Peter Schmeichel. He played six league matches in all for Vejle, including a 6–0 defeat to Brøndby IF, before being dropped by coach Ole Fritsen following a 1–0 defeat to Viborg FF, in which Viborg&#x27;s Ralf Pedersen headed the ball from Sørensen&#x27;s hands to score the goal. Sørensen broke his arm in the summer 1996, but continued his loan deal with Vejle until the summer 1997, without playing any more games for the club. Odense then loaned him out again, this time to FC Svendborg in the second-tier Danish 1st Division league, where he played the full 1997–98 season.

===Sunderland===
In the summer 1998, Sørensen moved abroad to play for English club Sunderland in the Football League First Division, the then second level league of English football. Hardly anyone outside of Denmark had even heard of the tall and athletic keeper, when English manager Peter Reid bought the 22-year-old from Odense for about £510,000 in July 1998. He was recommended to the club by Peter Schmeichel. Sørensen was bought to replace fan favourite Lionel Pérez who left on a free transfer. This move helped Sunderland to promotion for the top flight English Premiership, when Sørensen and his team grabbed the League Championship title in 1999. Sørensen smashed the club&#x27;s clean sheet record with 29 clean sheets in the process.

Sørensen established himself as Sunderland&#x27;s starting goalkeeper in the Premiership, and helped the club finish 7th in both of their two first Premiership seasons. He gained legendary status with Sunderland fans in 2001, when he saved a penalty kick from Alan Shearer in the dying moments of a November 2000 game, to preserve a valuable win over archrivals and neighbouring club Newcastle United. In the 2002–03 season, Sørensen was injured from October 2002 to January 2003, and only played 21 of 38 games. Sunderland were struggling both on and off the pitch and Sørensen could not save the club from relegation at the end of the season.

Reid had already been sacked, and as a result of the club&#x27;s mounting financial worries, Sunderland sold Sørensen for £2 million to Aston Villa, who had held off interest from a handful of other clubs, including Manchester United and Arsenal. He played nearly 200 games on Wearside for Sunderland and remains a fan favourite.

===Aston Villa===
At Aston Villa, Sørensen developed his reputation as a good goalkeeper. Sørensen&#x27;s ability as a shot stopper allowed him to retain his place as Villa&#x27;s number one under both managers David O&#x27;Leary and Martin O&#x27;Neill, ahead of the likes of Stefan Postma and Stuart Taylor. In his first three seasons at Aston Villa, he only missed four games. In a November 2003 game against Newcastle, he once again saved an Alan Shearer penalty kick. He suffered a knee injury during the 2006–07 season, but still played 29 games that term.

During the 2007–08 season he fell out of favour at Villa. Sørensen had suffered an injury during the pre-season, and Villa decided to loan in goalkeeper Scott Carson from Liverpool. Carson went on to become the starting goalkeeper, and Sørensen stated that he wanted to leave the club in December 2007. At the end of the 2007–08 season, Sørensen&#x27;s contract at Villa expired and he left the club on a free transfer. He failed to make a single appearance for the club in his final season as by then he had slipped down to third place in the pecking order behind both Scott Carson and Stuart Taylor.

===Stoke City===

====First-choice goalkeeper: 2008–2010====
On 28 July 2008, Sørensen started a trial with newly promoted Premier League team Stoke City, and two days later, he signed a three-year contract with the club. Sørensen became City&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper for the 2008–09 season replacing Steve Simonsen. During a match in October 2008 against Tottenham Hotspur he was involved in a clash with Spurs&#x27;s defender Alan Hutton whose challenge struck Sørensen on his head, Sørensen said he was close to losing his eyesight. Hutton later apologised for his challenge. He made a number of important performances as Stoke achieved in a safe position of 12th in their first season in the Premier League.

He continued to be Stoke&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper in 2009–10 and signed a contract extension in November 2009, to keep him at the Britannia Stadium until 2011. During the 2009–10 season he continued his good form in goal. He saved penalties during games against Portsmouth, Arsenal and Wigan Athletic, and played an important part in Stoke&#x27;s good run in the league, which brought them to 10th place in December. On 12 December Sørensen saved yet another penalty, meaning he had by then saved five out of the last six penalty kicks against him. Sørensen got extra competition for the spot as Stoke&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper, following the signing of Asmir Begović from Portsmouth in February 2010. He dislocated his elbow in a game against Chelsea on 25 April. The elbow was put back in place without the need for surgery, but Sørensen missed the last three games of the 2009–10 season.

====Position challenged: 2010–2012====
After starting the first nine matches of the 2010–11 season Sørensen lost his place to Begović. However, he played in all the club&#x27;s FA Cup games, including the FA Cup Final against Manchester City on 14 May 2011 where he put in a good performance despite Stoke City losing 1–0. For the 2011–12 season Sørensen remained as 2nd choice &#x27;keeper to Begović where he played in cup matches as well as in the UEFA Europa League. After some poor performances by Begović, Sørensen was recalled to league matches. In a match against Everton he received mild concussion after a clash with Tim Cahill and had to be stretchered off. However he soon made a quick recovery. He signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract at Stoke in December 2011 keeping him at the club until 2014. After signing his new contract Sørensen stated that he wanted to continue playing top flight football after his contract ends.

====Final years as back-up: 2012–2015====
In 2012–13 Sørensen was restricted to playing in just cup fixtures due to the form of Begović and this coupled with the signing of Jack Butland prompted Sørensen to consider his future at Stoke City. Following the departure of manager Tony Pulis, Sørensen planned to talk with new manager Mark Hughes about his future at the Britannia Stadium. Sørensen played his first Premier League game for over 20 months on 26 December 2013 at Newcastle United after Begović suffered an injury. However, despite him saving a penalty from Loïc Rémy, Stoke had two men sent-off and went on to lose 5–1. Sørensen started the next two matches before he himself was injured against Everton enabling third-choice Butland to fill in for Begović. Once Begović returned from his injury Butland was loaned out to Leeds United, leaving Sørensen to resume his place as back-up for the remainder of the 2013–14 season and was offered a one-year contract extension, which he signed in May 2014. In December 2014 Sørensen stated that he would leave Stoke at the end of the 2014–15 season. Sørensen received a special recognition award at the end of the season for his contribution to Stoke, in total he spent seven seasons at the Britannia Stadium making 129 appearances. Sørensen decided to mark his departure from Stoke by cycling 4,000 miles across the United States to raise money for charity.

===Melbourne City===
On 31 August 2015, Sørensen signed a two-year deal with Australian side Melbourne City. He made his A-League debut on 10 October in the first match of the new season away to Sydney FC in a 1–1 draw. Sørensen was released by Melbourne City in April 2017 after they lost their elimination-final to Perth Glory.

On 24 July 2017, Sørensen announced his retirement from professional football at the age of 41.

==International career==

Sørensen made his international debut with the Danish under-19 national team in April 1993, and was moved into the Danish under-21 national team in September 1993, making his under-21 debut at 17 years of age. He went on to play 24 games for the Denmark under-21s until October 1997. Following his initial impressive form for Vejle, he was called up for an unofficial national team game in April 1996, and replaced Lars Høgh at half-time.

After his move to Sunderland, Sørensen made his debut for the senior Danish national team in November 1999 in a match against Israel, coming on to replace an injured Peter Schmeichel. He was a reserve keeper for Denmark at Euro 2000, when Schmeichel was at the end of his career. For the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign in 2001, he took over the job as goalkeeper and helped Denmark qualify. Sørensen was then instrumental, as Denmark won their first round group ahead of Senegal, Uruguay and defending World Cup champions France to book a second round clash against England. However, in the pouring rain at the Niigata Stadium, Sørensen conceded three goals, one of them a mistake by Sørensen, as he bundled the ball into his own goal from a Rio Ferdinand header in the fifth minute. England went on to win the match 3–0.

Once again representing his country in an international tournament, Sørensen played in all his country&#x27;s games at Euro 2004, gathering the official man of the match award after both the 0–0 draw with Italy and the 2–0 victory against Bulgaria. Despite his efforts, Denmark was once more eliminated in a 3–0 loss, this time to the Czech Republic in the quarter-finals.

During the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Denmark faced Sweden at Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm. Sweden was awarded a penalty in the tenth minute, which Sørensen saved as Denmark went on to win the game 1–0. Sørensen missed three qualification matches through injury, yet Denmark still qualified for the 2010 World Cup with one match to go. Sørensen&#x27;s elbow injury put his chance of appearing in his second World Cup in doubt, but Denmark coach Morten Olsen included him in the final squad, and on regaining full fitness Sørensen was named the starting goalkeeper for his second World Cup campaign, and played full-time in Denmark&#x27;s three games at the tournament.

He reached the landmark of 100 international caps at the age of 36 on 29 February 2012, in a 0–2 friendly defeat to Russia in Copenhagen. On 26 May, in a friendly against Brazil at Hamburg&#x27;s Imtech Arena, Sørensen had to be substituted for an injury in the 24th minute which led to his withdrawal from Denmark&#x27;s squad for UEFA Euro 2012.

On 7 August 2012, after making 101 appearances for Denmark, he announced his retirement from international football.

==Personal life==
Sørensen grew up supporting Odense BK and cites Lars Høgh as his role model. He married Maria Borring in Svendborg, Denmark on 16 June 2001. Thomas and Maria have two children: Marcus and Celine.

In 2006, Sørensen became an investor in &quot;Golf Punk&quot; magazine, alongside former Sunderland teammates Phil Babb, Michael Gray, Jason McAteer, and Stephen Wright, saving the publication from closure.

Sørensen currently resides in Australia, where he has gained citizenship. He is a frequent panellist for Optus Sport’s streaming coverage of the English Premier League. Sørensen also actively appears as a guest on the network&#x27;s &#x27;GegenPod&#x27; podcast, providing punditry input to Australia&#x27;s A-League, Socceroos national team fixtures and European leagues. He is also a regular panellist for the &#x27;A-Leagues Download&#x27;, a weekly review show produced by the Australian Professional Leagues. Additionally, Sørensen was present in covering UEFA Euro 2020 and Copa America 2021 fixtures, as well as the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, appearing as a panellist during pre and post game intervals.

<doc id="900634" wikidata="Q3237138" url="?curid=900634" title="Lev Gleason Publications">
<text>Lev Gleason Incorporated, formerly known as Lev Gleason Publishing, is a Canadian comic book company founded by Leverett Stone Gleason (1898–1971). They were the publisher of a number of popular comic books during the 1940s and early 1950s, including &quot;Daredevil Comics&quot;, &quot;Crime Does Not Pay&quot;, and &quot;Boy Comics&quot;. In 2021, Lev Gleason was revived by Fadi Hakim, and acquired the former Chapterhouse Comics and characters from Anglo-American Publishing.

==Background==
Lev Gleason Publications was an influential comic book publisher active from the late 1930s to the mid-1950s. Founded by Leverett Stone Gleason, a pioneer in the comic book industry, the company was best known for its crime comics, particularly the best-selling series Crime Does Not Pay (1942-1955). Gleason began his publishing career after working with Charles Max Gaines at Eastern Color Printing, which played a significant role in the early days of comic books. He labelled some of his books &quot;illustories&quot; to suggest they were a new, unique form.

Gleason had a keen eye for talent, hiring notable creators such as Jack Cole and Charles Biro. Biro was instrumental in shaping the company’s creative direction. Gleason and Biro worked on various genres, including superhero, mystery, romance, comedy, western, and children&#x27;s comics, reflecting their readership&#x27;s diverse interests.

Gleason&#x27;s career began in 1931 as an artist and advertising director for Open Road for Boys magazine. From 1932 to around 1934, he served as advertising manager under Harry Wildenberg at Eastern Color Printing, which became a comics-publishing pioneer in 1933 with the first American comic books. Gleason later worked as an editor at United Feature, where he launched Tip Top Comics in 1936. He then became business manager at Your Guide Publications, affiliated with Gilmor&#x27;s Friday, Inc. and New Friday, Inc. 

Around 1942, Gleason, then treasurer of New Friday, purchased the comic book series Silver Streak Comics and Daredevil Comics from the company. Under the imprint Comic House Inc., Gleason continued Silver Streak Comics with a crime comic, Crime Does Not Pay, which premiered with issue #22 in July 1942. That year, Gleason briefly published the left-wing political magazine Reader&#x27;s Choice.

The success of Crime Does Not Pay led to numerous imitators and increased criticism of comic books&#x27; influence. This pressure resulted in the formation of the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers (ACMP) in 1948 to avoid external regulation, with Gleason as a founding member. The ACMP was the precursor to the Comics Code Authority, established in 1954.

In April 1949, Lev Gleason Publications, then located at 114 East 32nd Street in Manhattan, began publishing Tops, a comics magazine for adults. Despite its commercial success, Gleason&#x27;s career was marked by controversy due to his progressive political views. As a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s, Gleason used his platform to promote social justice issues, making him a target during the post-WWII anti-communist campaigns, which contributed to the decline of his business.

Lev Gleason Publications went out of business in 1956. Its final publications were the teen-humor comic Jim Dandy #3 (Sept. 1956) and the children&#x27;s Western comedy Shorty Shiner #3 (Oct. 1956), both published under the imprint Dandy Magazines Inc.

=== Revival ===
Lev Gleason Incorporated emerged as a new entity, spearheaded by Fadi Hakim, then CEO of Chapterhouse Comics. They introduced several imprints: Comic House, Comic House Archives, Lev Gleason Library, and New Friday. These imprints manage distribution through Diamond Comics, Diamond Books, and Ingram Content Group.

Lev Gleason Incorporated debuted in 2020 with the release of &quot;American Daredevil,&quot; a comprehensive biography of Lev Gleason published by Chapterhouse Publishing and authored by Brett Dakin, Gleason’s great-nephew. The biography delves into Gleason&#x27;s life and his role as a progressive activist, drawing from family archives and FBI files.

The Lev Gleason Library, inspired by Gleason’s eponymous imprint, focuses on prose works. Its first release, &quot;Death Takes Centre Stage featuring Daredevil&quot; by D.K. Latta, was launched in April 2021.

New Friday serves as a platform for creator-owned books, paying homage to one of Lev Gleason’s early companies. The imprint debuted with &quot;HΩME Volume 1&quot; by the Michaud Brothers.

=== Comic House ===
The Comic House universe is a continuation of the Chapterhouse &quot;Chapterverse&quot;, which ended with Captain Canuck Season 4: Invasion. It introduced modern versions of iconic Lev Gleason golden age characters, including Captain Battle, CrimebusterSilver Streak, and Daredevil. Many of the series deal with the fallout of the alien attack on Earth by The Borealis, the alien race who bestowed Captain Canuck his powers.

<text>Yordan Dimitrov Radichkov (; 24 October 1929 – 21 January 2004) was a Bulgarian writer and playwright. 

Literary critics Adelina Angusheva and Galin Tihanov called him &quot;arguably the most significant voice of Bulgarian literature in the last third of the 20th century&quot;. Some literary critics have referred to him as the Bulgarian Kafka or Gogol. Radichkov is widely known for his numerous short stories, novels and plays. He is also known for the screenplays of the Bulgarian film classics &quot;Torrid Noon&quot; (1966) directed by Zako Heskiya, &quot;The Tied Up Balloon&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Last Summer&quot; (1974).

In 2000, Radichkov was decorated with the high government prize the Order of the Balkan Mountains. 
In 2007, a monument dedicated to him was officially opened at the garden of the former Royal Palace, nowadays National Art Gallery in Sofia city centre.

He was born as Yordan Dimitrov Radichkov on 24 October 1929 in a poor family in the village of Kalimanitza, Montana Province, Bulgaria. In 1947, he graduated from the high school in the town of Berkovitsa. Radichkov began his career in 1951 as Vratsa regional correspondent for the &quot;Narodna mladezh&quot; (National Youth) newspaper and editor (1952–1954) for the same paper. Between 1954 and 1960, he worked as editor for &quot;Vecherni Novini&quot; (&quot;Evening News&quot;) paper.

==Writing career==
Radichkov&#x27;s literary career began as he started writing short stories for the &quot;Vecherni novini&quot; (Evening News) newspaper and his early collections caught the attention of readers and critics. In 1959, he published his first full-length book, &quot;Sarczeto bie za horata&quot; (The Heart Beats for the People), followed by &quot;Prosti rutse&quot; (Simple Hands, 1961) and &quot;Oburnato nebe&quot; (A Sky Turned Upside Down, 1962), all written in the socialist-realist official style.

This romantic style was gradually replaced by a style of parody and the grotesque, with an increase in folkloristic elements, including folk fantasy and humor. Radichkov began parodying styles and reality: his works deprived objects of their natural dimensions and took them out of context; he combined disparate genres and transformed reality into a comic theater, defusing absurd aspects of life by means of laughter. A mixture of the fantastic and the real, Radichkov&#x27;s works combined images of industrial civilisation with those of a remote mythical past, and were sometimes defined as a Balkan magic realism. His parodic style was initially met with animosity from the ruling Communist party (he was often accused of primitivism, escapism and dark agnosticism). Much of his writing (prose and plays) draws on characters and the ethnography of his native North-West Bulgaria. The fact that his own village Kalimaniza was destroyed and it site is currently under the waters of the &quot;Ogosta&quot; dam (1983) became a recurring theme in his writing and another metaphor for the detachedness of the &quot;modern&quot; world from the one to which Radichkov brings his readers in his reminiscings. Another major theme of his writing is nature and wildlife. In his prose he makes a masterful use of the often chaotic and irrational manner villagers and hunters narrate stories. Over the years Radichkov has gained popularity and recognition in Bulgaria and the international community, including a Nobel Prize nomination.

Radichkov&#x27;s 1966 script for the film &quot;Goreshto pladne&quot; (Hot Noon) was a story about humanity&#x27;s efforts to save a trapped boy from drowning in a surging river and was a huge success for the writer. &quot;Baruten bukvar&quot; (Gunpowder Primer), his 1969 novel, was the first in his homeland to talk about socialism through a powerful blend of profanity, fantasy and folkloric wisdom rather than simple idealization. The award-winning &quot;Posledno liato&quot; (The Last Summer, 1974) is a parable of a man trying desperately to stay faithful to his own identity in a dynamically changing world.

He also wrote a number of domestically and internationally acclaimed children&#x27;s books. Of these &quot; Nie Vrabchetata&quot; (We, the Sparrows) has gained particular popularity in Bulgaria.

Radichkov often illustrated his works with his own abstract drawings that have become another hallmark of his artistic presence.

Radichkov is particularly famous for his language and his use of dialectisms. Critics have stated that &quot;the real main character in the work of Radichkov is the word&quot;. Probably the greatest manifestation of Radichkov&#x27;s impact on Bulgarian culture is the fact that his work introduced a number of neologisms and expressions in the every-day Bulgarian language.

==Awards and public recognition==
Radichkov has been awarded a wide number of awards for literature, theatre, and film, both in his homeland and abroad, among them the &quot;Order of Stara Planina&quot; (the highest order of Bulgaria, 2003), a finalist for the Italian Grinzane Cavour Prize (1984) and the prize of the International Academy of the Arts in Paris (1993). A founding member, and first president (1984–1991) of the Bulgarian-Swedish Association for Friendship, he received the Swedish national Order of the Polar Star (1988).

He was a prominent figure in Bulgaria&#x27;s public life – a member of the Union of Bulgarian Writers since 1962, he was elected MP for the Bulgarian Socialist Party in 2001, but quickly resigned in disagreement and spent the last years of his life increasingly withdrawn from politics.

Radichkov&#x27;s works have been translated in more than 30 languages and in 2001 he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Honour==
Radichkov Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Yordan Radichkov.

<text>Democrats Abroad is the official organization of the Democratic Party for United States citizens living temporarily or permanently abroad. The organization is given state-level recognition by the Democratic National Committee.

Democrats Abroad currently has members in more than 197 countries, with 48 organized country committees. There are committees in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. These committees are formally represented by the Democratic Party Committee Abroad (DPCA). Some countries with particularly large concentrations of Democratic expatriates even have local chapters.

==Voting from abroad==
One of the prime functions of Democrats Abroad is to assist U.S. citizens abroad in voter registration. To this end, it has created the website VoteFromAbroad.org which overseas U.S. citizens (Democrats and non-members alike) can use to register to vote. Since Presidents and members of Congress are elected by state, U.S. citizens abroad vote in the state in which they have most recently lived, each of which has its own registration and voting procedures.

The VoteFromAbroad.org website asks voters which state they last lived in and then starts a wizard specific to their state that asks for the information necessary to comply with the election laws of that state. After all the information has been supplied, a PDF is created, which the voter can then print, sign, and mail to the address provided (or sometimes fax, or scan and attach to email).

Several weeks before the election, the Board of Elections or County Registrar (states use various names) sends the voter an absentee ballot which the voter then fills out and sends back in order to cast their vote.
==Activities==
In addition to helping U.S. citizens living overseas to register to vote, Democrats Abroad engages in many other activities, mostly on a per country or per locality basis. Among other things, Democrats Abroad:
*Provides help where there are problems with absentee ballots
*Organizes lectures, debates, and other events on political topics, often with guest speakers
*Strengthens contact between U.S. ambassadors and consuls and overseas U.S. citizens
*Lobbies Congress on expatriate issues (e.g. citizenship for children born abroad etc.)
*Represents U.S. citizens abroad in the Democratic National Committee
*Raises funds for the Democratic Party
*Runs a website containing news for U.S. citizens abroad

==Leadership==
Democrats Abroad has eight officers. All of them are elected. Officers include:
*International Chair – Martha McDevitt-Pugh
*International Vice Chair – Steve Nardi
*International Treasurer – Daniela Salvioni
*International Secretary – Karen Frankenstein
*International Counsel – Anne Brady
*Regional Vice Chair for the Americas – John Chudy
*Regional Vice Chair for Asia/Pacific – Suma Shamanna
*Regional Vice Chair for Europe, Middle East and Africa – Jennifer Rakow-Stepper

Democrats Abroad is represented on the Democratic National Committee by eight members. The International Chair and Vice Chair are ex-officio members of the DNC.

Democrats Abroad has caucuses representing interest groups such as the Global AAPI Caucus, the Global Black Caucus, the Global Disabilities Caucus, the Global Hispanic Caucus, the Global LGBT+ Caucus, the Global Progressive Caucus, the Global Veterans and Military Families Caucus, the Global Women&#x27;s Caucus, and the Global Youth Caucus.

==History==
Democrats Abroad was started with two small committees in London and Paris after Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in the 1964 U.S. presidential election. Its original leaders, Toby Hyde and Al Davidson, raised funds and formed committees, and pushed for state-level recognition of Democrats Abroad. DNC Chairman John Bailey allowed Democrats Abroad to send nine non-voting representatives to the Democratic National Convention in 1972; in 1976, the group was granted the status of a state committee, with voting delegates in the convention.

Over the years, Democrats Abroad has worked for securing the full citizenship rights for U.S. citizens living abroad. It has lobbied for marriage equality, so that U.S. citizens in same-sex partnerships with citizens of other countries would not be denied the right to live together in the U.S. It supports reform of tax laws that unfairly burden U.S. citizens abroad. In particular, the group has long worked for voting rights for U.S. citizens at home and abroad, including supporting the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act in 1986, and the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot. 

Democrats Abroad switched its method of determining convention delegates from a primary to an open caucus in 1992. In 2008, Democrats Abroad switched back to a primary process.

==Primaries==

Democrats Abroad sends a delegation to the Democratic National Convention every four years and has done so since 1976.

<doc id="900643" wikidata="Q3547336" url="?curid=900643" title="USA Track &amp; Field">
<text>USA Track &amp; Field (USATF) is a United States national governing body for the sports of track and field, cross country running, road running, and racewalking (known as the sport of athletics outside the US). The USATF was known between 1979 and 1992 as &quot;The Athletics Congress&quot; (TAC) after its spin-off from the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), which governed the sport in the US through most of the 20th century until the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 dissolved its responsibility. Based in Indianapolis, USATF is a non-profit organization with a membership of more than 130,000. The organization has three key leadership positions: CEO Max Siegel, Board of Directors Chair Steve Miller, and elected president Vin Lananna. U.S. citizens and permanent residents can be USATF members (annual individual membership fee: $30 for 18-year-old members and younger, $55 for the rest), but permanent residents can only participate in masters events in the country, and they cannot win USATF medals, prize money, or score points for a team, per World Athletics regulations.

USA Track &amp; Field is involved in many aspects of the sport at the local, national, and international level, providing the rules, officials, coaching education, sports science and athlete development, youth programs, masters (age 25+) competition, the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, and an annual meeting. It also organizes the annual USA Track and Field Outdoor Championships, the USA Track &amp; Field Indoor Championships, the USA Cross Country Championships, the USATF National Club Cross Country Championships, and the USATF National Club Track &amp; Field Championships. Through its sanctioning program, the national body provides the insurance coverage necessary for members to rent facilities, thus allowing for competitive opportunities for all athletes to happen. USA Track and Field has held National conventions since the 1870s or 1880s. NAAA Track and Field Championship and Convention locations Dec 3–6, 2020, virtually; earlier announced the 2020 USATF Annual Meeting to be held virtually instead of face-to-face.

==History==
On April 22, 1879 National Association of Amateur Athletes of America (NAAA) was formed and later replaced by the AAU x NAAA Track and Field Championship and Convention locations. On January 21, 1888, in the city of New York, rower and runner William B. Curtis and James Edward Sullivan founded what officially became, the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) x AAU Convention Locations. The AAU governed the sport of track and field in the United States until 1979 when, the first Amateur Sports Act of 1978 decreed that the AAU could no longer hold international franchises for more than one sport. The enactment of the Amateur Sports Act was prompted by lobbying by athletes, particularly runners, who felt that the AAU imposed artificial rules preventing widespread participation in sports.

The Athletics Congress (TAC) emerged from the AAU in late 1979, when its first annual meeting was conducted in Las Vegas, in conjunction with the annual AAU Convention. A constitutional convention was subsequently held in Dallas–Fort Worth in 1980.

In 1992, TAC changed its name to USA Track &amp; Field (USATF) to increase recognition for the organization and for the sport in the United States. However, USATF inherited from AAU the 57 regional associations that are responsible for promoting the sport in a particular state or locality. Many of these associations were viewed as unaccountable to their members and some were accused of operating in a racially discriminatory manner. In addition, in some areas, the AAU continues to organize track and field events, including youth running programs.

In response, the USATF restructured the Associations and adopted Regulation 15, which set minimum standards for association performance and called for biannual accreditation of each association under those standards.

In May 2008, the United States Olympic Committee notified USATF that its governance was deficient and threatened to remove its national governing body status unless major reforms were made. In response, at USATF&#x27;s December 2008 Convention, the size of its board of directors was reduced from 31 members who had represented constituencies within the organization to 15, and none of the new directors could have an operating role in the organization. Most of the new board members represented sponsoring organizations. On February 18, 2009, the members of the new, reduced Board were announced.

===2020 Olympic Trials held in 2021===
The United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC) and the TrackTown USA Local Organizing Committee announced the release of the updated competition schedule for the postponed 2020 U.S. Olympic Team Trials – Track and Field, that took place in June 18–27, 2021, at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon.

===Recent Highlights===
Since the founding of the new board and the hiring of Siegel as CEO, USATF in 2016 achieved his highest medal count at an Olympics since 1936 (32) and its most-ever medals at a world championships, by winning 30 at the 2017 IAAF World Championships. The organization has seen explosive growth of its budget and sponsor ranks, with the annual budget growing from $22M to nearly $37M. In 2016, it established an &quot;Athlete Revenue Distribution Model&quot; that provided additional money to elite athletes.

===Controversy===
At the 2014 annual meeting, the member delegates voted 392–70 to re-nominate Robert Hersh as the USATF&#x27;s nominee to the IAAF council. At the time, Hersh was the sitting senior vice-president of the IAAF council and by virtue of that position, a USATF board member. However, the reconstituted Board disregarded the vote of the member delegates and instead voted 11–1 to nominate president Stephanie Hightower as the nominee to the IAAF council. The Board&#x27;s action caused such a controversy that USATF sent an email two days later to all of its members attempting to explain its action. The email wrote, &quot;This is a different era and a different time. We think Stephanie Hightower provides us with the best chance to move forward as part of that change.&quot; Hightower later that summer, at the IAAF Congress, was elected to IAAF Council with the most votes of all candidates and led to all USATF candidates for IAAF positions being elected. In 2018, after serving on the IAAF Council for four years, Hightower came up for reelection. She was defeated by a vote of the delegates in favor of Willie Banks.

In 2016, Vin Lananna was elected president of USATF. On February 18, 2018, Lananna was place on &quot;temporary administrative leave&quot; pending a federal investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service into possible criminal conflict of interest in regards to the awarding of the 2021 World Championships in Athletics to Eugene, Oregon. Lananna was also the long time president of TrackTown USA, the hosting organization for the World Championships and had hosted the 2016 IAAF World Indoor Championships. Lananna is also an Associate Athletic Director at the University of Oregon, the host stadium of the event. Lamine Diack was the IAAF president in April 2015 at the time of the award and is under house arrest in France on charges of corruption. The 2021 Championships were awarded in an unconventional fashion, without the usual formal bidding process. The selection of the host city was announced on April 16, 2015, in Beijing. Eugene previously did put in a bid for the 2019 World Championships, losing to Qatar. The choice of Eugene will make the 2021 event the first held in the United States. &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot; magazine reported that Eugene&#x27;s selection by World Athletics, then known as the International Association of Athletics Federations, was an &quot;unusual move&quot;. They report the choice of Eugene will make the 2021 event &quot;the first held in the United States.&quot; The event will be the second held in North America, after Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 2001. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the lack of bidding triggered concern in European cities that had bid to host the event.
They quoted Lamine Diack, IAAF president, who justified the lack of bidding with the claim the selection of Eugene to host the event, &quot;enables us to take advantage of a unique opportunity to host a financially successful tournament that may never arise again.&quot;

Despite this, the lack of bidding for the 2021 event was not unprecedented: the 2007 World Championships were awarded to Osaka, Japan, without bidding. On July 17, 2018, Lananna also resigned as president of TrackTown USA, but has not left his position at the university. Since February 18, 2018, the interim USATF president has been Mike Conley.

==Affiliations==
USA Track &amp; Field is the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) member federation in the United States. USATF is a member of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) and selects teams for Olympic and Pan American Games competitions. To select the athletes for the Olympic Games, every Olympiad USATF conducts the Olympic Trials.

USATF also has membership in, or close affiliations with, the NCAA, the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), the Road Runners Club of America (RRCA), Running USA, and many community-based and disabled sports organizations.

USA Track &amp; Field is a Founding Sports Partner of the Sports Museum of America, joining more than 50 other single-sport Halls of Fame, National Governing Bodies, Museums and other organizations across North America to richly celebrate the history, grandeur and significance of sports in American culture. Set to open in New York City on May 7, 2008, the Sports Museum of America will showcase both USA Track &amp; Field and the National Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame in its Hall of Halls Gallery (along with providing an annual donation) in return for sharing some of the hall of fame&#x27;s valuable artifacts and their support of the creation of the Nation&#x27;s first all-sports museum experience.

==Associations==
USATF is composed of 57 Associations, which are the localized administrative districts. For competition, each association is obligated to conduct (local) association championships. This is the initial rung in the competition tournaments that lead to various national championships, though many national championships do not require participation at the lower level. Generally, the associations follow state borders, but in the cases of smaller states, several states are combined into one association, and in the case of larger states, the state is divided into multiple associations in order to more effectively serve clusters of the population base. Most association borders parallel the initial associations created by the AAU, though there has been some adjustment to those defined borders since, including the creation of new associations. Dependent upon the association fulfilling its obligations to its membership and the number of members in the association, each association is allowed to send a delegation of representatives to the National Meeting in early December each year. This is the primary means through which the local constituents are able to have a voice in the direction the national organization. Individual members may also attend the meetings, though voting is carefully controlled by the by-laws, based on the participation of various constituent groups. The National Meeting is the only time political business, rule changes and record ratification can be transacted by most wings of the organization.

==Competitors==
Many of the more than 130,000 members of USATF participate in athletics competitions through one of the thousands of clubs established in all 50 states. While most of these members participate as athletes, coaches, officials and supporters of athletics at the grassroots level, elite athletes who represent the US in international competition are also required to be members of USATF. USATF also has 57 Associations to promote the sport locally, and membership in USATF also constitutes membership in a local association, with the dues being divided between the national and local group.

During the 1980s and 1990s, USATF encouraged major marathons to require USATF membership as a prerequisite to entering those races. However, all marathons dropped this requirement for non-elite runners, causing the adult membership in USATF to drop dramatically in the 2000s. In some USATF associations, the number of youth members far exceeds the number of adult members.

Today, USATF competes for youth membership with a parallel effort from the AAU, and with road racer/adult recreational runner membership with the Road Runners Club of America (RRCA) and its member clubs. In many cases, youth track clubs join both USATF and AAU so that they can compete in both sets of track meets, and adult running clubs join both RRCA and USATF. However, unlike USATF which requires each individual runner to also become a member of USATF in order to compete in events or gain other membership benefits, when a club joins RRCA, all of its members automatically become members of RRCA as well. As a result, RRCA has grown to 180,000 individual or family members compared with 130,000 USATF members, many of whom are children.

To the general public, the similarity in terminology used by the organizations&#x27; events can lead to confusion. For example, both USATF and AAU conduct a series of track meets called the Junior Olympics and USATF, AAU and RRCA conduct separate National Championships and State Championships. Both AAU and USATF operate 57 state or local Associations, although the boundaries of their service areas are no longer exactly the same.

Regarding the funding of promising post-collegiate athletes, USATF competes with RRCA&#x27;s Road Scholars program to select athletes for stipends.

==Championship series==
In 1999, the USATF established the Golden Spike Tour – later the Visa Championship Series (VCS) – to showcase track and field in America and to facilitate the broadcast of key events on national television networks. Using innovative meet formats, the VCS helps repackage the sport, draws new fans and new sponsors, and provides increased financial incentives for USATF athletes. The VCS fills indoor arenas and outdoor stadiums across the country. Athletes compete for prize money at each meet, and the top athletes share in a bonus pool of $100,000. The last meet of the season is the USA Track &amp; Field Indoor Championships. Most focus on the USA Track &amp; Field Outdoor Championships to make IAAF World Championships in Athletics and Athletics at the Summer Olympics teams.

==USA Masters Track and Field Championship==

Masters athletics has several Championship competitions:

# USATF Masters Outdoor Championships began July 1968 and have been held every year (except 2020).
# USATF Masters Indoor Championships began March 1975 and have been held every year (except 2020).
# USA Track and Field is considering (2020) adding the 25-29 age bracket for the USA National Masters Outdoor Track and Field Championship. Age 30-34 is already competing at the USA National Masters Outdoor Track and Field Championship.
# World Masters Athletics Championships began August 1975 in Canada and continue to today.

<text>Sarajevo Tobacco Factory (; abbr. FDS) was a cigarette producer with headquarters in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==History==
The Sarajevo Tobacco Factory was founded in 1880, only two years after the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1878. FDS was one of the first four industries in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For eighty years, FDS was located in Marijin Dvor, nowadays, a center of the city. At its founding, FDS consisted of only two buildings, production and administration. As production grew, the FDS complex became larger. It was finally formed in 1891, when the last of ten buildings was constructed. This situation remained until the middle of the last century.

As the complex of FDS became larger, the number of employees also increased. In that early stage, it was mostly unskilled female labor. The first products of FDS were the cut tobacco packets produced manually in the device called “avan”. Tobacco used for these packets was of a different grade, and the packets were also different. During the Austro-Hungarian period, this product was exported.

The production of cigarettes started in 1882. They were produced manually until 1905 when the first automatic cigarette maker was obtained. By the beginning of World War I, FDS marketed 23 brands. They were packed in boxes made of wood, tin and cardboard. The smallest packet contained five and the largest one hundred cigarettes.

FDS stagnated between the two world wars, specially in respect to its equipment. Still, during that period 55 different machines were provided, some of them intended for fabrication of the cut tobacco packets and cigarettes and the rest were machine tools for the workshop. The production and packing of the cut tobacco and several brands of oval and round cigarettes continued also in this period. Cigarettes were packed in packets of 100 and even 500.

At the very beginning of the World War II the cut tobacco production decreased due to lower market demand. In this period, cigarette production also varied from year to year. During the war, FDS did not stop production, but it was dictated by the occupier. Ever since its foundation, for more than one century now, FDS has experienced many turbulent periods caused by the change of government and different social and political systems, but it has never stopped operating and producing.
===After World War 2===
FDS achieved success, not only in the market of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also abroad including Egypt, Russia, Turkey and Japan.

The policy of FDS was to rely on its own labor. In 1946, the first machine (an automatic carton cutting machine) was constructed. Those machines, invented and constructed by the employees of FDS, were used in FDS and also sold to other companies in the former Yugoslavia. The machines designed in FDS include Glibo I to Glibo V. Today, the machines are primarily important as museum pieces, as they indicate the technological process in the factory.

In order to extend and modernize the facilities, a new factory complex was built in 1960 in the Pofalići area, occupying about 40 000 m2. The complex consisted of several buildings and reached its final appearance in 1971, when the construction was completed. Construction was completely financed by the employees of FDS, setting a precedent at that time and in such an environment.

From 1971 the factory was modernized, with new, modern equipment to meet new technologies in the production of cigarettes. In that way the factory became one of the most modern tobacco plants in Europe and a leader in the area of former Yugoslavia. All the activities intended for the upgrade of the production process and education of the employees resulted in the signing of a contract with Philip Morris to make Marlboro cigarettes in 1970. Implementation of this contract started in 1971 and was successful until 1992, when it was broken up due to the war.

In the history of FDS, several periods may be identified:
# The Austro-Hungarian period, when the factory operated to meet the requirements of the ruling Austro-Hungarian authorities.
# The Kingdom of Yugoslavia, when the factory considerably stagnated due to the monopolistic treatment by authorities from Belgrade.
# After the Second World War, when FDS recorded very good business results despite frequent unfavorable working conditions. During this period, which lasted for almost fifty years, FDS became materially a very strong factory and employed highly skilled workers who managed to keep up with European and world trends in the tobacco industry.
# The most difficult period for FDS was during the Bosnian war, from 1992 to 1995. Although severely damaged, FDS did not stop production. After the company suffered commercial losses for several years in a row, laid off employees and discontinued cigarette brands, the Austrian company CID Adriatic Investments GmbH bought out the company&#x27;s shares. 

As of May 27, 2022, the factory has closed and it is unknown whether production will start again.

==Brands==
The brands produced by FDS until now are: Damen, Hercegovina, Bosna, Guslar, Drina, Sarajevo, Mostar, Neretva, Štefanija, Foča, Flor, Vrbas, Morava, Sarajka, Start, Sutjestka, Zeta, Internacional, Ibar, Drava, Morava-crvena, Drina-denifine, Lara, Skend, Marlboro, Bond, Alfa, Sedef, Specijal, Wind, Bosnae, Drina jedina bijela, Drina jedina bijela, Drina jedina zlatna, Drina lights, Drina super lights, AurA extra, AurA lights, AurA super lights, Tigra medium, Multi Nova, Code and 8 (Eight).

<doc id="900657" wikidata="Q7272711" url="?curid=900657" title="Quiz machine">
<text>Quiz machine is a term used in the UK for commercial coin-operated video quiz games that offer cash prizes for winning performances. It is a type of slot machine in which the player must answer questions in addition to, or instead of, matching symbols. These machines are usually found sited in pubs, bars, and other places of entertainment. The term quiz machine is often used interchangeably with the trade term SWP (skill with prize) although not all SWP games are quiz based.

== History ==
The quiz machine first appeared on the scene in the UK in 1985. The first such machine was called Quizmaster which was made by the Cardiff based now defunct Coinmaster Ltd. This was rapidly followed by quiz machines from other manufacturers.

Over the following years quiz machines/SWP&#x27;s became a regular feature of the British pub. Leading SWP manufacturers of the 1980s and 1990s were: Coinmaster, JPM, Barcrest, Bell-Fruit, Maygay and Ace-Coin. The themes of many SWP games were (and still are) based on popular TV quiz shows, board games or other aspects of popular culture. 

Initially quiz machines were 20p play offering a £10 maximum prize per play. This was increased to £12 in 1988 and £20 around 1991. Appearing in 1994 JPM&#x27;s Monopoly SWP was the first 50p play machine. It was also the first machine to use touch screen technology instead of buttons.

In the late 1990s a few quiz machines/SWPs offered £40 jackpots. Although many new quiz machines during this period actually offered lower jackpot prizes such as £5, and had gameplays and payout structures that seemed designed to frustrate professional players. In 2000 the quiz machine market reached new highs in player participation with the arrival of the highly popular &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; quiz machine.

== Professional quiz machine players ==
The arrival on the scene in 1985 of SWP/quiz machines quickly led to the existence of a cohort of professional and semi-professional players. These were people who became highly skilled on particular games being able to learn and memorise nearly entire question sets for a particular machine. They could then make substantial incomes from touring many different quiz machine locations and extracting money from the particular types of machine in which they were skilled. 

Over the years the size of quiz machine question sets has steadily increased, with the extensive use of &quot;spoiler&quot; questions to make large multiple wins difficult or impossible. Since the mid-1990s gameplay formats have also become a lot less &quot;Pro&quot; friendly. Today it is still possible for very skilled players to make worthwhile money playing SWPs, but it is much harder than in the past.

== The quiz machine/SWP today ==
A fundamental change occurred in the nature of SWPs in the early 2000s. Single games in stand-alone cabinets were discontinued and replaced by multi-game terminals. Some of these can run a choice of up to 25-30 different games on the same machine. Some are also able to provide services other than gaming. These units can be managed and updated remotely through an ISDN or ADSL network connection. 

Leading multigame terminals and their manufacturers at present are: 

* itbox made by Maygay Ltd and originally used exclusively by Leisure Link, all machines are now owned by GamesTec.
* FatBox Slim made by Fat Spanner 
* and Indego made by GamesMedia/Channel1
* Gamesnet made by GamesTec

Today most SWP/quiz machine games offer a nominal £20 jackpot for 50p play and a few offer £40 for £1 play. But on present day games the payout is carefully controlled and manipulated by the software. Payout levels are set at lower levels than previously.

== Legal grey areas ==
An SWP machine must offer the chance to win the jackpot on every game; however, the level of skill involved to do that is set so high as to be virtually impossible. Manufacturers have, at times, set the skill level so high that it is physically impossible to achieve this. Because there is no governing body for skill games, the only time this is brought into question is when the gaming authorities are alerted and take court action to prove or disprove that this is the case. In practice, this is very rare, as the gaming authorities have no jurisdiction over skill machines, and the only way for a prosecution to succeed is to prove that the game in question breaks the law in some way.

This can be done by proving that the machine differs from the legal definition of a skill machine which says that a player must be allowed to win prizes by skill alone. If there is an element of luck in the game it is automatically classed as a game of chance and is legally bound by the gambling commission legislation.

Many manufacturers push this boundary to the limit and sometimes into the grey area of legal definitions beyond.

The stake/prize level of a skill machine is also a grey area, as there is no legal limit on either, although most manufacturers abide by a gentleman&#x27;s agreement with BACTA (a trade organisation) to limit both amounts to levels that are unlikely to attract the attention of legislators. Skill machines can legally be sited anywhere and played by anyone of any age, although there seems to be a lot of confusion about this, with some people assuming age limits and site restrictions must exist because of the similarity between these machines and AWP (&quot;amusement with prize&quot;) machines, such as one-armed bandits.

<text>Englands Helicon is an anthology of Elizabethan pastoral poems compiled by John Flaskett, and first published in 1600. There was an enlarged edition in 1614. The word Helicon refers to the Greek mountain on which, in Greek mythology, two springs sacred to the Muses were located.

The poets involved cannot all be identified, since there are a number of poems marked as &#x27;anonymous&#x27;. The others were written by Edmund Bolton, William Byrd, Henry Chettle, Michael Drayton, Robert Greene, Christopher Marlowe, Anthony Munday, George Peele, Walter Raleigh, Henry Constable, William Shakespeare, Edward de Vere, Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, John Wootton, William Smith. The most celebrated poem is Marlowe&#x27;s &#x27;Come live with me and be my love&#x27;. This and several other lyrics have musical settings extant, in this case by William Corkine.

<doc id="900660" wikidata="Q74279" url="?curid=900660" title="Iron rice bowl">
<text>&quot;Iron rice bowl&quot; () is a Chinese term for an occupation with guaranteed job security, similar to life tenure. Traditionally, people considered to have such positions include military personnel, members of the civil service, as well as employees of various state-owned enterprises (through the mechanism of the work unit).

== Origin ==
The origin of the term &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; came from Jǐ Yún&#x27;s journal, &quot;Notes of the Thatched Abode of Close Observations&quot; (): A beautiful maid works in a squire&#x27;s home. One day, the maid breaks a bowl, but the squire does not punish her because of her beauty. After that, the maid breaks more and more bowls. In response, the squire decides to change all of the bowls to iron bowls. The maid does not need to work, but she still gets paid. Therefore, the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; is described as a stable or even a lifelong occupation that provides steady income and welfare, and the two key terms of the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; are job entry guarantee and exit control.

== History ==
After the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established in 1949, private-owned enterprises were replaced by state-owned enterprises. Based on its needs, the government also established public institutions. According to Article 2 of the Interim Regulation on the Registration of Public Institutions:
The term &quot;public institutions&quot; as mentioned in the present Regulation refers to the public service organizations that are established by the state organs or other organizations by using the state-owned assets for the purpose of engaging in activities of education, science and technology, culture and hygiene.

As a result, the state became the main recruiter and employer. The state not only paid employees&#x27; salaries, but also provided social benefits, which ranged from gifts in Chinese festivals and holidays to welfare and retirement plans. Because these state-run enterprise and institutions guaranteed lifelong employment, employees were paid the same salary. There was a phrase to describe the situation: &quot;No matter whether one works or not, one gets paid thirty-six a month&quot;. Because there was no merit pay, workers were less motivated. Therefore, most sectors experienced the issue of employment redundancy. The effect of employment redundancy includes employees&#x27; low efficiency and employers&#x27; high-cost.

Initiated from the establishment of the PRC, the iron rice bowl was one of the main slogans for communism: the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was supposed to provide job opportunities for everyone. The CCP&#x27;s promise to the Chinese people was crucial because almost half of the urban labor force was experiencing unemployment when the party took control. Due to the Japanese invasion and the Civil War directly afterwards, the Republic of China (ROC) suffered from hyperinflation from 1948 to 1949. Money became worthless and the basic life of the urban population became unsustainable. The adoption of the iron rice bowl provided security for people.

Even though employment was high during the Great Leap Forward period (1958–62), after its failure, many projects that were proposed then were shut down. As a result, the government needed to remove around 20 percent of the labor force. The size of the iron rice bowl was shrinking.

When Deng Xiaoping began his labor reforms in the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the 1980s to boost economic productivity, the government iron rice bowl jobs were some of the first to go. He transformed China from a centrally-planned economy to a more free-market economy, his supporters insisted that the iron rice bowl had to be smashed if China was to modernize. During the 1978 Rural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping implicitly set an end to the iron rice bowl with the implementation of a number of economic reforms that were meant to embrace free markets. These reforms included the replacement of the collective farming system with a &quot;household responsibility system,&quot; under which households could contract land, machinery, and facilities from collective organizations in order to make independent operating decisions without losing the value of unified, collective management. This meant that farmers were able to personally benefit financially from their own crops, as households were able to get rid of surpluses in production as long as they were able to fulfill the collective quotas. The adoption of the contract system in rural China increased productivity and food supplies in those areas.

Deng Xiaoping also introduced reforms that made prices more flexible and allowed them to rise above the government-mandated price floors. In 1980, the government sought to end the system of lifelong employment for workers in state-owned enterprises by using fixed-term contracts to hire new labor, which they hoped would allow companies to refrain from renewing workers&#x27; contracts if they were not qualified, efficient, or capable enough. Under this new system, workers were examined and worked for six months on probationary terms, before a long-term contract for 3–5 years was negotiated. Children were also no longer able to fill their parent&#x27;s position automatically if their parents no longer worked for that company. Further changes included an expansion of reasons for which an employee could be fired, as well as the ability of an employer to refuse a routine job transfer. Workers were additionally to refrain from arguing with an unsatisfied customer to the point of losing a sale, which was particularly relevant in customer-based industries, such as restaurant businesses and retail.

The Chinese Constitution was amended in 1992, when Deng Xiaoping garnered the political backing and CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin provided the initiative. The revised constitution scrapped the planned economy under public ownership in favor of a &quot;socialist market economy&quot; with &quot;Chinese characteristics&quot; that welcomed diversified forms of ownership, especially &quot;privately-owned, individually-owned, and foreign-invested&quot; enterprises. Still, public ownership at all levels of government remained dominant. At the 15th CCP National Congress in September 1997, Jiang announced that reforms of medium-sized and large state enterprises would be accelerated. He proposed two new initiatives: major lay-offs (laid-off workers in China still receive minimal salaries) and divestiture of smaller state enterprises through mergers, leasing, selloffs, and, in some cases, bankruptcy. Since then, the government has indicated it is willing to go much further, announcing plans to sell more than 10,000 of China&#x27;s 13,000 medium-sized and large state enterprises.

As a condition for joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China had to &quot;break the Iron Rice bowl&quot;, a step that was disputed by some economists. Breaking the iron rice bowl caused a major loss of state-supported savings. China&#x27;s domestic savings decreased in the late 1990s and early 2000s, before rising sharply in 2008.

Efforts to break the iron rice bowl continued in Guangdong province in 2011 with a new plan of grassroots recruitment, employment by contract, and pay based on performance. The new arrangement was to be included in the 12th five-year plan of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (2011–2015).

== Current situation ==
Since the start of post-Cultural Revolution reform in 1977, large numbers of workers in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been laid off while government workers retained job security. Up to this day, government officials () still have &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; lifelong job security, a circumstance often blamed for inefficiency and corruption. According to the Statistical Bulletin on the Development of Human Resources and Social Security in 2015 published by Ministry of Human Resources and Social of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 30 May 2016, as of the end of 2015, there were 7.167 million government officials in China.

== Problems ==
Some scholars claim that lifetime employment and seniority promotion systems are not the root of the problem. The key issue pertains to the contradiction between individual, collective, and state interests. The state-owned enterprises had to surrender all profits to the state, and income was paid in accordance with a nationwide wage scale, with little relationship to the financial situation of the enterprise. Employees and workers were not able to develop a strong economic identity with their enterprises since the economic performance of the enterprise had little effect on the individual&#x27;s economic gains or losses. This was one of the reasons for the general lack of work incentive in Chinese enterprises under Mao and to a large extent remains the case today. Scholars argue that &quot;The crux of the issue of workers&#x27; incentives lay with the state-oriented ethos rather than the practice of lifetime employment&quot;.

Given the fact that the positions of government officials were not threatened by China&#x27;s previous efforts to shatter the iron rice bowl, and that workers at SOE&#x27;s experienced disproportionate unemployment, scholars predict that there is possibility that the unbalance could lead to public dissatisfaction with the government. If the government fails to settle or compensate the newly unemployed, the CCP potentially faces the destruction of the social stability that has sustained its reform program, laying the groundwork for possible grassroots uprisings.

== Economic impact ==
Scholars claim that the iron rice bowl kept China from reaching its economic potential and reaching maximum productivity, as lifelong employment guarantee left managers and company owners with little to no incentive to respond to market signals. Similarly, workers who received a paycheck regardless of how much they produced, had no incentive to be more efficient and produce more output. However, this is not the only reason China fell behind economically. State enterprises lacked new technologies that were already being used in other countries, due to the high costs of providing required public services and upholding the wages promised by the state. This ultimately led to low levels of productivity, and little economic growth. Yet, the government, which relied on the iron rice bowl for social stability in order to maintain authoritarian control, was hesitant to smash the iron rice bowl in order to achieve economic growth.

During the time of China&#x27;s economic reform in 1978, with soft budget constraints and the requirement to implement the government&#x27;s goal of full-employment, the SOE sector had substantial redundant labor and many state owned firms were operating at a loss. In 1995 and 1996, around 50% of the SOEs (mostly small or medium-sized) reported losses (Meng, 2003). The Asian financial crisis in 1997 exacerbated the situation. The Chinese government was forced to take actions to improve efficiency of the SOEs and to stem losses.

== Women and the iron rice bowl ==
While the New Marriage Law was the first legal document under the Communist Party which was supposed to guarantee women&#x27;s rights, women were still largely unprotected under the New Marriage Law. The establishment of the All-China Democratic Women&#x27;s Federation (ACWF) did not help to improve women&#x27;s status significantly. In order to achieve gender equality, women needed to join the labor force as men did. However, neither the CCP nor the ACWF tried to create jobs for most women because China&#x27;s economy had not yet grown enough to be capable of including so many women in the labor force. As a result, even after 1949, most Chinese women in rural areas still did not join the workforce: most women&#x27;s lives stayed the same. They remained at home as caretakers. Only educated women were given part-time jobs opportunities.

Although the Great Leap Forward was a failure, women&#x27;s employment opportunities were improving during that period. Unrealistic quotas were set, both in industry and in agriculture. In order to achieve mass production, a larger labor force was necessary. Therefore, men were mobilized to work on mining, irrigation or the other industrial projects while agricultural work, which was traditionally taken care of by men, was left behind. In order to maintain agricultural work, women were mobilized to do the agricultural work. Because both men and women were working outside, the CCP founded dining halls to supply food for all workers and collective childcare. Women were liberated to a certain extent from their domestic work because the CCP needed their labor to accelerate production. Although women were finally able to go out to work, they sacrificed their health during that time period: they suffered from lack of nutrition and overwork.

== Taiwan and Hong Kong ==
The iron rice bowl&#x27;s position as a main feature of the government within the PRC is relatively unique for the region. The iron rice bowl was not as prevalent in Taiwan as it was in mainland China. Taiwan has fewer state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and more foreign-owned companies, and therefore lacks the infrastructure for a state welfare system like the one China had maintained. In this respect, Taiwan has also not experienced the unrest from workers who have lost their job security and benefits, largely escaping the destabilizing effects of rapid modernization.

Hong Kong has historically been a center for foreign investment and home to fewer SOEs. The area&#x27;s market reforms and status as a special economic zone meant that the presence of the iron rice bowl was mitigated, as Hong Kong has been more exposed to market pressures, especially those of the international market. Recently, government employment in Hong Kong has been seen as less desirable because of poor job environment and lowered job requirements. There has also been increased hostility towards the management of the welfare state in Hong Kong.

The popular conception of the security of government jobs contrasts with the perception in other parts of China, where young students still see the bureaucracy as a promising chance for employment and upward mobility.

== Other uses ==
In the Western world, the term has a similar usage. It has been popularized by Richard Lindzen in reference to government-funded scientists and labs that use their research results to justify continued government funding. Lindzen&#x27;s thesis is that the intrinsic link between reporting and funding provides incentives to report research results in such a way as to ensure continued funding. The related term &quot;rice bowl&quot; often refers to a military project which is being protected in the interests of a particular department rather than wider needs.

The term is also used to some extent in Singapore, a former British colony where the majority of citizens are ethnically Chinese. It is also used in Korea () as a name for officials, not only because of their job stability, but also because of stable income. This phrase alludes to the jobs of civil servants being so stable that they would always be able to earn enough money to at least put food on the table. At the same time, civil servants must do their work to live just as rice is the staple of many Singaporean diets.

<doc id="900661" wikidata="Q4940058" url="?curid=900661" title="Bolshevik–Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma">
<text>Bolshevik–Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI) was a revolutionary Trotskyist party which campaigned for independence and socialism in South Asia. The party was formed in 1942 as a unification of two Indian groups (the Bolshevik Leninist Party of the United Provinces and Bihar and the Bolshevik Mazdoor Party of India), with the Lanka Sama Samaja Party of Ceylon (Sri Lanka). It was recognised as the Indian section of the Fourth International.

Discussions for the preliminary Committee for the Formation of the Bolshevik - Leninist Party of India took place through underground meetings in Kandy in December 1940 and March 1941 and set the stage for a sole Trotskyist party for India.

During the remainder of World War II, the BLPI influenced the trade union and student movements in several cities. Significant membership was recorded among tramway workers, as well as workers of the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills. The BLPI notably played a major role in the Quit India movement. It produced leaflets and posters giving unconditional support to the movement. It went even further, calling for the troops to revolt. The objective was ultimately for the British expulsion from India. Their efforts to direct the Quit India disruption into a revolutionary one brought significant reprisals, with members forced into hiding. The BLPI was the only political party to give unconditional support to the Royal Indian Navy mutiny.

==Early history==
===Before and during WWII===
====LSSP war activism in Ceylon====
At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP)&#x27;s key members were forced to go underground due to its opposition to the British war effort. The two State Council members of the party and others on its Central committee were arrested and jailed.

The leader of the nationalist Ceylon National Congress party and future Prime Minister of Ceylon, D.S. Senanayake tabled a resolution in the State Council, which was the unicameral legislature for Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), established in 1931 by the Donoughmore Constitution, suggesting an approach of &quot;whole-hearted support&quot; to the British government. Leaders of the LSSP – notably Philip Gunawardena who was seen as &#x27;father of Ceylonese Socialism&#x27; – denounced the war between the Allies and Axies, who he regarded as imperialist powers, declaring that: &quot;We refuse to be a part of any imperialist war. We are against all imperialist wars and exploitation. The class struggle has refused to stop because a country is at war.&quot;

During the early war period, the LSSP served in a key position in a series of worker action and strikes among tea plantation workers, stemming from the Mool Oya Estate incident (December 1939), in which an Indian tea factory worker was fatally shot by police.

====Ceylonese activism implications for India====

Through the rampantly increasing striking from the Mool Oya Estate incident, a workers&#x27; council was formed suggesting that repercussions of the deepest seriousness in India may come from any response. Following the incident, Colonial police forces used a heavy hand on the tea estates, leading to strong feelings of sentiment and discontent within the workers.

====Imprisonment of key leaders====

Sensing the growing anger against them, the LSSP was banned on 18 June, and key party activists —Philip Gunawardena, N.M. Perera, Edmund Samarakkody and Colvin R. de Silva — were detained and imprisoned. Due to its provocative nature towards the British, the LSSP was able to go underground and continue its activism.

====LSSP&#x27;s move to India and establishment of the Bolshevik Leninist Party of India====

Through discussion, the Indian and Ceylonese trotskyists established a preliminary Committee for the Formation of the Bolshevik - Leninist Party of India. The discussions for this took place through underground meetings in Kandy in December 1940 and March 1941 and set the stage for a sole Trotskyist party for India. This was later amended to include Burma and Ceylon. The meeting in 1940 and 41 were attended by the jailed LSSP leaders aided by some guards of the Bogambara Prison.

Though many were detained in Ceylon, several party leaders were able to escape to India, evading arrest. These included Party General Secretary Leslie Goonewardene and his wife, Vivienne Goonewardene. They settled in Calcutta, and established networks with the local Trotskyist networks. Other Ceylonese Trotskysists established contact with the Uttar Pradesh Trotskyist group, as well as groups in Bombay and Madras. On 7 April 1942, Philip Gunawardena, N. M. Perera, Edmund Samarakkody and Colvin R. de Silva escaped from prison aided by the prison guards and party activists Doric de Souza and Vernon Gunasekera. The BLPI was formed in May 1942 and was approved by the Fourth International.

=== War period for the newly formed BLPI ===
During World War II, the BLPI remained relatively small – a large contrast to the high expectations of a Subcontinent-wide political revolutionary party. While the BLPI&#x27;s name suggests that it also represented Burma, there was arguably no party representation there.

The Bolshevik Leninist Party found initial success, launching &quot;Spark&quot;, its party publication issued in Calcutta. Due to political suppression, the publication was moved to Bombay, and name changed to &#x27;New Spark&#x27;. They published Trotsky&#x27;s Open Letter to the Indian Workers, and other pieces.

During the remainder of World War II, the BLPI influenced the trade union and student movements in several cities. Significant membership was recorded among tramway workers, as well as workers of the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills.

== Post-war and the Quit India movement ==

===Quit India===

The BLPI took part extensively in the Quit India movement. It produced leaflets and posters giving unconditional support to the movement. It went even further, calling for the troops to revolt. In Bombay the party recruited student activists and organised strikes, as well as influencing Congress propaganda. The objective was ultimately for the British expulsion from India. Their efforts to direct the Quit India disruption into a revolutionary one brought significant reprisals, with members forced into hiding.

In Calcutta the BLPI joined a United Front with the Congress Socialist Party, the Revolutionary Socialist Party and the Forward Bloc. The front distributed leaflets. In South India, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar the BLPI distributed leaflets and led demonstrations.

=== Relationship with the Indian National Congress ===
The BLPI released details of issues within the Indian National Congress; these notably included its close connection to the landlords and its ignorance of promises made during the mass civil disobedience movements in the earlier part of the century. The BLPI also maintained a strained relationship with the Communist Party of India, who they argued had become corrupted by Stalinism. The BLPI also used the Communist Party&#x27;s war stances to gain political leverage. Whereas the Communist Party of India (CPI) supported anti-fascism before the war, this changed with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, leading the CPI to change their stance to that of opposition of war. This position again changed with the betrayal and subsequent invasion of the USSR by the Nazis, after which the CPI advocated for a British success.

=== Party split ===
Following the Quit India movement, hope was rife among South-Asian Socialist leaders. K. Tilak (Leslie Goonewardene) wrote that &#x27;The young Bolshevik-Leninist Party ... now faces its first real chance for expansion ... The situation is changing and without doubt, of all of the parties and political groups in India, the BLPI is the one which is going to gain the most in this change&#x27;.

Following the end of the Second World War, it was determined that the Ceylonese Lanka Sama Samaja Party should be separated from the BLPI.

===Bombay mutiny===

The Royal Indian Navy revolt (also called the Royal Indian Navy mutiny or Bombay mutiny) encompassed a total strike and subsequent revolt by Indian sailors of the Royal Indian Navy on board ship and shore establishments at Bombay harbour on 18 February 1946. From the initial flashpoint in Bombay, the revolt spread and found support throughout British India, from Karachi to Calcutta, and ultimately came to involve over 20,000 sailors in 78 ships and shore establishments. The mutiny was repressed with force by British troops and Royal Navy warships. Total casualties were 8 dead and 33 wounded.

The only political party to give unconditional support to the revolt was the BLPI. As soon as it got news of the revolt it came out with a call for a Hartal in support of the mutineers. BLPI members Prabhakar More and Lakshman Jadhav led the textile workers out on strike. Barricades were set up and held for three days. However, attempts to contact the mutineers were foiled by British troops.

===Post-war Sri Lanka===
After the war, when the formerly exiled Ceylonese politicians returned home, they came back to a divided movement. Two of the main leaders of LSSP, N.M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena, had been released from jail. They now reconstructed LSSP as an independent party, the core being the &#x27;Workers&#x27; Opposition&#x27; faction, which held the trade unions. Effectively there were two parallel LSSPs, one led by Perera and Gunawardena and the BLPI-section led by Colvin R de Silva, Leslie Goonawardene and Edmund Samarakkoddy, which had been formed around the Bolshevik-Leninist Faction of Doric de Souza. The English language organ of the BLPI-section was &quot;Fight&quot;. There was a brief reconciliation between the two factions in 1946.

The BLPI section contested the 1947 election, in which it gained 5 seats in Parliament, compared to the LSSP&#x27;s 10. In the 1947 election, the BLPI was the party with the third highest overall votes, with the LSSP becoming the main opposition party. The Ceylon section of BLPI was converted into the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party, the Ceylon section of the Fourth International.

===Post-war India===
The remainder of the BLPI in India was concentrated in Calcutta, Madras and Madurai, where the party was active in trade union work. In 1946 S. C. C. Anthonypillai, one of the Ceylonese (Sri Lankan) political leaders, was elected President of the Madras Labour Union (India&#x27;s oldest union) and the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway Workers&#x27; Union.

In 1948, the Fourth International asked the party to enter the Socialist Party of India and practice entryism there.

<doc id="900665" wikidata="Q2320975" url="?curid=900665" title="List of fictional games">
<text>Fictional games are games which were specifically created for works of fiction, or which otherwise originated in fiction.

In his foundational academic work on this topic, Stefano Gualeni defines fictional games as &quot;playful activities and ludic artefacts conceptualized as part of fictional worlds&quot;, and emphasizes that - as elements of a work of fiction - their purpose is to trigger the imagination of the audience and cannot actually be (or at least were not originally meant to be) played.

Many fictional games have, however, been adapted into real games by fans or by creating pieces and rules to fit the descriptions given in the source work. For example, unofficial versions of Fizzbin can be found in reality, and Mornington Crescent is widely played in online forums.

Fictional games tend not to be presented in a detailed and formally complete manner by their authors. Within the respective works of fiction, they are typically defined just clearly enough to achieve their intended narrative functions.

<text>W. &amp; J. Sloane, (W&amp;J Sloane, Sloane&#x27;s), was a chain of furniture stores that originated from a luxury furniture and rug store in New York City that catered to the prominent, including the White House and the Breakers, and wealthy, including the Rockefeller, Whitney, and Vanderbilt families.

After a long period of prosperity, nationwide expansion and prominence, the firm went through a short period of decline and was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1985.

==History==
On March 2, 1843, the company was founded as a rug importer and seller by William Sloane, who had just emigrated from Kilmarnock, Scotland, a town famous for expensive furniture, fine carpets and rugs. Its teak and jute resources came from East Bengal (present day Bangladesh). In 1852, his younger brother John W. Sloane joined the firm, upon which it was renamed W. &amp; J. Sloane, followed by William&#x27;s son William D. Sloane. It was the first company to import oriental carpets into the United States. It soon expanded to include furniture and other home furnishings, and quickly became the choice of the elite in New York.

In 1875, Sloane&#x27;s established an outlet for the import of carpets and home furnishings in San Francisco. 

In the late 19th century, the company added an antiques department, started producing furniture, and became the first home furnishings store in the country, billing itself as &quot;W. &amp; J. Sloane Interior Decorators and Home Furnishers.&quot; Its flagship store was originally located at Broadway and 19th Street, in &quot;Ladies&#x27; Mile&quot;, relocating later to 414 Fifth Avenue at 38th Street, the former flagship of Franklin Simon &amp; Co.

===Taste-setter for America===
In 1891, W. &amp; J. Sloane incorporated and set the national decorating taste of the United States, and over the next sixty years decorated the homes of the most prominent people in the country, including the Breakers and the White House, created Hollywood movie sets, and even designed and decorated interiors of automobiles. It opened a branch in San Francisco, California originally to furnish pavilions at the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition (it also furnished the model homes at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair). It later acquired other upscale firms such as the California Furniture Company, and in 1925 a subsidiary, the Company of Master Craftsmen was founded by William Sloane Coffin Sr. (the father of Rev. William Sloane Coffin) to create colonial revival furniture. 

===San Francisco===
In March 1909, Sloane&#x27;s moved from Van Ness and Market and the next month held the grand opening of its grand new, , 9-story Gothic/Renaissance-style flagship store near Union Square at 216–228 (now 222) Sutter Street, designed by Reid &amp; Reid, which still bears the W. &amp; J. Sloane sign as part of its cladding.
===Washington, D.C.===
In March 1926, Sloane&#x27;s moved its small Washington, D.C. store on H Street near the White House into much larger quarters at 708–12 12th St. near G St., site of a present-day Macy&#x27;s in the F Street shopping district. It would later move again to Connecticut Avenue in the Dupont Circle.

===Los Angeles stores===
In 1928, it acquired the California Furniture Company and converted its store at the Joseph E. Carr Building, 644–6 S. Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles, built in 1908-9 and designed by architect Robert Brown Young, to the W. &amp; J. Sloane Los Angeles store. The building would later (1947–1980) serve as the second downtown flagship of local clothing chain Harris &amp; Frank. In 1935 it closed and moved to the then-new upscale shopping district, Beverly Hills. The building at 9536 Wilshire Boulevard on the corner of Rodeo Drive would later house a branch of Los Angeles-based Haggarty&#x27;s Furniture, and from 1972 to 1987, Bonwit Teller. Sloane&#x27;s first Beverly Hills location was so successful that it soon moved to larger quarters next door, which would become a Gumps after Sloane&#x27;s demise. 

During World War II the company worked with the Newport News Company and the North Carolina Shipbuilding Company on shipbuilding contracts for the United States Navy fitting out the interiors of liberty ships under the direction of John Sloane Griswold.

===Suburban expansion===
In 1955, after a three-year internal struggle, control of the firm left the hands of a direct descendant of the Sloanes when Benjamin Coates, 37, was elected president. This meant the ouster of president W.E.S. Griswold Jr. and chairman of the board John D. Sloane, both grandsons of the founders. Coates was a financier who married John D. Sloane&#x27;s daughter in 1944 and served on the board. Along with the City Stores Company syndicate, he bought up 70% of the stock to win control and become head of the firm.

After the store left family hands, further growth over the decades was characterized as &quot;over-expansion&quot; while Sloane&#x27;s lowered the price and quality of its goods during this period. Sloane&#x27;s opened New York City-area suburban US branches in Garden City, Manhasset, on Post Road in White Plains, Fashion Center in Paramus, Short Hills, Red Bank, Fox Pavilion in Jenkintown, PA outside Philadelphia, and in Connecticut at Ridgeway Center in Stamford as well as in Hartford, for an eventual total of 15.

===Decline===
City Stores was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1979 so that it could &quot;continue operating while it works out a plan to pay its creditors.&quot;

Sloane&#x27;s was then acquired by Hollywood-based RB Furniture in 1981. The chain closed its 38th Street store in 1984, and filed for bankruptcy on September 11, 1985. Its remaining stores were sold in 1986.

==Legacy==
The company generated considerable wealth for the direct descendants of William and John Sloane, who include in addition to Rev. Coffin, diplomat Cyrus Vance, attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., musical producer John H. Hammond, his son, musician John P. Hammond, and philanthropist Emily Thorn Vanderbilt Sloane. It also brought the Sloane family into prominence in New York City, where they intermarried with the Whitneys, the Vanderbilts, and the Pynes. Employees who worked for the firm include the American cooking icon Julia Child (then Julia McWilliams), whose first job out of Smith College in October 1935 was Assistant to the New York Advertising Manager, A. W. Forester. Other notables include the Bevelacqua brothers: Salvatore and Aurelio, who designed under the Sloane banner before their respective success in furniture design.
